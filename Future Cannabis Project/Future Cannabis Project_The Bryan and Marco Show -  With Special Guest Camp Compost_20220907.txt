[00:00.320 --> 00:03.320]  Good morning, Living Soil nerds.
[00:03.320 --> 00:05.320]  It's actually afternoon, isn't it?
[00:05.320 --> 00:07.320]  As soon as I said that, I was like, yeah.
[00:07.320 --> 00:10.320]  Behind the scenes, you know, we've been, you know,
[00:10.320 --> 00:13.320]  really kind of putting together a lot of the shows,
[00:13.320 --> 00:16.320]  and I wanted to kind of give a tip of the hat to Marco,
[00:16.320 --> 00:19.320]  because he's starting to really see how frustrating
[00:19.320 --> 00:21.320]  these things can be week after week,
[00:21.320 --> 00:24.320]  and people that you look up to sometimes, you know,
[00:24.320 --> 00:27.320]  when you find out sometimes how people really are
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.320]  behind the scenes, it's eye-opening.
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.320]  So I wanted to start with that, because I love the fact
[00:33.320 --> 00:37.320]  that Camp Compost is the exact opposite of all of that stuff.
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.320]  It seems like you guys even, you know,
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.320]  you changed it from the Compost Cup to Camp Compost
[00:42.320 --> 00:45.320]  to, I think, further remove the ego aspect
[00:45.320 --> 00:48.320]  of what you guys are creating, and that's, I mean,
[00:48.320 --> 00:50.320]  the hat's off to you.
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.320]  I mean, that's really what we're all about,
[00:52.320 --> 00:55.320]  is just really trying for the community itself to rise up,
[00:55.320 --> 00:57.320]  not just for, like, a few individuals,
[00:57.320 --> 00:59.320]  or for a few individuals to be seen
[00:59.320 --> 01:01.320]  as some kind of, like, super guru.
[01:01.320 --> 01:03.320]  There's so many people to learn from,
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.320]  and so many people that are getting into this,
[01:06.320 --> 01:08.320]  and, you know, new knowledge, new brains getting into this,
[01:08.320 --> 01:10.320]  thinking of different ways that I would hate
[01:10.320 --> 01:13.320]  to ever pinjon-hole anything, and so that's another reason
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.320]  why I reached out to you guys, you know,
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.320]  everybody involved with Camp Compost,
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.320]  is because you guys, it seems like you're putting
[01:20.320 --> 01:23.320]  the community first, and that's obviously
[01:23.320 --> 01:25.320]  what Future Cannabis Project's all about,
[01:25.320 --> 01:27.320]  everybody that's involved in that,
[01:27.320 --> 01:29.320]  the show on Wednesdays, Marco, myself, and Ken,
[01:29.320 --> 01:32.320]  just anybody that's going out of their way to educate,
[01:32.320 --> 01:34.320]  and the best part is, for free,
[01:34.320 --> 01:36.320]  or just trying to keep it as low cost,
[01:36.320 --> 01:38.320]  because things do cost venues and all that,
[01:38.320 --> 01:41.320]  but keeping it low end, you know,
[01:41.320 --> 01:43.320]  in a way, it kind of pisses me off
[01:43.320 --> 01:45.320]  when I start to see individuals where they've paid,
[01:45.320 --> 01:47.320]  you know, let's say 800 bucks to learn something,
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.320]  and then they're charged 1,500 bucks
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.320]  to teach that same material,
[01:52.320 --> 01:54.320]  and sometimes that should be, you know, pointed out,
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.320]  so it's just another example of what you guys are doing,
[01:57.320 --> 02:00.320]  where you guys live, you guys have kind of become
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.320]  more of a beacon for high-end cannabis,
[02:02.320 --> 02:04.320]  and, you know, shame on the other states
[02:04.320 --> 02:07.320]  for letting you guys kind of take that flag away,
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.320]  but a lot of bright minds are hanging out this weekend.
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.320]  I want to let Marco kind of put his input into it,
[02:13.320 --> 02:15.320]  and then, yeah, I'm all about hyping this,
[02:15.320 --> 02:18.320]  and hopefully we can just, you know,
[02:18.320 --> 02:20.320]  get enough people that really are starting to see
[02:20.320 --> 02:23.320]  that there's individuals all over the country
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.320]  that are now, you know, living and breathing
[02:26.320 --> 02:28.320]  the movement that a lot of us wanted,
[02:28.320 --> 02:30.320]  you know, five years ago.
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.320]  Yes, definitely. Thank you, Brian.
[02:33.320 --> 02:35.320]  Appreciate everybody for being here.
[02:35.320 --> 02:37.320]  You know, happy Wednesday.
[02:37.320 --> 02:39.320]  Camp Compost in the house.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.320]  I'm excited about this one, you know.
[02:41.320 --> 02:43.320]  I'm excited about all of them,
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.320]  but this one's going to be extra special for me.
[02:45.320 --> 02:47.320]  You know, I love getting down in the soil,
[02:47.320 --> 02:50.320]  and these are all people that I really respect,
[02:50.320 --> 02:52.320]  and they really know their game
[02:52.320 --> 02:54.320]  when it comes to what's in the soil,
[02:54.320 --> 02:56.320]  what makes good soil, what makes good compost,
[02:56.320 --> 02:59.320]  et cetera and et cetera.
[02:59.320 --> 03:02.320]  Yeah, I haven't even talked to some of you in person,
[03:02.320 --> 03:05.320]  but kind of before we get into that,
[03:05.320 --> 03:07.320]  jumping back to what Brian was saying, you know,
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.320]  we're all growing together, you know,
[03:09.320 --> 03:12.320]  and if you look to only like one big, you know,
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.320]  entity within our community, you know,
[03:15.320 --> 03:17.320]  then that's not really growth.
[03:17.320 --> 03:19.320]  So it takes like there's some big guys,
[03:19.320 --> 03:21.320]  there's some small guys, there's some medium guys,
[03:21.320 --> 03:23.320]  and there's quality,
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.320]  and there's value at all these different levels.
[03:26.320 --> 03:28.320]  Shout out to Payone and Soil Company.
[03:28.320 --> 03:31.320]  You know, some people may not even know of them,
[03:31.320 --> 03:36.320]  but to me, they're a great company, you know, family-owned,
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.320]  focus on that diversity in their soil,
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.320]  and I think it shows with their final product, you know.
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.320]  So with that said, I'd like to get on into the compost.
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.320]  You guys have the compost camp coming up, or camp compost.
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.320]  I wanted to be there this year.
[03:53.320 --> 03:55.320]  Brian and I talked, we couldn't make it happen.
[03:55.320 --> 03:58.320]  We're definitely going to get there next year.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.320]  So we got a lot of stuff to talk about,
[04:00.320 --> 04:01.320]  but I don't know who wants to start,
[04:01.320 --> 04:04.320]  but maybe somebody can kind of talk about what camp compost is,
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.320]  what kind of things you guys are going to be getting into next week,
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.320]  and then we'll just kind of get the conversation going.
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.320]  Either of you guys want that? Alexa, Mike?
[04:16.320 --> 04:19.320]  Jan, go for it.
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.320]  All right. Camp compost is a celebration of soil and life,
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.320]  and so we're going to get together,
[04:26.320 --> 04:29.320]  and we're going to talk about soil health, how that relates to human health.
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.320]  We're going to talk about building soil,
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.320]  all these cool regenerative practices that are practical.
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.320]  It's a gathering of the soil nerds,
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.320]  but also it's a gathering of just anybody that has any interest in this.
[04:41.320 --> 04:43.320]  Anybody that wants to be an expert at all.
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.320]  You just have to want to learn, you know, and come get together,
[04:47.320 --> 04:50.320]  and we're all just going to be having a great time, sharing good energy,
[04:50.320 --> 04:52.320]  sharing good food.
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.320]  Everybody's going to be a harvest party, basically.
[04:55.320 --> 04:58.320]  So it's a lot more than just talking about soil,
[04:58.320 --> 05:02.320]  and we're going to be doing that through hands-on demonstrations,
[05:02.320 --> 05:06.320]  and so we're kind of like focusing on not having PowerPoints,
[05:06.320 --> 05:08.320]  no boring lectures, anything like that.
[05:08.320 --> 05:14.320]  And so it's learning through doing, and it's the power of community too.
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.320]  So a lot of this stuff would take one person, maybe, you know,
[05:18.320 --> 05:21.320]  a whole entire week to build a hugelkultur, right, or, you know,
[05:21.320 --> 05:23.320]  a couple days, and it's back-breaking work,
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.320]  but we can do it bringing the community together and get that stuff done
[05:27.320 --> 05:29.320]  in like a half an hour and have fun while doing it,
[05:29.320 --> 05:31.320]  and then, you know, share some doobies after.
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.320]  It's all about having fun and regenerating soil.
[05:36.320 --> 05:37.320]  Nice.
[05:37.320 --> 05:40.320]  Now I know you guys have kind of like an itinerary and stuff.
[05:40.320 --> 05:42.320]  Do you guys kind of want to go over that real quick
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.320]  so people kind of understand?
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.320]  I mean, the sad thing is when a lot of these cannabis events,
[05:48.320 --> 05:51.320]  people talk about them and stuff, they're great in theory,
[05:51.320 --> 05:53.320]  but the organization and stuff is never there.
[05:53.320 --> 05:57.320]  And again, I want to highlight that because it seems like you guys are the,
[05:57.320 --> 05:59.320]  you know, the exact opposite of that.
[05:59.320 --> 06:01.320]  It seems like you're going out of your way to be organized.
[06:01.320 --> 06:04.320]  You have the days set up with the speakers and how.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.320]  So let's get into that.
[06:05.320 --> 06:07.320]  And then, of course, you know,
[06:07.320 --> 06:10.320]  we also want to drop some gold bars today so that people can realize,
[06:10.320 --> 06:14.320]  you know, there's a lot more individuals getting into this kind of stuff that,
[06:14.320 --> 06:17.320]  you know, you guys are at the forefront of this, in my opinion,
[06:17.320 --> 06:19.320]  for putting together events.
[06:19.320 --> 06:24.320]  This is something that I think is the spirit behind it is more what I'm,
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.320]  what I'm getting at.
[06:25.320 --> 06:29.320]  And I hope that this continues for, you know, the rest of our lives.
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:33.320 --> 06:38.320]  So just to kind of go off of what Chandler said about community,
[06:38.320 --> 06:43.320]  this is something we really hope to highlight this weekend through the
[06:43.320 --> 06:46.320]  activities and demonstrations that we are doing,
[06:46.320 --> 06:51.320]  just like the power of the community and how quickly we can achieve goals
[06:51.320 --> 06:53.320]  when we work together.
[06:53.320 --> 06:56.320]  Manifestation happens almost instantly.
[06:56.320 --> 07:01.320]  So it's just magic when we get together and have a common goal.
[07:01.320 --> 07:04.320]  And yeah, regarding the schedule,
[07:04.320 --> 07:08.320]  that's something we didn't really have last year.
[07:08.320 --> 07:11.320]  We kind of had an outline of what we were going to do,
[07:11.320 --> 07:15.320]  but it really just kind of, we just went with the flow.
[07:15.320 --> 07:21.320]  But this year we are definitely going to be sticking to the schedule and we
[07:21.320 --> 07:28.320]  planned a lot fewer things and are focusing on a few main components of
[07:29.320 --> 07:34.320]  demonstrations that we feel are very important to cover.
[07:34.320 --> 07:38.320]  And we carved out a lot of time for those.
[07:38.320 --> 07:43.320]  And we also carved out a lot of time for just creating community and
[07:43.320 --> 07:46.320]  networking and free time as well.
[07:48.320 --> 07:52.590]  Everybody to, you know, just be taking notes all day long.
[07:52.590 --> 07:56.590]  We've been setting up cool areas all throughout the woods and the city.
[07:56.590 --> 07:59.590]  Mike's got 22 acres up there and it's just beautiful, beautiful property.
[07:59.590 --> 08:02.590]  And a lot of this weekend is about, you know, reconnecting with nature.
[08:02.590 --> 08:06.590]  And so we want people that maybe don't spend every week in the woods like I
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.590]  do, you know,
[08:07.590 --> 08:10.590]  to go out and be able to find some mushrooms and some,
[08:10.590 --> 08:13.590]  some plants and spend some time out there with that energy and with
[08:13.590 --> 08:16.590]  themselves and learn some things and reconnect with nature.
[08:16.590 --> 08:18.590]  And so that's a huge part of it as well.
[08:18.590 --> 08:19.590]  Yeah. And I, you know,
[08:19.590 --> 08:22.590]  I think I shared either with you guys that we're going to be doing a lot
[08:52.590 --> 08:53.590]  of things.
[08:53.590 --> 08:55.590]  And I think that's a huge part of it as well.
[08:55.590 --> 08:57.590]  Yeah. And I, you know,
[08:57.590 --> 09:00.590]  I think I shared either on Alexis podcast or yours Chandler.
[09:00.590 --> 09:02.590]  You know, I was kind of in a way, like,
[09:02.590 --> 09:04.590]  I don't want to use the word dismissed,
[09:04.590 --> 09:08.590]  but I almost kind of dismissed when I saw certain individuals walking around
[09:08.590 --> 09:10.590]  barefoot the entire week, when I was,
[09:10.590 --> 09:12.590]  when I attended like a Trump event.
[09:12.590 --> 09:15.590]  And so, you know, the last two days, you know,
[09:15.590 --> 09:17.590]  one in Rome, I guess, kind of thing.
[09:17.590 --> 09:21.590]  I did not ever, but, but I was amazed of like,
[09:21.590 --> 09:23.330]  long friends that you could potentially meet there.
[09:23.330 --> 09:25.210]  There's definitely lifelong education there.
[09:25.850 --> 09:28.430]  And you never know if those are going to happen again.
[09:28.430 --> 09:32.530]  I think especially for me, some of the bigger expos and things that I thought
[09:32.530 --> 09:36.170]  would be there forever, you know, the one gentleman passed away.
[09:36.350 --> 09:39.290]  So you just don't you just don't know what's going to happen in life.
[09:39.290 --> 09:43.050]  And so I think this is something if you're attending it this weekend, you got to put
[09:43.050 --> 09:44.290]  all your focus on that.
[09:44.290 --> 09:49.770]  Like I would I would throw my phone in the fucking backpack and just be in nature and
[09:49.770 --> 09:55.070]  just, you know, kind of just just cut the cord, if you will.
[09:55.610 --> 09:59.150]  You know, life will be there when you when you get back to your phone and all that.
[09:59.150 --> 10:04.110]  But I highly, highly, highly want you guys to focus on that if you can, because I think
[10:04.110 --> 10:07.530]  you're going to get a lot more out of what they're offering if you choose to do it that
[10:07.530 --> 10:07.730]  way.
[10:08.210 --> 10:09.990]  Gold bars there, Brian.
[10:10.050 --> 10:14.490]  Be on the move, you know, I've learned that as well, man.
[10:14.490 --> 10:18.090]  When you do those kind of things and they're unfamiliar to you, it's best to just
[10:18.110 --> 10:20.770]  loosen up and just go with the flow, just do it there.
[10:21.150 --> 10:22.490]  What everyone else is doing.
[10:23.790 --> 10:26.370]  Like you said, I can see you now you're there with your shoes on.
[10:26.370 --> 10:29.110]  You know, you didn't want to kind of felt weird taking your shoes off.
[10:29.110 --> 10:32.450]  But when you get on into and get into the moment, it's very beneficial.
[10:32.470 --> 10:34.670]  So I can kind of see this thing would be great, man.
[10:34.670 --> 10:40.210]  Just groups wandering off, kind of going mushroom hunting and different things going
[10:40.210 --> 10:42.190]  on. Man, I bet this is going to be wonderful.
[10:42.190 --> 10:43.570]  And it is just camping only.
[10:43.570 --> 10:45.790]  Right. Everybody brings their tent and comes on out.
[10:46.110 --> 10:47.490]  Yeah, exactly. All right.
[10:47.490 --> 10:50.750]  Nice. Under the full moon.
[10:50.750 --> 10:54.150]  So we plan it that way so you can get to your your campsite easily.
[10:54.570 --> 10:56.110]  You can see out there really well.
[10:56.490 --> 10:59.630]  But also there's some areas in the woods that we cleared out and we got some lights
[10:59.630 --> 11:02.430]  hanging. And it's seriously like a magical place.
[11:02.430 --> 11:05.390]  Like it's going to be a lot of fun for sure.
[11:06.510 --> 11:07.650]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[11:08.610 --> 11:11.350]  I want to I want to get my concerns of the conversation.
[11:11.670 --> 11:13.510]  So this is obviously your property, sir.
[11:13.530 --> 11:17.650]  You want to pronounce this Kuliana consulting?
[11:18.050 --> 11:19.050]  Yes. Kuliana.
[11:19.650 --> 11:22.870]  Yes. That's a Hawaiian word for responsibility.
[11:23.370 --> 11:24.850]  Just for nice. All right.
[11:25.210 --> 11:26.470]  So let's get into that.
[11:26.470 --> 11:30.010]  Like, you know, obviously you're gracious enough to have everybody come on your
[11:30.010 --> 11:34.090]  property. You know, I threw parties when I was younger and that is a nightmare when
[11:34.090 --> 11:37.630]  everybody comes. So, you know, hats off to you for even putting your property probably
[11:37.630 --> 11:41.870]  through. Even if people respect it, it's just you know, it's just when a lot of people
[11:41.870 --> 11:44.810]  are somewhere, it's just a lot of wear and tear on anything.
[11:45.490 --> 11:48.730]  So, you know, how do you kind of fall into this?
[11:48.730 --> 11:52.990]  Some of this stuff, like if you're doing on the consulting, it seems like you're going
[11:52.990 --> 11:58.070]  to Hawaii with the verbiage of your name and brand, you know, where it
[11:58.070 --> 12:01.230]  seems like you're probably going and understanding things on a whole nother level and
[12:01.230 --> 12:03.290]  then bringing bringing that back to Michigan.
[12:04.050 --> 12:07.650]  Yeah, I kind of stumbled upon the Kuliana name.
[12:08.650 --> 12:12.870]  You know, my wife and I, we travel to Hawaii pretty much every year.
[12:13.550 --> 12:15.990]  We really love Hawaii. We love the culture.
[12:16.910 --> 12:21.590]  You know, I've also learned a lot of the natural farming techniques in Hawaii.
[12:21.590 --> 12:24.450]  It's kind of where I was introduced to farming in a natural way.
[12:24.470 --> 12:28.630]  So the word being responsibility, I kind of view this and I think
[12:29.750 --> 12:34.110]  Chandler and Lexa feel the same way that, you know, this is our responsibility to
[12:34.510 --> 12:36.790]  continue to pass this information along.
[12:37.210 --> 12:39.170]  We didn't make this information up.
[12:39.170 --> 12:41.450]  We learned it and we're just going to keep passing it and passing it.
[12:41.810 --> 12:45.610]  And, you know, they say Chandler and Lexa talk about inoculating minds.
[12:45.610 --> 12:47.090]  And, you know, that's really the goal.
[12:47.450 --> 12:49.650]  And so that's where Kuliana comes in.
[12:49.870 --> 12:53.170]  And that's where, you know, the Hawaiian part comes in.
[12:53.530 --> 12:55.890]  We're not Hawaiian or anything, but we just love Hawaii.
[12:55.930 --> 12:57.650]  We love the culture. It's given a lot to us.
[12:57.670 --> 13:01.530]  So, you know, we're trying to get back to that, perpetuate that as well.
[13:01.530 --> 13:05.570]  So, yeah, I'm happy to have it on the property.
[13:05.590 --> 13:08.990]  It is a little nerve wracking, but, you know, last year everyone was so gracious.
[13:08.990 --> 13:10.270]  You know, it's such a wonderful crowd.
[13:10.270 --> 13:13.710]  And I mean, I'm not even worried this year.
[13:13.710 --> 13:14.870]  I think it's going to be even better.
[13:14.870 --> 13:20.430]  So everyone come and enjoy yourself, connect with nature, walk barefoot as much as you like.
[13:21.230 --> 13:26.330]  It's been a dry year, though, so it's a little rough on your feet if you're not used to it.
[13:26.350 --> 13:29.950]  So, you know, go in slow spurts as someone who walks barefoot a lot.
[13:29.990 --> 13:32.390]  You know, you got to build that, build your feet up.
[13:32.890 --> 13:35.570]  A little crispy out there, might catch a pine cone.
[13:35.930 --> 13:37.490]  Yeah, a little bit crispy.
[13:39.530 --> 13:43.410]  Yeah, but when you're when you're hanging with those kind of people, you're usually so stoned anyway.
[13:43.410 --> 13:45.530]  It's like, yeah, I mean, I feel it, but I don't.
[13:45.770 --> 13:48.770]  You know, I think it's just something fun to be a part of.
[13:49.450 --> 13:52.610]  So do you guys did you have the itinerary?
[13:52.850 --> 13:55.170]  Did you notice there were certain things?
[13:55.190 --> 13:57.250]  I didn't know if that was on the website or.
[13:58.130 --> 14:00.690]  Um, yeah, I think the schedule's on the website.
[14:00.690 --> 14:06.470]  They got all the individual demos, but a better double check that we have all the times on there, too.
[14:06.910 --> 14:09.590]  But basically it starts Friday at five o'clock.
[14:10.910 --> 14:15.690]  Open to campers and then we're going to do a hemp stalk inoculation.
[14:16.070 --> 14:19.990]  And so Robbie, our friend, Michael Generative, has been doing this at HIFA.
[14:20.030 --> 14:27.430]  I've tried this a couple of times and basically he's found this way to pasteurize ganja stalks using
[14:27.450 --> 14:32.450]  pickling lime and then inoculate it, re-inoculate it with oyster mushroom spawn.
[14:32.890 --> 14:35.490]  And then the oyster mushrooms eat the ganja stalks.
[14:35.530 --> 14:37.570]  They produce a ton of CO2 for your grow.
[14:38.330 --> 14:43.090]  When the time's right, you can cut your bags open and fruit pounds of delicious, nutritious food.
[14:43.690 --> 14:47.250]  And then you can break up all that substrate and spread it in your beds.
[14:47.350 --> 14:49.290]  And it is a great soil builder.
[14:50.090 --> 14:52.490]  Alexa can probably talk more about that using that at HIFA.
[14:52.930 --> 14:55.130]  But, um, yeah, it's going to be sweet.
[14:55.150 --> 15:00.350]  We're going to do part one on Friday night and then we're going to do part two during Saturday.
[15:00.830 --> 15:04.470]  And then after that, we're going to do a biochar demo, which I'm going to lead.
[15:04.630 --> 15:12.790]  And basically we want everybody to bring in your ferments, your inputs that you're proud of.
[15:12.950 --> 15:18.030]  And we're going to add, you know, tiny little bits to the water that we're inoculating all this stuff with.
[15:18.070 --> 15:23.270]  So you can bring your compost, you can bring your JLF, you know, your FPJ, whatever you want.
[15:23.290 --> 15:25.210]  We're going to, you know, good mixture.
[15:27.250 --> 15:31.970]  And, you know, bless the water, put all of our intentions into it and then make biochar together as a group.
[15:32.410 --> 15:37.130]  Put out those coals and inoculate it with all of those indigenous microbes from throughout the state.
[15:38.090 --> 15:41.450]  Create a really, really awesome biochar.
[15:41.930 --> 15:50.810]  And then we're going to be, so all of these demos that we're doing throughout the weekend, they are all going to come back into play on Sunday when we do our hugelkultur demo.
[15:50.830 --> 15:55.750]  That's when we're going to add like all of the stuff right into the hugelkultur and see how it's done and how it's applied.
[15:56.390 --> 15:59.550]  That biochar is worth the price of admission alone, man.
[15:59.550 --> 16:03.790]  Just to have all that diversity in there you guys are going to have is going to be amazing.
[16:03.870 --> 16:04.550]  Absolutely.
[16:04.990 --> 16:10.790]  Well, and the way that you make it, it's more like glass where I see a lot of people that make biochar.
[16:10.990 --> 16:12.230]  I've never seen it that way.
[16:12.550 --> 16:16.790]  So your tech is just a little bit next level.
[16:17.870 --> 16:19.190]  Shout out to Quattamoc for that.
[16:19.210 --> 16:22.970]  But yeah, I've been practicing for sure and making some fire char, no doubt.
[16:25.050 --> 16:36.770]  And from what I understand, I mean, I know I'm speaking on something that you know way more about, but the glass texture and all that is just like it just shows that it was done properly.
[16:36.770 --> 16:37.890]  There's quality there.
[16:38.210 --> 16:47.630]  Or some of the stuff that you make there by adding that biochar, even when we spoke with Bart from Payoneer Soil, he was making certain things at a high commercial level.
[16:47.850 --> 17:01.730]  And he started to notice that if it's not done correctly and even some if it's done correctly, that over time that microbial life goes diverse and then it goes, it drops back down dramatically because the alphas kind of take over.
[17:03.210 --> 17:12.570]  There's a lot to think about with this stuff, but the fact that you guys are doing the hands on demonstrations, I think that's how most of us cannabis individuals learn.
[17:12.790 --> 17:19.310]  I mean, yes, we can read books and watch videos, but man, just to be there, kind of have the smell.
[17:19.550 --> 17:30.230]  That was the one thing I did like, you know, going into some of those other paying the money and being is to be able to actually even taste some of that stuff or have the horrific smell of something that has gone putrid.
[17:30.550 --> 17:32.150]  Like you don't really forget that.
[17:32.470 --> 17:39.670]  So then if you ever smell that in what you're working with, it's easily identifiable and then you can get rid of it.
[17:40.150 --> 17:40.670]  For sure.
[17:40.690 --> 17:49.130]  Yeah, I've been to some of the expensive conferences as well and we just watch PowerPoints and like, it's like literally I saw the same exact clip of Elaine on YouTube for free.
[17:49.130 --> 17:50.490]  Like, why am I paying for this?
[17:50.490 --> 17:53.050]  Like let's do some hands on stuff, you know,
[17:53.930 --> 18:10.290]  I'll tell you a point about biochar, Brian, you know, doing and also you Jethouse, the hands on is key because the thing is with biochar, a lot of people will char things and they might not be completely charred, you know, and that's what you were talking about, Brian, that kind of glass sound.
[18:10.470 --> 18:17.830]  Where it's like your wood or your bone or your stalks get sort of like a hollow crystal, like crystally sound.
[18:18.070 --> 18:18.570]  Yeah.
[18:18.950 --> 18:20.270]  And it's just pure carbon.
[18:20.270 --> 18:21.030]  Everything else is.
[18:21.030 --> 18:21.630]  Yeah.
[18:22.750 --> 18:29.470]  And think about it, if you were to build the soil and you had a large volume, you know, adding your biochar and it wasn't charred correctly.
[18:29.470 --> 18:33.210]  And so the middle of it was still raw wood or whatever that was.
[18:33.510 --> 18:37.390]  Now that could that's probably where you was noticing those problems, too.
[18:37.430 --> 18:39.030]  So just adding a little bit onto that.
[18:39.450 --> 18:40.050]  For sure.
[18:40.090 --> 18:49.890]  Or not inoculating it with enough biology, then it's not biochar and it's just char, you know, and it's going to sponge up, take some of the nutrients, some of your water, some of your microbes from your soil already.
[18:49.890 --> 18:58.330]  And so like I never like seeing I know you've seen like the videos of me dropping the char on top of itself and it sounds like glass, but like that's not the final process.
[18:58.330 --> 19:04.010]  You know, then I take that and I mix that with compost and I let it all sit together and, you know, let it all seep.
[19:04.170 --> 19:08.610]  And so I don't like seeing just plain biochar applied to the soil.
[19:08.630 --> 19:12.230]  I was like broken up pretty fine and then mixed in with compost.
[19:12.230 --> 19:16.230]  And I pretty much use compost as a carrier for anything that I apply to the soil.
[19:16.230 --> 19:17.630]  I always mix it in with the compost.
[19:17.950 --> 19:23.030]  Nice, because then it turns into more of even a soil almost that biochar.
[19:23.310 --> 19:24.230]  You pick it up.
[19:24.230 --> 19:30.870]  Your hand is so like, you know, covered in black and, you know, as opposed to just the dry particles.
[19:30.870 --> 19:32.630]  So I like that. And that was a that was a go part.
[19:32.630 --> 19:39.410]  A bar, you said to guys when you're adding bio, when you're adding char, it's not bio until you add that bio.
[19:39.410 --> 19:49.170]  And if you're adding raw, naked char to your soil, like Jethel said, now you're pulling things out of your soil equalizing into the char.
[19:49.170 --> 19:52.970]  So you want to have full of life, high biology in your char before you add.
[19:53.130 --> 19:55.170]  So this stuff like this would be wonderful, man.
[19:55.170 --> 19:56.330]  Hands on learning it.
[19:57.190 --> 20:01.350]  It is all about the biology.
[20:02.190 --> 20:03.430]  Amen, Mr. Ken.
[20:04.750 --> 20:11.350]  And I, you know, I've noticed, too, like with the isopods, like throwing a little biochar in there, they love to sit on it and stuff.
[20:11.350 --> 20:18.470]  So I think what what a lot of people have at first were saying, like biochar, they were probably just mixing too heavy.
[20:18.830 --> 20:25.630]  And so if you if you put like 30 percent or something in there, I mean, you're going to have problems, especially over the long run.
[20:25.630 --> 20:35.770]  So I think being able to learn how to do this, create that skill set for yourself and then realizing that for the most part, it's kind of a one and done or maybe a sprinkle here and there.
[20:37.010 --> 20:43.050]  Definitely, and when and where to use it, you know, you're going to need it a lot more in sandy soil than clay soil for sure.
[20:45.970 --> 20:47.330]  All right. You want to get going?
[20:48.850 --> 20:51.490]  Can I jump in on the biochar for a second, guys?
[20:52.110 --> 21:01.910]  Remember, biochar, what it was actually used for was odor control in the mizzen pits in Brazil where they found it.
[21:01.910 --> 21:05.030]  It isn't quite what we think it is.
[21:05.030 --> 21:08.550]  So try not to add more than about two percent.
[21:10.110 --> 21:11.830]  It was just like in the military.
[21:11.830 --> 21:15.390]  What we use now to hold odor down is charcoal.
[21:15.750 --> 21:19.230]  That's what was used in Brazil and the cities they had down there.
[21:19.690 --> 21:24.970]  And so we think it's a super soil, but that's not was never what was actually meant to be.
[21:25.250 --> 21:31.490]  But charring your bones for your K and F inputs is really important as well.
[21:31.490 --> 21:37.290]  But the biochar isn't quite as important, I think, as what what we think it is.
[21:37.290 --> 21:39.690]  I think it was just a confusion at one point.
[21:43.530 --> 21:45.330]  Are you talking about the terra predapit?
[21:45.550 --> 21:50.430]  Yeah, I want to hear what Chaylor has to say on that, because I love when people have different different opinions.
[21:50.430 --> 21:55.830]  Yeah, the terra preda, when they found them, they're just outside of where the cities were from back.
[21:55.830 --> 21:57.670]  I may as well come on up here.
[21:57.950 --> 22:02.590]  Where the cities were, they had their organics, whereas a floodplain.
[22:02.790 --> 22:09.690]  And they have that all built out away from where the cities were, where the terra preda has been found is at the cities.
[22:09.950 --> 22:13.110]  When you consider a city, you have a lot of waste, human waste.
[22:13.450 --> 22:18.010]  That's what they were taking out, throwing into this pit, controlling the odor with charcoal.
[22:18.530 --> 22:21.610]  A thousand years later, we're calling it biochar.
[22:22.410 --> 22:29.130]  Sure, yeah, I guess I didn't know for the odor control, but I knew that basically they're tossing all of their waste products in there.
[22:29.130 --> 22:34.170]  They're fishing waste, they're fishing village, all their food waste from everything that they were growing, their humanure.
[22:34.570 --> 22:41.210]  Yeah, basically, there's all the ash and the char from their fire pits and also their broken terracotta pots.
[22:41.230 --> 22:43.150]  And that's how we discovered bioceramics.
[22:43.150 --> 22:48.790]  But I figured it was more, you know, and I mean, they might have known that it was controlling the odor for sure.
[22:48.910 --> 22:54.550]  But yeah, it's the conglomeration of all that stuff buried into the soil and then left to sit.
[22:54.590 --> 23:00.950]  But I think some of the properties that they've discovered from biochar are definitely worth replicating and doing.
[23:00.950 --> 23:02.750]  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[23:02.790 --> 23:04.670]  I'm not saying I'm not against biochar.
[23:04.670 --> 23:08.270]  I'm just saying 20% is I think is way too much.
[23:08.870 --> 23:10.470]  I don't think the 20% is necessary.
[23:10.490 --> 23:11.970]  I think more like 2% is.
[23:12.010 --> 23:12.370]  OK.
[23:12.730 --> 23:15.810]  Yeah, I've definitely seen recipes with even a 30%.
[23:15.850 --> 23:22.770]  So these are this this should be a very like sprinkle, sprinkle like the salt guy.
[23:22.770 --> 23:28.410]  Right. I mean, it's something, you know, it's barely bringing that shit on there.
[23:28.770 --> 23:33.130]  It's better to add a little bit more in a few months than to just go heavy.
[23:33.170 --> 23:33.970]  Oh, absolutely.
[23:33.970 --> 23:34.890]  Try to figure it out.
[23:35.290 --> 23:35.650]  You know.
[23:37.010 --> 23:38.890]  All right, so, Ken, can you pop back up?
[23:39.390 --> 23:46.750]  We went down a small rabbit hole on the biochar, but there were a lot more things coming up this weekend where they're showing demonstrations in the schedule.
[23:47.830 --> 23:50.270]  So this is day the Saturday schedule.
[23:52.150 --> 24:04.590]  So I would say then Saturday morning, Rachel Gangesana, another, I would say, well-known individual, not only in Colorado, but nationally for her personality and just who she is.
[24:04.590 --> 24:07.930]  So, you know, this is a fantastic pick to to kick things off.
[24:07.930 --> 24:18.550]  And I would imagine you're probably having her like set as place and all of those things that she's well known for when she's doing like her yoga education and those kind of things as well.
[24:19.470 --> 24:20.510]  Yeah, absolutely.
[24:20.510 --> 24:35.870]  So, Brian, you guys earlier were talking about how, you know, we're disconnected from nature and, you know, our nervous system is constantly at threat by the artificial frequencies around us.
[24:35.890 --> 24:39.490]  The electronics, the lighting, the Wi-Fi chemicals.
[24:40.010 --> 24:53.810]  And Rachel, what Rachel talks about and teaches is how to restore that connection with nature using sacred plant medicine as well as mindfulness.
[24:53.810 --> 25:07.190]  And mindfulness is quieting the mind and chatter in our minds and activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the rest and digest.
[25:08.030 --> 25:12.550]  And this is for this is a parasympathetic nervous system.
[25:13.710 --> 25:17.710]  Activating this significantly improves our health and well-being.
[25:18.290 --> 25:28.130]  So we're not constantly in the stress state because when we're in the sympathetic nervous system, that's when diseases manifest.
[25:28.650 --> 25:39.610]  So something interesting she says is that in the parasympathetic nervous system, this is the only time we are able to absorb nutrition from our food.
[25:40.350 --> 25:46.390]  So activating that is critically important, not only for our health, but restoring our connection to nature.
[25:46.390 --> 26:03.150]  And we are just thrilled to have her kicking it off on Saturday with a vermicompost yoga session to activate that parasympathetic nervous system and get it going for the weekend.
[26:03.150 --> 26:06.390]  So super, super excited to have her with us.
[26:06.790 --> 26:07.350]  Absolutely.
[26:08.170 --> 26:17.170]  She's the only other person I've ever like truly geeked out where I could tell like she wasn't just saying it because I was geeking out about worms, composting worms.
[26:17.530 --> 26:21.050]  So that should be a fantastic, you know, well thought out.
[26:21.490 --> 26:25.810]  She takes pride in her the way she delivers her education.
[26:26.170 --> 26:26.670]  For sure.
[26:28.210 --> 26:35.530]  Then after the vermicompost demo, we're going to get into the vermicompost yoga, we're going to get into the compost demo.
[26:36.030 --> 26:40.390]  And so Alexa and I have been teaching basically this three tiered system.
[26:40.830 --> 26:43.950]  And you can choose, you know, any one of these, or you can do all of them.
[26:43.950 --> 26:45.670]  You can do any combination pretty much.
[26:46.070 --> 26:53.670]  But this is how we've found, you know, to make the best compost and how to compost like all of your food waste and not send anything to the landfill.
[26:54.150 --> 26:56.910]  And so Alexa, do you want to talk about the three tiered system?
[26:56.910 --> 26:58.030]  Yeah, absolutely.
[26:58.050 --> 27:09.930]  So, um, like I posted on my stories yesterday, I have been experimenting throughout the years with different ways to compost all my food scraps at home.
[27:09.970 --> 27:21.170]  And I've come up with a three step system that seems to be the easiest and most effective way to produce biologically diverse compost at home.
[27:21.170 --> 27:32.110]  And I just want to say this does not really produce a high quantity of compost, but you are getting a very high quality of compost.
[27:32.110 --> 27:38.550]  So basically, the three step system is first to bokashi compost.
[27:38.550 --> 27:54.490]  And after that process, I put that bokashi compost into a cold compost or a static pile outdoors and let that sit until it's decomposed a little bit more.
[27:54.490 --> 28:07.610]  And then after a few months of letting it sit outside, that's when I'll add it to step three, which is the worm bin and let the worms and other organisms within the worm bin finish the job.
[28:07.750 --> 28:12.390]  And kind of from there, like I said, it's not going to produce a large quantity.
[28:13.130 --> 28:19.870]  So this is maybe not something you would do if you were looking to spread compost out on your land.
[28:19.870 --> 28:28.030]  But if you're looking to make teas with a very high quality, biologically diverse compost, this is the way to do it.
[28:29.030 --> 28:38.250]  It's also you can also stop at any point, like Chandler was saying earlier, you could just bokashi compost and throw that outside or bury it.
[28:38.250 --> 28:42.250]  There's many different things you can do with your bokashi compost.
[28:43.150 --> 28:48.730]  So, again, we just give you the template and you color it and you make it your own.
[28:49.290 --> 28:52.650]  We're just giving you ideas and what has worked for us.
[28:53.470 --> 29:05.390]  Perfect. And that does work, Alexa, I'll tell you, because I've done something similar, but in my step three, I went to a black soldier fly bin and just kind of ran it through there.
[29:05.750 --> 29:13.310]  And but the worm bin is crucial because, you know, you know, there's a lot of talk about black soldier fly versus worm bin.
[29:13.310 --> 29:15.510]  But to me, they're talking apples and oranges.
[29:15.510 --> 29:16.550]  You know, it's a little bit different.
[29:16.790 --> 29:22.290]  Worm bin, you're going to get a much more diverse, complex microbiology that you guys all agree.
[29:22.650 --> 29:29.710]  And then black soldier fly kind of give it more seems like a lot more bacteria based coming out of that.
[29:31.230 --> 29:39.830]  Yeah, higher frass levels and chitin and all that to put in there, Marco, which does seem like that's kind of the catalyst to help.
[29:40.070 --> 29:46.190]  Yes, you need the carbon, but let's let's kind of get in more of the frasses, the poops, the manures seem to be.
[29:47.070 --> 29:49.230]  That's why we always play around with the lion head rapids.
[29:49.370 --> 29:52.090]  I mean, it's just one day I hope.
[29:52.130 --> 30:02.170]  I don't know, Mike, you know, with the land that you have, have you played around with any alpacas or anything fun like that where you just let them run wild like, you know, a couple of them see what happens over the years?
[30:02.490 --> 30:03.530]  I mean, I would love to.
[30:04.250 --> 30:05.530]  I really enjoy alpacas.
[30:05.530 --> 30:06.510]  I think they're pretty awesome.
[30:06.510 --> 30:08.650]  And their poop is amazing.
[30:08.650 --> 30:12.610]  Obviously, anyone who owns an alpaca, they'll talk to you all day about it.
[30:12.610 --> 30:13.470]  And for good reason.
[30:13.470 --> 30:14.930]  I mean, it's it's some good stuff.
[30:15.610 --> 30:17.930]  We've never had alpacas, but chickens we had.
[30:17.930 --> 30:21.830]  We had about 160 chickens on the property like five years ago.
[30:22.550 --> 30:25.430]  That was before we were kind of taken off for long periods to Hawaii.
[30:25.790 --> 30:28.630]  But now we're going like six months at a time to Hawaii.
[30:28.630 --> 30:31.190]  So animal husbandry is kind of out right now.
[30:31.590 --> 30:33.990]  We're trying to figure out ways to get back into it.
[30:34.830 --> 30:42.590]  We did bring four chickens on the farm this summer to help deal with the grasshopper and ant problem in our cannabis greenhouse.
[30:42.590 --> 30:44.830]  We have like 48 plants under the caregiver system.
[30:45.330 --> 30:48.730]  Yeah, we're having some problems there, but the chickens, they helped out big time.
[30:49.690 --> 30:52.610]  But yeah, I definitely would love some alpacas someday.
[30:52.610 --> 30:54.370]  And that's a that's a good one.
[30:55.130 --> 30:58.370]  Yeah, we always try to say like chickens solve a lot of problems.
[30:58.370 --> 30:59.830]  You know, they're they're pooping.
[30:59.830 --> 31:06.250]  They're they're not as obviously as intelligent as like an alpaca or some other animals, but they still have a purpose.
[31:06.250 --> 31:12.170]  And for what they're doing, I think they're deadly accurate and killing the especially the grasshoppers.
[31:12.570 --> 31:13.250]  Oh, yeah, man.
[31:13.790 --> 31:14.550]  I love chickens.
[31:15.470 --> 31:15.990]  They're great.
[31:15.990 --> 31:20.030]  And we work on have a little bit of a desert problem in our greenhouses.
[31:20.870 --> 31:25.590]  This is a commercial production for a long time, and they didn't really grow in the ground.
[31:25.590 --> 31:26.790]  They grew in pots and whatnot.
[31:26.790 --> 31:33.470]  So it's like black fabric, black fabric on the ground, basically felt and we're pretty low budget operation.
[31:33.470 --> 31:35.670]  And we really believe in in the biology.
[31:35.670 --> 31:40.470]  So we've just been putting basically organic material microbes out to solve the problem.
[31:40.470 --> 31:42.550]  And the chickens were a big part of that.
[31:43.310 --> 31:48.950]  Our small greenhouse was pretty much, you know, not usable.
[31:48.950 --> 31:51.670]  And then after the chickens, we had them there all winter.
[31:51.830 --> 31:57.150]  So anyone has a greenhouse and lives in a cold climate has chickens and you need to charge up your greenhouse, man.
[31:57.150 --> 32:01.030]  Put your chickens in the in the greenhouse for the winter does wonders.
[32:01.030 --> 32:03.510]  But yeah, so that really helps us out.
[32:03.510 --> 32:05.470]  The next growing growing season was amazing.
[32:06.590 --> 32:10.630]  So I got to give you a gold bar on that one, man.
[32:10.650 --> 32:17.610]  It seems like chickens do like they balance things out because they know they don't let any of the bugs and insects, anything get out of balance.
[32:17.850 --> 32:22.410]  And to put them in the greenhouse, that sounds like that's next level right there.
[32:22.410 --> 32:23.290]  It's a great idea.
[32:23.730 --> 32:24.250]  Thanks, man.
[32:26.090 --> 32:32.250]  I'm excited, Sean, from Rising Moon Medicinals, Dempier Farm here in Michigan, is going to be teaching chicken composting.
[32:32.450 --> 32:33.850]  And so that's all he does.
[32:33.850 --> 32:38.050]  You know, it's like he's got enough things on his plate, doesn't want to deal with the three tier system.
[32:38.590 --> 32:44.790]  He's got some chickens, you know, feed them all the food scrap, mix all that stuff in with some forest stuff and wood chips and everything.
[32:44.790 --> 32:47.950]  And he makes a really good compost with very minimal work.
[32:47.950 --> 32:56.750]  You know, it's not the same, you know, end product as what you get passing it through the worms, you know, but it is a really valuable compost, no doubt.
[32:57.310 --> 33:00.550]  And it's all about using doing what you can do, you know, right.
[33:00.550 --> 33:01.670]  Doing what works for you.
[33:01.670 --> 33:03.950]  If you do, you'd rather do something than nothing.
[33:03.950 --> 33:06.830]  So whatever works best, I always encourage people to do it.
[33:08.110 --> 33:08.910]  It's a lot of stuff.
[33:09.310 --> 33:09.710]  For sure.
[33:10.190 --> 33:10.430]  All right.
[33:10.430 --> 33:12.310]  So what else did we have on on Saturday?
[33:12.870 --> 33:18.430]  I wanted to make sure everybody sees our tickets still available if people are watching this and want to kind of like last minute.
[33:18.590 --> 33:19.270]  Yeah, for sure.
[33:19.270 --> 33:21.430]  You can come pick cash at the door if you want.
[33:21.910 --> 33:22.350]  Right on.
[33:22.870 --> 33:24.350]  Or Venmo or PayPal, whatever.
[33:24.350 --> 33:25.750]  Yeah, tickets are available at the door.
[33:26.950 --> 33:37.990]  So this this to me when I was researching for the show today, this was one of the classes that stood out for me and trying to learn more about new frontier kind of things that just allow you to then take that
[33:38.010 --> 33:42.450]  information and go back on your own own time and go down your own rabbit holes.
[33:42.970 --> 33:43.930]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:44.570 --> 33:49.890]  The mushroom walk is a blast every year, and hopefully we can get some rains this week or something.
[33:49.890 --> 33:55.010]  I know Mike was saying it's dry up there, but we went there last weekend and we're finding some mushrooms.
[33:55.050 --> 33:58.290]  But yeah, we were blessed with a nice rain.
[33:58.290 --> 34:03.330]  I know we'd find a lot more, but there's definitely all sorts of medicinal mushrooms and plants out there.
[34:03.330 --> 34:13.990]  And we have so many talented mycologists and herbalists and foragers and everybody that can teach a class and so many eyes out there looking through the woods.
[34:13.990 --> 34:15.110]  You're bound to find something good.
[34:15.110 --> 34:20.550]  And having that group together out there, you're bound to teach something that somebody else didn't know.
[34:20.550 --> 34:27.830]  So it's always a good time to just get out there and split into a couple of different groups and try to identify some plants and mushrooms.
[34:28.730 --> 34:36.410]  Yeah, that's one of those things that can actually help you in an apocalypse or whatever to be able to identify food.
[34:36.410 --> 34:37.570]  You know, that's very valuable.
[34:37.570 --> 34:43.410]  So I mean, these are some great tools you guys that they're equipping you guys with.
[34:43.410 --> 34:45.770]  If you can make it out there, man, this is going to be wonderful.
[34:46.250 --> 34:46.770]  Thank you.
[34:46.770 --> 34:52.450]  And so, like, also when we're out there scoping in the woods, like we're looking for IMO and we're looking for everything.
[34:52.450 --> 34:55.650]  So I don't ever go out to the woods, you know, just looking for one thing.
[34:55.950 --> 34:58.390]  It's just like, what can I observe?
[34:58.390 --> 34:59.270]  What can I take in?
[34:59.670 --> 35:00.430]  What can I find?
[35:00.430 --> 35:02.550]  And like, you're always going to find something cool.
[35:02.910 --> 35:12.550]  And so, yeah, it's a finding survival food, but also it could be finding, you know, sourcing inputs that you can use to ferment and feed to your plants or to yourself.
[35:12.550 --> 35:13.710]  And it's a.
[35:13.710 --> 35:14.030]  Yeah.
[35:15.190 --> 35:15.910]  It's nice.
[35:16.430 --> 35:17.870]  So this is an epic weekend.
[35:17.870 --> 35:19.910]  You guys are charging fifteen hundred bucks, right?
[35:20.270 --> 35:20.750]  Yeah.
[35:20.750 --> 35:21.070]  Yeah.
[35:21.190 --> 35:24.150]  You know, what are you really charging?
[35:24.170 --> 35:27.850]  Because I know that some people are used to that price point where they might not even realize we're kidding.
[35:28.410 --> 35:29.610]  Man, it's insane.
[35:30.130 --> 35:33.130]  We're charging thirty dollars and just basically giving it away.
[35:33.250 --> 35:34.970]  You know, I love that.
[35:34.970 --> 35:36.290]  It gives me chill bumps.
[35:36.290 --> 35:38.570]  We always talk about dollars or less on anything.
[35:39.090 --> 35:39.630]  I got chill.
[35:40.250 --> 35:51.810]  That is exactly where and that's why I was saying I hope and we wanted to reach out to you guys because for this platform that you guys would be the torch to try to get the community to meet up at least once a year with the.
[35:52.670 --> 36:02.750]  The the real genuineness behind it is carried through all weekend, and I know that you guys will will carry that through, and that's why we're just excited to have you on the show.
[36:02.750 --> 36:06.070]  I mean, this is something where it's like, yeah, you know, we digital is great.
[36:06.270 --> 36:07.630]  We all get to talk weekly.
[36:07.630 --> 36:16.230]  But man, to be able to just link up and just kind of share this, you know, when I'm linked up with Marco, like just to be able to like have a meal with them and talk with them.
[36:16.230 --> 36:19.830]  And there's just something different about that.
[36:19.830 --> 36:26.850]  Like, you know, when you go out and you actually have the face to face type stuff, there's just no one does that anymore.
[36:26.850 --> 36:29.010]  So there's just extra value to that.
[36:29.010 --> 36:32.890]  And that was something when that's why I was teasing, you know, fifteen hundred dollars.
[36:32.970 --> 36:35.810]  A lot of people would probably think that was a fantastic weekend.
[36:35.810 --> 36:41.850]  So for thirty dollars again, I mean, how how can you not go to this, especially if you live in the Michigan?
[36:41.970 --> 36:47.330]  I mean, that's the price of an eight hour drive, whatever it is, you know, thirty bucks.
[36:48.270 --> 36:50.030]  And, you know, guys, thirty bucks.
[36:50.030 --> 36:50.830]  But you know what?
[36:50.870 --> 37:04.870]  Like like I always say, give a little, take a little, give a little more, man, if you leave that thing and you know you got that value, give them a little more, you know, drop ask where, you know, where can I donate some extra to or whatever, you know, everything can help.
[37:04.870 --> 37:06.710]  And thirty dollars is very low, man.
[37:06.710 --> 37:09.190]  So you guys feel like you got more value.
[37:09.510 --> 37:15.990]  Give it back a little bit, too, you know, because knowledge and education, that's something that once you leave there, no one could ever take it from you.
[37:16.010 --> 37:18.290]  Like you can take a lot of things from you in your life.
[37:18.690 --> 37:19.890]  They can't take that back.
[37:19.890 --> 37:22.210]  So, yeah, definitely, man.
[37:22.210 --> 37:24.730]  I'm definitely locking that in for next year.
[37:24.730 --> 37:25.930]  It's going to be a good time.
[37:25.930 --> 37:27.890]  And and that's next weekend.
[37:27.890 --> 37:30.290]  So if you can make it up to Michigan, get on out there.
[37:30.290 --> 37:31.050]  It's going to be good.
[37:31.170 --> 37:31.810]  Good stuff.
[37:32.690 --> 37:33.010]  Thank you.
[37:34.490 --> 37:35.250]  Thank you.
[37:35.450 --> 37:40.450]  And sharing abundance is also something we want to highlight this weekend.
[37:40.630 --> 37:55.590]  We have a giving tree and we are encouraging people to bring whatever is special to them, handmade, homegrown goods to share with the giving tree.
[37:55.910 --> 38:07.990]  And we encourage you to bring your abundance and inputs and everything to share, because we truly believe that the more we give, the more we receive.
[38:08.890 --> 38:11.050]  So that's a proven fact.
[38:11.050 --> 38:12.090]  I love it.
[38:12.090 --> 38:12.810]  It happens.
[38:12.810 --> 38:13.450]  It's true.
[38:14.850 --> 38:30.690]  Yeah, it sounds like such metaphysical type until you're living it, until you're like at some place in life or you go to a special show or something and you meet that one last little puzzle piece, you know, or you link up with an individual.
[38:30.930 --> 38:35.450]  And I think the universe rewards you with that kind of stuff when you put in the work.
[38:36.390 --> 38:40.870]  The flip side of that is I think sometimes think they can just sit at their house all day and wish for things.
[38:40.870 --> 38:42.150]  It doesn't work like that.
[38:42.150 --> 38:45.190]  You got to put in the time and the effort and you have to give back.
[38:45.190 --> 38:47.910]  You have to have information to give to the community as well.
[38:47.910 --> 38:55.070]  And that's something else that I hope that we see a lot more of is not people just taking from an event, but actually giving back.
[38:55.070 --> 39:10.010]  So the fact that you brought that up, Alexa, again, is I mean, please be the shining beacon for the community, because that's the kind of stuff that that needs to be there so that everybody realizes what the point of the weekend is each and every day that they're there.
[39:10.970 --> 39:13.130]  100 percent, Brian, 100 percent.
[39:13.410 --> 39:13.730]  All right.
[39:13.730 --> 39:14.930]  So what's up next?
[39:15.170 --> 39:17.490]  And just another note on that giving tree.
[39:18.730 --> 39:23.890]  You know, we're going to have an altar there and we've already started it, but we want everybody to come contribute to that.
[39:23.990 --> 39:26.550]  So it's more than just giving to each other.
[39:26.630 --> 39:42.150]  You know, you can leave a bottle of tincture and take something, but also you can bring some stuff to give to this altar and to give back to the land spirits or the indigenous microorganisms, the elders of the land, whatever you want to call it.
[39:42.150 --> 39:43.050]  But basically, like.
[39:44.130 --> 40:06.810]  You're going to realize when you go out to the woods, like even though there's there's other people there, there's like other beings there as well, like the woods are absolutely alive and so we can pay our respect to these microorganisms, to these spirits that are there on the land by, you know, giving to this altar, giving our respect, giving our intentions and making this like a sacred space.
[40:06.830 --> 40:16.590]  And so basically I'm going to post a video tomorrow when I go up there, but we have this really special altar space and it's set up in a compass.
[40:16.590 --> 40:25.230]  And so you got north, south, east, west and on the north side, it's going to be dedicated to the air, to the sky.
[40:25.270 --> 40:30.990]  And so we want you, you can go find stuff in the woods while you're up there or you can bring stuff from home, whatever you want.
[40:31.010 --> 40:34.330]  But anything that resembles the sky, bring that.
[40:34.330 --> 40:36.210]  So all like feathers that you find.
[40:36.930 --> 40:40.130]  I just found a beehive the other day, things like that.
[40:40.210 --> 40:46.330]  And so put that in this and we're going to make like a mandala and, you know, bless that land.
[40:46.450 --> 40:50.450]  And so we're asking people to put this intention, this energy into the land.
[40:50.930 --> 40:55.450]  And so they're going to want to come back year after year and check on it, especially things with like the Hugel culture.
[40:55.450 --> 40:58.090]  Like you're putting your time and your energy into this.
[40:58.270 --> 41:03.550]  It's not just, you know, what you can take, it's what you can give back.
[41:03.550 --> 41:08.830]  And I'm like, that's just going to encourage people to come check on that year after year and all this cool stuff.
[41:08.830 --> 41:11.350]  And we'll explain it all better then.
[41:11.350 --> 41:14.550]  But so east is going to be the forest.
[41:14.550 --> 41:18.190]  So any artifacts or anything that you find from the forest, come put it there.
[41:18.510 --> 41:20.230]  South is going to represent the soil.
[41:20.430 --> 41:24.590]  So anything that you've grown, anything that comes from the soil, you can come put it in the mandala there.
[41:25.090 --> 41:30.490]  And so I'm bringing like my glass gem corn, which is crazy colorful and some gourds and stuff.
[41:31.010 --> 41:34.970]  And then the west side is going to represent the lake.
[41:35.050 --> 41:37.130]  We're really close to Lake Michigan over there.
[41:37.490 --> 41:42.450]  And so you can bring seashells, rocks and driftwood, things that you find there.
[41:42.450 --> 41:47.530]  And so just a little heads up, if any of that, you know, sounds good to you.
[41:47.610 --> 41:50.090]  I know it doesn't sound good to everybody and that's okay.
[41:50.170 --> 41:51.970]  But some people are really into that stuff.
[41:52.070 --> 41:56.110]  And, you know, it's giving back to the land.
[41:56.110 --> 41:57.270]  It's an intentional event.
[41:58.310 --> 41:59.430]  Thank you, Chandler.
[41:59.430 --> 42:00.750]  That's fantastic, man.
[42:00.750 --> 42:01.250]  I love it.
[42:02.070 --> 42:03.990]  Yeah, I like to do things like, oh, sorry.
[42:03.990 --> 42:04.590]  Go ahead, Alexa.
[42:04.590 --> 42:04.870]  Yes.
[42:05.510 --> 42:15.990]  Oh, I just wanted to add that composting, just the act of composting is a way to get back to the land and stop extracting from it.
[42:16.690 --> 42:20.810]  Because when we're composting, we're honoring the law of return.
[42:20.810 --> 42:22.570]  We're honoring nature cycles.
[42:23.170 --> 42:39.930]  We're remembering that we are a part of a greater whole and we're taking responsibility for this one earth community and recognizing that each action can create a healthier future for everyone.
[42:40.290 --> 42:42.890]  So that's a big theme for this weekend as well.
[42:43.390 --> 42:49.630]  Do you guys, when you go out foraging, because when I go out foraging, I'll bring a little bag of IMO3 or something.
[42:50.110 --> 42:52.230]  And even though it's just me, I do it.
[42:52.230 --> 42:54.190]  I throw it out, sprinkle it out as I walk.
[42:54.190 --> 42:56.070]  I collect some things and take them out.
[42:57.030 --> 42:58.630]  What do you guys think?
[42:58.630 --> 42:59.830]  You ever do that?
[42:59.830 --> 43:01.750]  And then what do you think is like a fair trade?
[43:01.750 --> 43:06.910]  You know, if I go out and collect 10 mushrooms, you know, what would be a good give back?
[43:06.910 --> 43:08.710]  Or do you even look at it that way?
[43:09.470 --> 43:10.070]  No, for sure.
[43:10.070 --> 43:11.110]  I definitely do that.
[43:11.130 --> 43:18.730]  And one, I always take like an extra bag with me and I don't, or I use that for trash, you know, like it could be as simple as that, you know, picking up things that don't belong there.
[43:18.730 --> 43:26.850]  It could be singing and honoring these plants, you know, putting out your good energy and sharing that with these plants.
[43:26.850 --> 43:37.130]  You know, if you can identify as an oak tree, say, you know, I see you oak tree, recognize that other being and you know, that other being is going to appreciate that.
[43:37.630 --> 43:43.590]  And so, and it could be as simple as you got to relieve yourself on the woods.
[43:43.590 --> 43:51.150]  You go find a tree that maybe needs it or a grandmother tree, you know, and go pee on that, you know, and put your intentions into it while you're doing it.
[43:51.230 --> 43:54.030]  And like, that's adding nutrients back into the cycle.
[43:54.030 --> 43:56.630]  And like, we're all so interconnected.
[43:57.630 --> 44:06.310]  But what's another, so I've thought about this with the compost that I make and there's so many worm cocoons and worms in there and everything.
[44:06.730 --> 44:15.930]  And if I'm out in the old growth forest here in Michigan, where there's no worms natively anymore, the ice age wiped them out from up here.
[44:15.930 --> 44:20.330]  And so like, there's still some old growth forests here in Michigan that don't have worm populations.
[44:20.730 --> 44:32.130]  So if I'm adding that compost, I could be adding an invasive species, you know, so like you do want to be cautious about your source of the compost and using the IMO as a great solution to that.
[44:32.130 --> 44:37.190]  Not having any worms in there, but absolutely giving stuff back to the soil.
[44:37.190 --> 44:42.750]  And if you collect, you take IMO and you pull the leaves back, you know, you got to cover that bear patch back up.
[44:43.270 --> 44:44.910]  We don't want to be extracting anything.
[44:45.310 --> 44:48.030]  We always want to leave the woods cleaner than we found it.
[44:48.510 --> 44:50.710]  We, you know, all that stuff.
[44:52.750 --> 44:53.250]  Yeah.
[44:54.470 --> 44:54.970]  Yeah.
[44:55.550 --> 44:59.550]  When we spend time in Hawaii, my wife is in a hula hula.
[45:00.430 --> 45:04.750]  So they're constantly practicing cultural, you know, things.
[45:04.790 --> 45:06.910]  And one of them is to always give an offer.
[45:06.910 --> 45:10.950]  Anytime you do work in the woods, anytime you go out and harvest something.
[45:10.950 --> 45:13.910]  So typically they use like a native plant species.
[45:15.190 --> 45:24.830]  You know, I don't think that has to be a rule per se here in Michigan, but, you know, just to shed some insight on that whole process that they've been practicing for, you know, forever.
[45:25.190 --> 45:33.550]  You know, and shout out to them for that too, because, you know, that's what we're talking here in the new age and that they've been practicing that for, you know, thousands of years.
[45:33.550 --> 45:35.350]  So, yeah.
[45:36.230 --> 45:37.070]  Thought I'd add that.
[45:37.630 --> 45:37.870]  Yeah.
[45:37.870 --> 45:42.150]  I like that as far as a plant, you know, bringing a plant, actually, that's a great gift as well.
[45:42.150 --> 45:48.830]  If it's native to that area, like around here, we do a lot of, and up there, I'm sure pawpaws, you know, it's pawpaw season.
[45:49.510 --> 45:51.510]  And shout out to Permaculture Ninja.
[45:51.510 --> 46:00.570]  We'll be heading up to Pawpaw Fest later this month, but pawpaw is a wonderful gift tree, you know, in our area and to give to someone.
[46:01.090 --> 46:08.730]  Dogwoods, you know, we all say things like, if you live in Virginia, you should have a dogwood in your yard or on your property, you know, things like that.
[46:08.730 --> 46:10.690]  Keeping it native, that's always a great idea.
[46:10.690 --> 46:11.490]  So, yeah.
[46:11.490 --> 46:12.970]  Great, great idea with that, Mike.
[46:14.850 --> 46:17.530]  I have one more thing to add.
[46:17.850 --> 46:21.150]  I think intention has a lot to do with it too.
[46:21.170 --> 46:41.090]  So when I'm harvesting like leaf mold or different things for inputs that I'm making or compost, I always have the intention that I'm going to use those microorganisms for the good.
[46:41.210 --> 46:48.210]  So I'm going to spread them and improve land that has been degraded through human activities.
[46:48.550 --> 46:54.510]  So in a sense, it's like go and spread your power.
[46:54.510 --> 47:04.590]  When you toss out that IMO3, I'm like I'm spreading my seeds out there, you know, of IMO to build what that soil, every piece that they touch and spread on through there.
[47:04.950 --> 47:08.270]  Yeah, absolutely.
[47:08.890 --> 47:19.770]  Because like Chandler was saying before, microbes, they have been through everything, all the beings on that land.
[47:19.770 --> 47:26.130]  So they hold the genetic memory of everything that has ever been there.
[47:28.090 --> 47:28.930]  Yeah, that's big.
[47:28.930 --> 47:36.530]  That's something that we don't really think about, because if you think over the millions of years, the microbes are the one thing that doesn't change.
[47:36.790 --> 47:41.430]  Even when it goes through animals, digest comes out, it's still the same.
[47:41.430 --> 47:42.470]  And that's the one thing.
[47:42.470 --> 47:46.910]  So imprinting that DNA on that land, wow, that's amazing.
[47:46.910 --> 47:55.630]  It creates these feedback loops on that land, where they go through the digestive system, through the compost, through the grass as an endophyte and completes the cycle.
[47:55.630 --> 47:58.310]  And like those microbes have been there forever.
[47:58.310 --> 48:01.670]  They've teamed with every human, every plant, every animal, like she's saying.
[48:01.670 --> 48:03.830]  And oh boy.
[48:04.330 --> 48:07.130]  Yeah, that's a deep hole right there, man.
[48:07.730 --> 48:08.130]  Yeah.
[48:08.730 --> 48:18.330]  So like honoring that and realizing that if we want to be thriving in our own environment, we need to be teaming with these indigenous microbes that are specific to that land.
[48:18.570 --> 48:20.650]  And like us humans are new on the scene.
[48:20.690 --> 48:22.610]  You know, like we've only been around so long.
[48:22.890 --> 48:27.370]  But these plants and these microbes, like they're so much more evolved than us.
[48:27.370 --> 48:28.650]  They have so many more genes than us.
[48:28.650 --> 48:30.130]  They've been around so much longer.
[48:30.430 --> 48:37.990]  And so we can learn so much from looking to them and taking their energy and teaming with them and co-evolving and co-creating.
[48:37.990 --> 48:40.430]  You know, and like we are not the only creators here.
[48:40.430 --> 48:53.470]  And so when we can team up with that and see things grand scheme and also like everybody else that's ever been on that land, who's ever farmed, who's ever cared for it like us.
[48:53.470 --> 48:57.850]  You know, I'd like to think that their spirit still remains there and we can team with them.
[48:57.890 --> 49:01.130]  And like there's so much cool stuff, man.
[49:01.570 --> 49:02.450]  That's amazing.
[49:04.090 --> 49:06.610]  Have you ever heard of a guy named Soma?
[49:08.170 --> 49:08.530]  Mike.
[49:09.970 --> 49:10.450]  What's that?
[49:10.810 --> 49:14.650]  Soma, S-O-M-A, I believe it was out in Hawaii.
[49:15.330 --> 49:15.930]  No, I haven't.
[49:16.930 --> 49:19.890]  No, I haven't met that person or I haven't heard that name either.
[49:20.650 --> 49:23.330]  Is that the gentleman on conch here, Marayan?
[49:23.770 --> 49:25.690]  Are you thinking the Swami soldier?
[49:26.290 --> 49:27.090]  No, no, no.
[49:27.370 --> 49:29.010]  OK, I know this.
[49:29.290 --> 49:37.810]  Well, I know of this individual and I think he's only been on like a podcast once or twice as far as I understand, never shown his face.
[49:38.410 --> 49:41.930]  But he was kind of talking about the things that we're talking about today.
[49:41.950 --> 49:43.990]  This was maybe, you know, 10 years ago.
[49:44.530 --> 50:03.610]  And he was he was discussing that in Hawaii, he felt like when he would grow cannabis plants like, you know, as a perpetual harvest, that he started to notice that the you know, the future generations as they would start to grow up, like their roots would be like, hey, this is other cannabis has been grown here before.
[50:03.790 --> 50:05.590]  So the plant would like kind of relax.
[50:05.590 --> 50:07.670]  There'd be a lot of less stress and all this.
[50:07.670 --> 50:14.390]  And especially when he was saying that, I think a lot of people dismiss what he was saying because it sounded too woo woo, especially back then.
[50:14.910 --> 50:20.790]  But I wish I could maybe I'll have to go back and try to find that because I thought that was gold bars so long ago.
[50:21.350 --> 50:27.350]  Whereas like, you know, if the cannabis plant is relaxed, it seems like she has everything that she needs.
[50:27.350 --> 50:34.130]  She gets those praying leaves and then you're off to the races on the overall health and quality of what you can actually produce.
[50:34.530 --> 50:36.690]  And that all comes from that microbial world.
[50:37.370 --> 50:43.490]  And Michael, I think I noticed, you know, you're laying, I guess, because there's so many different viewpoints.
[50:43.490 --> 50:47.250]  But like your vision is more from like a Dr.
[50:47.250 --> 50:49.970]  Lane. I saw you were saying like the soil food web.
[50:50.410 --> 50:54.170]  So you believe in like having all of the diversity.
[50:54.790 --> 51:04.230]  That's what constitutes like a living soil, not just cocoa with some microbes or so many people define a living soil.
[51:05.070 --> 51:09.430]  I wish there was like one true like this is a living soil because it has.
[51:09.630 --> 51:14.150]  And in my opinion, it would be like because it follows more of like a soil food web.
[51:14.750 --> 51:15.910]  Yeah. Yeah.
[51:15.910 --> 51:19.990]  I mean, definitely. I'm in a consulting program with Dr.
[51:19.990 --> 51:21.470]  Lane, the soil food web.
[51:21.470 --> 51:23.070]  You know, I'm trying to finish that process.
[51:23.890 --> 51:26.690]  My mentor is listening. Shout out to her for being so patient with me.
[51:26.770 --> 51:30.970]  I had a new baby come into the world a couple of months ago and building the house and stuff.
[51:30.970 --> 51:32.450]  So just crazy.
[51:33.770 --> 51:45.330]  Thank you. But yeah, I actually started learning the K&F world, you know, so when I got into natural farming and the microbe world is pretty much, you know, let's make some recipes.
[51:45.330 --> 51:48.770]  And I don't really understand why they work other than the microbes rule.
[51:48.810 --> 51:51.050]  And then it works and I'm happy.
[51:51.990 --> 51:54.950]  But then after a while, I kind of just wanted to dig deeper.
[51:54.950 --> 52:06.550]  And my real passion is to work with large scale agriculture and try to convert some of these huge conventional farms into a regenerative practices and make their own compost.
[52:07.550 --> 52:14.390]  So, yeah. So I just decided to take the foundational courses and then move on into the consulting program.
[52:14.410 --> 52:22.930]  So, yeah, I think, you know, back to the definition thing, you know, in the class, they do, you know, they do give a definition.
[52:23.650 --> 52:31.850]  But, you know, organic material and microbes really for me is pretty much, you know, that's what living soil is, you know.
[52:31.850 --> 52:37.410]  So if you don't have anything for the microbes to eat and live on, you know, you're not going to have microbes.
[52:37.490 --> 52:43.130]  And if you don't have all the microbes you possibly can get, you're probably at a deficit.
[52:43.550 --> 52:46.270]  So I think, you know, like the shirt says, it's all about the biology.
[52:46.270 --> 52:48.470]  It's all about the diversity of the biology.
[52:49.430 --> 52:53.150]  So and it also can depend on your goal and what you're growing.
[52:53.870 --> 52:57.790]  So it's very nuanced, you know, and we'll get into some of the deeper stuff at the event, too.
[52:57.830 --> 53:06.030]  But, you know, it depends on your goal, on what the conversation of living soil means and compost means to you.
[53:06.310 --> 53:12.750]  But if we're talking about growing plants the best they can and high level agriculture, there's some specifics you want to get into, you know.
[53:13.190 --> 53:13.510]  But.
[53:14.550 --> 53:29.630]  And Michael, so what kind of things just in general, you know, like if someone has kind of a farm or medium size or whatever size farm and they're saying, listen, I want to get into doing it the natural way, you know, how would you tell them what would be your first step?
[53:29.630 --> 53:31.030]  Like, all right, here's step one.
[53:31.030 --> 53:35.150]  Let's kind of start them with a general path so they can kind of go that direction.
[53:36.050 --> 53:43.450]  I think, you know, I should my correct answer should be that I'm going to follow the class when I finish the class, I'll have a better understanding of that.
[53:43.450 --> 53:49.290]  But at this point, you know, right now, I think making microbes is the most important thing.
[53:49.290 --> 53:52.450]  And I think it also depends on how fast you need to accomplish that.
[53:52.770 --> 53:59.210]  You know, if you can wait a couple of years, you know, making some big static piles, let them sit, letting the worms chew through them, that's going to be your best bet.
[53:59.210 --> 54:02.170]  But if you need to go tomorrow, you might need to use K&S.
[54:02.190 --> 54:10.790]  You might have to go out and collect some microbes, make an IMO 3 pile and have something you can put on your plant in two weeks, you know, three weeks.
[54:10.790 --> 54:20.350]  So, you know, I think depending what your goal is, you know, and how fast you got to go, you know, but microbes are going to be your first step.
[54:20.430 --> 54:22.790]  You got to get microbes. You got to get organic material.
[54:23.590 --> 54:29.230]  You know, on our farm, we have some sandy soil, like these desert soils I was talking about.
[54:29.410 --> 54:34.250]  First thing we did is put out a bunch of wood chips and, you know, that's food.
[54:34.370 --> 54:36.330]  That's a home for microbes.
[54:36.650 --> 54:43.050]  And then I'm constantly putting compost teas, IMO 3s, IMO 4s, top dressing on that.
[54:43.050 --> 54:48.370]  So those are the things that I would talk to a farmer about, you know, right away.
[54:48.370 --> 54:52.890]  It's about the microbes and the organic material because everyone's got minerals, you know.
[54:53.610 --> 54:59.090]  Some minerals or some mineral soils are better than others, as we know, like clay and loam and whatnot.
[54:59.110 --> 55:00.670]  But, you know, everyone's got the minerals.
[55:00.670 --> 55:02.910]  They need the organic material and the microbes.
[55:03.310 --> 55:07.990]  And then you can get into the compost tea world, which would really take it to the next level.
[55:09.190 --> 55:12.750]  So those are the things we'd be talking about.
[55:13.830 --> 55:15.830]  I guess I'm kind of getting a little lost here, but.
[55:16.030 --> 55:17.190]  No, no, it makes sense.
[55:17.190 --> 55:18.750]  You're right there. It makes sense.
[55:18.750 --> 55:20.790]  Build that soil, build that biology.
[55:21.190 --> 55:24.870]  Alexa or Jethouse, y'all got anything to add on that same line?
[55:25.610 --> 55:34.050]  Like as far as, you know, that farmer that wants to switch to the natural farming way or, you know, kind of the first steps you would recommend.
[55:34.050 --> 55:40.290]  Kind of you agree with Michael and I agree too, biology, you know, and then adding the microbes to the soil.
[55:42.650 --> 55:45.250]  I completely agree with that.
[55:46.770 --> 55:54.530]  Biology and organic matter, some of the two things that are missing from the soil, but soil is multidimensional.
[55:54.530 --> 56:01.390]  So, you know, we have to think not only about the microbes, we have to think about organic matter.
[56:01.390 --> 56:04.110]  We have to think about the soil chemistry.
[56:05.670 --> 56:14.110]  All these different parts come into play to create the energy that's needed for plant growth.
[56:14.610 --> 56:35.970]  So for someone who is looking to transition their land, just like Mike said, it's all about their situation and their goals, because each one is going to be so unique in the way that you go about building a living soil.
[56:37.890 --> 56:39.090]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[56:39.090 --> 56:44.350]  One thing for my particular farm, I didn't have to grow food to eat right away.
[56:44.350 --> 56:46.910]  I know that's a long goal of mine there.
[56:47.190 --> 56:58.890]  But what I did was I just started loading up with wood chips, like most people say, you know, find that tree, that arborist or whoever's doing trees in the area, start getting the chips and start building up that soil.
[56:59.310 --> 57:12.990]  And then now, you know, when I first laid out chips, you know, four to six inches deep, you know, now, you know, two, three years later, it's grass has grown back on some of those areas and you don't even know that there was ever chips that deep there.
[57:13.230 --> 57:15.110]  But underneath the soil, you do know.
[57:15.430 --> 57:21.590]  So that's kind of where, you know, building that, you know, building that organic material is very key.
[57:22.090 --> 57:33.530]  Back to one thing, Jared Kushner had a question earlier because someone mentioned that, I think it was Jethouse said with sandy soil, you do want a little bit more of your biochar.
[57:34.190 --> 57:41.150]  Reason being that you want a little bit more with your sandy soils because of that cation exchange capacity of sand is low.
[57:41.750 --> 57:51.210]  So you can add some of that in there with that biochar, whereas when you have clay, it's already got a high CEC, so you wouldn't want to go heavy with the bio, right?
[57:51.610 --> 57:57.450]  Yeah, it adds that charge, increases the cation exchange capacity, but also it's just a great buffer for drought.
[57:57.850 --> 58:00.890]  And so sandy soils dry out a lot faster.
[58:01.330 --> 58:08.830]  And also there's no like physical organic matter for, you know, the fungi and all these microbes to actually set up camp on.
[58:09.650 --> 58:14.250]  So in the sand, you get a huge rainstorm and all that stuff washes through.
[58:14.590 --> 58:18.270]  If you have the biochar on there, it's a physical home for them to stay.
[58:18.790 --> 58:24.630]  And then you have that water slowly, you know, leach into the soil profile from the biochar.
[58:24.630 --> 58:26.230]  And it's an excellent buffer.
[58:26.230 --> 58:32.070]  You can go away for the whole entire weekend and not have to water instead of, you know, every day or whatnot.
[58:32.550 --> 58:36.030]  So there's a time and place for everything.
[58:36.030 --> 58:40.670]  There's never one size fits all type thing.
[58:40.790 --> 58:42.270]  You know, you got to be pragmatic.
[58:42.270 --> 58:44.490]  You got to think about your situation and all that.
[58:48.930 --> 58:59.610]  That's why I think some of the best some of the best farmers are the ones that are, in my opinion, like in their early 20s, because they somehow have the ability to farm great cannabis.
[58:59.890 --> 59:04.050]  And in the last few years, they've been able to teach themselves how to wash great cannabis.
[59:04.370 --> 59:08.250]  And then once you have that, I mean, that is a skill set, especially at a young age.
[59:09.070 --> 59:15.110]  So then if you were able to take it to the next level where you really understand the microbes and you have that skill set.
[59:15.550 --> 59:17.390]  This is why I encourage a lot of the ones.
[59:18.590 --> 59:23.270]  Terp fountain, somebody that I think is somebody that I think carries the torch for that.
[59:23.430 --> 59:28.470]  You know, he donated to Heather's auction last week as well.
[59:28.470 --> 59:34.550]  So I think he deserves the credit out there where, you know, he's just an individual doing his thing.
[59:35.290 --> 59:42.850]  Anytime that I was at kind of like a major event in Denver or, you know, going to some of the major events around the country, he was there as well.
[59:43.570 --> 59:48.250]  And it seems like he's taken that those skill sets and kind of put his own twist on it.
[59:48.250 --> 59:55.850]  And that's what I hope to see from all other individuals out there is you kind of emulate that in your own way and find your own lane.
[59:55.870 --> 01:00:01.030]  But so many individuals view in your early 20s and you're farming your own cannabis and you're washing your own cannabis.
[01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:09.950]  I think the next step, if you've never heard about it, is to really understand that microbial world, because now you're going to get the full expression of everything that you're trying to do.
[01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:20.550]  You're going to be able to pheno hunt on just a whole nother level because you're allowing that microbial world to kind of do a lot of that work for you so that you just get the focus on the actual canopy itself.
[01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:21.990]  And how is that?
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.470]  How is the new microbial life that you've added to this?
[01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:32.930]  You know, you'll be able to notice that with the naked eye as the perpetual harvest start to start to take hold.
[01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:36.610]  I mean, it's almost like you're the genetics you've seen that are healthy.
[01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.610]  They just have a little extra vigor to them.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.530]  There's just a little extra praying leaves to them or something.
[01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:46.370]  It's just little nuances you'll notice when you start to believe and trust that process.
[01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:53.970]  Yeah, turps increase a lot, too, you know, microbes are responsible for all that.
[01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.150]  Yeah, just let the soil do the work.
[01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.390]  That's like my biggest thing.
[01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.750]  It's like I don't think we're smart enough to know what the plant needs when it needs it.
[01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:09.950]  And like, it's just so much easier to employ the worms, to employ the microbes, you know, to feed the soil and just let all of it take care of itself.
[01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:14.430]  And I know it's like it's not just that there are some skills you got to learn and all that stuff.
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:22.070]  But like it's so much easier to just rely on that heavy mulch layer and biodiversity to take care of itself.
[01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:25.850]  And it's all about having that relaxed plant, like you were saying.
[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:33.010]  And the great way to do that is to have the endophytes from your previous generation return to the soil and stay in the soil.
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:38.010]  And so the endophytes are the living bacteria and fungi that's in between the cells of living plants.
[01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:45.410]  When the leaf falls, when we defoliate and put that into the soil, the function changes when the environment changes.
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.290]  And so those endophytes start to become saprobes and they break down that organic matter.
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.470]  And once it's gone, they need somewhere to go.
[01:01:52.510 --> 01:02:02.750]  And so having a thick mulch layer that's going to protect those microbes or having biochar that's going to be a physical home for those microbes, you know, to close that loop, to create that feedback loop.
[01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:08.630]  And so they fall off the plant, they're on the leaf, the leaf disappears, those microbes go into the biochar.
[01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:22.970]  And if you can make that biochar from your ganja stalks, then boom, you have your biology living inside of the skeleton of your old, like the last generation.
[01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:25.810]  And that's how we get, you know, multiple generations going.
[01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.690]  That's how we breed for the effects that we want.
[01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:38.050]  And like, that's how we can team with the elders of the land, you know, the plant spirit, the multiple, the grandparents of, you know, the plant that we're growing now.
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:42.590]  It's still connected to, you know, it's like that's where it's at, I think.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:50.590]  I'm like thinking about, you know, stuff like that and returning everything to the soil and something else.
[01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:51.550]  I'm getting lost here.
[01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.310]  Do we keep that with JLF?
[01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:58.110]  You know, does JLF still kind of keep that same spirit?
[01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:00.270]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:02.190]  I do too.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:06.350]  Have you seen some of the stuff that Alexa's scoping with the JLF?
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:09.210]  Yes, and it's pretty crazy.
[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:13.890]  I see a lot of JLFs have the craziest diversity to me.
[01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.330]  It's just how complete.
[01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.810]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:19.570]  Got to embrace that.
[01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:20.970]  How do you complete?
[01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.250]  How do you guys define that?
[01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.410]  Because I think that's going to be a new buzzword as the years go by.
[01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:31.930]  Like this is bio complete X, Y, Z, compost, soil, whatever, you know, verbiage you had afterwards.
[01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.370]  So how do you guys define something as bio complete?
[01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.530]  I think that's a, I think we probably shouldn't be using that.
[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:47.730]  It's, it's trademarked by Elaine, but it's got protozoa, bacteria and fungi, right?
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:52.450]  Well, there's a certain threshold to it all in each category.
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:04:01.730]  And yeah, we probably shouldn't be using the term, but I think what everyone's trying to say is that it's like next level biology, something that's going to make your plants prey and, you know, help you get over issues.
[01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:03.290]  You know, that's what we're really trying to say.
[01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:03.970]  I think, you know,
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:05.690]  I prefer biointelligent.
[01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.990]  We should just start using that instead of bio complete.
[01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.790]  Yeah, totally.
[01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:24.830]  I agree because, you know, just to kind of go off what Chandler was saying about like, this is building biointelligence when, when we're allowing, when we're working with the ancestors or the microbes from previous generations.
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:39.010]  And they hold these DNA codes of what has happened in the past and microorganisms really help with our ability to adapt to changing environments.
[01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:48.450]  So like the more physical explanation to what is occurring here is horizontal gene transfer.
[01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:58.510]  And for anyone who doesn't know what this is, it's the ability of organisms to pick up genetic material from their environment.
[01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:01.110]  And it's typically done through viruses.
[01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:08.830]  And it can occur in any combination between humans, plants, animals, insects or fungi.
[01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:20.170]  However, it's very common or bacteria and archaea are able to perform horizontal gene transfer very easily.
[01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:27.130]  This is why we see bacteria or antibiotic resistance pop up.
[01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:43.470]  And something interesting I've read in the Art of Fermentation by Sandor Katz is that some microbiologists find it inappropriate to call prokaryotes a distinct species because of their ability to exchange genes.
[01:05:43.690 --> 01:06:00.570]  So, yeah, basically the bacteria are able, can express two million different genes, whereas humans, human cells can only express 20,000 genes.
[01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.970]  So bacteria have a far greater potential for adaptation than human cells.
[01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:14.110]  So when we're passing on this information generation through generation, we are building healthier and healthier plants and communities.
[01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:20.310]  Jay-Z bars, and I feel like you were dumbing it down as well.
[01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.670]  So that was fantastic.
[01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:32.710]  You know, this is to me, this is really what life should be about, man, is what you guys are creating this weekend is just remembering that we're here for a short time.
[01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:35.690]  There's a reason why this place is pretty special.
[01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:41.730]  And I don't know, man, our generation, obviously, the generations before started to lose sight of that.
[01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:51.770]  And now I think hopefully it seems like some generations or some parts of the newer generations are starting to realize that this place is pretty fucking cool, man.
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.850]  Like Earth is like, especially when you're tripping in the woods.
[01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.450]  And that's what I hope I hope most of you do this weekend.
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.250]  It just kind of gives you I've shared this with Marco.
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:05.910]  The best describing it would be like we just get a cleanse on the inside.
[01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.230]  You know, you shower every day, you're cleaning your body.
[01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:11.990]  But how many times are you actually kind of just re-cleansing, resetting?
[01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:20.670]  And if you can do mushrooms and fast all weekend, I think you would really be able to take yourself to.
[01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.670]  And if you've never fasted, then please don't do that.
[01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:28.070]  But if you've ever if you've ever done like 24 hours or something, this might be the weekend to push.
[01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:34.930]  Alexa, maybe we should get Brian there and we should videotape it and then we'll put that on next week's show.
[01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:37.850]  Fasting mushrooms and the push.
[01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:38.890]  OK, yeah, I like that.
[01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:40.730]  No food except for mushrooms.
[01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.650]  I like to push, you know, mental marathons and stuff.
[01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:54.690]  You know, we've I've played a high on mushrooms up at like this place called Black Hawk, which is where you play poker just to try to hold myself in.
[01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:59.270]  I played golf on that way where I've never I've never played better in my life.
[01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:08.750]  So there's certain things with mushrooms, man, where if you can really allow your mind to just zone in on whatever, it's eye opening what what you can accomplish.
[01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:13.110]  So they say I just learned something that the mushrooms heal.
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.110]  Psychedelics can heal your brain.
[01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:19.030]  Like part of that tripping process is healing as well.
[01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:27.290]  So TBI, you know, ex football players and people with traumatic, you know, stuff like that.
[01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:31.210]  So, I mean, I think that's a whole new realm that hasn't even been opened up.
[01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:37.810]  You know, the people like you, Brian and others that, you know, that go hard in that realm know the power of them.
[01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:48.770]  But, you know, as far as me, I'm not that versed in it, you know, and I think that'd be something that would be the next generation, kind of the next generation, but the next thing.
[01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.310]  You know, evolution of my brain possibly.
[01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:52.150]  Absolutely.
[01:08:52.230 --> 01:09:02.230]  But I want to be hooked up with people that you guys that, you know, kind of know your stuff, you know, because I remember, you know, college day, somebody had a little baggie pop some.
[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.990]  You don't know how many you even pop.
[01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:05.630]  And the next thing you know, here you go.
[01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:10.470]  You got a little trip, but to actually be intentional with it, you know what I mean?
[01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:13.310]  And dosing and knowing how much I should take and stuff.
[01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:15.730]  All those things I think are dope, are key, man.
[01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:20.610]  Meeting up with people like-minded folks and can kind of open those avenues for you.
[01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.530]  Yeah, your mindset and your physical setting are so important.
[01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:31.490]  And so obviously we don't want anybody, you know, taking a huge dose for their first time or anything, getting out of control.
[01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:44.950]  But I think a micro dose is absolutely appropriate for inoculating minds and, you know, giving these adults a chance to learn new information, which isn't super easy for some of us to do.
[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:51.190]  We create these, you know, shortcuts and, you know, we take things for granted.
[01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:55.390]  We make life easier for us to, you know, follow our daily patterns.
[01:09:55.390 --> 01:10:03.330]  But as a result of that, we end up skipping over some of the important stuff, you know, and not having time to smell the roses or, you know, look at the leaves type things.
[01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:13.490]  And so like a little bit of a micro dose and then in conjunction with lion's mane, which I don't know if you're familiar with this, Marco, but this is definitely worth sharing for anybody that doesn't know.
[01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.650]  Is both psilocybin and lion's mane cause neurogenesis.
[01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:19.530]  And that's the creation of new neurons.
[01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:34.950]  And so that's how people with the PTSD and brain injuries, you know, get over the stuff is they're literally creating new neural pathways, new circuitry in their brains to, you know, get over that previous path that they were caught up on, you know, thinking of things.
[01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:38.910]  Not so like it's also gives you that benefit.
[01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.590]  Yes.
[01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.990]  So both of those on their own gives you that benefit.
[01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:47.510]  And so like if you don't want to trip every day, you know, or take a micro dose or whatever, like lion's mane does it.
[01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:53.210]  But when you take both of them together and you stack them, it increases that nerve growth factor by a tenfold.
[01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.530]  So this is like the most incredible.
[01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:04.170]  We have to timestamp that guys, please somebody timestamp that because that was a gold bar, man.
[01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.810]  Really?
[01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:17.330]  And another thing people don't realize, guys, if you haven't had any of these gourmet mushrooms, as we call them, or the wild fours or the lion's mane and the really different ones, oysters, man, you've never had a
[01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:19.910]  mushroom as good like there's nothing better.
[01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:24.750]  Like you can literally take that lion's mane and make a sandwich, sauté it and make a sandwich.
[01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.110]  And it's like so delicious.
[01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:34.470]  So definitely encourage everybody to reach out and get on into your fun job because there's no doubt that we're eating as well as our brain power.
[01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:40.110]  Yeah, and that's another thing, too, is the power of the food and feeding people.
[01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.670]  And there's a time and place for the fasting for sure.
[01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:46.810]  But like we're trying to inoculate minds, inoculate bodies.
[01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:54.850]  And so that's where like the fermentation comes in and feeding people these probiotic living foods that are going to feed our guts.
[01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:59.450]  That our guts and our brains are in constant two way communication at the vagus nerve.
[01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:03.490]  And so like this is something else that Ganjasana is going to be talking about.
[01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:12.570]  And it goes along with the parasympathetic nervous system and like truly like being here and present when you're eating your food, you know, not staring at the screen.
[01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:17.550]  Not eating when you're stuck in traffic, but like sitting and appreciating that food.
[01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.350]  And that's how you assimilate your nutrients.
[01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:24.950]  And like doing that while you're actually eating, you know, the best nutrient dense food around.
[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:30.990]  Like that's how you're going to give yourself the energy, the power, the brain power to be learning these new things.
[01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:33.110]  And so like we need all of this.
[01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:40.110]  We need, you know, the inoculate mind, inoculate body in order to inoculate the soil and like to inoculate our communities.
[01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:45.330]  And so like we're going to be learning all this stuff and then we're going to spread back out and, you know, the weekend's going to be over.
[01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.890]  And what do you do with that?
[01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.330]  You take it back to your community.
[01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.770]  You mix it in with your own life experience.
[01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:54.370]  You know, you don't just reiterate what we said.
[01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:58.410]  You know, you make sure that you understand it first and then you share that.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.970]  And like that's how we make these big changes.
[01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:08.530]  Taking the stuff back to our community and sharing with our neighbors, sharing with other people that show any spark of interest.
[01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:14.030]  And sharing it with people that need it the most who, you know, this isn't on their radar at all.
[01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:22.510]  You know, starting a friendly conversation, like not lecturing them, not, you know, being mad, telling them that everything that they're doing is destroying the world.
[01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:28.990]  But like starting real conversations with real people and, you know, trying to find these practical solutions.
[01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:32.350]  And becoming the voices of many.
[01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:36.470]  We will lead the way to a new world, my friends.
[01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:44.750]  And you'll be surprised, man, on the local level, like, you know, we're all like Instagram friends, right?
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.910]  You guys are out there.
[01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:46.710]  I'm in Virginia.
[01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:48.230]  Everyone's over everywhere.
[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:53.750]  But you'll realize and what I notice is you'll start making those local connections.
[01:13:53.750 --> 01:14:00.130]  The local natural farmers will hit you and say, wow, you're right here in my town, you know, and that kind of thing.
[01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:07.950]  And that's when it really, you know, becomes powerful, I think, because then now you're actually making an impact where your feet touch the ground.
[01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:12.090]  You know, with people that you know and that can help strengthen your entire community.
[01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:15.490]  So just a $30 ticket, man.
[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:26.370]  I mean, the amount of power that you're now yielding and bringing back with you, even if you don't understand everything 100%, make sure you got the basics down.
[01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:34.130]  And make sure you got it down enough to where when you read more about it after that weekend's over and you've cleared your mind and now you're ready to kind of dig deeper.
[01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.510]  Know that when now you're reading, oh, that's what Jethouse was talking about.
[01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:40.630]  That's what Alexa meant when she said that.
[01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:42.750]  Know that's when those things really stick with you.
[01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:43.110]  So.
[01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:49.830]  Yeah, that's happened so many times, you know, you don't fully get everything out of it.
[01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:53.350]  But then a conversation a year down the road, you know, connects that dot.
[01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.070]  Oh, no, I get it.
[01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:59.390]  You know, it's like always got to be having an open mind.
[01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.810]  Yeah.
[01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:08.810]  One thing I'll add there is that, you know, you can compost really anything.
[01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:10.330]  You can compost emotions.
[01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:13.650]  You can compost past experiences or trauma.
[01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:19.410]  So, you know, we have we all know like where we're at in the world.
[01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:30.310]  We all know like what has been done and the things we're facing in the environmental crisis and human health crisis.
[01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:36.310]  And instead of, you know, pointing fingers, you know, we're going to compost these past situations.
[01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:42.550]  We're going to let it become fertile ground for new life and new paradigms to emerge.
[01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:46.390]  Now, that's something that's hard for me.
[01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:48.630]  Like, all right, let's go a little deeper.
[01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.850]  Like, I got I got an issue right now.
[01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:53.450]  I want to post it on out of here.
[01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:55.450]  Like, tell us how do we do that?
[01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.770]  How do we kind of work through that?
[01:15:58.090 --> 01:16:11.250]  Um, yeah, I guess it's all about creating new habits and just being able to recognize, hey, you know, something's not right here.
[01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:16.050]  And just being able to that acceptance is really key.
[01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:32.870]  So, you know, accepting where you're at and then from that acceptance, you're able to then create and co-create new new ways of being new thoughts, new ideas and new paradigms.
[01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:35.790]  Yeah, that's big.
[01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.950]  I try to get my gold bars on the screen.
[01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:43.870]  Acceptance, accepting where you're at, because you got to accept and be honest, 100 percent honest.
[01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:45.530]  Then you can move forward.
[01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:46.610]  Great words.
[01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:50.370]  And it starts with you yourself.
[01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:53.450]  You're the only one that makes decisions for you.
[01:16:54.650 --> 01:17:02.650]  That's right. So a little bit, I think I thought Brian was kind of touching on this, but maybe maybe I was just thinking it in my mind.
[01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:09.970]  So, like, I know this comes up a lot like standards, like, you know, what's a good compost, like a good like.
[01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:15.030]  Is that ever going to get some kind of a standard, you know what I mean?
[01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.550]  Or is that just always just going to be some kind of a debate?
[01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.430]  You know what I mean? What do you think on that?
[01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.430]  Probably going to be a super expensive series of testing.
[01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:27.790]  And that's going to be, you know, one snapshot in time and never the full picture.
[01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:36.350]  And like there's just so many parameters to this soil, so multifaceted, like we've said, like it's not just the microbiology.
[01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:37.550]  It's not just the nutrients.
[01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:46.770]  It's not just the chemistry, like it's the energy of the soil and it's all of those things combined to create that circuitry, that that energy flow.
[01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:52.410]  And that's what grows the plants is the energy and like still interconnected.
[01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:57.010]  And like, I don't it hurts my brain to even try to fully understand all of it.
[01:17:57.010 --> 01:18:01.610]  So it's like better to just mulch the soil and, you know, trust the magic.
[01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:05.050]  And like, you know, it's like this shit's way over us.
[01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:16.510]  I think putting your trust into the soil, putting your good intentions, making that soil as rich as possible with the things that we do know, adding the organic matter and the microbes and everything.
[01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:18.110]  Like, I don't know.
[01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:24.670]  You look at the guys at the barn there in Michigan when Leighton was there putting the crystals in the soil.
[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:33.350]  I know Alexa and I have talked about sending them T-shirts as well for the defenders of the biology, because I think those boys deserve it for that.
[01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:36.790]  Absolutely. I agree.
[01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:40.190]  They're doing some incredible stuff.
[01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:48.630]  Something really quick about the determining the quality and, you know, that's something we've kind of struggled with.
[01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:55.230]  And that's why we've transitioned from the compost cup to camp compost.
[01:18:55.650 --> 01:19:06.330]  And I do think there are varying qualities of compost and there are composts that are more high quality than others.
[01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:14.970]  But that's not to undermine other composts and say that a compost wouldn't be beneficial for the soil.
[01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:20.470]  Because ultimately, I think really like it's hard to mess up a compost.
[01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:26.910]  It's really all going to be organic matter, which is highly beneficial for the soil.
[01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:36.350]  And, you know, that organic matter can be home for other the indigenous microbes, like we were saying.
[01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:44.010]  And I guess I just thought of something in the art of fermentation.
[01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:54.810]  Sandor Katz, I'm talking about this a lot because I'm just reading it, but he says he has demonstrated that ingesting certain species of microbes,
[01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:03.330]  it's hard for those species to actually become established within the microbiome.
[01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:07.070]  But that doesn't mean they don't have a lot of influence.
[01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:16.190]  So something that I know Leighton talks about a lot is biostimulants and how any biology can be a biostimulant for the soil.
[01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:21.230]  Because these microbes have very high nutrient density.
[01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:23.910]  Bacteria are the most nutrient dense organisms on Earth.
[01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:31.630]  So when they come into a system, whether it be soil or the gut, they might not stick around for long.
[01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:41.930]  But they will provide a food resource for the indigenous microbiology that's already functioning within the niches in that system.
[01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:49.410]  Well, you're going to be food or you'll be eaten, you know, you either eat or be eaten.
[01:20:51.050 --> 01:21:00.170]  And if you want to go for the gut microbes real quick, just Alexa and I have talked about this when we interviewed her before, where we talk about autophagy.
[01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:03.150]  That's something that a rabbit hole, we don't need to talk about it today.
[01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:11.470]  But that is if you really want to get your micro, you know, if it's free, all you got to do is stop eating and kind of set your intentions and all that.
[01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:17.470]  So go down that rabbit hole, please, because it's another way to if you can get your I had leaky gut.
[01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:19.270]  So I just I felt horrible all the time.
[01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:20.230]  I was tired all the time.
[01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:30.890]  So whatever you're suffering from, you know, basically autophagy and, you know, making sure that you follow what the guidelines are on that can heal that for you.
[01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:32.290]  Sorry, Michael.
[01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:33.650]  Oh, that's all right.
[01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:34.690]  No problem, man.
[01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:36.530]  I love everything we're talking about.
[01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:39.010]  So we could sit here and keep talking about this all day.
[01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:43.330]  So I'm just going to add to the, you know, the compost conversation.
[01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:49.930]  I think, you know, compost is a general term, you know, and I think that's where we get hung up on this like gradient.
[01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:57.330]  Thing and, you know, there's not to say that any compost is bad, just like Alexa said, you know, the whole soil succession is going to happen.
[01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:02.770]  You stimulating it with a low quality compost is going to help stimulate that process, like she's saying, you know.
[01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:17.970]  But I do think like if you're like a premier grower and you need to solve some of these issues, like there is definitely something that happens when you apply something that has a high level of biology, like a compost tea that's just loaded with fungus, bacteria, protozoa.
[01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:25.990]  You know, that's going to have a bigger impact on like just a bacterial ferment if your problem, you know, is because you're lacking a high level of diversity.
[01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:29.710]  So, you know, that's where, you know, you'll get into splitting hairs and stuff.
[01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:34.910]  But overall, like depends on where your goal is, you know, and, you know, compost is good.
[01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:37.510]  If you're composting, you give yourself a pat on the back.
[01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:44.350]  I don't care if that never even makes it to like a plant that you're growing, even if it just makes it to the grass in your yard, like, you know.
[01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:47.430]  Yeah, very true.
[01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:51.770]  No composting is bad, you know, all composting is good.
[01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:54.690]  And there's like anything else you get better, you know what I mean?
[01:22:55.170 --> 01:23:03.210]  And, you know, you as your skill set and what to add and how to turn and when you turn and keep your moisture, those things will change and get better.
[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:08.410]  And I like to think of a compost like, you know, the compost could only be as good as it could be.
[01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:09.170]  You know what I mean?
[01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:11.810]  There's you put in you put your inputs into it.
[01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:16.370]  What you had on your place maybe only, you know, get it to a certain point.
[01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:22.950]  And around your property, but still you're still going to collect all that diversity of the soil of the land around you.
[01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:28.710]  So even if it's not like, you know, an award winning compost, it's still going to be beneficial.
[01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:33.430]  It's still going to be a lot more diverse than any of your local soil, I would think, you know, so.
[01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.710]  For sure.
[01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:41.190]  Yeah, I know the way I look at that is, is that good things always take time.
[01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:48.010]  So why would, you know, if you're brand new to this, it's almost like you shouldn't be able to earn that right away.
[01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:55.170]  You know, your compost should improve as you know, you kind of your understanding of what's going on and you're adding so much diversity.
[01:23:55.170 --> 01:24:03.290]  And I mean, I know everybody hears that each and every week, but to really understand and comprehend what's going on, I mean, that's going to take time and experience.
[01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.770]  You're going to have to see that for yourself, see things improve on its own.
[01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:13.630]  Everybody can tell you that to where blue in the face, but until you personally see it, it's it's really eye opening.
[01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:16.910]  It's almost like a new paradigm when you're like, wow, the microbial world.
[01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:21.390]  No wonder Mother Nature kicks ass no matter where it's undisturbed.
[01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.550]  It's because she just figures it out on her own.
[01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:28.390]  She doesn't need, you know, human beings keep fucking it up, adding all these golf courses and stuff.
[01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:36.590]  You know, I mean, it's just it's really silly what human beings have done to a place that especially when I'm talking when I'm super high on mushrooms, when you really
[01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:44.890]  connect with like this place is fucking magical when the middle of infinite space, it just happens to be here and it has seasons.
[01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:50.850]  I mean, when you really are high and you really allow your mind to go down on that, you know, it's fun to think about.
[01:24:51.010 --> 01:25:00.330]  So I hope some of you go down that road because I've I've enjoyed that over the years where it's just you're hanging out with people that believe in that kind of same stuff or have you have the same vibe with you.
[01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:05.530]  And then you kind of go on another level, especially if you're taking like a heroic dose with each other.
[01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:15.610]  Yeah, and anyone that's listening out there, you know, don't be afraid to fail when you're composting or making IMO, collecting IMO, like you're going to fail a lot.
[01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:19.450]  Like I've failed way more than I've succeeded and I've learned a lot from it.
[01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:21.610]  Absolutely.
[01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:23.370]  Definitely.
[01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:27.850]  You have to fail to grow because if you don't fail, it's just too easy.
[01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.650]  And when you fail, you have to strive.
[01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.210]  And when you strive, wonderful things happen.
[01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.470]  Yeah, static piles.
[01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:41.910]  Alexa, you touched on that in your three step process, just the art of a static pile and leaving it.
[01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:45.390]  I said art, but that's really just leaving it to mother nature.
[01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.510]  Those piles may come back in six months or a year.
[01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:51.710]  You know, you got something wonderful under there.
[01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:53.830]  You know, things like that are very simple.
[01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:57.270]  Those are ways that you can kind of buy yourself time.
[01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.950]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:57.950 --> 01:26:01.890]  If you know, you know, I'm going to take a year to kind of build my infrastructure.
[01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:08.050]  We'll start, you know, piling things up and start thinking forward that, OK, in a year this pile will be ready.
[01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:13.290]  Now I'll be able to use it in my garden bed and my soil or as a mulch or something like that.
[01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:18.850]  So, yeah, definitely, you know, letting nature do her work.
[01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:20.490]  It's an amazing thing.
[01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:23.010]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:40.270]  And that's something that Chandler and I teach is that, you know, composting can be as easy as just connecting the organic matter with the ground and letting the indigenous microorganisms and nature do the rest.
[01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:46.190]  Totally depends on your situation and everything, like we've said.
[01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:58.530]  But, yeah, we really don't recommend hot composting unless you have a ton of stuff that you're really trying to reduce that biomass, reduce the risk of pathogens from manure or whatever that means.
[01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:03.210]  But, yeah, that's not even the right way to think of it.
[01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:07.610]  But hot composting, you end up losing a lot of microbes.
[01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:09.290]  You end up losing a lot of nutrients.
[01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:14.370]  And, you know, probably don't need to do that if you just got a little backyard situation.
[01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:18.110]  You can cold compost just fine if you have the time and the space to do so.
[01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:22.030]  So, like, that's it entirely.
[01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:26.510]  Your own situation is going to determine what method you do.
[01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:33.670]  That's a great point, though, because, you know, when you compost, guys, that heat and that steam that you see, you're losing energy.
[01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:35.430]  You know, it's part of the process.
[01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:40.750]  So a cold pile can just kind of, you know, lock in a little bit more of your nutrient.
[01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:41.790]  You don't lose as much.
[01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:45.250]  You just kind of get the shredders in there, cycling it all down for you.
[01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.210]  So good point there.
[01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:54.650]  Yeah, it's like at home, I use this three step system to create high quality compost.
[01:27:54.650 --> 01:28:02.050]  But at HIFA, at the Grow, I am dealing with a lot more biomass.
[01:28:02.050 --> 01:28:11.950]  So we tend to either do a hot compost or like a Johnson's stew compost just to get that material broken down quicker.
[01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:19.270]  Now, I wanted to bring up that you recently won some hardware with HIFA.
[01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:22.750]  You guys enter into something and you came home with something.
[01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:27.990]  So when people are talking about trust the process, what you know, what's in it for me to learn this kind of stuff?
[01:28:28.210 --> 01:28:31.730]  I wanted to let you know, I'm going to bring it up so that you can talk about it.
[01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:33.330]  But, you know, it's me bringing it up.
[01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:37.930]  So you're more than welcome to boast what your team accomplished recently.
[01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:40.250]  Is it the Cannabis Cup?
[01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:51.370]  Yeah. So we won first place in the Sativa category with our tropical runs this year, the People's Choice Michigan Cannabis Cup.
[01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:54.250]  So that was super exciting.
[01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.630]  Shout out to the teams, Zach, Ross and Losha.
[01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:00.590]  You know, we're doing amazing work.
[01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:03.670]  And what was I going to say?
[01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:09.590]  Oh, yes. And the Gondrasana ceremony that we will be having on Sunday night.
[01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:13.710]  We will be honoring the tropical runs during that ceremony.
[01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:20.870]  What I loved is you have the hardware and you mentioned like four people.
[01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:23.930]  Right. So you have a small team of individuals.
[01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.890]  And that is what Living Soil to me is all about.
[01:29:26.890 --> 01:29:30.610]  When people like almost apologize up front, like, hey, it's just a family farm.
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:34.330]  I'm sorry. I don't. Again, that's to me, that's where the quality is at.
[01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:38.490]  When you say that to me, you're saying, hey, I'm sorry, I don't have this huge budget.
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:42.210]  I didn't in a way sell my soul to the suit so that I could grow.
[01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.770]  I decided to do it my own way.
[01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:46.770]  And I think that is long term.
[01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:48.850]  That is where it's at, because you're going to be able to control it.
[01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:53.750]  You know, you're going to be able to say, hey, you know, I've seen where people have bought
[01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.750]  into the system, even places in Oklahoma and stuff.
[01:29:56.990 --> 01:30:01.110]  And then another round of suits come in and they don't believe in that system.
[01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:04.590]  So all that money that was spent into a Living Soil building up the beds, all that kind of
[01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:05.910]  stuff goes to the wayside.
[01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:07.990]  So, you know, there you guys are.
[01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:09.030]  And I don't know your background.
[01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:13.270]  I mean, you know, but it seems like you guys are small enough to where it's you know, you
[01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:15.990]  can make you can make your own decisions for the most part.
[01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:18.410]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:24.250]  We are very small and, you know, grow our own type situation.
[01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:28.970]  The three guys that I mentioned are the owners and I'm the only employee.
[01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:32.410]  Losha is my boyfriend.
[01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:41.250]  And so, yeah, it is really hard in this industry, but we are creating our own niche.
[01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:47.190]  And yeah, I would love to have all four of us on the show one day so we can get deeper
[01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:50.110]  into that in our background and what we're doing there.
[01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:52.310]  Yes, definitely.
[01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:56.550]  People, let's face it, Marco, people like when they have the hardware, you know, if
[01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:58.110]  you're telling us. I know I do.
[01:30:58.150 --> 01:30:59.230]  We'll show it, right.
[01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:02.590]  Or if you're making all this money, then we got to see proof of it.
[01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:05.910]  Right. So, I mean, there's got to be some kind of aspect to it.
[01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:10.630]  And it's just cool to see that you're living and breathing what you're doing and
[01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:12.050]  bringing home the hardware.
[01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:19.010]  Yeah, it's good to see people winning with these techniques and these not even technique,
[01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:22.890]  but a kind of lifestyle, you know, natural farm becomes a lifestyle.
[01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:25.610]  And you guys, what did you guys grow?
[01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.090]  I guess all living soils.
[01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:29.930]  How did it grow in or how do you guys grow?
[01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:32.530]  Yes, it is. It's all living soil.
[01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:35.230]  Yeah. See, I mean, just to see that.
[01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:38.970]  And then when that living soil gets the win, that just reinforces it.
[01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:41.710]  You know, makes people see that we're not just talking.
[01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:42.830]  This stuff is real.
[01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:44.470]  It doesn't just look good.
[01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:45.990]  It wins. Yeah.
[01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:47.390]  Excellent quality.
[01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:50.750]  And this thing, too, is people just need to try it themselves.
[01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:52.870]  You know, everybody claims that they have the best weed.
[01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:57.510]  And so what makes us any different until you actually try it and taste it yourself?
[01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:59.310]  And that's how we convert people.
[01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:00.670]  The same thing with the veggies, too.
[01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:04.510]  You know, it's like any chef that does the blind taste test is going to choose that
[01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.350]  organic veggie because it tastes better, you know, every time.
[01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:13.290]  And so like the Cannabis Cup had the like open judging and people got to, you know,
[01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:17.730]  there's a public panel and there's people posting their reviews like, holy shit, this
[01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:21.810]  one actually smells when you open the jar, which is how, you know, cannabis should be.
[01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:25.370]  Should slap the people choice or it is the one you want for sure.
[01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:27.570]  For sure. The other ones are.
[01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.090]  I don't know. You want to be the people's champ.
[01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:33.530]  That's the one to get. So that's why I wanted to highlight it.
[01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.170]  I know it's you know, you don't want to bring it up.
[01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:39.230]  And Chandler, you know, at the same time, but, you know, you've helped I'm using your
[01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:44.390]  products and Marco's products and Johnny's products, mindfully rooted to start my own
[01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:49.750]  business. And we're right before we came on stage, people were thanking us for doing the
[01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.990]  passive income show, Marco.
[01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:55.750]  And I think I wouldn't be able to have my passive income without being plugged into
[01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:59.990]  this network. So that's what you guys are, I think, also creating this weekend is
[01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:02.530]  there's going to be you know, I need a new plug for this.
[01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:03.630]  Oh, I know how to do that.
[01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:04.930]  I could teach you how to do that.
[01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:09.270]  If you teach me how to do this or and that's what I think, too, is you always have to
[01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:12.830]  give something back. And sometimes people are true to their word on that.
[01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:16.310]  Sometimes they're not. So remember that karma is real.
[01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:20.470]  So when you meet these individuals, I think some of these people in these connections,
[01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:26.350]  you know, Marco, I think just for me and you just chopping it up or if I have a question,
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:30.350]  you know, you answer me, you know, in a timely manner and that kind of thing.
[01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:34.870]  It allows me to build my business on a rapid pace.
[01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:37.390]  And to have your skill set.
[01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:41.270]  And then I was able to buy Chandler stuff last year and run it.
[01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:42.950]  And I got these huge fish tanks.
[01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:47.830]  So running his stuff through there and then adding my own little flavor and flair and
[01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:49.870]  then reaching out and having different IMOs.
[01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:52.990]  And Ryan here in Colorado even added some to that.
[01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:58.310]  So the network, the community that you guys are building, like it's there and it's
[01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:02.910]  alive. And I think you guys are just pouring gasoline on it to just kind of like let the
[01:34:03.330 --> 01:34:07.610]  whole community, you know, internationally know that there's individuals out there.
[01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:08.810]  They're putting things together.
[01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:13.930]  And thirty dollars to me in twenty twenty two is you guys are asking pennies to show
[01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:16.650]  up and be be around at this event.
[01:34:18.330 --> 01:34:19.810]  Yeah, man, definitely.
[01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:24.090]  There's so much value there, you know, tons of value.
[01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:25.370]  So great, great deal.
[01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:29.570]  And that's where I always say, Brian, like, so you're using, you know, my stuff,
[01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.530]  Jethouse, a couple of different people.
[01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:37.590]  So that's where I say when we are strong as individuals, when Jethouse is strong, he's
[01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:41.430]  got a quality product, Alexa, Michael, everybody's strong.
[01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:44.070]  Solid has their own legs to stand on.
[01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:46.310]  We're all stronger, the community stronger.
[01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:52.830]  Now you can stand on products like this or people like this and ensure that that
[01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:56.350]  quality is going to kind of move forward through the process.
[01:34:56.370 --> 01:35:01.290]  You know, I like dealing with people that don't cut corners, you know, take shortcuts,
[01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:04.830]  you know, I like to buy myself time if I can.
[01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.910]  One way it would be, like I said, static pile, cold pile.
[01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.630]  That's just buying myself time for later.
[01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:16.870]  And so doing things like this, connecting with us and people that are quality, I think
[01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:20.430]  that's just you know, that's just what the community is about, man.
[01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:22.870]  And we'll strengthen we'll all get stronger together.
[01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:26.950]  You know, there's always going to be ones that are better than the community or they're
[01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:30.750]  too big to kind of be in a brick, get too big for britches.
[01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:31.450]  That's fine.
[01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:32.490]  Let them go ahead.
[01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:35.250]  The community is kind of the army, though.
[01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:38.910]  We're the ones that kind of keep the strength and keep pushing it forward.
[01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:44.810]  So that's why having people like this are great on our shows and passive income, guys.
[01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:49.290]  Every show you should be able to take a little something from every show and at least
[01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:54.250]  stimulate your mind to thinking, OK, how can I kind of be off on my own or doing my own
[01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.890]  thing or getting a little bit more income?
[01:35:55.890 --> 01:35:58.930]  So, yes, kind of why we do these shows.
[01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:02.950]  Marco, my friend, I don't think a little from each show.
[01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:07.030]  I mean, I can't go to the gold bars dropping fast enough.
[01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:08.430]  Half the shows we do.
[01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:09.310]  Come on.
[01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:13.270]  I know I forget to hit them half the time because they're just constant.
[01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:16.910]  Like we just there's the standing quality information and it's wonderful.
[01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:21.550]  I'm writing them down, trying to try to do both things at the same time.
[01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:22.750]  I know, man.
[01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:23.070]  I'm a man.
[01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:27.510]  I'm a write a book after all our guests and all my notes from all the shows.
[01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:32.930]  Yeah, you can write a whole book in five or six, five or six books, probably.
[01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:40.330]  Anyway, Brian, maybe we should get back to the fermentation demo on Saturday.
[01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:42.130]  We kind of lost track there.
[01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:43.370]  That's no problem.
[01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:44.450]  We're going through it.
[01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:50.370]  Um, yeah, another cool part about that is, you know, it's empowerment.
[01:36:50.370 --> 01:36:54.650]  All of this stuff, you know, is making our own nutrients, making our own compost.
[01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:57.470]  Like it's putting the power back into the farmer's hand.
[01:36:57.870 --> 01:37:00.890]  We're not reliant on the nutrient company, the growth store anymore.
[01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:03.070]  This fermentation thing is huge.
[01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:06.030]  You know, people think, uh, you want to eat healthy.
[01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:08.790]  You got to go spend $200 at whole foods or whatever.
[01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:11.210]  And like, it's unrealistic for people, you know?
[01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:15.070]  And so they think it's like this huge.
[01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:17.990]  Like privilege to eat healthy.
[01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:19.270]  And it absolutely is.
[01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:23.270]  But like, you don't need to spend $13 on a jar of sauerkraut.
[01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:25.490]  You can spend $1 on a cabbage.
[01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:26.810]  You can grow your own cabbage.
[01:37:27.210 --> 01:37:31.250]  You can add water and salt and like, let the microbes transform this thing.
[01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:34.850]  You can have gallons of probiotic fermented food.
[01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:36.250]  That's delicious, nutritious.
[01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:40.730]  You know, you don't need to spend a fortune buying healthy food from other
[01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:44.390]  people, like you can do this stuff with a little bit of time and effort.
[01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:51.130]  And I know like, it's, yeah, it's pretty wild, but just a little bit of, of, uh,
[01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:57.430]  you know, relearning and reprioritizing our time, you know, making time to make a
[01:37:57.430 --> 01:38:01.550]  little ferment and then you have stuff for months, you know, it was like, that's
[01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:05.070]  so important and learning how to make all these different foods.
[01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:11.150]  Um, so one, like unlock the nutrients in there to add biodiversity, but like also
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:15.710]  to preserve them and have living foods all winter long here in Michigan is huge
[01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:19.830]  without having to like ship that in, you know, like you still have living, breathing
[01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:22.210]  food here and in your jar of sauerkraut.
[01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.890]  Fermentation is really, really cool.
[01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:27.410]  And, uh, it's something that all of us should look into.
[01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:33.690]  Alexis mentioned the book a couple of times, but, uh, who, which one was the
[01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:35.490]  art of fermentation?
[01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:35.770]  Yeah.
[01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:36.610]  Sandor Katz.
[01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.730]  He's got a couple of books and they're all wonderful.
[01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:42.850]  And, uh, it's, uh, he, he's not a microbiologist, you know, he's a food
[01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:45.610]  lover and he writes about the microbes through his experience.
[01:38:45.610 --> 01:38:49.810]  And so it's a lot easier for us to understand, not from a microbiologist,
[01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:54.190]  standpoint, but, you know, somebody else, one of us and, uh, yeah,
[01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:55.810]  fermentation is really cool.
[01:38:55.870 --> 01:39:00.490]  And so we're going to be talking about, um, garden ferments as well as, you know,
[01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:04.670]  kitchen ferments and some that are both in the crossover between the two and the
[01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:06.870]  science of the fermentation, the art of fermentation.
[01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:08.910]  Um, yeah.
[01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:14.910]  We all talk differently about like FPE with made with sugar ferments versus
[01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:16.790]  you're like sauerkraut salt.
[01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:18.750]  Or is that you use both?
[01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:19.470]  Yeah.
[01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:20.490]  We probably should.
[01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:25.130]  So like we're trying to choose some for time limits and whatnot, but I think doing
[01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:31.770]  a sugar ferment, like the FPJ-FPE would be a good idea as well to compare the two.
[01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:39.490]  But, uh, we're going to do like water composting or JLF, um, as well as, um,
[01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:43.970]  apple cider vinegar, which that'd be a good crossover for the garden as well as
[01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.470]  your gut.
[01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:52.630]  Um, Bokashi, I think, what was, or no, the EM mud balls, which that's really cool
[01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:56.430]  is using the Bokashi to ferment, you know, clay soil or mud.
[01:39:56.870 --> 01:40:00.470]  And then you have like this ball form that you can lob out into your water.
[01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:04.950]  And so like, um, you can spread it out evenly in your pond and that's going to,
[01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:08.990]  you know, settle down to the bottom and start eating the sludge and it'll eat
[01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:12.670]  the algae and like, it'll clean up your water and improve the health of all of
[01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:14.410]  your aquatic microorganisms.
[01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:17.690]  And then from there, you know, improve the health of everything that eats those, all
[01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:22.630]  your fish and all the birds, everything like, so like it's more than just paying
[01:40:22.630 --> 01:40:26.090]  attention to the soil as what can we do to our waterways as well.
[01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.250]  And
[01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:31.650]  just to jump in there, that's, that's big time thinking right there.
[01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:37.410]  Would you ever be concerned with over LAB or over labbing that water doing the
[01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:38.450]  balls like that?
[01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:39.450]  Yeah.
[01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:41.450]  So you don't want to go over.
[01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:45.070]  Uh, I need to check my notes here, but I think it's like a thousand.
[01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:50.430]  I don't even want to say the wrong number right now, but like there is a, there is
[01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:51.870]  a limit on that for sure.
[01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:52.070]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.190]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:52.510]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:54.550]  And like, you only want like one per square yard.
[01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:59.090]  And like, uh, if there's fish in there, if it's too small for fish also matters
[01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:02.030]  and things, but like, yeah, you can definitely add too much and that might
[01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:04.230]  actually hurt your fish population.
[01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:06.290]  I just wanted to put that out there.
[01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:09.950]  Cause I don't want our guys, our folks just heading out and dumping LAB in their
[01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:12.730]  pond, you know, there's intent behind these things.
[01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:17.990]  And that's one reason you need to go to compost camp, uh, to figure it all out.
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:23.930]  Like you want to kind of spread them.
[01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:27.490]  Usually this is more of like an outdoor setting and it seems like some
[01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:30.970]  individuals use like, uh, the tennis ball thrower for their dog.
[01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:34.450]  They just use that to throw their Bokashi balls or wherever the hell you're
[01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:36.250]  calling it, uh, out there.
[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.090]  Mud balls.
[01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:37.370]  Yeah.
[01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:38.210]  The mud balls.
[01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.970]  I like the.
[01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:41.210]  Yeah.
[01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:45.450]  Um, I'll add some, uh, stuff to the fermentation demo.
[01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:52.170]  Um, so I want to start off by with a quote, um, from the art of fermentation.
[01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:59.570]  Um, and Sandor Katz says, given the war on biology that is predominant, um,
[01:41:59.570 --> 01:42:05.490]  within our culture, the wellbeing of our microbial ecology, um, requires
[01:42:05.530 --> 01:42:09.730]  regular replenishment and diversification now more than ever.
[01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:18.690]  Um, so this is why, um, adding these microbial inputs are so important.
[01:42:18.690 --> 01:42:22.770]  And that's something we're going to be focusing on this weekend is the, um,
[01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:26.250]  gut microbiome and its importance in our health.
[01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:32.490]  And I think, um, something I, you know, didn't know is that, um, microbes
[01:42:32.490 --> 01:42:35.370]  can turn any food into a super food.
[01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:41.770]  Um, when fermented foods are highly nutritious, um, microbes are able to
[01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:46.210]  not only preserve the nutrition in that food, but they're able to make it
[01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:51.130]  more bioavailable and in some cases add nutrients to the food.
[01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:57.250]  Um, also in many cases, they're able to decompose, um, anti-nutrients,
[01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:00.530]  um, as well as, um, toxins.
[01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:07.510]  And, um, they also produce, um, a lot of different metabolites as
[01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:09.530]  a product of their fermentation.
[01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:14.770]  And something I've been reading a lot about lately is, um, when microbes
[01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:20.690]  ferment insoluble fibers, they create, um, short chain fatty acids and three
[01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:25.690]  are primarily created on that's acetate, um, propionate and bureate.
[01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:27.190]  I believe they are pronounced.
[01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:34.730]  Um, anyways, the research suggests, um, that, um, these compounds have a huge
[01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:38.690]  role in, um, regulating our functions.
[01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:46.170]  Um, so our immune system, blood pressure, um, insulin secretion, and, um, it's
[01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:52.330]  also been shown that these short chain fatty acids can crush the, um, blood
[01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:57.010]  brain barrier and, um, affect our brain, our nervous system
[01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:58.610]  function and brain function.
[01:43:59.050 --> 01:44:07.270]  Um, so it has a, um, so these compounds have a very, um, significant impact
[01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:13.250]  on our function and, um, this is why adding them to our diet is so important.
[01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:17.810]  Um, so the first part of the demonstration, like Chandler was saying,
[01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:21.770]  um, will be more so about, um, garden inputs and.
[01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:27.570]  Um, soil inputs, but the second part, um, we're going to focus on, um, food,
[01:44:27.570 --> 01:44:34.490]  fermented foods and our, um, fermentation, food fermentation guru, Jordan is going
[01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:41.050]  to be, um, leading us in, um, some demonstrations, um, of sauerkraut, um,
[01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:44.090]  brine vegetables and kombucha.
[01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:47.210]  And, um, it's going to be a hands-on demo too.
[01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:54.370]  So, um, everyone bring a jar to fill or, um, you know, jar to sample.
[01:44:54.370 --> 01:44:59.010]  We'll have a lot of different fermented foods available for you to try.
[01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:01.570]  Um, yeah.
[01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:07.050]  And Chandler mentioned something to me, um, earlier, and it's
[01:45:07.050 --> 01:45:08.870]  that just a warning for everyone.
[01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:13.850]  If you haven't tried fermented foods before, just, um, go with caution,
[01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.690]  try little bits at a time because, um, it can have, um, an
[01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:19.850]  impact on your digestive system.
[01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:21.810]  You really have to work your way up right now.
[01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:27.050]  I eat fermented foods probably three or four times a day with every meal.
[01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:31.530]  Um, but definitely something you want to work your way up into doing.
[01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.410]  Don't just start off with the big old bowl of sauerkraut.
[01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:38.370]  Especially out in the woods with your friends.
[01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:41.810]  But it sounds like a horrible recipe.
[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:42.310]  Wow.
[01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:44.890]  Well, let's just balance that out again.
[01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:50.210]  I think to, to kind of bring it back is, um, you know, if you choose just, um, if,
[01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:54.610]  if you get to the level of autophagy, cause that's where that starts to recycle.
[01:45:54.610 --> 01:45:58.410]  It starts to bring back that balance so that when you do start to add the good
[01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:03.330]  ferments, there's not such a war going on in your stomach where you just feel
[01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:07.650]  uncomfortable, um, and that can happen for days sometimes when you're first
[01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:08.750]  getting into this kind of stuff.
[01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:13.150]  So the, the, the better approach I feel like is to just start, you know, if.
[01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:15.310]  Just stop eating basically.
[01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:20.310]  Um, and, and, and drink water and focus, um, and, and, you know, do it for as long
[01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.710]  as you can.
[01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.030]  So if you stop at 8 PM, try to make it to eight, eight, um, 8 AM the next day.
[01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.830]  Right.
[01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:29.750]  And then every hour that you're able to achieve past that 12 hour mark, um,
[01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:33.910]  you're, you're going to be killing a lot of this stuff that is causing issues.
[01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:38.230]  Um, like when, when you eat food and you just feel tired all the time and all that,
[01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:42.110]  that is all from the, the microbial life in your gut is not there.
[01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:48.590]  Um, like, like Alexa articulates way better than I do on, on the reasons why,
[01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:52.190]  um, your body can heal itself and you get a new body every seven years.
[01:46:52.190 --> 01:46:53.950]  So go down that rabbit hole.
[01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.390]  Cause I think that's pretty cool as well.
[01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.430]  Yeah.
[01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:58.390]  Just a quick note on that.
[01:46:58.470 --> 01:47:03.270]  Um, I don't, I don't necessarily think that there's, um, bad or pathogenic
[01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.390]  microbes in our gut.
[01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:09.230]  I think there's just an imbalance or overgrowth of certain, um, microorganisms.
[01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:16.350]  So yes, in, in some cases the fasting, um, will reset the microbiome and, um,
[01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:22.310]  allow it to come into balance, but you'll want to re-inoculate with, um, fermented
[01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:26.750]  foods, um, after you do that, if you are experiencing some kind of, um,
[01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:28.870]  health issue, um, in that regard.
[01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:32.150]  Brian, do you listen to Huberman Lab at all?
[01:47:33.230 --> 01:47:33.750]  I do not.
[01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:36.110]  I think you'd be interested in that show for sure.
[01:47:36.190 --> 01:47:39.590]  He's got a great episode on fasting and the microbiome and whatnot.
[01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.750]  Awesome.
[01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:46.070]  And I think most people suffer from the, the yeast aspects and there's a variety
[01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:49.550]  of them, but that's, that's what I guess was getting at more of like trying to get
[01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:54.070]  rid of something that's, there's such an overgrowth usually that you can tell
[01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:57.750]  that, um, you know, if you have a gut, I mean, that's usually there's just so
[01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:00.230]  much yeast, there's a lot of cortisol.
[01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:04.430]  A lot of these things are affecting you and, um, you know, go down that rabbit
[01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:05.910]  hole, especially if you don't feel good.
[01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:10.190]  Cause, um, I promise you it health is wealth, man.
[01:48:10.190 --> 01:48:14.270]  And you know, two, three years ago, I don't think I felt nearly as good as I
[01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.830]  feel now.
[01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:17.230]  And you would think in life that it would be reversed.
[01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:20.990]  Like each year you're getting up there, things are starting to break down and
[01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.710]  fall apart.
[01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:25.750]  Um, but it's the, the reverse for me is starting to feel, I'm starting to feel
[01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:26.030]  better.
[01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:29.670]  There's less probably arthritis and all that shit here.
[01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:33.750]  And I think that's the beauty of the human microbiome.
[01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:38.510]  Um, is that no matter how bad it's damaged with time, it can heal itself.
[01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:40.550]  Absolutely.
[01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:44.430]  We are, we have self healing, um, abilities.
[01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:54.030]  Um, you know, regenesis is the nature of life and, um, you know, self healing.
[01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:57.470]  Nature of life.
[01:48:57.830 --> 01:49:03.750]  And, um, you know, like we like to say, composting is proof of life after death.
[01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:06.830]  And, um, I don't know where I was going with that.
[01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:12.830]  I forgot, but I think it's amazing that like our soil, you know, we got a four
[01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:16.630]  by four bed or whatever, four by whatever your size, your container is.
[01:49:16.630 --> 01:49:16.910]  Right.
[01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:20.270]  And Brian says it's a lot like that soil is like your gut.
[01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:26.350]  And it's crazy how like that probiotic benefit works for the soil, just like it
[01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:28.070]  does in our body, you know what I mean?
[01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:30.670]  And we can use a lot of the similar things, you know?
[01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:34.990]  So that's like, if any, that's another huge takeaway, you know, if anybody's
[01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:38.310]  going to learn anything, it should be thinking about their gut as like their
[01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:42.830]  internal soil, you know, and tending to your terrain, tending to your internal
[01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:48.590]  soil and, uh, looking at the Bokashi bucket or the sauerkraut jar, you know,
[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:52.710]  as the bioreactor, same as our stomach, you know, that's what we put the biology
[01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:57.710]  into, we put the organic matter into biology cycles it and creates nutrients.
[01:49:57.870 --> 01:50:00.110]  I'm like, that's how nature works.
[01:50:00.110 --> 01:50:02.230]  Everything needs to be cycled through the biology.
[01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:08.470]  So like when you can, you know, pre-digest your food and, uh, the crock,
[01:50:08.710 --> 01:50:13.750]  you know, make your sauerkraut and your bioreactor, which is essentially like a
[01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:15.430]  stomach outside of your stomach.
[01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:17.630]  And then you eat that pre-digested food.
[01:50:18.230 --> 01:50:22.390]  One, you have all the acids and enzymes, everything that Alexa was talking about
[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:26.230]  that these plants are, that these microbes have created through their secondary and
[01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:31.470]  tertiary metabolites, but also you have all the nutrients from the food that are
[01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:36.550]  now way more bioavailable, you know, just like the worm eats food and then poops it
[01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:39.470]  out and it's like 11 times more available, something like that.
[01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:40.750]  Same thing happens.
[01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:43.590]  Like the, the nutrients are more available to us because they've been
[01:50:43.590 --> 01:50:45.270]  predigested by this biology.
[01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:51.590]  And like, there's just so many levels to why this stuff is so, you know, important
[01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:55.550]  for us, but like it ends up being less taxing on our metabolism because it's
[01:50:55.550 --> 01:51:00.070]  already predigested and now we don't need to work as hard to digest it because a lot
[01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:01.630]  of that work's already been done for us.
[01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:07.190]  And so, yeah, thinking about nutrient cycling everywhere and looking at these
[01:51:07.190 --> 01:51:11.510]  things like your bioreactor and like, this is what got me into the regenerative
[01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:16.030]  lifestyle instead of, you know, just trying to grow good ganja is like realizing
[01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:19.110]  that I couldn't make good compost with the food that I was eating.
[01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:22.950]  And so like I needed to start eating more fruits and veggies and preparing my food
[01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:27.630]  at home more and like sitting with my meal and actually, you know, getting onto
[01:51:27.630 --> 01:51:33.590]  that parasympathetic, relaxed nervous system and actually assimilating the food
[01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:36.270]  that I'm eating, you know, it's like, it's, it's never just one thing.
[01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:38.070]  It's, it's all of these things combined.
[01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:41.790]  Uh, it's cool stuff.
[01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:48.030]  There is no real difference between us, the plants and the animals on this planet.
[01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:52.630]  When it comes to biology and how a cell divides, you have to have the biology and
[01:51:52.630 --> 01:51:57.550]  the building blocks, our gut biome is one, the soil is the other.
[01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:59.070]  Just think of it that way.
[01:51:59.910 --> 01:52:04.710]  And even, even as far as children, Brian, don't be afraid to let baby girl get in
[01:52:04.710 --> 01:52:06.470]  the dirt, play a little bit, man.
[01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:11.310]  Those are things that kind of build you up from a young age, you know what I mean?
[01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:16.990]  And you see it a lot of youngins these days, they got a lot of, uh, um, allergic
[01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:20.350]  reactions to everything, allergic to this, allergic to that.
[01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:24.070]  Whereas when I was younger, we not as many people were as allergic to things.
[01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:27.990]  And I think it attributes to like, we played outside a lot, man.
[01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:31.150]  Like a lot of people these days, they sit inside a lot.
[01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:34.830]  So, um, you know, to me, those things are important.
[01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:39.870]  Let the baby sit in the dirt a little bit in a nice forest or in a nice park and, you
[01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:44.470]  know, sit there and just take it in, you know, breathe in those microbes.
[01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:45.150]  It's important.
[01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:45.910]  Yeah.
[01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:47.790]  That first three years is imperative.
[01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:50.790]  That's all the inoculation that you get pretty much.
[01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:54.670]  So like Alexa was saying, like eating these fermented foods, it's not like
[01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:58.950]  necessarily inoculating your gut with new diversity, but it might be like a
[01:52:58.950 --> 01:53:01.790]  bio-stimulant and feeding the diversity that's already there.
[01:53:02.190 --> 01:53:05.470]  But like you get all your diversity in the first three years of your life.
[01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:07.350]  And so that starts with birth.
[01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:11.430]  And I know we've talked about this on the show before, but like, um, now, like
[01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:15.590]  once you get pregnant, once a female gets pregnant, they're given an OBGYN, which
[01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:20.150]  is a surgeon, and so all these surgeons are pushing more and more C-sections,
[01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:25.750]  you know, and so like you're bypassing that biological process that's taken
[01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:30.710]  eons, you know, in the making and in doing so, like you're getting rid of
[01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:33.630]  that initial inoculation between the mother and their child.
[01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:37.550]  And so now like we're waking up to this and there are, you know, cool or
[01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:42.510]  progressive hospitals that if they are still doing, um, a C-section, they'll
[01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:46.710]  do like a vaginal swab and, you know, inoculate that baby with the mother's
[01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:50.270]  biome still, but like, it's so important to be thinking about all this stuff.
[01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:52.830]  And that's the same exact thing with the endophytes and the seeds.
[01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:58.270]  And so like biology has used the same, you know, processes
[01:53:58.550 --> 01:54:00.150]  to inoculate the offspring.
[01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:04.350]  And so like the mother plant encodes the endophytes, the living bacteria and
[01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:06.350]  fungi inside of the shell of the seed.
[01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:10.270]  And so as soon as that seed germinates, that plant has the microbes that it
[01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:14.390]  needs, that remembers where it was bred, that remembers its parents, you know?
[01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:17.790]  And so it's like another way that we can make these relaxed plants is, you
[01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:22.070]  know, by breeding our own seeds and, you know, germinating them and growing
[01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:24.070]  them on that property, in that same soil.
[01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:28.870]  Because those endophytes remember the intentions that you put into that plant.
[01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:30.510]  They remember everything.
[01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:33.430]  They remember the bad stuff, the drought, they don't know how to like get over that.
[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:36.950]  And so it's like, it's so much more biointelligent and you're going to be,
[01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:41.110]  you know, so much more advantaged than buying F1 seeds every time from, that
[01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:44.270]  were bred in Rockwool out in Cali and you're trying to grow them outdoors in
[01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:46.430]  Michigan, like it doesn't make any sense.
[01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:51.990]  Like we need, uh, there's such a rant, but like, we need to be focusing on, uh,
[01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:54.870]  the inoculation of everything and these biological processes that
[01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:56.670]  have taken eons to evolve.
[01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:57.070]  You know?
[01:54:57.070 --> 01:55:02.350]  And so like, that's the trouble with all this stuff is we try to bypass these
[01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:06.470]  biological processes that take time in the name of convenience, but there's
[01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:08.310]  always a price to pay for convenience.
[01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:12.070]  And like, that's what we're discovering across the board with what we've been
[01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:16.430]  doing to our soil, the processed foods that are ready, you know, right off the
[01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:19.710]  shelf, like sure it's convenient, but you're going to end up paying the price,
[01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:22.230]  you know, down the road to some extent, you know?
[01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:25.990]  Um, so yeah, inoculate your baby.
[01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:28.990]  Um, I know there's time and place for C-section and whatnot.
[01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:33.270]  Um, if you do have to go that route, inoculate, do the vaginal swab, but then
[01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:36.910]  that first three years of that baby's life, get them out in healthy soil,
[01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:41.230]  get them in the compost, you know, if they have a pet, that's a huge difference.
[01:55:41.230 --> 01:55:44.470]  If it's an indoor, outdoor pet, that makes, this all makes a difference.
[01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:48.710]  And so like, you don't want to raise your baby in a sterile environment, just the
[01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:52.750]  way you don't want to, you know, pop these seeds in a sterile Rockwool cube and
[01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:53.630]  disadvantage it.
[01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:57.430]  Like you want to give them the beneficial microbes that they need to co-evolve
[01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:58.710]  with right from the get go.
[01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:00.430]  Cool.
[01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:01.110]  Yep.
[01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:07.350]  I, what Chandler's just mentioned, I think a lot of us in Colorado, when we first
[01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:09.830]  got into this is exactly why we failed.
[01:56:10.150 --> 01:56:11.910]  We were getting everything from California.
[01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:16.710]  Cause that was all the rage when we, at least when our group got into it.
[01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:22.110]  So we're taking, um, you know, genetics that thrive out there in that environment
[01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:25.870]  and bring them into an environment where humidity is, you know, almost you have to
[01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:26.550]  pay for it.
[01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:27.430]  It's so dry.
[01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:29.310]  You got to buy the humidifiers and stuff.
[01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:34.630]  So understanding your environment and all of that, and understanding where these seeds
[01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:37.310]  are grown, no one thought about that back then.
[01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:41.390]  So what he just offered the community right there, I don't want anybody to kind of
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:43.150]  miss, miss over that.
[01:56:43.150 --> 01:56:47.590]  Or, you know, you said it was a ramp, but I, to me, that was gospel, uh, because you
[01:56:47.590 --> 01:56:52.630]  could waste six months to a year, uh, growing these genetics that look great out in
[01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:53.550]  their environment.
[01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:57.790]  And then when you put them in your environment and you're a brand new farmer, it's
[01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:59.990]  not, you're not going to get the same results.
[01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:01.910]  It's just not, that's not how it works.
[01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:06.630]  Um, and that's why there's such an artwork to this is because it's very hard to grow
[01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:09.630]  the high, high end stuff that everybody wants.
[01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:12.310]  And just real quick on the C-section.
[01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:15.550]  I know that is a sore spot for some people and it does save lives and everything.
[01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:20.590]  Definitely not trying to, you know, push any sore spots, just, you know, pushing the
[01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:21.870]  importance of the inoculation.
[01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:24.750]  If you do have to go that route, you know, it's not the end of the world.
[01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:29.350]  Even if, you know, if you were born via C-section, you know, don't feel bad about
[01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:30.710]  yourself or anything like that.
[01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:32.630]  You know, it's just moving forward.
[01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:35.150]  What can we do to, you know, not fall into these?
[01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:36.110]  What can we learn?
[01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:41.910]  You're lucky to be alive if you're, you know, back in the day, you wouldn't have made
[01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.990]  it.
[01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.830]  Absolutely.
[01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:44.350]  Potentially your mother wouldn't have made it.
[01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:48.230]  So, yeah, there is a time and a place, but I get what you're saying as well.
[01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:53.270]  And a caveat to that, what I learned is most modern moms right now don't want to
[01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:58.590]  breastfeed. So when, you know, my wife and I decided, you know, obviously that that's the
[01:57:58.590 --> 01:57:59.510]  way we wanted to go.
[01:58:00.110 --> 01:58:05.310]  Most of the people, when we interact in the health community, are taken back by it.
[01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:08.830]  I mean, it's a rare thing, which I hope more individuals really.
[01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:12.510]  And it's all corn based, the formula.
[01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:14.950]  I'll do the ingredients for a nightmare for sure.
[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:17.190]  But raw milk.
[01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:18.310]  Sorry.
[01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:19.750]  Yeah, raw milk.
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:22.550]  But the government tells everybody that's so scary.
[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:24.310]  Like you could potentially die from that.
[01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:25.350]  You know, right.
[01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:26.790]  They're real big on that.
[01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:30.790]  Like if I think there was a farm in Boulder that was trying to do that and the
[01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:36.150]  government swooped in, I think it might have even been like upper echelon type like
[01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:42.190]  agencies, not just like the local law enforcement, because they were, you know, they
[01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:46.510]  shut that down real quick where from what I understand, as long as protocols are taken
[01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:50.350]  care of, it's like when you eat an egg that hasn't been refrigerated.
[01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:53.790]  Exactly. There's a reason why you can do that without getting sick.
[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:57.150]  There's such this blanket fear of all microbes.
[01:58:57.150 --> 01:58:58.510]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:58:58.670 --> 01:59:03.670]  And like there's, you know, a couple outbreaks of listeria back in the day, you know,
[01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:07.390]  from improper, you know, like like the milk hose in the manure or whatever.
[01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:08.750]  It's like, yeah, let's not do that.
[01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:10.390]  Let's try to be a little bit cleaner about it.
[01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:13.510]  But like, yeah, there's loopholes now in every state.
[01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:16.630]  Like you might need to go buy raw milk from a pet food store.
[01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:22.310]  You might need to like in Michigan, you just have to have a CSA and like own part of the
[01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:24.350]  herd or whatnot. You own a share of that.
[01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:29.510]  And so that's what I have. I just got a goat milk share, unpasteurized raw goat milk.
[01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:32.950]  And I've been drinking that for a couple of months now and just absolutely feeling
[01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:38.670]  incredible. And like it's insane what happens during the pasteurization process to
[01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:44.270]  milk. You denature and lose so many of the nutrients as well as all the biology.
[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:47.830]  And like you end up with like this lifeless, you know, pus.
[01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:50.230]  I'm like, it's not worth drinking at that point.
[01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:54.070]  But like you get it fresh from the source and it's full of those nutrients, full of the
[01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:57.470]  microbiology, like fucking ready to go.
[01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:58.750]  But and.
[02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:03.510]  Yeah, there's so much to it, but that's another great probiotic source.
[02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:07.310]  And if you don't have access to that, then there's ways of fermenting your dairy as
[02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:09.350]  well. And like making kefir is huge.
[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:15.830]  It's like now you have that biodiversity where it was previously, you know, in there is
[02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:16.370]  lifeless.
[02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:19.550]  Breast milk to me.
[02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:21.870]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:24.550]  Breast milk, I think, would be obviously at the top.
[02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:28.870]  And kefir, if you've never played around with that, if you've got a worm bin, throw that
[02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:33.110]  in there real quick and see how quickly the life starts to take off.
[02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:37.150]  You'll be taking a shot for yourself, you know, the next day or whatever.
[02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:40.710]  And again, that matter that the quality matters with that, too.
[02:00:40.710 --> 02:00:43.950]  So you'll look at it and you'll be like, what the fuck?
[02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:49.430]  But if you buy the goat's milk, you know, if you have to go to a store, it's worth of it
[02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:54.070]  seems like it's four more dollars than like the life way stuff that's super branded with
[02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:55.070]  sugar and all that.
[02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:57.710]  I remember that the goal is health here.
[02:00:57.710 --> 02:01:02.750]  So it might not taste the best to you if you're used to like sugary things, but you want to
[02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:05.790]  go on flavor, you know, less sugar with with this.
[02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:08.470]  And everything commercial has sugar in it.
[02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:11.670]  So, you know, let's get to the level that he's at.
[02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:17.230]  I've not buy it at like Whole Foods or something and put 90 days.
[02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:22.150]  I think 90 days is really where you have to get at to really it affect your life.
[02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:23.710]  That is that's the number.
[02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:25.070]  Wifey always says that.
[02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:28.910]  Yeah, because anybody can do anything for a month, two months.
[02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:33.070]  And I always noticed that, too, when I would hire employees, it's like, man, the first
[02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:34.150]  month they are dialed in.
[02:01:34.190 --> 02:01:39.470]  Now I understand why the big corporations give you a 90 day referral thing is after 90
[02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:43.470]  days, man. Most people are like, I got I got to go away this weekend.
[02:01:43.590 --> 02:01:44.110]  You're true.
[02:01:44.110 --> 02:01:45.030]  I've only been here.
[02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:47.910]  Yeah, in reality, you only been here a couple of weeks.
[02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:50.430]  Like I think people forget that real quick.
[02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:55.270]  90 days is a short, really short term when you're talking about, you know, you've if
[02:01:55.270 --> 02:02:00.510]  you basically trash your body, it's going to take a while to get back to where it needs
[02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:04.470]  to be. But you'll forget how good it used to how good you used to feel.
[02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:10.830]  And that's the shining star beacon of this is that if you put in the time and effort of
[02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:14.670]  I would say at least 90 days, you'll see the difference.
[02:02:15.190 --> 02:02:19.750]  You'll know you'll you'll there'll be a noticeable difference in the way that your body
[02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:24.830]  is, the way that your body handles things as you eat and the elimination of things.
[02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:28.950]  I mean, all the gross stuff that you can Google on your own time that happens from that.
[02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:31.430]  You know, the body can take care of itself.
[02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:36.590]  So as long as you give it the proper nutrients and the amount of time needed, you can heal
[02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:38.630]  yourself for literally pennies.
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:43.470]  I mean, if you're thinking of that way as Kiefer or lab or something as medicine, then
[02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:49.870]  you know, it's pennies compared to buying all the pharmaceutical pills and and that kind
[02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:50.070]  of thing.
[02:02:53.670 --> 02:02:56.950]  Another quick thing about the mother's milk is anandamide.
[02:02:57.110 --> 02:03:03.390]  That's a cannabinoid and endocannabinoid that babies get from their mother that's present
[02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:04.870]  in the best in the breast milk.
[02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:09.230]  And so that's key to your endocannabinoid system development and all that stuff as well.
[02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:13.110]  It's like that's another thing that a lot of us ganja growers should probably be more
[02:03:13.110 --> 02:03:15.150]  versed in is the endocannabinoid system.
[02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:19.630]  And like another great thing to look into on your own time, for sure.
[02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:23.110]  Thank you, mama, for that good breast milk.
[02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:24.270]  Absolutely.
[02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:25.870]  Absolutely.
[02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:29.390]  It's important. Hey, guys on the C-section thing.
[02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:33.390]  Listen, I'm not I'm not a for or against whatever, but I will say this.
[02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:40.590]  They are apt to go C-section quick, man, like nowadays, it's like everybody we know
[02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:43.150]  having kids is like seem like it's all C-section.
[02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:45.030]  Dude, literally. It's like, all right.
[02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:47.110]  May 5th at three thirty.
[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:48.590]  This baby will be born.
[02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:52.670]  Like what happened to motherfucking letting the baby come out when it's time?
[02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:54.550]  Like that must have missed me.
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:56.550]  I got missed on that part.
[02:03:56.550 --> 02:04:01.070]  But like, you know, natural birth when the baby comes out is ready.
[02:04:01.110 --> 02:04:03.390]  Now they schedule everything, whatever.
[02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:06.990]  You got a little ran on that.
[02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:08.390]  Now you're right, man.
[02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:10.350]  And we just had a baby four months ago.
[02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:14.030]  So, you know, OK, three months ago for me.
[02:04:14.670 --> 02:04:16.430]  Three months. So congratulations, Michael.
[02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:18.510]  Oh, congrats. You got a boy or a girl?
[02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:20.550]  A girl. Oh, yeah.
[02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:21.670]  Girl. Yeah.
[02:04:21.670 --> 02:04:24.070]  Girl, too. Daughters are the best, man.
[02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:26.550]  I got two daughters.
[02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:27.990]  What's up?
[02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:29.950]  That means you were a player if you get a girl.
[02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:31.950]  Oh, shit.
[02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:36.270]  No, man, but, you know, they do.
[02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:38.470]  And I think, you know, if anyone's pregnant right now
[02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.910]  or going to get pregnant and go through all that, you know,
[02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:43.110]  it's a lot of stuff to sort out.
[02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:45.710]  And, you know, there's
[02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:48.510]  obviously a lot of value in meeting with medical professionals
[02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:50.790]  and having them evaluate you and tell you, you know, your plan.
[02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:53.870]  But, you know, you got to advocate for yourself, too, if things are looking
[02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:57.350]  pretty normal and you want to try natural things, you know, you can.
[02:04:57.350 --> 02:05:00.110]  And but, you know, like you guys all said to like, thank God
[02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:02.110]  we have some of these medical interventions, you know, they're
[02:05:03.110 --> 02:05:03.990]  they're pretty amazing.
[02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:07.390]  But but yeah, man, my wife, shout out to my wife, too.
[02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:11.550]  She had the baby in the jungle in Hawaii, natural and at a birthing center.
[02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:15.750]  And so it was probably the most amazing thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.
[02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.550]  So now we're talking micro.
[02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:22.550]  That baby's well coated with micro.
[02:05:23.110 --> 02:05:24.110]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[02:05:24.110 --> 02:05:26.430]  My four year old stays pretty, pretty healthy, too.
[02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:27.750]  And, you know, we get her out in the dirt.
[02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:29.070]  She's playing seeds all the time.
[02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:29.950]  She knows compost.
[02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:32.270]  You know, she's she's in them.
[02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:33.470]  And I mean, who knows?
[02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:35.990]  You know, I think it's because of all that, you know, but.
[02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:39.430]  Mm hmm. Yeah, that's important.
[02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:44.230]  All right. So I think we were on fermentation because we
[02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:47.790]  you guys topics are so awesome that we like hit one and then go,
[02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:49.910]  you know, and we go on down a rabbit hole.
[02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:52.350]  So fermentation, I really love fermentation.
[02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:57.310]  Now, if you guys do vinegars as well, we count vinegars as a ferment as far as that.
[02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:59.830]  Or we're going to do an apple cider vinegar.
[02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:02.190]  OK, yeah, you just say, all right, great.
[02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:07.070]  And I love my vinegars because whenever I make a nice FPGA or FFJ,
[02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:08.790]  I don't want to waste that sugar.
[02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:11.230]  So it's like a vinegar for sure.
[02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:17.070]  Um, sure. That's probably a good way to do that is the FPGA in there
[02:06:17.070 --> 02:06:21.230]  and then making the the scrap vinegar from that two for one.
[02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:24.150]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:25.790]  But yeah, there's an apple tree on the property.
[02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:29.470]  So we're going to have people, you know, go collect their apples for the apple cider vinegar.
[02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:31.590]  There's autumn olives all over.
[02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:35.230]  So, you know, go wild, craft some autumn olives to flavor our kombucha.
[02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:37.990]  There's grape leaves hanging in all the trees.
[02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:41.590]  So you can go grab that and, you know, pack down the pickles for the
[02:06:41.710 --> 02:06:45.950]  the lacto ferment of the cucumbers and like just all the stuff of,
[02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:49.990]  you know, going and finding stuff in nature and putting that in your ferment.
[02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:52.190]  It's muscadine season, too.
[02:06:52.190 --> 02:06:54.790]  I've been picking some muscadines wild.
[02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:58.030]  What was it? Muscadines and scuffling on grapes.
[02:06:58.430 --> 02:07:00.750]  Oh, yeah. Here. If y'all don't have them up there,
[02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:04.390]  we get these wild grapes called muscadines this time of year. Really good.
[02:07:05.630 --> 02:07:08.950]  Marco, when you're making that vinegar, are you doing like double the amount
[02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:12.630]  you get off the off the FPGA or off the FFJ?
[02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:15.590]  FFJ or when you make your vinegar?
[02:07:16.190 --> 02:07:18.790]  Yeah. So I take like if the scraps are like a
[02:07:19.150 --> 02:07:21.750]  I don't like to do more than like four to one.
[02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:26.590]  So if I got like, you know, that much scraps and I'll go four times the water
[02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:30.430]  so it doesn't get too weak of a vinegar, if you try to stretch it out too much,
[02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:32.430]  you kind of get a little weak vinegar.
[02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:35.310]  Right. I just made my first batch.
[02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:38.310]  I have I've made them for years, but I've never taken the vinegar step.
[02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:40.750]  But I just finished out a strawberry and a banana.
[02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:45.310]  And I did like, you know, double what I got out of the FPGA or the FFJ
[02:07:45.630 --> 02:07:48.110]  and in water, you know, and it turned out pretty good.
[02:07:48.150 --> 02:07:49.350]  It tastes really good.
[02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:51.310]  But yeah, it's delicious stuff.
[02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:54.350]  And, you know, it's like you get the residual nutrients
[02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:56.350]  still in the strawberries or whatever you have.
[02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:58.790]  So I mean, you can't beat a good vinegar.
[02:07:58.790 --> 02:08:01.430]  Nah. And that process is pretty nice, too, man.
[02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:04.430]  You get to plant food and then at the end of it, you get a vinegar for your plants
[02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:07.150]  or for cleaning or for your gut or all of it.
[02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:10.350]  And then you're just so much more connected to the food that you're cooking.
[02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:13.070]  And it makes, you know, cooking more fun to toss a splash
[02:08:13.070 --> 02:08:15.230]  your homemade vinegar in there and reduce it.
[02:08:15.230 --> 02:08:17.150]  It's like, oh, man, this is incredible.
[02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:18.950]  You can't buy anything like this anywhere.
[02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:21.710]  You know, like that's exactly it's like
[02:08:22.710 --> 02:08:25.470]  it'll be kind of closing all of your loops.
[02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:26.270]  You know what I mean?
[02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:30.510]  Like food wise and everything kind of like the best scenario.
[02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:33.670]  I think a little bit at a time.
[02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:36.870]  Definitely. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:41.630]  So I saw you guys are allowing the community to vend and sell to each other
[02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:42.790]  and that kind of thing.
[02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:46.150]  And obviously, Marco and I like that.
[02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:47.830]  You know, that's part of our bread and butter.
[02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:52.310]  You know, it's community kind of, you know, supporting you and that kind of stuff.
[02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:54.870]  So how did you guys kind of set that up?
[02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:58.430]  Are people allowed to bring their own gear and sell that?
[02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:00.230]  Do they need to
[02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:03.550]  buy a special ticket or a vending booth to be able to accomplish that?
[02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:04.310]  Can you explain that?
[02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:07.230]  So there's a little bit more of a cost if you want to vend,
[02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:11.430]  but you have the option to set up all day throughout the whole entire weekend
[02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:12.350]  if you'd like.
[02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:16.190]  But we definitely encourage everybody to be a part of the demos
[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:17.870]  because that's a big thing.
[02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:22.070]  You go to a lot of these events and it's like, OK, my friends presenting over there,
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:23.790]  you know, way over on that stage.
[02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:26.270]  But I'm stuck at my booth, you know, trying to make money.
[02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:31.510]  And you kind of miss out on the education part that you wanted to be there for.
[02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:35.350]  So like the options there, if you just want to be at your booth,
[02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:38.150]  you know, selling stuff all day long, feel free.
[02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:40.510]  But we definitely encourage most vendors to be,
[02:09:40.590 --> 02:09:42.910]  you know, part of the group throughout the day.
[02:09:43.110 --> 02:09:47.070]  And then we have the separate section allotted for for vending.
[02:09:47.150 --> 02:09:52.830]  And but during the vending section, which I think at 430 to 10,
[02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:57.590]  people can bring in like their samples of their compost
[02:09:57.590 --> 02:10:00.190]  and their IMO and stuff that they've made.
[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:03.710]  And we're going to be doing a microscopy demo and, you know,
[02:10:03.710 --> 02:10:06.350]  checking out under the scope and showing it on the screen
[02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:09.670]  and pointing out certain microorganisms and all that stuff.
[02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:11.950]  See what what cultures that you guys are growing.
[02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:14.750]  And so that's another fun, interactive way.
[02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:17.430]  I know there's a lot of people super proud about their compost
[02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:20.990]  and don't have a scope or they want Alexa and Mike to see it
[02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:22.870]  and give them their report card.
[02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:26.190]  So, yeah, super excited about that.
[02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:31.550]  And then our buddy, Microgenerative, is going to be doing a demo
[02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:36.550]  on inoculating each trees that have been diseased with the beach blight disease.
[02:10:37.230 --> 02:10:39.150]  He inoculates those with lion's mane.
[02:10:39.150 --> 02:10:42.070]  And so like all these, you know, massive trees are dying.
[02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:46.590]  We can actually get a fruit of incredibly delicious, nutritious,
[02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:51.910]  valuable mushrooms that, you know, could possibly be another passive income,
[02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:54.590]  could be food source, et cetera.
[02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:57.150]  And so it's just a way to utilize these trees
[02:10:58.230 --> 02:11:00.790]  as they're on their way out and, you know, honor them,
[02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:05.990]  take the energy that they've produced for the past hundred years and whatnot.
[02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:10.030]  So I guess what's really cool about getting into like the mushroom medicine
[02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:12.910]  is realizing that it's actually like the tree medicine
[02:11:13.110 --> 02:11:15.630]  and realizing that that's like actually like the earth medicine.
[02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:19.430]  And so you get this little tincture of mushrooms, but you don't realize
[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:21.430]  it's like a thousand years in the making.
[02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:24.710]  You know, it's like that tree was 100 years old and it was,
[02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:26.950]  you know, mining all the nutrients from the soil.
[02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:32.110]  And the soil has been turning into itself for eons to create, you know, what it is today.
[02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:37.430]  And so like now you have this majestic tree that it falls in half.
[02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:39.430]  You know, it's starting to die.
[02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:42.870]  It has this open wound and these spores that are flying throughout the air.
[02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:46.990]  They're opportunistic and they find that open wound and they inoculate that tree.
[02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:52.590]  And then this mushroom pops out of this tree, this beautiful, you know, reishi or chaga,
[02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:55.310]  whatever pops out of the tree.
[02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:59.230]  And it's just absolutely gorgeous, catches your eye as you're walking through the woods.
[02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:04.830]  And now we have the power as humans to take that and, you know, give your respect,
[02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:06.750]  return something to the forest.
[02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:10.750]  Of course, we're not out there to just take from the forest.
[02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:15.350]  But like now we can take that mushroom and process it into a bioavailable form.
[02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:20.550]  And like that is so, so medicinal for us because, you know, we're all of this earth.
[02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:22.150]  We've all been co-evolving together.
[02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:24.870]  And like that's like ancient tree.
[02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:27.190]  That's ancient earth medicine right there.
[02:12:27.190 --> 02:12:33.830]  And like, I know this is another just look into mushrooms, people like that shit will change your life.
[02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:35.270]  Mushrooms are incredible.
[02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:44.190]  Fungi has its own kingdom and it doesn't have like any university, like no university has its own school of like fungi.
[02:12:44.190 --> 02:12:49.910]  You know, they have all different programs for all the different animal kingdoms, plant kingdom, you know.
[02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:51.630]  But nobody's focusing on fungi.
[02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:58.150]  And like we're about to unlock so much cool shit once we have all these really smart people discover this stuff.
[02:12:58.710 --> 02:13:04.030]  Once we all are citizen scientists and like get more into paying attention to fungi and to nature.
[02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:09.390]  Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing that you kind of broke it down that way.
[02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:17.070]  And if you think about if you eat a mushroom that grows on an old tree or inoculated tree, you are getting the age of that tree.
[02:13:17.070 --> 02:13:21.230]  And then not only that, the eons of age in the soil.
[02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:24.350]  So that's why that mushroom is so powerful.
[02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:29.270]  Absolutely. And it's more than just the saprophytic ones, too, that are decomposing stuff.
[02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:33.870]  It's the mycorrhizal ones, even morels, which are super popular up here.
[02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:37.910]  Everybody likes morels, even if you don't like other mushrooms.
[02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:42.710]  But like nobody pays attention to the fact that that's like a mycorrhizal relationship.
[02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:44.950]  And what benefits are we getting from that?
[02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:48.110]  And like those are incredibly medicinal as well.
[02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:52.590]  Like, yeah, when I lived in Indy, man, it was like morel season.
[02:13:52.590 --> 02:13:57.590]  Like when like when everyone knew it, like it was morel hunt was on.
[02:13:57.590 --> 02:14:00.150]  Like everybody be going out in the woods and going for morels.
[02:14:00.150 --> 02:14:02.950]  That was the first time I really ever heard of living out there.
[02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:08.430]  And then, yeah, man, it's crazy how like the mushroom can be like that.
[02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:14.870]  You know what I mean? It's like it it trains us to find it and to eat it in a way.
[02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:15.790]  You know what I mean?
[02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:21.510]  And and that's probably another step in its own evolution is for us to digest it
[02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:24.190]  and then it go back out in another form.
[02:14:24.230 --> 02:14:25.630]  That's pretty crazy, man.
[02:14:25.630 --> 02:14:29.030]  Exactly. And then you get into the psilocybin and inoculating our minds.
[02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:32.630]  And, you know, literally like those mushrooms made me a spokesperson
[02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:37.630]  for the mushrooms, you know, I'm I'm conveying their ideas, you know, through.
[02:14:37.630 --> 02:14:38.990]  You're talking for them.
[02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:41.550]  Exactly. And so like that shit.
[02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:45.310]  So, you know, same thing with cannabis.
[02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:49.590]  You know what other plant has people growing it in every country,
[02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:54.190]  every closet, every basement around the world, every weather, you know,
[02:14:54.830 --> 02:15:01.310]  what that plant talking to us as a communication that plan is making us work for it.
[02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:04.830]  And that's a that's a pretty awesome, you know, relationship there.
[02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:05.630]  When you think about it.
[02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:09.550]  100 percent. And yeah, we've been you know, people have been
[02:15:09.550 --> 02:15:11.710]  dedicating their lives to Ganja forever.
[02:15:12.110 --> 02:15:15.350]  And that's so important to treat your plants with respect.
[02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:20.590]  And there's accounts out here that brag about waterboarding their plants every day
[02:15:21.070 --> 02:15:24.070]  and like just making money off of these clones.
[02:15:24.070 --> 02:15:26.070]  And like, oh, man, it's so sad to me.
[02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:30.070]  Like, we really need to get back into honoring the spirit of this plant
[02:15:30.070 --> 02:15:34.630]  and being in tune with all plants, but especially one that we're using
[02:15:34.630 --> 02:15:38.710]  so intensively to, you know, make money off of, make a living off of like
[02:15:39.710 --> 02:15:41.910]  yeah, there's a lot of respect that needs to go back to that.
[02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:47.830]  I think that's probably why you're having the drum circle on Friday night, I would suspect.
[02:15:48.990 --> 02:15:53.550]  That's just another way to to get all of the community together
[02:15:53.550 --> 02:15:57.430]  and, you know, to put some good vibes out into the air for the microbes.
[02:15:57.430 --> 02:16:01.510]  And if there's water out there, we'd be, you know, drumming over the water, too,
[02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:04.910]  and just sending out these good vibrations for all of these microbes
[02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:08.910]  and for all the land spirits, all the IMO, you know, letting them know that we're here
[02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:13.390]  and putting good intention into what we're doing and, you know, being happy to be alive
[02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:16.670]  and to be celebrating and to be a part of this community.
[02:16:16.670 --> 02:16:19.030]  You know, like Brian said, we're not here for a long time.
[02:16:19.150 --> 02:16:20.950]  Like, let's enjoy this shit.
[02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:28.750]  Yeah, something like really interesting there, Chandler, you and I were talking about is that,
[02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:35.710]  you know, how microbes can feed off of these different frequencies and light waves that
[02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:42.950]  we're not able to see. And, you know, something interesting I've heard lately is that
[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:49.030]  rocks emit photons and can feed different microorganisms.
[02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:54.470]  So microorganisms can use these frequencies as energy.
[02:16:54.510 --> 02:17:01.590]  And when we sing and play music, we can awaken these dormant
[02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:06.710]  microbes in the soil and in our bodies.
[02:17:08.390 --> 02:17:14.670]  So, yeah, I guess something I've been saying lately is, you know, you can build soil with a song
[02:17:14.670 --> 02:17:15.670]  and a dance.
[02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:20.830]  Energy, frequency, vibration, Nikola Tesla.
[02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:25.830]  You want to understand the universe, you got to think about all that invisible stuff.
[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:27.070]  And we don't like to do that.
[02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:32.870]  We are very focused on the material and we've taken, you know, the invisible woo woo
[02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:35.350]  stuff for granted. But that's what runs the world.
[02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:42.070]  And we need to get back to focusing on vibrations and frequency and all that type of stuff as well.
[02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:47.910]  So who's hosting the drum circle?
[02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:50.590]  I think I'll probably leave that one.
[02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:52.110]  Right on.
[02:17:53.470 --> 02:17:56.950]  And then we're having the song and seed and spore swap.
[02:17:57.510 --> 02:17:59.990]  Song, spore and seed swap, I think we're calling it.
[02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:02.990]  Beachside song swap, yeah.
[02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:09.030]  Yeah, so the Third Coast Herbal Collective does the song and seed swap, seed and song swap.
[02:18:09.550 --> 02:18:15.110]  And we just had to add that spore in there because we got such a mycology community here as well.
[02:18:15.550 --> 02:18:16.710]  That is cool.
[02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:18.390]  That is totally cool.
[02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:22.670]  Yeah, for sure. So and that's, you know, it's more than just seed spores and songs, you know,
[02:18:22.670 --> 02:18:23.830]  trade whatever you're proud of.
[02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:29.030]  You can bring your plant medicine, you can bring your crafts, your arts, you know, anything that
[02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:34.950]  you're willing to trade that you're proud of, you know, bring it and try to barter and try to, you
[02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:40.350]  know, make some friends. We're also going to have, you know, stickers if you're cool with sharing
[02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:43.750]  your name, which I get not everybody's cool with that and whatever.
[02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:48.910]  Respect, you know, I'm not trying to push anybody's boundaries, but like a lot of these
[02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:54.070]  conferences I've been to, it's like I realized that I was talking to somebody that I'm friends with
[02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:59.150]  on Instagram and I didn't know them at all, you know, and it's like, well, what a waste.
[02:18:59.150 --> 02:19:00.230]  Like, I wish I would have known.
[02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:03.990]  Like, we've had conversations for years that we should have talked about, you know, I'm like, so
[02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:08.390]  we're going to have Hello, My Name Is, and put like Fandler and underneath the Jethouse Gardens.
[02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:10.070]  I'm like, boom, there you go.
[02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:14.110]  And now we're building community and putting a face to the name and all that stuff.
[02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:15.830]  So I think that's super important.
[02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:17.190]  Yeah, that's important.
[02:19:17.430 --> 02:19:22.550]  An event like this, man, to me, instead of vending, it'd be more like bringing things to barter.
[02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:25.990]  You know, you want to be kind of involved walking around.
[02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:28.910]  If you have some things, bring them and just kind of trade them up.
[02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:35.830]  Focus more on kind of sharing and getting and things like that probably than definitely because you
[02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:37.270]  wouldn't want to sit at your booth.
[02:19:37.630 --> 02:19:38.790]  That just sounds boring.
[02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:43.430]  I know, but I have had a couple of people actually hit me up and, you know, like they're looking forward to
[02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:46.230]  this weekend because they haven't had any other vending options.
[02:19:46.390 --> 02:19:49.630]  OK, I'm trying to justify the gas costs and all that stuff.
[02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:50.830]  So that's why I made it.
[02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:52.710]  You know, we will be open.
[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:56.990]  You know, we'll have an open area for vendors all day if you want to do that for sure.
[02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:59.150]  And it gives something for other people to do.
[02:19:59.150 --> 02:20:04.590]  You know, we're expecting over 100 people and maybe not everybody wants to gather around the demo as
[02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:05.590]  much as we'd like that.
[02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:08.870]  You know, we'll give them the option to walk around and do whatever during that time.
[02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:10.110]  So, yeah.
[02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:12.590]  We'll have our like food truck or something there.
[02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.990]  Yeah.
[02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:13.910]  People on their own.
[02:20:14.110 --> 02:20:14.710]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:17.070]  So we'll have a food truck, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
[02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:21.070]  But people definitely bring their own snacks and extra meals, extra water.
[02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:26.270]  We're going to try to stay on top of all that, always having fresh water and meals for everybody.
[02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:28.750]  But, you know, it's always nice to have a little bit of extra.
[02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:32.870]  And a lot of people have truly an abundance right now.
[02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:36.710]  This is a big farming community and like just a plethora of food.
[02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:38.550]  And so bring that stuff and let's share it.
[02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:42.150]  We're telling everybody, you know, bring your own plates, silverware, cups.
[02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:47.190]  You know, there's a lot of people pouring tea with herbs that they've grown and stuff.
[02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:47.910]  So bring a mug.
[02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:49.990]  But also, you know, water.
[02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:51.510]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:20:51.870 --> 02:20:58.990]  Bring on a spoon, you know, if you want to try a little bit of the OHN or whatnot, you know,
[02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:00.830]  that's essentially just a tincture.
[02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:05.310]  And so like you could take sample all these inputs and all that stuff, you know, it's like,
[02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:09.990]  yeah, bring your own silverware, bring, try to be as intentional as possible.
[02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.630]  Plan ahead.
[02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:12.910]  We're not trying to leave a ton of waste here.
[02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:14.510]  So, but we will have.
[02:21:15.310 --> 02:21:18.870]  Sorry, I just wanted to add in we have two grills, you know, just let people know.
[02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:20.510]  They're charcoal.
[02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:22.430]  So bring some charcoal, you know.
[02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:26.350]  Is there water on the property?
[02:21:26.350 --> 02:21:28.830]  Got any streams or creeks or anything?
[02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:31.830]  A light stream.
[02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:32.070]  Sorry.
[02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:35.270]  No shower set up or anything.
[02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:37.870]  And the stream's probably not good enough for bathing.
[02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:40.790]  But we are like five minutes from Lake Michigan and Torch Lake.
[02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:43.230]  And like you can go, you know, bring Dr.
[02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:46.510]  Bronner's or a natural soap and go clean yourself off in the morning if you'd like.
[02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:47.430]  Nice.
[02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:48.190]  For sure.
[02:21:48.350 --> 02:21:49.870]  Or make your own soap nut.
[02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.830]  Even better, man.
[02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:54.990]  And tallow and some wood ash.
[02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.590]  Right.
[02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:58.030]  Throw a little rose petal in there and clean up.
[02:21:58.310 --> 02:21:58.790]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.550]  Love it.
[02:21:59.550 --> 02:22:00.830]  Your EM1 ball.
[02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:02.470]  Don't forget your EM1 ball.
[02:22:03.470 --> 02:22:03.750]  Yeah.
[02:22:03.870 --> 02:22:05.910]  You can scrub yourself with the EM1 ball.
[02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:06.630]  Exfoliate.
[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:07.950]  There you go.
[02:22:07.950 --> 02:22:08.430]  I like it.
[02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:14.750]  Dude, literally after I made the, I have a picture that I got, I had a mask on, you know, it's probiotic clay.
[02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.950]  You know, I'm out there.
[02:22:16.350 --> 02:22:18.790]  They charge a hundred bucks for the, at the spa.
[02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:21.630]  Like my wife charges that she's an esthetician.
[02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:23.670]  She charges money for clay mask.
[02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:26.910]  And so we're been kind of like crossing paths now.
[02:22:27.390 --> 02:22:28.670]  Probiotic clay, man.
[02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:29.390]  Yeah.
[02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:32.990]  So we're kind of blending our, my thing and hers.
[02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:34.070]  So I think it's gonna be pretty cool.
[02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:36.670]  Masks by Marco.
[02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:38.510]  Masks by Marco.
[02:22:40.390 --> 02:22:41.550]  Oh no, no, no, no.
[02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:42.910]  She did.
[02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:47.870]  Hey, look, she had a, she had like a spider bite or something on her leg and she kept itching.
[02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:52.350]  I said, go get some of my raw vinegar, put some of that on and then stop the itch.
[02:22:52.350 --> 02:22:52.630]  So.
[02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.510]  Nice.
[02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:54.950]  Stuff works.
[02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:55.830]  Awesome, man.
[02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.390]  Yeah.
[02:22:57.390 --> 02:23:02.190]  I definitely utilize microbes in my hygiene routine too.
[02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:06.350]  I like to buy Chandler's compost to wash my hair in.
[02:23:06.350 --> 02:23:09.230]  Actually, it does great things for my hair.
[02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:13.830]  I have psoriasis on my scalp and bad dandruff and stuff.
[02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:16.710]  So it, it really helps that.
[02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:23.190]  And I've also read that you can take, I haven't done it yet, but you can use the
[02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:26.870]  Kombucha Scoby and use that as a face mask.
[02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:31.830]  You can just blend it up and apply that as a face mask as well.
[02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:34.630]  I'm sure adding the clay would be really beneficial.
[02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:39.310]  And what you're doing for your eczema or psoriasis, did you say psoriasis?
[02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:40.590]  Yeah.
[02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:41.230]  Yeah.
[02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:48.830]  I had a friend on Instagram and his partner had, would get terrible, like, not psoriasis,
[02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:49.590]  but the other one.
[02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:50.350]  Eczema?
[02:23:52.310 --> 02:23:53.070]  Eczema, yes.
[02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:54.150]  Eczema on the elbows.
[02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.870]  Very bad.
[02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:58.950]  And I had this, like a microbial product.
[02:23:58.950 --> 02:24:03.230]  I was trying to make a ball, a JMS ball, where they could just take this ball and
[02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:08.070]  drop it in water and it's kind of turn it to a microbial solution like JMS.
[02:24:08.590 --> 02:24:13.190]  And it worked pretty well, but what he did, he made one and actually soaked her
[02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:19.830]  elbows in this microbial solution and wrote me back and said, this works wonders.
[02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:24.070]  And so I think a lot of our issues are already solved.
[02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:25.110]  Problems are solved.
[02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:29.070]  We got to just find that micro, find that biology to do it.
[02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:33.350]  And I think, I think it had a lot to do maybe to like the acid bacteria in there.
[02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:34.750]  I'm not sure, but some people.
[02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.950]  Yeah.
[02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:38.790]  This shit's traced all the way back to Roman soldiers healing their wounds with
[02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:40.150]  essentially Bokashi.
[02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.750]  There you go.
[02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:47.230]  All throughout these cultures and like in Asia specifically, like they're so comfortable
[02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:50.550]  with fermentation and like we have a lot of unlearning to do.
[02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:52.270]  Freaks us out still.
[02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:56.790]  We can't get people to try a sip of delicious kombucha because they're afraid of
[02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:57.550]  bacteria.
[02:24:57.550 --> 02:25:02.550]  It's like, it's so insane to me, but yeah, it's such a imperative part to all of
[02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:03.950]  these cultures everywhere.
[02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:08.950]  And it's time to reconnect, you know, to nature, to ourselves, to our ancestral ways
[02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:11.390]  that we've lost, you know, literally in a couple of generations.
[02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.710]  Unlearning.
[02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:13.110]  Yeah.
[02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:19.350]  They made us forget, you know, even with me, like my wife, she'll go buy a kombucha.
[02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:22.310]  But then I'm like, here, I made the same thing.
[02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:28.230]  You know, it's like, it's just a mind thing, you know, and she's getting there now.
[02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:33.550]  But at first she wouldn't try any of my stuff, but now she's coming and getting it,
[02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:35.990]  you know, so it just takes time.
[02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:38.710]  Yeah, I definitely used to be that way too.
[02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:42.110]  I would like make ferments and then like not eat them.
[02:25:43.310 --> 02:25:43.630]  Right.
[02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:44.630]  Sure, it eats it's own.
[02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:45.150]  I've been there.
[02:25:45.790 --> 02:25:52.230]  The programming is deep, but yeah, it's this connection is the disease, like we've been
[02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.950]  saying.
[02:25:54.190 --> 02:26:00.870]  So it's really important to, yeah, reconnect with our microbiome because they're our
[02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:03.070]  co-evolutionary partners.
[02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:08.310]  You know, we wouldn't exist without them.
[02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:15.830]  And yeah, they regulate so many functions in our bodies, you know, we should we should
[02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:17.670]  really be honoring them.
[02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:25.670]  Alexa, I have one question, my dear, when Leighton was there visiting, did you take
[02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:29.710]  some of your compost and mix it in water for him and did he drink it?
[02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:39.030]  No, we did not, but yeah, we should have together, but we I know we have all done it
[02:26:39.470 --> 02:26:46.190]  separately and Chandler and I have done it together and I do drink compost extract from
[02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:47.030]  time to time.
[02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:52.510]  Just a tiny little sip is all you need for that diversity.
[02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:58.630]  And, you know, we are supposed to have protozoan in these higher trophic levels of
[02:26:58.630 --> 02:27:03.910]  microorganisms within our gut, but primarily they're absent.
[02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:10.550]  So, you know, you have to think about nutrient cycling is also happening within the gut as
[02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:17.590]  well. So if you have a really nice compost that has really good diversity, you can take
[02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:25.670]  a sip of that and yeah, inoculate with those microbiomes.
[02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:31.750]  They might not stick around for long, but like I said, they do provide a great function
[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:38.270]  while they're there. So like that quote from Sandor Katz earlier, we want to continue to
[02:27:38.590 --> 02:27:41.590]  inoculate with diversity.
[02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:48.390]  Well, he kind of got me because I told him I anybody I could find within a live compost, I
[02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:52.230]  climb into it and he's going, oh, that's a good old trade kid.
[02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:54.390]  It's like, oh, man, I got to do both.
[02:27:59.830 --> 02:28:06.070]  So you're saying, Alexa, like back when before our diets as people got kind of out of
[02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:11.150]  whack, that protozoa were actually imbalanced in our guts for the most part.
[02:28:11.710 --> 02:28:16.110]  Yeah, they you know, we this is something that Zach Bush talks about.
[02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:19.430]  So that's where I've heard it in and getting this from.
[02:28:20.430 --> 02:28:28.870]  But he has said that protozoa were in supposed to be we are supposed to have abundance of
[02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:35.790]  protozoa and these higher trophic level organisms like nematodes in our gut as well.
[02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:36.670]  So.
[02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:44.590]  So that would probably take us back to more plant based and more probably omnivore
[02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:50.030]  grabbing eating brood with dirt still on it, you know, kind of all those kinds of things
[02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:51.630]  that would have been going on.
[02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:53.190]  That's pretty that's interesting.
[02:28:53.390 --> 02:29:00.470]  Yeah, that is probably so high in fat and sugar would be difficult to keep that right for
[02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:01.270]  most people.
[02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:12.230]  Yeah, I guess I'm not exactly sure, but yeah, I think inoculating with protozoa, you know,
[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:14.190]  could be beneficial in some ways.
[02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:16.350]  Obviously, you know, we have no idea.
[02:29:16.350 --> 02:29:18.590]  This is nothing that's, you know, been studied.
[02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:25.030]  I know Leighton has, you know, tried to do some work on, you know, determining like soil
[02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:26.630]  size in the gut.
[02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:29.070]  But, you know.
[02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:31.790]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:33.390]  It's definitely important to be done there.
[02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:36.510]  But, you know, nature repeats itself.
[02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:41.790]  So you have to think if that's happening, you know, in the outer soil, that could also be
[02:29:41.790 --> 02:29:43.390]  happening in the inner soil.
[02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:50.830]  Yeah. And, you know, soil can be semi healthy, you know, without having every member, but
[02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:54.070]  it's going to be ultimately the healthiest with the most diversity.
[02:29:54.070 --> 02:30:00.590]  So we can't be healthy and maybe we probably could be healthier with different practices.
[02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:03.230]  It's all about diversity in the soil.
[02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:05.870]  It's all about diversity in our bodies as well.
[02:30:06.270 --> 02:30:06.870]  That's right.
[02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:16.990]  Yeah, and like we're supposed to be eating, you know, fresh foods that are covered in
[02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:18.590]  dirt and stuff.
[02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:20.510]  So who does it anymore?
[02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:25.910]  Literally nobody unless you have a backyard garden, like everything, even the organic,
[02:30:26.390 --> 02:30:28.830]  you know, veggie growers that I work for.
[02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:30.350]  I work for an organic farm now.
[02:30:30.350 --> 02:30:34.830]  They're the neighbors of Wormies and like they've got the best veggies in town, but
[02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:39.550]  they're washing it. You know, everything is clean and they're using peroxide and whatnot.
[02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:41.070]  And that's just the standard.
[02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:43.590]  And like, so now there's no microbiome.
[02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:45.870]  And it's more than the microbes.
[02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:48.550]  It's more than the nutrients, just like you're talking about with the soil health.
[02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:52.990]  It's like when you eat a plant, a veggie that you just plucked off the vine, you're
[02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:54.550]  eating that life force energy.
[02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:56.870]  You're eating the prana that's flowing through it still.
[02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:59.310]  And like you just cannot buy that on the shelf.
[02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:02.830]  Like it's like there's nothing like it.
[02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:04.750]  I love that, man.
[02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:10.030]  Aside from making sure there's no bird poop on it, like I love just grabbing fruit right
[02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:14.030]  out the garden, might have some dirt on it, splashed up from the bottom, just a light
[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:15.430]  wipe off and go, man.
[02:31:15.430 --> 02:31:20.030]  Exactly. Yeah, I always have dirt in my salad.
[02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:26.910]  That's the thing too, with fermentation is like I just made beet kvass.
[02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:31.230]  And like you want to leave the skin on the beet because you want that soil microbiome on
[02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:33.030]  there. You want a tiny little bit of soil.
[02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:36.230]  You don't want to scrub your cabbage before you make the sauerkraut.
[02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:37.510]  Like you want to use.
[02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:41.310]  And same with, you know, making these FPJs and everything.
[02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:45.550]  Everybody got into that fermented fruit juice and they started going buying mangoes and
[02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:49.630]  bananas from the store that, you know, were harvested before they're ripe in the first
[02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:51.630]  place. They were sprayed off.
[02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:56.230]  You know, who knows what chemicals they were used, their pesticides, etc.
[02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:57.470]  that they used to farm with.
[02:31:57.470 --> 02:32:01.790]  And like then they're washed and then put on a grocery store full of grocery store
[02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:06.790]  microbes. And like whoever sneezed next to it last night, you're not getting the soul of
[02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:11.030]  the plant. You're not getting the spirit of the plant and the IMO that you're supposed to
[02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:17.070]  be getting. So like it's taken the idea out of context and like misunderstanding the key
[02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:19.910]  part of it. Great point right there.
[02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:22.390]  That always, you know, burns me up.
[02:32:22.390 --> 02:32:24.190]  I'm always about use what you have.
[02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:26.310]  If you got something that kind of went bad.
[02:32:26.310 --> 02:32:32.270]  Yeah, use it. But don't you know, don't go with the intent of buying a Colombian bananas,
[02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:35.510]  you know, pineapple from Guatemala, things like that.
[02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:39.790]  You know, look for things growing here if you're going to do that and look as local to you
[02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:41.990]  as possible. So great, great point on that.
[02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:49.790]  Like that local, that local community and building that community and keeping it vibrant.
[02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:51.590]  We have to do that, folks.
[02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:53.830]  Absolutely.
[02:32:54.710 --> 02:33:00.470]  Sorry. It's like for the economy and all that stuff, like we teach, you know, support local.
[02:33:00.470 --> 02:33:05.510]  But like when we're talking about the IMO, like it's imperative that, you know, you leave
[02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:10.990]  that on the land and you work with the compost company that's close to you and like that
[02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:13.710]  type of stuff. I'm like, I don't know, I get it.
[02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:19.110]  And if you don't have a good compost company next to you, like you can get some wormy shit
[02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:23.950]  to you for sure. But like ideally, you know, everybody's making their backyard compost
[02:33:23.950 --> 02:33:27.830]  and like teaming with the indigenous microorganisms that are on their land.
[02:33:28.470 --> 02:33:29.310]  It's imperative.
[02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:34.830]  Yeah. You guys want to go on to Sunday here before we run out of time?
[02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:36.910]  We only got 27 minutes now.
[02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:40.270]  Let's do it.
[02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:42.910]  So, Alexa, you want to talk?
[02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:46.270]  Or Mike? Go ahead, Alexa.
[02:33:48.350 --> 02:33:50.670]  OK, so, yeah, Sunday.
[02:33:51.350 --> 02:33:52.350]  Are we on Sunday now?
[02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:53.670]  Yeah. Sunday morning.
[02:33:54.430 --> 02:34:01.830]  Sunday, we're kicking off with permaculture yoga with Ganjasthana and she will be going
[02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:10.510]  through the 12 tenets of permaculture and she will provide a asana for each of those
[02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:19.670]  tenets. And again, this is going to, with the intention of activating that
[02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:27.470]  parasympathetic nervous system so that we are able to go throughout the day and be
[02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:29.230]  connected with nature.
[02:34:29.350 --> 02:34:30.510]  Rise and shine.
[02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:31.430]  Got to get up.
[02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:33.270]  Got to get connected, get grounded.
[02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:38.550]  Yeah. Reset that circadian rhythm and look at the sunrise and the sunset.
[02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:40.910]  Like all this stuff is incredibly important.
[02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:46.950]  And looking at the stars at night and sitting around the fire and all these things like
[02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:52.630]  that have been with us for as long as humans have been around and like we've become
[02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:53.710]  separated from it.
[02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:56.990]  Like we're not supposed to sleep in an air-conditioned house.
[02:34:57.110 --> 02:35:00.350]  We're not supposed to sleep in an air-conditioned room every single night.
[02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:06.230]  We're supposed to get out and connect barefoot with Mother Earth and all this stuff.
[02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:11.350]  And I'm just so excited to share some of the things that have changed my life for the
[02:35:11.350 --> 02:35:15.710]  better with other people who are interested and other people who may have never heard of
[02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:17.710]  any of this, never thought of any of this.
[02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:22.590]  There's going to be, just like last year, so much momentum after this event.
[02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:24.710]  I'm super excited.
[02:35:25.710 --> 02:35:30.230]  I was thinking maybe you're going to crawl into that Hugelkultur on there, you know.
[02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:32.390]  I like it.
[02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:35.590]  So yeah, this is the Hugelkultur demo.
[02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:42.070]  And that's where we, you know, wrap in the hemp stalk inoculation, the biochar, all
[02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:47.550]  three composting demos that we're talking about and the chicken composting that Sean's
[02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:53.230]  talking about. All the fermentation and maybe if we find some stuff during the plant and
[02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:58.230]  mushroom foray while we're out looking for IMO and all this other stuff, we can toss
[02:35:58.230 --> 02:36:01.750]  that in there. If there's a log full of turkey tails, perfect.
[02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:03.550]  Toss that in the Hugelkultur.
[02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:07.670]  And it's just going to be wrapping up the whole entire weekend, all these things that
[02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:11.910]  we've learned, you know, consciously creating this Hugel as a group, which I mentioned
[02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:16.510]  earlier, if one person was going to be making a Hugelkultur, it would take them days and
[02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:17.630]  they'd be exhausted.
[02:36:17.630 --> 02:36:21.750]  But we're going to get this stuff done, the two-hour demo while we're having fun.
[02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:26.990]  And yeah, it's going to be a great way to wrap up the weekend.
[02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:32.670]  And then we'll create this mound and we're going to plant some perennials and whatnot
[02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:37.990]  in there. And so like now we can come check year after year and check on what we did,
[02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:44.670]  you know, in 2022 and like do stuff like that all over the 22-acre property every single
[02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:47.670]  year. People are going to want to come back and check up on things.
[02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:51.990]  We built this Hugel in 22 and here's a tree that I planted.
[02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:54.830]  You know, that's one of the most out of the Hugel.
[02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:56.790]  Felicimo.
[02:36:56.790 --> 02:37:04.310]  And the intent of so many people to have this great abundance in that Hugelkultur when
[02:37:04.310 --> 02:37:07.070]  you guys are building it, that's going to be amazing.
[02:37:07.470 --> 02:37:08.470]  Absolutely.
[02:37:09.270 --> 02:37:15.390]  Yeah, this property is a lot like what kind of a smaller version of my little vision on
[02:37:15.430 --> 02:37:18.190]  my property, you know, a place of teaching and learning, man.
[02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:20.470]  And I love I'm taking a lot of these ideas.
[02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:26.710]  I did a lot of my infrastructure, just me, you know, just I did it, built my Hugels.
[02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:33.350]  But now as I'm having my classes, I'm going to start having the class build things
[02:37:33.350 --> 02:37:35.830]  which will be permanent features of my property.
[02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:41.510]  And then, like you said, as we come back next year, next month or whenever, that's that
[02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:44.190]  Hugel we did. That's that pawpaw we planted.
[02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:45.390]  You know, things like that.
[02:37:45.390 --> 02:37:49.270]  I think that's what kind of is going to think that's what's going to give you that
[02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:50.430]  longevity, man.
[02:37:50.470 --> 02:37:52.550]  I think that's what's going to grow it.
[02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:53.790]  It's going to make it grow.
[02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:55.150]  And that's kind of what I want to do.
[02:37:55.150 --> 02:37:56.630]  So I like what y'all are doing.
[02:37:56.830 --> 02:37:57.830]  Perfect.
[02:37:57.830 --> 02:38:01.230]  Thanks, man. People have that personal investment in the property now.
[02:38:01.230 --> 02:38:02.230]  Yeah.
[02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:04.350]  And to see that shift, too, right?
[02:38:04.390 --> 02:38:05.830]  Like, see it all. We talk about it.
[02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:09.630]  We do it. And then down the road, hopefully we'll have some good results to back it up.
[02:38:09.630 --> 02:38:10.630]  Right.
[02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:13.510]  Definitely. And also see, hey, this isn't that hard.
[02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:15.390]  You know, I get get a few friends over.
[02:38:15.390 --> 02:38:20.430]  We have a few beers, have a smoke and get some Hugo going, you know, things like that.
[02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:23.790]  I'm going to go to my party, Marco.
[02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:27.950]  That's right. Whatever the party is, you know, each week you have a different party.
[02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:28.950]  You do something different.
[02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:30.790]  You know, it's just all coming together.
[02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:33.830]  Yes. So much easier with the community.
[02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:35.310]  And there's too many cool things.
[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:38.550]  You know, I got projects all over the house and everything.
[02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:41.990]  And it's like there's not enough time in the day for all the cool stuff that I want to do.
[02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:46.350]  Like probably means there's not enough time in my lifetime for all the cool stuff I want to do.
[02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:49.190]  You know, I'm like, I think humans need a tribe.
[02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:53.190]  And like we've been isolated a lot lately.
[02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:54.870]  And that's been terrible.
[02:38:55.350 --> 02:38:59.230]  And like we we need to get together and put our minds together.
[02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:00.350]  It's a common goal.
[02:39:00.510 --> 02:39:03.550]  Community, unity, unity.
[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:05.310]  That's the main part of that word.
[02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:13.430]  So then on Sunday night, you're actually having an open discussion panel on the whole weekend.
[02:39:13.430 --> 02:39:17.270]  Are all the speakers going to be up on stage to be asked questions?
[02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:18.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:21.630]  And other people that didn't get the chance to present or whatnot.
[02:39:21.630 --> 02:39:28.950]  And like that's the thing is there's so many, you know, educated people in our community that have a ton of experience and all the stuff.
[02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:33.550]  And like just because they're not teaching a class doesn't mean that they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:37.870]  So we want this to be a chance for the open discussion for everybody to chime in.
[02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:46.990]  And that being said, like even during the demos, like we want as many questions as possible to get as well rounded of like an understanding as possible.
[02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:56.310]  You know, so like if we've left something out and like, you know, that it's imperative to the message, you know, feel free to chime in respectfully.
[02:39:56.310 --> 02:39:59.510]  Absolutely. We don't want any know it all's or anything like that.
[02:39:59.550 --> 02:40:03.670]  But like, you know, let's have some respectful, open conversations.
[02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:06.470]  Absolutely. That's how we progress education over egos.
[02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:12.430]  Amen. It's pretty hard to have an ego when you're talking about mother nature.
[02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:17.550]  Like, what are you going to say? Like, I figured this out eight years ago.
[02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:19.790]  It's true.
[02:40:20.830 --> 02:40:21.830]  Not a race.
[02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:29.550]  So then the next one on Sunday at between three and four is your SeedSport and SongSwap.
[02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:34.390]  I think you were talking about that for on Saturday, but is that on the Saturday or is it supposed to be on Sunday?
[02:40:34.390 --> 02:40:36.750]  Oh, no, it's on Sunday. I might have misspoke earlier.
[02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:38.670]  But yeah, Sunday afternoon.
[02:40:39.430 --> 02:40:46.790]  There's a lot of musicians out there and a lot of people want to share a song and a lot of good things happen at the edge of your comfort zone.
[02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:54.790]  So hopefully by Sunday, you know, we're all feeling comfortable enough to share a song and, you know, it's no pressure, no judgment.
[02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:59.110]  But Gracie is a wonderful musician and this is her idea.
[02:40:59.110 --> 02:41:01.070]  She's this is like a tour of hers.
[02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:03.310]  I think we're like the sixth stop or something like that.
[02:41:03.310 --> 02:41:05.110]  But she's done it all over the state.
[02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:07.190]  And I've been to one of them at the Divine Pine.
[02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:14.670]  And it was awesome. You know, people sharing music, sharing seeds, sharing ganja, just having fun.
[02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:16.310]  What we're going to be doing the whole weekend.
[02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:21.870]  OK, for that wide open jam, brother, can you record that for me?
[02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:23.710]  Because that'll never happen again.
[02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:24.950]  I would love that.
[02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:29.150]  That'd be pretty sweet. And that's what's cool is we will have a videographer.
[02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:34.110]  And that's what Brian and Peter's donations went through.
[02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:41.910]  And all of our other amazing sponsors put money into this event for us to hire a really, really good videographer.
[02:41:42.270 --> 02:41:44.910]  Phil is going to record everything.
[02:41:45.350 --> 02:41:51.630]  He's got multiple cameras, a drone, you know, the whole shebang and put it and we'll be able to share it on this platform here.
[02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:55.710]  All of the demos, at least, are not going to be live streaming or anything like that.
[02:41:55.710 --> 02:42:01.510]  But we will record all the educational demos and have that for the world to see.
[02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:04.190]  Because as we all know, this is very important stuff.
[02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:07.110]  They don't want any gatekeeping or anything like that.
[02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:10.390]  It needs to be accessible to everybody because we need to be building soil.
[02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:12.870]  Like everybody needs to be doing it.
[02:42:13.430 --> 02:42:14.870]  What's the closest airport?
[02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:15.910]  What do you say?
[02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:17.790]  What's the closest airport there?
[02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:19.310]  Hell yeah.
[02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:23.150]  It's Traverse City Cherry Airport.
[02:42:23.390 --> 02:42:24.270]  Cherry Airport?
[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:25.230]  I can pick you up.
[02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:27.750]  It's 10 minutes away from my house.
[02:42:28.470 --> 02:42:29.590]  All right, I'm going to look.
[02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:32.030]  Now y'all, this sounds great.
[02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:35.110]  Talk to your wife, brother.
[02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:36.350]  Talk to your wife.
[02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:38.990]  I got to see what my time looks like.
[02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:41.070]  But definitely next year.
[02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:42.630]  But I'm going to go look at some flights.
[02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:43.230]  I'm going to see.
[02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.950]  But definitely.
[02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:48.350]  Hey, is there a place for the wives if they want to come where they just.
[02:42:49.070 --> 02:42:50.470]  My wife said she's going.
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:55.470]  But she's going to be in the tent with you or y'all going to get a hotel room?
[02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:57.190]  No, she's got a tenant.
[02:42:57.230 --> 02:43:00.310]  I told her if I go to this tent, so she's going to put her.
[02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.950]  We're like, right.
[02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:03.790]  Talk about getting out of your comfort zone.
[02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:04.710]  Yeah.
[02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:06.230]  So where's the scenario?
[02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:08.670]  There's a there's a winery down the road.
[02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:09.870]  Worst case scenario, you know.
[02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:10.790]  Shipwrecked.
[02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:11.710]  What's your luck?
[02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:13.270]  You want to get out?
[02:43:13.310 --> 02:43:13.790]  You know.
[02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:19.750]  And so we're working good here.
[02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:21.070]  Well, we'll go to the next one.
[02:43:21.070 --> 02:43:21.590]  The guy.
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:23.470]  Oh, I can't even pronounce that.
[02:43:23.470 --> 02:43:24.510]  Cannabis yoga.
[02:43:26.390 --> 02:43:27.030]  Yeah.
[02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:34.550]  So we did talk about this a little bit earlier, but Rachel puts on a ceremony
[02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:37.790]  to honor plant medicine.
[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:42.590]  You can you know, you can use any plant medicine, really.
[02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:48.350]  But we are going to be honoring the ganja plant during this ceremony and
[02:43:48.350 --> 02:43:51.670]  specifically the award winning tropical runs.
[02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:59.790]  And we really do want to pay homage to the cannabis plant because it has brought
[02:43:59.790 --> 02:44:01.390]  this community together.
[02:44:01.950 --> 02:44:09.710]  Really, like we say, like the cannabis is the gateway to regenerative farming.
[02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:15.550]  So we do really want to honor this plant for bringing us together.
[02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.750]  Absolutely.
[02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.750]  Thank you.
[02:44:21.350 --> 02:44:25.870]  So then I think I'm going to bring up these wonderful pictures of you guys, the
[02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:27.430]  actual speakers.
[02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:31.310]  You guys want to just name yourselves off Chandler?
[02:44:31.390 --> 02:44:33.750]  You know, Chandler Michalski.
[02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:36.030]  I'm on Jethouse Gardens and Wormies.
[02:44:36.430 --> 02:44:37.150]  Part of Wormies.
[02:44:39.710 --> 02:44:47.710]  Alexa, I'm Alexa, Organic Alexa and Hypha Grown.
[02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:51.590]  I think you're going to have to represent Rochelle Lowe.
[02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:54.030]  Rachel Carlavelle.
[02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:55.030]  Yeah.
[02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:56.110]  Carlavelle.
[02:44:58.270 --> 02:44:59.150]  And then we have.
[02:44:59.150 --> 02:45:00.350]  That's Austin Jocelyne, yeah.
[02:45:00.430 --> 02:45:01.390]  She's incredible.
[02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:03.110]  DemPure certified educator.
[02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:04.150]  Yeah.
[02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:05.950]  You got Mike there?
[02:45:06.390 --> 02:45:06.710]  Yeah.
[02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:08.710]  Mike Freund, Juliana Consulting.
[02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:11.510]  Your name means friend in German, by the way.
[02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:12.430]  It does, yeah.
[02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:16.150]  I always tell everybody that, you know, that's, I got to live up to my name.
[02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:17.910]  So if I'm not, you gotta let me know, man.
[02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:18.830]  That's right.
[02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:19.470]  Dude, I'm about.
[02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:20.390]  This is awesome.
[02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:23.950]  I'm about to start making candles because Chandler means candle maker.
[02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:25.670]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:29.710]  Start raising some bees first, but then Chandler's candles.
[02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:30.590]  It's coming soon.
[02:45:36.470 --> 02:45:36.950]  For real.
[02:45:39.350 --> 02:45:39.710]  Yeah.
[02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:40.590]  Keep going.
[02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:43.510]  John Duffy is a rising moon medicinals.
[02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:47.150]  Another DemPure farm in here is the first, uh, Dragonfly Earth
[02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:49.470]  Medicine certified farm in Michigan.
[02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:51.950]  And so he's led the way for the other.
[02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:54.830]  Five of them now to get certified.
[02:45:55.310 --> 02:45:57.630]  And, uh, yeah, more coming soon.
[02:45:58.150 --> 02:46:01.190]  So super excited to have a lot of DemPure certified
[02:46:01.230 --> 02:46:02.830]  farmers and educators involved.
[02:46:03.270 --> 02:46:06.950]  Uh, if any of you guys aren't familiar with Dragonfly Earth Medicine, I know
[02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:11.750]  everybody probably is, but, uh, check them out cause they're incredible people.
[02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:13.830]  Um, up to incredible things.
[02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:18.470]  And they've again done, um, so much for the community, bringing people
[02:46:18.470 --> 02:46:24.350]  together and focusing on regenerative because organic simply is not enough.
[02:46:24.430 --> 02:46:29.230]  There's a lot of organic farms out there that are owned.
[02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:33.830]  So like, you'll see like blueberries at the store that are like the same exact
[02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:38.550]  company you'll see, you know, package conventional, same exact company right
[02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:40.790]  next to it, organic for twice the price.
[02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:44.310]  Like they clearly don't give a fuck about soil health or, you
[02:46:44.310 --> 02:46:45.710]  know, any of the stuff that's right.
[02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:47.790]  They're clearly just focused on, you know, charging that
[02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:49.630]  higher price for the organic.
[02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:54.630]  And like, there's all sorts of stuff like that where, or these organic farms
[02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:59.950]  are still, you know, using plastic mulch and still spraying the organic pesticides,
[02:46:59.950 --> 02:47:03.670]  but it's still a very death-based approach and, you know, they're not
[02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:08.630]  teeming with the soil, they're not teeming with the microbes and like certified
[02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:10.630]  organic just simply is not good enough.
[02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:12.550]  And so like we need a better option.
[02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:16.190]  We need to know that people are regenerative and closed
[02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:17.390]  loop as much as possible.
[02:47:17.790 --> 02:47:23.030]  And so the D Dragonfly Earth Medicine certification is, it's a free certification.
[02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:24.510]  So like, there you have it.
[02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:28.750]  People aren't spending, you know, $10,000 just to get that label on there.
[02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:31.710]  It's like, they just got to prove that they're closed loop and they're doing
[02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:36.310]  the right thing, growing nutrient dense medicine and that is important.
[02:47:36.310 --> 02:47:39.910]  So we need a lot more farmers to get into that.
[02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:42.990]  And as of right now, it's pretty much only in the cannabis community.
[02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:47.030]  And so like, as much as we want this to be, you know, a ganja event and
[02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:48.750]  like, that's where, that's who we are.
[02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:49.870]  That's how this all started.
[02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:52.910]  Like, we also need to be accessible to everybody.
[02:47:52.990 --> 02:47:57.550]  And like, we need to get this message out to, you know, everybody, not just ganja growers.
[02:47:57.710 --> 02:48:02.390]  So that's how, that's the importance of like teaching these adults and teaching
[02:48:02.390 --> 02:48:06.830]  them how to teach their kids and, you know, teaching more than just ganja growers.
[02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:09.150]  We're working on that for sure.
[02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:13.070]  But it's also like, we just want to have fun with our friends and smoke weed too.
[02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.710]  So it's a tough one.
[02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:18.870]  And they are such wonderful humus beans, aren't they?
[02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:24.390]  And I think, you know, cannabis community does deserve the credit of pushing
[02:48:24.390 --> 02:48:26.070]  regenerative agriculture.
[02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:30.310]  I mean, I don't think there's any debate there.
[02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:31.150]  Yup.
[02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:33.070]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:38.670]  I always say cannabis growers are the best farmers in the world, you know, because
[02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:43.230]  we, you know, we push, we're pushing that envelope.
[02:48:43.230 --> 02:48:48.510]  We're, you know, a lot of farming is just try to just stabilize, you know, they got
[02:48:48.510 --> 02:48:49.430]  you locked in.
[02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:53.910]  Pretty much farmers are consumers of fertilizer.
[02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:56.470]  That's what a farmer mostly is these days.
[02:48:57.630 --> 02:49:02.430]  And so, yeah, as far as that goes, you know, cannabis, we definitely would want to be
[02:49:02.430 --> 02:49:03.390]  super clean.
[02:49:03.390 --> 02:49:04.990]  I think I can agree with that, man.
[02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:08.390]  We push that to the, to beyond organic, you know.
[02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:09.990]  I don't want to hear organic.
[02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:11.470]  I want to be beyond that.
[02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:12.550]  Absolutely.
[02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:17.030]  Yeah, we need to take it to a different level, that's for sure.
[02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:18.470]  For sure.
[02:49:18.470 --> 02:49:20.830]  It's the best, like when you ask, you know, is it organic?
[02:49:20.830 --> 02:49:24.950]  And they kind of like hesitate and they're like, well, this is like beyond organic.
[02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:26.990]  You're like, all right, you're my people.
[02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:28.910]  Like, you know.
[02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:37.350]  But yeah, after the ganjasana ceremony, we're going to have farewell and have the
[02:49:37.350 --> 02:49:42.590]  option to drive, I think it's like six to eight minutes or something down to Grand
[02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:47.470]  Traverse Bay. There's a state park there and that's part of Lake Michigan and just
[02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:53.110]  absolutely gorgeous sunsets over there on the West Coast and perfect way to close off
[02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:58.230]  the weekend and take a dip and do some cold water therapy and all that stuff.
[02:49:58.230 --> 02:49:59.830]  So I'm super excited.
[02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:05.870]  So you guys are going to be on the East Coast side of Lake Michigan.
[02:50:06.470 --> 02:50:10.870]  And then when the sun sets, is that that lake is so big, it looks like you're looking at the
[02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:11.710]  ocean pretty much.
[02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:20.230]  Yeah, so it's actually going to be a bay that we're looking at, a bay of Lake Michigan.
[02:50:20.390 --> 02:50:28.070]  But the bay is so huge that it looks like, you know, it's a part of this lake is massive.
[02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.430]  You know.
[02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:29.230]  Wow.
[02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:38.950]  Sorry, guys, I was just going to ask, do you want to give a shout out to your sponsor list at
[02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:39.350]  all?
[02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:40.510]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:42.910]  FCP.
[02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:46.030]  Huge thanks for sponsoring.
[02:50:46.030 --> 02:50:49.270]  I'm super stoked to get you guys some footage to put on this platform.
[02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:53.830]  But Wormies, you know, shout out to Wormies.
[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:55.390]  Love that place.
[02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:58.030]  Jet House, that's me.
[02:50:58.270 --> 02:51:00.430]  Tilth is a soil company out of Ohio.
[02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:09.350]  They're actually, they supply soil for HIFA and Ohio Fire Factory where Josh Steensland is
[02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:12.190]  working. And they're doing a bunch of cool stuff.
[02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:16.150]  But Bokashi brand, those are our buddies Mike and Isaac.
[02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:18.510]  They make fire bokashi.
[02:51:20.470 --> 02:51:22.270]  Herb Conscious, he's been around.
[02:51:22.270 --> 02:51:23.110]  He's in the community.
[02:51:23.110 --> 02:51:24.030]  It's our buddy Joey.
[02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:25.590]  Shout out to Joey.
[02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:28.550]  Terp Wizard's been on the show before.
[02:51:29.390 --> 02:51:30.510]  Absolutely great guy.
[02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:31.430]  Shout out to Connor.
[02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:34.350]  Invasive Tremor, our buddy Victor.
[02:51:34.390 --> 02:51:36.510]  This dude is fucking hilarious.
[02:51:36.510 --> 02:51:40.550]  He was just out there with the dab rig and the torch out in the middle of the woods, middle of the
[02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:42.350]  night, everywhere.
[02:51:42.470 --> 02:51:45.510]  Oh, just feeding people dabs all last year.
[02:51:45.950 --> 02:51:49.830]  Strangely Rooted, Ian.
[02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:54.870]  Good buddy. He makes bulk inputs.
[02:51:54.870 --> 02:52:01.910]  And so I bought like gallons of JADAM wetting agent last year from him and JADAM wettable
[02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:03.830]  sulfur. And so that's the thing.
[02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:08.910]  It's like a lot of the stuff is time consuming and, you know, you got to pick and choose how
[02:52:08.910 --> 02:52:10.990]  much time and energy you want to put into it.
[02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:11.550]  And so.
[02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:12.910]  Who was that again Chandler?
[02:52:13.310 --> 02:52:15.350]  Strangely Rooted, top left there.
[02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:16.550]  OK, cool.
[02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:22.230]  Stock up on a couple gallons of JWA from somebody else that made it.
[02:52:22.270 --> 02:52:23.830]  Save yourself all that time.
[02:52:23.830 --> 02:52:27.190]  Trade them with something, you know, like you usually have something to barter.
[02:52:27.430 --> 02:52:31.830]  But yeah, that's the importance of this community is like we're all doing a lot of this.
[02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:33.670]  We don't all need to do every single one.
[02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:37.550]  Now we can trade some of our inputs and make it easier.
[02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:40.870]  And I think you better answer this question for the people here.
[02:52:41.230 --> 02:52:46.390]  Yep. So like we said, it is a ganja friendly event, but we are open to having kids there for
[02:52:46.390 --> 02:52:48.830]  sure. We need to be teaching this to everybody.
[02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:55.510]  And we have to unlearn a lot of things as adults because our food system is really broken
[02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:57.510]  and our waste management system is fucked up.
[02:52:57.910 --> 02:53:03.670]  And like if we can teach kids from the get go and not have them have to unlearn these
[02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:07.070]  cultural norms and everything, then they have a huge let go.
[02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:11.350]  Landrace Indian, great dude.
[02:53:11.350 --> 02:53:16.430]  He's a salt grower, actually, but he's super interested in all of this stuff and keeps on
[02:53:17.470 --> 02:53:20.950]  putting money towards the cause because he appreciates what we're doing.
[02:53:21.310 --> 02:53:26.150]  And so that's awesome. And like a lot of people will talk down on salt grows and everything.
[02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:28.990]  And, you know, I've definitely been guilty of that in the past.
[02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:33.270]  But like everybody's trying and like you can't just generalize everything.
[02:53:33.390 --> 02:53:38.470]  And like but like it is really important to start to get those people conscious about what
[02:53:38.470 --> 02:53:40.790]  they're doing and trying to be more regenerative.
[02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:42.910]  And like they're still in the family.
[02:53:42.910 --> 02:53:44.390]  They're still in the family.
[02:53:46.350 --> 02:53:49.790]  Organicicle is another commercial composting place.
[02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:54.870]  They're more, you know, industrial, not making the highest quality compost, but they're
[02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:57.790]  diverting a ton of food waste from going to the landfill.
[02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:59.790]  And it's still a good product.
[02:54:00.310 --> 02:54:04.270]  And my beneficials is a new company this year.
[02:54:04.270 --> 02:54:07.110]  You guys have been in communication with him.
[02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:08.070]  I think he was on the show.
[02:54:08.470 --> 02:54:09.590]  Yeah, Mark was on.
[02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:13.230]  Yeah, Mark, I have yet to meet him in person, but I'm super stoked.
[02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:15.110]  We've been talking on Instagram for a while.
[02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:16.510]  So shout out to Mark.
[02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:19.950]  Brian, rubber ducky isopods.
[02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:21.790]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:24.990 --> 02:54:27.190]  Yeah, truly appreciate all the support, man.
[02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:31.470]  Rocky Mountain Fino Hunt, I think Rocky Mountain.
[02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:36.430]  Yeah. I have yet to meet him in person as well, but talking on Instagram.
[02:54:37.270 --> 02:54:38.430]  Super stoked to meet him.
[02:54:38.910 --> 02:54:39.390]  Murdoch.
[02:54:39.390 --> 02:54:40.350]  He's great at fire.
[02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.950]  Hell yeah. Yeah.
[02:54:41.950 --> 02:54:42.350]  You know him?
[02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:44.430]  Yeah. On Instagram.
[02:54:44.430 --> 02:54:45.190]  It's on my Twitter.
[02:54:45.390 --> 02:54:46.590]  Yeah. Nice.
[02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:49.070]  Murdoch Meltz. That's a friend of yours, right, Mike?
[02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:51.070]  Oh, yeah. Joe Murdoch.
[02:54:51.430 --> 02:54:54.710]  Met him back years ago when we had a dispensary in Travers.
[02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:55.230]  Great guy.
[02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:56.270]  Awesome.
[02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:58.390]  Then Earth Stayer there.
[02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:03.150]  Again, haven't met them in person, but they're posting all regenerative
[02:55:03.150 --> 02:55:04.710]  practices and everything online.
[02:55:05.230 --> 02:55:06.670]  Super excited to meet them.
[02:55:07.150 --> 02:55:09.110]  Botanic Organics is a friend of mine.
[02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:10.870]  Always at all the events.
[02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:12.790]  Makes really nice hash.
[02:55:13.230 --> 02:55:17.550]  So super stoked to stock up on some rosin here from Botanic Organics and
[02:55:18.430 --> 02:55:20.150]  Turf Wizard and Ohana.
[02:55:21.190 --> 02:55:25.270]  Everybody's making fire hash from regeneratively grown cannabis.
[02:55:25.270 --> 02:55:27.510]  And so that's awesome.
[02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:29.590]  Roots to Rosin.
[02:55:30.070 --> 02:55:31.470]  Again, don't know him in person.
[02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:32.430]  Talking online.
[02:55:32.750 --> 02:55:35.030]  Dharmic Garden is my buddy, Ben.
[02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:37.710]  Very excited that he sponsored this year.
[02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:42.270]  That's just kind of a stock photo from the regenerative cannabis.
[02:55:43.950 --> 02:55:46.870]  But I think that represents my friend, Michelle.
[02:55:48.030 --> 02:55:51.950]  What's growing on here is her ad on Instagram, and she's fucking awesome.
[02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:55.910]  She's got absolutely great energy and she can get on rants, you know, just like
[02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:58.630]  any of us, but she's like probably even better.
[02:55:58.710 --> 02:56:01.030]  Like she's got a great way of words with words.
[02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:02.350]  We love rants though.
[02:56:02.350 --> 02:56:03.030]  We love them.
[02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:05.230]  They're effective sometimes for sure.
[02:56:05.230 --> 02:56:08.150]  You got the right people listening and they're like, holy shit.
[02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:10.510]  Like there's so much I need to learn.
[02:56:12.350 --> 02:56:14.630]  Um, Willow Farm Labs.
[02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:18.230]  Again, I don't know them in person, but they were excited too.
[02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:21.750]  I think she's got like a Twitch channel or a live stream or something.
[02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:25.750]  And she like live streams microbes and like micro art and stuff.
[02:56:26.310 --> 02:56:27.550]  I'm super excited about that.
[02:56:27.550 --> 02:56:29.190]  We'll, we'll be sharing more info on that.
[02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.750]  Once we know.
[02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:32.190]  Uh, Danny Simon has been there.
[02:56:32.270 --> 02:56:33.590]  Uh, he was there last year too.
[02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:37.910]  Um, super into human health, regenerative agriculture.
[02:56:38.110 --> 02:56:44.230]  Um, you know, getting people off the vegetarian route and start eating grass fed
[02:56:44.270 --> 02:56:50.430]  beef again, which, you know, uh, helped me greatly, but, uh, you know, time and
[02:56:50.430 --> 02:56:52.030]  place for everything and whatnot.
[02:56:52.550 --> 02:56:54.430]  Uh, Covalent Coffee Roasters.
[02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:57.230]  Um, it's our buddy Elliot who was there last year as well.
[02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:58.230]  And.
[02:56:58.910 --> 02:57:03.070]  Uh, he's going to be roasting some coffee or he roasted some coffee this week.
[02:57:03.070 --> 02:57:05.230]  He's going to be selling some French press all weekend.
[02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:09.590]  And then Dutch Delight just hopped on, um, and sponsored the other day.
[02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:12.910]  And that's another, um, dispensary up in Northern Michigan.
[02:57:13.390 --> 02:57:15.630]  And so again, you know, probably.
[02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:20.990]  I guess I don't even know that their practices or everything that they're
[02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:24.830]  stocking on the shelves, you know, they might be selling salty weed too, but like,
[02:57:25.310 --> 02:57:29.310]  that's the thing it's they're showing the interest and I really don't know anything
[02:57:29.310 --> 02:57:29.670]  about it.
[02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:34.670]  Shouldn't even be speaking, but like, um, yeah, it's not all inclusive.
[02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:37.790]  It's not a, you know, we're not all region only.
[02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:42.110]  Like we want people that are skeptic or we want people that are curious, you know, to
[02:57:42.110 --> 02:57:42.630]  come as well.
[02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:44.510]  We don't need just a bunch of experts.
[02:57:45.390 --> 02:57:48.710]  You want everybody to listen and learn.
[02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:50.070]  That's what we all want.
[02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:51.070]  A hundred percent.
[02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.510]  Yes.
[02:57:52.510 --> 02:57:54.830]  And we have two premium sponsors.
[02:57:55.190 --> 02:58:00.670]  Um, Hypha is one of the premium sponsors as well as, um, Smokey Bear.
[02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:01.190]  Yeah.
[02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:07.070]  Smokey, the bear, uh, superior solventless, another hash Rosin guy makes absolutely
[02:58:07.150 --> 02:58:08.470]  incredible hash Rosin.
[02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:13.190]  And he's actually going to be at a different event in Southern Michigan this weekend,
[02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:19.630]  but, um, sends his regards, sends sponsorship money, and he's excited for the videos
[02:58:19.630 --> 02:58:20.430]  that we post.
[02:58:20.430 --> 02:58:22.110]  So shout out to both of them.
[02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:25.710]  Nice logo.
[02:58:26.350 --> 02:58:28.630]  Both of them for sure.
[02:58:29.350 --> 02:58:32.030]  So yeah, couldn't do any of this with all the sponsors.
[02:58:32.110 --> 02:58:36.950]  Um, you know, keeping it low cost for everybody, uh, including ourselves, you know,
[02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:42.630]  we're incredibly rich people, um, rich in every other sense of the word, you know,
[02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:47.670]  but, uh, we're trying to, uh, make this accessible.
[02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:48.350]  Absolutely.
[02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.350]  Yeah.
[02:58:50.350 --> 02:58:54.670]  When you put these things together, I don't think people realize that the costs that go
[02:58:54.670 --> 02:58:55.190]  into it.
[02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:59.630]  And I was talking to Marco a couple of days ago, you know, I put together something in
[02:58:59.630 --> 02:59:00.230]  Oklahoma.
[02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:01.070]  He was a part of it.
[02:59:01.430 --> 02:59:06.110]  Uh, you know, everybody that was, that was there lost money doing it, you know, and
[02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:08.910]  you have to obviously had to charge people to be there and all that.
[02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:13.470]  But, uh, the, the way that you guys are doing it out where there's, I guess, virtually no
[02:59:13.470 --> 02:59:14.630]  cost for the venue.
[02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:15.670]  Thanks to Michael.
[02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:19.310]  You know, you got your, your sponsors, your premium sponsors putting up all that.
[02:59:19.310 --> 02:59:21.030]  So the ticket sales can be low.
[02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:22.790]  So you guys are doing it the right way.
[02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:26.950]  And I think that's why so many people gravitated to what you're trying to put out
[02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:27.150]  there.
[02:59:27.150 --> 02:59:32.510]  And the fact that it's going to be up, uh, for the, in my opinion, the town square, uh,
[02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:35.310]  for the living site, living soil community is awesome.
[02:59:35.310 --> 02:59:37.430]  And that, um, you know, it'll be up there in time.
[02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:39.230]  Yeah.
[02:59:40.270 --> 02:59:41.590]  Rich and wealthy and all that.
[02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:47.110]  I mean, health is really well, I mean, the older you get, I mean, and Marco and I talked
[02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.830]  about this too.
[02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:54.030]  And in our own time, like you have nice things and you know, life still continues and
[02:59:54.030 --> 02:59:55.150]  then, you know, there's other things.
[02:59:55.150 --> 03:00:00.110]  And so it doesn't, it doesn't, uh, provide the same thing you, you think it was, you
[03:00:00.110 --> 03:00:02.390]  think it would until, you know, you've purchased it.
[03:00:02.670 --> 03:00:07.590]  So moving on in life and stuff, I think that's why the whole like metaphysical aspect
[03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:11.430]  of life and all of that intrigues me so much is because there's got to be more to
[03:00:11.430 --> 03:00:11.750]  this.
[03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:14.790]  And I think, uh, mushrooms is how you get there.
[03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:19.430]  You know, you gotta start thinking outside of, of where your current vision is.
[03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.350]  Yeah.
[03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:24.470]  You're smoking, go to the next plant to smoke, you know?
[03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.470]  Yeah.
[03:00:26.470 --> 03:00:30.470]  I really like mushrooms and weed, you know, cause there's such a different, when
[03:00:30.470 --> 03:00:35.430]  people say like, oh, I trip, uh, LSD and mushrooms to me, that's not saying apples
[03:00:35.430 --> 03:00:38.870]  to apples, but a lot of people kind of view it that way.
[03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.230]  Yeah.
[03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.710]  Yeah.
[03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:44.710]  I think all the powers in our brain already, man, it just has to be unlocked.
[03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:45.630]  It's already there.
[03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.430]  Yeah.
[03:00:48.430 --> 03:00:52.550]  I think like a, like a monk or something that dedicates their life to this, I bet they
[03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:57.950]  can probably turn on DMT trips or, you know, I'm sure they're enlightened through the
[03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:58.390]  roof.
[03:00:59.110 --> 03:01:03.830]  But sometimes if, you know, you're not at that level using a, I think it was Terrence
[03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:08.070]  McKenna that said it was, it's a crutch, but it allows you to kind of get there, uh, using
[03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.870]  psychedelics.
[03:01:09.430 --> 03:01:14.870]  30 years in the monastery or one good experience, you know, like I could get you the same
[03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:16.150]  place, but yeah.
[03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.390]  Right.
[03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:19.350]  I think it was Paul Stamos was talking about that.
[03:01:19.350 --> 03:01:26.550]  He had like a stutter and he was up in a tree during a huge lightning storm, um, high as
[03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:27.590]  fuck on mushrooms.
[03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:32.310]  Um, and he, you know, you can check out his, you know, he, he tells the story obviously.
[03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:37.830]  But I think that's something really unique to listen to that, you know, he basically
[03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:41.990]  scared the stutter right out of him, uh, being high as hell on mushrooms in a, in a
[03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.710]  lightning storm.
[03:01:43.270 --> 03:01:45.030]  So those things are unique.
[03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:48.790]  And I think, you know, don't you want to experience some of that shit in life?
[03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:53.030]  I mean, we're like, you already mentioned we're in AC all day and I feel that way,
[03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:57.590]  especially building more like a, you know, moving towards like, uh, you know, e-commerce
[03:01:57.590 --> 03:02:00.630]  and selling and making an income that way.
[03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:04.630]  It's a lot harder to get outside from back in the day when you'd be farming and forced
[03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:05.350]  to be outside.
[03:02:05.350 --> 03:02:05.830]  Yeah.
[03:02:07.190 --> 03:02:11.590]  And shout out to all those people doing like the guided, uh, mushroom events.
[03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:13.350]  You know, I think that's pretty powerful stuff.
[03:02:13.350 --> 03:02:18.070]  I have a friend who's got some pretty bad PTSD from a, there's actually an injection
[03:02:18.070 --> 03:02:19.270]  on a fighter pilot.
[03:02:19.270 --> 03:02:22.710]  He's a fighter pilot and he had a high speed injection and damn near died.
[03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:27.270]  But anyway, just adding to what you're saying, Brian, like those people doing that work,
[03:02:27.270 --> 03:02:28.390]  that's a huge thing, you know?
[03:02:29.270 --> 03:02:29.830]  Absolutely.
[03:02:30.550 --> 03:02:31.510]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:37.190]  I know we talk about that kind of stuff, uh, with 710 DP on Saturday, the Saturday mental
[03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:43.270]  breakdown and, and the PTSD and using a micro dosing, et cetera for that.
[03:02:43.270 --> 03:02:48.070]  So maybe have him, uh, you know, start watching that show because that's something we talk
[03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:49.990]  about every second Saturday.
[03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:51.110]  Cool.
[03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.430]  Yeah.
[03:02:51.430 --> 03:02:51.910]  Awesome.
[03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:57.190]  And, uh, you know, you mentioned Paul Stamets and I'd talked about stacking neither a lion's
[03:02:57.190 --> 03:03:02.790]  mane with psilocybin earlier, but, uh, Paul Stamets has what's called the Stamets stack
[03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:10.630]  protocol and he combines, um, psilocybin, lion's mane and niacin or vitamin B3.
[03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:15.030]  And I don't know if you've ever taken niacin to try to pass a drug test or anything and
[03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:19.910]  like gotten the niacin flushes, but like it kind of creates like an uncomfortable tingling
[03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:22.630]  sensation and, uh, like a rash.
[03:03:23.270 --> 03:03:24.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:27.590]  And so like, you don't want to take it, you know, when you're taking a big dose and going
[03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:31.510]  on a journey, but like when you're micro dosing around the house and whatnot, and you don't
[03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:36.310]  mind getting a little blotchy or itchy from, for like a half hour or whatever, like that
[03:03:36.310 --> 03:03:41.430]  niacin is basically like flushing the nerve growth factor, the neurogenesis, like out
[03:03:41.430 --> 03:03:43.910]  of your central nervous system into your extremities.
[03:03:43.910 --> 03:03:48.630]  And like, it's creating that potential to regenerate nerves all over your whole entire
[03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:49.190]  body.
[03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:53.510]  So like, this shit is imperative that we're all doing this as preventative maintenance,
[03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:58.390]  but like giving the stuff to our parents too, and our grandparents and like, you know, telling
[03:03:58.390 --> 03:04:02.630]  them, you know, like this is such a small dose and like experiment and like at least
[03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:06.630]  getting them on the niacin, or on the lion's mane, you know, they're not going to trip
[03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:07.190]  at all.
[03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:13.670]  But like, if you do have access to micro dose capsules, or, you know, mushrooms from a trusted
[03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:19.190]  source, you know, like, absolutely look into that and treat it with respect and start small
[03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.830]  and all that stuff.
[03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:22.070]  But like, this stuff is huge.
[03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:26.070]  And so like, we need to be eating the stuff for our brain health, and like to prevent
[03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:29.830]  Alzheimer's and dementia, all this crazy, crazy stuff.
[03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:35.030]  So like, huge potential through all this plant medicine, you know, it's far more than mushrooms,
[03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:38.950]  there's so much that we can learn from all of these incredible plants, and like, all
[03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:43.510]  this knowledge that's been taken away from us in the past 100 years or so, like, where
[03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:48.710]  would we have been, you know, if they didn't rob us of the knowledge of like herbalism,
[03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:51.750]  and you know, there's medicine growing in your backyard type thing.
[03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:53.670]  Like, where would we be?
[03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.870]  For real.
[03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:59.270]  So it's time to get back to the like, so much of this we have lost in literally like two
[03:04:59.270 --> 03:04:59.990]  generations.
[03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.790]  It's sad.
[03:05:01.350 --> 03:05:02.790]  We're gonna learn it back, though.
[03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:07.750]  It's thanks to people like us that are trying to reteach this stuff that they've made us
[03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:08.470]  all forget.
[03:05:08.470 --> 03:05:12.630]  And hopefully, we'll just keep doing it, passing the torch, keep growing.
[03:05:13.430 --> 03:05:20.310]  Camp Compost grows and grows, in 10 years is 200,000 strong out there.
[03:05:20.310 --> 03:05:23.830]  Just, you know, like just building.
[03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:25.750]  Wait, now look at Michael's face for that one.
[03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:28.710]  Oh, baby.
[03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:37.270]  Oh, yeah.
[03:05:37.270 --> 03:05:38.710]  You know, a uniform, man.
[03:05:38.710 --> 03:05:40.710]  Oh, yeah.
[03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:42.710]  That's right.
[03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:44.710]  Oh, I got shirts like that.
[03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:46.710]  Oh, damn.
[03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:48.710]  Everybody got shirts.
[03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:50.710]  Another way to support us.
[03:05:50.710 --> 03:05:52.710]  Nice.
[03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:54.710]  Shout out to Earth Grower.
[03:05:55.670 --> 03:06:01.670]  I'm telling my buddy that he's got a tactical company.
[03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:03.670]  Bad intentions, tactical.
[03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:12.950]  But yeah, Michael mentioned, you know, if you got some extra cash or whatnot donating,
[03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:15.830]  but we're also going to have merchandise for sale there, too.
[03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:20.230]  So if you do want to show some extra support, that's definitely another option.
[03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:23.270]  Did you guys make that logo into a hoodie?
[03:06:23.430 --> 03:06:25.430]  We haven't yet.
[03:06:25.430 --> 03:06:28.710]  Well, if you choose to, I'll be first in line.
[03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:30.710]  For sure.
[03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:34.310]  We could probably order some more and start shipping them, honestly.
[03:06:34.310 --> 03:06:37.830]  We kept it pretty small trying to sell out at this event, hype it up.
[03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:41.830]  But I think we'll be ordering merch throughout the years and whatnot.
[03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:42.630]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:43.830]  I'll order one for sure.
[03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:44.390]  Awesome.
[03:06:44.390 --> 03:06:45.430]  Fantastic.
[03:06:45.430 --> 03:06:47.430]  It'd be like a tool t-shirt or something.
[03:06:47.430 --> 03:06:49.750]  I'll be like, look what I fucking got.
[03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:51.750]  Ah.
[03:06:52.310 --> 03:06:54.630]  It's time for victory.
[03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:57.190]  All right.
[03:06:57.190 --> 03:07:03.430]  Well, three hours is a long time, especially when we have two new children in our lives.
[03:07:03.430 --> 03:07:04.230]  Right, Michael?
[03:07:04.230 --> 03:07:05.110]  Yes, sir.
[03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:06.550]  No sleep running.
[03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:11.270]  So I wanted to like, if there was like a couple, maybe do three questions, Ken, or something
[03:07:11.270 --> 03:07:13.030]  like that, if you want to run through those real quick.
[03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:15.510]  Always respect the audience as well.
[03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:19.510]  But I got a lot going on right now, especially for tomorrow.
[03:07:20.470 --> 03:07:22.950]  Okay, well, we'll do this one here.
[03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:30.070]  According to Matt Power's chat tonight, EM1 can replace sugar in FAA.
[03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:31.590]  Has anybody heard that one?
[03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:32.070]  Oh, yeah.
[03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:33.990]  Quattermock does this all the time.
[03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:42.230]  So you can do any of these, basically like your FPE or whatever, where you're taking
[03:07:42.230 --> 03:07:48.630]  like a young plant that's maybe just starting to bloom, and you use that as your transition.
[03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:51.590]  You're capturing the hormones of the plant.
[03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:57.990]  And so I guess specific to the FAA, yeah, you can use the EM, which has molasses, the
[03:07:57.990 --> 03:08:02.470]  sugar source, instead of sugar and get the same results.
[03:08:02.470 --> 03:08:05.750]  But it might actually decrease the time or whatnot.
[03:08:07.350 --> 03:08:10.630]  So instead of making, sorry, I'm all over right now.
[03:08:11.270 --> 03:08:20.630]  Instead of making FFJ with plant material and sugar, you can use the EM, just the same.
[03:08:21.430 --> 03:08:26.630]  But take that same principle of taking a young plant in its vegetative state and feeding
[03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:29.030]  that to a young plant in its vegetative state.
[03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:34.150]  And then taking stuff that's starting to bloom and feeding that to plants that are just starting
[03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:35.190]  to transition.
[03:08:35.190 --> 03:08:39.990]  And then taking fully developed, ripe fruit and feeding that to plants as they finish
[03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.230]  off.
[03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:42.950]  Like you can do all that with EM instead of sugar.
[03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:50.870]  But Mark, you're saying I can do an FPJ with the liquid from the EM1 instead of using the
[03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:51.270]  sugar?
[03:08:52.470 --> 03:08:52.870]  Yeah.
[03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:58.870]  And so like, basically, like, just like you expand EM, you do the same without adding,
[03:08:58.870 --> 03:09:01.590]  you know, EM, molasses, and water.
[03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:05.190]  But you can add plant material in there as well and just ferment it all.
[03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:13.190]  And then like you can even do this with like, you got like kelp meal or alfalfa or something,
[03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:15.670]  any of these meals that aren't bioavailable.
[03:09:15.670 --> 03:09:19.910]  And they're going to take, you know, time to get processed through the biology in your
[03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:20.630]  soil.
[03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:26.950]  You can use that external bioreactor, you know, your bucket and ferment these dry meals
[03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:28.390]  and make them plant available.
[03:09:28.390 --> 03:09:32.070]  So then when you apply them, they're bioavailable and ready to go.
[03:09:32.310 --> 03:09:34.310]  Yeah, I like doing that with blood meal.
[03:09:34.310 --> 03:09:36.710]  That's my fermented blood meals, a good one.
[03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:38.790]  High, quick nitrogen hit.
[03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:39.510]  Yeah, I bet.
[03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:46.150]  Okay, you're going to have to talk more to me about that, Connor, because I'm doing an
[03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:47.910]  event in October.
[03:09:48.470 --> 03:09:51.750]  And I haven't even heard of that yet.
[03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:54.390]  And I'm going to be talking about natural farming techniques.
[03:09:54.390 --> 03:09:56.230]  So we need to talk, okay?
[03:09:56.230 --> 03:09:56.790]  Yeah, sure.
[03:09:58.470 --> 03:10:00.550]  So I think we got one more question.
[03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:06.630]  What's the view on the HLVD chaos?
[03:10:06.630 --> 03:10:08.630]  I'll let Alexa take this one.
[03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:09.190]  What chaos?
[03:10:11.910 --> 03:10:12.870]  I'm sorry, what is it?
[03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:14.870]  The hop slate and the viroid.
[03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:15.350]  Yeah.
[03:10:16.470 --> 03:10:18.870]  Everybody's freaking out about dirty cuts.
[03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:20.070]  Hop slate and viroid.
[03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:25.510]  Eat probiotics instead of trying to maintain a sterile environment and stuff.
[03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:26.070]  Yeah.
[03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:28.390]  Dirty old cuts that have been around for years.
[03:10:28.470 --> 03:10:32.710]  Pop stuff from seeds and biologically intelligent soil and boom.
[03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:34.310]  What virus?
[03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:37.430]  Pop seeds, right?
[03:10:37.430 --> 03:10:38.790]  It's an imbalance.
[03:10:38.790 --> 03:10:41.430]  Stop being so attached to these cuts that are years old.
[03:10:41.430 --> 03:10:44.390]  And cannabis is not supposed to live that long.
[03:10:44.390 --> 03:10:49.350]  We're supposed to be breeding and improving the next generation and all that stuff.
[03:10:49.350 --> 03:10:50.950]  That's my personal viewpoint.
[03:10:53.430 --> 03:10:55.750]  Some people would not agree with that.
[03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:58.630]  There are some people that would not agree with that.
[03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:02.790]  I'm down for keeping a cut for a couple years for sure.
[03:11:02.790 --> 03:11:04.390]  But I don't know.
[03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:08.550]  Alexa, you were going to say something?
[03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:10.070]  Yeah.
[03:11:11.270 --> 03:11:12.230]  I don't know.
[03:11:12.230 --> 03:11:16.390]  I'm really not sure about the virus thing.
[03:11:16.390 --> 03:11:25.270]  I just don't really think it works like how most people think it does.
[03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:35.190]  And viruses, from my understanding, are a mechanism at which we're able to continue
[03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:37.030]  to adapt to our environment.
[03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:45.190]  So like I was saying before about horizontal gene transfer, viruses are the primary, I guess,
[03:11:47.910 --> 03:11:54.470]  messenger for the bacteria and for the horizontal gene transfer to occur.
[03:11:54.790 --> 03:12:00.630]  Viruses are constantly helping us adapt to our ever-changing environment.
[03:12:03.190 --> 03:12:07.270]  Is it possible for a plant to maybe be infected?
[03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:09.510]  I don't know if that's the right word.
[03:12:10.230 --> 03:12:10.950]  I don't know.
[03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:22.310]  I just really don't think viruses are anything to be afraid of or worry about in our bodies
[03:12:22.390 --> 03:12:25.030]  or for the plants.
[03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:36.310]  But yeah, again, I'm sure there are things with viruses where it could cause issues because
[03:12:36.310 --> 03:12:38.310]  really nothing's black and white.
[03:12:38.310 --> 03:12:44.390]  But I don't think it's as common as people see it.
[03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:46.150]  Gosh.
[03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:48.070]  I'm getting tired.
[03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:56.550]  We have cancer cells in our bodies, but until our body gets out of balance, they don't react
[03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:57.190]  in our body.
[03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:58.390]  They just sit there.
[03:12:58.390 --> 03:13:02.390]  Is that basically what is happening with a virus like the Hopslaten?
[03:13:02.390 --> 03:13:06.070]  Is our soil system and biology out of balance?
[03:13:06.070 --> 03:13:08.630]  And if it's back in balance, it wouldn't be there.
[03:13:09.670 --> 03:13:14.390]  That's what I would say to people about worrying about what you can control.
[03:13:14.390 --> 03:13:16.630]  Obviously, a virus is a big deal.
[03:13:16.630 --> 03:13:18.950]  If you get it and it devastates your garden, that's an issue.
[03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:21.270]  And you're going to be pretty upset about that.
[03:13:21.270 --> 03:13:26.390]  But if you focus on the things you can control, like having a lot of diversity in your soil
[03:13:26.390 --> 03:13:29.590]  and great biology, there's probably a good chance that your plants are going to come
[03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:34.950]  in contact with Hoplaten and not get it or not be infected in a way that's going to cause
[03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:36.310]  devastation to your garden.
[03:13:36.310 --> 03:13:41.430]  So I would say lean into the practices, lean into the biology, and you probably won't have
[03:13:41.430 --> 03:13:42.150]  any issues with it.
[03:13:42.470 --> 03:13:45.750]  Yeah, I agree with all these guys, ladies.
[03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:50.070]  That's why I say it's all about the biology.
[03:13:50.950 --> 03:13:51.190]  Yep.
[03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:55.030]  Like you said, though, Ken, I agree with you too, because with cancer, like you said, a
[03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:59.350]  lot of these disorders are in you and then there's something that triggers that disorder.
[03:13:59.350 --> 03:14:01.190]  And I think it could be the same way with plants.
[03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:08.390]  You keep that plant healthy, IMO, indigenous, everything, biology, swim, rolling, cruising
[03:14:08.390 --> 03:14:08.710]  along.
[03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:14.230]  I think that plant's healthier and less apt to show any kind of symptoms if there was
[03:14:14.230 --> 03:14:14.870]  something in it.
[03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:17.350]  100%, Marco, 100%.
[03:14:20.390 --> 03:14:21.830]  So you guys want to end it here?
[03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:23.110]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.190]  Yeah.
[03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:27.670]  Huge shout out to you guys for giving us a platform here today.
[03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:29.590]  Absolutely.
[03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:30.470]  You guys deserve it.
[03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:33.030]  You guys, blessings for what you're doing.
[03:14:34.230 --> 03:14:34.550]  Thank you.
[03:14:35.590 --> 03:14:36.630]  Yes, thank y'all.
[03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:38.630]  It was great talking to y'all, meeting y'all.
[03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:40.550]  Seeing y'all's faces, interactions.
[03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:41.270]  So this is great.
[03:14:41.270 --> 03:14:45.430]  Now we're kicking it on Instagram and we'll have that even much more, you know, to it,
[03:14:45.430 --> 03:14:45.830]  I think.
[03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:46.550]  So thank y'all.
[03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.710]  Yeah.
[03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:48.390]  Learned a lot from you.
[03:14:48.390 --> 03:14:49.990]  It's been an honor.
[03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.630]  Thank you too.
[03:14:51.270 --> 03:14:52.150]  Thank you.
[03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.550]  Awesome.
[03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:55.270]  Yeah, such an honor.
[03:14:55.270 --> 03:14:58.470]  Thank you to everyone, thank you to all the sponsors.
[03:14:59.030 --> 03:15:02.390]  Thank you to everyone who's coming this weekend.
[03:15:02.390 --> 03:15:04.310]  It's going to be incredible.
[03:15:04.310 --> 03:15:06.630]  So very grateful.
[03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.990]  Is there anything-
[03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:11.110]  Please remember last week-
[03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.390]  Go ahead.
[03:15:12.390 --> 03:15:13.350]  Sorry, Brian.
[03:15:13.350 --> 03:15:13.590]  Yeah.
[03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:16.790]  Please remember last week we had a fundraiser for Heather.
[03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:23.750]  So if you said that you're going to buy seeds, then please buy them by tomorrow.
[03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:26.630]  My wife and I have got everything organized.
[03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:29.430]  I'm picking up seeds from people on Friday.
[03:15:29.430 --> 03:15:32.150]  So everything's where it needs to be.
[03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:37.990]  It's just days behind schedule because the community hasn't all come through.
[03:15:37.990 --> 03:15:40.310]  So just asking politely.
[03:15:40.310 --> 03:15:42.870]  I know that sometimes it's like, oh man, I forgot or whatever.
[03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:46.870]  But please remember that all of the money is going to Heather.
[03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:50.230]  So when you pledged, you know, even your 50 bucks or whatever,
[03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:52.950]  all that money needs to go because it adds up.
[03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:56.630]  So yeah, just please remember to get at me.
[03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:59.030]  I got a bunch of emails and stuff I know I need to go through.
[03:15:59.030 --> 03:16:02.070]  So if you have reached out to me, I still got to go through that stuff.
[03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:05.350]  And I have the whole weekend to really get this out.
[03:16:05.350 --> 03:16:07.190]  So that's why I'm asking.
[03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:09.990]  I don't really have time to track everybody down.
[03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:11.590]  So please just reach out to me.
[03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:13.750]  I promise I'll get back to you by the end of this weekend.
[03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.790]  Fantastic.
[03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:18.790]  That was a fantastic event.
[03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:21.670]  And there's a lot of people that really help Heather.
[03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:23.430]  And we appreciate that.
[03:16:23.430 --> 03:16:28.550]  So I think with that, I'm going to say don't forget Joda or Hoda Herbs tonight.
[03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:31.110]  And guys, blessings to you all.
[03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:32.070]  We love you all.
[03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:37.190]  Keep the faith and keep talking and become the voices.
[03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:42.230]  And if you like the interview with Alexa or Chandler today,
[03:16:42.230 --> 03:16:43.590]  we've interviewed them before.
[03:16:44.230 --> 03:16:47.750]  So just check that out on a future cannabis project where they're really like,
[03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:49.910]  you know, they're diving deep into what they're doing.
[03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:54.310]  And again, shout out to what you are accomplishing because you're winning awards.
[03:16:54.310 --> 03:16:58.070]  You know, you're putting together, I think, lifelong connections.
[03:16:58.070 --> 03:17:01.510]  And that there's something to that just as being a human being.
[03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:03.270]  Hats off to everybody involved.
[03:17:03.270 --> 03:17:05.190]  Michael, really pleasure to meet you as well, buddy.
[03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:06.790]  Yeah, likewise.
[03:17:06.790 --> 03:17:07.510]  Thank you so much.
[03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:10.950]  All right, everybody be safe.
[03:17:12.070 --> 03:17:15.910]  You going to take us out, Marco, with saying some names, brother?
[03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:16.630]  Peace.
[03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:19.430]  Oh, I saw Silly Lily, as always.
[03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:22.390]  Barack Obama in the house.
[03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:24.070]  What an honor.
[03:17:24.070 --> 03:17:25.590]  Man, we are going global.
[03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:27.030]  Global.
[03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.990]  What up, Barack?
