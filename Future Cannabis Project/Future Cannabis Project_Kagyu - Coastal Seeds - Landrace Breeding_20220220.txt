[00:00.000 --> 00:05.240]  Pull up the chair. So we we are live. Thanks for joining us everyone
[00:05.240 --> 00:11.360]  And we were we were these guys were chatting up long flowering stuff. And so I was like, let's just
[00:12.120 --> 00:17.280]  Flip the switch and go live. So you what were you talking about before the the Mexican?
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.720]  We were just talking about flowering land race type of cultivars
[00:25.720 --> 00:32.280]  That's what we're kind of discussing before we went live here. Yeah, I was mentioning
[00:32.280 --> 00:41.080]  Congolese that I grew years back and it went till February and actually
[00:41.080 --> 00:46.440]  That's when the Emerald Cup was different. I will say and
[00:46.440 --> 00:51.040]  And I came back and I wasn't really sure how long actually before I hadn't
[00:51.040 --> 00:57.040]  Grown it before but it was the leaves were almost black. They were so dark purple and
[00:57.040 --> 01:03.040]  Smelled like grapes. It was really nice. But then when I smoked it, it just really didn't have anything. I was disappointed
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.040]  And I never did get it tested, which I should I would probably had some interesting chirps in there
[01:09.040 --> 01:17.040]  But anyway, and a lot of those old 60s 70s Mexican
[01:17.040 --> 01:25.040]  Land race before they got contaminated got that uplifting high and it just keeps soaring some of it like the
[01:25.040 --> 01:31.040]  Nairita and the Zacatecas and a few others
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.040]  Jackson, welcome
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.720]  Hey guys
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.720]  Hey Jackson
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.720]  So does that does that face look familiar at all?
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.720]  So does that does that face look familiar at all from from an old Emerald Cup?
[01:51.720 --> 01:53.720]  I think so
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.720]  He was like I may know him by face. I don't know. So I was like
[01:59.720 --> 02:07.720]  Not that I know of I'm not sure man. I I know I was I was in at the
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.720]  Coastal booth when BAM and and
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.720]  Graham Mr. Bob. Yeah Graham were there and
[02:17.720 --> 02:21.720]  Yeah, I think I met you real quick. I think maybe 2000
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.720]  2015 or yeah
[02:25.720 --> 02:34.720]  Yeah, I kind of remember your face. It was kind of crazy there. That was the first time I really did that and it was pretty crazy busy and
[02:34.720 --> 02:39.720]  Everybody wanted to talk and I was trying to you know, not really rush him
[02:39.720 --> 02:45.720]  But, you know, I can see some people are getting impatient you just have to put up with it that's all
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.720]  Yeah, it gets crazy
[02:49.720 --> 02:57.720]  Nothing like Bodie's booth that one year Jesus, you know, couldn't believe he says I'll never do it again
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.720]  Yeah
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.060]  I went and bought some t-shirts from him that day and
[03:06.060 --> 03:14.970]  Yeah, I waited to get I just went and jumped in line and it was he was he was busy yeah very busy
[03:14.970 --> 03:23.970]  So I thought it'd be cool. I mean, obviously I think it'd be awesome to kind of tease out your journey and your story, but then
[03:23.970 --> 03:30.970]  I think these two can drill you with some very specific questions. But do you want to kind of
[03:30.970 --> 03:34.970]  I think first kind of where the name come from
[03:34.970 --> 03:42.970]  To Buddhist lineage God you the oral transmission Buddhist Buddhism and
[03:42.970 --> 03:46.970]  Got the name from that
[03:46.970 --> 03:53.970]  Yeah, so that's came up with that popped into my head so
[03:53.970 --> 03:57.970]  And you
[03:57.970 --> 04:02.970]  You start have you been in
[04:02.970 --> 04:07.970]  Kind of the same area like because you started growing in the in the late 60s, right?
[04:07.970 --> 04:13.970]  Yeah up in Bonnie Doon actually and is that kind of where you've been ever since?
[04:13.970 --> 04:17.970]  No, I was only up there for four or five years and then
[04:17.970 --> 04:24.970]  I'm in Santa Cruz now. I've lived here for 30 30 almost 35 years
[04:24.970 --> 04:29.970]  Yeah, there's a lot of sadness in Santa Cruz
[04:29.970 --> 04:34.970]  Oh gee people from Santa Cruz are not very happy with how things played out. But
[04:34.970 --> 04:37.970]  Yeah, go ahead
[04:37.970 --> 04:43.970]  Now what do you want to just make a quick comment on kind of how you've seen things played in Santa Cruz specifically
[04:43.970 --> 04:45.970]  The
[04:45.970 --> 04:51.970]  Powers that be squeezed out a lot of the young even, you know, new
[04:51.970 --> 04:56.970]  New breeders old breeders small boutique farmers flowers
[04:56.970 --> 04:58.970]  Farmers and
[04:58.970 --> 05:03.970]  You know, you got to have acreage and all this money for your licensing and
[05:03.970 --> 05:11.970]  We tried to do it but it's just too much money. Just it's just basically the people that have the big deep pockets
[05:11.970 --> 05:13.970]  They can always squeeze their way in
[05:13.970 --> 05:20.970]  I'm disgusted with the way that all I won't get into it too much further, but it's just it ruined everything as far as I'm concerned
[05:20.970 --> 05:25.970]  I still like my my I'm still working and I like my work but
[05:25.970 --> 05:31.970]  There's so many people I've been hearing people up north or quitting because they can't survive
[05:31.970 --> 05:35.970]  Prices have gone down and they're leaving the
[05:35.970 --> 05:40.880]  Leaving their gardens
[05:40.880 --> 05:46.880]  Yeah, no, it's and I feel like kind of one of my focuses is to try to
[05:46.880 --> 05:56.880]  As much as I can kind of get the message to the regulators that it's not sensible in any way right now and kind of sensible regulations would
[05:56.880 --> 06:04.880]  Like I just see California. I mean I think of specifically like glasshouse farms in Santa Barbara, which is like trying to have
[06:04.880 --> 06:07.880]  You know like millions of
[06:07.880 --> 06:15.880]  Square feet under cultivation and I'm like, it's like that's the death of all the small farmers that I care about
[06:15.880 --> 06:24.880]  Like every million square feet glasshouse ads. It's like another 20 small farmers who who are, you know, going to go out of business
[06:24.880 --> 06:29.880]  Yeah, it's really a shame. Actually, there's a lot of talent that they
[06:29.880 --> 06:39.880]  They just don't have the means to, you know, get their licenses and purchase the land that you need. And I think mostly Santa Cruz
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.880]  Per se they
[06:41.880 --> 06:49.880]  They preferred everybody going to Watsonville and Salinas and Hollister. I think I don't know. I mean, there was a big stink about all the money they took for people that
[06:49.880 --> 06:54.880]  Put in money for licensing and I don't think they ever got it back
[06:54.880 --> 06:58.880]  I'm not sure on that. I might be wrong but
[06:58.880 --> 07:02.880]  Yeah, I don't think any local government ever has given back
[07:02.880 --> 07:10.880]  Licensing fees when they're like actually we don't want to let people grow but we're going to give all your money back. So
[07:10.880 --> 07:20.880]  But on a more fun note back when things were enjoyable, you want to talk about kind of the late 60s and kind of
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.880]  Where you were in life and kind of
[07:23.880 --> 07:27.880]  Well, I got out of the Navy in
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.880]  67 and then
[07:31.880 --> 07:38.880]  Smoked my first joint at Columbian. I didn't smoke in there because I was I had a top secret clearance. I couldn't
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.880]  Even though I wanted to there was
[07:42.880 --> 07:45.880]  I really didn't trust anybody on something like that
[07:45.880 --> 07:51.880]  To rat you out. If you got ratted out you'd be in jail right away. So anyway, I waited
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.880]  And
[07:53.880 --> 07:55.880]  Buddy of mine
[07:55.880 --> 08:00.880]  Picked me up and we were on our way to go to this bar in town and he said hey you want to smoke a joint I said yeah
[08:00.880 --> 08:03.880]  And he had some Columbian red actually
[08:03.880 --> 08:07.880]  Man, stuff was great
[08:07.880 --> 08:13.880]  That was the first time I smoked and then a few years later I moved up to
[08:13.880 --> 08:17.880]  Funny doing a little cabin up there by myself
[08:17.880 --> 08:19.880]  And
[08:19.880 --> 08:21.880]  I was growing
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.880]  A bunch of different stuff. I found some seeds and some
[08:25.880 --> 08:27.880]  Lizard tongue hash
[08:27.880 --> 08:29.880]  Brotherhood hash
[08:29.880 --> 08:31.880]  And
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.880]  I grew some of that and I had some Mexican land race
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.880]  And that
[08:36.880 --> 08:43.880]  Hash plant was so strong make you throw up man. I couldn't even smoke it. It was
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.880]  It was devastating
[08:46.880 --> 08:54.880]  But, uh, you know, I mean, I don't know if you can find seeds in there anymore. But anyway, that's
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.880]  So I was just, you know using all the old
[08:59.880 --> 09:03.880]  Amendments that I don't use anymore. But I mean, it's just
[09:03.880 --> 09:11.880]  It was nice up there by myself and I was just learning there was only a couple people I really talked to about it
[09:11.880 --> 09:13.880]  One guy
[09:13.880 --> 09:20.880]  Robert Leach. I don't know if you guys ever heard of him or not. He was growing the haze for years. He was plugged in with those guys
[09:20.880 --> 09:21.880]  And
[09:21.880 --> 09:23.880]  I met him and
[09:23.880 --> 09:27.880]  We smoked some haze and then he smoked some of that
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.880]  Afghani and
[09:29.880 --> 09:34.880]  Yeah, he's I said it's a little strong. He's oh, you know, I smoke the haze man. I can
[09:34.880 --> 09:41.880]  I smoked some good weed. I said, well, I'm just trying to tell you it's a little strong and he got to hacking away and got a red face
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.880]  Almost passed out. I had a couple friends pass out on that. I don't know what that was, but
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.880]  I wish I would have been able to be
[09:50.880 --> 09:53.880]  Forward-thinking and saving some of that
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.880]  But
[09:55.880 --> 09:57.880]  I didn't
[09:57.880 --> 10:02.880]  I didn't really I wasn't really into keeping seeds in those days. I threw them out
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.880]  Kind of stupid when I look back on it, but
[10:06.880 --> 10:10.150]  Anyway
[10:10.150 --> 10:11.150]  And
[10:11.150 --> 10:13.150]  Let's see
[10:13.150 --> 10:16.150]  Then I moved away for a while
[10:16.150 --> 10:17.150]  And
[10:17.150 --> 10:19.150]  Move back
[10:19.150 --> 10:21.150]  In
[10:21.150 --> 10:22.150]  Actually
[10:22.150 --> 10:24.150]  80
[10:24.150 --> 10:28.150]  89 I moved back to Santa Cruz. I was working at
[10:28.150 --> 10:30.150]  On a research
[10:30.150 --> 10:33.150]  Farm in Woodland
[10:33.150 --> 10:35.150]  And
[10:35.150 --> 10:37.150]  Started growing a little bit here and then
[10:37.150 --> 10:41.150]  Started breeding, but I didn't really start breeding seriously
[10:41.150 --> 10:43.150]  For about I didn't
[10:43.150 --> 10:47.150]  Only been breeding seriously for probably 15 years
[10:47.150 --> 10:51.490]  I just peddling around with it earlier
[10:51.490 --> 10:53.490]  And
[10:53.490 --> 10:56.490]  You want me to continue on you guys want to talk about anything or
[10:56.490 --> 10:58.490]  Any questions?
[10:58.490 --> 11:03.490]  I think we're liking it. What you can you just touch on the fact that you were working with other plants, right?
[11:03.490 --> 11:09.490]  So you have experience breeding other plants as well. Yeah, I was working with
[11:09.490 --> 11:12.490]  An alfalfa seed
[11:12.490 --> 11:14.490]  Research project in Woodland
[11:14.490 --> 11:17.490]  And we were
[11:17.490 --> 11:20.490]  Doing large populations of
[11:20.490 --> 11:22.490]  Alfalfa seed
[11:22.490 --> 11:26.490]  And we do replications of like four
[11:26.490 --> 11:30.490]  They called them nursery plots and they could be anywhere from
[11:32.490 --> 11:33.490]  I don't know
[11:33.490 --> 11:36.490]  Three to 500 foot four rows
[11:36.490 --> 11:40.490]  And you plant your alfalfa seeds
[11:40.490 --> 11:44.490]  And then flood that and let it the water sit in there for
[11:44.490 --> 11:45.490]  Weeks
[11:45.490 --> 11:51.490]  Until you, you know, until you came up with a few that would survive and then I take them in the greenhouse and
[11:51.490 --> 11:55.490]  Hand pollinate them. I don't know if you guys have ever
[11:55.490 --> 11:58.490]  Seen the flowers on alfalfa. They're real small
[11:58.490 --> 12:01.490]  And I had this little
[12:01.490 --> 12:06.490]  It's a little toothpick with a little teeny circle of sandpaper
[12:06.490 --> 12:10.490]  And you'd stick it in the flower and it had tripped the stamen
[12:10.490 --> 12:16.490]  And then you would pass it on to the next flower and that would trip and you just pollinate the whole plant that way
[12:16.490 --> 12:18.490]  They were in one gallons
[12:18.490 --> 12:21.490]  And that's how you pollinated it
[12:21.490 --> 12:26.490]  And not in the wild but when we did it commercially out in the field after we found them
[12:26.490 --> 12:31.490]  We used a leaf cutter bee and they would pollinate every single flower
[12:31.490 --> 12:33.490]  They were better than honeybees
[12:33.490 --> 12:36.490]  But
[12:36.490 --> 12:43.490]  Yes, well anyway, so we'd you get a few and then you keep pollinating them and taking them back out and then pretty soon you have a
[12:43.490 --> 12:45.490]  Pretty much of a whole
[12:45.490 --> 12:47.490]  Nursery that survived
[12:47.490 --> 12:53.490]  And then we'd go out another year and then we move it out into
[12:53.490 --> 12:56.490]  Five acres on the property there in Woodland
[12:56.490 --> 13:03.490]  And then after a year or two it did well we'd go and do a hundred acres somewhere in Woodland or
[13:03.490 --> 13:07.490]  Somewhere else. I also work with some hard wheat
[13:07.490 --> 13:11.490]  Red wheat, Triticale
[13:11.490 --> 13:16.490]  And some different things. It was with a different different boss then
[13:16.490 --> 13:21.490]  Bob Matchett, he's retired now. He's real famous
[13:21.490 --> 13:25.490]  Wheat, barley breeder
[13:25.490 --> 13:28.490]  And then I came back here and
[13:28.490 --> 13:33.490]  Got together with my wife. We got married and then I started doing my work here
[13:33.490 --> 13:35.490]  And
[13:35.490 --> 13:39.490]  One buddy of mine, Classic Seeds, he's passed away now
[13:39.490 --> 13:41.490]  He and Bodie
[13:41.490 --> 13:43.490]  Had talked me into
[13:43.490 --> 13:45.490]  Starting to
[13:45.490 --> 13:49.490]  You know, put my work out there
[13:49.490 --> 13:54.490]  And I was, wasn't really doing that and that's, those are the two that really got me
[13:54.490 --> 13:58.490]  Started putting my work out there a little bit
[13:58.490 --> 14:02.490]  And yeah, here it is
[14:02.490 --> 14:06.490]  Still, still working with my old
[14:06.490 --> 14:12.490]  Some of my old lines and the stuff from the 60s and 70s. I just really like that
[14:12.490 --> 14:14.490]  That stuff
[14:14.490 --> 14:17.490]  This last year I
[14:17.490 --> 14:22.490]  I acquired some old Thai stick seeds that have been refreshed from 72
[14:22.490 --> 14:25.490]  And I grew those
[14:25.490 --> 14:28.490]  I found a big huge male
[14:28.490 --> 14:32.490]  Just quickly, these were the Burmese ones, right?
[14:32.490 --> 14:33.490]  No
[14:33.490 --> 14:36.490]  Not the Burmese, okay, because you have the Thai
[14:36.490 --> 14:37.490]  Go ahead
[14:37.490 --> 14:41.490]  Yeah, I worked with Burmese also the year before, actually
[14:41.490 --> 14:43.490]  Five or six years
[14:43.490 --> 14:46.490]  And I crossed the Burmese with Colombian
[14:46.490 --> 14:49.490]  And that was a real nice, nice cross
[14:49.490 --> 14:51.490]  Burmese
[14:53.490 --> 14:55.490]  Has a great
[14:55.490 --> 14:58.490]  Profile of different terpenes, it's real
[14:58.490 --> 15:03.490]  It can be a little leafy sometimes, but as far as a breeding tool, passing that on to
[15:03.490 --> 15:06.490]  Whatever you're using, it really worked out well
[15:06.490 --> 15:10.490]  But back to my last year's breeding, I crossed that
[15:11.490 --> 15:15.490]  Thai stick male to a bunch of Hawaiians
[15:16.490 --> 15:20.490]  A couple different Oaxacans
[15:20.490 --> 15:22.490]  And
[15:22.490 --> 15:27.490]  This really old heirloom from Molokai from a
[15:27.490 --> 15:30.490]  Old man by the name of Nuk Nuk
[15:30.490 --> 15:33.490]  I got it from a friend that's over there
[15:33.490 --> 15:36.490]  And it's a precursor to the
[15:36.490 --> 15:41.490]  Molokai frost, I don't know if they made it from that or not, but
[15:41.490 --> 15:45.490]  That's kind of, I never could get the real story over there, and I can't
[15:45.490 --> 15:50.490]  Can't find that guy to talk to him, he doesn't want to talk to anybody, he's real reclusive
[15:50.490 --> 15:53.490]  But anyway, so I did a bunch of pollinations of those, and then
[15:53.490 --> 15:55.490]  I'm going to be growing them out this year
[15:55.490 --> 15:58.490]  To see how they do, because I'm
[15:58.490 --> 16:00.490]  I don't have
[16:00.490 --> 16:03.490]  I don't have the area to grow out
[16:03.490 --> 16:06.490]  Hundreds of plants of each strain
[16:07.490 --> 16:10.490]  So I just do, the most I can do is
[16:10.490 --> 16:14.490]  Probably a hundred plants, and that's pushing it for where I live
[16:14.490 --> 16:16.490]  So
[16:16.490 --> 16:18.490]  Anyway, let's
[16:18.490 --> 16:21.490]  We'll see how things go when I grow them out
[16:21.490 --> 16:24.490]  I did a couple of
[16:24.490 --> 16:28.490]  Collaborations with, one with Bodhi and one with Snowhai
[16:28.490 --> 16:32.490]  Bodhi, I worked with him, he had a
[16:32.490 --> 16:36.490]  A line called American Skunk Selection
[16:36.490 --> 16:40.490]  And I'd have to go back on my notes on that, I don't remember what
[16:40.490 --> 16:42.490]  That is, it's not the old
[16:42.490 --> 16:46.490]  Roadkill skunk, I'm not sure exactly what it was, but
[16:46.490 --> 16:49.490]  Boy, it had the funkiest smell, I mean it was a beautiful plant
[16:49.490 --> 16:51.490]  And
[16:51.490 --> 16:54.490]  Turned out really nice
[16:54.490 --> 16:57.490]  Let me look here on my notes here, I think one, he kept a couple
[16:57.490 --> 17:00.490]  Bodhi kept a couple
[17:00.490 --> 17:03.490]  That he liked, that
[17:03.490 --> 17:06.490]  Had high CBD
[17:06.490 --> 17:09.490]  And then one of them had
[17:09.490 --> 17:12.490]  17% THC and 8.5 CBD
[17:12.490 --> 17:16.490]  And then there were some that hardly had any THC at all
[17:16.490 --> 17:19.490]  And he liked those a little better
[17:19.490 --> 17:22.490]  But, and then
[17:22.490 --> 17:25.490]  Snowhai, our collaboration
[17:25.490 --> 17:27.490]  He
[17:27.490 --> 17:30.490]  Grew a bunch of the different OG's
[17:30.490 --> 17:33.490]  Hells Angel OG, Skywalker
[17:33.490 --> 17:36.490]  Fire OG, a bunch of different ones and picked out
[17:36.490 --> 17:39.490]  The ones he liked and then did a
[17:39.490 --> 17:42.490]  Purple Fire Thai
[17:42.490 --> 17:45.490]  Hells Angel OG
[17:45.490 --> 17:48.490]  And then I crossed
[17:48.490 --> 17:51.490]  That with the
[17:51.490 --> 17:54.490]  With the Columbian
[17:54.490 --> 17:57.490]  That thing was a huge plant
[17:57.490 --> 18:00.490]  That would be, I never got it tested but it was
[18:00.490 --> 18:03.490]  Real strong though
[18:03.490 --> 18:06.490]  It had a slight OG taste but more of an earthy
[18:06.490 --> 18:09.490]  Jungle, but with that
[18:09.490 --> 18:12.490]  Lingering little bit of
[18:12.490 --> 18:15.490]  Fuel-y taste in the background, not like a heavy fuel
[18:15.490 --> 18:18.490]  To begin with
[18:18.490 --> 18:21.490]  But that would be a production plant for somebody that wanted to grow volume
[18:21.490 --> 18:24.490]  And a decent bag of P.L.
[18:24.490 --> 18:27.490]  Anyway, so
[18:27.490 --> 18:30.490]  That's basically what I've been doing lately
[18:30.490 --> 18:35.910]  Jackson or Tony
[18:35.910 --> 18:38.910]  Do you guys have any questions?
[18:38.910 --> 18:41.910]  I was curious
[18:41.910 --> 18:44.910]  About the
[18:44.910 --> 18:47.910]  Burmese stuff that you have
[18:47.910 --> 18:50.910]  Just because I have something that for years
[18:50.910 --> 18:53.910]  I didn't know had Burmese in it
[18:53.910 --> 18:56.910]  And up here people always talked about
[18:56.910 --> 18:59.910]  Like the most legendary early 80s thing
[18:59.910 --> 19:02.910]  That people had out in this area
[19:02.910 --> 19:05.910]  Out the road from me where I grew up
[19:05.910 --> 19:08.910]  And everybody always talked about Burmese Indica
[19:08.910 --> 19:11.910]  When I started learning a little bit more
[19:11.910 --> 19:14.910]  I was like, there's no
[19:14.910 --> 19:17.910]  Not what they would have called in the 80s an Indica
[19:17.910 --> 19:20.910]  And then I was talking to my buddy who was one of the people
[19:20.910 --> 19:23.910]  Who had it early out and how it kind of wound up with me
[19:23.910 --> 19:26.910]  In stuff that I had
[19:26.910 --> 19:29.910]  And he was like, no, it's not Burmese
[19:29.910 --> 19:32.910]  It's like saying Thai-Afghani
[19:32.910 --> 19:35.910]  It's Burmese Indica
[19:35.910 --> 19:38.910]  Because here in the early 80s if it was fat leaf weed
[19:38.910 --> 19:41.910]  They called it Indica, whether it was Afghani or Pakistani
[19:41.910 --> 19:44.910]  Or whatever, and so there was this cross
[19:44.910 --> 19:47.910]  That was in it, I just could never really make sense of
[19:47.910 --> 19:50.910]  I was always like, what is a Burmese Indica
[19:50.910 --> 19:53.910]  Once I started really thinking about it
[19:53.910 --> 19:56.910]  And now after all these years I kind of know what it is
[19:56.910 --> 19:59.910]  It has small leaves
[19:59.910 --> 20:02.910]  It likes to get narrow little buds
[20:02.910 --> 20:05.910]  It's a pain in the ass to trim, but it has tons of resin
[20:05.910 --> 20:08.910]  And I was just curious about on yours, do you get
[20:08.910 --> 20:11.910]  Trippy citrus smells from it?
[20:11.910 --> 20:14.910]  Yeah, you do, but they're wider leaf
[20:14.910 --> 20:17.910]  The one I have
[20:17.910 --> 20:20.910]  I got it originally from Bodie
[20:20.910 --> 20:23.910]  And it came from Canada
[20:23.910 --> 20:26.910]  It might have been from, what's that guy
[20:26.910 --> 20:29.910]  I don't know if he's still in the business, I can't remember his name
[20:29.910 --> 20:32.910]  He had some really good land-raised strains years ago
[20:32.910 --> 20:35.910]  God, I can't remember that guy's name
[20:35.910 --> 20:38.910]  Some biker guy up there
[20:38.910 --> 20:41.910]  Anyway, I can't remember his name
[20:41.910 --> 20:44.910]  But anyway, no, this has big buds
[20:44.910 --> 20:47.910]  And once in a while you'll get one that's real leafy
[20:47.910 --> 20:50.910]  It still can be used for extraction and stuff
[20:50.910 --> 20:53.910]  But it's
[20:53.910 --> 20:56.910]  It's a really great breeding tool
[20:56.910 --> 20:59.910]  It sounds like we have a couple different ones there
[20:59.910 --> 21:02.910]  Because mine are not narrow leafed
[21:02.910 --> 21:05.910]  But it's a good one
[21:05.910 --> 21:08.910]  Yeah, this plant
[21:08.910 --> 21:11.910]  I didn't ever get to see it by itself
[21:11.910 --> 21:14.910]  So I was never really sure exactly what it looked like
[21:14.910 --> 21:17.910]  It's just I kind of know now what the other thing was in the mix
[21:17.910 --> 21:20.910]  And that's more of the big crazy broad leaf stuff
[21:20.910 --> 21:23.910]  And then I wonder too
[21:23.910 --> 21:26.910]  If what they had
[21:26.910 --> 21:29.910]  Because if I would have got it a long time ago
[21:29.910 --> 21:32.910]  And not been able to make sense of it
[21:33.910 --> 21:36.910]  If somebody would have given me Burmese Indica
[21:36.910 --> 21:39.910]  It would have been real easy to drop the Indica off of it
[21:39.910 --> 21:42.910]  And just go, yeah, this is Burmese
[21:42.910 --> 21:45.910]  And then it makes me wonder too
[21:45.910 --> 21:48.910]  Because here it was one of those really
[21:48.910 --> 21:51.910]  In the days when there wasn't a lot of different things
[21:51.910 --> 21:54.910]  People had up here a couple Mexicans
[21:54.910 --> 21:57.910]  And a couple different Pakistanis and Afghanis
[21:57.910 --> 22:00.910]  And then people would always tell me
[22:01.910 --> 22:04.910]  Oh, but you should have had the Burmese
[22:04.910 --> 22:07.910]  And then talking to a buddy of mine
[22:07.910 --> 22:10.910]  He was like, oh yeah, that's what the stuff was from those guys
[22:10.910 --> 22:13.910]  And then it turned out
[22:13.910 --> 22:16.910]  His partner was the brother of his old girlfriend
[22:16.910 --> 22:19.910]  And their dad was the one who it came
[22:19.910 --> 22:22.910]  You know how the story is
[22:22.910 --> 22:25.910]  You don't know until you ask
[22:25.910 --> 22:28.910]  And that was a trippy one
[22:29.910 --> 22:32.910]  And then he was like, oh, I've got Burmese stuff too
[22:32.910 --> 22:35.910]  And he popped them and he was like, yeah, they're really citrusy
[22:35.910 --> 22:38.910]  So I was like, oh, maybe the citrusy stuff
[22:38.910 --> 22:41.910]  Was coming from the Burmese side of it
[22:41.910 --> 22:44.910]  So every time someone has something with Burmese
[22:44.910 --> 22:47.910]  I'm always curious if there's like, you know
[22:47.910 --> 22:50.910]  Kind of orangey, lemony, limey stuff
[22:50.910 --> 22:53.910]  It's got that in there
[22:53.910 --> 22:56.910]  And I got this one from Classic Seeds
[22:57.910 --> 23:00.910]  And basically, Brenda has got sticks
[23:00.910 --> 23:03.910]  When they were getting the Thai sticks
[23:03.910 --> 23:06.910]  This was from Burma
[23:06.910 --> 23:09.910]  And they were like Thai sticks
[23:09.910 --> 23:12.910]  And he got some seeds out of it
[23:12.910 --> 23:15.910]  But it wasn't grown in Thailand
[23:15.910 --> 23:18.910]  It was grown in Burma
[23:18.910 --> 23:21.910]  So I crossed those two together
[23:21.910 --> 23:24.910]  And pollinated Smuggler's Choice with the inbred Burmese that I have
[23:25.910 --> 23:28.910]  And then with the combination of the two, once in a while
[23:28.910 --> 23:31.910]  You get like a bubble gum deal there
[23:31.910 --> 23:34.910]  Which is really unusual, kind of nice
[23:34.910 --> 23:37.910]  It's not really rare
[23:37.910 --> 23:40.910]  But if you look for it, you can find it
[23:40.910 --> 23:43.910]  Yeah, so
[23:43.910 --> 23:46.910]  Yeah, I'd never heard of Burmese sticks before
[23:46.910 --> 23:49.910]  But who knows, when we were getting those sticks
[23:49.910 --> 23:52.910]  It could have been Cambodian
[23:53.910 --> 23:56.910]  Yeah, actually I grew some of that
[23:56.910 --> 23:59.910]  Right here in Santa Cruz in 1974
[23:59.910 --> 24:02.910]  And I could never grow it all the way out
[24:02.910 --> 24:05.910]  And mature it now
[24:05.910 --> 24:08.910]  I grew it until February
[24:08.910 --> 24:11.910]  And our weather was completely different in those days
[24:11.910 --> 24:14.910]  They were like 14, 16 footers
[24:14.910 --> 24:17.910]  They didn't even use any fertilizer
[24:17.910 --> 24:20.910]  I grew it on an old dairy farm
[24:21.910 --> 24:24.910]  It was a lot like the sticks I grew, it tasted identical
[24:24.910 --> 24:27.910]  One of my fond memories of growing a long flowering plant
[24:27.910 --> 24:30.910]  To maturity without worrying about the botrytis in those days
[24:30.910 --> 24:33.910]  Tony, you had something you were about
[24:33.910 --> 24:45.740]  I jumped in right at the same time as you
[24:45.740 --> 24:48.740]  We got a little lag
[24:48.740 --> 24:51.740]  Yeah, I was going to ask you
[24:51.740 --> 24:54.740]  If you could maybe dive into some of the information
[24:54.740 --> 24:57.740]  On the Big Sur Holy Weed that you work with
[24:58.740 --> 25:01.740]  We had a few people asking about that in the comments
[25:01.740 --> 25:04.740]  Yeah, I got that from a guy here years ago
[25:06.740 --> 25:09.740]  15, 18 years ago probably
[25:12.740 --> 25:15.740]  He had got it from a close friend
[25:18.740 --> 25:21.740]  To that guy that brought it up there
[25:21.740 --> 25:24.740]  In Big Sur
[25:27.740 --> 25:30.740]  It's a great strain
[25:34.740 --> 25:37.740]  It's got two major expressions
[25:37.740 --> 25:40.740]  One is purple and then there's a green
[25:40.740 --> 25:43.740]  Green flower
[25:43.740 --> 25:46.740]  The purple flower is a little bit stronger
[25:46.740 --> 25:49.740]  And it tastes
[25:49.740 --> 25:52.740]  I'm not really good at this, I always go to Bodie
[25:52.740 --> 25:55.740]  To get him to give me the rundown on different tastes
[25:56.740 --> 25:59.740]  It's not something I'm really good at
[25:59.740 --> 26:02.740]  It's real stony
[26:02.740 --> 26:05.740]  Bam always liked the green stem better than the purple one
[26:05.740 --> 26:08.740]  I like them both
[26:08.740 --> 26:11.740]  I don't really see any disadvantage in either one of them
[26:11.740 --> 26:14.740]  I know some people bred those
[26:14.740 --> 26:17.740]  And bred out the purple
[26:17.740 --> 26:20.740]  And vice versa
[26:20.740 --> 26:23.740]  These haven't been bred out
[26:24.740 --> 26:27.740]  They've been inbred
[26:27.740 --> 26:30.740]  I kept it that way
[26:30.740 --> 26:33.740]  I crossed that with the Colombian mayo
[26:33.740 --> 26:36.740]  And then I also
[26:36.740 --> 26:39.740]  Crossed the Thai stick with that
[26:39.740 --> 26:42.740]  Which I'll grow this year
[26:42.740 --> 26:49.060]  So see how that does
[26:49.060 --> 26:52.060]  So just quickly, you said you have specific preferences
[26:52.060 --> 26:55.060]  Of what you like to smoke, right?
[26:56.060 --> 26:59.060]  I like more of the divas
[26:59.060 --> 27:03.970]  But I wasn't really big on
[27:03.970 --> 27:06.970]  The chems at all
[27:06.970 --> 27:09.970]  But I was sick quite a few years back
[27:09.970 --> 27:12.970]  And was in a lot of pain
[27:12.970 --> 27:15.970]  And Graham gave me this
[27:15.970 --> 27:18.970]  Chem 91
[27:18.970 --> 27:21.970]  I think what it was
[27:21.970 --> 27:24.970]  And I said, I don't know if I want to smoke that stuff
[27:25.970 --> 27:28.970]  I said, I can't do anything
[27:28.970 --> 27:31.970]  And this and that
[27:31.970 --> 27:34.970]  I smoked it and it cut through the pain
[27:34.970 --> 27:37.970]  And it was like a whole other thing that happened
[27:37.970 --> 27:40.970]  I was shocked
[27:40.970 --> 27:43.970]  Now I don't poo-poo
[27:43.970 --> 27:46.970]  At some of these strains
[27:46.970 --> 27:49.970]  Until I really try them
[27:49.970 --> 27:52.970]  Because I didn't know it had that aspect
[27:52.970 --> 27:55.970]  Maybe they don't know about it
[27:55.970 --> 27:58.970]  I had no idea because I didn't really smoke it
[27:58.970 --> 28:01.970]  But anyway
[28:01.970 --> 28:04.970]  I like
[28:04.970 --> 28:07.970]  Landrace Mexicans
[28:07.970 --> 28:10.970]  Thai like I'm going with now
[28:10.970 --> 28:13.970]  Some Swazi
[28:13.970 --> 28:16.970]  I work with the Swazi
[28:16.970 --> 28:19.970]  From a friend in Europe
[28:19.970 --> 28:22.970]  And it's from
[28:22.970 --> 28:25.970]  A seed company over there
[28:25.970 --> 28:28.970]  Swazi red is what it was
[28:28.970 --> 28:31.970]  And I've grown that for probably
[28:31.970 --> 28:34.970]  Six or seven years
[28:34.970 --> 28:37.970]  Across some different things
[28:37.970 --> 28:40.970]  And it's a really nice plant
[28:40.970 --> 28:43.970]  It's more of a clear
[28:43.970 --> 28:46.970]  I wouldn't say psychedelic
[28:46.970 --> 28:49.970]  You don't get to where if you smoke too much
[28:49.970 --> 28:52.970]  You don't get to where you're getting nervous
[28:52.970 --> 28:55.970]  Like some of them get your heart racing
[28:55.970 --> 28:58.970]  I guess my favorite
[28:58.970 --> 29:01.970]  And I'm waiting to grow it
[29:01.970 --> 29:04.970]  My favorite from all time is Thai
[29:04.970 --> 29:07.970]  And then Nayarit Mexican
[29:07.970 --> 29:10.970]  That's one I remember from the 70s
[29:10.970 --> 29:13.970]  And I have a little bit of that left
[29:13.970 --> 29:21.700]  And then there's both of you guys
[29:21.700 --> 29:24.700]  Tony
[29:24.700 --> 29:27.700]  On the old school style
[29:27.700 --> 29:30.700]  I've worked with Hays
[29:30.700 --> 29:33.700]  Columbians
[29:33.700 --> 29:36.700]  I've worked with some old school Asian lines
[29:36.700 --> 29:39.700]  For me
[29:39.700 --> 29:42.700]  I like both of the sides of stuff
[29:42.700 --> 29:45.700]  From the Afghanis and the Hays
[29:45.700 --> 29:48.700]  I've worked with some old school Afghanis
[29:48.700 --> 29:51.700]  That my mom had acquired
[29:51.700 --> 29:54.700]  So for me
[29:54.700 --> 29:57.700]  I cut my teeth on the old Afghani hash plants
[29:57.700 --> 30:00.700]  The kind you speak of
[30:00.700 --> 30:03.700]  They're way more powerful
[30:03.700 --> 30:06.700]  Than a lot of the stuff we see today
[30:06.700 --> 30:09.700]  I believe because they've been washed out
[30:09.700 --> 30:12.700]  Because of the amount of people buying them
[30:12.700 --> 30:15.700]  They're not the actual powerful traits
[30:15.700 --> 30:18.700]  They used to have more of the narrow leaf Afghanis
[30:18.700 --> 30:21.700]  Years ago
[30:21.700 --> 30:24.700]  Once in a while I run across them
[30:24.700 --> 30:27.700]  But not as much
[30:27.700 --> 30:30.700]  I think that was probably
[30:30.700 --> 30:33.700]  That was when King was in charge
[30:33.700 --> 30:36.700]  And wanted people growing weed
[30:36.700 --> 30:39.700]  I think it changed
[30:39.700 --> 30:42.700]  I don't know if they got moved in
[30:42.700 --> 30:45.700]  Or some different line there
[30:45.700 --> 30:48.700]  But you don't find the narrow leaf Afghanis
[30:48.700 --> 30:51.700]  Much anymore
[30:51.700 --> 30:54.700]  I like an Afghani once in a while
[30:54.700 --> 30:57.700]  It's not that I dislike them
[30:57.700 --> 31:00.700]  I just prefer
[31:00.700 --> 31:03.700]  I get more motivated on the sativa ones
[31:03.700 --> 31:06.700]  The narrow leaf flowers
[31:06.700 --> 31:09.700]  I have one that I bred
[31:09.700 --> 31:12.700]  That's cherry limeade
[31:12.700 --> 31:15.700]  It's really sleepy
[31:15.700 --> 31:18.700]  If you have nerve pain and can't sleep
[31:18.700 --> 31:21.700]  It's great
[31:21.700 --> 31:24.700]  But if you smoke it in the middle of the day
[31:24.700 --> 31:27.700]  When you're trying to do something fun
[31:27.700 --> 31:30.700]  You wind up being like
[31:30.700 --> 31:33.700]  I just took a downer
[31:33.700 --> 31:36.700]  My favorites have a trippy thing
[31:36.700 --> 31:39.700]  If you smoke them in the morning
[31:39.700 --> 31:42.700]  You're energized
[31:42.700 --> 31:45.700]  If you're tired and smoke them
[31:45.700 --> 31:48.700]  It's more relaxing
[31:48.700 --> 31:51.700]  I only have a couple things like that
[31:51.700 --> 31:54.700]  I like the clear
[31:54.700 --> 31:57.700]  My favorite is the ones that make things seem
[31:57.700 --> 32:00.700]  Absurd and silly
[32:00.700 --> 32:03.700]  I like the one with the weed
[32:03.700 --> 32:06.700]  That's my favorite thing about weed
[32:06.700 --> 32:09.700]  You get the giggles
[32:09.700 --> 32:12.700]  You can laugh at anything
[32:12.700 --> 32:15.700]  Dark humor
[32:15.700 --> 32:18.700]  I shouldn't laugh at this
[32:18.700 --> 32:21.700]  But I can't stop it's so funny
[32:21.700 --> 32:24.700]  Those are my favorites
[32:24.700 --> 32:27.700]  I learned over the years
[32:27.700 --> 32:30.700]  If you don't have anything to them
[32:30.700 --> 32:33.700]  They're good for certain things
[32:33.700 --> 32:36.700]  It's not all the time
[32:36.700 --> 32:39.700]  You want everything to be elevated
[32:39.700 --> 32:42.700]  Sometimes people need
[32:42.700 --> 32:45.700]  In certain living situations
[32:45.700 --> 32:48.700]  Or times in their life
[32:48.700 --> 32:51.700]  For pain
[32:51.700 --> 32:54.700]  It's cool to have weed
[32:54.700 --> 32:57.700]  I like opiates
[32:57.700 --> 33:00.700]  It dulls everything
[33:00.700 --> 33:03.700]  You don't want to go through your whole life
[33:03.700 --> 33:06.700]  Sometimes it's nice to have something
[33:06.700 --> 33:09.700]  That shuts everything down
[33:09.700 --> 33:12.700]  I like the ones that are
[33:12.700 --> 33:15.700]  Like a cure all
[33:15.700 --> 33:18.700]  Right now I need to go to sleep
[33:18.700 --> 33:21.700]  And they hit you
[33:21.700 --> 33:24.700]  I like the northern lights haze
[33:24.700 --> 33:27.700]  That we've been playing with
[33:27.700 --> 33:30.700]  If you smoke them when it's late
[33:30.700 --> 33:33.700]  You're like I'm going to be up until 2
[33:33.700 --> 33:36.700]  In the morning now
[33:36.700 --> 33:39.700]  They have that haze side to them
[33:39.700 --> 33:42.700]  Late night it's like
[33:42.700 --> 33:45.700]  Don't do that
[33:45.700 --> 33:50.100]  Not the right thing for the right time
[33:50.100 --> 33:53.100]  I'm trying to
[33:53.100 --> 33:56.100]  Work with things to bring a lot of that back
[33:56.100 --> 33:59.100]  I haven't grown any haze
[33:59.100 --> 34:02.100]  I got some original haze seeds
[34:02.100 --> 34:05.100]  From a friend here in Santa Cruz
[34:05.100 --> 34:08.100]  I probably should sprout here one of these days
[34:08.100 --> 34:11.100]  I just haven't got around to it
[34:11.100 --> 34:14.100]  There were years gone by
[34:14.100 --> 34:17.100]  That year after year I did preservation work
[34:17.100 --> 34:20.100]  I had a lot of haze
[34:20.100 --> 34:23.100]  And they were super long flowering
[34:23.100 --> 34:26.100]  Some more than others
[34:26.100 --> 34:29.100]  I got burned out on it
[34:29.100 --> 34:32.100]  I'm taking a break on doing the preservation stuff
[34:32.100 --> 34:35.100]  I've got so many things preserved
[34:35.100 --> 34:38.100]  I've got seed there that I haven't even grown out
[34:38.100 --> 34:41.100]  That's my drawback
[34:41.100 --> 34:44.100]  On where I am
[34:45.100 --> 34:48.100]  I've been looking at my priorities
[34:48.100 --> 34:51.100]  I've been either wanting to do
[34:51.100 --> 34:54.100]  Or putting it off
[34:54.100 --> 34:57.100]  Or something new I wanted to try
[34:57.100 --> 35:00.100]  Like this last year
[35:00.100 --> 35:03.100]  I acquired those Hawaiians
[35:03.100 --> 35:06.100]  I've been looking for real old tie stick
[35:06.100 --> 35:09.100]  For 25 or 30 years
[35:09.100 --> 35:12.100]  Couldn't find any
[35:13.100 --> 35:16.100]  I got a mail from Top Dog
[35:16.100 --> 35:19.100]  He sent me that
[35:19.100 --> 35:22.100]  It turned out really nice
[35:22.100 --> 35:25.100]  Kind of a lemony
[35:25.100 --> 35:28.100]  I crossed the tie stick seeds with that one
[35:28.100 --> 35:31.100]  It was kind of a nice
[35:31.100 --> 35:34.100]  More of a conical shape
[35:34.100 --> 35:37.100]  Whereas the tie stick ones
[35:37.100 --> 35:40.100]  Is more of a Christmas tree array
[35:41.100 --> 35:44.100]  I got that out of Columbians too
[35:44.100 --> 35:47.100]  Some of the Columbian reds are that way
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.100]  And some are not
[35:50.100 --> 35:53.100]  When I used the Columbian mail
[35:53.100 --> 35:56.100]  I did four mails
[35:56.100 --> 35:59.100]  A couple that had purple stems
[35:59.100 --> 36:02.100]  And petioles
[36:02.100 --> 36:05.100]  And then there were two that didn't
[36:05.100 --> 36:08.100]  I tried to keep the whole genetic
[36:09.100 --> 36:12.100]  Gene pool in there
[36:12.100 --> 36:15.100]  And then after it's said and done
[36:15.100 --> 36:18.100]  You can get in there and start
[36:18.100 --> 36:21.100]  Looking for different expressions
[36:21.100 --> 36:28.700]  So we have a ton of
[36:28.700 --> 36:31.700]  Chat questions
[36:31.700 --> 36:34.700]  So I reached out to Bam
[36:34.700 --> 36:37.700]  To see if he wants to jump on and say hi
[36:37.700 --> 36:40.700]  He has a family event going on
[36:40.700 --> 36:43.700]  And he said
[36:43.700 --> 36:46.700]  I think people should know that
[36:46.700 --> 36:49.700]  Broadleaf or narrowleaf
[36:49.700 --> 36:52.700]  Can have the up highs or the narcotic stone
[36:52.700 --> 36:55.700]  And then he said
[36:55.700 --> 36:58.700]  The Burmese aren't indica
[36:58.700 --> 37:01.700]  But lowland sativa is grown in microclimates
[37:01.700 --> 37:04.700]  That need different light
[37:04.700 --> 37:07.700]  So they have the up highs
[37:07.700 --> 37:10.700]  That's all while he's cooking
[37:10.700 --> 37:13.700]  Cooking and texting
[37:13.700 --> 37:16.700]  Yeah
[37:16.700 --> 37:19.700]  He's a very good friend
[37:19.700 --> 37:22.700]  We still have these ongoing projects
[37:22.700 --> 37:25.700]  We're in the works
[37:25.700 --> 37:28.700]  He and Bodhi and I
[37:28.700 --> 37:31.700]  Have been working on creating another haze
[37:31.700 --> 37:34.700]  Not exactly the same
[37:34.700 --> 37:37.700]  I started with
[37:37.700 --> 37:40.700]  Two different ones
[37:40.700 --> 37:43.700]  The Thai
[37:43.700 --> 37:46.700]  Colombian
[37:46.700 --> 37:49.700]  And the Colombian Mexican
[37:49.700 --> 37:52.700]  That I bred
[37:52.700 --> 37:55.700]  And then either one of them can add something to it
[37:55.700 --> 37:58.700]  Or whatever
[37:58.700 --> 38:01.700]  And we may put something else in there
[38:01.700 --> 38:04.700]  We're still working on it
[38:04.700 --> 38:07.700]  And we'll see
[38:07.700 --> 38:10.700]  Whether there's something I want to keep
[38:10.700 --> 38:13.700]  We haven't done that yet
[38:13.700 --> 38:16.700]  John has to contend with all this wind
[38:16.700 --> 38:19.700]  Down there
[38:19.700 --> 38:22.700]  You get the
[38:22.700 --> 38:25.700]  What is that coming through the
[38:25.700 --> 38:28.700]  The sand
[38:28.700 --> 38:31.700]  And the sand
[38:31.700 --> 38:34.700]  I have to contend with fog
[38:34.700 --> 38:37.700]  And moisture here on the coast
[38:37.700 --> 38:40.700]  And he's got wind there
[38:40.700 --> 38:43.700]  It's only one drawback here
[38:43.700 --> 38:46.700]  I can't really grow
[38:46.700 --> 38:49.700]  Pure Afghanis
[38:49.700 --> 38:52.700]  I only grew one one year
[38:52.700 --> 38:55.700]  And it just happened to be one year
[38:55.700 --> 38:58.700]  And it was just great
[38:58.700 --> 39:01.700]  No mold or PM or anything
[39:01.700 --> 39:04.700]  I'm going to be using
[39:04.700 --> 39:07.700]  A friend of mine
[39:07.700 --> 39:10.700]  Has been studying that for seven years
[39:10.700 --> 39:13.700]  And I'm going to be using some of his formula
[39:13.700 --> 39:16.700]  For spraying the foliar spray on the plants
[39:16.700 --> 39:19.700]  To eliminate that
[39:19.700 --> 39:22.700]  He had real good luck up north
[39:22.700 --> 39:25.700]  With all of his problems
[39:25.700 --> 39:28.700]  So I'm going to give it a shot
[39:28.700 --> 39:31.700]  This year he's going to make me up a brew
[39:31.700 --> 39:34.700]  Kind of excited to try it actually
[39:34.700 --> 39:37.700]  All the kids are doing the KNF these days
[39:37.700 --> 39:40.700]  A lot of good benefits
[39:40.700 --> 39:43.700]  So
[39:43.700 --> 39:46.700]  In the chat
[39:46.700 --> 39:49.700]  Cascadian Grown Ass something
[39:49.700 --> 39:52.700]  So
[39:52.700 --> 39:55.700]  How do you select your male plants
[39:55.700 --> 39:58.700]  And then someone else
[39:58.700 --> 40:01.700]  Related to that
[40:01.700 --> 40:04.700]  Asked about the Columbian
[40:04.700 --> 40:07.700]  They asked
[40:07.700 --> 40:10.700]  What did the Columbian male use
[40:10.700 --> 40:13.700]  What particular traits do you feel
[40:13.700 --> 40:16.700]  It brought to the population of the project
[40:16.700 --> 40:19.700]  And then there was
[40:19.700 --> 40:22.700]  Anthra who said
[40:22.700 --> 40:25.700]  Ask him what his Columbian male
[40:25.700 --> 40:28.700]  Brings to the table
[40:28.700 --> 40:31.700]  How do you select your males
[40:31.700 --> 40:34.700]  And I noticed the Columbian male
[40:34.700 --> 40:37.700]  You use it a lot
[40:37.700 --> 40:40.700]  What do you like about that male
[40:40.700 --> 40:43.700]  I have two males
[40:43.700 --> 40:46.700]  I have a male
[40:46.700 --> 40:49.700]  That's a 70s Columbian
[40:49.700 --> 40:52.700]  Real earthy
[40:52.700 --> 40:55.700]  Stony
[40:55.700 --> 40:58.700]  And the way I select
[40:58.700 --> 41:01.700]  The males
[41:01.700 --> 41:04.700]  Is structure
[41:04.700 --> 41:07.700]  I don't really
[41:07.700 --> 41:10.700]  I'm not really concerned a lot about
[41:10.700 --> 41:13.700]  The structure
[41:13.700 --> 41:16.700]  You know
[41:16.700 --> 41:19.700]  You like to have a little
[41:19.700 --> 41:22.700]  Closer
[41:22.700 --> 41:25.700]  Mainly structure
[41:25.700 --> 41:28.700]  And I know the line
[41:28.700 --> 41:31.700]  I can kind of
[41:31.700 --> 41:34.700]  Sort of tell how it's going to be
[41:34.700 --> 41:37.700]  You can't be 100%
[41:37.700 --> 41:40.700]  I'm not going to be
[41:40.700 --> 41:43.700]  I'm not going to be
[41:43.700 --> 41:46.700]  I'm not going to be
[41:46.700 --> 41:49.700]  I'm not going to be
[41:49.700 --> 41:52.700]  What I'm really looking for
[41:52.700 --> 41:55.700]  But once in a while
[41:55.700 --> 41:58.700]  I'll keep them just in case
[41:58.700 --> 42:01.700]  And a lot of times I'll end up calling them
[42:01.700 --> 42:04.700]  But sometimes I don't
[42:04.700 --> 42:07.700]  That answer the question
[42:07.700 --> 42:10.700]  It's not that
[42:10.700 --> 42:13.700]  After a while you get to know
[42:13.700 --> 42:16.700]  If you don't know the plants
[42:16.700 --> 42:19.700]  I've had some where I had to grow a bunch
[42:19.700 --> 42:22.700]  In one gallon and then just wait
[42:22.700 --> 42:25.700]  And see what they do
[42:25.700 --> 42:28.700]  Because I wasn't familiar with the growth habit
[42:28.700 --> 42:31.700]  Or anything like that
[42:31.700 --> 42:34.700]  And then I started to grow
[42:34.700 --> 42:37.700]  The purple Congolese
[42:37.700 --> 42:40.700]  It was a very strange plant
[42:40.700 --> 42:43.700]  Started maturing
[42:43.700 --> 42:46.700]  Sometimes inside out
[42:46.700 --> 42:49.700]  Lower branches and then the top would be delayed
[42:49.700 --> 42:52.700]  It's a real weird plant
[42:52.700 --> 42:55.700]  Like I said
[42:55.700 --> 42:58.700]  I was a little disappointed in it
[42:58.700 --> 43:01.700]  I had a couple of terpenes in there
[43:01.700 --> 43:04.700]  And there was probably something special that I missed
[43:04.700 --> 43:07.700]  But I didn't test it for one reason or another
[43:07.700 --> 43:10.700]  You made a good point
[43:10.700 --> 43:13.700]  Sorry, Peter
[43:13.700 --> 43:16.700]  You made a good point about males
[43:16.700 --> 43:19.700]  Because people always want to know
[43:19.700 --> 43:22.700]  What's the checklist
[43:22.700 --> 43:25.700]  Is it big stems
[43:25.700 --> 43:28.700]  You said you have to grow the plants
[43:28.700 --> 43:31.700]  Enough
[43:31.700 --> 43:34.700]  That's why it's good to do an open pollination
[43:34.700 --> 43:37.700]  So you have them and you can grow those
[43:37.700 --> 43:40.700]  And you can learn
[43:40.700 --> 43:43.700]  And you look through for those familiar faces
[43:43.700 --> 43:46.700]  That looks like where you see a trend
[43:46.700 --> 43:49.700]  Where you go all the females that look like this
[43:49.700 --> 43:52.700]  They're all really good
[43:52.700 --> 43:55.700]  And then you go to the male
[43:55.700 --> 43:58.700]  And you're like there's that guy
[43:58.700 --> 44:01.700]  I know that plant
[44:01.700 --> 44:04.700]  And you can go ahead and say I have six
[44:04.700 --> 44:07.700]  Or three or two
[44:07.700 --> 44:10.700]  And put those on stuff
[44:10.700 --> 44:13.700]  Everybody wants to get the tall plant
[44:13.700 --> 44:16.700]  Or the short
[44:16.700 --> 44:19.700]  You have to learn what the population looks like
[44:19.700 --> 44:22.700]  I was talking about things coming back again
[44:22.700 --> 44:25.700]  I only hear a few people ever say that
[44:25.700 --> 44:28.700]  But you probably saw that to an extent
[44:28.700 --> 44:31.700]  Breeding other plants
[44:31.700 --> 44:34.700]  Non-cannabis plants
[44:34.700 --> 44:37.700]  Where you start to see trends
[44:37.700 --> 44:40.700]  One thing
[44:40.700 --> 44:43.700]  That I ran across a couple of times
[44:43.700 --> 44:46.700]  When I found a Romulan male
[44:46.700 --> 44:49.700]  It was a typical female
[44:49.700 --> 44:52.700]  Perfect structure
[44:52.700 --> 44:55.700]  Branching
[44:55.700 --> 44:58.700]  Stems were stiff
[44:58.700 --> 45:01.700]  And branches were strong
[45:01.700 --> 45:04.700]  Stinky kind of hashy
[45:04.700 --> 45:07.700]  And like I said
[45:07.700 --> 45:10.700]  I thought it was a female
[45:10.700 --> 45:13.700]  And then all of a sudden
[45:13.700 --> 45:16.700]  I had to go back and look for my
[45:16.700 --> 45:19.700]  One of my breedings
[45:19.700 --> 45:22.700]  Warbirds
[45:22.700 --> 45:25.700]  But yeah
[45:25.700 --> 45:28.700]  Once in a while you get those
[45:28.700 --> 45:31.700]  And you get them to where they're beautiful
[45:31.700 --> 45:34.700]  Structure and everything
[45:34.700 --> 45:37.700]  And they're a male
[45:37.700 --> 45:40.700]  And if they have what you're looking for
[45:40.700 --> 45:43.700]  They have a nice smell to them
[45:43.700 --> 45:46.700]  And they had some
[45:46.700 --> 45:49.700]  Trichomes you could see on them
[45:49.700 --> 45:52.700]  A lot of times you don't get that
[45:52.700 --> 45:55.700]  I don't have to have them
[45:55.700 --> 45:58.700]  But I prefer it if there were some trichomes on those
[45:58.700 --> 46:01.700]  I don't know
[46:01.700 --> 46:04.700]  It's kind of hit and miss
[46:04.700 --> 46:07.700]  I've had some bad ones
[46:07.700 --> 46:10.700]  But I don't have to have them
[46:10.700 --> 46:13.700]  I'll let them grow out
[46:13.700 --> 46:16.700]  And make a decision later on
[46:16.700 --> 46:21.030]  And do the selections
[46:21.030 --> 46:24.030]  The biggest trick too
[46:24.030 --> 46:27.030]  Is to not use males that just suck
[46:27.030 --> 46:30.030]  To go okay
[46:30.030 --> 46:33.030]  This is not a good plant
[46:33.030 --> 46:36.030]  Because back in the old days
[46:36.030 --> 46:39.030]  You would pick open pollinated vegetable seeds
[46:39.030 --> 46:42.030]  And go I got a male of it
[46:42.030 --> 46:45.030]  And be like I like this one
[46:45.030 --> 46:48.030]  It's more manageable
[46:48.030 --> 46:51.030]  Keep the females for their seed garden
[46:51.030 --> 46:54.030]  And be like I'm just going to keep these small ones
[46:54.030 --> 46:57.030]  So I don't waste the good plants on seed
[46:57.030 --> 47:00.030]  And they wind up selecting the wrong direction
[47:00.030 --> 47:03.030]  So definitely
[47:03.030 --> 47:06.030]  I've had some bad plants
[47:06.030 --> 47:09.030]  Thinking they were good for breeding
[47:09.030 --> 47:12.030]  Because they were manageable
[47:12.030 --> 47:15.030]  And then they would be breeding to be
[47:15.030 --> 47:18.030]  I had one that I can still remember
[47:18.030 --> 47:21.030]  In 1999 that was like that
[47:21.030 --> 47:24.030]  And it was like
[47:24.030 --> 47:27.030]  I looked at it and I went this is my nicest plant
[47:27.030 --> 47:30.030]  I know it's got to be a female
[47:30.030 --> 47:33.030]  It's not like a pecker pole
[47:33.030 --> 47:36.030]  Trying to stretch
[47:36.030 --> 47:39.030]  And then it was a male
[47:39.030 --> 47:42.030]  And I was like all right I'm going to use it
[47:42.030 --> 47:45.030]  And from that a lot of cool things came out of that
[47:45.030 --> 47:48.030]  Because it was really just a super nice plant
[47:48.030 --> 47:51.030]  All around
[47:51.030 --> 47:54.030]  But people tend to in the old days
[47:54.030 --> 47:57.030]  People would tell me don't worry if the males have branches
[47:57.030 --> 48:00.030]  And I would look at the structure
[48:00.030 --> 48:03.030]  Assuming the male version is always less branchy
[48:03.030 --> 48:06.030]  Than the female version
[48:06.030 --> 48:09.030]  And I watched a lot of people breed things
[48:09.030 --> 48:12.030]  That did not have a lot of
[48:12.030 --> 48:15.030]  Bud sites and branches
[48:15.030 --> 48:18.030]  And I went away from that after trying it a couple of times
[48:18.030 --> 48:21.030]  And realized pecker pole plants
[48:21.030 --> 48:24.030]  It's okay in certain things
[48:24.030 --> 48:27.030]  But if you pick one and it has no branches
[48:27.030 --> 48:30.030]  You usually plant the seeds from them
[48:30.030 --> 48:33.030]  And you go oh geez these have less branches
[48:33.030 --> 48:36.030]  And just in one generation you got rid of a lot of branchiness
[48:36.030 --> 48:39.030]  From what you were used to
[48:39.030 --> 48:42.030]  I'm sure other people have different
[48:42.030 --> 48:45.030]  Criteria for males
[48:45.030 --> 48:48.030]  That's just basically what I do
[48:48.030 --> 48:51.030]  And then you get the feel of the plants
[48:51.030 --> 48:54.030]  And you can tell pretty much what you're looking for
[48:54.030 --> 48:57.030]  It's not 100% like I said
[48:57.030 --> 49:00.030]  There's a lot of different criteria
[49:00.030 --> 49:03.030]  But I tend to just use those for me
[49:03.030 --> 49:06.030]  For sure
[49:06.030 --> 49:10.300]  There's a million ways to do it
[49:10.300 --> 49:13.300]  That was my male angel that I used in a lot of my old work
[49:13.300 --> 49:16.300]  The structure for a male selection
[49:16.300 --> 49:19.300]  That I used to choose for
[49:20.300 --> 49:23.300]  Branching, shorter size
[49:23.300 --> 49:26.300]  I never wanted the plant to be straight up
[49:26.300 --> 49:29.300]  He was actually shorter than all the females
[49:29.300 --> 49:32.300]  That I selected through when I kept them
[49:32.300 --> 49:35.300]  I kept three females and a seventh male out of there
[49:35.300 --> 49:38.300]  He branched a lot
[49:38.300 --> 49:41.300]  Did not stretch
[49:41.300 --> 49:44.300]  Had a lot of leaf structure
[49:44.300 --> 49:47.300]  Because I wanted him to be able to photosynthesize a lot
[49:48.300 --> 49:51.300]  I didn't want to have spindly, stretchy plants
[49:51.300 --> 49:54.300]  Looking for sun
[49:54.300 --> 49:57.300]  It's easier for me to remove leaves
[49:57.300 --> 50:00.300]  Than to get a plant to grow more leaves
[50:00.300 --> 50:03.300]  I was looking for his structure
[50:03.300 --> 50:06.300]  And a lot of his progeny
[50:06.300 --> 50:09.300]  Which ends up showing up in a lot of the new space cheese stuff
[50:09.300 --> 50:12.300]  But definitely showed up in everything he was crossed to
[50:12.300 --> 50:15.300]  I use that male in 200 different crosses
[50:16.300 --> 50:19.300]  I used Romulan for many years
[50:19.300 --> 50:22.300]  I see that you used Romulan too
[50:22.300 --> 50:25.300]  It's a plant that I held quite fond of myself
[50:25.300 --> 50:28.300]  It's one of the first medicinal plants
[50:28.300 --> 50:31.300]  That I started to breed with
[50:31.300 --> 50:34.300]  It was the heart of my own line
[50:34.300 --> 50:37.300]  That I called Space Kush
[50:37.300 --> 50:40.300]  That I made in the end of 2004
[50:40.300 --> 50:43.300]  And I ran through breeding and reversals in 2005
[50:44.300 --> 50:47.300]  I ran him through every female I came in contact with
[50:47.300 --> 50:50.300]  So I could find out what stuff he was passing homogenous
[50:50.300 --> 50:53.300]  What was his dominant trait
[50:53.300 --> 50:56.300]  Over the years I eventually found out
[50:56.300 --> 50:59.300]  That he was going to be a plant that short
[50:59.300 --> 51:02.300]  He's going to cut flower time
[51:02.300 --> 51:05.300]  He can induce color in plants
[51:05.300 --> 51:08.300]  He passed a lot of grape and pine
[51:08.300 --> 51:11.300]  I kept this male for 15 years
[51:12.300 --> 51:15.300]  There's a couple of Romulans
[51:15.300 --> 51:18.300]  They have one up in Canada that was crossed with something
[51:18.300 --> 51:21.300]  And then mine that I use
[51:21.300 --> 51:24.300]  I got from Classic Seeds
[51:24.300 --> 51:27.300]  Who's passed away
[51:27.300 --> 51:30.300]  He got it from Romulan Joe himself
[51:30.300 --> 51:33.300]  He met him somehow
[51:33.300 --> 51:36.300]  I'm not sure exactly
[51:36.300 --> 51:39.300]  I never really got to hear the whole story about it
[51:40.300 --> 51:43.300]  I've had some people ask me from Canada
[51:43.300 --> 51:46.300]  I'm trying to think
[51:46.300 --> 51:49.300]  Somebody crossed it
[51:49.300 --> 51:52.300]  Maybe you guys know
[51:52.300 --> 51:55.300]  It's a different cross up there than a regular pure Romulan
[51:55.300 --> 51:58.300]  What was the name of that?
[51:58.300 --> 52:01.300]  I believe they crossed it to a white widow
[52:01.300 --> 52:04.300]  I mean a white rhino up there
[52:04.300 --> 52:07.300]  White rhino, yeah
[52:08.300 --> 52:11.300]  My Romulan male was a squatty
[52:11.300 --> 52:14.300]  Branchy beautiful one
[52:14.300 --> 52:17.300]  I've never really grown it that much before
[52:17.300 --> 52:20.300]  But I did do a seed increase
[52:20.300 --> 52:23.300]  And make some pure seed
[52:23.300 --> 52:26.300]  And I sent my buddy those seeds
[52:26.300 --> 52:29.300]  And his buddy in Texas
[52:29.300 --> 52:32.300]  I sent him some
[52:32.300 --> 52:35.300]  I'd like to work with that a little more
[52:36.300 --> 52:39.300]  I like the structure
[52:39.300 --> 52:42.300]  And smell of that plant
[52:42.300 --> 52:48.370]  It's a nice plant
[52:48.370 --> 52:51.370]  This is a clone of the 96 Romulan
[52:51.370 --> 52:54.370]  That I used to work with right here
[52:54.370 --> 52:57.370]  Being transplanted into a 1 gallon
[52:57.370 --> 53:00.370]  I used to keep a 4x4 tin
[53:00.370 --> 53:03.370]  Nice
[53:03.370 --> 53:07.960]  There's a shelf in the top
[53:08.960 --> 53:11.960]  I held that clone off and on for 15 years
[53:11.960 --> 53:14.960]  The longest I held it was 12 years
[53:14.960 --> 53:17.960]  And then I let it go for a while
[53:17.960 --> 53:20.960]  And then it came back and I held it for a few more years
[53:20.960 --> 53:27.920]  I really like that Romulan
[53:27.920 --> 53:30.920]  She's a nice plant for breeding
[53:30.920 --> 53:38.900]  She's a killer medicine that's for sure
[53:38.900 --> 53:41.900]  I got a question for you guys
[53:41.900 --> 53:48.610]  You want to go ahead?
[53:48.610 --> 53:51.610]  Go for it
[53:51.610 --> 53:54.610]  I'm doing some research
[53:54.610 --> 53:57.610]  On terpenes
[53:57.610 --> 54:00.610]  That
[54:00.610 --> 54:03.610]  Lulu, go on
[54:03.610 --> 54:06.610]  My little dog
[54:06.610 --> 54:09.610]  For treating cancer
[54:09.610 --> 54:12.610]  And
[54:12.610 --> 54:15.610]  I'm just working on a little list
[54:16.610 --> 54:19.610]  There's some that I'm looking for
[54:19.610 --> 54:22.610]  Different ones
[54:22.610 --> 54:25.610]  I had some off of
[54:25.610 --> 54:28.610]  Another Colombian I don't have anymore
[54:28.610 --> 54:31.610]  That had some camphor
[54:31.610 --> 54:34.610]  And geranyl
[54:34.610 --> 54:37.610]  In it years ago
[54:37.610 --> 54:40.610]  And then
[54:40.610 --> 54:43.610]  Linanol
[54:44.610 --> 54:47.610]  Humaline is a good one
[54:47.610 --> 54:50.610]  What I'm trying to do instead of just rambling on about that
[54:50.610 --> 54:53.610]  Is trying to get a
[54:53.610 --> 54:56.610]  Breeding that has
[54:56.610 --> 54:59.610]  A combination of some of those in it
[54:59.610 --> 55:02.610]  And then start working with it
[55:02.610 --> 55:05.610]  I take oil at night
[55:05.610 --> 55:08.610]  CBD and THC
[55:08.610 --> 55:11.610]  What is it?
[55:12.610 --> 55:15.610]  THC line was
[55:15.610 --> 55:18.610]  And then the CBD was
[55:18.610 --> 55:24.420]  My memory is not what it used to be
[55:24.420 --> 55:27.420]  They're all really good
[55:27.420 --> 55:30.420]  They're done from a company in Berkeley
[55:30.420 --> 55:33.420]  That my friend is good friends with
[55:33.420 --> 55:36.420]  And
[55:36.420 --> 55:39.420]  I take it and my brother-in-law
[55:39.420 --> 55:42.420]  Takes it and my sister
[55:42.420 --> 55:45.420]  Takes it
[55:45.420 --> 55:51.420]  And they work together
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.420]  I really want to pursue that more
[55:54.420 --> 55:57.420]  To pass that on for people who need it
[55:57.420 --> 56:00.420]  And you were talking
[56:00.420 --> 56:03.420]  CBG too, right?
[56:03.420 --> 56:06.420]  Yeah
[56:06.420 --> 56:09.420]  My redhead
[56:09.420 --> 56:14.420]  which normally there's 1% or something,
[56:15.900 --> 56:17.340]  it's a little more, but I mean,
[56:17.340 --> 56:19.940]  there may be others that have more than that,
[56:19.940 --> 56:23.340]  but that's the headband from Lumpa.
[56:24.580 --> 56:29.580]  I got that from Ryan and then across the Colombian red
[56:30.420 --> 56:31.260]  with that.
[56:32.660 --> 56:37.660]  So, yeah, that's a nice one.
[56:40.060 --> 56:43.100]  That headband, I'll make a real quick story.
[56:43.100 --> 56:46.060]  If Bam was on here, he'd be laughing.
[56:46.060 --> 56:48.460]  We were on our way to the Emerald Cup
[56:48.460 --> 56:51.820]  and I don't normally smoke when I'm driving.
[56:51.820 --> 56:56.180]  I mean, I get too fucked up and I don't know.
[56:56.180 --> 56:57.580]  Anyway, I just don't normally do it.
[56:57.580 --> 56:58.900]  And he said, hey, you wanna have a little joint?
[56:58.900 --> 57:00.700]  And I said, sure, I'll have a couple of hits.
[57:00.700 --> 57:04.220]  And he had the headband and I'm smoking away, man.
[57:04.220 --> 57:07.220]  Before I know it, I've had five or six hits
[57:07.220 --> 57:10.020]  and I've got the vice grip on the steering wheel
[57:10.020 --> 57:11.780]  just completely ripped.
[57:13.780 --> 57:16.500]  Driving down the freeway, man,
[57:16.500 --> 57:19.860]  I got the full focus on the road and I'm just,
[57:19.860 --> 57:21.460]  oh man, it just hit me so hard.
[57:21.460 --> 57:22.780]  It was unbelievable.
[57:22.780 --> 57:25.020]  And then I'll never forget that.
[57:25.020 --> 57:27.660]  And then when I wanted to work with it,
[57:27.660 --> 57:30.460]  I got a hold of Radio Ridge
[57:30.460 --> 57:33.860]  and then he brought me some of that.
[57:33.860 --> 57:35.580]  I did that on,
[57:35.620 --> 57:37.340]  because I don't normally even work with any cuts.
[57:37.340 --> 57:39.700]  That's the first time I've used cuts myself.
[57:39.700 --> 57:41.620]  I'm worried about that.
[57:41.620 --> 57:43.860]  Everybody should be, is that hop virus.
[57:43.860 --> 57:47.220]  Man, that's a devastating disease.
[57:50.690 --> 57:52.410]  You guys had any issues with that?
[57:54.890 --> 57:59.530]  Me and my buddy started testing stuff last year
[57:59.530 --> 58:02.410]  after kind of the scare of going, whoa.
[58:02.410 --> 58:04.530]  So I'm talking to people and being like,
[58:04.530 --> 58:06.170]  yeah, we tested everything.
[58:06.770 --> 58:09.770]  80, 90% of our libraries are dirty.
[58:09.770 --> 58:11.850]  And we're like, damn, okay.
[58:11.850 --> 58:15.010]  So we started testing things and I tested,
[58:16.170 --> 58:18.810]  I tested what I had that were older cuts
[58:18.810 --> 58:20.090]  that I was like, okay, well,
[58:20.090 --> 58:22.410]  I'm more concerned about these.
[58:22.410 --> 58:25.970]  I didn't have anything that seemed like it was infected
[58:25.970 --> 58:27.810]  just based on like symptoms.
[58:27.810 --> 58:30.330]  Although some things don't ever show symptoms.
[58:30.330 --> 58:31.530]  They just kind of carry it
[58:31.530 --> 58:33.770]  until they get unhealthy or whatever.
[58:34.290 --> 58:38.290]  But I had, I wound up having one cut that I got back
[58:38.290 --> 58:40.770]  and it was just never quite the same
[58:40.770 --> 58:42.730]  as it was supposed to be.
[58:42.730 --> 58:47.010]  And I tested it and after seeing like,
[58:47.010 --> 58:48.050]  okay, it's a little different.
[58:48.050 --> 58:49.890]  I was like, damn, this might've been the one
[58:49.890 --> 58:53.290]  that I got back that just made my whole library be shit now.
[58:53.290 --> 58:54.770]  I don't know.
[58:54.770 --> 58:56.690]  So I started testing everything else
[58:56.690 --> 58:59.570]  and it turned out that that one cut was dirty,
[58:59.570 --> 59:01.770]  but that I had avoided somehow
[59:02.610 --> 59:04.170]  because I didn't know about it.
[59:04.170 --> 59:07.130]  I would think I would've just cut this, cut that,
[59:07.130 --> 59:09.210]  made everything dirty and all that.
[59:09.210 --> 59:13.290]  But somehow I just have one clone that I've had for,
[59:13.290 --> 59:18.050]  it's gotta be, I'd say four, five years now
[59:18.050 --> 59:19.130]  or something like that.
[59:19.130 --> 59:23.290]  And I got it back dirty, obviously,
[59:23.290 --> 59:25.530]  and it's been dirty and it hasn't got
[59:25.530 --> 59:27.610]  any of my other stuff infected luckily,
[59:27.610 --> 59:29.090]  which to me is just crazy.
[59:29.090 --> 59:34.090]  But when you test, you have to test,
[59:35.490 --> 59:37.370]  like five places on the plant.
[59:37.370 --> 59:39.410]  You wanna test like the older growth,
[59:39.410 --> 59:42.030]  that's the least healthy, whatever it looks like,
[59:42.030 --> 59:43.850]  would be the most likely to be infected.
[59:43.850 --> 59:45.770]  You can't just take one healthy little piece
[59:45.770 --> 59:47.370]  and go, oh, these are all clean.
[59:48.730 --> 59:53.130]  So I went through and everything I had wound up being clean
[59:53.130 --> 59:55.530]  except for this one plant, which I've kept
[59:55.530 --> 59:57.690]  and now I keep it in its own area.
[59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.690]  And so anyway, I was surprised to find out
[01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.210]  that it doesn't seem like it's quite as easy to spread
[01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.850]  as I was worried about.
[01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.730]  Initially, we started testing with a lab
[01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:14.170]  that does what they call LAMP.
[01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.490]  I don't know, it's some kind of an acronym
[01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.130]  for whatever the process is.
[01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:25.130]  And it is, in my opinion, not,
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.890]  it doesn't work, it's just not effective.
[01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.370]  It basically, like there was,
[01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.050]  initially there was like positives on plants
[01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.010]  that were rooting in like seven days,
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.250]  which usually is one of the first signs you see.
[01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:42.930]  Like with this plant, I knew I was like,
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.130]  this plant used to be the easiest thing to root
[01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.930]  when we had it back around 2000.
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.170]  And now it's like, I go to root it
[01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:54.290]  and the thing takes three weeks to root.
[01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.410]  I was like, it just seems like something's wrong with it.
[01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:59.050]  The weed isn't quite as resonance.
[01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.610]  It's such a real crazy profile
[01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.530]  that it still is amazing weed,
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.370]  but it just didn't seem quite right.
[01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.170]  It rooted slow.
[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.250]  And so I expected it to be dirty,
[01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.770]  tested it with the LAMP testing, it was dirty.
[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.650]  A couple other things showed up as being dirty.
[01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:18.330]  Didn't make sense that they were dirty.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:21.050]  We switched over, we started doing PCR testing,
[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.450]  which is way more accurate
[01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:26.170]  and even shows you the level of what's there.
[01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:29.210]  And all of a sudden it was like,
[01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:32.210]  no, all these things that seem like they're super clean,
[01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:34.290]  they're clean, but these ones that seem like
[01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.210]  they're super dirty are dirty.
[01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.910]  And you can actually, once you know,
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.730]  then every time you go to test something different,
[01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:46.170]  you can send the lab doing the PCR testing,
[01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.570]  a couple of the plants that you know are dirty
[01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:51.410]  and you can actually test the lab.
[01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:53.110]  Like can the lab detect it every time?
[01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.930]  And every time these plants that seem dirty, they pop dirty.
[01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.490]  It's like, okay, this is dirty.
[01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.490]  It's always dirty.
[01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:01.090]  It's always showing dirty.
[01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.750]  And then in the LAMP testing,
[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.310]  it was like, they would show clean.
[01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.890]  All of these, this plant would show clean.
[01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:08.930]  All of you do five tests and three of them are clean,
[01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.930]  but you go to PCR and you do five tests and five are dirty.
[01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:16.330]  And then you do the ones that you're like,
[01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:17.770]  these don't seem dirty.
[01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:20.970]  It's weird that they're testing dirty.
[01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.690]  And then they show, you look and you see,
[01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:26.690]  you can look at the graph and go, no, these are clean.
[01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.530]  And in still doing the same thing,
[01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.190]  testing five samples of the same plant,
[01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.010]  really going through and making sure,
[01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.690]  and then sending the known dirty ones.
[01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:37.330]  And every time you do it, it's like,
[01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:40.370]  the dirty ones are dirty, the clean ones are clean.
[01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:43.570]  And so we learned in the process that
[01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:46.950]  the PCR testing is the way to go.
[01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.850]  And there's a lab that does everything really fast.
[01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.130]  It's not super expensive.
[01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.810]  It's called Tumi Genomics, T-U-M-I Genomics.
[01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:02.130]  And basically for a thousand bucks, you can do 50 tests.
[01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:07.130]  So you can do the 10 most important plants and really know.
[01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:10.210]  And then you can also test seeds.
[01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:13.530]  You can test plants that came out of seeds from plants
[01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:15.810]  that you know were infected and see
[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:19.210]  if those ones come out infected too.
[01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.450]  And it seems like it can pass to seed,
[01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:23.490]  which is a big concern.
[01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:25.170]  Cause everybody goes, oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.730]  I just, I'll just, I'm just using it to make seeds.
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.970]  And then they're selling the seeds and then people go,
[01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.210]  oh, it's not that big of a deal anyway.
[01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.050]  And I'm like, well, you know,
[01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.770]  you can test that plant for a hundred bucks.
[01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.970]  You could know if that seed mom is gonna be a dirty thing,
[01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:42.290]  passing this all over the community.
[01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:45.070]  And, you know, a lot of people making seeds are like,
[01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.750]  oh, it's fine.
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.790]  And, you know, they're scared to death
[01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:50.710]  of all this irrational shit.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.790]  And then they think that it's fine to just like,
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.630]  not worry about it when you can test them for a little bit,
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.470]  you know?
[01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:01.550]  So I think it's an important thing to do at this point.
[01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.270]  And I was really glad to, cause for a second I was like,
[01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.790]  I mean, I basically, I think I was holding probably
[01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:10.990]  at the moment what I really kind of got,
[01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.750]  like kind of like the reality hit me like,
[01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.310]  oh, this can pass, this passes like this.
[01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:19.110]  And I'm making all these cuttings and, you know,
[01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:20.550]  everything and I'm going, okay,
[01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.950]  well now all these plants I have to test.
[01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.470]  If I know someone else has them,
[01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:27.190]  I can either pay a bunch of money to test them
[01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:28.290]  or I can get rid of stuff.
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:31.490]  And I think I went from having, I don't know,
[01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:36.490]  like, you know, 80 different things I was holding to,
[01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.770]  you know, 10 or 15 or something,
[01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:42.430]  because I was just like, okay,
[01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.790]  I can save a lot of money by getting rid of these,
[01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:48.350]  if I have these things that I've got recently,
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.990]  just get rid of them, you know?
[01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:54.990]  And so I had just taken new moms of everything.
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.790]  So I had like a dozen new plants
[01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.730]  of like everything in the library.
[01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.470]  Some of them may be only a couple of new ones.
[01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:08.510]  And so it was like, here I am with these like 400
[01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.870]  beautiful plants and I was like,
[01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.310]  well, I can either test all these
[01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:14.350]  and pay all the money to test them,
[01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.950]  or I can just throw them away.
[01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.670]  So I wound up with a compost pile full of basically
[01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:22.350]  like a whole, what would have been a whole huge run.
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.630]  Well, I could have made more seeds than I've ever made,
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.110]  but I was like, well, I'd have to test them all.
[01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:28.470]  And I don't really want to do that.
[01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.590]  So I just narrowed it all down.
[01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.830]  And then of all the things that I couldn't get rid of,
[01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.830]  because no one else has them,
[01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.390]  I'm the only one who holds them because they're mine.
[01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.950]  Everything wound up being clean,
[01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:41.630]  except for this one thing that I've had
[01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:43.030]  the whole time with them.
[01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.870]  And what it did tell me was that
[01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.710]  it wasn't quite as nightmarish as I thought.
[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:51.750]  I thought like, oh, well, what if I'm bumping
[01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:54.230]  into this plant and then I'm touching this plant,
[01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.710]  or if I have like a thrip here and it's landing
[01:05:56.710 --> 01:06:00.630]  on this plant and all that stuff going on,
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:02.790]  I was like, okay, well, I probably,
[01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.430]  everything's gotta be dirty.
[01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:06.950]  And then when I really actually tested everything,
[01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:11.710]  I was like, okay, it's not quite as sketchy
[01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:14.830]  as I thought it was, because otherwise everything
[01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.710]  would have been dirty because I wasn't in the habit
[01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:20.590]  of going, okay, I'm gonna do a 30,
[01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:25.590]  you're supposed to do a 30 second soak in 25% chlorine.
[01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:28.110]  And there's a couple other products that work as well,
[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.190]  but isopropyl alcohol doesn't work,
[01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.150]  hydrogen peroxide doesn't work.
[01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.550]  And I always thought like from doing like mushroom work,
[01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:41.510]  like alcohol's fine, that makes things sterile.
[01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.830]  But it doesn't kill viroids.
[01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.270]  So anyway.
[01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:48.750]  Have you tried STS or silver?
[01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:52.490]  I'm not gonna try shit, I know chlorine works.
[01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:54.870]  I'm not gonna experiment with spreading the shit
[01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:58.150]  around myself, I'm like, okay, chlorine, I can get it.
[01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:59.950]  It was funny though, because chlorine you couldn't get
[01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:01.230]  for a while because of COVID,
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:02.790]  it was like impossible to get it.
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.430]  And I started doing everything clean right
[01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.470]  when I was able to get it back again, luckily.
[01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.550]  So like now I buy chlorine at Costco,
[01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:13.990]  I'm like, all right, I buy boxes of three gallons of chlorine
[01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:15.510]  so that I can make that soak.
[01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:20.590]  And you can burn your blades too with a hot blade
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.910]  and that works too, you can drop them back in water
[01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:25.710]  or whatever after they're burnt.
[01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.470]  But for me, it's just easier to have some,
[01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:32.590]  to have like basically I do, I wind up doing like 30% chlorine
[01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.310]  and the chlorine is only good for about eight hours
[01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:38.270]  because chlorine off gas is faster
[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:39.890]  than almost any other molecule.
[01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:43.330]  So you have to have the, so I do it instead of 25,
[01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:46.810]  I do it like 30, so it's good for a few hours for sure.
[01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:51.170]  And then I just have the several sets of scissors
[01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.970]  and I put them in the back and I pull from the front
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:58.770]  and then at least there, but like I said,
[01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:01.610]  I was doing everything just any old way
[01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.330]  and I managed to not spread it all around.
[01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.570]  So even though there's potential to cut this
[01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:10.790]  and then cut that and spread it really easy,
[01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:15.410]  I think as long as you're not just cutting on this
[01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:18.090]  and then cutting on that or leafing plants
[01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:20.490]  and having the goo all over your hands
[01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:22.610]  from the juice of the plant
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:24.650]  and touching the wounds on the plant,
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:30.610]  it seems like you'll probably be all right,
[01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.710]  but definitely it's a huge concern
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.490]  and it's not hard to have your blades in a rotation
[01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:40.650]  from front to back or a dirty one and a clean one.
[01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:42.770]  However, it's easier for you to keep it straight
[01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.730]  in your head, but.
[01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:47.890]  Yeah, when you came up there, somebody put up there,
[01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:52.250]  I had read that probably around 10% or a little less
[01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:57.250]  will be passed on in your seeds.
[01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:01.850]  And I mean, I didn't breed with any of those.
[01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.290]  So I ended up throwing all the soil away.
[01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:05.490]  I didn't even want it around.
[01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:09.770]  I'm not sure if, I didn't want to take a chance
[01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.890]  on infecting all my work the next year.
[01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:16.410]  So I just got rid of it and, you know,
[01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:20.650]  bleach the pots before you use them or whatever.
[01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:25.490]  I just ended up using new pots, but yeah,
[01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:28.090]  it's devastating.
[01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:32.650]  That's why I'm leery on cuts.
[01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:37.290]  You got to really want something bad to take a cut
[01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:38.890]  and then you've got to really make sure
[01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:40.850]  that it's not infected.
[01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:42.810]  I mean, you know, when you work, you guys know,
[01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:47.810]  you work many years, do breeding and trying to perfect
[01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.250]  your line you're working on and then you have something
[01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:54.850]  like that happen and it kind of, you know, not kind of,
[01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:57.890]  kind of, it just ruins everything.
[01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:01.530]  So I tend to not do cuts.
[01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:05.290]  That's just me, you know, and some of these old cuts,
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.970]  I wish they would have made seed out of it
[01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.530]  and then backed them up from seed
[01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:11.890]  because you lose cuts sometimes.
[01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:16.890]  I mean, like Bob, he could keep cuts for,
[01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:18.210]  he's real good at it.
[01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.610]  I'm not that good with them.
[01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:23.930]  Yeah, it's just not, I'm not good at that at all.
[01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:27.970]  So keeping cuts, other people are better than me, so.
[01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:33.610]  Just quickly, Jackson, if you had some cut
[01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:39.650]  that you just want to keep, but it has hoplate and viroid,
[01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:42.010]  I mean, is that a tissue culture project then
[01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.690]  to kind of clean it up and?
[01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:46.970]  So what I did with it was I went ahead
[01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:50.210]  and made some back cross seeds with it.
[01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:54.170]  And I went ahead and did, I did a cross
[01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:58.730]  and I grew about 50 of the F1s
[01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:01.690]  and I only got one that was anything like the mom,
[01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.570]  but it smelled exactly like the mom.
[01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:05.850]  And it's one of the rare plants
[01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.690]  that a stem rub really counts
[01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:10.450]  because the whole plant reeks of the finished weed
[01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.010]  the whole time it grows.
[01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:17.290]  And so what I did was I went ahead and took that male
[01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:20.050]  and I made back cross seeds on the clone.
[01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:24.130]  And I think it's pretty likely that I'll get more
[01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:27.690]  than one out of 50 now just because it's a new pairing.
[01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:30.290]  You never know, but that's what I'm hoping for.
[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:32.090]  So I want to grow out more of them
[01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:35.370]  and I want to find females that are the same thing
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:37.410]  and that are totally clean.
[01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:42.050]  And ideally I'd like to tissue culture it,
[01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:45.770]  but if I don't wind up being able to do it
[01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:48.650]  and get a clean tissue culture version,
[01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:51.690]  I'd at least like to still make a clean seed version.
[01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:56.130]  And now that I'm not quite as desperately afraid
[01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.450]  of it just being around,
[01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:01.730]  having a plant that's infected like on the premises,
[01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:06.210]  I would go ahead and grow those and look through them.
[01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:09.170]  And I'd like to lock it down into a seed version.
[01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:12.350]  And what I'll do is make sure that any of the females,
[01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:16.770]  they're gonna have to test clean for me
[01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:19.770]  to keep them around and make seed from them.
[01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:23.290]  And then I'll do that process
[01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:27.770]  to be able to make a seed version of it
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:31.410]  and then not be as worried about the original clone.
[01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.690]  You always want the original
[01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:36.410]  because the original has the most of the genetic material
[01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:37.970]  in it that you could ever want.
[01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.930]  But it's one of those things where
[01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:48.190]  some of these tissue culture labs, I think can get rid of it.
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:51.070]  I think if you can get your plant really, really healthy
[01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:53.830]  and do testing and take like different clones
[01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:54.910]  from all over the plant,
[01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:58.430]  eventually you might get one shoot that doesn't have it.
[01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:01.350]  And you can just kind of, in a sense,
[01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.150]  do what they do in tissue culture,
[01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:06.110]  which is get a piece of the plant
[01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:09.370]  that instead of it being a microscopic meristem,
[01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:11.910]  maybe you captured a two inch meristem
[01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:13.950]  and it is all grown today
[01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:15.830]  and the viroid hasn't kept up with it.
[01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.550]  Cause the viroid is a really weird thing,
[01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:22.070]  the way it piggybacks on the plant's life cycle
[01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:24.270]  and the cell reproduction.
[01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:27.830]  It's not in the plant like nitrogen or something.
[01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.990]  It's like it moves,
[01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:33.330]  but the plant can move ahead of it in different places.
[01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.790]  And so you might be able to clone around it
[01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:36.630]  and stuff like that.
[01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:40.310]  But anyway, my point being that some tissue culture labs
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.790]  aren't doing it well enough to actually be growing past it.
[01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:45.950]  They're taking a meristem and they're growing it
[01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:48.110]  and it still has it in it anyway.
[01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:51.910]  And then now you just spent $8,000 or $4,000
[01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:55.130]  or whatever it is to get back dirty plants.
[01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:58.790]  So for me, I'm like, okay,
[01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:02.270]  if somebody wants to do it for me for free, right on.
[01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:06.030]  But at the same time, I know the way that breeding works,
[01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:09.230]  that if it's a special enough plant,
[01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:12.470]  it's worth going ahead and taking those back cross seeds
[01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.190]  and taking some other F1s I made with it,
[01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:18.190]  find where it pops out and it's really it
[01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:21.990]  and go ahead and breed those forward
[01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.630]  and maybe self some of them.
[01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:27.150]  Or the other option that I'll probably do too
[01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:29.810]  is self that particular plant
[01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:34.230]  and then find the ones that are the closest to it.
[01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:38.470]  And then I try to find one that's almost the same,
[01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:42.190]  but isn't part of that 8 to 12% that's dirty.
[01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:46.150]  And then take that one and use that as the new mom
[01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:47.190]  because it's still pure
[01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.190]  and it's gonna have less
[01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:52.330]  of the original genetic material available.
[01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.730]  But I've bred with this particular plant
[01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.150]  and a lot of the stuff that's in it
[01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:58.030]  isn't really what I want anyway.
[01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:01.670]  What is in it, because I got it to pop out one in 50
[01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:04.310]  in a true F1,
[01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.350]  I know that it has to be like,
[01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:15.790]  what in my experience, what is a dominant thing,
[01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:18.030]  a dominant group of traits basically,
[01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:22.070]  like a few different genes that come through in an F1,
[01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:25.710]  but that is really not that frequent in the gene pool.
[01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.350]  So like you usually look at things and you go,
[01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:29.710]  okay, if there's a lot of it,
[01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:32.030]  when you pop the seeds, you're like, oh, it's dominant.
[01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:33.590]  But dominance is really what happens
[01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.390]  when you outcross things and make a fresh F1.
[01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.770]  If it pops up in the first generation,
[01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.190]  then that's dominance.
[01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:46.170]  So it seems to me that now that I made that back cross
[01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:49.970]  and did it, I should be able to get it to come out again.
[01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:53.850]  And my point in all this ramble is that
[01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.490]  it's not really, everything that's in there
[01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:00.130]  isn't really what I want anyway.
[01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:01.890]  It's this really specific thing.
[01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.610]  So I wouldn't be super mad if I lose a little bit
[01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:07.210]  of what is in that original clone
[01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:12.430]  to get it to have what that actual phenotype is.
[01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:16.770]  I don't need all the background bulk genotype
[01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.810]  of everything that's in that whole thing.
[01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:22.210]  I really want this one thing that comes out
[01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.050]  that is what I'm used to.
[01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:28.450]  So I wouldn't be that bummed to have an S1 of it
[01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.210]  as long as it is just as good.
[01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.970]  I'm not super worried about losing a little bit
[01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:36.770]  of the variation that it holds
[01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:42.050]  because it is kind of like the thing in there
[01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:43.250]  that is the most special.
[01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.130]  It's not like there's a bunch of stuff
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:46.450]  way above and beyond it.
[01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.050]  It was already special and whoever cloned it out of that,
[01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:50.730]  what the hell it popped out of, I don't know,
[01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:53.370]  but it's super, super bomb.
[01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.170]  And so then that's an easy way to be like,
[01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:58.690]  okay, well, I don't need to save this clone so much.
[01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:00.850]  I need to save this particular thing.
[01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.210]  And I wouldn't mind that being just
[01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:06.810]  a slimmed down version of the gene pool
[01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:07.890]  if I have to do that.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.380]  Yeah, I'm looking at some comments in the chat
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.980]  and I have no way to verify the accuracy of any of these,
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.220]  but I'll throw them up there.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.180]  And obviously do your research.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:24.180]  The person saying it may be a PhD in something,
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.260]  but I have no idea.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.540]  So here is like tissue culture isn't magic.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.540]  They get like 10% clean or something like that.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.900]  You have to pay for a shitload of testing.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.060]  You might as well just do the same thing with seed
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.540]  because I guess the idea there is that the seeds,
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.220]  if you have hoplate and viroid,
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.380]  a small percentage of the seeds will also have it,
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:49.060]  but that also implies that you could find ones
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:51.540]  that don't have it and that's kind of your new stock.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:55.730]  Is that accurate?
[01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.010]  Yeah, I think it's accurate.
[01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:04.690]  That freaked me out.
[01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.370]  I mean, there's other things that go around too.
[01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:09.130]  I forget, Bodhi was telling me it's,
[01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:12.250]  we dealt with it in alfalfa.
[01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.970]  It's either fusarium or,
[01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:18.130]  what was the other one?
[01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:20.530]  There's another one that plants get.
[01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:24.810]  Fusarium or, it's a root rot disease.
[01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:26.410]  You guys heard of it?
[01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:31.170]  Fusarium wilt and then,
[01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:33.730]  yeah, I can't remember the name of it,
[01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.610]  but a couple of different root rot diseases
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.090]  and what that's caused from is, I don't know,
[01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:43.170]  but we used to get it from too much water
[01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:45.810]  and it would, if you'd pull the plants,
[01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:48.490]  we'd always pull them and look at them
[01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:51.690]  and then I'd cut the main taproot off
[01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:54.490]  and it'd be really brown in there
[01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:57.290]  and you could tell and then you peel it back
[01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:58.690]  and it's all infected in there
[01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:02.970]  with the whole structure inside the stem
[01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:05.250]  and it's diseased.
[01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.410]  So it's just gonna be, it's a similar effect.
[01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:10.730]  Your plants get weak
[01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:14.170]  and you're not gonna get production.
[01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:16.330]  You're not gonna, they're not gonna perform
[01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:18.530]  like they would be if they're clean.
[01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:20.890]  And I'm not sure where that ever came from,
[01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.890]  but we had it out there a lot.
[01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:26.850]  Yeah, the pythium.
[01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:30.530]  Is that what you're talking about, pythium?
[01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:32.650]  No, but pythium was another one.
[01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:35.250]  It's not the thing I was thinking of.
[01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:39.170]  It's the usarium and verticillium wilt.
[01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.570]  That's the other one, verticillium.
[01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.330]  One of the two, I thought it was,
[01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:48.290]  maybe that's not the one that Bodie told me about
[01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.650]  that is showing up and it's similar.
[01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:54.530]  It stunts the plant and I don't know
[01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.130]  what other things it does,
[01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:59.370]  but things that I don't wanna have to deal with.
[01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:06.370]  I mean, I try to keep things as simple as possible
[01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:09.370]  and I feel safe working with my seeds.
[01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:12.490]  So, every time I germinate seeds,
[01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:16.530]  I put in a couple of drops of peroxide, even in my own,
[01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:19.370]  because some of the seeds I've got,
[01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:21.050]  the plants molded a little bit,
[01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:23.490]  didn't hurt the seeds at all,
[01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.770]  but I just put that in there
[01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:29.010]  just to get rid of any pathogens.
[01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:33.770]  And I recommend it when I talk to people about it.
[01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:38.770]  You don't have to, but it's one precaution that you can use.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.220]  So, just the other comment was from Justin,
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.980]  okay, Medrosy, still new growth is likely
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.420]  to have less of a viral load than old growth.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.260]  And then I think someone was talking about,
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.820]  so you could take, I mean, that's kind of-
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.660]  That's why you wanna-
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.780]  Sound as the new growth, right?
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.780]  That's why you wanna test your,
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:04.860]  you wanna make sure you're not testing
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.380]  the healthiest parts too.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.220]  You wanna test, like, the testing,
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.220]  if I can get a branch that's growing way shittier
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.020]  than the rest of the branches on the plant.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.820]  On the most healthy plant you'll ever get,
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.780]  there's always some that are more on the inside.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.620]  Once the big dominant branches take over,
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.780]  you'll get those ones towards the bottom
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.700]  that are the ones when you clean out your plants,
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:26.700]  you'll cut them off.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.860]  They kind of don't ever do anything.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.900]  When everything else buds,
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.060]  they're way behind in flowering.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.260]  Those little branches, like the stem,
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:36.540]  right where it's next to the main stem,
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.100]  but it's a little tiny stem,
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.420]  that's what I like to test,
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.260]  because I'm like, all right,
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.820]  if it's gonna be anywhere,
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.820]  it's gonna be the shittiest part of the plant,
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.780]  the oldest growth, the longest time
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:49.180]  for the load to be higher, and all that stuff.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.780]  So that's, it's true.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.540]  Whatever's the newest shoot,
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:53.740]  you might be able to get,
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.620]  because you'll see people, like,
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.860]  they'll have a plant and they'll test it,
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.500]  and it's like, part of it'll be dirty
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.100]  and part of it'll be clean.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.460]  And so for me, I'm like, okay,
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.860]  well, if you have a really valuable plant,
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.500]  it's really worth it to go,
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.780]  okay, well, let's take 10 clones off of this plant,
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:14.140]  and then do a test off the base of each of those clones,
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.660]  have those be your tests, label them,
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:20.900]  and then maybe you get like two out of 10 were clean.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.420]  Then you can grow those up
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.820]  and then do a test thing where you test five
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.460]  on each of those clean ones and go,
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:28.820]  okay, are they really clean?
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.180]  Are they staying clean?
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.060]  And you might have a clean part of the plant,
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:36.500]  but you just don't really necessarily know,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.180]  but in that case, it's easier,
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.100]  you have more likelihood that this little piece of a plant
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.700]  was a little clean piece on the plant,
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.220]  and maybe you could clone it or clone around it.
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.380]  I haven't seen it, I haven't done it,
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.740]  and when I went ahead and tried it,
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.380]  like with this plant I'm talking about,
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:56.180]  I tried it and it was like, no, I did,
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.980]  so I tried a few and it was like, okay, mark them,
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.620]  and then I was like, no, they're all dirty.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.860]  So I'm just like, all right, it's a dirty plant,
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.060]  I'm just not even gonna bother
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.060]  with trying to clone around it,
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.460]  because it was like the most healthy part of the big mom.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.100]  I'm like, okay, we'll get these ones here
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:18.180]  and then cut the clone, take the base off of the actual clone
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:21.500]  and then test that, and it was dirty at that stage,
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.140]  so I was like, they're dirty, I'm screwed.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:28.460]  But luckily it wasn't anything else but that one plant,
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.700]  and that one plant was the one that was suspect,
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.620]  like this thing sucks in comparison to what it used to be,
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.860]  and then the other ones that seemed like that,
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.860]  it was like, okay, these ones are dirty too,
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.980]  and the one thing they all had in common
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.300]  was they would all take like three weeks to root
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.780]  when stuff was rooting in a week or 12 days.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.080]  These things are just like, they're slow,
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.700]  they don't quite do, but growing them outside
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.300]  in the full sun, you'd still have killer bags of weed,
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.780]  they'd still have big fat buds,
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.040]  they didn't look like all the dotted out stuff
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.460]  I see pictures of, but it was like,
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.020]  they're just not quite right.
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.740]  These are legendary plants
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.940]  and the weed coming off of them is special,
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.180]  but it's like, I don't know if this would have ever
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.900]  made us fall in love with them if this was this,
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:15.900]  but they're just a little bit messed up.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:17.860]  Yeah.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.140]  Yeah, that's a good point, Jackson, to say that,
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.580]  that the way they're showing is that
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.380]  they just wouldn't have been selected
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.340]  the way we have been selected in the past,
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.780]  the way they're expressing them with the viroids.
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.020]  Yeah, like this is legendary, I don't know,
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.360]  this doesn't seem that legendary,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.100]  and then it's like, oh, it's dirty.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.700]  What would it be like if it was really doing its stuff?
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:41.740]  You know, it's like, you know, it'd be, it's, yeah,
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.260]  it's just how it is.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.580]  Do you have any experience to know if whether or not
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:51.580]  the viroids possibly showing more in a self seed line
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:56.020]  than in a outcross seed line, that's something not related?
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.820]  I don't think it would matter because everything
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.180]  that I've seen about them studying stuff in hops,
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.500]  it seems that the pollen doesn't carry it
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:07.200]  because it doesn't stay, you know how pollen is,
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.200]  pollen is like a seed, it lands, it lands on the stigma,
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:16.100]  and then it's basically a little chemical moisture reaction
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.060]  there where it goes, hey, I'm home,
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.980]  and it sprouts that little tail and it goes down there
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:25.760]  all the way down the stigma into the base, you know,
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:32.020]  it basically gets down there and then it winds up
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.480]  hitting the ovule and it pollinates.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.100]  They say that that process is so fast
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.700]  and then it dies so fast that it doesn't,
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.320]  the viroid doesn't have a chance in that matter of hours
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.160]  to be able to basically go from being in here
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.960]  and all that little new cells,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.800]  they say it doesn't follow it fast enough.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.320]  That's just what, you know, I mean,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.080]  it's not a ton of study, but there is study in hops
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.960]  that says the pollen doesn't transfer it.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.720]  So basically you're still back at the same place
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.520]  where if you have a dirty female and you have clean pollen,
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.400]  so that's the same thing with selfing,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.960]  it's like you still have this dirty female
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.400]  and then maybe it has its dirty pollen,
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.560]  but the pollen it's not coming from the pollen side anyway.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.360]  So my, you know, basic guess on it
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.320]  would be that you're gonna have the same thing happening.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.560]  But what's cool with testing is it's like,
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.680]  it doesn't really matter because say it was 30%,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.700]  it's like, all right, with feminized seed,
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.360]  if you can go ahead and grow these hundred plants out
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.040]  and I'm searching for this thing
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.120]  and now I got 70 females to look through
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.760]  and I'm going, okay, I go ahead and I'm starting with 100,
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.880]  I kill off everything that's not in my target range
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.640]  and maybe I wind up with four or three out of a hundred
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.040]  that are really in my target range for this plant
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.920]  where I go, this is almost a twin, right?
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.560]  It's not gonna be identical, but maybe it's better.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560]  It might be something that's a little bit better.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.060]  So then I wind up with those
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.660]  and then the likelihood of having those,
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.380]  having them all be from that little 30% chance
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.780]  and that's just saying if it was three times worse
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:16.980]  and that would be probably ridiculous,
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:19.500]  it'd be more likely that it would be twice as bad
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.380]  at the very worst and I think it's probably the same.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.980]  So now you're looking at having all these plants
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:28.000]  to choose from, you know, it would suck
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.980]  if you only find one out of a hundred and it's perfect
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.780]  and then you test it and it's dirty
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.600]  because you're back to square one.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.840]  But I don't think that would be the likelihood
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.400]  that would be like, you know, that's like winning a raffle
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  in a real bad way.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.320]  Like it's just not, your odds aren't that high,
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.160]  I don't think.
[01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:54.180]  Yeah, it's, stay here.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.860]  Would you all agree with this?
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:59.900]  Hold on, let me, for all of us with fading eyes.
[01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:06.430]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:07.590]  It's a wild ride.
[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:08.430]  Used to be.
[01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:14.390]  Up here it's really hard.
[01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:16.430]  The weather's so bad, you know.
[01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:21.350]  Well, you guys deal with similar weather, right?
[01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.870]  Once you get down South, it's more, it's more mild.
[01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:31.430]  But like I think haze probably wouldn't have gotten
[01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:35.510]  quite as popular up here as it did in the Santa Cruz area
[01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:38.870]  because it's, you know, it's coastal.
[01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:41.030]  It's a little more mild, the temperatures there
[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:42.190]  are a little bit more mild.
[01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:44.030]  Even right on the coast here,
[01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.990]  the temperatures are a lot more mild.
[01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:48.870]  It's just, it's a lot of moisture.
[01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:52.190]  Where are you?
[01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:53.830]  I'm up in Mendocino.
[01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:54.670]  Oh, okay.
[01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.990]  Yeah, we, Bodie's got more fog than I do here,
[01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:02.710]  but I mean, it's sometimes we get the morning fog here
[01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:06.670]  and then when the flowers are maturing
[01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:11.990]  and it's so wet sometimes it's difficult.
[01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:17.190]  That's why I've had so many years when that happened
[01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:21.630]  and you start getting disease problems.
[01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:25.110]  And I've got an overhang in the back that I built.
[01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:29.670]  It's just a raked greenhouse,
[01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:36.550]  that plastic, corrugated plastic,
[01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:38.710]  greenhouse plastic that you get.
[01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:40.830]  I just have it on the roof and all those sides
[01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:43.110]  besides the fence in the back,
[01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:44.470]  the other sides are all open.
[01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:47.870]  And just for some of the strains I'm working with
[01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:49.190]  that they're gonna go longer,
[01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:52.430]  I'll put one outside of that
[01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:54.830]  and then I put one underneath just in case.
[01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:58.630]  But then there's sometimes where when the moisture
[01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:01.590]  is real thick and everything, both of them get disease.
[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:05.230]  So it's just kind of, it's one other thing that I tried
[01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:06.590]  that's helped some of my plants.
[01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:09.150]  So I grow them underneath sometimes.
[01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:19.490]  I'm able to go here until on a good year,
[01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:24.690]  like mid November, I can pull that off.
[01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:30.250]  I've had things like Swazi and Congolese up here.
[01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:32.810]  I don't grow a lot of that kind of stuff
[01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:34.290]  just cause I always figure it'll fail.
[01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:36.090]  And I tried those and they did okay.
[01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:40.530]  The Swazi wound up wanting to start getting some rot
[01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.970]  around finishing time, which was,
[01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:46.770]  I remember it being, I think mid December, maybe,
[01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:49.330]  maybe late December, but I think mid December.
[01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:51.650]  The Congo didn't go quite as far.
[01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:56.410]  The Malawi that I tried was like early November,
[01:30:56.410 --> 01:30:58.050]  which would be perfect for me here.
[01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:00.330]  Like I can get away with that.
[01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:02.290]  But-
[01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.090]  Yeah, I'm looking for, I'm gonna try some Malawi again.
[01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:08.970]  I had some before, I haven't grown it that much
[01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:12.610]  and it just seemed washed out to me.
[01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:15.010]  I don't know if it's even pure or not,
[01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:18.370]  but the old Malawi cobs,
[01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:21.330]  my friend brought back in the seventies,
[01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:23.370]  man, that weed was strong.
[01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:29.130]  And yeah, I don't know, nowadays Afro Pips,
[01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:34.130]  I think had that, that's where my original Swazi came from,
[01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:37.570]  from Roms in Europe, Afro Pips.
[01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:41.650]  They used to have good land raise years ago.
[01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:42.770]  I don't know if they do anymore,
[01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.810]  but they haven't really looked.
[01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:49.090]  Yeah, I heard good things about them for a long time.
[01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:54.290]  I have a greenhouse now that's like a long hoop
[01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:57.530]  and it's covered and I can open it at both ends
[01:31:57.530 --> 01:32:01.090]  and I can put up the bottoms of the walls.
[01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:03.090]  So this year I'm gonna try to do
[01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.930]  some of the longer running stuff
[01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:10.490]  and see like I generally for breeding stuff here,
[01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:12.570]  I'm like, well, if I can't grow it outside
[01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.210]  and have it get nice,
[01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:15.930]  then I don't wanna do it that much
[01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:19.410]  because it winds up being such a small cross section
[01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:22.010]  of people who wanna grow something like that
[01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:24.690]  and have space to put it in a greenhouse
[01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:26.690]  and keep the climate right and all that.
[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:31.730]  But I figure like if it'll do good
[01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:34.890]  with just the rain being kept off of it here,
[01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:38.890]  then that's not so big of a deal.
[01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:41.290]  So I'm gonna try a little bit of stuff.
[01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:44.330]  I got a really cool Brazilian a guy sent me
[01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:48.530]  and some other cool stuff, cool congos.
[01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:51.290]  And so I'm gonna try more of it.
[01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:55.250]  You can never grow it and get a lot of weed.
[01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.090]  And so there's not very many people
[01:32:57.090 --> 01:32:59.050]  who wanna grow something just for the sake
[01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:01.450]  of having something cool,
[01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:04.250]  but with the internet, like there's people all over
[01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:06.450]  and then you get this little cross section of people
[01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:08.050]  who are like, I wanna grow something weird.
[01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:10.810]  So now I wanna breed way weirder stuff.
[01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:12.530]  Yeah.
[01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:17.130]  Well, you find, I've often thought
[01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:18.810]  that a lot of the old land racer,
[01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:23.810]  they're gonna find a lot of medicinal things in there
[01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:28.690]  because there's gonna be a lot of cures
[01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:31.050]  they find down the line, maybe not in my lifetime,
[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:34.930]  but I think they already are finding some things
[01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:39.570]  because anyway, it's just, you never know.
[01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:42.410]  I mean, we didn't think about that stuff years ago.
[01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:44.730]  And now when you test, I mean,
[01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:49.530]  there's all these other different things
[01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:55.690]  that we don't even know about on some of these plants
[01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:57.930]  and they've never been tested.
[01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:01.730]  And you don't know what you're gonna come up with.
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:03.170]  It's like that one I told you I grew,
[01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:05.930]  I should have had it tested
[01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:08.410]  because even though the strength wasn't there,
[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:12.330]  the taste was good and there was some terpenes in there,
[01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:17.090]  but I just, I kind of lost my interest in it actually.
[01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:22.090]  But I grew, like I said, Swazi
[01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:30.570]  and I grew some, what was it?
[01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:35.730]  Another one I grew was another South African
[01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:38.850]  that was really good.
[01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:42.850]  And there's quite a few Africans I'd like to try
[01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:44.770]  that I haven't yet.
[01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:49.730]  And I did get recently got some seeds from Africa
[01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:51.450]  that I'm gonna try at some point.
[01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:55.690]  But Snow High and I had been wanting to do these ties
[01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.650]  for a while, so we finally got it together this year.
[01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:01.170]  He's got some golden ties with,
[01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.210]  so I haven't grown that yet.
[01:35:04.210 --> 01:35:05.570]  I'm gonna get some of that.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.200]  You guys grown any old heirloom Hawaiians?
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:20.100]  I haven't myself, but I have a partner
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.620]  that has worked with some old Hawaiian stuff,
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.620]  some 78 Hawaiian genetics that he messes with
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.460]  that he sent me.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:30.620]  I just haven't gotten around to growing them yet.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.460]  Nice.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.940]  Well, if they're like the old stuff
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:38.940]  from the 60s and the 70s, Maui, Waui,
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:43.940]  the Kona Gold and stuff, those are basically,
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.540]  they were brought over there.
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.740]  They were land-raised basically from some of the guys
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.100]  who were smuggling weed over there.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:56.100]  And Mexican ties, Colombians, different things.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:59.900]  And it's a few that I grew this one over
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.580]  that I grew this last year that I got.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:04.100]  It's called Blue Hana, but I can't,
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.940]  it reminded me of blueberry in a way,
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.860]  and it could have it in there, but I can't,
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.460]  it's not that common and I haven't been able
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.820]  to find out much about it yet.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.500]  I'm gonna still look into it more.
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.100]  Puna butter, I've grown one of my lines,
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.900]  the hibiscus, and I've got a few of those
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:25.620]  Puna butter, I've grown one of my lines,
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.380]  the hibiscus has got Puna butter in it.
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:28.860]  That's a real nice strain.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:32.300]  Little nice, hard little nugs.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.860]  That actually does pretty good here.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.780]  I grew that, I had the hibiscus growing up in Seattle.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:43.780]  Friend of mine used to manage Kiona up there,
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.220]  friend of mine, and he liked it
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.380]  and he thought it did really well.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.980]  He's a real knowledgeable guy.
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.220]  Done a lot of land race work.
[01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:03.690]  Yeah, just going down the line, this is the hibiscus.
[01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:09.850]  Someone, Cascadian just asked, do you see that?
[01:37:11.610 --> 01:37:12.450]  Yeah.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.520]  I actually don't know for sure,
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.640]  but I've heard things about that, I'm not sure.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.400]  That's, I just don't know on that.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.360]  I don't wanna say one way or the other.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.080]  I was gonna ask you, out of all the new stuff
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.360]  that you dropped, which one of those is your most favorite
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.680]  or proud of that you've been working on?
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.640]  So there's a lot of beautiful genetics in your stuff
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.760]  and people could probably go a lot of different directions
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.040]  with what you put out there, but what do you,
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.520]  if you had to pick one of your own that's out there,
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.920]  what would you wanna choose?
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.840]  Well, the year before last, the Columbian crosses,
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.840]  the Warbird, I liked the Romulan cross,
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:14.840]  the headband, redhead, that cross, I like a lot.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.200]  Actually one that I really liked
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.280]  and I really liked the taste was the San Fernando Valley,
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.280]  OG cross with Columbian and it kept the OG
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:32.480]  and it looked more sativa looking, but dense,
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.320]  not little small nugs, but it was not airy
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.160]  like you would think and it kept the OG fuely smell.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.360]  I'm anxious to go that out again this year.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.040]  I like that one a lot.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.360]  I'm just gonna go down the line.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.120]  So you just talked about the Hibiscus, the SFV Columbian,
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.520]  how about Antifaruk Columbian?
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.040]  Antifaruk, that's a Pakistani that I got online
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.000]  from a breeder over there.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.240]  It's a really beautiful aromatic Pakistani purple,
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.040]  dense buds, hashy.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.600]  And I thought it complimented the Columbian
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.000]  and that complimented each other, I liked that a lot.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.960]  I don't have any results on testing on that.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.360]  That was one of the ones that I didn't test.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.920]  It was later on, they finished a little bit later.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.560]  But it's got a lot of, I wanna work with that again.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.760]  Dirk Quora, yeah, that's it.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.800]  Dirk Quora, podcast, hey buddy.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.060]  And then you talked about Warbird, how about Northern Pride?
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:56.060]  Northern Pride I've read, I think in 2013 or 14.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:01.900]  It's Northern Lights, one, Pride of Afghanistan,
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:08.100]  an old line pure Afghani and Burmese.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.100]  It's a squatty plant, beautiful branching, strong stems,
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:19.100]  stony, got more of a, like, I don't know how to explain it.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.580]  It's not like a fruity, it's more earthy, good expansion,
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:40.780]  good stone, it's not my favorite, but I mean, it's nice.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:45.340]  I read it and then grew it one year after that and liked it.
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:48.140]  And then I haven't worked with it since.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:51.100]  I'd like to maybe go in there
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:56.100]  and look for some different expressions at some point.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:00.380]  You know, after a while, I gotta have my priorities
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.260]  and I've been waiting on working with the Thais
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:03.860]  for quite a few years.
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:08.860]  So that's why I finally got to them this last year.
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.820]  And then the motor?
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:20.800]  Yeah, that's had the most beautiful flowers, real dense.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.480]  They turned out really nice.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.920]  The potency was up there, I don't remember.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.920]  I think it was 24, 25 or something like that.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.160]  But it didn't really, I only had a couple of plants
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.320]  that I grew out.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.080]  That's another one I need to do again.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.760]  That's another one I need to do again.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.760]  It didn't have the pungent smell like I was expecting.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.840]  I've never grown motor breath before, but very, very nice.
[01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:01.210]  But like I said, I mean, it needs more work.
[01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:07.210]  And I just, I know there's some good turps in there.
[01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:09.490]  And if you looked, I know you'd get
[01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.810]  some good fragrance off of it.
[01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:17.250]  Those are just, I had picked out some
[01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:22.250]  and Radio Ridge brought me some to work with,
[01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:23.650]  different than what I had asked for.
[01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:25.690]  There was a few different ones.
[01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:30.690]  And one in particular that I bred, but I didn't,
[01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:32.330]  that's another one.
[01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:34.130]  All these, a lot of these I gotta grow out.
[01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:35.890]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:39.970]  Is some different things
[01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:44.330]  that I wasn't really familiar with was,
[01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:48.570]  what was that other one that he brought over there?
[01:42:48.570 --> 01:42:53.570]  There was, and I'm losing my train of thought here.
[01:42:58.050 --> 01:42:59.850]  What the hell is the name of that thing?
[01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:03.970]  Anyway, I lost my train of thought.
[01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:06.490]  Better have another sip of beer.
[01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:11.010]  Me too, cheers.
[01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:11.850]  Cheers.
[01:43:14.130 --> 01:43:17.370]  And the Smuggler's Choice you were talking about before,
[01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.730]  right, the Smuggler's Choice Burmese?
[01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:20.690]  Yeah, that was-
[01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:23.290]  Was that from Classic or from Snow High?
[01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:24.650]  That's from Classic.
[01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:28.450]  And Snow High got it too.
[01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.250]  Can you just quickly take a step back?
[01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:34.570]  I mean, you mentioned that he passed away.
[01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:39.410]  Can you just talk about him as a person and a breeder?
[01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:45.130]  Yeah, he's an old vet like myself.
[01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:48.170]  And we had similar backgrounds.
[01:43:48.170 --> 01:43:53.170]  I won't get into any of it right now, but I met him on,
[01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:00.810]  Icy Mag.
[01:44:00.810 --> 01:44:03.810]  I used to be on there a lot years ago
[01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:06.050]  and I met him on there and found out
[01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:07.290]  that he lived near Portland.
[01:44:07.290 --> 01:44:08.690]  That's where my son lives.
[01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:15.050]  So I was going up to visit my son
[01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:19.250]  and arranged to meet Terry up there.
[01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:24.250]  And we met and talked and we had similar likes
[01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:30.690]  on land race and military background.
[01:44:31.570 --> 01:44:34.250]  And we shot the bull about that a little bit, not so much.
[01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:39.250]  But, and we started doing some things.
[01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:41.610]  He had the Romulan and he gave it to me
[01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:43.970]  and I did a seed increase for him
[01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:45.890]  and send him half of the seeds.
[01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:48.330]  Northern Lights, number one, I got from him.
[01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:51.970]  It's another nice one.
[01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:55.850]  And what else?
[01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:58.690]  Pure ones.
[01:44:58.690 --> 01:45:03.170]  And he did, I gave him my right of Afghanistan
[01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:07.370]  to breed with, that old Afghani.
[01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:11.650]  And yeah, we just, we shared genetics
[01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:16.650]  and shared thoughts on breeding
[01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:18.530]  and different things like that.
[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:23.530]  He was working with a lot of OGs and not so much chems,
[01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:25.930]  I think Sauer.
[01:45:27.370 --> 01:45:28.530]  And I never grew that.
[01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:32.210]  I smoked it before, it's good.
[01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:34.570]  But he worked with some of that.
[01:45:34.570 --> 01:45:38.490]  And he was doing a lot of land race crosses also.
[01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:40.530]  So we just kind of hit it off.
[01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:44.370]  He just passed away last year.
[01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:46.890]  Yes.
[01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:51.890]  But anyway, good friend, very, very good guy.
[01:45:52.090 --> 01:46:03.710]  I can't tell if that's my internet connection or...
[01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:04.870]  Can you hear me?
[01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:05.710]  Yeah.
[01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:08.870]  Okay, you're back.
[01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:09.710]  I don't know.
[01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:14.150]  But all right, go ahead.
[01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:17.350]  Well, that's it about Classic.
[01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:18.190]  I don't know.
[01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:21.790]  We just shared a lot of genetics
[01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:23.190]  and then thoughts on breeding.
[01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:27.070]  And he's one of the ones that got me convinced
[01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:33.070]  to start putting out some of my work in Modi.
[01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:43.830]  And also Snow High and he were good friends also.
[01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:47.750]  And they exchanged seeds also.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.640]  I met a lot of questions.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.800]  Yeah, a lot of chat questions.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:05.570]  I just want to quickly get through some of this stuff.
[01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:07.610]  Think about some of the building blocks.
[01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:10.610]  So you talked about the Swazi Burmese
[01:47:12.650 --> 01:47:14.210]  and then the Big Sur Holy Weeds.
[01:47:14.210 --> 01:47:16.010]  Someone asked a question about kind of
[01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:18.290]  what was some of the first weed you experienced
[01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:20.770]  when you were in the Summer Cruise area?
[01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:27.610]  Colombian, Thai, Vietnamese, Afghani.
[01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:33.610]  A lot of Mexican, good Mexican in those days.
[01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:36.170]  Of course, the Thai sticks.
[01:47:36.170 --> 01:47:39.610]  And then at the tail end of the Thai stick run there,
[01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:44.210]  we got this load of Thai called Untied.
[01:47:44.210 --> 01:47:47.850]  It was just loose, light pressed.
[01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:52.850]  And they weren't on sticks, strong, the best.
[01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:55.210]  The story was, and I don't know, you know how stories go.
[01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:56.290]  I don't know if it's true or not.
[01:47:56.290 --> 01:48:01.290]  But the smugglers did so much business with these guys,
[01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:03.890]  they made millions.
[01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:09.810]  And the people they were getting these from
[01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:15.010]  presented them with this Untied.
[01:48:15.010 --> 01:48:17.690]  Well, I don't know if they bought it, I'm sure,
[01:48:17.690 --> 01:48:20.330]  but it was top of the line.
[01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:22.810]  I don't know if it was part of the stuff
[01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:25.850]  they were doing sticks with or not, but it was loose.
[01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:30.570]  It was more of a light, kind of a golden brown color,
[01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:31.850]  very sticky.
[01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:34.210]  You could go like this, the bunch stick,
[01:48:34.210 --> 01:48:36.610]  they were pressed a little bit.
[01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:38.170]  It was like a hand press,
[01:48:38.170 --> 01:48:40.010]  like some of the old Mexican blocks
[01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:41.730]  they used to get hand pressed ones.
[01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:47.370]  And that was extremely good.
[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:57.410]  Yeah, so, you know, those are,
[01:48:57.410 --> 01:49:01.570]  I was fortunate to experience the 60s and the 70s,
[01:49:02.490 --> 01:49:05.850]  you know, and a lot of the younger people,
[01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:06.850]  they read about stuff.
[01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:09.690]  There's a couple of good books on tie sticks out there
[01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:11.690]  they should look into.
[01:49:11.690 --> 01:49:13.010]  I got a couple.
[01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:19.130]  One of them's about the small smugglers, the Brotherhood.
[01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:21.490]  You guys are probably familiar with those guys.
[01:49:21.850 --> 01:49:24.850]  I grew some Oaxacan from Brotherhood Oaxacan
[01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:27.850]  that I got year before last.
[01:49:27.850 --> 01:49:32.850]  And I crossed that this year, this last year, I should say.
[01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:34.330]  They were just in small pots.
[01:49:34.330 --> 01:49:36.490]  So I didn't have any room.
[01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:41.090]  I grew three different females and I just kept them in,
[01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:44.170]  they were just three gallon, just flowered them out.
[01:49:44.170 --> 01:49:46.290]  Just I wanted to see what they were like.
[01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:49.450]  And they're similar to the Oaxacan that I have,
[01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:52.530]  so, you know, I was happy with them.
[01:49:52.530 --> 01:49:56.530]  So it's another one on the list that needs to be grown out.
[01:49:56.530 --> 01:49:57.370]  So.
[01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:00.530]  Well, that gets to, so one of the questions in the chat
[01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:02.730]  was about, and this is something we were talking about
[01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:03.970]  right before we went live,
[01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:07.210]  but what were some of the memorable Mexican varieties like?
[01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:09.410]  I see you're just talking Oaxacan,
[01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:12.250]  but yet, so you have a little Oaxacan.
[01:50:12.250 --> 01:50:13.090]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:13.930]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:14.770]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:15.610]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:16.450]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:17.290]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:18.130]  Oaxacan, yeah.
[01:50:19.130 --> 01:50:22.810]  Oaxacan, nairite, zacatecas,
[01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:26.810]  ziwatnejo,
[01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:32.370]  acapulco, loaded with seeds in the days even.
[01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:38.330]  Stuff would get you wired up, uncomfortable sometimes.
[01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:42.090]  I got a cut from a snow high and grew it.
[01:50:42.090 --> 01:50:45.450]  It was, I smoked too much.
[01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:47.290]  I don't smoke, you know,
[01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:48.930]  I don't even do a whole joint anymore.
[01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:50.770]  I'll do a couple, two or three puffs
[01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:53.730]  or else I do my bubbler pipe.
[01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:57.170]  It got me so wired, I was uncomfortable.
[01:50:57.170 --> 01:51:00.490]  I got a heart rate on it, which I don't like.
[01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:02.370]  That's not comfortable.
[01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:04.570]  So that's got a little drawback.
[01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:06.490]  I don't remember that happening in the old days.
[01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:07.930]  I don't know what kind of,
[01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:10.090]  there was a lot of different ones,
[01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:13.010]  like any strain, different areas.
[01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:15.010]  Michoacan, that was another good one.
[01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:19.890]  I never really had any Yucatan weed.
[01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:23.130]  I went down there in 72,
[01:51:23.130 --> 01:51:25.090]  went all the way down all through Mexico
[01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:27.730]  to Chatumal down in the Yucatan
[01:51:28.690 --> 01:51:31.730]  and just had kind of crappy weed.
[01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:34.210]  We couldn't get any good weed down there.
[01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:37.770]  I don't know, I didn't know the right people.
[01:51:37.770 --> 01:51:42.130]  And, but anyway, see what else was down there.
[01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:44.930]  See what, nairite, that's another good,
[01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:48.650]  right around Acapulco, that was another good one, Guerrero.
[01:51:49.890 --> 01:51:51.090]  And there's probably some more in there
[01:51:51.090 --> 01:52:01.820]  that I can't remember, but those were the memorable ones.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:05.300]  So actually, can you talk about the Panama Red?
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:11.220]  Yeah, the Panama Red is a beautiful strain.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:18.980]  Finished this fairly early, November,
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:20.300]  and some can go longer.
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.900]  I had some that were longer.
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:27.900]  And CBD dominant on some of them.
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.060]  Let's see what else.
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:39.300]  Those were from Snow High originally.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.260]  And they were from an aid group that was,
[01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.780]  forget the name of those people that go over there.
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:51.860]  Spreading the word.
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.620]  And they brought them back in the 70s.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:01.340]  And I didn't have that much Panama Red here.
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.300]  I had a little bit in the old days,
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:06.540]  but I don't really remember it all that much.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.140]  I think I might only had it like once.
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.260]  There was more Thai and Colombian and Mexican
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.340]  coming through here then in those days.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:19.340]  Then you'd get some of these pressed bricks of Mexican.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.540]  It was horrible shit.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.180]  And then some of them we grew out.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:28.620]  It was really good weed.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:30.820]  It was just not taken care of.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:35.820]  It was just crappy, pressed, moldy stuff.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.540]  But it's kind of funny.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.980]  You wouldn't think about growing it.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.940]  I tried it one time,
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.980]  and it was really actually pretty decent.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:49.700]  Oh, there's one other one there from Southern Mexico.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.660]  That was another good line down there
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:59.660]  just above the Yucatan.
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:05.620]  And that was a kind of a jungly one.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.220]  Mainly the ones, the Nairita and the Zacatecas
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:11.660]  and the Zihuatanejo and Oaxacan.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:14.540]  Those are probably the most memorable
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.740]  to answer the question.
[01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:22.690]  Sorry, my wife was asking me
[01:54:22.690 --> 01:54:25.290]  to cut the sausage for dinner.
[01:54:25.290 --> 01:54:30.290]  But what, all right, so I'm 46.
[01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:33.690]  The oldest seeds you have in your possession,
[01:54:33.690 --> 01:54:35.890]  are they older than me or younger than me?
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:44.620]  Older.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:47.260]  And where are they from?
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:48.980]  Where'd you get them?
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.420]  Some Malawi, where'd I get them?
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.300]  Some are from John Snow.
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:59.500]  Malawi, some other Panama Red.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:09.860]  I probably, I've got some Indian seeds in there.
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.620]  I've got a box that I don't get in much anymore.
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:18.820]  Some of those are old that I haven't grown in a long while.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:20.820]  And some of them I haven't grown at all.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.420]  Some obscure things.
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:30.980]  Those are something that Snow and I have talked about.
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.500]  And also Bodhi also about doing
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:41.460]  embryo seed rescue from someone that's competent
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.220]  in a tissue culture lab to do that.
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.460]  And they just, I've tried germinating them.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.420]  They'll start to open up and then they stall.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:53.740]  They just don't have enough energy to,
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:58.260]  the taproot will come down and then they just dampen off.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.860]  And so that's the only way to do it.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.860]  And I'm not real knowledgeable in tissue culture,
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:11.860]  but they have to make a different kind of an auger.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.540]  I wouldn't think it would be just a regular auger
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.420]  to use for just any cannabis.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:21.460]  I might be wrong on that, I'm not sure.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:24.620]  But I would think they'd have to add certain things
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:29.620]  from an old, that your old seeds have just been depleted of.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.660]  And they're not dried out.
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.700]  You can crack them open and they're still fresh in there,
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:36.420]  but they're still white.
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:41.820]  I shouldn't say fresh, but so that's what I'd have to do
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.660]  with those.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:45.780]  We haven't really found anybody to try that with yet.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:47.740]  I haven't really been looking in the last couple of years,
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:56.260]  but you guys had any luck with doing that
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.700]  or have you done anything like that?
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:02.020]  Had seeds germinated through a tissue culture?
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.700]  I finally had a guy contact me.
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:10.140]  He tracked me down at one of the cups
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:14.780]  and he was like, oh yeah, we do all that
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:16.380]  and we can do it, no problem.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:19.140]  And I haven't ever got him anything.
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:21.100]  I had a little bit of stuff.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:25.100]  I got to Hawaii to an orchid lab to try it
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:28.780]  and it didn't quite work out.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:36.920]  You can see Mr. Toad is doing something with it over here.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.060]  But yeah, but I found somebody who said,
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:40.940]  oh, we could do it.
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:42.820]  It's always a strange thing
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.980]  because if I don't know people well,
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.700]  part of it's paranoia and part of it is practical too.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:55.300]  I think that I just generally don't trust people that much
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.540]  to give them any of that stuff.
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:00.160]  I do have some older stuff though
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:03.380]  that I can kind of sacrifice and I've done that
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:07.340]  and I haven't had anybody quite pull it off.
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:09.860]  The embryo rescue is really cool
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.420]  and has a lot of potential.
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.900]  But what I find with the old seeds
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.540]  is that the marrow stem is actually dead.
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.480]  So even if you can get it to grow a little plant,
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.860]  you're likely to just have two little seed leaves
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.380]  and it'll just sit there and have nowhere to go,
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.940]  which after leaving some things that come up like that,
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:31.740]  sometimes from older seeds that are more damaged,
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:35.620]  I kind of documented a little bit real roughly
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:38.260]  on my Instagram, I had seeds come up
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.400]  and all they had was the little seed leaves.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:44.260]  And eventually they'll sometimes actually get a branch
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:47.400]  from below the seed leaf, which isn't supposed to happen,
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.660]  but eventually they will, if they sit there long enough,
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:52.420]  they'll concentrate hormones enough to make shoots
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:55.620]  where there should logically be no shoot.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:57.580]  And I've been able to get things to come back
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:58.940]  and I'll have to leave them sitting there
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:00.300]  for months and months.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.780]  Full term plant started in March
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:08.420]  will wind up being like a foot tall in October,
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:12.260]  but I'm able to get clones or re-veg them or whatever
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.540]  or seed them.
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:15.940]  And I did that and had luck with that last year
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:19.420]  from some stuff that wasn't really viable,
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:22.580]  but it was just that viable.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:25.620]  But what I really have been trying to find,
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:27.700]  and there's people doing it now, I see them doing it,
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:32.700]  is originally I had this relative seed plant
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:36.220]  that was, her name was Mary.
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:40.180]  And when I was probably 10 years old or something,
[01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:43.420]  maybe 12, she said,
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.020]  oh, you know, we were talking about clones.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.580]  And she goes, oh, you guys don't clone,
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:48.700]  you guys take cuttings.
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.540]  She goes, we make clones.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.260]  And I was like, well, what's the difference?
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:54.700]  And she goes, well, we actually grow orchids
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:56.940]  and we can take any piece,
[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:01.260]  the orchids take five to seven years to get a blossom.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.140]  And once they finally get a blossom
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.700]  and we find out that we have a really viable
[02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.460]  commercial nursery plant,
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.260]  we wanna be able to multiply it up right away.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.740]  And that one plant, you can't take cuttings from an orchid
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:16.020]  because of the nature of how the baby plants
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.660]  grow from the root.
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:22.660]  And so she said, what we do is we actually cut open a leaf
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.940]  or a part of the plant,
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.860]  and we take some of those cells out
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:31.860]  and we put them in a Petri dish and we grow callus.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:37.420]  And then we give that hormones and it makes it get roots
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.660]  and it makes it get shoots.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:42.500]  And we'll get a whole little, just tons of little plants
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.140]  and we'll slice them up
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:46.920]  and we'll put them all in their own little test tube.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.460]  And then we'll have a whole bunch
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:50.460]  or we'll grow the callus like you do with mushrooms.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.300]  You know, you divide it first
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:54.140]  before you ever hit it with any hormones
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:56.180]  and make a whole bunch of plates.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.500]  And so you can make millions of plants all at once.
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:00:59.980]  And that's how the orchid industry runs.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:01.700]  And I was like, wow, that's crazy.
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:04.580]  And so it was years and years before I ever saw
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:07.180]  that as being something that was like anything
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:10.540]  that I would ever, it didn't ever make sense for weed to me
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.620]  until I realized that the same thing happened
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.420]  you're describing where the seed can sprout.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:17.220]  So, you know, it's alive and the cells are viable
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:19.140]  but there's just not enough juice there.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:23.780]  So I've been trying to watch everybody doing tissue culture
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.620]  and I've been waiting for them to start
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.820]  to do what they do in the orchid industry
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:31.500]  and in places where they don't,
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.180]  you can't take cuttings from Maristem
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.700]  and people are starting to do it now.
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:40.460]  So I think that's a lot more promising
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:44.780]  than just embryo rescue, just because you don't have
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:47.580]  to have those little plants that might only get seed leaves
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:49.760]  and sit there and eventually Peter out
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.560]  because they don't have a healthy Maristem to grow from.
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.240]  It might be really practical.
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.780]  I mean, they just need some viable cells and they're there.
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:01:59.580]  And especially with the seed,
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:02.980]  you can sterilize the outside of the seed really thoroughly,
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:06.620]  cut it open, grab those cells, a little smear of those cells
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:08.420]  and we're off to the race, you know?
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:11.460]  That's what I've been waiting for.
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:12.820]  And it's progressed.
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:16.740]  I think it was hard for people to get the right kind
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:20.500]  of carbohydrate and hormone mix in the auger initially
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.660]  to make the right gels for cannabis.
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:25.480]  And then people figured that out.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.400]  And now I see people on Instagram starting
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.840]  to do the callus culture.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.640]  And that is what we need for these old seeds
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.200]  to be really practical, you know?
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.080]  So I think in the next few years, you know,
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.840]  me and you will probably have old stuff.
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.400]  We're bringing back from old seeds and, you know,
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.060]  it'll be, but it's gonna be crazy.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.440]  Cause you know, you find you take one seed
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.360]  and it goes into a test tube and then, you know,
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:57.320]  we're used to planting these flats of seeds.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:01.600]  So it's gonna be a lot of energy to get back a little bit
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:03.520]  of plants, you know?
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:04.360]  But-
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:05.280]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.720]  Yeah, but it'll be cool.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.860]  I know it'll happen.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.040]  What you got there, some test tubes going with some auger?
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.960]  Well, what I have here, I've been trying
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:17.320]  to do some seed rescuing,
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.560]  like you guys are talking about myself.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.600]  I have a bunch of seeds that go all the way back
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.040]  to the sixties.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.680]  But the ones I'm working on here are from specifically
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:30.120]  from 1996, I used to own a hotel in Humboldt County.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.360]  Our maid there used to also be a lady that was kind
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.520]  of the chick that fucking people would get
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.560]  their genetics from.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:40.320]  She was doing clones and seed.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:45.080]  So when you, I got a jar that's probably got 10,000 seeds
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:45.920]  in it.
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:48.320]  So I've been trying to put them in these sterile seed sets.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:53.120]  These are sterile coconut that are inoculated
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.440]  with a specific nutrients that from tests
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.760]  and peer reviewed studies shows that it works better
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:03.760]  on the lines that they put it on the cannabis strains.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:05.160]  It's called TZN.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:07.760]  This is from a company called Microclone.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:11.960]  They sell some stuff that is cannabis specific.
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.120]  So I'm trying to rescue some old seeds
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.180]  because the same thing happens to me.
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:18.080]  They'll grow and they don't sprout.
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:19.680]  And they don't have enough nutrients
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.880]  because they don't have enough enzymes and sugars inside
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.120]  of the seed still stored for them
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:25.960]  to initiate protein synthesis.
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.760]  So the seed just stalls out
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.000]  and it doesn't begin to multiply.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.400]  So what you're supposed to do is either soak them long
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.520]  enough to go straight into the coconut
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.560]  and hopefully they pop.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.320]  And that's what I'm doing at the moment,
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.760]  or you take them and soak them until that shell splits
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.560]  like you say, and pull the embryo out and stick it
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.880]  in the agar, which is a sterile agar
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.120]  that has the TZN in it, plus a hormone mixture.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.100]  Also that's been specifically studied on cannabis.
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:56.860]  Not to say it's the only thing that'll work.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:58.460]  They'll probably find something even better.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.380]  But at the point, this is what they studied
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.240]  and found to work at a higher efficiency rate
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.240]  than just basically using guessing, you know?
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.400]  So they, I guess they worked up some stuff
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:14.800]  from other plants and you're supposed to take that embryo,
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:17.560]  pull it out of the seed and stick it inside of here
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:20.680]  and wait up to six weeks for it to start to multiply.
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:23.680]  And once it starts to multiply, you can take it from here
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:27.320]  and go either into the coconut or into a clone plug.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.720]  And hopefully your plant will begin to grow
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:31.600]  once it's large enough.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:32.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:33.800]  So that's what I'm doing right now.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:42.320]  I made a flow hood out of a desktop air purifier
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:46.440]  and some, what is it?
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.560]  Dry cleaner bags and use a little bit of alcohol
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.640]  to clean inside the bag.
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:54.800]  I found something online that's from doing mushrooms
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:55.880]  and stuff.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:00.880]  This cat does stuff with doing inoculating mushrooms
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.400]  to do some reproductions.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:06.280]  So I just tried to replicate the system he had.
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:09.320]  So far, I've only had two complete failures.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.620]  The rest of them are, they're trying.
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:13.180]  We'll see if they work.
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:15.060]  No man, keep me posted on that.
[02:06:18.190 --> 02:06:19.030]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:20.070]  I'm not the only one either.
[02:06:20.070 --> 02:06:22.110]  Dutch Blooms is also gonna be doing some work
[02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:24.910]  with the same system that I was using here.
[02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:27.550]  There's a couple other people I've seen use this.
[02:06:27.550 --> 02:06:30.910]  They claim that possibly up to 40% rescue rate
[02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:31.750]  on some seeds.
[02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:32.570]  We'll see.
[02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:33.670]  If I just get one seed, I'm glad.
[02:06:33.670 --> 02:06:35.070]  If I can get one male or female
[02:06:35.070 --> 02:06:36.510]  out of some of the seed stock I got,
[02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:39.190]  that go back from the nineties, anything,
[02:06:39.190 --> 02:06:42.430]  I can use that to introduce into some of these new lines.
[02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:44.710]  If I recognize the line,
[02:06:44.710 --> 02:06:46.670]  say it's an Afghani that I used to work with
[02:06:46.670 --> 02:06:49.270]  or a Colombian or a Thai or an African,
[02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:51.030]  now I can steer that in a direction
[02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:54.050]  with some other type of genetics that was related to it.
[02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:55.870]  So I can continue that line farther
[02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:58.150]  or do an outcross with something completely different.
[02:06:58.150 --> 02:07:02.470]  So I can find those plants that are similar to it visually
[02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:04.150]  and start to work lines out of that way
[02:07:04.150 --> 02:07:07.550]  to see which ones are the better parent lines to work with.
[02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:11.590]  Exciting stuff.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:17.860]  So I'm back.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.520]  Kind of like you guys said too,
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:25.800]  because it's hard to trust people
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:27.560]  when you give them your genetics
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:29.600]  and the price is just fucking outrageous.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:33.120]  So if I tried to send in 20 different seed lines
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.800]  to have those rescued,
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:39.440]  I could be looking at anywhere from upwards of like $10,000
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:42.080]  to get this stuff saved and held in a bank
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.680]  per line possibly.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:45.360]  Some places will do cheaper on bulks,
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:48.360]  but to rescue a seed to go from an embryo
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:51.200]  all the way to a plant that's stored in a bank,
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:53.520]  that's not cheating at all.
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.360]  No.
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.400]  Hopefully they'll get the cost down soon.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:02.220]  I had this guy who's probably in his 70s.
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:05.640]  This was maybe like three years ago,
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:06.840]  but he was starting to teach me
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.700]  how to kind of set up a home tissue culture setup.
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:11.020]  And he was talking about the fact
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:13.120]  that this has been around forever
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.080]  and that the things you need are not very expensive
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:22.240]  and obviously you'd need to watch someone do it
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.160]  and learn how to do it,
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:26.060]  but it's something that's totally within everyone's reach.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:37.600]  So let me get to some of the...
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:41.200]  Kyle Graham, and these are all questions
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.180]  possibly from like an hour or two ago,
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.920]  but Kyle Graham asked,
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:47.700]  can we talk about Cambodian strains?
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.840]  And then Cam Taylor had a question for you, Mean Gene.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:57.080]  He said, have you been able to lock down
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.680]  where in Afghanistan is the Afghani black app
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.780]  you used from?
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:05.440]  I don't know at all.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.040]  I mean, it's been cool to watch
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.600]  the Indian land race exchange trips to see.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:19.340]  There was that, you know, there was that,
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.940]  I don't know how to pronounce it.
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:24.940]  It was like Durand.
[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:28.540]  He showed those ones.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:30.320]  Those kind of had like a lot of the color
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.360]  and the look of those kinds of plants,
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.460]  but they were still a little bit different.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:36.980]  I don't really know, you know,
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:39.820]  I don't know anything about it other than, you know,
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:43.540]  than when my buddy was first given it
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.240]  by the guy whose family had had it forever,
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:49.260]  they were like, oh, this is just this old Afghani we've had.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:51.700]  And then I even, you know, talking to other people
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:56.620]  in that same family, that particular guy is passed on now,
[02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:59.940]  but, you know, they thought like, oh, it was some kind of,
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:01.580]  it was a hybrid.
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:03.020]  Back in the day, people were always like,
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:05.500]  oh, it's black Afi, it's black African.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.300]  And I was like, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:11.180]  And then finally, when we got it from the guy,
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:13.060]  the guy gave it to my buddy, he was like,
[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:16.020]  no, it's old Afghani, it's pure Afghani.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:17.960]  You grow it, the leaves are huge.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.760]  They're as big as my torso.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:24.600]  They have like, you know, 15 fingers, 15 leaflets.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:25.560]  They're just huge.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.840]  One leaflet will be like from my pinky to my thumb tip
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:32.040]  when you put your hand on the leaf like this.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.240]  They're very, very much Afghani, you know,
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.880]  like I've never seen anything, even African hybrids
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:43.100]  that have anything close to a look like that.
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:46.040]  So it's just, it's kind of a mysterious line.
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:48.800]  I think it's probably different than other black Afghanis.
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.160]  I know Bodhi has a black Afghani.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:55.760]  I know the closest thing that I've ever seen to it
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.760]  is the Afi that is in the LA Confidential.
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.100]  Like I got LA Confidential from a friend of mine,
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.700]  a bag of buds, and I was like, wow,
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.320]  this is just like the Afi.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:13.060]  And I know that that's that LA Afi that is in that.
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:17.060]  And there's all kinds of different stories about,
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.860]  oh, this one's this, or this is that.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:22.220]  Like the original real clone is just an old Afghani clone.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:24.940]  It's very, very close to what this is,
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:27.300]  which makes me think that probably there was a line
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:30.260]  that was passed around some point in the 80s.
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:31.940]  This one, supposedly they had had it
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:34.380]  since like the very end of the 70s.
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.780]  And up there in Spirok where I got it from.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:43.700]  And when I first started seeing it,
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:47.540]  it was like the same time when my buddy also had
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:51.660]  the deep chunk, which up here in Spirok,
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:54.620]  they call it monkey balls.
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:58.620]  And so it was like a lot of the Afi monkey cross.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:01.380]  And you could see like the little bit of difference
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:03.620]  where the deep chunk grows the leaves like this,
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:06.780]  where they're the big, heavy kind of claw-y leaves.
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:09.540]  And the Afi grows the leaves that are more like this.
[02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:11.180]  And you can't believe they can stand up
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.020]  because they're just so huge.
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:15.340]  And then when they become really big fan leaves
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:17.180]  after a while, they start to go like this,
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:21.220]  but the margins of the leaves still always wanna come up.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:24.700]  Whereas like the deep chunk always wants to roll under.
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:29.700]  They wanna kind of go up just a little bit or stay flat.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:34.420]  And the color on it would be like a lot of reds
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:38.060]  and a lot of reds.
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:42.580]  And black when it would finish.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:46.940]  And really definitely a really interesting one,
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:49.500]  but it had that thing in the air when you smoke it
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.980]  where like we used to smoke,
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.900]  I used to mulch up a bunch and put it in the volcano
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:57.900]  when we first, no monkey balls is not a knockoff
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:12:59.060]  reproduction line.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:00.300]  If you want evidence of that,
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.020]  you can look at Tom Hill's monkey haze,
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:08.020]  which is deep chunk crossed with positronics haze.
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:11.300]  And the reason why Tom Hill released it called monkey haze
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:14.380]  is because he calls deep chunk monkey balls.
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:16.180]  And that's what they call it in the neighborhood
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.300]  that I worked in, that I grew up in,
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:20.780]  where Tom Hill is from.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:25.780]  And that weed was known as Hussein Kush,
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:30.980]  Saddam Kush, Saddam Hussein, monkey balls, deep chunk,
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:37.980]  but purple monkey balls is a cross of something else
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:40.740]  like a granddaddy or something like that.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:44.460]  And yeah, purple monkey balls is different
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:45.620]  than monkey balls.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:50.620]  And it was just released as deep chunk.
[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:54.860]  It wasn't released as monkey balls.
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:58.780]  And so that's where like the confusion of that comes from.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:03.780]  But those were both like,
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:07.020]  those both showed up like at the very end of the seventies,
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:08.580]  the very early eighties.
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.740]  It's always hard to pin down like exactly when,
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:13.300]  but they were some of the more early ones.
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:17.380]  And that's the original stuff
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:19.180]  that people called like skunk bud,
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:21.900]  even though now people wouldn't say it's that skunky,
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:25.540]  but in comparison, it's those early Afghanis
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.180]  and the black Afghanis like that,
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:30.940]  when you smoke it, when you smoke the best black Afghani
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:33.060]  or the best deep chunk,
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:35.580]  you get like the smell in the air.
[02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:37.980]  That's like, it's just like,
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:39.220]  you're like, oh, what is that?
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.300]  It smells really good.
[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:41.580]  It smells like some kind of weird,
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:43.540]  like cosmetics and incense.
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:45.580]  And it's really hard to describe,
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:46.860]  but you'll know it if you smell it.
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.980]  We used to call it reggae weed
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:50.060]  because we'd be at reggae on the river
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:53.220]  and we didn't really have that weed in the mid nineties,
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:55.780]  but we'd go to reggae on the river in the early nineties
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.620]  when we were kids and we'd smell it.
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:00.260]  And we'd be like, oh, what is that?
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:02.740]  And so when we finally had it, we'd smell it.
[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:05.020]  We'd be like, damn, that's that reggae weed.
[02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:10.220]  And so like Afi, deep chunk, some cookies, sometimes,
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:13.580]  some bubba, you'll smell it in the air.
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:14.660]  Hazes like that.
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:15.940]  It's this really cool thing.
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.380]  And we'd call it reggae weed,
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:21.460]  but we used to put the Afi in the volcano.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.900]  When I first got the volcano
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:25.660]  and we had like the big six foot long bag
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:26.660]  and we'd fill it up.
[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:29.740]  And once you put the Afi in the bag, it was the Afi bag.
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:31.940]  Like you couldn't, anything you put in there,
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:33.340]  it just smelled like Afi.
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:34.620]  It's hard to describe the smell,
[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:36.900]  but it would just stay there like this,
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.020]  like, like nog chomp a soap or something,
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.740]  like a mix of that kind of stuff.
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:45.780]  And it would just be there and a super cool line.
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:49.220]  It didn't mold like the monkey balls wanted to mold.
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:51.660]  It didn't want to get powdery mildew as bad.
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:56.660]  It grew to be bigger and the buds weren't as dense.
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.700]  They were, there was more of them in there
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.740]  that were kind of leafy and loose.
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:02.620]  And when I got it, it had been worked.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:06.380]  And I just got back pure seeds,
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:08.340]  got one female thought they were fake
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:10.260]  cause they didn't look good.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:12.940]  Left a bunch of little plants and six packs to die
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:16.180]  and got one male that was like the straight,
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:18.260]  real dank Afi that I knew.
[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:20.740]  And I re-vegetated and I've had it now
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:22.860]  and bred it with other stuff that I have
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.220]  that's Afi dominant.
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:26.220]  And so I have a ton of those seeds.
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:28.020]  If they come out good, I'll probably put some of those out
[02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:29.700]  so people get more happy stuff.
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:31.500]  But yeah, the Afi is a mysterious one.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:34.540]  We don't really know anything about it except it.
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:39.060]  A lot of them there that my pride of Afghanistan.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:42.380]  My buddy up in Oregon brought me down some weed
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:44.660]  and I said, what is this?
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:47.540]  And he says, oh, it's Afghani.
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:50.980]  And I said, wow, can you get me any seeds?
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:51.900]  And he says, well, I don't know.
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.740]  And then eventually he got me some
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:56.380]  and I don't know how old they are.
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:59.740]  And we don't even know the origin,
[02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:02.820]  whereabouts in Afghanistan they came from or whatever,
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:05.220]  but they're weird looking seeds.
[02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:10.220]  They're like, part of the seed looks bleached out
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:15.460]  and then the other part has got some color to it.
[02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:18.700]  It's like it's been dipped.
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:20.860]  And they all come out that way.
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.540]  The weirdest thing.
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:25.460]  This guy was growing these plants up in Oregon, big plants.
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:28.860]  And I got my buddy to get them from him.
[02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:31.620]  And then I've had them ever since.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:36.020]  And then there's another one from Kabul
[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:40.580]  that a friend of mine's son-in-law went over there
[02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:43.060]  and brought them back.
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:48.060]  And they're from the 90s, I think.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:56.580]  They're kind of more recent, but a good line.
[02:17:57.580 --> 02:18:00.380]  There's still a lot of different Afghanis out there.
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:03.300]  I mean, I'm sure there's plenty
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:07.780]  that we haven't run across yet,
[02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:11.260]  but I'm always on the lookout for different things.
[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:16.260]  And you just put the energy out there
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:19.540]  and usually you can find them.
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:21.060]  Some of this stuff takes forever.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:22.060]  It's like the tie.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:27.500]  You know, I'd like to, when I was in Thailand,
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.740]  I couldn't get anything decent.
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:32.780]  It was all dirt, crap.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:35.380]  Got it from this old cab driver
[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:37.620]  and we never could get anything decent.
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.660]  We didn't have a good connection over there.
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:41.820]  So it's like anything.
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:46.100]  But anyway, well, guys,
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:49.060]  I'm gonna have to get rolling here pretty quick.
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:51.100]  Well, so let me just give you the last,
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:54.860]  because it's Afghan related.
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:57.460]  Copied often said,
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:59.380]  what were some of the first Afghan types
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:01.220]  Kaju experienced and when?
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.140]  And were they local to certain areas
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:05.300]  like Humboldt, Pine Bud, et cetera?
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:09.860]  First Afghani?
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:11.900]  Right.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:17.860]  First Afghani was from the elephant ear,
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:22.220]  Paddy's black Afghani hash.
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.060]  I found seeds in those.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:24.980]  That was the first that I ever grew.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:28.540]  Stuff that just choke you out.
[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:30.740]  No wonder they don't smoke it.
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:31.780]  They make hash out of it.
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.620]  I don't know.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:34.220]  The stuff was just too strong for me.
[02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:37.620]  I mean, I don't know how it would compare with nowadays,
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:42.140]  but I think it would probably still be pretty strong.
[02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:46.900]  I tried some stuff that I got from a guy
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:48.820]  and it called the yellow scorpion.
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:53.820]  It's a particular strain that was selected.
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:58.540]  And it was a golden color that they made hash out of
[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:01.260]  from this little place.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:02.380]  I don't remember the town,
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:06.900]  but it's an older guy that people come to for years
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:08.500]  and he's got the best hash.
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:10.780]  Tourists come there and probably some of the locals too.
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:15.780]  But anyway, yeah, that's the first hash I ever grew.
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:19.100]  Hash plant, Afghanis.
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:26.200]  Well, we appreciate your time
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:31.200]  and I hope you'll jump back on soon.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:33.720]  And I'll let you go.
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:35.080]  I'm gonna keep these other guys on
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.200]  for a couple more minutes.
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:38.360]  Okay, you guys take care.
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:40.360]  Nice chatting with everybody.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:41.640]  You too, man.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:43.040]  All right, peace.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:43.880]  Have a good one.
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:44.720]  See ya.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.840]  Thank you for your time, sir.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:47.680]  Take care.
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:53.320]  All right, so I got some housekeeping with you guys.
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:54.640]  So I just put up,
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:58.880]  people were asking me when I'm gonna put up
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.200]  the T-1000, Gelato 30, the crosses.
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:04.600]  So I just put up the,
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.280]  they're probably all gone by now,
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:13.280]  but I put up the T-1000 cross.
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:17.080]  I did not yet post the Cherry West,
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:22.360]  which is crossed with the Sky Cuttler, the Double Kush.
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.960]  And then my question to you
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:31.560]  is so I have two of the original Black Lime Reserve F1s.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:38.000]  And the idea was for Lucas, Eclectic Elegance,
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.640]  anybody who buys his stuff
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:43.120]  will be entered into the raffle to win one.
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:44.240]  I'm wondering if you're cool
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:47.560]  with if anybody buys Coastal Seeds,
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:51.840]  if at some point I do a raffle drawing for the other one.
[02:21:55.290 --> 02:21:57.410]  Yeah, I'm not worried, man.
[02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:59.890]  It's just put them up to,
[02:22:01.330 --> 02:22:04.810]  just put them up to help out whoever, you know?
[02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:09.050]  I feel like he is also deserving, so.
[02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:12.530]  If you're down with that, I will say that,
[02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:16.450]  and I'll do the Eclectic Elegance drawing
[02:22:16.450 --> 02:22:17.570]  in like the next week.
[02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.850]  I'm just kind of slightly overwhelmed
[02:22:19.850 --> 02:22:21.370]  with a lot of stuff right now.
[02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:24.270]  And then I'll give the Coastal stuff a minute.
[02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:27.050]  But I appreciate it.
[02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:32.050]  And I think, so a while ago, Jackson, someone asked,
[02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:44.660]  what do you see in, so this was from Arum Park.
[02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:47.700]  What do you see in Kagyu's breeding
[02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:50.220]  that you find appealing given your experience?
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:53.180]  Like what do the two of you, I mean,
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:54.700]  I kind of wanted to let him talk,
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:58.680]  but I'd also like, you guys are, you know your shit,
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.020]  and like what do you both respect about him?
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:08.020]  I mean, he has a really good idea
[02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:11.620]  of like what kind of is really
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:17.340]  like legendary and worthwhile.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:22.260]  He's seen a lot of different stuff.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:25.780]  You can see too, he has a background
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:30.780]  in breeding other crops, which is super cool
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:33.420]  because he has a little bit of a different idea
[02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:35.700]  of how he looks at stuff because they were breeding
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:38.780]  for, you know, real specific things,
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.260]  not for like, oh, are people gonna like this
[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:44.300]  or like that, but like actually like looking at plants
[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:45.700]  in that sense.
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:50.580]  And then like, you know, you can hear him talk.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:54.260]  You can tell when people have actually done stuff
[02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:55.820]  because they have a different outlook.
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:59.220]  Like when you ask him, you know,
[02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:02.300]  how do you pick a male?
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:05.700]  You know, he's not like, oh, I want a big fat stem
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:07.380]  and I want a really tall plant.
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:10.740]  And I don't want any of them that finish too fast
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:13.860]  or whatever it is, you know, like there's no,
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:15.220]  there's not really any myth there.
[02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:17.180]  He's like, yeah, you know, I had to grow them
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:20.220]  a couple of times and then I had a good idea
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:21.340]  of what was good.
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:26.340]  And so it's like, you know, it's like observation
[02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:29.500]  and evidence-based breeding where he's actually looking
[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:33.740]  at it and the perspective of a person looking at the plants,
[02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:37.860]  you know, and he's a older dude.
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:40.420]  So like, he knows, like, if you ask me,
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:43.300]  like, what's real tie stick, like, I have absolutely
[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:46.420]  no idea what kind of a terpene profile that is.
[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:47.380]  I don't know.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:48.260]  I can't tell you.
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:53.140]  I can't tell you if, you know, the best that I can do
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:56.580]  is take information from guys like him that are
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:59.100]  of that generation that I grew up with,
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.460]  who told me things like I'd show them weed
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:04.020]  and they'd go, oh dude, this smells just like
[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:06.140]  the first time I smelled Oaxacan.
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:09.460]  Or this is like the Afghani that we first got
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:12.940]  the first time and I haven't seen this for a long time,
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:16.940]  you know, like, but he's, you know, he's a guy who,
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:18.260]  he is one of those guys.
[02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:23.220]  He's one of that older generation of dudes where,
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:25.620]  you know, like his generation was the people
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:30.260]  who kind of rediscovered, you know, Sensimiya
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:34.260]  and all that kind of stuff to where, you know,
[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:37.060]  you gotta listen to it.
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:39.100]  And that's not to say that that automatically
[02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:41.140]  there's people too from that generation
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:44.740]  where everything is myth and nothing's based on observation
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:48.140]  or critical thinking, but I can listen to him
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:50.620]  and I'm like, okay, this guy makes sense.
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:54.140]  Like everything he says, it's not, it's not some bullshit.
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:58.540]  I know like when I listen, I'm not like, okay, well,
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:02.900]  you know, this is, this guy, he's done a lot of shit wrong
[02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:06.660]  for a long time, you know, it's like, I can tell he's,
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:10.420]  he's been really studying stuff for a long time.
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:13.420]  And, you know, like you can't, you know,
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:17.340]  it's like being, doing whatever you are,
[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:21.460]  if you're a mechanic or you're a doctor or you're a sailor
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.580]  or whatever it is you do, like everybody can read some books
[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:27.340]  and people can jump on and get some experience
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:29.300]  and do things for two or three years.
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:33.020]  And, you know, by the time he said he's only been breeding
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:37.260]  seriously for 15 years, but by the time he started breeding,
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:42.140]  he probably was already at a really high level of breeding
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:44.380]  just because of all the observation he did
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:45.740]  over all those years.
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:50.740]  And, and then, you know, you couple that time experience,
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:56.100]  hands-on stuff with actually being somebody who has like
[02:26:57.100 --> 02:27:02.100]  a cool outlook on things and good critical thinking skills
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:04.300]  and everything.
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:05.980]  And it's like, yeah, you're gonna have,
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:10.220]  he's gonna be doing cool stuff with plants.
[02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:13.380]  That's gonna be valuable work just because of the way,
[02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:14.620]  you know, he's looking at stuff.
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:17.540]  So, you know, it's cool.
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:21.260]  And so cool, he's a, people like that are, are like,
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:22.940]  they're like treasures because there's,
[02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:24.820]  there's not very many of them, you know,
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:28.060]  and the older people get the less and less of his,
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:29.700]  you know, you hear him talking about classic.
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:32.620]  Classic sounds like he really knew his shit too
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:34.620]  and was a really cool preservationist.
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:38.300]  And it's like, oh, well, it's 2019, he's here.
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:40.900]  2021, he's gone, you know?
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:45.900]  So, you know, there's like, it's, you, you gotta,
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:49.820]  you gotta listen to these guys while they're here.
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:54.180]  And, and, you know, so.
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:56.180]  That's my take on it.
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:27:59.060]  That's like, that's like I DMed Lee Perry,
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:01.700]  like a year and change ago.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:05.500]  I was like, do you wanna come on a cannabis YouTube show
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:06.820]  and just talk music?
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:08.100]  I mean, he never got back to me,
[02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:10.820]  but then obviously he died, so.
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:13.820]  But like toots.
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:19.020]  If you're a reggae fan or you're a fan of any of the music,
[02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:22.780]  like if you like blues or old, old R&B,
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.580]  soul music and stuff like that,
[02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.180]  and you're like, okay,
[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:29.220]  here's the list of people who are still around
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:31.380]  that do, that are like iconic.
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:33.060]  And here's the list of people who aren't.
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:36.460]  And the list of people 20 years ago,
[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:38.940]  there was a lot of people who you can go,
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:41.780]  wow, these people were really big in the 50s and 60s
[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:43.340]  and even the 70s.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:45.340]  And now you look at that list and you're like,
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:50.340]  yeah, there's not, you know, I mean, you don't have who,
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.340]  you know, whoever with reggae.
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:57.340]  It's like the list of people who I saw in Jamaica
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:03.380]  at a couple big parties basically in 2010 and 2014.
[02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:08.860]  Like there's a ton of people there who are just like,
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:12.900]  you know, Bob Andy and, you know, I mean,
[02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:14.420]  there's just, there's a ton of them
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:15.860]  and they're just, they're all gone.
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:18.620]  So you gotta soak up stuff.
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:20.980]  People take it for granted.
[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:24.540]  Because people, a lot of people are old for 20 or 30 years,
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:27.020]  you know, and then they're gone.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:29.900]  And so, you know, the old school dudes are there,
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:32.500]  they have something you just can't,
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:35.540]  there's no way to pull that out of thin air.
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:40.540]  Like that's only, only time gave them those edges, you know.
[02:29:44.010 --> 02:29:45.570]  Yeah, Albert Griffiths.
[02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:48.410]  Yeah.
[02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:52.090]  Someone asked, would love to hear you talk
[02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:54.370]  about that bag seed pink champagne.
[02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:55.970]  I know it's not, this is one love.
[02:29:55.970 --> 02:29:57.170]  I know it's not land-raised,
[02:29:57.170 --> 02:30:02.170]  but I used to get pink champagne zips in 2002 to 2004
[02:30:02.410 --> 02:30:05.050]  in Sacramento area, haven't seen it since.
[02:30:07.330 --> 02:30:12.330]  So I got that because I had a one time Frenchie
[02:30:12.610 --> 02:30:17.610]  and a couple of buddies of ours came by together.
[02:30:18.890 --> 02:30:23.890]  They on Instagram are East born, West grown.
[02:30:23.890 --> 02:30:28.890]  And they got some weed from me
[02:30:29.890 --> 02:30:32.010]  and they found a couple of seeds in it and they popped them
[02:30:32.010 --> 02:30:35.290]  and they got this really cool lime thing out of there.
[02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:36.570]  That was awesome.
[02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:41.570]  And I kept it for a little bit and I was gonna seed it,
[02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:44.290]  but I had it in a winter greenhouse
[02:30:44.290 --> 02:30:46.570]  where there was like 400 watt lights running
[02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:51.170]  in like a shipping container with a clear roof on it
[02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:54.050]  and like a little radiator heater
[02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:56.930]  and a lot of stuff in there did good.
[02:30:56.930 --> 02:30:59.210]  And some stuff in there hermed out.
[02:30:59.210 --> 02:31:01.810]  And because it was a breeding with the lime pot male,
[02:31:01.810 --> 02:31:04.210]  anything that started to form any male flowers,
[02:31:04.210 --> 02:31:05.530]  I had to chop out.
[02:31:07.410 --> 02:31:12.410]  And in hindsight, as bad as the conditions were in there,
[02:31:12.890 --> 02:31:14.330]  it was still a pretty stable plant.
[02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:16.090]  They'd run it indoor and done fine.
[02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:18.810]  But I looked at it and I was like, all right,
[02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:20.970]  well, if it's unstable, I don't wanna breed it anyway.
[02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:22.490]  And I chopped it down.
[02:31:22.490 --> 02:31:25.290]  And so I got rid of it.
[02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:27.410]  But when they gave it back to me,
[02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:29.570]  they gave me another plant and they were like,
[02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:31.570]  oh, this is this pink champagne
[02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:32.930]  that we got in a bag of weed.
[02:31:32.930 --> 02:31:35.170]  It's a bag seed, you know?
[02:31:35.170 --> 02:31:37.050]  And I was like, okay, cool.
[02:31:37.050 --> 02:31:39.890]  And I grew it and I had it and I kept it around
[02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:42.890]  and I didn't really do much with it.
[02:31:42.890 --> 02:31:47.490]  And then it got flowered out.
[02:31:47.490 --> 02:31:50.170]  And it's one of those plants where like,
[02:31:50.170 --> 02:31:53.730]  when you grow it outside, it kind of looks like it's indoor
[02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:56.330]  because it stays so like pristine looking.
[02:31:56.330 --> 02:32:00.970]  It's just very shiny and like, and looks untouched,
[02:32:00.970 --> 02:32:02.970]  even though like it's been rained on and stuff.
[02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:06.530]  There's certain plants that do really good like that.
[02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:09.850]  And they're pretty rare in my experience,
[02:32:09.850 --> 02:32:11.770]  but it just looked like it was just frosted out.
[02:32:11.810 --> 02:32:14.610]  It actually had a really similar look.
[02:32:15.610 --> 02:32:19.170]  Once it was dry, untrimmed,
[02:32:19.170 --> 02:32:21.170]  it looked a lot like the Northern Lights clone
[02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:24.490]  that we had for years where it was just green weed
[02:32:24.490 --> 02:32:27.650]  with really bright orange hairs and just tons of resin.
[02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:31.730]  And it has a smell that reminds me in a way of cookies.
[02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:35.410]  And it reminds me in a way of like blackberry,
[02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:38.490]  but it's really, really potent.
[02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:40.530]  And it has, it puts on a ton of resin
[02:32:40.530 --> 02:32:43.810]  and it stays really squat and it's not fast growing,
[02:32:43.810 --> 02:32:48.810]  but like I crossed it and my buddy, South Lake Farms grew it
[02:32:49.930 --> 02:32:53.810]  and I got to go see, not the pure,
[02:32:53.810 --> 02:32:57.570]  but it crossed with the lime F5 males.
[02:32:57.570 --> 02:32:59.410]  And walking through the garden, I was like,
[02:32:59.410 --> 02:33:02.050]  damn, what's that thing with those cannons on it?
[02:33:02.050 --> 02:33:06.370]  And he was like, oh, that's the pink champagne
[02:33:06.370 --> 02:33:07.250]  crossed with the lime.
[02:33:07.250 --> 02:33:08.290]  And I was like, damn, okay.
[02:33:08.290 --> 02:33:10.970]  The lime tends to have like these little buds
[02:33:10.970 --> 02:33:12.130]  and big stacks of them.
[02:33:12.130 --> 02:33:15.210]  And it only really yields heavy if you have a big plant
[02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:17.570]  of it because there's little buds everywhere.
[02:33:17.570 --> 02:33:19.690]  But these were like smaller plants
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.730]  and the pink champagne had just turned it
[02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:24.330]  into just these like straight,
[02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:25.970]  just chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk,
[02:33:25.970 --> 02:33:27.690]  building up to a huge cola
[02:33:27.690 --> 02:33:30.290]  and big buds all the way up and down.
[02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:33.770]  And so it was cool to see that it throws
[02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:36.410]  like the big buds into the mix like that.
[02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:41.410]  So I crossed it with the root beer back cross two male,
[02:33:42.130 --> 02:33:45.490]  which was the twin of the Coca-Cola,
[02:33:45.490 --> 02:33:47.930]  which is a way more jagged leaf than all of them.
[02:33:47.930 --> 02:33:49.430]  They're kind of rare in there.
[02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:54.290]  And I crossed it with that lime, of course.
[02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:56.330]  I crossed it this past season.
[02:33:56.330 --> 02:33:57.730]  I crossed it with the pina.
[02:33:57.730 --> 02:34:00.410]  I think that'll do really, really good.
[02:34:00.410 --> 02:34:05.410]  And that was a THC dominant pina lime.
[02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:09.970]  And Skunk Tech brought up his purple,
[02:34:09.970 --> 02:34:12.490]  for the little purple tester to see like.
[02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:18.090]  Just quickly, is Skunk Tech not doing cuts anymore
[02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:20.450]  after the next round?
[02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:23.370]  I think he's just overwhelmed because he's doing
[02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:26.330]  a lot of breeding work and he keeps a ton of things.
[02:34:26.330 --> 02:34:31.130]  And so trying to actually like make extras
[02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:34.690]  to be able to release any, I think is just too much.
[02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:39.690]  It's like a great, it's like a great thing
[02:34:41.090 --> 02:34:44.730]  to like keep you afloat.
[02:34:44.730 --> 02:34:48.130]  But I think it's just kind of too, it's just too much.
[02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:51.290]  He's got like, I mean, no shit.
[02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:55.490]  He probably has like 300 different cuts or something.
[02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:59.690]  Like he has a lot of different stuff and he'll grow out tons
[02:34:59.690 --> 02:35:01.690]  and we'll look through jars and we'll be like,
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:03.170]  all right, kill this one, kill this one,
[02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:04.690]  kill this one, kill this one.
[02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:05.530]  And I'll be like, all right,
[02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:06.770]  I'm gonna go kill all those ones.
[02:35:06.770 --> 02:35:08.250]  And then I'll talk to him like two days later
[02:35:08.250 --> 02:35:10.490]  and I'd be like, dude, I couldn't kill him.
[02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:11.490]  I just still have him.
[02:35:11.490 --> 02:35:13.050]  I need to like run him one more time.
[02:35:13.050 --> 02:35:16.210]  And I'm like, dude, it's getting to be crazy
[02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:19.170]  when you just have so many things, but it's doable.
[02:35:19.170 --> 02:35:22.130]  As long as you have space, you keep it in a small pot
[02:35:22.130 --> 02:35:24.970]  and it gets big and you take a couple of cuts off of it.
[02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:30.010]  But he's been doing, he did a bunch of like a fem work
[02:35:30.010 --> 02:35:31.930]  with that headband cut that he had.
[02:35:32.770 --> 02:35:37.770]  And he's just been doing like tons of work
[02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:41.970]  and then he grows those out and then he clones them
[02:35:41.970 --> 02:35:43.290]  in case he gets a killer.
[02:35:43.290 --> 02:35:44.690]  And then we go through and you're like,
[02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:46.810]  all right, well, these seem good.
[02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:51.050]  So he winds up having, it's hard to take flats of,
[02:35:51.050 --> 02:35:53.610]  take an extra 10 or 20 of something
[02:35:54.770 --> 02:35:56.890]  or even an extra five of something
[02:35:56.890 --> 02:35:58.770]  when you have hundreds of different cuts.
[02:35:58.770 --> 02:36:00.610]  So I think he's kind of burnt on it.
[02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:03.170]  And I think he's kind of, that's what he said.
[02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:06.450]  He's kind of closing that thing out.
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:15.200]  Yeah, the chat, we're going down a blues rabbit hole
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.840]  right now from like Sunhouse, Robert Johnson days
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.120]  all the way up to kind of more, yeah, Bloomfield, yes.
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:27.040]  Get out of my life, woman.
[02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:32.670]  Or no, Walking Shoes, right?
[02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:34.470]  Walking Shoes is an epic song.
[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:40.260]  I really like old, real super grimy blues.
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:42.340]  Like Lightnin' Hopkins is one of my favorites
[02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:43.940]  because it's just like very rough
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.740]  and he plays these really weird,
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:50.020]  really weird formats where it'll be like,
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:53.460]  the turnarounds are like not where you think
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.900]  they're gonna be and super cool.
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:00.100]  And he just has like so much character
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:02.820]  in his singing and in his playing and stuff.
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:04.500]  I kind of like that grimy stuff.
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:10.500]  I remember I was 16 and I lived in France
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:15.740]  and this guy, Luther Guitar Jr. Johnson came through
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:19.300]  and my two friends opened up for him.
[02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:24.300]  And he was just like a total character.
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:26.660]  He was basically like Soul Gloat.
[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:30.260]  Like he had like the coming to America,
[02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:34.220]  like curly, like long hair with like just dripping.
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:37.940]  And I remember he couldn't read or write.
[02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:40.700]  So like we asked for his, and we didn't know this,
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:42.300]  but like we asked for his autograph
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:44.620]  and he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:48.420]  And it was literally like 30 minutes of him trying to like,
[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:53.420]  write his name from like memory.
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:58.340]  And then they opened for Hot Tuna,
[02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:01.580]  which is pretty cool.
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:03.420]  I don't know if anyone remembers Hot Tuna,
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:08.420]  Jorma Kaukonen and yeah, Howlin' Wolf,
[02:38:08.740 --> 02:38:10.660]  Muddy Waters, Albert King.
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:17.240]  Generally anybody whose middle name is Guitar,
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:22.240]  when they bill them, they're pretty fucking killer.
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:24.920]  There's a bunch of them.
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:28.720]  There's a bunch of dudes and I'm trying to place,
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:33.160]  there's one guy who's like super acrobatic and shit,
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:34.640]  but I can't place his name right now.
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:36.440]  But it's another one of those dudes,
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.600]  where Guitar is your middle name.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:42.640]  You're like, okay, yeah, you probably play guitar
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.040]  pretty good where you grew up,
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:46.640]  your Guitar is your middle name.
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.160]  Yeah, let me just get that hair, hold on.
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:02.180]  If you can see that, it's silhouetted,
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:04.900]  but you can still see the epic hair.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:07.300]  Whoops, hold on.
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:11.940]  Let's see if there, now he's old, but this was,
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:22.920]  yeah, when I met him, his hair was kind of like this,
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:23.840]  a little longer.
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:36.420]  But, all right, let me just get back to the questions.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:52.500]  So this was for him, but I mean, between the two of you,
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:55.260]  this was for Monkey Mang.
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:59.020]  What are the most insensi land races you've experienced,
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:01.620]  similar to the trademark Hazen Sen,
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:03.260]  supposedly from Columbian?
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:07.940]  For me, it was the Afghanis.
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:10.460]  There seems to be different Afghanis
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:17.620]  that seem unrelated to me that all have that in common.
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:22.180]  So I don't know where that comes from,
[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:25.820]  but I'm imagining it's probably one of the original,
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:31.740]  one of the original things that's in original weed.
[02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:35.700]  And then as it went different places and evolved,
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:37.300]  it stayed in certain places,
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.660]  because that's how things tend to be.
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:44.660]  If they're like, if you look at a real extreme Sativa,
[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:49.260]  like Haze, and then you look at a real extreme Afghani,
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:52.500]  like Deep Chunk, and they both have that to them,
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:53.340]  you're like, all right,
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:56.740]  I mean, it probably is pretty ancestral stuff.
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:59.420]  It's probably been in there from way back.
[02:40:59.420 --> 02:41:01.580]  I think like that heavy terpenoline too
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:03.300]  is probably like that.
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:07.140]  And some of those more heavy, like berry,
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.460]  berry sweet, sweet, sweet smells.
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:12.740]  It's probably a few things that were kind of in most weed,
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:15.380]  and then it went different directions.
[02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:16.620]  Yeah, Mazar.
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:19.940]  I mean, I think probably all through Afghanistan,
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:22.660]  there's probably, if you pop any Afghani seeds
[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:23.820]  and you go through enough,
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:26.180]  you'll probably find some that do that.
[02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:28.740]  Because I've never seen anything
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:30.540]  where every plant is like that,
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:33.260]  but like Deep Chunk and Black Afi,
[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:34.460]  they were common in there.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:36.700]  I had this one called Big Blue that was the best.
[02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:40.980]  It had the extra, it just was extra gnarly like that.
[02:41:40.980 --> 02:41:43.900]  And I think it was probably just the same thing
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:46.580]  as Deep Chunk, but bred by a different guy
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:51.100]  on the hill across the way, you know, since way back.
[02:41:58.970 --> 02:41:59.930]  You saw that.
[02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:03.770]  And then actually Family Tree,
[02:42:04.690 --> 02:42:07.430]  this reminds me the Maroof Red.
[02:42:09.130 --> 02:42:11.010]  Have you had any experience with that?
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  Because Tyler is doing some crosses with the Maroof Red.
[02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:21.920]  I haven't checked them out.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:24.000]  I haven't checked them out.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.360]  Yeah, I haven't worked with that.
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:28.320]  I was gonna say that that Duckfoot I worked with this year
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:31.160]  had an incense profile that came out of it.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:34.840]  As well as agreeing with Jackson
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:38.080]  on that old Afghani purse weed we used to call it.
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:39.840]  It had that smell that would come out
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:41.840]  scentsy and perfumey,
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:45.480]  completely different than some of the other
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:46.960]  accurate type of Afghani.
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:59.000]  This was, he asked this question before, a while ago.
[02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:08.580]  Meaning like seeing
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:13.620]  like hairs on the plants just in veg or?
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.460]  Yeah, we'll wait for some clarification on that one.
[02:43:27.970 --> 02:43:29.890]  I'm actually trying to see if these are showing
[02:43:29.890 --> 02:43:31.050]  what they're saying right now.
[02:43:31.050 --> 02:43:32.330]  It's just an early sign.
[02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:35.970]  It's really nothing that I would
[02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:37.930]  give much weight to it really.
[02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:39.450]  These are still in beds right now.
[02:43:39.450 --> 02:43:41.050]  These are my mud bones.
[02:43:41.050 --> 02:43:43.890]  This is what I'm working this year with on the mud bones.
[02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:45.570]  I have them outside.
[02:43:48.250 --> 02:43:49.450]  They're getting sun out here.
[02:43:49.450 --> 02:43:51.930]  I put them in the tent at night and then I bring them out.
[02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:54.210]  I'm gonna let them get a little bigger
[02:43:54.210 --> 02:43:56.090]  and then I'm gonna flip them out here.
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:01.860]  I'm just checking them right now.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:04.160]  I'm gonna be doing a back cross to the bubble.
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:07.660]  There's a Northern Lights 2 out here.
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:09.940]  There's gonna be Mudbone F2s coming.
[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:13.180]  But yeah, I'm just trying to see.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:14.780]  It'd be hard to show you guys.
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:18.620]  But some of the seed plants might be showing
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:21.020]  that exactly what he's talking about.
[02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:24.340]  I said somebody clarified it I think
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:27.140]  because they understood it different than I understood it.
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:30.140]  So seeing only single pistil instead of two.
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:34.620]  Yeah, so the pistil is actually the combination
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:39.620]  of the all the kalex and usually the pair of stigmas.
[02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:43.500]  So technically what we're saying here
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:46.540]  is seeing only one stigma instead of two.
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:52.740]  The stigma being the part that looks like a hair.
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:57.660]  And so I don't really know.
[02:44:57.660 --> 02:45:01.340]  I don't think there's really an issue with that.
[02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:04.020]  It means if it kept on doing it,
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:05.460]  you'd have less hairy weed,
[02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:08.220]  which I think probably in flower,
[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:13.220]  the hairs are the worst part of the flower.
[02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:19.020]  They burn the hottest, they contaminate ashes the easiest,
[02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:25.700]  they mold the fastest because they tend to be
[02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:30.180]  the only thing dead on a bud when it matures.
[02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:36.180]  And dead tissue is gonna rot.
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:41.180]  And so I don't think there's really an issue.
[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:49.380]  It's kind of interesting, but yeah, I don't know.
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:53.060]  I can't think of seeing it.
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:57.180]  It might be a plant that would be less likely
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:46:00.140]  to be pollinated if it continued in the flower also.
[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:01.820]  Yeah, possibly.
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:02.660]  Yeah.
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:07.580]  Lime spill is not, lime spill,
[02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:08.660]  I don't know what lime spill is.
[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:12.140]  Maybe it's black lime reserve oil spill or something,
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:14.700]  but I didn't make lime spill myself.
[02:46:17.770 --> 02:46:18.730]  Now just looking,
[02:46:18.730 --> 02:46:21.810]  cause I was smoking something with face off in it.
[02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:26.930]  That face off is nice.
[02:46:30.130 --> 02:46:31.130]  What was it?
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.680]  Oh, spanner, spanner.
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:53.560]  Must be at the very bottom.
[02:46:59.830 --> 02:47:01.950]  This is all stuff from Lucas.
[02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:07.230]  Yeah, a lot of people were looking for that.
[02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:09.550]  They were hitting me up asking where it was,
[02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:11.190]  how do I get it?
[02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:13.830]  I'm not sure if it's all on there yet or not, man.
[02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:14.670]  It's coming.
[02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:18.150]  What are we talking about?
[02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:20.310]  Oh, Lucas's gear.
[02:47:20.310 --> 02:47:22.230]  I had a lot of people asking about it.
[02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:24.350]  It's all up there.
[02:47:25.430 --> 02:47:40.750]  He needs to send more in, but that's for Jackson.
[02:47:43.810 --> 02:47:47.330]  I need to pop some of his meat breath reserves myself.
[02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:50.050]  He sent me a bunch of those and keeps telling me to pop them
[02:47:50.050 --> 02:47:52.810]  and I'm gonna try to do that.
[02:47:52.810 --> 02:47:53.930]  Yeah.
[02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:54.770]  Yeah.
[02:48:00.250 --> 02:48:02.970]  He's been sending me seeds since like 2000
[02:48:03.010 --> 02:48:06.850]  and like 2011 or something,
[02:48:06.850 --> 02:48:08.970]  I've got some of his earliest crosses.
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:22.210]  Yeah, I'm hoping someone who went to the seed swap yesterday
[02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:30.730]  picked me up some Lebanese puck crosses.
[02:48:32.770 --> 02:48:36.010]  Oh man, those things went fast, fast, fast.
[02:48:36.010 --> 02:48:39.450]  I was looking everywhere and they sold out at every site.
[02:48:40.290 --> 02:48:42.570]  As soon as they hit the damn airwaves,
[02:48:42.570 --> 02:48:44.050]  them things were gone.
[02:48:44.050 --> 02:48:46.690]  And they should be too because those are some good crosses
[02:48:46.690 --> 02:48:47.850]  and some good ass weed.
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:55.420]  Oil spill.
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:10.140]  Yeah, I think it's oil spill from Emerald Mountain or?
[02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:20.410]  Isn't that the oil spill?
[02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:25.330]  Is, I see Gene, they did the oil spill once
[02:49:25.330 --> 02:49:26.890]  and so did Emerald Mountain, I believe.
[02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:28.690]  They both have one.
[02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:32.170]  I think Gene and, it dropped on one,
[02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:34.530]  they was with a fish and not off, I'm not,
[02:49:34.530 --> 02:49:36.090]  well, I might be wrong though.
[02:49:43.270 --> 02:49:44.910]  What are we trying to figure out?
[02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:51.310]  We're talking oil spill and then someone said
[02:49:51.310 --> 02:49:56.310]  they're popping Nick's Black Lime Reserve Royal
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:04.680]  from Lime Rising.
[02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:12.430]  So have you tried, Jackson, have you tried,
[02:50:12.430 --> 02:50:15.550]  I mean, everybody is crossing your stuff.
[02:50:15.550 --> 02:50:18.150]  Do you try it all or do you try to like?
[02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:21.270]  If somebody, if I see it in person,
[02:50:21.270 --> 02:50:22.510]  I don't try all the seeds
[02:50:22.510 --> 02:50:25.310]  because I have to pop all the things I'm already popping.
[02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:29.870]  Like I pretty much almost,
[02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:32.590]  people give me cool stuff made with my stuff
[02:50:32.590 --> 02:50:37.430]  or Black Lime Reserve crosses
[02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:38.830]  and all the different stuff.
[02:50:38.830 --> 02:50:42.190]  And I put it away because it's cool to have
[02:50:42.190 --> 02:50:44.510]  because all of it could be crazy,
[02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:47.110]  but I don't have time to go through all of it.
[02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:50.750]  But I do see jars back of cool stuff.
[02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:53.270]  And some stuff's insane.
[02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:54.550]  Like it's really cool
[02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:58.630]  because everybody can only make what they make.
[02:50:58.630 --> 02:51:02.110]  And then other people take things and do different things
[02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:03.430]  and pick different plants.
[02:51:03.470 --> 02:51:08.470]  And I've definitely seen people bring stuff back to me
[02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:13.670]  that they made from seeds they got from me
[02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:16.550]  combined with other stuff or with my same stuff
[02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:21.550]  and seeing things that are super standout,
[02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:22.870]  or like if I would have read it,
[02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:24.990]  I would have been stoked I made it.
[02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:27.230]  Can you give an example of something?
[02:51:27.230 --> 02:51:28.510]  Because I feel like some stuff,
[02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:29.710]  maybe you're just like, yeah,
[02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:33.110]  that kind of smells, tastes, smokes like black lime
[02:51:33.790 --> 02:51:36.550]  or like what the original was that you got from me,
[02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:38.630]  but other stuff where you're like,
[02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:41.950]  I see like the next level of,
[02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:47.070]  you know, it's like in music when someone
[02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:49.150]  like take someone else's work
[02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:51.870]  and like create something entirely new and different.
[02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:55.070]  And the first person's like, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.910]  Yeah.
[02:51:56.830 --> 02:52:00.750]  Like when Big Youth made Hit the Road Jack.
[02:52:00.750 --> 02:52:02.110]  Did you ever hear that one?
[02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:07.990]  And I guess Ray Charles was like,
[02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:09.950]  well, that was the most inventive cover
[02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:12.750]  I've ever heard of anything right there, you know?
[02:52:12.750 --> 02:52:14.590]  Cause it was just a wild reggae song.
[02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:18.070]  And Big Youth is totally crazy.
[02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:21.190]  But yeah, no, I'm trying to think there was one
[02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:26.190]  that was like lime spill testa rosa or something.
[02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:29.150]  So it was like some aficionado stuff,
[02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:32.390]  some Emerald Mountain and some of mine.
[02:52:32.390 --> 02:52:35.070]  And I opened the jar and it was just like,
[02:52:35.070 --> 02:52:36.470]  bam, right in the face.
[02:52:36.470 --> 02:52:41.470]  Just like this really powerful fruity coffee skunk smell
[02:52:42.430 --> 02:52:46.190]  that was just like super, super powerful and really tasty.
[02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:47.790]  That was a really cool one.
[02:52:48.830 --> 02:52:51.230]  And I left the jar sitting around forever
[02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:53.830]  just so I could keep opening it up and smelling it.
[02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:58.710]  That one was cool.
[02:52:59.590 --> 02:53:04.590]  The lime-a-rilla that Brandon Russ did,
[02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:08.670]  I didn't know who he was or nothing.
[02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:13.670]  And he asked me for some seeds
[02:53:14.270 --> 02:53:15.830]  and I was like, oh, I'll give you some seeds.
[02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:18.550]  And he came by the booth at the Emerald Cup
[02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:20.590]  and he gave me a clone.
[02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:22.790]  And he was like, oh, this is that lime-a-rilla.
[02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:24.230]  And I'd seen pictures and I was like, wow,
[02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:27.030]  it's really cool because it kind of looks a little limey
[02:53:27.070 --> 02:53:29.910]  but it's got that gorilla glue frost on it,
[02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:32.190]  which is a great resin type.
[02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:33.550]  And so I was like, okay, cool.
[02:53:33.550 --> 02:53:35.830]  And I figured, you know, grow it and it no problem.
[02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:38.230]  Maybe it'll be kind of plain from the glue or something,
[02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:39.070]  but I don't know.
[02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:40.830]  He said it's pretty nasty.
[02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:43.190]  And when that ended up finishing, it was crazy
[02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:47.710]  because it was like the very best of the black lime reserves
[02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:52.150]  but then it just had glue resin all over it.
[02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:56.430]  So that was a standout thing that was like,
[02:53:56.430 --> 02:54:01.430]  okay, and then, you know,
[02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:05.830]  there's a bunch of people make a lot of stuff
[02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:09.070]  and, you know, it comes out cool.
[02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:10.830]  But those ones were like real standouts
[02:54:10.830 --> 02:54:13.030]  where I was like, damn, those are, you know,
[02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:15.150]  those were definitely like you could put those
[02:54:15.150 --> 02:54:16.750]  in competitions and they would,
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:20.670]  it'd be hard to not have them place somewhere, you know,
[02:54:20.670 --> 02:54:23.890]  in the top 10 or five or whatever and anywhere, I think.
[02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:28.190]  So yeah, I mean, those are cool.
[02:54:28.190 --> 02:54:30.470]  That's cool things like the lime is cool
[02:54:30.470 --> 02:54:32.910]  because the smell doesn't like to go away.
[02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:36.070]  So it winds up really nice.
[02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:40.410]  Nameless Genetics had, I gave my buddy a Lime Pop Kush.
[02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:46.390]  He put it back on a OG Kush cut, gave it to Nameless.
[02:54:46.390 --> 02:54:49.430]  They put it on Skittles and they called that Gummy Bear
[02:54:49.430 --> 02:54:52.030]  and that was really tasty.
[02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:57.740]  Hey, that's a baby.
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:54:59.100]  Don't let us distract you.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:01.820]  Yeah, those were cool.
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:04.620]  There's a lot of cool, a lot of different cool stuff.
[02:55:12.570 --> 02:55:16.530]  I'm on salad, shishito peppers and corn duty for dinner.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:27.080]  So by the way, when my wife has like Zoom meetings
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:28.640]  with all her work colleagues,
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:30.520]  if I were to ever like come in
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:32.440]  and just start babbling away to her,
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:34.200]  she'd tear my head off.
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:36.820]  But when I'm doing stuff, she'll be like,
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.940]  tell them it's because you're the boss.
[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:41.620]  That's right, it's because I'm, yeah,
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:43.660]  it's because I'm the boss of my one man shop.
[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:44.940]  And she works for people.
[02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:47.740]  And she works for a very big company.
[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:49.020]  It's because you're a pothead, dude.
[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:53.020]  You're just a lazy pothead doing pothead shit
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:54.940]  on the internet with a bunch of weed heads.
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:55.860]  Okay, water's boiling.
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:55:57.460]  I'm blowing your cover here, man.
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:00.580]  The corn, okay.
[02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:01.820]  I will do the corn.
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:02.660]  And the peppers.
[02:56:02.660 --> 02:56:03.980]  And the shishito peppers, yes.
[02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:05.460]  And the salad.
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:09.300]  Would anyone like to know my shishito pepper recipe?
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:12.340]  All right, my wife just said it.
[02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:16.480]  So I do shishito peppers and mostly olive oil,
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:19.340]  and then a splash of sesame oil.
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:22.140]  Then I do black sesame seeds.
[02:56:22.140 --> 02:56:24.140]  I do bonito flakes.
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:27.440]  And I do soy sauce.
[02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:29.180]  Nice.
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:31.300]  That's very good.
[02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:32.700]  Yeah, those are good.
[02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:34.300]  Tender.
[02:56:34.300 --> 02:56:35.860]  Yeah, no, I'm actually,
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:38.260]  so shishito peppers I'm gonna grow
[02:56:39.180 --> 02:56:42.880]  as my next pepper run in the garden.
[02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:45.500]  And speaking of gardens,
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:48.100]  what are you guys growing besides weed?
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:51.220]  I gotta figure it out, dude.
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:52.260]  I got a bunch of stuff.
[02:56:52.260 --> 02:56:56.040]  But somebody just handed me some cool Ethiopian peppers.
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:57.300]  I can't remember what they're called
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:00.060]  because they have an odd name and I'm not,
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:02.280]  once I grow them, I'll probably remember.
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.480]  I have a bunch of superhots that were given to me.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:10.960]  And my buddy T Beasle told me,
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:13.600]  he's like, dude, you gotta grow them under shade.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:15.320]  Because I was trying to grow things out in the sun.
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:16.280]  And I was like, what's wrong with them?
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:18.680]  And he goes, no, dude, they gotta grow in the shade.
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:22.360]  So I gotta put up shade cloth for them in my garden area.
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.600]  A couple types of tobacco,
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:27.840]  probably some pretty opium poppies.
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:28.680]  I got some birdhouse.
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:30.440]  We have to trade seed.
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:35.440]  So I have one, two different tobacco going right here.
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:42.320]  I gave Tyler from Family Tree a third one.
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:44.240]  Basically, I wanna grow out all these different ones
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.160]  and be like, what do I like the most for blunts
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:49.480]  or like other purposes?
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:53.640]  But like I can only grow one in one place
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:55.600]  because I don't want them to cross-pollinate.
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:00.600]  Yeah, I grew, you could too, if you wanted,
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:05.600]  you could bag the flowers
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:09.520]  to keep them from cross-pollinating them.
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.280]  And then you can uncover them.
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:13.640]  We'll uncover one when it's really flowering
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:18.640]  or you can also yank the flowers on one variety
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:23.000]  and then wait till they come back.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.880]  And then the other ones, once they've already set seed,
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:28.080]  make sure that you remove them after that.
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:30.440]  So you could very easily do two varieties.
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:33.080]  You could probably do four or five and not have a problem.
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:35.640]  You just have to keep thinking about,
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:37.200]  oh, this is what I gotta do.
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:39.760]  Don't have flowers at the same time setting seeds
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.700]  and you'd be fine.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:48.400]  I've done an increase on three different kinds
[02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:50.240]  over the last few years.
[02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:51.880]  So I have those.
[02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:54.240]  And so I'm gonna try a new one this year.
[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:55.680]  Bodie gave me some cool ones.
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:59:00.160]  He gave me one that came from a burial
[02:59:00.160 --> 02:59:02.040]  that they think is like a thousand years old,
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:04.280]  I think in British Columbia.
[02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:06.480]  And they found the seeds
[02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:09.120]  and they were basically had been frozen forever
[02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:11.320]  and they planted them and they made more
[02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:14.240]  and somebody circulated them and he got them
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:16.200]  and he gave me some of them.
[02:59:16.200 --> 02:59:19.440]  And so I wanna do those ones probably next
[02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:20.480]  because they're really interesting
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:23.080]  but I'll probably try a different kind too.
[02:59:23.080 --> 02:59:27.040]  And then I have some really cool opium poppies.
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.840]  I have some that get heads like this big.
[02:59:34.640 --> 02:59:37.040]  So just quickly on the tobacco,
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:40.120]  Alex says 20 feet apart for seed.
[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:43.120]  That surprised me that that's all you need.
[02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:44.240]  I mean, it depends.
[02:59:44.480 --> 02:59:49.480]  Yeah, I mean, the thing is if you're getting
[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:52.200]  insect pollination, it really comes down
[02:59:52.200 --> 02:59:54.880]  to how far are these insects traveling.
[02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:58.320]  I mean, at my house, the way it's set up,
[02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.680]  I see bees going hundreds of feet.
[03:00:00.680 --> 03:00:03.520]  So I would just go ahead and pop flowers
[03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:06.320]  because a lot of tobacco,
[03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:08.200]  it actually you'll get a lot more tobacco
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:10.920]  if you pop the flowers anyway.
[03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:13.240]  But as soon as you see them start to flower,
[03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:15.040]  just remove them and then you'll get
[03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:16.120]  a couple more branches.
[03:00:16.120 --> 03:00:18.760]  You'll get extra leaves on them.
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:23.200]  Don't take that advice for tobacco.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.160]  He was thinking peppers.
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:26.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:29.560]  For peppers, I'd say that'd be a lot easier
[03:00:29.560 --> 03:00:30.440]  because they don't have,
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:34.840]  their flowers are a lot less accessible, right?
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:36.520]  They're small little flowers.
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:41.520]  Tobacco has a nice little array of pollen
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:43.960]  sitting inside there.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:48.680]  Pepper flowers are a lot more delicate
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:50.480]  as far as how much pollen they have.
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:54.440]  You could be using some PBS bags
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:00:58.440]  to trap those buds so that flowers don't get pollinated.
[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:01.400]  Yeah, and with things, the cool thing,
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:06.360]  like with weed and some things that are wind pollinated,
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:10.320]  those bags are, you gotta have like the nicer bags like that
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:15.360]  but for insect pollinated things like tobacco,
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:18.440]  you could easily just make a screen bag
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:20.400]  and then it makes it really easy
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:22.960]  for the flowers to stay hella healthy.
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:25.480]  So you just basically put a bag on
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:29.880]  made out of something that can keep the bugs
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:32.160]  from going on them.
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:34.760]  But I would say with tobacco, yeah,
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:37.840]  just plant them, maybe plant them at different times
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:41.120]  and then remove the first flower set off of one
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:42.480]  and leave it on the other.
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:51.000]  I had tobacco too, I noticed it wanted to,
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.960]  you can keep them really small too.
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:57.960]  I did some like the bitter tobacco,
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:00.120]  the really strong shit.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:01.600]  And I had them in four inch pots
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:04.080]  and I didn't transplant them quite fast enough.
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:06.320]  And they flowered out when they were like this big
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:09.360]  and the leaves were really small like this
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:11.600]  and they should have been nice like this.
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:15.720]  And I got tons of seed and it just was this tiny
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:16.560]  little thing.
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.320]  So it's, you know, you, as far as from,
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:19.960]  cause tobacco you get one pond,
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:22.200]  you got, you know, 5,000 seeds or something.
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:24.160]  So you could definitely do,
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:26.160]  you could plant a bunch of varieties if you want
[03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:28.200]  and just think about while you're doing it,
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:29.600]  how it's going on.
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:33.480]  And you could even, you could have like with that one,
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:34.600]  I got two harvests.
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:35.560]  So I could have been,
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:38.000]  they could have been two different varieties
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.720]  and they were even a whole harvest apart from each other.
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:43.360]  Like it's almost like having a spring deck run
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.240]  and then having a full term run.
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:48.960]  Like I had already cut the tobacco seeds
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:50.720]  and then I had them grow back
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:53.200]  and I got a full tobacco plant to grow
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:55.760]  from the seeds that fell out on accident
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:59.120]  after I'd already harvested my seeds in the four inch pots.
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:01.720]  And then that plant grew in the ground and got really big.
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:06.600]  So you could definitely, you know, pop a few things
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:08.800]  and then just make sure they're not,
[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:10.680]  the flowers aren't set at the same time.
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:12.120]  I do that.
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:13.640]  Yeah, the PBS bags.
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:16.120]  This is the shaman Tibetan.
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:18.520]  So the first tobacco I ever did was the shaman,
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:19.840]  but it's not like it's something
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:23.160]  that I would actually smoke, right?
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:25.760]  But you get a ton, you get a,
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:27.460]  I'll smoke it right now on camera.
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.880]  You get a ton of seeds.
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:34.760]  I mean, it's insane how many of these pods they throw off.
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:37.400]  Yeah, so much dude.
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:38.240]  Yeah.
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:42.520]  But yeah, I have the one that's like that,
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:47.520]  the roll blunts of homebrew and tobacco.
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:50.240]  Yeah, I mean, you can totally do it.
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:53.440]  It's really a learning process to be able to dry it right.
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:56.960]  You want it to spoil without it molding.
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:00.000]  So that's a little bit tricky, but it's not too hard.
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:05.080]  And one trick to doing it is to just keep it
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:08.160]  for a really long time, really good tobacco.
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:10.600]  A lot of times is two or three years old.
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:15.520]  So like, you know, it naturally,
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:19.160]  if you just keep it a little bit moist for a couple of years
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:20.960]  it usually will come out really nice
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:23.760]  and have that good color for it.
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:28.760]  But, you know, like they tend to like moisten tobacco
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:31.040]  whether you do it with like a humidifier
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:34.960]  or like a pump sprayer or a spray bottle or whatever.
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:37.560]  You want it to be like wet, dry, wet, dry, wet, dry
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:41.360]  or just a little bit too wet for a long period of time.
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:42.480]  And that's how you get it.
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:45.200]  It's the same process that you would use
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:48.040]  to completely ruin your weed and turn it brown
[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:49.640]  is what you want to do to tobacco.
[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:52.120]  Cause you need the chlorophyll to break down.
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:55.120]  But yeah, once you get it nice, you can roll blunts.
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.160]  I actually like to smoke tobacco.
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:04:59.840]  Blunts don't have enough tobacco for me
[03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:01.520]  because I like to get really fucked up
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:03.240]  when I smoke tobacco.
[03:05:03.240 --> 03:05:05.800]  So I don't just want to like smoke tobacco
[03:05:05.800 --> 03:05:08.320]  and be like, oh yeah, it's a little bit different.
[03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:10.720]  I like, I actually like to take the tobacco
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:14.520]  and slice it up fine, like shag tobacco.
[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:19.160]  And then I mix it with weed and roll a joint out of it
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:21.160]  and then hit it like that
[03:05:21.160 --> 03:05:24.480]  or put it in a chillum with like some hash
[03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:25.760]  and smoke it like that.
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:28.320]  Cause like when, if like, I don't like the whole-
[03:05:28.320 --> 03:05:29.800]  But you like a lot of tobacco?
[03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:32.240]  Like you like the nicotine just hitting you?
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:34.680]  Yeah, I don't, cause I don't like to,
[03:05:34.680 --> 03:05:36.640]  I don't want to smoke tobacco
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:39.280]  and have it be like a mild habit
[03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:41.560]  where it's just like, yeah, I like some tobacco,
[03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:43.400]  tobacco all the time.
[03:05:43.400 --> 03:05:46.000]  I want to like smoke it here and there.
[03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  And when I smoke it, just be like, oh, fuck am I?
[03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:52.800]  And like, just at that point,
[03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:55.680]  I don't quite want to like get sick from it,
[03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:57.560]  but I want to be like to the point where I'm like,
[03:05:57.560 --> 03:06:00.360]  yeah, this was almost a bad idea.
[03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:03.000]  You know, like I like to get that like roller coaster
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.600]  from the tobacco.
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:07.080]  And the nicotine itself is cool
[03:06:07.080 --> 03:06:09.360]  because it gives, it has a lot of cool effects.
[03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:11.680]  So I don't have to smoke it like that,
[03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:14.120]  but like I just always find with blunts,
[03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:16.440]  it's almost like, it's for me,
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:19.720]  it's almost like drinking alcohol that's only 2%.
[03:06:19.720 --> 03:06:23.480]  You're just like, well, here it is, it's going in my body.
[03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:26.800]  That's like almost maybe something's happening, I think,
[03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:29.040]  but like, yeah, cool.
[03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:33.800]  But I like to more like smoke it and be like, oh shit.
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:35.560]  You know, like I like that.
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:39.520]  I like the heavy, heavy high from it more.
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:42.680]  I've had so many just horrible experience.
[03:06:42.680 --> 03:06:46.400]  Like when I lived in, I lived in France for two years
[03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:51.400]  and just coming from like bong rips of flour
[03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:55.440]  to like hash tobacco combinations,
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:06:59.280]  I just like total illness.
[03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:00.840]  Like so many nights,
[03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:04.840]  like I've had so many more nights smoking hash
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:09.080]  with tobacco where like I was conscious,
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:12.840]  but I couldn't move any part of my body.
[03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:17.840]  And yeah, the tobacco weed, like I like it,
[03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:20.640]  but when I was first in,
[03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:23.960]  like I think the first time was like 15, 16 years old
[03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:26.040]  and you're just like, oh.
[03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:27.920]  It's a really fine line, dude.
[03:07:27.920 --> 03:07:29.960]  And that's the thing is I like to go,
[03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:32.200]  I like to get up there to, you know,
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:35.960]  I don't wanna go to 11, but I wanna go to like seven or eight
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:38.400]  I don't wanna be at two or three, you know,
[03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:40.800]  which are blunt for me is like,
[03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:42.600]  it's like two or three or four.
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:45.800]  I'm like, okay, I can tell there's nicotine there,
[03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:49.080]  but it's not really quite doing it.
[03:07:49.080 --> 03:07:52.320]  And then, you know, it's just that,
[03:07:52.320 --> 03:07:54.960]  there's just that thing.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:57.800]  So what I figured out though,
[03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:02.520]  is that if I smoke it fairly often,
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:07.160]  the only way that it still really affects me
[03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:09.200]  is with the right weed.
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:14.000]  And those kinds of weed tend to be kind of head rushy anyway.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:18.600]  And so like the potency of weed,
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:23.400]  I'm like, if it really hits with tobacco,
[03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:25.880]  then I'm like, okay, this shit hits.
[03:08:25.880 --> 03:08:27.600]  Because if I take something more mild,
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:29.960]  like if you take like a type two
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:34.120]  with like quite a bit of CBD and you smoke it by itself,
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:37.000]  and you're like, cool, I'm stoned, this is nice, you know,
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:38.480]  and you roll it with tobacco,
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:40.560]  you're just like, this is just not,
[03:08:40.560 --> 03:08:42.520]  it's like kind of like smoking a blunt.
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:46.840]  And then if you take something that's really, really
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:51.840]  like straight, like whatever, like sour diesel or whatever,
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:54.160]  that goes straight to your forehead,
[03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:56.400]  and then you smoke that with the nicotine,
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:08:57.680]  that's where you get the feel.
[03:08:57.680 --> 03:09:00.880]  Because like tobacco by itself, I don't really like,
[03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:03.560]  and the wrong weed with tobacco, I don't like either.
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:04.960]  I'll light it and I'll put it out.
[03:09:04.960 --> 03:09:06.120]  But when it's the right thing,
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:07.600]  there's this certain thing that happens.
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:11.240]  And that's like the lime, the root beer,
[03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:16.240]  all the Jaro, OG, sour, there's certain things
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:20.560]  that when I smoke it, I'm like, okay, that's the effect.
[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:23.000]  And it's a certain thing that I'm going for, you know?
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.040]  So like, it's not like anybody can go,
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:27.880]  oh, Gene said, take tobacco and weed and smoke it.
[03:09:27.880 --> 03:09:29.880]  And you might, you'll be like, this fucking sucks.
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:32.680]  But like, if you can smoke like lime one
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:37.480]  with natural tobacco and have like the right mix
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:41.000]  and smoke it like at the right time, the vibe is insane.
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:44.800]  Like you just get this such a, this high that you just,
[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:47.280]  it's just straight euphoria, you know?
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:49.040]  But you don't wanna go past euphoria
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:50.760]  and turn green and wanna throw up.
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:52.280]  So it's just, you know.
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:55.040]  This is just bringing memories, like high school memories.
[03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:58.240]  So I played on, I was playing hockey in France
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.720]  and we'd, you know, I lived in Rennes,
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:04.120]  which is the capital of Brittany.
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:06.000]  And we'd like, you know, have an away game
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:07.920]  and not or breast or something.
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:12.240]  And so like, as the one American, like we'd get on the bus
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:14.840]  and like, as soon as we got off the bus,
[03:10:14.840 --> 03:10:18.000]  all the French dudes would like chain smoke a cigarette.
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:21.640]  Between periods, they'd chain smoke cigarettes.
[03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:23.840]  And then I partied with them all.
[03:10:23.840 --> 03:10:28.840]  And for some reason, the family I lived
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:30.880]  with the French mother, like,
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:34.800]  she loved me going out and having fun.
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:37.680]  So I was like 15, 16 years old.
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.240]  And if it was like a Saturday night and I wasn't going out,
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:41.720]  she'd be like, what's wrong?
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:42.640]  Like, are you a loser?
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:43.720]  Like, you don't wanna go out tonight?
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:45.080]  I'd be like, okay, I'll go.
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:49.800]  And she would come pick me up at four in the morning
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:53.480]  and all my friends, and she would drop everybody off
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:56.200]  like at their respective houses.
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:11:00.120]  And all we were smoking was like hash and tobacco
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:04.880]  in these long, narrow French bars with like no ventilation.
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:06.320]  So you'd be like in the back of a bar
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:09.400]  where every single person in that bar was smoking.
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:13.360]  And I just remember like,
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:15.120]  I'd have like friends throwing up
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:16.600]  outside the backseat of the car
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:18.440]  and my like French mother, you know,
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:23.440]  in the Citroen driving everyone home, dropping people off.
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:27.240]  It was good memories.
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:30.880]  But yeah, that was my first kind of like
[03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:34.480]  hash tobacco experiences.
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:36.600]  Yeah, tobacco too.
[03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:40.800]  I can't be, I can't be like, if I smoke it,
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:42.280]  I have to be outside.
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:45.800]  I do not want the smoke coming back at me
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:48.800]  that I blew out or that someone else blew out.
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:50.560]  I don't wanna be anywhere near it.
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:52.480]  Like I fucking hate it.
[03:11:52.480 --> 03:11:56.160]  So like I only smoke it outside where there's a lot of air
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:58.440]  and even like the high that it gives me
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:01.000]  when I get really overwhelmed is like,
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  it's just like any like,
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:07.240]  the air has to be like nice and crisp and fresh
[03:12:07.240 --> 03:12:10.440]  and circulating because of that way that that high is,
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:12.440]  you know, I can't like,
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:15.400]  if I was smoking in like one of those places
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:17.520]  you're talking about and it's all smoky and shit,
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:20.160]  I'd be like, I'd fucking hate it.
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:22.880]  I just love the, there's something about it.
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:27.880]  And like, it's weird because it's such a brain stimulant
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  that like, I used to really like to sit by myself.
[03:12:33.080 --> 03:12:37.560]  And like, if I would smoke like with other people,
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:40.920]  I wouldn't get any of really the high that I was going for.
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:41.920]  I only kind of got it
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:44.520]  when I was standing somewhere by myself.
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:48.000]  And then I would get this like real cool thing
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:49.960]  where all this stuff would happen in my head.
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:52.200]  And I would like think about these different plants
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:55.440]  or this different music or whatever it was at the time.
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:57.240]  And I'd get like these cool ideas
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:59.320]  and it was just like very,
[03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:03.000]  like a really cool like meditation, you know?
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.920]  And I don't smoke really tobacco at all.
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:08.880]  Every once in a while, I'll take some of my own tobacco
[03:13:08.880 --> 03:13:11.880]  and I'll take it to, you know,
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:15.120]  to like the ocean or to the river or whatever.
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:18.720]  And probably only maybe, I don't know, a few times a year.
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:20.680]  And then, you know, I'll hit it.
[03:13:20.680 --> 03:13:23.440]  And most of the time I'll be like,
[03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:26.280]  okay, this is almost a little bit too much
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:29.880]  because I'm not actually a tobacco smoker in any sense now,
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:32.320]  you know, and it'll be kind of overwhelming.
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:34.720]  But then I'll get that really nice thing
[03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:37.640]  where it evens out and it like rounds out
[03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:38.480]  the high of the weed.
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:39.840]  The weed's never sleepy.
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:42.240]  It always makes the weed more cerebral.
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:44.160]  And I don't know, I like it.
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:46.520]  I don't recommend anybody smokes tobacco.
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:49.440]  I think like it can be super harmful,
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:53.320]  but I think it's probably not as harmful smoked like that
[03:13:53.320 --> 03:13:56.000]  than is when you just, you smoke it all the time.
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:58.240]  And like the natives here in California,
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:01.360]  when people first really tried to document it
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:04.160]  and ask them about like how they did it,
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:07.560]  they were like, ah, we'll keep like some around.
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:11.640]  And at the most we'll smoke it maybe a few times a day,
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:13.880]  a few good puffs of it.
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:15.440]  And if you do more than that,
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:17.960]  then you'll start to kind of get sick from it.
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:19.360]  But they would use it for a medicine
[03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:22.680]  when people would get like chest congestion or fevers
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:26.360]  or coughs and all that kind of stuff.
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:28.880]  They would actually be like a medicine man
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:29.720]  would actually like,
[03:14:29.720 --> 03:14:32.360]  the someone they have like these giant pipes
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:35.280]  where they would actually like put tons of tobacco in it
[03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:37.960]  and get it all going and like have tons of smoke.
[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:40.640]  And then they'd like blow the smoke in people's faces
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:41.800]  and have them breathe it.
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.320]  And like they had whole like healing rituals
[03:14:45.320 --> 03:14:46.720]  that were all tobacco based.
[03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:50.400]  And for them, they said it was really effective.
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:51.240]  It's really a good thing.
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:52.160]  And is there like a funky old thing
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:54.560]  where it like opens things up or something?
[03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.400]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:58.920]  You know, it's hard to know all that stuff
[03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:01.720]  and it's hard to know exactly what varieties they had
[03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:03.760]  and what kind of different stuff they had.
[03:15:03.760 --> 03:15:08.160]  Like there was a Hopi tobacco that my buddy grew
[03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:12.000]  and I gave some of them, I think to Stray Mindset
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:13.400]  and maybe to Bodhi.
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:16.400]  But when it finished, it had this resin,
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:18.000]  tobacco has a lot of resin.
[03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:22.000]  And this one had resin that smelled like grapefruit peel.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:25.800]  And it was so different than any tobacco I've ever smelled
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:29.140]  that I was like, well, this one could easily be good
[03:15:29.140 --> 03:15:31.400]  for something that all these other tobaccos
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:32.760]  are not good for.
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:35.320]  So we don't really know like with the natives
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:38.000]  who were focusing on different medicinal aspects,
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.240]  they might've been like, no, like this one is for this
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:42.440]  and that one's for that.
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:45.520]  And, you know, fucking people showed up
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:48.660]  and fucked everything up and destroyed so much,
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:52.920]  you know, of all the information and everything.
[03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:56.880]  And a lot of the most knowledgeable people were wiped out.
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:15:59.520]  So, you know, you have to wonder like, okay,
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:01.480]  well maybe these were even different plants
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:03.760]  than what we're seeing now.
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:05.880]  They could have been totally different, you know?
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:07.200]  Those are spiritual plants.
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:09.920]  So, you know, conquerors show up and they're like,
[03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:11.280]  oh, what do you guys worship?
[03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:13.540]  Well, we're gonna fucking get rid of all of that shit
[03:16:13.580 --> 03:16:16.540]  because we want you to fucking, you know,
[03:16:16.540 --> 03:16:18.660]  pray to this and do this and do that.
[03:16:18.660 --> 03:16:22.260]  And, you know, so there could be a lot of-
[03:16:22.260 --> 03:16:24.940]  There is a plant I was just reading about
[03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:27.540]  that that happened to,
[03:16:27.540 --> 03:16:30.860]  is like something that people in the Americas
[03:16:30.860 --> 03:16:34.340]  grew a lot of and it's like super nutritious
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:38.100]  and like the Spanish just tried to eradicate it.
[03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:39.700]  And I'm totally blanking on what it is.
[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:43.420]  It has like super long flowers that are like red
[03:16:44.420 --> 03:16:49.340]  and maybe someone in the chat can help out.
[03:16:49.340 --> 03:16:51.900]  So, Chatterbot, he says,
[03:16:51.900 --> 03:16:55.640]  I always envision Europeans partying like Clockwork Orange.
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:16:57.940]  That's the Brits.
[03:16:58.780 --> 03:17:02.480]  But I think Europeans party more like Barry Lyndon.
[03:17:05.820 --> 03:17:08.380]  So, of the Stanley Kubrick movies,
[03:17:09.380 --> 03:17:12.100]  what's your, which one have you watched the most?
[03:17:18.090 --> 03:17:18.930]  Asking us?
[03:17:18.930 --> 03:17:20.490]  Am I the only, yeah.
[03:17:20.490 --> 03:17:23.050]  Or am I the only one who's watched a lot of,
[03:17:23.050 --> 03:17:24.810]  Barry Lyndon and Clockwork Orange
[03:17:24.810 --> 03:17:26.810]  are probably the two I've watched the most.
[03:17:28.770 --> 03:17:29.610]  I've never really-
[03:17:29.610 --> 03:17:32.250]  Yeah, I've only seen Clockwork Orange myself.
[03:17:32.250 --> 03:17:34.330]  Yeah, I mean, I saw Clockwork Orange
[03:17:34.330 --> 03:17:36.450]  when I was a kid a couple of times.
[03:17:40.090 --> 03:17:41.830]  What other movies?
[03:17:42.890 --> 03:17:44.450]  I liked the Moon Landing.
[03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:46.930]  Space Odyssey, yeah.
[03:17:47.770 --> 03:17:48.890]  The Moon Landing was good.
[03:17:50.370 --> 03:17:51.210]  Just kidding.
[03:17:51.210 --> 03:17:53.130]  People tried to say you made that, right?
[03:17:54.090 --> 03:17:57.250]  Everybody's homework assignment is to go watch Barry Lyndon
[03:17:57.250 --> 03:18:01.570]  and let me know if it's as awesome as I think it is.
[03:18:01.570 --> 03:18:03.370]  Doctor Strange Love, I've seen that.
[03:18:03.370 --> 03:18:04.850]  Yeah, Doctor Strange Love.
[03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:09.310]  Yeah, Full Metal Jacket,
[03:18:09.310 --> 03:18:11.110]  actually I've watched that a lot too.
[03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:12.670]  That's the one I've seen the most.
[03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:14.670]  I've seen that movie a lot.
[03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:16.310]  Vincent D'Onofrio.
[03:18:16.310 --> 03:18:17.150]  That's what I was trying to remember.
[03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:19.390]  I was gonna say Trippy when I think he was on like
[03:18:19.390 --> 03:18:22.790]  NYPD Blue or something like that.
[03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:26.350]  And it was like the same dude like 25 years later
[03:18:26.350 --> 03:18:28.390]  and looking a lot different.
[03:18:28.390 --> 03:18:31.190]  I didn't realize it was the dude from Full Metal Jacket.
[03:18:33.230 --> 03:18:35.190]  The Shining, Full Metal Jacket.
[03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:36.030]  That's your major malfunction.
[03:18:36.030 --> 03:18:37.030]  I've seen those a lot.
[03:18:39.780 --> 03:18:41.580]  Yeah, was it Amaranth?
[03:18:44.380 --> 03:18:48.340]  Yeah, I think Amaranth was the plant I was talking about.
[03:18:53.380 --> 03:18:55.700]  That the Europeans tried to eradicate.
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:58.100]  Now it wasn't quinoa, I think it was Amaranth.
[03:19:00.620 --> 03:19:02.420]  So I'm just looking through the chat.
[03:19:04.260 --> 03:19:05.380]  All right.
[03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:08.500]  Oh yeah, sorry, everyone's saying Amaranth as I scroll up.
[03:19:11.340 --> 03:19:14.420]  All right, well before my wife tears my head off
[03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:17.220]  for not cooking dinner.
[03:19:17.220 --> 03:19:18.420]  I gotta make dinner too.
[03:19:18.820 --> 03:19:21.540]  But I appreciate, now I think that was awesome.
[03:19:21.540 --> 03:19:26.540]  I mean, I love like that dude deserves
[03:19:27.700 --> 03:19:32.700]  everybody's respect and love.
[03:19:33.380 --> 03:19:37.860]  And I appreciate the two of you for jumping on with him
[03:19:37.860 --> 03:19:42.860]  and letting, making sure everybody pays attention to him.
[03:19:43.060 --> 03:19:46.540]  Man, no problem, he definitely deserves that respect
[03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:49.100]  that a lot of people probably don't even know
[03:19:49.100 --> 03:19:50.900]  about offering him.
[03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:53.900]  So yeah, appreciate letting us come on and helping him.
[03:19:55.420 --> 03:20:04.260]  So with that, yeah, I wanna grow some Amaranth.
[03:20:04.300 --> 03:20:11.190]  So just quickly, like I have a ton of catnip
[03:20:11.190 --> 03:20:15.190]  because we did a show where this,
[03:20:15.190 --> 03:20:17.110]  like a lot of people were talking about
[03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:21.390]  this like organic chemist talked about how catnip
[03:20:21.390 --> 03:20:26.390]  actually is a super IPM, like pests hate it.
[03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:31.870]  And I have some Romanesco broccoli over there,
[03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:38.150]  some black sesame.
[03:20:40.390 --> 03:20:41.670]  That's all the stuff right here.
[03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:46.670]  But anyway, I like talking about vegetables too.
[03:20:50.340 --> 03:20:51.700]  So with that.
[03:20:53.860 --> 03:20:56.340]  Yeah, I got a collection of stuff
[03:20:56.340 --> 03:20:59.260]  and my nursery has killer heirloom stuff,
[03:20:59.260 --> 03:21:01.940]  a couple of big racks from local seed companies.
[03:21:01.940 --> 03:21:03.940]  It's cool because I can buy them and get stuff
[03:21:03.940 --> 03:21:06.240]  that I know does good right here in my valley.
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:12.860]  But I was bummed at the Emerald Cup,
[03:21:13.180 --> 03:21:16.380]  Nick from Green Source was gonna give me
[03:21:16.380 --> 03:21:17.740]  a bunch of vegetable seeds.
[03:21:17.780 --> 03:21:22.220]  And then I like walked away and forgot to come back.
[03:21:22.220 --> 03:21:26.740]  And I was like, I'd be psyched to start playing
[03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:30.260]  with people's different stuff, especially someone like him.
[03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:32.140]  Yeah.
[03:21:34.140 --> 03:21:35.580]  Yeah, it's fun.
[03:21:35.580 --> 03:21:37.780]  I didn't harvest a lot from my garden last year.
[03:21:37.780 --> 03:21:40.620]  I had a huge ground squirrel problem early out
[03:21:40.620 --> 03:21:42.340]  until they kind of left stuff alone.
[03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:45.420]  But I still had plenty of stuff,
[03:21:45.420 --> 03:21:49.060]  but it was just nice to just have different plants.
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:51.980]  And it's fun, every different kind of plant.
[03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:55.300]  And just like when they set flowers and then they set fruit
[03:21:55.300 --> 03:21:58.540]  and then things ripen and you have them healthy,
[03:21:58.540 --> 03:22:00.420]  like it's like a huge achievement.
[03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:04.220]  Every time it's a different species or variety
[03:22:04.220 --> 03:22:06.060]  and you actually pull some shit off of it,
[03:22:06.060 --> 03:22:07.340]  you're like, hey, I did it.
[03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:09.540]  Because you don't always, if you try enough,
[03:22:09.540 --> 03:22:11.020]  you're like, some of these things don't work.
[03:22:11.020 --> 03:22:12.820]  You don't get anything.
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:13.740]  You gotta learn.
[03:22:13.780 --> 03:22:17.860]  You find out like, oh, tomatoes need a lot of calcium
[03:22:17.860 --> 03:22:19.300]  or whatever it is.
[03:22:19.300 --> 03:22:20.580]  There's a lot of stuff to,
[03:22:20.580 --> 03:22:23.260]  or superhots don't like the sun.
[03:22:23.260 --> 03:22:24.220]  I didn't know that.
[03:22:28.620 --> 03:22:30.620]  Yeah, no, that when you were saying that, I was like,
[03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:33.860]  damn, what do I have growing that is in the sun
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:36.340]  that should probably be in the shade?
[03:22:36.340 --> 03:22:37.420]  Yeah, you never know.
[03:22:37.420 --> 03:22:40.700]  You have to talk to someone with experience
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:43.540]  that has had success with doing different stuff.
[03:22:43.980 --> 03:22:47.180]  I'm sure in some places they probably do like the sun
[03:22:47.180 --> 03:22:48.980]  because it's higher humidity or whatever,
[03:22:48.980 --> 03:22:51.100]  but in the summertime where I'm at,
[03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:53.780]  it's like a desert in my veggie garden.
[03:22:53.780 --> 03:22:58.460]  And so it's really stressful for certain things
[03:22:58.460 --> 03:22:59.380]  and other things love it.
[03:22:59.380 --> 03:23:02.380]  Tomatoes love it because they're just like, oh,
[03:23:02.380 --> 03:23:03.340]  they're so easy to grow.
[03:23:03.340 --> 03:23:07.500]  But the superhots, I was just like,
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:11.180]  goddammit, I was just missing.
[03:23:11.180 --> 03:23:12.140]  And now I know why.
[03:23:13.140 --> 03:23:15.420]  Yeah, there's someone I've been talking to,
[03:23:15.420 --> 03:23:20.420]  I think in Instagram DMs, but who is a beer brewer
[03:23:20.540 --> 03:23:23.300]  and deals with hops and different hop varietals.
[03:23:23.300 --> 03:23:26.540]  And I was like, dude, I'd love to just listen to you
[03:23:26.540 --> 03:23:29.900]  and other hop experts drop knowledge on like,
[03:23:30.940 --> 03:23:33.340]  what's the state of the union on hop breeding
[03:23:33.340 --> 03:23:38.340]  and the hop market and what you guys are all excited about.
[03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:43.460]  And, okay, because I feel like in the past like five years,
[03:23:43.460 --> 03:23:48.460]  there's just been an explosion of like beer flavor, I guess.
[03:23:48.860 --> 03:23:51.460]  It's like weed breeding right now, yeah.
[03:23:51.460 --> 03:23:54.980]  Yeah, so, and I appreciate that.
[03:23:56.540 --> 03:24:00.780]  With the six pack I drink almost every day,
[03:24:00.780 --> 03:24:01.980]  I appreciate that.
[03:24:03.660 --> 03:24:06.020]  So, all right, well with that,
[03:24:06.060 --> 03:24:09.620]  let's all get to dinner making as Chad Westport said,
[03:24:09.620 --> 03:24:11.460]  happy 620 y'all.
[03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:15.140]  And let's end on that.
