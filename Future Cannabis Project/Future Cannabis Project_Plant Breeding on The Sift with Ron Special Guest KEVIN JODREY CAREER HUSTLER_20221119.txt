[00:31.610 --> 00:40.810]  Well, here we are for another week. We've got Kevin Jodri on today. I don't think you got everybody's got to know him
[00:40.810 --> 00:47.570]  He's been around like longer than almost as long as Jesus and so it's gonna be great to talk to him
[00:48.250 --> 00:51.730]  Hopefully we can get him on it. Just a second. Bring him on
[00:52.730 --> 00:54.730]  There yet. Hi Kev
[00:55.210 --> 01:01.090]  Hey Ron, how you doing? Good. It's wonderful to have you on I've been looking forward to this chat for some time
[01:02.090 --> 01:07.390]  Why don't you just give us like a little bit about yourself? Everybody knows you but
[01:07.970 --> 01:14.690]  Just give us a little shout out about what yourself what you're up to now and then and then we'll just kick her around wherever it goes
[01:16.370 --> 01:22.210]  Gosh, I've been in cannabis for I don't know four decades plus and
[01:24.130 --> 01:26.130]  I'm involved in a
[01:26.490 --> 01:29.450]  tremendous variety of different things both
[01:30.210 --> 01:34.090]  In cultivation aspects breeding aspects
[01:36.010 --> 01:40.370]  Manufacturing processing distribution international movement of products
[01:41.010 --> 01:42.090]  I
[01:42.090 --> 01:44.090]  Just try to stay busy. You know, I
[01:44.610 --> 01:50.850]  got into something when I was a kid that I just absolutely loved and I get to spend my whole life doing it and
[01:51.290 --> 01:53.850]  It's just been really a pretty interesting adventure
[01:54.730 --> 01:58.490]  Wonderful, yeah. Yeah, I've really enjoyed I love growing plants
[01:58.490 --> 02:01.890]  I love the plant and pay a lot of attention to genetics
[02:01.890 --> 02:04.650]  That's kind of what when I came up with the show idea
[02:04.650 --> 02:10.650]  It was about a sift because I've kind of got a knack of choosing the right plant and I know a few other people that
[02:10.650 --> 02:12.650]  Have a knack of choosing the plant
[02:13.410 --> 02:20.170]  Jackson I've seen the some of the root beers and stuff that they've been working on and it's I've seen I've been blessed in my
[02:20.210 --> 02:25.130]  Lifetime to see a lot of genetics pass through and I'm sure you have to people giving you stuff and
[02:25.370 --> 02:30.290]  What from the bag seed back in the day? I got stuff that goes back to a tie stick. I got in the
[02:31.450 --> 02:33.090]  second year of 1980s
[02:33.090 --> 02:38.090]  so I got I got some old stuff that I keep alive and I've just kept it alive because I'm just a
[02:38.490 --> 02:41.130]  Curious guy and I and I had it before
[02:41.650 --> 02:43.770]  genetics was like a big deal and now
[02:44.410 --> 02:46.410]  genetics is a big deal and
[02:46.770 --> 02:49.610]  And now they're going into washing and all of that other stuff
[02:50.170 --> 02:56.750]  How are you in the in the genetics game? I know that you're doing the gonji a thing, which is wonderful
[02:56.750 --> 02:59.530]  I've met a few of the people that have come through your your
[03:00.370 --> 03:01.730]  tutelage and
[03:01.730 --> 03:07.930]  What do you what do you what's the pulse of the of the breeding game here in this in this market?
[03:08.890 --> 03:14.970]  Well, it's the well what market right? So you got you got your license market and you have your own license market
[03:15.370 --> 03:17.170]  And so
[03:17.170 --> 03:22.410]  there are two different directions license market requires a specific COA the
[03:23.330 --> 03:26.330]  The numbers have to line up or distro won't touch it
[03:26.970 --> 03:28.810]  certain
[03:28.810 --> 03:32.150]  Visual features have to be present or they don't want to sell it
[03:32.450 --> 03:38.650]  So if you're if you're breeding for the license market, you have some parameters you have to work within
[03:39.490 --> 03:43.850]  And if you're working within the unlicensed market the parameters are really is it good?
[03:44.730 --> 03:50.290]  And so if there's two different directions and I I work in both of them in the sense that a
[03:51.130 --> 03:54.490]  lot of the stuff that I do professionally as I work with a
[03:55.050 --> 04:00.730]  Large genomic groups. So I mean historically I've been involved in moving G. I'd move jeans for a long time
[04:00.730 --> 04:05.570]  And I think I'm most known for really like wonderland nursery where we were the first
[04:06.130 --> 04:12.730]  Like vertical nursery in the country where you walked into a dispensary and the dispensaries only function was a nursery
[04:13.050 --> 04:18.450]  right and what we did is we did something different where I tied into rivers of breeders and
[04:18.610 --> 04:21.570]  We became really like their first outlet for seeds
[04:21.570 --> 04:25.990]  And so there was a period of time where I was the largest seed dealer in the state of, California
[04:25.990 --> 04:28.190]  And what we did is we took the breeders
[04:28.450 --> 04:33.410]  We would have them select plants from their populations or they would have me select plants from their
[04:33.610 --> 04:39.370]  populations that I thought reflected the the best of their work and we would put that clone into production and
[04:40.290 --> 04:41.250]  Over the you know
[04:41.250 --> 04:46.930]  The lifetime of wonderland that five years it was probably well over a billion dollars in flowers sold that came from seed
[04:47.050 --> 04:53.370]  not grown by us so our impact around the United States the world was massive when you got right down to it and
[04:54.610 --> 04:58.490]  What it did though was it allowed these smaller operators that didn't have
[04:59.050 --> 05:05.610]  The ability to promote to the same degree it let them get their their clones into the system
[05:05.650 --> 05:11.890]  Which then subsequently drove the attention back to them as seed breeders because I didn't call it
[05:11.890 --> 05:16.190]  You know Kev's thing it was being selected by me
[05:16.190 --> 05:20.370]  Which means that I said hey this thing has a quality in the market that I think will work
[05:20.370 --> 05:24.410]  And I'm known as someone who's a good selector as well. My
[05:25.410 --> 05:29.530]  Standing of the market and that the target audience has been on point for a really long time
[05:29.530 --> 05:33.730]  So it allows it allows us to work together in a really neat way
[05:34.650 --> 05:40.850]  So if it's for the licensed operations, we're able to work and develop if it's been non licensed home grows
[05:40.850 --> 05:42.730]  Which is what my favorite thing is
[05:42.730 --> 05:48.610]  it's it's about trying to get people to get excited about cultivation and propagation and
[05:48.970 --> 05:55.330]  Breeding and and the ability to network and share genes and work collaboratively around the world because to me all all
[05:55.690 --> 06:02.010]  cultivators regardless of scale are the same and and I I just dig it because the
[06:02.250 --> 06:05.450]  Ability to be part of that in that regard is just awesome
[06:05.690 --> 06:13.010]  Yeah, the retail the retail market for that for like the home grower is quite as just light years
[06:13.090 --> 06:20.270]  different than what it is for the commercial market because like they're growing a couple of my cultivars at an LP here and they
[06:20.290 --> 06:21.690]  They're growing them. They're selling good
[06:21.690 --> 06:26.770]  But these are all seven and a half eight week strains that finish like right on the money at eight weeks
[06:26.770 --> 06:32.690]  They produce the right stuff, you know, they got nice stems nice everything and no one will go over eight weeks
[06:32.690 --> 06:37.330]  You know and it's got to have the numbers that that are you know, well over 20
[06:37.930 --> 06:42.910]  And people would you know, they want the the really hard stuff, you know
[06:42.910 --> 06:45.210]  They're in the and they want it to finish fast
[06:45.370 --> 06:51.550]  But a home grower if they're growing for Hayes for a Hayes that takes 10 11 12 13 weeks
[06:51.730 --> 06:53.970]  You know a home grower can put up with that
[06:57.170 --> 07:00.130]  I'm growing Grimmspoon right now just out of a
[07:00.850 --> 07:06.650]  Just curiosity, you know because I enjoy we grew it and I enjoyed the smell but we didn't wait till it finished
[07:06.650 --> 07:10.090]  We just chopped and threw it out of the way because it's like who's gonna wait that long
[07:10.130 --> 07:14.930]  So I figured I'm gonna grow it now properly once just to just to grow it all out
[07:14.930 --> 07:17.090]  and I'll grow it out as long as it takes but
[07:17.850 --> 07:24.330]  The for a home guy like we got some stuff that is so crystally and everything but it takes too long to finish
[07:24.330 --> 07:26.730]  So that's the only place it can go as a home grow
[07:26.890 --> 07:31.650]  Unless you want to cross it up with other stuff that you can get it and finish in a reasonable time
[07:31.650 --> 07:32.890]  They might go nine weeks
[07:32.890 --> 07:37.770]  But you're not going to get an LP to put that kind of time because of the dollars and cents it cost
[07:37.890 --> 07:39.890]  Just to keep the lights on
[07:39.890 --> 07:41.890]  Yeah, well, it's also
[07:42.010 --> 07:44.010]  the problem with what
[07:44.290 --> 07:50.370]  what you have in in licensed operations the majority of them is you're beholden to your investor and
[07:51.010 --> 07:53.570]  So most of these investors that came into cannabis
[07:54.250 --> 07:55.930]  Unfortunately have zero
[07:55.930 --> 07:57.530]  agricultural background
[07:57.530 --> 08:04.250]  So to them if they if you have 10,000 square foot canopy in a greenhouse, then it's all 10,000 must be used
[08:05.370 --> 08:11.890]  Go online and they get on Google and they become Google smart and they say well eight weeks is just it was what it all
[08:11.890 --> 08:16.510]  Should be and so what they want to do is they want to cram 10,000 square foot with 10,000 square foot
[08:16.570 --> 08:20.050]  They want everything to be in in a eight-week platform
[08:20.850 --> 08:26.490]  Screaming numbers and the problem is that there's only so many plants that can work in and that's configuration
[08:26.490 --> 08:32.610]  So what occurs is you end up competing with every single operation because every single investor
[08:32.610 --> 08:33.090]  Oh
[08:33.090 --> 08:35.090]  95% of them are looking at the same
[08:35.290 --> 08:42.250]  Information online to make their decisions on how they want to pressure their cultivators. And so I work I work internationally
[08:42.250 --> 08:43.930]  I'm all over the world
[08:43.930 --> 08:45.610]  It's the same situation
[08:45.610 --> 08:50.250]  you have to really be able to take the owners the people who put the money in and sit them down and help them kind
[08:50.250 --> 08:51.810]  of understand that
[08:51.810 --> 08:56.170]  You're all competing against each other because you're all selling the exact same carrot
[08:56.650 --> 09:01.810]  And we're able to differentiate a little to some degree and then it doesn't have to be your entire
[09:03.330 --> 09:06.570]  Demographic has to accept it doesn't have to be your entire canopy be it
[09:06.850 --> 09:13.890]  It just means that you have to have differentiation within what you do so that you address the fact that the cannabis consumer
[09:14.370 --> 09:16.770]  It doesn't really care about your ROI
[09:17.490 --> 09:23.490]  They don't it about what struggle you're going through. That's not their concern. Nor should it be that's your problem
[09:23.610 --> 09:29.170]  the cannabis consumer wants to get decent herb at a at a good price and
[09:29.490 --> 09:34.170]  Hopefully some diversity so they're not smoking the same shit every day. I always tell people I'm like look
[09:34.170 --> 09:37.610]  I love I love Captain Crunch cereal right when I was a kid
[09:37.610 --> 09:40.290]  Well, it doesn't mean I eat it three times a day seven days a week
[09:41.170 --> 09:47.370]  So it's that same idea and the problem is that the the the education of the
[09:47.530 --> 09:52.650]  Individuals coming into cannabis was really low in terms of the customer. Everybody's brilliant
[09:52.650 --> 09:57.410]  I mean, I'm talking I every business every place I go. Everyone is far more educated than I am
[09:57.410 --> 10:00.290]  I'm like the the least educated person anywhere I go
[10:00.930 --> 10:05.610]  but I spent my entire life in the street and in the hustle and in the grind and
[10:05.890 --> 10:11.330]  And then 50 last 15 years owning dispensaries operations nurseries and all these other things
[10:11.810 --> 10:16.650]  So I kind of take a look at it and say hey, this is the reality that we're in
[10:17.290 --> 10:19.010]  But there's no book to read
[10:19.010 --> 10:24.650]  There's no course you can take to give you this and so everyone's having to kind of learn it in real time
[10:24.650 --> 10:26.650]  and the problem is is that
[10:27.370 --> 10:33.810]  Investors get angry when their money is not being returned like they expected and so they they fire the cultivators
[10:33.810 --> 10:38.930]  They fire the team they bring in new people the people they bring in tell them what they want to hear
[10:38.930 --> 10:43.210]  Then they fail and then eventually you run out of money and you can't gather any
[10:43.850 --> 10:50.210]  One of the largest cannabis distribution companies in the United States see sue extract. They just sold for a hundred grand
[10:50.770 --> 10:57.690]  So I'm not how much debt that company had to pick up to pay a hundred K for their brand license and all the other
[10:57.690 --> 10:59.690]  stuff, but we're talking they were doing
[10:59.930 --> 11:05.050]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of product movement and they're done
[11:05.690 --> 11:11.210]  So it's that same problem that what you have is you have the people who dictate what takes place?
[11:12.250 --> 11:15.930]  they're uneducated in what the customer wants and
[11:16.450 --> 11:21.450]  It it it has drastic issues because when you start to limit
[11:21.890 --> 11:27.410]  populations you you can't justify holding material that doesn't fit the parameter and
[11:27.570 --> 11:32.730]  So what takes place is we keep compressing these gene pools till we have more and more and more of a homogenized
[11:33.450 --> 11:36.290]  cluster and what we have a genise highs
[11:37.290 --> 11:39.290]  homogenized flavors and
[11:39.370 --> 11:45.570]  So the customers bored and depressed and they're not digging it and if there's any question or any debate about that
[11:45.570 --> 11:49.450]  Then you would just say well, then why is the traditional still flourishing?
[11:49.790 --> 11:56.130]  To the same degree when you can walk to the store because I I think I'm not buying any milk on the street corner
[11:56.170 --> 12:01.670]  I'm not he's burger on the street corner because I can go to the store and I can get a pretty good alternative
[12:01.770 --> 12:03.330]  but with cannabis
[12:03.330 --> 12:05.330]  It clearly if we were in Russia
[12:05.330 --> 12:10.890]  It'd be different because they have a different system of production on how things are chosen to be produced and what's available
[12:11.210 --> 12:13.210]  but in a market economy
[12:13.410 --> 12:15.970]  the demands of the people dictate the reality and
[12:16.690 --> 12:18.490]  They're obviously not being met
[12:18.490 --> 12:25.310]  And so that's why my recommendation for a long time with anyone who's a consumer is get out of the friggin loop
[12:25.310 --> 12:26.190]  and
[12:26.190 --> 12:31.470]  produce your own product if at all possible and if you don't have the ability then find someone in your
[12:31.950 --> 12:33.950]  social circle who can and
[12:34.110 --> 12:39.270]  work collaboratively to the degree you can so that what it does it gets you cannabis at a
[12:39.750 --> 12:43.950]  reasonable price and it lets you choose varieties that you want to play with
[12:45.990 --> 12:52.470]  How you develop cannabis connoisseurship is you're allowing people to be able to dictate their their
[12:53.470 --> 12:55.470]  Desires and
[12:56.470 --> 13:02.510]  Working collaboratively to me is the only way to achieve it for many a lot of a lot of people don't have infrastructure
[13:02.510 --> 13:04.030]  You know for me, I'm a sun-grown dude
[13:04.030 --> 13:12.550]  So even though I mess around a lot of large indoor mixed light operations and we have indoor operations at my facility and indoor
[13:12.550 --> 13:18.510]  Test operations mix light operation outdoor offer R&D for me. My farm is full Sun
[13:18.710 --> 13:21.550]  No light that single cycle full Sun
[13:23.070 --> 13:27.330]  Right, and it's for me my preferred method of cultivation
[13:27.330 --> 13:32.710]  It's my preferred method of consumption as flowers that are derived in that methodology
[13:32.790 --> 13:34.910]  But that doesn't mean that that that's best
[13:34.990 --> 13:41.310]  It just means it's best for me and what I know is that most people aren't in Northern, California, Southern, California
[13:42.070 --> 13:44.510]  where they get supernatural weather and
[13:45.110 --> 13:51.510]  And and and our and our allowances are different and I know that none of my neighbors are gonna be jumping my fence to steal
[13:51.510 --> 13:55.350]  I have a fence. They're not coming in my yard to steal because they have their own shit
[13:55.750 --> 14:01.350]  So if if you're not in that little magic bubble of opportunity, you know, you're forced to
[14:02.030 --> 14:04.030]  operate differently, so
[14:04.030 --> 14:11.150]  What you have is you just have to accept the fact that most don't have resources most don't have access and when it comes to buying
[14:11.350 --> 14:12.630]  Cannabis I
[14:12.630 --> 14:18.550]  Mean an eighth to me is like, you know, maybe two joints, right? So two full-size good joints
[14:18.550 --> 14:20.070]  I mean we can roll small ones and shit
[14:20.070 --> 14:24.190]  But if I want to roll something that I can smoke on and get a full mouth, it's like a cigar
[14:25.310 --> 14:28.550]  longest cigar cooler charge thickest cigar full of flavor
[14:28.790 --> 14:34.630]  So if who's wants to experience more than just getting high and I want the mouth
[14:34.630 --> 14:40.990]  I want the nuances and eight is about two joints. So let's average eight is 50 bucks, right?
[14:41.710 --> 14:46.950]  You know 40 40 to 80 it ranges depending on the the value of the brand
[14:47.310 --> 14:51.710]  Who'd a fucking afford a $25 joint when you're burning six of them a day?
[14:52.110 --> 14:54.950]  So that's a hundred fifty bucks a day in weed
[14:55.790 --> 14:59.070]  You're you're talking about that's a lot of money
[14:59.430 --> 15:06.030]  and for me the only way cannabis can be consumed at a level that allows you to smoke it and not
[15:06.070 --> 15:10.990]  Feel like you're poor and not hoard every crumb is either you grow it yourself
[15:11.030 --> 15:16.630]  Or you work collaboratively with people who can so you can get the price down to where it's reasonable, right?
[15:17.030 --> 15:20.150]  Well, I don't think that the the big LPs would like that
[15:20.150 --> 15:23.870]  They like to sell their orange weed to anybody who will buy it
[15:23.870 --> 15:28.910]  That's that we got problems up here in Canada in our are the way that it's set up
[15:28.910 --> 15:32.030]  It takes a certain amount of time and money and effort to establish
[15:32.630 --> 15:38.870]  You and then you got to establish your buyers and so forth and by the time you get your COAs and everything all done
[15:39.030 --> 15:46.090]  You know, your weed is at least four months old three four months old and to me that you're you're already out of your sweet spot
[15:46.090 --> 15:51.110]  I mean, I like 60 day cure it dry it and everything and it's ready to go
[15:51.110 --> 15:55.950]  you know, that's why the black market is scorching everybody's butt because the
[15:56.590 --> 16:01.630]  It's kind of set up against us in Canada here. And then where we live we can't grow
[16:02.070 --> 16:08.110]  No difference Ron. How about in California? You're talking like nine months to get an outdoor into the store
[16:08.630 --> 16:10.630]  nine months
[16:12.070 --> 16:15.390]  Nitrogen packet is it nitrogen packed? How do you keep it?
[16:15.790 --> 16:20.470]  You in the what you have to do is we even have some interesting stuff that pertains to like
[16:20.990 --> 16:27.670]  Store fronts won't take it if it has you know over like a 90 day 60 to 90 day window over
[16:28.350 --> 16:29.310]  Packaging right
[16:29.310 --> 16:35.750]  So if you package your herb and and then put it into the system and that doesn't move it gets sent back to you
[16:35.750 --> 16:43.470]  So you have to hold it yourself and then only pack the batches that you can sell so the date reflects packing not harvest
[16:44.350 --> 16:48.010]  So it's a nightmare for anybody. You guys don't have a lock on it
[16:48.010 --> 16:50.950]  But I'm I assist companies in Canada that are micros
[16:51.190 --> 16:55.470]  so I work micros on the East Coast and I work with some micros on the West Coast and
[16:56.070 --> 16:57.590]  Work with them as a
[16:57.590 --> 17:05.710]  more as is like mentorship in terms of like conceptual and I help them understand really like how do you play the game and
[17:05.990 --> 17:11.110]  What's the what's the opportunities that you need to take and where's the lanes you should stay out of?
[17:11.670 --> 17:15.790]  And it's just this process of working through it and and the law straight now
[17:15.790 --> 17:19.150]  You guys will straight now too because every one of your major firms just collapsed
[17:19.590 --> 17:24.030]  So they're unloading. I mean, I look at the I look at the list of all the stuff available. It's unbelievable
[17:24.790 --> 17:26.790]  So I could go score some of this shit cheap
[17:28.270 --> 17:32.390]  50 cents you can pay 50 cents for some some absolutely
[17:32.910 --> 17:38.550]  Stunning the best outdoor you've ever had, you know for there's BC's cannabis. That's just
[17:39.670 --> 17:43.950]  Stunning. It's really good. And it's just these guy everybody's getting brutalized
[17:44.430 --> 17:49.510]  They are they are but it's the game we're in right? So it doesn't matter what country you're in. It's the same story, right?
[17:49.510 --> 17:53.190]  I'm I I I talked to so many people around the world
[17:53.190 --> 17:58.110]  And it doesn't make a difference. It's it's at a cannabis is now
[17:59.190 --> 18:02.630]  Whether we see it as a commodity or not, it's a commodity
[18:02.710 --> 18:03.190]  Yeah
[18:03.190 --> 18:09.790]  And other that that's how these bigger companies treat it and it's and it's always the same if you do your research on how industries
[18:09.990 --> 18:12.230]  Develop and how old industries are
[18:12.830 --> 18:15.990]  Eclipsed and new operators come in. It's the same situation
[18:16.110 --> 18:21.910]  You come in you price war everybody to death you beat him to death you scream about efficiency and and all this other shit
[18:22.830 --> 18:26.190]  Everybody's gone and then what you end up having is the new market
[18:26.790 --> 18:28.910]  But with the cannabis, it's unique
[18:29.150 --> 18:34.670]  So when I did heavy research on this 15 16 years ago before I made my entry in the legal
[18:35.070 --> 18:38.310]  because I needed to clearly understand what was about to take place and
[18:39.510 --> 18:45.550]  Cannabis is unique in the fact that it's really the only product that had a hundred year history of illicit sales
[18:46.110 --> 18:51.190]  Which created a comfort level with people buying and selling illegal shit
[18:51.910 --> 18:53.230]  so
[18:53.230 --> 18:58.630]  Most people aren't comfortable buying illegal things. So if I come up to you and say yo my buddy just
[18:59.070 --> 19:05.270]  He happened to notice a truck that and five TVs fell out the back into his truck
[19:05.430 --> 19:07.630]  Would you like one for a fourth of the price?
[19:08.230 --> 19:10.350]  Most people are a little hesitant
[19:11.630 --> 19:15.710]  Cannabis I'm like I got some cheap urban. It's killer. They taking it right now
[19:16.710 --> 19:21.070]  Because they have made that decision since they started consuming
[19:21.870 --> 19:23.630]  Eve best
[19:23.630 --> 19:26.670]  dispensaries prior in California now legal
[19:27.270 --> 19:30.430]  Everybody's got somebody around them growing urban and selling her
[19:31.030 --> 19:33.710]  So what you have is you have this?
[19:34.670 --> 19:37.150]  familiarity with in a legal transaction
[19:37.510 --> 19:44.230]  And even now it's still it's still legal on Cal they decry more every saying they catch you moving her for profit. It's a felony
[19:44.790 --> 19:45.910]  So
[19:45.910 --> 19:51.710]  You've never had such a situation where you've created an industry that is emerging
[19:51.990 --> 19:56.830]  That isn't eclipsing a legitimate industry. It's eclipsing a
[19:57.750 --> 20:02.350]  human based industry that moved illicitly in the shadows because it was forced to and
[20:03.550 --> 20:08.710]  Because of that the people that come into cannabis corporate wise and are nothing against any of them
[20:08.710 --> 20:12.310]  They're like said they're brilliant. You know what they do. They're not in their lane
[20:12.310 --> 20:14.630]  And so they come into this room
[20:15.150 --> 20:22.790]  applying the same data set they extrapolate data from one set apply it to another and they're getting the shit kicked out of
[20:22.790 --> 20:24.790]  them and I
[20:26.430 --> 20:30.150]  Do because I I I I
[20:31.310 --> 20:32.870]  Hate to see
[20:32.870 --> 20:38.550]  Smaller people just stepped on so like I have no problem working with big companies. I have no problem
[20:39.110 --> 20:41.110]  seeing the globalization of cannabis
[20:41.550 --> 20:43.190]  But
[20:43.190 --> 20:48.390]  The the the thing that's the deal-breaker for me is that you know, are you decent individual?
[20:48.390 --> 20:49.630]  and so
[20:49.630 --> 20:52.950]  Everyone's desire that the idea of a sellout is that when you build?
[20:53.150 --> 20:59.870]  businesses if you're really in business and you building a business your desire is either to continue to grow it or to create a package
[20:59.870 --> 21:02.870]  that you can unload so you can either recoup the loot and
[21:03.430 --> 21:08.230]  Retire from your work or go to another endeavor because you're a serial entrepreneur
[21:09.230 --> 21:12.590]  So it's it's it's this it's this
[21:13.470 --> 21:17.270]  Realization of who you're dealing with. What are you trying to do? And
[21:17.870 --> 21:21.790]  For me cannabis diversity is my primary
[21:22.470 --> 21:24.470]  desire what I want to see is
[21:24.830 --> 21:29.790]  people be able to have access to as many different types of cannabis as that possibly can be and
[21:30.430 --> 21:34.350]  for the fact that herb coming out of countries like
[21:35.270 --> 21:40.110]  Pakistan India you couldn't put that in the California market and sell it as it sits
[21:40.750 --> 21:43.510]  The COA's don't match and the visuals don't match
[21:44.310 --> 21:46.790]  So we're saying that that stuff doesn't work
[21:46.790 --> 21:50.110]  What they need to do is they need to grow our genes and you're not really catching that
[21:50.110 --> 21:53.710]  There's been millennia of people buying that product and happy with it
[21:53.710 --> 21:58.070]  and so it's really about figuring out where these lanes are of
[21:58.550 --> 22:05.590]  Where your product enters where you're stable so that you're able to actually continue to work with the things that work for you in your area
[22:05.910 --> 22:08.470]  And you're the state kind of true to your roots
[22:09.190 --> 22:13.790]  because your experience with that thing is profound, you know how to work with it and
[22:14.670 --> 22:18.430]  And the only way that happens is if these bigger companies keep getting smacked out
[22:19.270 --> 22:25.670]  Because they're they they were able to gather too much investment too quickly. And so it's nothing against the Canadian companies
[22:25.670 --> 22:30.830]  I I know a bunch of the CEOs and investment groups that own them. I've talked to him in person
[22:30.830 --> 22:34.150]  They fly in to speak to me. It's not against them personally
[22:34.150 --> 22:38.310]  It's just that when your attitude is I'm gonna bring money to beat you up
[22:39.110 --> 22:43.510]  Then you forgot that a handful of money is different than a set of brass knuckles
[22:44.030 --> 22:49.210]  Yeah, so I I don't like the attitude of we're gonna take you out
[22:49.210 --> 22:54.430]  I don't like the petty competitiveness where you see every single cannabis person as this competitor that I
[22:54.670 --> 22:59.150]  Need to get rid of the small operator. I need to make homegrown illegal
[22:59.150 --> 23:05.590]  I need to make it such a friggin nightmare that the only way you can get herb is through me if that's coming out of
[23:05.590 --> 23:09.030]  Your mouth. I want to see you fall down and break all your teeth. Yeah
[23:12.190 --> 23:14.190]  Consumer first I
[23:14.230 --> 23:18.230]  Or I was growing so at 12, I'm a smoker by 14. I'm a grower
[23:19.030 --> 23:25.470]  But but I'm always a consumer in my mind and that's what's really I think allowed me to have a successful career is
[23:26.030 --> 23:32.430]  That I look at it as if I was the one buying the weed and so you can dance around all damn day
[23:32.430 --> 23:36.110]  but if the herb isn't decent and the prices aren't fair and
[23:36.870 --> 23:39.150]  Your delivery isn't cool
[23:39.150 --> 23:47.350]  I have alternatives and I think the the issue that the bigger companies don't catch is that when they pressure these people
[23:47.590 --> 23:52.190]  The people like well, I'm just gonna squirt through your fingers and you're never going to touch me again
[23:53.110 --> 23:54.450]  Yeah, yeah
[23:54.450 --> 23:57.190]  They're trying that they're trying to catch catch the wind
[23:57.190 --> 24:02.630]  You know and put it in a jar and and people people will just go to the black market some other way
[24:02.790 --> 24:07.670]  You know, I I'm excited about home people having the ability to home grow. I'm
[24:08.350 --> 24:14.230]  Trying to work on some I've got some strains that are so easy to grow that you almost could take and put it on the ground
[24:14.230 --> 24:15.350]  And just step on it
[24:15.350 --> 24:20.470]  Just drop the seed on the ground and just step on it scuff it up with your feet and just come back and pick your
[24:20.470 --> 24:20.670]  weed
[24:20.670 --> 24:21.270]  I
[24:21.270 --> 24:27.910]  think when people find that they can they can grow some of these these autos that are really quite easy to grow and they're and
[24:27.910 --> 24:29.150]  They grow quite good flower
[24:29.150 --> 24:34.630]  Then they'll get the taste and you'll see I think the seed market in the genetics market will probably really
[24:35.190 --> 24:41.390]  Take off in the States as soon as it goes legal if everybody can grow four plants like they can up here in Canada
[24:41.390 --> 24:44.870]  I I can see seeds going absolutely crazy
[24:44.870 --> 24:49.370]  And the problem is a lot of people are selling seeds that you know, I've grown them out
[24:49.370 --> 24:51.950]  I grew $8,000 worth of seeds in the last
[24:52.870 --> 24:54.390]  four or five months
[24:54.390 --> 24:56.930]  from other companies big companies companies
[24:56.930 --> 25:02.710]  you know and I was kind of surprised that I didn't see a better quality it could because I'm an
[25:03.830 --> 25:05.910]  Cannabis snob right? I've got some
[25:06.630 --> 25:11.110]  Ridiculous genetics that I can access to but I thought at least theirs would be
[25:11.990 --> 25:13.990]  somewhere near what what was
[25:14.590 --> 25:19.630]  Quoted, you know, they're talking about 20 to 24 percent and you get it and you grow it out and you grow it
[25:19.630 --> 25:22.630]  Well, and you know, you grew it. Well, and it's only 16. So I
[25:23.390 --> 25:26.630]  think that that genetics is probably gonna
[25:27.670 --> 25:31.190]  overcome people going to the stores and and the up here they sell a
[25:32.190 --> 25:37.470]  128 pack of pre-rolls, you know, you can get these little half half gram pre-rolls
[25:37.950 --> 25:42.870]  It's like what a what a market, you know, it's like I'm looking forward to the future
[25:43.550 --> 25:45.670]  Nobody can roll and I'm telling you
[25:46.190 --> 25:51.470]  It isn't like all like the idea that the genes are gonna suddenly get people to get involved in cannabis
[25:51.470 --> 25:58.270]  I would if I was to put a scale and weigh the amount of herb being produced from operators in
[25:58.550 --> 26:00.550]  California that aren't licensed
[26:00.590 --> 26:05.550]  Across the whole state. I bet we outproduced Canada as an LP. Oh
[26:06.870 --> 26:10.350]  the amount of herb like you're talking about Americans, right and
[26:11.350 --> 26:13.350]  we wear a
[26:13.710 --> 26:19.230]  Law-breaking bunch. Yeah, and so quantity of cannabis being produced is phenomenal
[26:19.230 --> 26:25.590]  I would challenge most seeds sold around the world end up at 80% all drugs in the world end up in the US, right?
[26:25.590 --> 26:30.030]  So if anybody's growing dope creating analogs, where's it ended up here? Yeah
[26:30.830 --> 26:32.830]  we're where we
[26:32.870 --> 26:39.990]  Do the most consumption and we promote to the highest level because we have the resources and we're allowed to in that regard
[26:40.510 --> 26:46.630]  So what it what it what it needs to have happen is you need to be especially now if the new DEA laws, right?
[26:46.630 --> 26:48.510]  so the DEA
[26:48.510 --> 26:56.510]  changes their stance where they used to be if the cannabis seed has the potential to produce a product that that that registers 0.03
[26:56.510 --> 26:59.870]  And THC it's considered cannabis. It's schedule one
[27:00.470 --> 27:07.710]  It's fully illegal every drop of its federally illegal then the DEA relooks at that and says well as it sits
[27:08.310 --> 27:14.150]  It can't be above 0.03. It's a seed. So all of a sudden seeds fall under hemp
[27:14.670 --> 27:19.030]  and now they can be moved in the mail now, they can be moved freely and
[27:20.150 --> 27:26.410]  People can have the ability to purchase and buy and so what you're gonna see is you're gonna you're gonna start to see really a
[27:26.450 --> 27:30.690]  Homegrown revolution in the regard that seeds can now be created
[27:30.690 --> 27:35.370]  So so what we would and I've always dreamt of this is that you have a million breeders
[27:36.090 --> 27:40.550]  You have a million people that are doing seed reproduction and breeder to me is very specific thing
[27:40.550 --> 27:46.690]  My my mother was a research geneticist, right? I was where she started her scientific career
[27:46.690 --> 27:50.070]  and so to me the definition of breeder is
[27:50.830 --> 27:55.070]  Reproductive reproducible results under a very tight standard of deviation
[27:55.830 --> 27:58.470]  If you're not doing that, you're not breeding you just reproducing
[27:58.470 --> 28:02.190]  So for me, I'm someone who does incredible amounts of seed work
[28:02.670 --> 28:07.330]  But really I'm not a breeder my skills are in selection for application
[28:07.330 --> 28:12.630]  But I do a tremendous amount of preservation and I work a lot of stock so that I can do
[28:13.470 --> 28:14.550]  Selection
[28:14.550 --> 28:17.170]  So I put I call them genetic collisions
[28:17.170 --> 28:23.790]  I put the genes together that I think will blend well, and then I look through populations for outlier clones
[28:24.630 --> 28:28.950]  Because for me I was involved in large-scale nursery operations, and I still am
[28:29.550 --> 28:31.550]  so we have the
[28:31.590 --> 28:34.150]  I'm involved in a couple different operations that are big
[28:34.550 --> 28:40.030]  So what it what it means is that I'm not trying to say that you know when you buy my seed
[28:40.270 --> 28:42.790]  Everyone of them is the same what I'm saying is that
[28:43.390 --> 28:48.630]  And I it and then there's preservation where it's just I preserve stuff that I think is rare
[28:49.510 --> 28:53.910]  Desirable old and then I give them out to people when I'm at conventions
[28:53.910 --> 28:56.310]  I give them out to people who want to do preservation
[28:56.310 --> 28:59.070]  I give them out to people who also have a similar desire to hold
[28:59.230 --> 29:06.230]  Interesting stock to take stock from other countries that people can't access my my reach around the world is kind of unique
[29:06.230 --> 29:09.150]  And what it does it lets us take gene pools
[29:09.750 --> 29:15.630]  That are priceless and bring them into the mainstream give them to people help them understand
[29:15.830 --> 29:19.590]  That you want to hold the gene pool pure and then you want to do
[29:19.990 --> 29:24.510]  Hybridization so you can bring the qualities and play around and get it into something that'll work for you
[29:24.790 --> 29:28.410]  Stuff that's coming out of the equator isn't really tent friendly
[29:28.950 --> 29:34.130]  But the point is they can play with it to find out what's it like to run a hundred thirty day variety
[29:35.050 --> 29:41.090]  Experience the direction find out why these things were successful for so long. What's the direction of the high?
[29:41.170 --> 29:45.450]  How can you take parts of it and merge it with other plants that bring other value?
[29:45.970 --> 29:47.730]  so it's
[29:47.730 --> 29:49.410]  It's it's a different process
[29:49.410 --> 29:55.130]  And so, you know for me everything that I've worked on and then I do I do some weird shit where I'll do mail
[29:55.330 --> 30:00.610]  Selections and I'll find mails and I'll run them through I'll do the progeny test and I'll say okay
[30:00.770 --> 30:05.370]  This male adds on average three to four points of THC
[30:05.370 --> 30:09.770]  so if it was a 20 on the female the progeny are coming out 24 or 25 and
[30:10.570 --> 30:12.890]  It provides a specific profile
[30:12.890 --> 30:17.770]  And so I'll take males that I'll develop and I'll use them in projects that I'm involved in
[30:17.770 --> 30:20.530]  But then I share these males with with small people
[30:21.050 --> 30:23.930]  people that don't have my level of resource and
[30:24.410 --> 30:30.170]  What it does it allows them to be able to move their projects forward and it lets them work and they can share
[30:30.170 --> 30:31.850]  material with other people
[30:31.850 --> 30:36.410]  so what you're doing is you're creating these these networks of
[30:37.130 --> 30:41.330]  People trying to support each other so that we can compete
[30:41.970 --> 30:44.330]  collaboratively against the bigger machine
[30:45.010 --> 30:50.170]  And irony is I'm involved in a lot of these big machines, but the ones I'm involved in to me
[30:50.170 --> 30:55.450]  They're really not trying to screw anybody. It's just it's the business. We're in you're in a business to make money growing weed
[30:56.050 --> 30:59.530]  And if they vantage they do and it's smart and so to with you
[31:00.090 --> 31:03.370]  Anyone in business is not there to fail and lose the money
[31:03.930 --> 31:10.810]  So when you make the decision to go into cannabis cultivation cannabis reproduction and anything any license
[31:11.530 --> 31:14.450]  You're talking an incredible amount of money required
[31:14.450 --> 31:20.090]  They think that the new licenses in New York are really going to be costing like 60 million dollars
[31:20.610 --> 31:27.090]  They're that valuable the ones in Illinois like a dispensary license worth like 30 Florida 30 40 million to get a license
[31:27.730 --> 31:35.250]  Because of the way they structure it. It's so desirable and then the the levels required to get at it. So who actually
[31:36.090 --> 31:42.730]  You know, it's a hundred and forty equity people. Well, I think the York's got like what 10 million people so of the entire state
[31:43.970 --> 31:45.570]  150 of them
[31:45.570 --> 31:51.170]  150 selected people who got screwed in the war on drugs get access to the licensing so that another
[31:51.490 --> 31:54.210]  Venture capital group can then use them to get the license
[31:54.730 --> 31:58.650]  Well, what about the other six million people in the state right there? They're screwed
[31:59.530 --> 32:04.210]  So the only way that you can play the game is to get and
[32:04.730 --> 32:11.570]  So you you you and you have to be able to understand that people that have no value today can grow up to be
[32:11.610 --> 32:16.330]  Incredibly valuable and that what you're trying to do is my desire in the way
[32:16.330 --> 32:22.210]  I've operated is I kind of play around people that I like and if I think you don't have to have any value to me
[32:22.210 --> 32:26.570]  I don't have to I don't need you to do anything for me. I just have to notice that I
[32:27.090 --> 32:32.370]  like you and that you you have a good attitude and you you decent person and
[32:32.930 --> 32:38.810]  Then that's it. I'll reach out and say yo, I noticed you doing something and I'm just hitting you up privately to say
[32:38.810 --> 32:40.810]  I have something that would help you and
[32:41.330 --> 32:45.730]  What it does is it allows you to create I think
[32:46.250 --> 32:49.810]  The belief that the humans still exists in the world herb
[32:50.210 --> 32:54.890]  because the humans being pushed right out of it and the company's being brought forward and
[32:55.450 --> 33:02.050]  If you notice the companies that are failing no humanity and the companies that are succeeding have a human attribute
[33:02.050 --> 33:05.610]  Mm-hmm is the drug which is funny
[33:05.610 --> 33:11.290]  But it's and it's this is where I love the fact that the corporations overlook this one urban drug that
[33:11.810 --> 33:18.810]  makes you non-competitive to the degree that you're trying to step on someone else to get up usually cooler so
[33:18.810 --> 33:25.610]  you sell a product that upon consumption makes you have a different vision of how business is done and how people should treat each other and
[33:25.610 --> 33:32.090]  when you eyes that the company's screwing you and screwing around you the herb brought that forward and
[33:33.090 --> 33:35.090]  So you can't hide
[33:35.610 --> 33:38.410]  You can't hide from it. The product gives you the vision
[33:38.450 --> 33:41.370]  So if you a widget it wouldn't make a difference
[33:41.370 --> 33:47.450]  but when you consume herb it changes you it really does it has a profound impact on the people and
[33:48.170 --> 33:53.050]  Cannabis culture has been pretty tender pretty gentle sales and business that different
[33:53.050 --> 33:59.050]  But how herb was traded between people how it was shared how when friends come over the house to have a sesh
[33:59.050 --> 34:02.770]  You're gonna go burn with your buddies. It's it's as non-competitive
[34:03.450 --> 34:04.930]  non-aggressive
[34:04.930 --> 34:07.890]  it's a beautiful collaborative moment and
[34:08.690 --> 34:15.250]  companies that succeed catch that and companies that failed don't and it's this whole thing of you know,
[34:15.930 --> 34:17.930]  We know we're gonna we're gonna
[34:18.490 --> 34:23.850]  What's my favorite line? I hear all the time. Oh, I'm about the plant and I'm always like in what way
[34:24.370 --> 34:26.370]  What what exactly you about?
[34:27.250 --> 34:32.450]  Tell me tell me how you're you're what are you doing and it's it's buzzword shit and
[34:32.970 --> 34:35.450]  The bottom line is if you're about the plan, it just means
[34:36.290 --> 34:44.690]  You're about cannabis as a culture and if you are able in any way you work in preservation to hold something that you love
[34:45.170 --> 34:51.410]  So which is difficult over the course of a career in illegal cannabis, right?
[34:51.410 --> 34:53.410]  Also the killer shit got lost because of raids
[34:53.410 --> 34:57.890]  Also the killer shit got lost because of raids, I mean I had fuck I had on countless raids
[34:58.850 --> 35:05.490]  My libraries had to be replenished multiple times, but by virtue of the fact that I move genes everywhere all the time
[35:06.810 --> 35:10.730]  We can pretty much search the world and find them and get them back
[35:11.370 --> 35:15.210]  right hold them yourself in your little hoarding closet and
[35:15.650 --> 35:21.090]  Anything happens all that's going and outlier clones and things from the past
[35:22.010 --> 35:26.730]  It's just the travesty and so to me how many mother how many mothers do you have?
[35:27.170 --> 35:31.490]  How many mothers you have that you you hold because I over the years?
[35:31.490 --> 35:35.170]  I've gotten a lot of genetics and I had kids and I kind of dropped out of the game
[35:35.170 --> 35:36.970]  That's how I preserved my genetics
[35:36.970 --> 35:38.170]  I dropped out of the game
[35:38.170 --> 35:43.130]  But I still grew them up on the hill so that I could have them reset about every five years
[35:43.130 --> 35:48.810]  So I didn't lose the viability in my seed and I just kept them because I just kept them and I wasn't in the game
[35:48.810 --> 35:52.490]  I wasn't selling weed. I wasn't doing black market. I just kept the genetics for myself
[35:52.930 --> 35:59.490]  How but I can't keep mothers I have to do I have to get it back in seed form and then re-hunt it
[35:59.490 --> 36:02.450]  You know by necessity how many mothers do you have?
[36:03.010 --> 36:06.450]  Right now well, let's see you know at my house
[36:06.450 --> 36:11.650]  I got probably five different plants right that I play with that I grow in my yard for my own enjoyment
[36:11.890 --> 36:14.770]  Mess around with all you know legal shakes. I have medical
[36:15.290 --> 36:18.090]  I have a 215 in California that means I also have medical
[36:18.970 --> 36:22.850]  So I play around I got about 80 80 to 90
[36:23.530 --> 36:25.530]  held in
[36:25.610 --> 36:27.610]  vitro at a lab
[36:27.890 --> 36:31.210]  so they're preserved so this way I they're they're banked and
[36:31.970 --> 36:38.570]  It's it's a collection that I've amassed over years where I just hold them because I know the value in breeding and application
[36:38.570 --> 36:45.410]  And then at the at the nursery that I have at the cookie R&D we were running about 150 different moms there
[36:45.410 --> 36:48.730]  I think we whittled it down to about I was talking to Jonah the manager
[36:49.530 --> 36:52.290]  Two days ago, and I think he's whittled it down to about 85
[36:52.810 --> 36:59.530]  So there's a five different genomic forms held at the cookie nursery that kind of reflects. What's the best stock that's going through their hands
[36:59.530 --> 37:06.710]  I have about 80 to 90 different plants that that aren't in that collection. They're radically different
[37:06.710 --> 37:09.610]  There it's a diversified collection gathered through time
[37:10.570 --> 37:12.170]  so
[37:12.170 --> 37:17.010]  And then and over the course of my career Jesus Christ, man, I don't have no idea I've touched
[37:18.850 --> 37:20.730]  Unlimited amounts of plants
[37:20.730 --> 37:26.610]  But you know the problem with it is is that we didn't have banking and even with in vitro right which is cool
[37:27.890 --> 37:31.470]  It still requires you to maintain it
[37:31.810 --> 37:35.530]  So everyone's building all these little in vitro little huts and all this other shit
[37:35.530 --> 37:38.370]  Well, you still got to take the plant. You still got to refresh the charge
[37:38.370 --> 37:42.090]  You still got to take the clip you still got to propagate it. You still have to hold it
[37:42.170 --> 37:44.170]  you still have to deal with it and
[37:44.690 --> 37:46.690]  if you're in a legal state and
[37:47.330 --> 37:50.050]  And you're allowed for plant six plants
[37:50.650 --> 37:57.490]  Your mom bank in your closet that's got you know, hundred moms in vitro. That's a hundred different plants, right?
[37:57.490 --> 38:00.330]  So you're what do they classify you now as?
[38:01.330 --> 38:06.050]  Propagation for sale. That's a felony. So like the way legality
[38:07.010 --> 38:12.370]  Creates these parameters of holding it makes it almost impossible to really hold stuff
[38:12.370 --> 38:16.090]  So what we started looking into here in Humboldt County was like cryogenic banking
[38:17.130 --> 38:18.570]  because
[38:18.570 --> 38:21.490]  cryogenic lets us take the germ plasm and
[38:22.050 --> 38:27.690]  And I get a hold of a bunch of scientists to figure out how they're holding other germ plasms. What's the process?
[38:27.690 --> 38:29.890]  So you don't have cellular cellular disruption
[38:29.890 --> 38:34.130]  and it's this process of bringing it down to the first stage of temperature and
[38:34.330 --> 38:37.290]  then doing the cold plunge in the liquid nitrogen and
[38:37.730 --> 38:43.530]  Then you're able to then bring it back up and then put it put that germ plasm. It was frozen
[38:44.090 --> 38:46.050]  safely into
[38:46.050 --> 38:47.890]  in vitro test tube and
[38:47.890 --> 38:55.490]  Then go from there because the cryogenic which to me is the only way this is going to work it all does requires a
[38:56.130 --> 39:02.890]  Little bit of electricity and then a gas bottle, you know, Walt Disney is right? Yeah, he's cryogenically frozen
[39:03.410 --> 39:05.130]  here in Humboldt County
[39:05.130 --> 39:06.130]  Wow
[39:06.130 --> 39:13.450]  I'm so I swear to God I why here I have no idea but there's a ranch in Petrolia that holds Walt Disney's body
[39:14.970 --> 39:22.170]  Cryogenically frozen he had himself frozen so that when the technology was available, they'll bring his ass back to life
[39:22.970 --> 39:27.650]  So if you can cry and I store dog sperm cryogenically, right
[39:27.650 --> 39:30.770]  So I'm like if you can store sperm and bring it back to life
[39:30.970 --> 39:35.610]  You can store plant material and I think that that's the only way we can go forward
[39:38.090 --> 39:43.490]  It becomes like it's trying to figure out the legality because if you're trying to hold any plant material
[39:43.850 --> 39:51.050]  Legally, you need to have a nursery license nursery licenses that allow you to sell and move product require you to be on an industrial
[39:51.330 --> 39:58.930]  Zoned property, right? You can't be commercial. You can't be residential. You can't be ag a little different. So in, California
[40:00.370 --> 40:07.090]  The license is dictated by the zoning. So when we start to say we're gonna have a banking nursery
[40:07.090 --> 40:08.930]  Well, you're talking about expensive real estate
[40:08.930 --> 40:14.490]  You're talking about an expensive license and then you're saying you're not gonna be selling any this shit. You're just gonna hold it
[40:14.490 --> 40:17.690]  So how one justify the cost?
[40:18.370 --> 40:21.670]  So it makes it difficult, but I think that when we get into
[40:24.370 --> 40:30.770]  Cell cell culture where you're really trying to take the meristem and freeze it. It's such a small component
[40:30.770 --> 40:32.970]  I don't think it could be considered a plant. It's almost
[40:33.690 --> 40:40.010]  Like a loophole and what it would do it was allow you to cryogenically bank a huge amount of stock in any
[40:40.530 --> 40:45.210]  Situation that would allow you not to have to worry about law enforcement deciding today's the day
[40:45.210 --> 40:47.210]  They want to visit you and screw up your life
[40:48.050 --> 40:54.450]  and and that's I think and it's and this is a travesty because we've destroyed the cannabis population globally and
[40:55.130 --> 41:00.770]  we've infiltrated so many countries with stock because they weren't able to move their weed anymore because the
[41:00.850 --> 41:05.790]  Marketing of the magazines the marketing of the internet says if you're not running OG, you're not running cookie
[41:05.790 --> 41:09.250]  You don't go to gelato. You don't go to sherbet. You don't go to schedule. You're not in business
[41:10.410 --> 41:13.910]  It when gathers those materials brings them into that country
[41:14.670 --> 41:19.390]  Catastrophic failure every one of those plants was selected on an indoor buffered basis
[41:20.190 --> 41:22.010]  complete complete
[41:22.010 --> 41:25.630]  pollution of the gene pool and it doesn't mean all those things aren't good because
[41:26.390 --> 41:32.070]  Shit, I'm smoking OG every day. So I still love that profile. It's not about good or bad
[41:32.510 --> 41:38.910]  It's about the fact that you used to have, you know, 40 different kinds of big predator now you got four
[41:39.630 --> 41:44.750]  It's not a it's not a healthy direction to go with with gene preservation and
[41:45.550 --> 41:47.510]  with cannabis stuff
[41:47.510 --> 41:52.570]  The people the participants held it all of us old guys held stock
[41:52.570 --> 41:55.030]  I know young kids that have a
[41:55.310 --> 42:00.770]  Clone that their grandfather screwed with and gave it to the father and the father gave it to the son and they're like hey
[42:00.770 --> 42:05.530]  It's 38 years old and we still grow it in our little area out here in North Carolina
[42:05.850 --> 42:12.190]  I'm from them. I'm from the mountains of Georgia. I'm from the swamp of Florida and this is what we mess with in
[42:12.930 --> 42:16.690]  It's things that are acclimated that were so special to you
[42:16.690 --> 42:22.250]  You held them for 30 40 years, which means they must be special because if you have access
[42:22.250 --> 42:25.970]  Why would you hold on to some bullshit? I don't keep shoes that don't fit
[42:26.570 --> 42:30.890]  Right, so they don't fit my I don't hold on to him like oh my god, my feet are gonna grow
[42:31.050 --> 42:34.490]  No, I throw the goddamn things away. Actually, I take them to the Goodwill and
[42:36.010 --> 42:40.170]  Give them to somebody who can benefit and I think that's our situation here
[42:40.170 --> 42:46.810]  Is that you you have to be able to find methodologies to hold material so that these collections can be gathered
[42:47.250 --> 42:53.770]  so that as cannabis normalizes and you start to see the population realize that a
[42:54.330 --> 42:59.810]  Plant they could grow in their yard is being sold to him for an ungodly amount of money
[43:00.690 --> 43:05.730]  Um, how can anyone consume freely and I learned that in the trafficking we're like
[43:06.810 --> 43:10.150]  Most people just don't have an opinion on herb. That's really
[43:10.690 --> 43:16.330]  developed because they only get to smoke what their paycheck allows them to buy and
[43:17.130 --> 43:18.810]  So when you're not
[43:18.810 --> 43:24.210]  Constraint by your money your you have enough money and you're touching a lot of weed
[43:24.410 --> 43:29.510]  You've got a really different idea about what's available because you can play with it
[43:29.910 --> 43:30.990]  and to me
[43:30.990 --> 43:35.670]  That's what I'd love to see all people have is this ability to access this
[43:35.950 --> 43:41.550]  Massive gene pool around the world and enjoy the different directions and find their their line
[43:41.830 --> 43:47.470]  Find this stuff that's right for them and be able to hold it work with it cultivate it freely
[43:47.990 --> 43:53.510]  I'm in the business of commercial cannabis, but man, you know for the first we're seeing I started when I was 12 and 50
[43:53.510 --> 43:55.150]  So so 44 years, right?
[43:55.150 --> 43:59.390]  Well up until like, you know, I was in my early 40s
[43:59.390 --> 44:06.210]  So only like 15 16 years ago all illicit and then from the last 15 years forward
[44:06.750 --> 44:13.470]  There was like full illicit then there was gray market now where we now what we call like the legal market, right?
[44:13.990 --> 44:15.390]  and
[44:15.390 --> 44:21.590]  That that whole process lets me have a different vision because I had such a backstory
[44:21.590 --> 44:24.710]  And then when I got into legal I blew up
[44:25.230 --> 44:28.110]  So it lets me see that world pretty clearly, too
[44:28.110 --> 44:34.150]  And what I know is that we just we just have to do whatever we can to get genes in was many people's hands
[44:34.550 --> 44:38.190]  We have to courage people to to throw throw pollen
[44:38.790 --> 44:42.230]  It's it's it's there's no shame and being a pollen chucker
[44:42.830 --> 44:45.910]  The the small individual there was a guy here in humble
[44:46.510 --> 44:48.510]  who revolutionized
[44:48.950 --> 44:52.790]  The the lily industry out of his little garage and
[44:53.430 --> 45:00.390]  He invented the stargazer lily which reignited the industry which billions and tens of billions came from it
[45:00.630 --> 45:02.630]  so someone who was
[45:03.150 --> 45:08.870]  obsessed with quality and desirability of a thing creates a thing he ends up getting screwed and
[45:09.190 --> 45:11.450]  Really doesn't get the benefit. He should from the deal
[45:12.010 --> 45:14.270]  Which is a sad part, but to me
[45:15.510 --> 45:17.510]  creation comes from
[45:17.630 --> 45:19.950]  Inspiration it doesn't necessarily require
[45:20.830 --> 45:26.510]  Infrastructure I'm around like I said, I'm the least educated person in almost every single room
[45:26.510 --> 45:31.510]  I'm in when I'm involved with anything big and there's some reason why I'm in every one of these rooms
[45:32.470 --> 45:37.990]  So if everyone in the rooms got a PhD and that and you're there bringing you in to kind of steer the direction
[45:37.990 --> 45:44.590]  It means that to me anybody in cannabis has an ability to to be profoundly impactful
[45:45.110 --> 45:49.810]  Without special stuff. Can you compete with them long term? No
[45:50.590 --> 45:53.850]  No, you can't you can't compete with science long term
[45:53.850 --> 45:59.190]  Once they figure that shit out and they figure out how to do it well and reproduce it at scale with efficiency
[45:59.390 --> 46:04.110]  no one competes or science wouldn't be what we use to drive the direction if
[46:04.870 --> 46:09.210]  Science wasn't in the room. We still be using abacus is but before the abacus
[46:10.050 --> 46:14.570]  So that was that was modern science and the tool still works phenomenally well
[46:14.730 --> 46:19.530]  But I don't see a lot of abacus is being used versus a 10 key when we're doing accounting
[46:20.570 --> 46:27.570]  So no matter what science gets you ass, but it doesn't mean the inception can't happen that to me
[46:27.570 --> 46:30.350]  It's it's what that's the human gene pool as much as
[46:30.970 --> 46:33.290]  Every society likes to crush the poor
[46:34.290 --> 46:36.210]  What you find is
[46:36.210 --> 46:41.930]  Talent emerges that you just can't buy so all the world doesn't make you beautiful
[46:42.090 --> 46:49.610]  You can plastic surgery down, but it still doesn't put you at that the level of that's you and that's that's the surgeon
[46:50.130 --> 46:55.550]  Doesn't make you better athlete it can refine the process but without the right synapses and muscle fiber
[46:56.330 --> 46:58.250]  distribution you're not
[46:58.250 --> 46:59.610]  singers
[46:59.610 --> 47:04.030]  songwriters dancers things that come out of the human that all the humans are
[47:04.870 --> 47:06.310]  Astounded by
[47:06.310 --> 47:08.870]  That that's what allows you to break free
[47:08.870 --> 47:15.870]  And so to me if you look at every major cannabis variety half of them 90% of accidents
[47:17.190 --> 47:19.230]  That shit it was it
[47:19.830 --> 47:27.630]  something happened and the but the the key thing was the selection and preservation wasn't so
[47:28.430 --> 47:30.430]  Just is something happened. You got lucky
[47:31.230 --> 47:38.590]  The next part isn't luck the next part skill and that's where these big varieties became known because they were
[47:38.790 --> 47:40.910]  Discovered and they went home and then they got promoted
[47:41.470 --> 47:45.150]  Imagine how many tens of thousands of killer things are floating around?
[47:45.710 --> 47:47.710]  They just don't have a platform
[47:48.230 --> 47:49.190]  so for me
[47:49.190 --> 47:54.270]  If you want to drive an industry you have to have diversity and I mean diversity in every aspect
[47:54.430 --> 48:01.230]  Because the the desire the human is is their line that's where they go and if there's 10,000 of us going this
[48:01.750 --> 48:03.750]  10,000 different directions
[48:03.830 --> 48:06.990]  You're gonna come up with some pretty good outliers. Yeah for sure
[48:06.990 --> 48:13.110]  I love the the thought when I I've spent some time thinking about how land races come about
[48:13.390 --> 48:17.030]  It's somebody on the other side that made that land race
[48:17.150 --> 48:24.790]  They're open pollinating something that they like and they so they they're making a sift and they doing it over and over and over
[48:24.910 --> 48:27.070]  And over again, and it gets to be more
[48:27.710 --> 48:31.270]  Stable as they do it. And so there's some strains out here there
[48:31.270 --> 48:37.390]  I'd say I've got some sour that I've had for years that that I think it's a land race because
[48:38.030 --> 48:41.150]  Somebody bred it and then it's been bred back to itself
[48:41.150 --> 48:43.110]  So many times it is so stable
[48:43.110 --> 48:49.790]  That I just self it to itself and give the way the seeds away and they're they're the same sour so do you I
[48:50.550 --> 48:51.870]  kind of
[48:51.870 --> 48:58.550]  With land race though. It's it when we're talking about land race right land race. The first word is the one that matters
[48:58.550 --> 49:00.030]  It's on land
[49:00.030 --> 49:02.030]  It's not in a room
[49:02.230 --> 49:10.030]  The environment dictates that reality and then the human work within the population to choose what they like best
[49:10.670 --> 49:15.030]  So, but they're smart they know that if they only favor a single thing
[49:15.030 --> 49:18.750]  So say they find this that of the in the in the 20 acres of field
[49:18.750 --> 49:22.590]  They're running they find six plants that are just phenomenal
[49:22.950 --> 49:30.030]  They make sure they keep those seeds, but those seeds aren't the only ones they grow they reintroduce the entire population, but they
[49:30.550 --> 49:34.430]  Slowly steer it to where it's a little more in the way they like
[49:34.950 --> 49:39.550]  Because the truth of it is is that with the new pathogen with the new with the new bug?
[49:40.030 --> 49:42.030]  With the new drought with the new monsoon
[49:42.710 --> 49:45.630]  You have to have survivability. And so I think that
[49:46.430 --> 49:50.130]  The beauty of land races that it it has this genetic
[49:50.790 --> 49:58.770]  Data, it has epigenetics and it allows you to be able to always have survivability of a crop so that you get something
[49:59.230 --> 50:01.390]  Where we work on monocrop, you know
[50:01.390 --> 50:05.950]  we work on a single cultivar that we run because it's what we want to be able to do and we get the
[50:06.070 --> 50:10.050]  SOP and we we do this and we can take that plant and do it somewhere else
[50:11.110 --> 50:17.430]  It that that that it's very susceptible to a new problem. So say you know, you're you're
[50:18.190 --> 50:23.150]  The the the aphid is a big one. I call most of these big operations that I checked out prior
[50:23.150 --> 50:26.950]  I used to call them aphid factories because they were growing more aphid than they were growing weed and
[50:28.950 --> 50:35.070]  Well, if you're if you're growing this crop and you're a traditionalist meaning you're growing it because you need the you need the weed
[50:35.070 --> 50:40.310]  and you need the seed for food and you need the fiber you need the whole plant and
[50:40.750 --> 50:45.070]  You select it for your favorite one and you find out that that thing is absolutely
[50:45.710 --> 50:48.670]  Prone to aphid your entire crop is destroyed
[50:49.030 --> 50:54.270]  but if you are working with a diverse population meaning the same family, but
[50:55.030 --> 51:01.230]  Spread out a little you're gonna find some that don't seem to have that issue and that's just a smart move
[51:01.230 --> 51:03.150]  So to me land race
[51:03.150 --> 51:09.190]  It's it's it's an admission that you're allowing the region to dictate the reality
[51:09.550 --> 51:13.630]  hmm, and then we take it and then we we we move it so I
[51:13.950 --> 51:21.630]  It's kind of like a cultivated variety really because you're you're touching it land race is natural population to me where you're not touching it at all
[51:21.630 --> 51:23.230]  It's just growing
[51:23.230 --> 51:30.870]  But no land race that's been worked by humans is really to land race in the sense that it's natural population
[51:31.350 --> 51:32.870]  Steered population
[51:32.870 --> 51:39.150]  But it's accepting the fact that the region dictates the reality and they know they have to have enough diversity
[51:39.870 --> 51:45.510]  Because you've been growing in the same region for three four five six seven hundred years some of these places in Asia
[51:45.510 --> 51:47.510]  You know ten thousand years
[51:48.030 --> 51:54.930]  For real, so, you know and all that information got stolen from us from the drug war. So they take this
[51:55.850 --> 52:00.770]  Unbelievable we're talking about grape right grape has got a seven eight hundred year history on data
[52:00.770 --> 52:05.090]  So the Jesuits kept track of what vine work best where?
[52:05.690 --> 52:07.690]  Because they were growing wine for the church
[52:08.010 --> 52:14.770]  So when we're talking about Appalachians, what makes an Appalachian is the the what's the best vine for the location?
[52:14.850 --> 52:18.570]  What's the impact on the the vine from the location?
[52:18.570 --> 52:23.750]  And what's the cultural identity of the people in the area and how did that impact that total as well?
[52:24.190 --> 52:29.790]  With cannabis the wine groups are like well, you don't have this history and we're like no it's because they stole it from us
[52:29.950 --> 52:35.030]  We really got a fourteen thousand year history of recorded movement of cannabis
[52:35.990 --> 52:39.950]  So we do war for all these other products cannabis is this
[52:39.950 --> 52:46.710]  I don't think there's anything like it in human history that wove and it felt so well into the people and the problem
[52:46.710 --> 52:51.750]  Rug war for a hundred years stole it all they try to kill it all they demonized it
[52:51.750 --> 52:53.750]  They vilified it so much
[52:54.310 --> 52:58.390]  That you you took away the ability to share the information
[52:58.550 --> 53:01.910]  So people don't even know how to use cannabis in a homeopathic way
[53:02.590 --> 53:06.470]  Because all the data was stolen from us the usage was stolen
[53:06.590 --> 53:12.110]  So really what we're doing now is we're trying to kind of go back to me like we're back in the 1920s
[53:12.110 --> 53:14.110]  We're not we're not in 2022. We're in
[53:14.590 --> 53:20.070]  1920 we're back when the drug war really kicked in and that the shopping in the
[53:20.670 --> 53:23.710]  The the culling of the culture was began
[53:24.550 --> 53:29.150]  So we can at least understand how did people function with cannabis when it wasn't a problem?
[53:29.670 --> 53:35.030]  What was the what was the usage? How did you decide what to use for what purpose?
[53:35.310 --> 53:39.150]  what plants what lines had these specific impacts and
[53:40.590 --> 53:42.590]  We're really very
[53:42.790 --> 53:47.110]  Unintelligent, so we have all this incredible lab knowledge and science knowledge and
[53:47.950 --> 53:49.950]  Agronomic steering ability
[53:49.990 --> 53:53.910]  But you know when it comes to like how do you get the people to be able to use the product?
[53:54.150 --> 53:59.470]  Intelligently in a way that works for them in a sustainable method. I mean we're like little kids. Yeah
[54:00.510 --> 54:02.510]  internet and the
[54:03.030 --> 54:09.190]  International mailing and all of that is is has scrambled the genes more than anything
[54:09.270 --> 54:11.830]  And it's just something that we have to deal with being
[54:12.430 --> 54:17.230]  Human beings that are born in the space age or whatever we have a different
[54:17.990 --> 54:19.710]  pressure that's
[54:19.710 --> 54:22.850]  exhibited against the genetics and that would be the
[54:23.070 --> 54:28.570]  ease of sharing it around the ease of passing it around and and then people do the
[54:28.790 --> 54:33.510]  Pollen chucking and so basically I have to strip mine to find new genetics
[54:33.510 --> 54:38.190]  I'll get anything from out there, and then I'll grow it out, and if I see something that's positive
[54:38.190 --> 54:43.990]  I'll grow it out, and then I'll self it and then I'll grow about a hundred and fifty hundred and sixty plants of that and
[54:43.990 --> 54:44.750]  See what's in there
[54:44.750 --> 54:48.590]  And then I know what's under the hood and then I can start crossing it back
[54:48.590 --> 54:52.350]  Against some stuff that I have that I know what it is and then I can line breed it out
[54:52.670 --> 55:00.670]  But everything has been so scrambled like you get do-si-do and and and garlic breath and all these different ones that are around the same
[55:01.910 --> 55:05.550]  You know they're dancing around the same campfire. What do you think?
[55:06.110 --> 55:13.190]  Osi I mean, but you there they are do a degree, but they're also a direct result of people wanting them so like
[55:13.710 --> 55:16.990]  Fletcher I mean I know Fletch Mark I've right Fletcher's Fletcher's a
[55:17.590 --> 55:22.310]  Bright young dude. I'm not quite sure how old he is but for me fuck out as I get older everybody's young
[55:22.710 --> 55:24.710]  Yeah, so he's bright guy
[55:24.710 --> 55:32.550]  And what he realized was that what people wanted was they wanted a cookie gas hybrid because cookie isn't gas cookie goes more long
[55:33.110 --> 55:39.790]  Mm-hmm and so he realized that if I took this cookie cut and I laid my face off male into it
[55:39.790 --> 55:45.270]  what I would do is I would create something that was valuable at the time for people that was desirable and
[55:46.430 --> 55:52.830]  Without a question. There's probably more things hybrid eyes using do-si in that line and then anything I'll
[55:53.430 --> 55:55.430]  Because what Fletch did was Fletcher
[55:55.870 --> 55:59.030]  Fletch took his time when he does his work Fletcher somebody
[55:59.550 --> 56:03.710]  Respect in the the fact that he does his selection process
[56:03.710 --> 56:09.790]  Well, he's very discerning on what he likes and what he doesn't like and I I met a couple of his guys
[56:09.790 --> 56:11.790]  He works with they were shocked too
[56:12.030 --> 56:15.390]  So stuff like do-si is a creation
[56:15.870 --> 56:19.670]  Where he said hey, I'm gonna merge some gene pools and let's see what happens
[56:19.670 --> 56:25.270]  and what it did is it created something that was unbelievably effective because you gotta remember in the US we have a
[56:26.110 --> 56:28.110]  savage opiate issue, right and
[56:28.550 --> 56:34.070]  The only way you can use cannabis as a substitute for opiates is if it's really in a fuel profile it
[56:34.830 --> 56:40.750]  Those fruits and earth's just don't seem to give you the result you need in terms of like a narcotic effect
[56:40.750 --> 56:45.770]  But all few profiles work. So when you look at the United States, everyone's like you're fuel addicted
[56:46.990 --> 56:48.630]  Hypotenuse e addicted
[56:48.630 --> 56:53.350]  It's because we're drug addicted and when you got 30 40 50 million
[56:53.710 --> 56:58.230]  Functioning opiate addicts in the country and and and how many more are impacted by it
[56:58.590 --> 57:05.110]  It creates the the need for cannabis to be bred to fit the fact that people like that direction
[57:06.470 --> 57:08.470]  So I don't see it as a bad thing
[57:08.990 --> 57:13.870]  and I don't I don't really I love the idea that there's globalization because I I
[57:14.390 --> 57:20.550]  Work with people from around the world and all these other countries and I take stock from them and they say hey
[57:20.950 --> 57:22.950]  Here's genes from an
[57:23.190 --> 57:27.750]  Embattled area. We don't know how long these genes might last because we have
[57:28.470 --> 57:30.470]  political upheaval and
[57:30.830 --> 57:35.030]  we might have an eradication and all of a sudden, you know, these farms get wiped out and
[57:35.590 --> 57:39.590]  so what it does is I get access to the material and then I
[57:40.470 --> 57:44.470]  Open up the population and I sip then I run them indoor and outdoor
[57:44.990 --> 57:49.950]  So I can kind of get an idea and get some of the intersex issues out because indoor really seems to throw these
[57:50.110 --> 57:53.270]  Anything that's cultivated outside the indoor stress trips them out
[57:53.790 --> 57:58.510]  so I try to clean them up by just trying to remove as much of the intersex traits and
[57:59.270 --> 58:00.470]  then
[58:00.470 --> 58:06.390]  Not completely because some of that also brings in survivability. So you're just trying to reduce some of the issues
[58:07.190 --> 58:11.990]  Bring the population back together. I reproduce it and then I spread it out and
[58:12.590 --> 58:18.470]  What it does and I don't say I don't sell any of this shit all the reproduction work all the preservation work I do I do
[58:18.470 --> 58:19.550]  just
[58:19.550 --> 58:21.310]  so that I
[58:21.310 --> 58:24.110]  Can I can feel like I'm part of the world?
[58:24.110 --> 58:28.630]  I've been in my whole life and I'm trying to do something that I think is positive and
[58:28.990 --> 58:36.830]  And and positive for me as well too because I'm a consumer. So when you remove all the populations, there's no new material
[58:37.310 --> 58:40.510]  science doesn't create shit science studies and
[58:41.190 --> 58:48.390]  Then isolates refines and produces right? I mean most of the great scientific inventions are accidents, right? They didn't invent Viagra
[58:49.390 --> 58:52.430]  And I mean and like thank God I don't have to use the chicks. I'm still healthy
[58:52.430 --> 58:54.710]  But like for a lot of dudes, that's a big deal, right?
[58:55.230 --> 58:56.870]  Well, I wouldn't know
[58:56.870 --> 59:01.950]  They invent well, they came out of it was it was heart medicine that didn't work, but nobody would return it
[59:05.030 --> 59:08.230]  And they go whoa, it's it's it's making me strong
[59:08.750 --> 59:15.990]  So they go yeah how much money came out of the erectile dysfunction industry over an accident, right?
[59:16.510 --> 59:22.310]  So kind of I see science different because and I work with scientists brilliant as they may be
[59:22.910 --> 59:26.350]  They're there to isolate define refine
[59:26.910 --> 59:32.470]  Reproduce move forward and write a paper and get cited. Mm-hmm. It's a different type of
[59:33.590 --> 59:35.190]  desire
[59:35.190 --> 59:39.070]  So there's creation and then there's replication and
[59:39.870 --> 59:43.910]  You you have to be able to have enough people constantly working
[59:43.910 --> 59:48.070]  And I just think that when you start to take the stigma off of cannabis to where?
[59:49.390 --> 59:54.390]  Young kids can say hey mom weeds legal. There's no more stigma
[59:54.390 --> 59:57.610]  I want to know if I can put a tent down in my basement because
[59:58.350 --> 01:00:02.830]  Billy's dad got some seeds out of a out of a film vial from the garage and
[01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.670]  The we want to see if we can open them up
[01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:12.630]  If that was any other plant, no one would have a problem if it was anything no issues at all
[01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:17.310]  you as a parent you'd be ecstatic that your children are trying to explore the world and
[01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:22.110]  Find the truth for themselves but with cannabis because it is stigma. Holy shit
[01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.870]  Well now you have a radically different group and you're also
[01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:32.670]  Seeing a change in consumption because we're all from late least for me, you know, I'm from the cigarette era
[01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:38.150]  Right. So when I when I was a kid, I want to say like, you know over half the population was smoking cigarettes
[01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:43.790]  Now we're down to like, you know, 13 14 percent of America. I think I think that was like most recent date
[01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.790]  I saw it's low under 15
[01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.810]  So 15 percent of American cigarette smokers in traditional smoke
[01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.050]  I meet so many people that can't roll
[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:58.950]  Have never rolled and their introduction to cannabis was from vape because all tobacco all smoking is vape
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:07.310]  The tobacco vape is flavored it brought out the desire to bring fruit varieties back into vogue because nobody wanted them in the US
[01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:14.270]  All of a sudden people want fruit again because that's what they know from the mouth of the tobacco. They know they like pen
[01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.470]  pen means we steer the plant for
[01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:23.110]  production of its essential oils its metabolites versus its form and
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:27.230]  And there's nothing wrong with that. It reflects the reality
[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:32.030]  So if parts of Asia choosing it for hash because it's the only way you can store it
[01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.630]  parts of Asia are
[01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:39.950]  Producing it in flour because it's the only way you can store it. That means that they chose what was best for them, too
[01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:47.710]  so for us modern me the consumption it changes the the desirability of the product and
[01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:54.910]  And I'm fascinated by it. I don't think any I don't think there's anything that has to be held if you had a vaporizer
[01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:58.710]  It was like I had a discussion with someone about we were arguing this topic and they were like
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:05.010]  Michelangelo didn't use a jackhammer. I said he didn't fucking have one but he didn't use a wooden chisel either
[01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:09.710]  He used the best chisel that he had at the time if Michael
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:15.030]  I had a jackhammer he would have made 50 Davis because he would have chopped that shit even quicker
[01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:19.550]  Yeah, the tool the tool is a tool the artist is the artist
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.230]  To use better tools you can do more art. I
[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:29.270]  Don't I don't see the difference it's you have to look at timeliness and say look there's
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.830]  itionalist which is more like my thing
[01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:34.030]  Because I'm from that era
[01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:40.230]  but that doesn't mean that I believe everyone should have to comply with my thought process or my desires and
[01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:46.850]  So for me, you know when the industry started to change into you know, what it did in consumption
[01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:52.950]  I radically changed what I did my selections on so I was doing big plant population selections
[01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.590]  So we're doing you know 10,000 square foot canopy
[01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:01.790]  You know looking through place right now when I look at a population selection, it's 1500 plants per line
[01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:06.310]  So when I get brought in to do this, I go through these buildings with science groups
[01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:11.590]  And they have laptops and I just walk around and I find the outliers that interest me
[01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:18.830]  Then we go back and we discuss why I'm interested in them and and what's the important characteristics that we're trying to see?
[01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:24.430]  So what it does it allows them now to be able to start to determine how do we find that in the chromosome?
[01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:29.110]  How do we stabilize that in breeding and how do we start to bring together better projects?
[01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.150]  and so
[01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:38.510]  The populations but when I was doing some of these large operational population hunts it was for extract only
[01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:45.070]  Because I saw change it was 75% of the market was flower right now. California's 33%
[01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.030]  Flowers only 33%
[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:51.390]  Yeah over 61 is extract of some sort
[01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:58.750]  So you gotta remember people are changing what they consume you have to know how to roll the joint in order to smoke
[01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:01.950]  Why do you think they have 200 pre-roll packs in Canada?
[01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:07.670]  Yeah, cuz what none of us can roll a joint except for the master grower at the LP where I work
[01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.830]  I'm like, I'm old. So I mean I still I still I don't and I don't like crutches
[01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:18.630]  I don't like cardboard in my mouth people go. Whoa. I was smoking with someone that had never smoked a joint without a crutch
[01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.270]  Really?
[01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:25.150]  Shit, you could taste the weed different and and it doesn't mean it's better
[01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:29.410]  If you were brought into cannabis smoking with the crutch
[01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:31.110]  Then that's what you know
[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:37.750]  If you're someone who got I meet more people now than I've ever met that are only got into flower in the last two or three
[01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.830]  years
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:45.350]  Their whole career was based off the extract so they got in they grow cannabis breed it
[01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:51.830]  Select it wash it process it blow it any any either BHO propane
[01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:58.110]  Water hash was a dry sift if they're going that route. They're not rolling it and
[01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:05.470]  So you're seeing this evolution and to me I love it because the more diversity you have in an industry the more
[01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:11.430]  Satisfaction you have with the individual consumption the better it is
[01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:18.070]  And I I just don't dictate to the individual what they should and shouldn't do or shouldn't shouldn't like it's up to you
[01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.070]  You can't tell me what I'm supposed to do
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:26.010]  I had I had my first cold dab at the at the uni. It's like
[01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:29.830]  Wow, I didn't know there. There was that much flavor
[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:34.550]  Available. It's like whoa, that's a flavor parade
[01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:39.550]  It is and it's and it's it well and it's incredibly fast
[01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:46.110]  Oh, so with sit down and chip and now you have a high and I like concentrate
[01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:50.110]  And and I I'm somebody that like I I'm the oil gutter
[01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:55.030]  I mean we we moved an ungodly amount of concentrate in my career
[01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.150]  but
[01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:00.550]  for me personally on a daily basis
[01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:05.590]  Consumption in in flower form through a joint is my preferred method
[01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:12.750]  Mm-hmm. And and so it's because that's what I was raised on. That's what I know best when I'm evaluating flower
[01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.030]  That's how I'm doing it
[01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:19.150]  But if you bring me in to evaluate concentrate, I'm gonna smoke it as concentrate and if I do
[01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:24.270]  Concentrate evaluation what I have to do is I have to go and spend like a week prior
[01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:28.390]  Smoking concentrate to get my tolerance up so that I'm able to
[01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:34.710]  Mentally handle the concentration that I'm about to consume like, you know, you're gonna smoke through 20 samples
[01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:41.750]  Whoo, you gotta go for a ride. And so I have to kind of get my levels up so that I can then keep my
[01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:47.590]  my balance so that my shoe with my accuracy is on point and
[01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.830]  So be when I go to these conferences and I go to a lot of these
[01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:57.070]  Things that I'm involved with if depending on where I'm going and what we're doing if I'm going to a craft group
[01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.390]  I know there was gonna be an unlimited quantity of a
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.150]  quality phenomenal rosin right
[01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.830]  Know it so I have to go and go off shit
[01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:13.910]  And I got to spend a week before I go smoking down and I mean like I'm like blasted
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:18.350]  So I get my tolerance straight and then when I go to the event, I'm able to then
[01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:21.230]  evaluate and then communicate
[01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:27.590]  So that way we're able to work it and I just think that it's all for the end of what the individual wants and what they
[01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:28.830]  choose and
[01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.110]  There's there's a always a fight over what's right?
[01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:36.790]  And you know, like I said, I said my thing is I if I had my choice, it would only be
[01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:39.350]  biologically driven
[01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.870]  Sun-grown weed that I'd consume. I just love
[01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:50.390]  All the aspects aside of the fact that I think it's a you know, good methodology for the world on a selfish level
[01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:53.230]  ooh, it smokes best to me and
[01:07:54.230 --> 01:08:00.070]  I but I don't believe that everyone should have to follow that and I know that I see some indoor that's supernatural
[01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:07.270]  And I've smoked some salt grown that stand next to anything. So it isn't it isn't one method does it best?
[01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:14.190]  It isn't one one person does it best? It's really this acceptance that certain things shine under certain production
[01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.630]  technologies, yeah
[01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.550]  Like what they like and the younger generation
[01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:26.510]  We're always acting like the young generation doesn't understand like like we understood like somehow we were super geniuses when we were kids, too
[01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.870]  what they know is they know what they have in front of them and
[01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:35.350]  And for me as an older person, I try to I don't say I come down to their level
[01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:36.750]  So I don't think they're below me
[01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:40.910]  But I try to understand their level because it's different than mine
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:47.750]  And what it does it keeps me current so that I'm always aware of what's taking place and it lets me look at the picture
[01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:54.430]  And see where the potential for trends are. Yeah, and so the ability to be able to work intelligently in that regard
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:09:01.230]  Allows you to stay current or otherwise you're living in your your past and you're letting everybody know that you know
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:07.150]  It was this it was that and what happens is you become an antiquated dinosaur eventually, you know
[01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:11.470]  You you get called out the Tyrannosaurus doesn't exist. You could be a crocodile though
[01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.230]  and so
[01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:18.510]  Crocodile is where you want to be because they there's 80 million years old. They're still here
[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:24.590]  But the big predators got wiped out because they couldn't adapt they couldn't they couldn't make the change
[01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:31.670]  And I think that in what we do in terms of breeding genetic work and having a public platform
[01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:39.270]  What you want to be able to do is make it inclusive to say look the beauty of cannabis was it
[01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.390]  Doesn't create high judgment levels
[01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:45.190]  You get all the weed snobs and stuff
[01:09:45.190 --> 01:09:49.550]  I'm gonna smoke the finest shit and I'm like, I guarantee you smoke some bunk ass brick once in your life
[01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:53.110]  So just stop with that crap. Yeah, right. It is what it is
[01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.790]  but you may love her and all these other things but
[01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:02.670]  You have to be able to include everyone is equivalent as as as a
[01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:09.070]  Consumer and that people have different levels of expectation and people have different levels of access
[01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:15.590]  But the bottom line is everybody in the room is a human being and cannabis to me is the substance that makes that possible
[01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.590]  cannabis really I
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:25.030]  Got to work with so many different people that would never would have got together in the same room if it hadn't been for herbs
[01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.750]  so to me the
[01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:32.510]  Foundation of pot is that you're not a prick. Yeah, and I don't I don't worry about it
[01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:37.950]  well, and I think that you have to cultivate that so what it does it allows people who are 80 to
[01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.110]  to be able to smoke of people who are 18 and
[01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:48.310]  And they all get to figure out. Hey, you know, we're all gonna sit down and smoke together and you can both share the products
[01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:53.550]  But the young kid says man, I love this rosin pen and I'm digging it and I love it
[01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:56.390]  Why is he wrong why is she wrong
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:01.730]  Why is the old guy wrong for saying no, I love these hazes and I know they only come on
[01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:06.790]  I got a Cambodian only comes out of like 7% it grab you and give you a high that's unique
[01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:11.550]  But you have to be clean to be able to to enjoy it
[01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:17.630]  You can't be kind of clouded up on these ultra high varieties because it changes your receptor response
[01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:24.390]  So nobody's wrong or right you're you're wrong if you're telling someone else what they should be doing that
[01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:27.510]  You don't you don't have that privilege
[01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:33.350]  There's no omnipotent individual in the world of weed and every everybody to give themself a title
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:35.730]  They're the king it is it a king and I'm like you can't shit
[01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.190]  because
[01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:39.190]  In your kingdom, you know
[01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:45.190]  No, a loose band of renegades running freely through the world
[01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:50.110]  But the one thing we can be cool with this herb and and I love it, you know
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.990]  And then there's some cool shit going on, you know, it is
[01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:59.570]  And and it's controversial people gonna lose their mind over this one too, but cookies just put together their own
[01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.310]  seed platform and
[01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:10.070]  So cookie says hey with the ability to sell seed. Let's get together a seed platform. So what we can do is create a homegrower
[01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:17.270]  Explosion to where home growers can order seed and so they reached out to me and I'm putting together
[01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:23.790]  You know a section on that site and I think I got about 20 25 people that I reached out to that are all craft
[01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:29.110]  Operators so we can all kind of combine into one cluster and then utilize
[01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:36.710]  That platform to get the stock out because it allows you to get stock out next to these
[01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:41.030]  Monstrous companies with extreme branding same platform and
[01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:48.190]  What I want to be able to see is I want to be able to see thousands tens of thousands of small breeders
[01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:51.030]  develop their craft and
[01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.270]  If you're doing good work, and it's good. It's good
[01:12:55.510 --> 01:13:01.510]  Yeah, we need to encourage it. Otherwise we like we always talk craft craft craft and I'm like crap is
[01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.470]  a skill
[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:10.470]  It's a it's a it's an ideology but it's reflected in the touch when you're having to do something and how do you
[01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:13.490]  Create and promote craft if you're not doing it
[01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:17.990]  And so what you have to do is you got to be able to allow people to come in
[01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:20.550]  It's kind of like I don't have a beef with the word master grower
[01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:27.910]  Because if you were master diver your mass, um, all my family was craftsmen, right? So master welders
[01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:33.070]  Master electrician master plumber. It just meant that you were able to run a project
[01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:35.790]  supervise your
[01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:37.470]  journeyman
[01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:40.830]  Journeyman means that you're above apprentice. It means that you're able to operate
[01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.310]  independently without supervision
[01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:49.670]  But you don't have the skills to run a project and then apprentice means that you have to operate under supervision
[01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:55.910]  It caught up in this shit all the time because people use the word in a way that's you know
[01:13:56.070 --> 01:14:00.390]  Master grower and some people surely are I meet enough of them that I would say
[01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:06.670]  Oh your master grower you can make that shit happen all the time in every space you're in
[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.670]  Consistently you have a mastery of your craft
[01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:16.350]  Yeah, but everybody gets all traumatized over it and then I like no one's a master of anything and I'm like, oh, please
[01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:22.950]  If it's a craft you're a master of it you you in the NFL and you NFL running back. You're a master of running back
[01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.070]  Yeah
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.430]  Yeah
[01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:33.310]  So we have to be able to understand that and doesn't mean you put the phrase on but when we're talking about a craft
[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.790]  application skill set development application
[01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:38.590]  There's you enter
[01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:40.230]  you develop
[01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:42.230]  you're refined and
[01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:50.270]  And we have to be able to understand that and the the problem is that the masters the self-proclaimed masters don't understand their
[01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:56.830]  Responsibility that that is to develop the journeymen below them and and
[01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:59.190]  inspire the apprentice
[01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.870]  You want to be you they need to go damn
[01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:11.310]  That cats in the paint and without that. What's the incentive other than just pure and I'm like, yeah
[01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:14.150]  That's not that's only a portion of the population
[01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:18.990]  We want more people to get in so that what you have is a population
[01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:24.470]  Globally that can change cannabis laws change cannabis acceptance
[01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:26.790]  create
[01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:33.910]  Situations where you're able in yard to grow the product you needed to help out your grandmother with the FICO
[01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:35.630]  Because that shit's expensive
[01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:41.030]  But if I can grow my six plants and I can get 30 pounds off of them and I can take that and I can
[01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:47.430]  Steal it I'll get enough FICO to to actually put my great mother and another person through a full treatment plan
[01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:50.990]  At an affordable level free because basically
[01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:57.190]  done so my desires on this is I you know when I was young I get into this because I
[01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:59.750]  grew up in a crime zone and
[01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:05.070]  My family was an organized crime and I mean I there's there's nothing I haven't seen when it comes to crime
[01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:10.230]  The only people I saw that really were happy ironically was the drug dealers
[01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.550]  It seemed at best time because all the violent criminals
[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:19.430]  They're not happy by nature and the fact that you're willing to do violence for money and you're willing and you're able to
[01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:27.310]  Different personality, but the drug dealers were happy. So as a 12 year old the drug dealers in my neighborhood
[01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:33.830]  I wanted to emulate more than I wanted to emulate my family that was involved in in in robbery and organized crime
[01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:39.730]  And not that I didn't love my family members, but I was just like my personality just wasn't about beating you over the head with a gun
[01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:41.830]  so
[01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:48.870]  The the the herb, you know was up to me. They were happier. They were having a good life. And so that's what I saw and
[01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:55.430]  It wasn't until really I got into the medical cannabis, you know, like around 207
[01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.870]  But I really understood
[01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:02.110]  Cannabis in a way that changed me is that how many people really need it?
[01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:08.310]  For problems that they're relying on Western medicine for which create more problems
[01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:10.830]  And so once I started to understand
[01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:14.390]  this truth of cannabis from a patient perspective
[01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:21.750]  It let me understand that if we don't if we don't band together and work with this
[01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:25.350]  you'll never have the ability to provide it and so
[01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:30.590]  It you have to have this this situation where people at the very top of the food chain
[01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:33.670]  reach their hand all the way down the ladder and
[01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:39.390]  Shake the hand of the people that are coming in and just say hey I can give you a tidbit of advice
[01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:42.910]  I can I can acknowledge you as valid and
[01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.510]  And what it does then is it allows in it to feel?
[01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:54.110]  Inspired because they realize that in the craft. They're entering the people who are populating the upper tier are decent
[01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.510]  Otherwise, why?
[01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:59.630]  Yeah, like you like the money's not there anymore, right?
[01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:05.630]  Not like it was you can't be cracking it cash out like you used to you know out of out of a I was
[01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:09.590]  Telling somebody I said I I had relative just having a hard time
[01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:12.910]  I threw a one-light clone off in her in a spare bathroom
[01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:18.590]  Put one four by four tape with a thousand over it and it was given a four thousand a week
[01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:24.710]  So she went from being broke to making sixteen thousand cash a month off a single light Wow
[01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:28.550]  Yeah, so that was the glory days of the game and I was only ten bucks a clone
[01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:31.390]  But you know, I'm cracking up thousand cuts a week off of it
[01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:34.390]  16,000 a month
[01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.510]  Doing is it's it's or
[01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:38.830]  400 right so it's giving me 16,000
[01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:44.630]  But the point was a single light over four by four table in a relative
[01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.310]  abandoned bathroom
[01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:49.030]  Changed her life
[01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:52.590]  Well, it doesn't happen that like that now they stole that from us
[01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:58.190]  And have to be able to do is you can't use the money as the sole motivation
[01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.050]  Which primarily as much as people don't talk about it
[01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:05.070]  It was and what I was every time told me they're not about the money
[01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:07.630]  I'm always up with give me the power for 100 bucks and they're like
[01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:13.870]  I said you're about the money. Don't be ashamed. It's it's a job. It's okay, but be clear
[01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:19.630]  What was the motivation money was a big one and now the money's not there
[01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:24.710]  So what's the motivation and the motivation hopefully is that you love cannabis and that you
[01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:31.790]  Can find people in the industry above you that you want to behave similarly to you?
[01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:33.670]  Don't have to copy every damn thing
[01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:38.790]  But take the good parts from what you see and use that to create you
[01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:44.790]  Yeah, what you what you're able to do then is able to have a good healthy life for yourself
[01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:50.030]  And in that you're doing well for yourself and it's in a healthy sustainable manner
[01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:53.070]  How much can you ask from person?
[01:19:54.830 --> 01:20:00.190]  Just being a good human and and like doing the things that good people do like
[01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:05.710]  Sharing, you know, the you got to train your kids. Oh share with your sister or whatever
[01:20:05.710 --> 01:20:11.110]  I like the way the way I watch you at the at the unicorn Kevin and I watched how you
[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.150]  Interacted with the people you you interacted with
[01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:20.790]  Everybody you padded people on the back. You were given good words. That's what I'd like to see more in this business
[01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:25.630]  I've been on the business end of it, but I'm also on the human end of it because I'm retiring
[01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:29.110]  I'm getting out of it pretty much over the next couple of years and
[01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:35.210]  It's nice to see people come into that that doesn't look at somebody like what do they have to give to me?
[01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:40.430]  You were there to say well, what can I give to you? I'm encouraging you you're encouraging this guy
[01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:44.110]  I don't know but you spend a fair amount of time encouraging him and I thought man
[01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:48.150]  I think I want to be like that, you know to encourage people like that and
[01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.830]  hats off to
[01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:53.670]  to paying it forward because you know all of us got
[01:20:53.830 --> 01:21:00.070]  Every seed that I have was either in a bag or given to given to me by somebody and and I try to pay that forward
[01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:05.310]  Too but no, but you have a beautiful personality too. So I mean, that's why that's why I'm on the show
[01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.750]  Thank you under the buddies
[01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.430]  but when you reached out and said because we met there too and you
[01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:14.230]  Good thing and I hung out with you and I was like, oh you're a good dude
[01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:20.590]  and so it's it's nice to be able to sit down and we can talk and get some conversation out and I
[01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:23.910]  Think a lot of it is that you know, what happens is
[01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:29.090]  Like I never I I I'm somebody that was living in the shadows for 25
[01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:34.970]  26 years of like I was as corrupt as it gets I mean I was I was sparking up everything you could touch
[01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:43.230]  You know, I'm a multi-time felon right and and and and slid through a whole bunch of other ones. Yeah, so I
[01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:50.990]  Never desired fame right? Like I still can't believe I'm this well-known. It wasn't about me wanting to get popular
[01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.990]  it was the fact that I
[01:21:54.710 --> 01:22:00.550]  wanted to be able to bring information forward that people could benefit from because I'm like look if we're going into the new world of
[01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:03.190]  This all of and I think it's all of us that struggled
[01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:07.390]  We have a river of information to share about human nature
[01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:12.270]  about how people like just a lot of detailed information and
[01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:15.150]  I just realized that
[01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:19.110]  If I could do that, then that would be really cool
[01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:23.550]  it would it would allow put some value on the work and the struggle and
[01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:32.670]  It lets you meet people at their level and so for me like I just make myself available at every event where
[01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:38.990]  I'm just hanging out. I'm not really like I'm not networking. I don't I don't even like the word networking. We're networking
[01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:40.390]  I'm like look I'm just hanging out
[01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:45.950]  But if you walk up to me and you're polite really that's my criteria if you approach me and you polite and you're like, excuse
[01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:51.550]  Me, can I ask you a question? I'm like sure and I'll sit down and give you as much time as I have
[01:22:52.630 --> 01:22:59.070]  To answer the question because what you're trying to do is further it what I don't like is can I crawl in your pocket?
[01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:03.990]  Can I can you have me move I had this shit all the time. Can I come live at your house with you?
[01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:07.310]  I just want to follow you around every day. I had some dude hit me up
[01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:09.430]  at an event and
[01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:14.210]  He's like, hey, I'm letting you know that I came here to listen to you speak and I said awesome
[01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:18.050]  And he's like I also letting you know that I booked an extra day on my trip
[01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:21.070]  So that I could spend it with you and I said well shit
[01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:27.950]  I I have plans with my kids tomorrow, right and he's like no, that's okay. They won't mind I won't
[01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:33.110]  And they're in the background. I said listen, I said my kids a little there's no way
[01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:36.950]  they're not gonna notice some weird dudes standing in the background just staring and
[01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:41.330]  And he was upset that I wasn't allowing him to come live with me for the day
[01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:44.270]  And I said bro, I said I don't even know you
[01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:49.270]  And and so we don't have a prior history. You didn't ask and
[01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:54.990]  and the problem is you're trying to compete with my time with my kids, which you're not gonna win and
[01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:58.370]  It's just weird shit like that. It's like
[01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:03.990]  If you could if you could just be reasonable, then there's not much people won't do for you
[01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:07.050]  But when it's like hey when I do when I when I hear the other one
[01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:08.690]  I know you like to see people do well
[01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:12.310]  So I'm gonna send you all my business plans so you can review them and give me my tips
[01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:16.750]  I'll give them a quick I'll give them a quick bit of advice, but then it's like hey
[01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:20.750]  I'm gonna send my deck to you and I'm gonna send my team and
[01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:23.630]  Then we want to know if we can get your jeans that by the time I'm done
[01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:27.910]  I'm like I just built your business and I'm laughing and I'm like who does this? Yeah people
[01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:30.790]  And so as long as you're not
[01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:35.550]  Trying to abuse me. I'm about it and that's what I
[01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:41.350]  That idea with what we would call like they go, you know, you mess with no one's all the time and I'm like, yeah
[01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:43.110]  But they're no one to you
[01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:48.150]  But I know where I came from. That's right. I came I mean I came out of the hood
[01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:54.190]  So I have any rank either. I'm to me I represent blue-collar cannabis
[01:24:54.190 --> 01:25:00.670]  So I may have up but no matter what I do when I look in the mirror, I'm still blue-collar cannabis and
[01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:09.710]  That just means that then I'm not royal that that I'm just you I'm just more fortunate that I was able to stay alive long
[01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:12.110]  enough to get to where I am and
[01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:18.670]  What I'd love to see is I'd love to see all these young people old people anybody that's about it make it
[01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:22.450]  That
[01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:27.150]  That would be a wonderful legacy to leave, you know when people talk about legacy market
[01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:31.010]  I'm like this smokers legacy for Christ's sakes. They had to go same bullshit
[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:35.870]  We did so the legacy grower is no more noble than the legacy smoker
[01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:41.490]  It's back that you were all here on your free will you could have left you weren't forced to do this
[01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.370]  No one had a gun to your head
[01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:45.850]  so we were all the same in that regard and
[01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:54.450]  The ability to be able to share information and to be of service to the degree you can within reason
[01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:58.810]  It allows us within cannabis to have a really different culture
[01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.470]  Cannabis bars people aren't fighting beating each other up in the head
[01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:05.610]  cannabis deals typically to require guns
[01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:12.930]  Cannabis cultivation was something that like changes you because you're having to learn to work like all farmers
[01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:20.050]  With the thing that doesn't communicate with you. You have to pay attention to do the work. Mm-hmm, so I
[01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:23.290]  Just I just love to be part of it
[01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:27.090]  And I'm so grateful that I got to spend my my majority my life here
[01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:31.610]  That if I could be of service in that regard, I'm down, but I'm not
[01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:36.370]  I'm not I'm not I was tell people I said you don't want me at the helpdesk
[01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:39.570]  Where am I? I'm gonna tell you to shit together you cry, baby
[01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:44.490]  So I'm kind of honest about certain things so it's like within reason I'm cool
[01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:51.890]  But that's to me the human the line is that if you're pretty decent most of the time it works and if I'm decent
[01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:55.570]  Then what it does it lets people you know, you know, and you don't agree with what I do
[01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:59.210]  You don't have to agree with my direction. You don't have to agree with anything
[01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.690]  But if you find anything that you like in what I've done
[01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:08.850]  Please use it. Take it freely and you don't have to applaud me. You don't gonna tag me. You don't gonna thank me
[01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:14.130]  You're gonna do shit. I've been giving it up for years so that it's just I call it open source
[01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:20.610]  It allows people to benefit from the work. Otherwise, like how do you do this? How do you get people to benefit?
[01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:26.650]  When you make it impossible to get the information, how do we know who were inspiring?
[01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:29.530]  What if you and I in this conversation today?
[01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:35.770]  We just get somebody who's like man, I want to do that too and they change the world to weed
[01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:40.970]  Because they had the buying to do so but we put just the catalyst
[01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:44.050]  we're the ones that made the change that let them go in the room and
[01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:48.250]  And if if I don't even have to know that it happened, I don't
[01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:54.610]  The best charity is you don't know who received it and they don't know who gave it
[01:27:54.930 --> 01:28:01.050]  Mm-hmm. It's just pure people receive because they needed you give because you know, it's needed and
[01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:07.730]  There's and there's the person who received doesn't have to feel shame because they don't know who did it and the person who gave it
[01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:13.090]  Doesn't get to feel like I'm special because they don't know who got it for sure. And that's a that's a really
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:15.810]  It's not the normal way of looking at it
[01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:20.690]  But I'm telling you you live enough you you were raised in a meat grinder. You had a crawl to the goddamn game
[01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:25.170]  You have a different approach to this shit. That's why you don't see me attacking people online
[01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:29.090]  I don't really give a fuck what beef we got. I don't I don't get on you online come at me in person
[01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:31.090]  That's that's where you can play with me in real life
[01:28:31.410 --> 01:28:37.290]  But I don't ever get on stuff because what I know is that every time you the little snippy shit you get your little following
[01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:38.410]  of memes
[01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:41.570]  you're only following as people who like to talk shit and
[01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:50.130]  You're you're attracting people like you and the problem is is all you're doing is cultivating this this type of behavior
[01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.530]  Where's the value?
[01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:56.370]  What you providing other than pointing pointing pointing and I'm like, what do you point that?
[01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.690]  Yeah
[01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:00.850]  But I spend a couple hours a week
[01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:06.690]  Maybe a little more just talking to people that have sent me stuff on emails. It costs time to
[01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:12.170]  Pay it forward. I send out so many seeds and so many different things just to bless people
[01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:14.890]  I I have a strain that takes away a migraine
[01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:21.250]  My sister had migraines really bad and I hunted and hunted found one on accident. Here's the more the accident, you know
[01:29:21.250 --> 01:29:26.530]  Yeah, I make the greatest plan to find it and don't and then find one on accident. It'll take in migraine right out
[01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:30.550]  Well, I started trying it on people and it worked on so many people
[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:34.010]  I wound up giving away every bit that I had and didn't have enough
[01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:35.650]  I had to grow five plants this year
[01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:40.170]  Just so I'd have enough to give away and I've been giving away the seeds to everybody who's got migraines
[01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:46.030]  Because my sister she'd puke she'd get so sick. Yeah, she couldn't come out in the light, you know
[01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:51.910]  It was unbelievable and I got a strain that if you can they can feel a migraine coming on one or two puffs
[01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:55.170]  It's just like disappears. Yeah. No, it's I
[01:29:55.410 --> 01:30:01.970]  I'm work. I was working on a project for clients that uh, they asked me to create something for him that gave them a
[01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.970]  Good energy level but not too racy
[01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:10.730]  mind clear but not not not too scattered because they they're a
[01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:13.090]  Jiu-jitsu grappler, right?
[01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:18.450]  so they said I want I can smoke when I wrestle and roll that lets me like relax and have
[01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:25.490]  Softer body and clear mind and things that cannabis can give but it can't be too sedated. It can't be too racy
[01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:27.610]  So I go through and I find the product
[01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:32.170]  through up this I over the last like maybe say a year now, right and
[01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.530]  And I I find it. I find the one that has the impact that I like
[01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:40.790]  Well, oddly enough it has a weird as a weird thing where it makes your mouth wet
[01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:46.650]  So it's the opposite of cottonmouth. Really? Yeah, so I'm doing this for a client and like I'm it's all my work
[01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.450]  He's gonna receive the benefit from it in that regard
[01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:53.530]  but I meet a friend through a program involved in and
[01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:58.850]  It had mouth cancer and we were having a conversation. He was explaining to me about
[01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:05.670]  The Salvatore issue where they can't produce saliva the same so he has this perpetually dry mouth
[01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:11.450]  And I said to wait a second. I'm doing this project and I said just do me a favor
[01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:15.590]  Don't release it into the public because it'll screw me on what I'm doing
[01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:18.950]  but you're someone that has a specific problem and
[01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:22.990]  You don't realize that I just found something that would work for you
[01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:30.270]  And so I provided him the plant so that what they could do is they could cultivate it themselves produce their own medical product
[01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:34.350]  so that they it allows them to get around some of these issues and
[01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:41.990]  That was an accident. You know that the the the direction of the high wasn't what I I mean, I got what I wanted through
[01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:45.710]  Population then through selection and then through
[01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:52.150]  Population testing which means I had many people consume it and give me reviews so that it let me say
[01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:57.030]  Okay, the consensus of people got the benefit I'm seeking and it was in the right direction
[01:31:57.230 --> 01:32:00.750]  so I know that it would work for that purpose, but
[01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:07.390]  The the effect that I didn't look for the one that I did not seek was really cool
[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:13.870]  But I meet someone who's like man and they weren't asking me for anything was a conversation and I just said to him whoa
[01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:16.790]  I'm in a project right now. It's my jeans
[01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:20.310]  So but I'm gonna provide it but just don't release it into the public
[01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:25.870]  And you can have it and that way what it does is and if there's other people that are having similar situation to you
[01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:31.910]  I don't mind you shared it. Just don't throw it into a commercial operation to where I'm having to compete with my own shit. Yeah
[01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:39.350]  Yes, and then that's that's to me that's cannabis that I gave away more stock than anybody I've ever met I
[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:41.590]  mean
[01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:43.190]  ungodly like you I
[01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:48.470]  challenged someone to show up and tell me they gave away more plants than I have and it was out of it is because I
[01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:53.030]  Know that I'm making money or I was making money selling plants
[01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:55.310]  was
[01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:56.590]  Different it's a little different now
[01:32:56.590 --> 01:33:03.030]  You're building equity in your companies and stuff the days of cash flow where you're you're bringing the money in for you different
[01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:08.250]  So when I talk about making money, it was when we were making cash now is equity
[01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:15.470]  We're building brand value business value and we have to go through this this curve and then then we'll go back to making money again
[01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:19.530]  But right now it's like, you know, it's like the financial desert for all of us
[01:33:19.530 --> 01:33:25.550]  I mean, you know, you got pounds in California. You could pick up a pony. We're from like 250 to 400, right and
[01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:28.510]  You get indoors that illegal that are going to eight
[01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:34.910]  So how exactly is one supposed to make any money when a pound is 250 that's dumping
[01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:40.430]  Right. That's so it's just sheer dumping. I was looking at plants the other day a nursery was selling plants
[01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:44.830]  They sent me the list and it was one gallons for like 10 bucks
[01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:50.310]  I swear to God this thing was like 24 inches tall and filled a full
[01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:55.170]  Square foot of space you could have cut 20 clones off of it
[01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:57.990]  10 bucks
[01:33:57.990 --> 01:34:02.830]  You're dumping. There's no way you can produce stock with it
[01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:08.370]  It's not nursery stock because nurseries can do that because that's my background is nursery, right?
[01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:14.650]  you can't produce these things in cannabis that cheap because the licensing and the
[01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:18.070]  Compliance and the lack of chemical assisters
[01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:20.670]  require labor
[01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:25.710]  I'm you're done. Don't tell me you're making any money on that shit. What you're doing is you're just
[01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:28.550]  Bleeding the death and trying to survive
[01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:30.990]  so
[01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:35.990]  What we what we need to do is we need to be able to create like I said this huge matrix of people all over
[01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:38.270]  the world that are operating and growing and
[01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:40.590]  functioning
[01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:42.930]  So that you're able to provide
[01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:49.550]  Assistance to those that have need and at the same time benefit from your work if you have things that have value
[01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:56.990]  It isn't it's never bad to have cash flow. Mm-hmm have to be it's from my heart. I do it for the plant
[01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:58.750]  I'm like you're doing it for free
[01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:03.870]  No, I said, all right, then you're doing it for yourself and the plant just happens to be the vehicle you use it
[01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:08.430]  I wrote a do it. I threw a cartoon of this beautiful cannabis woman and
[01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:13.590]  All over it was all these lazy-ass dudes and she was throwing them off saying Christ
[01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:16.510]  You've been riding my back for the last 40 years get a fucking job
[01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:20.510]  Because nobody's doing shit I'm about the plant
[01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:26.150]  No, you you use the plant to make money and now that she's not making you any money. It's the screaming fit
[01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:28.430]  Yeah, oh I was laughing
[01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:34.150]  I'm like to me cannabis reminds me of a gal who's got a lazy dude and she's telling him get off the fucking couch and
[01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:38.110]  Get a job. Yeah, all the all these investors that are saying it's about that
[01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:46.430]  The plant have had such a freaking haircut lately that that they're bald. Oh, they getting trimmed
[01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:49.030]  Yeah
[01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:53.030]  It and it's not that I want to see people fail
[01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:59.370]  What I love is that you didn't take over the industry in the way you wanted to
[01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:04.270]  Where most of these bigger operators petition for no home grow?
[01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:11.830]  bigger operators of whispering in the as the regulators are making impossible for anybody to function at any level other than
[01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.910]  Ungodly investment. So what you have is you got this
[01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:19.830]  Monopolistic oligarchic
[01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:25.710]  Mentality and I'm like look it's it's I understand but in order to do that
[01:36:25.710 --> 01:36:30.710]  You have to be really a sociopath, right? You have to have zero emotional connection to anybody
[01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:34.950]  So when you want to be the number one either there most of them are sociopaths
[01:36:35.190 --> 01:36:41.430]  Look at Musk and I'm like, you know, I mean brilliant. He may be let me get this straight
[01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:45.990]  Every everyone in the company has to sleep on the floor of the business
[01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:48.070]  Like that's normal
[01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:52.390]  You got you have to give up your life if you want to work in my business and I'm like
[01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:56.630]  Oh, let this guy trip on the fucking stairs and break his neck because this is this is some bullshit
[01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:59.030]  You're creating a reality
[01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:03.390]  That is so unhealthy for the participant
[01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:06.390]  We worked less when we were hunter-gatherers
[01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:10.910]  You averaged like four or five hours a day of struggle you woke up
[01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:15.070]  You ate the scraps from the feast the night before you took some water
[01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:20.630]  You went out and you gals and the kids gathered and made the men went out and killed some shit
[01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:25.350]  You brought it back. You prepped it up you ate you got a fire going in the cave
[01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:28.610]  So you could keep the bear out and you woke up and did it again?
[01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:34.150]  so when you're in a situation with no safety net you're having to fight bears out of your cave and
[01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:41.710]  You're working four hours a day and you're in 2022 and you got the world's richest, dude
[01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:46.510]  Well, I think Putin's the richest dude, but you've got the richest dude that declares his money
[01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:52.470]  Saying that it I need you to work 80 hours a week or you just get out of here
[01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:57.750]  And I'm like, it's easy for Elon to work 80 hours a week. He's clocking a billion a day
[01:37:57.910 --> 01:38:00.310]  So I think it's a little different, right?
[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:04.770]  So like I'll sleep in the goddamn mud if you told me you're gonna give me a hundred grand a day
[01:38:05.410 --> 01:38:08.230]  Like there's a motivation where it's worth the struggle
[01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:14.750]  But when it's just a job and you expect people to cut off their hand just to participate
[01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:17.390]  How does that work for anybody right?
[01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:24.270]  So this idea that we serve the money master where more money is gonna make it better and I'm like get sick
[01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:29.430]  Tell me about it. I got plenty people that fucking died prematurely. I know what it's like to get sick
[01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:32.830]  I know it's like that family members get ill where all of a sudden they were there in front of you
[01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:36.390]  They're fucking going so where the money a Steve Jobs
[01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:41.350]  They always put that quote with Steve Jobs where he said all this profound shit. He was a fucking sociopath, too
[01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:43.350]  He didn't say that shit that quote isn't even his
[01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:49.970]  He didn't give a fuck. He was a brutal brutal dude. They didn't even acknowledge his kids
[01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:58.150]  And I'm like, I'm glad that he's a visionary and he can see the future of technology and he changed the world. Holy shit
[01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:01.670]  Did that save him from dying?
[01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:06.830]  No, did he die miserably like everyone else who gets horrific cancer does yeah
[01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:09.150]  Right. There's no difference
[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:13.470]  So the point is this idea that you're gonna make so much money you're gonna get out of the game and you're gonna get to
[01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.950]  Do this thing?
[01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:16.790]  I'm like, that's nice and then you find out you got stage four lung cancer
[01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:22.070]  Because running the medical dispensaries for all the years I have taught me that one thing
[01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:25.350]  that people would come in to speak to me that I'd even know and
[01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:28.230]  They'd be like I need to talk to you and I'm like, alright, let's go my office
[01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:29.630]  And I'm like, what do you want to talk about?
[01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.270]  and in my mind
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:37.070]  it's a business deal and they're like I just go back from the hospital and I only have like maybe two months to live and
[01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:44.150]  I'm like in your and and you're you're here to talk to me why and they're like, I don't even know who to talk to
[01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:47.110]  I don't know how to tell my family and
[01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:51.270]  I just I just don't know what to do. And and I
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:55.370]  Was just hoping me and I'm like man. I said I'm down you can sit here and chat
[01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:57.370]  You can hang out you can come here every day if you need to
[01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:05.410]  And just let me learn the lesson that no matter what you do you're not in control and so this idea of
[01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:11.130]  Perpetual monetization of everything because at the end of your life, you're gonna enjoy it
[01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:16.810]  Yeah, you walked out the house and you slipped on the step. My babe one of my friends one of my dad's friends
[01:40:18.130 --> 01:40:20.130]  special forces in Vietnam
[01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:26.930]  Gets shot down in a helicopter shot up survives prisoner of war camp in Vietnam, you know Tiger Cage
[01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:28.810]  in a river
[01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:33.330]  Survives all of that breaks his fucking neck at the restaurant. We go to dinner
[01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:36.610]  Stumbles over the curb falls breaks his neck
[01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:42.510]  He survives all this horrific shit in life and then fucking dies in a parking lot of a restaurant
[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:44.650]  And as a kid, I was like, whoa
[01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:53.090]  You just don't know and so what you have to be able to do is make this reasonable. It has to have a balance
[01:40:53.610 --> 01:40:54.650]  Yeah
[01:40:54.650 --> 01:41:00.090]  Substance that for most people that makes you go. You know what I was gonna go do that, but then I got high
[01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:03.370]  And I'm cool
[01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:08.850]  And then and people jam on the stone are saying no ambition. You're not driving forward. You're not a good capitalist
[01:41:09.170 --> 01:41:11.770]  but I'm like and who defines that and
[01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:17.530]  So, you know every one of these guys is gonna go down Jeff Bezos is gonna get buried in a body
[01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:22.950]  It could cry a general they'll freeze him too maybe but the bottom line is he's gonna die too
[01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:25.970]  Nobody escapes that
[01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:29.370]  Quality of life
[01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:36.970]  Before the end of it the period at the end. It's the shit you do in between the period that dictates really your life and
[01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.130]  Being involved in cannabis is let me have this incredible
[01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:43.570]  understanding of
[01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:45.570]  What it feels like to have
[01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:53.570]  Friends what it feels like to have a common community in a way that was non prejudicial
[01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:58.530]  Non-judgmental because it's your group. Yeah, and that most people right now
[01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:04.290]  They're just lost and they're lonely and they wouldn't be on social media talking so much shit
[01:42:04.730 --> 01:42:09.830]  If they were happy, you don't get on you don't troll all day all damn day if you're happy
[01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:13.490]  I look at somebody's shit cats comment and they they come at me right and I laugh and I'm like
[01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:16.410]  It's three o'clock in the morning. You're in your mother's basement, homie
[01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:21.130]  You get out of your mom's basement put down put down the Cheetos and
[01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:23.890]  and get off the Mountain Dew and
[01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:30.530]  Go get a life and you'd be a lot happier because you won't care what I'm doing you not looking at anybody else
[01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:36.890]  I never said I'm not trying to compete with you. I'm just trying to stand next to you. I
[01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:41.610]  Don't need to be better than you. I'll never be better than you. I can't be better than you
[01:42:41.610 --> 01:42:45.370]  We're both human beings. There is no better or worse, right like in the
[01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:51.410]  fundamental construct if you get that in your mind your life is radically different
[01:42:54.570 --> 01:43:00.570]  I've seen some huge egos and when it comes to seed breeding. I'll tell you I've never seen more
[01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:04.490]  I mean the everybody thinks you're the Gordon Ramsay of
[01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:10.250]  Genetics these days. It's like it's almost it's almost funny if it wasn't so sad
[01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:15.850]  Oh totally there there there there meant there there Gregor Mendel and Luther Burbank rolled into one
[01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:18.970]  cover inheritance
[01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:23.770]  But we pioneered big population work to know I same thing all the years I was in cannabis
[01:43:24.170 --> 01:43:28.490]  Everyone's always flexing on this shit. I'm like look I mean I cracked my first seed
[01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:33.110]  It was it was the cusp of the 80s so late late 79 80 right first first seed
[01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:36.850]  I'm plugging clones at the end of the 80s and
[01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.770]  And I was always doing propagation and reproduction
[01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:47.950]  But like I said, my mom was a research geneticist. So it lets me kind of get a pretty good fucking idea what?
[01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:57.130]  Genealogy looks like through the hands of a professional so I gave myself that title because I didn't I
[01:43:57.770 --> 01:44:00.690]  Didn't see myself in that regard. I always said look
[01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:04.330]  I'm a preservationist which means and people don't understand that either like what does that mean?
[01:44:04.330 --> 01:44:08.530]  That means that I take old stock and I try to hold it and I spread it out
[01:44:09.010 --> 01:44:13.690]  so what it does it allows us to keep a living gene pool spread by many and
[01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:17.610]  No, I don't keep tabs on you and control what you do. I just say look
[01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:22.470]  Here's some really killer shit. You seem to be into it. Do your best to hold on to it
[01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:24.290]  There's other people that have it too
[01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:29.370]  But if you're gonna get rid of it try to get a copy to someone else so that it'll come back all trends come back
[01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.370]  Takes like 10 12 years and the trend comes back
[01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:36.390]  So right now we're in purple purples coming out purples on the down stroke, right
[01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:43.570]  But purple comes in everybody goes into vogue people get tired of anthocyanin flavored weed because purple is a color, but it's a flavor
[01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:46.130]  Yeah, so we get out of the purple
[01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:48.970]  we go back into the green then we're gonna go through the green phase and
[01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:56.050]  Nothing purple will sell and then all of a sudden purple get hot and everyone will go man. I missed that legacy gelato
[01:44:56.690 --> 01:45:00.450]  Because it was it was a foundation plant for them then
[01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:01.410]  and
[01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:08.130]  So each cycle each generation has the work that they were introduced to it's what they liked when they get older
[01:45:08.130 --> 01:45:14.210]  They're like man. I wish I had that gelato 41 cuz I just loved it and it's what was my jam. No one kept it and
[01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:22.850]  So the ability to take things and hold them and move them so that what you have is this living population that reflects the consumptive
[01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.970]  patterns of
[01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:26.970]  decades around you is a
[01:45:27.090 --> 01:45:31.270]  Is a beautiful thing to have so that's what I mean by preservation
[01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:36.690]  and I I do the genetic collisions where I put stock together that I like and
[01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:41.290]  Sometimes when I open them up, I find out the male really was state because you got to test the progeny
[01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:46.270]  Once I see what I did. I like hey, that's pretty stable like, you know
[01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:52.190]  85% are almost clones and then there's a percent outlier group. That's a line
[01:45:53.150 --> 01:45:57.870]  Out of times it's really hunting where I know that if I open this population up
[01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:02.270]  I'll get the outlier I want because I'm not trying to move it as a seed line
[01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:07.470]  I'm looking for a clonal variety to enter into a specific market for a specific purpose
[01:46:08.190 --> 01:46:15.510]  Maybe with a specific chemotype to I have the cherry pie the year the year after cherry pie came over came out
[01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:19.850]  I self did and I have it. It's like test at 20 21 percent
[01:46:20.530 --> 01:46:24.010]  Which is a higher testing of the older cherry pies and it's got
[01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:29.490]  Four to five percent CBG in it. It is so calming and I have it from a clone
[01:46:29.490 --> 01:46:31.970]  That's 20 some odd years old. Hey, that looks familiar
[01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:38.250]  Every pie. Yeah, I know I grow there. I yeah, I get it back in my table. This is
[01:46:38.770 --> 01:46:43.690]  From this year, right? I love cherry pie. And what I like about cherry pie too is that for people who don't want
[01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:47.730]  To be overly like socked out from the herb
[01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:53.930]  It's nice because the mouth is excellent the nose is excellent I like the balanced high and
[01:46:55.130 --> 01:46:59.010]  Can't handle high potency where it trips them out. It's one
[01:46:59.810 --> 01:47:04.290]  But the bottom line is same thing Ron you open up populations you dig for unique stuff
[01:47:04.570 --> 01:47:10.490]  But you've been doing this for a minute. This isn't your first rodeo. And so for you you're like, hey
[01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:14.090]  I have the ability to seek what I want
[01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:19.650]  Because I've been doing this long enough to know so like for me I'm going back into all these
[01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:23.170]  I'm going back into the shit from the 90s, right?
[01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:28.210]  so all the the the the lines that were available in the early 90s that would take you and
[01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:31.010]  Then they were brought into the Holland and then they were moved out
[01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:38.410]  Yeah, starting to reach in and regrab some of these pieces because that's my youth, you know, I mean I
[01:47:39.170 --> 01:47:41.170]  Was in my 20s by that point
[01:47:41.410 --> 01:47:45.570]  But you know what they think but six to one of 66 so
[01:47:46.090 --> 01:47:49.170]  It wasn't my childhood. My childhood is
[01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:51.890]  Colombian Afghani Thai
[01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:58.610]  Mexican from the source and go into those populations and that takes me back
[01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:01.090]  but the 90s is
[01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:05.730]  When you know you're I was really getting into it in terms of like me being a man
[01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:10.010]  Growing out all my own shit and grinding and doing the thing and I'm like
[01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:13.130]  I just missed some of those directions and I missed some of the profile
[01:48:13.130 --> 01:48:17.650]  So I've been digging through all this work and reconnecting with people that are in my same age bracket
[01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:22.450]  Because I'm not really worried about the marketability of it
[01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:26.310]  It's something that I want to produce for myself so that when I'm at my home and I smoke it
[01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:31.490]  I'm like man, this is make I miss shit. That makes me laugh. Hmm. I miss stuff. That just makes you happy
[01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:35.330]  I don't need I don't have pain issues
[01:48:35.730 --> 01:48:38.790]  I don't have and thank God I don't have an opiate addiction because
[01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:44.810]  Heroin and all that shit scared me to death as a kid because I saw what looked like in the neighborhood and I never played
[01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:50.370]  With it. So I never got into pills. I never got into the opiate end of it
[01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:56.210]  And and so I like narcotic cannabis because I liked I need it to set me down at night
[01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.730]  but during the day I
[01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:01.770]  Would love to be able to get that uplifting boosty weed
[01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:06.490]  Anymore and someone's like, oh you need this sativa esque thing and I'm like no you're missing the point
[01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:13.250]  It's not a name or a direction. It's an effect. Yeah, it used to be in a lot bigger abundance
[01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:15.650]  When you didn't have COAs
[01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:18.290]  Dictating the reality of a sale
[01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:21.530]  Started to say the numbers matter
[01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:23.810]  all of a sudden
[01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:27.730]  Numbers that that yeah, they do but in conjunction with other numbers
[01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:32.250]  You're not looking at and so for me, it's like I I know that a pretty foot is nice
[01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:35.670]  But if that's the only thing you're looking at when you're picking your wife
[01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:39.970]  You might you might be making a bad choice. Yeah, she's got a gorgeous set of toes
[01:49:40.930 --> 01:49:46.330]  The rest of her is an absolute train wreck and same for men, you know, it's the woman goes. Oh, he's got a great mustache
[01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.330]  Yeah, but um, he's a psychopath
[01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:50.730]  You have to look at the whole picture
[01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:53.050]  vision and
[01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:57.330]  With COAs we steer by like such a minor minor
[01:49:58.370 --> 01:50:01.450]  Point that it completely wipes us out
[01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:06.990]  from having any diversity and all the customers that buy
[01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:12.450]  So many of them are unsatisfied because I just wish this they sold the stuff that used to sell
[01:50:12.450 --> 01:50:15.010]  and it wasn't that long ago the
[01:50:15.210 --> 01:50:20.810]  Dispensaries were able to take from people in the street and you'd have to run through a lab make sure it was clean
[01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:27.010]  But they would say here's three pounds of this over the course of a fiscal year that person might only produce
[01:50:27.450 --> 01:50:29.450]  12 pounds of that
[01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:33.130]  but they got paid for it, so it made it able to done and
[01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:39.650]  They got to put the work that they liked in and because the total canopy was small enough
[01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:44.850]  You weren't overpopulating and then having waste and then having your investors say no more of that
[01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:48.090]  you were able to sell the 12 pounds and
[01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:53.650]  That's what we we went wrong and we went into the situation now where if you can't sell
[01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:56.570]  200,000 pounds it's not worth it and
[01:50:57.490 --> 01:51:05.290]  How many people are unhappy most or you wouldn't see such an incredible resurgence in homegrown and still?
[01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:07.290]  illicit market
[01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:12.890]  Illicit market is a competitor at all. The competitor is the regulator and you politicians
[01:51:14.210 --> 01:51:16.210]  Yeah, that's what you compete against
[01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:21.050]  That's the enemy the enemy used to be the police and the helicopters and now it's the
[01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:23.730]  Laws and the way to do it. Yes
[01:51:23.730 --> 01:51:28.850]  I mean I had someone asked me someone came by and asked me if I could look at an operation for him as like a
[01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:30.010]  friend right and
[01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:32.050]  And I was with the business partner and they were like
[01:51:32.610 --> 01:51:34.650]  That person has a legal operation said no
[01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:39.210]  They got a phone up over at the house and they just got a question and he's like well
[01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:43.490]  You have a legal operation said I know and he's like well, why are you helping him?
[01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:46.970]  Because of my neighbor and he's like do you make any money on I said no
[01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:54.330]  Then what's the point? I said because it's my neighbor. I said so like if my neighbor does better. I have a happier neighborhood and
[01:51:55.890 --> 01:52:00.810]  It's almost like when you have to explain this to people it makes me look at you like holy shit
[01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:08.530]  We're that petty competitive where only you can be at the top and I'm like there is no fucking top
[01:52:08.730 --> 01:52:10.730]  that's the problem and
[01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:12.530]  it
[01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:18.970]  There it's it's it's there there dots and movements. You even look at the wealthy right fucking Amazon
[01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:22.010]  They just lost a trillion dollars in market cap, right?
[01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:26.250]  Zuckerberg, it just wiped out like a hundred billion in his money
[01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:32.890]  the so they were up the down they're up to down like there is no top it moves and
[01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:35.370]  What I want is I want to be in that
[01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:41.650]  Range where it's a pretty good life and there's moments that are incredible and there's some moments that suck so that you
[01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:47.610]  Get to appreciate the incredible right without pain. You can't understand pleasure
[01:52:48.090 --> 01:52:54.370]  Otherwise comes a constant and too much pain and you brokenhearted and so you need inspiration
[01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:59.530]  You need to have something and I think with cannabis and the way we can operate within it
[01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:07.650]  We have an ability to create a really interesting humanity as long as we understand the that you're responsible for your own self
[01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:12.770]  But if you need a hand it's there but if you want to take the whole arm
[01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:16.130]  I can't give it to you and then for us certain levels
[01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:20.810]  You need to make sure that you're not so busy looking at your world. You look back behind you and go
[01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:25.130]  Oh, wait a minute. Let me open the door and let others come through. That's right. It's
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:30.270]  And people say this shit all to my haters all the time, but I'm like show me your fucking track record
[01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:34.610]  Without it. There's none and and it allows you to say look
[01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:38.170]  There's a history and there's so many of us like I'm just someone who's public
[01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:43.450]  But there's and all the people I hang out with I love because they're good people
[01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:50.290]  Friend group is diverse, but it's because the once the one common factor they're good people
[01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:55.090]  That I know that like if my car broke down and they come over pick me up
[01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:59.850]  If they if they asked me to watch the kid for the day, they'd know I would keep an eye on the kid and be safe
[01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:07.490]  It's like it like that man, it's a human condition and cannabis magnifies multiplies intensifies that
[01:54:07.810 --> 01:54:13.530]  Relationship use correctly and and use correctly meaning whatever is best for you you make the decision
[01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:17.810]  But when you're using cannabis right for you, usually your life's better. Yeah
[01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:24.330]  Yeah, I I'm definitely a big big medical proponent because I got a thing called peripheral neuropathy
[01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:28.370]  It's if you stood in in a bucket of ice water
[01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:32.330]  For about a half an hour your feet would feel like they were on fire
[01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:37.450]  You'd just be crying and that's that's the way it is and when I'm up and walking around it's not so bad
[01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:39.810]  But when I lay down to go to sleep, I can't sleep
[01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:46.090]  But I found a cannabis strain actually a couple of them that do a decent job and one of them. That's absolutely great
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:49.090]  And it's just caught I call it blue citrus
[01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:54.570]  It's got a little bit of a citrus flavor and you mentioned gelato 41 blue gelato 41
[01:54:54.570 --> 01:55:00.010]  it's a strain that I have and I've had it for some time and I have it in seed form and in clone form and
[01:55:00.650 --> 01:55:03.730]  And that's in it and without that without that
[01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:08.970]  I would not sleep in literally two three hours at a time as all the sleep I ever get
[01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:14.530]  Before when I had it straight because I'd wake up and have to stand around and do jumping jacks
[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:16.370]  And now I sleep right through the night
[01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:20.410]  I don't even wake up to take a leak which is at 65 years old. That's pretty
[01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:27.570]  Good thing. Yeah. No, that's it's you gotta find it's it really is that's that's homeopathic medicine
[01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:32.890]  They took it away from us. They buried that shit. Anybody who brought it out was a hat was like, you know
[01:55:32.890 --> 01:55:34.890]  You're a you're a laughingstock
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:40.450]  It people worship at the altar of science all the time and I'm like look science is what it is
[01:55:40.450 --> 01:55:44.330]  It confirms things if it hasn't been scientifically proven. It's not real. I'm like, alright
[01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:47.690]  What I learned from my mother was a super genius that the bee flies
[01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:50.290]  Like can't quite understand why?
[01:55:50.690 --> 01:55:52.690]  So when you learn that when you're five
[01:55:53.170 --> 01:55:58.630]  Having someone who's brilliant scientists saying we only do what we do. Don't don't worship this shit like it's
[01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:05.690]  The end all be all of all things. It's it's almost like religion. You start to get caught up in this higher power and
[01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.370]  You're like wait a minute
[01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:15.170]  Let's put it into reality in the way we can and get the context and say it's if we follow some of these doctrines
[01:56:15.170 --> 01:56:17.770]  It's best to behave. Well, it seems to work best
[01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:22.730]  Science says it's best not to assume if we could prove it be better
[01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:29.490]  But until they can understand it, they can't quantify it and cannabis due to the complexity
[01:56:30.370 --> 01:56:37.650]  There's too many things moving at once. So you have an equation you're trying to solve with a thousand variables and
[01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:42.650]  As they as they uncover each individual variable they say this is what this does
[01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:48.950]  Yeah by itself in isolation in a vacuum, but combined in synergy it behaves different
[01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:56.810]  Body some muscles are working in one direction and when you do something different it goes from prime mover to stabilizer
[01:56:56.810 --> 01:57:02.410]  So is it a prime mover in that regard? Yes, and then we change context. It's a stabilizer
[01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:05.170]  So you have to look at the big picture
[01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:10.350]  Always first and then you can kind of start to see the small details
[01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:17.630]  But the bottom line is an individual consume something and it says this works for my issue. I have incredible relief
[01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:23.610]  No one's no one's qualified to tell him it doesn't because they're saying I had the problem
[01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:26.730]  I no longer the best example is I
[01:57:27.370 --> 01:57:30.330]  was in a debate the other day about cannabis green juice and
[01:57:31.090 --> 01:57:37.090]  The idea was that the levels of THC acid and the other other other acid forms of cannabinoids
[01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:39.810]  President is so low that it can't work
[01:57:40.410 --> 01:57:44.890]  And I'm listening to other people debate this and I'm like and any of you have any experience at all
[01:57:44.890 --> 01:57:50.450]  No, and I'm like look, I'll make it real clear. I ran the largest juice in operation in the country
[01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:53.930]  What I know is that I saw thousands of people have
[01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:59.570]  Ugly benefit in so many different ways that it's impossible for it to not work
[01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:07.250]  That just because your lab doesn't measure it in a way that shows what it does. It's a placebo effect
[01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:12.730]  I'm so yeah, so thousands of people are having a common placebo effect in many different directions and
[01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:19.290]  Quality of their life changed so well over time that it's still a placebo
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:23.970]  It's because people can't believe anything can be real until they can prove it
[01:58:24.690 --> 01:58:30.170]  Because you want to make sure you can monopolize the knowledge and with homeopathic medicine
[01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:35.030]  It's the fact that we know these things have the ability get them into people. Let them find what works
[01:58:35.410 --> 01:58:42.890]  Let them determine their own direction their own quantity of consumption. Let them sort it out to fit their specific needs
[01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:49.170]  There's no way to debate it works or it doesn't work their quality of life increased dramatically it works
[01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:55.170]  The juice and shit was killing me because I'm sitting there arguing people and I mean that people are getting emphatic about
[01:58:55.610 --> 01:58:59.970]  This thing I was just like look, I'm I'm not here to flex on you
[01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:06.230]  But I doubt any of you in the in the debate have ever even thrown a leaf in a blender
[01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:08.730]  And I was producing this shit by the barrel
[01:59:09.330 --> 01:59:10.690]  So
[01:59:10.690 --> 01:59:15.090]  Different levels, you know, and I'm just like look what I know is I saw a miracle occur in front of me
[01:59:15.090 --> 01:59:20.450]  And I just said that shit's real. I don't know fan leaves or do you juice the the buds?
[01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:26.210]  Fan leaves just get they just get the acid someone said but there's no cannabinoids in it. Well, there's something in it
[01:59:26.210 --> 01:59:28.370]  That's doing some miraculous shit. I know that much
[01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:37.010]  Ron but the buds were ineffective in juicing and it'll create a situation where you have to take the plant to fruition the juice
[01:59:37.450 --> 01:59:44.490]  Where keep the plant in a vegetative state you were able to really run crop after crop off the same plants
[01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:52.690]  and I did all this R&D on how much was required to get a patient into usage and how much do you need to grow and
[01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:58.290]  Best of efficient can we make it and what we found was that you know
[01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:04.810]  Leaf is fine. And then I did all these degradation studies with labs on statistical change in
[02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:12.650]  Quantum in quality from a lab perspective and we saw no appreciative difference whatsoever over a six-month freezing period
[02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:15.330]  I think we did a baseline and then every month I tested
[02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:22.950]  Six months of freezing not a single issue and then the beauty of it was I had a river of patients that said hey
[02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:25.050]  We know what you're trying to do
[02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:31.950]  We'll be your test will stop taking the fresh and we'll do the frozen and we'll tell you what happens
[02:00:32.190 --> 02:00:35.350]  So when all who are fully engaged in a program
[02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:40.630]  Change the way they approach it and they give you the feedback and say we got the same effect
[02:00:40.630 --> 02:00:43.950]  We just didn't like the flavor. So we had to put it into some
[02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:50.310]  Little little changes. So like once you start to have this reality, it's reality and I don't give a shit
[02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:56.710]  If there's no scientific proof you got 10,000 people in front of you that did something and I benefit all this proof
[02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:58.990]  That's proof. Yep, that's proof and
[02:00:59.510 --> 02:01:02.790]  Empirical evidence is proof and now why it's doing it
[02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:07.110]  I don't know and and we'll discover that when we become more intelligent and
[02:01:08.190 --> 02:01:13.430]  Covers it because I'm not someone who wants to be in a lab. It drives me nuts. I can't handle being in
[02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:16.070]  one room all day
[02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.750]  It's a problem. Like I
[02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:23.750]  Can't handle boredom. And so I'm mentally aggressive
[02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:30.590]  More than like aggressive to people but my mind doesn't turn off I can't shut the goddamn thing off
[02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:34.670]  and I have to constantly keep it stimulated and
[02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:40.750]  If I'm just in one space doing one thing once I get to a certain level in that space and I feel comfortable
[02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:46.350]  I'm like, let me get out of here and go work in another room where I know nothing so I can go through the price
[02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:48.630]  the process I need I need the
[02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:51.350]  coming in as a
[02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:58.630]  An apprentice and coming out hopefully at at least skilled journeyman level or hopefully at a master level
[02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:02.470]  Which just means I can run a project in that specific
[02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:10.990]  Entity that that that that field and that's what keeps me mentally stimulated. It's why like I'm never gonna retire
[02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:16.630]  What am I what am I gonna do when I retire? I'm gonna do the same shit. I can't shut off my mind
[02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:19.270]  It doesn't want to turn off
[02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:21.350]  Yeah
[02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:25.430]  Put myself in as many rooms as possible and allow myself to go
[02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:29.750]  processes continuously hunt and chase hunt and chase hunt and chase and
[02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:36.150]  I'm not seeking anything other than the ability for my mind to gather
[02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:41.310]  Information chew it up wrestle with it. And when I'm doing that I feel great. It lets me go to sleep at night
[02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:46.950]  Let's me hang out. But when I'm bored, I'm dangerous and I I don't like that
[02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:52.550]  Well, that's why the suits want to hear what you got to say because you've already thought it through and
[02:02:53.070 --> 02:02:58.910]  That's that makes you a PhD in common sense. Well, they know they some of them. It's funny
[02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:02.870]  Good of them. They don't I was laughing. I'm like, it's all good. You don't have to take my advice
[02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:09.390]  I said I'll be watching you sell your business on on a book closure because what you're doing is just fucked up and
[02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:14.230]  And when you're not trying to sell them anything and you're just like go read do it
[02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:16.830]  Whatever you want your failure doesn't affect me
[02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:19.470]  Right, so you want to drown go right in?
[02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:24.350]  But I would recommend you take the lead weight out of your pants pocket before you jump in the pool
[02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:28.270]  Yeah, right. You barely know how to swim and you got weighted pants
[02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:34.110]  You would probably do better if you did but it's okay if that's how you do it you do it and you'll see him drown
[02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:36.310]  Cuz nobody who does dumb shit
[02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:38.310]  survives
[02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:43.150]  You can't do dumb shit consistently and run a business. It just doesn't fucking work
[02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:45.670]  I've seen I've seen it go you
[02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:48.910]  Year in and year out at some LPs
[02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:55.830]  They just keep doing the same mistake from different angles because people on the top seem like they know it all but in the end
[02:03:55.830 --> 02:04:02.590]  They're never able to generate a solid profit and they're gonna collapse at some point because the investors lose
[02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:10.950]  Hey, yeah, you can generate one penny of profit investors will say hey we made profit protect the investment
[02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:17.710]  You are making negative cash flow every quarter tell me who's gonna rot like
[02:04:19.110 --> 02:04:23.630]  It's that's that it just doesn't happen. So so many of them are gonna go away and
[02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:27.730]  And in my event and it's like I like to see it happen
[02:04:27.730 --> 02:04:31.430]  But what I don't like to see is all the people that had jobs get screwed
[02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:33.750]  because you
[02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:37.710]  You're in a world right now. We're like, holy Christ. It's expensive
[02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:45.350]  And if you don't have a decent job and something a reasonable distance from your life, I mean, how do you do it?
[02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:50.150]  If you're living out if you know if you're living if you're working in San Francisco and you're not in tech
[02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:55.270]  You got to live like a hundred miles from from the city to afford a house
[02:04:55.710 --> 02:05:03.290]  Because there's a hundred miles circle around San Francisco the hundred miles of influence of of what it did to the housing market
[02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:11.050]  So it creates such an ungodly housing value within that radius that circle around the city
[02:05:11.410 --> 02:05:15.190]  That the only way anybody who works in there that isn't balling out of control
[02:05:15.190 --> 02:05:21.890]  They're gonna drive two hours to get to work and I'm like two hours to work two hours back
[02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:23.610]  So you got to be at work by 630?
[02:05:23.610 --> 02:05:30.330]  That means you leave the house at 430 and then when you get off at 430 you you have to go through traffic
[02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:33.130]  Which adds another 45 minutes so you don't get home for eight
[02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:40.050]  I'm like, how is that sustainable and all it is is this wage slave bullshit and it's this idea
[02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:45.330]  We're gonna dangle a carrot and then you're gonna get lectures from all these people about you got a grind 24-7
[02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:47.690]  And I'm always looking at these cats and I'm like shut up
[02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:49.790]  That's some rhetoric bullshit
[02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:54.730]  You're talking on your internet feed because if you got the time to sit there and talk shit on the feed you ain't grinding
[02:05:54.730 --> 02:05:57.770]  24 hours cuz we ain't grinding right now. We're having a conversation
[02:05:58.730 --> 02:06:00.730]  Yeah, I'm not hustling
[02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:05.850]  Hustling me on my goal my game and and hustle people don't even get that one, right?
[02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:08.170]  It really when I was a kid. I
[02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:12.050]  Read a quote by Lincoln because you know that you know that that saying that says
[02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:17.330]  Good things come to those who wait. Yeah, right. Well, that's not the quote
[02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:19.410]  That's the first half of the quote
[02:06:19.410 --> 02:06:26.010]  They got rid of the second half the second half of the quote that Lincoln said is good things come to those who wait
[02:06:26.530 --> 02:06:30.130]  But only the things left by those who hustle
[02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:36.690]  Right, so the idea of
[02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:39.650]  I was Lincoln of Franklin
[02:06:39.650 --> 02:06:39.930]  I mean
[02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:46.210]  I like you get old and you start forgetting who said the quote but it blew my mind when I saw that he had removed
[02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:49.810]  The second part and all and my buddy was like, it's impossible
[02:06:50.090 --> 02:06:54.090]  They didn't have hustlers in the in the you know, the 1700s and I said
[02:06:54.730 --> 02:06:57.170]  Hustle means you just move it
[02:06:58.010 --> 02:07:01.690]  Active you're actively trying to succeed
[02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:09.570]  That's all it means and so that's what career hustler is. I've been actively trying to succeed my entire life
[02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:15.890]  Because I've been on my own for most of my fucking life, right? So like if I was to succeed I would have starved
[02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:24.010]  Right, right once you once it's yeah, it's wonderful a thing when you're a teenager and you move up get out of the house
[02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:27.490]  It's either sink or swim at that point. No one's paying your rent. Oh
[02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:32.290]  And I was I was taking care of myself when I yeah, I was I had a different life
[02:07:32.530 --> 02:07:39.930]  So what I know is you move your feet and in that process if you're able to at least help people understand what it means
[02:07:40.650 --> 02:07:42.650]  What's the idea of?
[02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:49.850]  Staying busy to the best degree you can but make sure that you're you're not letting the struggle of life
[02:07:50.130 --> 02:07:52.970]  Create this perpetual busy because it's trauma response
[02:07:53.650 --> 02:08:00.650]  But you find things you're into that interest you that allow you to lose track of time
[02:08:00.650 --> 02:08:05.170]  And it's in the losing track of time that the results come
[02:08:05.610 --> 02:08:09.650]  It's it's people like, you know, did you film that? Did you do that? I said no
[02:08:09.650 --> 02:08:12.070]  I'm not even thinking about the goddamn phone phones in my pocket
[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:14.650]  I'm working on my project and
[02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:19.130]  I'm not worrying about what the public is looking at
[02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:25.010]  What I'm doing and when I succeed with what I'm doing if it's something real the public will see it
[02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:31.370]  And I don't talking about my failures or the things I think I did wrong or right because they're part of your story, too
[02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:39.250]  Everyone is always, you know, so caught up with I have no imperfections and I'm like, well humility certainly isn't one of your strengths
[02:08:40.890 --> 02:08:44.810]  Yeah, I have it right written on my thing it says be positive
[02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:50.530]  Thankful and humble, you know because I have to tell myself that you know, because when you're
[02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:54.650]  Going wall to wall with these guys that are about making a buck, you know
[02:08:54.650 --> 02:08:59.090]  It can kind of cause your attitude to take a little bit a little bit of a dip
[02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:06.650]  You know if people are are not humble and they're not positive and they're whatever but you can be those things and still like money
[02:09:07.770 --> 02:09:14.050]  Kids, I got a family. I gotta feed myself. So I have a good relationship with cash. I respect
[02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:20.170]  I treat money like you treat a beautiful woman you turn your back on her. She walk away forever
[02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:26.370]  Turn you back on the money, but at the same time is money the only
[02:09:27.650 --> 02:09:30.010]  quantifier of quality of life
[02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:33.290]  because
[02:09:33.330 --> 02:09:36.130]  It's important it's an addition to your life
[02:09:36.330 --> 02:09:41.010]  But it's not your entire life and for some people it is and for them
[02:09:41.010 --> 02:09:47.450]  I can't say that it's wrong and for them who don't like money at all and they live a very off the grid
[02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:53.570]  Build their own house out of lumber. They cut they they literally, you know
[02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:57.130]  grow their own food and they have llama in the yard that create the poop for the
[02:09:57.210 --> 02:10:03.810]  Fertilizer and they use the llama fur to make the clothes and they have chickens like they've you know, they off the grid self-sustaining individuals
[02:10:04.290 --> 02:10:06.610]  Money is not what drives them
[02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:09.050]  It's the fact that they're independent and
[02:10:09.490 --> 02:10:14.490]  That they have an ability to be able to be in control of their daily life to the best degree possible
[02:10:16.050 --> 02:10:18.670]  Money is just it's it's not that big a deal
[02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:20.890]  and so I can't tell them that it's
[02:10:21.170 --> 02:10:26.690]  important and I don't and I don't tell people who have money obsessed that it's not important because I'm not in the
[02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:30.690]  Position to give them advice either because I'm not right to them. It's crucial
[02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:35.830]  You just kind of figure out where you are. And what I learned is you need enough
[02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:40.410]  And if you have enough, it's okay more than that's great because you can pass it on
[02:10:40.410 --> 02:10:45.150]  but when you start like taking on an attitude with the loop, it's weird, but like
[02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:49.950]  The people I meet that are coolest with money are the richest
[02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:52.910]  Because their relationship is the truest
[02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:58.870]  So billionaires that I deal with a far cooler than people worth that are worth 30 million
[02:10:59.310 --> 02:11:03.150]  Because people that work 30 million, which is really like the investor world in cannabis. Oh
[02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:05.430]  Christ
[02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:09.630]  Every little detail is like I'm gonna let you know about my money and my special shit
[02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:13.750]  And you're hanging out the billionaire and you take him for a hamburger. He's like damn. This is a good burger
[02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:18.150]  You take the guy for 30 million and they let you know that it Kobe is a little better
[02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:22.630]  The guy that's got 30 million fucking owns a ranch of Kobe beef
[02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:29.950]  Well, hey, no, he's but he's got a wabu cow foot herd and the dude crying about the quality still has to buy it
[02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:35.290]  And I rip out because it's such an interesting perspective and for me
[02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:38.830]  Your money doesn't really mean anything to me because it's not mine
[02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:45.990]  Right, so I I don't really care about you cash what I care about you. Are you interesting? Do you have a
[02:11:47.150 --> 02:11:49.150]  unique direction that just
[02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:54.990]  Attracts me to you as a person that makes me want to like what you have to say and hang out with you
[02:11:55.590 --> 02:11:57.590]  Do you make me feel?
[02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:58.830]  deficient
[02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:04.950]  Because if I feel deficient around you then I know I can learn from you
[02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:08.990]  Yeah, so it doesn't have to be it's in all categories. I just meet people that oh
[02:12:10.150 --> 02:12:15.150]  Awesome in these weird little tangents little tangents that it makes me go. Whoa
[02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:19.910]  You you got me there and it allows me to respect you completely
[02:12:20.710 --> 02:12:26.910]  Because I know that in that room you're all over me and and what it does it allows me to be able to say hey
[02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:32.950]  Can I can I can I learn from you to behave that way? Can I can I is it possible we trade?
[02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:38.350]  can I provide something to get knowledge from you and I'll give back what I have and
[02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:40.910]  I think that that's
[02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:47.430]  Something that it's mandatory in the world of cannabis today that all of us that are older that
[02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:50.830]  Historical where like we've been in this a long time. I'm from
[02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.830]  I'm from the birth
[02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:58.670]  I was born in 66 which is a Nixon lie I laugh and Nixon launched the drug war like in six the new drug war
[02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:00.670]  came out in 66
[02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:05.190]  83 it kicked in fully under Reagan and that's when I caught that first case
[02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:10.510]  So I'm like I'm someone it was like I'm a child of the drug war. That's how I see myself
[02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:16.750]  I was born when the drug war was launched by Nixon. I caught my first felony case when Reagan popped out. I
[02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:19.950]  Was in the Bay Area when 215 kicked in
[02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:20.990]  and
[02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:24.350]  I had my my I had my I had my script
[02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:28.310]  I was one of the like the first couple hundred in the state to have the damn thing
[02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:31.910]  And I and my doctor was Mica Ria who was the first doctor?
[02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:38.030]  So like I was involved in all these pieces and it doesn't mean anything. It just means that my life was
[02:13:39.230 --> 02:13:45.110]  Steered and guided by this exterior pressure of the drug war and my choices
[02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:49.430]  And what that means is that we spent our whole lives doing something in a way that
[02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:55.950]  some of it needs to be discarded because it's antiquated and it was a result of a drug war and
[02:13:56.150 --> 02:14:00.030]  some of it needs to be held because it created a different relationship between the
[02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:06.470]  Participants and you had a unity amongst us because we knew that if any of us screwed up it would bring the whole crew down
[02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:07.950]  Yeah
[02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:13.230]  You were more cautious about what you'd even though you were out of control and what you would do and you're more cautious not to
[02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:16.030]  Bring heat because the punishment was severe
[02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:21.910]  so you just had a different behavioral code and I I really liked it and
[02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:25.310]  I guess a lot of ways. I'm just trying to bring those things
[02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:29.190]  I like forward and sharing with people in a way that that works and as
[02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:34.990]  Long as you're coming at me in a good way. I'm about it. You flex. I'm not that dude
[02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:40.070]  I'm I'm I'm not that dude. I remember back back in the day
[02:14:40.070 --> 02:14:46.110]  I remember doing like 10 pack 20 pack deals on a handshake, you know, and it's like
[02:14:47.110 --> 02:14:49.110]  hundreds weekly
[02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:51.750]  Um
[02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:54.390]  You had trust because they needed you and you needed them
[02:14:55.670 --> 02:15:00.550]  you have a disposability in the truth to and I'm not someone is gonna like advocate violence, but
[02:15:01.070 --> 02:15:03.630]  if you screwed me in the past I
[02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:10.390]  Can straighten it out and you couldn't really go to the cops because you'd have to admit you're in it
[02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:14.030]  You're engaged in a felony transaction. And so you got in trouble, too
[02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:19.270]  But the the illicit nature of the product gave punishment to everyone involved
[02:15:20.150 --> 02:15:26.150]  People behave different. Well now there's no penalty and all you see is people with this primarily distribution
[02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:32.270]  If there's a distribution company that hasn't fucked somebody I like to see it like the only it's funny
[02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:37.870]  Like I deal with cookies. I'm involved in the R&D facility, but when I have them sell my flour when I'm running my farm
[02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:40.790]  So far, they're the only company that's paid me
[02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:46.750]  I got screwed from anyone else I've dealt with and I'm like, you know, and I want to stick their hand into a blender
[02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:48.710]  because
[02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:54.910]  There's you you stole the money that and so you can't recover. It can't recover the time. I can't recover the cash
[02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:57.990]  Now I'm short money to cover the business
[02:15:58.230 --> 02:16:01.950]  So you're having to do all kinds of weird shit to make it work and I'm just like whoa
[02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:07.430]  When you only have one company you've dealt with it's been consistently to pay you
[02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:13.950]  It's just not a good look for the industry Jesus Christ and all these I'm gonna and pulling this stuff off. I'm like
[02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:20.190]  May you may a pox settle upon your family because what you're doing is you're crippling
[02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:25.750]  small operators who don't have investment who can't recover from the beaten and
[02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:28.470]  You do that shit
[02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:30.630]  To I have no mercy on you
[02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:34.910]  It's if someone ought to someone ought to beat you in the hand with a hammer
[02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:41.830]  So that that hand that stole that money can never function again. I'd be fine with that and it's like I'm not violent, but I'm
[02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:50.350]  I'm not violent by choice, but yeah, I'm from a radically different background. And so I just know that
[02:16:50.630 --> 02:16:51.750]  That
[02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:54.350]  We don't have any recourse to get getting screwed
[02:16:54.550 --> 02:17:00.350]  But the old game there was and it kept it a lot more honest
[02:17:00.350 --> 02:17:03.990]  It did ever seen so much screwing as I see now
[02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:10.510]  You know nightmare and but for people that are just they're losing their business. I mean I talked to so many people
[02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:12.510]  It's just it's just tragic
[02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:14.030]  because
[02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:16.270]  Trusting nice people are getting screwed and
[02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:24.150]  Trust again, and then they out and proclaim it and what we have is an industry filled with no trust no faith
[02:17:24.630 --> 02:17:27.230]  So, how do you get new people to come in and want to participate?
[02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:34.470]  How do we recruit new people to replace us if all they think is it's filled with scandalous?
[02:17:35.670 --> 02:17:37.670]  people I
[02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:40.790]  Actually don't know. I'm I am worried that that
[02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:45.310]  I'm lucky for me. I'm about ready to retire right so for me
[02:17:46.430 --> 02:17:51.790]  It's okay, but but if I was like a 30 year old man with a couple of young kids
[02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:56.670]  You know trying to build a life for my kids that I would be more concerned about the money
[02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:00.710]  My wife always says hey, you know make sure you get paid for that, you know
[02:18:00.710 --> 02:18:02.790]  And I wind up not getting paid for so much
[02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:07.510]  Oh totally, but there's stuff that you do for free. Like I do a ton and I don't mind I
[02:18:08.390 --> 02:18:10.950]  Don't mind if I choose to do it
[02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:16.110]  I mind when people come into my life and they're like, let me let me let me get into your shit
[02:18:16.110 --> 02:18:21.270]  And you look at Adam like that in their mind is somehow sly and I'm laughing
[02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:25.830]  I'm like you realize I spent like, you know, 44 years the drug dealer. Hmm
[02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:31.190]  I think I pretty good idea what it was bullshit looks like that and the distributors that screw me fool. I know
[02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:35.590]  And the irony of them is that it wasn't even intentional
[02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:43.710]  It was they made a mistake in their business and it took the lice and like so there's this swirling array of issues
[02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:46.870]  That make it really difficult
[02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:53.910]  but the main point of this stuff is for me is how do you bring in talent to an industry and
[02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:59.950]  Have diversity in that talent group you you you have a limited number
[02:19:00.310 --> 02:19:02.310]  It was like there was a MJ biz, right
[02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:05.150]  there was a
[02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:07.030]  t-shirt there's a t-shirt
[02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:11.630]  Some chick shoots a t-shirt out and I think it says like, you know buy weed from women
[02:19:11.630 --> 02:19:17.710]  and so women are rocking the shirt and that's cool because by weed from women buying weed from anyone is
[02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:24.090]  The main point that's if you're decent and so some guys made a parody shirt and it said
[02:19:24.850 --> 02:19:31.890]  Buy weed from rich white men, holy shit the blowback on that was insane and it started to become this
[02:19:32.290 --> 02:19:34.650]  they hate women and they're they're
[02:19:35.290 --> 02:19:42.570]  Anti-minority, but the problem is the picture that they're circulating of the women wearing the shirt. None of them are minority
[02:19:42.570 --> 02:19:44.570]  they're all white women so it's like
[02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:47.350]  wait a minute like
[02:19:47.890 --> 02:19:53.930]  It's so confusing as to what to do because everyone's trying to make sure there's a thing in the bottom line is what I
[02:19:54.130 --> 02:19:56.570]  Do is I want to buy weed from people that grow good weed
[02:19:57.370 --> 02:20:00.370]  What I want is to not favor anybody
[02:20:00.690 --> 02:20:05.050]  What I'd like to see is an open platform to where anyone can get involved
[02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:10.090]  The idea that you have to jump through six hoops because your chick is just not fair
[02:20:10.090 --> 02:20:14.970]  If you are if you black or brown Asian Jesus Christ again beat the death
[02:20:16.210 --> 02:20:22.470]  Because what is the reason you pretty much didn't go to school with the right investment group?
[02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:25.710]  So you weren't involved in the group that put the money together
[02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:29.150]  so if you and see even for me I
[02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:37.510]  See myself in that cluster even though I'm in New England white dude, right because I spent my whole life in the grind
[02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:40.710]  So when you're at the grind you're in the criminal justice system
[02:20:41.310 --> 02:20:45.990]  You're a minority because it wasn't meant to catch white people really was it was meant to catch minorities
[02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:48.290]  and so once you're in it you see the
[02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:54.810]  The nature of it and you're like whoa, but I turned my back on my white privilege by being in the drug business
[02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:59.010]  So that allows me now to have to understand what the penalty is
[02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:05.770]  because the drug world and some of these others were the only opportunity many had to have any financial success and
[02:21:06.610 --> 02:21:08.370]  That's a reality
[02:21:08.370 --> 02:21:10.210]  You just don't get through the door
[02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:15.490]  and so that the fight between the two two t-shirt factions is crazy and
[02:21:15.890 --> 02:21:19.410]  And I understand because it's it's it's this idea of
[02:21:19.930 --> 02:21:24.810]  You know the the right which the white rich men control it, but at the same time
[02:21:25.970 --> 02:21:31.690]  Do you take them out of the picture and promote someone else by virtue of the fact that you're solely a woman or solely a minority?
[02:21:31.810 --> 02:21:35.170]  What's the difference? And so there's no difference. It's that
[02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:42.650]  There should be an open platform for everyone to get in and in the business that we're in that's not possible
[02:21:42.690 --> 02:21:48.450]  But in the community it is and that's where to me the the openness can come
[02:21:48.930 --> 02:21:55.210]  because there's there's no one that's better than anyone as a person and so for me want to be able to
[02:21:56.290 --> 02:22:02.930]  Get around that problem of business being prejudice and having you know an anti-woman tone
[02:22:03.570 --> 02:22:05.890]  holy what that requires is
[02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:13.090]  Numbers of people that are diverse to come forward as a cluster and say hey, we don't think it's fair and
[02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:20.610]  Not but at the same time you can't you can't say these white rich men
[02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:22.610]  But you're angry that they're white and rich
[02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:28.950]  It's it what it what happens when the position changes and it says only buy weed from rich white women. Is that okay?
[02:22:29.350 --> 02:22:36.310]  Now what the only the poor chicks can like it's it's the business is so volatile and everybody's so angry
[02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:42.430]  That you don't get the connection you need which is that we're all in the same situation. We all love weed
[02:22:42.430 --> 02:22:46.270]  We want to grow weed. We want to smoke weed. We want to be involved in it in some capacity and
[02:22:46.990 --> 02:22:48.870]  and for me
[02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:52.910]  My my whole life has been diverse thankfully because of weed
[02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:55.310]  there's there's
[02:22:55.310 --> 02:23:01.870]  There's no door that I didn't get to get in and it allowed me to see people as people so I got I
[02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:06.630]  Got really fortunate that I got to see so much diversity in my life
[02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:10.510]  And what I know is that diversity doesn't always exist in business
[02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:16.350]  It doesn't have it just it's the nature of it and depends who you are as sometimes as a white person
[02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:18.750]  You can't get in the door. That's not your world to go in
[02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:24.310]  Accept it and I do but in my personal life. It's open door and
[02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:31.350]  it it's it's the beginning where where you have to get the people together so that as a as a
[02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:36.570]  Population you can change the problem because that's the only way it's gonna work is with numbers
[02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:44.310]  You want it more available get more people of diversity combined to agree that the shit screwed up and it'll work
[02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:50.070]  but when you when you make them out fight amongst each other all you do is create more division and
[02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:52.970]  And America's good at the division creation
[02:23:52.970 --> 02:23:58.830]  So this way you never get the factions to realize the only enemy you really have is the people regulating you
[02:23:59.390 --> 02:24:05.150]  That every one of us in the in the population is under the same exact roof and it's not a good one
[02:24:06.310 --> 02:24:09.230]  We need to agree that that's something we have in common
[02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:14.710]  and once you have that in common now you can start to find out all the other commonalities and
[02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:18.510]  Recognize that talent comes in every size shape and color
[02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:21.990]  Assholes are not inclusive to one group
[02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:28.550]  You know and cannabis has that ability but you you get so polarized on who's right or who's wrong
[02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:34.110]  All it does is it ends up confusing people and then no one how to approach it. They don't know how to behave
[02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:40.270]  Having a bill they just say I'm staying away from it and once you have someone's away from a
[02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:46.370]  Situation they don't know how to behave and how can there ever be a continuity between the people?
[02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:53.330]  Yeah, you know it's it's the dope game was pretty pure like I just I say all the time I'm like
[02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:57.210]  I'm still in the dope game in my mind. I just have to
[02:24:57.850 --> 02:25:02.650]  Regulatory world, but I behave the same I behave the whole time. I haven't changed shit
[02:25:04.050 --> 02:25:05.770]  Well, you know
[02:25:05.770 --> 02:25:11.050]  People that know how to love one another they know how to do it regardless if he smoked cannabis or not
[02:25:11.410 --> 02:25:13.410]  Mike my mom
[02:25:13.410 --> 02:25:15.490]  You don't think we've smoking to be my friend. Oh
[02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:21.210]  Right, and I know people who smoke weed that I don't necessarily dig, but I know that
[02:25:21.930 --> 02:25:26.530]  Usually when we're smoking a joint together for that 10-15 minutes, it's really pleasant
[02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:32.510]  Yeah, you know so the me cannabis has some really incredible properties
[02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:35.290]  And I don't believe everyone should have to consume
[02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:41.130]  I think everyone should have to have some form endocannabinoid system stimulation and not because I believe you need it to
[02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:44.250]  Make me happy, but as an organism
[02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:49.330]  Your endocannabinoid system being stimulated seems to have a profound effect on your health
[02:25:49.690 --> 02:25:54.690]  It does on your sleep if you got neuropathy. I'll tell you you're not gonna sleep without it
[02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:56.770]  yeah, it makes a big difference and so I just
[02:25:57.450 --> 02:26:03.990]  it's it's it's so polarizing and and what I do is I just I just try to look at you as you and I
[02:26:04.850 --> 02:26:10.170]  Online and I follow people and I see what they do and I just reach out to him privately and I just say yo
[02:26:10.690 --> 02:26:12.690]  I'm just letting you know man. I
[02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:15.490]  Love what you do, and I just respect you and
[02:26:16.210 --> 02:26:18.530]  I know I don't want anything. I don't do anything
[02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:19.970]  I'm just saying I'm saying hi
[02:26:19.970 --> 02:26:21.330]  and I'm just saying
[02:26:21.330 --> 02:26:27.010]  Good job at what you're doing because you caught my eye and it did you I get value from what you say and do and
[02:26:27.010 --> 02:26:34.290]  I just want to say it. Yeah, I like it when I what when somebody gives me a piece of flour that they grew on
[02:26:34.290 --> 02:26:38.730]  A show or something and I've got a way to contact them after it usually it's not great
[02:26:38.730 --> 02:26:44.650]  You know but sometimes it is and and I would have the opportunity to reach out to somebody and said hey
[02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:49.370]  I tried that and that was the best chemotype. I've had I was stayed high for four hours
[02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:53.770]  You know so you never know what you're gonna get in a show. That's not sure
[02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:56.630]  Really, you know it in just in life, man. It's
[02:26:57.410 --> 02:27:00.810]  It's just an approach everybody has their own approach, and how they want to live their life
[02:27:01.450 --> 02:27:03.690]  but yeah your your
[02:27:04.690 --> 02:27:06.530]  Ability as a
[02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:13.450]  Human being is that you can have incredible impact on the world around you by just basically being kind to people the best you can
[02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:14.250]  Yeah
[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:20.050]  And it just it you just don't know what anybody's going through and and I'm a wicked ball buster too
[02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:22.050]  Like I mean, I'm somebody who likes to fuck around verbally
[02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:24.410]  but
[02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:30.570]  What I'm also aware of is that like when you're vulnerable isn't when I kick you, you know, like it up
[02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:33.410]  I'm gonna kick you when you're up because then
[02:27:34.130 --> 02:27:39.170]  Because that's that's real ball busting is that you can play and it's about how create you're having a bad time
[02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:40.970]  That's when you just say leave him alone
[02:27:40.970 --> 02:27:43.730]  otherwise what you're doing is you're being cruel and you're being a bully and
[02:27:44.370 --> 02:27:48.090]  There's enough ready and and most bullies. I met are really
[02:27:49.410 --> 02:27:54.530]  Cowards like you take them out of their their range boy. You put him to be put him to take him to terror town
[02:27:54.970 --> 02:27:56.970]  They sing a different story
[02:27:57.010 --> 02:28:04.370]  So, I don't I don't want that to be my legacy that I was bullying people because of a position or I like I'm somebody
[02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:05.490]  Who likes to fuck with you?
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:08.690]  But if you have time you like my bad time. I'm like I'm good man
[02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:13.970]  Like right now I I will I will step down and step below you if that's what you need
[02:28:13.970 --> 02:28:20.450]  And what it is it keeps me human and then it'll be able to maybe hopefully
[02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:24.830]  bring some value to the world around me in a minor minor way, but
[02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:31.870]  That's all really I've ever wanted to do I wasn't trying to change the earth I don't think I'm that powerful I just
[02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:36.630]  Change me and if I don't wreak havoc on those around me
[02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:41.910]  then I can at least allow me not to be a negative influence or detriment to others and
[02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:47.750]  If at all possible when opportunity comes to do something cool and right you try
[02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:51.470]  It's it's just this a
[02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:58.350]  Lifestyle and I think like yeah, man, the old hippies had it down. That's really I'm not it
[02:28:58.350 --> 02:29:01.310]  I didn't I didn't invent anything in medical cannabis. I
[02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:04.230]  Copied Perone and the crew
[02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:07.270]  Everything I did that is
[02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:12.310]  Powerful was that I'm taking things I copied from people
[02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:18.030]  I saw growing up that I just respected and when I had the opportunity to behave that way
[02:29:18.030 --> 02:29:23.710]  I said, hey, I already have a lesson on how to do this. I don't have to create it. I'm good integrating things
[02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:25.790]  so so the way I go about its mind and
[02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:29.630]  The way I use the tools mine
[02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:33.910]  But I know that I have all these beautiful people in my life that influenced me
[02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:36.310]  Thank God and
[02:29:36.310 --> 02:29:40.710]  Help me see a better picture. And so when opportunity comes I'm just like whoa
[02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:46.230]  I I know how to be I know that my grandmother never was rude to anybody and when she met them
[02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:53.150]  My whole life I've tried to be that person where until you step on my foot I'm cool and
[02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:57.310]  It makes a difference, you know, and and I just think that
[02:29:58.190 --> 02:30:05.170]  You you have an ability to have a better life in that process and that when you're competing with everyone around you
[02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:09.590]  You're not winning. No, it's it's hard in this business
[02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:11.590]  You know if you really want to make a buck
[02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:14.350]  But you know you try to take the high road as best you can
[02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:19.910]  You give lots of pats on the backs and out of boys and and hope a few come back and that's good
[02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:26.510]  Well, it's been great chatting with you today, Kevin. I think we got some a few questions maybe in the in the
[02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:33.390]  Yeah, if you'll put those up one then any questions and we'll answer those but I
[02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:35.630]  Think if we if we did too many
[02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:39.430]  We could we could be rolling here for another two and a half hours if we answered all the questions
[02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:43.950]  I think I got a really good one here from Jeff Scharf
[02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:49.270]  What do you think of the new synthetic seed technology being offered in Canada pretty neat?
[02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:53.610]  They are pretty neat. You want to know what's interesting is that I had a buddy of mine
[02:30:53.610 --> 02:31:01.030]  I get in tissue culture like in like 206, right? I had a P I had a rogue PhD professor friend brilliant
[02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:02.870]  This kid was fucking super genius
[02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:07.190]  But he was a psycho and his whole head was tattooed as flames
[02:31:07.390 --> 02:31:13.310]  But he grew his hair out so that he could be at the University as a professor but this dude was lit and
[02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:20.630]  He and I worked together because he was creating the first synthetic seed and it allowed me to understand what he was doing
[02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:22.630]  He's trying to encapsulate the marrow stem
[02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:28.110]  So that you were able to then hold it in a refrigerated situation then crack him a seed
[02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:35.710]  But he was having a hell of time getting the conversion to go because once it went from that encapsulated sterile version
[02:31:36.030 --> 02:31:40.650]  He didn't have his formulation down well enough that allowed it to actually function
[02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:47.030]  But I would provide him with nodal material from a tremendous amount of different plants so we could figure out
[02:31:47.390 --> 02:31:51.030]  the formulations for the hormonal stimulation and
[02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:56.950]  Your antiseptic abilities in the auger. And so I love it. I mean, I'm fascinated by
[02:31:58.070 --> 02:32:00.910]  Technology and how we utilize it and anything that allows
[02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:04.110]  There to be an easier
[02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:09.830]  Better system, I'm digging but yeah, it's I love it and they finally figured it out
[02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:12.230]  but like I said for me I was playing around with it and
[02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:16.550]  With a scientist he had his own he had his own like the you know
[02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:21.630]  They have those shipping the shipping crates. They use the the containers where they make a houses
[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:25.510]  He had one of those in his backyard that looked like an old shipping crate
[02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:30.190]  But it was a state-of-the-art a state-of-the-art TCU lab for like 207
[02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:32.710]  kid was brilliant and
[02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:36.030]  I just I dig it. I think that it's an incredible tool and
[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:40.950]  I think that we're we haven't dialed it all in completely
[02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:47.070]  But man, it's coming just like the home TC kits for holding things in vitro in your house. I love those too
[02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:53.550]  It's just the you know legality wise those are plants now a marriage stem. Is it a plant?
[02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:54.270]  Okay
[02:32:54.270 --> 02:32:58.270]  I mean are they gonna take it at that level and say but when you see a plant in the test tube and you can
[02:32:58.270 --> 02:33:00.270]  See leaves it's a plant. So I
[02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:07.830]  Know the laws keep screwing us so that anybody other than a licensed operation can't hold anything
[02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:11.670]  What's the next one
[02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:19.070]  All right. Next one. So you mentioned that there's a what is the allowable amount of deviation for breeding that is considered to be a breeder?
[02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:23.310]  Well, you know for other plant crops, it's about 85%
[02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:27.990]  So if you get 85% of the crop to be homogenous, it's considered stable
[02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:34.670]  So if you're into a stability range where we take a crop of a thousand eight hundred and fifty of them come out with
[02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:36.870]  us a reasonable range of deviation
[02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:43.150]  so a point or two and chemotype point or two in terms of metabolite and it has to be in a specific location because we
[02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:48.910]  Can influence metabolite and keep which is metabolite, but we can influence set and flavor
[02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:53.870]  Cannabinoids by production methodology, right?
[02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:58.190]  So in order to say stable it has to be stable in a specific situation
[02:33:58.750 --> 02:34:01.070]  If it's 85 out of 85%
[02:34:01.310 --> 02:34:07.250]  You're considered a stable breeder in any other field and in a point is that we use the word elite
[02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:14.750]  Elite implies that the plant was run for two years prior and proven to have no issues in any context
[02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:19.630]  To be released. We use the word elite and clones to imply high value
[02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:23.430]  But in plant world elite has a very specific
[02:34:24.270 --> 02:34:31.750]  Situation. So to me you're in an 85% your breeder because you've reproduced the traits consistently to make it
[02:34:32.470 --> 02:34:38.810]  Viable to be used for commercial production, which is what cultivars are as plants selected for commercial production
[02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:46.910]  All right, and now last juicy one and I have to ask this because Cheddar's ass is did Kevin smoke that cherry pie
[02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:48.910]  I gave him in Maine
[02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:51.630]  I did I
[02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:57.630]  Did I did smoke that cherry pie you gave me man? It was good. What I liked. I you know, what I really liked was uh
[02:34:58.510 --> 02:35:00.750]  the crew in Maine and the crew in Michigan
[02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:03.950]  Craft craft like about it
[02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:09.350]  And so I love it because it every every everybody thinks, you know, they're there every is best
[02:35:09.350 --> 02:35:11.350]  but when you get to travel and see
[02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:19.150]  Craft operators across the board you see some incredible incredible word, you know incredible work
[02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:21.630]  And so Chetty had some killer shit
[02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:26.250]  They don't even have to spend a million dollars in Michigan to get their license
[02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:33.350]  So I wonder if there's so much a different like it let's say you're in Colorado versus New York or New Jersey
[02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:37.070]  You know, you have such a different amount of money. You have to pay to going in
[02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:40.230]  I'm wondering when the US opens up where it'll be
[02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:43.510]  you know where the water level will wind up because
[02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:48.390]  These people that got to pay so much are gonna get wiped out because the guys on the small land are gonna be able to
[02:35:48.470 --> 02:35:50.470]  cheaper
[02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:58.930]  It's the fact that you have you like when it opens up and then do the states create the compact that allows it right so like
[02:35:59.230 --> 02:36:05.230]  Michigan they get buried because just like Oklahoma. It's great to say everybody can grow
[02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:11.870]  But the problem is that means you're flooding a place and when they flood places with small pop
[02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:17.310]  You know, you're talking California where where if you took California and ripped it off to the US
[02:36:17.310 --> 02:36:20.750]  We're the fifth largest economy in the world LA by itself
[02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:25.790]  Just LA County is the 15th most powerful economy in the world
[02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:28.590]  So California is this?
[02:36:29.430 --> 02:36:33.290]  Really interesting situation because it's almost to me like its own country
[02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:35.950]  But you know in New York's got a massive population
[02:36:36.250 --> 02:36:42.430]  So that with New York you get the license for what you get is you get access to a massive population with high
[02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:44.910]  economic
[02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:46.910]  They're in some of these other areas
[02:36:47.310 --> 02:36:52.750]  Where you have a lower, you know, someone's like I want to move to the south and you get a house for a hundred grand
[02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:53.430]  I'm like, that's nice
[02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:56.910]  You're also gonna make very little money or the houses would be more than a hundred grand
[02:36:57.190 --> 02:37:01.550]  So the problem is in places where there's more affordability. You also have less
[02:37:02.470 --> 02:37:04.470]  disposable income
[02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:11.550]  So it's this conundrum of where you place your operation and what takes place and when people argue about how you know
[02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:15.550]  California's gonna fail when they open up the borders and I'm like, well
[02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:19.390]  I don't see a lot of produce being shipped in from Michigan to California
[02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:25.150]  So what I know is that California basically is an export nation export
[02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:29.190]  state when it comes to agricultural products because
[02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:35.910]  Christ we got we got the Central Valley with a breadbasket of the world and most of California herb is coming out of that Central
[02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:38.950]  Valley into that southern sector, you know that Salinas
[02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:42.150]  Monterey all the way up to Carpinteria, Santa Barbara
[02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:48.190]  And then in Northern California, we have these these pockets you got Humboldt-Mendocino Trinity
[02:37:48.270 --> 02:37:52.710]  You got the Sierras you got you know, and then you got Butte Shasta
[02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:58.310]  Which is going Eastern incredible cultivation quality, but discriminatory
[02:37:59.710 --> 02:38:03.510]  Policies on who can and can't grow and they can't grow at all. So
[02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:06.390]  California
[02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:11.350]  It lets you see a reality because what you have is an ungodly amount of money
[02:38:11.350 --> 02:38:16.550]  And if you can't make it work in a place with them, even though it's expensive to get a license
[02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:24.070]  Their money is unreal. So I just what I see is I see these these states that have
[02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:31.630]  smaller cash flow levels what they'll develop and what I would recommend they do and what I do recommend to the people I talk to
[02:38:31.630 --> 02:38:33.590]  Is you build your niche?
[02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:38.630]  Direction so you're not competing with me in California. You're growing stuff. That is
[02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:45.950]  Mitten friendly you're growing things that the people in Michigan like to smoke they there's always trendy shit
[02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:53.430]  That's hot. But what you notice with clusters of population is there similarities what people like they live in a region
[02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:59.150]  They have different reasons why they consume what they consume and because of that when you identify it allows you to be able to say
[02:38:59.670 --> 02:39:03.270]  They like things different what I noticed about Michigan specifically was
[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:09.430]  Cheese and earth what I noticed about Maine was the reality that the climates too brutal
[02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:14.110]  For many to succeed and I saw this ungodly
[02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:16.710]  too light for light tent
[02:39:17.710 --> 02:39:23.310]  cultivation with unbelievable product that went right into hash right into rosin and
[02:39:24.030 --> 02:39:25.030]  so
[02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:32.790]  That those developments those small pieces will work for the craft for the ultra quality and then places like California
[02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:38.590]  I mean a glass house, right? They got another five million square foot of canopy lit up when they when they put that online. I
[02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:41.390]  Mean, I think they got the ability to do like
[02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:48.990]  900,000 pounds right now step that up to five million pounds. Oh that covers a lot a lot of consumption. So
[02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:56.630]  It it it's not that the small places are gonna they're better to work in it's just that they're where you like to live and
[02:39:57.750 --> 02:40:02.670]  Economy of scale is what is what occurs in the u.s. The u.s. Does not favor craft anything
[02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:05.230]  So I want to see is
[02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:08.430]  These regions be able to develop their own identities
[02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:14.270]  So that there's no way you can really compete the the and a lot of it has to be
[02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:18.430]  Where there you're taking the time to really
[02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:25.710]  Understand what is your unique feel and flavor and that way when I go to Michigan? I'm smoking, Michigan when I'm in Maine
[02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:29.550]  I'm smoking Maine where I'm in Florida. I'm smoking, Florida when I'm in California
[02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:30.710]  I'm smoking, California
[02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:32.710]  And what it does then is it allows us?
[02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:38.870]  To be able to have all the pockets that can exist and then you'll have large-scale production and you'll have I mean
[02:40:39.550 --> 02:40:43.750]  It's we haven't the real players aren't here yet. Like people don't catch it. Everybody's big
[02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:45.430]  I'm like listen
[02:40:45.430 --> 02:40:48.390]  When I was talking to the elite scientists from Syngenta
[02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:53.430]  Except I just come from C company in the world like Monsanto bear is only one bigger than him
[02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:58.910]  And I was like, are you in cannabis yet? And he goes now he goes no need he goes with global food
[02:40:59.390 --> 02:41:04.350]  He goes the day we get in cannabis, you'll know we have a million dollars a day. We can just throw at it
[02:41:04.350 --> 02:41:06.350]  No, no, no concern
[02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:11.030]  You will know and I go well what prevents you from playing around in any capacity?
[02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:14.110]  They said the US government because it's federally illegal
[02:41:14.110 --> 02:41:20.390]  So if we invest anywhere we run the risk of a federal seizure if we have enough money invested involved
[02:41:20.390 --> 02:41:24.670]  And so he goes gap. We're big he goes. We're on a hundred-year plan. We're a 200-year plan
[02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:30.830]  We'll get there and when we do you'll know and it was just such an honest answer
[02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:33.790]  And so let me know that whoever's here now is big compared to us
[02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:36.910]  But you're not bigger than bear
[02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:39.590]  on your best day ever and
[02:41:40.430 --> 02:41:47.550]  That's who's gonna really consolidate and you're gonna have trucking companies that in district distribution that is consolidated
[02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:53.270]  It'll change everything the survival for the most of the people listen to these podcasts
[02:41:53.350 --> 02:41:59.510]  The survival is to find your own lane choose some shit that is not being commercially grown
[02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:07.390]  Because the parameters don't fit if your crop is below that return on investment for an investor to be happy
[02:42:07.430 --> 02:42:09.430]  You probably say
[02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:11.590]  Running the same product that they're running
[02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:16.790]  There's no way you can compete with them because even if your products a little better, they're cheaper
[02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:18.790]  You can't beat the economy of scale
[02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:23.510]  So when you go to compete with people for me when I compete with people in business
[02:42:23.950 --> 02:42:28.450]  My whole goal is to take you into my world and drown you there
[02:42:28.450 --> 02:42:32.390]  I don't go into your world and then have to compete with you where your tools are
[02:42:32.390 --> 02:42:35.950]  I try to force you to have to fuck with me where I'm strong and
[02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:42.270]  What it does is they either want to play which isn't a smart move because you're taking them into a place where they're gonna have
[02:42:42.270 --> 02:42:44.950]  To explain to an investor or they just can't play
[02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:53.150]  So it's the only place that's left for us, but it's okay because it gives us the unique weird fringy shit that cannabis was
[02:42:54.310 --> 02:43:01.990]  Nobody group is saying shit. We everybody had different shit the golden era or herb. It can be recreated with the home grower market
[02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:07.590]  Yeah, well and I think they're gonna do that with gold hat seeds I
[02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:14.190]  Should you know you're producing you're doing good work your I like all you frost test shit
[02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:17.270]  Yeah, because it's shit. It's saying hey look
[02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:24.790]  I got plants that can handle this climate and they're good and I'm choosing them and I'm and I'm smoking them and I'm digging it
[02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:29.030]  And it's meant for people to do it in this way. Does the LP want to use it?
[02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:32.550]  But no, I'd say they're not gonna grow outside
[02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:37.630]  But but you and I would grow outside and and and like you say when you grew up on the hill
[02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:40.390]  You got that crazy wind that comes out of the West
[02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:43.910]  Well, you know, we got certain winds too and that helps our terroir
[02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:51.310]  I got you know better flavor everything because of acts if I don't have if I don't get enough wind in my in my crop
[02:43:51.310 --> 02:43:54.470]  I don't get enough lipids produced as
[02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:57.030]  Like a
[02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:58.790]  Goes out
[02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:59.790]  Yeah
[02:43:59.790 --> 02:44:05.270]  Pot off the hill I can light it up and I can take a couple puffs and then I can hear my dog barking in
[02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:06.870]  The backyard dog. I gotta get my dog
[02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:10.870]  Bring it and I can put the joint down and I can go get the dog and I can look around
[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:13.350]  Cuz I'm high and then I go
[02:44:13.350 --> 02:44:13.510]  Oh
[02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:17.750]  I gotta go back in the house and I go back in the house and I can pick up the joint and things been sitting
[02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:22.630]  At the two three minutes now and I can take a couple puffs on it and blow the flame back
[02:44:23.390 --> 02:44:30.510]  Because there's so much wax and and and fat and grease trapped in it now when you're doing extraction you're pulling all that out
[02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:32.830]  Because they're considered contaminants
[02:44:33.390 --> 02:44:35.230]  but as a joint smoker
[02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:39.610]  that's what allows you to get that thick full mouth and that
[02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:46.830]  incredible burn ability where you light the joint once and it's burning like a candle for the next 15-20 minutes and
[02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:52.190]  That's what I like. I'm not saying everybody has to enjoy that but for me if I'm burning a joint
[02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:58.030]  And it's not greasy and waxy and it keeps going out and you have to make sure you pass it quick
[02:44:58.030 --> 02:45:01.670]  I'm like, I'm cool with it. Yeah anymore
[02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:05.870]  Yeah, any more questions? No, no, not really
[02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:12.230]  Go here that it popped up nothing that we haven't that we didn't end up actually answering throughout the conversation
[02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:14.910]  Okay, here's a good one, but I'll word it a little bit better
[02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:17.550]  is how
[02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:23.390]  One thing that you've touched on a lot is the big business and the small in the small companies and getting in and keeping small
[02:45:23.390 --> 02:45:24.630]  And craft and we know to be there
[02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:31.230]  So how can small companies or small craft farmers worked with big work with big business?
[02:45:31.390 --> 02:45:35.950]  To be able to maintain who they are but also, you know keep their identity
[02:45:36.430 --> 02:45:39.830]  You know, the thing is that's it's actually taking place right now
[02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:41.190]  so like I
[02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:46.530]  Can I can tell you what we did here in Humboldt and how that happened and then how it influenced other large companies?
[02:45:46.530 --> 02:45:48.450]  and so
[02:45:48.450 --> 02:45:53.490]  Cookies said a we would like to be able to work with producers in the triangle to get better outdoor flower
[02:45:53.490 --> 02:45:59.170]  and so we create a situation where it allows us to be able to work with these small producers by
[02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:03.330]  providing them the genes we want to have sold in the market and
[02:46:04.570 --> 02:46:11.850]  It allows then the small farmer to get into a dispensary as a top-shelf product because a big brand is pushing it
[02:46:12.090 --> 02:46:15.850]  You get your full identity. You're not a white label. You don't want a white label
[02:46:15.970 --> 02:46:21.970]  You can't white label as a small farmer man. You gotta get brand value so that you're able to build your
[02:46:22.570 --> 02:46:25.530]  Demand right a white labels anybody they can just put anybody in a bag
[02:46:25.930 --> 02:46:33.090]  So cookies gives you your full vector file on the bag. You get the full identity you hand you grow a certain quantity
[02:46:33.090 --> 02:46:37.770]  They'll handle all the marketing and it worked really well. It drove great attention to the farmers
[02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:41.130]  It got the quality of the outdoor for cookies way up. Oh
[02:46:41.890 --> 02:46:46.890]  Another giant company their lead buyer hit me up and said Kev
[02:46:47.610 --> 02:46:50.050]  We love what we saw that took place in humble
[02:46:50.490 --> 02:46:55.750]  We replicated it and we moved X amount of units through craft people
[02:46:56.170 --> 02:47:00.850]  Because the reality of it is is the big brand realizes that if you want to get the whole pie
[02:47:01.450 --> 02:47:05.650]  Satisfied they can only produce so many slices themselves
[02:47:05.810 --> 02:47:12.210]  They do not have the ability to do the weird fringe shit because it doesn't fit into their business model
[02:47:12.430 --> 02:47:14.430]  But buying it from you
[02:47:14.650 --> 02:47:21.090]  Getting a price that's reasonable that you agree on and then selling it and then being able to have the diversity
[02:47:21.090 --> 02:47:27.930]  and what it does too is it it alleviates some of the issues the big companies go through about you're not real and
[02:47:28.890 --> 02:47:35.490]  when you have small farms that you can point to and then the small farm says I was paid and I was treated fairly and
[02:47:35.490 --> 02:47:37.130]  I'm gonna do it again next year
[02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:38.210]  There's no abuse
[02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:44.570]  And so for me the what you have to be able to remember is your job is to be good at what you do
[02:47:44.770 --> 02:47:51.290]  Right. So if you're B grade producer, you got a problem you really do you about to just I told my friend the other day
[02:47:51.290 --> 02:47:55.330]  I was like look if you can't keep your shit together at this point in the game just retire. I
[02:47:55.890 --> 02:47:59.010]  Wasn't I wasn't trying to be mean but I'm like look if you're still struggling
[02:47:59.090 --> 02:48:04.850]  You should just retire because there's no place left for you except to grow your own smoke for your head
[02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:07.650]  But if you're trying to put a product into the market
[02:48:08.650 --> 02:48:12.490]  The competitive market of 2022, holy shit, that better be good
[02:48:13.050 --> 02:48:19.490]  But craft farmers typically do a good job just because you small doesn't mean you good and just because you're big doesn't mean you're crooked
[02:48:20.050 --> 02:48:22.210]  It it we like that
[02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:27.770]  We like to make it easy to say that but it's not real a lot of small producers suck and a lot of big people
[02:48:27.770 --> 02:48:31.270]  Aren't bad what it comes down to is be good at what you do
[02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:34.270]  Develop something that's
[02:48:34.590 --> 02:48:40.590]  Irreplaceable non like NFTs non fungible token non replaceable. I can't get a substitute
[02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:42.590]  That's what makes an NFT an NFT
[02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:46.350]  It's a non substitutable thing the product coming from your farm
[02:48:46.470 --> 02:48:50.870]  If you choose the genomic selection correctly you produce it in a way that
[02:48:51.470 --> 02:48:57.990]  Maximizes it and you make sure you handle it after harvest correctly up until you hand the product over
[02:48:58.390 --> 02:49:03.110]  You have an ability and so most of these bigger companies are slowly starting to realize
[02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:08.390]  that that's a good route cookies picked it up quick and I and and and
[02:49:09.310 --> 02:49:12.990]  They get a lot of shit right and and you know burners and vulture
[02:49:12.990 --> 02:49:17.110]  I'm like burner grew up in the hustle the kid ground wheat old wheat hustle weed
[02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:20.090]  How much more real do you have to be he was selling as a kid?
[02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:23.970]  He develops his business what makes it different with with way
[02:49:23.970 --> 02:49:30.550]  I see him is that he understands primarily the business of weed because he's been in it. It's all like so
[02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:37.470]  When he succeeds at that goal it let these other companies that are not run by people who are from weed
[02:49:37.770 --> 02:49:43.550]  Realize well if he's doing it, we should copy and then I I know not all of them
[02:49:43.550 --> 02:49:49.450]  But I know a shitload of the people that move all the herb and all these big brands and they're like man
[02:49:49.450 --> 02:49:52.170]  It's working out well for us to make these relationships
[02:49:52.170 --> 02:49:55.570]  so what you got to do first is make sure you you dial in your shit and
[02:49:56.330 --> 02:49:59.290]  What you got to do is you got to get somebody to come in and evaluate it
[02:49:59.290 --> 02:50:01.970]  That's not you or your friends because you're all gonna pat each other on the back
[02:50:02.290 --> 02:50:07.530]  You need a buyer to come in and rip your shit to pieces because that's the reality that they're in right?
[02:50:07.970 --> 02:50:09.970]  You know, I don't care what happened yesterday
[02:50:10.050 --> 02:50:17.130]  What today is what we care about when you can get a buyer who's aggressive to agree your product is high-level
[02:50:17.170 --> 02:50:18.810]  You're in
[02:50:18.810 --> 02:50:24.650]  But you're able to do now is remember that when you deal with people don't be a pain in the ass I
[02:50:25.130 --> 02:50:26.730]  Mean, holy shit
[02:50:26.730 --> 02:50:34.810]  You you you you see such conflict between them where the small operators letting the big one know that you don't know what you're doing
[02:50:34.810 --> 02:50:36.770]  And I'm like homie, you're a beggar
[02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:39.530]  What you need to do is say how can we work together?
[02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:44.610]  And I'm not here to attack you for your lack of cannabis lifetime experience
[02:50:44.930 --> 02:50:49.370]  Because for some reason my lifetime experience isn't really making me any money so it's not working either
[02:50:50.010 --> 02:50:53.090]  So there's this reality of calm yourself down
[02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:56.650]  Showcase your work and
[02:50:56.650 --> 02:51:01.810]  Then look for companies that are trying to make smart decisions where they have a specific lane
[02:51:02.090 --> 02:51:04.090]  Because if their lane is your lane
[02:51:04.090 --> 02:51:10.290]  How are you going to benefit that you're going to compete and if you're doing the same thing they are they don't need you
[02:51:10.650 --> 02:51:13.890]  So you you you work on making sure that you have?
[02:51:14.730 --> 02:51:16.730]  non fungible component
[02:51:17.290 --> 02:51:20.490]  That's attractive and that's not hard to sell
[02:51:21.250 --> 02:51:25.850]  But it requires you to be thoughtful and you can't take the easy route and say well
[02:51:25.850 --> 02:51:30.850]  Hey John and and nothing against gelato 41 it changed the cannabis game from deck
[02:51:30.850 --> 02:51:36.130]  I mean shit everything's a derivative of it and and I know Mario right and he's solid I like him
[02:51:36.450 --> 02:51:42.690]  It's it's it's it's just really a matter of if every top brand has got a 41 selection
[02:51:42.690 --> 02:51:47.610]  You probably shouldn't go there when 41 first came out when 30 when he's when he's Joe out his first came out
[02:51:47.610 --> 02:51:52.730]  It was great for anybody because we hadn't over saturated the market, but as we oversaturate
[02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:56.650]  People gravitate to it and they go that's what I'm gonna go
[02:51:56.650 --> 02:52:03.950]  That's what I'm gonna do and the problem is you have 15 20 30 40 choices that are comparable and yours may be a little bit
[02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:06.930]  better, but they're 20 bucks cheaper, so
[02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:13.790]  Really it's it's it's a you've got to live in the real and I think for most small operators
[02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:18.090]  The best thing you could do is get someone to come in and evaluate. That's why I love the ganja and
[02:52:18.650 --> 02:52:19.730]  that
[02:52:19.730 --> 02:52:24.290]  the point of the ganja is to do third-party validation of a product with a
[02:52:25.290 --> 02:52:29.990]  Criteria that you can understand so that you can sit down and go through it with them and you can argue all day
[02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:34.050]  But it's like look it's clear how many trike heads are remaining not many okay?
[02:52:34.050 --> 02:52:38.690]  It's not many so I can't call it an a there because none of the heads are here
[02:52:39.890 --> 02:52:43.170]  How do we look on set? Oh? It's not that loud, okay?
[02:52:43.170 --> 02:52:45.410]  Well, it's not that loud and how about the flavor?
[02:52:45.410 --> 02:52:48.790]  What's not that that's not that developed and we can agree well pretty soon
[02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:51.930]  you're able to take someone through an assessment and say look it's a beat and
[02:52:52.690 --> 02:52:56.450]  And maybe we could work to help you understand like where you went wrong
[02:52:56.890 --> 02:53:03.570]  But what you need is you need third-party assessment of your product so that you have somebody who's not emotionally connected to your shit
[02:53:04.050 --> 02:53:11.290]  Doing it because you read the one you either one way or the other I either deal with farmers that are hyperaggressive on their product
[02:53:11.290 --> 02:53:15.690]  And I'm like Jesus Christ, and you're grading it to death. I said give it another point. It's really good or
[02:53:16.610 --> 02:53:19.850]  It's the best ever everybody says I'm the best grower
[02:53:19.850 --> 02:53:24.170]  They ever met and I grow the best pot anybody's ever seen and I'm like I shit the C- bro
[02:53:24.890 --> 02:53:28.770]  You got to get up. You've got to get a third-party person in there. Who's not
[02:53:29.770 --> 02:53:36.170]  Trying to make you happy with the answer they're just giving you an answer and that'll that'll let you know
[02:53:37.290 --> 02:53:42.770]  Evaluation of what you do figure out go to every dispensary around you and take a look at the menus
[02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:45.570]  I just did this with a group the other day. I said, let's go take a look at that dispensaries
[02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:49.650]  I said, I'm gonna show you some common shit. Do you see the commonalities that are available?
[02:53:49.650 --> 02:53:54.170]  That means distribution only deals with those companies so they sell the same shit at every store
[02:53:54.690 --> 02:54:01.490]  We have to go to certain stores that focus on some unique things because their buyers understand their clientele better
[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:06.650]  Those are the stores you're gonna want your product to end up in those are the stores that you have to ask
[02:54:06.970 --> 02:54:09.290]  If I wanted to get my product in your store
[02:54:09.490 --> 02:54:16.210]  What distributor services your store and then you're able to talk to the distributor and say I have product
[02:54:16.210 --> 02:54:20.690]  I want to move into the store and then you can kind of take a look but it has to be I
[02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:23.170]  Want to say gentleman like but
[02:54:23.450 --> 02:54:27.970]  It doesn't it I said that somebody had been I realized it doesn't include women because it's gentlemen
[02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:36.250]  It needs to include everyone. So it's about behaving in a manner that allows you to be able to not be aggressive
[02:54:36.890 --> 02:54:41.530]  So that people want to deal with you and when you come in and you're pissy because you're angry
[02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:46.130]  No one gives a shit and no one cares about your struggle because everybody's got their own
[02:54:46.890 --> 02:54:52.570]  So it has to be the reality of a unique product that can't be found elsewhere
[02:54:52.770 --> 02:54:57.890]  It's grown to a high level and you promote it and present it in a way
[02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:59.810]  that's
[02:54:59.810 --> 02:55:01.810]  reflective of a good vibe and
[02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:05.090]  That is a sellable product
[02:55:06.330 --> 02:55:08.330]  That shit works
[02:55:08.410 --> 02:55:10.410]  Yeah for sure
[02:55:11.410 --> 02:55:15.250]  All right, Kev. It's been it's been wonderful chatting
[02:55:16.130 --> 02:55:21.910]  For a little piece of advice anybody thinking getting in the Canada commercial cannabis business right now
[02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:26.490]  Why don't you just wait a couple years? It'll be a different world than I think but
[02:55:26.930 --> 02:55:31.150]  Don't don't take my word for it. If you think you can slay the dragon
[02:55:31.570 --> 02:55:34.090]  Come come on in the water is warm
[02:55:35.770 --> 02:55:37.770]  You remember though like
[02:55:38.130 --> 02:55:41.850]  When you enter something it's moving. Yeah
[02:55:41.970 --> 02:55:43.170]  It
[02:55:43.170 --> 02:55:45.170]  You everyone's ahead of you
[02:55:45.290 --> 02:55:52.650]  So what the to me the better way to approach it is to enter it at the level that affords the least risk
[02:55:53.130 --> 02:55:58.210]  There you go after you have to mitigate risk. It's like, you know when you're doing criminal shit, right?
[02:55:58.210 --> 02:56:01.170]  You got to make sure I had a lawyer on retainer for 25 years, man
[02:56:01.170 --> 02:56:05.090]  We I'm fucking guys like my father for Christ's sakes. I spent so much time with them
[02:56:05.250 --> 02:56:08.730]  It's about mitigating risk so that taking your moves
[02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:11.410]  You have an outlet
[02:56:11.650 --> 02:56:13.650]  and so what
[02:56:15.250 --> 02:56:17.250]  But if you went to the dispensaries
[02:56:17.410 --> 02:56:23.890]  Really and understood products and you understood service and you will look at distribution and you understood that
[02:56:24.570 --> 02:56:29.310]  You went to cultivation and saw the the increase in technological efficiency
[02:56:29.370 --> 02:56:36.130]  You went to outdoor cultivators and realized the incredible research that they do on biological delivery
[02:56:36.690 --> 02:56:42.690]  You you you you you study and you're relentlessly pushing your shit forward
[02:56:42.690 --> 02:56:47.170]  So the day you can enter you're not three four years behind because you can't catch
[02:56:47.570 --> 02:56:50.050]  No people. I don't like ketchup. I'm more about mustard
[02:56:50.650 --> 02:56:55.770]  Mmm, I like mustard and so you've got to get in the game
[02:56:55.770 --> 02:56:58.530]  But at the level that doesn't kick the shit out of you
[02:56:58.530 --> 02:57:02.330]  So when you go in mortgage your house to go buy a grow I'm like, whoa
[02:57:02.730 --> 02:57:09.130]  Yeah, it happens too I I hear I hear stories, you know, I've I've mortgaged my house I have no money left
[02:57:09.130 --> 02:57:14.650]  Would you please come in and invest with me? It's like oh, yeah, that's that sounds promising
[02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:20.010]  Well, it's a fire sale you end up it is promising to the right person because they come in and salvage your ass
[02:57:20.010 --> 02:57:21.010]  Yeah
[02:57:21.010 --> 02:57:24.850]  And so what you got to do though is you can't you can't wait to get in the game
[02:57:25.410 --> 02:57:27.970]  But you also have to be able to understand that
[02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:33.810]  It takes time to get good and what I notice is that most people have this idea that once I get in there
[02:57:33.810 --> 02:57:38.290]  I'm so intuitively bright and incredible. I'm just gonna do something. No one ever done and I was
[02:57:38.290 --> 02:57:41.650]  I hit I shook my people's mouths. I laugh and I'm like, well, what the fuck you doing right now?
[02:57:41.650 --> 02:57:43.650]  That makes you think you're so smart
[02:57:43.650 --> 02:57:48.450]  Right because if you were so goddamn smart, you wouldn't be waiting to do anything. You're to be in you're to be done
[02:57:48.450 --> 02:57:51.450]  Yeah, right. You would have been it you would have been there earlier
[02:57:51.450 --> 02:57:54.970]  You would have already understood you missed the in the initial step
[02:57:54.970 --> 02:57:58.650]  You would have already understood you missed the in the initiation curve
[02:57:59.290 --> 02:58:02.210]  so it's about controlling your ego and
[02:58:03.370 --> 02:58:04.930]  understanding that
[02:58:04.930 --> 02:58:09.130]  Every aspect of every business in the world is nuanced
[02:58:09.130 --> 02:58:10.090]  I don't give a shit
[02:58:10.090 --> 02:58:15.410]  Everyone thinks people holding shovels are stupid hold that fucking thing and shovel rock for ten hours a day every day of the week and
[02:58:15.410 --> 02:58:17.410]  Tell me they don't have a technique that is refined
[02:58:18.490 --> 02:58:23.010]  Yeah, I respect anyone that applies themself to their craft. I
[02:58:23.730 --> 02:58:28.290]  Don't respect you if you don't as a human I respect you but not as a craftsman
[02:58:28.290 --> 02:58:30.290]  I'm like, you know putting any time in on the job
[02:58:30.410 --> 02:58:35.570]  You're gonna pay I found it from what from what you got the opt-on line your keyboard genius
[02:58:35.930 --> 02:58:38.170]  Yeah, take it away and you're not so smart
[02:58:38.170 --> 02:58:42.770]  And that's what you got to be able to do is just realize that you have to play the game in real time
[02:58:43.170 --> 02:58:47.530]  You got to be able to like if you really want to be here. This is something you really want to do
[02:58:48.210 --> 02:58:55.450]  Then you got to commit you can't be good if you're not putting your work in I don't count
[02:58:56.530 --> 02:58:59.250]  For sure, you know smart people go quicker
[02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:08.350]  But that doesn't mean that if you're you're a hard worker you won't become smart and if you're a hard worker
[02:59:08.350 --> 02:59:14.450]  You won't become rich. It's possible. There's a there's a route one must take you have to work harder
[02:59:15.050 --> 02:59:17.050]  but
[02:59:17.170 --> 02:59:20.450]  What's it what's it worth to you, you know, so I saw I approach it
[02:59:20.450 --> 02:59:24.690]  I approach everything like I like I get in the game and every room I walk in I'm like, okay
[02:59:24.690 --> 02:59:26.810]  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I admit it. I don't know I'm doing
[02:59:28.010 --> 02:59:35.250]  Ask questions and I get direction and I relentlessly hunt that shit down till I have the big picture in my hand
[02:59:35.250 --> 02:59:39.390]  And then I can then go back to those people and say, okay. I think I have the concepts down
[02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:41.530]  Can I reiterate them to you?
[02:59:42.290 --> 02:59:44.730]  Can you now give me feedback about?
[02:59:45.570 --> 02:59:47.250]  Direction am I close and
[02:59:47.250 --> 02:59:49.370]  Then say yeah, you're catching the picture
[02:59:49.370 --> 02:59:55.690]  I'm like great then I know to continue and then they can say you've reached my level of proficiency here
[02:59:55.730 --> 03:00:01.570]  You need to go somewhere else and then you look for where the next person is to be able to get a clue as to
[03:00:01.770 --> 03:00:06.030]  Where to go what people do is they want to crawl in your pocket crawl in your shit
[03:00:06.090 --> 03:00:10.130]  Take your information run with it like they geniuses and I'm like that shit is real
[03:00:10.530 --> 03:00:16.650]  What's real is people that have got their shit together will almost always help you out if all you're asking for is
[03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:19.170]  clarity of direction and then
[03:00:19.490 --> 03:00:23.650]  Can I ask you a question in six months when I'm done reading the book and doing a project?
[03:00:23.650 --> 03:00:25.970]  Could I just ask like does this make sense?
[03:00:26.490 --> 03:00:31.770]  It's rare that someone who's worked hard won't because they respect the fact that you're approaching them in that way
[03:00:32.650 --> 03:00:34.970]  The idea I need to come live with you. I
[03:00:35.930 --> 03:00:40.490]  Mean fuck I eat is constantly I'm like I want you to mentor me and that's it
[03:00:40.490 --> 03:00:42.490]  We want to just fucking hang out me all day
[03:00:42.650 --> 03:00:48.550]  Doing what right like I'm like, come on if you come you don't get any support that way
[03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:50.550]  But if you're like, hey, I'm trying hard
[03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:54.090]  Can I please ask a simple question about direction?
[03:00:54.330 --> 03:00:59.910]  Because the question is brief the answer is brief and it's pointed but people say hey question
[03:01:00.510 --> 03:01:02.510]  You
[03:01:02.510 --> 03:01:06.150]  Sentence to write but it's gonna take me a fucking book to answer
[03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:10.230]  so it has to be the give-and-take and
[03:01:11.350 --> 03:01:14.310]  People they our society isn't good at this
[03:01:14.310 --> 03:01:20.950]  We're just not and it's about respecting the individuals time and their efforts and the fact that most of them that are on top
[03:01:21.070 --> 03:01:23.070]  They had to do something to get there
[03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:28.550]  So you're thankful and when you find those people that are cool in return don't screw that up
[03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:30.870]  Don't burn the goddamn bridge
[03:01:31.630 --> 03:01:37.630]  It I see that too. You want to make sure you're able to really create a situation where you're respected
[03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:40.870]  What you want respect more than anything?
[03:01:41.310 --> 03:01:47.510]  Mm-hmm, and that that that gives you all the entry and and access anybody could ask for so
[03:01:48.670 --> 03:01:51.310]  That's the end of the station, but I had a great time right?
[03:01:51.310 --> 03:01:53.310]  What's your
[03:01:55.310 --> 03:01:57.990]  London it was a great time FCP. Oh
[03:01:58.990 --> 03:02:03.550]  Thank you, and it's been wonderful. Can you London? Can you play our?
[03:02:04.470 --> 03:02:08.910]  X our intro extra and it's been good to see everybody. I'm glad to do it and
[03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:16.510]  God bless the whole group of you guys. We just want you to be a better grower and a better person
[03:02:17.550 --> 03:02:19.550]  Thank you
