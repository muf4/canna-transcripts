[00:01.280 --> 00:09.360]  Good morning everyone it is 10 a.m. Pacific Time 11 in the mountains where
[00:09.360 --> 00:18.800]  these two are but three of us Wendy, Leighton, and myself are all West Coast
[00:18.800 --> 00:24.320]  so thanks for joining us and Brian take it away. Yes good morning Living Soil
[00:24.320 --> 00:27.760]  Nerds again every Thursday we're trying to bring you some of the best and
[00:27.760 --> 00:31.240]  brightest that we feel like Leighton and I hand select the guests that are
[00:31.240 --> 00:36.720]  part of this and I think that Wendy is the epitome in my opinion of someone
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.680]  that goes out of her way to educate so Wendy I want to give the spotlight to
[00:41.680 --> 00:44.800]  you today but I have a lot of questions a lot of people on Instagram had a lot
[00:44.800 --> 00:47.880]  of questions for you that I'm sure we're gonna get to but I feel like a lot of
[00:47.880 --> 00:50.760]  people might need to know more about your background the fact that you're an
[00:50.760 --> 00:55.400]  mostly outdoor cannabis farmer from what I understand I hope I'm not misspeaking
[00:55.400 --> 01:01.040]  there and just your you know your openness on your journey through natural
[01:01.040 --> 01:04.360]  farming and how it seemed like it you know you didn't get those concepts right
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.880]  away which I've also experienced myself so I appreciate you taking the time to
[01:09.880 --> 01:18.360]  speak with us today. Yeah absolutely I am primarily an outdoor cultivator I have
[01:18.360 --> 01:22.760]  done a lot of indoor I've done greenhouse I've pretty much run the
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.760]  gamut as far as it goes but I do prefer growing outdoor and I'm really blessed
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.600]  that I live in Northern California where we can do that exceptionally well and we
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.040]  don't have to be in these you know really indoor type of environments and
[01:37.040 --> 01:43.080]  we don't even really need greenhouses. Actually Wendy, Wendy remember the Max
[01:43.080 --> 01:51.160]  headroom comment before? That's you girl. Yes. So can you actually put your
[01:51.320 --> 02:00.120]  earbuds in the in the case and just use the just use the phones audio pickup?
[02:00.120 --> 02:12.960]  Yeah I can do that. Be warned I have children. That sounds amazing. That's
[02:12.960 --> 02:42.340]  amazing. All right. Carry on. Start over Wendy. Start over. Okay. And here we go.
[02:42.420 --> 02:49.260]  Okay. Life, technology, good things right? So all right so I'll start over and say
[02:49.260 --> 02:53.220]  that I am primarily an outdoor cultivator I have done indoor I have
[02:53.220 --> 02:59.500]  done greenhouses I've been growing for oh gosh 30 plus years now so um you know
[02:59.500 --> 03:02.940]  when it comes to how to cultivate and the different techniques I've pretty
[03:02.940 --> 03:07.500]  much done it all with the exception of a large warehouse in Oakland I never did
[03:07.500 --> 03:15.220]  that but close to that so that being said you know I do prefer growing
[03:15.220 --> 03:18.620]  outdoor I'm blessed that I live in Northern California and were able to do
[03:18.620 --> 03:25.340]  that exceptionally well I'm not in you know I well you know I say I want to say
[03:25.340 --> 03:28.260]  places like Michigan and Maine and then I actually know people in Michigan and
[03:28.260 --> 03:32.740]  Maine that grow outdoor and while they do have a few more challenges they can
[03:32.740 --> 03:37.340]  pull it off extremely well up there too so and you know I've talked with people
[03:37.420 --> 03:40.940]  to say well I'm in this area and I can't actually grow outdoor and I'm like you
[03:40.940 --> 03:45.700]  know you can really do anything that you pay attention to and that you really
[03:45.700 --> 03:50.020]  want to do it may take a little more of a learning curve and you may have to do
[03:50.020 --> 03:53.980]  things a little bit differently but saying that you can't do it is that is
[03:53.980 --> 04:00.460]  not really I don't know I just don't believe in that personally so um yeah so
[04:00.460 --> 04:05.460]  my background second-generation cultivator from Southern Humboldt County
[04:05.460 --> 04:10.700]  so and again like I said I've been doing this for many many years and as
[04:10.700 --> 04:20.100]  far as natural farming goes and you know I it was a rough start for me I've
[04:20.100 --> 04:24.820]  always done organic I've always cultivated you know with this ideology
[04:24.820 --> 04:30.180]  that you just you know you just grow like or pardon me you just grow
[04:30.180 --> 04:34.780]  organically like so my my family this is funny I can actually see all this like
[04:34.780 --> 04:39.100]  all of you guys that are talking which is really really cool and and a little
[04:39.100 --> 04:43.500]  distracting so sorry I just noticed it I'm gonna be able to focus I promise
[04:43.500 --> 04:47.500]  yesterday was my birthday and I was up far too late talking with friends also
[04:47.500 --> 04:56.100]  so I apologize for that but um so organic cultivation has been a part of
[04:56.100 --> 05:04.380]  my family forever we had a one acre garden quote-unquote and that basically
[05:04.460 --> 05:09.500]  was the subsistence for my family for the entire year my mom grew all the
[05:09.500 --> 05:16.620]  vegetables she can she pickled we dried food we did you know all of that of what
[05:16.620 --> 05:21.980]  that looks like I like I don't recall buying much for produce in the grocery
[05:21.980 --> 05:28.340]  store so and then we also had apple trees and some grape vines and things
[05:28.340 --> 05:33.580]  like that so but the whole point here is that she always cultivated that using
[05:33.580 --> 05:38.060]  like organic what we consider organic methodology I didn't at the time know
[05:38.060 --> 05:43.780]  that that's what that was that was just how you grew food was you put manure in
[05:43.780 --> 05:47.540]  the ground you put different amendments in the ground my parents did a
[05:47.540 --> 05:56.180]  rototiller so they would till that in and that was how you grew it was in 2016
[05:56.180 --> 06:00.420]  I believe in the Emerald Cup when they were announcing the regenerative farm
[06:00.420 --> 06:04.940]  award and I remember sitting there and they're talking about it and I went what
[06:04.940 --> 06:09.900]  is regenerative farming like what does that even mean I'd get out my phone and
[06:09.900 --> 06:15.420]  I googled and I was like oh regenerative farming it says that that is when you
[06:15.420 --> 06:22.020]  put more into the soil than you take out and I stopped and I was like that's just
[06:22.020 --> 06:26.060]  how you grow things like I don't understand what does that even this is
[06:26.060 --> 06:29.740]  something that you know we're giving a special award for this like that's
[06:29.740 --> 06:36.420]  farming and I really had to stop myself and think about the fact that you know
[06:36.420 --> 06:40.900]  industrial agriculture does not actually cultivate that way right
[06:40.900 --> 06:46.420]  they use pesticides and herbicides and then they have to you know bottle feed
[06:46.420 --> 06:50.740]  the food that they're growing because there's no nutrients left in the soil
[06:50.740 --> 06:55.620]  because there's no food soil web and soil food web and it's just a mess and
[06:55.780 --> 06:59.940]  so for me that was really kind of eye-opening and I was like ah okay so
[06:59.940 --> 07:04.860]  the way that I have grown up and the way that I have learned to cultivate not
[07:04.860 --> 07:12.260]  just food but medicine and really just the soil itself is not the norm and so
[07:12.260 --> 07:18.260]  that was yeah so again that was in 2016 and at that point I had no idea what
[07:18.260 --> 07:22.460]  Korean natural farming was I just knew that this is how you grow food which is
[07:22.580 --> 07:26.700]  with you know normal manures and you know amending your soil basically
[07:26.700 --> 07:33.100]  stewarding your land as opposed to just you know pushing out large yields of
[07:33.100 --> 07:37.500]  food for whatever that might be in general like a lot of industrial
[07:37.500 --> 07:44.220]  agriculture is growing for cattle industry and fodder for for animals
[07:44.220 --> 07:47.980]  right a lot of us know about that and and for weird things like I don't know
[07:47.980 --> 07:56.060]  Rice Krispies or something right so um so yeah so basically at that point I had
[07:56.060 --> 08:01.620]  already been always growing naturally didn't really know about natural farming
[08:01.620 --> 08:09.060]  itself and in oh my gosh I guess it was right around there actually was when I
[08:09.060 --> 08:13.100]  first got introduced to Korean natural farming now the rest of the world just
[08:13.100 --> 08:17.780]  knows it as natural farming we like to put disclaimers on things so in America
[08:18.060 --> 08:23.900]  we call it KNF or Korean natural farming and I started playing around with it at
[08:23.900 --> 08:30.860]  that point but I was using really bad translations and like some that are out
[08:30.860 --> 08:35.580]  there that are just kind of straight-up wrong and I had no idea what I was doing
[08:35.580 --> 08:39.620]  I just thought this was like a cool fun thing to try and you know if it allowed
[08:39.620 --> 08:45.860]  me to buy even less nutrients that was great and I think my first product the
[08:45.860 --> 08:53.340]  first thing I ever made was a fermented plant juice also known as FPJ and had no
[08:53.340 --> 08:58.340]  idea what I was doing so I was using these huge thistles with the roots and
[08:58.340 --> 09:06.940]  dirt everything on it total mess I made about gosh I think I think I started
[09:06.940 --> 09:14.700]  with 20 gallons of thistles and ended up with two five-gallon buckets and it was
[09:15.700 --> 09:21.620]  honestly when I look back at it it's so funny because it was disgusting it was
[09:21.620 --> 09:26.940]  really not a very good product that I made that first time and then once I had
[09:26.940 --> 09:35.460]  it I had no idea what to do with it so I had this syrupy dirty thing and I went
[09:35.460 --> 09:38.380]  online and I was like okay you guys what do I do now and everybody said oh you
[09:38.380 --> 09:42.740]  just like pour it on your plants and I was like okay yay so I think I diluted
[09:42.740 --> 09:51.580]  it maybe 50-50 and literally dumped it on the soil of my garden beds and first
[09:51.580 --> 09:56.780]  off I burnt things which was really surprising to me I was like I did not
[09:56.780 --> 10:05.340]  expect that to happen I mean crisped everything it was crazy and um and then
[10:05.340 --> 10:10.380]  I brought in so many ants it was insane because I wasn't using it right and I
[10:10.380 --> 10:14.820]  didn't know I didn't temper it with any other products it was literally basically
[10:14.820 --> 10:19.220]  the syrupy sugar water that I poured on everything that has really high growth
[10:19.220 --> 10:23.380]  hormones and all kinds of amazing things when you use it right but when you use
[10:23.380 --> 10:29.580]  it wrong it's yeah it was a problem so it was it was a high learning curve at
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.180]  that point and I was like all right obviously I don't really know what I'm
[10:33.180 --> 10:38.780]  doing here and at that point I started watching more YouTube videos and then I
[10:38.780 --> 10:45.220]  went to Boise Idaho in 2018 and took a class from Chris Trump and that was what
[10:45.220 --> 10:50.720]  changed everything for me I instantly went from you know I have no idea what
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.660]  I'm doing and I'm kind of trying to do things and I really just obviously I
[10:56.660 --> 11:00.940]  screwed things up and I didn't know why and the information online at that time
[11:00.940 --> 11:05.620]  there's a lot more out there for now but a couple years ago there was it was very
[11:05.620 --> 11:11.940]  very actually that was four years ago very very very limited information and a
[11:11.940 --> 11:18.780]  lot of it was just wrong so after taking the class I was like wow I was I mean you
[11:18.780 --> 11:24.820]  know the things that I thought I understood at that point were just it
[11:24.820 --> 11:34.900]  was it was bad it's really bad and and it is all about the nuances with this
[11:34.900 --> 11:39.340]  farming methodology so the more that I go down it and the more that I start to
[11:39.340 --> 11:46.340]  understand why so when you first are learning K&F you don't really get to
[11:46.340 --> 11:50.700]  learn it but you know it's not that you don't get to learn it's that you're
[11:50.700 --> 11:54.220]  taught some basics so what we found is that a lot of people don't actually have
[11:54.220 --> 11:59.700]  just a basic understanding of how to do this stuff and you need to learn that
[11:59.700 --> 12:04.580]  before you really start kind of wrapping your mind around why and so a
[12:04.580 --> 12:09.900]  lot of people that get started you know there's a reason why FPJ and LAB so FPJ
[12:09.900 --> 12:16.020]  fermented plant juice LAB is lactic acid bacteria which is a serum that is used
[12:16.020 --> 12:21.740]  sometimes I don't use it in my garden really at all and makes amazing cheese
[12:21.740 --> 12:27.660]  it makes an amazing gut health for your human biome but I don't really use it a
[12:27.660 --> 12:33.500]  whole lot in farming but they're easy inputs to make so it can actually give
[12:33.500 --> 12:39.820]  you some really good confidence that you can do this and then what you really
[12:39.820 --> 12:43.500]  want to start doing it is get into indigenous microorganisms and that's the
[12:43.500 --> 12:50.500]  key like as soon as that started popping off for me the health of the farm was I
[12:50.500 --> 12:55.900]  mean leaps and bounds different and all of a sudden I was like okay this is what
[12:55.900 --> 13:00.220]  this is about yes we make all these other inputs like water soluble calcium
[13:00.220 --> 13:06.580]  and water soluble potassium and those are all great and wonderful but it's not
[13:06.580 --> 13:13.100]  really where it's at like the jam is all about the indigenous microorganisms and
[13:13.100 --> 13:17.780]  that is all about soil health and once your soil health is there the rest of it
[13:17.780 --> 13:22.420]  is easy like it's it's cake after that man you don't I don't even really use
[13:22.420 --> 13:25.860]  any of the other inputs little little amounts here and there for light
[13:25.860 --> 13:33.620]  deprivation more so but really soil health is I mean it's where it's at it's
[13:33.620 --> 13:43.430]  that's what it's all about so actually Wendy just quickly someone asked and can
[13:43.430 --> 13:46.870]  you talk about why I think it's interesting that you're not really big
[13:46.870 --> 13:53.630]  on using labs in the garden because I think that's like the word or the
[13:53.630 --> 14:01.510]  acronym people most associated um yeah you see that question from it's it's not
[14:01.510 --> 14:09.270]  that I don't use them I just don't find them as necessary so when we make liquid
[14:09.270 --> 14:16.070]  IMO or fermented seawater you use LA you can use LA be in that but the reality is
[14:16.070 --> 14:22.150]  is that less so LA be lactic acid bacteria so labs are present everywhere
[14:22.150 --> 14:27.190]  they're in the air that's how we make this particular solution is we literally
[14:27.190 --> 14:32.190]  are capturing the LA be the lactic acid bacteria that's in the air naturally
[14:32.190 --> 14:37.270]  we're inoculating it in a rice water wash we're using that to inoculate milk
[14:37.270 --> 14:42.070]  and you get this high this serum that has a large amount of lactic acid
[14:42.070 --> 14:46.590]  bacteria and they're great I mean they're they're wonderful bacteria to
[14:46.590 --> 14:51.830]  have they outcompete a lot of things there and I believe that Drake calls
[14:51.830 --> 14:57.710]  them the the police of the soil so they'll go through and you know kind of
[14:57.710 --> 15:03.230]  keep things in check and keep things in order but the truth for me is that it's
[15:03.230 --> 15:10.590]  one of those inputs that tends to get overused and it's kind of there anyway
[15:10.590 --> 15:15.390]  like when you make a liquid IMO if you scope that you'll see LA be in that
[15:15.390 --> 15:23.470]  naturally without having to add an LA be serum to it so yeah I mean there's
[15:23.470 --> 15:27.190]  nothing wrong with using it I don't don't get me wrong on that it's it's a
[15:27.190 --> 15:32.230]  wonderful input I just personally I don't find that I tend to use that that
[15:32.230 --> 15:37.190]  much there's a lot going on in the cannabis industry right now with people
[15:37.190 --> 15:46.750]  claiming LA be as a powdery mildew suppressant or preventative personally I
[15:46.750 --> 15:54.470]  feel like the jury is still out on that I don't know for certain that it's the
[15:54.470 --> 16:00.270]  best thing to use and actually I kind of feel like there's a possibility and I'll
[16:00.270 --> 16:06.110]  try and do a side-by-side this year I have not been able to do that yet and I
[16:06.110 --> 16:13.710]  actually have to find something that is very like powdery mildew something that
[16:13.710 --> 16:19.230]  will get it for sure so right now like we don't tend to get a lot of powdery
[16:19.230 --> 16:22.750]  mildew actually last year you know so the interesting thing is last year I
[16:22.750 --> 16:28.870]  saw so many people in California and Oregon that had a lot of PM and a lot of
[16:28.870 --> 16:35.270]  that was due to all of the fires that we had so the fires rained down ash the ash
[16:35.270 --> 16:40.790]  caused a pH imbalance on the leaves that pH imbalance allowed powdery mildew to
[16:40.790 --> 16:44.550]  take on and and it got really bad for a lot of people we didn't have so much
[16:44.550 --> 16:51.070]  trouble because I did a whole spray after the fact I treated the soil as
[16:51.070 --> 16:57.310]  well with natural farming and then I used a tempered version of a maintenance
[16:57.310 --> 17:03.350]  solution I increased the vinegar in that so that it would actually balance out
[17:03.350 --> 17:08.350]  and neutralize all the ash and the alkaline nature of the ash itself which
[17:08.350 --> 17:12.470]  got everything back in balance we didn't have powdery mildew but what I figured
[17:12.470 --> 17:20.470]  out was that I think if I can take my ash from my wood fire and cover some
[17:20.470 --> 17:27.750]  plants I can probably get a good a good population of PM on my plants and then I
[17:27.750 --> 17:32.510]  can run this test so what I'm gonna plan on doing hopefully is do a liquid IMO
[17:32.510 --> 17:39.390]  versus an LAB and we'll see which one is better for treating and preventing
[17:39.390 --> 17:44.550]  powdery mildew I suspect it's going to the look be the liquid IMO just because
[17:44.550 --> 17:53.230]  that is a better diversity of fungal fungi rather than the LAB which is just
[17:53.230 --> 17:58.750]  straight lactic acid bacteria but we'll find out for sure this year hopefully so
[17:58.750 --> 18:03.950]  hey if you don't mind I'll jump in on that yeah you know I think the biggest
[18:03.950 --> 18:09.030]  problem is people just have problems in their garden and instead of having a
[18:09.030 --> 18:14.190]  soil balance they rely on some of these solutions to fix it and so when he was
[18:14.190 --> 18:18.590]  talking about is increasing the indigenous microorganisms in the soil
[18:18.590 --> 18:22.910]  will prevent a lot of these things from happening so if you're coming at it
[18:22.910 --> 18:27.110]  backwards with an imbalance and then hitting it with labs or hitting it with
[18:27.110 --> 18:30.910]  some of these other things in many ways you can actually create more problems
[18:30.910 --> 18:35.150]  and that's why it's so important like she said is to really start to
[18:35.150 --> 18:39.550]  understand what this is about not just try to go after it using it because you
[18:39.550 --> 18:43.790]  saw someone else used it for this so can you speak a little more on that Wendy
[18:43.790 --> 18:47.550]  because that's such a big thing is you know not getting IMO and then diving
[18:47.550 --> 18:55.430]  into all of the preparations yeah for sure and this is something and so there's
[18:55.470 --> 19:02.790]  there's kind of this weird disparity with natural farming where there's a lot
[19:02.790 --> 19:08.790]  of people that are on this whole soil food web side where it's not even sides
[19:08.790 --> 19:12.390]  I mean that's that's kind of the weird thing is there's people that say well I
[19:12.390 --> 19:18.470]  follow Elaine Ingham and she does this you know soil food web and she uses
[19:18.470 --> 19:23.590]  compost teas which and all of this is great actively aerated compost teas are
[19:23.590 --> 19:29.790]  amazing and then there's people that say well I do KNF so like we do these
[19:29.790 --> 19:36.270]  ferments and these more you know they're not anaerobic processes but the people
[19:36.270 --> 19:45.510]  that are my friends are funny you guys are funny shush all right so so there
[19:45.510 --> 19:50.870]  are they think that you know these are very different methodologies and they
[19:50.870 --> 19:57.070]  are in a way but they're also both incredibly focused on soil health and
[19:57.070 --> 20:00.750]  it doesn't matter which route you look at if you're looking at natural farming
[20:00.750 --> 20:06.990]  and if you're looking at the soil food web both of those are actually saying
[20:06.990 --> 20:14.310]  the same thing which is that if you have an active living soil all the nutrients
[20:14.310 --> 20:18.950]  that your plants need probably with the exception of nitrogen right because
[20:18.950 --> 20:21.990]  nitrogen gets used up and isn't replenished unless you're putting it
[20:21.990 --> 20:27.950]  back in the ground but everything else is there so when we're talking about
[20:27.950 --> 20:32.590]  using all of these fertilizers and people really have this whole mentality
[20:32.590 --> 20:38.230]  of NPK where they're like nitrogen potassium phosphorus I have to have
[20:38.230 --> 20:42.710]  these ratios I have to do this whole balancing thing of like a five five five
[20:42.710 --> 20:48.150]  or a ten to one or whatever that might be and you start going down natural
[20:48.150 --> 20:52.830]  farming and you're like we don't talk about NPK it's not even it's it's not a
[20:52.830 --> 20:57.390]  thing because you're using these solutions in such small amounts because
[20:57.390 --> 21:02.230]  everything is micronized everything is bioavailable and ready for the plants
[21:02.230 --> 21:10.230]  but even then the the thing is most of this is supposed to be in your soil so
[21:10.230 --> 21:15.910]  if you're treating your soil right it's there now when it's not available to
[21:15.910 --> 21:20.150]  your plants is when you don't have the biology there and specifically we're
[21:20.150 --> 21:27.270]  talking about fungi so when you have a great growth of you know fungal bodies
[21:27.270 --> 21:32.270]  that are in your soil those are literally going down and what they're
[21:32.270 --> 21:36.630]  doing is they're mining all of the nutrients that that plant needs from
[21:36.630 --> 21:41.070]  deeper into the ground so they're going down into the rocks and the minerals and
[21:41.070 --> 21:45.750]  they're saying okay this plant needs this micronutrient so I have this
[21:45.750 --> 21:49.630]  particular rock that has that micronutrient I'm literally going to
[21:49.630 --> 21:53.910]  dissolve it I'm gonna bring it up through my hyphae through the mycelium
[21:53.910 --> 21:58.470]  I'm gonna give it to the plant the plant in return is going to give me sugars and
[21:58.470 --> 22:03.310]  carbohydrates that it's making because it photosynthesizes and it's this really
[22:03.310 --> 22:09.630]  cool balance that happens so when we're sitting here and we're talking about NPK
[22:09.630 --> 22:12.830]  and we're talking about bottled nutrients and we're talking about even
[22:12.950 --> 22:17.990]  with natural farming the inputs that we're making we're still chasing
[22:17.990 --> 22:24.790]  nutrients we're still chasing this cycle that is you know that you're not
[22:24.790 --> 22:29.510]  supposed to be chasing really you want it active in your soil if your soil has
[22:29.510 --> 22:34.470]  it if your soil has the biology it will balance itself out and you don't need to
[22:34.470 --> 22:39.870]  do all of this extra work now and then if there's a you know a deficiency or
[22:39.870 --> 22:43.630]  something going on then yes it's nice to have this in your toolkit where you
[22:43.630 --> 22:49.390]  can say oh shoot I have there's not enough calcium available right now so I
[22:49.390 --> 22:54.190]  have a water-soluble calcium and I can give that a boost or I'm really chasing
[22:54.190 --> 22:58.710]  these high yields so I do want to get more potassium so I have a water
[22:58.710 --> 23:04.430]  soluble potassium that I can use and they're great to have but the reality is
[23:04.430 --> 23:08.710]  that should be present in your soil the other thing I see that drives me
[23:08.710 --> 23:14.750]  absolutely nuts and and I'm totally guilty of it like I I absolutely 100%
[23:14.750 --> 23:21.030]  did not used to do soil tests and now that is a staple it's part of what we do
[23:21.030 --> 23:26.310]  every year two to three times per year is I send my soil samples off and the
[23:26.310 --> 23:31.870]  reason I didn't do it previously is because the people locally were charging
[23:31.870 --> 23:38.030]  I kid you not hundreds of dollars to tell you what your soil looked like and
[23:38.150 --> 23:42.870]  I just couldn't see spending that kind of money at that time when I you know I
[23:42.870 --> 23:47.190]  had something that worked pretty well I knew we added certain amounts of manure
[23:47.190 --> 23:52.790]  certain amounts of oyster shell etc etc so I just kind of stuck with that but
[23:52.790 --> 24:00.510]  after you know doing this more and more I've realized that there's so much to
[24:00.510 --> 24:06.830]  having a soil sample that you that will help dictate what you do and how you do
[24:06.830 --> 24:09.710]  it and knowing so like you know people that are out there and they're like oh
[24:09.710 --> 24:15.870]  well I have I have bad soil I'm like well did you test your soil do you know
[24:15.870 --> 24:19.750]  that you have bad soil I mean we grew some of the best weed we've grown
[24:19.750 --> 24:27.590]  probably ever in first-year amended soil that was a fallow field that never been
[24:27.590 --> 24:33.590]  cultivated it was literally grassland and we did soil tests we amended
[24:33.590 --> 24:37.910]  appropriately and we planted our weed and we gave it water that was it and we
[24:37.910 --> 24:43.390]  did a bunch of liquid IMO because that was grass land that did not have high
[24:43.390 --> 24:48.590]  fungal diversity and I knew that so we we definitely amended with indigenous
[24:48.590 --> 24:52.570]  microorganisms to get our fungal counts up so that we had a better ratio that
[24:52.570 --> 24:58.390]  would communicate with the plant better that was a really long answer to that
[24:58.390 --> 25:02.350]  now that was beautiful Wendy that was absolutely beautiful and I think that
[25:02.350 --> 25:06.670]  you know just to highlight one thing is that when you're talking about mining
[25:06.670 --> 25:11.910]  rock that's specifically mycorrhizae the saprophytes live off of what we call
[25:11.910 --> 25:16.590]  plant matter so they're they're cycling the nutrients out of the plant matter so
[25:16.590 --> 25:20.470]  think of it this way you grow a plant that plant pulled X amount of nutrients
[25:20.470 --> 25:25.250]  out of that soil if you take that plant away those nutrients are gone if you let
[25:25.250 --> 25:29.210]  the plant fall it just returns all those nutrients back to the soil through the
[25:29.210 --> 25:35.650]  saprophytic fungi so mycorrhizae do mine more more of the hardcore minerals
[25:35.650 --> 25:40.130]  where the saprophytes mine more the plant material but there's a correlation
[25:40.130 --> 25:44.090]  between the two of them they are critical in soil health and this is this
[25:44.090 --> 25:49.970]  goes back to the foundation of KNF or NF is is you know making sure that you have
[25:49.970 --> 25:56.290]  a fungal dominant or high fungal population to help suppress some of
[25:56.290 --> 26:00.290]  these problems in the soil again this is a balance and if you're out of
[26:00.290 --> 26:03.090]  balance then you're yes you're going to need to use these preparations but if
[26:03.090 --> 26:07.210]  you're in balance a lot a lot less is needed like you said it's just touch up
[26:07.210 --> 26:12.250]  it's it's problems that you need you know and not inconsistencies but say say
[26:12.250 --> 26:17.490]  an invasion or pressure from a neighbor's pest is coming to your car
[26:17.490 --> 26:22.170]  your garden that's the way to combat it and and and better yet just to build
[26:22.170 --> 26:26.170]  that soil health your your plants aren't going to smell that they're not going to
[26:26.170 --> 26:32.490]  give off those defenses that or they will have the defenses that let them be
[26:32.490 --> 26:36.530]  invisible to the to the pests around them and again those you know the fungal
[26:36.530 --> 26:42.570]  diseases are not present when you have a high fungal a healthy fungal population
[26:42.570 --> 26:47.010]  soils and again Wendy you know I love I love the way you put shit girl it was
[26:47.010 --> 26:55.810]  beautiful okay can I ask a quick question when you first did tests and
[26:55.810 --> 26:59.370]  got your test results back what were some of the things that jumped out at
[26:59.370 --> 27:04.890]  you and kind of what did you do as a reaction like more of this less of that
[27:04.890 --> 27:15.150]  and we may have an internet can you all hear me yeah I can hear you fine Peter I
[27:15.150 --> 27:27.750]  think she's frozen Wendy can you hear us oh boy she's jammed out hard no that's a
[27:27.750 --> 27:32.390]  great question I think what she's saying about soil testing you there you
[27:32.390 --> 27:42.590]  go a minute there up if you back knowledge II she's back so go for it
[27:42.590 --> 27:50.070]  okay here one sec let me here Layton why don't you put in your two cents and then
[27:50.070 --> 27:58.140]  okay there we go I think that's better Wendy you there all right so the reason
[27:58.140 --> 28:02.900]  you test is because certain cultivars will pull a certain amount of nutrients
[28:02.900 --> 28:09.020]  and if you don't know where your pool is your nutrient pool is then you're kind
[28:09.020 --> 28:13.660]  of guessing you're shooting at the you know the barn blindfold up your back
[28:13.660 --> 28:22.060]  Wendy anyway so the purpose of testing is to find out where your pool is what
[28:22.060 --> 28:26.740]  your deficiencies are so you can properly amend I mean super soils are
[28:26.740 --> 28:33.580]  great tool they just provide all this nutrient up front in the soil and bam
[28:33.580 --> 28:38.140]  you're off to the races but if you don't test it at the end of the cycle or a
[28:38.140 --> 28:41.660]  couple cycles you're probably going to be deficient in certain things and I
[28:41.660 --> 28:47.060]  think that's the reason testing is so important if you're in a perfectly
[28:47.060 --> 28:50.460]  balanced system where you know your soils you're returning a tremendous
[28:50.460 --> 28:55.660]  amount of plant material back to the soils you know mulching adding manures
[28:55.660 --> 29:00.420]  then testing is less of an issue than if you're just continuously running the
[29:00.420 --> 29:04.260]  same material over and over again and not amending anything and again every
[29:04.260 --> 29:07.700]  time you take that plant you're taking a certain amount of that nutrient pool
[29:07.700 --> 29:11.500]  with you and you're not returning it back to the soil so there's there's
[29:11.500 --> 29:16.100]  where testing really becomes very important and I'm sure she would have
[29:16.100 --> 29:23.580]  said similar Wendy are you there she'll be back I was I was about to tell her to
[29:23.580 --> 29:29.100]  drop off and come back on so late well you got you direct all the questions to
[29:29.100 --> 29:33.820]  you while we're waiting for the question real quick Layton sure fire away yeah so
[29:33.820 --> 29:37.780]  what I'm messing around with this stuff I'm letting the the rabbit head the
[29:37.780 --> 29:42.820]  lion head manure start to take hold in the worm bins and I've noticed that the
[29:42.820 --> 29:47.260]  mycelium takes off the fruiting bodies take to start to take hold and then I
[29:47.260 --> 29:50.420]  allow them to fruit kind of die off and it seems like it begins to spread
[29:50.420 --> 29:55.020]  throughout that system do I just continue to allow that to to manifest or
[29:55.020 --> 30:00.940]  should I be taking some of that and inoculating it into other bins that's a
[30:00.940 --> 30:07.500]  great question I mean to understand the population or how how fungal populations
[30:07.500 --> 30:13.100]  work is generally you'll have a yeast plume first if you take an IMO
[30:13.100 --> 30:17.460]  collection you're really getting more yeast than you are sacrifice although
[30:17.460 --> 30:22.340]  you are getting saprophytic spores so the goal is to get that yeast to plume
[30:22.340 --> 30:26.220]  out which is that white fuzzy stuff not mycelium because mycelium is like when
[30:26.220 --> 30:31.260]  you pull back some chips and you see those heavy white threads those look
[30:31.260 --> 30:35.260]  different than the fuzzy stuff and I think what you're referring to Brian is
[30:35.260 --> 30:39.540]  that fuzzy look on the top of the soil and that's basically the first
[30:39.540 --> 30:44.820]  succession of a longer succession a system that allows the saprophytes to
[30:44.820 --> 30:49.140]  really take hold so yeah I mean it's a great inoculant sure take it and and
[30:49.140 --> 30:54.700]  inoculate your other bins but also leave it alone and don't disturb it because
[30:54.700 --> 31:00.420]  what's happening is that that yeast plume is allowing for the next level of
[31:00.420 --> 31:04.740]  saprophytes to take hold and start setting up their chains and then start
[31:04.740 --> 31:08.820]  you know the hyphae and then start fruiting itself and once you go through a
[31:08.820 --> 31:13.940]  complete fruiting cycle now you just have tremendous amount of spores in your
[31:13.940 --> 31:17.980]  soil so then now you once you go through the whole cycle collect that
[31:17.980 --> 31:23.220]  soil and now you have a really high powerful inoculant to transfer into
[31:23.220 --> 31:28.180]  something that is perhaps a soil that's just built or to build soil better like
[31:28.180 --> 31:34.380]  a not liquid imo3 is a great way to take those saprophytes the spores and get
[31:34.380 --> 31:38.860]  them into the soil where you need a bump so I hope that answered the question and
[31:38.860 --> 31:43.180]  I saw back in the chat a little bit someone was talking about using an imo2
[31:43.220 --> 31:48.700]  and putting it right into a compost or a soil system and that that's that's a no
[31:48.700 --> 31:52.940]  no I mean you're wasting a lot of the energy that's in that you want to grow
[31:52.940 --> 31:59.060]  imo2 out into imo3 then you can take an illiquid or transferred into soils to
[31:59.060 --> 32:12.260]  make imo4. Hi Wendy you're back! You back girl? Wendy we can't hear you. Wendy we
[32:12.260 --> 32:24.140]  can't hear you. Can you hear us? Can you send her a message? Yeah hold on.
[32:24.140 --> 32:45.710]  Layton keep going. All right so what else? Oh here you are. Wendy can you hear us?
[32:45.750 --> 32:51.470]  Yeah remember you guys when I was up in Humble cutting in and out? It's beautiful
[32:51.470 --> 32:56.790]  up there but the service is spotty to say the least unfortunately. Wendy can you
[32:56.790 --> 33:07.740]  hear us now? All right so are those fungal body connections? Yeah good times.
[33:07.740 --> 33:15.280]  All right we can hear you now. So one thing you you make maybe cut your video
[33:15.280 --> 33:21.120]  so it's just the audio on the bandwidth. Ah that's a good idea.
[33:21.120 --> 33:30.460]  Yeah oh my gosh yeah no perfect all right and then I will put you up hold on
[33:30.460 --> 33:37.900]  one second so so do you remember the question I asked you before about about
[33:37.900 --> 33:44.460]  testing yeah like once you got your very first test back like what jumped out at
[33:44.500 --> 33:47.740]  you and what'd you do as a result and then what did you notice about because
[33:47.740 --> 33:50.700]  Layton was talking about different cultivars have different nutrient
[33:50.700 --> 33:55.540]  requirements so like this cultivar is depleting a lot more of X this one's
[33:55.540 --> 34:06.600]  depleting a lot more of Y. Yeah so what I found I mean what is it not working okay
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.240]  now it's working it's working like it looks good on my side but okay great um
[34:11.320 --> 34:18.720]  so what I found was that you know growing up without testing and growing
[34:18.720 --> 34:25.040]  up you know growing growing up growing cannabis was very different back in the
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.840]  day people didn't talk about it right it wasn't something that we discussed God
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.960]  forbid you discussed it online or on the phone at that point this was pre internet
[34:34.960 --> 34:40.720]  days right and and so people didn't have these conversations it wasn't any type
[34:40.720 --> 34:46.520]  of thought process of like oh let's all talk about what works best for you know
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.840]  for growing weed and even to the point that we didn't and there was no cultivars
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.560]  people didn't have any idea about strains or strands or whatever you want
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.360]  to call them it was just literally weed and most of it came from bag seed from
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.240]  bricks of marijuana that had been smuggled over the border from Mexico or
[35:07.240 --> 35:14.760]  Panama or you know wherever it might be and so at that point people just they
[35:14.760 --> 35:19.920]  grew weed in the hills and they did their own seed projects and they took
[35:19.920 --> 35:24.440]  those seeds and continued to cultivate out the best you know ones the ones that
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.520]  had the least amount of mildew or mold or whatever it might be the ones that
[35:27.520 --> 35:31.600]  were easiest to grow the ones that yielded the most and so there was a lot
[35:31.600 --> 35:37.760]  of like natural not natural selection but human selection for the terroir that
[35:37.760 --> 35:44.000]  we were in and because of that you know it just became this thing like you know
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  every hole that you made it had a bag of chick manure a bag of steer manure a
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.480]  handful of green sand a handful of oyster shell you know and maybe some
[35:55.480 --> 36:02.440]  like balanced time release 1414 fertilizers something like that but as
[36:02.440 --> 36:08.840]  we have gotten more and more specific with what we want from our plants and as
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.560]  we've gotten you know as the science is starting to come in with understanding
[36:13.560 --> 36:17.800]  the cannabinoids and the terpenes and the interplay of those and everything
[36:17.800 --> 36:21.760]  else that comes with we are finding more and more that things like an OG Kush
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.360]  wants to be fed more and a blue dream doesn't give a shit about anything like
[36:26.360 --> 36:32.800]  just friggin put that in the ground and let it go but but you know the soil test
[36:32.800 --> 36:39.000]  still seemed like for the most part you can really get away with doing just a
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.480]  standard thing for all the plants and as you get further and further into
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.320]  cultivating and you know years and years go by what you'll start to realize is
[36:49.320 --> 36:53.120]  that these certain ones do want more of this and this certain one wants more of
[36:53.120 --> 37:00.400]  that but what I found is that because the industry in the market and the
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.400]  consumers are changing so rapidly in what they want we're constantly changing
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.080]  what we're growing so when I grew ice cream cake last year I probably won't
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.040]  grow that again this year there are certain things like you know I love that
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.080]  actually the industry and consumers are starting to come back around to being
[37:20.080 --> 37:26.280]  interested in legacy cultivars and in things that have been growing you know
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.480]  in Humboldt County since the 80s like there was a period of time where nobody
[37:29.480 --> 37:32.000]  wanted it you couldn't sell it because people are like well we don't know what
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.200]  that is that's not OG that's not sour diesel like we don't understand we want
[37:37.200 --> 37:47.110]  to know it looks like something that everybody wants so you're you know
[37:47.110 --> 37:56.660]  damn humble she was good she was going strong Layton yes sir what are your
[37:56.660 --> 37:59.500]  thoughts and what she was just talking about while we wait for her to come back
[37:59.500 --> 38:03.940]  that was the color commentary on well yeah you know that's been a that's been
[38:03.940 --> 38:10.100]  a big conversation over the last three or four years is you know where is the
[38:10.100 --> 38:15.900]  market going where's the direction and you know I've loved Kevin Jodry for his
[38:15.900 --> 38:21.740]  mindset on this and and his ability to see the future for lack of better words
[38:21.740 --> 38:27.420]  and he's been a big fan of like saying hey you know let's dial in what works
[38:27.420 --> 38:32.660]  well in our area and focus on that and not try to compete with everybody and I
[38:32.660 --> 38:36.540]  think you know that's kind of where she was going is that you know yeah this is
[38:36.540 --> 38:42.020]  a hot plant this year but you know I I'm not a big fan of it or I don't want to
[38:42.020 --> 38:46.940]  be stuck with a designer plant that is no longer in fashion next year so let's
[38:46.940 --> 38:50.860]  get back to the basics the ones that we know really work well that the band is
[38:50.860 --> 38:55.900]  out there and we can polish it and push the push the genetics or the epigenetic
[38:55.900 --> 39:02.180]  wall to make that plant more powerful have a better expression I mean the
[39:02.180 --> 39:06.540]  craziest thing about this is even when you have a stable genetic you still have
[39:06.540 --> 39:11.620]  outliers and those outliers have different expressions or strengths and
[39:11.620 --> 39:17.500]  weaknesses within within that say chemo var and so I think that's where you
[39:17.500 --> 39:21.980]  know the future of cannabis really is is saying okay we we got this stable
[39:21.980 --> 39:27.300]  genetic it's an f6 but let's let's do a terpene search let's do a you know let's
[39:27.300 --> 39:32.340]  do a hunt and see what other expressions can come out of it we know that that
[39:32.340 --> 39:36.700]  cultivar has been grown out for a number of years in this environment in this
[39:36.700 --> 39:41.180]  Appalachia or Terroir whatever you want to call it and so we know it it does
[39:41.180 --> 39:44.980]  well here but let's let's see if we can find something that does a little bit
[39:44.980 --> 39:49.300]  better or yields a little higher or pushes you know pushes a higher level of
[39:49.300 --> 39:55.660]  cannabinol or a terpene an expression so I mean that I think is really the future
[39:55.660 --> 40:01.420]  of cannabis is to say okay this cultivar works well in my area so I'm gonna focus
[40:01.420 --> 40:05.900]  on this because let's face it you don't want to fight this stuff you don't want
[40:05.900 --> 40:14.420]  you don't want to grow a PM typical plant in a or a plant that has a problem
[40:14.420 --> 40:19.060]  with powdery mildew in an area where you have fog you're just asking for problems
[40:19.060 --> 40:23.540]  so if you're in a you know low-lying area of humble where you're gonna get
[40:23.540 --> 40:28.540]  fog you want to grow a cultivar that was tolerant to that fog so I think that's
[40:28.540 --> 40:33.980]  kind of where the direction of her comments were going but unfortunately
[40:33.980 --> 40:39.660]  when are you out there she's back well I was putting words in your mouth
[40:39.660 --> 40:51.780]  girlfriend what's interesting were you were you growing ice cream cake because
[40:51.780 --> 41:02.600]  that's kind of what what the market wanted yeah every year will we will
[41:02.600 --> 41:08.320]  grow something that is you know one of the key strains that people and ice
[41:08.320 --> 41:14.720]  cream cake is a good one it's it's not for me like we run our light deprivation
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.120]  because as honestly we get the price points for it it's a bill it's fun it's
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.640]  it's fun to have a harvest in the middle of the season rather than having to wait
[41:23.640 --> 41:31.760]  all year but truthfully for me I love growing from seed I love growing full
[41:31.760 --> 41:39.000]  term plants I absolutely adore more than anything
[41:39.440 --> 41:44.840]  stuff seed taking it through to its full natural expression at the end of the sin
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.240]  harvesting it when it's perfect Lee right and know that to me and and and
[41:50.240 --> 41:56.800]  especially with the seeds because you'll have some you know typically one has a
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.440]  different smell and this one has a try those and oh my god number 27 was the
[42:02.440 --> 42:13.520]  bomb that to me is what I love to do I I mine in its own space doing its own
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.280]  thing and and it's to me like a lot of the things that people are chasing
[42:19.280 --> 42:23.360]  nowadays with the cultivars they're like oh you know like ice cream cake was huge
[42:23.360 --> 42:33.480]  last year you know for you know it's a huge cultivar there's all these things
[42:33.480 --> 42:40.000]  that somehow garner some type of interest and that is what the market
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.760]  wants so you know being a proper business person you're gonna do what the
[42:48.760 --> 42:52.680]  market wants you to do at least to some extent so that's a lot of times why we
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.840]  grow whatever is the hip new hot popular thing it's nice once again like coming
[42:57.840 --> 43:01.760]  back around to to what I was saying is that it's really nice that there is more
[43:01.760 --> 43:08.880]  interest now in the cultivars that are grown in the regions that they have been
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.480]  and grown in for decades for exactly those reasons that Layton was talking
[43:13.480 --> 43:18.000]  about was that why would I grow something so like we grew them we tried
[43:18.000 --> 43:24.040]  out some oh gosh what was it it was the H o G of the deadhead og there absolutely
[43:24.040 --> 43:30.840]  sorry for me what was it I don't really deal with a lot of mold anymore I don't
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.960]  really deal with powdery mildew that in particular from seed man go tomorrow we
[43:35.960 --> 43:46.960]  had to cut it so Wendy jet there we go I can never tell if it's my internet
[43:47.080 --> 43:50.440]  connection and I'm the only one not hearing someone or if nobody can hear
[43:50.440 --> 43:57.480]  that person so I give them like an extra little bit no it's it's her it's humble
[43:57.480 --> 44:06.760]  yeah so I I tried to I'm gonna text her to reset her modem so late and there
[44:06.760 --> 44:12.560]  were some questions earlier that maybe you can tackle and when she comes back
[44:12.560 --> 44:18.800]  so cam Taylor wanted to know thoughts on soaking cocoa fiber in an FPGA
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.760]  solution to get the desired mineral and pH content that most would use Cal Mag
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.800]  to soak with experimenting with soil bases so what are your thoughts on
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.760]  soaking cocoa fiber in an FPGA solution all right so cocoa fiber generally isn't
[44:34.760 --> 44:41.800]  like Pete Pete Pete has a very low or acid low pH acid so it has its own
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.000]  issues that you've got to stabilize it to get it up if you're using a decent
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.120]  core product and you know I've talked about this recently on the conference
[44:51.120 --> 44:57.160]  we put on is most core comes from the Far East and most cores grown or cocoa
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.680]  coconut trees are grown in brackish water so there's a lot of saline
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.600]  involved in it as well as it's mishandled so it's you know run it run
[45:06.600 --> 45:12.320]  over by giant pieces of equipment it's pressed under tremendous pressure to bag
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.760]  it to make it as small as possible because it's being shipped across the
[45:15.760 --> 45:21.520]  ocean so I don't like using any of those cores from overseas there's a there's a
[45:21.520 --> 45:29.280]  company here and in Southern California the harvest the coconut husks from
[45:29.280 --> 45:35.560]  Mexico and it's grown in freshwater they do not over pressurize the materials so
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.160]  that it works a lot better as far as water holding capacity and again it
[45:40.160 --> 45:47.960]  does not have as much of a pH issue so would I soak my my core in something to
[45:47.960 --> 45:53.680]  to charge it sure why not I mean that's that's a way of building a nutrient pool
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.360]  because let's face it core core is high in potassium but it's not high in any of
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.880]  the other micro macro nutrients so it's important to you know get it off to the
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.680]  right foot so to say soaking it in cow mag you know that now you're fucking
[46:07.680 --> 46:11.880]  around with with your saturated paste there's a ratio between calcium
[46:11.880 --> 46:16.600]  magnesium and potassium which is really important especially starting out so you
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.600]  should be about taking a hundred a hundred percent seventy-five percent
[46:20.600 --> 46:24.960]  should be calcium eighteen percent should be magnesium and about seven
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.600]  percent should be your potassium and if you start with that level you're off to
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.920]  the races so the problem with cow mag is it doesn't have potassium and both
[46:33.920 --> 46:37.680]  calcium and magnesium are double positive so they're gonna use up all the
[46:37.680 --> 46:41.720]  exchange sites and unless you have like like Wendy talked about a water
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.280]  soluble potassium to add to that matrix you're gonna be short on your potassium
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.640]  and this goes back to again why should I test if you're especially if you're
[46:51.640 --> 46:55.840]  building soil you want to know where you're starting that's really important
[46:55.840 --> 47:04.280]  otherwise you're just throwing you're shooting blindly at the barn again got
[47:04.280 --> 47:16.080]  anything else Peter you're muted Peter I was multitasking I see you bag it sees
[47:16.080 --> 47:26.560]  like a madman over there I did a bong rip at 4 a.m. and got to work
[47:26.560 --> 47:37.480]  my two-year-old out of the crib at 7 and came back down so MC mycelium asked
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.160]  and these are from a while ago I'm curious if you can add IMO to the soil
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.400]  for grow bags 1 to 10 ratios yeah I hit on that one earlier that was the one I
[47:46.400 --> 47:52.680]  told him no don't waste your IMO to on soil you want to grow that out into an
[47:52.680 --> 47:58.200]  IMO three you're gonna have a hundred fold the yield if you're if you do it
[47:58.200 --> 48:02.840]  properly then just taking that IMO collection and tossing it into soil
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.680]  you're wasting it so again I was talking to Brian about getting letting the yeast
[48:07.680 --> 48:11.440]  grow out letting the saprophytes go through their cycle letting them
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.840]  sporulate and now you have something of real value and that's exactly what
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.440]  happens between IMO 2 and IMO 3 is that you're growing it out you're getting
[48:20.440 --> 48:25.800]  that saprophytes to take over colonize and begin to sporulate so that you can
[48:25.800 --> 48:31.600]  have a really powerful inoculant if you jump that step you pretty much wasted
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.280]  your work and collecting your IMO in the first place sorry to be harsh and there
[48:37.280 --> 48:41.720]  was a man made a comment a little bit ago how he was saying how I feel like a
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.600]  lot of people are talking about lab and then they never get around to actually
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.320]  doing it and hats off to him because I feel that isn't the same way there's a
[48:49.320 --> 48:52.160]  lot of people out there they're talking about this stuff at the same time
[48:52.160 --> 48:55.520]  they've never even done it they've never been put together and so that's one of
[48:55.520 --> 49:00.160]  the reasons why I love having Layton and Wendy on today is because we're you know
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.120]  all of us working together is to get past some of that stuff so that we can
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.360]  get like like Wendy was mentioning before some of those FPJs and stuff when
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.920]  you first start out there's a lot of mistakes that are made unless you really
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.440]  know the full blueprint wait is this the comment you were talking about yes yes
[49:18.760 --> 49:22.640]  hats off to you Ian because I don't hear a lot of people say that but that in my
[49:22.640 --> 49:26.400]  opinion that really is true with some of the cannabis community they're all about
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.440]  talking about it on Instagram and promoting things but are they actually
[49:29.440 --> 49:33.120]  doing the work on the back end learning about those things and I hope that they
[49:33.120 --> 49:36.320]  are but it seems like a lot of a lot of the rhetoric out there is just to talk
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.880]  about lab but there's a lot of other things especially with the IMOs and
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.640]  that was something I was hoping Wendy we could talk about is when you started to
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.920]  get more successful with going out and maybe collecting your IMOs and stuff
[49:48.920 --> 49:53.480]  like that because I personally have shared this with Layton many times I've
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.200]  probably hitting maybe two or three out of ten with any kind of success rate
[49:58.200 --> 50:01.840]  when I'm taking the time to go out and put all the boxes out and just seemed
[50:01.840 --> 50:07.080]  like I just wasn't understanding the concepts fully so if there's any way or
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.080]  any tips you could you could give the community we would all really appreciate
[50:11.080 --> 50:20.320]  that Wendy man I gotta get I gotta get her an Ethernet cable if she could plug
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.400]  her computer into her I think she just has a little delay so Wendy if you can
[50:26.400 --> 50:32.360]  hear this just start talking yeah for sure and I can you hear me
[50:32.360 --> 50:48.080]  yes yes excellent man yeah I can totally hear you guys and okay I
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.480]  understand Ethernet cable I'm not technology so I this is why I work with
[50:53.480 --> 51:01.200]  plants because I will write down that I need an Ethernet cable I'll put that on
[51:01.200 --> 51:05.200]  my list yeah just make sure your computer can accept it I'm hoping you
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.360]  guys can hear me I'm just gonna start babbling and we'll see if it works
[51:09.360 --> 51:20.600]  maybe I will take off actually what's the internet is yeah right okay anyway
[51:20.600 --> 51:26.720]  I'm just gonna start talking I hope you guys hear me so well it's a phone I'm on
[51:26.720 --> 51:29.240]  a phone I'm not even on the damn computer maybe I should get the computer
[51:29.240 --> 51:36.000]  out it's actually not a terrible idea maybe I will do that um so I'm gonna
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.040]  hope you guys hear me and talk about IMO because IMO is like I was saying
[51:42.040 --> 51:48.720]  the biggest part of this whole thing and it is the thing I tried probably about a
[51:48.720 --> 51:57.160]  dozen times on my own before taking a class and just I mean I had failure
[51:57.160 --> 52:01.600]  after failure after failure and once I took the class and found out that there
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.720]  are all of these really subtle nuances that absolutely contribute to the
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.320]  success of indigenous microorganism collections and we see people doing
[52:11.320 --> 52:16.640]  things crazy things all the time people are like oh look I made IMO out of my
[52:16.640 --> 52:22.160]  compost bin and I'm like that is not IMO you're actually missing the first part
[52:22.160 --> 52:26.920]  of that which is indigenous microorganism right so indigenous not
[52:26.920 --> 52:32.240]  being like indigenous in your compost pile but being indigenous in the nature
[52:32.240 --> 52:37.320]  where you are like you know in the world what is out there in the forest what is
[52:37.320 --> 52:42.520]  out there in the field what is near you that has been living there and has
[52:42.520 --> 52:47.640]  inoculated that area after decades or not even decades but hundreds and
[52:47.640 --> 52:52.200]  hundreds of years that is what we're trying to do what we're trying to do is
[52:52.200 --> 52:58.560]  take those really delicate organisms that have this extreme diversity and
[52:58.560 --> 53:09.440]  this very large amount of okay so extreme diversity and has been kind of
[53:09.440 --> 53:12.800]  like when we talking about weed and we're talking about the cultivars that
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.280]  have grown really well in these areas and we talk about these legacy strains
[53:16.280 --> 53:21.800]  that have been cultivated and bred out to be really really good in that area
[53:21.800 --> 53:27.880]  that's what nature is doing too right so the fungi the mycelium the bacteria
[53:27.880 --> 53:34.440]  the yeast all of those microbes that have been living in nature have actually
[53:34.440 --> 53:39.360]  they found a balance where they're really happy in that spot so we want to
[53:39.360 --> 53:44.440]  bring that into our garden area we want to be working with the native soil
[53:44.440 --> 53:47.760]  that's in our spot we don't want it I mean I see so many people too that are
[53:47.760 --> 53:53.840]  like in those damn smart pots y'all dump the smart pots it's not smart you
[53:53.840 --> 53:59.360]  have dirt you have soil I don't care where you are in the world underneath
[53:59.360 --> 54:05.200]  your smart pot if you did not pour cement you have soil and you can amend
[54:05.200 --> 54:13.320]  that soil to be amazing and that will be easier I guarantee it will be easier
[54:13.320 --> 54:17.120]  than putting out fields of smart pots all right sorry I'll get off my smart
[54:17.160 --> 54:25.000]  pot thing so for indigenous microorganisms you want to go out into
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.520]  nature you want to go sometimes you might have to drive if you live in
[54:28.520 --> 54:34.240]  inner-city Denver you may not be able to just walk out into your backyard the way
[54:34.240 --> 54:39.000]  that I can that doesn't mean you can't do this the grow that I advise in
[54:39.000 --> 54:44.400]  Colorado they routinely go up into the mountains and place boxes and so they
[54:44.400 --> 54:49.560]  have this I mean they have this amazing wall if you go to my Instagram or go to
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.640]  Instagram and look up BFF natural I think is what they are now bring her
[54:54.640 --> 54:59.600]  off family farms they I believe they should have some posts up with this wall
[54:59.600 --> 55:06.720]  of KNF inputs that's just mind-blowing it's beautiful and they have a whole
[55:06.720 --> 55:13.880]  area for IMO so they have IMO to after IMO to after IMO to it's absolutely
[55:13.880 --> 55:19.400]  amazing and they're doing it so properly that they're getting above
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.000]  market value for their cannabis they're crushing it out there it's amazing and
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.360]  most of that has to do with the fact that their soil is ripping I mean it's
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.760]  amazing and even though like they had some problems learning you know they're
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.920]  new to farming they don't do this routinely they're from a totally
[55:37.920 --> 55:41.960]  different industry and so they were over watering so they with there was some
[55:41.960 --> 55:46.000]  problems with that but that's been corrected and on the second cycle now I
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.440]  mean it's it's incredible and and so for them again they don't they live in an
[55:52.440 --> 55:56.640]  urban area or suburban area they can't just walk out of their door and put IMO
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.040]  boxes so they go for hikes they take family trips up into the mountains so
[56:01.040 --> 56:03.840]  this is all something that you know I have people that are like well you know
[56:03.840 --> 56:08.440]  I live in this area I can't do that I'm like you can you absolutely can it's how
[56:08.440 --> 56:16.920]  bad do you want to so get out into nature place IMO boxes and then then
[56:16.920 --> 56:24.320]  then it becomes a game of feeling it out and and I wish that it was simpler to
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.480]  say you know I wish I could say like okay after exactly seventy six point
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.520]  nine hours you pick your box up but it's not it's gonna be dependent on weather
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.560]  it's gonna be dependent on humidity it's gonna be dependent upon where you
[56:37.560 --> 56:44.080]  placed your box so the biggest tip that I can give people is make a lot of boxes
[56:44.080 --> 56:51.120]  so don't build one box build ten and put out four in one spot so when you find an
[56:51.120 --> 56:56.840]  area that has a bunch of mycelium and it's amazing and it looks great don't
[56:56.840 --> 57:01.480]  just set one box there put four boxes out and then pick one up at day four
[57:01.480 --> 57:05.440]  pick one up at day five pick one up at day six pick one up at day seven or day
[57:05.440 --> 57:12.120]  three four whatever you want to do once you open your box up the jig is up you
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.160]  cannot put the genie back in the bottle the box is done it does not matter
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.400]  whether it's actually inoculated properly or not you're done you've opened
[57:20.400 --> 57:26.120]  it you've taken off the lid you've you know that's it so if you have a lot of
[57:26.120 --> 57:31.480]  boxes you can start collecting data and you can say on June 15th my temperature
[57:31.480 --> 57:37.800]  and humidity averages were this across this period of time and it was five days
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.040]  until my box was ready so now I know that every time I have a temperature and
[57:42.040 --> 57:47.240]  humidity that's in that range I'm gonna leave my box out for five days and when
[57:47.240 --> 57:51.960]  a temperature and humidity is you know different then I'll know okay this was
[57:51.960 --> 57:56.680]  three days when it's like this and it's seven days when it's like this and then
[57:56.680 --> 58:02.880]  after and this is a long game you guys like this is not something that is you
[58:02.880 --> 58:09.560]  know it's not a super fast process if this isn't like you go by advanced
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.840]  nutrients a jug of pink a jug of green and a jug of blue and you add it this
[58:13.840 --> 58:20.040]  part this part that part this is really about learning how to cultivate
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.360]  regeneratively you know not sustainably we're not sustainable anymore like our
[58:25.360 --> 58:29.960]  planet has crested that I was talking about this last night it we're not in a
[58:29.960 --> 58:35.200]  sustainable world anymore we have to get regenerative so we can be sustainable so
[58:35.200 --> 58:42.360]  this isn't something that you know is a quick fix this is a long-term solution
[58:42.360 --> 58:48.280]  to global planetary problems and if you want to be a part of the solution if you
[58:48.280 --> 58:51.920]  have children if you know people that have children if you want children to be
[58:51.920 --> 58:58.280]  able to go out into the world when they are our age you have to start cultivating
[58:58.280 --> 59:01.720]  differently and that means you're ditching those jugs you're ditching the
[59:01.720 --> 59:05.920]  smart pots you're ditching cement and you're getting back to doing things
[59:05.920 --> 59:11.400]  naturally and again I don't care where you live you can do this but but you
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.840]  need to start now because again this is something that you know I've been doing
[59:15.840 --> 59:20.320]  this for years now and finally feel like I'm at a point where I am highly
[59:20.320 --> 59:26.480]  successful at it but it is it does take time to get there so get your boxes out
[59:26.480 --> 59:32.720]  start collecting IMO start collecting getting your IMO collections up to snuff
[59:32.720 --> 59:38.120]  so that next year you can make rocking IMO three piles and the year after that
[59:38.120 --> 59:41.480]  they're even better and the year after that they're even better and then you're
[59:41.480 --> 59:46.520]  getting into IMO 4 which is where you're inoculating soil and then really where
[59:46.520 --> 59:51.120]  people are skipping out is doing IMO 5 so you're getting your nitrogen back
[59:51.120 --> 59:57.520]  into your soil but it's already acclimated to your soil it's acclimated
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.840]  to your fungal bodies it's acclimated to all of that so everything is more
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.800]  available to your plants it's just it's a cool system it's like I geek out on it
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:14.160]  because it's super super super rad to see the success that happens but again
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.640]  it's not something that happens overnight it does take time so don't get
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.480]  frustrated don't give up just you just keep after it and I mean if I'd given up
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.120]  I never would have gone down this path because I mean I was trying to say this
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:34.080]  one I think my internet was glitching was that it took me I think I had 10 IMO
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.200]  collections that I dumped in the compost before I took class because I didn't
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.360]  know what I was doing wrong but I knew they weren't right and it really comes
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.800]  down into cooking your rice the right way cal rose rice or a short grain white
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.520]  rice or brown rice also seems to be working pretty well for me but
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:01:01.200]  traditionally you use a short grain white rice and that is very very there's
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.120]  there's a protein fat ratio apparently that is just perfect for those fungal
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.240]  bodies that we're trying to inoculate into that rice so doing that more boxes
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.240]  more boxes more box I build boxes every year I should give a lot of them away
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.560]  which is part of why I have to rebuild them but when I build a box I don't
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:26.360]  build one I build like six or ten and that way you know I mean for me I don't
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.040]  I don't necessarily do this as much anymore but when I was getting going it
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.440]  really was key to have extra boxes out there so I could figure out what worked
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.920]  and I could sit there and look at things and be like okay this worked really well
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.000]  at this time of year so now I know for next year I don't have to put six boxes
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.160]  out I can put a couple out and maybe give each one a 12-hour difference and I
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.040]  know that I'm gonna have a collection that is really good and like Leighton
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.440]  was saying that IMO 2 you don't need to have a ton of it because ideally you're
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.920]  propagating that out into IMO 3 4 & 5 and that's increasing the number of
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.880]  spores from a handful to you know a 200 pound pile which is huge and because IMO
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:20.040]  is hard to do it's it is by far the most difficult one to to get around and it's
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.240]  the most important one so you know we see a lot of people making FPJ and OHN
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.200]  and all this stuff and that's all great and wonderful and you should do that too
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.960]  but really like IMO is what it's all about.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.720]  Hey Wendy can I can I ask you about the elevation I think we should cover that
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:43.720]  as well about not exceeding a thousand feet plus elevation and not going below
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:54.950]  you can you speak on that a little bit? Yeah so traditionally we're taught that
[01:02:54.950 --> 01:03:01.870]  the ideal location is about within 500 feet of elevation of your farm and in a
[01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:07.390]  area that is similar so I mean this is something else I see people doing is
[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:15.190]  they're like oh I made IMO in Hawaii and I brought it back. Okay I mean I I don't
[01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:21.070]  know that there's necessarily anything wrong with that other than you're not in
[01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:27.550]  Hawaii. So you know I mean if you're indoor it's kind of different so if you
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:33.310]  have a cultivation or if you're in smart pots or on cement and I know that there
[01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:38.670]  are states that are requiring really weird things like that like you have to
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.390]  be inside like that to me is just inane but we won't get into politics so I
[01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:49.270]  won't even talk to that but if you are inside and you are using a potting soil
[01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:54.510]  you know you you want to add some actual rocks and things in there which
[01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.910]  people are like why would you do that? I'm like well because that's what you
[01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:00.870]  need in order to get those minerals I mean you can also just amend every time
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.190]  with you know oyster shell and other things like that so I suppose that's an
[01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:12.350]  option as well but sorry so getting back to the elevation thing so ideally within
[01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:22.270]  500 feet and ideally not lower and really that just has to do with well
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:27.070]  there's so many again there's so many like little nuances but when you're
[01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:32.990]  thinking about how biology moves right like things are moving down they're not
[01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:38.830]  necessarily moving up so if you're bringing something from up above down
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:50.180]  you're kind of just creating a faster process of what nature would do anyway
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:56.900]  Layton? Yeah and actually so just quickly Wendy's gonna hear me in about 10
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:03.060]  seconds Wendy why don't you try to fire up your computer while Layton fills two
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.900]  minutes yeah we can hear you but it's okay you're gonna hear me in a couple of
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:18.020]  seconds try try your computer and jump on on your computer and Layton so what
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:23.860]  what Wendy was referring to was a project that she Chris Trump and I
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:29.740]  worked on together in Colorado the BFF farm we did a horizontal soil system
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:34.420]  there so basically we had an a horizon and O horizon and an E horizon actually
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:41.900]  EEO and bottom line was that that provided the necessary substructure to
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:49.020]  actually launch into very biologically diverse system so I contributed the the
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:56.020]  soil blend and the oil system ratios an AMO which is an aquatic microorganism
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:02.500]  Chris did a IMO or the family did the collections and then Chris took their
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:07.460]  IMO twos made IMO three four and I think they did a five but I'm not
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:12.780]  positive maybe Wendy can speak on that and introduced them into the soil system
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:19.820]  so Chris did an IMO three application on the E horizon an AMO and an AMO and an
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:27.140]  IMO three installation on the a horizon and then again on the O horizon which is
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.620]  the top the potting soil and as he said it after about five weeks or six weeks
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:37.220]  when he went back there he'd never seen anything like it so this combination of
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.580]  all of these organisms in a construct that is really suitable for biological
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.100]  life is the key to the whole thing so yeah you can sure you can use a super
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.620]  soil that works great but remember your my car eyes you aren't gonna colonize
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.540]  that and some of these other delicate IMO organisms are not gonna know how to
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.700]  on core or peat moss they need it they need an abundance of other things that
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.420]  are true you know typically in their soil system so to limit the clay to
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.300]  limit the silt to limit the sand in your soil system is is irresponsible to
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.620]  expect these IMOs to to actually colonize and take off because you didn't
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:16.300]  give them any food you didn't give them the the raw minerals that they need to
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:21.660]  do their work and to function in their system so you know again IMO collections
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.860]  are fantastic they're important but if you're throwing them in a potting soil
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.340]  you know you're kind of defeating the purpose of doing all that work and I
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.180]  loved what she said about the multi collection boxes I think that's really
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:39.260]  good advice and also keep in mind that there are ways to look at the collection
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:46.100]  box without opening it so in IMO collection IMO one you basically put
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:51.100]  your cedar box just underneath the leaf tuff all right so you just kind of dig
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.100]  in a scratch and out a little hole about the same depth as the box itself
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.660]  and then you're kind of gently spreading and covering it back up so after about
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:03.820]  four you know I did one collection this spring my first one ever and I was
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:08.660]  actually very successful because I do have experience in looking at soil
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.540]  systems and forests in a completely different manner that most people don't
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:15.780]  so I picked I targeted things that I knew we're gonna have really good
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.980]  diversity and the in the microorganisms and what I did was I went back after day
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.620]  five and I just kind of scratched back the edge of the box on one side and I
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:32.620]  looked for some mycelium I looked for some fuzz I saw I saw a little mycelium
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:36.100]  I saw a little fuzz but instead of instead of collecting it because I knew
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.900]  once I opened it I'm screwed I covered it back up and waited and came back
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.860]  another day and the next day it was better and then I came back the next day
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:48.780]  and it was better so I realized that by just observing it and paying attention
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:54.020]  to it I didn't have to harvest it right away and that's why when I went back on
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.180]  this day seven I noticed it wasn't any better than day six so I collected it
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.420]  brought it back stabilized it and sugar immediately that's something else that
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.260]  she didn't talk about is as soon as you open that box you got a 9-1-1 at home
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:11.820]  get it right into the jar or get it right into a mixing bowl mix it in with
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:15.580]  the sugars and then put it on the shelf because if you do not stabilize it
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:21.660]  immediately you're starting to lose that the diversity of those organisms
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.340]  they're off they're fragile they're sensitive they don't want to be out of
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.620]  the soil they they live in a soil environment it's kind of like sticking
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:31.940]  you underwater for 12 expecting you to survive you're not good it's not going
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.860]  to work so it's really about getting those organisms out of the ground as
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.660]  fast as possible once you know the collection is good and back into the
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.540]  sugar and the mixing bowl and the sugar and then into the jar so that they're
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:49.220]  safely they're safely hybrid hibernated or how do we say this putting putting
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:54.700]  cryogenics the sugar basically shuts the metabolism of all of the organisms down
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.940]  so they go into what's called a cyst form and then basically they are viable
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.980]  for years to come and again you know one collection could last you for years
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:10.020]  probably ten years because you're only using a little pinch of this when you're
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:14.380]  mixing it into IMO 3 and and another thing she didn't hit on is that you
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.380]  should do multi-season collections so a collection in spring collection summer
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.540]  collection of fall collection winter now that's not possible in all areas you
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.060]  can't go up into the Colorado Mountains in the middle of winter and try to get
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.820]  to down to the bottom the florist layer and if you did you wouldn't know where
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.940]  you were collecting anyway because you really got to see it but in warmer
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.820]  temperate areas you really should be doing a winter collection as well and
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.860]  those are important because remember when you're making an IMO 3 to have a
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:46.820]  pinch of spring a pinch of summer and a pinch of fall now you're really getting
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:50.860]  a great expression of what would be there present yearly and once you
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.500]  introduce them to your soil system you let them go and now you know that in
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.940]  spring this one's going to be present in summer that one's going to cyst up but
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:03.780]  it'll be there next spring when it needs to be so that's the importance or some
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:08.020]  of the intricacies that she's talking about is understanding like
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.660]  don't screw with elevation you know if you're if you're on a south side of a
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:15.260]  mountain don't do an IMO collection on the north side it's gonna be different
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:20.220]  so common sense is really important when you're doing this and then and then you
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.300]  know obviously common sense in how you apply these things and if you're
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:29.420]  liquefying them again you don't want to be liquefying an IMO 2 you're wasting
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:34.620]  that precious collection you need to put it into an IMO 3 let it grow out and
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:39.140]  then make a liquid IMO so a couple little intricacies on on some of those
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:46.060]  that I thought should get cleared up is Wendy back with us Peter she is Wendy
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:12:06.120]  can you hear us oh man all right we're gonna have her back on I am back I'm on
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:12.640]  my computer hopefully this is better although now you guys are frozen can you
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:23.000]  hear us it's okay we can hear you okay great I apologize for everybody it's a
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.400]  yeah Ethernet cable huh all right Ethernet cable I have are literally
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:37.710]  going to buy one as soon as I get done with this indirectly I can hear you guys
[01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:43.830]  all right cool I am not sure that you can hear me though we can hear you we
[01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:49.070]  can hear you okay great perfect all right so yeah what what Layton was
[01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:53.470]  saying absolutely I was listening to that and your different collections and
[01:12:53.470 --> 01:13:00.750]  different seasons is really really key as well so there is a huge a huge part
[01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.850]  of that is exactly what we're saying so what you're doing you know that the
[01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:10.970]  theory behind this the mindset that you need to have is that you're taking your
[01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:14.970]  garden soil the place that you are growing your cash crops and it doesn't
[01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.130]  matter whether we're talking I mean obviously we're talking about cannabis
[01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:22.810]  in this case but this is equally applicable to growing something like
[01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:30.890]  dragon fruit or wheat or corn or tomatoes or apples it does not matter
[01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:37.650]  what you're growing the ideology is the same which is that you want to take your
[01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:44.370]  soil that you're cultivating in and turn that into a fungally dominant soil there
[01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:50.210]  is one exception to that and that is brassicas your brassica family so
[01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:57.610]  cauliflower broccoli kale and you know brassicas is what they're called Google
[01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:59.610]  it if you don't know what it is and see if you're growing that and if that's
[01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:03.610]  what you're growing you can have a bacterially dominant soil or a more
[01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:07.850]  balanced soil even something like lettuce does really well in a one-to-one
[01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:13.130]  ratio as opposed to a fungally dominant but for the most part the crops that we
[01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:20.410]  grow want to be grown in a soil that has more fungi than bacteria so when we are
[01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:28.050]  trying to do that what we want is that soil that has that fungal biology active
[01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:33.450]  and thriving at any given point in the year so if all you have is a winter
[01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:38.730]  collection when it gets hot those fungi are not going to be happy and they're
[01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:42.170]  gonna go dormant or there's a high likelihood that they're gonna go dormant
[01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:47.170]  and then you don't have a fungal diversity that is active and alive and
[01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:50.770]  working with your plants so if you collect from different times of the year
[01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:55.410]  and from different locations what you're doing is you're having this incredible
[01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:59.810]  diversity of fungi that you're inoculating into your soil that you're
[01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:03.930]  growing your plants in and it doesn't matter you've got something that likes
[01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:07.330]  it hot and dry you've got something that likes it hot and wet you've got
[01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.530]  something that likes cold and wet you've got something that likes cold and dry
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:14.650]  you've got something that likes temperate and hot and temperate and wet
[01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:21.370]  and temperate and dry and basically you now have some type of fungi or more than
[01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:28.970]  one that is really happy and thriving no matter what the weather is doing. And that's something
[01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:35.370]  that we see people missing quite a lot. They go, I collected this from my compost pile.
[01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:42.490]  Well, we already talked about why that's not a good idea, but even then, you know, it's one
[01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:49.290]  collection. And that one collection is going to lack the diversity of the fungi that likes it
[01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:55.050]  during different temperatures and different humidities. So as your IMO2 collection starts
[01:15:55.050 --> 01:16:01.850]  to grow, when you're getting to IMO3, you're adding all of your IMO2 collections, not just one.
[01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:09.530]  And again, that gets back to that whole key of diversity of fungal bodies in your soil.
[01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:14.250]  So it doesn't matter whether it's hot and dry or something that likes it,
[01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:20.250]  cold and wet, something that likes it. And they're all present in your IMO3. And then you're
[01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:25.930]  inoculating your soil. So now when you add it to your soil, it's kind of like transplanting a plant,
[01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:30.330]  right? You go through, there's transplant shock because it's coming out of a pot and into a new
[01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:38.090]  environment. So if you have those fungal bodies already inoculated with your soil in smaller
[01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:44.490]  amounts, you can spread it out and use less of it over a larger amount. And it's going to thrive
[01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:53.050]  because it's already acclimated to that soil. So that's why IMO4 becomes really important is,
[01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:58.890]  again, we're not, we're taking our IMO2. IMO1, that was hard enough. We've got IMO2.
[01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:04.410]  We've got limited amounts. We want to make that bigger. Now you've got IMO3. You want to make
[01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:10.330]  that bigger and get it into your soil. So now you've got, again, you took a handful of IMO2
[01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:18.650]  and you have now inoculated acres of farmland. Like not kidding. Literally that is how this works.
[01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:24.490]  So you've taken something that has a high learning curve. It was difficult. You're finally nailing it.
[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:32.490]  And now you actually are turning your entire area from a small amount into something that is really
[01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:42.730]  big and amazing. And now again, it doesn't matter what the environment is doing or what your weather
[01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:49.690]  is doing. You'll have something that is working really well in your soil during that timeframe.
[01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:55.610]  So that's why those different seasons are so important. I tend to avoid winter personally,
[01:17:56.170 --> 01:18:04.010]  just because for us, there's more chances of anaerobic activity going on. You've got a higher
[01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:09.690]  chance of getting bacteria. And for me, it's just, it's tends to be wet and rainy in Humboldt County
[01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:15.290]  in the winter. So if you're in an area that's wet and rainy, or like Leighton was saying, if it's,
[01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.930]  you know, if you have to dig through snow, probably not your best time to collect. You can feel free
[01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:24.970]  to actually skip that and just focus on the times. We're also not cultivating in the winter.
[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:30.010]  So for me, if I have something that's happy when it's halfway frozen out there, well, it doesn't
[01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:36.730]  really matter because when that microbe is active is not what I'm cultivating anyway. So, you know,
[01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:45.530]  if you're in Florida, yeah, do it all year round. Go and collect all the time. But if you're in,
[01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:50.490]  you know, Montana, feel free to not have to deal with trying to dig through snow to make an IMO
[01:18:50.490 --> 01:19:04.520]  collection. You don't need to. Hey, Wendy, I've got a question for you. I would just ask the
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:12.520]  question. All right. So Wendy, in the chat, there was a gentleman that said that I had recommended
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.880]  saying, hey, look, if you live on the south side of the mountain, don't be collecting your IMO on
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.200]  the north side because you're at a different exposure. And the gentleman said that he
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:33.870]  disagrees. What are your feelings on that, Wendy? I am inclined to agree with the gentleman.
[01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:42.750]  I don't think, I mean, I think that ideally you want to be collecting closer to where you're
[01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:47.790]  cultivating. So like, you know, hiking over a mountain is not necessarily something you need to
[01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:53.310]  do. However, you are going to get a different diversity there. And, you know, we're talking
[01:19:53.310 --> 01:20:00.270]  about north versus south. Well, if your south side is grassland and you don't have a lot of,
[01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:07.230]  you know, of old growth forests, then yeah, go to the north side and collect over there.
[01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:11.950]  The other thing we want to think about is, you know, what you're cultivating. So if you're
[01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:21.070]  cultivating an orchard and again, your south side is, you know, has a different sun and different
[01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:27.230]  humidity and you know, whatever, but maybe underneath your apple trees is more like your
[01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:31.630]  north side. You might want to go ahead and focus on that north side because you're now
[01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:36.750]  mimicking what's happening over there. So again, there's some amount of
[01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:43.870]  common sense, if you will, of being able to look at your environment and mimic nature,
[01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:48.030]  because that's really what we're doing here. This is a lot of biomimicry that we're doing,
[01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:53.950]  right? We're looking at where we're cultivating and we're trying to mimic what would naturally
[01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:59.870]  happen. But generally where we're cultivating is not where that process would naturally be
[01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:07.150]  happening anyway. Like for me, we've got a big, huge open field. It's grassland. It's got
[01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:14.030]  bacterially dominant soil. It has low organic content. I don't want to actually keep that that
[01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:19.310]  way. I want to make something that is happier for the plants that I'm growing. So I'm mimicking
[01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:24.430]  what's happening where those plants would grow naturally, which would be more towards the forest.
[01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:27.870]  It would be on the tree line. It would be, you know, wouldn't be in the middle of that field
[01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:34.430]  necessarily, but that field is where I want to grow because that's where I get the best exposure.
[01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:40.350]  So I want to bring the soil that would be, that plant would be happier growing in, into the field
[01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:47.310]  where I get the light. So there's some amount of balance, if you will, that you want to be able to
[01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:55.230]  mimic. So again, as far as the north side versus south side versus up higher, down lower, you know,
[01:21:55.230 --> 01:22:01.790]  I don't think there's anything wrong with going everywhere around your farm or your garden and
[01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:08.670]  bringing that diversity in. If there's something that really isn't happy in that area, it's not
[01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:12.990]  going to propagate out anyway. It's going to go dormant. It's going to die off and it's going to
[01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:18.990]  be out-competed by the things that are more dominant and happy there. So, you know, it's not,
[01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.070]  yeah, I mean, I say go for it personally. I say do it all.
[01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:30.190]  So thank you, Wendy. That was key. And you know, diversity is king and I've seen it
[01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:34.110]  popping up in the, in the side chats. Hey, Tina Trout, how are you girl?
[01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:39.230]  You know, I think that the other piece of the puzzle that we're, we didn't hit on yet is that
[01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:44.590]  the reason we're making IMO collections is because we've disturbed the soil.
[01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:54.110]  These fragile organisms have been lost due to our practices of applying pesticides, fertilizers,
[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:59.710]  tilling, all these things have reduced the population of the microorganisms. That's why
[01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:04.110]  IMO is so important is to make those collections, reintroduce them to the soil
[01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:10.270]  and don't fuck it up next time. Just don't apply any of that stuff. Water only. Yeah,
[01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:15.710]  you can use teas, compost. I see a lot of talk about thermal compost being as good as an IMO.
[01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:22.110]  It isn't. Thermal compost is more of like a local collection. You're collecting your local greens
[01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:27.390]  and browns. An IMO is further out. It's in an undisturbed area. And I think that needs to get
[01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:33.550]  driven home. You are collecting where nobody has destroyed it. No one's cut down all the trees. No
[01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:38.910]  one's put in a development. No one's plowed, plowed it up and turned it into a crop field
[01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:44.030]  and then let it sit for 10 years. Okay. Those are not places that you're going to find IMO.
[01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:51.790]  IMO is in areas that are undisturbed. Yeah, maybe it's been hiked in, but not tilled or not developed
[01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:59.390]  or not exposed to undue amount of chemicals or anything like that. You're really trying to
[01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:05.390]  collect these organisms that are very fragile in an area or an environment that has not been
[01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:09.790]  totally abused by humanity. So again, that's the key to the IMO collection.
[01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:15.070]  And what Wendy was referring to as far as taking an IMO2, which is a little jar
[01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:25.390]  and then making an IMO3, you're turning it into 300 pounds, 200 pounds of IMO3. Now that IMO3,
[01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:31.390]  again, you can top dress eighth of an inch over an acre or two of land. And you've just taken a
[01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:36.030]  little jar, which you've only used a handful of and converted it into something that you can
[01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:42.110]  spread out over an acre or more. And that's what she meant about taking upscaling, up-bumping.
[01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:48.590]  So again, you're growing these things out so that they're more and more abundant. And that's why
[01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:56.030]  it's very foolish to use IMO2 in anything other than an IMO3. And then the IMO4, as Chris explains
[01:24:56.030 --> 01:25:02.350]  it to me, this is when the soil organisms are introduced. So the IMO2 collection is pretty much
[01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:09.150]  yeasts, saprophytic fungi. Yeah, you'll get a little bit of predators, but when the real predators
[01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:14.670]  come into play is when you start making an IMO4, which is the introduction to soil. And then
[01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:19.870]  obviously the IMO5 is the introduction to a manure source of some kind. So Wendy, do you want to add
[01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:44.810]  anything to that? Okay, I'll jump in while she's void. Just when she pops back. Yeah, no, that's
[01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:52.570]  perfectly exactly it. Somebody's asking about how to avoid getting pests from an IMO collection and
[01:25:52.570 --> 01:26:01.610]  that it seems like a vector. I totally disagree. You shouldn't get pests in IMO.
[01:26:06.330 --> 01:26:14.170]  Yeah, I'm sorry, you guys. This is a mess. We can totally hear you, Wendy. We can hear everything
[01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:23.050]  you're saying. Okay. So yeah, you're not going to get pests. I mean, there's a lot of misconceptions
[01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:31.610]  about cannabis pests that also kind of drives me a little bat shit crazy. People really liked to
[01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:37.610]  spread rumors and bro science around and like, well, I heard this from my buddy who heard it
[01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:44.970]  from their buddy who experienced it except for her buddy's buddy's buddy is a mess and doesn't
[01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:52.490]  have any procedures to keep quarantined or keep things clean. And so what you thought was, you
[01:26:52.490 --> 01:27:01.450]  know, some magical infestation of russet mites that came from nowhere or that came from a freaking,
[01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:10.090]  I don't know, your kale or something. It's just not correct. It's the hemp russet mite. Hemp,
[01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:16.810]  hemp, hemp is cannabis. That's it. It might live on hops, but it does not live on your lettuce.
[01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:23.290]  It does not live in your companion plants. It does not live on your cover crop. It might overwinter
[01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:29.610]  on debris. So if you don't have a clean farm and you're not composting your green material,
[01:27:29.610 --> 01:27:35.450]  or if you're keeping moms all year round, yeah, it's probably from that. Or it's probably from
[01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:41.850]  your buddy who went into their hemp russet infested indoor and then came over to your place
[01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:46.410]  without changing your clothes. And then you guys all hung out and then you went into your garden
[01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:52.250]  without changing your clothes. This is quarantine procedures like ghosts to standard horticulture
[01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:58.330]  and check it out. They do not let you into those like poinsettias are a perfect example. So Suzanne
[01:27:58.330 --> 01:28:05.130]  Wainwright Evans is an amazing entomologist and she drove this home to my head years ago was that
[01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:13.050]  poinsettias, they make a penny per plant. They do not make money. So if you look at the procedures
[01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:18.890]  that a poinsettia farm does mimic that, that's what those people do. They can't afford to get
[01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:24.250]  broad mites because they literally can't afford to treat the plant for the broad mites. So,
[01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:30.650]  you know, if you go to those places, they're not allowing you to just walk around in there without
[01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:37.930]  a Tyvek suit and a fricking hazmat helmet, you know, like, we as cannabis cultivators, we love
[01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:44.250]  sharing cuts. We love swapping stories. We love visiting everybody else's farms. And that's all
[01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:48.810]  amazing and rad. But that's where your pests are coming from. They're not coming from IMO.
[01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:54.490]  They're not coming from a box price. They're not coming magically in. I mean, maybe they're
[01:28:54.490 --> 01:29:03.610]  birds, I guess, but I suspect that 99% of the time they're coming from bad procedures that you
[01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:11.610]  are implementing on your own. You bring the bugs in 99% of the time. I know people don't want to
[01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:19.770]  admit that. People really want to blame, you know, other things, but it's just not true, you guys.
[01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:27.290]  I'm sorry, but the truth of the matter is those bugs that you have came in because you did things
[01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:34.970]  sloppy, period. Stay human, Vector. Oh, I love that. Yeah, you know, in the aquaculture industry
[01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:41.210]  is where I learned about biosecurity. And when I started getting involved with the cannabis crew,
[01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:46.570]  I was like, don't you guys like deal with any biosecurity? And they basically laughed. What is
[01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:53.450]  that? And she's spot on. I mean, you really have to be so careful. Everything is a vector. You know,
[01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:59.130]  maybe the birds, but I doubt it. The bugs aren't coming in on the birds, maybe nematodes that we
[01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:04.650]  know of. But for the most part, she is absolutely spot on. They're coming in because you're not
[01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:09.610]  quarantining the plants. You're not paying attention to your clothes or hanging out with
[01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:15.610]  your buddies or just inappropriately walking around your garden after you've been hanging out
[01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:21.530]  with somebody. Like, it doesn't matter. You are the problem. Now, Wendy, someone had brought up
[01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:28.650]  IMO 4, how deep to collect the soil. Now, my advice to this is that you want to, again, be collecting
[01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:35.050]  fields or areas that are undisturbed. I know it's problematic for the most part because there is
[01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:42.410]  very little undisturbed soil around. But if you're going into an IMO 4, try to find the soil that
[01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:48.250]  has been least disturbed or at least has been follow for a number of years. Organic standards
[01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:54.090]  by the US require that the field be followed for three years or not be exposed to any synthetics
[01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:59.370]  for three years. Personally, that's not enough. I personally think it's more like five years if
[01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:03.770]  you're going to be doing an IMO 4. You want something that has had a chance to recover.
[01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:08.490]  Again, the diversity is not going to be there. The diversity comes with your IMO collection.
[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:14.490]  You're just introducing that diversity to an existing biology that's not diverse but is
[01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:18.330]  present and functioning in that soil system. Wendy, do you have any feelings on that?
[01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:27.370]  Yeah, so IMO 4, generally what we're actually doing is trying to get a large portion of that
[01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:33.050]  to be the soil that we're actually going to cultivate in. So you don't need to go out and
[01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:38.890]  dig up the undisturbed field. You need to go and dig up your garden soil. So a large portion of
[01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:45.530]  that. I mean, it's great to get that diversity of the undisturbed soil as well. But really,
[01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:51.610]  when you're thinking about this, again, this is kind of like a transplanting, if you will.
[01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:59.370]  So you're trying to transplant your soil fungal biology from your IMO 1 into your soil so that
[01:31:59.370 --> 01:32:05.610]  you can spread it out on your gardening soil and have it readily inoculate your garden soil.
[01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:11.770]  So if you're using a soil that isn't part of your garden soil, you're kind of missing part of that.
[01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:23.130]  So that garden soil needs to be a part of that IMO 4. I mean, for me, we grow in our native soil.
[01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:31.770]  So I get to just kind of skip that step anyway by going to my garden and doing the garden soil
[01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:40.650]  itself. There's also a percentage of red soil that is recommended that you use. So I believe it's 25%.
[01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:46.490]  I generally, we don't have red soil where I live. So when I drive to Sacramento to go places,
[01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:52.330]  I travel with five gallon buckets and I literally pull over. I'll drive down little roads and up
[01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:59.850]  into a mountain because they've got amazing red soil on the 299 between, or not the 299, it's the
[01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:05.690]  20. I can't remember what highway it is. Whatever highway it is that cuts across from Ukiah and goes
[01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:11.530]  to Sacramento. If you live in that area or you drive that area, check it out and go down a little
[01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:17.850]  road and go up into the mountain and get some of that red soil. For me, I'll use those buckets of,
[01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:24.170]  you know, to whatever percentage it comes out to. I'm not super particular about that, but it does,
[01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:28.250]  it has high iron content. It's got a whole different host of micronutrients and things
[01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:35.370]  that are amazing to add, get your fungal biology monster to munch on. So I use a certain percent
[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:41.690]  of that. And then, like I said, I mean, I'll just go with my garden soil itself. If again,
[01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:47.370]  if you're in pots or something, if you're in smart pots and you're growing in potting soil,
[01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:53.850]  then yeah, I would go for the most undisturbed areas that you can. And I would use that and some
[01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:59.610]  of your potting soil as well. But I really encourage people to start getting away from
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:05.850]  those smart pots, get away from that potting soil. It gets depleted and you really have to work hard
[01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:12.250]  to keep it inoculated year after year after year. So if you want to make your life easy,
[01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:18.970]  which is really what we all should be aiming for is making farming easy so that more people do it,
[01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:24.330]  so that our quality of our produce and our medicine is better. It's all about making this
[01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:27.930]  easy, right? If it's something super hard, you're not going to go after it that much.
[01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:34.730]  So while IMO collections might be hard at the beginning, it makes the rest of your life super
[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:40.330]  duper easy, especially if you can get into that native soil and get that amended, get rid of those
[01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:45.050]  smart pots, get rid of the potting soil. It's not doing you any favors in the longterm at all.
[01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:53.370]  And start doing your IMO 4 with whatever ground you have underneath your feet, literally. And
[01:34:54.570 --> 01:34:59.690]  that's where I come from for IMO 4 is that you're really wanting to, yeah,
[01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:04.170]  get into native soil and you want to inoculate your soil that you're growing in.
[01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:10.880]  Thanks, Wendy. That was important. Yeah, I was looking at it from the new soil side,
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:17.120]  like because I do a lot of engineering for people for mixing soils together to get them ready to
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:24.000]  grow, we have to introduce stuff. And so how do you collect that stuff? And you hit it. If you
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.920]  have an existing garden, yeah, your IMO 4 is mixing your existing soil with an IMO 3. But if
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.200]  you're building a raised bed or you're growing into a new facility where you don't have any soil,
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.880]  that's when you want to collect the most undisturbed soil you can. And again,
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.880]  highly recommend go to Shango Lowe's YouTube. You can learn all about soil horizons. This is by far
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:53.280]  the best way to make long-term living soils. As she said, as Wendy said about potting soils,
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:59.760]  they're collapsed. They're not stable soil systems. They go anaerobic on the inside,
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:05.040]  aerobic on the outside. They eventually break down. You've got to keep adding stuff to it.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.560]  So if you just build a horizontal soil system, what happens is the roots will actually fill it
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.000]  in and you really will not lose any mass. And you really don't have to amend it that much,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.640]  because you've got the parent material for these organisms to grow.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:27.680]  These organisms to mine and to use up and bring to your plant. Now again, if you're really pushing
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.200]  the plants, then you probably want to start looking into some of these really new amino
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:40.560]  acid digested formulations for foliar application. The couple that I've played with actually play
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.880]  really nice with the soil biology. They've not only feed the plant above ground, but anything
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.480]  that drips on the soil actually feeds the biology in the soil. So again, if you're pushing your
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:58.160]  plant, you're trying to get the most you possibly can out of it, then you're never going to hit that
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.920]  with just soil and biology. You're going to have to go to some of these advances in nutrition,
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:11.360]  plant nutrition, not advanced nutrients. Don't get that wrong. Wendy, what else? I've seen
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:18.080]  the comments about the difference between JDOM and NF. Can you speak a little on that? Because I
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:29.690]  know you went to Korea and learned quite a bit about this. Yeah. So JDOM is basically Master
[01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:37.610]  Cho created KNF as we know it in the Western culture here. He really put it together and
[01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:43.610]  brought it to the United States or people went to Korea and then brought it to the United States.
[01:37:44.490 --> 01:37:50.810]  JDOM was created by his son. What his son said was, and I'm going to just absolutely
[01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:59.210]  give you a quick synopsis, but he basically was like, this is maybe too hard and I just want to
[01:37:59.210 --> 01:38:05.050]  make things a little bit easier. So he created, it works great. Both of them work amazingly well.
[01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:13.290]  There's no problem with JDOM. However, it does tend to take a slightly
[01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:22.890]  less structured, if you will, point of view. So like JLF is something that people really like,
[01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:28.330]  which is JDOM liquid fertilizer. I call it throwing shit in a bucket and letting it putrefy.
[01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:37.370]  And it's fine. It works. It works right. It's easy. KNF, the processes are,
[01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:46.730]  I don't think they're difficult, but they take more intention. They take more time. OHN,
[01:38:46.730 --> 01:38:54.250]  Oriental Herbal Nutrient is a phenomenal input. I use it for human health. We take it daily. We
[01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:59.770]  don't really get sick anymore since I've been taking it, but it takes three months to make.
[01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:07.450]  So, again, if this is something that you're in it for a short term and you don't really want to
[01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:15.610]  take things years out into the future, JDOM is a faster process. It's easier. I do love the fact
[01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:25.530]  that JDOM has pesticide applications where KNF does not. Natural farming is also, everything that
[01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:31.610]  we do in natural farming can be utilized internally as a human being. So when you're making
[01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:38.890]  fish amino acid for your plants, you can take that internally as well. With JDOM, almost nothing
[01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:45.050]  is safe for human consumption. Do not drink a bucket of putrefied plant material that's been
[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:49.450]  sitting out for six months to a year. It's not going to be good for you. Don't get it on your
[01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:59.290]  skin. It stinks. It's really smelly, which is why I don't like it. I don't want to be in my garden
[01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:05.370]  around something that reeks like death. It's just not pleasant. I want to be out there happy,
[01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:09.530]  hanging out for as long as I want to be out there, not running away because I have a bucket of
[01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:17.610]  steaming manure that smells like literally crap. So I love KNF. I love natural farming because of
[01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:25.370]  that. I love that everything is safe for me. You can spray it on yourself. There's no chance of
[01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:31.930]  getting weird things that are going to maybe make you go blind, or especially for cannabis,
[01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:39.210]  if you have a bucket of JDOM liquid fertilizer and you added chicken manure to that,
[01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:46.330]  there is the possibility that you have added E. coli or salmonella or perhaps something else
[01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:51.290]  that's going to have you failing testing later on down the line. So I'm spraying that stuff all over,
[01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:58.170]  and I don't know what I'm putting on my plants. And that can be very problematic for cannabis
[01:40:58.170 --> 01:41:03.130]  industry that is in the commercial side of things, and that has to go through very, very rigorous
[01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:10.090]  testing in states like California. I believe also Washington and Oregon have some pretty stringent
[01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:14.650]  testing as well. Oklahoma, I don't know. Do y'all even have to test? I don't think you do.
[01:41:15.930 --> 01:41:24.090]  So maybe for you guys, it doesn't matter so much. But again, JDOM and KNF, different in their
[01:41:24.090 --> 01:41:31.530]  methodologies. JDOM, like I said, has pesticide applications, so that's great. I do make JDOM
[01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:37.690]  wetting agent, which is a liquid soap. I use that on plants. I use that on my hands. We use that as
[01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:45.610]  my floors. I use it for everything. It's amazing. It's fabulous, fabulous soap. Super cheap,
[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:53.690]  very easy to make. Also a bit dangerous. Make sure you wear personal protection equipment. So cover
[01:41:53.690 --> 01:42:00.570]  your mouth because you're using potassium hydroxide, KOH, and that stuff can burn you and
[01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:06.570]  it can actually be really, really damaging to your lungs, your eyes, and your skin.
[01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:11.530]  So again, the difference between KNF, get that all over you. Whatever you're using, it doesn't
[01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:16.970]  matter. You can eat it, you can drink it, you can bathe in it, all good to go. JDOM, be careful.
[01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:23.050]  It's a bit more dangerous. But again, KNF doesn't allow for pesticides.
[01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:28.090]  Dr. Tom Bilella Thank you, Wendy. That was huge. And
[01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:33.690]  apparently you're a trifecta. Not only are you hot, you're intelligent, but you smoke weed. So
[01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:37.130]  I thought I'd share that comment with you. Dr. Jed Lee
[01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:42.090]  This is, I think this is an important topic just to pause on for a second because I know there are
[01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:48.490]  people in the chat who are very JDOM oriented. And they said, it's almost like there was
[01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:54.330]  Catholicism and then the Protestant Reformation came and the accusation was that the Catholics
[01:42:54.330 --> 01:43:00.490]  were being too, you know, you can pay your way into heaven. And I think the JDOM knock on KNF
[01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:06.090]  is that it's for rich people and it doesn't scale. And JDOM is kind of cheaper inputs and like
[01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:13.130]  someone earlier said brown sugar doesn't grow ever, you know. So and then you mentioned also
[01:43:13.130 --> 01:43:18.490]  commercial app. I want people to hear that, you know, some stuff is okay in your home and your
[01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:24.410]  backyard. But if you're growing commercially and testing, like Steve Cantwell pulls his hair out,
[01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:30.650]  because, you know, in Nevada, there are a lot of things he'd want to do that he can't do because
[01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:39.370]  you'd get dinged for testing. So can you talk about the kind of JDOM like, because it seems
[01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:44.570]  like you're versed in both and you and you have them both in your toolkit and you use them when
[01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:48.570]  appropriate. You're not pooh poohing one or the other. I mean, you mentioned you use a bunch of
[01:43:48.570 --> 01:43:53.210]  things from one and a bunch of things from the other. Dr. Jedica Miller
[01:43:53.210 --> 01:44:01.530]  Yeah, I, you know, I have talked with people who say that KNF is not scalable. And I immediately
[01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:08.330]  come back to like, well, you know, Australia and Hawaii both are doing KNF on extremely large scale
[01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:14.330]  in macadamia nut fields. There's a wonderful lady named Catherine Rose, I believe her name is
[01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:22.490]  in Australia. And she, I believe, learned from Chris Trump, who also does KNF on large scale
[01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:27.930]  in Hawaii. And so both of them are yes, they are growing macadamia nuts, there is a different
[01:44:27.930 --> 01:44:33.530]  product, of course, but to say it's not scalable, well, then how the heck are they doing 700 plus
[01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:41.530]  acres? Don't tell me it's not scalable. It absolutely is. It is dependent upon your time
[01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:48.250]  and you know how much you really want to put into it. JDOM. Yeah, probably faster, easier for a lot
[01:44:48.250 --> 01:44:54.490]  of people, a lot of people can get behind that, because they're like, I don't want to make 500
[01:44:54.490 --> 01:44:59.610]  gallons of OHN that I'm going to need for the next five years. That is the most expensive input that
[01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:07.530]  we make. However, if you don't want to buy, you know, 500 gallons of vodka by a still and you can
[01:45:07.530 --> 01:45:15.450]  make it yourself. Everything that we do with KNF is absolutely scalable. It is actually there's a
[01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:23.210]  gentleman named Glenn, who I took class with Chris's class. And I believe he was in class
[01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:30.970]  last year, the year before he's a cattle rancher. And he unfortunately was the brunt of my
[01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:36.170]  eventual yelling at him because he kept saying like, well, I can't afford this. I can't afford
[01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:41.050]  this. Like I can't afford to do KNF on my ranch because I run thousands of acres. This is
[01:45:41.050 --> 01:45:46.010]  ridiculous. And I was like, Okay, stop. You're thinking about it the wrong direction. Don't
[01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:52.330]  think about like, I can't afford $24 an acre. Flip it. What can you afford? Zero? Okay, fine.
[01:45:52.330 --> 01:45:57.290]  Find one of the inputs that doesn't cost anything. Make WCA water soluble calcium, you might have to
[01:45:57.290 --> 01:46:02.570]  buy vinegar. You don't even have to buy vinegar, you can make vinegar. So a lot of these things
[01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:08.970]  can be little to no cost. Some of them do cost money. But in the cannabis industry, I can't tell
[01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:19.050]  you how many probably hundreds of thousands of dollars we spend as an industry. No, it's probably
[01:46:19.050 --> 01:46:24.330]  millions. Honestly, it is millions. It's absolutely millions. It might be in billions that we spend on
[01:46:24.330 --> 01:46:29.930]  nutrients that we think are the absolute this is the shit nectar of the gods is the shit. I'm gonna
[01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:36.810]  buy it because it's an amazing fertilizer line and it is, but it is expensive. So you know, when we
[01:46:36.810 --> 01:46:43.290]  start backing things up into what can you afford focus on those things. IMO, it's rice, it's not
[01:46:43.290 --> 01:46:50.650]  expensive, you can do it. Jadam, even less expensive. Throw your weeds in a bucket and add water. Great.
[01:46:50.650 --> 01:46:57.370]  That's awesome. That works well for a lot of people. And so if that's the route you want to go,
[01:46:57.370 --> 01:47:02.810]  I absolutely encourage you to go there because any step towards sustainability and towards
[01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:09.210]  regenerative agriculture is a step in the right direction. Personally, I love knf. Again, I like to
[01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:16.490]  feel safe. I like to do things that I can use on multiple levels. So if this is something I get to
[01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:23.290]  ingest, and that increases my health as a human being, I prefer to do that. But I absolutely have
[01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:29.450]  no problems with people that want to do Jadam. I do have problems with people that say, I can't
[01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:36.970]  scale knf. Again, you can do anything you choose to do. You can get IMO collections when you live
[01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:44.250]  in the middle of Los Angeles, you have to work a little harder for it. But that is where we're at.
[01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:50.010]  I was telling people, I'm like, I would be a terrible politician. People in my county asked me
[01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:53.450]  every now and then like, when are you going to run for the board of supervisors? I'm like, I'm never
[01:47:53.450 --> 01:48:00.730]  going to because I don't believe in compromise anymore. I don't believe that, you know, we're in
[01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:08.650]  a position as a species to be able to make easy choices. We have to make more difficult choices
[01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:16.330]  now. So if you want to run knf, and it requires you having to take a drive to collect IMO, take
[01:48:16.330 --> 01:48:22.090]  the fucking drive, collect the IMO. If you decide that you don't want to do knf because it's too
[01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:28.010]  much commitment, go for Jadam. Freaking throw shit in a bucket and let it putrefy. Do that.
[01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:34.890]  Take that step. I don't care which step you want to take. But any step towards regenerative
[01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:40.490]  organic cultivation is a step in the right fucking direction. I cannot express that enough.
[01:48:41.930 --> 01:48:49.530]  Wow, I love the passion girl. You go. Apparently now they're calling you a doctor in the chat too.
[01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:56.330]  You're going up another notch. Yeah, you know, I would love to speak on that as well. I think
[01:48:56.330 --> 01:49:02.570]  people that sit there and say that, you know, knf is expensive. There are morons. All right, look,
[01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:09.530]  bottom line is how much can you afford to lose? A penny saved is a penny earned. If you got 50%
[01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:15.050]  increase in your crop because you use natural farming techniques, that's 50% more money you
[01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:22.490]  just put in your pocket. If you have 50% less pest pressure, so therefore less time calling,
[01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:30.650]  fighting, fighting nature, hours, hours equals money, guys, time is money. Then what did you
[01:49:30.650 --> 01:49:36.730]  really spend? That's the piece that people just don't get anymore. A penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:49:36.730 --> 01:49:42.570]  And if you're using things that are very inexpensive to produce, that you use a tiny
[01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:49.050]  little one to a thousand, one to 500, I mean, that stuff's going to last you for years. So,
[01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:53.370]  you know, get your head out of you, you know what, and really look at the numbers. Like if
[01:49:53.370 --> 01:50:01.770]  this saves you time, this is prevents you from having cross loss or worse, reduced cross crops,
[01:50:01.770 --> 01:50:07.770]  then you've won. So if you really sit down and put pen to paper, you're going to see that natural
[01:50:07.770 --> 01:50:13.690]  farming penny for penny is probably the most bad-ass system on the planet. And let's face it,
[01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:20.890]  it was designed for people, poor farmers that had nothing and they still needed to bring a crop in.
[01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:26.410]  So, you know, let's put that aside. And as far as JDOM and Korean natural farming, I think Wendy
[01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:31.450]  summed that up for you pretty clearly. You know, yes, JDOM is less expensive, but you can't put
[01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:38.010]  the stuff in your face. You got to be protected. You got to be careful with it. To me, the price
[01:50:38.010 --> 01:50:45.530]  of having to be careful is a price I'd rather not pay. I'd rather be able to just play with it,
[01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:52.410]  get it on me, get it in me and not be stressed about wearing gloves and face masks and handling
[01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:58.730]  these, you know, these chemicals and putrefied fricking manure. Guys, like, you know, I played
[01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:04.970]  in the aquaculture industry for years. I got pretty sick a couple of times from streptococcus,
[01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:10.730]  from shakilla, salmonella, you name it, because there's all kinds of bad shit, especially in some
[01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:16.010]  of these really dirty aquaculture companies that aren't taking care of their fish. I got sick. It's
[01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:21.610]  not fun. So, you know, you want to play with JDOM, go for it. Just be careful. And don't come back
[01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:26.090]  and complain that you got sick because you were fucking around with manures. Sorry, didn't mean
[01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:33.130]  to get heated. So I totally agree. I totally agree with all of that. Like, that's that's how I feel
[01:51:33.130 --> 01:51:39.850]  too is that, you know, and again, when we start talking about commercial cultivation specifically,
[01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:45.210]  and you start having to really run those not like run the numbers, you guys, oh my gosh, the amount
[01:51:45.210 --> 01:51:49.930]  of people that don't know their numbers is mind blowing in the California commercial cannabis
[01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:55.530]  industry. I mean, it's crazy. You little tent in your house, that's a totally different thing. But
[01:51:55.530 --> 01:52:00.010]  at that point, you know, your one tiny little bag of sugar is going to last you for five years.
[01:52:01.050 --> 01:52:07.850]  But but as far as numbers go, like the labor it takes to apply things carefully, is going to be
[01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:14.090]  much higher than the labor it takes to just, you know, hose things down. And and again, that's
[01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:20.170]  another reason why I love knf is we don't have to be careful. It's great. And I do want to touch
[01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:25.050]  real quick on the sugar thing, because I hear that a lot. I live in a place where sugar is
[01:52:25.050 --> 01:52:32.410]  really expensive. I get it. I totally get it. I feel you guys I understand. No, you cannot use
[01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:39.370]  molasses instead. However, I have a friend in the Philippines. Her name is loose. She does
[01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:46.090]  Ganda natural farming, which is a lot like knf but has spin off on it. And it's like, you know,
[01:52:46.090 --> 01:52:50.890]  same, same, some same processes, some things that are different. They make coconut sugar. She gave
[01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:57.370]  me this amazing coconut sugar works great. It's there are alternatives. There are you know,
[01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:02.810]  demerara sugar as raw as you can get. It doesn't have to be brown sugar. And in fact, brown sugar,
[01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:10.170]  as we know it in the United States is a good alternative, but the less processed you can get,
[01:53:10.170 --> 01:53:15.610]  the better it is. So think less processed brown. Traditionally, that was a
[01:53:15.690 --> 01:53:22.570]  a bit of an error in translation when it came to the United States master chow meant brown as in
[01:53:22.570 --> 01:53:27.930]  the color, not as in a product. So we have brown sugar, which is white sugar that has had the
[01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:33.530]  molasses added back in that is important. It is a micronutrient that you need to feed your
[01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:40.410]  pruning bodies and things. So your microbes basically, but, but less processed is better. So
[01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:47.370]  if you're in India, it's called Jaggery. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right. J A G G E R Y
[01:53:47.370 --> 01:53:53.850]  Jaggery, Jaggery, any rate, non processed sugars. They're great. And again, if you're in a place
[01:53:53.850 --> 01:54:03.130]  where you have to buy sugar, and it is expensive, focus on the most important inputs, IMO, your one
[01:54:03.930 --> 01:54:12.090]  gallon of IMO collection is going to last you three years, that one gallon of IMO or half a
[01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:16.570]  gallon or whatever the case may be, however many collections you can get that are good.
[01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:21.690]  It's a very, very, very small amount of sugar that you're going to use over the years. So when you
[01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:27.690]  start nailing out those price points, and you say it's too expensive, like Leighton is saying, like
[01:54:27.690 --> 01:54:33.050]  define too expensive, what's too expensive, losing your crop is too expensive. You know,
[01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:40.570]  losing your special genetics is too expensive. These things are too expensive. A bag of brown
[01:54:40.570 --> 01:54:45.610]  sugar is not too expensive when that's going to last you for years, figure out a way to save the
[01:54:45.610 --> 01:54:50.330]  money to get that one bag of sugar so that you don't have to rebuy it and you don't have to
[01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:55.930]  redo your things. And you now have three years of soil health for that. Let's say it's crazy
[01:54:55.930 --> 01:55:02.250]  expensive and you spent $100 on that bag of sugar over three years. That's $33 a year every month.
[01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:06.730]  That's three bucks. Don't tell me it's too expensive. It's not you can make it happen.
[01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:11.450]  Again, you may have to save for it, but people that want things will find a way to make them
[01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:18.010]  happen. So you know, if you want an excuse to not do these things, you don't even need it. You
[01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:22.570]  don't have to say the sugar is too expensive. You can just say, I don't choose to go down that route.
[01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:27.530]  This isn't for me. That's fine. I have no problem with that. You want to do it though, find a way to
[01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:32.810]  do it. You want to grow organically and you just want to use manures and oyster shell and green sand
[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:38.970]  and or whatever the case may be. Do that too. That's great also. Again, back on my regenerative soapbox
[01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:46.330]  of find a way to increase your soil health and increase your land stewardship and therefore help
[01:55:46.330 --> 01:55:52.330]  us save the fucking planet because oh my god, we need help. Don't give excuses. Find a way to make
[01:55:52.330 --> 01:56:01.370]  it happen. And just quickly, Leighton, I want to give you an opportunity to address something and
[01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:10.090]  maybe restate in different words. You said the word morons before and I saw that. I saw that.
[01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:16.890]  Yes. So I don't think you're saying like everybody's a moron if they don't adopt every
[01:56:17.290 --> 01:56:23.850]  aspect of cannabis. No. And I use the word moron as moron. Don't be a moron. Don't put moron.
[01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:31.050]  Use less. Less is more. So I saw that comment and I was going to clarify that as well. And again,
[01:56:31.690 --> 01:56:37.450]  think about where this came from. This came from people that didn't have a lot of resources.
[01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:41.690]  They weren't wealthy Americans growing cannabis. They were trying to grow rice
[01:56:41.690 --> 01:56:47.850]  with no fertilizers, very little animal inputs. And this is what came out of it. So it's a
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:54.810]  beautiful natural system. It is regenerative because it's not taking more than it's giving
[01:56:54.810 --> 01:57:00.090]  back. It's actually giving back hundredfold compared to most other traditional systems
[01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:07.130]  of fertilizing and or crop steering or epigenetic pushing. So thank you for pointing that out. And
[01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:12.810]  and someone also said in the chat, oh, Leighton and Wendy are becoming best friends. Dude,
[01:57:12.810 --> 01:57:21.370]  we've been best friends for about four years now. And Wendy is, from what I understand, single. So
[01:57:21.370 --> 01:57:28.170]  if any of you guys are decent, I would recommend you hit her up. She is beautiful, smart, smokes
[01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:37.450]  weed. Only because I love you, Wendy. Well, Leighton, do you want to help Brian and DeJara?
[01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:43.370]  Well, DeJara, are you single? Oh, he's muted. Hold on. Let me. He's very quiet. But this is
[01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:50.410]  how we can pull him into the conversation. Yeah, I'm on the market. All right. So ladies out there,
[01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:58.090]  you got a guy in in Colorado and all the Humboldt guys. But I think and this is the other part of
[01:57:58.090 --> 01:58:05.770]  that same comment, which is, yeah, some things aren't local, like cinnamon, obviously, and sugar
[01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:12.250]  don't grow everywhere. But my sense is that you'd say you use to the best of your ability is what
[01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:17.050]  you can in your local area if you're on a budget, not that you have to do everything.
[01:58:17.610 --> 01:58:23.130]  Yeah, I think again, it's just a matter of paying attention to your local resources. I mean,
[01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:30.090]  we all got dollar stores and you can often find, you know, unprocessed sugars in dollar stores and
[01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:37.610]  some of these other ingredients. So, you know, again, you can be the perfectionist and only use
[01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:43.290]  the best ingredients. But in this situation, if you're using a substandard ingredient, it's not
[01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:49.370]  going to destroy the end result. It's just getting you to the next step to where you can afford to
[01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:56.490]  buy the organic sugar or the organic sugar cane. So, you know, you can be a purist or you can be
[01:58:56.490 --> 01:59:01.050]  a realist. And I tend to be, you know, somewhere in the middle, like, yeah, I'd like everything to
[01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:06.490]  be perfect, but it's not going to be. And again, you know, hitting home what Wendy's saying is that
[01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:12.010]  seriously, we all have to be looking at our own lives and our world in a different way.
[01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:17.130]  We have to be looking at our own lives and are we regenerative? Are we taking more than we're
[01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:22.730]  giving back? Because if you are taking more than you're giving back, you're helping the problem.
[01:59:22.730 --> 01:59:29.210]  You're encouraging this train wreck to continue. If we don't change our practices, especially
[01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:35.930]  agricultural, land care, land management, we are in serious trouble. And so, you know, I've always
[01:59:36.730 --> 01:59:42.890]  you know, publicly that I truly pray the cannabis plant is the catalyst plant that finally wakes
[01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:49.530]  humanity up. If our food was being tested the way cannabis is, we couldn't eat anything. There would
[01:59:49.530 --> 01:59:55.370]  be nothing that we were allowed to eat because it's all loaded with antibiotics, growth hormones,
[01:59:55.370 --> 02:00:03.130]  pesticides, fertilizers, Roundup. We all know that the stuff is loaded. So if cannabis wakes people
[02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:09.530]  up to being like, well, I can only consume this cannabis if it's been tested to this standard.
[02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:16.730]  Why the hell is it my food being tested this way? And Ag sees us growing, you know, amazing plants
[02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:23.610]  with pennies on the dollar for fertilizer compared to them. Why wouldn't they say, hey, you know what,
[02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:30.650]  I can make IMO four or IMO three and liquefy it and spray it on 100 acres for the cost of
[02:00:30.650 --> 02:00:37.130]  treating one acre. Why wouldn't they do do it? So we're just in this transition period of trying to
[02:00:37.130 --> 02:00:42.650]  make, you know, these kinds of things, make people aware of these kinds of things, these tools,
[02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:48.330]  because they're going to be critical in the future. I mean, our health is a big issue. And the reason
[02:00:48.330 --> 02:00:53.610]  we're so unhealthy is because we have no nutrition left in our food. I mean, the nutritional value of
[02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:58.970]  an apple has been lost by 80% in the last 50 years. And that's fact. Google me, you know,
[02:00:58.970 --> 02:01:04.250]  fact check me. And that's just an apple. I mean, there's plenty of other studies showing,
[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:10.090]  you know, just how poor the food quality is. And even in some organic farm situations.
[02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:17.370]  But if they start applying IMO fours or IMO three liquids into their system, now those fungi are
[02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:23.370]  going to pull those nutrients that are not in that fruit or vegetable right now. And therefore,
[02:01:23.370 --> 02:01:28.570]  we're going to be consuming a healthier product. We're going to have less health issues ourself.
[02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:32.490]  And we're going to have less impact on the planet. And we're going to be cleaning the water
[02:01:32.490 --> 02:01:36.890]  because nobody talks about the water cycle. You take rainwater and you throw it through a
[02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:42.890]  conventional ag system. And you're just you're polluted, dirty water. If you pour a cup of
[02:01:43.770 --> 02:01:49.530]  100 mils through pure organic soil, the little bit of water that comes out is crystal clear.
[02:01:49.530 --> 02:01:54.490]  And if any of you doubt me, there's a documentary called The Symphony of the Soil. I highly
[02:01:54.490 --> 02:01:59.130]  recommend it to everybody that they watch it. It's an hour and 20 minutes of your life, 15 bucks
[02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:03.770]  out of your pocket. But you're going to learn so much about the things that we're talking about
[02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:08.890]  here on this platform and a lot of the other platforms that I work on. It's like, how do we
[02:02:08.890 --> 02:02:16.010]  get to the next step? And so highly worth the short money and the time will be well spent. And
[02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:21.130]  I guarantee you'll watch it again because it's that interesting. So just quickly, Wendy,
[02:02:21.930 --> 02:02:27.050]  City Soul Shine Growing has been patiently waiting with a question about certification.
[02:02:29.130 --> 02:02:34.730]  Can you talk about, I mean, because obviously there's some things that just price people out
[02:02:34.730 --> 02:02:42.570]  of the market, right? Yeah. Yeah. So and this comes up quite a lot because we do talk about,
[02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:52.490]  you know, there is some amount of hurt feelings, if you will, about people that are like, well,
[02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:59.610]  you know, I have to get certified, quote unquote. And it's not really true. I mean, I spend a lot
[02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:05.610]  of time, you guys. I'm on Facebook a lot on a few groups that I moderate and on the KNF group,
[02:03:05.610 --> 02:03:10.490]  which I'm not as active in anymore because I feel like I've answered most of the questions that come
[02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:16.330]  up multiple times. There's a wonderful search function. All y'all get on a group and up in the
[02:03:16.330 --> 02:03:22.170]  corner, there's a little like looks like a little magnifying glass. Click on that and it'll search
[02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:28.490]  in the group itself and you can search for your questions. So if you want to know about how to
[02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:33.450]  make FPGA, you can click on that little thing and search it. And I guarantee you the answer has been
[02:03:33.450 --> 02:03:40.090]  given already for the most part. That being said, I do spend quite a bit of time answering questions
[02:03:40.170 --> 02:03:48.330]  for people when we're talking about quote unquote certified. So Master Cho does have chose global
[02:03:48.330 --> 02:03:54.250]  natural farming. Their headquarters are in Hawaii. They do offer classes and they do give people
[02:03:54.250 --> 02:04:00.570]  certifications. It's interesting because Korea and a lot of Asian countries are really big on
[02:04:01.130 --> 02:04:06.650]  certifications. They're really big, not on like I when I went to South Korea, I left there with
[02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:13.930]  a piece of paper from Dr. Kim that says, you know, Wendy has been certified with this week-long
[02:04:13.930 --> 02:04:19.690]  training in GCM, which we're not going to get into here. We can maybe talk about that some other
[02:04:19.690 --> 02:04:26.650]  time. But I think that is a bit of a cultural thing that has transitioned through is that there
[02:04:26.650 --> 02:04:34.170]  are people who have been certified by Master Cho, trained from him specifically, and have come
[02:04:34.170 --> 02:04:41.530]  through basically showing that they know their shit. Okay. It's not necessary. You don't need to
[02:04:41.530 --> 02:04:47.130]  get certified. You don't have to go to a class. Yes, you can learn a lot of this online nowadays.
[02:04:47.690 --> 02:04:53.370]  However, when we're talking about Korean natural farming specifically, we are talking about those
[02:04:53.370 --> 02:05:00.810]  nuances. We are talking about little tiny tweaks that do make a huge difference. And so if you're
[02:05:00.810 --> 02:05:04.810]  going online and you're learning from somebody who's like, I mean, I'm not kidding. I went to
[02:05:04.810 --> 02:05:09.770]  class a couple years ago and or last year, maybe the year before, I can't remember. But there were
[02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:13.930]  people that are like, I've been doing this for six years. And you'd watch them. And by the time
[02:05:13.930 --> 02:05:19.370]  they left, they were like, holy crap, I've been doing this not quite right for six years. And you
[02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:24.090]  watch over the course of time as they start implementing those little tiny nuances, what type
[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:31.290]  of rice, how to collect it correctly, where to go to collect it. You know, just subtle, subtle
[02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:36.570]  shifts where all of a sudden they're like, whoa, it was working well before, but now, holy cow,
[02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:42.890]  mind blowing the difference that those two or three little things make. So when you're going
[02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:47.210]  online and you're talking to people just because they say they've been doing this for a really long
[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:54.010]  time, if they have not gone to a hands on intensive class from somebody who learned from Master Cho,
[02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:59.770]  or who has learned from somebody who learned from Master Cho and has been implementing it for years,
[02:06:00.650 --> 02:06:06.090]  there is a high likelihood that you are going to miss those nuances. And it's not going to
[02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:12.730]  be bad necessarily, but it's not going to be exactly right. And that exactly right, is the
[02:06:12.730 --> 02:06:20.890]  difference of hundreds of hours of learning curve. And I kid you not, it is crazy. And I do want to
[02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:25.690]  talk about cinnamon real quick, because I did see something pop up on chat about cinnamon's expensive.
[02:06:25.690 --> 02:06:32.010]  Angelica is actually really expensive. Also, here's the thing with OHN, cinnamon, angelica,
[02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:37.930]  and licorice root are the three dry herbs we use in OHN. You don't have to use them all you guys.
[02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:42.970]  This is the thing. You can't afford cinnamon, leave it out. You don't need it. You don't have
[02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:48.970]  to have all five of those herbs. That is the best. So like Leighton was saying, that is the ideal
[02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:54.650]  thing is using all five of those herbs. But if you don't have one of them, just leave it out and
[02:06:54.650 --> 02:06:59.210]  use four. If you don't have two of them, leave it out and use three. If all you've got is garlic,
[02:06:59.210 --> 02:07:03.610]  go ahead and make a garlic tincture. It's going to be helpful. It's going to be good. It won't be
[02:07:03.610 --> 02:07:11.930]  as good as the full OHN, but it still is good. And yeah, again, just to nail home that whole
[02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:18.010]  certification, because people get really uppity about like, well, who are you to say that you're
[02:07:18.010 --> 02:07:25.210]  trained and certified? I'm not. I'm not saying I'm the best person to teach you. I'm not saying
[02:07:25.210 --> 02:07:29.690]  that there's nobody else out there that you can learn from. I'm not even saying that you have to
[02:07:29.690 --> 02:07:36.890]  learn from somebody who has been verified and vetted as somebody who is a good educator.
[02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:40.970]  You can learn from anybody. And again, a step in the right direction is a step in the right
[02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:45.290]  direction. And if you want to learn from your brother, Joe, who thinks he's been doing it right
[02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:50.730]  for six years or 10 years or 20 years, but he didn't actually get trained, go learn from him.
[02:07:50.730 --> 02:07:57.210]  There's nothing wrong with it. That's rad. That's awesome. When somebody who has been through this
[02:07:57.210 --> 02:08:05.770]  training and has been, you know, taught, has learned with somebody who was taught from Master
[02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:11.450]  Cho or who has learned from Master Cho directly, when they come on and they start to tell you that
[02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:17.530]  actually the way that you're doing things isn't quite correct, just set aside your ego. Just
[02:08:17.530 --> 02:08:22.330]  listen to what they have to say. Take it with a grain of salt, if you will, and make your own
[02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:28.410]  decisions about whether you want to follow that or not. But the amount of arguing that goes on
[02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:35.690]  online about these nuances and about these things, like, really, it's a little disheartening because
[02:08:35.690 --> 02:08:40.570]  it doesn't need to be argued over. We don't need to argue about whether people are certified and
[02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:45.050]  trained or not. You get to make those decisions on your own. You get to listen to who you want
[02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:54.090]  to listen to. And putting some validation into whether or not somebody has a certification or
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:58.970]  not, like, that's not really what it's about. Listen to them. Look at their progress. Look at
[02:08:58.970 --> 02:09:03.450]  what they're doing and decide if they seem to know what the hell they're doing. And if they do,
[02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:07.290]  fucking follow their advice, for God's sakes. Don't argue about it.
[02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:16.170]  I think certification is just kind of one tool in evaluating. I mean, the areas where I see
[02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:21.450]  certification being something that someone would give credence to would be like, I'm about to hire
[02:09:21.450 --> 02:09:27.850]  someone to come on to my KNF oriented commercial farm. It's nice to know that they got that
[02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:33.210]  certification versus just saying, like, I, you know, I know, KNF, and I've learned it all on
[02:09:33.210 --> 02:09:37.450]  my own. If you're just doing it in your own garden, fine, great. Like, you don't need a
[02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:42.570]  certification. Or if you want to be a consultant and teach other people KNF, if I'm going to come
[02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:48.250]  to you to be like, so where'd you learn it? And it's like, I learned it from Instagram and YouTube.
[02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:55.290]  And I think this gets to the next. So someone asked, can someone explain why soil scientists
[02:09:55.290 --> 02:10:00.570]  that are also very organically oriented say KNF is not working? And can I just take the first?
[02:10:01.530 --> 02:10:06.570]  I know you got it. But I want to just try to bridge gap because I feel like there's so many
[02:10:06.570 --> 02:10:13.690]  people who agree on 98% of things. And the gulf between them, I don't think is so big. And what I
[02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:20.330]  see here is what Wendy said early on was that when she was first learning KNF, she made a lot of
[02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:25.850]  mistakes. You know, you were very open about making mistakes. And I think a lot of the soil
[02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:33.130]  scientists go into commercial grows, and they see things going wrong. And it's someone who's
[02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:40.890]  not trained in the same way that Wendy is, who makes a mistake with a KNF practice. And it's
[02:10:40.890 --> 02:10:49.770]  almost like KNF gone bad. Whereas someone who does KNF properly, they'd probably be like,
[02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:54.170]  you know, I mean, what Wendy's farm, you know, proof is in the pudding, you know, it's not a
[02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.650]  farm that's had a crop collapse or anything like that. So anyway, you guys take it. But that's my
[02:10:59.290 --> 02:11:01.050]  two cents setting up that question.
[02:11:02.730 --> 02:11:07.690]  Wendy, I'm gonna jump in on this one first, and then we'll hit you back. So first of all,
[02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:14.490]  soil science, soil scientists will tell you, biology in the soil doesn't matter.
[02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:23.690]  They have all been trained through college education, they have PhDs, they have degrees,
[02:11:23.770 --> 02:11:30.570]  and they've all gone through NPK college. Big Ag has controlled all college learning
[02:11:31.130 --> 02:11:37.450]  since fertilizer days, since the earliest beginnings. So any soil scientist that you speak
[02:11:37.450 --> 02:11:45.370]  to who's got a degree, will adamantly defend his degree and say, all you need is NPK. They disagree
[02:11:45.370 --> 02:11:51.370]  that there is any value in biology whatsoever. So that's why the soil science community will say,
[02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:56.410]  you don't need NF, all you need is NPK. So there's a big difference between that.
[02:11:56.410 --> 02:12:03.130]  Now, I think what maybe you were hinting to Peter is consultants who will come into a grow
[02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:09.610]  and look at the soil and say, what's going on? Oh, I use a lot of K and F inputs. And I've heard
[02:12:09.610 --> 02:12:16.090]  this time and time again, this is back to that moron. If they're putting more on instead of less
[02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:20.490]  on and waiting for a reaction, then they're gonna have a crash, they're gonna have issues, they're
[02:12:20.490 --> 02:12:24.410]  gonna have crop loss, they're gonna have pest pressure, they're gonna have anaerobic soil
[02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:30.490]  conditions, they're gonna have poor plant reaction. So I think there's two different schools or two
[02:12:30.490 --> 02:12:35.130]  different camps here, kind of like there is with the Protestants and the Catholics. And so you just,
[02:12:35.130 --> 02:12:40.810]  I wanted to make sure we clarify that, that traditional educated soil scientists will solve,
[02:12:40.810 --> 02:12:49.050]  biology has no value, it's all about NPK. And the consultants that go in and poo-poo K and F
[02:12:49.050 --> 02:12:54.250]  are generally because they're there to clean up a mess. So somebody made a mistake. And again,
[02:12:54.250 --> 02:12:59.290]  I don't call them mistakes, I call them lessons. Somebody's learning a really hard lesson
[02:12:59.290 --> 02:13:05.770]  about what to do and what not to do. And now they've got to clean up their mess. And of course,
[02:13:05.770 --> 02:13:11.210]  these soil scientists or soil consultants will come in and say, this is a shit show,
[02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:15.690]  it's a disaster. We got to start all over again. I don't know how I can clean this up,
[02:13:15.690 --> 02:13:20.490]  or we're gonna have to spend a lot more money to clean this up. And that's where I think the
[02:13:20.490 --> 02:13:27.290]  real disconnect happens. But, and to hit on your certification, I agree, Peter, I think there is a
[02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:33.290]  need for certification. But I also agree with Wendy, that if you're having good plant reaction,
[02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:38.410]  if you're having good results, and you're not learning lessons, lessons after lessons,
[02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:45.130]  then you should be okay to share the information. But again, share responsibly, make sure you're
[02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:50.810]  explaining the whole thing and not leave out some of the most important parts like IMO. I mean,
[02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:57.050]  IMO is the foundation of KNF or natural farming. So if you're not all about, if you're not all
[02:13:57.050 --> 02:14:03.370]  about IMO, you missed the whole point. If you don't have a diverse, healthy soil biology,
[02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:08.330]  all of the sprays, all of the preparations, anything you can throw at it is not going to
[02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:13.130]  give you the right reaction. So you have to start by building a foundation. If you don't have a
[02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:18.330]  foundation, and you try to build a three story house on sand, guess what's going to happen?
[02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:23.930]  You're going to have problems, things are going to crack, settle, etc, etc, etc. So anyway, that's
[02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:33.770]  my rant. Wendy, what do you got? Yeah, I 100% all of that. You know, again, the places where
[02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:41.850]  people are going in and saying, well, KNF is not working, I can pretty much guarantee it's because
[02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:48.570]  the person is not trained in KNF. This isn't a simple, this isn't like, you know, you can read
[02:14:48.570 --> 02:14:54.810]  Mother Earth news and get all the logistics of exactly how to do it. This is beyond organic
[02:14:54.810 --> 02:15:00.810]  cultivation. This is a system. It's a methodology. You cannot piecemeal this out. You cannot say,
[02:15:01.450 --> 02:15:07.850]  I made FPJ and sprayed it all over everything and oh my god, it didn't work. That's because
[02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:12.890]  you didn't use it right. It's there's there's five principles of natural farming. Okay, and there's
[02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:19.690]  three rights of natural farming, the right input, the right time and the right dose. As for the five
[02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:24.330]  principles, like one of them is use what you've got, because I want to tap back into that real
[02:15:24.330 --> 02:15:29.290]  fast in that cinnamon thing, right? If you don't have cinnamon, don't use it. So using what you've
[02:15:29.290 --> 02:15:36.570]  got using it correctly. These are all key to getting the system to work right. So you know,
[02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:43.130]  I can I know people that use neem meal, they love it, they use it appropriately. I personally
[02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:49.130]  don't like it. But you know, that's that's a personal choice. I also know people that are
[02:15:49.130 --> 02:15:56.490]  scientists that say neem meal absolutely destroys all of your soil biology. Well, it doesn't actually
[02:15:56.490 --> 02:16:00.570]  absolutely destroy your soil biology again, if you're using it appropriately. Now, if you're
[02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:06.410]  putting neem meal in at the rate of, you know, hundreds of pounds per acre, yeah, probably not
[02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:13.450]  a good idea. That thing, that stuff is pesticidal for a reason. So if you are literally poisoning
[02:16:13.450 --> 02:16:17.370]  your soil with whatever it might be, it doesn't matter if it's organic or not. If you're not using
[02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:22.490]  it appropriately, it doesn't work right. Same thing with KNF. If you don't use natural farming
[02:16:22.490 --> 02:16:27.210]  appropriately, it doesn't work right. There was a study done by the University of Hawaii way back
[02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:34.810]  in the day, where they proved quote unquote, that IMO doesn't work. And but they but they had no
[02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:41.370]  training and how to do a proper IMO collection. So, you know, science is is wonderful. And I love
[02:16:41.370 --> 02:16:48.890]  it. I'm a huge science nerd. I, I think it's fantastic. However, just like any data source,
[02:16:48.890 --> 02:16:54.810]  you can skew that to get the results that you want. So if you don't come from a scientific
[02:16:54.810 --> 02:16:58.890]  methodology principle where you are limiting your variables, there was there's something going on
[02:16:58.890 --> 02:17:05.130]  right now with water soluble calcium, where somebody was, I'm not going to out them, I'm not
[02:17:05.130 --> 02:17:09.130]  going to say who they are, but they were testing water soluble calcium WCA, it's made with vinegar
[02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:14.650]  and eggshells. And they were like, the calcium levels are all across the board. So how can you
[02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:20.090]  say that you need to use this at a one to 1000 ratio, always when it doesn't have the same levels
[02:17:20.090 --> 02:17:27.290]  of calcium in it? And my question instantly is, well, are you taking water soluble calcium that
[02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:31.930]  is made by five different people? And have they been trained and how to make that appropriately?
[02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:38.010]  Because if they haven't been, then, you know, there's no real, you've got too many variables
[02:17:38.010 --> 02:17:42.970]  involved in that. And what kind of eggs were they like somebody was like, the part of this thing
[02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:51.530]  also was supposedly the calcium levels in store bought eggs was lower with the WCA, the water
[02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:57.770]  soluble calcium solution was a lower calcium level with store bought eggs, which doesn't really
[02:17:57.770 --> 02:18:03.370]  make scientific sense. And to me, that gets me down into like, well, that person used store bought
[02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:08.330]  eggs, that person used eggs from their farm, that person used eggs from a farmer's market.
[02:18:09.210 --> 02:18:14.490]  If you really want to actually look at those inputs, you need to have one person make all
[02:18:14.490 --> 02:18:20.090]  the inputs with the only variable being that eggshell, where did that egg come from? So,
[02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:26.010]  again, when we're, when we're getting into this whole idea of soil science and natural farming,
[02:18:26.010 --> 02:18:31.930]  and people testing different things, like there's generally too many variables going on. So,
[02:18:32.970 --> 02:18:40.570]  you know, when it doesn't work, well, who's, who's, who is doing it that it's not working? Why?
[02:18:40.650 --> 02:18:45.850]  You know, if you come into the farms of the people that have gone through these intensive classes,
[02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:52.090]  and have been practicing this for years, pretty much guaranteed, it's working really, really well.
[02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:56.650]  If you go into a farm with somebody who's been dinking around online and figuring things out
[02:18:56.650 --> 02:19:03.690]  on their own, yeah, probably less. Or there's, you know, less probability that it's working
[02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:07.690]  really well for those people, because they haven't gotten those nuances, they're not using it
[02:19:07.690 --> 02:19:11.450]  appropriately, they don't have IMO, they didn't build that soil foundation that Leighton was
[02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:18.490]  mentioning. And they're just using FPJ and water and thinking that they're doing natural farming.
[02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:24.890]  And it's just, it's just a flawed concept from the get go. That being said, you know, I don't
[02:19:24.890 --> 02:19:28.250]  actually know who these soil scientists are. I don't know where they're going. I don't know what
[02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:32.890]  they're testing. I don't know what they're looking at. So maybe I'm way off on this. But I do know
[02:19:32.890 --> 02:19:37.130]  that those of us that have been doing this for years and have been trained appropriately,
[02:19:37.210 --> 02:19:44.810]  are pretty much crushing it across the board. And that goes for peppers. My friend Kobe is in
[02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:50.730]  Sacramento, killing it with his pepper game out there and his farm. You know, cannabis, there's a
[02:19:50.730 --> 02:19:54.970]  few of us here in Humboldt that have been doing this for years now, absolutely crushing the game.
[02:19:56.170 --> 02:20:04.650]  You know, there's a wonderful man named Aaron who took class this year, and he did his hash. And he
[02:20:04.650 --> 02:20:10.170]  went from what he was standard get standardly getting, which was a 4% return, started implementing
[02:20:10.170 --> 02:20:18.570]  IMO and got 6%. Like for those of us mathy people, that's a 50% increase from 4%, plus
[02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:23.690]  half of that, right? 150%. Okay, so I'm not a mathy person. I'm a science person.
[02:20:25.930 --> 02:20:32.410]  But, excuse me. But basically, the point there is like, when you start implementing this correctly,
[02:20:32.410 --> 02:20:38.330]  you see those returns really, really quickly. And I would challenge any of those soil scientists
[02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:42.970]  that are saying that KNF is not working to come out to a farm that has been implementing it
[02:20:42.970 --> 02:20:47.130]  correctly, and prove it that it's not working. Guarantee it's working.
[02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:56.570]  Hey, just wanted to back that up. And I think the key is you're right. If it is properly
[02:20:56.570 --> 02:21:02.570]  implemented, yes, you're going to see returns. And again, how can you not afford to do it,
[02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:08.090]  if you're going to get a 50% increase, if you learn it and learn the nuances. So don't just
[02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:14.330]  expect to pull this off the internet and be an instant expert. You can't. You need to do proper
[02:21:14.330 --> 02:21:20.810]  training, you need to spend the time reading and learning these nuances and start with IMO. That's
[02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:25.770]  the key to this whole thing. Oh, and a shout out to Kevin Jodrey. Thanks for being there, brother.
[02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:34.570]  Miss you, man. So I think the lesson of the day is that there isn't two camps. There is no,
[02:21:34.570 --> 02:21:41.770]  and believe it or not, Chris Trump and I did a session on a convention specifically about what
[02:21:41.770 --> 02:21:47.130]  is the difference between SoilFed, FoodWeb, and KNF. There isn't. There isn't a difference between
[02:21:47.130 --> 02:21:52.250]  biodynamics. They're all the same thing. They're just practiced slightly different, kind of like
[02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:56.810]  Catholics and Protestants. One is about the Bible, the other is about the ritual.
[02:21:57.370 --> 02:22:02.010]  But again, if you're focusing, if you're keeping an open mind and focusing on all these things,
[02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:08.490]  then you're going to learn by default. And again, you're going to make, perhaps have some lessons
[02:22:08.490 --> 02:22:13.210]  that you learn along the way. And as long as you're paying attention and not repeating those
[02:22:13.210 --> 02:22:18.890]  lessons over and over again, you're going to go in the right direction. You're going to gain
[02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:28.090]  at least an increase in potency, yield, or overall health of the soil system around you. And again,
[02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:34.570]  part of this is that we didn't hit on is the polyculture side of this, is diverse microbes,
[02:22:34.570 --> 02:22:40.090]  but yeah, diverse plants with your cannabis plant. And I think that's another piece that we really
[02:22:40.090 --> 02:22:46.330]  didn't hit on much, but unfortunately we are getting up there in the hours. So I don't know
[02:22:46.330 --> 02:22:50.970]  if we want to go down that rabbit hole. And one other thing, just to clarify, yeah, I was talking
[02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:56.650]  about ag schools. Finally, colleges and Ivy League schools are coming out and saying, hey,
[02:22:57.370 --> 02:23:03.530]  there is a connection to soil chemistry, soil physical structure, and biology. But this is
[02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:09.450]  relatively new. This is in the last 10 years. Prior to that, anybody that went through ag school
[02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:14.730]  was only taught MPK and told that biology did not matter in the soil system. So I just wanted
[02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:19.450]  to clarify that. Didn't want to offend anybody. That's not what I'm here about. I'm here to share
[02:23:19.450 --> 02:23:26.090]  the love and talk on things that I understand and know and have been exposed to. So Wendy,
[02:23:26.090 --> 02:23:30.090]  you want to throw anything else on top of that? Yeah.
[02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:34.090]  And I was just going to say, we could keep on going because I'm just packing seeds here
[02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:39.290]  listening. So I'm killing two birds with one stone. All right. Go for it, Wendy.
[02:23:40.250 --> 02:23:45.690]  Yeah. Well, and I have to get my kids back on their Zoom for the day for homeschooling. So I
[02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:52.490]  do have to tap out. But I want to thank everybody for tuning in today. I do feel very, very
[02:23:52.490 --> 02:24:00.650]  passionately about what I do and how we do it and how that impacts the planet. And so for people
[02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:05.770]  that have questions, you can reach me on Instagram. I tend to be on there frequently with private
[02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:12.330]  messenger. You can always message me and ask me things. Again, I highly encourage if you're
[02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:18.170]  starting to go down K&F and you're really interested in it, go ahead and join some
[02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:25.050]  Facebook groups. There's a K&F group. We also, I'm a moderator for Organic Cultivators, which
[02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:32.330]  is a rad group. We've got a kicking group of moderators in there who are incredibly smart
[02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:37.930]  and can answer all kinds of questions. So if you don't want to go down K&F, you don't want to go
[02:24:37.930 --> 02:24:41.690]  down JDOM, but you want to start growing organically, it's a great resource to tap into.
[02:24:42.330 --> 02:24:49.210]  And again, use that search function first, because mostly your questions have been answered.
[02:24:49.210 --> 02:24:54.730]  If you have more specific questions or you want things dialed in, it's a great thing to get that
[02:24:54.730 --> 02:25:00.970]  base of knowledge and then be able to ask more specifically about different things. We get pretty
[02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:10.330]  heady in there sometimes with the science stuff. So join us on there, Instagram if you want. Again,
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:18.730]  I do tend to respond to private messages. Time is sometimes a little tight. So if I don't get back to
[02:25:18.730 --> 02:25:26.410]  you right away, I apologize. And I want to just end by saying that please go grow something.
[02:25:26.410 --> 02:25:33.370]  I don't care if it's weed. I don't care if it's time. If you have a window in your house,
[02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:38.490]  you can grow something. And there is really something that will change in your life when you
[02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:45.690]  cultivate a plant. And I am notorious for killing houseplants until recently. Like the last few
[02:25:45.690 --> 02:25:51.210]  years, I finally got an angel wing begonia is what changed it for me. I was able to keep that alive.
[02:25:51.210 --> 02:25:57.370]  And all of a sudden, I can grow some pretty good houseplants now. But I can cultivate the heck
[02:25:57.370 --> 02:26:03.450]  outside. So if you can get outside and grow something, do that. If you have to grow inside,
[02:26:03.450 --> 02:26:09.530]  do that. But get your fingers in the soil. Go grow something. It's awesome. Love you guys so much.
[02:26:11.130 --> 02:26:18.970]  Just quickly, I have one quick question before you go. And that's in Chris Trump's WCA video.
[02:26:19.610 --> 02:26:25.450]  He talks about kind of after you toast the eggshells, he wants to get rid of the little
[02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:31.290]  bit of membrane that's you know, from the inside of the eggshell. If I'm too lazy to do that,
[02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:38.090]  is there any huge downside to having that in the because I did do that. And it's like, what's the
[02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:43.930]  downside to having a tiny bit of that in the vinegar while it goes through the process?
[02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:50.970]  It stinks. It smells real bad real fast. So that protein that membrane is a protein.
[02:26:50.970 --> 02:26:56.090]  And as it starts to degrade, not yet, like not necessarily right now. But and I did this,
[02:26:56.090 --> 02:27:01.210]  I think my first WCA, I was a little lazy with it. And it wasn't the membrane,
[02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:06.010]  I got most of that off. But there was some actual egg white that kind of turned into
[02:27:07.850 --> 02:27:12.730]  glass. Basically, it like turns into this really clear kind of looks like shatter, actually.
[02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:21.450]  Looks like a BHO shatter. And I did. And after about, yeah, so after about three months,
[02:27:21.450 --> 02:27:29.450]  it smelled so bad. There's nothing wrong with using it, it still functions appropriately,
[02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:36.570]  it just reeks. It's disgusting. So you're you're fine to use it. It's just being a little more
[02:27:36.570 --> 02:27:44.090]  meticulous is going to be a little less noxious down the line. So now I have a bucket for my
[02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:51.050]  eggshells that I literally rinse them out after I crack them. And then when I winnow the membranes,
[02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:55.610]  they all come off really easily. And it's a better process. And if I don't want to rinse
[02:27:55.610 --> 02:28:01.290]  my eggshells, then I put it in my actual compost bucket and toss it out. So highly recommend rinse
[02:28:01.290 --> 02:28:07.610]  your eggshells for WCA. And then the diluted, you know, you put a tiny bit into water and it's
[02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:12.170]  it's only a full year spray, correct? Like what would be the downside to putting a little bit in
[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:20.010]  this? Okay, so you can put no downside, you can use this. That is one of the Yeah, that's one of
[02:28:20.010 --> 02:28:29.290]  the things is that that kind of gets missed quite a bit is at some point, this got turned into an
[02:28:29.290 --> 02:28:36.330]  idea that it is only that natural farming is only on foliar. And that is not correct. It's the same
[02:28:36.330 --> 02:28:42.330]  ratios, it's still one to 1000. And you can use it as a soil drench. It's absolutely no problem
[02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:48.410]  with any of these inputs you being used as a soil drench, as well as a foliar. The difference is
[02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:54.810]  that if I am trying to do a soil drench, I'm using hundreds of gallons. And if I'm doing a foliar,
[02:28:54.810 --> 02:29:01.130]  I'm using 10 to 20 gallons. So it's just a matter of, again, coming back to those
[02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:07.610]  profit margins and where we're spending our money and our time. I don't want to have to make
[02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:13.850]  1000s of gallons of FPGA every year. I am just not. I don't know that that's a lot of work. I
[02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:19.850]  don't want to do that. So I will use foliar as much as I possibly can, because I'm using so much
[02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:25.050]  less of those inputs. And again, when we're talking about like OHN and some of these more
[02:29:25.050 --> 02:29:31.290]  expensive inputs to make, I don't want to have to spend that kind of money. I really want to
[02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:37.290]  pinch those margins in as much as I possibly can. So instead of making and utilizing hundreds of
[02:29:37.290 --> 02:29:43.770]  gallons of OHN every year, I can make and utilize 10 or 20. And again, there's nothing wrong with
[02:29:43.770 --> 02:29:48.810]  using it as a soil drench, it's just more cost effective to use it as a foliar for as long as
[02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:54.890]  you possibly can. All right. Well, Wendy, we'll let you go with one last birthday wish from
[02:29:54.890 --> 02:30:03.210]  Brittany. And I'm sure everybody in the chat. So have a happy birthday with the kids at home.
[02:30:03.210 --> 02:30:11.290]  Not such a bad birthday. Thank you for your time, Wendy. We really appreciate you.
[02:30:12.090 --> 02:30:14.970]  Thanks, Wendy. Much love, girl. We'll talk soon, I'm sure.
[02:30:15.930 --> 02:30:22.320]  All right. Thank you guys. Sending you all so much love and blessings. And yeah,
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:26.160]  have a great day out there, everybody. Happy birthday.
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:31.120]  Hey, Kev, if you're still out there, I'm still going to come bugging you to come on the show.
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:34.320]  All right, brother? We'd love to talk about the customer experience.
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:41.360]  I think he just got back to work. But anyway, all right. So, Leighton,
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:46.320]  while we have, should we see if anyone has questions?
[02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:47.620]  Sure.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:52.560]  And as I said, since I got to pack the seeds anyway, I'm either listening to music or listening
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:53.520]  to you guys. So.
[02:30:54.960 --> 02:31:00.240]  I feel like for most of the viewers out there, you know that Wendy is a G when Kevin comes on
[02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:04.400]  and he's talking about that he's a student for the day. So shout out to Wendy.
[02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:05.760]  That wasn't for us.
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:06.260]  Big time.
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:12.400]  I'm sure he's learning a lot from me and I'm standing calm over here today.
[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:14.400]  I'm trying to relax.
[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:21.680]  But that's the real beauty of that learning from Wendy is minimizing the learning curve
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:28.400]  and the amount of time it takes to learn based just mostly on their own experience.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:31.040]  If you ride with that, you're able to trust the process more.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:33.520]  You're going to be more successful.
[02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:39.200]  So Leighton, I think must have moved in his house. Leighton, can you hear us?
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.360]  I can. Can you hear me?
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:45.120]  Yeah, I can hear you, but you're frozen. All right. As long as we can hear you.
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:47.760]  You want to take a question?
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.360]  Sure. Fire away.
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:54.240]  So John, I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:55.920]  Sure. Fire away.
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:05.600]  So John said, late and serious question. When did you first figure out your horizon system?
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:14.400]  I was doing work with Rodale back on engineered soil systems and how to get them to...
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:20.160]  So, all right. An engineered soil system is 90% sand, 10% organic matter.
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:24.240]  And in these systems, they're usually sports fields, golf courses.
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:29.040]  So they're applying a lot of nitrogen on a regular basis.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:34.960]  And there's a trade-off. In order for the microbes to break the nitrogen down and make it plant
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:39.680]  available, they either need water or they need carbon. So in this particular case,
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:43.920]  they were using nitrogen-based fertilizer and that requires carbon.
[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:47.920]  So carbon is your soil organic matter. So when I was involved in the project,
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:54.720]  there was less than 1% soil organic matter left and the system was failing. So they brought me in
[02:32:54.720 --> 02:33:02.880]  to figure out how to get advanced protozoa and fungi to take hold in sand. So the reason I was
[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:07.760]  invited in was because I'd done a lot of work with a product called Harmonize, which is in part of my
[02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:13.920]  suite of products, and how well it works in bonding sand particles together to make microaggregates
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:21.440]  very quickly. So as a result of the work that I did there, I was treating monster park renovations
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:26.320]  and projects all over the country. And then I was brought in on a couple of high-end landscape
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:32.640]  projects where they were developing on sensitive watersheds and they did not want any synthetic
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:38.400]  products to be used. And now I was dealing with landscape architects who were playing with
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:43.840]  different plant successions. So they wanted to plant a swamp maple and then surround it with
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:49.440]  boxwoods that don't want to have their roots wet or their feet wet. So the swamp maple wants to be
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:54.480]  living in an anaerobic environment and the boxwoods want to live in a whole completely different
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:34:01.920]  aerobic environment. So I had to do a lot of soil engineering to get this system, these crazy
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:07.680]  architects, wanted to work. So that's how I started playing with, you know, some of them had as many
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:16.400]  as 27 different mixes. So I was mixing B horizon, A horizon, O horizon, some E horizons, all on the
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:20.000]  same project to get all these plants to work together and live comfortably even though they
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:25.280]  were from completely different environments and different successions. So that's where I got the
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:32.080]  experience in engineering soil. And then when I got involved with the regenerative cannabis
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:39.120]  conference, the first thing I did was say, hey, you know, you guys are all in potting soil. You
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.640]  know, that works great for nutrients. So for bottled nudes, that's a perfect system. But if you want to
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:50.560]  go to a living soil system, you need sand, silt and clay. You need these other components that the
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:58.160]  biology require for them to survive and take hold. And so I introduced the basic soil system, soil
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:02.480]  horizon system, which is, you know, that's invented by nature. I didn't do it. I just, you know,
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:07.680]  presented it to the cannabis community. And those that have actually gone down that rabbit hole and
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:13.280]  use this system have come back with, you know, glory remarks saying how well it works, how easy
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:21.840]  it is to water. I don't have the hydrophobic anaerobic issues. It mitigates unnecessary or
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:28.080]  over or underwater issues. So it just makes the whole system a lot easier and user friendly.
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:29.600]  So I hope I answered that.
[02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:37.030]  Is that a cigarette?
[02:35:38.310 --> 02:35:40.790]  No, it's got a little goodies in it too.
[02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:43.030]  It's been a long day, dude. I've drained.
[02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:47.350]  Tell me about it. I woke up at 330 and I've been
[02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:53.510]  fucking sitting right here with my like, I mean, look at this. This is like a little tiny vial.
[02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:56.790]  I got to put the seeds in the back.
[02:35:56.790 --> 02:36:01.350]  I was watching you pack them in all nice with a little cotton swab so they don't get bad.
[02:36:01.350 --> 02:36:02.710]  Two and a half hours.
[02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:06.390]  Yeah, you're giving them love. Whoever's getting them seeds, they're getting some love, man.
[02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:12.630]  Nightmare. And I apologize to everybody who has not gotten your seeds yet from Black Friday, but
[02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:21.350]  nobody is more frustrated than me. So I'm getting this shit out the door and the.
[02:36:21.350 --> 02:36:27.350]  All right, I'm going to answer a couple of these questions. Do worms inoculate soil with nematodes?
[02:36:27.350 --> 02:36:30.230]  Absolutely not. Worms and nematodes are completely different.
[02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:33.990]  Will organic inorganic pH up or down kill my microbes?
[02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:40.150]  Any significant swing in pH will shut them down. You will lose diversity.
[02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:45.750]  So that means you're going to lose some of them and other ones will go to sleep or other ones will wake up
[02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:51.990]  depending on how you're swinging it. Anytime you're playing with pH, go really low and really slow and
[02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:55.590]  changing it. And please understand that I'm not going to be able to do that.
[02:36:56.150 --> 02:37:01.830]  And please understand the goal is to hit the range of anywhere between six, five and seven because the
[02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:09.670]  plant can still adjust the pH in the rhizosphere to grow out or shut down different bacteria from
[02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:15.590]  performing different tasks based on what the plant needs. So just get it close to range and then don't
[02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:18.870]  fuck with it. Now, if you're in a hydro system, that's a little bit different. You don't have
[02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:23.990]  organisms to worry about. Although I am playing with pH, I'm not going to be able to do that.
[02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:32.710]  Although I am playing with a couple of dudes that are trying to hybrid inorganic newts with biology,
[02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:39.110]  and it should be an interesting 2021 to see what happens with this gig. I'll keep you posted.
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:45.060]  Anything else out there?
[02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:48.820]  Uh, hold on.
[02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:52.820]  Hang on. My comments aren't flowing. Here we go.
[02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:03.780]  Can you flush with molasses? No. That was one of the big things that Scott Simey talks about is
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:09.140]  when he gets called into these grows and you know, the soil is just anaerobic. It's because
[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:14.980]  they over applied these FPJs and these other sugar based nutrients. So no, do not flush with
[02:38:14.980 --> 02:38:22.260]  molasses. Molasses is used for growing out bacteria so that you will end up growing out protozoa.
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:26.500]  But even then, if you use excess sugar, you're going to grow out the bacteria to the point they
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:30.980]  remove all the oxygen from the dissolved oxygen in the water column. And you're going to end up
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:39.460]  with an anaerobic, anaerobic T or crash. So molasses, just a tiny little bit, very responsible
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:46.100]  with it. How do you farm nematodes? The best way to farm nematodes is to make a really good
[02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:52.580]  biologically diverse and rich compost. And the way I suggest you make compost is you harvest
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:58.580]  greens off the property. You do not, you're not buy any. You can get a little bit of alfalfa meal
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:03.860]  or a little bit of a green, a third cut, second cut hay. But for the most part, you should be
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:09.380]  trimming all of your local plants, bushes, grass, as long as it's not being treated synthetically.
[02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:16.340]  You mix one third greens to two thirds browns. The browns you can source offsite, you know,
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:21.700]  go to a place to find some nice old chips, especially the punky ones that have the mycelium
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:26.500]  throughout them. That's a great way to get that diversity, the saprophytic fungi, as well as some
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:33.620]  of the yeast. And then you will find often that the nematodes will come. They're already present,
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:38.340]  especially if you're harvesting from areas that are not synthetically treated, you will get plenty
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:42.500]  of nematodes. And then that's just a matter of growing them out in a compost, a thermal based.
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:50.660]  Again, NF practices are critical in thermal based biological compost. If you go over 120 degrees,
[02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:57.060]  you are killing the diversity at an insane rate. I usually recommend going to 110, 115 max.
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:02.500]  And if I see the temperature get up to that point, then I'll flip the compost, add a little
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:06.500]  bit of water, put it back together, put the thermometer back in there and keep an eye on it.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:11.700]  Usually it'll take a day or two for it to bounce back. But as long as it doesn't get above 115,
[02:40:11.700 --> 02:40:16.580]  you'll see it slowly drop back down to about 80. You harvest that, throw it under the microscope,
[02:40:16.580 --> 02:40:25.270]  you're bound to see nematodes. What else we got here? I do flush with cow mag.
[02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:32.070]  I wouldn't, I don't know why you're flushing with cow mag. You should be flushing with water.
[02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:37.430]  And I think, you know, a quick lesson on flushing. I think the industry as a whole doesn't get this
[02:40:37.430 --> 02:40:43.830]  part, but the goal is to hit soil saturation. So you want to hit, you want to get that water,
[02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:49.270]  the soil so wet that if you pour a gallon of water in it, a gallon of water comes out.
[02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:55.350]  And as soon as you hit that point, where whatever you put in comes out, that's when you want to
[02:40:55.350 --> 02:41:00.550]  stop flushing and you want to let it dry out for two to three days. That would be a way to move
[02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:06.870]  salts or move undesirable minerals. If your potassium is too high, you have too much sulfur,
[02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:12.550]  salts are high. That's what the whole point of flushing is. But I would not flush with cow mag
[02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:19.590]  because you're going to throw those ratios off. All right, what else we got here? Man, it's going
[02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:26.710]  quick. Rapid fire. Yeah, this is what you're good at, Leighton. This is why I need a little smoke,
[02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:33.270]  man. Hey, I was reading an article that chess players when they're in their tournaments burn
[02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:36.550]  6,000 calories a day. Sitting there, right?
[02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:43.750]  So Peter, have you been losing weight, dude? Because you've been doing this all day, every
[02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:54.550]  day. I think live, live you burn more calories for sure. Sorry, I see someone sent me a-
[02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:55.510]  Shout out to Leighton.
[02:41:55.670 --> 02:42:04.710]  Verizon. Okay, I will. If I don't, just remind me. I'm relying on group memory of people to remind
[02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:20.470]  me of shit. But- Yeah, neurons and overdrive for shit sure. Salt, chump change, pinkies. I have a
[02:42:20.470 --> 02:42:27.270]  whole gallon of clear resin, untouched clear resin. I'm going to have to scroll back, I guess.
[02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:35.750]  Hey, didn't Dr. Elaine Ingham work with Harvard? Isn't that where some of that research came from?
[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:43.740]  I don't think she worked with Harvard. I know that James Satillo and I worked with Harvard.
[02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:53.500]  And Harvard was implemented a biological application or a biological treatment for
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:58.220]  certain parts of their campus. The way Harvard works is they're broken up into pods. I think
[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:03.020]  there's 13 pods and each one of these pods has a certain amount of buildings and a certain amount
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:08.780]  of land care, landscaping that they're required to treat. Well, this one pod was progressive
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:13.580]  and wanted to move away from synthetics because they were losing some of their old,
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:19.340]  I think they were maple trees. I may be wrong. They might've been oaks, but these trees were
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:28.060]  monsters. They were probably six feet, seven foot trunk size diameter, and they were losing a tree
[02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:35.980]  a year. And so one of the pods decided that they wanted to move away from these synthetic systems
[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:42.540]  that seemed to be killing these trees and push into a biological system. And I believe that
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:50.700]  maybe Elaine turned them on to James Satillo or maybe James Satillo brought Elaine in to talk to
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:57.820]  the pod directly. And that was about the same time as I got involved with him and was producing a lot
[02:43:57.820 --> 02:44:03.580]  of his products for transitioning these soils. Because the hardest part when you're using a GOT
[02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:11.180]  brewer is you're brewing out just the protozoa. So you throw the protozoa into an environment where
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:17.740]  you do not have enough soil organic matter and you therefore can't have a fungal relationship
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:24.380]  or a fungal F to B ratio. That's when I got dragged in because what happens with the harmonized,
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:30.140]  which is basically take, it's the same as hash making. That's what they call me,
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:38.620]  is a compost hash guy. So what I do is I take compost, I wash it, I agitate it, I strip it of
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:44.940]  its humic acid, folic acid, and all of the biology that's present in that compost. And then I screen
[02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:51.260]  it out. So in this particular application, I only screen to 120 micron and everything else I let go
[02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:56.780]  through into solution. That's the supercharged harmonized. And basically you can take this stuff,
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:45:03.580]  pour it on sand, and within two to three weeks you will begin to have micro and macro aggregates
[02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:09.420]  that you can actually see and therefore establish the biology necessary for some of these older
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:16.220]  successionary systems. So this leads into one of the questions that someone was asking,
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:23.100]  who I think said that they just got a microscope. And kind of like when you first look at stuff
[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:27.100]  under the microscope, you're like, there's lots of cool stuff and you have no idea what it is. I
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:35.740]  mean, like stock ciliates, I was like, that thing is so cool. I had no idea what it was called. Is
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:44.380]  it good? Is it bad? And so what are some of the first things you would teach or the easiest things
[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:50.460]  for someone to identify and then like, are they good or bad? Okay, that's a great question. And
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:56.220]  so when I teach microscope class, the first thing I say is, all right, you're looking for moving
[02:45:56.220 --> 02:46:02.540]  things first. So anything moving. So just keep scanning over your slide until you see something
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:09.820]  that's moving. Now you're starting to key in on what you're looking for. Specifically,
[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:15.660]  flagellates take a little bit more time. So you don't just like keep moving this slide. You just
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:20.700]  set on a certain spot and then just watch for a minute or two and see if you see anything moving.
[02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:27.260]  And if you don't, move it over one notch or we call one view and do the same thing. So you're
[02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:33.740]  looking for nematodes, you're looking for flagellates and naked amoebas. Next is you want
[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:40.540]  to look for what's called testatum. And actually taking a step back, what would be like a starting
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:51.660]  magnification? I always say on 400. So that would be 40x or the yellow eyepiece or the yellow lens
[02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:58.860]  on the bottom. 400 is going to give you what you really need to see. You can bump it up to 800 or
[02:46:58.860 --> 02:47:05.020]  600. But again, you know, now you're starting to look at bacteria, or you're trying to zoom in on
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:11.580]  a nematode to identify him based on his mouth or his gut. So generally speaking, just stick with
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:17.660]  the yellow, stick with the 40x or 400 power, whatever you want to call it. That's the best
[02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:24.460]  place to really learn. Yeah, you can zoom out to 100x or 10x. That'll give you a bigger view of
[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:30.380]  the whole slide. You'll often see nematodes under 10x, but you won't see flagellates. You have to
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:36.620]  be down to 400 to 600 to see the flagellates. And then, so after I get through moving, I start
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:44.060]  looking for non-modal organisms, and that would be testate amoeba. You can google that, and it's
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:50.140]  pretty, there's a ton of slides on the internet. Can someone type that word in the chat, and I'll
[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:58.540]  post it for everybody who doesn't know how to spell it? Testate, testate amoeba. T-E-S-T-A, I believe it is.
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:05.820]  Testate. So that's the second thing I look for. Then I start looking for fungal hyphae.
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:13.500]  So fungal hyphae would be anything from yellow to, actually I've seen pink. And that would be a tube.
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:20.460]  It would not be modal. So you would then look closely at that to see if there's what's called
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:27.180]  septum or septi, which are divide the cells. So you'd get like these little railroad cars that
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:33.260]  move along, and each one of those will be divided by this little septi. And inside the
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:39.500]  the tube or the hyphae between the two septis, you'll often find what we call the
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:45.340]  nucleus. It'll be a small little bacteria appearing thing that's living inside the tube.
[02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:52.780]  So that indicates what we call a good saprophytic fungi. There's a lot of debate in Elaine's camp
[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:59.740]  about clear fungi. A good friend of mine, Dr. Efren Chavez, who's been my guide or my mentor for
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:09.100]  many years now, he and I have had long conversations about, well, the morphology of fungi is that it
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:15.820]  takes seven to ten days for you to be able to identify what type it is. So in the initial
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:21.740]  growth phase, we call it childhood, you can't tell the difference between a pathogenic fungi
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:28.060]  and a good fungi. So my rule of thumb is when I'm looking at a slide and I see a blob or a cluster
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:35.660]  of clear hyphae, the first thing I do is I look at the slide as an overall. Do I have
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:41.580]  good saprophytes present? Do I have good protozoa, which are the flagellates and the amoebas?
[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:49.020]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani And just quickly, is this like right after you do your extract?
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:58.060]  Dr. Tom Bilella Uh, alright. So in microscopy, you're looking more often at soil because you're
[02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:03.420]  trying to identify how healthy the soil is. So in my extract, I already know that there's a
[02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:08.540]  tremendous amount of organisms. So when I'm doing an extract, I'm looking toward, alright,
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:15.660]  what is the level of organisms I want? How bad is the soil I'm treating? So I'll often do double,
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:20.540]  triple, quadruple washes, which means I use the same liquid over and over again,
[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:26.940]  while infusing it into new, fresh compost that has not been extracted. So by doing that, I can
[02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:33.100]  take that water and make it so powerful. It's insane. Like literally a couple applications and
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:35.260]  I'm done. I walk away from that. Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:39.260]  It would be like running coffee through the filter and then pouring it-
[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:40.140]  Dr. Tom Bilella And then using the coffee-
[02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:43.580]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani And then putting new coffee grounds in and then pouring it back in
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:45.820]  and then a third time and then a fourth. Okay. Dr. Tom Bilella
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:48.060]  Oh, yeah. You're gonna get high as a kite from that shit, man.
[02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:58.940]  Talk about jitters. So anyway, back to microscopy. So if I'm trying to identify a pathogenic fungi
[02:50:58.940 --> 02:51:06.780]  versus a youth, I look at the overall picture of the slide. Like do I have a nematode? Do I have
[02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:12.540]  a root-feeding nematode or do I have a bacterial or a fungal-feeding nematode? The way I look at
[02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:19.580]  nematodes is they're the T-Rex, okay? So if you have an advanced alpha predator present in your
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:27.180]  ecology, chances are you have everything underneath that to support that level of life. And so
[02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:31.980]  therefore, if I see a nematode, I'm like, oh, okay. We're in the right place. You know, now let me see
[02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:38.380]  what other things are present. You know, how balanced this system actually is. Am I seeing
[02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:45.660]  10 nematodes or am I just seeing one nematode? And so I use the good guys as a reference point
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:52.620]  to identify is this a pathogenic fungi or is this a good guy saprophyte or even, you know, a yeast.
[02:51:53.980 --> 02:52:00.380]  Yeast gets a bad name, but yeasts are critical, especially in early developmental soils. Without
[02:52:00.380 --> 02:52:06.540]  those yeasts, you can't break the ground to get those saprophytes to really have the system that
[02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:12.460]  they need in place. So think of it again as like everything in nature is repetitive.
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:18.380]  You have soil succession. So you start with a swamp that's anaerobic, which has literally
[02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:24.540]  zero fungi to bacteria ratio, all the way up to an old growth forest where you could have
[02:52:24.540 --> 02:52:31.100]  a thousand, 10,000, 100,000 to one bacteria. So the same thing is true in soil systems. In order
[02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:36.140]  to move from the swamp to the redwood forest, there are steps that you can't jump over. If you try to
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:42.780]  over them and cut the corners, you're wasting your time. So if trying to apply, you know, purely
[02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:49.500]  aerobic organisms to an anaerobic soil system, your good guys are going to get consumed. They're
[02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:54.940]  going to become a bio-stimulant for the bad guys. So you really need to kind of add in those yeasts,
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:53:00.220]  add in those earlier transitioners like the Stoxyliate. Stoxyliate, uh-
[02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:00.780]  Senator Gid.
[02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:06.780]  Well, they're transitionary. So think of it this way. Like if I see a Stoxyliate, I know I'm
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:15.820]  somewhere between anaerobic and aerobic. Call it the gray line, right? So I see a rotifer or I see
[02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:25.500]  a Stoxyliate, I know I can apply a more aerobic biology. If I see not even those guys, but I see
[02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:30.860]  just bacteria and clear fungi, I'm like, oh, okay, we're anaerobic here. And again, you know,
[02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:37.580]  I use all of my senses. Like I smell everything first because my nose is probably the best
[02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:41.740]  indicator of what I'm going to find when I put it under the microscope. So if I pick it up and it
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:46.220]  smells like shit, I'm not going to probably even microscope it. I'm like, that's not worth the time.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:51.820]  But now I know what I have to do to start transitioning that smelly shit into something
[02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:59.260]  that's more healthy and functional. So in some cases I'll introduce really dry yard waste compost.
[02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:05.340]  I know there's a tremendous amount of ammonia present in that. So therefore foods for the
[02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:12.380]  biology, but it's dry. And so it's going to soak up some of that excess moisture and begin to pull
[02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:19.180]  in some oxygen so that I can transition that soil quickly. Peter, we've talked about this on another
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:25.100]  session. I'm going to be rolling out a product called AMO, aquatic microorganisms. And so what,
[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:30.700]  this is waste stream from aquaculture, which is where I've done a lot of my work in the past.
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:37.980]  And so I've found out that by aerobically stabilizing this, you know, fish waste,
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:43.340]  I can get it to certain points. I can take it till it's a hundred percent aerobic and only
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:50.860]  flagellates and amoebas are present and yeast and some algae, or I can back it off and still
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:57.820]  have stock ciliates and rotifers and use that to apply to this anaerobic soil, knowing that those
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:03.100]  guys are going to help transition. One of the great things that rotifers and stock ciliates do
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:07.180]  is if you see them under the microscope, they look like little street sweepers. They're sweeping
[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:12.060]  everything into their mouths. So they do a wonderful job of breaking up compacted soil.
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:18.620]  So actually just quickly keep going, cause I'm going to grab my hard drive that has a bunch of
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:23.900]  microscope videos on it and I'll see if I can get some money shots of stock ciliates. Carry on.
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:32.140]  So anyway, this new product that's going to roll out, it's really going to be an industry changer
[02:55:32.140 --> 02:55:38.300]  for most people. So if you have a freshly built soil and you want to inoculate it,
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:43.740]  these are the kinds of products that are really going to get you leaps and bounds ahead of trying
[02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:51.740]  to just do a compost extract or a compost top dress, which take time to get into the soil.
[02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:59.580]  So again, the combination of an AMO and one of these liquid extracts are fantastic. The only
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:04.860]  problem is they're highly unstable. So these kinds of products have to be ship on demand.
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:09.660]  So you order it this week and then we process it and as soon as it's done processing, we ship to
[02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:15.260]  your door and we expect you to use it. One of the reasons why I stopped even marketing or selling
[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:22.140]  Harmonize was because I sold it to a lot of people who would take it, accept it, put it in their
[02:56:22.140 --> 02:56:27.740]  garage, leave it out in the sun, forget about it, get distracted and the bucket would explode or
[02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:32.860]  blow up or when they open it, it smelled like hydrogen sulfide. And I'm like, well, you just
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:38.620]  killed all the biology. I mean, you still have a nutrient solution. It's still valuable. But the
[02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:43.020]  problem is, is if you put it on the soil and it rains, it's mobile, you're going to lose it all.
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:48.380]  It's going to wash down into the lower horizons and not be available for the plant. But it is
[02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:53.420]  plant available nutrients. So this stuff is dynamite, kind of like that JDOM, you know,
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:59.260]  shit in a bucket stuff. It's biologically super rich. It's got all of this stuff available,
[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:06.380]  plant available. But the problem is it smells horrible and it will be mobile. So as soon as
[02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:11.420]  you water that system, everything's being washed down into the lower profiles and away from the
[02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:17.020]  root systems. So again, you know, this is, there's been a lot of lessons in my life over the years
[02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:22.540]  as to how to figure out how to do this, how to jumpstart soil and take it from zero to a hundred
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:29.500]  as fast as I possibly, as fast as possible. So you either get a better yield or so that you
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:36.300]  transition from dirt to soil or so that you, your first run isn't a dud because the biology didn't
[02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:44.550]  have time to set up and really get going. Yeah, that was a mouthful, huh?
[02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:51.990]  All right. Any other questions out there when he's looking for a start growing a bot?
[02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:59.790]  ClearX. I don't know what ClearX is. It sounds like it's a sugar based product. And
[02:57:59.790 --> 02:58:06.270]  to be honest with you, a lot of times when I'm transitioning large acreage, I will do first a
[02:58:06.270 --> 02:58:12.590]  soil sample, the soil chemistry, soil biology, saturated paste. So I understand what am I
[02:58:12.590 --> 02:58:19.150]  walking into? Next thing I'll do is if, if, if it looks okay, you know, I have some aggregation,
[02:58:19.630 --> 02:58:26.430]  you know, perhaps a low diversity of, of these predators, but I still have aggregation. So I
[02:58:26.430 --> 02:58:32.430]  have a functioning soil system, just not highly functioning. Then I'll do a biological application
[02:58:32.430 --> 02:58:38.750]  of a harmonize mixed with a rejuvenate one application in spring, you know, just after
[02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:44.510]  overseed. And then I will let it sit. And in the middle of summer, I will do just a humic acid
[02:58:45.390 --> 02:58:51.870]  or excuse me, a water soluble kelp, which is a hormone for the plants and molasses. So I'll make
[02:58:51.870 --> 02:58:58.750]  a sugar water with the hormone and apply that knowing that most systems, specifically the
[02:58:58.750 --> 02:59:05.470]  fungal kingdoms and a lot of the protozoa will, will slow down in the summer when, when the plant
[02:59:05.470 --> 02:59:11.870]  goes into kind of vacation mode. And then in fall, I'll come back and do another biological.
[02:59:12.430 --> 02:59:20.190]  And I've essentially turned 10 acres in, in less than one season, seven months from a low performing
[02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:28.350]  biological system into a highly, highly performing complete ecosystem in the soil. So anybody can do
[02:59:28.350 --> 02:59:34.670]  this. And if you, all you need to do is get a microscope and understand how to make biological
[02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:40.910]  compost, because trust me in this, I've been all over the country numerous times, and I've worked
[02:59:40.990 --> 02:59:46.030]  with so many people who I've been making compost for 40 years. I know what I'm doing. I worked with
[02:59:46.030 --> 02:59:51.310]  a gentleman right here in Malibu. That's been for 50 years, he's been making compost and he's
[02:59:51.310 --> 02:59:59.070]  considered the local compost guru. And he, I was at a Malibu fig farms, teaching some young Malibu
[02:59:59.870 --> 03:00:07.070]  boys, you know, farming compost making, and he just happened to show up and happen to have some
[03:00:07.150 --> 03:00:12.270]  of his product. And I was microscoping the soil with the kids and showing the kids this whole
[03:00:12.270 --> 03:00:17.710]  new life that exists underneath the microscope. They were geeking the hell out. So this guy was
[03:00:17.710 --> 03:00:21.150]  like, he, he was, he caught the vibe and the energy that was flowing. And he was like,
[03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:25.390]  well, what are you doing? I said, well, I'm microscoping to see how valuable,
[03:00:25.390 --> 03:00:30.510]  you know, the compost that we just made two weeks ago is. And he goes, really? He goes,
[03:00:31.470 --> 03:00:35.310]  what, what are you looking for? And I'm like, well, these microorganisms, they tell me,
[03:00:35.310 --> 03:00:40.270]  you know, how well the compost is coming along. And he goes, will you look at my compost? And I'm
[03:00:40.270 --> 03:00:45.470]  like, sure, bring it on. And this guy's been making this stuff for 40, 50 years, and it works.
[03:00:45.470 --> 03:00:51.550]  And it's manure based, cow manure based, put it on the microscope, no protozoa, no nematodes,
[03:00:51.550 --> 03:00:57.950]  no fungi. And I showed him my stuff versus his stuff versus the stuff that we just made on the
[03:00:57.950 --> 03:01:03.950]  farm two weeks prior. And he's like, wow, there's a huge difference here. And I'm like, yes, that's,
[03:01:03.950 --> 03:01:10.110]  you know, these organisms are what we're looking for, because they're non mobile, they do not
[03:01:10.110 --> 03:01:16.830]  wash out of the soil, it's a soil system. Your manure, your cow manure compost is a great source
[03:01:16.830 --> 03:01:22.910]  of nitrogen, phosphorus, and probably some potassium, but it's mobile as soon as it rains,
[03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:28.110]  that stuff's gone if the plant didn't consume it, or specifically the rhiosphere didn't consume it
[03:01:28.110 --> 03:01:34.510]  and put it make it plant available. So I'm like, the stuff that I'm making sticks around,
[03:01:34.510 --> 03:01:41.150]  it colonizes the soil. That way, if you do apply, you know, an organic source of nitrogen,
[03:01:41.710 --> 03:01:47.470]  that stuff will be consumed immediately by the biology and held in play. So that you don't
[03:01:47.470 --> 03:01:52.910]  lose it, it doesn't wash away. All right, here we go. What do we got here, Peter?
[03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:56.350]  All right, center of the screen, you see that dot?
[03:01:58.430 --> 03:02:06.670]  You got a pointer, Peter? Yep, right there. That is a cyst. Now based on the walls, it looks like
[03:02:06.670 --> 03:02:13.150]  that would be a flagellate cyst. An amoeba cyst would have a double wall. So there would be two
[03:02:13.150 --> 03:02:20.110]  little circles inside of each other. Other than that, just looks like bacteria floating around.
[03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:37.960]  What else you got, buddy? That's an air bubble. Yeah, you see that little wiggly guy,
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:44.040]  right? It's called a modal rod. It's kind of like wiggling its way up.
[03:02:44.760 --> 03:02:50.440]  And you were close before. There's a few of them. You can see them all over the place. Now,
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:56.200]  those are okay. They're just modal bacteria. Nothing scary there. Now, if that thing was
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:03:03.080]  going like a corkscrew, that would be a problem. That would mean it's a spirulum. And that's
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:08.840]  considered a pathogen for humans. So not a good guy, not a kind of dirt you want to put in your
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:39.930]  mouth. I don't see a lot of movement in here. Where did these come from, Peter? You're muted.
[03:03:42.730 --> 03:03:45.770]  He's talking, but he doesn't know he's muted. Yeah, you're muted, bud.
[03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:49.930]  Peter, there you go. These are things I filmed a couple years... Yeah,
[03:03:50.650 --> 03:03:57.610]  I kept asking questions and I was like, is that it? Yeah, this is stuff I filmed a couple years
[03:03:57.610 --> 03:04:07.840]  ago. I didn't know you were a microscope geek, dude. I want to be, but you and I need to sit
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:16.720]  down together and you need to get me through my sound barrier of being an idiot with a microscope.
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:21.200]  When I get to the higher magnifications, I'm always like, I can't see anything.
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:29.600]  Another thing about microscopy is slide preparation and dilution. That is so important.
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:39.680]  A lot of these products I make are literally, I have to dilute them. So I'll take one milliliter
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:47.040]  of it, add 10 mils of water, shake it up, then take one mil of that, put it in a separate
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:55.440]  vial or a test tube and add another 10 mils of water because otherwise I can't even see into it.
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:05:00.800]  It's so concentrated. So again, dilution is really critical. Now that looks like a fungal
[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:07.840]  hyphae there, that line that goes left to right. Yeah. But unfortunately you don't have the clarity
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:13.920]  to see if there's septi in there. Now this is all your stuff, right?
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:18.960]  Yep. That looks like another fungal hyphae or it could be a root here.
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:26.320]  There he is. Now he's not spinning his little wheels right now.
[03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:34.280]  Yeah. Normally you'd have like the street sweeper that they're called flagellum or
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:41.800]  uh, there's when there's a whole bunch of ciliates to have them. They're a group of
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:49.640]  hairs that are working together to spin all of the soil organic or the soil solution into their
[03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:54.600]  mouth. And the reason they have that stock is because they have to hold onto something.
[03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:59.800]  Otherwise they're just propelling across the slide. So yeah, they're really cool. Now that
[03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:06.840]  looks like it went into a cyst because it went circle. I'll often see this in when I'm making
[03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:14.360]  product when I'm going between anaerobic and aerobic in the aerobic stabilization process
[03:06:14.360 --> 03:06:19.960]  where I'll see this, these stock ciliates pop in and out. Now that's a ciliate. See how it's moving
[03:06:19.960 --> 03:06:25.080]  that. So that would be an anaerobic protozoa. And the reason we don't like to see them
[03:06:25.960 --> 03:06:30.680]  is because they'll eat the flagellates and the flagellates are good friends. So yeah, they'll,
[03:06:30.680 --> 03:06:37.480]  they'll help to break down compacted soil. Um, and they will consume bacteria and they will produce
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:43.640]  plant available nutrients because of what they're pooping out. But unfortunately they're eating good
[03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:48.840]  guys as well as bad guys. So we don't like to see a lot of them. A few of them are, I'm not,
[03:06:48.840 --> 03:06:52.120]  not concerned about, but when I just see a whole bunch of those racing around,
[03:06:52.680 --> 03:06:55.880]  chances are it's going to smell really horrible when you put it under your nose.
[03:07:00.190 --> 03:07:04.190]  I'm impressed that you even knew what a stock ciliate was, dude. You've obviously been doing
[03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:08.430]  some work. Now you see that little bumbling thing that went by on the left? That now,
[03:07:09.070 --> 03:07:17.790]  now go down and I can't, this is prerecorded. This is okay. Who's this guy? Yeah, he, I would,
[03:07:17.790 --> 03:07:22.590]  I would probably say he's a good guy because he's kind of bumbling around. He's not,
[03:07:22.990 --> 03:07:28.990]  what I was trying to do here is look at kind of the, the microbial activity around the roots. So
[03:07:28.990 --> 03:07:34.830]  this is actually roots. Yeah. And then I was trying to see what was going on around it.
[03:07:35.950 --> 03:07:41.310]  That's a great place to start when you're looking for organisms because more often than not,
[03:07:41.310 --> 03:07:47.230]  most people will have very disturbed soil with very poor biological health. Now you saw that
[03:07:47.230 --> 03:07:51.790]  little guy that zipped around a little bit, that very well see him right there bumbling around.
[03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:57.150]  Yup. That's another flagellate. Flagellates bumble. They have, they have a ciliate or they
[03:07:57.150 --> 03:08:04.510]  have a hair, a flagellum on each end of their orb so that they don't move in straight paths like the,
[03:08:05.710 --> 03:08:11.150]  like the ciliates do. They tend to bumble around a little bit. So that's a great indicator that
[03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:16.830]  it's a flagellate and not a ciliate just by the way it moves. And again, that's why when I teach
[03:08:16.830 --> 03:08:23.070]  class, it's like, look at what moves first and then we'll get into the other intricacies of
[03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:29.230]  what's not moving and how to identify them. The bacteria or flagellum, that's a, that's a
[03:08:29.230 --> 03:08:36.110]  beneficial thing in the rhizosphere? Yeah. So that would, a protozoa has flagellum and bacteria have
[03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:43.550]  flagellum. They're just really, really small. And also algae have flagellum. So a lot of the,
[03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:50.190]  the biological kingdoms have been shaken up lately. Pretty bad because they put,
[03:08:50.190 --> 03:08:57.230]  they put diatoms in with algae, they put flagellates in with algae and they call that
[03:08:57.230 --> 03:09:02.110]  the algae kingdom. In reality, they shouldn't be. Diatoms should be in their own kingdom.
[03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:07.470]  There's just billions of different species of them. And flagellates should remain in the,
[03:09:07.470 --> 03:09:15.150]  what I want to call protozoan kingdom where along with amoebas, but because they have a
[03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:21.070]  flagellum like algae, they've kind of thrown them into that category. And aren't these,
[03:09:21.070 --> 03:09:26.590]  aren't these more like little machines because the bacterial flagellums, aren't they able to rotate?
[03:09:27.310 --> 03:09:32.910]  Yeah, he's bumbling. So that, that is, that is, that would be considered a, a, a flagellate.
[03:09:33.870 --> 03:09:38.910]  Wow, you zoomed in too far. And now you see that little wiggling bacteria,
[03:09:38.910 --> 03:09:45.710]  that actually may be an algae. But again, without, without doing this, like, see, you're going in and
[03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:51.310]  out too quick. You really got to stay in a certain zone. When you're looking through a microscope,
[03:09:51.310 --> 03:09:57.150]  you're actually looking inside of a three or four story building. So as you go up and down,
[03:09:57.150 --> 03:10:02.910]  you will see different things. And so that's why it's best to just zoom in on one thing and,
[03:10:02.910 --> 03:10:08.270]  and look for a minute and then zoom out or zoom up or zoom down to see what else is there.
[03:10:09.070 --> 03:10:14.670]  Nematodes will always sink to the bottom of the slide. Flagellates will more often float to the
[03:10:14.670 --> 03:10:20.830]  surface. Bacteria will generally be bumbling around down at the bottom of the slide. And like
[03:10:20.830 --> 03:10:26.590]  that, that is, it looks like a good fungal hyphae right there. What magnification is this, Peter?
[03:10:27.390 --> 03:10:34.110]  I have no idea. I don't remember. Again, this is from like a couple years ago when I was just
[03:10:34.110 --> 03:10:38.750]  playing around and there, I mean, I didn't know I'd be showing these, like I'll try to find some
[03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:43.790]  where I actually do like, whenever I first found stock ciliates, I would just film them for like
[03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:51.150]  20 minutes straight just doing their thing. Eeking out. Yeah, those are modal rods, those
[03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:56.910]  little bacteria shaped things that are wiggling. Again, I don't see anything really bad about
[03:10:56.910 --> 03:11:03.870]  this particular slide. It looks pretty aerobic to me. So if I was to find a clear fungal
[03:11:05.390 --> 03:11:11.150]  cluster, I would probably say, yeah, you know, it could be a pathogen. It could be a good guy,
[03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:19.390]  hard to say. So I would use the overall system as a whole to judge whether its potential was
[03:11:19.390 --> 03:11:25.630]  good or bad, not just because it was clear and no, no septi. Are these bacteria?
[03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:31.550]  Yeah, those are all modal bacteria. And not bad, right?
[03:11:32.910 --> 03:11:38.990]  All right. So modal could be good or bad, but again, think of this as a successionary system
[03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:44.830]  and it's always in flux. So it's moving either to aerobic or to anaerobic.
[03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:52.030]  Nothing ever stays still in life. And that's, you know, where a lot of times I try to tell people,
[03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:58.270]  you're going to get some anaerobic pockets in your soil. That's just part of the system. We want to
[03:11:58.270 --> 03:12:03.630]  avoid them. We want to prevent them from being like the whole bottom of the pot. But a little
[03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:09.710]  pocket here or there is not going to hurt anything. Maybe we should do a microscope deep dive on one
[03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:14.510]  of these where we pull up a whole bunch of graphics. I was just thinking that.
[03:12:15.470 --> 03:12:22.670]  We're talking now. We we I love to have people either you like just you you could record a couple
[03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:29.310]  like five minute clips and then just send me the video file and I can show it while we talk through
[03:12:29.310 --> 03:12:34.350]  like what you're looking at. Oh, I dude, I'm struggling with Dropbox and all this other
[03:12:34.350 --> 03:12:41.470]  shit. I mean, it's just such a nightmare to send. Maybe people can people who have been learning on
[03:12:41.470 --> 03:12:48.190]  the microscope, if you want to send me some videos and then we can throw them up and.
[03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:56.110]  As a group, see what we're looking at. There you go. That'll be fun. I might have a friend here in
[03:12:56.110 --> 03:13:01.550]  Colorado that I can reach out to that we could get a bunch of videos for you, but there you go.
[03:13:03.710 --> 03:13:07.070]  Yeah, I had sent here some yogurt mold. Let me see what's going on there.
[03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:11.950]  And you know what, Brian, if you if you have this guy or Peter, do you still have your camera and
[03:13:11.950 --> 03:13:20.910]  stuff? Yeah, I have. Yeah, I have an. What I can do. What it's a hand scope or is it now?
[03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:26.670]  Am scope. Am scope is the brand. OK, is it a is it a monarch or bioc?
[03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:33.150]  So is that two eyes or one eyepiece? They have two. Yeah, it has two eyepieces.
[03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:41.790]  But I usually use the the video camera on the top. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. You know what I'll
[03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:50.030]  do, Peter? I lost him. I was going to send I can send you guys, you know, highly biologically rich
[03:13:50.030 --> 03:13:54.350]  inoculants that you can put under the scope and you're going to see all kinds of goodies.
[03:13:55.310 --> 03:14:02.510]  I actually used to used to sell them to schools for for the kids so that they knew this inoculant
[03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:09.790]  would have a tremendous amount of life. If you ship that to me here in Colorado,
[03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:16.510]  would that kind of kill the real life in that? No, because a lot of times I've put it in suspension.
[03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:23.790]  So part of part of making a product shelf stable is you've got to take the organisms and get them
[03:14:23.790 --> 03:14:29.870]  to syst up so that they're not consuming oxygen and therefore making the whole thing anaerobic.
[03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:37.310]  So part of the process of making shelf stable product is to dewater it or defoil the gas
[03:14:37.310 --> 03:14:42.270]  in it, for lack of better words. And at that point, then what you do is you take that that
[03:14:42.270 --> 03:14:47.230]  that solid, you put it in a glass of water like a tablespoon or whatever teaspoon,
[03:14:47.230 --> 03:14:53.550]  stir it up, add maybe a drop of molasses and stir it as often as you can over a 12 hour period.
[03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:58.510]  24, 30 hour period. Now that shit's going to be dynamite. You're going to see tons of
[03:14:58.510 --> 03:15:04.110]  flagellates running around. You'll see plenty of nematodes. You'll see the testate amoeba.
[03:15:04.110 --> 03:15:08.990]  You'll see the fungi. You'll see the whole gamut of the guys you're really looking for.
[03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:16.270]  Yeah, we'll be more prepared. Yeah, we should definitely do a microscope class and we can
[03:15:16.270 --> 03:15:21.790]  be a little more prepared than me trying to go through like a thousand crappy videos from
[03:15:22.590 --> 03:15:24.030]  two years ago.
[03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:27.710]  No, that's a good idea. Can play on that for sure.
[03:15:29.710 --> 03:15:37.630]  Blue is going to join the show until... She just told you she has... That's funny.
[03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.990]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[03:15:44.190 --> 03:15:49.150]  We can end on that with a... Yes, I'm still... Well, yeah, I took a little break from...
[03:15:49.150 --> 03:15:53.950]  So what are those roto thingies? All right, they're called rotifers.
[03:15:56.030 --> 03:16:05.230]  Quick aquatic lesson. So when fish lay eggs, they are called eggs. But as they first evolve,
[03:16:05.230 --> 03:16:09.150]  you'll see the tail and the head stick out and then there's a yolk sac underneath them.
[03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:19.710]  That is called... Oh, fuck. It's before the fry phase. Larva. That's the larval stage.
[03:16:19.710 --> 03:16:26.270]  Then you get into the fry stage. When the fish are fry, they're eating rotifers. That's their
[03:16:26.270 --> 03:16:32.030]  food source. And so a lot of my early work was going around the streams and rivers
[03:16:32.750 --> 03:16:38.590]  and taking water samples to identify how healthy that watershed or waterway was.
[03:16:38.590 --> 03:16:43.710]  And what I quickly realized that more often than not, I would not see fish. I would not see
[03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:50.910]  fry. I would... And I would not see rotifers. And that was the problem is once those rotifers,
[03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:58.990]  which are very sensitive environmentally to synthetic compounds, will die. And so if you
[03:16:58.990 --> 03:17:05.950]  lose your rotifer population, you lose the ability for these fry to transition from larval stage
[03:17:06.510 --> 03:17:12.190]  into fish or fry stage or grow to a fingerling is what they're really called.
[03:17:13.310 --> 03:17:20.510]  So it's a huge issue environmentally. I mean, a lot of my marine biology buddies are almost
[03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:25.710]  suicidal because they're documenting the death of the shit. They're not documenting new species or
[03:17:26.270 --> 03:17:32.270]  viable ecology or ecosystems because we've just done so much damage to it.
[03:17:32.830 --> 03:17:39.790]  So anyway, if you take rotifers out of the system, you cannot transition fry into fingerling,
[03:17:39.790 --> 03:17:45.390]  which is a huge problem. That's why we have to stock all of our streams with trout because the
[03:17:46.110 --> 03:17:51.870]  organisms aren't there. Even if the fish bred, their fish eggs are going to turn into food for
[03:17:51.870 --> 03:17:58.350]  something else because they're never going to make it past that larval stage into fry into
[03:17:58.350 --> 03:18:06.910]  fingerling. So anyway, that's what a rotifer is. Yeah, rotifers are multi-celled organisms. And
[03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:14.190]  another thing about them is they do happen in soil systems, specifically in transitional soil
[03:18:14.190 --> 03:18:18.590]  systems that are not anaerobic but not aerobic. So the cysts are present.
[03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:27.870]  Leighton's showing rotifers the love they deserve. Oh man, I love my fish and my fry and my larval.
[03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:36.430]  I see Lone Wolf said, check out Jammin' Germs on Instagram. Maybe we can invite some microscope guests.
[03:18:37.230 --> 03:18:45.460]  There you go. That'd be fun. That's how the ecosystem works. Oh man.
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:54.420]  And they provide oxidation. Yes, they do. Without soil structure, you will never get
[03:18:54.980 --> 03:19:01.780]  good gas exchange, which means oxygen in, CO2 out. Plants want the CO2, the organisms want the
[03:19:01.780 --> 03:19:10.000]  oxygen. Without soil structure, you ain't getting any of that. What is this? Yes, my wife couldn't
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:15.440]  deal with all the collapse. Yeah, man, it's depressing. People wonder why I drink scotch
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:21.520]  and smoke weed at night. The shit I do is just, I would not recommend on a lighthearted soul.
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:38.360]  It's just not pretty work. Trent, well, you know what, dude, hit me up on Instagram. I'll send you
[03:19:38.360 --> 03:19:43.880]  a little frigging jar of some badass organisms and that will really open your eyes up to what
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:49.160]  you should be seeing. Then go out and take a soil sample and put that under the microscope. You're
[03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:53.560]  going to start crying, buddy, because now you're going to see what's really in this oil. Do you
[03:19:53.560 --> 03:20:02.520]  see this one? Horrifying. So you know about ORP and dissolved oxygen meters, right? Yeah. Do you
[03:20:02.520 --> 03:20:08.280]  see growth in the near future using these technologies and combine with O2 saturation
[03:20:08.280 --> 03:20:13.400]  reaction for super oxidized water? All right. So here's a great little story. Back in my early
[03:20:13.400 --> 03:20:19.960]  days training under Elaine, she had a compost tea brewer that she couldn't get to brew really
[03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:24.760]  good compost tea. So I looked at the blower and I said, Elaine, the problem is your blower's too
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:32.520]  small for the height of your water column. So the deeper the water, the harder it is for that air to
[03:20:32.520 --> 03:20:38.920]  actually push through that column and bring in the oxygen. So I said, all right, all you need is
[03:20:38.920 --> 03:20:44.360]  either a smaller tank and you can use that pump. And again, this is a cone bottom tank, not a flat
[03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:50.360]  bottom, not a tote, but a small cone bottom tank. And the ratio is really important. Do a little
[03:20:50.360 --> 03:20:55.880]  studying on aquaculture. Stout tank. Yeah. Look, do a little work on aquaculture. You'll understand
[03:20:55.880 --> 03:21:01.800]  that ratio. So anyway, I said, just increase the blower size or get a smaller tank and use this
[03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:07.960]  blower. And she did and it worked fine. So it made me think that, you know, all right, it's all about
[03:21:07.960 --> 03:21:14.680]  oxygen in growing out these organisms. So I went and I got a bottle of pure oxygen and I brewed out
[03:21:14.680 --> 03:21:21.080]  a batch of very biologically active compost and I expected to just, you know, blow it out of the
[03:21:21.080 --> 03:21:28.680]  fucking park. I fucking killed everything. I killed everything. It's called oxidation. So too much
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:36.120]  oxygen is corrosive. It will destroy the biology. So there is a level that is critical, um, that you
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:45.080]  understand. And generally the rule of thumb is that if you're dissolved, oxygen is below five
[03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:52.280]  parts per million, you're anaerobic. If you start to go above 30, you're starting to get anoxic. So
[03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:57.800]  you're going to oxidize your organisms. So that's how small parts per million oxygen needs to be in
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:04.040]  the water column. You know, I have fucked around with some of these new, um, systems that increase
[03:22:04.040 --> 03:22:10.920]  the DO and water, uh, for specifically for drip irrigation. So backing it up, even another notch,
[03:22:10.920 --> 03:22:16.920]  I did some tests early on, on dissolved oxygen in different environments. So I took a rain drop,
[03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:23.240]  I took a sprint overhead sprinkler system, tap water and drip irrigation. And I measured the
[03:22:23.240 --> 03:22:30.360]  DO and those, the water drop from the rain, the rainwater was about 25 parts per million.
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:37.880]  The overhead irrigation was about 18%. Uh, tap water was down about eight drip irrigation was
[03:22:37.880 --> 03:22:43.720]  about five. So drip irrigation is anaerobic. So I was trying to figure out how to move enough
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:49.240]  oxygen into that pipe because as the water flows through that pipe, you have a thing called
[03:22:49.240 --> 03:22:54.840]  cavitation and you also have a thing called resistance, which pulls that oxygen out of the
[03:22:54.840 --> 03:23:01.880]  water column and it dissipates. So how do you get DO to the other end of that pipe that's, you know,
[03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:08.120]  300 yards down when it has all of that resistance and all that cavitation it has to go through,
[03:23:08.120 --> 03:23:12.760]  but you don't want to be delivering anaerobic water down to those organisms at the other end
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:18.920]  of the pipe. Well, we figured we'd build up the DO high enough. Then by the time it got to the other
[03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:23.880]  end of the pipe, it would still be functional. And I think the sweet spot was around 50.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:31.080]  And that was for, I think it was a hundred yards if my memory serves me correct. So we built the
[03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:37.960]  water, the DO up to 50 by using oxygen in the system. And once we got to that 50 parts per
[03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:42.760]  million, we pushed it through the irrigation. And by the time it came out, it was down around 18,
[03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:49.080]  15, 18, something like that. So it worked, it did function, but I would be very careful about
[03:23:49.080 --> 03:23:55.000]  putting too much O2 into any system after the lesson I learned when I was first working with
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:24:03.070]  the Lane and compost tea brewers. All right, we could go on and on for this shit, right? H2O2,
[03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:12.110]  15, 15, yeah, 14 is good. Hey, you know, again, I talked about the fourth phase of water
[03:24:12.750 --> 03:24:17.710]  and the easy zone, and this gets really fucking complex, but you know, all you guys,
[03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:26.190]  all you water nerds out there, I highly recommend you go on YouTube, go to TED talks and chase the
[03:24:26.190 --> 03:24:33.150]  fourth phase of water. It's really mind blowing about some of the properties of this stuff. And
[03:24:34.510 --> 03:24:37.630]  anyway, yeah, we could go on about that. That could be a whole nother show.
[03:24:38.510 --> 03:24:43.230]  All right, it looks like questions are dying down pretty much here, hopefully.
[03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:49.710]  Could use some food and a piss break. I could definitely, I was going to put you
[03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:57.550]  on full screen and run to the bathroom. Not fair, Peter. All right, we've been three and a half. I
[03:24:57.550 --> 03:25:03.150]  think we could wrap this one up, do another one. Are we doing next week, Brian? I forget,
[03:25:03.150 --> 03:25:07.790]  are we taking a week off? I think next Thursday is Christmas. It's either Christmas or Christmas
[03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:12.670]  Eve, right? Yeah, that's right. We're taking it off and we're focusing on the New Year's day.
[03:25:13.230 --> 03:25:18.910]  That's right. New Year's party. We're doing a rotation of speakers coming in. Maybe I can get
[03:25:18.910 --> 03:25:23.710]  Kev to show up on that day. That'd be fun. I'll text him after we hang up, see if he can come in
[03:25:23.710 --> 03:25:27.710]  on New Year's Day. And let him know that it's quick, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll roll
[03:25:27.790 --> 03:25:32.670]  him in and roll him out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He knows the drill. Okay. All right. Well, I'm going
[03:25:32.670 --> 03:25:42.990]  to eat the second half of my burrito, which I first started for breakfast. So, and yeah, and
[03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:51.630]  just to anyone waiting on seeds, I'm furiously packing away. Sorry for the delay. Greg wants a
[03:25:51.630 --> 03:26:04.830]  few garden professors, such as? Layton, who would be a good? Garden professor? Like you mean a
[03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:08.510]  consultant? I don't know. Is that what he's looking for? Greg, what are you looking for,
[03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:13.710]  brother? Hit us up again. Yeah, whatever's important on that. Greg, who are some of like
[03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:24.030]  the University of Hawaii agricultural professors who are good? Anyway, we'll wait 20 seconds for-
[03:26:24.030 --> 03:26:32.350]  There you go. My kidney's about to explode. Spotcheck News wants Paul Gouch. Do you know him?
[03:26:35.310 --> 03:26:42.270]  Never heard of him. Yes, you are going to get Peter's Indigenous Microbes,
[03:26:42.270 --> 03:26:47.390]  and I highly recommend you take those seeds and put them in your mouth for at least 30 seconds,
[03:26:47.390 --> 03:26:53.470]  if not for a minute, so those seeds genetically bond with what you need. This is no joke, man.
[03:26:53.470 --> 03:26:58.350]  That's real. That's fact. And you're saying the person who gets them, not me. I should not be
[03:26:58.350 --> 03:27:02.590]  putting all the seeds in my mouth. No, not you, Peter. The end user. But they get a little bit
[03:27:02.590 --> 03:27:10.270]  of your biology, and then the seed will get their biology. That'd be amazing to have Paul Stamos on.
[03:27:10.270 --> 03:27:19.460]  That'd be badass. I'll reach out to him. I had pinged him a while back to come on
[03:27:19.460 --> 03:27:26.340]  with this guy, Mike Amaranthus, who's a mycologist. He's retired, and they're friends.
[03:27:28.420 --> 03:27:33.300]  Anyway, I'll reach out to him again. Yeah, ping him. See if he'll come on for
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:36.820]  a half an hour on New Year's Eve, and if not, maybe do a show in January.
[03:27:37.300 --> 03:27:44.180]  Oh, yeah. Hey, buddy. Yeah, reach out to us if there's other people that you want to hear from.
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:50.500]  We can potentially reach out. We want to give back to you guys, so whatever real information
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:56.500]  you're trying to get, we want to deliver. All right. Should we call it?
[03:27:57.540 --> 03:28:00.660]  I'm in. Three hours and 27 minutes in.
[03:28:00.660 --> 03:28:04.660]  27 minutes in. 28 minutes and 35 seconds and counting.
[03:28:06.660 --> 03:28:14.500]  My kidney's about to burst. So Greg says Leo Marcilla. Oh, I reached out to him, Greg.
[03:28:16.420 --> 03:28:21.300]  Actually, I think he got back to me. All right. Put that on your priority list, Peter.
[03:28:22.260 --> 03:28:30.260]  Yeah. Again, if people can remind me. Hiking bear. That's real shit, man. That's
[03:28:30.260 --> 03:28:39.700]  a real deal. Your seeds will epigenetically connect with you, and they will grow based on
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:45.300]  your body's endocannabinoid system and what it's looking for. That's no joke.
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:53.220]  All right. Well, let's peace out on this. We can kill it in 40 seconds. We did three and a half
[03:28:53.220 --> 03:29:03.140]  hours. I'd say that was a pretty good session. Well, we're already at 130, so we're at 131.
[03:29:04.100 --> 03:29:10.500]  Are we? The little live clip says 329 and 42 seconds.
[03:29:11.700 --> 03:29:14.900]  Mine says 329 and 11 seconds. That's weird that we have a different-
[03:29:16.020 --> 03:29:17.700]  Uh-oh. We're in time warp, dude.
[03:29:17.860 --> 03:29:22.900]  Anyway. All right. Well, listen. Merry Christmas to the audience.
