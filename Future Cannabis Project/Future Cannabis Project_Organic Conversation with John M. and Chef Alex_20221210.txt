[00:09.980 --> 00:10.980]  Oh, nice.
[00:10.980 --> 00:11.980]  Welcome, everybody.
[00:11.980 --> 00:18.340]  Yeah, those pictures with the true OG.
[00:18.340 --> 00:23.940]  Anybody in chat, if you knew who these men were standing next to, mention it in chat.
[00:23.940 --> 00:25.860]  We'll come up with something cool for you.
[00:25.860 --> 00:28.880]  But hey, everybody, welcome.
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.000]  Another edition of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.260]  And I'm pretty darn stoked for this one.
[00:34.260 --> 00:36.780]  And I'm ready to get into it because we didn't have much of a pre-show.
[00:36.780 --> 00:39.340]  We had technical issues to work through.
[00:39.340 --> 00:42.180]  We've got through them, and we're going to have a rad conversation.
[00:42.180 --> 00:44.340]  So I guess let me start it off first.
[00:44.340 --> 00:45.660]  We've got a returning guest.
[00:45.660 --> 00:47.860]  We got John M., Mr. Gross Face Killer.
[00:47.860 --> 00:49.500]  How you doing today?
[00:49.500 --> 00:50.540]  Very well, very well.
[00:50.540 --> 00:51.860]  Thank you, Chad, for having us.
[00:51.860 --> 00:53.380]  Yeah, my pleasure, dude.
[00:53.380 --> 00:54.940]  Thank you for making the time.
[00:54.940 --> 00:56.580]  You have been up to some cool things.
[00:56.580 --> 00:58.620]  I can't wait to hear about it.
[00:58.620 --> 01:02.660]  But one thing or one person that we heard a lot about the first time we talked, which
[01:02.660 --> 01:07.700]  if anybody wants to go back, check out that conversation, I believe it was about three
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.220]  or four months ago, maybe.
[01:09.220 --> 01:11.220]  But it was July 30th.
[01:11.220 --> 01:12.220]  OK, July 30th.
[01:12.220 --> 01:13.220]  I've done a lot since then.
[01:13.220 --> 01:15.620]  Damn, I bet you have done a lot.
[01:15.620 --> 01:18.420]  It's time flies.
[01:18.420 --> 01:22.300]  But I'm stoked because today's chef, Alex, is with us.
[01:22.300 --> 01:25.100]  And this is a person who you spoke very highly of.
[01:25.100 --> 01:28.740]  I was excited and eager to get you on.
[01:28.740 --> 01:30.140]  Thanks for making the time, Alex.
[01:30.140 --> 01:32.380]  How are you doing today?
[01:32.380 --> 01:33.700]  I'm doing very well, Chad.
[01:33.700 --> 01:34.540]  Thanks for having me.
[01:34.620 --> 01:37.900]  I appreciate you giving me an opportunity to join you on the show.
[01:37.900 --> 01:39.540]  Yeah, dude, absolutely.
[01:39.540 --> 01:40.540]  My pleasure.
[01:40.540 --> 01:46.380]  Like you guys, you know, just little humble and modest award winning growers over here.
[01:46.380 --> 01:49.740]  Just come on over, have a conversation.
[01:49.740 --> 01:51.100]  I love that.
[01:51.100 --> 01:57.100]  Now, one thing that, you know, we kind of got into on the previous shows was, John,
[01:57.100 --> 02:01.540]  you have a pretty holistic or an interesting approach to cannabis.
[02:01.540 --> 02:07.780]  So I'd love to maybe if you want to kind of refresh that for people that may have missed
[02:07.780 --> 02:14.300]  the first episode of just why you grow the way you do or what brought you to the way
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.300]  that you grow.
[02:15.300 --> 02:19.940]  And then I'm going to turn the tables on you to Chef Alex.
[02:19.940 --> 02:26.540]  But John, I guess a quick summary of that is that, you know, I've grown all different
[02:26.540 --> 02:28.660]  types of ways.
[02:28.660 --> 02:31.180]  You know, I'm in my 50s now.
[02:31.220 --> 02:33.020]  I'm into my 50s now.
[02:33.020 --> 02:37.100]  And, you know, it was always about creating the best medicine.
[02:37.100 --> 02:42.700]  And as I learn more about soil and the biology and being schooled by all of these great people
[02:42.700 --> 02:49.460]  that I've been inundating myself with all these podcasts and lectures and, you know,
[02:49.460 --> 02:55.420]  conferences for organic and like it's kind of led me to the path of this being like the
[02:55.420 --> 03:03.260]  gateway, not the gateway drug, but the gateway to growing healthy, you know, having a healthier
[03:03.260 --> 03:04.900]  life.
[03:04.900 --> 03:08.620]  Because once you start to learn about biology and that everything that we put in our body
[03:08.620 --> 03:15.580]  is pretty much poison because of modern agriculture, that, you know, we start to understand the
[03:15.580 --> 03:19.660]  soil and biology and that what we're producing is not medicine anymore.
[03:19.660 --> 03:25.220]  Food is supposed to be medicine, but modern agriculture has made it into poison.
[03:25.220 --> 03:31.940]  And it's kind of this wonderful synergy between learning about all these fascinating things
[03:31.940 --> 03:34.340]  and this plant that helps us so much, too.
[03:34.340 --> 03:37.780]  As a medication, I suffer from anxiety.
[03:37.780 --> 03:39.180]  I'm a type one diabetic.
[03:39.180 --> 03:42.220]  I have all these other things.
[03:42.220 --> 03:44.060]  People don't believe I'm 54.
[03:44.060 --> 03:47.380]  And I really feel it's a testament to this plant.
[03:47.380 --> 03:50.580]  But I am trying to practice what I preach.
[03:50.580 --> 03:56.780]  And I realize that there's so many ways that we can always be better or do better.
[03:56.780 --> 04:02.140]  But I just feel that it's stumbled across like understanding this plant made me understand
[04:02.140 --> 04:07.340]  a lot of the, you know, like our agriculture in this country.
[04:07.340 --> 04:13.660]  And of course, we're diseased because of what we put in our bodies and, you know, this bioaccumulation.
[04:13.700 --> 04:23.500]  So, yeah, so it's I'm really on this path now to try to be much better to myself for
[04:23.500 --> 04:30.020]  my diabetes, for the sake of just living healthier, longer and being here to take care of and,
[04:30.020 --> 04:37.180]  you know, for myself and for my loved ones, you know, and quality of life like we so sorry
[04:37.180 --> 04:41.140]  if I went off on many tangents, but that's where it's Chef and I connect.
[04:41.140 --> 04:46.060]  We really understand now what it means to do.
[04:46.060 --> 04:47.580]  And we're always striving to be better.
[04:47.580 --> 04:48.580]  We're not perfect.
[04:48.580 --> 04:53.260]  You know, it's time to be more practice what we preach or what we've known.
[04:53.260 --> 04:58.300]  It's just kind of and I see him 20 years behind me, but 20 years ahead of me, really, you
[04:58.300 --> 05:06.580]  know, so it's like, yeah, I torch and it's important to pass this on and not understand
[05:06.580 --> 05:12.660]  that this is also about, you know, all these plants, all these master plants we need to
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.460]  put into our diet.
[05:14.460 --> 05:15.460]  We're devoid.
[05:15.460 --> 05:16.460]  It's not on the shelf.
[05:16.460 --> 05:17.500]  It's not in the stores.
[05:17.500 --> 05:21.900]  We need to create it ourself and getting this plant and going out into the yard, growing
[05:21.900 --> 05:25.460]  your own vegetables, growing your own herbs, growing your own mushrooms.
[05:25.460 --> 05:28.340]  All these things are the superfoods that we don't put in our diet.
[05:28.340 --> 05:29.340]  And that's why we're sick.
[05:29.340 --> 05:32.140]  We're only as healthy as our gut biome.
[05:32.140 --> 05:36.380]  So I've kind of so sorry to go.
[05:36.380 --> 05:41.140]  I know we had talked for two and a half hours on your last show, and this time to really
[05:41.140 --> 05:44.020]  let the shine.
[05:44.020 --> 05:49.220]  I cleared I cleared my afternoon so we can go as long as we want, because two and a half
[05:49.220 --> 05:52.460]  hours last time wasn't long enough.
[05:52.460 --> 05:53.460]  But you're right.
[05:53.460 --> 05:56.500]  You know, I wish that I came into it earlier.
[05:56.500 --> 06:00.740]  You know, I was growing earlier, but I didn't understand a lot of the science behind it
[06:00.740 --> 06:04.660]  or a lot of the reasons why you want to do certain practices.
[06:04.660 --> 06:10.040]  And so, you know, yeah, for people who are starting at an earlier age with all the advancements
[06:10.040 --> 06:16.820]  that took years to learn, if you have that eagerness and, you know, just the curiosity,
[06:16.820 --> 06:19.100]  you go far with this thing.
[06:19.100 --> 06:23.180]  And I kind of you know, there's a lot of growers out there who treat their plants better than
[06:23.180 --> 06:27.020]  their own gut biome, which is funny that you mentioned that I'm kind of one of them, but
[06:27.020 --> 06:28.780]  I'm slowly coming around.
[06:28.820 --> 06:35.900]  And geez, I cut out some things from my life and I start feeling better and it all relates.
[06:35.900 --> 06:41.660]  So I guess, you know, Chef Alex, how did you maybe get on to the approach?
[06:41.660 --> 06:47.580]  Or let's first how so are you growing as well right now?
[06:47.580 --> 06:55.220]  Yes, yeah, I grow both indoor and outdoor and where you left off on the biome really
[06:55.220 --> 07:01.540]  picks up for me because part of the Probiotic Farmers Alliance is where I started.
[07:01.540 --> 07:03.380]  Yeah, that's cool.
[07:03.380 --> 07:04.860]  Give a shout out.
[07:04.860 --> 07:09.660]  I'll give a shout out to my old dude, Chris, who I used to cop from and kind of turned
[07:09.660 --> 07:12.260]  me on to growing.
[07:12.260 --> 07:16.480]  And we'd go, you know, just smoke and hang out and talk different strains.
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.100]  But then he'd have YouTube videos on MendoDope and Subcool.
[07:21.100 --> 07:24.460]  And you know, yeah, he was growing synthetically.
[07:24.460 --> 07:30.580]  And that's how I started to for the first few years as most people do.
[07:30.580 --> 07:34.860]  And you know, a lot of people say, but it's no judgment.
[07:34.860 --> 07:38.540]  I'm just happy that everybody's able to have a part of the plant and share their love and
[07:38.540 --> 07:41.420]  passion for it, you know.
[07:41.420 --> 07:47.860]  So it's been about eight years that I've been growing and about five of them, four and a
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.660]  About five years growing organically now.
[07:50.660 --> 07:55.660]  It's been, yeah.
[07:55.660 --> 07:59.620]  Are you using soil, soil-based medium or?
[07:59.620 --> 08:00.620]  I am, yeah.
[08:00.620 --> 08:06.780]  I use soil both inside and then I recycle it to use it outside.
[08:06.780 --> 08:13.540]  I'm on my fourth cycle outdoors in the sun on the coast of Maine in the same soil.
[08:13.580 --> 08:16.900]  I reamended every year and just use biology.
[08:18.580 --> 08:24.900]  Very cool. I have a similar approach where things come from inside to outside.
[08:24.900 --> 08:30.860]  I don't go outside to inside just as like I'm a very strict IPM person, you know, there's
[08:31.060 --> 08:33.340]  sure you could, yeah, you get away with it.
[08:33.340 --> 08:38.780]  But if you're very, if you're very yes or no with things, there's no maybe.
[08:39.380 --> 08:42.340]  So I'm very yes, it happens or no, it doesn't.
[08:43.300 --> 08:50.740]  So I make a point to work, work IPM as like a top priority.
[08:50.740 --> 08:57.620]  So the last season or two, I actually challenged myself to do what you said you wouldn't do,
[08:57.620 --> 08:59.140]  which is bring stuff outside.
[09:00.260 --> 09:06.380]  And well, I have a garage girl as well that is like in between outside and inside.
[09:06.380 --> 09:08.140]  So I use that as the test.
[09:08.780 --> 09:12.940]  So I found some stuff over the last couple of years that I did want to keep around and
[09:12.940 --> 09:19.060]  was able to isolate clones off of it and keep them clean, make sure that there wasn't any
[09:19.060 --> 09:23.300]  pest problems or anything, quarantined them away from the rest of my garden.
[09:23.460 --> 09:27.340]  Once they were clean, you know, introduce them back into population.
[09:28.100 --> 09:33.980]  So, yeah, I'm pretty, pretty happy with my findings on that and, you know, always learning.
[09:34.980 --> 09:40.060]  Definitely. And, you know, sometimes we're all, you know, a little bit of risk takers in one
[09:40.060 --> 09:44.180]  way or another, and sometimes you want to know what happens, what if?
[09:44.260 --> 09:48.020]  So sometimes you put yourself in different situations.
[09:50.620 --> 09:55.300]  No, sometimes when you get things down, you may get a little bored and you want to spice up
[09:55.300 --> 10:00.100]  your life. So I know people that intentionally give themselves infestations or will
[10:00.100 --> 10:04.420]  intentionally try to get PM and then they just go at it from there.
[10:05.860 --> 10:10.460]  Fortunately, I didn't have to deal with that, but, you know, I can give a shout out to a
[10:10.460 --> 10:13.780]  really good breeder who does some stress testing, Alex Hardy.
[10:14.180 --> 10:19.620]  He'll do some dry farming and he's actually on FCP2.
[10:19.700 --> 10:21.900]  Shout out, mad props to Hardy Gear.
[10:21.940 --> 10:23.220]  His gear is Hardy.
[10:23.940 --> 10:25.420]  Yes. Yeah, definitely.
[10:25.420 --> 10:28.460]  He's got some stuff on the daga.garden website as well.
[10:28.460 --> 10:31.940]  But he does a show on the FCP02 channel.
[10:31.940 --> 10:33.980]  So anybody want to check that out?
[10:34.340 --> 10:40.620]  Go and check it out. Yeah, he's a very, very knowledgeable guy and he works with a lot of
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.740]  older strains.
[10:41.740 --> 10:47.980]  It's not, you know, things that people are posting on Instagram or hype boy.
[10:48.020 --> 10:48.980]  That's that's what I'm saying.
[10:49.060 --> 10:50.540]  Alex is not a hype boy.
[10:50.540 --> 10:53.180]  He's he's a solid dude who puts in work.
[10:53.180 --> 10:58.060]  So that's cool to see here or to know another person that's running his gear.
[10:58.460 --> 11:04.060]  That's awesome. Yeah, I have a few of his packs in the vault that I'm itching to get back
[11:04.060 --> 11:07.420]  into here soon. His gears performed very well for me outside.
[11:07.420 --> 11:13.300]  I really dig how he treats his environments.
[11:13.900 --> 11:19.940]  Yeah. Now, so we're talking about kind of living soil and, you know, I'll go both of you
[11:19.940 --> 11:20.900]  guys on this question.
[11:20.900 --> 11:22.940]  Maybe John will go with you first here.
[11:23.740 --> 11:27.180]  With the living soil, are you in pots or are you in beds?
[11:27.580 --> 11:30.780]  What size of a soil mass do you work with a lot of times?
[11:31.140 --> 11:38.780]  I'm running in 10 or 15 gallon containers, but really it is I the beds is the way to go.
[11:39.660 --> 11:43.220]  It's definite. I haven't added my worms yet.
[11:43.220 --> 11:45.780]  I got my hungry bin over here.
[11:46.260 --> 11:48.860]  The last time I showed Alex that he was like, it's scary.
[11:48.860 --> 11:52.900]  I don't want. So that's the next step is the beds.
[11:52.900 --> 11:55.380]  And but I don't my space right now.
[11:55.380 --> 11:56.700]  It really doesn't allow me.
[11:56.700 --> 11:58.580]  I like to be able to move the plants around.
[11:59.140 --> 12:03.300]  And really, my name is Gross Space Killer on the IG, but it's the space that's killing me.
[12:03.300 --> 12:06.660]  So I have to keep my plants mobile so I can move them around.
[12:07.540 --> 12:12.900]  I can show you some stocks where I've been like I'm like, how do you fit an eight foot plant in an eight foot ceiling height?
[12:13.340 --> 12:17.860]  Bend it in half. So it's like I'm going around doing a plant yoga.
[12:19.220 --> 12:23.580]  Maintaining the space is really it is really killing me, but need more space.
[12:23.980 --> 12:29.380]  But always. But but yeah, I do sevens and fifteens because I don't think you should really be going less than that
[12:30.220 --> 12:32.220]  for the balance of of what you're doing.
[12:32.220 --> 12:40.460]  And and honestly, if you have like a, you know, a bed and even if you're not doing the horizontal method in it,
[12:40.460 --> 12:43.260]  it's still going to outperform pots.
[12:43.500 --> 12:47.580]  And I really believe in companion and plants are very, very.
[12:49.500 --> 12:51.180]  They help each other. They help each other.
[12:51.180 --> 12:52.500]  We can learn a lot from plants.
[12:53.300 --> 12:55.700]  Yeah. Yeah. And how about you, Chef?
[12:55.700 --> 12:58.980]  Do you prefer. Well, what are you using?
[12:58.980 --> 13:02.660]  I would love beds, but I'm not using beds because I don't have space for bed.
[13:02.660 --> 13:05.660]  So I guess what are you currently using versus what do you prefer?
[13:07.340 --> 13:18.980]  Well, currently I'm using pots, but like both of you, I would prefer beds and I plan to move to at least a four by four or maybe hopefully a four by eight in the near future.
[13:19.420 --> 13:34.340]  I started like John in tens and fifteens and I kind of moved my way down actually and tried to experiment to see what I could do for my space.
[13:34.340 --> 13:37.620]  So tens and fifteens ended up being a little too big for me.
[13:37.620 --> 13:44.180]  So I've worked my way down to five sevens that I top dress and maintain throughout cycles.
[13:44.180 --> 13:48.100]  I've gotten to a pretty good rhythm of what I'm working with.
[13:48.180 --> 13:52.420]  So fives and sevens and then ones in my nurseries.
[13:53.300 --> 14:01.940]  Okay. And I've used. So I've been using the Sohum Living Soil, which I've been running in the seven gallon containers.
[14:01.940 --> 14:04.420]  I was going to say Subcool would say seven's the way to go.
[14:04.420 --> 14:07.460]  He always said seven gallons, seven gallons with the Super Soil.
[14:08.260 --> 14:09.220]  Definitely. Yeah.
[14:10.100 --> 14:11.700]  It's working good for me.
[14:11.700 --> 14:13.940]  I did do on this last run.
[14:13.940 --> 14:17.060]  I went a little bit longer with veg just because I was gone.
[14:17.060 --> 14:24.660]  So they got a little bit bigger and I did the top dressing with some Kiss Organic stuff, kind of like all in one.
[14:25.380 --> 14:26.500]  So that was nice.
[14:26.500 --> 14:30.020]  I didn't have to play mad scientist on that.
[14:30.020 --> 14:32.180]  I was just like, bam, here we go.
[14:33.220 --> 14:40.900]  But with top dressing, how long are you typically top dressing like ahead of when you're like
[14:40.900 --> 14:44.500]  anticipating a shortage or anticipating a need for some of that?
[14:44.980 --> 14:49.380]  You doing it the second that you see an issue or you got to plan ahead on that?
[14:50.500 --> 14:52.980]  Yeah, I try to plan ahead on that.
[14:52.980 --> 14:54.420]  Typically by two weeks.
[14:55.380 --> 14:56.500]  I'm in the five.
[14:56.500 --> 15:05.620]  So I've seen issues arise in the past that I've learned to time appropriately and cut things off in the past.
[15:06.500 --> 15:13.380]  With a combination of compost from a farm up here in Maine called Living Acres Farms.
[15:13.380 --> 15:14.340]  His name is Tony.
[15:14.340 --> 15:14.900]  He's great.
[15:14.900 --> 15:15.940]  They're out of New Sharon.
[15:17.060 --> 15:18.660]  Best compost that I've used.
[15:18.660 --> 15:21.940]  I got a couple of farmers from Minnesota who have tried it out.
[15:23.300 --> 15:24.980]  Some guys down in New Jersey.
[15:24.980 --> 15:27.220]  They say it's the best stuff they've used.
[15:27.220 --> 15:31.380]  It's a biologically complete, biodynamic compost.
[15:31.380 --> 15:37.460]  They also make a greenhouse soil mix, which is the best bag stuff that I do here in Maine,
[15:39.060 --> 15:42.420]  which is a compost based mix that they use their compost one in.
[15:43.540 --> 15:45.940]  A little bit of sphagnum peat from Maine.
[15:47.460 --> 15:48.180]  Regular peat.
[15:48.740 --> 15:51.300]  I try to be mindful of how much peat I use.
[15:51.300 --> 15:53.220]  So I do use another cocoa based soil.
[15:54.900 --> 15:59.300]  But also they use fish meal that they get from the coast of Maine in that mix.
[16:00.020 --> 16:04.660]  And that is pretty good for a water only mix for about six weeks.
[16:05.780 --> 16:13.140]  And you can talk to their compost, some stone dust, some KISS Organics at Hussey.
[16:14.340 --> 16:19.460]  And water into microbes and pretty much that's good to go.
[16:20.260 --> 16:23.220]  But I have respect for that farm out there.
[16:23.220 --> 16:23.860]  They're doing it right.
[16:24.980 --> 16:28.980]  And you're using the Organic Mechanics soil too, right?
[16:28.980 --> 16:30.020]  Give them a shout out there.
[16:32.500 --> 16:34.500]  Mark Hyland from Organics Mechanics.
[16:34.500 --> 16:35.300]  He's a great guy.
[16:36.020 --> 16:42.980]  So what I really like about Mark is that he won't use peat moss.
[16:43.700 --> 16:45.620]  And he doesn't use perlite as well.
[16:45.620 --> 16:46.820]  He uses rite hulls.
[16:47.940 --> 16:52.740]  And I like that because they break down and I believe they provide a little bit of silica over
[16:52.740 --> 16:53.240]  time.
[16:54.820 --> 16:59.620]  So the cocoa will fluff out the soil and give you a little bit more aeration.
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.580]  Which is really nice too.
[17:03.220 --> 17:05.780]  But they don't use bat guanos.
[17:05.780 --> 17:09.380]  They don't use seabird guanos, which I really appreciate because that's been known to be
[17:09.380 --> 17:10.660]  detrimental to the environment.
[17:11.540 --> 17:16.420]  Just the harvesting of the guanos because they don't get them.
[17:16.420 --> 17:17.540]  I mean it works great.
[17:17.540 --> 17:18.820]  I used to use bud swell.
[17:18.820 --> 17:20.340]  I used to use all the-
[17:20.340 --> 17:22.100]  Eagle 20 works great too.
[17:23.940 --> 17:25.380]  But I don't use it.
[17:28.180 --> 17:33.220]  But yeah, no, just it's nice to kind of raise awareness on some of these things.
[17:33.220 --> 17:40.180]  Because again, just because an ingredient might be organic or natural,
[17:40.660 --> 17:44.980]  there's other things to consider beyond just the label.
[17:44.980 --> 17:50.740]  And sustainable, regenerative, those are two things that a lot of people with this growing
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.260]  style are striving for.
[17:52.260 --> 18:00.500]  So when you're totally decimating one thing in the name of being sustainable, it's nice
[18:00.500 --> 18:01.380]  to put that out there.
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.980]  So OK, so try to stay away from the bat guanos or the seabird guanos and stuff like that.
[18:10.420 --> 18:10.920]  Yeah.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.280]  OK.
[18:13.860 --> 18:22.420]  And then I guess, John, for you, are you doing any kind of top dressing or do you just mix
[18:22.420 --> 18:26.820]  up the soil and the soil is going to carry you through and then you amend after the run?
[18:26.820 --> 18:28.260]  Or what are you doing there?
[18:29.060 --> 18:30.500]  I do a lot of top dressing.
[18:30.500 --> 18:36.500]  But intermittently, when I think that I'm going to need certain things or kind of, I
[18:36.500 --> 18:42.500]  wouldn't say crop steering, but it's definitely done with intent for, OK, building up a little
[18:42.500 --> 18:46.180]  calcium before flower or second week.
[18:46.180 --> 18:50.980]  Typically, I'll only top dress twice during flower and maybe once during...
[18:50.980 --> 19:00.740]  But I also use teas and all the other inoculants and sprouted seed tea, corn and malted barley,
[19:00.740 --> 19:04.020]  two row malted barley and grind that up.
[19:04.020 --> 19:10.500]  And so I'm constantly giving it stuff, but it also very slow, low measure, too.
[19:10.500 --> 19:14.340]  Like, I feel like I don't really know what the plant needs every time.
[19:14.340 --> 19:17.780]  Like, I'm not doing saturation paste tests or malic testing.
[19:18.500 --> 19:22.900]  That's what I want to get into that because then you really know what you can dial in.
[19:23.540 --> 19:28.980]  But like, just so we know, when you know about the plant, you know when things are timing,
[19:29.540 --> 19:32.740]  things, you know, I don't do a journal anymore.
[19:34.020 --> 19:35.460]  But that's a great thing.
[19:35.460 --> 19:38.740]  It's a great tool, too, because then it kind of gets you to figure out what you're doing
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.900]  and not changing too many variables.
[19:40.900 --> 19:44.020]  But, yeah, I use a lot of different things.
[19:44.020 --> 19:46.660]  And I top dress.
[19:46.660 --> 19:50.100]  I even use the, you know, like I'm schooled by Clackamas Coot, too.
[19:50.100 --> 19:55.220]  So I love like, you know, I do love that malted barley.
[19:55.220 --> 19:56.900]  I do like Karanja.
[19:56.900 --> 19:58.980]  I only put small amounts in, though, you know.
[19:59.460 --> 20:04.500]  And, you know, balance is the key.
[20:04.500 --> 20:05.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:05.300 --> 20:12.180]  I mean, it's, I'm watering in biology, almost every other watering, really.
[20:12.180 --> 20:17.620]  And it's only because, not because you necessarily need it, but just it's insurance.
[20:17.620 --> 20:20.260]  Like, that biology keeps everything healthy.
[20:20.260 --> 20:27.140]  I'm not saying it's going to, the healthier a plant is, it's amazing what they can withstand.
[20:27.140 --> 20:28.260]  Depending on the cultivar.
[20:28.980 --> 20:34.980]  And, you know, there might be ones that have more sensitivity to certain factors.
[20:34.980 --> 20:42.660]  But I'm always, I'm always trying to keep that biology zooming in there, because I feel like
[20:43.380 --> 20:45.300]  that's where all the magic is.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.380]  That's the gas pedal.
[20:47.380 --> 20:52.260]  Yeah, the more biology, the more things are going to be available to the plant, the better
[20:52.260 --> 20:52.820]  it can grow.
[20:53.460 --> 20:58.180]  And, you know, Chef had mentioned, too, just kind of by experience from repetition, by
[20:58.180 --> 21:02.660]  paying attention to your plants, you're able to anticipate these types of things.
[21:02.660 --> 21:06.420]  Because really, when you are top dressing, you have to anticipate.
[21:06.420 --> 21:09.620]  You can't be reactionary, otherwise you're already behind the ball.
[21:10.660 --> 21:13.220]  And experience is really the only way to get that.
[21:13.220 --> 21:15.620]  So that's why you got to pay attention.
[21:15.620 --> 21:16.180]  And that's good.
[21:16.740 --> 21:21.700]  One thing that you also mentioned, too, that, you know, originally, I don't know, old school,
[21:21.700 --> 21:23.060]  we learn new stuff all the time.
[21:23.060 --> 21:26.100]  And I definitely want to get to what you guys did last weekend.
[21:26.100 --> 21:26.820]  We'll get to that.
[21:28.420 --> 21:34.740]  But not necessarily, not companion planting, but having like a bed and having six or seven
[21:34.740 --> 21:37.700]  of the same, you know, cannabis strains in there.
[21:37.700 --> 21:41.380]  You wouldn't want to do, you know, multiple different strains, because if you're really
[21:41.380 --> 21:44.980]  trying to dial it in, you want feeding scheduling.
[21:44.980 --> 21:48.980]  But there has been some new stuff that I've read.
[21:48.980 --> 21:55.620]  And maybe it's just new to me, but plants will actually perform better in a shared bed.
[21:55.620 --> 21:58.660]  And I thought that was kind of wild, because I thought, you know, one would be trying to
[21:58.660 --> 21:59.460]  steal from the other.
[21:59.460 --> 22:03.460]  So there's going to be like the Hercules and then like the little guy.
[22:03.460 --> 22:07.220]  But yeah, aren't we always taught, like when we were growing, at least I was, that the
[22:07.220 --> 22:10.740]  plants strangle each other and you can't plant them together because they're going to, you
[22:10.740 --> 22:12.420]  know, outcompete each other or whatever.
[22:12.420 --> 22:16.020]  But it's kind of a marvelous thing that happens with these plants.
[22:16.020 --> 22:17.140]  It happens outside, too.
[22:17.140 --> 22:22.660]  We don't necessarily stop to think about it, but they grow in harmony with each other.
[22:22.660 --> 22:26.580]  Like, I mean, there are some that obviously there's choke vines and other things, but
[22:27.860 --> 22:30.900]  as far as cannabis goes, though, as far as cannabis.
[22:31.460 --> 22:32.420]  They love each other.
[22:33.700 --> 22:35.060]  They're so hippie.
[22:35.060 --> 22:36.340]  Damn cannabis plants.
[22:38.260 --> 22:45.780]  But yeah, that's, you know, and I've not done multiples here just because, again, it's small
[22:45.780 --> 22:50.580]  and I don't have beds, but at the commercial facility, yeah, we had it was nothing but,
[22:50.580 --> 22:56.340]  you know, beds and six to seven plants in every container, every room.
[22:56.340 --> 23:00.180]  So I thought they were they were a little bit crazy in the first place.
[23:00.180 --> 23:02.900]  And that was just another thing I thought they were a little crazy for.
[23:02.900 --> 23:08.020]  But some of these things, as time has gone by, I'm like, I get it now.
[23:09.780 --> 23:15.060]  Have either of you guys had the opportunity to kind of work commercially or at least see
[23:15.700 --> 23:17.220]  some of the commercial practices?
[23:17.220 --> 23:22.420]  Because, I mean, again, they're probably not growing the way that you want to see, but
[23:24.020 --> 23:24.900]  many ways to do it.
[23:24.900 --> 23:25.300]  I don't know.
[23:25.300 --> 23:26.980]  Have either of you guys had that experience?
[23:28.500 --> 23:33.300]  Well, so I used to work at a dispensary that I was the chef at.
[23:34.180 --> 23:35.140]  I worked in the kitchen.
[23:36.180 --> 23:43.300]  More recently, I've been working with an awesome family that is taking the task of converting a
[23:44.260 --> 23:46.340]  cocoa grow to a living soil greenhouse.
[23:47.060 --> 23:50.740]  And to see that transformation has just a beautiful.
[23:51.540 --> 23:52.100]  Wow.
[23:52.100 --> 23:52.660]  Thank you.
[23:52.660 --> 23:53.460]  Part of the team.
[23:53.460 --> 23:57.140]  Shout out to Joel at Aquanaut and the rest of the team there.
[23:57.140 --> 23:57.860]  They're killing it.
[23:59.060 --> 24:01.300]  They're really putting boots to the ground.
[24:02.900 --> 24:04.580]  And these beds are beautiful.
[24:04.580 --> 24:07.460]  They're filled with local main soil that's cut with biochar.
[24:08.260 --> 24:10.740]  And I believe two or three percent.
[24:11.700 --> 24:19.220]  And yeah, there's 2,000 square foot greenhouses that they are just about
[24:20.100 --> 24:22.100]  two thirds of the way done finishing up.
[24:22.100 --> 24:23.780]  So very proud of this team.
[24:25.140 --> 24:26.340]  Yeah, that's exciting.
[24:26.340 --> 24:27.940]  And that's a commitment.
[24:27.940 --> 24:34.180]  A lot of any businesses, agriculture too, they want something new, but they want it to be proven,
[24:34.180 --> 24:36.580]  which is hard to do.
[24:37.380 --> 24:43.140]  But that's a really scary jump for somebody who's in that kind of position.
[24:43.140 --> 24:47.060]  Was there anything that maybe inspired them to do it?
[24:47.060 --> 24:51.380]  Or have they just been on the fence and finally decided, you know, let's go that way?
[24:53.300 --> 24:57.060]  So I actually met them at the regenerative conference in March.
[24:57.700 --> 25:00.260]  Here in Maine up at Nature Summit.
[25:00.260 --> 25:01.620]  Shout out Nature Summit as well.
[25:02.260 --> 25:13.380]  So they were looking for a place to take over and they were shopping around for
[25:14.180 --> 25:15.140]  different locations.
[25:15.140 --> 25:18.980]  And this one ended up being what they set their heart out on.
[25:18.980 --> 25:25.140]  And yeah, to see how far they've come in a short amount of time, not even quite a year,
[25:25.860 --> 25:28.020]  is just remarkable, really.
[25:28.020 --> 25:28.520]  Yeah.
[25:29.940 --> 25:31.780]  Well, that's cool.
[25:31.780 --> 25:34.740]  And a lot of us too, we've been doing this for a while.
[25:35.460 --> 25:37.860]  We all have grand plans that we'd like to do.
[25:37.860 --> 25:38.580]  We'd like to see.
[25:38.580 --> 25:44.740]  I mean, I've got my hybrid facility already like spec'd out down to the power outlets.
[25:45.540 --> 25:47.220]  It's in a file down there.
[25:47.940 --> 25:48.900]  Maybe it'll happen.
[25:48.900 --> 25:49.780]  Maybe it won't.
[25:49.780 --> 25:50.820]  But yeah.
[25:50.820 --> 25:52.820]  No, you need to say, bro, you need to say you will.
[25:52.820 --> 25:55.380]  You can't mess this up unless you say you're going to do it.
[25:55.940 --> 25:57.300]  I believe in you, bro.
[25:57.300 --> 25:58.580]  I'll help you any way you can.
[25:58.580 --> 26:01.780]  Honestly, that's what it is about manifesting.
[26:01.780 --> 26:05.300]  It's about pursuing this passion and not giving up.
[26:07.060 --> 26:07.460]  Yeah.
[26:07.460 --> 26:08.500]  No, 100%.
[26:08.500 --> 26:09.300]  I appreciate that.
[26:09.300 --> 26:09.860]  I like that.
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.420]  Thank you.
[26:10.420 --> 26:11.060]  I am.
[26:11.060 --> 26:13.060]  You know, I started looking at licenses.
[26:13.060 --> 26:17.620]  I started looking at licenses again a couple of weeks ago.
[26:17.620 --> 26:21.700]  I got a friend from Amsterdam who actually was like, I'm coming.
[26:21.700 --> 26:22.580]  We need a license.
[26:25.140 --> 26:25.860]  It would be nice.
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.340]  So yes, I am looking at those things.
[26:28.340 --> 26:29.220]  Hopefully that turns out.
[26:29.220 --> 26:31.220]  Make it work, gentlemen.
[26:31.220 --> 26:32.020]  Yes.
[26:32.020 --> 26:32.420]  Yes.
[26:32.420 --> 26:33.940]  Let's make it work.
[26:33.940 --> 26:39.860]  So you just kind of touched on what you did in the kitchen, Chef.
[26:39.860 --> 26:41.060]  Can you tell us a little bit more?
[26:41.060 --> 26:43.940]  Because from what I hear is you're not the average bear.
[26:43.940 --> 26:46.100]  You've done this a couple of times?
[26:47.700 --> 26:48.020]  Yeah.
[26:48.020 --> 26:52.660]  Well, so I'm not just a cannabis chef, I guess.
[26:52.660 --> 26:55.780]  I've been doing this for about 20 years.
[26:57.620 --> 27:00.420]  I started as a teenager in the kitchen.
[27:00.420 --> 27:06.500]  And as a young man, prior to my son being born, I enrolled in culinary school.
[27:07.220 --> 27:15.460]  And I've been working in the restaurant industry up until about four, five years ago when I
[27:16.500 --> 27:18.740]  kind of transitioned into the cannabis industry.
[27:19.300 --> 27:28.900]  And I have worked on several projects and have more recently been consecutively winning awards.
[27:29.860 --> 27:36.660]  So I've been together to chase them together.
[27:37.380 --> 27:37.860]  Yeah.
[27:37.860 --> 27:41.700]  Now, do you have like a preference or a specialty?
[27:41.700 --> 27:44.820]  Like, are you like, I'm the hard candy guy?
[27:44.820 --> 27:46.820]  Or do you like to spread it all around?
[27:47.780 --> 27:49.140]  What do you make in the kitchen?
[27:52.980 --> 27:58.100]  So for edibles, I have one.
[27:59.060 --> 28:00.820]  So I wouldn't be the hard candy guy.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.420]  I guess I would be the caramel guy.
[28:03.540 --> 28:07.300]  I've won first place awards for my caramel.
[28:08.100 --> 28:15.540]  And that is a Celtic seed salt and aged Scottish whiskey made with organic cane sugar, tapioca
[28:15.540 --> 28:18.820]  syrup instead of corn syrup.
[28:18.820 --> 28:21.860]  I don't use any high fructose corn syrup or anything like that.
[28:22.580 --> 28:24.020]  That's also organic.
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.100]  Well, as local made butter.
[28:28.980 --> 28:35.620]  So I try to make sure I'm putting the highest quality ingredients into everything I do along
[28:35.620 --> 28:37.220]  every step of the way, starting from-
[28:37.220 --> 28:38.900]  Don't forget the real vanilla.
[28:38.900 --> 28:40.100]  Remember Cheddar Bob was like-
[28:41.380 --> 28:42.260]  Oh yeah.
[28:42.260 --> 28:44.660]  Cheddar Bob asked me at the Regen conference.
[28:44.660 --> 28:46.740]  He held up the caramel, hope he's watching.
[28:46.740 --> 28:48.420]  He said, what'd you use?
[28:49.940 --> 28:51.460]  I said, vanilla bean.
[28:51.460 --> 28:53.780]  And he was like, ah, no extract.
[28:53.780 --> 28:54.660]  All right.
[28:54.660 --> 28:58.820]  And you know, coming from him, that really meant a lot because he chopped me up and he
[28:58.820 --> 29:00.180]  said, you know, I used to work out.
[29:02.020 --> 29:05.060]  It wasn't, I don't believe it could have been the French laundry.
[29:05.060 --> 29:05.940]  I believe it was.
[29:06.500 --> 29:07.460]  Could be wrong.
[29:07.460 --> 29:09.860]  If it is wrong, sorry Cheddar Bob.
[29:09.860 --> 29:13.700]  But you know, that like kind of blew my mind to hear the props from him.
[29:13.700 --> 29:17.620]  So, but I also make baklava.
[29:17.620 --> 29:18.900]  Okay.
[29:18.900 --> 29:25.380]  And that was inspired by Peter Papadopoulos, Turk Tower Invitational.
[29:27.540 --> 29:29.300]  That was a family thing that his grandmother-
[29:32.100 --> 29:35.220]  My Stroopwafel, shout out to Amsterdam.
[29:35.220 --> 29:37.140]  Shout out to Amsterdam over there.
[29:37.620 --> 29:40.100]  So that one-
[29:40.100 --> 29:45.060]  That praline he put in there is like even better than the caramel, honestly.
[29:45.060 --> 29:45.620]  It is like-
[29:47.300 --> 29:47.860]  Well, I had-
[29:47.860 --> 29:50.820]  I've had some Nutella Stroopwafels too.
[29:52.660 --> 29:53.940]  So it was, okay.
[29:53.940 --> 29:56.420]  So it was kind of similar to that.
[29:56.420 --> 29:59.700]  So I made a praline.
[29:59.700 --> 30:06.340]  I toasted up cashews, hazelnuts, almonds, and pecans.
[30:06.900 --> 30:10.340]  And then I made a hard crack praline with that.
[30:10.340 --> 30:14.900]  And I buzzed it up in the fruit processor until it was a smooth caramel.
[30:14.900 --> 30:19.940]  But then I made a little caramel on the side instead of the Stroop filling.
[30:19.940 --> 30:21.620]  And I buzzed that in with it.
[30:21.620 --> 30:25.300]  And that was the smooth, smooth praline filling for the Stroopwafel.
[30:25.300 --> 30:29.220]  So that took first place at the Boston Mecan.
[30:29.780 --> 30:35.300]  And that I really, really feel proud of because that was one out of 55 entries
[30:36.100 --> 30:37.060]  in that category.
[30:38.180 --> 30:40.260]  And he made the Stroopwafels himself too, dude.
[30:40.260 --> 30:41.380]  You made your own batter.
[30:41.380 --> 30:42.820]  You made your own waffles.
[30:43.700 --> 30:43.860]  Yeah.
[30:43.860 --> 30:45.620]  I found my grandfather's press.
[30:47.700 --> 30:49.540]  My grandfather had an old press.
[30:49.540 --> 30:53.460]  I used it for Italian cookies, but I used it to make the Stroopwafels.
[30:54.980 --> 30:56.580]  I'm coming to your house, man.
[30:57.700 --> 30:58.580]  I'm coming for breakfast.
[30:58.580 --> 31:00.180]  Dutch Blooms, Kevin Jodry.
[31:01.460 --> 31:04.100]  You gave them out all to those people at the region.
[31:04.660 --> 31:08.500]  You made some little half Stroopwafels to give out.
[31:08.500 --> 31:11.860]  And I think even Dutch was like, this is some of the best bioavailable.
[31:13.940 --> 31:14.180]  Yeah.
[31:14.180 --> 31:15.140]  We got so...
[31:15.140 --> 31:15.380]  Yeah.
[31:15.380 --> 31:15.860]  Everyone was...
[31:16.980 --> 31:17.540]  ...words.
[31:17.540 --> 31:20.180]  And Dutch said that to Shango Los.
[31:20.180 --> 31:21.940]  Shango Los chimed in and Dutch said,
[31:23.460 --> 31:27.300]  Shango, this chef makes the most bioavailable edibles that I've ever had.
[31:27.300 --> 31:28.020]  And you know that?
[31:28.020 --> 31:29.140]  Wow.
[31:29.140 --> 31:32.740]  Another awesome compliment that really blew my mind there.
[31:33.700 --> 31:34.180]  Yeah.
[31:34.180 --> 31:34.420]  Yeah.
[31:34.420 --> 31:38.260]  You might've remembered him when he won out there at the Auto Flower Cup with the caramel.
[31:39.860 --> 31:44.340]  That was the first win for the caramel, but then it won the Portland Meek and
[31:45.300 --> 31:50.180]  when I came back to the East Coast the same year in the fall of 2021.
[31:50.180 --> 31:52.260]  Wow.
[31:52.260 --> 31:52.500]  So...
[31:52.500 --> 31:52.980]  So real.
[31:52.980 --> 31:53.540]  ...in the last...
[31:56.660 --> 32:02.340]  ...in the last just year and a half, I've won five first place awards and one second place award.
[32:03.460 --> 32:05.140]  Dude, congratulations.
[32:06.740 --> 32:07.700]  Thank you very much.
[32:07.700 --> 32:08.580]  Congratulations.
[32:08.580 --> 32:13.940]  And I'm not surprised and I'll tell you why in a second, but Stroopwafel, Raymond.
[32:13.940 --> 32:19.780]  So it's a very thin, I don't want to say pancake, I want to say more of like a crepe,
[32:19.780 --> 32:25.380]  very thin layer and then you put a layer of whatever you want in the middle,
[32:25.380 --> 32:28.020]  put another one on top and then you eat it.
[32:28.020 --> 32:28.900]  It's kind of like a...
[32:29.620 --> 32:33.700]  can be like a waffle cone from where you get it, but the ones in Amsterdam are more
[32:34.500 --> 32:39.780]  of a batter than like a real waffle cone, but that's kind of what a Stroopwafel is.
[32:39.780 --> 32:43.140]  So it's like a really thin pressed cookie and you just...
[32:44.820 --> 32:50.020]  It's good stuff, but I'm sure, Chef, you could probably make them in all kinds of forms though.
[32:52.740 --> 32:57.940]  They like to leave it on top of their coffee in Amsterdam to warm it up in both sides.
[32:58.900 --> 33:00.900]  So it's kind of like a Stroop in the middle of the...
[33:00.900 --> 33:02.900]  I like this.
[33:02.900 --> 33:07.540]  ... but it's more like a molasses based traditionally.
[33:09.060 --> 33:10.660]  Yeah, this is good stuff.
[33:11.620 --> 33:18.580]  But back to the point of why I'm not surprised why you have a lot of wins over these last
[33:18.580 --> 33:19.780]  couple of years.
[33:19.780 --> 33:22.340]  And side note, I know you guys are in Boston.
[33:22.340 --> 33:25.940]  You went to Boston when I saw Danny Danko like the post today and I'm like,
[33:25.940 --> 33:28.820]  Danko, he knows you guys.
[33:28.820 --> 33:30.660]  He's seen you on the winning podiums.
[33:30.660 --> 33:31.940]  He's like, yeah, they're cool.
[33:31.940 --> 33:33.540]  I like this dude's post.
[33:33.540 --> 33:39.940]  But it goes back to kind of what I see in a lot of John's growing style.
[33:41.940 --> 33:46.180]  And this is kind of what I'm hearing from you as far as the ingredients you choose to
[33:46.180 --> 33:46.500]  use.
[33:46.500 --> 33:48.180]  You're not cutting corners.
[33:48.180 --> 33:52.500]  You're going to do something that may take you an hour that may take somebody else 10
[33:52.500 --> 33:52.900]  minutes.
[33:53.620 --> 33:59.700]  But you taste that hour dedication in it and you taste that hour dedication in his products
[33:59.700 --> 34:00.100]  as well.
[34:00.740 --> 34:07.940]  So it's really to me, it sounds like not cutting corners and just using the best of the best.
[34:07.940 --> 34:12.740]  Again, Cheddar Bob even got on the comments and saying your guys's praises.
[34:12.740 --> 34:15.380]  Speaking of holy shit, he's like, all these guys are great.
[34:15.380 --> 34:16.500]  Can't wait to see it.
[34:16.500 --> 34:19.300]  So yeah, you guys are doing something right up there.
[34:19.860 --> 34:25.860]  But is that really kind of a conscious effort or is it just happened to turn out that way?
[34:26.900 --> 34:28.820]  Are you willing to take longer?
[34:31.940 --> 34:36.420]  I'm going to take the rest of my life because I'm always learning.
[34:36.420 --> 34:45.540]  And that's one thing as I have been learning is first as a chef, it's like you have to
[34:45.540 --> 34:46.340]  know your costs.
[34:46.420 --> 34:48.980]  And that's the most important thing.
[34:48.980 --> 34:53.700]  So like coming into it, it was like, okay, how can I do the most cost efficient?
[34:54.260 --> 34:58.100]  And as I've been going, it's like, I don't want it to be the cheapest.
[34:58.100 --> 35:02.580]  This is for me, for my medicine and for my family and for their medicine.
[35:03.140 --> 35:09.060]  It has to be not only, you know, I have to afford it, but it has to be the cleanest and
[35:09.060 --> 35:12.740]  it has to be the safest and it has to be wholesome.
[35:13.540 --> 35:17.620]  You know, so these are things that I take into consideration every step along the way
[35:17.620 --> 35:23.620]  from not just the cooking aspect, but from the growing aspect and not just from the ingredients
[35:23.620 --> 35:28.420]  of the food aspect, but of my soil ingredients too.
[35:28.420 --> 35:33.940]  You know, whatever I can get, I'm going to buy not because it's the most expensive, but
[35:33.940 --> 35:38.020]  because it's the best that I can get for what I have.
[35:38.020 --> 35:43.140]  And it's going to work the best for me because I crafted it that way.
[35:44.340 --> 35:48.660]  It's medicine, both aspects, food is medicine.
[35:49.460 --> 35:52.260]  The plant is medicine together.
[35:54.900 --> 36:02.100]  I use my old soil in my vegetable garden and I grow the biggest, juiciest vegetables and
[36:02.100 --> 36:03.380]  herbs and flowers.
[36:03.780 --> 36:13.460]  And I've given these tomatoes to elderly neighbors that have been eating tomatoes for 60 years
[36:13.460 --> 36:18.740]  that say they don't put salt or pepper or anything on it because of how juicy and delicious
[36:18.740 --> 36:19.300]  they are.
[36:19.300 --> 36:25.460]  I think that's just a testament to, you know, all of this together wrapped into one.
[36:26.900 --> 36:28.260]  Do you do any, you know,
[36:28.900 --> 36:32.660]  I'm sorry, please go ahead.
[36:32.660 --> 36:33.620]  My audio cut out.
[36:34.260 --> 36:35.460]  Please continue your thought there.
[36:38.900 --> 36:46.580]  It's not all about you have to grow organic because I'm not saying that people who don't
[36:46.580 --> 36:48.260]  grow organic are doing it wrong.
[36:48.260 --> 36:52.660]  It's that, it's that, that's what works for me and that's what's best for me and my family.
[36:53.380 --> 36:58.020]  But like I said earlier, I'm just glad that anybody wants to be growing this plant and
[36:58.020 --> 36:59.060]  I encourage it fully.
[36:59.060 --> 36:59.460]  Sure.
[37:01.860 --> 37:03.220]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[37:03.220 --> 37:05.380]  And I've, I got sidetracked here.
[37:05.380 --> 37:11.140]  I had a follow up question, but I got sidetracked by a Dehota Erb who is a man who would definitely
[37:11.140 --> 37:15.300]  know, but he says, John has a magic bag of a hundred smells at every show.
[37:16.660 --> 37:19.220]  So I'm stopping by Chef's for breakfast.
[37:19.220 --> 37:20.900]  And then I'm meeting John at the show.
[37:22.980 --> 37:23.620]  Likewise.
[37:24.660 --> 37:24.980]  Yeah.
[37:24.980 --> 37:26.820]  So Dehota Erb, y'all know him.
[37:26.820 --> 37:28.260]  Been putting in work for a long time.
[37:28.260 --> 37:34.500]  I first met him just going to smoke, I think I said in our first interview and, and he's a,
[37:34.500 --> 37:37.140]  you know, mad love and respect for him and what he's doing.
[37:37.140 --> 37:42.260]  And if you don't follow him, Dehota Erb, you know, we're going to be on his show next.
[37:42.260 --> 37:44.180]  So sorry, Chad, but.
[37:45.460 --> 37:48.420]  No, dude, I would love, I would love to see that.
[37:48.420 --> 37:51.220]  But like, no, I'm just being silly.
[37:51.220 --> 37:51.780]  I'm just being.
[37:52.500 --> 37:53.940]  No, I would love to see that.
[37:53.940 --> 37:59.940]  You know, I see him at all the shows and love hanging out and talking with him.
[37:59.940 --> 38:01.940]  Very, very great human being.
[38:01.940 --> 38:07.140]  He does have a Thursday show on the FCPO2 channel, usually about six o'clock on the
[38:07.140 --> 38:09.300]  West Coast, nine on the East Coast.
[38:09.300 --> 38:12.980]  So I would love to see three Mainers get together.
[38:12.980 --> 38:14.180]  That's another thing I've seen.
[38:14.180 --> 38:17.460]  A lot of people have reached out to me from that area.
[38:17.460 --> 38:20.660]  I'm, you know, I'm on the West Coast, so I don't know a lot of people on the East Coast,
[38:20.660 --> 38:23.700]  but the few that I do have all reached out like these guys.
[38:23.700 --> 38:25.700]  Yeah, they're doing their thing.
[38:26.420 --> 38:31.860]  There's so many people that we know that we're just like, there's so many wonderful
[38:31.860 --> 38:32.740]  growers in Maine.
[38:33.300 --> 38:44.260]  I mean, shout out to Sticky Richie and also Jason over at Cadenetic Sun Grown.
[38:44.260 --> 38:45.460]  Like there's people out here.
[38:45.780 --> 38:52.340]  I guess they're going to see Blue Great Tank, all these people.
[38:52.340 --> 38:52.900]  They're killing it.
[38:52.900 --> 38:53.460]  They're killing it.
[38:53.460 --> 38:54.180]  You know what I mean?
[38:54.180 --> 38:58.260]  Like, I don't want to leave people out because Nature Summit, all these people that we're
[38:58.260 --> 39:02.340]  finally meeting and now embracing, finding our family, finding the tribe.
[39:03.860 --> 39:04.980]  You know, there's no joke.
[39:04.980 --> 39:06.420]  This is East Coast.
[39:06.420 --> 39:11.060]  We're growing some fire over here and, you know, don't sleep on the East Coast.
[39:11.860 --> 39:13.780]  No, we're definitely not sleeping on it.
[39:13.780 --> 39:15.060]  We're definitely not sleeping on it.
[39:15.060 --> 39:20.020]  I've learned my lesson with Michigan, with all the genetics and stuff coming from Michigan
[39:20.020 --> 39:21.300]  over the last couple of years.
[39:21.300 --> 39:27.060]  Because again, on the West Coast, living in the Pacific Northwest, I'm over 40.
[39:27.060 --> 39:32.180]  I've been smoking weed for a long time and I proudly can say I've never touched brick.
[39:32.180 --> 39:32.580]  Why?
[39:32.580 --> 39:34.580]  Because I lived in the Pacific Northwest.
[39:34.580 --> 39:36.900]  We just have good weed.
[39:38.420 --> 39:40.900]  But yeah, some of these things that have come out of Michigan.
[39:40.900 --> 39:43.380]  And again, you know, it's kind of legalization.
[39:43.380 --> 39:48.100]  People are able to hop out and, you know, in front of their grows or in front of a camera
[39:48.100 --> 39:50.260]  or put themselves out there, really.
[39:51.300 --> 39:53.700]  So I'm expecting to see some stuff from your area.
[39:53.700 --> 39:57.300]  But do either of you guys, I'm sorry, John, I left you on the big screen there.
[39:57.300 --> 39:58.900]  I just dig the background.
[39:58.900 --> 40:01.300]  I'm just like, yeah, we'll get a tour here in a second.
[40:01.300 --> 40:01.800]  Yeah.
[40:02.260 --> 40:03.140]  Do I still look high?
[40:03.220 --> 40:14.340]  You know, are there any maybe breeders or any specific genetics that you guys have seen
[40:14.340 --> 40:19.700]  or worked with that maybe haven't made it my way yet to the West Coast?
[40:19.700 --> 40:23.620]  We got, oh boy, he's rolling the fatty right there.
[40:23.620 --> 40:24.260]  What is that?
[40:26.980 --> 40:31.300]  Well, I was, you know, before you say that haven't made it your way, I had to retract
[40:31.300 --> 40:38.420]  because this is some awesome ganja rebel Dan, Natty Bumpo.
[40:38.420 --> 40:41.780]  I saw a pot of herb popped up on the comment there a few minutes.
[40:42.340 --> 40:46.580]  And I know he was growing the Natty Bumpo not too long ago, but this is some straight
[40:46.580 --> 40:46.980]  gas.
[40:48.340 --> 40:48.840]  Beautiful.
[40:53.380 --> 40:54.500]  Beautiful colors too.
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.780]  Beautiful, beautiful bag.
[40:56.340 --> 40:57.220]  Very much so.
[40:57.220 --> 41:00.100]  I believe it's the OOG Chem.
[41:00.900 --> 41:06.580]  I haven't smelled the yellow 5G sour, but everything that I've read about the OOG Chem,
[41:06.580 --> 41:08.260]  this seems to check those boxes.
[41:08.260 --> 41:10.980]  So definitely some fire too, man.
[41:10.980 --> 41:14.340]  Some stuff from the East Coast that you may not have seen that way.
[41:17.540 --> 41:22.420]  Yeah, I think maybe some Copa genetics or even some Cape.
[41:22.980 --> 41:27.370]  Hmm, Copa genetics.
[41:27.370 --> 41:32.090]  Cape Medic sun grown's got some acclimated beans and sticky rich.
[41:34.810 --> 41:35.850]  Yeah, definitely.
[41:37.130 --> 41:37.450]  Okay.
[41:38.090 --> 41:41.290]  And John, you're kind of nodding in agreement down there.
[41:41.290 --> 41:42.330]  You're like, yeah.
[41:42.330 --> 41:44.490]  Those, those are, you know, they're putting in work.
[41:44.490 --> 41:50.010]  They're really doing some, you know, climatizing these strains so that we, these cultivars
[41:50.010 --> 41:52.890]  so that, you know, they work here and finish.
[41:53.690 --> 41:56.490]  Dude, that is important.
[41:56.490 --> 42:00.490]  You know, you guys mentioned Dutch blooms earlier and I mentioned Pacific Northwest.
[42:00.490 --> 42:05.450]  He's, he's up in this, in this area and yeah, we've got a unique climate.
[42:05.450 --> 42:11.450]  Like I don't grow outside because really I can't with the environment that I have where
[42:11.450 --> 42:13.050]  I'm at, but he makes it work.
[42:13.050 --> 42:16.570]  And that is one of his things is he's, he's been looking for strains that will handle
[42:16.570 --> 42:17.130]  the PM.
[42:17.130 --> 42:20.810]  They're going to handle the, you know, 20 inches of September rain.
[42:21.290 --> 42:27.450]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's ridiculous, but you do, you gotta, you gotta do that.
[42:27.450 --> 42:31.770]  And that's cool that you guys not only are a working with like local soil.
[42:31.770 --> 42:38.410]  So that's kind of, you know, the, the, the local micro organisms in there, but also working
[42:38.410 --> 42:44.090]  with local breeders to find things that are going to strive and succeed in the outdoor
[42:44.090 --> 42:46.650]  environment, which is far less controlled.
[42:47.450 --> 42:52.970]  Do you guys have anything in particular you know, chef, you mentioned IPM a little bit
[42:52.970 --> 43:00.330]  earlier, but are there any, you know, sprays or organic tricks, anything that you do for
[43:00.330 --> 43:01.610]  an IPM regimen?
[43:05.860 --> 43:12.580]  So outside, not so much other than labs that I do like to spray on the plants during veg.
[43:13.300 --> 43:20.740]  That seems a little bit preventing PM from coming on and giving, giving the plants some
[43:20.740 --> 43:25.860]  good cells, cell strength and microbial inoculation there.
[43:26.580 --> 43:33.140]  But I also root drench it and inside I try not to spray anything on my plants and flower,
[43:33.780 --> 43:38.260]  but I will use something like Dr. Zimes.
[43:39.060 --> 43:39.560]  Okay.
[43:41.300 --> 43:47.300]  Or like Lost Coast Plant Therapy, there's ways to make all this stuff yourself as well.
[43:48.660 --> 43:54.420]  You get recipes online easily, something that you could find to save you some money instead
[43:54.420 --> 44:01.700]  of using these products, you could a recipe for a citrus ferment where you would ferment
[44:01.780 --> 44:12.100]  citrus peels and add some yeast and some vinegar after it's done.
[44:13.060 --> 44:19.060]  You can dilute that and that's essentially the same thing as like Dr. Zimes stuff that
[44:19.060 --> 44:22.100]  they're selling you for a lot more money than that.
[44:22.980 --> 44:29.220]  And the same thing goes for like Lost Coast Therapy that's also very expensive for a bottle
[44:29.220 --> 44:30.820]  at the store or online.
[44:31.380 --> 44:37.860]  You can make that yourself with either like a JWA, which is a KNF prep as your base or
[44:37.860 --> 44:39.380]  like a castile soap.
[44:40.100 --> 44:41.700]  And then you can add like peppermint oil.
[44:44.020 --> 44:48.740]  And a little isopropyl alcohol and some corn oil.
[44:49.380 --> 44:54.900]  The oil-based sprays though, again, I try not to spray anything at all in the flower,
[44:55.460 --> 45:00.020]  but if you're going to use an oil-based spray, I recommend using that only during the vegetative
[45:00.020 --> 45:00.900]  stage.
[45:00.900 --> 45:09.620]  That way the residues don't affect the taste of the flower or your turps with your trichomes
[45:09.620 --> 45:10.420]  or anything like that.
[45:11.220 --> 45:19.860]  So if you're going to use a different spray in flower, try to not use the oils and also
[45:19.860 --> 45:22.100]  try not to spray if you can.
[45:22.100 --> 45:26.180]  And the oils, you know, the oils will help suffocate things.
[45:26.180 --> 45:29.060]  I know Mammoth Pea had their kind of natural control.
[45:29.060 --> 45:39.140]  It was just a couple of different corn oils, a couple other oils, but the plant therapy,
[45:40.180 --> 45:41.460]  gosh, I forget the name of it now.
[45:42.820 --> 45:44.820]  But yeah, you know, that works the citrus peels.
[45:44.820 --> 45:45.300]  That's what I'm saying.
[45:45.300 --> 45:46.420]  The fermented citrus peels, limonene.
[45:46.420 --> 45:49.860]  The citric acid is the commonality in most of those products, you know.
[45:50.500 --> 45:54.180]  And then the vinegar would probably change the PM.
[45:54.180 --> 45:54.980]  Is it EPM?
[45:54.980 --> 45:55.460]  EPM.
[45:55.460 --> 45:55.860]  I'm sorry.
[45:56.660 --> 45:57.940]  We just met that guy too.
[45:59.460 --> 46:00.180]  I don't know if that's.
[46:01.140 --> 46:01.940]  EPM.
[46:01.940 --> 46:02.660]  It's like EDM.
[46:03.860 --> 46:06.260]  But it's all citric acid is the primary.
[46:06.260 --> 46:13.620]  Yeah, the vinegar with the PM, the big thing with the, it's just changing the environment
[46:13.620 --> 46:14.900]  of the surface of the leaf.
[46:14.900 --> 46:20.500]  So like the PM can't actually exist because it's not comfortable for it, right?
[46:21.620 --> 46:26.900]  And same for the bugs, like it's too volatile for their soft bodies to.
[46:27.460 --> 46:27.860]  Yeah.
[46:27.860 --> 46:36.020]  And then, you know, outside with the no spring, really a diverse like cover crop or soil area
[46:36.020 --> 46:41.300]  to where you have all these other like indigenous plants or, you know, whatever.
[46:41.300 --> 46:46.340]  I don't really identify the weeds that are growing up, but I allow them to prolate with
[46:46.340 --> 46:46.900]  my plants.
[46:47.620 --> 46:55.700]  Their roots go down really deep and create like, like I can chop the weeds and top dress
[46:55.700 --> 46:56.820]  and mulch that.
[46:56.820 --> 47:04.500]  But then the roots are going down and creating air pockets in the soil for microbes and worms
[47:04.500 --> 47:06.980]  and the roots to dig through.
[47:06.980 --> 47:08.500]  So great information.
[47:10.260 --> 47:18.020]  But there's all this like natural IPM going on in that cover crops and there's all these
[47:18.580 --> 47:19.140]  big bugs.
[47:20.660 --> 47:22.500]  Even the bad small bugs.
[47:24.100 --> 47:26.420]  Soil, soil, food, web action there.
[47:27.220 --> 47:32.660]  Arthropods go after the nematodes and the protozoa and those are going after the bacterias
[47:32.660 --> 47:33.380]  and the micro.
[47:34.740 --> 47:36.100]  How about you, John?
[47:36.100 --> 47:42.580]  What are you doing as far as any kind of like IPM in the garden, indoor or out?
[47:43.780 --> 47:49.540]  I've well, I've actually had really good luck indoors, but I kind of attribute it more or
[47:49.540 --> 47:52.100]  less to like, I don't really spray anything more.
[47:52.100 --> 47:57.300]  I used to do foliar sprays and teas and stuff like that.
[47:57.300 --> 48:01.380]  I don't even do that in veg anymore.
[48:02.100 --> 48:11.300]  Pretty much water in my teas, or top dress with really good biological compost and soon
[48:11.300 --> 48:16.020]  to be my new worm compost because like Coot always said, it's you're not growing mine
[48:16.020 --> 48:17.540]  because you don't have my vermicompost.
[48:17.540 --> 48:21.780]  It's all in the, so I can't wait just to put that into use because I know all those
[48:21.780 --> 48:27.700]  guys like Blue doing all the avocado tech and all this stuff that that's where all
[48:27.700 --> 48:32.020]  the magic is in all of these interactions that we can't even, or we're just learning
[48:32.020 --> 48:34.580]  to explain or understand or not even understanding.
[48:34.580 --> 48:40.340]  But just finally getting the technology to see and then another 10 years, there'll be
[48:40.340 --> 48:42.420]  better technology and we'll see even deeper.
[48:43.620 --> 48:46.820]  Like we all have problems from time to time and you deal with them.
[48:47.140 --> 48:52.580]  I stopped using neem, although only because people were saying, oh, you don't want to
[48:52.580 --> 48:53.060]  do that.
[48:54.660 --> 48:56.180]  So I stopped using that.
[48:57.140 --> 49:02.260]  I really do pretty much what the chef was just talking about with the citric acid, those
[49:02.260 --> 49:05.620]  type of approaches, but I really haven't had to do much.
[49:06.660 --> 49:14.660]  And I really, I guess where I got away from it was that I use a UV lighting and I'm so
[49:14.660 --> 49:20.420]  happy to see Wolf Siegel going to be at this organic cultivators because yeah.
[49:20.420 --> 49:21.540]  And mixed media lighting.
[49:21.540 --> 49:27.140]  So the CMH also like, I don't want to, I don't, I'm trying to be as conservative with
[49:27.140 --> 49:29.700]  the electricity because that's another part of this.
[49:29.700 --> 49:34.820]  That's why I'm really striving to get out under the sun because the sun is where all
[49:34.820 --> 49:40.100]  the phyto cannabinoids, all those metabolites, that's where everything is created in the
[49:40.900 --> 49:41.700]  best medicine.
[49:42.260 --> 49:48.900]  And so kind of trying to do biomimicry with lighting indoors.
[49:51.140 --> 49:57.140]  When you listen to like Bruce, Bruce Bugbee, he's really a knowledgeable and a mad respect
[49:57.140 --> 49:58.740]  and he's taught me so much.
[49:58.740 --> 50:03.940]  But then there's kind of like Wolf Siegel with like, kind of more like Steiner or more
[50:03.940 --> 50:07.380]  like, hey, these rays, these, these are all pieces of information.
[50:07.380 --> 50:11.060]  And if we're not giving it the real sun, then we're not giving it all the information.
[50:11.700 --> 50:18.180]  And, and I really do think, and I use, I even use like Hortalex bulbs, T5s for my veg.
[50:18.180 --> 50:22.740]  I've been using them for a long, long time and they have that SFV UV bulb in there.
[50:22.740 --> 50:29.780]  I swear to God that that cuts down on, you know, not just fungus and mold, but like it
[50:29.780 --> 50:33.700]  definitely cuts down on even like fungus gnats or other predators.
[50:33.700 --> 50:36.260]  Not saying I don't have them because you, you know.
[50:36.740 --> 50:37.700]  You're organic.
[50:37.700 --> 50:39.060]  It comes with the territory.
[50:39.700 --> 50:40.020]  Yeah.
[50:40.020 --> 50:44.660]  So I really have been, knock on my bench here.
[50:45.780 --> 50:49.060]  I've been, you know, but when you, you have to deal with things when they arise.
[50:49.060 --> 50:52.660]  And as soon as you see something, you need to deal with it, you know?
[50:52.660 --> 50:56.020]  And sometimes, sometimes the better thing is just to throw the whole plant out.
[50:58.180 --> 51:00.100]  Like this goes back to companion planting.
[51:00.100 --> 51:02.820]  I had all my beautiful cuts in there and I got thrips.
[51:02.820 --> 51:03.700]  I don't know how I got it.
[51:03.700 --> 51:04.740]  It was the middle of the summertime.
[51:04.740 --> 51:09.540]  I'm so careful taking my shoes off, taking my clothes off, all those things that, you know,
[51:09.540 --> 51:12.900]  I don't bring stuff from outside indoors like you, you know, I mean, these are all these
[51:12.900 --> 51:17.380]  things because it's like not worth it to me, you know, like you can fight it and you can
[51:17.380 --> 51:22.980]  probably be successful, but why set yourself up for, you already have inundated with all
[51:22.980 --> 51:24.900]  the things you need to do in your garden.
[51:24.900 --> 51:30.100]  So I had these thrips on all my little solo cups and I'm like, oh man, and I was fighting
[51:30.100 --> 51:31.140]  it and I was fighting it.
[51:31.140 --> 51:32.100]  And I was like, you know what?
[51:32.100 --> 51:33.940]  My next plants are going to be bigger in time.
[51:34.740 --> 51:35.700]  I'm putting them outside.
[51:35.700 --> 51:42.580]  So I put four just in the 16 ounce solo cups in 10 gallon containers and I flowered them
[51:42.580 --> 51:42.820]  out.
[51:43.700 --> 51:49.460]  I was actually figuring out which was my stronger cultivars because what, you know, I could
[51:49.460 --> 51:54.260]  actually see which one got the mold, which got, they were too close together, but they
[51:54.260 --> 51:56.980]  bloomed and then the thrips were gone.
[51:56.980 --> 52:02.260]  So there's something being said about like nature taking its course and eradicating things
[52:02.260 --> 52:02.740]  indoors.
[52:02.740 --> 52:06.100]  It was a problem because there wasn't enough natural predators.
[52:06.100 --> 52:09.140]  Once they went outside, I didn't have to spray them with anything.
[52:09.140 --> 52:12.260]  They cleaned up on their own just from being out in the yard.
[52:12.260 --> 52:16.980]  And the only reason I put them in four in a container is because I didn't want my girlfriend
[52:16.980 --> 52:19.460]  being like, yeah, now you've got all these plants outside.
[52:19.460 --> 52:22.660]  And they're going everywhere.
[52:22.660 --> 52:22.900]  Right.
[52:22.900 --> 52:24.180]  I got a harvest off of them.
[52:24.180 --> 52:29.380]  But the only reason that I was getting PM is because there was not enough airflow, but
[52:30.500 --> 52:31.620]  they came back.
[52:31.620 --> 52:32.500]  They look beautiful.
[52:32.500 --> 52:38.660]  And I was like, oh man, this is, you know, so but yeah, I know I use, I do buy nematodes
[52:40.260 --> 52:44.580]  and I really feel that that's another good thing to have in there.
[52:44.580 --> 52:46.180]  And it's not just for fungus gnats.
[52:46.180 --> 52:52.340]  It's for all the stuff that's, you know, larvae size or eggs and all that stuff.
[52:52.340 --> 52:56.980]  So I do buy nematodes and I've had really good luck.
[52:56.980 --> 53:02.660]  But I also I think it's also about clean practices and taking those extra precautions
[53:02.660 --> 53:04.980]  because those are where you get the hitchhikers.
[53:04.980 --> 53:08.820]  And that's probably what happens if you're wearing the same shoes that you wear outside.
[53:09.380 --> 53:10.340]  All these little things.
[53:10.340 --> 53:15.220]  I mean, it doesn't it only takes, you know, just like a couple.
[53:15.220 --> 53:20.020]  But I think that UV is a big, big part is a big part of what we're missing growing indoors.
[53:22.100 --> 53:25.620]  When I get home in the hallway, I have a little decontamination station.
[53:25.860 --> 53:32.100]  That way my garden doesn't get anything to work and work doesn't get anything to my garden.
[53:32.100 --> 53:36.260]  There's nothing in between and, you know, there's nothing to worry about at either place.
[53:36.260 --> 53:42.260]  But I want to make sure I keep it that way by just like you said, you strip down, make sure
[53:42.260 --> 53:47.860]  you get cleaned up and make sure there's no because you can't see everything and, you know,
[53:47.860 --> 53:49.300]  everybody's soil is different.
[53:49.300 --> 53:54.500]  So it's like there's, you know, different soil life everywhere.
[53:55.700 --> 54:01.540]  Yeah, but, you know, you said that, John, in addition to the those bulbs that, you know,
[54:01.540 --> 54:09.220]  a benefit of that other than, you know, helping combat against funguses or molds or even soft
[54:09.220 --> 54:13.700]  bodied insects is that it actually really helps harden plants off like.
[54:20.250 --> 54:22.490]  Yes, they were hardening the plants.
[54:22.970 --> 54:23.470]  OK.
[54:24.650 --> 54:25.150]  Yeah.
[54:25.150 --> 54:30.810]  So that UV like the sun has a lot of that, you know, and indoors, typically you don't
[54:30.810 --> 54:37.770]  see any of that, especially in vegetative like LED lights or regular fluorescent or,
[54:38.570 --> 54:41.290]  you know, whatever else somebody is using for a veg light.
[54:41.850 --> 54:49.370]  If it doesn't have that UVA or UVB into that fluorescent bulb with it, then the plant's not
[54:49.370 --> 54:50.970]  used to that when you're putting it.
[54:51.770 --> 54:53.050]  That really helps with that.
[54:54.490 --> 54:56.250]  The healthiest plant, the good stuff.
[54:56.970 --> 54:59.290]  It's old tech, but it's tried and true.
[55:00.250 --> 55:00.570]  Right.
[55:00.570 --> 55:04.890]  You know, lighting is one of those subjects that seems like it's that dead horse that
[55:04.890 --> 55:06.570]  has been beat to death because.
[55:08.090 --> 55:12.330]  It seems like it, but no, there's still so much to learn about lighting.
[55:13.370 --> 55:17.450]  And, you know, I'm just reading more lately, too, to your point about, you know, the outdoors
[55:17.530 --> 55:22.810]  is we're always trying to out, you know, mimic the outdoor, but about different spectrums.
[55:22.810 --> 55:26.170]  You know, I was asked a question about red and blues and I'm like, well, here's why they
[55:26.170 --> 55:30.490]  thought red and blues were good, because individually they promote this, they promote that
[55:30.490 --> 55:32.250]  monochromatic light doesn't work.
[55:32.250 --> 55:36.170]  So we're seeing like that white light, but we are from LEDs.
[55:36.170 --> 55:39.450]  We're really missing that UV spectrum.
[55:39.450 --> 55:40.970]  Don't want a ton of it.
[55:40.970 --> 55:44.330]  Don't need a powerful bulb or a powerful light necessarily.
[55:44.330 --> 55:49.210]  But I do think there is some magic that I don't know how to harness or haven't found
[55:49.210 --> 55:50.730]  how to harness indoors yet.
[55:51.850 --> 55:55.370]  So hopefully we'll see more R&D dollars going to that.
[55:55.370 --> 56:01.290]  And that is why, you know, I'm saying it maybe seems like a dead horse because we just keep
[56:01.290 --> 56:06.890]  learning because cannabis industry, there's now a lot of R&D dollars being spent by these
[56:06.890 --> 56:11.370]  commercial companies that had no motivation to advance the space.
[56:12.010 --> 56:12.970]  Why did they need to?
[56:13.690 --> 56:15.130]  Now everybody grows cannabis.
[56:15.130 --> 56:15.930]  So it's happening.
[56:17.850 --> 56:22.810]  And kind of, you know, on the cutting edge of things and a lot of these reports and a
[56:22.810 --> 56:29.050]  lot of these scientists, Harvard is a school that tends to do work with cannabis, not necessarily
[56:29.610 --> 56:35.770]  plant touching from what I understand, but they're able to organize different trials
[56:35.770 --> 56:36.810]  and clinics.
[56:36.810 --> 56:42.890]  And you two were actually recently at a, was it a science fair or what was it going on
[56:42.890 --> 56:43.210]  at Harvard?
[56:43.210 --> 56:44.970]  Maybe fill us in what you guys were up to.
[56:46.650 --> 56:47.450]  Go on, Shif.
[56:47.450 --> 56:48.010]  You can tell.
[56:49.610 --> 56:51.370]  I'm just in my basement.
[56:55.130 --> 57:02.090]  MCR Labs out of Massachusetts teamed up with the Cannabis Center for Excellence and hosted
[57:02.090 --> 57:07.690]  their, I believe it was their second or third annual Cannabis Science Fair at this year.
[57:07.690 --> 57:16.010]  It was Harvard University Science Center where they had a few speakers, I believe Dr.
[57:16.010 --> 57:26.570]  Stacey Gruber, who's a neuroscientist there, as well as Dr. Nick Johnson, who is a doctor.
[57:29.210 --> 57:31.210]  He was wearing some homemade tie-dye pants.
[57:31.210 --> 57:32.730]  So he, you know, he's a cool doctor.
[57:32.810 --> 57:38.090]  And he says everybody needs a hobby and he's just tie-dyeing pants.
[57:39.690 --> 57:41.210]  They're really rad.
[57:41.770 --> 57:46.810]  But yeah, there was also Dr. Miyabi Shields was there, shout out to Smoking All Day.
[57:47.530 --> 57:47.850]  Yeah.
[57:48.890 --> 57:49.610]  Smart lady.
[57:51.050 --> 57:51.370]  Yeah.
[57:51.930 --> 58:00.970]  They have the lung, they burn hemp and they have a patented lung that they catch the smoke
[58:00.970 --> 58:10.570]  from because when you're smoking, it's in your lungs is what they're extracting and
[58:10.570 --> 58:16.090]  catching and what they're finding are hundreds and hundreds of more cannabinoids in that
[58:17.450 --> 58:21.290]  than when it's on the exhale or before it goes into the inhale.
[58:22.250 --> 58:28.570]  So they collect this tar into this lung and then their extract is made from that and they
[58:29.370 --> 58:30.170]  put it into their.
[58:30.890 --> 58:32.250]  Yeah, it's amazing, actually.
[58:32.890 --> 58:37.930]  For anybody, any stoner that joked about scrape my lungs when I'm dead, dude,
[58:39.210 --> 58:40.250]  they're actually doing this.
[58:41.930 --> 58:44.010]  But it's interesting because we only test.
[58:44.010 --> 58:51.130]  It's great because we only test what goes in, you know, the bud, the cured flower.
[58:52.330 --> 58:53.690]  Or the concentrate gets tested.
[58:53.690 --> 59:00.170]  But we don't know what does that transform into and all the other synergies or agonists
[59:00.170 --> 59:05.050]  or antagonists or what are all these other complications, you know, and how it transforms,
[59:05.050 --> 59:10.090]  just like oxidation or just like, you know, transforming to see the end.
[59:10.090 --> 59:10.570]  What?
[59:10.570 --> 59:12.890]  So now it's really cool because that's what they're studying.
[59:12.890 --> 59:15.370]  Like, what is it really doing in our lungs?
[59:15.370 --> 59:16.970]  What's it doing once it's combusted?
[59:16.970 --> 59:20.810]  Nobody tested, you know, we always test it before all of that.
[59:20.810 --> 59:21.210]  Yep.
[59:21.210 --> 59:25.050]  And I'm glad that they're testing it that way, too, because, you know, again, it's what
[59:25.050 --> 59:28.650]  winds up in the blood system and breaks, you know, the blood brain barrier.
[59:28.650 --> 59:33.370]  That's important where it's connecting, you know, the CB1, CB2 receptors.
[59:33.370 --> 59:36.490]  But if you don't know what to look for, you're not going to find it.
[59:36.490 --> 59:38.730]  So it's interesting that they're studying it that way.
[59:38.730 --> 59:44.250]  But I'm also glad they're studying it from the inhalation method because a lot of tests
[59:44.250 --> 59:47.930]  don't do it that way because, again, smoking is bad.
[59:48.170 --> 59:51.530]  But they might find some good things.
[59:51.530 --> 59:56.010]  Anyways, it's the most commonly form of cannabis use or concentrate use.
[59:56.010 --> 59:56.970]  People are inhaling it.
[59:56.970 --> 59:59.450]  So I'm glad they're studying it that way.
[59:59.450 --> 01:00:04.810]  And yeah, with edibles, the chef probably knows this, but, you know, the Delta nine
[01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.250]  turns into Delta 11.
[01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:09.850]  It's something that only happens when it gets processed through your liver.
[01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:14.890]  So there probably are things and transformations that happen within the lung.
[01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.650]  That's freaking fascinating.
[01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:17.930]  Please continue on that.
[01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:26.570]  What her partner was saying is that smoking a joint is, you know, that's my favorite way
[01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:33.530]  to medicate out of, you know, bongs or bowls or I smoke rosin and dabs too.
[01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.250]  But I'll solve this.
[01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.970]  But smoking a joint is the most chemically diverse.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:44.410]  And it was pinpointing the cherry and the heat always changing throughout it.
[01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.570]  And the resin going down in the heat.
[01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.770]  So all the different reactions happening.
[01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:56.650]  And when they tested, they collected roaches and tested all these roaches.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.050]  And every time they have a booth set up, you can actually add it to their database.
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.010]  Every time they do a test, you find it.
[01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:10.970]  So, you know, when they were explaining this to me, it really started to make a little
[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.370]  bit more sense why when I'm smoking a joint.
[01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:21.850]  You get so much more of a whole plant experience and a much more whole rather than
[01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:27.210]  or ingesting an edible.
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:33.290]  But, you know, the conversion that you were talking about with the Delta 9, it's really
[01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:42.730]  interesting because depending on how people metabolize their cannabinoids, depends on
[01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.850]  how people would want to uptake their edibles.
[01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:53.210]  Some people, they can't really eat it and ingest it down to their stomach.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.170]  So they have trouble metabolizing it that way.
[01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:02.410]  So, you know, you could do more of a sublingual approach where you're eating a hard candy
[01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:08.090]  and you're uptaking it through your mouth, like under your tongue, you have all of these
[01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.530]  nerve endings and it absorbs really well through there.
[01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.450]  That's a way that people can consider medicating that way.
[01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:21.850]  Taking it down through your liver or metabolize it into your stomach really is the path.
[01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.570]  People really enjoy the nano.
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:31.850]  I'm still on the fence about science with that.
[01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:34.330]  You were talking about the blood brain barrier earlier.
[01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:40.410]  Well, that's essentially the nano is breaking the molecules down much smaller, right?
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:44.970]  Encapsulating them so they stay apart rather than come back together.
[01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:49.530]  That way they can break these barriers and travel much quicker.
[01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:58.810]  Yeah, it hits your body faster, but the delivery method for blood brain barrier medication,
[01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:01.370]  don't quote me, I'm not a doctor or anything like that.
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:02.730]  Please don't take your medication.
[01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:05.450]  Always consult your doctor.
[01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.650]  The science just isn't quite there yet for the safety.
[01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:22.970]  I am experienced with that, making drinks and simple syrups, the ultrasonicator, but
[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:26.570]  I'm not quite convinced just yet.
[01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.010]  Definitely keep researching, everyone.
[01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:34.090]  It'll take a little bit of time.
[01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:39.130]  I think it was maybe three or four years ago that we had a company out here in Washington
[01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:44.490]  on the rec market go with the nano technology and that was really their thing and they pushed
[01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:44.990]  it.
[01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:51.370]  Working at a dispensary at the time, I tried them and I've tried all the other sample
[01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:51.930]  samples.
[01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:57.610]  I'm like, okay, I think there's something to it as far as just the delivery, but my
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.050]  knowledge stopped there.
[01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.210]  My knowledge isn't even skin deep.
[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:04.410]  It's just like, yeah, okay, I think there's something to it.
[01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.450]  So it's interesting to hear more about that.
[01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:09.770]  I agree for sure.
[01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:15.130]  It's all about the minimum effective dose and deciding what works for you and starting
[01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:15.630]  small.
[01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.890]  Definitely be mindful, nobody wants to jump in.
[01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:20.090]  Everybody's different.
[01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.370]  Everybody's body is different.
[01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:25.450]  So that's why it's so hard when you try and give someone advice, it's like, well, no,
[01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:28.090]  you kind of have to, you know, you have to be careful.
[01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:33.930]  You kind of have to do this approach of like just doing a little at a time and, you know,
[01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:39.050]  like, oh, try a half a gummy bear and then do a whole one or, you know what I mean?
[01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:40.010]  Like work your way up.
[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:46.250]  But like titrating, Shep's been like, honestly, I'm really proud of him because like the last
[01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:51.450]  three competitions that he's won at, we've gotten test results, which is so valuable
[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.410]  to have that data.
[01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:58.810]  And it was just a testament that he's doing that right too and titrating all these things.
[01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:08.730]  He was on point with whatever it was, the 50 milligram, the 10 milligrams that were
[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:15.530]  the 100 milligram pack for the gummy bears at the Freedom Cup, the CBD gummy.
[01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:19.850]  And we got to see some of the other competitors and some of the bigger producers.
[01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:24.730]  And he was like, he was closest to the number being on point.
[01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:29.770]  So, you know, I'm really, I was really proud to see that.
[01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:35.770]  And I'm sure he needs to be really proud about that because that's a problem that we always
[01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:36.090]  have.
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:40.090]  People know how to titrate because it's not really what it says on the package.
[01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:40.650]  So.
[01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:41.210]  Right.
[01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:44.970]  And for, you know, everybody listening too, it's just, you know, the plus minus, it's
[01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:50.890]  if they're saying it's 50 milligrams, you're hitting that at like 49.8.
[01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:55.210]  Whereas some of these other companies might have like a plus minus or like five or 10,
[01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.330]  which is ridiculous.
[01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:00.330]  But absolutely that adds up.
[01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.650]  So some people's five or 10, that's their dose.
[01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:10.250]  Like it depends on, you know, and even, you know, just your therapeutic index, like it's,
[01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.970]  you know, what are you trying to comp, you know, like what.
[01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:18.010]  And then consistency too, because if I get one that's, you know, minus five and then
[01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:22.170]  the next one in the box is plus seven, that's going to be hard.
[01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:29.610]  So, you know, is there anything specific that you're doing or that people can like focus
[01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.570]  on to try to do to be that consistent?
[01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:37.850]  Because again, when you're using this as medicine, consistency is key.
[01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:41.050]  That's why some of this shit in the rec market is.
[01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:41.870]  Yeah.
[01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:43.210]  So I don't know.
[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.650]  Is there anything that you're trying to specifically do to be that accurate?
[01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:54.250]  My best advice that I can give people is to always make sure that you're testing your
[01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.610]  products, always make sure that you know your.
[01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:02.160]  Oh no, he froze.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.240]  Oh no, it's that's like the gold bars.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.120]  It's the worst time.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.620]  No.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:08.720]  Well, that's OK.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.760]  Well, that's OK.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.600]  Dr. Levy says he's going out to make a new pot of coffee.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.160]  Don't bail.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.360]  So, all right, go make your coffee.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.480]  Oh, we're back, chef.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:16.800]  All right.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.000]  Sorry, you paused out there.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.520]  But you were basically just, you know, make sure that you test, make sure that you test
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.020]  your stuff.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.640]  Yes, make sure that you test your product that you're working with, whatever that may
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.560]  be for your cooking oils.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.600]  And, you know, when you get your COAs, make sure that you're calculating appropriately.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.320]  And you're doing the math and you make sure that your math is on point, because if it's
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.480]  not on point, then your calculations are off.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.280]  And when we're talking about milligrams here, that's, you know, that's it's.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.760]  Yeah, it's a really fine number.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.280]  So it can make a big difference.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.000]  I'm just saying five to 10 milligrams can be someone's dose and that can really make
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.680]  or break someone's day or evening.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:09.440]  Yes, and I've erred on the plus side of that before I got my decimal point in the wrong
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:09.840]  spot.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.160]  So I was meaning to make 10 milligram cookies, but I made 100 milligram cookies.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.480]  I wasn't sad, but I figured it out before I had given them to anybody.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.840]  So that was good on me.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.040]  I was like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.920]  Yeah, decimal point, just something that simple.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.640]  But you're saying that, you know, whatever you're using, your infused product.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.320]  So you had mentioned oil.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.360]  If you're using that, have that tested, because then you truly have the number to put in the
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.400]  equation of divide about how many batches, how many cookies or whatever caramels in this
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.560]  case you're making versus that.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.680]  So that's really kind of the key is like have that tested.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.960]  And then you you're just working with real numbers after that, right?
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.990]  Right.
[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.390]  Yeah.
[01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.310]  You know, don't be afraid of the calculator.
[01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:58.910]  It can be your friend, definitely.
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:07.310]  And if you're working with flour, like it's a little bit easier than 23.5 percent, and
[01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:12.350]  it's 235 milligrams per gram of flour.
[01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:23.230]  So like that's a pretty easy way out that just make sure that you're doing your math
[01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:27.390]  off of that, because you're doing your math before you decarboxylate.
[01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:34.430]  It's going to be a little bit different than you have to multiply it by 0.887 is the rate.
[01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:37.550]  Nice.
[01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:42.590]  And this math, too, you know, it's all available online, so definitely look it up.
[01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:48.990]  But that's, you know, an easy way to remember it's, you know, 23.5, 235 milligrams in a
[01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:51.950]  gram because one gram is a thousand milligrams.
[01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.750]  So I love it's not metric system, man.
[01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.590]  It's actually numbers that you can break down.
[01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:58.590]  Metrics nothing's round.
[01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:01.710]  Long live the imperial.
[01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:04.590]  So no, that's another show.
[01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:06.510]  Oh, shoot.
[01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:08.110]  I got my yardstick over there.
[01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:18.310]  What was that, Jeff?
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:24.470]  You're saying I've seen some people get confused where they'll get a gram syringe.
[01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:32.550]  I'll see some people get confused where they'll have a gram syringe of like RSO.
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:36.150]  But that's a gram.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.870]  Yeah, a gram is a thousand milligrams by weight.
[01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:46.070]  But your potency, for instance, of that RSO isn't going to be a thousand milligrams.
[01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:48.950]  It's like a full spectrum product.
[01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:51.030]  So there's other constituents there, too.
[01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:56.310]  Flavonoids, flaxseeds, lipids, all that other good stuff in there.
[01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:59.510]  So it's going to be more along the lines of like 60 or 70 percent.
[01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:06.870]  You have to make sure that those you're, you know what you're doing with your math.
[01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:09.030]  So like you said, it's all available online.
[01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.750]  Especially with the RSO.
[01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:17.430]  Just make sure that you're mindful of not putting, or vice versa, you know, because
[01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.710]  that's a huge difference.
[01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:23.270]  Yeah, with RSO, you definitely want to get the math right.
[01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:28.150]  And I guess that leads to, you know, like the next question, something that I'm just
[01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:31.110]  pondering myself, because it's a question I get a lot.
[01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:35.190]  It's a question I'm sure everybody in this space gets a lot.
[01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:39.430]  And none of us are doctors, and I don't expect any of us to have an answer.
[01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.590]  It's just all kind of opinion or thoughts.
[01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:45.430]  But, you know, I get asked a lot of time, what's the best strain for pain?
[01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:47.270]  You know, what can I take for pain?
[01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:49.030]  And granted, there's different kinds of pain.
[01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:52.310]  There's muscle pain, there's joint pain, there's nerve pain.
[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:58.470]  So just pain in itself isn't a true, like, you can't answer it because there's different
[01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:59.030]  routes.
[01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:03.830]  But the point that I'm trying to get to is somebody brought up the other day with me,
[01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:06.150]  is they're like, you know, edibles.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:10.070]  So, you know, there's different ways of consuming it.
[01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:12.950]  And, you know, when somebody says, well, you know, what's the right culture for it?
[01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:16.630]  You know, when somebody says, well, you know, what's the right cultivar for pain for me?
[01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:20.710]  I usually start thinking about, well, you really want to look at terpenes.
[01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:23.190]  But what do you think?
[01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:28.630]  As far as, you know, when you hear that question, be like, well, you should really try edibles.
[01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:29.910]  Like, I don't know.
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.110]  Does that make sense to you guys?
[01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.870]  Because it kind of made sense.
[01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:34.630]  And I'm still kicking that around in my head.
[01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:41.430]  I'm like, well, yeah, I guess if somebody's going to ask me for flour, for pain, edibles
[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.550]  seem to kind of be more of a full body thing for me.
[01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:47.510]  I don't know if that's your experience or people you've talked to.
[01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:49.350]  But what do you think of that question?
[01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.910]  It's a long one.
[01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.030]  I don't know.
[01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.670]  I'll go with you.
[01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:54.170]  I think.
[01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.510]  Oh, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.390]  Oh, I was gonna say go for it, John.
[01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.950]  Go ahead, John.
[01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:03.990]  I was gonna say, I think that, what was the question again?
[01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:11.110]  No, it's when somebody says, you know, recommend me a good cultivar for pain.
[01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:15.190]  Should I just automatically be like, well, instead of smoking that flour, if you really
[01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:19.190]  have, you know, like that deep pain, edibles might be actually better for you.
[01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:21.270]  Is it a wild thought?
[01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:23.510]  I mean, I don't think it's a wild thought.
[01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:27.590]  I think that you should medicate in more than just one way if you're trying to treat something,
[01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:36.150]  because like, certainly people that have really bad pain or, you know, you know, might want
[01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:37.190]  to medicate many ways.
[01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:40.550]  They might want something with that quick onset because they need that relief right
[01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:41.050]  away.
[01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:51.190]  So I think it's good to medicate in, I mean, and they've also like the suppositories, like
[01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:53.270]  for people with cancer is a really big thing.
[01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.630]  Like, it depends on where you want that medicine to be as well.
[01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:03.430]  So there's many benefits for, you know, I guess that are topical or whatever you're
[01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:09.830]  trying to, you know, but the pain, I think really boils down to more THC.
[01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:11.430]  Everybody's like, oh, is that CBD?
[01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:12.390]  Is this CBD cream?
[01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.670]  And it's great.
[01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:14.470]  That's the modulator.
[01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.830]  That's the tonifier.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:19.990]  But if it doesn't have the full entourage of all the other things, and I really think
[01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:25.190]  it's the THC that is the one that's the most, that's analgesic, that's not not susceptible,
[01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.350]  that's anti-inflammatory.
[01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:34.070]  And what causes pain, swelling, inflammation, you know, and if you can shut it down on the
[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:42.150]  receptor level, like it stops it on the anti-narcisseptic level or, you know, or it, or it, or it just,
[01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:46.070]  you know, so it, THC works in different ways on pain.
[01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:52.870]  So I think the, you want something that's going to have a very high THC content, but
[01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:59.110]  that being said, have another seven or eight phyto cannabinoids along with it that accompany
[01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.510]  it, that give it that synergy, give it that entourage.
[01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:05.830]  Because nobody wants just this THC.
[01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.310]  That's what, like, when I look at lab reports sometimes that are published at the MCR labs,
[01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:12.390]  we see three or four cannabinoids.
[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.470]  That to me is not full medicine.
[01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:18.630]  Yeah, it's going to get you high, but it's not the well-rounded full effect that you're
[01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:19.590]  looking for.
[01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.870]  And it might be unpleasant.
[01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:26.470]  And then your therapeutic index is probably something that you can easily, if you're doing
[01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:31.670]  a dab of it, just be like, now you're uncomfortable and your anxiety is increased and all the
[01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.910]  opposite of the things that you were trying to medicate.
[01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:39.110]  You, you know, because you didn't titrate your own dose correctly, but it's related
[01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:43.590]  to more of the entourage of all the other constituents that are missing.
[01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:47.110]  If it's too, it needs to be balanced.
[01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:51.590]  And I really feel that the best medicine for me is these strains that have eight or nine,
[01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:57.510]  because we really can't just even, we're just starting to learn about all the different
[01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:01.990]  interactions, you know, reverse agonist, agonist, antagonist.
[01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:05.350]  Yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:07.910]  And you guys had mentioned Dr. Mayabe Shields earlier.
[01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:14.870]  I was lucky enough to kind of do the producing for a show that she and another lady were
[01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:20.950]  doing talking about the effects of CBG on the CB1 receptor.
[01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:27.670]  And it was interesting to me because one of the things that they found was the more CBG,
[01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:32.230]  the less the THC took up on the CB1 receptor.
[01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:40.390]  And I had just gotten a cartridge that was like CBG specific, or it had it in there along
[01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:44.550]  with the C- because I get cartridges for a one-to-one.
[01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:47.830]  That's how I get my CBD intake in a high enough dosage.
[01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.630]  But this one had CBG.
[01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:52.550]  I was like, well, shoot, I'll try that too.
[01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:57.670]  And then of course, the next day I see it and it's like, well, it's gonna lessen the effect.
[01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:01.750]  And I don't know if it was placebo, but I went back to the just THC, CBD.
[01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.950]  The first time, I don't mean to, I want to let the chef talk, but I just want to say
[01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:15.350]  as a segue, we met Miabi Shields the first time at the Boxborough Lifestyles event with the
[01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:17.270]  whalers were there to play and it was a great event.
[01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:22.710]  But I was just able like, hey, she was talking to one of the performers,
[01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:25.030]  Baba Israel, you know who you are?
[01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:28.950]  They're doing like a cannabis vaudeville that they talk about Dennis Perrone and
[01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:32.550]  their music is all about teaching and yeah, follow him, dude.
[01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:37.990]  But I was just laying buds on them and saying, hell, I didn't recognize you in your civilian
[01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:42.310]  clothes because he was all dressed up for this event.
[01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.790]  And he was happened to be talking to Miabi.
[01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.870]  And I was like, oh, and I was like, here, here.
[01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.550]  And he's like, that bud you gave me earlier.
[01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:50.150]  He's like, oh, well, I have to give you more.
[01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:52.470]  And then she was like, oh, I'm Miabi Shields.
[01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:53.910]  Like, oh my God.
[01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:56.310]  And then I had just been on your show not too long ago.
[01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:59.270]  I was like, oh, you know, Kiss Organics and Chad Westport.
[01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.830]  She's like, oh, I just did a thing with Chad Westport.
[01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:07.510]  So the first time we ever met her, your name came up and it was just because I was doing
[01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:08.070]  what I do.
[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:11.030]  I was giving out buds like, you know.
[01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:16.470]  Again, you guys are fun people to hang out with.
[01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:23.750]  But yeah, Chef, we were talking too about different medicinal effects and stuff with
[01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.590]  the flower or with the edibles.
[01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:26.090]  For pain.
[01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:27.270]  Yeah, for pain.
[01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.830]  Have you had enough?
[01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:31.430]  I don't know.
[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.390]  Is that something that you've talked to people about or people have come back and talked
[01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:36.550]  to you and been like, dude, this one really hits me there.
[01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:39.190]  You know, my left earlobe pain is gone forever.
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:40.410]  I don't know.
[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:46.950]  Yeah, I wish it were that easy as all of us.
[01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:50.550]  But I deal with chronic pain myself.
[01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:58.230]  As I'm working on my feet for 20 years as a chef, I had a couple of longboarding accidents
[01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:59.510]  when my son was young.
[01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:06.150]  So I medicate always to get through my day, like function wise.
[01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:07.590]  So I'm always smoking.
[01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:15.430]  I save edibles for at night where I typically, if I don't medicate with edibles, have trouble
[01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:20.230]  sleeping with the full body relaxation that you said and kind of letting my mind actually
[01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:21.030]  get to sleep.
[01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:28.070]  I had a couple of head injuries as a young guy too that I deal with pain and tension
[01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:29.750]  from that.
[01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:30.950]  So, yeah.
[01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:38.070]  So for the strains, I can't name one particularly.
[01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:46.310]  Heavier, heavier indica leading strains like OGs and chems.
[01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.350]  The sour.
[01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.510]  The sour headbands.
[01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:59.110]  Those have typically really, really been like narcotic highs, Afghans, lights.
[01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:08.710]  Those have really kind of been heavier, kind of take out the nerves and pain that way.
[01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:11.350]  I'm always trying to relieve pressure.
[01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:18.310]  So that's something you know, I end up being able to sleep
[01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:20.070]  all the way through the night.
[01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:29.830]  And I hear from people who are like, how can I get into medicating without really getting
[01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:30.390]  fucked up?
[01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:40.790]  Well, try low dose edibles when you don't expect to be doing anything.
[01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:45.590]  Like don't try to plan like you're going to go out and do something.
[01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:49.270]  You're kind of at home and kind of like try to see how you feel.
[01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:54.710]  But yeah, the nighttime stuff is the best because I'm in it.
[01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:57.130]  Yeah.
[01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.850]  Yeah.
[01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.950]  And that's it.
[01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:05.510]  You know, I like that answer because that's typically where I do go for some of the, you
[01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:13.510]  know, I do say, you know, and, you know, indica and sativa, we use those as classifying words
[01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:16.950]  for descriptions and as far as effects go.
[01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:20.710]  So yeah, I do typically say something that's more indica effects.
[01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.550]  We tend to see more narcotic type highs there.
[01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:27.590]  And I typically kind of tie that in with myrcene.
[01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.750]  You know, that's usually my answer is it's like, look for strains that are, you know,
[01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:32.870]  dominant in myrcene.
[01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.590]  And there are other things.
[01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:40.070]  And, you know, we all agree everybody's bodies are different, but that's great that you've
[01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:46.950]  been able to kind of dial it in as far as, you know, the titration, the amount and the
[01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:53.670]  delivery method and when that delivery method is appropriate, because that's another important
[01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:54.550]  picture to this.
[01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:59.190]  You know, just like John was saying, says, you know, multiple approaches might be best
[01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:01.990]  because, yeah, smoking, it's that immediate thing.
[01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:05.510]  And that's usually what I need is that immediate onset.
[01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:10.950]  I don't have time for the edibles and I like edibles, but I also enjoy smoking.
[01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:13.510]  So I usually just opt for that.
[01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:21.430]  And yeah, if I do need something extra at night, it is it's that before bed edible.
[01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:27.190]  It's like you're I'm almost trying to be asleep before it kicks in, but it allows me to be
[01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:28.950]  asleep for the rest of the night.
[01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:33.750]  So it's not not like you're sitting back and just, you know, watching.
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:34.310]  You're mixing.
[01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:39.750]  Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:41.430]  Now, I opt for smoking.
[01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:48.070]  I was going to say maybe if you if you take too much, then and you're not you're unsettled,
[01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:50.950]  then maybe that's when you do some CBD to kind of.
[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:53.750]  To level it out, you know what I mean?
[01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:57.590]  But everybody has their own therapeutic index, so that's another thing.
[01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.630]  Titration is individual to the individual.
[01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.470]  Yeah, my buddy needs five milligrams.
[01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:05.750]  I need at least 50.
[01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:12.630]  And we both smoke the same amount together like, you know, we could go back and forth
[01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:13.270]  all day on that.
[01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:16.070]  But when it comes to edibles, it's a different thing.
[01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:18.870]  What's alluded to with the metabolism?
[01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:19.190]  Really?
[01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:20.070]  We're all different.
[01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:24.470]  Yeah, I edibles 10 within 10 minutes.
[01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:29.830]  I'm already on it, you know, which is just a metabolism thing.
[01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:34.630]  But then, yeah, there are other people that two hours later, they're still waiting.
[01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:36.870]  I feel bad for those people, but it's true.
[01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:45.030]  So, chef, I got a question about your edibles or maybe some of the sources.
[01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:53.030]  When you go into like the rec store is typically mixed as far as like the source material.
[01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:55.910]  Do you combine the source material?
[01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:57.350]  Like, are you using leaves?
[01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:03.110]  Are you kind of trying to get like just resin heads and then work with that?
[01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:07.670]  What do you kind of do as far as how do you get your material?
[01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:08.950]  And do you keep it?
[01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:14.070]  This is Indica specific or this is a sativa specific caramel.
[01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:16.390]  Does it make a difference?
[01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:23.350]  So, in my experience, it doesn't really.
[01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:26.310]  You're not going to get the benefits.
[01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:30.710]  And I've talked with a couple of scientists about this.
[01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:36.230]  Somebody I used to work with who was a biologist for many years.
[01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:39.670]  And he did extraction work for quite some time.
[01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:47.030]  And the studying that he did and that I did to fund myself was that you're not going to get
[01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:51.270]  the Indica or the effects.
[01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:53.590]  And there are some stuff out in the market there.
[01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:55.750]  I haven't really been able to tell the difference.
[01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:57.430]  Somebody has.
[01:24:57.430 --> 01:25:00.630]  I'd like to have them about that at another time.
[01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:10.710]  But I do individual mixed batches of oils for certain stuff that I'm doing.
[01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:18.630]  But for, excuse me, most of everything that I'm doing, I do mixed batches of anywhere
[01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:20.230]  from five to 10 strains.
[01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:28.150]  It's like a whole mix to get a full spectrum on.
[01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:30.150]  So, I try to get the test results.
[01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:34.870]  Hopefully, get as wide of a spread of cannabinoids that I can get back.
[01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:41.750]  Now, another thing too that's important along with cannabinoids, something that I look for
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.270]  in flour, how does it relate to maybe edibles?
[01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:47.670]  And the question here, shout out to Eagle Gardens.
[01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.070]  I was flashing the sticker up here.
[01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:50.950]  Yeah, yeah, caca.
[01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:56.710]  But the question he had here is, are they the same terpene effects?
[01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:02.710]  Well, are the effects of terpenes the same as if I smoked it versus I use that flour
[01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:06.630]  in a caramel and then had the reaction there?
[01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:09.190]  Do terpenes translate into the edibles?
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:21.740]  I've experimented with adding specific terpenes to different edibles as well as trying to
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:35.420]  use strain specific oils that have specific terpene profiles to see if I could notice
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.300]  differences.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:48.460]  And I really can't tell other than the physical effects being slightly different rather than
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:53.660]  like a head high being any different, if that makes sense.
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.140]  No, it absolutely does.
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:01.580]  And I didn't really even think about it until putting his comment and your comment together.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:08.540]  So much of the market is isolates and there's an entire industry just dedicated to terpenes.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:11.580]  I mean, Dr. Ethan Russo drew terpenes, that's his jam.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.980]  It's about recombining it.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:20.220]  So even if it didn't necessarily come from the flour or if through like decarbonation,
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.020]  decarbonation, decarbonation process.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:25.740]  Sorry, I leave you.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.780]  I always just do that.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:33.340]  But even through like the decarbonation process, you might lose some of these, but just because
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:38.220]  you lose them from the plant material itself doesn't mean they can't be brought back in.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:45.260]  So you could have like a limonene dominant caramel versus like maybe a myrcene heavy
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.060]  caramel.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:51.420]  But did we lose them or did they just transform or transfer into some other compound or some
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:55.660]  other ester, thiol or aldehyde?
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.140]  Right, right.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.100]  No, it's...
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:04.060]  Because those are, that's another part of the, those other parts of things that we equate
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.060]  to terpenes, but they're not terpenes either.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:07.260]  Sorry, chef.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:09.680]  No.
[01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:15.110]  So what were you saying there, chef?
[01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:23.670]  I was saying that in some of the extraction processes, depending on what you're doing,
[01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:30.710]  like you were saying with decarboxylation, a lot of, some of the monoterpenes are lost
[01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:33.990]  and you're left with a lot of the sesquiterpenoids.
[01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:35.510]  Okay.
[01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:42.870]  But also you do retain some of them in the concentrate, just not at the same proportions
[01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:45.430]  that are found in these types of results that are shown.
[01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:52.310]  Right, because a lot of these terpenes, they have, you know, they're found all over in
[01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.630]  nature.
[01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:57.910]  We were talking about citrus peels earlier and limonene, but they have a classification,
[01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:01.750]  it's called grass, generally recognized as safe.
[01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:07.030]  So they, they're in your shampoos, they're in, you know, your food products.
[01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:12.870]  So these terpenes do make it into a lot of consumer consumables even.
[01:29:14.230 --> 01:29:16.790]  So yeah, limonene is the most dominant of all.
[01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:21.350]  It's in all of our cleaning products because we equate it to freshness and limonene.
[01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:26.550]  You can buy straight delimonene.
[01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.930]  Yep.
[01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:32.230]  And some of it's toxic.
[01:29:32.230 --> 01:29:34.150]  You definitely wouldn't want to take a shot of it.
[01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:39.030]  And I haven't done it myself, but you know, I have heard from people who are, you know,
[01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:45.430]  they've got their bowl or whatever, then they'll do a drop or two of limonene or any other
[01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:46.550]  terpene that you can buy.
[01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:48.150]  Because again, you can get them isolated.
[01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:51.350]  And they're like, yeah, dude, it steers.
[01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:56.470]  That's where the entourage effect conversation comes in and bring that back full circle to
[01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:57.670]  Dr. Ethan Russo.
[01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:01.350]  But yeah, they're like, man, it kind of steered my high.
[01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:06.470]  So it'd be interesting again, to see if you could translate that in the kitchen.
[01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:13.110]  As long as we're not putting in a portion of a fraction of terpenes, that's way more
[01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:14.230]  than we should be inhaling.
[01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:17.910]  Because, I mean, we want to do good for our lungs.
[01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:22.230]  We don't want it to be like certain things will actually irritate our lungs at different
[01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:22.470]  things.
[01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:27.590]  And that's why some of these pens I don't really like because it's like, this is too
[01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.990]  fruity.
[01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:32.870]  This is too, you know, everybody's about the flavor, but we really don't know what those
[01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:38.550]  do to our lungs at high proportions than aren't normally there, you know, levels that are
[01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:39.430]  supernatural.
[01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:44.150]  Like, I mean, inflated so much when we don't really have any data to show what that does
[01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:45.590]  to us in the long term.
[01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:50.950]  And you talked, you mentioned bioaccumulation earlier, just from things in our soil that
[01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:52.310]  our plants accumulate.
[01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:55.030]  Heavy metals is one of those, you know, kelp.
[01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:57.350]  Kelp is something that we all use in the garden.
[01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:04.950]  But there's really only one or two companies that will pass heavy metal testing over time.
[01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:09.590]  So that's the, that was kind of a shift away from the food talk.
[01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:13.430]  Didn't mean to do that, but it all relates.
[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:19.350]  The biology can remediate that and the fungi, we know we can lock out or stop some of these,
[01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:23.350]  you know, some of this uptake with locking it out through biology.
[01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:26.550]  So sorry if I went off on another spin.
[01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.230]  No, it's all good.
[01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.670]  Where do I go?
[01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:33.670]  Do we keep talking food or we go back to soil?
[01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:34.470]  I don't know.
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.830]  Please talk to the chef because he, I was really so happy to have and blessed for you
[01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:42.150]  to entertain having us on.
[01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:45.270]  And it was really, I just wanted you to be his first interview.
[01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:47.910]  Oh man, again, yeah.
[01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:49.270]  Thanks for making the time, dude.
[01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:50.070]  This is awesome.
[01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.910]  This is stoked.
[01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:58.230]  I guess, I guess let's, let's give probably just the most basic question.
[01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:00.390]  Decarboxylating.
[01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:08.790]  See, I said at that time, decarbing for, for anybody at home, like who hasn't done this,
[01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:11.350]  what maybe is the right temperature?
[01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:15.190]  Because that's something that's always debated, usually in the same ballpark, but maybe what
[01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:16.630]  temperature you do it.
[01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:21.510]  And then also too, cause I've seen this people will, you know, they use something that's
[01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:25.990]  smaller and they stack it higher versus like a cookie sheet where it's laid out.
[01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:29.990]  Like, is there a preferred way to decarb your stuff?
[01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:33.030]  Sure.
[01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:39.990]  So with decarb, it's all about time and temperature as any other process that we're doing with
[01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:41.270]  cooking or science, right?
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:46.390]  So it could be less or more depending on time and temperature.
[01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:50.390]  But I like to do low.
[01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:54.230]  So I, a lot of people will do 240.
[01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.110]  I try to go closer to 200.
[01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:02.150]  You can go 210, 220, go 190.
[01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:10.550]  And depending on which one of these temperatures pick, your time is going to increase or decrease.
[01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:11.750]  That makes sense.
[01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:15.510]  So if you're going lower, you're going to decarb longer.
[01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:19.110]  If you're going higher, you're going to decarb for less time.
[01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:26.790]  So if you're going for like 240 degrees in your oven, let's say on a cookie sheet spread
[01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:31.670]  out, that way there's the most amount of surface area available for the heat.
[01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:37.910]  That's going to be a lower time, probably around an hour to probably an hour and 20
[01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:38.410]  minutes.
[01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:43.510]  Where closer to the 200 range, you can go closer to two hours.
[01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:49.830]  And then lower than 200, you can go closer to three hours.
[01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:56.630]  Some people will say that they swear by going eight hours or longer.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:00.390]  But at that point, that's a little much.
[01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:07.510]  And after like, I think 300 degrees or a little more, depending on different cannabinoids,
[01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:11.990]  a boiling point that they'll start to lose some of your compounds.
[01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:22.070]  So the quicker you can process in a low and safe zone to where you're not losing any of
[01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:27.190]  your precious cannabinoids that work so hard to grow.
[01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:32.470]  Yeah, one hour to two hour range is probably your sweet spot.
[01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:37.430]  And with those times, temperatures.
[01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.930]  Okay.
[01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:41.110]  Now, thank you for explaining that.
[01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:48.630]  Now, if somebody's like, well, I just, you know, make my butter and then when it's in
[01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:52.390]  the brownies, it will decarb at that point.
[01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:59.510]  Is it important to have it decarb before you actually put it into the product that you're
[01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:00.070]  baking?
[01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:03.990]  Well, would the reaction be the same inside of a doughy form?
[01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.550]  I don't know.
[01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:12.490]  Well, the brownies are only going to cook for 45 minutes, I think.
[01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:14.110]  Okay.
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:16.090]  Good answer.
[01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:17.370]  Good answer.
[01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:17.870]  But.
[01:35:19.530 --> 01:35:21.050]  Good answer.
[01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:23.770]  It's again, these things that I don't think about because I don't cook.
[01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.930]  I'm just like, well, I've just always decarbed it.
[01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:26.970]  So there's that.
[01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:31.210]  But then I get questions and I'm like, I could see why somebody would ask that.
[01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:34.410]  So I always try to get those out to the right people.
[01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:39.690]  No, that's a great question because using butter, like I haven't used butter
[01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:44.970]  unless I'm making like savory dishes, actually.
[01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:49.930]  I'll use oils for baking and stuff like that.
[01:35:49.930 --> 01:35:54.650]  But for butters, I used to use like a crock pot.
[01:35:54.650 --> 01:36:01.450]  So I would fill the crock pot with butter and my material and I would do it low and
[01:36:01.450 --> 01:36:02.410]  slow that way.
[01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:04.970]  And I would do it low and slow that way.
[01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:08.570]  So like.
[01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:12.170]  Oh, I lost what your question was.
[01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:12.670]  Sorry.
[01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:15.450]  No, that's fine.
[01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:20.890]  It's just basically if somebody's like, well, dude, I'm just going to skip decarbing because
[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:24.970]  the brownies cook at 425 degrees.
[01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:29.690]  And you mentioned that duration isn't really long enough, but there was something else
[01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:30.410]  you had to that.
[01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:36.730]  It's also going to be decarbing like in that crock pot process while you're making your
[01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:37.450]  butter too.
[01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:42.970]  So the combination of both of those together is that length of time there too.
[01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.590]  OK.
[01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:47.290]  And he says, and I had.
[01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:54.090]  We mentioned your earlier cheddar, Bob.
[01:36:54.170 --> 01:37:00.970]  We said, damn, these guys must be good because he typed something up on my IG about how cool
[01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:01.610]  these guys were.
[01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:04.970]  And here he is in chat saying, John and Alex, two very cool guys.
[01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:09.690]  You must have impressed Cheddar Bob with some pretty nice smoke and conversation.
[01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:12.970]  I wish I hung out with them more like we I didn't.
[01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:18.010]  Well, it was like that was the seed trading date, like the last day of the conference.
[01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:19.050]  Sorry, the region.
[01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:21.450]  We ran into him right as we got out of the car for that day.
[01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:22.410]  We met him in the morning.
[01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.450]  And I think Alex got to hang out with him a little bit more.
[01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:29.290]  But like, yeah, man, we'll have to hang out more definitely.
[01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:32.650]  We hope you have the cherry pie that he grew.
[01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:37.130]  Yes, that's without fucking excuse my language.
[01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:40.730]  That was a big part of the FCP.
[01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:42.890]  Yeah, shout out to Tony.
[01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:47.850]  Yeah, but I think all growing was Bruce Banner.
[01:37:48.970 --> 01:37:49.470]  OK.
[01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:51.230]  Yeah, that was.
[01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:53.790]  Yeah, he goes that one out.
[01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:57.070]  And here's another question.
[01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:59.790]  This is actually a really good one.
[01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:00.990]  You're frozen, chef.
[01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:02.670]  So I'm not sure if you can hear us.
[01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:06.430]  But I was going to get around to this.
[01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:07.150]  OK, cool.
[01:38:07.150 --> 01:38:08.350]  I was going to get around to this.
[01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:11.390]  And Frank, Frank and beans, he agrees with says, good question.
[01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:14.910]  You know, I've always wondered if a vacuum chamber could preserve the turps.
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:19.230]  But the question or my question was, OK, so we were talking about
[01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:25.150]  temperatures and you're mentioning a longer duration, a couple hours at least.
[01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:28.510]  Decarbing in the oven can smell.
[01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:31.630]  My question was, is there any way to contain that smell?
[01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:37.310]  Then Eagle steps up turkey bag in the oven is a turkey bag, something that may keep the smell
[01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:41.630]  from permeating the place because decarbing is a smelly process.
[01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.390]  It's hard to be discreet.
[01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:49.630]  And turpines are very sneaky and they can sneak out of any little crack and crevice.
[01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:52.510]  So that's a tough one right there for sure.
[01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:54.510]  In regards to one.
[01:38:56.510 --> 01:39:00.830]  I like I like some bacon first and then do your decarbing.
[01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:01.310]  Yes.
[01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.870]  Yes.
[01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:02.830]  All right.
[01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:03.470]  Old school.
[01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:05.790]  Yes, I have.
[01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:08.270]  I have done the bacon trick.
[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:10.670]  My parents were coming over like cooking bacon.
[01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.870]  Oh, it smells like bacon.
[01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:14.030]  Yeah, maybe it's a nice breakfast.
[01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:16.030]  I knew you were sorry to cut you off, chef.
[01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:20.830]  But yes, so the turkey is tricky, but to the oven bag.
[01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:24.430]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:31.290]  So what what I what I was thinking with the turpines and the
[01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:37.930]  off gassing there is like, you know, when like the jar tech process for making like a rosin jam,
[01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:44.410]  it's like you have your rosin in the jar and you have the jar lid screwed, from my understanding.
[01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:47.450]  I haven't quite gotten that far with the tech myself yet.
[01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:55.370]  But you're warming this jar of cannabis oil rosin up to have this transformative process
[01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:57.130]  to change the texture of the rosin.
[01:39:57.130 --> 01:40:03.770]  Well, the science in my understanding is that the turpines are very volatile.
[01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:08.410]  The turpines are very volatile and all of these temperature ranges.
[01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:15.450]  There's this galaxy of gases and exchanges happening in that jar to where they're trying
[01:40:15.450 --> 01:40:19.050]  to leave and they can't because the lid is on and there's this vacuum chamber effect.
[01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:25.450]  So like you can save some that way, right?
[01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:31.290]  But at some point, I think during the cooking process, you're going to lose them.
[01:40:31.690 --> 01:40:39.210]  But I think that with that question on the table, that there's still more research to be done.
[01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:44.410]  And there's probably a way for us to figure that out so we can save all of our precious
[01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:45.450]  compounds, right?
[01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:47.850]  That's what the community is for.
[01:40:48.730 --> 01:40:52.330]  Yeah, that's why we're on this mission with these scientists that were out here.
[01:40:54.010 --> 01:41:00.330]  One of the experiments that we really found was the most interesting was Scott from MCI
[01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:01.930]  Scott from MCI Labs.
[01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.650]  He's the chief scientific officer.
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:06.570]  John, I think you remember this experiment.
[01:41:07.210 --> 01:41:14.090]  They showed seven or eight different strains that were grown inside and then under the
[01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.410]  sun.
[01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:22.410]  And what the experiment was showing was that the secondary plant metabolites and cannabinoid
[01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:29.850]  expression was greater on the sun grown on all across the board, grown in the same conditions
[01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.050]  other than indoor and outdoor.
[01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:38.970]  And that's really tried and true testament to part of my mission to the medicine there
[01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:46.330]  is the sun grown aspect of creating the most whole expression and profile that this plant
[01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:49.210]  can give us because you can't replicate it.
[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:54.570]  But what we're doing inside with the mixed media lighting is we're trying to do our due
[01:41:54.570 --> 01:42:00.810]  diligence with the biomimicry, with the soil, with the different light sources and the UV
[01:42:00.810 --> 01:42:06.650]  and trying to give the plant everything it needs, just like it would get in nature inside,
[01:42:06.650 --> 01:42:08.890]  just like outside to make this medicine.
[01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:14.970]  It'll be interesting if it comes down to it, because, again, like my background is audio
[01:42:14.970 --> 01:42:15.610]  engineering.
[01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:20.890]  I can tell the difference between vinyl and an MP3 file like.
[01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:22.810]  98% of the people can't.
[01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:24.010]  I totally can.
[01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:27.130]  I wonder if you're going to be able to be the person to be like.
[01:42:28.410 --> 01:42:32.570]  My, you know, mix up your caramels behind your back and then pick one out and be like,
[01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:35.370]  that's the sun grown, flip it over sun grown.
[01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:38.970]  I wonder if it'll be that case.
[01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:42.970]  Yeah, or are we there yet?
[01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:49.690]  Have as is your palate that that trained yet or, you know, again,
[01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:52.730]  you know, again, not many people pick these things up, though.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.240]  So did I leave you guys there for a second?
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.920]  Yeah, we lost that we lost the beginning of your answer, but you're back.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.200]  So sorry about that.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.520]  Yeah, he flashed out there for a second.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.040]  Yeah, no worries.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.360]  Yeah, my pal, my pal is quite trained.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.080]  That's for sure.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.240]  It's tasted quite, quite the array as I'm sure everyone else's has too, but it's always
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.640]  learning and I'm always trying to experience new things and and test the limits.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:36.320]  So, you know, as as we continue with this plant, I feel like that I'm going to be pushing
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.280]  my palate's limits.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.960]  Always learning, like you said, like John.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.200]  Yeah, like John says all the time, too.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.360]  And, you know, actually, it's not just says lives, always learning.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.040]  Well, a lot of us do all these people we're bringing up.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.600]  We're still we're we're basic.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.200]  We're disciples of this plant.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.000]  This master plant is so helps us in so many ways.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.040]  And yeah, it's a it's infinite journey.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.240]  It definitely is.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:12.400]  And, you know, here's here's a question that I wouldn't even begin to to know how to answer,
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.440]  because I've just done traditional stuff when it comes to edibles.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.720]  You know, I've made my tinctures.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.600]  I make my butter.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.520]  I've made my coconut oil.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.080]  But that's through decarbed flower material that I have off of the plants.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.920]  You know, I always try to make the most of it as a medicinal person with a small home
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.240]  grow.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.760]  You try to maximize what you can.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.760]  But this question here is, you know, so decarb, which was basically what I would have versed
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:43.440]  rosin infused, which is what all the kids are doing these days.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:51.280]  But is there much of a difference in how you would use that or prepare or maybe even like
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.560]  calculate dosages when you're cooking, chef?
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.100]  So, yeah, no, that's a good question there.
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:08.220]  And definitely rosin, rosin infused edibles are a hot topic on the scene for sure.
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:11.740]  And they're definitely delicious and they definitely work for sure.
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:15.500]  But really, they're decarbing that rosin too.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:24.540]  So, yeah, you know, is that is that the way because rosin that it's stream specific.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.460]  It's a bunch of rosin.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:28.700]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:33.500]  I like sometimes your audio cuts out.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.180]  So I was like, oh, he wasn't talking.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.700]  I'm going to jump in with a question.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.980]  But you were still going.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:38.700]  I apologize.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:43.180]  It was not at all.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:52.220]  OK, but no, you said it was kind of a hot topic right now because it is powerful,
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.740]  but it does get decarbed.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.980]  And I was going to ask if it gets is it decarbed just through the process
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:05.100]  of getting it to make the rosin or where is the decarbing coming in?
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:08.060]  They're not sticking a little while in the oven, are they?
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:12.140]  Sure, sure.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:18.860]  So they are decarbing the whole jar of their cooking rosin.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:19.100]  Yes.
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:30.140]  OK, so that I asked if it's the obvious choice B rosin that they're not putting in grams
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.860]  or whatever, they'll have a large amount of that.
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:34.460]  No, he thought that.
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:41.740]  Typically, they'll use like an electric magnetic spinner, right?
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:48.220]  That way they can put it in like a flask and have it rotating with a magnetic spinner at
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:48.620]  the bottom.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:53.900]  It's going to bubble up almost over the top.
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:47:00.940]  But you can use a heat gun to extinguish those bubbles as it decarbs.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:06.860]  But then you have a decarbed full spectrum rosin product that you can.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:11.660]  If you're decarbing it, there's going to be that conversion, right?
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.900]  So if you have the test results from the rosin before.
[01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:22.590]  No, he's cutting out, but I know where he's going with this one.
[01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:26.430]  There is that conversion because you lose from.
[01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:30.670]  OK, so yeah, so if it's right, I'll let you pick it up from there.
[01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:39.470]  So if you have all of this rosin that you're going to be using for cooking, you don't really
[01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:40.670]  need to test it first.
[01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:45.150]  You need to do that and then test it after because that's when you're going to be using
[01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:45.550]  it, right?
[01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:49.150]  That makes sense?
[01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:50.910]  Yep, that makes sense.
[01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:55.150]  And I was going to say, yeah, if you did have it tested first, like if it was something
[01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:59.550]  that you did get from the dispensary and then you go to the decarb route, you have to do
[01:47:59.550 --> 01:48:05.950]  the conversion of the math because it's going to come out as a lower percentage slightly
[01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:10.030]  because it's like 0.0887 or something.
[01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:13.870]  And typically rosin is pressed.
[01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:21.630]  Typically rosin is pressed at like 160 to 200 degrees, like if you want to.
[01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:23.550]  So you're not getting much decarboxing.
[01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.590]  Yeah.
[01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.990]  In that process.
[01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:31.150]  OK, so after this process, treat it like marmalade.
[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:34.030]  Let's see.
[01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:43.310]  Is there now is there a preference or is there something like in your personal experiences
[01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:50.510]  that you have found is better for using with edibles, whether starting like a rosin or
[01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:55.310]  starting with a distillate or just starting with pure flour or RSO?
[01:48:55.310 --> 01:49:01.070]  If you put all of those individually into the same cookie, well, different cookies.
[01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:06.430]  But is there one in your experience for your body that you found that does better?
[01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:07.230]  Is there a difference?
[01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:15.950]  So chef's tip is whole plant medicine, full spectrum.
[01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:24.750]  So if I was going to choose, it would be that FICO RSO or like a flour decarbed into
[01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:29.710]  like a let's say a coconut oil.
[01:49:29.710 --> 01:49:32.030]  I would choose a coconut oil over a butter.
[01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:35.870]  And then also another chef's tip.
[01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:38.830]  This is old school from my college days.
[01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:46.190]  So if you're going to use butter, like I said, I don't really use butter too much anymore.
[01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:51.230]  But it's got like I believe it's a 75 percent butterfat content.
[01:49:52.110 --> 01:49:55.710]  The other 25 percent is milk solids and impurities.
[01:49:55.710 --> 01:50:01.230]  So like when you melt butter, you got the foamy white stuff and the frothy and then
[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:02.750]  you have your clarified butter, right?
[01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:06.750]  So that's your 75, 25 or whatever it works out to.
[01:50:07.710 --> 01:50:14.350]  European style butter is more like an 87 percent butterfat content.
[01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:19.150]  And if you want to correlate that to a coconut oil, coconut oil is more along the lines of
[01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:21.550]  the 90 percent fat.
[01:50:22.670 --> 01:50:31.470]  So like the more fat, the better, because cannabinoids are oils and fat molecules bond.
[01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.790]  Right.
[01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:36.110]  So like you're going to have a better and more efficient oil.
[01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:45.230]  So you can use like a European style butter as opposed to like traditional butter and
[01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:47.070]  the brand for that is like Plugra.
[01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:56.110]  Or like an Irish butter is more along the lines of an American butter actually.
[01:50:56.110 --> 01:51:00.430]  So like Irish butter won't have that higher butterfat content.
[01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:02.990]  But the European style butter will.
[01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:12.510]  Does it help maybe retain some of the cannabinoids if it's like a fatty food like donuts,
[01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:13.710]  like infused donuts?
[01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:20.190]  Or does it make a difference because of the input is there?
[01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:21.710]  I guess let me question.
[01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:25.070]  I'm the king of long rambling questions.
[01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:28.030]  If you haven't noticed, I'll just put it out there.
[01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:32.430]  That's my ability anyway.
[01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:34.030]  I might be wrong if I'm wrong.
[01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:37.550]  That's our style.
[01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:38.430]  There's no other way.
[01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:39.710]  That's all of our styles.
[01:51:44.670 --> 01:51:49.470]  But, you know, if I was and this is probably not even possible, but if I was trying to
[01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:57.310]  like infuse a donut and infuse a carrot, like is the infusion going to stick at equal levels
[01:51:57.310 --> 01:52:01.950]  because there's more fat in the donut than there is the carrot because it's just infused?
[01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:03.070]  Does it make a difference?
[01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:12.190]  So the donut for me sounds like a tough example because like you could have like you're cooking
[01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:16.270]  the donut, the dough might have oil in it, right?
[01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:18.750]  Or butter in it, but then you're going to fry it, right?
[01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:25.790]  So if you're going to fry this donut, is some of your cannabinoids going out of your dough
[01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:28.830]  and into this frying oil or are you baking it?
[01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:32.350]  So like these are the things that chef thinks about all these things.
[01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:34.990]  I'm a non-chef.
[01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:37.310]  So yes, I'm just like fatty food.
[01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:38.190]  I like donuts.
[01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:40.350]  But my wife always tells me those are bad.
[01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:46.270]  Well, the carrot is really the carrot.
[01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:50.110]  So like maybe you'll have a salad and you'll have an infused vinaigrette and your little
[01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:53.310]  cup will have the amount of cannabinoids in each cup or whatever.
[01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:57.390]  So then your whole salad will have that, I guess.
[01:52:57.390 --> 01:53:02.030]  But if you had a different item than the donut, that would be an easier.
[01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:07.070]  Okay, try to get technical with an expert here.
[01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:14.910]  Next entry, dude, is going to be the next winner, the Chad's apple cider donuts.
[01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:20.510]  Dude, if you could infuse the donut, whether it be the oil that it's cooking in or just
[01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:21.070]  the dough.
[01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:22.510]  I love the apple cider donuts.
[01:53:24.270 --> 01:53:25.870]  It'd probably be the icing, wouldn't it?
[01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:27.310]  Because that's like butter.
[01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.310]  Yeah, or the frosting cream filling, right?
[01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:32.510]  Oh, East Coaster's over there.
[01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:36.510]  So do you guys get down with the maple bar and bacon?
[01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:38.990]  Like is that in the East Coast yet?
[01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:41.790]  Oh, you just opened up an old one.
[01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:51.870]  So the day I met John at the Harvest Cup in 2019, I had two entries.
[01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:52.510]  2018.
[01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:53.090]  One.
[01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:55.870]  18, 19.
[01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:56.670]  One of those ones.
[01:53:58.110 --> 01:53:59.550]  One could be a filling, right?
[01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:05.230]  So I did the strawberry jalapeno marmalade that won the Harvest Cup there.
[01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:07.550]  That could be like a jelly donut filling, right?
[01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:17.630]  Well, then I also did the maple bacon bourbon onion jam.
[01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.530]  Oh!
[01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:21.870]  So that was also something.
[01:54:23.070 --> 01:54:25.070]  It's like that would be great on a burger, right?
[01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.530]  Yes.
[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:27.790]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:28.290]  So that's awesome.
[01:54:28.290 --> 01:54:35.550]  The strawberry jalapeno marmalade, I was like brushed on some barbecue ribs.
[01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.710]  Yeah.
[01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:41.150]  And glazed the strawberry jalapeno marmalade.
[01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:43.950]  And that was good just on some sourdough in the morning.
[01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:45.870]  He gave me a little jar of it.
[01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:46.830]  That was my first.
[01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:52.670]  And the picture that you smashed of John and I at the beginning with Eddie Lipp.
[01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:56.590]  Like he came up and that was what was up.
[01:54:56.590 --> 01:54:56.830]  Yeah.
[01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:57.310]  Heck yeah.
[01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:01.390]  Eddie Lipp.
[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.890]  Yeah.
[01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:03.390]  Back there.
[01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.710]  Yep.
[01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:05.710]  You got Eddie.
[01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:07.790]  He looks particularly happy there too.
[01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.910]  On the right.
[01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:11.470]  On the left, he looks pretty vagues.
[01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:14.030]  On the right, he's like, I just got high.
[01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:16.350]  I got to smoke my stuff with him.
[01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:17.950]  I definitely lit him up.
[01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:19.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:55:20.590 --> 01:55:21.950]  That's awesome.
[01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:25.390]  OG RIP, the OG Eddie Lipp.
[01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.550]  Definitely.
[01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:28.190]  That's magic.
[01:55:28.190 --> 01:55:29.550]  The biggest balls on the planet.
[01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.870]  Biggest balls on the planet.
[01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:32.370]  That's right.
[01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.590]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.590 --> 01:55:35.070]  Look at that.
[01:55:35.070 --> 01:55:35.790]  He's the man.
[01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:36.350]  Yeah.
[01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:40.990]  And everybody, we mentioned, I'll shamelessly plug my stuff here too.
[01:55:41.230 --> 01:55:48.510]  We mentioned, you know, Kiss Organics, Tad Hussey earlier.
[01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:52.350]  Me and him have been working together on a project called Dope History, which we've been
[01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:53.310]  meaning to launch.
[01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:56.670]  It's very, very, very close to launching.
[01:55:57.230 --> 01:56:01.790]  But one of the things we're doing is we're interviewing some of the people that were
[01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:05.150]  around, kind of at the foundation of it.
[01:56:05.150 --> 01:56:07.710]  And he's been on this project for a couple of years.
[01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:09.870]  We have an interview with OG Eddie Lipp.
[01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:15.870]  And I had the honor of doing the editing on that and taking hours of their conversation
[01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:18.030]  and boiling it down to about an hour.
[01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:24.430]  But yeah, when you say the biggest balls in football fields, tune into that episode, guys,
[01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:27.150]  and you'll understand that that guy did his thing.
[01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:33.390]  You told me a story about Joe Montana.
[01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:36.590]  He's the Joe Montana.
[01:56:36.670 --> 01:56:42.590]  When he was here in Boston, a lot of people kind of mistook him for Chong.
[01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:43.630]  They're like, oh, that looks like Chong.
[01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:44.130]  Yes.
[01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:45.470]  That Chong dude.
[01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:52.190]  And even Chong posted up a poster of them together, or maybe it was Soil King or someone
[01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:52.670]  posted up.
[01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:55.150]  I was like, and they do look like so similar together.
[01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:57.310]  But I was like, no, that's Eddie Lipp.
[01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.230]  You need to know who this dude is.
[01:56:59.230 --> 01:57:00.750]  We're here because of him.
[01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:05.470]  And he was a little bit dismayed at, you know, spending all that time in jail and coming
[01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:12.510]  out and seeing how, you know, but he described the story about, you know, how, you know,
[01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:16.830]  if you could go behind that wall and you could have anything you wanted, what make this day
[01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:17.390]  better?
[01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:22.190]  And he was like, being in the huddle with Joe Namath, listening to the last plays, even
[01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:23.710]  though you know your favorite team was winning.
[01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:28.750]  So he equated himself like, I'm Joe Namath here in the room, and nobody knows who I am.
[01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:35.310]  He's like, unfortunately, if you say the hamper wears no clothes, people are not going to be
[01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:38.750]  like, oh, but if you say Jack Harer, they're going to be like, oh, that's that marijuana
[01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:39.390]  strain.
[01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:45.710]  They're not even going to know him as, you know, the emperor of hemp.
[01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:51.550]  And, you know, so it was great to talk to him and see him and hang out with him and
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:56.830]  just give him the love and respect that he really, really needed to get, you know, and
[01:57:56.830 --> 01:58:00.990]  not being recognized was kind of like, it was hard for him, I'm sure.
[01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:05.550]  So God rest him and all the people he's helped and all.
[01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:07.070]  He's been a champion for this plant.
[01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.310]  So.
[01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.310]  Huge.
[01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.950]  Yeah.
[01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:10.190]  Yeah.
[01:58:10.190 --> 01:58:12.430]  So I'm so I can't wait to hear that interview.
[01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:15.710]  That yeah, I can't we can't wait to get that out there.
[01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:19.630]  You know, a little bit jealous I never got to meet the person.
[01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:25.390]  But again, sitting and editing hours of audio into down, you listen to it a lot.
[01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:27.070]  So we can't lose this culture.
[01:58:27.070 --> 01:58:28.910]  You know, that's where I'm going with that.
[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:29.390]  We can't.
[01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:30.350]  That's the point.
[01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:32.270]  Yeah, that was that was the point.
[01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:33.550]  I mean, that is.
[01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:38.590]  That's some dope history for sure.
[01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:40.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:47.390]  So you guys, you guys, you know, it sounds like you met kind of at a competition, 2018
[01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.550]  ish.
[01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:52.750]  You guys got to see, you know, any lap, you got to hold up some trophies.
[01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:56.190]  So tell me what kind of events have you been to?
[01:58:56.190 --> 01:58:59.150]  Have they been primarily over on the East Coast?
[01:58:59.150 --> 01:59:01.710]  Are there ones that you like to do every year?
[01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:07.070]  Maybe tell us tell us about some of your contest experiences.
[01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:13.230]  You could go ahead and start, John, and I'll follow up right after.
[01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:16.430]  Oh, big screen.
[01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:18.030]  Now you got it all start.
[01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:21.550]  Well, I've I've entered the Harvest Cup many times, and it's a great platform.
[01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:23.150]  There's so many great cultivators.
[01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:26.750]  It's kind of the biggest thing that we have around here.
[01:59:27.230 --> 01:59:34.110]  And but then there's all these other great ones, the Commonwealth Campout with Commonwealth
[01:59:34.110 --> 01:59:37.710]  Cup, the Croptoberfest, which is run by the same people.
[01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:40.430]  Mike, shout out to Metal Mike.
[01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:49.790]  But, you know, we I didn't really know this existed until a friend was like, you got to
[01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:50.670]  enter your stuff.
[01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:52.110]  You know, the Harvest Cup is coming up.
[01:59:52.110 --> 01:59:53.710]  I was like, I'm just this guy.
[01:59:53.710 --> 01:59:55.870]  I'm not I'm not really into that.
[01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:59.550]  And, you know, and I was like, no, your stuff is awesome.
[01:59:59.550 --> 02:00:05.630]  So I never have one at the Harvest Cup, but it all started from that and met Chef Alex
[02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:06.270]  at that time.
[02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:09.070]  And, you know, we bonded.
[02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:15.470]  But then it was like, oh, the next year I did it again and I didn't win again.
[02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:17.710]  But I was really happy to.
[02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:23.550]  Oh, so I ended up finding out that there's the squash shop for Uncle Stoner.
[02:00:24.110 --> 02:00:26.910]  Shout out to Uncle Stoner Squash Shop, USA Squash Shop.
[02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:29.390]  And they're like, oh, you should try.
[02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:30.670]  You know, and I that's what I do.
[02:00:30.670 --> 02:00:31.310]  I do rosen.
[02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:33.230]  That's my specialty, the flower rosen.
[02:00:33.230 --> 02:00:38.270]  So I was like, oh, man, I got to get I know I have this medicine that squishes awesome.
[02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:40.750]  And but everybody didn't like the fuel.
[02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.110]  Some reason they wanted the fruit.
[02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:47.310]  And I have two pinots of this 818 headband that are just really marvelous medicine.
[02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:50.270]  And but I'm more about the gas.
[02:00:51.230 --> 02:00:54.030]  So I didn't win there, but I wasn't discouraged.
[02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:56.110]  And I'm like, I'm bringing everything next time.
[02:00:56.110 --> 02:01:00.270]  I'm bringing the fruit and the gas, you know, and the fruit one.
[02:01:00.270 --> 02:01:02.110]  So it's not my favorite medicine.
[02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:03.710]  It's my second go to.
[02:01:03.710 --> 02:01:06.030]  But I like, OK, I'm on the board.
[02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:09.950]  So last year, November, second place, finally won something.
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:16.510]  I tried to harvest cups, won second place at the at the Uncle Stoner Squash Shop.
[02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:22.030]  And, you know, there's a lot of great competitors.
[02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:24.030]  Christian Monarch, I want to give him a shout out.
[02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:28.990]  You know, he came in the one that I didn't win at the first one of the Freedom Rally.
[02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:32.110]  I didn't win that, but I wasn't discouraged.
[02:01:32.110 --> 02:01:36.750]  So at the Harvest Cup, Uncle Stoner had his own squash shop within the cup.
[02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:42.830]  So I was like a competitor in the cup, but also was like there to throw down for the squash shop.
[02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:45.230]  Came in second place there.
[02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:53.150]  Then that opportunity opened up for entering the Amsterdam for Mela the Dabadoo.
[02:01:53.790 --> 02:01:56.670]  And it was just after I met Swerve.
[02:01:56.670 --> 02:01:57.470]  Shout out to Swerve.
[02:01:57.470 --> 02:02:00.270]  I've been running his gear for nine years, going on nine years now.
[02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:04.910]  Those packs I got at Oakland Harborside Health.
[02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:10.270]  And so basically I met him and he was like, oh, mix them.
[02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:11.950]  I dabbed him out with the two different pinos.
[02:02:12.190 --> 02:02:17.390]  Here's like a proud foster parent bringing the to the breeder to the father.
[02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:19.150]  And he was like, oh, mix them.
[02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:21.070]  So this opportunity came up.
[02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:21.630]  I mixed them.
[02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:25.310]  I made flower rosin and I got third place at the Dabadoo.
[02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:26.430]  And that was like November.
[02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:28.110]  That was like December or January.
[02:02:28.110 --> 02:02:32.910]  So from November, then comes.
[02:02:35.070 --> 02:02:36.430]  Was it the squash shop again?
[02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:39.230]  Or was it Commonwealth Cup on 4?
[02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:42.270]  No, 420.
[02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:45.950]  I won first in place at the squash up in New York at Dr.
[02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:47.070]  Green's in New York.
[02:02:47.070 --> 02:02:47.870]  Shout out there.
[02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:49.550]  They're killing it over there.
[02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:53.310]  I met Brett Bogue and Uncle Stoner and the Stoner crew.
[02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:56.750]  And so I came in first and second there.
[02:02:58.270 --> 02:03:02.830]  And then I came in second at the Commonwealth, third at the Commonwealth Cup,
[02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:06.110]  second to another homie, high grade herb.
[02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:09.790]  To him, he's all organic ceremonial flowers.
[02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:10.830]  He's killing it.
[02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:16.990]  So it was really, really great to see someone that I know is doing it the way I do it up
[02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:18.670]  there on the podium above me.
[02:03:18.670 --> 02:03:24.510]  And it made me feel so proud to know this is the methodology that we're embracing here.
[02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:27.230]  But then I came in.
[02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:35.230]  Then there was this Freedom Cup at the latest Freedom Rally in Boston, which is the biggest
[02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:36.190]  sit-in of all.
[02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:40.110]  And Shuf got second place with his gummy.
[02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:44.750]  I got first place for home grow and first place for sativa because they asked me, what
[02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:46.270]  do you want to enter as a home grower?
[02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:46.990]  Or do you want?
[02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:50.190]  I was like, I'm putting my best up against the best.
[02:03:50.190 --> 02:03:54.350]  And I'm putting up my second best against the home growers because I want to cover all
[02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:55.150]  my bases here.
[02:03:55.790 --> 02:04:00.190]  That gave me the wonderful opportunity to get up on stage and to talk about what we're
[02:04:00.190 --> 02:04:01.470]  talking about today.
[02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:06.030]  That our food, the way, their methodology, the way we grew our food in this country,
[02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:10.430]  and we're poisoning ourselves with what we're eating and what it's available to us, whether
[02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:15.070]  or not we can afford to eat organically, it's still pretty much poison.
[02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:18.990]  Hate to say it, but so it's kind of this awareness.
[02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:24.510]  But I was able to get up there and kind of say, this is what we need to do to get healthier,
[02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:26.830]  longer lives is embrace growing.
[02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:28.750]  And you learn about what you do for this plant.
[02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:31.310]  And a lot of people have said this, but it's true.
[02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:35.470]  Like, so I was so thankful for that.
[02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:40.110]  And then I came in second at the Commonwealth Cup.
[02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:42.990]  First place came in Chris Shamanek.
[02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.950]  He's killing it.
[02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:45.150]  Great, great grower.
[02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:47.310]  Great guy, grew good people.
[02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:53.710]  And then I had six entries at the Harvest Cup.
[02:04:53.710 --> 02:04:58.030]  And this year it was divided into different terpene categories.
[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:00.190]  There was no humulene.
[02:05:00.190 --> 02:05:01.070]  There was no humulene.
[02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:03.230]  So one whole category got dropped.
[02:05:03.230 --> 02:05:05.390]  So there's only five categories.
[02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:08.270]  I didn't play the show or win.
[02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:11.470]  Did they just toss it in the caryophyllene category?
[02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:16.270]  They're like, eh, you broke off, we'll put you back with the humulene?
[02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.990]  I'm not sure.
[02:05:18.350 --> 02:05:20.430]  But they were just like, there's no humulene entry.
[02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:22.670]  So there was only five.
[02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:25.150]  They were supposed to break it down to six major terpene.
[02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:30.670]  I mean, so anyway, did not come home with anything.
[02:05:30.670 --> 02:05:34.030]  But the chef came home with first for his CBD caramel.
[02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:35.390]  He made it CBD this time.
[02:05:36.190 --> 02:05:40.590]  And I still was able to pull off another win at the squash shop.
[02:05:41.230 --> 02:05:46.750]  First place with a cultivar I only had over the summer growing out in my tent outdoors
[02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:47.550]  under the sun.
[02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:54.590]  So it made me feel really good knowing that like that was recycled soil that I put into
[02:05:54.590 --> 02:06:01.390]  15 gallon containers that I grew in a small greenhouse outdoor under the sun in a lowly
[02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:02.030]  lit area.
[02:06:02.670 --> 02:06:08.590]  And it was chosen to be the winner, even though I still had my go to.
[02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:10.910]  I only was allowed two entries.
[02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:20.110]  I put my 818 headband, that fruit one they like, you know, and it was kind of vindicating
[02:06:20.110 --> 02:06:21.390]  to be like, you know what?
[02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:22.510]  I just won with something.
[02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:26.510]  I just grew outside in the garden that I put out there because it had thrips when it was
[02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.990]  given to me.
[02:06:30.190 --> 02:06:34.190]  So yeah, there's something to be said about the sun.
[02:06:34.190 --> 02:06:38.110]  So that being said, from November to November, nine awards.
[02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:40.110]  Very nice.
[02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:44.430]  Do you remember what some of the strains were that you won with?
[02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:47.150]  Now you had mentioned, you know, a swear kind of makes the two.
[02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:49.070]  It's my 818 headband.
[02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:54.350]  I've been entering this hollyweed because Kevin Jodery back in 2017 or 18 saying that was one
[02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:56.350]  of the strains to grow at the time.
[02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:59.070]  And it is a marvelous cultivar.
[02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:01.550]  Shout out to plant more seeds.
[02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:07.230]  Bodhi, you know, I know his seeds are grown with biointelligence.
[02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:08.590]  His seeds perform amazing.
[02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:12.990]  And I don't know, it's hard to choose which one to keep out of his packs, really.
[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:17.710]  And that's just on a small scale.
[02:07:17.710 --> 02:07:24.430]  So it's like when you know the breeders really putting in work when sometimes you want variability.
[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:26.350]  I mean, that F1 sometimes.
[02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:30.670]  But anyway, so yeah, I've entered that.
[02:07:30.670 --> 02:07:36.350]  And I was I really wanted to be able to be like this Malawi dog, Brandon Russ just won.
[02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:40.670]  Or this hot rod that I had in there from Dungeons Vault Genetics.
[02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:41.870]  Eric, shout out to him too.
[02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:43.870]  And Brandon Russ, I'm running your gear.
[02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:45.710]  I have some beautiful phenos I found.
[02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:50.430]  Yeah, man, this is that what's behind you.
[02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:55.070]  We've had a couple of people make comments like, dude, those bugs are awesome behind them.
[02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:56.590]  These are in the tent now.
[02:07:56.590 --> 02:07:57.470]  I just harvested.
[02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:03.630]  So this is the Malawi dog that actually went like purple, deep purple, like Uptown Grow
[02:08:03.630 --> 02:08:03.950]  Labs.
[02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:05.950]  When I saw him, I was like, oh, I got those packs.
[02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:06.830]  I'm going to pop.
[02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:07.790]  I got a whole nother pack.
[02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:09.630]  So I'm going to find another one too.
[02:08:09.630 --> 02:08:12.270]  But this one goes purple, beautiful Malawi dog.
[02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:15.710]  This is the one that's the chem leaner.
[02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:17.790]  I had another Malawi dog.
[02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:18.270]  It was more.
[02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:20.750]  This is double tangy banana.
[02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:21.630]  I had that in too.
[02:08:21.630 --> 02:08:24.430]  I was going to be like, dude, Crockett family, you got to represent.
[02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.270]  That thing is trimmed rather phallically.
[02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:28.110]  No, no, it's not even trimmed.
[02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:33.150]  That's all because it's been hanging upside down for three days.
[02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:38.430]  And then here's my 818 headband or Swerve's 818 headband.
[02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.750]  OK.
[02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:41.310]  They went totally purple.
[02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:42.910]  And then this is the green pheno.
[02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:43.630]  These are sisters.
[02:08:43.710 --> 02:08:49.470]  So this shows you how sisters like in this has more golf ball structure.
[02:08:49.470 --> 02:08:51.070]  This is more of a sour diesel leaner.
[02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:53.310]  This is more that SFBIBL leaner.
[02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:59.950]  Yeah, so oh, and then now I hope to be able to enter this soon.
[02:08:59.950 --> 02:09:01.390]  This is the Chile Verde.
[02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:02.830]  Shout out to Eric Minor.
[02:09:03.710 --> 02:09:04.750]  You don't know who he is.
[02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:06.350]  You look him up.
[02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.910]  That's right.
[02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:08.050]  Yeah.
[02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:12.030]  He was out in Thailand with the with Steve Reisner too.
[02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.990]  Shout out to him, bro.
[02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:14.110]  They're killing it out there.
[02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:18.830]  That's what I aspire to do, to be out there under the sun making a difference.
[02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:22.510]  You know, so that's, you know, we're getting there.
[02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:23.390]  We're getting there.
[02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:24.830]  I told you our five year plan.
[02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:26.910]  So it's we're going to we're working on that too.
[02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:28.350]  Good.
[02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:34.590]  Yeah, he's out there getting it set up from the ground up, building buildings and facilities.
[02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:36.190]  Mad love and respect to all of those people.
[02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:38.030]  Those are the yeah, man.
[02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:41.150]  I would I would love an opportunity like that.
[02:09:41.150 --> 02:09:46.510]  I would be nervous as hell about an opportunity like that, but I would love it if it was my own
[02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:47.230]  investment.
[02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:49.230]  So that's awesome.
[02:09:49.230 --> 02:09:50.990]  Yeah, I like following what they're doing there.
[02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:52.830]  I'm not eating from the farmer's market, though.
[02:09:55.710 --> 02:09:56.590]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:58.030]  Bugs, bugs.
[02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:03.870]  Yeah, my sister's sister and her family traveled in that area.
[02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:05.550]  And I do want to try a silkworm.
[02:10:05.550 --> 02:10:06.430]  I guess they're pretty good.
[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:07.230]  That's what he said.
[02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:12.270]  Yeah, I got nothing to say.
[02:10:13.150 --> 02:10:14.110]  I don't know.
[02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:20.270]  Chef, tell us as a chef, man, where do insects fall into the fall into the menu here?
[02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:23.870]  Have you ever infused a insect?
[02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:29.550]  No, no, the bugs beneath my feet.
[02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:32.030]  They're awfully sweet and pretty neat.
[02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:33.550]  But do I keep them?
[02:10:35.070 --> 02:10:36.190]  I don't like to toil.
[02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:39.150]  What is that?
[02:10:39.150 --> 02:10:39.870]  What is that?
[02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:42.110]  Oh, geez.
[02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:43.230]  I don't know.
[02:10:43.230 --> 02:10:45.390]  I'm just going to join him some sour.
[02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:48.270]  I don't say that was the product of his second joint.
[02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:50.750]  I was like that was that was.
[02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:56.110]  All right, so tell us, did you grow that one?
[02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:59.230]  I did, I did.
[02:10:59.230 --> 02:11:04.270]  Yes, this is a sour diesel cross to the San Fernando Valley.
[02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:10.670]  Oh, gosh, BX three, similar to John's headband, but not from Swerve.
[02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:13.710]  This was bred by Gandias Farm.
[02:11:13.710 --> 02:11:14.990]  Shout out to Gabe Ruth.
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:23.070]  I found him through Kevin Gregory, and he is putting in some serious work.
[02:11:23.070 --> 02:11:27.710]  The sour diesel that he used for this is from Mr. Bob Hemphill's cut.
[02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:32.430]  He and Bob did a little swap, I believe.
[02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:33.470]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:11:33.550 --> 02:11:43.150]  Gabe, I'm sorry, but he's held the NL5 for like 20 years out in the west from a friend
[02:11:43.150 --> 02:11:51.070]  of his from Seattle, and he did a swap for his NL5 to Bob for the sour diesel cut.
[02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:59.150]  He's been doing some work with that and his NL5 by two and some super lemon haze and some
[02:11:59.150 --> 02:12:08.430]  super lemon A5 tie crosses and some really good work with the SFV OG BX3 that he got from
[02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:11.630]  Shaw Bud 707 seed bank.
[02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:22.110]  One of the gaps to, it was the SFV OG that Skunk VA used for the work that he did with
[02:12:22.110 --> 02:12:28.190]  the SFV OG BX2, but now it's at the BX3, and that's the male that hit the sour D.
[02:12:29.230 --> 02:12:31.550]  It's got me feeling a certain way right now, gentlemen.
[02:12:33.070 --> 02:12:39.310]  I was going to say that's going to be a pretty powerful punch there.
[02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:40.670]  How did it grow for you?
[02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:46.430]  Was it a kind of a bitch to grow or was it easy?
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:47.390]  Long and lanky?
[02:12:49.150 --> 02:12:52.750]  Well, actually, this one had more of the OG lean onto it.
[02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:54.030]  I had a couple of phenos.
[02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:58.750]  One of them that was actually a little bit more difficult to grow that was more towards
[02:12:58.750 --> 02:13:05.630]  the sour diesel leaner that smelled an awful lot like John's green headband pheno, that
[02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:06.590]  super sour.
[02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:07.310]  That's squished.
[02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:08.590]  It's squished really well too.
[02:13:08.590 --> 02:13:09.390]  That was delicious.
[02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:12.750]  But that was the one that didn't set up actually, John.
[02:13:12.750 --> 02:13:17.310]  The one that squished really well and did set up nice and battered and turned in some
[02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:21.070]  beautiful rods and is the one that I'm smoking here, which is the number three girl.
[02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:27.790]  And that one was more kind of like that was the SFV, but it had kind of like a chem D
[02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:31.230]  kind of funk to it, which was nice.
[02:13:32.110 --> 02:13:34.110]  But yeah, that one made a beautiful rosin.
[02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:36.830]  I have some in the fridge over there curing right now.
[02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:44.270]  Hoda Erb's keeping an eye on it with his wonderful sticker of his awesome bucket hat.
[02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:50.350]  So I got that right on my dab fridge, keeping its little eyes on my fridge, keeping all
[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:51.150]  my dabs safe.
[02:13:51.150 --> 02:13:52.030]  So thank you, Hoda.
[02:13:56.830 --> 02:14:01.630]  I'll have to share some SFV OG with you next time or the sour SFV next time we see each
[02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:01.870]  other.
[02:14:04.190 --> 02:14:08.030]  We grew up some beautiful plants this year out in his garden outdoors, man.
[02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:10.910]  He really he pulled some weight out of there too, man.
[02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:16.350]  In that small space, dude, you really rock those plants that that man and the G4 line
[02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:23.390]  like I punted this this G4 line from Brandon Russ, the G4 line 1BX.
[02:14:24.110 --> 02:14:33.230]  And yeah, it's definitely the one that's the the the GG line leaner because I had another
[02:14:33.230 --> 02:14:38.270]  Fino that was in Brandon commented on a post because I was like, look, an amazing work.
[02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.990]  This is awesome.
[02:14:39.550 --> 02:14:41.310]  And it has beautiful colors.
[02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:44.910]  And and it's really lime.
[02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.590]  It's really so lime forward.
[02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:48.750]  But with the fuel, it's really.
[02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.110]  Yeah.
[02:14:50.110 --> 02:14:50.510]  Yeah.
[02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:54.990]  Jason and Kay Knetic stuck his nose in it and immediately was like, oh, you can smell
[02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.550]  the lime there.
[02:14:55.550 --> 02:15:00.990]  He's working with a lot of different lime stuff from Mean Gene that he's worked himself
[02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:06.750]  over the years and some other awesome genetics from Caleb Inspecta and stuff that he's
[02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:08.750]  acclimatized to his farm.
[02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:10.270]  And he hit his nose to that.
[02:15:10.270 --> 02:15:16.830]  And he showed me some some lime skyjarro stuff that had a similar nose to it, too.
[02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:19.390]  And yeah, he really enjoyed that one.
[02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:23.630]  That GG line, you know, that there, John, is something special for sure.
[02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:31.630]  It's beautiful, like vivid foliage, like like you would see here in New England, that's
[02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:35.230]  got that like maple leaf, beautiful fade to it's amazing.
[02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:36.990]  Yeah, but it's very lime.
[02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.710]  It's very lime.
[02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:40.030]  And really, I don't have it in this run.
[02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:45.470]  I mean, but yeah, that was a really nice potent plant.
[02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.830]  I don't think I tested that one.
[02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:47.790]  I didn't have that one.
[02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:53.150]  I wish I had that one in the cup because I really want to be able to be like say some
[02:15:53.150 --> 02:15:58.750]  breeders name and give them credit for like, you know, I don't want it just to be about,
[02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:01.070]  you know, GG four times as your arrow.
[02:16:01.070 --> 02:16:09.630]  Yeah, I'm excited to get into a few things that I've gotten from Mean Gene.
[02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:12.750]  There's a cherry limeade times gelato 33.
[02:16:14.190 --> 02:16:16.110]  I got some black lime as well.
[02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:21.550]  Some things, yeah, I really want to dive into the sky Jaro as well.
[02:16:21.550 --> 02:16:22.350]  Oh, let's see here.
[02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:24.430]  I had that BLR.
[02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:25.470]  We have the BLR.
[02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:26.350]  We grew it outside.
[02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:31.710]  It still came out really good, but that I can really see how the GG four lime because
[02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:41.550]  the lime one is, I believe the mom of the, the lime one is the mom of the, what was I
[02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:42.110]  trying to say?
[02:16:44.350 --> 02:16:45.150]  Of the black lime.
[02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:47.310]  Lime one is the mom of the GG four.
[02:16:47.310 --> 02:16:47.810]  Yeah.
[02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:52.510]  What do I have Mean Genes?
[02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:57.550]  I have, well, I have a cross that Dutch did that I'm really excited to get into.
[02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:00.670]  Actually, I have a bunch of packs from Dutch that I need to dig into.
[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:05.470]  I got a lot of regenerative seeds that I'm going to pop for this season, at least six
[02:17:05.470 --> 02:17:06.910]  or seven different strains.
[02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:13.790]  So I have to pick two strains from each farmer and there's more farmers and more strains
[02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:15.070]  than I have the space for.
[02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:20.590]  So it's going to be really hard to decide what is going to get flowered out outside
[02:17:20.590 --> 02:17:23.550]  and what gets kept and brought along.
[02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:33.390]  But from Dutch and Mean Gene, it's the 88 G13 hash plant to the Sky Cuddler Cush.
[02:17:33.390 --> 02:17:37.710]  I think Dutch calls it the Hash Cuddler Cush or the Hash Cuddler.
[02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.750]  Yeah.
[02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:41.550]  And then from Mean Gene, that's going to be really exciting.
[02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:51.550]  And then from Mean Gene, I got the grape soda or the lime soda skunk BX2, which is the
[02:17:51.550 --> 02:18:00.430]  lime 1 BX cross to the grape soda skunk F2, I believe.
[02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:07.550]  And that is also like a lime 1 BX.
[02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:12.030]  But they're supposed to be, if you look on Mean Gene's page, like I think maybe in the
[02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:16.510]  last two months, there was a group of small plants that he was growing that purpled out
[02:18:16.510 --> 02:18:21.310]  when he was growing them out in either small cups or one gallons,
[02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:21.630]  maybe.
[02:18:22.430 --> 02:18:23.870]  And they're like high CBD plants.
[02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:28.190]  He was saying that's, I believe, from that stock or that group of plants is that grape
[02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.910]  soda skunk.
[02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:30.190]  Yeah.
[02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.510]  Okay.
[02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:34.190]  I do remember being taken back by that post.
[02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:35.710]  I'm like, oh, nice.
[02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:43.630]  Because, god dang, he's like, when you say the word breeder, like he's, I mean, he doesn't
[02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:45.150]  call himself a breeder, really.
[02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:48.990]  But he, dude, that guy works the lines.
[02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:51.550]  He takes years to make decisions.
[02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:55.470]  Like, god, I love him.
[02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:57.550]  You heard about what Kevin says about him, right?
[02:18:57.550 --> 02:19:00.750]  He's like, you know, Mean Gene, I don't even know the gentleman, man.
[02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:01.630]  I'm, bad respect.
[02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:04.670]  I watched all the people I see on it.
[02:19:04.670 --> 02:19:06.670]  It's like so crazy for me to be on it now.
[02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:11.070]  But what I'm trying to say is like, he has the biggest palette.
[02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:13.790]  He's like, you know, some people get the small box of crayons.
[02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:16.030]  He's got this big box of crayons.
[02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:17.950]  With a sharpener on the back, even.
[02:19:19.390 --> 02:19:19.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:25.710]  The sharpener, yeah, because he's got the F5s and the F6s on the lines.
[02:19:25.710 --> 02:19:29.630]  Yeah, that's the sharpener where you get your genetics and hone it.
[02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:34.270]  Yeah, to truly make things, you know, your own and unique.
[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:37.070]  And again, that takes so much time.
[02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:42.030]  You know, it's a lot of why Northern California, that Emerald Triangle is successful.
[02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:45.390]  Because up there, it's generational type thing.
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:48.110]  So, you know, and it's a collective, too.
[02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:50.830]  It's not everybody can do all the things.
[02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:55.150]  So, it's, well, that's the power is to stay connected and collective.
[02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:57.390]  You know, like that's where we need to realize that.
[02:19:59.230 --> 02:20:01.630]  Yeah, we need to preserve the culture, too.
[02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:03.870]  Sorry if that went off on another tangent.
[02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:06.590]  But like, yeah, man, that's the people who put on all the work.
[02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:10.110]  And that's why I want to get out there and be like,
[02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:12.830]  that's why I have double OG chem from Dan Rebel going in there.
[02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:13.710]  I got two females.
[02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:18.110]  I'm trying to do small hunts, but I can't do it.
[02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.910]  I don't have the space.
[02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:21.550]  So, I'm trying to work everybody in when I can.
[02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:25.470]  I got the Soto project, the reason we have those shirts from the Regen Conference.
[02:20:25.470 --> 02:20:26.990]  So, I got two females.
[02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:30.670]  I believe Chef's got one flowering now of his own selection.
[02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:34.350]  I have two different girls that I selected.
[02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:36.990]  I have two as well.
[02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:39.470]  And so, we're going to see what we can, you know, help out.
[02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:45.630]  Well, try and promote these people that we revere and respect in putting in the work, you know.
[02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:47.550]  Try and, you know, help.
[02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:52.750]  It's each one's each one, but we can all elevate each other, too.
[02:20:52.750 --> 02:20:54.110]  It's not just elevating the craft.
[02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:59.310]  It's elevating the culture, this plant, what it's really about, you know.
[02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:02.430]  And sourcing.
[02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:05.790]  I mean, that's something that I love about you guys coming to talk today.
[02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:09.310]  You get to share your experience with me, which gets shared with other people.
[02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:13.870]  Things that I've never been able to do or never thought of.
[02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:15.150]  And that's how we learn.
[02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:19.710]  Because especially with this plant, this plant takes time and it's taught me patience.
[02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:22.830]  It'll teach anybody patience if you want to do it right.
[02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:26.190]  But yeah, you only get so many grows per year.
[02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:30.270]  So, when you get to talk to 10 people who get the same amount of grows, it's just that
[02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:34.990]  community network, that learning experience, the neuro link, you know.
[02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:37.950]  So, I do enjoy that about this.
[02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:43.950]  I've been working with some auto flowering genetics the last few years and have been
[02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:50.270]  making certain selections on those and have gotten a couple passed up to F2, F3, and F4
[02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:55.310]  on some regs and stems selected for the outdoor out here.
[02:21:55.310 --> 02:22:01.870]  Obviously, not starting from scratch, but working off of some other gear, like another
[02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:07.550]  main breeder up here is a real Thor 88, working on the Thor's hammer, as well as some of
[02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:20.670]  the genetic stuff and Daz's stuff from heart of the lion, I believe is the farm part of
[02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:21.150]  the lion.
[02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:34.190]  So, sour stomper to the Thor's hammer is up to F4 right now.
[02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:38.750]  And we've done a few seasons of that outside here, kind of hardening that up.
[02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:40.990]  And those are at regs.
[02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:47.310]  So, trying to find some, I have some Russian root aralis genetics that I got from Guardian
[02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:48.190]  of the Lost Terps.
[02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:56.510]  Shout out to, yeah, he's got different varieties there that he's preserving for breeding projects.
[02:22:56.510 --> 02:23:01.550]  So, I got some of that that I want to do some crosses to some certain photo period stock
[02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:03.550]  and try to work those over the years.
[02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:06.670]  It's going to take some time, but I love this plant.
[02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:13.870]  I've got some stuff that goes on on the side, is trying to acclimate some auto flowering
[02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:15.310]  genetics to the Northeast.
[02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:18.830]  That way, like you said, we only get some new rows per year, right?
[02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:27.310]  Well, outside I time my crops to where I can hold down three auto flower, even four auto
[02:23:27.310 --> 02:23:31.390]  flower harvests consecutively before my photo periods are done.
[02:23:31.390 --> 02:23:32.750]  Wow, right.
[02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:37.070]  So, like, well, I'm a chef and also biomass is my friend.
[02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:38.990]  So, like, I get a lot of good flower out of it.
[02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:43.790]  I need really good smoking flower that has good turf profiles.
[02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:46.670]  And then I also get a lot of material for what I'm doing.
[02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:52.430]  So, like, if you time this right, yeah, you can, like, utilize this free beautiful sun
[02:23:52.430 --> 02:23:59.790]  that gives us all of these full spectrum cannabinoids that, you know, and every cannabis plant is
[02:23:59.790 --> 02:24:07.070]  so special that these different auto flowering varieties have so many of these profiles that
[02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:10.750]  you're not getting in what we're seeing today that's on the market for these strains that
[02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:15.310]  are so, and even in some of the connoisseur strains that you're getting that are photo
[02:24:15.310 --> 02:24:20.430]  periods that do have these unique profiles, they're still different from that.
[02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:24.270]  So, it's all vital medicine that we need, right?
[02:24:24.270 --> 02:24:29.150]  Because we have an endocannabinoid system and we're trying to supplement with phyto
[02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:34.030]  cannabinoids and terpenes and secondary plant metabolites.
[02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:42.910]  So, it's like, if we can diversify our sources and be resourceful with our resources and
[02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:49.630]  our energy and, like, let's utilize what we can, where we can, how we can, and be as
[02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:53.470]  efficient as we can while we're doing it while trying to minimize our footprint.
[02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:53.790]  You know?
[02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:57.390]  Yeah.
[02:24:57.390 --> 02:25:02.510]  I mean, that area hasn't been explored nearly as much as, you know, the regular market.
[02:25:03.470 --> 02:25:06.430]  And FEMS, not really going to see much difference.
[02:25:06.430 --> 02:25:10.990]  But when you do start bringing in, you know, the auto flowering traits and those types
[02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:16.110]  of genetics and some plants that, because from what I understand, it usually takes about
[02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:20.430]  four or five generations before you really are getting full autos every time when you
[02:25:20.430 --> 02:25:21.470]  mix the two.
[02:25:21.470 --> 02:25:26.910]  But through that selection process and that combination, we're going to see things that
[02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:29.230]  we don't see just hunting regs.
[02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:34.510]  Because that is one thing I love about legalization, man, is all of these new profiles that we're
[02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:35.470]  discovering.
[02:25:35.470 --> 02:25:35.870]  Why?
[02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:38.270]  Because everybody's freaking popping beans now.
[02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:43.390]  So, it's just sheer numbers before not as many people were going through things.
[02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:46.990]  And usually, they just buy one particular thing.
[02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:47.870]  Anyways.
[02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:51.950]  But yeah, you're going to get some different things coming out of that auto flower world.
[02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:57.470]  It'll be interesting to see develop because it's not main stage yet, but they are solid
[02:25:57.470 --> 02:25:58.110]  side stage.
[02:25:58.670 --> 02:26:00.350]  I was always on the fence with it.
[02:26:00.350 --> 02:26:01.550]  And I only grew one.
[02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:03.630]  The first one I grew, he gave me and I didn't.
[02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:04.430]  And I messed it up.
[02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:05.470]  I stunted it.
[02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:08.590]  There's a lot of different techniques you need to do with the auto flower.
[02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:13.070]  But I was like, Rudy Ellis, why do I want Rudy Ellis in my genetics?
[02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:15.150]  I want something, you know, why would that be?
[02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:16.750]  But now I understand.
[02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:20.350]  And even Jeff Lowenfeld wrote a book about the auto flowering.
[02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:24.830]  And I do see it as a really a good gateway to people growing because it takes away a
[02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:25.790]  lot of the guesswork.
[02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:31.470]  There's some sensitivity and just planting it in its kind of pot that it's going to finish
[02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:32.030]  in.
[02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:34.030]  And but it is amazing.
[02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:41.550]  He was saying he pulled three beautiful, like, and you can't tell it apart sometimes when
[02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:44.910]  it's a really good, like these other guys, like he was talking about that put in the
[02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:47.470]  work ahead of him is like solid work.
[02:26:47.470 --> 02:26:54.270]  So it's like, but he's definitely, you got that into who did you get that into Dutch's
[02:26:54.270 --> 02:26:56.910]  hands or to or Steensland or someone else?
[02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:05.230]  I gave some to Dutch, I gave some to Rebel Dan, I gave, I think I gave some to Joshua
[02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:05.950]  Steensland.
[02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:10.430]  Someone popped some though they were posting up for a while.
[02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:11.390]  I don't know.
[02:27:11.390 --> 02:27:17.390]  There are some trades, you know, they've gotten into some hands and some good garden.
[02:27:18.350 --> 02:27:18.910]  Definitely.
[02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:23.310]  I found some volunteers actually came up, I made some hash last year.
[02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:27.790]  And, you know, I told you, I put all my old cannabis oil into my vegetable garden.
[02:27:28.430 --> 02:27:35.230]  Well, I also before my vegetable garden starts, I kind of just dump all my, like spent hash
[02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:36.510]  washes into my garden.
[02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:41.070]  So like top dress with the old cannabis scrap or whatever.
[02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:43.390]  Well, some seed made it into there this year.
[02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:48.350]  And I had some beautiful volunteers that came out, you know, mean gene echoed in my head.
[02:27:49.310 --> 02:27:51.150]  Breed with the volunteers.
[02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:59.310]  They weren't a volunteer, they were put there, you know, they were sent by the aliens.
[02:27:59.950 --> 02:28:00.510]  Exactly.
[02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:02.910]  Well, it was beautiful and gorgeous and frosty.
[02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:07.150]  And so I had some, some regular auto flower pollen that I had.
[02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:10.830]  And I said, well, I'm going to, you know, keep you because this was an auto as well.
[02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:16.270]  But yeah, so I gave some of those to Jason at Cape Medic Sun Grown.
[02:28:16.270 --> 02:28:20.670]  And he's going to, he gave me some of his farm autos that were also bred the same way.
[02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:26.110]  And we chatted about that mean gene thing I just said, and, you know, chuckled.
[02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:27.150]  So we had a little swap.
[02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:32.350]  I gave him garden auto, he gave me farm auto, and we'll see what's in there and good stuff.
[02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.650]  Yeah.
[02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:39.150]  Yeah, that's usually the hold back for most people is just getting the regulars autos,
[02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:41.790]  because you have to have a male and you're not able to keep things.
[02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:45.230]  So you have to like select each round for those.
[02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:49.710]  But there are, there's a lot of, you know, again, it's a progression like anything.
[02:28:49.710 --> 02:28:51.390]  It's like regulars too.
[02:28:51.390 --> 02:28:55.470]  They're just the profiles and the cannabinoid things.
[02:28:55.470 --> 02:28:58.190]  They, things, I can't believe I just said thing.
[02:28:58.190 --> 02:29:01.550]  The profiles, as far as like taste and the cannabinoid profiles,
[02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:05.310]  I didn't want to double dip on the profiles there, but yeah, don't say thing.
[02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:06.190]  It makes you sound dumb.
[02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:11.310]  But just the, you know, we're seeing so much more with regulars.
[02:29:11.310 --> 02:29:13.310]  And now we're seeing so much more with autos.
[02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:18.670]  Auto is, you know, only had like a couple of years, whereas this may have had more years,
[02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:20.670]  but it's going to catch up for me.
[02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:27.230]  Like the one way that I can tell it's an auto is because it's a big fat fricking cola on like
[02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.950]  every branch.
[02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:29.710]  I'm like, that's an auto.
[02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:33.070]  That's really the only way I can tell that's, that's, that's my one giveaway.
[02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:38.990]  But other than that, I'm sure I have smoked autos and have been like, okay, it's good
[02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.950]  because it is there.
[02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:42.510]  Not all of it, but not all regulars is good either.
[02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:47.550]  No, no, fair assessment.
[02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:51.310]  You know, they, they still need a lot of work, but they have come a long way.
[02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:54.750]  And I'll give a shout out to Nome Automatics.
[02:29:54.750 --> 02:29:55.550]  That's Dan Jimmy.
[02:29:55.550 --> 02:30:00.350]  He's out at the Emerald Cup right now with Dino Myco sharing a booth and pumping out some
[02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:03.950]  awesome seeds that he's been working on for over a decade.
[02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:10.750]  He's worked with some Pacific Northwest roots, genetics and green source garden genetics.
[02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:17.390]  And yeah, he's been putting in a lot of work for a long time, him and Daz and Mephisto.
[02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:23.150]  So those guys have been doing it and refining it and moving it forward.
[02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:25.230]  So I'm just doing a little.
[02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:28.830]  You said he was working with green source gardens, Nicholas Mahmood out there, man.
[02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:30.430]  He's like a hero to me.
[02:30:30.430 --> 02:30:37.630]  So he's worked with the Pinkleberry, I think into the auto format that got through
[02:30:37.710 --> 02:30:41.150]  Ross Kaya, Pacific Northwest roots.
[02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:46.350]  But Kaya got the genetics passed to him through green source.
[02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:50.750]  So that genetics originally were green source genetics, but Kaya, I believe,
[02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:56.430]  moved them forward a couple of generations before also getting them to Stapleye
[02:30:58.590 --> 02:31:01.470]  original gangster who did another generation.
[02:31:01.470 --> 02:31:06.430]  And I think Sticky Richie just did F7s to F8 on the Pinkleberries too.
[02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:12.030]  So some important work getting done with some bare, rough, solid genetics.
[02:31:12.750 --> 02:31:12.990]  Yeah.
[02:31:14.430 --> 02:31:18.510]  Those are amongst the names that I hear frequently brought up and, you know,
[02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:21.470]  pictures that I frequently see where I'm like, you know, it's a damn, you know,
[02:31:21.470 --> 02:31:22.990]  it's a damn nice plant.
[02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:23.950]  It looks really nice.
[02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:31.710]  And it just reminded me to work in for that other project I mentioned with Joint Doctor
[02:31:32.830 --> 02:31:33.470]  from Seisman.
[02:31:33.470 --> 02:31:35.550]  But that's the dude who brought autos.
[02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:39.870]  That's the guy who was the crazy one who said, I think we've got something here.
[02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:46.590]  So, yeah, it has come a long way since Lowrider and that type stuff.
[02:31:48.350 --> 02:31:49.550]  What one was that called?
[02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:51.790]  That was the Lowrider, right?
[02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:52.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:31:52.270 --> 02:31:53.310]  He just said, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:54.030]  Yeah.
[02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:55.470]  Yeah.
[02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:55.710]  Yeah.
[02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:57.390]  I think I have that.
[02:31:58.670 --> 02:32:01.630]  Is it in the big book of bugs or the can of Bible?
[02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:02.590]  In there.
[02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:04.350]  I think one of those books I have over there.
[02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:06.110]  Oh, I bet it is.
[02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:15.310]  I had a test out at 22% THC and 26% THC and so in 20, even 28% on some.
[02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:16.510]  Respectable, definitely.
[02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.710]  For sure.
[02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:23.630]  And they're definitely putting good photo period crosses into them.
[02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:25.550]  But don't get me wrong.
[02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:26.270]  I'm not preaching.
[02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:27.070]  That's all there is.
[02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:30.750]  I grow majority photo period plants.
[02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.670]  Yeah.
[02:32:32.670 --> 02:32:33.470]  They have their photos.
[02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:35.710]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:36.190]  Yeah.
[02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:37.630]  Take a look at them if you haven't.
[02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:40.190]  Yeah, I like autos.
[02:32:40.190 --> 02:32:42.910]  That's, I like regulars.
[02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:43.870]  That's what I grow.
[02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:46.110]  That's my preference.
[02:32:46.110 --> 02:32:51.710]  But if I did have autos, I mentioned that I can't grow outdoors here because of the season.
[02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:57.070]  But if I had a good auto, I could totally toss one out and get that finished before
[02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:58.430]  the rains come here.
[02:32:58.510 --> 02:33:02.030]  If I didn't have jerk ass neighbors, that would probably report me.
[02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:06.030]  I'll get you out of this after, bro, and I'll send you some seeds.
[02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:09.230]  I will try them, dude.
[02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:09.870]  I will do it.
[02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.550]  Thank you.
[02:33:12.430 --> 02:33:12.910]  Hell yeah.
[02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:18.270]  Was it that you had the volunteer that you're like, what am I going to do?
[02:33:18.270 --> 02:33:19.390]  It's over the fence now.
[02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:20.990]  Like it was a monster.
[02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:22.430]  I had to post the one you moved.
[02:33:23.470 --> 02:33:25.470]  I was like, yeah, no, we're going to take the root ball.
[02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:27.790]  As long as we get the root ball intact, get that out of there.
[02:33:28.430 --> 02:33:29.390]  I think you'll be all right.
[02:33:29.390 --> 02:33:32.270]  And it took a little bit, but she came back and wow.
[02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:41.550]  So that one was a photo period that I uprooted and then it came back after a while.
[02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:43.390]  But the auto was right next to it.
[02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:45.470]  And that one still got to five feet.
[02:33:45.470 --> 02:33:47.470]  I did have to tie it back to two stakes.
[02:33:47.470 --> 02:33:48.590]  And it was like an S.
[02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:57.870]  The main stem came up and then I had to tie it back because it was going to go over the
[02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:58.370]  fence.
[02:33:59.710 --> 02:34:04.830]  But that's what got hit with the sour stomper, thor pollen.
[02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:06.270]  But yeah, I'll get some of this.
[02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:06.910]  I'll get some of this.
[02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:10.110]  I'll get some of the other one.
[02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:12.190]  Yeah, it kind of went like that.
[02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:14.910]  That's how you get an eight foot plant.
[02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:19.630]  And this is all, I still have the buds hanging like this, you know what I mean?
[02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:23.230]  But yeah, it looks like antlers if I get them together.
[02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:27.070]  I want to like, I know the Mendo Dope Boys make a microphone stand.
[02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:30.270]  But I was going to make some antlers out of that.
[02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:33.710]  That's hilarious.
[02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:35.870]  Because it's like a candelabra.
[02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:38.510]  Like that's the space I have to deal with.
[02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:41.630]  But I am growing some pretty monster plants for the space.
[02:34:42.350 --> 02:34:43.150]  Fuck yeah, man.
[02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:45.870]  Killing the grow space.
[02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:47.790]  No, it's killing me.
[02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:48.990]  Seriously, it's killing me.
[02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:51.950]  Well, what the...
[02:34:53.390 --> 02:34:54.590]  Before they put you to bed.
[02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:59.230]  So what do you got?
[02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.830]  Go ahead, please.
[02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:02.670]  No, no, no.
[02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:06.030]  Please talk to the chef because I'm just, I have the gift to gab.
[02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:09.470]  And my tangents go all over the place.
[02:35:09.470 --> 02:35:12.190]  So, it's about the plant.
[02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:14.270]  We're having a good three-way conversation.
[02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.830]  It's all good.
[02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:16.590]  Everybody likes hearing from you too.
[02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:17.790]  It's cool.
[02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:19.710]  Nobody's watching the clock.
[02:35:21.390 --> 02:35:25.550]  But yeah, I was just kind of going to ask, you know, what is going to be coming up in
[02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:27.870]  your grow rooms?
[02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:29.790]  And this is a question for both of you.
[02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:31.470]  Maybe we'll start with chef this time.
[02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:33.710]  Shout out to Budgasm.
[02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:34.750]  Thank you, Peter.
[02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:35.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:35.070 --> 02:35:36.430]  This is next on our list.
[02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:38.030]  I just got this in the mail today.
[02:35:39.470 --> 02:35:40.110]  Nice, man.
[02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:41.630]  Excited to get those started.
[02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:43.470]  And he gave me some daga.
[02:35:43.470 --> 02:35:44.190]  Some daga.
[02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:45.150]  Oh, that's right.
[02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:46.190]  Huh?
[02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:47.710]  So I don't know if I...
[02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.910]  You know, I'm jealous.
[02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:51.390]  You guys already got your beans warming up.
[02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:53.950]  A little lemon degreaser.
[02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:55.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:56.190]  That's it, right?
[02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:57.310]  Yeah.
[02:35:57.310 --> 02:35:58.670]  You know, he gave me...
[02:35:58.670 --> 02:36:01.470]  I was joking with the chef earlier before we got on.
[02:36:01.470 --> 02:36:02.670]  I was like, oh, wow.
[02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:04.430]  He sent me some arugula seeds.
[02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:08.670]  Did they know that I let all my shit pollinate outside?
[02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:09.870]  So I have arugula.
[02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:10.910]  I have chives.
[02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:11.870]  I have it popping up.
[02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:17.870]  Like, I don't have to plant arugula anymore, but I'm going to see if this is a better variety.
[02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:21.230]  But the chef allowed me to use his weed whacker.
[02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:24.910]  And he came up and remember, all he smelled was chives and arugula because...
[02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:27.310]  Oh, so beautiful.
[02:36:27.310 --> 02:36:30.350]  So my neighbors have packs and packs of my seeds.
[02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:32.430]  All over the...
[02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:35.310]  I have arugula farm.
[02:36:35.310 --> 02:36:37.150]  So I was like, yeah, and I love arugula.
[02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:38.590]  So I'm excited to see...
[02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:40.270]  Now the name is different.
[02:36:42.350 --> 02:36:48.990]  And I'm wondering, I know he's got a farm out here in Connecticut or New England somewhere.
[02:36:48.990 --> 02:36:50.270]  I was watching him one time.
[02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:52.030]  So thank you, Peter.
[02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:52.750]  Mad respect.
[02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:57.150]  This program and this platform has been amazing.
[02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:57.790]  I've been a fan.
[02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:01.470]  I've been a participant watching and listening.
[02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:07.550]  And yeah, thank you for helping elevate the craft.
[02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:10.510]  This is like, it's a valuable resource for everybody.
[02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:12.590]  I've learned so much.
[02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:14.670]  He's awesome.
[02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:16.270]  Because he does.
[02:37:16.270 --> 02:37:18.750]  He likes to send out a lot of seeds from his own garden.
[02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:22.350]  That I saw that I was envious of that garden.
[02:37:22.350 --> 02:37:22.990]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:24.110]  It's some heirloom stuff.
[02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:25.150]  I think it's in Connecticut.
[02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:27.950]  Fruit trees and stuff they're putting in and stuff.
[02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:29.150]  I think, oh man, that looks...
[02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:30.830]  Yeah, he's got...
[02:37:32.110 --> 02:37:34.030]  He's up at the Emerald Cup right now.
[02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:37.310]  So he's living life.
[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:40.430]  Hopefully living life up there, man.
[02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:42.110]  I don't see any live feeds.
[02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:46.350]  So hopefully he's just being able to be Peter and kick it instead of having to manage a
[02:37:46.350 --> 02:37:50.990]  microphone and cameras and pull people in and do all these things that he does without
[02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:52.430]  thinking twice.
[02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:54.910]  But hopefully, yeah, he's the man, dude.
[02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:57.550]  Get some relaxing time, Peter.
[02:37:58.270 --> 02:37:59.390]  You deserve it.
[02:37:59.390 --> 02:37:59.950]  You deserve it.
[02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:04.190]  But yeah, so actually we're gonna have to pop these soon.
[02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:05.870]  Did you get any, Chef?
[02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:06.670]  Did you get some yet?
[02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:07.950]  I haven't gotten mine yet.
[02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:12.910]  But I didn't get a chance to email Peter until I think two days after John did, I think.
[02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:14.990]  So I'll be patient.
[02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:16.030]  I'll give him some time.
[02:38:16.270 --> 02:38:17.790]  Let him get home from the Emerald Cup.
[02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:22.030]  And then I'll be joining you all on that as well very soon.
[02:38:22.030 --> 02:38:26.750]  I just got a little two small tents to accommodate.
[02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:29.230]  I got a little two by two for germinating some stuff.
[02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:34.830]  And then I got a three by three for some teenage plants that'll help stage out some stuff.
[02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:41.870]  That way I can make room for this stuff and some new genetics that we're gonna be digging
[02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:43.150]  into here pretty soon too.
[02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:45.230]  Nice.
[02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:48.190]  And yeah, that's kind of how I set it up here too.
[02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:50.990]  I got the little, the two by two that's on its side.
[02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:52.910]  That's where I do my cloning and seed popping.
[02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:54.110]  And then I got a three by three.
[02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:57.630]  And I'm just gonna have to flower these early.
[02:38:57.630 --> 02:38:59.790]  I'm going back to Amsterdam in April.
[02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:06.350]  So these need to like sprout, veg, and finish before April 15th.
[02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.550]  Then I got it.
[02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:10.910]  Yeah, I saw that you were planning a trip for 420.
[02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:13.150]  Yes, 420.
[02:39:13.150 --> 02:39:14.910]  Gonna finally be on.
[02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:15.950]  I love Amsterdam.
[02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:20.270]  We go once a year, but we're gonna be there actually on 420 this year.
[02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:23.230]  So hell yeah, that'll be a fun day.
[02:39:23.230 --> 02:39:25.230]  I already know where we're gonna be, what we'll do.
[02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:29.710]  It's yeah, Amsterdam's a really easy city to get around.
[02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:33.390]  Easy to figure out where everything is too.
[02:39:33.390 --> 02:39:35.470]  So it's awesome.
[02:39:35.470 --> 02:39:36.590]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:39:37.470 --> 02:39:40.350]  It sounds like such a good time to be going there, man.
[02:39:40.350 --> 02:39:44.670]  It's probably a really happening time at Amsterdam for sure.
[02:39:45.310 --> 02:39:46.590]  We'll find out, man.
[02:39:46.590 --> 02:39:47.150]  We'll find out.
[02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:49.230]  It'll be my first 420 there.
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:51.390]  Thank you.
[02:39:51.390 --> 02:39:54.910]  So yeah, so these will be new in the garden for all of us.
[02:39:56.430 --> 02:40:00.590]  Anything new genetics wise, or even just like practice wise?
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:05.230]  Anything, any SOPs you're changing, any equipment you're changing,
[02:40:05.230 --> 02:40:08.350]  any soil recipes you're changing next time?
[02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:11.470]  How about you, John, first?
[02:40:12.430 --> 02:40:13.470]  I'm running.
[02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:16.990]  I just said, Chef helped me set up a five by five and also this tent
[02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:20.190]  so I can press my rosin and not take up the kitchen
[02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:22.750]  and respect Maria's kitchen upstairs.
[02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:25.470]  So I'm in this like six by eight.
[02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:28.750]  This is my squishing and freeze drying.
[02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:29.870]  The pump will be outside.
[02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:36.430]  So this is my kind of clean room or spot to accommodate the space that I don't have
[02:40:36.430 --> 02:40:37.870]  because the space is still killing me.
[02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:39.550]  I know that's a callback.
[02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:50.270]  But yeah, so I just set up a five by five.
[02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:53.870]  I pulled down a three by three because it was also
[02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:56.430]  all the mylar was peeling off of it.
[02:40:56.430 --> 02:40:58.430]  I didn't like the fact that I could see like glitter.
[02:40:58.430 --> 02:41:01.630]  I'm like, oh, I haven't been to the club.
[02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:03.550]  I swear it's on the tent.
[02:41:04.430 --> 02:41:06.030]  Anyway, I'm just being a wise ass.
[02:41:06.030 --> 02:41:08.110]  But seriously, I was like, I got to get rid of this
[02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:10.670]  because even though I'm only vegging in it, I'm not flowering in it.
[02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:12.510]  It's like, I don't know what's in this.
[02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:13.630]  That's not cool.
[02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:16.350]  So I set up a five by five in the three by five space
[02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:21.230]  and I just outfitted it with two three 15s.
[02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:27.950]  350 R-spec HLG and then solar cure bulb.
[02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:30.670]  So we're going to see how that's going to be.
[02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:31.230]  That's flower.
[02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:34.350]  That's floor flower room two.
[02:41:34.350 --> 02:41:36.350]  Now that's flower room two.
[02:41:36.350 --> 02:41:38.350]  The eight by eight is where I flower everything in.
[02:41:38.350 --> 02:41:42.430]  And I dry in it because it's easier to keep that 60 60.
[02:41:42.430 --> 02:41:45.310]  Like right now I have a whole room, you know, so.
[02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:47.470]  And I'm still crawling around, dude.
[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:49.550]  I'll send you pictures of like those plants.
[02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:50.670]  I had 12 of those plants.
[02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:51.390]  That's my limit.
[02:41:52.030 --> 02:41:54.830]  And basically had to.
[02:41:55.390 --> 02:41:57.390]  And I'm getting too old to be crawling around on my.
[02:41:57.390 --> 02:41:59.630]  But, you know, it's my plant yoga.
[02:41:59.630 --> 02:42:00.750]  I do the do the.
[02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:04.270]  Yeah, I got I got to go through.
[02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:06.510]  And then I have things tied down.
[02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:09.390]  It's just I'm not.
[02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:13.390]  Well, you learn a lot by doing it different ways.
[02:42:13.390 --> 02:42:16.190]  And I and I actually learned a lot from this last run,
[02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:18.270]  having different size plants in there.
[02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:22.110]  And I'm really interested to see what's going to yield more or less
[02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:24.910]  from the plants that were vegged more or less.
[02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:25.470]  You know what I mean?
[02:42:27.390 --> 02:42:30.590]  So if it's worth growing the bigger plant,
[02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:32.270]  but it's about the plant count, too.
[02:42:32.350 --> 02:42:34.750]  So it's kind of like that's.
[02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:37.150]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:44.350]  Like I can choose to run more smaller plants or only a few larger plants.
[02:42:44.350 --> 02:42:47.310]  I like variety, so I typically opt for the more smaller.
[02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:54.030]  But last, you know, that last run was bigger and it filled the full,
[02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:56.030]  you know, four filled the full tent.
[02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:58.190]  So, hey, whatever.
[02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:59.710]  I'll be smoking it for a while.
[02:42:59.710 --> 02:43:01.550]  Good thing it's the ones that I love most.
[02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:05.870]  And sometimes the ones that you love most are the ones that you need to grow more of,
[02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:08.990]  because then you realize just like any jar, if that's your favorite,
[02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:12.590]  that jar is gone first to concentrate, whatever it is you're going to,
[02:43:13.310 --> 02:43:18.590]  you know, and then you're like, oh, that was my medicine where I should have grown more of those.
[02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:19.630]  Why am I growing this?
[02:43:20.270 --> 02:43:23.630]  And you're trying to find out the next thing that might be the better thing.
[02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:26.590]  But in the meantime, you still need to grow your medicine.
[02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:30.510]  So it's kind of hard to not want to have half of the room, your medicine.
[02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:32.910]  And then the other half of this stuff you're trying to hunt and find,
[02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:37.310]  you know, because you want to, you know, if you're not looking,
[02:43:37.310 --> 02:43:38.830]  you're not going to find anything new.
[02:43:38.830 --> 02:43:44.990]  And so, well, yeah, maybe we can touch on that real quick, too,
[02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:50.190]  because I recently had to do that in the sake of finding new stuff.
[02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:52.030]  You know, I have limited space.
[02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:56.670]  There's only so many I can grow and I have things that I like,
[02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:58.510]  but I want to discover new things.
[02:43:58.510 --> 02:44:02.910]  And you can't do that by just a couple of plants at a time.
[02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:07.230]  It's you know, I've got a lot of seeds that I need to go through or want to go through.
[02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:10.190]  So I, we all do.
[02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:11.790]  I whittled it down, man.
[02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:15.070]  I'm down to like two basic like keeper strains.
[02:44:15.070 --> 02:44:17.790]  I got the Westport grape juice and I got the Kool-Aid man,
[02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:20.350]  like those I will never get tired of.
[02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:22.910]  And they're unlike I saw a photo of that, man.
[02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:24.430]  That other things, beautiful.
[02:44:25.310 --> 02:44:26.110]  Thank you, man.
[02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:31.310]  Yeah, that was the most trichome on a plant I've ever had.
[02:44:32.510 --> 02:44:36.030]  And like the, actually, that's what I've been smoking this whole time.
[02:44:36.030 --> 02:44:38.270]  The effects and the taste back it up, too.
[02:44:38.270 --> 02:44:43.150]  Like it could be ugly and I would still love it, but it's freaking sexy and I love it.
[02:44:43.150 --> 02:44:44.750]  So that's even better.
[02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:46.270]  But that's why it's one of the keepers.
[02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:50.430]  But yeah, how do you guys or how often do you reset?
[02:44:50.430 --> 02:44:56.030]  Because I usually, I used to say three runs before I'm like bump it or dump it.
[02:44:56.030 --> 02:44:58.590]  Now I'm kind of like two runs.
[02:44:59.150 --> 02:45:01.550]  One, I'm trying to call things faster.
[02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:05.870]  Just I'm not giving like things the chance that I would have before.
[02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:10.670]  I'm a little bit more ruthless, but I do still want two runs on something
[02:45:11.310 --> 02:45:13.070]  just to see if it changed.
[02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:18.670]  But that also gives me enough time because I'm perpetual to properly cure a flower
[02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:21.230]  before I have to make the decision to take a clone or not.
[02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:26.590]  So how do you guys go through that process of finding new strains?
[02:45:26.590 --> 02:45:29.790]  And how long do you keep it around before you bump it or dump it?
[02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:42.270]  So I'm very much like you there, but also trying to find the time and space to get into new stuff.
[02:45:42.270 --> 02:45:49.710]  Like I've been keeping some stuff for not quite as long as John, but a little over a year now
[02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:51.870]  on something or close to it anyway.
[02:45:52.910 --> 02:46:00.190]  And it's time for me to decide what out of that group is really special.
[02:46:01.230 --> 02:46:09.070]  So I can move into a lot new here because after the next, like you said, two or three runs is
[02:46:09.070 --> 02:46:13.470]  really like it had been three, but now it's looking like it's got to be two.
[02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:15.550]  And that's half a year too.
[02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:18.110]  Three runs is six months.
[02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:21.150]  If you're perpetual and you're on time with a 60 day flowering plant.
[02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:25.230]  So sorry to cut you off there, but we're saying like two or three people are like two or three.
[02:46:25.230 --> 02:46:29.550]  Like, dude, that's half a year, half a year to decide whether like I want to keep it or not.
[02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:31.230]  Right.
[02:46:31.230 --> 02:46:34.830]  You really get, well, I mean, when you have a few things, you have to really get a good
[02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:37.390]  evaluation of each one and rotating.
[02:46:37.390 --> 02:46:38.830]  You want to make it right.
[02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:43.470]  Like you said, when you get a second, like it might not come out awesome on the first run,
[02:46:43.470 --> 02:46:44.750]  you got to give it another run.
[02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:48.750]  Maybe if it's really good, you give it a third.
[02:46:48.750 --> 02:46:54.430]  But like in that time, it's like, well, I'm hanging on to this library and the library is
[02:46:54.430 --> 02:47:00.430]  growing, but the seed library is growing faster.
[02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:07.230]  So that's all the, uh, there's been so many wonderful things to pop.
[02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:11.230]  It's just like, I have my tent that I'm in now.
[02:47:11.230 --> 02:47:14.910]  That is my five by 10 is my like main medicine tent.
[02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:22.350]  Um, and then I have a five by five, so I have my medical and my rec plants.
[02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:26.830]  And then I can veg as well.
[02:47:27.470 --> 02:47:29.710]  So I can have a six and three.
[02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:31.870]  So I have six and one and three.
[02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:37.630]  Well, your plants outside were so big that rippers were able to just come by and cut
[02:47:37.630 --> 02:47:38.750]  off colas of that mat.
[02:47:39.470 --> 02:47:40.190]  Well, yeah.
[02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:42.830]  So over the fence, over the second, I'm at a club.
[02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:44.590]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:50.190]  I have to kind of accordingly prepare that like my runs are preparing for my outside stuff.
[02:47:50.190 --> 02:47:50.430]  Right.
[02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:58.110]  So I have to like make sure stuff's going to finish in the spring if I'm flowering so that
[02:47:58.110 --> 02:48:01.950]  I can use some space as veg space for what's going to be going outside.
[02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:07.870]  I have some cloush greenhouses, like small, small ones that go over some raised beds that
[02:48:07.870 --> 02:48:10.510]  I've been putting my recycled soil in and reinventing.
[02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:17.550]  So I have raised beds and some pots that are recycled.
[02:48:17.550 --> 02:48:25.070]  So like I also have a five by five greenhouse that I'm going to be upgrading from and putting
[02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:28.270]  all my beds under a 10 by 20 greenhouse.
[02:48:28.270 --> 02:48:33.710]  So that'll be like the security has been upgraded significantly.
[02:48:35.470 --> 02:48:35.790]  Yeah.
[02:48:36.750 --> 02:48:37.390]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.390 --> 02:48:38.190]  Rippers suck.
[02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:43.390]  But that's again, everything is different about growing outside.
[02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:45.790]  Part of learning, right?
[02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:46.990]  Yeah.
[02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:47.310]  Yeah.
[02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:48.270]  Really.
[02:48:49.230 --> 02:48:49.950]  Part of learning.
[02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:52.430]  Part of learning.
[02:48:52.430 --> 02:48:57.310]  You should see the marvelous GG4 lime one that Brandon Russ that he grew outdoors.
[02:48:57.390 --> 02:49:01.950]  It was really interesting to see the different expression of it being grown outdoors, you know?
[02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:03.550]  That was awesome.
[02:49:06.350 --> 02:49:06.590]  Yeah.
[02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:09.470]  Got it in the jar.
[02:49:09.470 --> 02:49:09.950]  Nice.
[02:49:12.190 --> 02:49:16.990]  Got to have those turf close by because once you crack that jar, it hits you in the face and
[02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:19.470]  it's super limey gas all day.
[02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:21.710]  But yeah, I'm excited.
[02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:22.830]  That's actually on the lineup.
[02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:26.590]  You asked a little while ago what's coming up next on the next.
[02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:28.750]  So let me see.
[02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:32.670]  I have the GMO root beer that's coming out.
[02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:33.150]  Some candy.
[02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:34.510]  I'm for one second.
[02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:42.270]  Some hot rod, the knockout runs, the Malawi dog and the island fritter.
[02:49:42.270 --> 02:49:43.870]  So that'll be done in a month.
[02:49:43.870 --> 02:49:48.830]  Then going into flower after that will be, let me see.
[02:49:49.790 --> 02:50:02.750]  Two of the sour diesel SFBOGs, a sour diesel back cross, another Natty Bumpo from Gone to Rubble Dan,
[02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:07.550]  and another GMO root beer.
[02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:21.790]  And then following that, once that's done, I will have a dozy dough, the archive cut.
[02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.590]  Let me see.
[02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:28.910]  There's so much shit to remember sometimes, Chad.
[02:50:31.150 --> 02:50:32.110]  It is, man.
[02:50:33.230 --> 02:50:34.590]  Got to be organizing.
[02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:36.350]  I got my calendar over here.
[02:50:36.430 --> 02:50:38.670]  It's like rotations, rotations.
[02:50:39.710 --> 02:50:44.510]  Hey, this is some of your dozy dough that you grew outdoors, right?
[02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:45.790]  Dozy dough from outdoors.
[02:50:46.350 --> 02:50:47.390]  Flower rosin.
[02:50:47.390 --> 02:50:50.030]  Yeah, the color on that flower rosin is great.
[02:50:50.030 --> 02:50:53.470]  The thing about dozy is surefire asher, right?
[02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:58.510]  I think the yield I got on that was unreal.
[02:50:58.510 --> 02:51:02.510]  Usually I get like a 25 or higher percent yield.
[02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:09.470]  That was a 30, 33% yield on that outdoor sun-grown flower rosin.
[02:51:09.470 --> 02:51:10.270]  I was like, what?
[02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:12.430]  Yeah, so let me see.
[02:51:12.430 --> 02:51:14.590]  Oh, the dough is coming up.
[02:51:14.590 --> 02:51:16.590]  The MAC is coming up.
[02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:20.830]  The yuzu from the lime is going to be flowering again because that thing was phenomenal.
[02:51:22.350 --> 02:51:22.990]  Let me see.
[02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:24.270]  What else do we got going?
[02:51:24.270 --> 02:51:26.830]  The so dough will be coming up from Josh.
[02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:31.790]  And the so dough project was an exclusive drop from the regenerative conferences that
[02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:36.510]  Dutch Blooms put on in Humboldt, Michigan and Maine.
[02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:41.230]  And the pack you could only get with the ticket purchase, but he hooked it up with like,
[02:51:41.230 --> 02:51:42.990]  I think 30 seeds in each pack.
[02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:49.310]  And the idea behind it was that everybody in the regenerative conference is going to
[02:51:49.310 --> 02:51:54.510]  be getting into these seeds and looking for something that they think is special, right?
[02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:59.150]  And we're sharing this information and genetic as a community together, which is like pushing
[02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.950]  the plant forward.
[02:51:59.950 --> 02:52:00.990]  And that's what's important.
[02:52:00.990 --> 02:52:05.790]  Shout out to Josh Rutherford, Dutch Blooms for putting this together with all the speakers
[02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:08.990]  and all the attendees everywhere, really putting their work in.
[02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:15.870]  So the so dough is Mean Gene's root beer was that he doesn't let out to anybody.
[02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:24.190]  Mean Gene's root beer hit with the pollen from the Chemdog special reserve fuel mail
[02:52:24.190 --> 02:52:25.470]  from Kevin Dodry.
[02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:33.390]  And I think those are two that Josh sent out for the so dough project.
[02:52:33.390 --> 02:52:37.390]  So super excited for those root beer Chemdog fuel terms.
[02:52:38.270 --> 02:52:44.030]  And I think that Chemdog special reserve is what was in the black lime reserve.
[02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.750]  Black lime.
[02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:49.310]  Is that maybe I'm wrong there, but I think that's what's in there.
[02:52:49.310 --> 02:52:49.950]  I think you're correct.
[02:52:51.390 --> 02:52:51.950]  Okay, cool.
[02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:53.330]  Cool.
[02:52:53.390 --> 02:52:57.150]  So that's going to be some super, super good stuff.
[02:52:57.150 --> 02:53:02.510]  I think Sticky Ricky, shout out to him for a third time is already on the F3 version
[02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:04.350]  that he did this season on the farm.
[02:53:04.350 --> 02:53:06.510]  And I'm excited to flower mine.
[02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:10.110]  And what did he select for?
[02:53:12.910 --> 02:53:13.950]  What did he find?
[02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:15.230]  Like, what was he selecting for?
[02:53:15.230 --> 02:53:19.230]  He's like, oh, I'm going to keep, you know, going F3, F4, F5.
[02:53:19.230 --> 02:53:22.910]  Is he just crossing the cross or was there a particular intention?
[02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:25.710]  He's like, oh, this one's got more chem on it.
[02:53:26.910 --> 02:53:31.950]  I think I could be wrong and I'm going to be talking to him soon and doing some sampling
[02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:38.670]  with John and Ricky and another farmer or two on some flavors because he has some really
[02:53:38.670 --> 02:53:43.870]  interesting projects that he wants to discuss moving forward, some awesome genetics.
[02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:48.990]  But I think, and I could be wrong, like I said, I think he did an open pollination.
[02:53:48.990 --> 02:53:49.490]  Okay.
[02:53:51.550 --> 02:53:52.050]  Yeah.
[02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:58.670]  And I think his reasoning behind that was he got a pack of the Gosney from Kevin Jodry
[02:53:58.670 --> 02:54:03.710]  as well and some Maroof Red preservation project.
[02:54:04.350 --> 02:54:13.070]  Both of those pure Afghani lines are from the Durand line project in 2020.
[02:54:14.190 --> 02:54:16.990]  The Afghan heirloom preservation project.
[02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:24.110]  So I believe while he was doing open preservations and outcrosses of those lines, he was, so
[02:54:24.110 --> 02:54:26.190]  he's done a lot of work this season, I'm saying.
[02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:32.110]  But I think he was doing the open pollination on the Soto because he was also doing some
[02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:37.710]  preservation work elsewhere and the intention of the Soto was community and preservation
[02:54:37.710 --> 02:54:38.430]  and finding stuff.
[02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:46.190]  So I don't think he necessarily selected other than what he personally thought was
[02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:48.670]  something special.
[02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:51.070]  And then the open pollination of the males.
[02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:55.070]  To open it up and let everybody look at it.
[02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:58.110]  I recently, yeah, I recently did that with.
[02:54:58.110 --> 02:55:00.430]  Yeah, we do a lot of mandling of these gene pools, right?
[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:06.430]  Like we do a lot of F2s and F3s and F4s and we do select these traits that we know and
[02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:08.510]  we love and we're trying to keep around.
[02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:12.510]  But as we know the gene pools, like we also want to open some back up too.
[02:55:12.510 --> 02:55:18.750]  Yeah, like there's other things there that are viable and valuable and you know, it might
[02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:23.390]  not be what we want this time around, but we got to leave it there for dipping back
[02:55:23.390 --> 02:55:25.950]  into or letting somebody else carry that torch, you know?
[02:55:27.390 --> 02:55:27.950]  Yeah.
[02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:30.350]  And we need to, that's the whole thing.
[02:55:30.350 --> 02:55:35.550]  I have a pack of the Ghazni and when Kevin handed it out and he only had a few, but he
[02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:38.670]  only had a few because he wanted people to share.
[02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:43.230]  So now I feel like I'm not doing my duty to not like, but we don't want to just grow
[02:55:43.230 --> 02:55:44.750]  it out and find the best pheno.
[02:55:45.550 --> 02:55:50.270]  I almost feel like it's our duty to, because I, you know, I told him and another friend
[02:55:50.270 --> 02:55:54.110]  of ours that, you know, we need to pop this, like we need to do this together or we need
[02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:57.950]  to at least do some open pollination and create the more seeds.
[02:55:57.950 --> 02:56:03.710]  But I think it was really Kevin's intention on the same lines of Dutch's that he wanted
[02:56:03.870 --> 02:56:10.590]  he wanted this to be shared, that this now is open pollinated or at the very least you
[02:56:10.590 --> 02:56:17.950]  keep that best keeper and then, you know, but yeah, this preservation work is very important.
[02:56:17.950 --> 02:56:20.350]  I never used to understand that, you know what I mean?
[02:56:20.350 --> 02:56:25.390]  That, you know, so these breeders are putting in work to make these things work in our different
[02:56:25.390 --> 02:56:26.670]  geographic locations.
[02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:32.830]  And that's, if we can't get our medicine to grow in the areas, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:34.910]  You know what strain it is.
[02:56:36.350 --> 02:56:39.790]  So it's great to meld these things together.
[02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:41.550]  Like Cape Medici gave me this thing.
[02:56:41.550 --> 02:56:42.030]  What was that?
[02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:48.910]  The bubble gum cussed to the Friesland or the MOB or whatever, man, it made it was like
[02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:50.830]  yellow from a fresh flower.
[02:56:50.830 --> 02:56:52.830]  I saw him at the bonfire.
[02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:57.310]  Yeah, the bubble gum, MOB, crossed to the Royal Cush 7.
[02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:59.410]  That's a.
[02:57:01.390 --> 02:57:02.670]  You know, and that's another thing.
[02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:03.230]  Special one.
[02:57:04.110 --> 02:57:09.710]  I was at the, you know, I actually told Patrick that a friend of ours, and I hope you don't
[02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:12.030]  mind, Miranda Family Farms, shout out to him.
[02:57:12.030 --> 02:57:13.230]  Yeah, he had Lyme disease.
[02:57:13.870 --> 02:57:20.350]  And, you know, so I know about Nick Rizdan, even though I haven't met the man and he's
[02:57:20.350 --> 02:57:22.750]  amazing, you know, and what he's gone through.
[02:57:22.750 --> 02:57:26.910]  But that Royal 7 can really help us out here for what it's known to do.
[02:57:26.910 --> 02:57:32.910]  So I even said that to, and then Mikey, shout out to Nature Summit.
[02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:33.950]  The knee hands out there.
[02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:38.510]  You know, he had Lyme disease, too.
[02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:43.870]  So I actually, when I went to get those gosney seeds from Kevin, I was up there actually
[02:57:43.870 --> 02:57:49.710]  trying to tell Kevin, send these guys the Royal 7, because even at Wendy, Wendy Kronberg
[02:57:49.710 --> 02:57:54.110]  was like, that's the one at the organic cultivators is like, it's the Royal 7 that's so good.
[02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:56.430]  And I was like, because I couldn't think of which one it was.
[02:57:56.430 --> 02:57:57.150]  I knew it was.
[02:57:57.150 --> 02:58:02.270]  And I was just like, so anyway, I see a potential for that helping us here on the East Coast,
[02:58:02.270 --> 02:58:02.510]  too.
[02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:06.670]  If we can get that to acclimate here, I don't know really much about it.
[02:58:09.070 --> 02:58:13.230]  Well, that's the one that was like magic for Nick, I believe.
[02:58:13.230 --> 02:58:17.630]  And that was in Kentucky, or now he's in Michigan, I believe.
[02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:21.790]  So that's kind of more northern climate, at least.
[02:58:21.790 --> 02:58:22.030]  Yeah.
[02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:23.630]  Well, I know the vicket.
[02:58:23.630 --> 02:58:24.830]  He's killing it with that vicket.
[02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:25.550]  That's amazing.
[02:58:26.270 --> 02:58:28.270]  I want some of that, Rosin.
[02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:30.350]  Numbers on that were unreal.
[02:58:30.910 --> 02:58:36.190]  38% cannabinoids and like 4% turps almost, or maybe even more than that.
[02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:43.230]  Oh, thank you again, Chad, for doing that, the interview with the cornbread, you know.
[02:58:44.830 --> 02:58:48.910]  Yeah, he's hopefully he just came out with another book.
[02:58:48.910 --> 02:58:50.590]  So hopefully I'll get him back on.
[02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:53.550]  But yeah, Mr. Bickett, Joe Keith Bickett.
[02:58:56.110 --> 02:58:57.230]  Yeah, wow.
[02:58:57.230 --> 02:58:58.670]  What a guy, what a story.
[02:58:58.750 --> 02:59:00.350]  But that was Nick.
[02:59:00.350 --> 02:59:01.470]  No, that was when Nick came on.
[02:59:01.470 --> 02:59:04.670]  But that Royal Seven, if it can heal people, we need to grow it.
[02:59:04.670 --> 02:59:08.430]  And I just want to have it in the garden so I could give it away, honestly, or give it
[02:59:08.430 --> 02:59:09.070]  to people I know.
[02:59:09.070 --> 02:59:13.070]  Because it's like, I keep running into all these people, and it's like, oh, you have
[02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:14.430]  Lyme disease, you have Lyme disease.
[02:59:14.430 --> 02:59:17.790]  And it's proven.
[02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:27.230]  I tripped out listening, I think it was FCP, and Nick was talking, and he was on with Ethan
[02:59:27.310 --> 02:59:27.870]  Rousseau.
[02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:32.430]  And it was like, it was so awesome to hear him tell him like, look, doctor, this is
[02:59:32.430 --> 02:59:33.550]  what's helping me.
[02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:36.670]  This is my babesia and all these things that he was going through.
[02:59:36.670 --> 02:59:40.350]  And that guy has been tortured and tormented by all these things.
[02:59:40.350 --> 02:59:42.590]  Thank God I see him doing good with a child.
[02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:44.350]  I'm so fucking happy for him.
[02:59:44.350 --> 02:59:47.790]  I don't even know the gentleman, but I just know the person that he is.
[02:59:47.790 --> 02:59:50.510]  And I've been following his story.
[02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:55.790]  So it's like, man, this here is like, it's proven.
[02:59:55.790 --> 02:59:57.790]  He got off all those medications.
[02:59:57.790 --> 03:00:01.230]  I mean, I guess he still has to do really heavy RSOs.
[03:00:01.230 --> 03:00:03.390]  But like, this is the medicine.
[03:00:03.390 --> 03:00:04.750]  This is what we need to embrace.
[03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:12.110]  So like, you know, mad respect and much health, strength, and prosperity to him and his family.
[03:00:12.910 --> 03:00:15.390]  But you know, and it's because of this plant.
[03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:16.990]  Yes.
[03:00:16.990 --> 03:00:18.110]  And that's cool to see.
[03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:24.110]  And that, you know, there can be a connection to amongst other people that this plant has
[03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:24.990]  really been helping.
[03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:28.270]  So those are the ones that we do got to get for free.
[03:00:28.270 --> 03:00:29.710]  We do got to get those out.
[03:00:29.710 --> 03:00:31.070]  Johnny Appleseed that shit.
[03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.630]  Spread it.
[03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:32.350]  Don't hoard it.
[03:00:33.390 --> 03:00:35.790]  And that's what Kevin was doing.
[03:00:35.790 --> 03:00:36.910]  Was he was spreading it?
[03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:39.070]  He heard of this guy who could use it.
[03:00:39.070 --> 03:00:40.430]  He said, let me give it to you.
[03:00:40.990 --> 03:00:44.430]  I was asking for him to give it directly to the other people.
[03:00:44.430 --> 03:00:44.990]  You know what I mean?
[03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:48.430]  I was like, not asking for it.
[03:00:48.430 --> 03:00:49.870]  I just, I know it can help.
[03:00:50.510 --> 03:00:52.270]  Just putting that thought in your head.
[03:00:53.710 --> 03:00:54.350]  Yeah.
[03:00:54.350 --> 03:00:58.510]  But yeah, and then he gave me the Gosney and it's like, oh, now, you know, that's.
[03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:01.390]  Yes, blessings, blessings.
[03:01:01.390 --> 03:01:04.430]  And I was like, I'm going to share these with Alex and Joe and we'll definitely have to
[03:01:05.310 --> 03:01:07.870]  do something with these somehow all together.
[03:01:07.870 --> 03:01:10.110]  Because yeah.
[03:01:10.110 --> 03:01:10.910]  Yeah.
[03:01:10.910 --> 03:01:11.870]  It's coming.
[03:01:11.870 --> 03:01:14.190]  We'll be popping plenty of good gear here.
[03:01:16.110 --> 03:01:17.870]  That's why I almost felt like I failed.
[03:01:17.870 --> 03:01:22.430]  I failed Kevin when we heard from Sticky Richie and he's like, I open pollinated all this
[03:01:22.430 --> 03:01:23.070]  and this and that.
[03:01:23.070 --> 03:01:25.790]  And I'm just like, oh, thank you.
[03:01:27.550 --> 03:01:30.510]  So it's going to be the work that he's gotten into.
[03:01:30.510 --> 03:01:33.790]  Hopefully in the next couple of weeks here, we'll be making a little visit out to him
[03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:34.350]  there.
[03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:38.590]  I got to get ahold of him here this weekend and we'll see if we could pick a date here
[03:01:38.590 --> 03:01:39.950]  for a little farm visit soon.
[03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:45.710]  And we'll, I'll pack up my jars, you pack up yours and we'll see what it all ricks up
[03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:46.030]  to.
[03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:49.630]  And, you know, he's got some flavors he wants to sample us out on.
[03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:55.550]  And the seed list he sent was admirable to say the least.
[03:01:57.150 --> 03:01:57.390]  Yes.
[03:01:59.390 --> 03:02:03.950]  Guys, you guys are walking into a candy store.
[03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:04.670]  Sounds like.
[03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:05.870]  Let me see if I can.
[03:02:05.870 --> 03:02:08.350]  Let me see if I can.
[03:02:08.350 --> 03:02:10.030]  I hope he doesn't mind us talking about it.
[03:02:10.030 --> 03:02:15.630]  We really, he's, you know, he's inspiring us even deeper to do like, I don't know.
[03:02:15.630 --> 03:02:20.110]  I think he's like, I live on a small 40 acre farm or something.
[03:02:22.590 --> 03:02:23.150]  Okay.
[03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:24.510]  I'm here in the bricks.
[03:02:24.510 --> 03:02:26.030]  Like I'm here in the suburbs.
[03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:30.830]  I got four feet between my house and the neighbors.
[03:02:32.190 --> 03:02:32.430]  Yeah.
[03:02:33.150 --> 03:02:34.110]  40 acres.
[03:02:34.110 --> 03:02:36.030]  It's actually 10, but yeah, you're close.
[03:02:36.990 --> 03:02:42.110]  So, yeah, man, much respect to all these people that, you know, are doing it, that are doing
[03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.670]  this work.
[03:02:43.950 --> 03:02:53.550]  I just want to, you know, give props and take part in, you know, advance this plant in any
[03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:55.070]  small part in any way I can.
[03:02:55.710 --> 03:02:59.310]  You know, that's kind of like, I realized this is kind of my mission in life now.
[03:02:59.310 --> 03:03:03.470]  I don't know, you know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it.
[03:03:04.430 --> 03:03:12.430]  You know, it's almost like when we get talking, it's very religious almost, but like, that's
[03:03:12.430 --> 03:03:17.150]  kind of how we, yeah, man, all these people.
[03:03:18.910 --> 03:03:19.390]  Together.
[03:03:20.270 --> 03:03:27.150]  And it is, it is to a level, it can get religious sometimes, not necessarily religious all the
[03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:32.830]  way, but I mean, it is, it's a huge part of our lives and it's like, we eat, food is our
[03:03:32.830 --> 03:03:33.310]  medicine.
[03:03:33.310 --> 03:03:35.630]  We keep saying this meant, and this is our medicine.
[03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:40.910]  And it's like, it's part of, part of who we are and plants a huge part of what we do.
[03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:46.110]  And not everybody, not everybody is a steward of the plant, but the people who aren't do
[03:03:46.110 --> 03:03:49.070]  need the ones who are, and we're all playing a role.
[03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.950]  It's totally true.
[03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:55.630]  There's, you know, there's some people out there and I've asked them like, so what do
[03:03:55.630 --> 03:03:56.190]  you listen to?
[03:03:56.190 --> 03:03:58.670]  And they've actually responded with, I don't like music.
[03:03:59.230 --> 03:04:01.790]  My brain can not wrap my head around that.
[03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:06.510]  I don't know whether whatever it is, any kind of rhythmic beat, I don't know how you
[03:04:06.510 --> 03:04:09.950]  could not like music, but I've tried.
[03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:12.190]  I bring that up because it goes back to plants.
[03:04:12.190 --> 03:04:15.390]  Like I can't imagine my life without gardening now.
[03:04:15.390 --> 03:04:18.110]  Like it just, it just wouldn't seem right.
[03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:20.030]  It's like, how do people who not garden?
[03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:22.030]  Like, what do they do with their time?
[03:04:22.030 --> 03:04:24.350]  Why are, why don't they garden?
[03:04:24.350 --> 03:04:29.070]  It's when it's, you know, it is like you said, Jeff, it's a lifestyle.
[03:04:30.030 --> 03:04:31.310]  It becomes part of you.
[03:04:31.310 --> 03:04:35.710]  And especially with these plants, you know, they're not that fussy, but you don't get
[03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:37.950]  a day off, you know?
[03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:43.310]  So there's always something that you constantly got to be doing, but it's enjoyable.
[03:04:43.310 --> 03:04:45.950]  I just made that sound like, oh, it's such a trick.
[03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:47.710]  No, it's an enjoyable thing.
[03:04:47.710 --> 03:04:53.390]  I'm assuming it's like, like your gardening became because of this connection with the
[03:04:53.390 --> 03:04:53.870]  plant.
[03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:58.030]  Then you started to garden because this plant made you aware of that.
[03:04:58.030 --> 03:05:03.870]  And it's, and we hear this story with all of us in, you know, these passionate people
[03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:04.750]  about this plant.
[03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:09.230]  That's kind of, I mean, some of us, maybe they grew up on farms and begin with or whatever,
[03:05:09.230 --> 03:05:12.910]  but at some point in our lives, our ancestors were farmers, right?
[03:05:12.910 --> 03:05:16.510]  So maybe it's an epigenetic thing that we need to get back to.
[03:05:16.510 --> 03:05:20.910]  And I'm just starting to feel like, man, that's my calling now, getting called back to the
[03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:22.110]  earth, growing my own stuff.
[03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:26.910]  And, and I really have to attribute it to this plant, this plant, making me aware of
[03:05:26.910 --> 03:05:29.950]  it and feeling like, oh, why didn't they teach us about all this stuff?
[03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:30.910]  This is fascinating.
[03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:37.470]  You know, and oh, actually it's, it's what we need to be healthy.
[03:05:37.470 --> 03:05:41.630]  Like all these things and these practices that like, and that's what got, that's why
[03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:43.070]  I have such a big garden.
[03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:47.390]  I would like, I mean, they're all sip containers, but with the amount of space that I have,
[03:05:47.390 --> 03:05:51.390]  I have a pretty decent size, you know, and it's all because of this plant.
[03:05:51.390 --> 03:05:52.510]  It's all because of this plant.
[03:05:53.390 --> 03:05:57.870]  Beautiful mints, multiple varieties.
[03:05:59.390 --> 03:06:02.430]  Orange mint, chocolate mint, banana mints.
[03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:05.470]  So it does smell like bananas.
[03:06:05.470 --> 03:06:06.190]  Like what's that?
[03:06:06.190 --> 03:06:06.670]  Esters?
[03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:07.390]  No, that's a...
[03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:09.070]  Thiols?
[03:06:09.070 --> 03:06:09.790]  Thiols?
[03:06:09.790 --> 03:06:10.830]  Is it banana?
[03:06:11.550 --> 03:06:14.110]  I need to, I need to brush up on that.
[03:06:16.110 --> 03:06:18.670]  I went for the one word that nobody said yet.
[03:06:18.670 --> 03:06:20.110]  That's where I came from there.
[03:06:23.310 --> 03:06:23.870]  Thiols!
[03:06:24.350 --> 03:06:24.510]  No.
[03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:29.390]  Yeah, it really did lead me to other things.
[03:06:29.390 --> 03:06:34.910]  And you know, I, over the summer I tore up where my ramps were because I was adding on
[03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:38.830]  to the shed and I used that wood because I didn't want to go to the hardware store.
[03:06:38.830 --> 03:06:43.550]  And now I've got this space where the deck was and I got to finish tearing up part of
[03:06:43.550 --> 03:06:44.830]  the deck that was still there.
[03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:48.910]  But it's going into full on veggie garden space next year.
[03:06:49.550 --> 03:07:00.110]  I'm leaving my raised beds that I have and I'm going for is probably 12, 12 by 10 space,
[03:07:00.750 --> 03:07:05.790]  which is actually really a lot of space if you're just producing food for me and my wife
[03:07:05.790 --> 03:07:08.830]  and then, you know, like neighbors and the food bank.
[03:07:09.550 --> 03:07:12.750]  I'd love to give them some great food and I'd love to grow it.
[03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:15.150]  I'd love to garden it, but there's no way I can eat it all.
[03:07:15.150 --> 03:07:18.190]  So yeah, so I'm excited about that.
[03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:19.710]  And it is, it's all because of Canvas.
[03:07:21.070 --> 03:07:24.350]  And you're going to be building your soil fertility, man, which is awesome.
[03:07:24.350 --> 03:07:27.150]  So it's like you're helping yourself, your community and the earth.
[03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:32.430]  That's another thing I'm excited about too, because, you know, like I said, things from
[03:07:32.430 --> 03:07:34.190]  inside, they go outside.
[03:07:34.190 --> 03:07:37.870]  Outside, yeah, I do a lot of amending.
[03:07:37.870 --> 03:07:40.110]  I add things into the soil there.
[03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:45.630]  But to have such a large space, I'm actually going to like A and B it, like in my head,
[03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:46.990]  because I live right next to the woods.
[03:07:46.990 --> 03:07:49.550]  I'm like, well, I could go get some branches.
[03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:52.910]  I'm like, do I do like one row is like a hugelkultur bed?
[03:07:52.910 --> 03:08:00.430]  Do I do the next row with like more pumice or like more aeration materials?
[03:08:00.430 --> 03:08:04.510]  Like just all the things that I could do just by having multiple different rows.
[03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:07.790]  I get excited about the possibilities.
[03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:09.390]  Yeah, dude, I geek out on that too, dude.
[03:08:09.390 --> 03:08:12.590]  I'm right there with you, bro.
[03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:13.230]  I know we are.
[03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:23.790]  Yeah, it's, yeah, and it's, we have this innate need to know.
[03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:28.110]  And once you start to learn stuff and like, and then you're like, hey, you know, I mean,
[03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:30.110]  I don't know, I geek out.
[03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:36.750]  I get, I'm fascinated and I'm definitely totally all in with just growing anything now.
[03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:43.470]  It's, you know, and wanting to have the space to do it, you know, whether or not I can,
[03:08:43.470 --> 03:08:43.950]  I don't know.
[03:08:46.270 --> 03:08:49.310]  But what was that, Jeff?
[03:08:52.110 --> 03:08:53.790]  Would you say that it's growing on you?
[03:08:54.430 --> 03:08:58.030]  No, it's growing on me like hair.
[03:08:58.750 --> 03:08:59.390]  That's right.
[03:09:01.390 --> 03:09:01.630]  Boom.
[03:09:01.630 --> 03:09:01.950]  Yes.
[03:09:04.030 --> 03:09:06.910]  It's grown like a Morris the plant.
[03:09:06.910 --> 03:09:07.790]  Feed me Morris.
[03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:08.030]  No.
[03:09:09.230 --> 03:09:10.190]  Feed me Seymour.
[03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.870]  Seymour, that's it.
[03:09:11.870 --> 03:09:13.150]  Seymour, yes.
[03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:15.390]  Feed me Seymour.
[03:09:15.630 --> 03:09:18.590]  And if you don't know that reference, you're too young to watch the show.
[03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:19.390]  Yeah, right.
[03:09:19.390 --> 03:09:19.630]  Yes.
[03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:22.510]  Well, cool guys.
[03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:24.990]  It's been a little over three hours.
[03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:29.470]  I know we could have a lot more things to talk about.
[03:09:29.470 --> 03:09:30.990]  Why don't we do this another time?
[03:09:34.220 --> 03:09:36.460]  Unless we've got a hot topic.
[03:09:36.460 --> 03:09:40.140]  I was listening to seed collectors volume, maybe.
[03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:45.420]  Yes, seed collectors, seed collectors volumes coming up.
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:51.820]  I think Chef's saying we should, maybe we could be on,
[03:09:51.820 --> 03:09:53.580]  talk about what's in our little boxes.
[03:09:55.340 --> 03:09:57.820]  Okay, we found more seed collectors.
[03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:00.860]  I'm always game for that.
[03:10:01.580 --> 03:10:03.420]  Hey, you want to end with that?
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:09.740]  We might drum up another seed collector to join us too on the conversation.
[03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:11.100]  Let's do it.
[03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:12.620]  I'm writing it down right now.
[03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:14.300]  Awesome, man.
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:18.380]  I'll talk to our fellow farmers out here who are regeneratively minded
[03:10:18.380 --> 03:10:21.420]  and see what we can get planned up.
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:22.540]  That would be a fun time.
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:24.780]  Hell yeah.
[03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:26.380]  Always down to talk about that.
[03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:27.820]  What were you going to say, John?
[03:10:27.820 --> 03:10:35.420]  We ran into, I don't know if you might know him, but should we tell them who we ran into
[03:10:35.420 --> 03:10:38.940]  at the science fair?
[03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:41.900]  At the cannabis science fair?
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:43.020]  Who was it?
[03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:44.860]  Friend of Dutch.
[03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:46.220]  Many people.
[03:10:47.100 --> 03:10:47.900]  Friends of Dutch.
[03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:48.940]  Oh, that's right.
[03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:50.220]  Let me see.
[03:10:50.780 --> 03:10:53.020]  Yeah, hanging roots, right, Matt?
[03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:53.420]  Yeah.
[03:10:53.420 --> 03:10:55.180]  He's at the Ego Clash right now.
[03:10:57.580 --> 03:10:59.500]  Or the Emerald Cup, I can't remember, man.
[03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:02.220]  It was really cool to meet him and session with him.
[03:11:02.220 --> 03:11:04.300]  Coast to coast.
[03:11:04.300 --> 03:11:05.740]  Yeah, yeah, he happened to be there.
[03:11:05.740 --> 03:11:07.180]  He's like, all my buddies are.
[03:11:07.980 --> 03:11:09.820]  Right, right.
[03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:12.780]  We saw him and I was like, that dude looks familiar.
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:17.660]  And then, of course, he's in the video of the Melting the Heads with Dutch.
[03:11:18.620 --> 03:11:20.780]  He was one of the sponsors.
[03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:24.620]  And I was like, so we got to hang out with him.
[03:11:25.580 --> 03:11:30.940]  So it was really cool because he was in town in Boston and Shep was chilling at my house.
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:32.300]  So we got to bring him.
[03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:33.500]  And he didn't have anything on him.
[03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:36.460]  So it was like, we got to lace up our homies.
[03:11:36.460 --> 03:11:37.020]  It was great.
[03:11:37.980 --> 03:11:43.500]  We got some pictures and hung out.
[03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:45.340]  You know, he told us.
[03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:45.980]  Check this out.
[03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:54.140]  He he sponsored by donating, I think he said, 10 pounds of material to be washed at the
[03:11:54.140 --> 03:11:55.020]  Melting of the Heads.
[03:11:55.020 --> 03:11:58.380]  So it's like he's he's definitely in it, you know, for sure.
[03:11:58.380 --> 03:11:59.340]  He loves it.
[03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:00.780]  He's originally from Seattle.
[03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:03.100]  That's why I thought you might know him because he's a big fan.
[03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:08.300]  And to support what's going on with education, for sure.
[03:12:08.300 --> 03:12:10.780]  Yeah, he was the real deal, man.
[03:12:10.780 --> 03:12:12.140]  So it was cool to hang out.
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:20.220]  And much love and respect and health and strength and prosperity.
[03:12:22.060 --> 03:12:23.260]  That's so freaking cool.
[03:12:23.260 --> 03:12:27.500]  It's the community that we build, the community that has built.
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:29.900]  We just we just facilitate it here.
[03:12:29.900 --> 03:12:30.780]  We facilitate.
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:35.260]  And it was a little awkward because we're there burning joints right on the steps of
[03:12:35.260 --> 03:12:37.340]  the Science Center and in Harvard.
[03:12:39.260 --> 03:12:40.860]  Yeah, I was right there.
[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:41.740]  People are walking by.
[03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:45.500]  We're not thinking about it now.
[03:12:46.140 --> 03:12:49.500]  This is nothing wrong with this joint.
[03:12:51.420 --> 03:12:54.380]  And here I am with my backpack with the clinking jars.
[03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:55.180]  Clink, clink, clink.
[03:12:56.300 --> 03:13:00.220]  And then I even like and I was it's like, oh, no, we can't show it to him.
[03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:02.780]  And people in here, we got to go outside when they go out to smoke.
[03:13:02.780 --> 03:13:05.660]  So there was still people smoking outside, but they mostly had pens and stuff.
[03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:06.220]  But right.
[03:13:06.940 --> 03:13:10.140]  And the chef smoked some of his stuff, some of his killer stuff.
[03:13:10.140 --> 03:13:15.740]  It was like that was the you know, your stuff is good when people when you crack the jar
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:19.900]  and it's like, oh, and then all of a sudden it's like a little.
[03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:23.820]  Yeah, pistol Pete from that scenic side.
[03:13:23.820 --> 03:13:29.740]  And he ran all the way back to his car to go get his car and came back to like hang out.
[03:13:30.860 --> 03:13:35.660]  There's an all the lab guys were looking at our jars like, oh, oh, wow.
[03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:37.260]  He was like, oh, I'll be right back.
[03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:40.220]  And he was it was pretty cool.
[03:13:40.780 --> 03:13:41.740]  It's so fun.
[03:13:41.740 --> 03:13:42.860]  That's so universal.
[03:13:42.860 --> 03:13:46.620]  Like there's nothing better than busting your jars out for people like that's a sense of
[03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:46.940]  pride.
[03:13:46.940 --> 03:13:48.300]  You're like, oh, it's this person.
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:49.900]  Yeah, here's my jar.
[03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:53.180]  That was the root beer roll.
[03:13:53.180 --> 03:13:58.700]  That was the GMO root beer crust to the OGKB 2.0 male.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:01.340]  That was bred by Berry genetic.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:02.860]  He's out of mass to shut out.
[03:14:02.860 --> 03:14:05.900]  Alcoverry genetics got a really good root beer.
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:09.100]  He was in that pack, but more root beer right there.
[03:14:09.820 --> 03:14:11.020]  No, no, the root beer roll.
[03:14:11.900 --> 03:14:12.860]  The daughter of that.
[03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:15.260]  Yeah, it's loud.
[03:14:15.260 --> 03:14:15.660]  It's loud.
[03:14:16.460 --> 03:14:18.220]  Yeah, GMO root beer is the mom.
[03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:21.020]  Yeah, this one smells beautiful.
[03:14:21.740 --> 03:14:23.900]  More OG than that one does.
[03:14:23.980 --> 03:14:25.660]  That one's more GMO.
[03:14:25.660 --> 03:14:25.900]  Chem.
[03:14:25.900 --> 03:14:29.900]  He root beer terps going on.
[03:14:29.900 --> 03:14:31.500]  This one leaned a little bit more.
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:34.460]  Pressed out beautiful.
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:35.500]  I think I have some batters.
[03:14:37.020 --> 03:14:38.540]  Yeah, batters out of batter.
[03:14:39.660 --> 03:14:40.620]  Firm coin.
[03:14:40.620 --> 03:14:40.860]  Yeah.
[03:14:41.980 --> 03:14:42.540]  Yeah, man.
[03:14:42.540 --> 03:14:46.460]  Yeah, we didn't even we didn't even get into technique on the flower rods.
[03:14:46.460 --> 03:14:48.460]  And we didn't even touch any of that stuff.
[03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:51.420]  We could probably do a whole episode on on extraction.
[03:14:52.140 --> 03:14:55.500]  I would I would I would love to do something like that because I'm
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:57.820]  I'm a very novice with that stuff.
[03:14:57.820 --> 03:14:58.780]  I've been a flower guy.
[03:15:02.940 --> 03:15:06.300]  Yeah, it's all out there, you know, but it's best practices.
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:08.460]  Yeah, it's out there.
[03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:11.500]  And, you know, I've kind of talked through this channel and thanks to Peter.
[03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:17.580]  You know, I've got to talk to some pretty cool people that, you know, make excellent products.
[03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:21.740]  Not that I would know because I not near there, but, you know.
[03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:27.020]  Yeah, I've got to talk to some pretty fun people, but I'm always interested in learning it because
[03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:30.540]  everybody's got their, you know, slightly different ways of doing it.
[03:15:30.540 --> 03:15:34.700]  And it still needs to sink into my head because I haven't put it into practice myself.
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:37.900]  So that's when you really, really start to learn things.
[03:15:37.900 --> 03:15:42.620]  It's like, you know, you get a picture of it and then you get to learn it.
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:45.740]  And then the best way to master it is when you're teaching somebody.
[03:15:46.460 --> 03:15:50.220]  So those are kind of like the three stages that I see with everything.
[03:15:50.220 --> 03:15:54.300]  And when it comes to the concentrates and all that stuff,
[03:15:54.300 --> 03:15:57.260]  I've just still, I've only been filling my brain with the knowledge.
[03:15:59.420 --> 03:15:59.740]  Right.
[03:15:59.740 --> 03:16:01.260]  I like my shoe hash.
[03:16:01.260 --> 03:16:04.540]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:06.140]  My Tampa ball.
[03:16:06.140 --> 03:16:07.340]  Yeah, all hash is good.
[03:16:07.340 --> 03:16:08.380]  They all have their merit.
[03:16:08.380 --> 03:16:09.580]  You know, they all have their merit.
[03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:10.620]  They're all good medicine.
[03:16:11.180 --> 03:16:13.020]  It's just a little hash by Chris.
[03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:17.340]  Off of the nail on the inside of it.
[03:16:19.180 --> 03:16:19.500]  Yeah.
[03:16:20.220 --> 03:16:20.700]  Yeah.
[03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:21.020]  Yep.
[03:16:21.820 --> 03:16:28.860]  The old school, but that's what was around when I was getting into these things and developing,
[03:16:28.860 --> 03:16:32.380]  you know, the habits or the rituals behind it.
[03:16:33.500 --> 03:16:38.460]  I say the same thing about Red Bull because I drank Mountain Dew all the time, nonstop all day.
[03:16:39.180 --> 03:16:40.940]  Didn't drink Red Bull because it wasn't there.
[03:16:40.940 --> 03:16:45.020]  But if Red Bull was there, dude, I probably would have eaten a hole in my stomach right now.
[03:16:47.420 --> 03:16:47.820]  For real.
[03:16:48.860 --> 03:16:50.700]  That happened in the aging process.
[03:16:50.700 --> 03:16:52.380]  John and I were able to attend.
[03:16:53.180 --> 03:16:57.660]  You know, you did, and we were trying to end this, but we were able to attend that
[03:16:58.220 --> 03:17:04.460]  Lost Art of the Hashishin workshop in Long Island back in June, Frenchie Cannoli's workshop.
[03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:08.220]  Shout out to Joe L-I-G, Long Island Glass.
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:08.460]  Joe.
[03:17:08.460 --> 03:17:09.260]  Long Island Glass.
[03:17:10.220 --> 03:17:11.740]  Yeah, he hosted that one there.
[03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:14.860]  And a beautiful glass blowing facility.
[03:17:14.860 --> 03:17:17.260]  But yeah, they went over that in extensive detail.
[03:17:17.260 --> 03:17:21.580]  So we were able to see it, hands-on process, how Cherry Bell does it for heritage hash,
[03:17:22.380 --> 03:17:23.580]  which was really beautiful.
[03:17:23.580 --> 03:17:27.340]  And they brought some of the white thorn rose from Huckleberry Farms out there.
[03:17:29.420 --> 03:17:30.300]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:34.940]  And that was Frenchie's like long time apprentice, like eight years,
[03:17:34.940 --> 03:17:36.540]  nine years or something like that.
[03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:42.620]  Like that's the person who's meant to carry on the technique.
[03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:44.460]  And it's her and Kimberly, right?
[03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:45.180]  We even met on Dope Race.
[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:46.620]  I'm in the rack now too.
[03:17:46.620 --> 03:17:50.860]  I guess on your show not too long ago, isn't that right?
[03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:51.980]  Yeah.
[03:17:53.020 --> 03:17:53.740]  Yep, yep.
[03:17:53.740 --> 03:17:54.380]  Had her on.
[03:17:55.420 --> 03:17:56.140]  Fascinating.
[03:17:57.180 --> 03:17:58.300]  Fascinating woman.
[03:17:59.180 --> 03:18:00.220]  Fascinating life.
[03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:05.020]  But yeah, the Cherry Bell was really the one who was,
[03:18:05.820 --> 03:18:07.260]  you know, did the apprentice.
[03:18:08.620 --> 03:18:08.780]  Right.
[03:18:08.780 --> 03:18:09.740]  Did a lot of that stuff.
[03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:13.580]  Yeah, grateful for the knowledge that she was sharing.
[03:18:13.580 --> 03:18:15.900]  That was a great class that they did.
[03:18:15.900 --> 03:18:17.100]  They came out to the East Coast.
[03:18:17.100 --> 03:18:20.860]  They did two classes in New York, one in Rochester.
[03:18:20.860 --> 03:18:23.020]  We were trying to decide which one we were going to go to.
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:26.060]  Long Island seems like that was good.
[03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:26.940]  It was a good choice.
[03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:28.540]  Nice.
[03:18:28.540 --> 03:18:32.300]  Yeah, that's, you know, another thing I wish I would have done.
[03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:33.980]  Like meeting OG Eddie Lepp.
[03:18:35.260 --> 03:18:35.980]  Didn't.
[03:18:35.980 --> 03:18:38.300]  Yeah, I didn't get a chance to meet Frenchie.
[03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:39.740]  I was in the room.
[03:18:39.740 --> 03:18:43.340]  He was at, I was in the same conventions and I saw him walk by,
[03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:48.140]  but I never really got to sit and introduce myself, unfortunately.
[03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:53.580]  But yeah, that, yeah, man, we were lucky, you know.
[03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:55.980]  Too many, too many people.
[03:18:55.980 --> 03:18:59.420]  And we just lost, I guess we should say, you know,
[03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:08.700]  RIP to Phone Homie and RIP to Goat and Monkey Seeds.
[03:19:10.300 --> 03:19:11.100]  Dan, right?
[03:19:11.660 --> 03:19:11.900]  Chef?
[03:19:12.620 --> 03:19:16.300]  Yeah, Goat and Monkey Seeds is Matt Delisle.
[03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:18.860]  Matt, sorry, Matt, Matt, sorry, not Matt.
[03:19:18.860 --> 03:19:20.860]  We were able to get some beer from him.
[03:19:21.260 --> 03:19:27.580]  And Rico, you know, those like real, real, the real people and we lost them too.
[03:19:27.580 --> 03:19:30.620]  So it's, you know, we got to keep this knowledge.
[03:19:30.620 --> 03:19:32.060]  We got to pass it on.
[03:19:32.060 --> 03:19:33.340]  We got to keep our culture.
[03:19:34.140 --> 03:19:35.980]  And you never know.
[03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:37.020]  You never know.
[03:19:37.020 --> 03:19:38.700]  So yeah.
[03:19:39.980 --> 03:19:45.900]  But you know, so we need to carry that torch.
[03:19:47.180 --> 03:19:48.780]  You guys are doing a good job, man.
[03:19:48.780 --> 03:19:50.220]  You guys are putting in the work.
[03:19:50.220 --> 03:19:52.620]  A, you know, I appreciate the conversation.
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:56.700]  It's a coming and sharing with everybody, kind of tell some of, you know, your techniques,
[03:19:56.700 --> 03:20:01.500]  some of your lessons, some of the things that you think other people can benefit from.
[03:20:01.500 --> 03:20:02.940]  But also just doing the work.
[03:20:02.940 --> 03:20:07.100]  You got to walk it before you can really educate people.
[03:20:07.100 --> 03:20:08.060]  And that takes time.
[03:20:09.180 --> 03:20:10.940]  Well, to educate people properly.
[03:20:10.940 --> 03:20:12.780]  A lot of people got a YouTube channel.
[03:20:12.780 --> 03:20:17.260]  But to really deliver a message that's going to benefit people.
[03:20:17.260 --> 03:20:22.780]  Because I think that's, you know, what all three of us at least are after, you know,
[03:20:23.900 --> 03:20:25.660]  leaving the good impression.
[03:20:25.660 --> 03:20:26.300]  Absolutely.
[03:20:26.300 --> 03:20:34.140]  It's kind of hard for me and Alex to follow up Jorge Cervantes and Mila and all the people.
[03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:41.500]  Thank you so much.
[03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:42.780]  We appreciate you.
[03:20:42.780 --> 03:20:44.300]  It's a dream to be here too.
[03:20:44.380 --> 03:20:44.880]  Thank you.
[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:52.060]  You know, and being able to, you know, offer at least our insight to what we've experienced
[03:20:52.060 --> 03:20:52.860]  with the community.
[03:20:53.740 --> 03:20:59.980]  You know, I very much appreciate the platform and I'm happy to be a guest and grateful for
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:03.340]  another time if we ever, you know, talk about seeds or anything else like that.
[03:21:03.340 --> 03:21:05.020]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[03:21:05.020 --> 03:21:06.860]  I've got that one written down.
[03:21:06.860 --> 03:21:11.340]  And yeah, I mean, I think we said at the, you know, the beginning, the very beginning of the
[03:21:11.340 --> 03:21:16.140]  show, you know, there's old people and it took a lot of time for them to learn these
[03:21:16.140 --> 03:21:17.820]  things and to pass them down.
[03:21:18.460 --> 03:21:22.620]  But if you start when you're young and you learn those things, you've saved yourself
[03:21:22.620 --> 03:21:25.740]  30, 40 years and you're going to keep pushing it forward.
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:29.420]  So you guys, you guys are pushing it forward and I appreciate that.
[03:21:29.420 --> 03:21:30.860]  So please keep doing that.
[03:21:30.860 --> 03:21:34.380]  Keep teaching me and I'll keep helping spread that word too.
[03:21:35.740 --> 03:21:36.780]  Thank you, Chad.
[03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:37.820]  Absolutely.
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:38.860]  No worries.
[03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:42.860]  And everybody in chat, we're going to wrap it up for today.
[03:21:42.860 --> 03:21:44.860]  I appreciate you guys all hanging out.
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:47.660]  A lot of you hanging out from freaking bell to bell.
[03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:49.980]  So I do appreciate that.
[03:21:49.980 --> 03:21:50.540]  And everybody's...
[03:21:50.540 --> 03:21:51.900]  We do have the gift of gab.
[03:21:51.900 --> 03:21:52.620]  So, you know...
[03:21:52.620 --> 03:21:53.120]  Yes.
[03:21:53.580 --> 03:21:55.500]  Come on in and join our conversation.
[03:21:55.500 --> 03:21:56.540]  Thanks for kicking it.
[03:21:56.540 --> 03:21:58.460]  And if I know you, that's awesome.
[03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:02.300]  And if I don't, please reach out to either of us and just say, hey, what's up?
[03:22:02.300 --> 03:22:04.540]  And we'll kick it and talk about this plant that we love.
[03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:06.700]  Yes, good, good point.
[03:22:06.700 --> 03:22:08.140]  Sorry, I did not mention that yet.
[03:22:08.140 --> 03:22:12.060]  Everybody, the Instagram for these two are down in the show notes.
[03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:17.900]  So give them a follow, reach out to them, learn something, share something.
[03:22:18.620 --> 03:22:23.100]  So yes, definitely go down into the show notes and hit their Instagrams.
[03:22:25.260 --> 03:22:27.580]  Thank you all FCP and Chad.
[03:22:27.580 --> 03:22:32.380]  We really appreciate you guys and everybody watching and anybody that we can influence.
[03:22:34.060 --> 03:22:34.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22:34.860 --> 03:22:39.100]  Well, hey, you guys hold on real quick because I know we'll keep talking behind the scenes.
[03:22:39.100 --> 03:22:44.460]  But real quick, everybody out there watching, we will catch you next time.
[03:22:44.460 --> 03:22:48.780]  Thank you for hanging out and have an excellent freaking weekend.
[03:22:48.780 --> 03:22:50.140]  So much love, guys.
[03:22:50.140 --> 03:22:51.260]  Thank you.
