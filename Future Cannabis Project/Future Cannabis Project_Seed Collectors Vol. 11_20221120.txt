[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  I got that guy. I got that guy. I got that guy. Oh, shit. I got
[00:09.680 --> 00:23.400]  it. Success. I have no idea if anybody. I already can't breathe.
[00:23.520 --> 00:28.480]  What's up, everybody? How you doing? Another secret episode.
[00:29.160 --> 00:32.680]  The we have hand model extraordinaire back with us this
[00:32.680 --> 00:39.000]  session. Very cool. Welcome back, Dave, though. We seriously
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.160]  we miss you. Tommy and Tommy, we held it down. But we definitely
[00:43.160 --> 00:43.960]  missed you there.
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.440]  Well, I appreciate the sentiment and all of the goodwill you sent
[00:48.440 --> 00:50.600]  towards me during that episode while I was watching.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  Damn it. You know what it was it was too fun. I had to tell
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.680]  everybody spontaneously combusted because seriously,
[00:58.680 --> 01:01.560]  your mailboxes just got to be like a brick oven. You can
[01:01.560 --> 01:04.080]  probably cook pizzas in it. Do you cook pizzas in your
[01:04.080 --> 01:04.760]  mailbox?
[01:05.160 --> 01:08.520]  From time to time from time to time. You know, it's a good
[01:08.520 --> 01:11.960]  finisher. It's, it's really like nice and hot enough just to
[01:11.960 --> 01:14.360]  throw it in there. Boom, you get that nice brown crust or nice
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.080]  burnt crust. Beautiful,
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.640]  beautiful, beautiful. Well, I just want to say thanks to
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.560]  everybody in chat as well for showing up this evening and
[01:22.560 --> 01:25.320]  hanging out. We're definitely going to go through some seeds.
[01:25.320 --> 01:29.320]  Dave's gonna put in some heavy duty work this episode because,
[01:29.600 --> 01:32.240]  you know, again, he was absent and we're never gonna let him
[01:32.240 --> 01:37.960]  forget that. No, we did good. And mean gene is on his way.
[01:37.960 --> 01:41.200]  He's got a few things to tidy up around the house before he pops
[01:41.200 --> 01:44.720]  on with us. But I'm super excited for that. Again, you
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.240]  know, mean gene is one of those breeders that a lot of us look
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.800]  up to. In my opinion, he's a guy who's put in the work when it
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.360]  comes to knowing his plants kind of knowing what to look for. So
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.880]  many different variables that you know, he easily, in my
[02:03.880 --> 02:08.560]  opinion, has that breeder tag attached to it. Dave, I'm
[02:08.560 --> 02:12.280]  looking at your table there. And obviously, you know, he's
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.080]  definitely put out some work.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.440]  For sure. This is a small percentage of what actually
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.960]  exists from the man like, this is a guy who is a breeders
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.320]  breeder, a prolific man as far as putting the good seeds out
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.200]  there, the fire seeds, the people, the flavor, he brings
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.720]  the turps. That's the biggest my biggest or best feeling I should
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.160]  say that I've ever gotten from anything I've grown of his is
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.480]  just how much flavor is packed into these. It's just the bomb.
[02:40.880 --> 02:44.240]  That's you know, right now one of the you know, the hot ones
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.280]  going around hot ones going around is the root beer. You
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.320]  know, he gave that out a couple years ago. When did you first
[02:52.320 --> 02:54.960]  see the root beer pop up? You'd be paying attention.
[02:56.320 --> 02:58.920]  It's been out for a few years. I started seeing it about two
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.520]  years ago. But it's within the tighter circles. It's definitely
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.040]  been around for a few years. But as far as public releases, the
[03:09.080 --> 03:12.360]  big public release would be the the root beer freeze that just
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.240]  recently came out. That was actually available on the Daga
[03:15.840 --> 03:18.720]  site. Nice. That's the root beer, root beer, root beer,
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.640]  Jaro, root beer, root beer, root beer, Jaro. My camera could
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.080]  never focus. If you say that in a dark bathroom, root beer will
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.720]  show up behind you in the shower. Candyman, Candyman. Yes.
[03:32.120 --> 03:34.520]  You know, it's funny that you mentioned that because that's
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.240]  one thing that I absolutely want to, you know, ask him and get
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.560]  into it because being in the hills, you know, of Mendocino,
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.520]  Trinity, or the Emerald Triangle. There's so much stuff
[03:48.520 --> 03:53.280]  that's been around for like 1015, sometimes 20 years that,
[03:53.560 --> 03:58.080]  you know, it's been like the local go to or celebrity, but
[03:58.080 --> 04:01.040]  then it breaks out and then we find out about it. And it's
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.320]  something like, whoa, you know, this is a new strain. And, you
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.600]  know, people like him is like, actually, it's been around, you
[04:07.600 --> 04:10.840]  know, about a decade. And I always found that fascinating.
[04:10.840 --> 04:13.400]  So I wanted to ask him about some of that stuff. And maybe
[04:13.400 --> 04:16.800]  what the breakout strains will be in, you know, another five
[04:16.800 --> 04:17.320]  years.
[04:18.120 --> 04:20.600]  Oh, for sure. Those would be great questions to ask. And he's
[04:20.600 --> 04:23.560]  definitely the man to ask about them. And that like you said,
[04:23.560 --> 04:26.040]  that Emerald Triangle community was really tight knit with each
[04:26.040 --> 04:29.080]  other. As far as like hand in hand and things out to each
[04:29.080 --> 04:32.520]  other, keeping it all like within the family, if you will.
[04:32.920 --> 04:34.280]  So it's
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.280]  yeah, there was a lot, you know, a lot of people, you know,
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.840]  dependent upon those harvests for survival in the legacy
[04:41.840 --> 04:45.080]  market. And granted, there'd be you know, there would be some
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.920]  some friendly and some not so friendly competition. But in the
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.920]  big picture, the people who really connected with the
[04:50.920 --> 04:54.280]  plants, the people who connected with the land, they want to see
[04:54.280 --> 04:57.160]  their neighbors succeed just as well, because they know their
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.880]  neighbors gonna, you know, feed themselves for this next season.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.360]  And yeah, a lot of that stuff was shared. So many genetics
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.840]  have come out of that area, though, it's it's hard to think
[05:08.840 --> 05:13.240]  of another place in this country, that maybe has like
[05:13.240 --> 05:17.440]  spawned or actually bred to, you know, what we consider stable
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.920]  genetics. A lot of stuff coming out of that Emerald Triangle, or
[05:23.960 --> 05:24.640]  sure.
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.080]  No, definitely the the best strains from America seem to
[05:28.240 --> 05:31.160]  have come out from there. Now other areas definitely make
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.320]  great, great cannabis. But some of the the creme de la creme
[05:35.480 --> 05:38.520]  seems to have all seems to have risen from there.
[05:39.320 --> 05:42.040]  Yep, yep. And it is funny, you know, we kind of talk about this
[05:42.040 --> 05:44.640]  too. Sometimes, as you know, different areas of the country,
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.080]  different pockets, different things are popular. My example
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.880]  is always like GMO. popular in Michigan in that area for many
[05:52.880 --> 05:54.920]  years before it made it out here, then all of a sudden, you
[05:54.920 --> 05:57.600]  know, it blew up out here. And being on the West Coast,
[05:57.600 --> 06:00.240]  particularly people in California, well, when it's new
[06:00.240 --> 06:04.120]  to them, it must be new to the world. So you know, you get to
[06:04.120 --> 06:05.560]  treat something old like it's new.
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.480]  That's the reverse of the East Coast bias. That's the West
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.160]  Coast bias for for cannabis.
[06:11.600 --> 06:14.800]  The East Coast. You're an East coaster. That's right. I forgot
[06:14.800 --> 06:19.760]  who I'm talking to. I know you and cheddar Bob. I know. I'm
[06:19.760 --> 06:24.520]  just joking. I love you both. So I you know, one thing that we
[06:24.520 --> 06:27.080]  always kind of do or I like to kind of do is starting off the
[06:27.080 --> 06:30.360]  show. I always like to go for the t shirt. So this episode,
[06:30.400 --> 06:35.240]  we've got I'm representing FCP this time, one of the mossy
[06:35.240 --> 06:38.680]  giant shirts. This was a an artist. He's out of Amsterdam.
[06:39.040 --> 06:42.280]  We actually had a special show where he hung out with Peter
[06:42.480 --> 06:47.320]  talked for a while and drew his little bud guy. So there we go.
[06:47.320 --> 06:51.480]  This is that t shirt. So I always like to start off
[06:51.480 --> 06:57.040]  supporting a community business. And FCP definitely falls into
[06:57.040 --> 07:00.560]  that category. And we've got me gene. Welcome in.
[07:01.760 --> 07:02.760]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[07:03.400 --> 07:06.120]  Doing good. Thank you for joining us. I hear us fine.
[07:06.120 --> 07:08.320]  Everything's good on on your end there.
[07:08.520 --> 07:10.920]  My audio is still a little weird with you right now. It's kind of
[07:10.920 --> 07:13.440]  broken, but I think it'll clear up. I'm just waiting for a
[07:13.440 --> 07:16.200]  second. It usually takes a second. So we'll see. Hopefully
[07:16.200 --> 07:16.640]  it's good.
[07:17.400 --> 07:19.240]  That was crossed. There we go.
[07:20.600 --> 07:23.520]  Nice. Okay. Well, you know, we were just talking about, you
[07:23.520 --> 07:27.000]  know, the hills of Mendocino and, you know, Trinity County,
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.240]  the Emerald Triangle and internet reception is not always
[07:30.240 --> 07:35.720]  the best up there. But, you know, one thing that we find
[07:35.720 --> 07:40.520]  fascinating is a lot of times, people there will have been
[07:40.520 --> 07:45.360]  growing a strain for, you know, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.
[07:45.640 --> 07:48.680]  And it's, it's, you know, locally known, and it works for
[07:48.680 --> 07:52.160]  people. But then it hits the market. And all of a sudden,
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.720]  we're like, Oh, this is this new, wonderful creation. So I'm
[07:56.720 --> 07:59.520]  curious if you've seen, you know, some of that over the
[07:59.520 --> 08:02.240]  years, and if there's any gems that are still lurking.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.120]  Privately traded.
[08:05.600 --> 08:09.720]  I mean, there's definitely some cool things. I just got one that
[08:09.720 --> 08:17.640]  somebody gave me at the at the the Dutch is the regenerative
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.160]  conference, there's the seed swap there. And somebody gave me
[08:20.160 --> 08:22.560]  something and they're like, Oh, this is from down in Willets.
[08:22.560 --> 08:25.760]  And it's called Mendo blue, and it smells like garlic, and it
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.640]  finishes really fast. I planted them so late, but I couldn't
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.960]  tell if they actually finished fast because they didn't sex
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.880]  until it was past the time when they would have started budding
[08:34.880 --> 08:37.440]  even if they weren't early plants, like, right, you plant
[08:37.440 --> 08:41.240]  something in July, and it has to reach the point when it can
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.480]  flower, then you like you can't tell everything's late when you
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.920]  plant it too late, right. So, but it debt to me, it didn't,
[08:49.080 --> 08:52.120]  it's drying, but I didn't seem like it smelled that much like
[08:53.200 --> 08:55.920]  garlic to me, but they were beautiful. And they were really
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.760]  consistent. And they were all definitely real, like, like good
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.160]  hash plants, like they all have the really, really major big
[09:03.160 --> 09:08.720]  stringy resin on every plant. And I only had, I think I only
[09:08.720 --> 09:12.960]  had five girls. But even if you only have five plants or
[09:12.960 --> 09:15.560]  something, if there's something that's consistent across those,
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.400]  you could find out that you have this crazy luck to get the only
[09:19.400 --> 09:21.920]  five out of 100 that are like that or whatever. But these
[09:21.920 --> 09:24.040]  seem like they're pretty consistent. They were really
[09:24.040 --> 09:26.920]  consistent in veg, I went ahead and did open pollination, I
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.160]  think I had maybe seven males or something. And so I just put all
[09:31.160 --> 09:34.320]  the males on all the females. So that I know I didn't lose
[09:34.320 --> 09:37.440]  anything, because I don't know anything about it. And that one's
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.400]  really cool. It seems kind of promising. I think trying to
[09:41.400 --> 09:43.520]  remember what I crossed it with, I crossed it with a couple
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.640]  things. And, and then I just made a bunch of it pure, like
[09:48.640 --> 09:51.160]  just little plants, they're actually not a lot of seeds, but
[09:51.400 --> 09:54.080]  you know, those few different kinds, I'll be able to check
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.320]  them out. But that was one that I was kind of surprised, because
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.320]  I was like, it's not I can't pinpoint what it is. It's not I
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.240]  don't just look at it and go, oh, this is this and that it was
[10:04.240 --> 10:07.160]  like, Oh, this is kind of different. It kind of remind me
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.200]  of like pink champagne. But it was different. And they were
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.560]  just really like, it was obviously not. It was obviously
[10:17.560 --> 10:20.560]  not just tossed together, someone's done something with it
[10:20.560 --> 10:23.920]  because it was really nice. So I kind of considered that like
[10:23.920 --> 10:26.600]  that. There's this other one, the other one some people know
[10:26.600 --> 10:29.760]  about that I call Meyerlemski. That's kind of a little hidden
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.400]  gem. And it's one that's not practical by itself. But it has
[10:34.400 --> 10:40.720]  this really dominant smell and flavor and that cuts across on
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.960]  everything. So that's super cool. There's always a lot of
[10:44.960 --> 10:48.400]  different things I have like a I have a big thick collection of
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.440]  seeds from a friend of mine that's just old stuff. And I
[10:54.440 --> 10:56.800]  have to see like what will come out of those and stuff. There
[10:56.800 --> 10:59.880]  might be some things that are really odd and, and unique in
[10:59.880 --> 11:02.480]  there. And I mean, everybody, you know, there's a lot of
[11:02.480 --> 11:05.480]  things. I mean, like when Blue Dream blew up, I had already
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.200]  been offered that clone like years before. And they were
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.800]  like, it's called Blue Dream because it has a really dreamy
[11:12.800 --> 11:16.880]  high and it's like kind of trippy. And I was like, okay,
[11:16.880 --> 11:20.880]  cool. And then I didn't take it because I didn't I wasn't in the
[11:20.880 --> 11:26.520]  habit of taking on clones that much. And, you know, years later
[11:26.520 --> 11:28.520]  I wound up growing it and I was like, Oh, shit, I could have
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.000]  been growing this and whenever you know, like early early
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.800]  2000s when it wasn't as popular, got a little more popular a few
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.440]  years later, but things like that, they stay around it. I
[11:41.440 --> 11:43.960]  mean, they hang around and then you don't see them. And then
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.080]  there's a lot of classic things too that are that are like,
[11:49.680 --> 11:52.640]  were were popular and everyone knew them and then you think
[11:52.640 --> 11:55.560]  they're gone. And then people those things pop up to you know,
[11:55.560 --> 11:58.680]  like whatever kind of old cool train wreck and, you know,
[11:58.720 --> 11:59.240]  yeah.
[12:00.560 --> 12:03.440]  It's, it's, it's always interesting to because we're,
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.200]  you know, people have kind of got into it. Some people will go
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.800]  with the Acapulco gold, Panama red, that's before my time. I'm
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.240]  more of the 90s, like the cat piss, bring me back to some
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.600]  MTF type of stuff. And then, you know, cookies or even cherry
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.200]  pie. So it's interesting where people get in as far as what is
[12:26.200 --> 12:27.280]  old to them.
[12:28.200 --> 12:31.560]  Yeah. And then what's funny too, is what's new is really just the
[12:31.560 --> 12:34.440]  stuff you haven't seen. You haven't seen those types. Some
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.960]  of them happen through cool combination. I kind of think
[12:39.960 --> 12:43.000]  like, like when cookies came around, it was like a
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  combination of like cool old Afghani types. But with
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.920]  something thrown in the mix to where it really had a lot of
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.240]  resin every time, like a little bit heavier, thicker, more, you
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.280]  know, like more trichomes per millimeter, you know, there
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.040]  gets crammed in there and it makes it really resinous and
[13:04.280 --> 13:06.800]  super dense and stuff. I think that was because of combination.
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.560]  But there's like, when I first saw it, it wasn't like, whoa,
[13:10.560 --> 13:13.000]  this is a crazy new kind of weed. I was like, Oh, that's
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.720]  kind of a cool twist on Afghani. Like it's like a old type, like
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.280]  old humble weed. And then it was just a little bit different. But
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.640]  I think like, usually when you see something, and it seems
[13:27.640 --> 13:30.800]  totally new, there's sometimes when you make combinations, and
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.400]  it's really novel, but I think a lot of stuff is like, like, if
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.080]  we had the ability to see the history of all weed, and we
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.800]  looked at all these things that seem like so new and unique,
[13:41.800 --> 13:45.680]  we'd be like, Oh, that's kind of just coming from there. And
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.960]  then there's some of that and some of it's just a mix of these
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.800]  two or three things or whatever. They're not really like, you
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.680]  know, they're not that they're not as unique as we think. But
[13:54.680 --> 13:57.520]  anything that you see that knee jerk reaction is like, I've
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.040]  never seen anything like this, you know, I think like, you
[14:01.040 --> 14:05.200]  know, that the new stuff is the new stuff is really old. But so
[14:05.200 --> 14:10.280]  whatever's but what's neat about that is that when to find new
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.480]  stuff, you don't really necessarily have to find
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.880]  anything that is like a new creation, you just have to like,
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.040]  look through a bunch of different things. And you'll
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.800]  find all kinds of things that are new to you. And some things
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.280]  that people say like are played out, or they hate them, they
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.880]  hate that turf profile, they hate the plant, they're sick of
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.080]  it, or whatever, you might see it and be like, fuck, I guess
[14:32.080 --> 14:34.080]  I'm gonna have to spend some time getting sick of this one
[14:34.080 --> 14:37.120]  too, because it's good to me, you know, so
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.280]  I yeah, for the longest time, I was either ahead of the times or
[14:42.280 --> 14:46.200]  behind the times, like I was kind of into the fruitier stuff
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.080]  when everybody was in like, the OG and the cush phase. And then
[14:50.080 --> 14:53.160]  as things started to get fruity, I was like, you know, this OG
[14:53.160 --> 14:56.840]  and this cush really isn't that bad. So I was either ahead or
[14:56.840 --> 15:02.320]  behind. And it seems like today too, and it's probably, you
[15:02.320 --> 15:04.760]  know, hopefully, because there's more people doing more numbers
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.440]  with more genetic potential. But it seems like you got to find
[15:09.440 --> 15:12.760]  something that sticks out. It's almost like I make all kinds of
[15:12.760 --> 15:15.920]  music analogies, because I'm a musician. But it's, you know,
[15:15.920 --> 15:18.080]  it's like, there's a lot of Nickelbacks. But when you get
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.200]  somebody like Jimi Hendrix, you're just like, ooh, that's
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.600]  special. And it almost seems like we're getting more of that
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.560]  these days, like it has to stand on its own. I don't know if
[15:28.560 --> 15:31.520]  you've seen some of that as well, or are finding things that
[15:31.520 --> 15:33.720]  are just, like you said, different.
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.560]  Yeah, I mean, the analogy like that with music has always been
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.440]  a really solid one for me, because, you know, you have
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.880]  things that are like, um, you know, like, I kind of feel like,
[15:48.160 --> 15:56.520]  um, like, uh, the really loud in your face things are more like,
[15:56.760 --> 16:02.080]  they're more like the, they're more like pop, or like, heavy
[16:02.080 --> 16:07.640]  metal. They're like huge impact. And then if it's all day, you're
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.640]  like, I don't know. But then there's those things where you
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.600]  might not really, you know, you might listen to I can always
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.040]  remember buying like records or CDs and putting them on. And
[16:22.400 --> 16:25.400]  you listen and you're like, oh, there'll be like these two,
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.040]  you'll be like that. That was worth it. Because there's these
[16:28.040 --> 16:30.240]  two songs that are good. And the rest of this is fucking
[16:30.240 --> 16:35.760]  bullshit. And then you'll listen to it for however long and maybe
[16:35.760 --> 16:37.760]  you won't listen to it for years. And you'll pull it out
[16:37.760 --> 16:40.600]  like five or 10 years later. And you'll listen to it and you go
[16:40.600 --> 16:44.440]  wow, I don't even like those two songs anymore. But there's these
[16:44.440 --> 16:47.680]  other four or eight songs on it that it turns out are these
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.920]  incredible pieces of music you can listen to and listen to and
[16:50.920 --> 16:54.040]  you just keep liking them and you like them now more than you
[16:54.040 --> 16:56.720]  liked those ones with the knee jerk reaction. So I always like
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.800]  look at stuff like that. Like, um, I try to recognize that in
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.560]  what in like what I'm breeding and what I'm like collecting and
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.600]  keeping and you know, like there's some things that are my
[17:08.600 --> 17:11.560]  favorites that I wouldn't ever try to tell somebody to put in
[17:11.560 --> 17:16.040]  like a competition to win a cup or to try to be like big on the
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.040]  shelves or anything because it's just it's understated. But
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.640]  they're really my favorite stuff. And then there's things
[17:22.640 --> 17:27.480]  that are just such a they have such a huge impact as soon as
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.720]  you smell them or see them that um, you know, they have their
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.160]  place too. But you do you won't like, you know, they're, they're
[17:36.200 --> 17:38.480]  they're not the same. It's not the same thing. Those are like
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.720]  the hit single, but it turns out like no, there's these you
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.400]  got, you know, like if you talk to somebody about music, and
[17:44.400 --> 17:48.120]  they don't know like that much about music about a specific
[17:48.120 --> 17:51.280]  type of artist, you'll be like, they'll be like, Oh, do you know
[17:51.280 --> 17:53.760]  so and so you're like, Yeah, I really like this one or not one
[17:53.760 --> 17:56.960]  and someone who's like a huge fan of y'all. Yeah, but you got
[17:56.960 --> 18:00.360]  to check this stuff out. And even when you check it out on on
[18:00.360 --> 18:03.000]  their recommendation, you might be like, they're tripping. This
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.960]  is not that good. I like these other ones. But over time,
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.000]  you'll start to realize like, damn, okay, I see what they were
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.200]  seeing. And there's no like, there's no fast track on that.
[18:13.200 --> 18:17.520]  Like you can't just learn to like to appreciate nuance and
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.280]  subtleties like just right away. That's not that's, you know, by
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.360]  definition, they're not out front. So um, yeah, I
[18:25.360 --> 18:28.760]  definitely think that's like the music is always a great analogy,
[18:28.760 --> 18:33.800]  like, but I tend to think that way anyway, like if you look at
[18:33.800 --> 18:39.720]  something like music or food or playing cards, or whatever it
[18:39.720 --> 18:42.240]  is, you can kind of like, you can kind of look at it and go,
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.560]  Oh, what's in this is like this other thing in these ways,
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.320]  because, you know, like the mechanics of life kind of are
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.880]  like fractal, and they project on to everything, you know,
[18:54.280 --> 18:56.920]  like certain certain rules and boundaries trippy.
[18:57.480 --> 19:00.960]  Yeah, and you know, I DJ it as well. And so it's, you know, I
[19:00.960 --> 19:04.320]  always hear something and you know, it might not be exactly
[19:04.320 --> 19:07.120]  like this. But I'm like, I know, it's gonna go with that. But
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.720]  electronic music too, is a is very repetitive to many people
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.920]  unless you do catch the nuances in there. But I can't tell you
[19:14.920 --> 19:17.920]  how many times I've, you know, I bought a record for one
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.120]  particular song, play that one out. And then years later, I
[19:21.120 --> 19:24.680]  come back and I play the B side. And I'm like, Well, this is a
[19:24.680 --> 19:28.160]  damn good song. I should have flipped the record over.
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.520]  Yeah. And then that's a trippy thing, too. Like I have a buddy
[19:31.520 --> 19:36.960]  who's a really good, a really good reggae DJ. And he's always
[19:36.960 --> 19:39.720]  played that kind of stuff, reggae and dancehall. And he's
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.360]  pretty renowned and well known. And, you know, my two buddies,
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.680]  they have like, they have a sound system together. And, you
[19:47.680 --> 19:50.640]  know, they're, they're good. And they that's what they've always
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.480]  played. But then he went to one party, where he caught a vibe.
[19:55.480 --> 20:00.240]  And he was like, Oh, shit, I understand what this boom, boom,
[20:00.840 --> 20:06.640]  electronica dance music is. He's like, now I get it. And then now
[20:06.640 --> 20:10.000]  he like has to play it because otherwise he's, you know, he
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.120]  caught the vibe. And like, you can't ever you can't just tell
[20:14.120 --> 20:17.040]  somebody, hey, no, you need to catch this vibe. Like, it might
[20:17.040 --> 20:19.960]  work or it might not. And some people will never understand it.
[20:19.960 --> 20:22.600]  Just like, you know, some people are never going to understand
[20:22.600 --> 20:28.560]  jazz or blues or metal, or punk or whatever it is. And then like
[20:28.560 --> 20:31.800]  if you're exposed to it, sometimes it only takes being
[20:31.800 --> 20:35.000]  exposed to it in the right context one time, it might be
[20:35.120 --> 20:40.200]  somebody who you really know, that you you tend to like the
[20:40.200 --> 20:42.840]  things that they've that they've shown you before. So then they
[20:42.840 --> 20:45.440]  show you this one thing and you're like, you smoke it and
[20:45.440 --> 20:51.480]  you go, Oh, okay, I now I get it. But like, in the in other
[20:51.480 --> 20:54.440]  situations, you might not or somebody grew it a little bit
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.520]  better or dried it a little different. Or they roll the
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.560]  joint a little bit better or was a nicer ball. And then all of a
[21:01.560 --> 21:04.480]  sudden, you're like, okay, shit, I have to do that. I have to
[21:04.480 --> 21:06.880]  have that stuff all the time. Just like dabs or whatever.
[21:06.880 --> 21:09.680]  You're like, oh, dab suck. And then somebody gives you a low
[21:09.680 --> 21:14.400]  temp cold start dab and you're like, Oh, okay, it's just steam.
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.080]  It's the shit. I love it. You know, but like if somebody gives
[21:17.080 --> 21:19.720]  you a dab and it's too hot, you're like, what are you guys
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.640]  doing? You know, and people did dabs way too hot for a long
[21:23.640 --> 21:25.880]  time. And a lot of people were like, Yeah, I don't want to do
[21:26.040 --> 21:29.040]  and I still have buddies who are like, fuck all that flavor
[21:29.040 --> 21:32.960]  shit. Like give me the shit red hot and drop way too much in
[21:32.960 --> 21:36.000]  there. I want to like cough and feel like I'm smoking fucking
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.360]  smoking a roach in a ball or something. It's just what they
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.840]  like, you know, so you're out for that. For for taste and for
[21:43.840 --> 21:47.080]  what like has made an impact on you stuff sticks, and then it
[21:47.080 --> 21:50.200]  gets stuck. And then sometimes it shifts. But a lot of times
[21:50.200 --> 21:53.640]  you just get stuck liking some some weird shit. That's how
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.560]  music is. You're like, you're playing your favorite playlist.
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.120]  You're like, Oh, damn, a lot of this stuff is from when I was
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.440]  like, 17 or something like that. You can't get away from it. But
[22:04.440 --> 22:07.200]  then sometimes things get introduced to you and you catch
[22:07.200 --> 22:10.000]  the vibe, you know? And that's I think that's, you know, the
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.840]  same with that's the same with everything. Like, you know,
[22:12.840 --> 22:16.400]  everything in life can be like that. It's definitely different
[22:16.400 --> 22:20.240]  exposures, the context. It's like they say with hallucinogens
[22:20.240 --> 22:23.600]  and psychedelics, they say like set and setting. It's like,
[22:23.760 --> 22:28.040]  it's not just that's not just have a good trip on these
[22:28.120 --> 22:32.600]  chemicals. That's also to have a good trip on food or a good trip
[22:32.600 --> 22:36.440]  on music or a good trip on whatever going to the beach or,
[22:36.800 --> 22:39.040]  you know, I don't want to go to the beach. And then all of a
[22:39.040 --> 22:42.320]  sudden you try like skimboarding or body surfing or something.
[22:42.560 --> 22:47.040]  Oh, shit, the beach is my thing now, you know, like, switches.
[22:47.320 --> 22:49.720]  So we like that too, you know?
[22:50.680 --> 22:53.520]  Yeah, totally. There's definitely a time and a place.
[22:53.560 --> 22:57.040]  And sometimes it does it just you're in a different mental
[22:57.040 --> 23:00.520]  frequency, and you're more accepting of certain things that
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.200]  you might not be. Otherwise, you know, you may be a little bit
[23:04.200 --> 23:08.160]  guarded. But you know, music is definitely like that music, you
[23:08.160 --> 23:12.320]  know, transform, it spans generations. But, you know, you
[23:12.320 --> 23:15.560]  can hear just a few notes, and it takes you back to a memory.
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.760]  It's so strong. It's it's like smell, as in taste as well. And
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.760]  I don't know what what were like, maybe some of the earlier
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.600]  profiles that you can remember that like stood out to you that
[23:26.600 --> 23:29.920]  kind of bring you back to to an earlier time.
[23:30.080 --> 23:33.800]  So there was a whole there was a whole period of time when we'd
[23:34.560 --> 23:37.640]  like I have like kind of like a derogatory term I give weed
[23:37.640 --> 23:41.840]  that's like generic or like formless as far as like a
[23:41.840 --> 23:46.240]  shapeless smell or just just random. I just call it pot.
[23:46.760 --> 23:49.760]  Because that's like what when with casual smokers who are
[23:49.760 --> 23:52.840]  smoking whatever, when I was a kid, it was always like, hey,
[23:52.840 --> 23:55.840]  you have some pot like, oh, I got some pot like was always
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.600]  pot. And then once like I started really like, you know,
[24:00.680 --> 24:04.120]  being in a group of people where we were really breaking down the
[24:04.120 --> 24:08.000]  finer stuff, then, you know, it was we'd always like we'd always
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.920]  say it was dank or it was kind or it was, you know, chronic or
[24:12.920 --> 24:16.200]  killer or whatever it was, you know, it would be like, it would
[24:16.200 --> 24:19.520]  always have like those terms attached to it. So pot is like
[24:19.520 --> 24:22.000]  one of those things where there was a whole time period where
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.920]  everything was just pot to me. Like you smell it and you know,
[24:25.920 --> 24:28.840]  like, that's pot, they're smoking pot, right? Like, oh,
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.880]  you got a bag of bag of pot. All right. But some of the first
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.560]  weed that I saw that really had a big impact on me was, was some
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.920]  stuff. Basically, my buddy gave me some seeds and I grew them
[24:42.920 --> 24:48.800]  out. And I think I was 14. And I was down in Sonoma County. And
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.800]  it was like this really beautiful garden under the
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.960]  manzanita. And he gave me four different things, one, two,
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.680]  three, and four. And they were pulled out of a bud sitting on
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.840]  the table and I grew them. And there was like, the four was
[25:02.840 --> 25:08.240]  like orange juice, the three was like this amazing, like, cush
[25:09.640 --> 25:13.680]  with like a hint of like, kind of like lime peel, but not real
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.200]  heavy, just a little bit, but like a nice cushy, very similar
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.680]  to like, OG, but different, but it was in that realm. Like,
[25:24.560 --> 25:27.320]  like, I would say if I really wanted to find that plant again,
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.560]  it'd be good to pop like 5000 s ones of old OG to just try to
[25:32.560 --> 25:34.800]  find like, I know it's in there. You know what I mean? Because
[25:34.800 --> 25:38.360]  it's right. It's in that realm of flavor where it was like,
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.600]  kind of plainish, but then have this really special thing to it
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.000]  too. That's still to this day is one of my favorite things I ever
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.320]  had. And I only had one little plant, I only kept one little
[25:47.320 --> 25:55.200]  bag. And, and then he gave me, I think the one and the two, if I
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.240]  remember right, was dirt, big bud and dirt perp. And both of
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.840]  those have crazy candy smells. Like if people have smelled my
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.560]  the purple line of the pina that I let out the ones with the
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.960]  purple stems, that's dirt perp and dirt big bud mixed together
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.400]  that make that smell. And so that was like the first thing
[26:20.400 --> 26:24.280]  that I ever had that was just like, heavy on the perfume heavy
[26:24.280 --> 26:30.720]  on the candy, tons of fruit, really earthy. And that was like
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.640]  the first thing that I was just like, I love this profile. And
[26:35.640 --> 26:42.360]  then, um, you know, like, after that, there was there was some
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.440]  some various things, but like my buddy had one that he called
[26:46.440 --> 26:49.520]  cat piss. And it was like real thin leaf and the buds would
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.720]  finish really light green. It wasn't cat piss that would be
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.800]  what people know as cat piss. It was labeled cat piss on this
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.000]  phenotype in my hand. I have this bag of weed. It's cat piss,
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.200]  right? And the guy had seeds where a lot of the plants would
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.800]  be like that. And he'd hook me up. And I remember like going to
[27:07.800 --> 27:15.000]  see Pink Floyd in Oakland, and having a film canister. Just
[27:15.040 --> 27:18.480]  ran, I just took the the buds that he gave me like this much
[27:18.480 --> 27:21.360]  weed and just put it in a film canister like this, you know,
[27:21.360 --> 27:24.560]  and I just remember open it up and pop it in. When you get far
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.680]  from home, and there's no weed there. And you're in like a
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.440]  place like in, you know, in the city or in the woods or on
[27:31.440 --> 27:34.200]  vacation or whatever, you open it up and you're like, Whoa, I
[27:34.200 --> 27:37.440]  didn't even know what I had here. You know? Yeah, I just
[27:37.440 --> 27:42.000]  remember that it was really like tart and cat pissy. And I mean,
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.600]  if if it was still around, it would be something elite. And
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.080]  like I said, like maybe it is something old and it's in things
[27:49.080 --> 27:52.720]  and maybe eventually I'll come across it. I hope I would but
[27:52.880 --> 28:00.640]  I've never seen it since it was it was like citrusy but not in
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.960]  the sense of the terpenes that citrus has. It was sharp
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.960]  smelling and sour smelling. But it wasn't lemon or lime or
[28:10.960 --> 28:14.480]  grapefruit or any of that. None of the perfume that citrus had
[28:14.480 --> 28:18.560]  was just like, it just smelled sour.
[28:18.600 --> 28:20.440]  You know, like sting your eyes.
[28:20.480 --> 28:24.200]  Yeah, it was just like nose burning, just goodness. And then
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.840]  another and then another buddy on the same road had one that
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.080]  they also said was cat piss. And when I smelled that it just
[28:31.080 --> 28:34.720]  smelled literally like a cat pissed on it. And I was like,
[28:35.240 --> 28:38.200]  this is Are you guys sure this is the weed because this kind of
[28:38.200 --> 28:42.280]  just smells like you had in a paper bag and a cat's pissed on
[28:42.720 --> 28:45.640]  and that weed was so tasty. As soon as you smoked it, you could
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.360]  tell that it was just really good fucking weed. And that one
[28:49.360 --> 28:53.480]  was really dark green, and more of like medallion shaped buds.
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.080]  The yellow or one was like spears. Those ones are real
[28:56.080 --> 29:02.720]  memorable to me. And then we had a buddy, our buddy Sky. We
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.960]  called him Grimple. And he had this weed that his family grew
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.480]  and it was like purple all the way or like half and half where
[29:12.480 --> 29:17.520]  it'd be purple on the inside and green on the outside or only
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.920]  every other bract would be blue and then the others would be
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.360]  green and it was really resinous. And it smelled really
[29:25.360 --> 29:30.480]  heavy like true pine with no terpenelein. But it was skunk
[29:30.560 --> 29:36.120]  and it was like skunk and pine in combination. And we called it
[29:36.120 --> 29:39.960]  grapes because when you saw it in a jar, you'd like have it in
[29:39.960 --> 29:44.360]  like vitamin jars. And you when you saw it in the jar, it would
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.880]  like be that it would look like it was like, shrunk down bunches
[29:48.880 --> 29:51.560]  of grapes because of the way the colors were it was green and
[29:51.560 --> 29:55.840]  purple and it had that kind of that dark, deep wine grape
[29:55.840 --> 30:01.440]  purple color to it. And that was like a really memorable, special
[30:01.440 --> 30:05.600]  one. And you know, I've talked about these I think I maybe I
[30:05.600 --> 30:09.200]  talked about these on the podcast or something but those
[30:09.200 --> 30:16.680]  ones were like really, really like stood out. And then you
[30:16.680 --> 30:24.240]  know, what I had that was called candelabra that was insane. You
[30:24.240 --> 30:31.840]  know, the Afghanis like the black Afi, the monkey balls, the
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.600]  big blue, that whole family of stuff that's like, you'd have to
[30:36.600 --> 30:41.840]  relate it to like Bubba and cookies and stuff like that. But
[30:41.840 --> 30:44.560]  they were different. They had a little bit more like big blue
[30:44.560 --> 30:49.640]  had a little more ammonia and spice and incense to it. And,
[30:50.440 --> 30:53.680]  you know, black Afi was like impossible to describe. It was
[30:53.680 --> 30:57.760]  super earthy. And then it had some of that, you know, classic,
[30:58.440 --> 31:01.880]  like what I just consider like dark Afghani smell where it's,
[31:03.280 --> 31:06.720]  you know, you smell it when it burns. Those ones that are like
[31:06.720 --> 31:10.760]  that those ones are always real impressive. And one of the clone
[31:10.760 --> 31:16.320]  that I had called sweat, I still have it. That's really a crazy
[31:16.320 --> 31:18.880]  out there one. That's the only clone I have, though, that's
[31:18.880 --> 31:22.280]  unfortunately infected with hop latent. But I can't bring
[31:22.280 --> 31:24.600]  myself to kill it. So I just keep it by itself.
[31:25.320 --> 31:28.280]  Isolated, and it's still producing fine for you.
[31:28.880 --> 31:32.640]  I just don't grow it. But I grew it. And the reason why I
[31:32.640 --> 31:36.840]  suspected there was something wrong with it was that it was
[31:36.840 --> 31:41.360]  still incredible weed. But it wasn't at that level of what you
[31:41.360 --> 31:46.720]  know, it's supposed to be. So when I started testing things,
[31:46.720 --> 31:49.280]  it was one of the first things that I was like, I got to test
[31:49.280 --> 31:52.320]  that because it's the only plant that I have that isn't the same
[31:52.320 --> 31:57.240]  as the first time I grew it. And it rooted slow. And it used to
[31:57.240 --> 32:00.120]  be like the easiest thing to root used to be like you can
[32:00.120 --> 32:02.760]  read in the week, no problem. And then all of a sudden it was
[32:02.760 --> 32:07.040]  like, it's been like three weeks and it's not rooted. So it was
[32:07.040 --> 32:10.520]  one that I really wondered about. And that's one of those
[32:10.520 --> 32:14.800]  really standout ones, though. And, you know, I don't know,
[32:14.800 --> 32:17.360]  there's like, there. I mean, there's, there's so many, but
[32:17.360 --> 32:20.200]  those are, those are like the ones that stick out as ones that
[32:20.240 --> 32:24.760]  I like, why that I really want to have around all the time.
[32:24.920 --> 32:28.280]  Most of them, I don't have them. So they kind of really, they
[32:28.280 --> 32:31.640]  really stick out because maybe if I had it might be like, yeah,
[32:31.640 --> 32:34.800]  they're cool. But they're kind of legendary, because you can't,
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.760]  you can't have them, you know?
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.160]  Yeah. Is there like a favorite child of the group that that you
[32:40.160 --> 32:42.840]  can't have that you really would love more than anything to have
[32:42.840 --> 32:43.200]  back?
[32:43.680 --> 32:47.120]  One that I didn't mention that I think is what the number three
[32:47.120 --> 32:53.600]  was from my buddy, which was from this lady Madeline. And she
[32:53.600 --> 32:59.880]  passed away a long time ago now. And every time he would have
[32:59.880 --> 33:03.720]  this weed, and he would roll it up or he'd have a piece, I would
[33:03.720 --> 33:06.720]  always want to know what it was. Every single time I'd be like,
[33:06.760 --> 33:10.200]  what's this one? Oh, it's the Madelines. They were always a
[33:10.200 --> 33:12.560]  little different because it was from seed. But it was some
[33:12.560 --> 33:16.320]  really old special Afghani hash plant weed. And I don't know
[33:16.640 --> 33:20.120]  exactly what it was. And I've never seen anything exactly like
[33:20.120 --> 33:24.040]  it. But every once in a while, something kind of reminds me of
[33:24.040 --> 33:30.800]  it. So I think maybe it was like a classic import that was bred
[33:30.800 --> 33:36.120]  really well, probably by her or a friend of hers, she got it
[33:36.120 --> 33:39.440]  from and then it was just kind of a really good gene pool where
[33:39.440 --> 33:44.400]  they were all nice. And that still at this point is right up
[33:44.400 --> 33:47.560]  there with it. Definitely any of the other ones that I
[33:47.560 --> 33:51.640]  mentioned, though, you know, Grim Scrapes is one that we talked
[33:51.640 --> 33:54.320]  to him years ago. And we were like, Yeah, I think that would
[33:54.320 --> 33:56.720]  still hold up. My buddy told him that he was I think that would
[33:56.720 --> 33:59.600]  still hold up in today's market. And he was like, No, it wasn't
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.040]  that good. And we were all just looking at him like, dude, I
[34:02.360 --> 34:04.760]  don't think you're giving it enough credit. That was really
[34:04.760 --> 34:09.480]  special weed. That one was really good. And, and one of the
[34:09.480 --> 34:15.880]  skunkiest kinds of weed. And then I'm trying to remember in
[34:15.960 --> 34:20.000]  the numbers, I think maybe one I think another one of the number
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.040]  threes was the one that came out as what my buddy's dad called
[34:26.040 --> 34:29.960]  the Pissy Pungent. And that that was like, definitely like, you
[34:29.960 --> 34:34.240]  know, the lost unicorn that if someone had that right now, that
[34:34.240 --> 34:38.320]  would just be like that would dominate. It's like the nasty
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.440]  skunk profile everybody wishes they could find. But it tasted
[34:42.440 --> 34:47.000]  better than everything else. And I don't think when people start
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.680]  locking down a lot of like skunk profiles, because I'm sure once
[34:50.680 --> 34:52.920]  people really start looking for stuff, I don't really think it's
[34:52.920 --> 34:55.760]  like gone. I think you just have to really have that focus to
[34:55.760 --> 34:58.880]  want to go that direction. I think people start discovering
[34:58.880 --> 35:02.280]  that a lot of that weeds not that tasty, and maybe not as
[35:02.280 --> 35:06.840]  good as people would hope. But this one was all of that nasty,
[35:07.120 --> 35:12.720]  ruin your house with an ape. And it when we smoked it, it just
[35:12.720 --> 35:16.400]  smoked so good. It was super greasy and buttery and delicious.
[35:16.400 --> 35:22.600]  And that was like, you know, one of those plants where had I
[35:22.600 --> 35:25.840]  known like back in those days, I would have dug up that plant and
[35:25.840 --> 35:28.960]  revenged it for sure. I didn't know that you could do that when
[35:28.960 --> 35:32.320]  weed was already like all the way had been done for weeks, but
[35:32.520 --> 35:36.680]  I would have definitely dug that up and put it under lights. But
[35:36.680 --> 35:39.240]  those ones, those are real classic ones. And then some of
[35:39.240 --> 35:42.200]  my favorite things are ones that I actually wound up being able
[35:42.200 --> 35:45.280]  to keep and incorporate and stuff. And those are lucky. But
[35:45.280 --> 35:51.400]  the ones, the ones that you lose, like, they be, they become
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.560]  legendary in your brain, even if maybe they're not, I don't know,
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.160]  maybe they're not better than what I have now. But they seem
[35:57.160 --> 35:59.840]  like it. They seem like the best weed and I can never get
[35:59.840 --> 36:01.240]  anything that good again, you know,
[36:01.760 --> 36:02.640]  reminiscing,
[36:03.280 --> 36:05.480]  thinking about the ex girlfriends that you only think
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.520]  about the good things about them, not all the, the shitty
[36:08.520 --> 36:09.800]  things that they did to you.
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.120]  Yeah, you're on your own on that one. But
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.080]  well, I mean, the the obvious the the skunk in the room would
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.920]  be Oh, did I say that Freudian slip there, the elephant in the
[36:25.920 --> 36:30.720]  room would be skunk. As far as like reminiscing. And, you know,
[36:30.720 --> 36:33.920]  we've joked, we had a couple couple comments here to make
[36:33.920 --> 36:37.160]  sure to ask you about your 1742 skunk.
[36:38.960 --> 36:41.040]  This one, this one right here.
[36:44.760 --> 36:50.560]  There we go. skunk. Nice. 1885 skunk. It's got the t shirt.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.520]  That's good. That's the skunk train. That's a train. That's
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.480]  not a strain. But you get it works though. That'd be pretty
[36:59.440 --> 37:06.600]  1885 skunk strain. Yeah, but um, yeah, no, I don't. I don't know.
[37:06.760 --> 37:10.520]  I listened to the podcast recently with Tom Hill and they
[37:10.520 --> 37:13.400]  asked him about it. He's like, I don't know skunk weeds. There's
[37:13.400 --> 37:16.520]  a reason why it's not around anymore. You know, and I think
[37:16.520 --> 37:22.280]  that's probably true of certain things. But like I said, that
[37:22.280 --> 37:25.680]  one the pissy pungent it was like, you know, it was just so
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.400]  it could have had no smell. It could have smelled like hay. And
[37:30.400 --> 37:33.440]  when you smoked it, you'd have been like, Oh, shit, we got it.
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.040]  This is this is it right? Wow. But it smelled like, you know,
[37:37.080 --> 37:40.720]  like, straight gnarly. And it wasn't, you know, like a pure
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.240]  skunk profile had other stuff in it. My buddy who gave me the
[37:44.240 --> 37:47.240]  scenes was like, Oh, this has got that weird, skunky. It's
[37:47.240 --> 37:50.760]  almost all got this bad thing in it like rotten soy sauce or
[37:50.760 --> 37:54.400]  something. It had like other edges to it. But no sweetness,
[37:54.400 --> 37:58.680]  no niceness, just rank, accurate, Afghani based stuff.
[37:58.720 --> 38:02.840]  And, you know, it came out of mixed seeds. And I'm looking
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.280]  back and I think it came out of the number I know the four I
[38:06.280 --> 38:09.160]  only had two of them. They were both smelled like orange juice.
[38:09.520 --> 38:13.680]  And the three, I know that one of them was that one that was
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.400]  the crazy, round, just this beautiful, nice stuff with that
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.920]  little hint of the of like of like citrus in it. And then I
[38:23.920 --> 38:26.640]  think it was that plant and the pissy pungent both came out of
[38:26.640 --> 38:29.600]  the number three. So they both popped out of the same bud. So
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.200]  they both have the same mom at least right. Right. Dad's I
[38:34.200 --> 38:36.520]  don't know how the seed was made. I don't know if it was
[38:36.520 --> 38:39.320]  supposed to be seeded. It might have just been a straight couple
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.600]  males they cut down it could have been a neighbor's male. I
[38:42.600 --> 38:44.560]  don't know where it all came from. Most killer seat though.
[38:44.560 --> 38:46.640]  You know, the three and the four.
[38:46.960 --> 38:50.840]  Yeah, no, you just you just really made me think so I just
[38:50.840 --> 38:55.160]  got back from Mexico last week. And while we're there, we picked
[38:55.160 --> 39:01.280]  up a couple bags. And the first one that I popped open was I'll
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.200]  pull it up here, but I opened it up and I had that like, my heart
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.320]  race because I had that just like sour skunk smell at first.
[39:12.400 --> 39:15.160]  It's a smell I hadn't like smelled in a while. And this
[39:15.160 --> 39:20.600]  see this this was it here. But that that was a 20 sec in
[39:20.600 --> 39:25.280]  Mexico. Put it out on the plate there. So you know, it didn't
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.360]  look like anything special, obviously. But I guess to my
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.840]  point was, you know, so of course, I brought back a few
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.600]  souvenirs with me. Because I want I want to dive into these.
[39:38.600 --> 39:44.320]  I want to try them. John John seeds. Oh, yeah. But it makes me
[39:44.320 --> 39:47.960]  wonder now. I wonder if they have multiple multiple dads
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.040]  because it's definitely I mean, this and this, you know, this
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.960]  other the cush the cush that we got. It just looks like it was
[39:56.960 --> 39:59.640]  in a field and you know, just the males weren't called and I
[39:59.640 --> 40:04.440]  mean, nice developed full seeds on there. So I don't expect like
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.440]  intersex traits or any of that to form this many nice seeds.
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.600]  But I wonder if there were multiple strains or cultivars
[40:12.600 --> 40:15.280]  going in that field now? Yeah, there's no way to know.
[40:15.280 --> 40:15.800]  Interesting.
[40:15.800 --> 40:21.840]  That's yeah, even with seeds. I mean, like even I see a lot of
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.480]  times I see people do like breedings where you have and I
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.880]  mean, I do it sometimes too, but I'm like very like I I'll do
[40:31.880 --> 40:34.840]  like a lot of strains but only do like one plant of each so I
[40:34.840 --> 40:37.600]  can really keep track and I can really look at all of them. I
[40:37.600 --> 40:40.600]  put them in pots so if I want I can pick them up and I can move
[40:40.600 --> 40:45.360]  them out, see them and shuffle them back in and it's like if
[40:45.360 --> 40:49.560]  you have a whole bunch of plants in a room you it's really hard
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.840]  to guarantee 100% that there's not there's always some
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.560]  possibility that one of those plants is seeding the rest of
[40:56.560 --> 40:59.840]  the plants and not the plant that you want to use. But this
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.240]  female over here that you don't know that opened eight flowers
[41:03.560 --> 41:06.760]  on it down low because you were doing such a huge breeding
[41:06.760 --> 41:10.040]  project. So I always look at when people are like doing stuff
[41:10.040 --> 41:15.160]  in huge scale. I'm like, okay, so there's really no way to
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.920]  know when somebody is making like, you know, 20,000 square
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.960]  feet of feminized hybrids, if some of those are going to be
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.760]  selfed because did everybody did they really check every plant
[41:29.080 --> 41:31.760]  top to bottom and make sure none of those plants were selfing.
[41:32.160 --> 41:34.840]  And that's the case too with like all the original land
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.520]  races and quality stuff is, you know, there's always people who
[41:39.920 --> 41:47.880]  are afraid of fence. And I'm always like, well, if these land
[41:47.880 --> 41:50.560]  races came from these fields originally, when they first
[41:50.560 --> 41:53.640]  showed up, there's a pretty good likelihood that some of those
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.880]  plants in there were actually either femme hybrids or femme
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.480]  selfings. Because who checked the whole field to make sure
[42:02.480 --> 42:05.920]  that there was no male flowers on any of those females. It's a
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.200]  field full of weed. And by the time you cut it down, male
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.600]  flowers, they wither and they blow off and you would never
[42:11.600 --> 42:15.200]  know that they have been there in the first place. So I think
[42:15.200 --> 42:18.640]  it's just something that you know, like, it can always be
[42:19.040 --> 42:21.400]  possible that it's there. But it's one of the things that
[42:21.400 --> 42:24.840]  drives me fucking crazy. When I'm like, I'm like, okay, I'm
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.200]  gonna take this male, and I'm going to make a bunch of
[42:27.200 --> 42:30.040]  different stuff with this one male because it makes sense. And
[42:30.040 --> 42:32.880]  I'm gonna and I'm gonna have these and then if I keep the
[42:32.880 --> 42:35.520]  male, I can remake it. And if I don't, then at least I have
[42:35.560 --> 42:39.920]  these cool little things and I can go from there. And I'm
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.600]  constantly looking at the plants like come on, none of these
[42:42.600 --> 42:46.120]  plants fuck me up. And sometimes I'll even all you know, like
[42:46.120 --> 42:50.400]  lose out because you'll have a plant and whatever you know,
[42:50.400 --> 42:54.600]  like if you watch your plants really close, when they're like,
[42:54.720 --> 42:58.920]  you know, day 14 before there's even any buds on them,
[42:58.920 --> 43:02.600]  basically, most of these things that have any kind of intersex
[43:02.600 --> 43:07.720]  issues, like, you know, cookie related stuff, sour related
[43:07.720 --> 43:11.480]  stuff, OG related stuff, like a lot of things, there's a lot of
[43:11.480 --> 43:15.200]  things that can potentially if you fuck them up bad enough,
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.280]  which you might not realize you did, you can get some male
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.680]  flowers on there. And so you got to constantly be like looking
[43:21.680 --> 43:24.520]  for them and all look through stuff really early. And if I
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.200]  look at something and I can see that it's like, you know, even a
[43:29.200 --> 43:31.600]  little bit questionable, questionable. I'm like, well, I
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.600]  found it right now. So fucking I'm not even gonna risk it
[43:35.600 --> 43:37.520]  because this could this could ruin the whole thing. And I'll
[43:37.520 --> 43:41.400]  just get rid of it and go, I think it was no good. But maybe
[43:41.400 --> 43:44.560]  it was fine. Maybe but but but you know, it's like if you see
[43:44.560 --> 43:47.600]  something a little bit off, it's like, alright, what I'll usually
[43:47.600 --> 43:51.280]  do at that stage is go through. And if I find something and I
[43:51.280 --> 43:54.280]  look and I go, this doesn't look quite right. Is this a male
[43:54.280 --> 43:59.240]  flower for me? I'll actually, I'll actually dissect it and
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.720]  look and see if I can see the shiny little green baby bananas
[44:03.720 --> 44:07.440]  in there. When they're still like, you know, a 20th the size
[44:07.440 --> 44:10.120]  of what they'll be when they produce pollen. And then you
[44:10.120 --> 44:12.760]  know, okay, boom, and then you go, okay, remove that. And then
[44:12.760 --> 44:15.680]  you don't, you know, you don't run the same risk of that.
[44:15.680 --> 44:18.360]  Because every time you're like, Oh, this is a cool clone. I have
[44:18.360 --> 44:21.280]  it. I want to I want to make some seed of it. But you can't
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.800]  just leave it in there and hit it all with pollen and God
[44:24.800 --> 44:27.160]  doesn't matter. It's seeded anyway, because you get unknown
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.120]  parentage. But like, you know, in a field of weed, I don't know
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.960]  how the Mexican weed was that you got. But like, depending on
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.440]  how it was grown, like there's always a chance that even if
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.360]  they, you know, they know the parentage, there might be
[44:45.360 --> 44:47.160]  unknown parentage in it to you know,
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.480]  it could be drift. Yeah, from other farms. And my base
[44:51.480 --> 44:55.520]  assumption is this was, you know, it was field grown. It
[44:55.520 --> 44:58.640]  wasn't, you know, dried and cured to the typical standard.
[44:58.640 --> 45:01.480]  But you know, you can tell when it just kind of gets packed
[45:01.480 --> 45:06.800]  into piles and then doesn't get too cared for. But yeah, it,
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.360]  you know, so so my plan is to hopefully take these and
[45:12.120 --> 45:15.520]  obviously, so if I plant them, and I get nothing but females,
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.440]  then well, shoot, we know it's a, it was intersect things, but
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.800]  I'm fully expecting to pull males out of here. And open
[45:23.800 --> 45:27.480]  pollinate is is kind of the term that people have used.
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.960]  That's what I would want to do. Basically, would you do as many
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.040]  males as pops up? Or would you just try to maybe select one
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.200]  male to hit all the females? Because I just want to get as
[45:39.200 --> 45:42.560]  wide of an expression for myself and others to look through like
[45:42.560 --> 45:46.120]  there's there is no specific trade or anything at this.
[45:46.160 --> 45:49.480]  Yes. Once you're already seeding them all, like if you're going
[45:49.480 --> 45:52.640]  to seed all the girls, there's no reason to use one male.
[45:53.280 --> 45:59.520]  Because any one of those males that you use could be the one
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.400]  that was the match. That was the plant, especially if maybe there
[46:03.400 --> 46:07.360]  was mixed parentage. If you if that was all, you might already
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.720]  have open pollinated seeds in your hands. Right. So in that
[46:12.720 --> 46:16.440]  case, like it's possible that only one of the seeds in there
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.920]  comes from the male that you would have wanted. And if it
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.040]  turns out it's a male, then when you go through and you pick your
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.160]  one male, you've already eliminated the one parent that
[46:26.160 --> 46:29.440]  you would have really wanted to have the progeny from. Right.
[46:29.880 --> 46:34.960]  So you when you start with something that's unknown, you
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  always want to use all the males. The only thing that I'll
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.480]  take out is is there something that I just really, really don't
[46:45.480 --> 46:52.120]  like. And I'll usually just like, let it be in there a
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.520]  little bit. So like, I'll just like let it open a little bit
[46:56.560 --> 46:59.040]  and then I'll kill it. I'm like, well, technically, there's still
[46:59.040 --> 47:05.120]  a little bit of it in there. Unless it's like, um, um, the
[47:05.120 --> 47:07.680]  only things that are really undesirable to me is like,
[47:07.680 --> 47:10.240]  really, if it was like really heavy intersex where you're
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.440]  like, is it a male or not? Oh, wow. And then I go ahead and get
[47:14.440 --> 47:20.880]  rid of that. And then, you know, I mean, like listening just
[47:20.880 --> 47:24.680]  to Tom Hill recently, he's like a lot of the best plants you
[47:24.680 --> 47:28.960]  ever get. They're not good plants. They're good weed. So
[47:28.960 --> 47:31.960]  when you're picking males, if you're only picking males for
[47:31.960 --> 47:35.760]  being the best plant, you might discover that the ones that are
[47:35.760 --> 47:38.920]  the real big, crazy workhorses that you're very that are very
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.200]  impressive plants, never have the weed you want to smoke. And
[47:43.200 --> 47:46.880]  so in eliminating the weak males, you could be leading
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.240]  yourself to eliminate all your favorite stuff. So with open
[47:51.240 --> 47:54.960]  pollinations, when it's unknown, you definitely want to keep
[47:54.960 --> 48:00.120]  everything that isn't like a huge, disastrous red flash. Like
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.880]  I myself will kill usually things if I have a bunch of
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.120]  males and one of them just gets hammered by powdery mildew or
[48:08.120 --> 48:10.680]  something, then I'll just like, all right, I'm going to kill
[48:10.680 --> 48:13.440]  that one. Because realistically, it's just not
[48:13.440 --> 48:17.480]  something I want to incorporate. Another one is if they get like
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.240]  stock stem rot, you know, some things are really susceptible to
[48:21.240 --> 48:27.080]  stem rot. It's just like the way their tissue grows or the way
[48:27.080 --> 48:31.560]  their roots are. And so things some things that are like that
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.320]  where I'm like, I just I don't really, but if if you're like
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.000]  trying to, if those seeds that you had, you're like, oh, these
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  are rare, and these are the only ones, then like, you might
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.360]  even want to use the male that gets stem rot and powdery mildew
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.840]  and small and hermaphrodite. Because it's all it's that
[48:50.840 --> 48:54.200]  that's the only place that it really is. But for me, a lot of
[48:54.200 --> 48:56.920]  times the seeds that I'm growing, I have some experience
[48:56.920 --> 49:00.920]  with them. And I already made them previously. And so I'll,
[49:01.040 --> 49:05.480]  when I'll do open pollinations, I might do like, you know, a
[49:05.480 --> 49:09.080]  focused open pollination where I'm like, Okay, well, I already
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.320]  know I never liked that plant. I never liked that plant. I don't
[49:13.320 --> 49:15.880]  like that this one right here, all these ones are real
[49:15.880 --> 49:18.400]  resistant. And all of a sudden, now, I'm going to put a whole
[49:18.400 --> 49:22.520]  bunch of pollen in there from something that loves to get a
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.280]  disease like that just doesn't work, you know, and then, and
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.120]  then, like with the females, then I won't, I don't want to
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.560]  really get rid of anything. Because with the females, you
[49:37.560 --> 49:44.240]  don't risk anything. The females aren't going to do the females
[49:44.240 --> 49:47.320]  itself contained. So all the seeds out of the shitty female
[49:47.320 --> 49:51.840]  are in the female. But all the pollen from the shitty males is
[49:51.840 --> 49:57.720]  in every female, right? Yeah. So a bad male has potential to
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.640]  pollute the whole gene pool. A bad female, unless it's
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.160]  intersex, which you want to watch those two, right? Right.
[50:06.440 --> 50:12.080]  Female, it only has potential to pollute its own little slice of
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.000]  the gene pool. And you can easily isolate that by leaving
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.920]  it in the bag and not planting it. But with a male, your male
[50:19.920 --> 50:23.760]  can just, it just jumps out. And all of a sudden, now, every
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.120]  batch of seed that you plant has this thing in it, and you might,
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.760]  it might not be like outwardly observable that this is that
[50:31.760 --> 50:37.120]  thing. But when your weed gets done, you go, Oh, damn, like, a
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.040]  lot more of these than I thought are from that damn male that I
[50:41.040 --> 50:45.320]  didn't want. So I try to do it, you know, like initially for
[50:45.320 --> 50:50.080]  just for preservation, full open pollination, everything, like I
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.480]  said, maybe even herms, although that will be like controversial
[50:54.480 --> 50:57.000]  in people's head, like, well, but if it's fully intersex,
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.360]  it's like, yeah, but this original population has that in
[51:00.360 --> 51:04.600]  it. So right to avoid genetic drift, like people talk about
[51:04.600 --> 51:07.680]  genetic drift, right? And they always think it's like a clone
[51:07.680 --> 51:11.440]  that changes. But genetic drift isn't something that happens to
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.840]  clones that change. That's just like, you know, like, that's
[51:14.840 --> 51:20.320]  just basic, like, somatic mutation, or collecting viruses
[51:20.320 --> 51:23.680]  or doing whatever's going on with it. Real genetic drift is
[51:23.720 --> 51:28.000]  when you remove types from the gene pool when you make your
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.320]  pollinations, and the the overall population, the way a
[51:33.320 --> 51:37.040]  population looks changes slightly, because you removed
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.600]  this thing. A better example of genetic drift is like Europeans
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.680]  who people moved north, they got vitamin D deficient. And a lot
[51:46.680 --> 51:50.480]  of people who survived were this weird mutated people that us
[51:50.480 --> 51:53.120]  light skinned people come from that are different from where we
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.600]  all come from in Africa, where people are lots of different
[51:55.600 --> 51:59.480]  colors, right? It's like this little that's genetic drift.
[51:59.720 --> 52:03.880]  Genetic drift isn't what happens to you when you like start to
[52:03.880 --> 52:06.720]  get gray hair. That's not genetic drift, right? That's
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.640]  just like, that's just a case of our stuff, you know, that's what
[52:11.640 --> 52:13.880]  we're doing. Because it's it's and that's what a clone is a
[52:13.880 --> 52:17.720]  clone is an individual, it's a living individual, like one
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.800]  human being. But populations, they change due to pressures.
[52:23.040 --> 52:27.400]  And the heaviest pressure, let me not the heaviest, but one of
[52:27.400 --> 52:30.960]  the heaviest pressures that they can face is human selection. So
[52:30.960 --> 52:34.920]  all of a sudden, you do lean it. And when that population leans
[52:34.920 --> 52:38.160]  to being new, that's genetic drift. And that happens really
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.680]  quick when you come in and you decide I'm going to remove this
[52:41.680 --> 52:46.960]  and I'm going to remove that. And so you know, you might
[52:47.160 --> 52:50.360]  discover that like, there's these things that are kind of
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.080]  tied up with things, especially like people make seed indoor,
[52:55.160 --> 52:58.720]  right? Or we make seed in depth. Now I make a lot of seed in
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.800]  depth. And I do it for seeds that I release publicly, I want
[53:02.800 --> 53:05.960]  to make sure that when people grow them under any conditions,
[53:06.040 --> 53:08.680]  they're going to be sexually stable, because that's one of
[53:08.680 --> 53:13.200]  people's biggest things that makes them feel like a plant
[53:13.200 --> 53:15.760]  when you grow it, it's shitty, if it herms on you, that's not a
[53:15.760 --> 53:21.640]  good plant. In reality, having a couple seeds in a pound of the
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.120]  best you ever smoked is a lot better than a centimeter pound
[53:25.160 --> 53:28.600]  that sucks. But yeah, it's still a it's high on the priority
[53:28.600 --> 53:32.080]  list. So when I breed, I'm trying to put them under these
[53:32.080 --> 53:35.800]  pressures. But what I'm doing by doing that is I'm actually
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.880]  removing a big section of the gene pool. And I'm not sure if
[53:39.880 --> 53:43.160]  some of those ones that like, okay, so if we grow this in a
[53:43.160 --> 53:46.120]  field, and it's outdoor, and it's perfectly happy, they're
[53:46.120 --> 53:50.000]  100% stable, and there's no intersex issues in these. And
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.640]  among the population that I'm that I'm that I'm removing under
[53:54.640 --> 53:58.960]  this pressure, I have those plants had grown outdoor in a
[53:58.960 --> 54:03.040]  normal situation, one of them might be the one that's that has
[54:03.040 --> 54:06.520]  full resistance to hop latent byroid just doesn't have a place
[54:06.520 --> 54:09.920]  for it to latch on. It might be the one that's fully resistant
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.120]  to spider mites, it might be the one that's fully resistant to
[54:13.120 --> 54:15.720]  powdery mildew. But you won't know because you've removed
[54:15.720 --> 54:18.760]  them because of this other trait. And when you remove it
[54:18.760 --> 54:21.400]  for that, you don't even know that you're doing something
[54:21.400 --> 54:24.080]  good. I know that I'm doing something good, because I know
[54:24.080 --> 54:28.240]  what people's goal is. Their goal is since a meal, right? So
[54:28.240 --> 54:32.920]  you're getting rid of this chunk of the population. But when you
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.360]  make an open pollination seed, as silly as it sounds, you
[54:37.360 --> 54:41.520]  might want to leave in the plants that do good outside, but
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.040]  they harm inside. Because for the guy who's outside, these
[54:45.040 --> 54:49.880]  might be the things that have the high performance outside,
[54:50.240 --> 54:53.280]  but they might have the low performance inside. So when
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.360]  you're making seeds, and everybody wants the seeds, you're
[54:55.360 --> 54:58.880]  like, okay, well, I want to find the ones. But by doing that, you
[54:58.880 --> 55:04.880]  are removing a big section of what's in that original genetic
[55:04.880 --> 55:06.760]  because when you get these things from where they come
[55:06.760 --> 55:09.840]  from, like when you're getting that thing from Mexico, or I'm
[55:09.840 --> 55:11.840]  getting something from a friend who got something in
[55:11.840 --> 55:16.800]  Afghanistan or Thailand, these things in their natural place,
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.360]  they might not actually be intersex, they might just not
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.960]  like to grow indoor. So when you make that true, when you when
[55:23.960 --> 55:26.800]  you make the open pollination, you want to be able to say this
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.320]  is open pollinated. And there's a certain percentage of these
[55:30.320 --> 55:32.880]  that just will not do good inside. There's a certain
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.360]  percentage that will not do good outside and have your your
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.760]  basic description to know this is what they do. But that's like
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.280]  those are for preservation seeds, when people actually want
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.200]  a cultivar like, okay, we're growing this shit, we're going
[55:48.200 --> 55:51.800]  to produce weed, like they want something that's reliable. And
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.000]  so that's where the the breeding of the like, if you take your
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  seeds, you have there, you do the initial open pollination,
[55:59.200 --> 56:02.000]  you put those away, you have a big jar of them are a big bag of
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.520]  them, right? Now out of that you have more than you're ever
[56:04.520 --> 56:07.320]  probably going to grow more than your buddies ever want to grow.
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.400]  Now you go ahead and scoop out 100 of them, or six of them,
[56:11.400 --> 56:15.000]  whatever you have room to grow. And you start breeding with the
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.400]  ones that are the most promising and you find one and you go all
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.280]  these suck, but this one female is so good, then you can try
[56:22.280 --> 56:25.400]  backcrossing. And then if you get more of what you wanted from
[56:25.400 --> 56:28.200]  her in the backcross, then you can go, oh, I'm going to
[56:28.200 --> 56:31.720]  repeatedly backcross because these things are coming through,
[56:31.720 --> 56:34.920]  she's actually throwing herself in to the mix. And it's not
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.600]  super infrequent, these traits that I'm looking for, right? And
[56:38.600 --> 56:40.680]  then you can get it to the point where you're like, well, I
[56:40.680 --> 56:44.120]  started with this really wild seed. And I wound up with this
[56:44.120 --> 56:47.320]  really elite line that always performs how you want it to
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.000]  perform. But the two different things are separate. So for the
[56:51.040 --> 56:56.920]  person who wants to preserve the diversity, you want everything.
[56:57.160 --> 57:00.400]  And for the person who wants to every time be able to plan it
[57:00.400 --> 57:02.640]  and go, I'm going to grow two plants, and I'm going to have
[57:02.640 --> 57:05.680]  the bag of weed that I want, and it's going to be seedless. And
[57:05.680 --> 57:08.480]  I'm going to be able to wash it for hash, or I'm not going to be
[57:08.480 --> 57:11.640]  able to wash it for hash. You want things to be as predictable
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.000]  as they can be. But you still want to have those things that
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.840]  you start with that are the original, the original untouched
[57:18.880 --> 57:21.760]  thing. And that might include keeping things that are
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.760]  undesirable. But it's okay, because through a few more
[57:24.760 --> 57:27.840]  breedings, you can get rid of what's undesirable. And you'll
[57:27.840 --> 57:31.000]  wind up with it's like my buddy have gave me black affi. He had
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.240]  big jar afi. And that was big jar seeds, and had all kinds of
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.320]  shit in it. And then he had another little jar, and it said
[57:38.320 --> 57:41.760]  sugar afi. And he goes, you grow these ones, you'll get that shit
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.560]  that I showed you. You grow these ones, you'll get all kinds
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.440]  of stuff. But big jar afi is really the more valuable seed
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.640]  from a genetic standpoint. And sugar afi is more valuable from
[57:54.640 --> 57:58.840]  a weed production standpoint. So they're not, they're not,
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.520]  neither one is better than the other. Until you know the
[58:02.520 --> 58:04.760]  context of what you're going to do with it, because the
[58:04.760 --> 58:07.600]  mechanics of how they're going to behave is completely
[58:07.600 --> 58:10.480]  different. And if you don't like sugar afi, and you love this
[58:10.520 --> 58:14.080]  other one in the big jar afi, then sugar afi is worthless to
[58:14.080 --> 58:15.960]  you because it's bottlenecked, and it doesn't have the
[58:15.960 --> 58:21.080]  diversity. And if you want sugar afi every time, big jar afi is
[58:21.080 --> 58:23.680]  going to be like, fuck big jar. I don't want that stuff because
[58:23.680 --> 58:26.200]  I'm going to get all this other stuff, and I don't want it, you
[58:26.200 --> 58:30.200]  know. So it's all like the context is really important of
[58:30.200 --> 58:34.520]  what you, of how you choose to breed them, you know.
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.120]  That, thank you so much. That answered a lot of the questions
[58:39.120 --> 58:42.800]  and things that I didn't even know to consider because it
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.720]  sounds like a two step process. You know, the first include even
[58:46.720 --> 58:50.600]  the undesirables, potentially, you know, even herms, because
[58:50.600 --> 58:52.840]  it's going to give the full genetic code, but then it's in
[58:52.840 --> 58:56.120]  that second generation, the offspring of them is where I can
[58:56.120 --> 59:00.080]  start to be more selective. And would you separate those seeds?
[59:00.080 --> 59:02.720]  Let's say you had, you know, three problem plants and seven,
[59:02.720 --> 59:06.480]  you know, golden childs, would you just homogenize those seeds
[59:06.480 --> 59:09.040]  and then plant? Or would you say, well, okay, we're going to
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.560]  try, you know, 25 from the problem plant and 25 from the
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.320]  good plant and see if they care that much. You would be better off so that you would
[59:18.320 --> 59:25.520]  avoid the lottery slot machine card deck, you know, scenario.
[59:27.280 --> 59:31.400]  It's not that likely, but it's possible that when you take a
[59:31.400 --> 59:34.560]  thousand seeds from this plant, a thousand seeds from that plant,
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.800]  a thousand seeds from this, and you put them all in a bag and
[59:36.800 --> 59:39.840]  you mix them all together and then you pull out a hundred,
[59:39.840 --> 59:42.560]  you might still be growing 80 from one plant and you really
[59:42.560 --> 59:46.560]  want to 10 from 10 plants. You know what I mean? Okay. So
[59:46.560 --> 59:50.320]  ideally you would want to keep them separate and then plant an
[59:50.320 --> 59:57.600]  equal amount from each female and do it, but the nature is of
[59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.920]  it that as long as you do mix the seeds together well enough
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.240]  and you plant a big enough population, that randomness will even out.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.480]  Because you know how randomness works. You flip a coin, you might be able to
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.800]  flip a coin and get heads eight times in a row. It's
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.400]  possible. It should be 50-50, but if you flip a
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.800]  coin a thousand times in a row, you'll get pretty much 500 heads, 500
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.280]  tails within a few. But when you do small numbers, the
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.840]  randomness can really bite you in the ass.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.240]  So if you only have the ability to grow smaller populations,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.640]  it would always be smarter to use a little bit from each
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.160]  female. And for the same reason, when you go to use your males, it's ideal
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.080]  in my opinion to collect the pollen from the males,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.400]  mix the pollen together, and then broadcast it on to all of the
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.120]  females. And another way to do that, like if
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.240]  you only had a few and you wanted to do an open pollination,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.000]  you could do a whole set of each. So you could do this male
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.600]  cross a clone of every female, the next male cross a clone of every female,
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.920]  and the next male cross a clone of every female, and then you could mix those
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.600]  seeds together or plant them separately and you would still have the same level
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.520]  of preservation. But to do that is just insane
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.640]  work, a lot of work. But that would be your most
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.040]  like, you'd be most likely to avoid drift in that scenario.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.320]  And it's probably like, the fact that it's so challenging is
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.320]  probably one of the reasons why things drift so hard, because
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.640]  in like places where people grow, like you see these cool fields
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.360]  that people now show on Instagram and on the internet, where
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.720]  you see like what a field of weed looks like in Afghanistan.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.640]  And they keep a few males, but you really have no way to know if
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.760]  all the pollen from one, when it had its big
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.800]  payload one day, it all went on one section,
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.120]  and the other male went all on the other section, and then you only pick seeds
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.680]  from a few females over here and not over there. And it turns out you're
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.240]  really bottlenecking things really fast without realizing it, because you're like,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.440]  oh it's open, it's just open. But in the reality of
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.800]  mechanics of it, you realize that like if you're not
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.840]  taking the pollen and actually mixing it together,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.160]  and putting it evenly on everything, then the earliest male hits more, the
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.640]  biggest male hits more, the tallest male hits more, the branchier
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.880]  male hits more. You know what I mean? So you wind up
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.800]  like, by the time the last male opens, maybe the other males have already
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.040]  taken up all the real estate, and there's no
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.440]  there's no hairs left to be pollinated. So it's just nothing but withered
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.040]  stigmas everywhere, and then this male that you actually
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.800]  wanted in the mix, it just hits and there's nowhere for it
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.400]  to pollinate. So you don't get anything at all. So it is
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.200]  good if you can to take the males that you have.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.760]  Like if you can, it's really good to be able to just take a clone of
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.240]  everything, so that you can use them a
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.000]  little bit in more of a focused sense, so that you can go, okay I got my
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.560]  12 Mexican females and my 8 Mexican males,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.560]  and instead of just like seeing what they're going to do,
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.640]  you can go ahead and take the clones of them, and you could grow
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.040]  all, you could go ahead and grow up your males and flower them right at the right
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.680]  time, so that you know the earliest one was
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.880]  maybe before the females were ready to be pollinated,
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.720]  but you stored his pollen, and the last one
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.680]  was maybe at a good point, but had you not budded the males first,
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.040]  then he would have never, it would have been the wrong timing.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.440]  So there is ways to make sure that the mechanics of it work better, so that you
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.360]  get a really true open pollination. But as long as
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.320]  you're taking all your females, you're growing all your males up, and
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.440]  one of them didn't just seed everything right off the
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.480]  bat, and you take all of them and you just
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.920]  seed them all with all the males at once, you'll do pretty good.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:29.040]  But you can imagine through randomness and the mechanics of the pollen
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.400]  finding its place to actually pollinate everything,
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.080]  that you, that's how you could easily get drift that you wouldn't,
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.000]  it wouldn't, like instinctively you wouldn't think, oh no,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.120]  there, it didn't, I didn't get anything from this male,
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.160]  but when you really look at it analytically, you can go,
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:55.120]  oh shit, the first male kind of seeded way more than the second male, and the
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:00.000]  fourth male, it didn't even do anything. No, no vacancy.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.520]  Yeah, exactly. So you know, it's just, it's nice if you have things that are
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.200]  like fairly consistent and in the same range, so
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.120]  that you know that like the females are ready, and the males are all,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.800]  you know, even if they're not all the way open, some of them are open, and
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.600]  but I recommend to people if you can, you, it might be nice to have your
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.440]  females in one area, even in an open pollination, and your
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.240]  males in another area, and instead of letting your males just
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.080]  live with your females, let your females flower, let your males
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.120]  flower, collect all the pollen from the males,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.720]  you know, and then, which can be as simple as
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.920]  taking that, as taking a garbage can and
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.120]  cutting the top off the male, and shaking it in the garbage can,
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.880]  right, and then doing it with the next male, and take all that, and dump it into
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.000]  a little bag, and then bring that bag in, and dump it
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.240]  in front of your fan, or your leaf blower, or sprinkle it, or
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.520]  put it on with your fingers, or however you want to do it, but having
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.200]  all the pollen there like that, in an even
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.240]  ratio, then you're going to get like a more even
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.880]  reliable open pollination, with less likelihood to drift, you know.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.840]  I like that, that makes sense, and it sounds too like if, you know, just doing
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.520]  a little extra legwork at the beginning, as far as if I did want to
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.760]  isolate the different females to apply the males,
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.800]  taking the clones, keeping them separated, that's actually probably going to save
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.640]  me a lot of time down the road, from having to like separate it out,
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.440]  because I know specifically where it came from.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:42.000]  It's one of those things where it's like, yeah, like you,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.800]  you're going to use a lot more time and focus initially,
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.400]  but in the long run, you're going to save like entire
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.640]  seasons, potentially, entire cycles of having to try to figure things
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.360]  out by like, you know, having them be focused from the start,
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.920]  and all this stuff that I say too, is not necessarily the way that I've ever
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.840]  had the luxury to do it, it's, I'm saying the ways that are the
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.040]  right way to do it. If you ask me, oh well how did you do
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.200]  this? Well in some certain situations, it was like, yeah, I only had,
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.560]  I only kept one male, I did, I bottlenecked the shit,
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.600]  and then I didn't grow all the seeds from all the females and do another open
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.480]  pollination, I said, fuck it, I already bottlenecked it once, I
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.280]  like where it went, I'm going to continue to bottleneck it,
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.040]  and you're basically like, in a sense, you're
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:41.120]  you're like, you know, you're you're fucking up diversity, and you may be
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.840]  doing things that are bad for the genetics, for the plant, for like,
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.880]  there's, you know, everybody has like, at the time you have the plants, you have
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.240]  this much focus, you have this much time, you have this
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.080]  many other projects going on, there's all different ways, so when I
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.360]  say all this kind of stuff, like, there's nothing wrong with you going
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.200]  ahead and going, you know what, this one male out of these Mexicans is
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.320]  really killer, I'm going to take it, I'm going to hit all the females, and I'm
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.440]  going to go ahead and just do one-to-one, and I want to try to get
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.320]  it where I want it to go right away, because the reality is,
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.920]  my job for the next 10 years is not going to be
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.040]  spending all my time to try to breed Mexican
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.120]  bag seed into my magnum opus, right? So it all depends, all these things I'm
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.640]  saying, these are just like, these are like the ideals, so if you know
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.080]  that this is the ideal up here, you can kind of look at it and go,
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.640]  all right, well, what can I do that approaches that a little more closely,
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.440]  you know, and then if you can grow 200 plants and do a 200 plant open
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.120]  pollination, that's kind of ideal. Once you get below
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.680]  that, there's a likelihood that you're going to get
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.160]  some drift, and once you get below 100, it's going to be a lot more extreme, and
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.560]  once you get below 30 or 40, then you're kind of going to be
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.600]  really leaning it somewhere, and when you start doing those
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.520]  one-to-ones, it's extreme inbreeding, and you're
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.680]  getting, you're just one male, one female, it's like, it's going here
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.800]  fast, so it has to be what you really like
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.400]  from the cross, or all of a sudden, you'll be like,
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.400]  okay, you might have to take it back to the parent that you like
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.720]  better that got lost in the mix, or, and if you don't have it, then you're
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.280]  like, okay, well, fuck it, I fucking ruined it, and now it's
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.520]  right, and I'm responsible for fucking it all up, and that happens too, you know?
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.320]  No pressure, no, dude, that's a freaking huge help, but I'm excited just to,
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.040]  you know, just to see what's in there. It's, again, it's one of those things
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.200]  where I didn't mind smoking it, and I'm confident I can grow it better,
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.520]  so to see what it actually expresses as when I grow them out
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.560]  will be exciting, and then, yeah, just go,
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.440]  we'll go from there, but I do want to make some more,
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.800]  damn, that gives me a good game plan, a good
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.840]  overall picture. Any weed that you smoke,
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.760]  that you're impressed by, and you like it, right? Like, you're like,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.760]  oh, I enjoyed this weed, like, and if you find seeds in it,
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.120]  then you should always do that initial open pollination.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.800]  Even if you don't ever grow them, maybe someone, maybe you talk, you have a
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.600]  conversation with someone, and they go, I would love to try those.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.120]  You give them to them, maybe they do the work that you would have liked to do
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.280]  with it, you were never able to do with it.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.280]  I've done that with stuff where I just, I'm like, here,
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.800]  I give the whole thing to somebody who's interested in it, because I go, you know, I
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.920]  might not ever get to it, you seem like you really want to mess with it,
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.680]  so you take it and do stuff with it. And then, you know, years later, you see
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.680]  derivatives of it, and you're like, oh, cool, well, that got
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.680]  out, and it did something, and I might have never actually planted any by now,
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.480]  because everybody has this fantasy that you're
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.120]  going to collect every fucking seed, you're going to grow them all, you're
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.280]  going to grow them perfectly, you're going to fucking be the man with
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.560]  this, and you're going to save the plant, and save the planet,
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.360]  and you go to do it all, and you're like, fuck.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.040]  Like, you listen to that one with, the one with Tom Hill,
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.240]  and he goes, he goes, yeah, he goes, I stay awake at night, sometimes thinking
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.920]  of the ones that I lost, but he goes, my favorite are monkey
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.800]  balls and hates, and I have those. So, that's
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.560]  good, and if everybody did that, though, a lot of people are into seeds, so if
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.240]  everybody keeps their favorite, they won't all be the same, as long as
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.080]  you're sincere, because your sincere favorite is not
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.840]  likely to be number one. Your sincere favorite's more likely to be
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.280]  on the list of all-time favorite strains. It might be like number 22,
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.680]  or number 63, but like, you know, there's always going to be the people who are
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.200]  in production, and they're all going to be growing the same thing, but people who
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.920]  make seeds, it's like up to everybody who's
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.320]  interested in making seeds to go, okay, I really like this, so I'm
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.600]  going to go ahead and make sure that there's this, like, for me, I have
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.960]  like a core, I always am doing tons of shit, it's kind
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.680]  of crazy, I, you know, and I always tell myself,
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.280]  okay, I'm just going to do this, but then I wind up going, but I have all
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.880]  these things, and they're all cool, and maybe nobody else is going to plan
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.160]  them, and so I wind up, like, incorporating other stuff,
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.600]  other projects, but for me, it's like, I have, like,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.320]  pina, grape soda skunk, those, like, come from, like, the oldest stuff that I have.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.320]  I have, like, the Northern Lights oil can, same deal, that's, like, the oldest.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.640]  I have the lime, just the same deal, that's the, goes all the way back.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:44.160]  Then there's, like, all the Jaro stuff, and all these different things that I
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.840]  have, there's, like, this group of things that are, like, okay, so for me,
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.360]  I can't narrow it down to two, but I can narrow it down to, like, six or
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.720]  eight, and as long as you don't have too many,
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.600]  it's, like, seeds are good, seeds are fine for,
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.600]  you know, six or eight years, no problem, 100%,
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.520]  even if they're just usually in your closet or something, so
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.680]  if you can just make sure that you have them to where it's, like, okay, this year
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.760]  now, I know that I really like this the way it's bred now,
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.120]  it's, like, everything in it is good, there's no bad ones,
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.400]  but I don't really want to lose anything in it, then you can start going, okay, this
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.440]  year, I'm going to open pollinate pina, this
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.400]  year, I'm going to open pollinate Jaro, and when you've already bred these
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.040]  things in different directions, that's where it gets crazy, because you're, like,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.960]  well, which one, though, like, which, you know, when you, when I
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.800]  go through my things, I'm, like, okay, there's
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.400]  all these different females from all these different years bred with all
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.480]  these different males, like, okay, well, I guess I should just
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.480]  take, you know, find my favorite 10 and grow
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.520]  100 of each and have a thousand plant open pollination,
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.440]  and then have five or six hundred females or whatever, maybe do them small
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.800]  so it's manageable, take all those, mix them together, and put them in the
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.760]  fridge, and there it is, Jaro for 20 years, you know, that you
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.800]  don't have to even touch it, and then the line work, you can do all
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.320]  that, but, like, you know, it's, it's, like, a huge problem of
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.680]  prioritizing what you keep and which ones you're going to do, and,
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.520]  like, you know, so then you got to be, like, okay, is that you grow the Mexican,
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.840]  and then you're going to go, it's cool, but I have these other ones I
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.800]  want to spend my time on, and, you know, and it's a bummer, because
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.520]  how does everything get kept? It's almost impossible for everything,
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.120]  for everything to be kept, but it'd be a lot better if everybody kept one or two
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.320]  things instead of zero, you know? Yeah, absolutely, would be, we wouldn't
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.960]  lose some things, and I've, you know, I've got my two right now that I'm holding,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.560]  holding on to that I just don't want to lose.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.960]  What's your favorite weed? Right now, it's Westport grape juice and a
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.400]  Kool-Aid man. Kool-Aid man came from Bee Leaf Cannabis.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.000]  The Westport grape juice is something I've just been playing around with for
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.080]  the last few years, but it's a solid one for me. It's a
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.720]  good producer. It's got the bag appeal, as they say,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.520]  but it's a smooth smoke for me. It helps calm, like, my mind. It helps calm my
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.080]  stomach. It's something that I enjoy at night.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.680]  Yeah, those are the two that I keep, and again, it's pretty much
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.360]  effects-based. I want things to be flavorful,
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:39.120]  because pretty much any weed's going to get you high these days, but
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.560]  so it's got to have a good effect for me, and again, I want it to be something
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.480]  unique. Like we're saying, there's so much, there's so many different flavors,
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:52.160]  or just same flavors out there, that it's got to stand by itself.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.600]  I want the Cher. I want the Madonna. I want
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.040]  that one-name artist that you compare other people to. It's like
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.880]  Eminem. It kind of sounds like Eminem, but people don't really
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.640]  be like, well, Eminem sounds like...
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.720]  You might not like it, but you know what it is when you see it.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.840]  Yes, yes, and there's a lot of flavors out there that are
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.000]  polarizing. I kind of almost like that. It's like,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.440]  there's no middle. You either love it or you hate it. It's that
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.880]  spot on to what it is. Yeah, that's how extreme,
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.600]  intense things are. That's like people, whatever, you don't like,
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.520]  you know, yeah, things that... A lot of things that people
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.640]  really, really love are going to be the things that people just
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.720]  really fucking hate. A lot of things that people are like,
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.840]  whatever. That's like, kind of everybody feels that way about it.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.960]  Yeah, whatever. You might not even like it.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.280]  You might not like it, and a lot of people might not really
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.320]  like it, but there's nobody who's like, that's that shit's terrible,
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.440]  because it's just, it's lukewarm.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:08.480]  Yeah, it doesn't offend me, but it doesn't excite me either.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.840]  Yeah, yeah, I like the ones that are kind of extreme for sure,
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.560]  like in certain senses, but it's weird because a lot of the ones that wind up
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.160]  being my favorites are a little bit more
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.480]  subtle. Like everybody sees the lineage of
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:30.720]  Jaro and assumes it must be like crazy, gassy, kush, sour. It's like got all
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.440]  this stuff in it, and it's got what I like a lot out of those
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.280]  things, but it's subtle. It's not like a
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.760]  louder OG. It's like, no, it's not. It's less loud
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.560]  than OG, but for some reason I like to smoke it
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.680]  more, and it doesn't burn out on me.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.440]  It's a trippy thing, so I wind up really,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.120]  really liking it, but still like it is
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.560]  different. If you don't have it, you can't get it elsewhere.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.560]  You can't be like, oh, I really wanted to smoke this Jaro, but it's cool because I
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.960]  got some OG, or I got some
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.960]  kuknis, or I got some sour. It's like, those are cool, but if you really want to
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.320]  smoke Jaro because it's what you like to smoke, you're going to want to smoke that.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.640]  So as much as it's not really overstated,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.880]  it's still very much in its own realm, and
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.240]  you have to have it to have it.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.320]  Yeah, and I guess I stand corrected, Buddha Boy.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.040]  Love you. Eminem sounds like Roy Orbison.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.320]  Not really, but I'll put that up there anyway.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.080]  Maybe the timbre of his voice side by side. I've never checked, but
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.520]  they definitely have a different lyrical structure, I would say.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:02.080]  Yes, definitely. And speaking of, Dave, I'm going to put
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.200]  you on the spot here. Boom. What do we have
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.320]  with Jaro in it that we can maybe hear a little story about?
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.200]  Well, what I'd love to talk about with the Jaro is the Katsu Bubba Jaro that you did a
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.560]  release of. I ended up making some F2s, but after
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.400]  hearing you talk about proper open pollination, it makes me want
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.280]  to go back into the F1 generation and really do some better work with it,
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.600]  because I just love what the Jaro brought to the equation.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.200]  It kind of kept the Bubba flavor, but it really made for an
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.080]  uplifting kind of a high, not the berry into the couch that I
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.480]  normally get with a lot of the Bubba. It was definitely just, I really
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.920]  enjoy it, so I'm going to have to go back into that F1 and
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.360]  work it a little further. I brought it to F3, but now I got to go back.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.440]  I got to go back. Yeah, I mean, it depends. If you really
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.200]  are in love with what you have at F3, then it's like, cool, you've got the
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:05.360]  slice you wanted, and you're good. And it's not
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.360]  foundational Landrace heritage stock.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:19.600]  There is Jaro, and there is Bubba, and so it can be remade in a sense,
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.200]  but yeah, I mean, if you really, really like something, it's
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.200]  definitely worth using all of them to start, so that you have that big bag
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.400]  of the first ones you did. And then when you do those F2s,
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:45.040]  you might have some crazy stuff that where you jump off at F2 is going to
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.640]  be, it's going to define a lot of what you wind up with in the future.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:57.360]  It's going to guide you. I see a lot of people, the Katsu, Extra Sour, some
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:04.080]  Bubbas and some diesels, or I mean, yeah, some Bubbas. We do love their
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:11.680]  seeds here. Let's see the Key Lime here. Key Lime, Kush, there we go. Key Lime,
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:18.480]  Pi, P-98 Bubba. That is one that is on my popping soon list. And then the other
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:25.280]  one here was the Shromba, which I'm pretty stoked again. So the P-98 Bubba,
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.680]  that Katsu Bubba, P-98 Bubba, my stomach loves them. It handles it good. And
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.640]  Shromba was one of my wife's favorites that we just haven't seen around for years. So
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.560]  these are on the two pop soon list. Again, just looking for that medicinal factor.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.960]  Hopefully I find some in there, but they're all feminized. So we'll see what I could do with that.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.480]  Yeah, well, we'll see what comes out before I say anything else really.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.200]  You know, the T-1000 Jaro was also excellent. Another fantastic Jaro.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.920]  Got the special Indica number four. Let's see here. The Hong Kong Phui,
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.800]  which was the dog shit times the T-1000. Oh, I can never get focused to work.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:20.320]  There we go. So Old Family Purple and T-1000, those. Can you maybe fill us in on that one,
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.960]  Me and Gene? This is kind of from the hills of Mendocino, is it not?
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:34.320]  Well, from, yeah, from CSI. The Old Family Purple is Urkel Triangle Kush.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:35.540]  Okay.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:45.920]  So that was one of those ones where it was like, you know, I feel like from different stuff that
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.840]  I've grown and bred and checked out, like I think everybody who's done a lot of work with
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:58.000]  all that kind of stuff kind of feels like all the stuff that's like cookies, cherry pie in that realm
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:05.760]  of stuff, which leads you into gelato and runs and all the derivatives of it. I feel like it's
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:12.480]  all kind of Urkel derivative. It's like Urkel Bubba OG is like my best guess of what's really
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.960]  in there. And then there's a couple other like little ingredients in there that make it
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:27.120]  a little different. But the T-1000 is cool because it's that type of a thing where
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:35.920]  it's like very contemporary. Right now, it's the kind of weed that you can look at and everybody
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:45.680]  knows, okay, that's the shit, even though it's not whatever gelato derivative. But it might be
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.920]  the same. It might be kind of the same. It's just that it's less bottlenecked. So there was a little
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.920]  more room still for different kinds of fruits to pop out of the Urkel, different kind of gases to
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:05.200]  pop out of the TK. And I grew some of the TKS ones and it was really cool because some of them were
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:15.280]  big Afghani, really big. I only grew a pack. I think I had seven girls. And one of them just
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.240]  had really big Afghani buds on it. And it was a little more plain and it was more like what I
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:27.680]  relate as Hindu, like the Hindu that I have. And it was just like this really big, huge, chunky
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:36.000]  plant that you don't usually get from OG stuff. And then there were some in there, there was one
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.920]  that smelled like apple cider. And there was then a few that were just straight nasty OG.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:50.240]  And that's cool because then when you take that and you cross that with Urkel, Urkel is the same
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.560]  way. It's like, yeah, there's Urkel. What people know is Urkel. But there's other weird stuff in
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.120]  the background of the Urkel too that pops out when you first breed it. Some of it's not as good,
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:05.840]  but a lot of it's really cool. And so the T1000 is like a really cool plant. It's hard for me to
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.400]  describe. It's sweet, cushy, but not like, it doesn't smell like Urkel. It doesn't smell like
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:20.560]  OG. It smells like itself. It's a cool plant. It's really chunky. And that was from CSI giving
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:32.480]  that to, I think it's Tigard Farms. That's in Oregon, right? Yeah. And so then he cloned it.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:39.440]  And so that's like his selection out of that. It's a special selection. And I wound up getting it.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:49.040]  And I didn't, I just, I like, it was one of those clones that I had. I didn't keep it.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.640]  Typically, if I know people have things and it's more contemporary, like Caleb, I consider him to
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.040]  be like one of my contemporaries. Like I was at shows sitting in a booth and his booth is next
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:18.240]  door and we're bullshitting and we both have our little stuff. And I feel like if people have it
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.720]  and it's around, it's not one that I need. I don't need to preserve it. He's one of the best
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:29.520]  preservationists. His buddy who found it has it. People have it. So I just kind of took it and
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.280]  bred it with a couple of things that I thought would work well with it. And I still haven't
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.920]  even grown any of them, but I did put up a couple of them when we did charity stuff.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.320]  And so the feedback is really good on them. They're super cool. And
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.800]  the, you know, as far as the origins of it and stuff, it's real simple. It's just something
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:58.400]  he femmed it. He made them, he put them out, the whole family purple is available. And then
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.720]  what does he have? I think he has like, I'm not sure I might be fucking this up, but I think like
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:14.400]  Obama Kush, which I think is Mendo perps. I can't remember what that one is, but I think he has one
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.440]  called like Air Force One. And it's like a cross of two of the elite clones that got pulled out of
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:26.240]  his crosses in that little time period. And that was like one he didn't have a lot of. And those
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:33.760]  are like super good too. And I think if it's not T-1000, I think it's half of maybe a different
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.800]  old family purple, but the old family purple definitely like that's a sensible one to take
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:46.960]  the OG and the Urkel, put them together because it's like, we're kind of in an era where I think
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.240]  what people recognize as dank weed is really a combination of like Kush and perp, you know?
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:59.120]  And ever since those things got circulated in the mid 2000s where kind of everybody can get them.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:07.120]  That's like where we're at, you know? So that the, I think it's like a cool take on that.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:13.760]  Cause he went back to the, the Urkel's older than granddaddy. The TK is older than everything else.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.800]  It's those are like the oldest, they have the most potential to put out some odd combinations
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.640]  cause they're not bottlenecked. Whereas when you breed with other things that came later,
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:30.400]  that are maybe the same lineage, roughly you're going to have like a smaller slice and less
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:37.920]  potential to get trippy shit. So the T-1000 is a fresh hybrid of both those plants. So I think
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.880]  when you breed with the T-1000, there's still probably a lot of available trippiness in there
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:50.400]  to pop out. So that's cool. And that's good. That answers to, you know, my, my other question
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:57.760]  too, is, you know, there's, there's Mendel perps, there's Urkel, there's perps one. I,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:06.480]  I was never really clear on which one came first. So Urkel's been around since 96 in Redway and
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:16.400]  Humble. And that's as old as I can follow it back. I don't know if you see the SR-71 pictures
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.840]  from Oaksterdam around the same time period, it's like really similar, but I've never grown it.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.560]  So I don't know how similar that is, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're like closely
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:36.080]  related. And then, I mean, everything that I've ever had much experience with that comes from
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:44.160]  Northern Cali. It's a little piece of a gene pool that's broader, that's more common. So like
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:52.640]  people clone things that are elite among a population. But I feel like probably Urkel
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:57.680]  came out of seed where somebody had a bunch of seed and Urkel was one of the really good ones
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:02.960]  in it. And a lot of them are not like Urkel, but some of them are, and they were like, oh,
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.680]  let's clone the good one, you know, because they couldn't lock it down or whatever. And then,
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.280]  you know, I think it's kind of the case with all of the popular purples. I wouldn't be surprised
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:23.360]  if they all share a grandmother, you know, or if there was like a seed that was grown among a group
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.600]  of friends for a long time. And these are just the remnants of what we know of it. And those people,
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.960]  whatever, switch strains, or they're like, oh, we want something heavier. You know, they all come
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.200]  from right at that period when you didn't have to have weed that was really outstanding. That was
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.720]  something you wanted for yourself, but you could sell anything. So that's why a lot of people grew
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:53.680]  Salmon Creek Big Bud and Trainwreck. And those are really good plants. Mr. Nice Guy, Blue Dream.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:59.360]  I'm not saying those plants are not really good, but the difference between like, if you're used
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.920]  to seeing Salmon Creek Big Bud and Trainwreck, and all of a sudden someone gives you a bag of dry
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:10.640]  purple Urkel, you're like, what the fuck is this? This is crazy. And now at this point, it doesn't
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.520]  have that effect on me. Now I see it and I'm like, yeah, that's real Urkel, cool. I'm used to it. But
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:22.320]  it was such a harder plant to grow. It got such a smaller amount of weed on it. When you grow it
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:33.920]  outside, it liked to rot. It was like very slow and small. So I wouldn't be surprised if previous
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:41.360]  to those clones circulating, a lot of it kind of just kind of fell by the wayside because people
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:47.360]  were like, well, we could grow anything and it's all worth the same amount of money. And we can
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.080]  grow weed for our own smoke. But when we're going to grow a lot of weed, we're not going to smoke
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:57.440]  at all. So you kind of come to the conclusion when you're growing a lot of weed, like it doesn't
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.080]  all need to be the shit I want to smoke. I only need to have as much as I want to smoke. So a lot
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:07.680]  of people might've been like, okay, well we have the Urkel clone. Why pop any more of these seeds?
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:13.440]  Let's just grow fucking Big Bud or let's pop these other seeds that we know are always really big and
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:21.520]  reliable and weather tolerant. And you know, so production quality. Yeah. I think a lot of things
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:30.000]  just kind of went like, they kind of went under right before that because they weren't really
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:38.880]  as practical to grow. And then it was like, Urkel kind of was such good weed that it changed the
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:46.000]  game because once you sell it to people, they only wanted that. And so all of a sudden they're like,
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.360]  they're like, we want it. And you're like, well, I don't have that much of it. And they're like,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.400]  well grow more because I'll buy it and I'll pay you way more money than you're getting for this
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:03.040]  other shit. And then people go, well, way more money than it's not actually a small producer.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:10.240]  If it's worth this much more and it sells this much faster than people look at it and they go,
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.040]  oh, okay. And that was the beginning of people going, okay, so it's not just about being dank
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.560]  because these other plants I'm talking about are dank, but they throw down blue dream,
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:28.080]  throw down the dank plant. But some people don't like it, but it's a great plant and it gets so
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:34.320]  much weed. But then when somebody shows up and they don't want your blue dream and all they're
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.880]  asking for is Urkel, you go, well, then producing something that produces more isn't practical
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.040]  anymore. And then all of a sudden then people are like, okay. And that opened the door for people
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:56.160]  to grow things like OG, which you could get way more money for it even though it was like weed
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:02.320]  that was really hard to grow. So it's like, okay, it gets prioritized when anybody wants to buy
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:07.040]  weed. So you're like, I know I can sell this right away. So people all of a sudden go, okay,
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:15.280]  I'm going to grow this plant that's not the best plant, and it's a pain in the ass and I don't even
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.760]  know how to grow it right. And I'm figuring it out, but I'm going to keep doing it because I know
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.600]  that although it's not as reliable in the garden, it's reliable in the marketplace. And Urkel,
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:33.600]  Urkel, in my opinion, was the first plant that invented that paradigm in Northern California,
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:41.120]  where it became a thing where it was all about like, what is the weed in the bag versus how's
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.680]  the plant in the garden? And without Urkel, people wouldn't have ever thought to like grow
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.200]  cookies or these other things because they'd be like, dude, I'm just going to keep growing
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.560]  train wreck and blue dream and Mr. Nice dude. I'm growing these things. I grow these outdoor plants
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.400]  and it's beautiful weed and I'm getting like 10, 12 pounds. You grow Urkel and you get like three
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.360]  or four pounds. You're like, fuck this, you know, but because of that thing of all of a sudden the
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:16.400]  dynamic and now it, that has like snowballed and progressed to the point where now people will grow
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:23.920]  Skittles in like 1998. If anybody tried growing Skittles, they would have gone, it tastes good,
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.040]  but fuck this plant. I'm never growing it again. And that's actually what happened to that plant.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.200]  It was really common and everybody was like, fuck it. And they all threw it away. And the dudes who
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.000]  wound up popularizing it were the only dudes who believed in it. And they wound up making it this
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.040]  thing where it became this big thing. And now people know the flavor so well that they understand
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.720]  it. And right now at this point, it's a way, it's still a more of a profit. It's more profitable
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:56.160]  to grow the worst plant you've ever seen in your life, which is Skittles. It's more profitable to
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.720]  grow that than it would be to grow train wreck or these other things that people just don't really
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:08.320]  want in, in, in, in bulk for a good price. People are like, well, fuck it. If I can get real
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.360]  Skittles, I'll grow real Skittles and then get good money. And that all goes back to that
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:24.240]  Urkel coming out. And I think that anything before that, like a little, a little ways before that
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:28.800]  people were like, a lot of people were growing like outdoor and like Tom Hill talked about it,
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.440]  growing outdoor in the shade. So you grow these things that when you grow them in the sun,
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.960]  they veg slow, they're too compact. The buds aren't that big, but if you take those things
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.600]  and you put them under the manzanita or the white thorn or the Madrone or the pines or whatever you
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.880]  got, where you're growing gorilla weed, they stretch more and with lower light, they get
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:55.280]  fatter buds. And then when you grow in a gorilla, you tend to feed less. And these plants like to
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.040]  be fed less, some of them, and they get bigger buds when you feed them less. That's how the
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.200]  Hindu was. You feed it, it doesn't give any buds. You give it sun, it doesn't give any buds, but you
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.280]  put it in the shade and you only give it just enough food and you get fucking baseballs all
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.840]  the way up and down the hill. Sour diesels, the same way you want to grow sour diesel, get it out
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.000]  of the fucking light. You know, you put sour diesel underneath a manzanita and you'll have
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.040]  the best sour diesel you ever saw. It'll look like a hybrid of sour diesel because your buds will
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:29.040]  just be round on top and easy to trim. And so I think that things like those purples that you're
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:36.000]  talking about, they all started with people who were like those gorilla growers who could grow
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.280]  something like monkey balls and it would be practical for them. But then as soon as everything
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.680]  moved into the full sun and people started growing in 100 gallon pots, 300 gallon pots, huge beds,
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.120]  huge trenches and all this stuff, then it started to get to the point where it was like
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:01.040]  really impractical to grow these old things. And then I think everybody lost their stuff right then
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:13.200]  and Urkel was that sole survivor of that era where it was a clone that just like just made it. It was
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.560]  like, oh, it was almost extinct, I'm sure. And then it got circulated and then that whole market
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.600]  phenomenon happened. And all of a sudden it was like, okay, it was the one that could make it.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.680]  And probably a lot of the things from back in that time period where it came from, if people
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.800]  hadn't lost them first, they would be the things we were talking about now. But before they could
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.320]  ever get popular, they went away. And Urkel was just crazy enough that people went, I don't really
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.960]  like to grow it that much, but I got it figured out. So I'm going to keep growing it. And then
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:53.440]  it created its market. And that created this modern extra picky market, which is good for
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.280]  things like cookies and Skittles, which are a bitch to grow. But once you do them long enough,
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.040]  it's like they pay their tuition while they're learning. And then you figure out really how it's
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.040]  grown. And all of a sudden you're like, okay, shit, this is actually practical now. And then
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:14.400]  people have kept them because some people can grow the shit out of Skittles. I can't grow the shit.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.680]  I mean, I could, but I don't have any reason to. I don't grow a bug like that to sell.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:25.440]  So it's like, same with Urkel. I don't really want to grow it. I grew the hell out of it.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:33.600]  I wish people here would think or look at hazes that way, at least, too. Because again,
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.800]  obviously it's a much longer flowering plant that prevents a lot of people from wanting to
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.800]  grow it. But if there was that premium for it, if there was that demand, I'd really love to see the
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.560]  hazes come back, but I don't see that at all. I don't know if that's...
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.360]  Yeah. I think it suffered the same fate in the same era where it was like, okay, what's practical?
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.680]  It's all worth the same amount of money. So everything got this focus on practical plants,
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.200]  practical plants. People started losing the short purples. They started losing the late,
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:12.400]  crazy equatorial narrow leaf drugs. They started losing all this stuff and it all got narrowed
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:21.840]  down to what's fast growing, fat buds, frosty, potent, and easy to grow, easy to trim. And that
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.800]  just takes down your options to be this really narrow window of what you're actually going to
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.800]  put in your lungs. And it turns out that a lot of the things that you actually want to smoke and
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:40.720]  have go into your brain, the plant's not going to be quite as good as that. And I think that now
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:51.440]  that the market dynamic shifted to where you can grow something like these urkyl derivatives,
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.640]  where they're still hard to grow. Cookies, still not blue dream. You get it down,
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  you can grow it good. It's really dense. You can grow it good. But I think that because of that
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:14.560]  different shift, that is what made haze come back where people went, huh, so I like to smoke
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:21.680]  urkyl. I like to smoke cookies. These things suck to grow. What else sucks to grow
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:28.400]  that is killer fucking weed? It opens your mind, you know? So now people are going to start to go,
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:35.360]  oh, okay, so if you figure it out, maybe haze doesn't suck to grow. We just need to take clones
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:39.440]  and we need to flower them when they're this big. And we need to put more of them in there and we
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:46.640]  need to support them well. And then it might turn out that per walk per day, especially if you have
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:51.520]  a premium thing that you can maybe actually get more money for or in today's market that you can
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.560]  actually sell, because the name of the game now isn't about having something that's worth a little
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.920]  more. It's about having something that you don't have to throw away because people just don't want
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.320]  it. Because now people grow all these things that we're talking about that came into vogue in the
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:15.440]  90s where it was that little narrow slice I was talking about of practicality. And now people
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.960]  still grow those because they go, they're good. This is good weed. This is what I like to grow.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:25.360]  It's good to grow. And people are like, sorry, dude, nobody wants to smoke this. They want to
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:34.560]  smoke Skittles. They want to smoke Runts, whatever the thing is. And so I think now it might get to
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.080]  a point where when people understand what Haze is, it maybe it can make a, I mean, I know it's
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:47.680]  already making a comeback, but maybe it can make like a strong, real, lasting comeback. Because,
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.160]  you know, but it ain't for everybody. I don't think. I think a lot of people will smoke Haze
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.560]  and go, yeah, I fucking hate that. I don't want to feel like that. You know, the Hazes in America,
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.680]  I think they may get just pulled too early. They don't get to go too long because a lot of them
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:08.880]  will give me that like paranoia or the raciness, which is kind of the goal. But sometimes it's a
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.640]  little over the top. In the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, I love the Hazes there. Like the
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.200]  Hazes, both me and my wife are just like, that's our go-to. Like, give me some of that stuff.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:25.760]  Yeah, I love all that. The Haze stuff. Like it's some of my favorite weed. It's definitely right
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.840]  up there. Like there's nothing really that can beat it. The only reason why I've never like had
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:39.040]  a lot of focus on it is just because of the plant. You know, I've always wanted those plants.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:45.600]  Like I love to grow. I don't just love to smoke. So I like the plants that are the ones that are
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.240]  fun to cut down. I don't, you know, and I don't live like, I don't, you can go maybe,
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:01.680]  I don't know, 20 miles east of where I live, or you can go 50 miles south. And all of a sudden,
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:06.720]  you'll have great environments for growing that kind of stuff. And for me, it's just like, if I
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:13.920]  grow that, you're going to be angry. You know, it doesn't work because it's, you know, so for me,
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:21.440]  have the luxury, really. Yeah, I can't do outdoors where I'm at in Washington. So
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.640]  in any outdoor, I'm always kind of jealous of, you know, one of those life goals, I will have
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:33.760]  a big Northern California bush at some point in my life, but not where I am now. And it sounds
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.920]  like, you know, probably the sea of green would be the way to go with the haze, just a whole bunch
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:46.240]  of single cola. Yeah, for started early. And yeah. I mean, it's funny, because Tom Hill lives like,
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:53.840]  you know, really close to here, but he lives where it's just a little and I used to, I used to have
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:01.280]  stuff next to where he's at. And you can definitely get away with more. It's weird.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:10.640]  It's just like just out of the fog. It's just like a little bit more arid and catches a little
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:16.400]  bit of the thermals in the late fall where the valley air comes up and it keeps it from freezing
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.880]  a little longer. Once it gets cold, it gets much colder. But in the in between time, like I'll get
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:29.200]  the frost here first. It'll be much worse. So I've just always been told you can't grow that shit
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:37.040]  here. And I've never tried to grow like I've never tried to grow pure haze. I didn't ever. I didn't
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.760]  ever have it because I didn't ever bother to get it. I was like, I'm going to grow blue dream. I'll
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:47.840]  try that. I know it's fast, you know, stuff like that. But at this point now, I'm like, you know,
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.960]  I'm like, fuck it, I'm going to try it. And I'm going to I'm just I'm going to do like I'm going
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.360]  to depth small plants so that I can at least have jars of haze around, you know, and I mean, I have
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.520]  northern lights. I can grow that here, but it still doesn't do good here. The northern lights
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.360]  haze goes a little bit too long and it kind of just falls apart. It's like really hard to finish
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:16.480]  here unless you get it. OK, yeah, it's protected, protected from the elements. Let's see here.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:23.360]  Just looking at chat, some good comments in here. Coca-Cola times Animal West.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:31.840]  Was that something that you were involved with? Yeah, so basically the Coca-Cola was a name I
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:42.800]  slapped on a keeper that I had out of the root beer back cross to. So it's basically like
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:52.240]  a really amazing jar or root beer. It's that stuff. It had a lot. It was a lot more visibly
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:47:02.400]  resonant, so it looks better in the bag. Animal West was I took the brother of the Cherry West
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:08.240]  clone that I keep, the Cherry West clone that I keep has a real candelabra. It comes the smell
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:16.800]  comes from the candelabra weed. The mail that I used was like the rest of the plants in the
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:24.640]  population, which were way more like sweet cherry pie type stuff. And so Animal West is animal
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.440]  cookies cross Cherry West, but it's not the Cherry West people would think of when they know the
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:35.200]  female because it because the brother I use is nothing like the sister. That's the keeper cut,
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:43.840]  which is a really rare throw in there. And so it's it's. It's, you know, animal cookies,
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.800]  Cherry West, and then I bred that forward and those are really nice. I still the different
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.880]  lines that I've tried. The stability isn't where I want them for debt. They do good for some people
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.040]  indoor and then for other people they don't do good. So it's one of those ones. It's like I just
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:05.840]  don't I don't drop it. It's it'd be killer for outdoor. It looks like beautiful weed. I don't
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:12.560]  want to say it looks like indoor because indoor it looks like space weed, but outdoor it looks
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.640]  like a lot of weed looks indoor. It's really good. You know, I put up some pictures of how it's
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:28.400]  beautiful. And and so I put it on that one. So it's basically it's a root beer cookies I had made
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:38.000]  at one point. Animal crossed with a root beer back cross one male, I think, and that just was
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.880]  like a flop on stability. It just was they were way too herby. I never got to do anything with
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:49.920]  them. And so I was like, OK, well, the more worked this more work thing, it's more stable for sure
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:57.360]  than the initial crosses. So I'm going to go ahead and try it out. So I went ahead and did it. And
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:03.520]  for me in my debt, which was ultra stressful on purpose, they weren't as stable as I would want
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:12.240]  for like a real big release. But for anybody who got their hands on the few that I that I let out,
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:18.960]  like they're really good. They're like right in between root beer and cookies on smell and on
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:26.080]  look. So they have like really pretty color, but they're chunkier than cookies, but they're heavier
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:32.800]  than root beer. And they're nice. They're like you guy. They could wash. They're like they could
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:39.440]  make hash. They're really good. I don't I think probably only probably there's probably only a
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.800]  couple of those packs that are ever out, maybe only two or three. So it's not like it's something
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:54.080]  that I put out and then people really have it. But I loved it. I got this year. I think I had maybe
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:02.560]  only nine or 10 females when I tried them. And then two of them were just gorgeous and they
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:09.040]  looked like clones. It looked like it was the same. And because they're both pretty worked lines I put
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:16.320]  together. So they're not like definition, true F1 hybrid. They're way more closely approaching
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:24.720]  that definition than most seeds that you'll ever grow. So they were really like kind of one thing
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:30.880]  and and beautiful, great, great plants. I mean, outdoor, they would smash. They'd be like,
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.320]  you'd want to pack a garden full of them for outdoor for sure. And I probably would have
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:43.200]  dropped some for outdoor. But I didn't get to grow any of them outdoor. And I just kind of,
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.680]  I don't know, I might still put some of them out. I have a bunch of them.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.600]  They're definitely stable enough that they do good outdoor. In my depth, it was like,
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:57.360]  on those plants that had intersex, it was like there was like, two male flowers on the whole
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:03.120]  plant. So it's just like, no, that's, it's bad enough that for me, I'm like, that's not something
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:11.280]  to release. But it's better than what a lot of people release coming from all these lineage and
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:17.360]  stuff, you know, true, true, true that if you get a really good plant out of your pack that you can
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:22.480]  clone, that's killer. That's how it was, you know, it was like, whatever, two packs of over something.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:28.400]  And there was two that were fully stable in the worst of environments, there probably would have
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.840]  been another, I don't know, maybe all of them would have been fine, like indoor, or whatever.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:38.960]  But just in the depth, you know, I have the depth, I leave the pinholes and shit in the tarps.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.040]  I close them at like five today, and I close them at seven tomorrow.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.080]  Wow.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.440]  I leave them closed in the morning till 10. And you open it up and the steam comes billowing
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:56.400]  out of the tarps and shit. And I'm like, well, whatever does good in there. But you know,
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:01.440]  that's, that's, you know, and they're one gallon pots, and they're six feet tall, and
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.800]  the bottoms aren't cleaned out. And, you know, like, if I cleaned up the plants, like a real
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:11.040]  grower, then I would have never noticed that there was one or two male flowers on them.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:11.840]  Exactly.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:20.240]  So they were definitely really good plants. It just, you know, I don't know. I'll see what,
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:26.320]  what, you know, I'll probably give them to more people to try them indoor and see if they like,
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:30.720]  if they like it indoor. And then, you know, maybe just tell people that they're,
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:36.480]  they're rough around the edges or whatever. Maybe not do anything, maybe try taking the same mom
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:43.040]  and use a male out of a animal Westline once I find a line that's more stable itself.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:43.920]  Okay.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:50.000]  And, and remake the same thing. It's definitely a worthwhile combination. And that's sometimes
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.640]  what happens when you try things you go, okay, well, I can see all the desirable traits
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:00.720]  lined up to make something that was really good. But there's this one undesirable trait that
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:07.360]  carried through from the one side. So that means I need to clean up one side and then I'll come
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.920]  back and try it again when I have that. And then I'll get something perfect. It's always like,
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:16.400]  it's like I said earlier, you try to do everything perfectly the way you would want to do it. And
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:22.160]  then maybe you're like, yeah, it's not really my dream to make this cross be perfect. So maybe I'll
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:27.760]  just give them to the people who really want them knowing that there's something fucked up and not
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.360]  do it as like a big broad release so that the only people who get them know what's up with them
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:40.560]  or whatever, you know, I'll figure it out. But they're definitely I'd consider as far as beyond
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:45.920]  the little bit of intersex, like the cross was like an elite cross. It was amazing. It just,
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:53.200]  you know, but the people who grew them had no problems. Only I had problems. And like I said,
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.880]  you know, it wasn't like I was treating them nicely or nothing.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.320]  Right. Fuck no, that's the torture chamber. But that's good. And then, you know, too,
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.560]  if anybody's going to have a pack out there, Dave's going to be one of those two or three people. So
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.360]  well, yeah, let us know, Dave.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.040]  Remember, I don't know that there's even that there's even any other ones out there. You might
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:14.160]  have the only pack.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:20.240]  Ah, the well, here's the thing. These I was there the night that you released them at that charity
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.480]  auction maybe two years ago. Yeah. And who you gave them to. I happen to be friend and he hooked
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:31.840]  me up with some. Oh, because it was some funk who got it. Yeah. Some funk is the one who got it.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.120]  Process. And I see the Harley Sue cross in there, too, which is awesome for me, because that
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:44.800]  presumably is going to be a CBD rich strain that you use there. I had a question. Yeah.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.480]  And we're actually I mean, we're getting close to the two hour mark here. And I super
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.720]  duper appreciate your time. I definitely had one question I want to ask you, too, though. So
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:59.920]  the closest I have in flower right now, I have some of the seeds here and we didn't really get
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:07.040]  into seeds tonight. That is frickin perfectly fine. Is this is a derivative is from the ranch,
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.520]  the purple pineapple. But it has the pina. It's a pina F4 in there with a purple
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:20.640]  urkel, which we've talked a little bit about tonight. But with the pina is is there any like
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.640]  CBD in there or is there more to the cannabinoid profile than THC? Is that something that you've
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:34.160]  looked at or am I they a lot of them in that particular breeding are CBD dominant. And so
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:40.480]  in those crosses, the purple stems, which, you know, I mean.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.640]  People will tell you like that it's only like that because of the deficiency.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:58.400]  And I can agree that you do see it triggered by deficiency, but you can grow
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:06.800]  a whole lot of different things all side by side with it or grape soda skunk or anything
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:15.440]  with this particular dirt perp in the heritage. And they'll all go pale and turn yellow, yellow,
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.600]  yellow, yellow all the way till the stems turn white when they're really starving.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.680]  And these things will just get purple, purple, purple, purple. So it's like you can say,
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:31.760]  yeah, it's somebody people will say, well, is it genetic? Is it a deficiency? Well, it's both.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:38.640]  The more deficient they get, the purpler they get. That's not normal. All we doesn't just not
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:44.720]  have enough phosphorus and start all of a sudden getting solid purple, dark black stocks, you know,
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:53.600]  so you can use that to track the CBD content as far as I've seen. I haven't been able to do like,
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.960]  I'm not like Cornell University or something going, okay, we're going to test a thousand.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:04.800]  We're going to do. But basically I've never seen the purple stem without the CBD in any of my
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:10.960]  crosses. When you see the purple stem that comes from the dirt perp, as far as I can tell, there is
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:18.160]  a link between there. They seem to be basically passing on the same chromosome or whatever. It's
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:25.600]  like they're together. So when you see things that come from that release that I did that had
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:34.640]  the purple stems, those were the F4s. I believe those were F4s when I released them. And before
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:43.680]  that I released some F3s. The F3s were more open. So the F4 were that I released were purple stem
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:50.720]  crossed with purple stem. And when you cross those together the right way in a inbreeding,
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:58:01.600]  then it winds up becoming true breeding. And so in that case, they all carry CBD, but to a different
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:07.840]  extent versus when you have the F3s and some have the purple stem. When you see the purple stem in
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:13.600]  the F3, you go, okay, CBD in there. And you see the green stem and there could be some CBD in
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:20.480]  there. But a lot of times those ones are the high THC ones. And I've seen from Pena over the years,
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:28.160]  a lot of totals that approach like 30%. And almost all of them where it's like 20%. So you'll have
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:35.440]  like a 10 and 10, or you'll have a 14, 16, or you'll have, I mean, just whatever combination
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:42.880]  of two numbers that add up to 20 or 30, but they slide all around in there. But on purple stems,
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:49.360]  it doesn't usually slide further to the THC side. It usually goes somewhere in one to one,
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:56.880]  then down to being CBD dominant all the way to the point where you don't have a lot. And then
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:03.280]  in that, that sometimes happens in the green ones. It's not that only the purple ones have CBD,
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:10.240]  but the green ones, CBD, THC, you never know. But with the purple stem ones, it seems that you
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:21.760]  don't ever really get a THC dominant purple stem plant. So that's what's real common with those is
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:26.880]  for there to be a lot of CBD in there. And that's the same, like the Nubia plant that only a few
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:32.320]  people have kind of seen. That was one from, at this point, it's from quite a while ago, but
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:39.760]  it gets the purple stems real easy like that. And it also, it has the high CBD and can reach those
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:47.440]  totals up around 30%. And the common denominator is that they all have that old thing, the Dirt
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:51.440]  Perp, which I got from my buddy, which was like, when I was talking about the one, two, three, and
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:57.040]  four, that was like the number one or the number two, you know, that I got in like 94 or something.
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:03.280]  And those are like the first weed, first weed that I grew. And the guy who bred that for a while,
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:08.320]  the Perp side of it, not the Dirt, because the Dirt was like THC weed, but it's a Dirt and Perp,
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:14.560]  these two things. And the Perp side, our buddy who had it after a while, he started going, it's the
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:21.360]  most resonance weed that I've ever had. But he goes, I swear, I don't get very high from it.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:26.080]  Don't understand. And we were like, well, maybe it's CBD, because we had read about that in
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.280]  Marijuana Botany, and we knew you're supposed to breed away from that, or it'll turn into
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:37.600]  being no stone. You want the THC content, or you want to mix. And so we knew about it, but it was
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:45.840]  still always kind of mysterious, because we couldn't test. But it seems to basically be a
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:54.320]  dominant CBD trait, because like no matter what you do, as you see that thing pop up, it's like,
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:01.440]  and his were all Purple Stem the same way, you know. So it's an interesting thing.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:06.960]  Smells are really consistent, and they tend to be really resistant against powdery mildew.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  They tend to be resistant against being snappy. They're very like, you know, they're real rubbery
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:21.520]  plants. They're good for tying down and training, scrogging or whatever. In certain environments,
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:30.240]  I've seen some intersects for different people from stuff from the pina, but it's one of those
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:38.080]  ones where it's like, I don't know what it is that causes it, because you can grow big
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.360]  populations of them in really bad environments, and they'll do really good. And then somebody
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:48.480]  will like, you know, I think probably it comes down to, they don't really like water. So I think
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.880]  kind of overwatering is the big trigger with the pina. So anybody who's grown pina, you really
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:02:00.000]  want to know that. Like really take it easy on the water. If you're able to, give it a lighter soil
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.400]  mix as far as more air, you know, add a little extra pumice or whatever you use to fluff your
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:14.320]  soil. And, you know, don't waterlog them, because that's what they seem to hate. And that's because
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:21.120]  they come from old gorilla stuff where people only watered enough to keep them alive, you know.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:22.160]  Wow.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:25.840]  So it's the ones that performed under low water conditions, not high water conditions.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:33.120]  It's amazing how plants can have that genetic retention or memory for those type of conditions.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.320]  Yeah. They're just, they were, you know, somebody you go through and you go, okay,
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:43.280]  which plant did the best? And then you keep the seed from that. And unknowingly you're
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.080]  selecting for plants that wanted to have not much water, because you were growing with not much
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:53.200]  water. Just trippy thing with breeding, which is why open pollinations are so cool, because
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:03:00.720]  sometimes you discover that what plant you like, sometimes you grow a plant and it gets yellow
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:09.040]  really fast and deficient and you go, and it's the smallest and you go, oh, this plant, this thing,
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:13.280]  this thing doesn't like to grow. It just doesn't want to be a yielder. So you're going to say,
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.760]  I don't really like it. It doesn't, you know, but it turns out that that's actually the one
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.560]  that's the most receptive to being pushed. So if you're in a situation where you can give plants
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:30.400]  a lot of food or you have really rich soil, then when you grow that, that's actually the biggest
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.600]  plant. That's the biggest producer. It's just the first one to get hungry. So because of the first
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:41.040]  one to get hungry, you look at it and you go, oh, it's little, it's deficient. It's like, no,
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.480]  if you give it food, the reality is that it's metabolism is actually twice as fast as the other
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:51.600]  ones. And these other ones that seem like these really high performance plants, they actually
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.440]  don't want much food and water. And so they're, they're going, they're kicking ass under those
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:03.200]  conditions. But this one over here that looks like it's totally slowed down and, and just kind of
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.480]  limping along. It's like, all you had to do was throw one little handful of some kind of dry
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:13.280]  fertilizer on top of it. It turns out that one would have been twice as big as all the other
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:19.920]  plants. So you, you really got to learn about what they want over, over time. And then, you know,
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.600]  that one, you might not seed that one because it's the little one. And you struggle with your,
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.880]  with your lines going, I really wish I had one of these that would be a yielder, but they either
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.760]  look like these green ones over here that don't yield that much. Or they look like those yellow
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.720]  ones over there that suck and won't grow and only get half as big as the green ones. And it's like,
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:45.040]  no, the yellow ones, those are the big plants, but you ain't feeding them. And that's what happens
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.240]  when people grow clones too. They get a clone and they go, this clone sucks compared to that clone.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:56.160]  And you're like, yeah, well, actually that clone didn't want light. And this clone did want light
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:01.760]  and you got them in the wrong place. Whereas you're sitting, these ones over here would be way
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:05.920]  better under this kind of light. And you have them under that kind of light, or, you know, you're
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.000]  growing them outdoor and you're growing them in the full sun and in the shade, they would have
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.160]  kicked ass, but you put them in the full sun and they fucking suck. And as you're doing your breeding
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:19.360]  and selections, you're getting rid of the other one. And you don't know that it was a high
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.720]  performance plant in a different scenario. So the open pollination makes sure that you leave room
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.080]  for people in the future to discover what you missed. But when you do everything exactly to
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:36.080]  your, it's like, it's great for your environment, but now you've, you've trapped it into being this
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:40.720]  thing that can only perform in this environment, you know? So, yeah.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:48.960]  Right. Fuck man. That's, you know, the key thing you said too, over time, like I have to at least
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:54.080]  run something three times before I'm like, and this is kind of my own curse because I can't do
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:59.120]  a whole big, you know, field, but you know, I got to run things three times before it's like, you
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:06.160]  know, pump it or dump it. And that, that eats up a lot of time, but it is, it's important over time
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:11.040]  because hopefully within those three sessions, I can figure out those little nuances of like,
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:17.120]  did it, does it like wet feet? You know, how much light does it want? Where does it do best in the
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:23.200]  tent or wherever I'm growing? So yeah. For sure. Yeah. And then maybe you talk to somebody and
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:31.200]  they go, Oh, have you tried feeding it really light? Or have you tried lightening up the dirt
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:36.640]  or have you tried get, you know, putting way more stuff in initially into the soil? And then like,
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:41.200]  sometimes that was like when we grew the Hindu back in the day, everybody that was in the days
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:46.800]  when, you know, now people, people are pretty, it's easy for people to get good yields indoor,
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.680]  but people were still trying to figure out a lot of stuff and you, you try and you plant,
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:55.600]  everything's different. People were growing Hindu and they were just struggling to get,
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:01.440]  try to get a pound of light, which was kind of a pound off of a thousand. And then when people
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.480]  improved a little, then it was like, I want to get over a pound, like a pound and a quarter off
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:13.200]  of 600 or something. And off thousands, I want to get two or two and a half pounds or whatever.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:19.840]  And like, but people were struggling to get a pound off of Hindu. And they were like,
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:24.560]  what the fuck you just, this stuff, it's like such good weed. I get this killer weed,
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:29.360]  but I can't get a pound of light. And it's killing me because I got to grow something
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:34.080]  different. But people want this Hindu right now. It's worth a lot of money and it goes right away.
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:39.120]  Sell it as soon as it's trimmed, you know? And so people really wanted to figure it out. And then
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:44.960]  our buddy one day, he goes, oh, I've just been putting it in power flower. And then I don't feed
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:50.720]  it. And power flower was this dirt from this place up in Trinity County. And it came from
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:55.920]  this bog. And then they would take this old California Pete, which was not Pete Moss,
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:02.720]  but it was Pete. It was like compost from this bog. And they would, they would take it and they
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:08.480]  would add a good little charge of food to it. It had some bone meal and some gypsum and some other
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:14.640]  stuff. I don't remember what was in it, but it had a good little amount of food, but everybody
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:19.600]  always figured like planted in that that's good. It has food, but then it'll kind of eat up the big
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:25.120]  charge in the first little time, maybe in the badge. Then when flower comes, give it some good
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:29.520]  food, you know, that was just kind of standard. Like, and they would be like, just plant it in,
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:33.840]  just plant it in our dirt and you don't have to feed it. And we'd be like, yeah, fucking right.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.400]  And we'd grow things and you try it and you go, it works better when you feed it.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:44.640]  So you would grow in it and then you would, you would feed things and they would do way better
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:48.480]  when you fed them. And then you'd get your yields. The yields would be way better. And you're like,
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:54.640]  yeah, don't listen to these guys who say this is a, a full soil. This is not going to work.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.680]  You got to feed this shit, you know? But then my buddy goes, no, I planted in it. And then he goes,
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.240]  I tried the Hindu, just like old schools, power flower style. I just left it in there.
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:08.160]  I didn't feed it. And he's like, dude, everything. He's like, look at the weed. And the buds are like
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.640]  way chunkier in the bag. He's like, yeah, I'm getting, he's like, I'm getting, you know,
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:17.440]  way over a pound every time, you know? And we're like, damn with Hindu. And he's like, yeah,
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.240]  you know? And we're like, shit. Okay. So people started trying it and like in other dirt and just
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:27.920]  being like, just barely feed it. And then all of a sudden everybody started getting fat buds and
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.680]  was like, Oh, this plant doesn't like a lot of food when it gets a lot of food and it just gets,
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.640]  it just grows leaves instead of buds. So then as soon as, as soon as people realized that we're
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:44.640]  like, okay, so back way off. And then we learned also that when you put it in the sun, you get
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.400]  little buds. And when you put it in the shade, you get big buds, which didn't make sense. Cause
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.320]  that was the opposite of everything we'd always seen with all the other stuff, you know?
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:58.480]  So counterintuitive, you know, again, that's, that's another thing I love,
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.320]  you know, the gardening and music, they, they mirror themselves in many ways, but
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.320]  we're never going to know it all because there is, there is no one right answer for everything.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:15.920]  Yeah. So I love that. Yeah. Dave, I know you've been quiet, buddy.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:20.320]  And I know you've got some questions though. I know you've probably got some good questions.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.080]  I've got one for you if you don't have one off the top of your head, but shoot,
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:30.160]  you're, you're, is it the cherry limeade that you just absolutely rave about Dave?
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.680]  Well, it was the gelato 33 cherry limeade, but the cherry limeade is wonderful on its own,
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:42.080]  right there. There's a mix with the pina. Yes. Okay. But I was maybe hoping we could
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.640]  get a little bit of a story on that one. Cause Dave, the, the collector of collectors,
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.520]  every episode and probably one of the first ones too. I'm like, okay, so what out of the collection
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.360]  is just the all star of all stars. And I've asked him this a few times and he's gone to the same
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:04.800]  thing every time. I, yeah, I just love that. I love that the, the way that gelato 33 cherry
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.080]  limeade male seems to just work so well, given some, some of that sweetness and some, some lime,
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.040]  a little bit of a little, not gas, but there's just that lime flavor in there that really comes
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.600]  through that I love. It worked really well with the runs. That was one of them that I had gotten
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:26.080]  that were great combination. And one that, one that surprised me too, because it was
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.720]  certainly not the best looking one in the grow kind of like let it off to the side. And then
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.240]  it just turned it around at the end. It ended up being my favorite of that round.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:45.360]  Yeah. The, the, the 33 is, is a cool one because it actually has like a lot of character to the high,
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:54.400]  like you get used to, if you've seen a lot of different a lot of different of like the gelato
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:12:00.000]  things that people have. And I think sometimes it's the way it's like grown and dried to maybe
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.480]  doles it out. So it maybe gives a bad impression of the genetics, but it actually, the, the gelato
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:15.920]  33, it actually like has like a really, a really good high. We went, my buddy, Jesse bio vortex,
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.120]  they, they, him and his buddies, they just made a movie. It's super cool. It's called
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.120]  tending the garden and it's not out yet, but we went up to like a pre,
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:37.200]  a pre-release screening up in Arcata. And I was with a bamboo and a couple other people. And
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.880]  somebody goes, Oh, who's got a joint. And I'm like, Oh, fuck my weeds in the car. You know?
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:47.360]  I go, Oh shit, dude from saber tooth farms. He just gave me a joint when we're at, when we're
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:52.240]  eating dinner. I was like, fuck, I had a joint in my pocket just by luck, you know?
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.520]  So I pulled it out and sparked it up and we start smoking it. Like after a while, like,
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.080]  you know, bamboo comes up to me and he goes, what the fuck did we smoke? And I go, Oh,
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:10.960]  it was a gelato 41 cross 33 cherry limeade. And he goes, what? I go, yeah. And he goes,
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.960]  fuck, what a high. Like he goes, dude, everything's so bright and just like,
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:20.960]  fucking like, I'm like, there's just so like this great fucking high. And I'm all, yeah,
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.920]  dude, I go, I know it's weird. It's the, the, the 33 actually has a lot to it like that. And
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:31.600]  it brings that to it. And you know, the, the cherry, the lime by itself is kind of like that,
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  but the cherry limeade tends to be a little bit more dull and not dull in a bad way,
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.720]  but dull in a sense of like, it's nighttime weed. Because if you smoke it in the day,
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:46.560]  like if you smoke it on a hot day, all of a sudden it's like 10 degrees hotter.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:50.400]  And you're like, I shouldn't have smoked this shit in the daytime. Like it just fucking kind of,
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:56.240]  hits you where you're like, oh shit. Okay. And not that it like has insane potency or anything,
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.960]  but it's more potent than most of the typical, like, to me, it's way more potent than like
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.680]  Urkel and granddaddy and stuff like that, which I don't consider to be super potent. Some people
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:09.120]  say I'll put in there. I'm like, I don't know that they don't see that as belonging to me, but
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:16.400]  the, the cherry limeade it's like really potent for that kind of a profile. And then with the
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.120]  gelato 33, it really did come through with a lot of cool highs. And it's not every single plant,
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:28.400]  but a lot of them did really good. But the, the, the, the cherry limeade itself is, is my buddy,
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:37.760]  my buddy, Mike Meesey, he gave me three seeds to plant for him while he was staying with me.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:41.840]  And I was letting him do a section of the, of the, of my medical garden. I was like,
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:47.840]  you can do your six plants over here, you know, and, and it'll be fun, you know,
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:53.600]  have a garden out there and stuff. And so he's got the six plants and then he gives me these seeds
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:02.560]  and he winds up moving. He moved back down to the Bay and, and I got three seeds. I got two of them
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:09.920]  to come up and out of the two that came up, one of them was like a really, really impressive kind of
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.680]  what I looked at and thought of as a granddaddy plant or a herkel plant, but different. And the
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.560]  other one was like a big tall plant that looked like, like a more like a big, like a big, like a
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:29.520]  Durban or something like that. Like a Hayes Durban, it was rock hard bud and it was really frosty,
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.880]  but it smelled like things I associate with, like with like Durban or super silver Hayes or
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:42.400]  something, kind of like, like a rosemary with a little, little bit of like, I don't know,
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.840]  other stuff to it, but really trippy. And, and it was killer. But the one that I, the one that I
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:53.440]  really liked was the little one that was just like, when it dried, the sweetness was crazy.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:58.080]  Like you'd smoke it and it would, the weed would just taste really sweet and fruity, like fruit
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:04.560]  punch or something. And it was from cherry pie, but the cherry pie to me wasn't one that like
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:09.760]  grabbed my attention. It was a little more, smells to me more kind of like it's fruity,
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:17.680]  but it had a little bit more like a petroleum tainted, like this kind of dark, deep taste to it.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:22.640]  Clone only cherry pie. I didn't really ever like it. I never wanted to do anything with it,
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:28.480]  but this one that I kept was really crazy. It smelled like, really like lime peel, rose oil,
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:35.840]  skunk, granddaddy, just killer, like really, really nice, exotic, crazy weed. It would skunk
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:41.040]  the fuck out of a room. Like I brought my buddy some at his birthday at a restaurant,
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  you'd just smell it everywhere. And it was like this much weed in my pocket, you know,
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:54.640]  it was so funky. And, and I hit it with the brother of Lime One, the year that I popped Lime One.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:06.160]  So this was 2010. And so I only got a few seeds out of it. I got like maybe 10 seeds or something
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:13.360]  and I grew them. What did I get? No, I had less than that. The cherry limeade I only had,
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:21.980]  trying to remember if I had any more left back. I think I planted them all and I only got
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:30.860]  five females and one male. So I was in my big, big garden. And so I had, I had the cherry limeade
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:39.260]  and then I got the, I got the one out of the five females that I really liked. I seeded them all,
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:44.540]  I shared the seeds with people and stuff. But the one that I really liked was just like way out there.
[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:51.020]  So good, such a good combination of the lime and the cherry. It had like way more resin than the
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:56.860]  cherry clone and the weed was really like dense and tight and it took on the really good combination
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:18:01.980]  of both sides. And so that's what I used. That's what I went for with the cherry limeade. And then
[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:11.180]  I crossed that with a Gelato 33 and a few other things the year that I made that cross.
[02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:18.220]  And then the next year when I grew them, I was looking at all these different things I had popped
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:22.700]  in five inch pots. And I'm all like, you know, boom, there's all these little groups, you know,
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:27.580]  and they're grown up and you can't just see the tags. You got to look at each group to see what
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:31.900]  the tag is down there. And they're like, there's these ones that I'm like, what are these big,
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:38.380]  pretty tall plants? And I'm never guessing because cherry limeade's more squat and Gelato's not the
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:44.860]  fastest thing. And I'm looking and I'm like, holy shit, that's those Gelato cherry limeades. And I
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:50.220]  kind of just done them because they were distantly related and closely related in a sense. And I was
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:55.900]  like, all right, well, they could be cool. But I didn't really like, it was kind of just like a
[02:18:55.900 --> 02:19:02.300]  whatever kind of cross. And then they just grew so good. And then I wound up planting them and
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:05.740]  budding them out maybe in like five gallon pots. And they were like as tall as me.
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:11.340]  And they were all nice. They were like, they were like way heavier than cherry limeade.
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:17.900]  They were denser. They got more color. They were a lot darker. They were all really nice. There was
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:22.460]  like nice smells to them. And then it turned out they were really good weed. So I was like, well,
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:27.260]  shit, I want to take a male out of this and put it on a bunch of different like, you know, purples.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:33.660]  And because this is like a really high performance purple type. When I say purple, I don't mean like
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:42.460]  the color. I mean like Urkel derivative. And they were just they were super fucking killer. So
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:50.140]  some of them I did, I did like T1000. And those were like only done for charity. I did Purple
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:56.220]  Unicorn. And those were only done for charity. And then I released a few other things. I did
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:20:02.220]  the Runts Cross. And those ones were a couple were released for charity initially. And then I decided
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:11.180]  to do them as they wound up being done as freebies a little bit here and there. Yep, I did the Bipop
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:17.580]  Black Dog, Bat Cross 5 from Bio Vortex. And I had three girls of those. And they all came out really
[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:22.700]  good. The number three was the first one to be tested indoor. Those are killer. Those are great
[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:27.900]  plants. People love those. But everything that came from it's really nice. And I kept the male.
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:35.020]  I have it and it's a really nice. It's just it's a cool plant. And I don't know necessarily that
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:44.140]  like maybe I could find even a better one out of the original population. I F2ed them. And then
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:53.980]  I tried out. Oh, that one was one of the best ones. The Piscine. That one came out amazing.
[02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:59.580]  The best one out of that, the 27, the best one out of what Skunk Tech popped. I can't remember how many
[02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:08.780]  girls he had. But the number 27 plant was just like really, really good. I mean, I grew it outdoor and
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:14.140]  I had all these plants. And my mom came over to look at my garden this year. And she was like,
[02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:21.020]  whoa, what is this? And I was like, that's the Ice Cream 27. And she was like, oh, man, it's just so
[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:25.980]  pretty. And I was like, smell it. And then you smell it. You're like, oh, it's really nice. It
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:32.060]  reminds me of like back in the day, like if like in the health food stores, they'd sell like cartons
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:39.180]  of kefir, like raspberry kefir. It kind of smells like that or like the mamba candies that are like
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:45.260]  any Starburst candies like the high cheese. Yeah, it's got a high chewy kind of thing to it, but
[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:49.980]  it's like creamy. And then when you smoke it, like I don't know if it's for everybody, but when I
[02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:57.180]  smoke it, like it gets me like fucking high. I get really stoned off of it. It's a really,
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.020]  really super cool plant. And then out of all of them, like there was a ton of them
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:08.300]  that were really good. And the cool thing about so the Bubba and the Bubba Cush Cross there and
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:13.660]  the Pie Screen were the ones that were like bulletproof on stability. So those ones like
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:19.820]  you could grow as many of them as you want under whatever circumstances and you will never get
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:25.660]  any intersex in them. And honestly, coming out of cherry limeade and gelato, that's not like
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:33.100]  calm. The white came out really good to those plants. There was indoor. There was a couple
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:39.020]  that had really mild intersex on them. No seeds, but a couple of male flowers. I don't know if
[02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:43.820]  they're just sterile pollen on them. That's how a lot of the cherry limeades were. They had sterile
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:51.660]  pollen. So I would be like, oh shit. And it's weird because like in the F1, the pollen wasn't
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:59.100]  sterile. But by the time I got by the time I inbred them, then when there was any intersex
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:07.500]  in them, which I only have one plant out of 30 or so, I think in the F5 in my big garden, 2017,
[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:16.380]  I think, it wouldn't make any seed. So I'm not sure if that's the case with those or what, but
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:23.900]  the whites outside are so cool as a big full-term plant because the white is that classic, like what
[02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:32.620]  I consider like a Northern Lights type plant or that kind of, they're like the best of Amsterdam.
[02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:39.900]  They're these big, the plant likes to get like big branches with big buds that are hard buds that are
[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:47.260]  covered in resin. It's plain for my taste, but very close to my old Northern Lights, which was
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:55.100]  also plain for my taste. But I love those kind of plants. So crossed with the gelato cherry limeade,
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:00.780]  those ones actually wound up being really cool. And what's funny about the gelato cherry limeade
[02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:08.860]  is everybody sees it and I don't know if people realize, but I use the F5 cherry limeade, I'm
[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:15.340]  pretty sure on those. And I didn't really ever put anything out with the cherry limeade on it.
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:22.700]  And it was like when initially when it won the Emerald Cup and it had that, some of them get
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:27.660]  like 6% terpenes and it's like really crazy awesome weed. I didn't really put out anything
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:36.460]  with it before. And those crosses are like when you grow them, like you grow like the
[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:43.100]  pie scream, it was like, well, here's a rock hard cherry limeade basically, but it's fully
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:51.580]  sexually stable. And so the pie scream was one that people really got, there was some
[02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:57.740]  excitement about that. And then, but like I put out like that, like I said, like that, that gelato
[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:05.980]  41, the white, those different ones. And they're kind of, they're like a little bit slept on
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:13.420]  because they just sound like some bullshit gelato, whatever, everybody's got a gelato.
[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:23.260]  But like I used the F5 cherry limeade, which was super crazy on the gelato and the gelato 33 high
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:31.580]  carried through. So in those populations, there's plants that are like really fucking good. So,
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.420]  you know, at this point I have tons of other tested releases and stuff, but
[02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:41.660]  so I don't, you know, I'm not really worried, but like they're one of those ones where it was like,
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:45.580]  I had enough seed that I could have dropped quite a few of those. There wasn't that much
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:53.100]  interest in them really. But if people see them, I recommend trying them because like the ones that
[02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:59.980]  are labeled for outdoor are really, really great outdoor plants with a lot of resistance and they're
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:05.020]  sturdy and nice, you know, not every single plant, but there's a lot of good ones in there. And then
[02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:11.660]  like the Bubba Cross and the Pie Scream, I made more Pie Scream because I was like,
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:16.380]  that's so good. I need more that I can look through and I'm probably going to release
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:23.980]  more of those too. But those, they were kind of the ones where I'm not shocked that people
[02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:29.900]  perceive them as just being some more like fucking whatever modern contemporary bullshit
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:34.780]  purple frosty weed that's not that great. Because when I made them, I kind of thought maybe that's
[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:38.780]  how they would be. And then I was like, oh, I actually want to do something with these because
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:45.740]  they're good, you know. But they're probably like, maybe I'll do more stuff with them in the future,
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:50.700]  but just the way everyone else feels like there's too much gelato stuff, I kind of feel like there's
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:55.820]  too much gelato stuff. I probably will focus on my core stuff, like I was saying, more than
[02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:03.500]  going on these offshoots of stuff other people are already doing stuff with. But I still like
[02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:07.740]  highly recommend them. The reason I released them was because initially when I made them,
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:13.180]  I gave them to people to grow them outdoor in their full terms. And I gave people a bunch of
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:18.460]  different stuff and cool stuff, you know, give them this, give them that. And then I had people
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:23.180]  come back to me who are like my close friends and family. And I was like, which ones were
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:30.380]  really good, you know? And like, it was like, you know, oh, I love the black dog one. I love
[02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:34.780]  the white. I love the, you know, they were purple, they were frosty, but they were like,
[02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:39.340]  the smoke was better. And the people who got the weed wanted more, even though they thought they
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:43.660]  didn't want it at first. And, you know, they're those kind of real, they're nice plants. And
[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:50.220]  they're all like, you know, good mold resistance. And they're all pretty sturdy. And there's some
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:56.620]  gorgeous expressions in there of just like, you know, purple, fucking pretty weed, but it actually
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:02.700]  has some nuance and niceness to the smoke and stuff, you know? So.
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:07.980]  That's cool. Let me flip over. We've been getting some good questions here
[02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:18.060]  as we're going along to try to get them on track here. And there was two from Ingus.
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:24.860]  The first one, what is your male like in the Gelato 33 Cherry Limeade? Let's see if this time
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:30.860]  it says, is it a Cherry Limeade? Is the male tall or short? Since I found a shorter, stupid,
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:37.980]  stinky one, but also some tall ones. So the male is a more of a tall, upright plant. It's a little
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:43.900]  bit narrow. It does a thing where it, the Cherry Limeade, it comes from the Cherry Limeade.
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:48.140]  They'll like grow and grow and grow and bud and bud and bud. And you'll be like, there should be
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:53.260]  opening, but they're just not opening. And they'll just bud, bud, bud, bud, bud. And then one day,
[02:28:53.260 --> 02:29:03.260]  like almost all of them will just open all at once. And, you know, it has like nice clusters
[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:08.220]  where by the time it really buds, there's like not really any, there's like just a couple little
[02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:16.460]  narrow leaves sticking out of the big clusters. It really likes to bud. The branches are not like
[02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:23.020]  big and thick. They're a little more thin. It's kind of like my Cherry Pie plant with some lime
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:29.420]  influence, but it's more upright. Whereas my Cherry Pie plant grows sideways and zigzag like
[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:37.020]  a Urkel, but even more extreme than a Urkel. So if you see something that's like short and the
[02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:44.380]  branches grow sideways and they, and the branch kind of goes boom, boom, boom, boom. And every
[02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:49.260]  time it switches, there's a little, a little, another little bud or branch that pops out at
[02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:54.700]  those points. That's from the Cherry Pie side. And that's coming back from really from the Urkel
[02:29:54.700 --> 02:30:07.980]  and the granddaddy that's in that. And yeah, I mean, it's definitely like the short side of that
[02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:15.420]  cross is the cherry. The rest of everything in there isn't. But because of the way genetics
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:25.900]  rearrange, it doesn't mean that the Cherry Pie looking plant will get the Cherry Pie type weed.
[02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:36.220]  Although they do seem to be, the shorter stuff does seem to be the more sweeter cherry leaning
[02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:41.980]  stuff. It seems to be, so it seems to be linked, but I, you know, I wouldn't say to expect that
[02:30:41.980 --> 02:30:47.420]  every time just because things can shuffle however they want. So technically you can get a
[02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:54.620]  Cherry Pie plant with lime weed and a gelato high, or you could get a Cherry Pie plant with gelato
[02:30:54.620 --> 02:31:05.020]  weed and a cherry high. Like it could all be shuffled. But if I saw it and it smelled like
[02:31:05.020 --> 02:31:09.820]  really perfumey sweet, I would figure it's kind of a throwback to my cherry.
[02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:16.620]  If it's a little, little squat ones like that. That's what they're looking for. And does that
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:22.940]  count to just kind of stem rubs on the male? Did that have similar? It only counts in certain types
[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:30.780]  of plants. So if you try to breed with things with stem rub, just thinking that stem rubs count, like
[02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:42.300]  they don't count, but in cherry lime shit, they count. When I won the Emerald Cup, we, we planted
[02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:48.540]  the plant and me and my, me and my buddy Eddie planted the plant and we took it and it was a,
[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:55.740]  it was a veg plant, like waist high or chest high and like a seven gallon pot. And we took it and I
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:00.860]  like held it and had him pull the pot off of it. And I set it in the hole and I went to push the
[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:08.220]  dirt around and I looked around and I was like, dude, did you just light a joint? And he was like,
[02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:15.180]  no dude. And I was like, holy shit. I was like, dude, this, this fucking thing, I'm going to watch
[02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:19.340]  this thing. I think I'm probably going to enter this thing in the cup. I was like, I swear when
[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:24.780]  we ruffled it right now, dude, it fucking like, and I, and, and straight up like that plant,
[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:33.820]  that plant, I, I, I, I transplanted it and the veg, the veg smell, and there was a row, I think
[02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:39.100]  there was four plants in the row and that plant, when I transplanted it, I was like, dude, this one
[02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:43.420]  right here, I think I'm probably going to try to try to enter this thing just because it's got to
[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:48.860]  have so much funk on it. Like it's just crazy. And then we watched it and then when it finished,
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:53.580]  I was all, I think it's probably my favorite. I entered that one and I entered another one from
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:33:00.700]  the same row. And it was like, was that that year I did too? Maybe I'm wrong. One year I entered two
[02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:07.580]  and one was first and one was 10th or one was third and one was 10th or second, the Emerald
[02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:13.980]  cup. Like they, they did really good, but the plant smells and it's not random. It's not like,
[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:20.140]  Oh, this plant is super stinky, but then the bud doesn't stink. But there are families of plants
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:24.220]  like that where you smell it and you think it's going to be great. And the weed finishes and
[02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:30.540]  you're all this one sucks. And the one over there that smelled like nothing, it's gas. It's the
[02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:36.140]  shit. So you have to learn the families. But if you're dealing with any of these crosses that are
[02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:43.500]  gelato cherry limeade and you smell one and it's just ridiculously stinky and sweet and perfumey,
[02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:49.020]  that's how it is. Their initial, those cherries, when I popped them, died three seeds. One of them
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:55.980]  died of damp off early out. And of the other two, when they got this tall, I smelled them.
[02:33:55.980 --> 02:34:01.340]  And the one that I want that I still have now, whatever, 12 years later, when I smelled it, I
[02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:08.300]  went, Oh shit. I see people think this stuff's crazy. Like he brought me to seeds like, dude,
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:12.620]  the shit's called cherry pie. People in the Bay love it. You know? And I was all, Oh,
[02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:17.980]  I think I heard about it, but I don't know. And I was like, all right, fuck it. I'll plan them
[02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.220]  for you. And I planted them. And I was like, well, they must've been fucking, you know,
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:27.980]  like hermeseeds. Cause they're grown in a clone in a room full of clone weed. And they were both
[02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:34.220]  females. And I was like, Oh, this thing smells good. And that smell, you really can track it
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:42.140]  through. And, and that extreme terpene content, like they go up to, you know, fucking 6%. Like
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:48.780]  they're really, really heavy on terpenes. When you feel the plant, you'll feel the terpenes all
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:53.260]  over the plant and it's on your hands and you smell it. And it's like undeniable. It smells
[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:58.540]  like weed, you know? Like it doesn't even smell. I shouldn't say that it doesn't smell like weed.
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:03.740]  It smells like that weed smells finished, but that weed almost smells too exotic to be like,
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:09.180]  weed, you know? Right. Super, super cool. So those, so you, you can really look through
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:15.580]  those particular ones for stem rubs. Like I can look through for stem rubs, like on the root
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:23.100]  beard and Jaro stuff, um, for particular things, but I can't look for overall quality. I can just
[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:26.780]  look and go, Oh, this is going to be the one that's blue bowl. Cause it's the only one that
[02:35:26.780 --> 02:35:31.820]  ever stinks like this. Or I can go, this one's more like real root beer. Cause it doesn't smell
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:38.860]  that much, but it has this smell kind of like how a sour diesel mom smells where it's just like,
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:44.220]  it's hard for me to describe it. There's a certain smell. It's, it's weedy, but it reminds me of like,
[02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:50.140]  I don't know. It's like a kind of a deep smell. Like the way you know, how a tomato smell,
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:56.700]  a tomato plant smells when you touch it. It's not the same, but it's that type of a thing where it's
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:36:02.860]  like hard to really describe what does it smell like, but you kind of know when you smell it,
[02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:06.220]  but I couldn't tell you like to look for that. Cause you don't know what the fuck I'm talking
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:12.060]  about. Right. But I could tell you the blue bowl one either easier. Cause if you smell 20 of them
[02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:18.380]  and one of them is way sweeter and louder than all the rest of them, that's the only one like
[02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:24.780]  that in those populations. So like you, you can learn, you can learn it, but you can't just like
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:29.500]  buy a pack of seeds and smell the stems and go, I'm using this one. Cause it stems the stinkiest.
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:33.500]  Like you, it might be the worst fucking kind of weed in the whole line. You know,
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:39.580]  got to understand. Yeah. You got to understand why you're using it. And it actually only sounds
[02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:42.780]  like something that you have to, you have to kind of go through the line first. And then
[02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:47.420]  on the second time around, you're like, okay, then you can make the connections because unless you
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:52.060]  have a connection, even if you've started with the clone and you made the seed from the clone
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:56.540]  and you know what the clone smells like, and you can pick something out about the clone,
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:02.940]  that's very distinctive to you. Then when you grow things from in them, maybe you can smell
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:09.820]  the things in veg that smell just like the clone to you. And that might help, but you might discover
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:17.100]  that it's actually some of the things, some of the ones that smell the most like it on the plant.
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:22.220]  It doesn't translate to the bud, like the mom, like the mom has a correlation between
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:29.900]  the stem and the bud. But then when you plant the seeds from it, maybe you get one and if stem
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:35.340]  doesn't smell good, but then the weed is the most like the mom and the one that smells the most.
[02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:40.620]  So you have to see if there's like a locked in thing. It has to like, it's the same with anything.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:46.460]  You got to see if there's like a consistent correlation. Cause sometimes it might be this way
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:53.020]  on this plant, but they might not be stuck together. So it's like, you gotta, you do,
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:59.420]  you do have to learn. But like in the case of like the cherry, I was able to smell like right away,
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:04.220]  like that smells like what that, what the mom smelled like. And it worked once I discovered
[02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:08.860]  that it worked, I stuck with it, you know, but it could have not worked too. And then I went,
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:15.820]  okay, shit don't work. Strain dependent. And we got one, one root beer, root beer for president
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:20.060]  here. We got one vote for, for root beer already. We know, we know you're running
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:29.180]  the best candidate so far. Yes. And let's see, will freeborn do any CBG crosses or,
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:34.220]  you know, minor cannabinoids, is that anything that you've looked at or have material to,
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:44.140]  or desire to play with? I, I haven't really looked at it. I mean, with those kinds of things,
[02:38:44.780 --> 02:38:52.460]  I, it's just not how I work really. Like I don't, I don't go for things to have a certain
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:39:01.500]  drug content. Okay. If I find something that I really like, and it turns out that it has that,
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:07.660]  and it winds up going that direction, or I discover that like, that's, I really like the
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:13.260]  ones that are like that. And maybe I would lean it in that direction. But like,
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:23.340]  I don't really have a lot of ambition to make like, make like hemp, like CBG or to make CBD
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:30.700]  hemp or whatever, like grape soda, Scott, I've like coincidentally bred it to be all CBD.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:38.940]  And I would have kind of liked to have THC versions of it, but I don't think they ever existed.
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:47.180]  I think that type was always a CBD type. And, you know, I don't, I don't like mind that,
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:53.740]  because I can always smoke something else and get real high and still smoke a joint of that and have
[02:39:53.740 --> 02:40:00.220]  the great flavor that I want. And that's fine too, you know, mix it up there. And that's good. So it
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:04.220]  sounds like kind of just, you know, happy coincidence. You're not opposed to it, but
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:08.780]  you're not actively looking for it. Something strikes you the right way though. You're like,
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:14.860]  yeah, well, let's roll with it. I just don't really breed for like the, I agree. I don't breed
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:23.100]  for like agricultural goals. Okay. Like, but there's a lot of things that I've bred that
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:29.180]  could be really great for agriculture, but like an agriculturist has to figure that out.
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:35.580]  I mean, not that I couldn't tell, I mean, I could tell them too. I really don't, I'm not really a
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:44.380]  fan of weed in agriculture. I don't really think that weed, unless you're going to use it as,
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:50.700]  as like, I feel like maybe if you were going to use it for textiles or, or like things like,
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:57.020]  like industrial weed for industrial purposes, I don't really think you need to have like special
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:41:03.180]  weed for industrial purposes. It just doesn't, that doesn't sit that great with me. I'd rather
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:12.060]  see like special weed grown special as opposed to special weed grown by the field or the giant.
[02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:19.100]  You know, this doesn't, I don't think, I don't think you can really get to, you don't really
[02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:24.220]  get what you want anyway. Like you want that you're going to take these really good genetics
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:29.980]  and then just fucking grow a whole valley full of it. It's like, well, that's cool, but you don't,
[02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:33.340]  you're not even going to be able to tell it was that what it was in the first place.
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:38.620]  Anyway, kind of, I mean, I guess you could, but I don't know. It just seems weird to me.
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:43.500]  Yeah. And at the industrial scale, as soon as it becomes more cost-effective to grow the
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:48.380]  cannabinoid or whatever it is in yeast, they're, they're going to go that way. Cause I mean,
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:53.100]  really it's, they're, they're growing biomass to get these minor cannabinoids. And that biomass
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:57.740]  has a lot of handling and stuff that goes along with it and you don't even need that part. So.
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:03.180]  Yeah. And it's, you know, it'd be, it'd be different if they like, you can grow,
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:09.100]  you could grow all this weed and have it be done in a cool way where it wouldn't be super,
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:17.900]  super destructive. Like when people are like, Oh, just grow weed for paper and grow hemp for this
[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:21.340]  and grow it for that. And it's like, yeah, but if you're going to do it, you're going to have
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:27.100]  to do it a little different because it's really good at just like sucking everything out of the
[02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:33.580]  dirt. You're going to have to like, leave it there to compost. That's like traditional hemp.
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:39.340]  They, they take it and you can see the old pictures, they stack it up to ret. And then
[02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:47.020]  in the reading process, all of the, the, the stuff kind of comes off of it. And they only take,
[02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:52.300]  basically they wind up only really removing the fiber and everything else winds up still in the
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:56.940]  fields. Cause they all leave it all in the field. But in modern times, they tend to come through
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:01.660]  with whatever kind of big, I don't know what you would call them a combine or whatever, but they
[02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:06.940]  take, they come through with these machines and they remove it all. And then they come back in
[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:13.420]  and then they plant a bunch more. And it's like, you need to like build, you need to build up the
[02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:20.060]  soil when you're doing all this agriculture and you could do it in a way that would be great like
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:26.460]  that, but it's not like things aren't just necessarily a good crop. It's not just like
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:30.780]  hemp's going to save the world. It's like, well, yeah, if you fucking grow it sustainably,
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:35.660]  but not, but, but everything sucks if you just come in and, you know, I mean, there's nothing
[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:40.780]  wrong with anything. It's, you know, the, the, you know, they say, you know, the dose makes the poison
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.740]  and if you do things right, it's good. But yeah, it's just, I don't know, something about the big,
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:48.460]  the big operations, it doesn't seem to be.
[02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:53.740]  Monocropping. Yeah. Monocropping anything isn't a good idea, even if it's a plant we love just,
[02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:59.180]  you know, continuous monocropping without rotating your fields is not a good recipe
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:01.260]  to your point of building soil, you know.
[02:44:01.260 --> 02:44:07.180]  Yeah. Removing all the biomass and, you know, like it just not, I don't know, just funky.
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:12.380]  Yeah. Well, I don't know, Dave, if you're out there, if you're trying to get back in,
[02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:17.820]  definitely please try to jump back in. I don't know if that's because he is on the East coast
[02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:23.900]  and it's, it's almost one o'clock for him, but Dave, come on, do the responsible thing and say,
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:27.260]  screw work. Stay up all night.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:34.460]  Exactly. Come back. We got you. We're here all night. One other question here we got,
[02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:40.940]  oh, let me change the screen, make it readable here. Any plans on another Emerald Mountain Legacy
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:52.540]  collaboration? I don't know. I mean, basically like we had the Royal with cherries. I had shared
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:45:00.620]  some of the cherry lime pop and they did cool. They did a cool one with that. That came out
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:07.900]  really good. The cherry lime pop and the Royal Kush are both like really, really resilient outdoor
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:14.380]  strains. They really like, you know, high performance plants. They kind of check all the boxes.
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:24.300]  And so, you know, he put, he made those seeds, actually, he did that breeding and, and put those
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:33.020]  out. And then I had from my buddy, I had a buddy who was a neighbor at Mandelbrot. So Mandelbrot
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:42.300]  passed and he got some seeds from them and he ended up breeding them a couple of times. And I
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:47.420]  really liked where the line went. It was different than the rest of the Royals. And I took that and
[02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:51.660]  I crossed it with a few things, but the one that I had quite a few seeds up was crossed with my
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:57.260]  juicy gummy, which was also a cherry lime pop, but I was just a clone. I had taken out of the F1
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:06.860]  myself. And so it was coincidentally almost like a, it was like the backwards cross. It was like
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:11.660]  the same thing done different with different selections, with a different line of Royal,
[02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:19.740]  with a different selection of cherry lime pop. And that's the, that's the, the Royal Juicy. And
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:26.540]  so some of those are out. If you look, you might be able to find it, find a couple of those.
[02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:35.180]  And I'll probably put out a few more of those. But, you know, that, that particular Royal line,
[02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:42.460]  I'd like to do more with that just because it's not the same as what everybody has that's Royal,
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:49.020]  because Royal was kind of a polyhybrid to start. And then it got bred in different directions.
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:59.020]  And my buddy, when he got it, the way he bred it was like way, it was like a cool combo. Cause
[02:46:59.020 --> 02:47:07.900]  it was like very Afghani looking with a really nice chunky buds, but way more resinous than a
[02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:14.300]  lot of the more Afghani types that have been in the Royal as far as lines put out. And then
[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:22.700]  really, really cool smells of the combination of like the fruit and the, from the purple cush and
[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:32.620]  the, and the gas and super cool. So I don't know, I might do more with that, but yeah, that's,
[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:37.340]  so as, as of now, it's just that, that kind of that remix of Royal and cherries, which is the
[02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:45.660]  Royal juicy. Cool. And let's see here. I'll pull up the, the, the two things we've got up. Peter
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:56.940]  loaded up a couple of your packs tonight to the Daga website. We've got the, let's see here.
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:48:03.980]  Let me flip my page. You can read that the lime sour number one and then the T 1000 times that
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:12.700]  gelato 33 cherry limeade we're talking about here. And also a question here is some of the
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:16.780]  best places. So I know you've probably got more than two packs available right now. What are,
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:21.820]  what are a few good places for people to find things if they don't see that on the Daga
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:32.620]  Dock Garden site? And that T 1000 is those ones were only put out for those are only put out for
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:41.740]  charity and, Oh, out of stock. All right. Well, that went quick. Okay. Well, I don't know. Maybe
[02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:48.380]  I'll get them. I can get, maybe get them some more just cause people want them. But, and you know,
[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:55.580]  then whatever, something comes up, you can just get it to people. Okay. And then those ones,
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:49:00.940]  I could probably get them some, some more of those lime sours. I think I have
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:05.740]  more of those still. Those are nice. Those are really good cross.
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:16.460]  But yeah, and then you can get my stuff. Usually I always give a couple packs to LLF
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:23.900]  and some to a speakeasy and some to a regenerative
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:30.700]  Dutch, Dutch blooms. Right on. Yes. Peter.
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:37.500]  Oops. Clicking through my comments there. Okay. We got through the comments. You know,
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:42.860]  everybody, if you guys do have a few comments, please, or questions, definitely get them in
[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:50.140]  portal dreams. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Fresno's in here real quick. The root beer
[02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:57.420]  freeze F2. Was this the one that you just released or is this upcoming? Cause I know there was a
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:03.900]  root beer freeze. No. So the only, there's only one, there's only one freeze release and it is
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:11.900]  an F2, but it's an F2 of plants that were both pulled out of a back cross too.
[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:18.860]  And when they were made as a back cross too, they were, the original cross was with the
[02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:26.060]  root beer crossed with the Jaro and the Jaro and the root beer both have
[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:33.500]  the same father and the mothers, one of them was sour diesel and the other was headband.
[02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:41.980]  So like when you see it like F2, it's like F2, but it's really like whatever, however many
[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:49.900]  breedings in and there, when they were originally bred together before the back cross even started,
[02:50:49.980 --> 02:50:56.860]  cross even started, it was already kind of the same thing. So like it's says it's F2 because
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:51:01.900]  that's like how to understand what, what the breeding is right there. But that's the reason
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:07.340]  why I didn't actually write F2 on it. I wrote root beer cross root beer, cross root beer, across Jaro
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.940]  across root beer, cross root beer, cross root beer, across Jaro. Because it's like, I mean,
[02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:22.380]  you can say it's an F2, but it's like so inbred that it's like F2 sounds like you made a hybrid
[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:27.740]  and then you made some more seeds and now you're going to get all the various segregation and
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:32.620]  everything that happens with genetics. And it's like, no, they're not, they don't really,
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:38.140]  they don't really do that. It's basically just like a whole bunch of, a whole bunch of root beer
[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:44.380]  Jaro, you know? Okay. That, that made me wonder too, cause I didn't have a, an answer for it,
[02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:51.500]  or maybe I have an answer and it's just so simple. But you know, you, you get somebody's line like
[02:51:53.340 --> 02:52:01.100]  skunk VA, lucky dog, Seiko. He has a twin peak strain. And I, I got that and, you know, I went
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:05.980]  through the pack and I had a couple males, couple females. I'm like, well, you know, I'd really like
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:11.500]  to increase my seeds. I'd like to, you know, continue to search this. And so I crossed it
[02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:19.580]  just, you know, with itself, but it's not really an F1 cross. So it's not really like an F2 of what
[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:25.900]  I made. Is it, I just basically, I'm like, I increased the seeds, you know, it's, it's for
[02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:35.500]  personal use. So, yeah, I find that people tend to like, if somebody takes something and they didn't
[02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:40.940]  breed it and they make more, they just automatically call it an F2. Of course, if the
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:47.340]  seeds you bought were F4s and you made more than you just made F5s. Okay. Okay. People tend to use
[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:57.420]  F2 interchangeably with an increase. So like I made more, so F2, but like if you F2 and F7,
[02:52:57.420 --> 02:53:03.900]  then it's an F8. Right. Okay. Good. But if you buy seeds that are like that, where it's like,
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:08.940]  okay, the male is a back cross of this. And then it's put onto this thing. That's already kind of
[02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:15.900]  in the back cross to start. And it starts to get kind of weird. And the reason why it's all a
[02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:23.740]  little bit odd to, it's a little bit like hard to pin down the definitions because like quote unquote
[02:53:23.740 --> 02:53:31.820]  real breeding is generally done by taking two true breeding lines, putting them together and
[02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:37.900]  working them forward from there. So initially you get the true F1, then you breed them together
[02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:43.580]  and you get the F2. And then if you, there's something that you really liked in the F1
[02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:49.020]  that was resembling one of the original parents, but you liked what the other thing brought to it,
[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:57.820]  then you might make the regular back cross to one of the parents of the F1. Right. And so like all
[02:53:57.820 --> 02:54:04.700]  that is really straightforward and simple. But what happens with weed is that you want these
[02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:14.540]  traits to get locked down that are a little bit more like odd. And it's like a kind of a weird
[02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:24.140]  goal with weed because usually when people breed things, they like, there's usually a little bit
[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:30.220]  more of like a focused goal. Whereas with weed, I find it's a little more exploratory because
[02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:34.620]  you're like, well, I'm going to cross this with this because it seems cool. And then we'll see
[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:40.140]  what happens. And then you see what happens and you go, I think this might work better than sticking
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:45.260]  with this regular standard thing. So then you try it this other way. And then now you wind up with
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:50.860]  something like I have where it's like, okay, well I made this, I made this original cross and it's
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:57.740]  a half-sib cross because one mom is this and one mom is that, but they both have the same male.
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:55:03.900]  Then you have Jaro and you have Rupir, right? Then you go ahead and you breed them together.
[02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:11.020]  And now you've just bred basically, now you have something that's half the male and a quarter each
[02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:18.940]  of these two moms. And then you wind up going back again to the one mom. And so you wind up with this
[02:55:19.260 --> 02:55:28.140]  weird, these weird ways. And so I tried to write it out and somebody like Ryan Lee, Chimera,
[02:55:28.140 --> 02:55:33.260]  he knows this shit because he went to school for it. He tried weird shit. He asked people,
[02:55:33.260 --> 02:55:38.860]  what do you call that? He had that kind of interaction with people. I've asked him stuff.
[02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:45.340]  He'll tell me, I fucking forget because it's not like hands-on, like how it really is. This is
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:52.060]  supposed to be called like a B2-2 or some shit. I can't even remember exactly how he said it
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:57.980]  because even when he said it, I misunderstood him. And then I was like, oh shit, I didn't even ask
[02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:03.340]  the right question because I didn't even get what you were talking about. And as much as I'd like to
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:11.100]  be smart enough to understand all that shit in the real little nitty gritty specifics of how it's
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:19.100]  supposed to be every time, I'm still always like, oh, I know I could learn it. I could ask him again
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:26.140]  right now and know, but here's my issue with it. If I write that on the packs and I don't know it,
[02:56:26.140 --> 02:56:30.780]  who the fuck's going to know it? Nobody's going to know it. Chimera's going to know it. Maybe
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:36.060]  fucking Johnny Bob is going to know it. And some orchid breeders and like maybe some fucking dog
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:42.620]  breeders or some shit, but everybody else is going to go, what is B2-2 mean? Or what is B2 mean?
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:49.260]  Or what is whatever it is, you know, B2F2 or whatever he told me it was. So when he told me
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:55.340]  the fact that it didn't initially, that I didn't immediately go, oh fuck, okay. I was like, well,
[02:56:55.340 --> 02:57:04.060]  then it's not going to help me on my packaging. So instead of on the packaging writing B-C-2-F-2,
[02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:11.580]  right? I just said, this is what it is. It was Jaro on root beer, on root beer, on root beer,
[02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:17.740]  right? And then I crossed that with another plant that is the same thing. So when you read it,
[02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:23.180]  you're like, okay, well, I see what it is, but what is it? Well, it's an F2, but it's weird because
[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:29.580]  it's not really the first inbreeding because those back crosses in a sense are inbreedings. And then
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:36.140]  it, I mean, to me, it's murky too, but he said, that's not how you say it. You know,
[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:42.780]  you call it a B2-2 or a B-C-2-2 or some shit like that. And I was just like, okay, well,
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:48.300]  I just know nobody's going to understand. And for my, all my purposes, they don't really see
[02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:53.420]  where it would matter unless I'm talking to somebody like him. And that's generally not
[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:58.860]  my peer group because he's way, way beyond me and all that stuff. And I'm not like, you know,
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:05.580]  I'm not going to be at, you know, Davis or Cornell or something like lectures about the shit. I'm on
[02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:12.540]  YouTube talking to weed heads and homies and shit about like what it all means. So I'll explain how
[02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:18.860]  it is and I'll write how it is. But like with the real specifics of it, like people get annoyed that
[02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:24.780]  I say B-C instead of B-X because everyone's all, it's B-X. And I'm like, well, no, it's B-C. And
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:29.740]  as soon as I heard it, I went, well, yeah, it's B-C. That's what it is. It's an abbreviation
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:36.060]  for bat cross. And the X is showing you that it's this times this, and it's a cross.
[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:43.180]  But I, when I heard B-C and I had heard B-X before I went, oh, well, B-C is proper. It's
[02:58:43.180 --> 02:58:48.620]  real easy for me to say B-C. But I figure like people can make sense out of that. And then we
[02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:53.500]  learn a little bit. But if I write B-2 on it, I don't fucking know. I don't think anybody's
[02:58:53.500 --> 02:59:01.100]  going to understand it. And nobody's going to get any utility from that articulation of language.
[02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:07.340]  Whereas I figured like B-C-2 is like, you can inject a little bit of real botanical
[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:16.460]  glossary into the conversation and it works. But it's like at a certain point, it just loses the
[02:59:16.460 --> 02:59:22.700]  usefulness. It's got to have practical application. It's funny. I literally said this earlier on a
[02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:28.780]  different show. I'm all there's botany and there's cannabis botany. Like they're both supposedly
[02:59:28.780 --> 02:59:34.460]  going to cover the same thing. To your credit, you're using brack and stigma though. So amen to
[02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:40.380]  that. I feel weird sometimes using those terms because people, you know, pissed me off.
[02:59:40.380 --> 02:59:46.780]  And I still say, I still say pod and hair. Because those are articulate words. People know what a
[02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:54.540]  pod is and they know what a hair is. But if you call the pod a calyx or a calyx and you call
[02:59:54.540 --> 03:00:01.820]  the hair a pistol, that's just, you're using scientific terms incorrectly. So it's like,
[03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:07.900]  you know what I mean? It's like one thing to say, like, you know, whatever it is, you know,
[03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:14.060]  like you can say, I mean, I don't know. But if you want somebody to know, you got to be like,
[03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:17.900]  it has pink pistols. You know, you can't say it has pink stigmas.
[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:21.820]  Yeah. But you might as well say it has pink hairs because they know what hairs is.
[03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:22.620]  There you go. Yeah.
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:27.100]  Anytime you're using the scientific, I just always feel like if I'm going to use a scientific term,
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:34.460]  it should be, it should be correct. And if I know, and then if I know that I'm in a situation where
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:40.140]  the correct scientific term won't articulate my thoughts, then I'll use the term that's the common,
[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:44.620]  the common one, you know, so you can just say, you know, I mean, it'd be like, if you were talking
[03:00:44.620 --> 03:00:51.340]  about, you know, like, like, like, like a mushroom species, and you were like, okay, well, I know
[03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:57.660]  that I know that a chanterelle is cantharellus, you know, and then you're like, okay, well, I'm
[03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:04.380]  just going to say chanterelle. But then you decide to use the scientific name, and then you use one
[03:01:04.380 --> 03:01:09.580]  that's a completely other thing. It's like, well, what the fuck is the point of being specific?
[03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:16.460]  If it's incorrect, you know what I mean? So I just try to like, keep myself in line like that. And
[03:01:16.460 --> 03:01:21.420]  then, you know, even like, when I say that, I'm like, I, I think that's the fucking name of
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:26.700]  chanterelles in Latin, but I can't fucking remember. Is it cantharellus? Is it chanterellus?
[03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:31.420]  It's somewhere in the ballpark right there. But I've never I don't use that I only use the term
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:35.420]  now in the analogy. Because normally, I'm like, fuck, I don't even know which one is the right
[03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:43.260]  one. So I'll just say chanterelles. I don't fucking know. You know, I have a mycologist guy
[03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:48.540]  that lives in my town. And we're a pretty rare area for particular type of mushrooms at certain
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:53.180]  times of years. But we'll go out together and he's dropping all the Latin names on me. And I'm like,
[03:01:53.180 --> 03:02:00.940]  dude, I'm never gonna retain any of this. Like just just like slimy cap this, you know,
[03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:06.620]  toadstool that I'm never gonna remember this, the Latin stuff. Thank you. But he's that's his head.
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:12.140]  That's his world. So yeah, it's a matter of like, how in depth do people want to go like when people
[03:02:12.140 --> 03:02:17.740]  want to like learn the scientific stuff, because they're really scientists. I'm like, cool. Like
[03:02:17.740 --> 03:02:26.780]  my ambition is like to like, I like to learn about like the mechanics of how the stuff works.
[03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:34.940]  I'm not as concerned with the with the with the glossary. Like, okay, these are the exact terms.
[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:41.580]  And this is what the right shit is. I mean, I appreciate people who know that and I will ask
[03:02:41.580 --> 03:02:46.700]  people and I might forget the terms. I'll try to learn them and I'll try to do all that and do it
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:53.580]  all proper. But what I'm always concerned with is the actual like, what is the actual thing? I don't
[03:02:53.580 --> 03:02:59.340]  want to misunderstand what's happening with actual mechanics in real time when I'm doing
[03:02:59.340 --> 03:03:05.500]  something and think that, oh, I'm going to back cross to this plant that is that is from a wild
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:10.860]  population where it's completely not true breeding. And I'm going to back cross to it and wind up with
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:17.020]  a perfect, a perfect version of this plant by doing a few back crosses. It's like, no, it doesn't have
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:21.580]  the right genetics for that. First, you need to start with a plant that wants to breed true
[03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:27.820]  and back cross to it and back crossing will work. So like, those are the things where I pay attention
[03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:35.900]  like, okay, so I tried this and it didn't work. So I need to do it like this. And those things to me
[03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:44.620]  are like, of huge importance, because they really matter for me. But like, my joke is always with
[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:50.140]  like the terminology. I'm like, okay, so are we going to stop calling it a joint because it's a
[03:03:50.140 --> 03:03:55.100]  cannabis cigarette? I don't think we're going to start saying cannabis cigarette, right? So if you
[03:03:55.100 --> 03:04:04.460]  want to keep saying pistol and hair and crystal and nug and pod and calyx and all this stuff and
[03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:09.900]  use it all wrong, like as long as we're having the same conversation and we're on the same page,
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:15.420]  and when you say one of the three words for the fucking stigma, we all know what we're talking
[03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:22.620]  about. Yeah, like cool. And I say stigma because I learned it and I thought it was interesting that
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:30.540]  we all knew it was wrong that we none of us knew was wrong. Now and so like, I try to use it because
[03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:37.500]  then people it's it creates the conversation where people ask what it is. But in you know,
[03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:43.100]  and I certainly don't give a shit what anybody calls anything, as long as when they tell me,
[03:04:43.100 --> 03:04:50.060]  dude, the fucking pistols turned pink. I'm like, Oh, neat. Okay, sweet. The fucking crystals were
[03:04:50.060 --> 03:04:56.220]  so thick, dude. The fucking trichromes were fucking, you know, the fucking claminate,
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:05:00.700]  claminate glands, they were giant. I'm like, I know what you're saying. I'm just gonna be like,
[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:06.060]  cool, keep it fucking moving. You know, it is that extra R that kills me, though.
[03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:13.580]  It's so super funny. Now, if you are a professor of these things, and you are telling people that
[03:05:13.580 --> 03:05:17.980]  you're the expert and it's wrong, I'm gonna be like, dude, that shit's wrong. That's not a
[03:05:18.540 --> 03:05:24.620]  that's not a fucking stigma. You know, that's not a fucking that's not a pistol. That's not a
[03:05:24.620 --> 03:05:31.340]  fucking whatever it is, because then it's somebody who's like in a position of authority, who's
[03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:36.220]  saying it. But that's why I always like about myself. I'm like, I might know some shit,
[03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:43.340]  but I'm not a professor. I'm not an expert. I'm not fucking any of that shit. I am a hands on
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:49.260]  breeder. I do breed shit breeding is a verb. I don't just fucking do it all put all in here and
[03:05:49.260 --> 03:05:55.180]  there. I fucking have goals. I achieve goals. I'm willing to be like, Alright, I'm fucking I'm a
[03:05:55.180 --> 03:06:00.460]  breeder. But I'm not going to tell you like, I'm the most technical breeder. I'm the best breeder.
[03:06:00.460 --> 03:06:05.500]  I'm the most advanced breeder. It's like no, I'm fucking in anybody who's making seeds and they
[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:10.620]  have goals in there. And they're hitting some goals along with some some some, you know, getting
[03:06:10.620 --> 03:06:14.540]  some shit accomplished along the way. I'm like, you're breeding. It doesn't mean like that, that
[03:06:14.540 --> 03:06:19.100]  like we're going to be the best breeders. There's some people who are real technically skilled and
[03:06:19.100 --> 03:06:26.380]  who are super highly educated, and they're going to outdo us. But like, you know, it just there's
[03:06:26.380 --> 03:06:30.940]  those people who take it upon themselves to go I'm going to start the fucking institute of
[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:36.220]  teaching you about this shit and then their shit's all wrong. And I'm like, Look, you're fucking
[03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:42.780]  wrong. Correct it. And then that'll be fucking great. And then those situations is the only time
[03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:48.860]  where I'm like, right, dude, and I'll speak up. But just all normal. All those guys talking about
[03:06:48.860 --> 03:06:53.420]  some shit. It's all great. You know, who cares? Yeah, fucking terminology is you know,
[03:06:54.300 --> 03:06:59.980]  I did I couldn't agree more. And it's you know, it's I think maybe this is why you know, a lot of
[03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:05.260]  people or community resonate with you. It's like you're humble. You know, you're transparent in
[03:07:05.260 --> 03:07:12.860]  the work that you do. And you know, you do great work. So I really do appreciate that. And yeah,
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:18.780]  so people get stuck on terminology. It's important, but it all depends on the mouth that it's coming
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:23.740]  from. You know, again, if you want to be a teacher, get it right. If you want to hang,
[03:07:23.740 --> 03:07:28.780]  we can just hang. For sure. Yeah. And I mean, I you know, I show up and I talk on panels and
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:33.980]  stuff like that. And I do q&a and I answer questions like the best and not answer them
[03:07:33.980 --> 03:07:41.500]  and all that but but but not because I think that I'm the most educated or the best person to answer
[03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:48.220]  the questions is just that like, I'm asked to be here. I'm asked a question. You want to answer
[03:07:48.220 --> 03:07:52.140]  if I don't really understand the subject, I'm going to be like, I don't really understand that
[03:07:52.140 --> 03:07:56.540]  very well. And if I do understand something, I'm going to be like, Okay, I understand this part of
[03:07:56.540 --> 03:08:01.900]  it. This is what I know. I took a lot of time to learn about this stuff. If I can pass it on to
[03:08:01.900 --> 03:08:06.780]  you, it saves you a shitload of trying to figure out what's real and what's not because I'm I am
[03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:12.220]  hands on and I have tried things and I kind of know what they are and all that kind of shit.
[03:08:12.220 --> 03:08:18.860]  And I think that that's valuable to be able to be like, a resource for shit. But at the same time,
[03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:26.220]  I'm not like, you know, I'm certainly not fucking, you know, Rob Clark, or fucking, you know, some of
[03:08:26.220 --> 03:08:32.540]  these people who really are like, deep into shit for so long that, you know, they're, they're like,
[03:08:33.660 --> 03:08:35.020]  a true expert, you know,
[03:08:35.020 --> 03:08:40.940]  yeah, tech textbooks are good. You know, I did the I did the schooling for this stuff. And I'll tell
[03:08:40.940 --> 03:08:47.580]  you, I only called soil dirt about five times before the teacher freaked out on me. It's soil
[03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:57.420]  as a system. Yes. Fucking geology. Yeah, but it's, um, I forgot where I was going with that.
[03:08:57.420 --> 03:09:02.380]  Because just I remember the scold the scold. I'm sorry. Yeah,
[03:09:05.660 --> 03:09:09.180]  I am I completely forgot where I was going with that one. But
[03:09:11.020 --> 03:09:16.380]  yeah, we get we get it right when we can. How about that? Yep. Everybody can do
[03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:20.460]  not claim to fucking know everything because nobody does.
[03:09:21.100 --> 03:09:27.420]  No, for sure. Well, shit, man. Where Where can people, you know, find you at least stay up to
[03:09:27.420 --> 03:09:30.300]  date with what you got going on? Because you're, you're busy.
[03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:35.740]  I try to put stuff out like if I if I'm if I'm, you know, like, I'm not real great at
[03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:43.180]  keeping like everything. You know, posting all documentation and everything, but I try to,
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:49.660]  if you know, if something's going to be made available, even if it's just a little bit, or
[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:53.820]  even sometimes if I'm just like gave out some testers or something, I try to post it on my
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:10:04.940]  Instagram, which is mean gene for Mendocino. And that's, that's about it. I mean, I'm thinking
[03:10:04.940 --> 03:10:10.700]  about doing like the whole discord thing and maybe even doing like a Patreon where maybe I do
[03:10:10.700 --> 03:10:18.060]  like a step by step and actually take time to go and show like, okay, we're gonna plant seeds,
[03:10:18.060 --> 03:10:24.140]  we're gonna transplant, this is the food I'm using this year. This is how I built my stuff.
[03:10:24.140 --> 03:10:29.340]  This is the pots I'm using and really do kind of like walk a whole walkthrough of stuff where
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:34.940]  I actually show stuff and have it be like worth, worth doing it. It just it's a lot. It's always a
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:41.260]  lot of time. It's a lot of time just to, you know, fucking look through just to surf, surf
[03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:48.060]  the fucking internet on Instagram and shit is a time suck, you know, it is, you know, I fucking
[03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:54.220]  I'm addicted to it, but I keep myself from doing it too much. Like I try to go on and then go off
[03:10:54.220 --> 03:10:57.820]  and I'll have little runs where I'll be on there. People are like, you haven't been on I'm like,
[03:10:57.820 --> 03:11:05.500]  yeah, I fucking know. Yay for me. Yay for me. But yeah, I'd like to do like, I'd like to get it
[03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:14.620]  to where I can have like, you know, information up that's a little bit more useful. And, you know,
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:21.020]  with people who are actually trying to see it and not have to sit through, I get pretty good. I do
[03:11:21.020 --> 03:11:28.300]  good. I'm, I'm grateful to help people. The response I get online, people are generally cool.
[03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:35.980]  But like, you know, you can't help but like, sometimes have people come on and it's some weird
[03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:41.420]  shit. You're like, why are you? Why are you on my shit? Like, what are you doing? Get out of here?
[03:11:41.420 --> 03:11:48.140]  Like, I'm just, you don't like me. So you stopped what you're doing with your day to immerse yourself
[03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:53.580]  in my world. And now you're upset about that. Like, yeah, and I tend to just like if anything,
[03:11:53.580 --> 03:11:58.620]  if, if something, anything gives me like a bad vibe, I tend to just like, delete people and
[03:11:58.620 --> 03:12:02.380]  block them and shit, you know, and people are like, well, that's not right. And I'm like, well,
[03:12:03.180 --> 03:12:07.260]  I'm not just gonna have you come in my space and be a fucking asshole. I'm not a,
[03:12:07.260 --> 03:12:11.180]  you know, it's like the old, do I come to your fucking work and slap the fucking mop out of your
[03:12:11.180 --> 03:12:16.300]  hand? You know, let me come shit in your cereal. How about that? Yeah, it just doesn't make any
[03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:21.020]  sense. But yeah, so but I would like to I'm trying to kind of put that together maybe to do like,
[03:12:21.740 --> 03:12:28.060]  do like some kind of more of like a chat where, you know, I can do that. Because I mean, I like
[03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:34.060]  to do that. It's I love it. If someone has a question, and I can have a helpful answer, or
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:39.820]  if people are curious, like what my process is, and if I'm actually doing shit, or if I'm full
[03:12:39.820 --> 03:12:45.340]  of shit, I like to be able to like show like, no, I'm I do it. I mean, I'm not fucking doing anything
[03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:51.740]  mind blowing, but it does exist. And it is what I spend all my time doing is is seed shit and
[03:12:51.740 --> 03:12:59.180]  looking at plants and and so you know, cool to have like something where you can you have that
[03:12:59.180 --> 03:13:06.140]  going on and and I'm stoked. Instagram has been really good for that. And I just I just always
[03:13:06.140 --> 03:13:12.940]  know that my account could be gone anytime. Yeah, yeah. You know, so that's Yeah, I mean, I've,
[03:13:12.940 --> 03:13:18.620]  you know, built a website for myself. It's it's always constantly in progress. But you know,
[03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:22.780]  things like Instagram, that's where people already are. That's where the party is. It's hard to filter
[03:13:22.780 --> 03:13:28.460]  people off to go just for specifically one thing. I like the Patreon idea, though. I mean, I would
[03:13:28.460 --> 03:13:33.500]  definitely do that. I think there's a lot of people that would. And when you said that it reminded me
[03:13:33.500 --> 03:13:39.020]  of what I just blanked on a couple minutes ago. But, you know, it's like textbooks are good.
[03:13:39.580 --> 03:13:45.900]  But it really takes the experience in combination with those to get the full picture.
[03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:51.340]  So you don't have the impact. Like I read marijuana botany as a teenager, and then I read it again.
[03:13:51.340 --> 03:13:56.700]  And then I read it again. And I read it again. Yeah, my battery on my tablet might die soon that
[03:13:56.700 --> 03:14:01.580]  I'm on but so if I disappear, it's because I it's not because I died. It's because my electronics
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:10.780]  goes to me. Yeah, like I asked the wrong question three hours. But yeah, but but the first time I
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:15.820]  read it was like, oh, wow, these are all really cool ideas. And I thought I understood it. And
[03:14:15.820 --> 03:14:21.260]  then I grew a bunch of weed. And then I read it again. And I was like, oh, there's a lot there's
[03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:26.780]  a lot more useful information in here than I realized. I kind of did this stuff didn't I
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:32.060]  it just didn't it just kind of I was like it didn't exist when I read it the first time.
[03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:36.300]  And then I read it again. And I was like, holy shit. And then I started going into the back and
[03:14:36.300 --> 03:14:41.260]  reading like these little there's like little notes on studies and stuff in the back about like
[03:14:41.260 --> 03:14:47.340]  biomass production, temperature and we're going I was like, oh, oh, all this shit's really cool.
[03:14:47.340 --> 03:14:53.340]  Like and it was like it is, you know, every time with those kind of things, like the experience
[03:14:53.340 --> 03:14:59.820]  makes the material a lot different. And so I recommend everybody if they don't know what to
[03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:08.220]  start with, you start with marijuana botany, and then do some stuff, and then read it again.
[03:15:08.780 --> 03:15:14.620]  Like I've never really got past that book, honestly. I mean, I've read a lot of other stuff.
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:21.260]  But as far as like, when I read it now, I'm still like, oh, okay, I just I just noticed this, you
[03:15:21.260 --> 03:15:27.980]  know, discord, Peter. Yep. He's got the discord up here. Where is it? Boom. There we go. There we
[03:15:27.980 --> 03:15:39.740]  go. Yeah, I like you time is not. I wish I had more time. So I'm not on discord. That's easy way
[03:15:39.740 --> 03:15:46.540]  to say it. Yeah, I figured, you know, if I could, if I could, like take the people who are really
[03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:54.460]  interested in what I'm doing off of Instagram and move them to a different thing. That where
[03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:59.020]  they're there just for that. And it's not just something popping up on their big mixed feed.
[03:15:59.020 --> 03:16:04.540]  But Instagram is a trip. I like Instagram, because I don't just follow weed stuff. And like, it's
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:09.020]  like, yeah, right now, there's all a big controversy about social club and stuff over the last few days.
[03:16:09.660 --> 03:16:17.260]  And I basically went over there and signed up claimed my name, so that nobody would would
[03:16:17.260 --> 03:16:24.460]  scam people using my account, and then took that back off my phone. Because I really don't. I
[03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:36.940]  really don't. I'm the weed stuff is cool. But like, when I go on to IG, I'm not really looking
[03:16:36.940 --> 03:16:44.380]  at that much weed stuff. I like look at a lot of like archaeology and orchids and all kinds of
[03:16:44.380 --> 03:16:50.060]  different like little stuff that is all this cool stuff. And then there's the weed stuff. And then
[03:16:50.060 --> 03:16:54.540]  people can get ahold of me, you know, and then there's all the little stuff. And it's all cool.
[03:16:54.540 --> 03:17:02.220]  But like, I just to like go on a thing, and it's all just weed right there. It's like, for me,
[03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:07.340]  it's not that's not that big of an experience. I'm like, that's your life we've going on,
[03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:12.620]  you know, like, it's just not I like, I really like Instagram for all the other stuff. I follow
[03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:19.100]  a lot of art and all those different cool shit like that's that's cooler. You know, and it's the
[03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:26.060]  whole it's everything. The whole world is on Instagram. It's like, the other apps are just
[03:17:26.060 --> 03:17:31.180]  for like, oh, let's bring the weed community and I love the weed community. But like,
[03:17:31.660 --> 03:17:37.900]  there's all that is already on IG. And then there's all this other stuff, which is like stuff
[03:17:37.900 --> 03:17:44.060]  that's like a lot of it is enriching, and I really like it. And then you know, the weed stuff is more,
[03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:49.900]  you know, a lot of it is just people hustling. And I'm like, that's cool. But like, I kind of
[03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:56.860]  already, I'm kind of aware of most of the stuff that's going on. And I don't know. And then
[03:17:57.660 --> 03:18:03.420]  I don't know. But anyway, I like Instagram, so I get my skate videos there. So yeah, right.
[03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:07.100]  There's all kinds of stuff. It's like the whole it's little clips of the whole internet is there.
[03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:15.740]  And I know. I like I also like stupid memes and shit. And no, you follow it like big figures.
[03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:21.020]  You know, like I like to follow like public, like, there's like people like, you know,
[03:18:21.020 --> 03:18:26.620]  you follow comics and music and all this different stuff that's on there. And then it's like,
[03:18:26.860 --> 03:18:32.140]  I kind of like to just be on one thing. I used to have Facebook. I didn't know I had Instagram.
[03:18:32.140 --> 03:18:35.660]  Then I was on Facebook and Instagram. And after a while, I was like, I'm not on Facebook,
[03:18:35.660 --> 03:18:39.980]  just on Instagram. So I like going back and forth. And all this different little shit. I'm like,
[03:18:39.980 --> 03:18:43.740]  I just want to check out a little internet. All right, get the fuck off of there. So then it's
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:48.300]  like, oh, another app. And then here and I'm like, it's cool if it protects everything and
[03:18:49.260 --> 03:18:55.100]  all that. And you know, I don't have like, any huge opinions on any of that specifically. But
[03:18:55.660 --> 03:19:01.420]  I just know for like practicality, I just I really like to like, you know, I love looking at like
[03:19:01.420 --> 03:19:08.460]  mushrooms and arrowheads and ruins and like all kinds of cool shit, big wave surfers and shit.
[03:19:08.460 --> 03:19:13.900]  That's just like really nice. And then I like I like went on social club to check the feed for a
[03:19:13.900 --> 03:19:20.060]  minute. I'm all cool. But it's just all like, bags of weed and people smoking and shit. And I'm like,
[03:19:20.220 --> 03:19:27.660]  it's like, that's cool. I mean, it's just for me for my own for my own thing. Like I'd have to,
[03:19:27.660 --> 03:19:32.860]  I don't know, have to be more more stuff going on. So yeah, bring back my space.
[03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:37.420]  You need to come back. I don't know if Ashton Kutcher still owns it or not.
[03:19:37.420 --> 03:19:42.060]  But that's the last time I heard or thought of my space was Ashton Kutcher bought it.
[03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:43.520]  Crazy.
[03:19:44.380 --> 03:19:48.060]  Yeah, you know, Tom, where's Tom now?
[03:19:48.620 --> 03:19:50.060]  I don't know. Tom was legit, man.
[03:19:51.260 --> 03:19:56.940]  Tom was everybody's friend. I really wonder what he's doing now. Actually, shit. I wonder if he I
[03:19:56.940 --> 03:20:04.460]  wonder if he just like mock Zuckerberg or not. Like you rookie, right? Metaverse. Come on.
[03:20:05.420 --> 03:20:12.540]  Yeah. No, I mean, it's all Yeah, I don't know. It's all it's all cool. I mean, I've I've
[03:20:14.700 --> 03:20:21.180]  I've had a lot of cool interactions and a lot of cool stuff. Basically, because of, you know,
[03:20:21.740 --> 03:20:25.260]  Facebook, too, like that, because before I was on Instagram, I was on Facebook,
[03:20:25.260 --> 03:20:31.260]  I met a bunch of people that were, you know, cool, cool people that were into,
[03:20:31.260 --> 03:20:35.980]  you know, I didn't know anybody was even into like seeds and shit, honestly, until I was kind
[03:20:35.980 --> 03:20:40.540]  of online. And then I was like, wow, there's a whole whole bunch of people are into shit, you
[03:20:40.540 --> 03:20:46.780]  know, and, you know, then you discover like, oh, there's there's people in Afghanistan right now
[03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:52.140]  putting seeds in their fucking pocket. Holy shit, those plants don't look like Amsterdam weed to me
[03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:58.300]  like everybody told me, oh, there's no real it's all gone. Don't look on to me. And I saw all that
[03:20:58.300 --> 03:21:02.380]  on the fucking internet, you know, so yeah, it's all cool, man. It's a it's a
[03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:10.220]  there's pros and cons. But I think overall, it all all the good is, is pretty fucking cool.
[03:21:10.220 --> 03:21:16.220]  Yeah, it's a tool. You just got to use it right. So step by, I try to use it right as much as I can.
[03:21:16.220 --> 03:21:21.180]  And then I'll give 20% of my day just to like fuckery. Just just looking around cruising
[03:21:21.180 --> 03:21:26.380]  through the IG feed just me me. It's all social experiment. It's cool.
[03:21:26.940 --> 03:21:32.060]  Yeah, yeah. But you know, the plants, the plants teach us patience, the plants teach us kind of the
[03:21:32.060 --> 03:21:38.140]  long play, nothing happens super fast. And that's one thing that in the internet world seems to be
[03:21:38.140 --> 03:21:44.700]  like accelerated. Everything is like now now now, no patience. I need 30 second clips. If it's over
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:52.300]  two minutes, I can't bother with it. Yeah. But get back in the garden. Yeah, I love like the viral
[03:21:52.300 --> 03:22:00.540]  outrage for three days. And then everybody's like, Oh, yeah, whatever. Yeah, the news cycle,
[03:22:00.540 --> 03:22:07.260]  man. You're like, all right, yeah, you guys were really fucking mad, weren't you? For about three
[03:22:07.260 --> 03:22:14.700]  fucking days. And then all of a sudden, whatever. Like, yeah, like a pretty big fucking energy
[03:22:14.700 --> 03:22:21.580]  sucked right there. You know, yes, the energy for me, it's all a joke. I'm like, if I post a
[03:22:21.580 --> 03:22:26.620]  meme about like current events or whatever's going on or something, I just it's just fucking fun.
[03:22:26.620 --> 03:22:30.860]  It's a joke. I just hope there's people who are looking at my meme and then like they were like,
[03:22:30.860 --> 03:22:34.940]  maybe like, kind of like having a stale day or bummed out or something. And all of a sudden,
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:39.660]  they're all oh shit. Just a little just a little bump, you know, you get a little bump because
[03:22:39.660 --> 03:22:43.340]  that's what I that's why I like memes and shit is you're like, and then all of a sudden, you're
[03:22:43.420 --> 03:22:47.820]  oh, and maybe it just switches your consciousness just a little bit. And you're doing a little bit
[03:22:47.820 --> 03:22:52.460]  better now, you know, same with this kind of shit. It's all, you know, I mean, I'm here talking to
[03:22:52.460 --> 03:22:56.460]  you. And this is what it is. And there's people in the chat, we can see some of what's going on
[03:22:56.460 --> 03:23:00.620]  there. But like, you know, what I hope is that there's some people who are like, fuck, I didn't
[03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:05.420]  have nothing to do. And I wanted to know about some weed shit. And they're like, coming here.
[03:23:05.420 --> 03:23:12.540]  And there's like a, it's like, you know, like, we're all part of this one little thing for a
[03:23:12.540 --> 03:23:19.900]  minute. Party, we're all sharing space, you know, vibing out. So it's cool for me, because I was
[03:23:19.900 --> 03:23:25.340]  never the person who would talk about what I did with people around me, or even like, you know,
[03:23:25.340 --> 03:23:30.140]  my neighborhood, I live in a little town, like, you know, my neighbor asked me, it's kind of like,
[03:23:30.140 --> 03:23:34.140]  you know, I don't smoke pot, even though I'm a big advocate. And I'll talk to everybody. It's just
[03:23:34.140 --> 03:23:40.780]  like, don't shit where you sleep, kind of thing. So being having this access to people having being
[03:23:40.780 --> 03:23:45.500]  able to have these types of conversations, it's priceless to me, because I can't go out on my
[03:23:45.500 --> 03:23:50.540]  porch and have this conversation with my buddy down the street. It's just, you know, where I live. So
[03:23:50.540 --> 03:23:56.380]  again, using the tool correctly. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's all everything, everything you can find
[03:23:56.380 --> 03:24:02.220]  in life. If you can, you want it to, you want it to kick your vibe up and, and, you know, elevate
[03:24:02.220 --> 03:24:07.660]  your consciousness and make you be doing a little bit better. And fucking, you know, like, there's
[03:24:07.740 --> 03:24:12.380]  plenty of shit that's a fucking bummer. And there's plenty of shit that's really worth worrying
[03:24:12.380 --> 03:24:17.820]  about. And a lot of shit ain't worth worrying about. This shit on the fucking internet is like,
[03:24:18.700 --> 03:24:24.460]  guys, this is this ain't it, dude. This is a worried about, you know,
[03:24:26.940 --> 03:24:34.220]  Yes, yeah, fucking hell, man. I will say that is a good place to end it. Yeah, calm down, people.
[03:24:34.860 --> 03:24:39.020]  I'm on I'm on 1% on my fucking iPad. So I know I'm about to die.
[03:24:39.660 --> 03:24:47.500]  I nailed it on my charger right here. So, dude, I appreciate it. This is longer than I thought.
[03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:52.380]  So priceless, man. Thank you for making my night and for everybody in chat.
[03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:54.300]  Yeah, it's a good episode, man. Good show.
[03:24:55.580 --> 03:24:57.740]  Thanks, everybody for checking it out. Hope everyone.
[03:24:58.700 --> 03:25:02.700]  Thanks. All right. We'll catch you later, guys.
