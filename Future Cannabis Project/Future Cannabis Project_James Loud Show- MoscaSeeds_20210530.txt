[00:00.700 --> 00:07.300]  Good morning everyone. We are now live. Welcome to a very special episode of the
[00:07.300 --> 00:12.780]  James Loud show, which even I didn't know about until late last night. Welcome
[00:12.780 --> 00:17.060]  everybody, and here is the magical Mr. James Loud.
[00:17.060 --> 00:25.060]  Hey guys, thanks for tuning in this week. Sorry we've missed a couple weeks. I'm waiting for my studio to get
[00:25.060 --> 00:30.100]  finished. We're having some technical difficulties with sound dampening, so
[00:30.100 --> 00:34.700]  it sounds good. We got all the Joe Rogan Experience equipment, and it's gonna be
[00:34.700 --> 00:38.900]  really cool once it's ready. Until then, we're gonna continue doing it
[00:38.900 --> 00:46.420]  from my office. I want to give a shout out to Mr. Bud Kilowatt, who
[00:46.420 --> 00:50.180]  sent me a beautiful poster, which I'll try to grab in a little bit and show you
[00:50.180 --> 00:54.020]  guys to add to the collection on the wall. Today we have a special
[00:54.020 --> 01:02.380]  guest, one of my good friends and great breeder, Rick Mosca. Hey there James, Peter.
[01:02.380 --> 01:08.140]  How's it going? Yeah, going really well. Keeping busy here on the farm in
[01:08.140 --> 01:14.300]  northern Illinois, getting a lot of seeds together. So yeah, it's going good.
[01:14.300 --> 01:19.780]  Cool man. So, you know, how's the weather out there? I know Chicago's all
[01:19.780 --> 01:22.700]  over the place, and Illinois is all over the place weather-wise. How's it right
[01:22.700 --> 01:29.060]  now? Yeah, you know what, actually great. It's gonna be in the 70s today, low 70s,
[01:29.060 --> 01:38.140]  and then we're pushing 80s by midweek, and soon to be 90s again. Awesome. Yeah, so you've
[01:38.140 --> 01:42.100]  been all over the place lately with shows and stuff starting to happen again. You want to tell us a
[01:42.100 --> 01:47.020]  little bit about the shows that you've been able to go to? Yeah, we'd love to, James, but
[01:47.020 --> 01:51.260]  before we start, I just want to give a big shout out to all the service men and
[01:51.260 --> 01:57.380]  women out there who have really donated and really sacrificed for our country,
[01:57.380 --> 02:03.380]  and helped us get our freedoms and liberties, and I think we're all a part
[02:03.380 --> 02:09.820]  of that. So thank you to all of them on this Memorial Day weekend. Yeah, coming on
[02:09.820 --> 02:14.380]  the show, I agree, man. It's just, we wouldn't be here today without the, you
[02:14.380 --> 02:20.140]  know, the select few that have gone out, and whether they were drafted or whether
[02:20.140 --> 02:26.740]  they decided to join the military, you know, I think those people, you can't
[02:26.740 --> 02:31.980]  speak highly enough about what they've done for us and our freedom. So, excellent.
[02:31.980 --> 02:38.220]  But yeah, so Illinois shows, let's talk about some shows. Yeah, so you know,
[02:38.220 --> 02:42.620]  there's a lot of shows now starting to pop back up. We're getting notified about
[02:42.620 --> 02:47.980]  a bunch of them. There was a real big one just a couple days ago, CannaCon, down in
[02:47.980 --> 02:53.780]  Oklahoma City, which is always a really great show. We were supposed to be a part
[02:53.780 --> 02:59.660]  of that, but not knowing whether or not where we would be as a country with
[02:59.660 --> 03:06.300]  COVID, we didn't want to take any chances, so we opted out of it. But I hear that it
[03:06.300 --> 03:12.380]  was a really terrific show. A lot of people, you know, near to the levels of
[03:12.500 --> 03:18.300]  last time they had these shows two years ago. But so for that, we're really,
[03:18.300 --> 03:26.340]  really excited. There's some other ones are going to be coming to the Midwest,
[03:26.340 --> 03:34.900]  Indoexpo, CannaCon as well. I know NECAN's coming out here too. And so, you
[03:34.900 --> 03:39.060]  know, those are really great shows, usually very well attended, especially
[03:39.060 --> 03:45.900]  since a lot of the larger cultivation corporations are headquartered in
[03:46.020 --> 03:51.740]  Chicago. And so, you know, we expect to see a lot of them at these shows for a
[03:51.740 --> 03:56.260]  lot of the education portion of them. But now there looks like they're going to be
[03:56.260 --> 03:57.820]  back up and running. So.
[03:59.100 --> 04:03.380]  Awesome. Yeah, exciting times, man. I feel like we're seeing the end of the
[04:03.380 --> 04:09.020]  pandemic, or whatever you want to call it. But yeah, I feel like that it's great
[04:09.020 --> 04:13.420]  that we're getting towards the end of it. And people are taking their masks off.
[04:13.460 --> 04:18.500]  And I think, you know, getting back to normal is as normal as could be. I mean,
[04:18.500 --> 04:22.820]  our industry, we've been blessed to have an industry that thrives under the
[04:22.820 --> 04:29.460]  pandemic, that will continue to thrive after the pandemic. So yeah, I see some
[04:29.460 --> 04:32.900]  comments about your raspberry boogie. People love the raspberry boogie. You
[04:32.900 --> 04:34.700]  want to tell everybody about the raspberry boogie?
[04:35.460 --> 04:42.340]  Yeah, I'd love to. Raspberry boogie is a strain that has really come into its
[04:42.340 --> 04:49.860]  own. It's our best selling strain. We will have a feminized version, God
[04:49.860 --> 04:56.820]  willing, in the fall. And, you know, what makes it special is not only, you
[04:56.820 --> 05:02.380]  know, the THC, but the CBD. So the overall terpene profile of the plant
[05:02.580 --> 05:11.060]  raspberries rather unique in cannabis genetics. We don't really see a lot of
[05:11.060 --> 05:17.980]  it. But people really seem to like the flavors, the terpenes, the coloration,
[05:17.980 --> 05:24.820]  very fast maturing plant. It'll be done outdoors by the end of September,
[05:24.820 --> 05:30.580]  usually around 2728. I brought it for indoor use, but it has excelled outdoors
[05:30.580 --> 05:37.900]  because of the early finishing. And so to be able to go in and pull a plant by
[05:37.900 --> 05:43.020]  the end of September is, you know, you're avoiding all of the frost, you
[05:43.020 --> 05:48.300]  know, the extreme temperatures that are just around the corner. So yeah, it's a
[05:48.780 --> 05:54.260]  it's a really strong grower, your favorite food for a lot of people. And
[05:54.420 --> 05:56.260]  we'll we'll definitely have it back on the menu.
[05:57.260 --> 06:02.620]  Awesome. Yeah, I think it's a crowd pleaser for sure. I you get a lot of
[06:02.620 --> 06:07.660]  people talking about it and it's awesome strain. So as far as indoor does it
[06:07.660 --> 06:11.300]  finish around 63 days 55 days? What are we looking at?
[06:13.060 --> 06:20.820]  It's right around 5052 days. It's very quick. And yeah, right now we're doing
[06:21.220 --> 06:30.340]  selections of F2s and F3s. We have some really, really fine moms that we've kind
[06:30.340 --> 06:35.580]  of narrowed down to. So we're evaluating about a dozen different moms right now.
[06:36.020 --> 06:46.300]  And it's, it's great to see consistency amongst the plants, because it's going to
[06:46.300 --> 06:53.540]  make it rather challenging to select, you know, the favorite one, two or three.
[06:54.180 --> 06:57.980]  But that's generally what we'll do after a dozen when they get it down to three.
[06:58.340 --> 07:02.620]  And then we'll grow those out a couple times and then figure out which one we'd
[07:02.620 --> 07:07.300]  like best breed that and get seeds. So.
[07:08.380 --> 07:14.940]  Nice. Yeah. So somebody mentioned on the Instagram feed the other day about
[07:15.140 --> 07:21.780]  feminized being easy to pheno hunt. And, you know, as opposed to regular seeds.
[07:22.100 --> 07:28.140]  And in my experience, you know, it's like finding winners is very dependent. You
[07:28.140 --> 07:31.780]  know, it depends on who you are, what you feel as a winner. A lot of times there'll
[07:31.780 --> 07:35.220]  be stuff in a 10 pack that's good enough for most people, I think. But if you want
[07:35.220 --> 07:39.820]  to find that unicorn, which is like what we call those winners that are like the
[07:39.860 --> 07:44.180]  OG Kush when somebody found the OG Kush or when somebody found that the Sunset
[07:44.180 --> 07:50.180]  Sherbert, when Srebensky and Cookie, when they found that Sunset Sherbert or GMO,
[07:50.180 --> 07:54.260]  that real pheno, that one, those are unicorns. Like even with feminized seeds,
[07:54.260 --> 07:59.740]  you don't find unicorns that often. It's a rarity. And even in a 100 pack, you might
[07:59.740 --> 08:04.380]  find a keeper. But does that keeper translate to a unicorn? Not necessarily.
[08:04.660 --> 08:08.500]  Now, the advantage of breeding feminized seeds as opposed to regular seeds is you
[08:08.500 --> 08:14.060]  know what the male or the donor, which is not necessarily male, but reverse female
[08:14.060 --> 08:18.100]  is going to express to a degree. It doesn't always translate, but a lot of times
[08:18.100 --> 08:22.780]  you have a better insight of what it's going to do. So there are advantages that
[08:22.780 --> 08:27.060]  way. But as far as you know, what's your take on that, Rick?
[08:27.900 --> 08:35.620]  I totally agree. You know what the the mom is donating, especially in the S1
[08:35.620 --> 08:40.380]  because you see the mother and then you see the the reverse female that is the
[08:40.380 --> 08:48.020]  mother, but just, you know, the pollen or the extra set of chromosomes. And, you
[08:48.020 --> 08:54.860]  know, I think that it really adds a lot to stabilizing and getting towards an
[08:54.860 --> 09:06.500]  inbred selection of female seeds, true female seeds. And no, it's great to work
[09:06.500 --> 09:14.940]  with, you know, those females that are very stable because those tend to be the
[09:14.940 --> 09:25.740]  better donors for pollen and making S1s and feminized crosses. And, you know, those
[09:25.740 --> 09:32.420]  have really worked well for us, especially like when we did the I did the Legend OG
[09:33.380 --> 09:39.340]  feminized, got that from a very, very good friend of the East Coast to remain
[09:40.020 --> 09:45.940]  remain nameless. But he knows who he is. And he's I mean, that was just a
[09:45.940 --> 09:55.140]  phenomenal donor female because she was so stable and just really added a lot of
[09:55.140 --> 10:01.580]  punch. And some of my strongest strains were from her crosses. Like I hit up the
[10:01.660 --> 10:07.500]  East Coast sour diesel with her pollen and that tested at almost 32 percent THC.
[10:07.900 --> 10:13.620]  I mean, it's just I know it's the overall terpene profile. But when you have THC
[10:13.620 --> 10:20.900]  that that's that high, you know, that's that's I think a success. And actually
[10:20.900 --> 10:25.420]  there was a grower who had tested out on the East Coast who brought me some flower
[10:25.700 --> 10:31.980]  at the Boston Freedom Rally about three, four years ago. And yeah, it's always
[10:31.980 --> 10:40.660]  great to see and sample some of the growers favorite favorite flowers. So
[10:41.060 --> 10:41.860]  especially when there are
[10:43.620 --> 10:49.460]  best feelings. People say, you know, I actually like when I've given seeds away
[10:49.460 --> 10:55.740]  for prizes and, you know, with with trivia or whatever, or auctions and stuff
[10:55.740 --> 10:59.060]  like that, when you see those people coming back, where they actually grew the
[10:59.060 --> 11:04.220]  flower out and they have samples and they show you to show Emerald Emerald cup is
[11:04.220 --> 11:07.060]  a great place for that. It seems like I get a lot of people coming coming to me
[11:07.060 --> 11:11.100]  with some flower that some of the stuff is like years old, where it's like I had
[11:11.100 --> 11:14.420]  those genetics years ago, that I haven't even thought about them in a long time.
[11:14.420 --> 11:18.580]  And it's really a great thing. When you see people coming through with flower,
[11:19.100 --> 11:22.500]  you know, in this day and age where people are collecting seeds like Pokemon,
[11:22.780 --> 11:27.220]  rather than sprouting them, which I would much prefer the germination and then
[11:27.220 --> 11:31.420]  collecting the mothers, but a lot of people love collecting seeds. It's just
[11:31.420 --> 11:31.900]  amazing.
[11:32.900 --> 11:33.300]  Yeah.
[11:35.180 --> 11:41.260]  Not only, you know, the flowers that they've grown, but then also what they've
[11:41.260 --> 11:46.740]  crossed out to because they'll take, you know, a favor male or a female reverser
[11:46.740 --> 11:50.980]  and hit it up with, you know, one of my strains. And that's like, that's really
[11:50.980 --> 11:55.620]  cool, because I love to see people experimenting doing out of their own so
[11:55.620 --> 12:00.540]  they can be self sufficient. Because at the end of the day, you know, if they're
[12:00.540 --> 12:06.060]  happy, and they've grown out some, some good flower, then, you know, that's very
[12:06.060 --> 12:07.860]  satisfying as a breeder.
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.900]  Totally. I think it's kind of funny. I've had a whole seed companies based their
[12:12.900 --> 12:18.060]  entire line on one of my males, which, you know, people once you sell it, people
[12:18.060 --> 12:22.140]  can do that, in my opinion, do whatever you want to do. I think it's a little bit
[12:22.140 --> 12:26.140]  silly to do a whole lot. I think people should do more breeding. I feel like
[12:26.820 --> 12:30.100]  there are breeders, we're doing real breeding work where I'm back crossing,
[12:30.100 --> 12:34.140]  I'm in breeding, I'm trying to do good selections, and then take those
[12:34.140 --> 12:37.860]  selections and make more great things. But I'm also doing F1 breeding where I'm
[12:37.860 --> 12:42.060]  using other people's, you know, donors and reversing them. But, uh, you know, I
[12:42.060 --> 12:44.980]  think more work needs to be done on the breeding side. So if you're starting a
[12:44.980 --> 12:49.940]  seed company, the best approach is to actually take and do some work, get a
[12:49.940 --> 12:55.020]  donor, or a male and put that on something that you call yours. And that
[12:55.020 --> 12:58.540]  really will, you know, that'll separate you as a breeder as opposed to just a
[12:58.540 --> 13:02.460]  seed producer. With 90% of the people are just seed producers out there.
[13:03.300 --> 13:08.740]  Yeah, yeah, it's really true. And, you know, putting the work in and keeping the
[13:08.740 --> 13:15.220]  generations alive so you can go back and work them and rework them to improve
[13:15.220 --> 13:20.420]  the plants. Because at the end of the day, that I mean, that's, that's what we
[13:20.420 --> 13:26.060]  should be doing. And like Rob Clark says is to use more land races. It's good to
[13:26.060 --> 13:31.740]  see that there's some good land races from like the Indian land race company.
[13:32.620 --> 13:39.740]  They've, they've sent some really, really nice, different types of plants,
[13:40.060 --> 13:46.460]  or seeds for for future breeding. So that's, that's exciting.
[13:47.220 --> 13:52.180]  Yeah, yeah, I think, you know, instead of just creating a whole, you know, I wish
[13:52.180 --> 13:55.300]  people would have, you know, we get excited about gelatos, and we get excited
[13:55.300 --> 14:00.140]  about before was OG chems, and the gas and gas got put in everything. And then
[14:00.140 --> 14:04.900]  it was cookies for a while and sure bird and then now gelatos. And I wish people
[14:04.900 --> 14:08.620]  got more excited about the land race stuff and some of those unique, you know,
[14:08.940 --> 14:13.100]  diversity, really diversity. And that's what I like about your genetics. I feel
[14:13.100 --> 14:17.500]  like you kind of go for those diverse things. You're not just shooting for the
[14:17.500 --> 14:20.100]  same thing everybody else has, you're really kind of trying to separate
[14:20.100 --> 14:22.300]  yourself in that regard. Plus your family.
[14:23.260 --> 14:29.460]  Yeah, yeah. And I think that's really that's part of the beauty. There's so
[14:29.460 --> 14:36.780]  much to choose from, you know, I think, you know, we need to kind of go in the
[14:36.780 --> 14:42.700]  direction that we see is best, you know, because part of breeding, as you know,
[14:42.700 --> 14:47.380]  is not only the scientific part of it, but also the artistic part of it. And I
[14:47.380 --> 14:52.460]  think that's what helps influence, you know, my selections and, you know, what
[14:52.460 --> 14:57.780]  direction I go, because I don't want to be like everybody else. But, you know, at
[14:57.780 --> 15:05.260]  the same time, we have to be able to survive in this ever changing community.
[15:06.220 --> 15:11.540]  And it's changed tremendously over the past several years. It's built up, it's
[15:11.780 --> 15:16.620]  continued to grow. But there's a lot of a lot of changes happening in the
[15:16.620 --> 15:17.540]  background right now.
[15:18.140 --> 15:22.740]  Yeah. Yeah. And I think there's a way that, you know, if you do like land
[15:22.740 --> 15:25.580]  races, and you want to incorporate them into modern genetics, there's nothing
[15:25.620 --> 15:29.100]  wrong with that. I think that's the beauty of it is genetic diversity, trying
[15:29.100 --> 15:33.740]  to make something new. And it's really difficult to do. I mean, it pretty much
[15:34.940 --> 15:38.380]  everything we're doing is reinventing the wheel on one aspect or another. But
[15:38.380 --> 15:41.780]  that doesn't mean that we found everything there's just, you know, with
[15:41.820 --> 15:45.260]  the diversity, it's more diverse, as far as cannabis is more diverse than any
[15:45.260 --> 15:49.220]  other cultivated plant on the planet, you know, and we still haven't found
[15:49.220 --> 15:54.260]  everything, there's still other things to find other terpene profiles. You know,
[15:54.260 --> 15:59.260]  it's like, you know, we're exploring those gelatos and finding everything in
[15:59.260 --> 16:04.500]  the gelato on that side with the floral characteristics with the gas. And I
[16:04.500 --> 16:08.140]  think, you know, and then even, we were doing that a little bit with the
[16:08.140 --> 16:11.540]  Durban putting Durban and with the cookies and everything, you know,
[16:11.540 --> 16:16.060]  because that that really is that cherry and nice character that you know, we
[16:16.060 --> 16:19.500]  found in a bunch of stuff moving forward, which is also in the gelato
[16:19.500 --> 16:25.260]  line. But uh, what what is your go to as far as a cultivar right now?
[16:26.940 --> 16:32.500]  We're doing an evaluations on our planet Hulk, which is the Bruce banner
[16:32.780 --> 16:40.380]  across the the Indiana bubblegum. We, we have some really fun examples of moms
[16:40.380 --> 16:46.780]  and we've sampled some and we're growing out more right now. So we'll be
[16:46.780 --> 16:53.180]  narrowing down selections for another feminization here shortly. The
[16:53.180 --> 16:57.980]  raspberry boogies, of course, and then also the Mountain Dew Mountain Dews
[16:58.500 --> 17:05.660]  rather unique. That's a sour cush cross the pink 2.0 pink being from exotic
[17:05.660 --> 17:14.420]  Mike. That one is really been really come back in a strong way because there
[17:14.420 --> 17:20.220]  was a picture that was posted by a commercial grower in southern Oregon.
[17:20.620 --> 17:28.660]  And he's standing next to a tree, a marijuana tree and that was the the
[17:28.660 --> 17:34.780]  Mountain Dew Baja blast. This thing, he could not even reach you know, the top
[17:34.780 --> 17:41.980]  of the plant, the tree, saying yielded 13 pounds. It's all really super high
[17:41.980 --> 17:48.140]  quality. So we're going to work on a feminization of this and probably do
[17:48.140 --> 17:53.820]  some line extensions, do some outcross and see what we we come up with. But
[17:54.540 --> 18:01.900]  yeah, so those are the ones that we're working on right now. And yeah, excited
[18:01.900 --> 18:07.620]  about all of them. We've seen some really great phenos we've selected. So
[18:07.620 --> 18:13.660]  we narrowed down to about another 10 to 12 planet of moms. And there's one that
[18:13.660 --> 18:22.180]  is really stood out. Just a different type of this to me is we'll see how she
[18:22.180 --> 18:28.900]  finishes up but she's looking to be a unicorn just really special. I mean,
[18:28.900 --> 18:35.860]  does that grow like the other ones? And really tight nugs. So excited about that
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.340]  super excited about that.
[18:38.580 --> 18:43.500]  Awesome. So yes, someone in the chat wants me to ask you about your 10 year
[18:43.500 --> 18:48.820]  anniversary varieties. And if you could share anything on those.
[18:50.940 --> 18:54.340]  Anyone in particular that they're looking for info on?
[18:55.100 --> 18:59.460]  Well, they didn't say anything specific. I'm sure they'll chime in. But yeah,
[19:00.020 --> 19:07.620]  anniversary project. Well, so there's a, you know, when I started out, James, I did
[19:07.620 --> 19:15.540]  not start out to be a breeder. That was not my intention. I connected with Cinderella 99, you
[19:15.540 --> 19:22.340]  know, from Brothers Graham. And I just love this thing because it's very cerebral, but then had
[19:22.500 --> 19:30.020]  a really nice creative artistic side to her that, you know, I never wanted to lose that.
[19:31.380 --> 19:39.300]  That feeling. So I asked a very good friend of mine, Garrett slot who owned Magus genetics,
[19:39.300 --> 19:46.900]  a very close friend of mine, how I would go about keeping around by making seeds. And so
[19:46.900 --> 19:55.300]  he walked me through how to select a male, you know, which mom to keep, which is more obvious,
[19:55.300 --> 20:02.580]  so everybody knows, and then how to go about breeding them timing. You know, the number of
[20:02.580 --> 20:12.580]  plants, how to keep them healthy and really breed some good seed stock. And, and so I had all these
[20:12.580 --> 20:23.780]  seeds that I made. And he, Garrett said, I should share them with gypsy. So I sent him
[20:23.780 --> 20:33.300]  once over to the gypsy, and he gave him out his freebies off the seed bay. And one person in
[20:33.300 --> 20:40.980]  particular crazy composer who was senior editor of high times at the time. He hits, he had sent
[20:40.980 --> 20:46.020]  him some because he's really fond of the Cinderella 99, as well as gypsy, one of their favorite
[20:46.020 --> 20:55.780]  strengths. So he grew them out, did a blog on it. And he said that it was one of the best examples
[20:55.780 --> 21:03.380]  of Cinderella 99 he's ever grown. And all of a sudden, everybody wanted the seeds at that point.
[21:03.380 --> 21:11.940]  So I became a breeder. And so Cinderella is one of those strains that I've read for well over 10
[21:11.940 --> 21:22.740]  years. They still have her and tend to do a release later this year, or two. And, and the other one is
[21:22.740 --> 21:28.660]  the old time moonshine, full time moonshine, originally from DJ short, as we all know,
[21:28.660 --> 21:34.020]  he only released them for about six months, because the line had a lot of mutations in it.
[21:34.020 --> 21:43.060]  And so you know, it's a derivative of the blueberry line. And I grew this one out money, Mike sent me
[21:43.060 --> 21:54.340]  a pack and another pack donated from someone from IC mag, the website, and did selections through
[21:54.340 --> 22:05.460]  those and came up with what I felt to be the best parents. And the male was a sativa leaning male,
[22:05.460 --> 22:18.020]  very small, but very potent. And so you know, I've kept this cultivar alive and up till earlier this
[22:18.020 --> 22:24.180]  year, we don't we had seeds available. We'll re release some late this year, early next year.
[22:24.980 --> 22:32.340]  Just because I think people like, you know, those old school strains, and one that I'm very fond of,
[22:32.340 --> 22:39.780]  and has made some really nice crosses some hybrids. But a really great indica
[22:40.580 --> 22:50.020]  leaning plant, great coloration, leathery leaves, great flower, terpene profiles, very unique. I mean,
[22:50.020 --> 22:57.460]  all all the above. So yeah, so those two, I think are probably really the most well known
[22:57.460 --> 23:03.300]  of 10 year anniversary strains. Awesome. So yeah, just want to touch on something.
[23:03.300 --> 23:10.660]  DJ short, I got a lot of respect for DJ short, we were sitting together at a booth, selling seeds
[23:10.660 --> 23:16.900]  years ago. And he gave me a tip that I want to share with you guys. I was so you know,
[23:16.900 --> 23:23.860]  and this is like 2014. I was so excited about tissue culture. And he loves giving good tips.
[23:23.860 --> 23:28.180]  And so I said tissue culture, man, I got to get into tissue culture. super excited about doing
[23:28.180 --> 23:33.620]  tissue culture on my own, which I'm, for me, it's not my thing. I have friends that do amazing work
[23:33.620 --> 23:38.900]  with tissue culture. But his tip for tissue culture was, why do you need tissue culture
[23:38.900 --> 23:44.260]  when you can take your mom, get some clones, put those clones in the ground, grow those out
[23:44.260 --> 23:50.660]  and take fresh cuttings, it does the same exact thing. And to a degree, he's correct. You know,
[23:50.660 --> 23:55.140]  and I think for you guys that can't afford tissue culture, using the sun in the ground, he talks
[23:55.140 --> 24:00.580]  about the natural vibrations of the earth reviving, but regardless of how it works, I would
[24:00.580 --> 24:05.300]  say that putting your you know, you get vigorous growth, you put stuff in the ground, you give it
[24:05.300 --> 24:10.420]  a good diet. And you're going to get some amazing new growth where you can take clones and then
[24:10.420 --> 24:17.140]  you're going to re re vigorize your mothers. You know, I think that's a great tip. stuck with me
[24:17.140 --> 24:21.940]  all these years. And I love tissue culture, too. Don't get me wrong, especially we got Joe on here
[24:21.940 --> 24:27.220]  talking about hoplite and virus. We got my friend Justin from DSG and he does amazing work.
[24:28.660 --> 24:32.260]  But you know, when there's stuff that you have to clean up with tissue culture, you have to clean
[24:32.260 --> 24:36.340]  up with tissue culture. But if you're just trying to get some life back into your mom's
[24:36.340 --> 24:40.020]  a great way to do it would be put them in the sun and then get some new cuttings.
[24:42.260 --> 24:49.940]  And it's funny you should say that because just last week we put some plants outside that
[24:50.900 --> 24:57.460]  are healthy, but really need some invigoration. You know, putting them outside for at least a
[24:57.460 --> 25:04.500]  month really helps the plants so much, you know, and having not only the vibrations of the earth,
[25:04.500 --> 25:13.860]  but then also some of the extremes that Mother Nature gives the plants with strong winds,
[25:13.860 --> 25:19.540]  or you know, heat or cold nights, you know, that really, I think,
[25:20.660 --> 25:26.660]  brings a lot of life back into them. Yeah, so I just put a creme rosé skittles that was
[25:26.660 --> 25:31.460]  back crossed on to the skittles that I really love. I just took one of the moms and put it
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.780]  outside and it just hates it outside. So it doesn't work with every cultivar. This is a
[25:35.780 --> 25:41.380]  finicky little plant, man. And it just, it's a slow grower. It's just as finicky. It's more
[25:41.380 --> 25:47.860]  finicky than cookies or OG, but I love the turf profile. It's got a rose water with skittles and
[25:47.860 --> 25:53.620]  it's just absolutely amazing, but it does not like outside. In fact, it hates it and it's,
[25:53.620 --> 25:57.460]  it's just looking like it's about to die. But for the most part, that works great with every
[25:57.460 --> 26:01.380]  variety. And this is the perfect time of year because I'm in California, in Northern California,
[26:01.380 --> 26:07.140]  and it's like 70 degree days, gets 50s at night. So it's not a huge temperature swing. It should
[26:07.140 --> 26:14.740]  be perfect. But, you know, so for most kids it works great. Can I, can I, can I jump in there
[26:14.740 --> 26:20.740]  with an appropriate question for the two of you that came in? Let me just queue it up. Give me
[26:20.740 --> 26:33.280]  one second. So let me make that bigger. Outdoor growing. This is one of the topics
[26:33.280 --> 26:39.360]  that I was going to have on the trinity with Rick. Is it too late to grow your seeds outdoors? And
[26:39.360 --> 26:44.240]  you're doing auto flower as well. So let's talk a little bit about planting season. You know,
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.400]  I know a lot of people secure their seeds in January, but it's really dependent on where you
[26:48.400 --> 26:56.480]  live. I think that's the answer. Exactly, Jake. And it's interesting because one thing that I
[26:56.480 --> 27:02.400]  learned about growing outdoors years ago, I went to visit a breeder, Steve in Switzerland,
[27:03.040 --> 27:11.600]  when he was in Lugano. And I went to help him harvest. And it was interesting because Steve
[27:11.600 --> 27:19.600]  said they just put these plants out by the end of July. And it was late September. I was there
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.160]  and we were going to start harvesting. These plants were a good six feet tall, big round,
[27:24.720 --> 27:34.160]  a six foot wide bushes with just these massive holes on them. And he Steven said they put them
[27:34.160 --> 27:42.720]  out. Probably they were like a foot or two clones outdoors by the end of July. And they still grew
[27:42.720 --> 27:50.960]  out to be six foot tall and wide bushes that needed to be staked with big wood,
[27:51.840 --> 28:00.560]  like one by twos in order to hold these massive brushes up. But if you can do that,
[28:01.840 --> 28:08.720]  you can definitely do that here in the Midwest. And so, you know, especially with autos, autos,
[28:08.720 --> 28:16.160]  you know, most of them, a lot of them are 70 days, 75, 80 days. But, you know,
[28:16.640 --> 28:22.640]  you know, you can still do them here. You can do them really all across the country,
[28:22.640 --> 28:28.880]  you know, outdoors. And there's a lot of commercial growers that are switching to
[28:28.880 --> 28:38.160]  feminized auto flowers outdoors because they finish so quickly. And it's, you know, the
[28:38.160 --> 28:45.600]  quantity and they still get a really good yield, very easy to finish in a short amount of time.
[28:47.120 --> 28:47.520]  Awesome.
[28:52.240 --> 28:53.840]  Okay, can you read that?
[28:54.960 --> 28:57.040]  You want to talk about your line of auto flowers?
[28:57.680 --> 28:58.080]  Sorry.
[28:59.040 --> 29:07.120]  The white line of autos are doing really well. We get so much positive feedback on them.
[29:07.760 --> 29:16.160]  The, I think it's really about the selection in working with a very close friend on these
[29:16.160 --> 29:25.040]  auto flowers that they have produced. And, you know, we white label them and they're doing
[29:25.040 --> 29:31.520]  extremely well. You know, people like the ease and especially for a lot of new growers that are
[29:31.520 --> 29:38.320]  coming to market, they like the fact that they're feminized. So you don't have to, you know,
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.600]  call any males and, you know, in states where they have a limit of flower plants,
[29:44.480 --> 29:52.480]  that helps them adhere to the regulation. And also, you know, something that's going to finish
[29:52.480 --> 30:00.880]  that quickly, 70 days, you know, start to finish, I think that's tremendous. And so they can actually
[30:00.960 --> 30:10.080]  see the finishing of plants on an accelerated basis. You know, Jeff Lonefells, who wrote the
[30:10.080 --> 30:19.600]  book, Do Yourself Auto Flowers. He's also the author of the Teeming With books. He says that
[30:20.400 --> 30:29.600]  auto flowers are the modern tomato. The reason for this is that very seldom does something that's
[30:29.600 --> 30:40.560]  revolutionary like a tomato or an auto flower come along. And what makes these auto flowers so
[30:40.560 --> 30:49.360]  different is the fact that, you know, they have root aralis and so they will flower on something
[30:49.360 --> 31:01.040]  different than just photo period. And so like a lot of you know, is auto flowers are flowered out
[31:02.160 --> 31:08.560]  by the taproot once that bottoms out. Tapology, I think somebody called it, which I thought was
[31:08.560 --> 31:19.840]  pretty kind of cool. And so that's what triggers it. So tremendous results now with a lot of
[31:19.840 --> 31:27.920]  breeding happening at a much higher level of botanists, like in California, have worked on
[31:27.920 --> 31:35.200]  many strains to really improve them and have really made a huge difference in the quality
[31:35.200 --> 31:43.280]  of the auto flower cultivars. So James, you're on? Oh, there you are.
[31:46.720 --> 31:50.640]  My laptop just died. It wasn't plugged into the wall. It was plugged into the
[31:51.680 --> 31:56.160]  plugged into the laptop, but the laptop wasn't plugged into the wall. So go figure. But yeah,
[31:56.160 --> 32:04.480]  we're back. Not sure how much of that you heard. But yeah, auto flowers are just a tremendous,
[32:04.480 --> 32:10.720]  really great for for new growers. Yeah, I feel like, you know, it's funny,
[32:10.720 --> 32:14.880]  because sometimes established growers that have been growing cannabis have problems growing out
[32:14.880 --> 32:20.160]  of because they don't treat it like a can like a regular photo period cannabis plant. And you need
[32:20.160 --> 32:26.800]  to treat it like an auto flower. You know, I do some breeding large scale. I do bulk seed sales
[32:26.800 --> 32:32.800]  as well. And so some of the guys that I work with are, you know, the best ones are actually tomato
[32:32.800 --> 32:38.960]  farmers. You know, because, you know, row crop farmers tend to treat them all the same. And they,
[32:38.960 --> 32:42.720]  you know, it's not that they don't need a lot of love, but they don't need the same amount of
[32:43.600 --> 32:50.560]  attention that you need for a traditional cannabis plant photo period. So the guys that can do them,
[32:50.560 --> 32:53.600]  like, you know, at scale, the guys that are the best are the tomato farmers.
[32:55.760 --> 32:59.280]  So yeah, let's see, we got all kinds of stuff in the chat here.
[32:59.360 --> 33:05.520]  James just came back. Hold on, I was trying, there was a relevant question. Now I just lost it. I had
[33:05.520 --> 33:12.640]  it up for a second. You know, I think I'll just go until you can find it. But someone says,
[33:12.640 --> 33:17.680]  Femmes and autos, what a drag. I think there's great things with Femmes and autos, just like
[33:17.680 --> 33:21.360]  there is, I don't think anything should be overlooked. I think that regular seeds are
[33:21.360 --> 33:27.520]  amazing. Working with regular seeds are great. If you want to do it. I think there's advantages
[33:27.600 --> 33:33.440]  to working with autos and not everything is for everybody. And, you know, I wouldn't knock
[33:33.440 --> 33:41.360]  one or the other. You want to look in there? How do you select auto flowers for breeding?
[33:42.560 --> 33:50.560]  What upcoming quality auto flower breeders would you recommend? Man, I would say Mosca.
[33:51.040 --> 33:59.120]  I would recommend Mosca. But as far as for selections for myself, how I do selections
[33:59.760 --> 34:04.640]  is I look for, you know, so basically with auto flowers, if you're bringing an auto in a photo,
[34:04.640 --> 34:10.160]  you've got to breed them together. And then you got to go back three, four generations before
[34:10.160 --> 34:16.160]  you can really sell that auto flower seed. And each generation you're breeding and looking for
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.960]  something specific. And sometimes those projects can go in different directions. You can find
[34:20.960 --> 34:27.760]  multiple things and breed towards those goals. But what I'm looking for is structure. But first
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.920]  and foremost, it's always terpene profile. You know, if you're working with a big enough
[34:31.920 --> 34:35.600]  progeny of plants, you're selecting because you don't get to keep your mother alive. So
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.960]  you're really looking for something that has a amazing turf profile first. So you're looking
[34:40.960 --> 34:47.280]  for that nose and then you start going for structure, finishing time, obviously bug resistance
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.760]  and all that stuff. Like if you have problems, you know, I stress test my plants as well.
[34:51.760 --> 34:57.600]  So stress testing is important. And then growing those out, you know, you're going through
[34:58.560 --> 35:04.960]  multiple generations and also testing each one out. So the stuff takes years to actually do
[35:04.960 --> 35:11.600]  correctly. But as far as point breeders that are doing, I think Mandalorian's got some really cool
[35:11.600 --> 35:17.360]  stuff. I think Moscow's got some good stuff. Of course, Mephisto, they're the OGs of the industry.
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.840]  You know, there's tons of guys.
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.480]  Uh, Daz, Night Owl is doing some really good work as well.
[35:28.160 --> 35:32.480]  Yeah. So there's lots of, uh, there's lots of interesting choices and people are really
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.160]  pushing the limit on what you can do with autos. They've gotten to a place where I never thought
[35:36.160 --> 35:41.920]  they would 10 years ago, more than that now, but 10 years ago when I saw them in Europe, I was
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.360]  really disappointed with autoflowers that had never worked with them. You guys probably heard
[35:45.360 --> 35:51.120]  the story a million times from me, but you know, I just keep getting, you know, year by year, more
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.320]  impressed by the direction autoflowers have gone in and the quality product that it produces.
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.200]  You know, I think we're getting stuff that's, you know, finishing in 55 to 60 days
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.760]  when it's optimal. I see, you know, some of my stuff is testing above 30% THC, which I never
[36:07.760 --> 36:13.200]  in my life would have thought possible that a plant from an auto flower could test that high,
[36:13.200 --> 36:20.720]  uh, terpenes or, you know, 5%, which, uh, I think is amazing. And this is under HPS lighting.
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.280]  So that's a little bit different than outdoor, but still, you know, I feel like we can get there
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.160]  um, as a whole and, you know, there's more and more people getting into it,
[36:30.160 --> 36:35.600]  better breeders getting into it. I just, I think, you know, if you, if you didn't like
[36:35.600 --> 36:40.080]  auto flowers in the past and you grew them out, I think now is the time to give them another try.
[36:41.920 --> 36:50.640]  Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Um, the auto flowers from like the low rider days, uh, they're so different
[36:50.640 --> 36:57.440]  now. Um, and I think really the knowledge of how to grow them properly too, has helped
[36:57.440 --> 37:01.760]  significantly, you know, because not only advancements in the breeding side of it,
[37:01.760 --> 37:08.960]  but also the cool, the level of growers, you know, um, uh, windy city, um, autos here,
[37:09.680 --> 37:18.240]  he did some really fine work, uh, here locally. And, um, you know, he's experimented with
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.320]  different types of feeding regimens, really pushing the plants eating wise, you know,
[37:24.320 --> 37:32.960]  use a nectar for shot soil, uh, with some teas, some instant teas, uh, like from culture biologics,
[37:32.960 --> 37:39.440]  we've had tremendous success with those. Um, and, uh, you know, supplementing with the, uh,
[37:39.440 --> 37:46.880]  the nectar calcium products, um, botanic assassin, uh, someone who I work with has put together some
[37:46.960 --> 37:56.240]  really, really smart recipes. Um, and, uh, you know, really kind of pushing what, uh, the plants
[37:56.240 --> 38:01.920]  can absorb because, you know, with, with auto flowers are growing so quickly that you want to
[38:01.920 --> 38:08.800]  make sure that the soil has a nutrients for bloom before they actually need it. And so when you're
[38:08.800 --> 38:16.480]  supercharged at soil, um, the plants are able to absorb it. And so, um, you know, trying to do
[38:17.280 --> 38:25.360]  some organic methods with some really, really strong organic, um, easily to uptake, uh,
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.280]  nutrients is really key to, uh, you know, be having some really successful auto flower pros.
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.600]  At least what we're finding. Yeah. Outdoors. I'm a big fan in, in, in, indoors of soil and amended
[38:37.600 --> 38:43.280]  soil and not using salts if possible, but you know, for breeding, I use cocoa. Um, I've been
[38:43.280 --> 38:46.960]  working with a company called veg bloom. You guys have probably heard of them. We're working
[38:46.960 --> 38:53.040]  on some recipes for specifically for autos and potentially for breeding. I think is another one
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.520]  that I've been working on their recipes. Uh, they've, they've done some experiments as well
[38:57.520 --> 39:04.160]  with the autos and, but yeah, I feel like if we go back to those low rider and early girl,
[39:04.160 --> 39:08.640]  especially early girl genetics, it's funny. Cause I got in some of those seeds and grown them out.
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.200]  And it's definitely the genetics that the problem lies within the genetics and the further away
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.480]  we get from those things, you know, capturing the trait that auto flower trait, but also going back,
[39:19.200 --> 39:25.680]  uh, someone says magic melon is fire. Magic melon is okay. In my opinion,
[39:26.320 --> 39:34.560]  magic melon has a tendency to, uh, shoot out intersexual traits. Um, you know, it's like,
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.200]  I was working on some magic melon projects and, you know, I'm working on a 45 day cultivar right
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.320]  now that, uh, photo period cultivar. And we're going to potentially work on that with autos as
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.680]  well. But right now we're just, uh, doing some selfing projects with it and seeing if we can
[39:49.680 --> 39:58.880]  produce something that selfs speak on the duration of auto seeds versus photo. Uh, the seed as far
[39:58.880 --> 40:02.400]  as the duration of how long the seeds will last, if you store them correctly, they should last a
[40:02.400 --> 40:09.200]  really long time. How do you start your crew? How about that? You know what, James, I do things a
[40:09.200 --> 40:17.760]  little bit differently. So, uh, I will take the, um, like the six by 10, uh, middle envelopes and
[40:17.760 --> 40:24.080]  we'll put, uh, seeds in those have them labeled and Mark. So that way we know what they are,
[40:24.080 --> 40:29.920]  obviously a little history on them. Um, and then we'll put them in the refrigerator between like,
[40:29.920 --> 40:40.400]  uh, 55, uh, 58 degrees. Um, and, uh, uh, we'll try to keep them in like plastic shoe boxes,
[40:40.400 --> 40:49.520]  just sitting in there lined up, uh, on a bed of, uh, rice. So, um, and as you know, uh, rice will
[40:49.520 --> 40:57.120]  act as a desiccant in case there's any moisture. Um, but that seems to preserve our seeds very well,
[40:57.440 --> 41:06.560]  especially with, um, uh, in botany class, uh, I had learned, uh, about, um, you know,
[41:06.560 --> 41:15.440]  seed some strains of some types of seeds need cold in order for them to, uh, properly germinate the
[41:15.440 --> 41:22.480]  following year. And so, you know, using that and keeping that in mind, that's why I moved to a
[41:22.480 --> 41:30.000]  refrigerator and, um, you know, folks always say that our strains, uh, germinate very quickly,
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.960]  you know, faster than a lot of other strains. And, uh, I kind of attribute to that to,
[41:35.600 --> 41:39.920]  you know, properly storing them in the refrigerator, give them a little cold.
[41:39.920 --> 41:45.040]  Um, and then, um, you know, they come out of hibernation and germinate as soon as they get
[41:45.040 --> 41:52.400]  that moisture and heat. So, yeah, stratification is amazing. My buddy Nick told me about stratification
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.120]  a couple of years ago. And, you know, if you have really fresh seeds, the best thing to do is put
[41:57.120 --> 42:03.600]  them in the freezer overnight before you germinate them. That's a good little trick. Um, you know,
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.840]  for me, we got some seeds right here. I have desiccants. These are fresh seeds. So as you guys
[42:09.840 --> 42:18.560]  can see, we got seeds with desiccant. Um, I store them in these bins, uh, to make sure they're fully
[42:18.560 --> 42:26.000]  dry because the last thing you want to do is put moist or wet seeds, seeds that have any moisture
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.680]  content in the refrigerator. Uh, you will take your germination rate down from a hundred percent
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.960]  to potentially 50 or below. And that happened with a good friend of mine. So do not refrigerate your
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.400]  seeds until they are fully dry and fully cured. And they could feel dry. They could feel cured,
[42:42.400 --> 42:49.120]  but, uh, you know, great way to ruin your, uh, amazing crop that you get all excited about. And,
[42:49.120 --> 42:54.400]  you know, people get in big fights and, you know, long-term enemies over that kind of stuff. It's
[42:54.400 --> 42:59.760]  really sad. Yeah. You can't rush the process, you know, the seeds there, they're ready when
[42:59.760 --> 43:07.920]  they're ready. And, uh, those never hurts to wait an extra week or two for sure. Yeah.
[43:12.560 --> 43:16.960]  You can buy a huge amount of those desiccant packs on Zon cheap and they are rechargeable.
[43:16.960 --> 43:23.600]  Just microwave them. Yeah. Do you see that question on the screen? Um, you know what,
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.560]  I don't, you're not going to see more regular auto seeds for me. I'm not doing regular auto
[43:28.560 --> 43:33.280]  seeds. I only do feminized. Uh, you can't keep the mother alive. There's, there's a lot of reasons,
[43:33.280 --> 43:40.000]  but it's easier. Uh, you know, when I'm doing smaller, I might use someone's, uh, regular,
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.280]  and then I'll breed, I'll breed it into a feminized line right away. Um, you know,
[43:45.280 --> 43:49.840]  there are advantages maybe as far as genetic stability, people will talk, but a lot of what
[43:49.840 --> 43:56.000]  we think of as genetic stability, uh, you know, that's something that can be bred in or out of a
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.480]  plant. So I think a lot of people were like, Oh man, hermaphrodites, you know, you get hermaphrodites
[44:00.480 --> 44:04.880]  with feminized seeds, you get hermaphrodites with regular seeds and, you know, in breeding
[44:05.680 --> 44:11.360]  plants that have those traits is going to cause more of it. So regular seeds, I think regular
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.520]  autos, that's nothing I'm going to be working on, but, uh, you know, I'm sure I think Mandalorian
[44:17.520 --> 44:23.520]  has regular autos and there are a bunch of people with regular autos out there. So 20 hours light,
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.640]  four hours of dark is optimal for autos indoors or outdoors. If you're in a place that has 20
[44:28.640 --> 44:32.720]  hours of light outdoors, that'd be ideal. The more light you give those plants, the better,
[44:33.600 --> 44:42.080]  uh, target PPM or EC just depends. Uh, like 2.25 is great. It's depending on the cultivar,
[44:42.640 --> 44:46.400]  uh, and depending on what you're using, because I feel like that can be all over the place.
[44:46.960 --> 44:53.680]  When you're talking about target EC, something like that, which is, that's what 1250. Uh,
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.800]  and it depends, you know, it's so dependent on the products you're using. And, you know,
[44:59.360 --> 45:02.400]  there's, there's so many things it depends on. What do you think about?
[45:03.920 --> 45:10.160]  Yeah, no, no. I think, uh, that's, it's pretty spot on, you know, as far as the number of hours,
[45:10.160 --> 45:18.880]  you know, 20, 24, um, a lot of people say, um, you know, I think 18, six also is a good
[45:18.880 --> 45:26.000]  alternative because we all know that the plants regenerate, you know, they actually get stronger
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.040]  at night. So they need some darkness. Um, so, you know, try both, see what works best for you,
[45:33.040 --> 45:41.680]  which, which, uh, outcome you like better. Well, in my opinion, the thing is I've done side by
[45:41.680 --> 45:47.280]  side. And in my opinion, I think the 20 hours of light with four hours of darkness is ideal for
[45:47.280 --> 45:55.360]  autos. Uh, it was, it was the difference of like almost, uh, almost 20% on the yield. So that's
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.000]  with side by side in the same exact environment, growing the same cultivar, you know, and there's
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.160]  other variables that could have affected it potentially, but I feel like I feel strongly
[46:04.160 --> 46:11.280]  that that 20 hours of light is more significant. Um, so that's just my take on it, but yeah,
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.760]  I have a lot of, well, it's too expensive and it's like, well, if it's too expensive to do 18,
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.880]  you can do 12. You're just not going to get as full of bud. I mean, I feel like the buds don't
[46:20.880 --> 46:26.000]  fill out quite as much on 12. You notice a significant difference on that 20 hours of light
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.640]  indoor. I mean, it looks just as good as any other, you know, it doesn't look like auto flower in my
[46:30.640 --> 46:44.610]  opinion. Yeah. Yeah. How many, how many cultivars though? I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[46:45.650 --> 46:55.900]  Um, so someone, you can answer that. And then someone, uh, if you want to get the soul seeker
[46:55.900 --> 46:59.740]  question, we'll answer that next, uh, Peter about silver,
[47:04.520 --> 47:12.520]  the alien wedding, uh, keeper, the unicorn Fino, you know what, honestly, to me, I think it's,
[47:12.520 --> 47:19.720]  which is your favorite plant, you know, do the selection pop the whole pack. And, uh, you know,
[47:19.720 --> 47:27.560]  our, our packs come 12 seeds to a pack. So on average, you'll get six females, do your selection
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.720]  on those females and which one you like best, because, you know, we like to say there's a
[47:31.720 --> 47:37.720]  keeper in every pack and, uh, you know, some people there's multiple keepers and find out
[47:37.720 --> 47:44.920]  which one you like best. Cause you know, yes. Um, as a breeder, you know, I have an ideal,
[47:44.920 --> 47:51.160]  but what's best for you, my ideal may be different than the growers. So, you know, what, what is it,
[47:51.720 --> 47:55.400]  which is the mom that may is most special to you is what I'm trying to say.
[47:55.960 --> 48:01.560]  Yeah. I think for the most part, and depending on your environment,
[48:02.120 --> 48:07.160]  one cultivar could be different than another, you know, as far as even within a progeny,
[48:07.160 --> 48:09.960]  you can have one that's going to grow better in one environment than another.
[48:12.280 --> 48:17.800]  So, yeah. And I think, you know, one of the other things to mention is, uh, you know,
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.000]  to make the plant fully expressed, that's how you're going to be able to tell what the best
[48:23.720 --> 48:30.120]  version of that, that crosses. You know, I think a lot of people are not saying anything bad about
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.200]  a lot of growers, but I think a lot of people are mediocre when it comes to growing, uh, and
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.880]  they're not making the plants express. So to a degree, it doesn't matter just to a lot of people.
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.760]  Unfortunately, I think people really pick up their game when they're doing phenoselections. And
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.560]  that's, that's what makes a big difference with some of the best. I saw karma genetics. It looks
[48:49.560 --> 48:54.760]  like karma's on here, but guys like karma where like, he knows how to make the plant express that
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.760]  guy got gas into his seed lines, you know, before anybody that really pushed a whole, whole bunch of
[49:00.760 --> 49:07.960]  gas. Um, so yeah, it's, it's all about making your plants express. Uh, Rick, I think you're muted.
[49:08.760 --> 49:09.400]  Oh, okay.
[49:11.480 --> 49:11.960]  What was that?
[49:12.920 --> 49:13.480]  Now you're on mute.
[49:14.600 --> 49:23.400]  Uh, uh, karma, he is a master at making his plants express themselves, man. Just, uh, that guy just
[49:23.400 --> 49:29.240]  produces fire. He's a good, uh, good friend and, uh, definitely someone to look up to.
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.960]  Totally. Yeah. He's all about that gas. You know, it's a, you know, and then sour, I think,
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.040]  you know, sour is something that I, you know, there's a handful of people that have worked
[49:40.040 --> 49:46.200]  with sour. I was doing the sour BX. I think originally I was the first one back in, we were
[49:46.200 --> 49:53.000]  releasing seeds in 2010, 2011 of our sour, our original, that was a sour cross. And then the
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.120]  back cross. Um, but it's like, sour is a tricky plant to work with. You gotta be patient. Uh, and
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.080]  you know, I feel like the traits that you're looking for are elusive. So you really need
[50:05.080 --> 50:09.800]  somebody who knows how to grow, to get them express, to express properly. So you can find
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.920]  those traits, you know, and that's, that's the difference between the guys that are just, you
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.160]  know, making seeds and the guys that are really putting in the work and really making amazing
[50:19.160 --> 50:23.640]  seeds. I feel like it's all about getting that expression. So you can do a proper phenol hunt.
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.000]  Cause if you can't make them express, you can't do a proper phenol.
[50:27.720 --> 50:35.800]  Yeah, exactly. And it's really about, you know, finding, um, the plants that really match up to
[50:35.800 --> 50:43.080]  what you think is superior, uh, selection or superior female male to work with. Um, because,
[50:43.880 --> 50:52.840]  you know, um, it's that hunt, uh, that really leads you to those plants that will help you,
[50:53.640 --> 51:01.400]  um, deliver, you know, the, the cultivar, the offspring that you're trying to share with, uh,
[51:01.400 --> 51:06.440]  the growers who are growing your seeds. And I think that's really key because, you know, the,
[51:07.880 --> 51:14.280]  the greater success they have, uh, I think that's the greatest, greatest success that we could have.
[51:16.440 --> 51:22.440]  Definitely. Yeah. So let's touch on some, we got a bunch of questions in the chat, which I love.
[51:23.240 --> 51:30.760]  Um, do you see that one? How does heavy feeding affect full expression? Um, I feel like you go
[51:30.760 --> 51:34.520]  lighter feeding. If you want full expression, if you want bigger yields, you use heavy feeding.
[51:35.160 --> 51:39.960]  Um, but you know, that's, again, that's individual. You know, what I consider light
[51:39.960 --> 51:45.800]  feeding is what, you know, it might be the opposite with people. So it's such an individual
[51:45.800 --> 51:50.680]  thing. There's, you know, 70 days in the life of that plant. And there's so many different
[51:50.680 --> 51:56.280]  feeding regimens and things you can do to make it expressed differently. And you can be successful
[51:56.280 --> 52:01.720]  on several different levels. So the best thing for guys that are just starting out is, you know,
[52:01.720 --> 52:07.480]  follow one person's recipe, continue with that instead of taking advice from 20 different people,
[52:07.480 --> 52:11.080]  which happens all the time. You know, you go in and you hear, Oh, I need to add this. I need to
[52:11.080 --> 52:16.360]  add that, man. I would start off with something super basic and just follow a recipe off the
[52:16.360 --> 52:23.080]  bottles. If I was starting over, you know, if that was me, um, I don't even know how we led
[52:23.080 --> 52:31.320]  into that, but, you know, it's funny that, uh, it's true. I think going lighter, you'll get a
[52:31.320 --> 52:36.600]  better expression of the plant, um, because you're avoiding a lot of issues, you know,
[52:36.600 --> 52:45.960]  toxicity or feeding, which is never a good thing for plants. Um, and, um, I think by, by feeding
[52:45.960 --> 52:54.760]  light, I tend generally, or, uh, think of a half of what the manufacturer is recommending, uh,
[52:54.760 --> 53:01.320]  half to three quarter. Um, but, uh, and what was talking about, how do you feed into the detriment
[53:01.400 --> 53:08.440]  to kids? It is very, very cultivar specific. So, you know, it's like saying one thing, it's like
[53:08.440 --> 53:13.240]  saying blue dream. It's not going to express as well as if you feed it heavy. I will tell you that
[53:13.240 --> 53:17.480]  as a fact, I feel like blue dream, you can just keep feeding it and feeding it and feeding it.
[53:17.480 --> 53:22.920]  You can bump that EC up really high and it'll take it and it's going to express better. Uh,
[53:22.920 --> 53:29.960]  thank you, Mr. Toad, a hundred percent correct on that. Um, but yeah, it's, it's very cultivar
[53:29.960 --> 53:36.280]  specific. And I think a lot of people have lost the factor or are missing the cue on the fact that
[53:36.280 --> 53:40.760]  you need to learn how to treat each cultivar and feed each cultivar differently. You can't grow a
[53:40.760 --> 53:46.840]  room of 15 plants and expect them all to be optimal. It's just not going to happen. You know,
[53:46.840 --> 53:50.920]  especially if you're doing a drip irrigation, if you're hand feeding and you're adjusting,
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.040]  you know, each plant to give it exactly what it needs. That's one thing. But, uh, you know,
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.200]  these cultivars all require different things and some of them might need more nitrogen,
[54:00.920 --> 54:06.840]  you know, going into flower and some of them need less. And then, you know, we got real finicky
[54:06.840 --> 54:11.720]  plants that they have to have the perfect balance. You know, I think if you look at it, you know,
[54:11.720 --> 54:17.640]  good OG, good OG, it's one of the most difficult plants to grow successfully and get a good
[54:17.640 --> 54:24.360]  harvest every time. Uh, you know, I had master Yoda on my show a while back, he grows killer OG.
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.400]  And it's like, one thing with OG is it's finicky. You give it too much. It doesn't like it. You
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.280]  don't give it enough. It pisses you get pissed off at the plant. It gets pissed off at you. It's just,
[54:34.280 --> 54:40.200]  it's a tough thing to dial in. But once you dial it in, you get amazing flower. You look at Josh D
[54:40.200 --> 54:46.360]  and the stuff Josh is doing, uh, you know, coming full circle with karma. And then we got Josh,
[54:46.360 --> 54:52.600]  Josh and his OGs, man. He's really dialed in OGs over the years to get them to express to their
[54:52.600 --> 54:59.160]  full potential all the time. So, and he has greenhouses full of OGs and it's all amazing.
[54:59.720 --> 55:02.440]  So, yeah, pretty true. Yep.
[55:06.430 --> 55:15.150]  So yeah, it's NPK, but it's also, uh, it's also calcium, magnesium, and all the micros. It's not
[55:15.150 --> 55:21.790]  just one thing and NPK dialing that in obviously is super important, but some plants need more
[55:21.790 --> 55:27.870]  calcium and magnesium than others. And, you know, as a breeder, I I'll put 12 varieties in a room
[55:27.870 --> 55:33.310]  and I have to find something that works, you know, for everything. Okay. When I'm making seeds,
[55:33.310 --> 55:39.390]  you know, and that's the difficult part. Um, you know, and then trying to adjust stuff by hand,
[55:39.390 --> 55:46.350]  it's really difficult. Oh yeah. Let's see. We've got so many good questions guys.
[55:47.070 --> 55:54.350]  Hey, so James, on top of that, um, not only the, uh, uh, you know, the major, uh, nutrients and,
[55:54.350 --> 55:58.830]  uh, some of the minor ones, but then also the trace and micronutrients, I think are very key
[55:58.830 --> 56:04.910]  as well. You know, we use green aminos from, uh, GreenGrowth biologicals, and that's just superior.
[56:04.910 --> 56:12.750]  It has two types of seaweeds in it, uh, as well as, um, some, uh, um, crustacean shells,
[56:12.750 --> 56:19.870]  just really, really plants love it. Uh, we use fish shit, um, as well. Um, and then we use,
[56:19.870 --> 56:26.830]  uh, uh, a couple of different types of, of mycos, um, because I think the mycorrhizae,
[56:26.830 --> 56:34.750]  uh, are really, really, uh, beneficial and kind of a pond there, but, uh, um, it is true because
[56:34.830 --> 56:43.790]  we'll do it at, uh, um, a transplant, um, and then we'll water it in with, um, our once a week teas
[56:44.350 --> 56:51.550]  and we'll go super heavy, uh, on the mycos and the plants, you know, within an hour or two
[56:51.550 --> 56:57.950]  are praying those leaves are just loving, you know, that, uh, that once a week, uh, feeding.
[56:58.030 --> 57:02.110]  So definitely worth the time and investment to do that.
[57:02.990 --> 57:08.750]  Yeah. I used hum tea for years. Used to make it with Alaskan hummus. Used to do the hum tea and,
[57:08.750 --> 57:14.030]  uh, you know, make it with, take my wife's nylons and make tea in a five gallon bucket with a
[57:14.030 --> 57:20.590]  bubbler. Good stuff. Um, yeah, there's, and then again, there's so many different approaches,
[57:20.590 --> 57:25.630]  you know, you find something and you slowly dial it in and mammoth pee and recharge your
[57:25.630 --> 57:29.230]  front of you. Somebody said that that's great. I think all these things.
[57:30.030 --> 57:31.710]  Someone's rocking the mammoth hat.
[57:34.350 --> 57:34.850]  Yeah.
[57:40.670 --> 57:45.390]  Yeah. And so now let's talk about breeding for a little bit with your, uh, feed regimen.
[57:45.390 --> 57:50.190]  I tend to go with a little more, if mine's higher through with nitrogen throughout. And then,
[57:50.190 --> 57:54.990]  so typically on a 70 day cultivar, I'll bring that cultivar if I'm making seeds,
[57:55.630 --> 57:59.630]  you know, where I'm basically putting my donors in it, like the three and a half,
[57:59.630 --> 58:03.310]  four week point, I'll take those for a full a hundred days in flower, which is
[58:03.870 --> 58:09.390]  long past the typical life cycle of that plant. So I'll give it nitrogen. And I basically, uh,
[58:09.390 --> 58:14.270]  use this Greenstone powdered fish product and I'll spray it's the worst thing indoors. Everybody
[58:14.270 --> 58:19.870]  hates it. Luckily I'm not growing in my house, but my wife would kill me, but I basically take
[58:19.870 --> 58:26.110]  the fish. It's basically a, yeah, I tie in nitrogen. I take it and I spray it. It gets
[58:26.110 --> 58:30.590]  sprayed every, the plants get sprayed really light mist every couple of days. And it keeps them
[58:30.590 --> 58:36.110]  really green for another 30 days. And you can tell when they start to yellow naturally that that's
[58:36.110 --> 58:42.750]  when the seeds are done. So what kind of tricks do you use for getting your, your a little bit
[58:42.750 --> 58:49.390]  longer? Yeah. Well, you know, one thing is using a larger container for the moms. You know,
[58:49.390 --> 58:55.630]  typically, you know, I used to use a three to five. Yeah. Honestly, I like a six or seven gallon
[58:55.630 --> 59:04.350]  container because I find that they will grow a larger and produce more, um, more seeds,
[59:04.350 --> 59:10.750]  more Keen's. But, uh, so that is, it was one thing that really helps, but then also,
[59:10.830 --> 59:18.110]  uh, kind of like what you said, uh, keeping more of this full strength nutrient longer in the
[59:18.110 --> 59:24.750]  flowering cycle and not to rush them. You know, a lot of times, uh, cultivars are, you know, um,
[59:25.630 --> 59:34.510]  um, seven, eight week cultivars, um, taking them 10, 12 weeks, uh, with full strength nutrient,
[59:34.510 --> 59:42.350]  keeping them greened up so they can brew produce more healthier, uh, seeds. Um, and then also,
[59:43.470 --> 59:50.910]  what we've done is we've bred underneath the led lights. Next light, uh, is all we use. And, um,
[59:51.710 --> 59:58.030]  you know, the, the plants just have done very well underneath those, uh, several years ago,
[59:58.030 --> 01:00:04.430]  when I first started using the next lights, uh, I compared the megas versus the high pressure
[01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:11.470]  sodiums, um, and, uh, the six hundreds that we use in thousands and they didn't skip a beat.
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:19.150]  I mean, they did, they produced a higher quality seed to where we had less white immature seeds.
[01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:27.230]  And so the, the total overall seed count was higher under the next light megas. So, um,
[01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:31.550]  yeah, that's all we use right now. Yeah. It's really interesting. I've been
[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:36.670]  experimenting with spectrum and having, you know, I had problems with my LEDs jumping into the
[01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:44.830]  fluence TIs for my breeding project on a big one. And, uh, you know, adding some red spectrum in
[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:54.190]  there with your LEDs is a great thing. HPS though, for reversals is key. Um, I'm a huge fan. So yeah.
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:02.190]  Well, let's see. We had a, uh, let me just cue up. This is from a while ago, uh, from
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:08.920]  Chad Westport. Uh, let me, but you can read that, right?
[01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:20.890]  What, um, my selection of the Cinderella 99 was from original brothers, grim stock. I went
[01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:28.410]  through five different families. I use Wally ducks. I use some of gypsies, uh, F2s of the
[01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:35.050]  brothers, grim, um, uh, but overall five different families. And I did my selection
[01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:44.650]  on those males and females that I liked the best, the ones that were closest to the pineapple Fino
[01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:52.650]  of the Cinderella 99, which is what, uh, to me was more of the unicorn versus the grapefruit,
[01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:59.290]  um, Fino that, you know, most people would get out of the Cinderella 99. So I bred for that
[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:07.610]  pineapple. Um, so I did not do the P1 selections like, um, you know, the brothers, grim did it.
[01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:16.810]  I did it, um, mainly off of, uh, the parental stock that I found, uh, from brothers, grim,
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:25.690]  Wally duck gypsy Nirvana and a couple of others. So, um, but, and then I worked with those males
[01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:34.570]  and females that, uh, were more like the pineapple. So stemmer up on a male or one that, uh, was,
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:41.770]  um, built, uh, very similar in structure to the females is something that I look for and,
[01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:51.370]  uh, did back then. And so now, um, with my Cinderella, um, we, there is the pineapple
[01:02:51.370 --> 01:03:01.450]  selection that, uh, you know, I bred over the years. Awesome. That's great, man. So, uh,
[01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.890]  yeah. Are you smoking today, Rick? How's it going?
[01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:12.490]  Not yet, but, uh, I got the peak. So you know what? I got my, I got the peak too, right here,
[01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:21.530]  you know, but you know, was this scripted and not at all. It's funny because I know
[01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:27.610]  James likes to take some token up while, uh, he's on the show. So I came prepared Peter.
[01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:32.730]  So today I wanted to show you guys was, uh, you know, I've switched away from my peak.
[01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:38.570]  I love my peak, Rick, love the peak. I've been using it pretty hard for the last couple of years,
[01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:43.050]  but I got this rig and somebody got me to go back. I can't even remember who it was, but OG Steve,
[01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:48.650]  my buddy got me on cold start dabs. And somebody the other day said, man, cold start dabs are
[01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:53.530]  really the way to go. They taste way better than the puff code. I said, no way. Cause I'd been
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:59.290]  smoking the puff gopher, you know, years, but, uh, I went back to the cold start and now I'm,
[01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.890]  I'm hooked again on the cold start. I got some of the bird extract right here.
[01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:09.530]  We've got some live Ross and lemon head Skittles and how the cold start. If you guys don't know a
[01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:14.730]  lot about cold start, you get a really good trip hit off it. So you take your.
[01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.890]  And why actually can you, can you angle your camera down slightly?
[01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:21.130]  I can, let's see. I want to drop it.
[01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:26.890]  It's like when I talk to my dad on FaceTime and I only get his forehead and above.
[01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:32.250]  Yeah. So we're going to take the cold. And then what we're going to do is we're going to heat
[01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:40.810]  this up with the torch. It's like that for about four or five seconds. You're going to see just a
[01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:52.850]  tiny little bit of smoke. You guys don't even see me blowing out smoke. I bet, but it's turbo
[01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:57.810]  overload. And that's one of the things I loved about the peak, but this is even stronger of a
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:02.450]  turpid chirping profile. You don't hit it or you don't get enough of a hit. You just see that for
[01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:13.040]  a couple more seconds. And you can see the extra bubble there. And this is much better. Like I
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:20.640]  used to do really hot dabs and much better in your throat smoking this way. I really enjoy
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.240]  smoking it with the, you know, especially at night. I feel like the difference with dabs as
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.560]  opposed to flour for me, I feel like extract, you know, I like both. I love big joints. That's what
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:40.640]  my go-to is smoking joints. But I would say that dabs are really clear. They, I get a clear eye
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:46.640]  from doing extract, smoking extract gives me more of a clean, crisp high. And I would say that
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.080]  smoking joints makes me more relaxed. And that's cultivar dependent too, though, because I can
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.560]  smoke some haze and I'll be all wired up if I smoke a joint, heart palpitations and everything.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.200]  But yeah, it's just cold start dabs, man. I love it. You guys, if you're not doing cold start dabs,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:09.680]  I hope you get a rig and you start doing them. It's fantastic. You can't go wrong. And it actually
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.760]  makes your ego go a lot further. So you start doing cold start dabs, you start doing cold start
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.080]  dabs. So you start with the terpenes. You don't get as high doing the cold start. You just got to
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:29.760]  do a lot more of them. Look like no smoke is coming out, I think, of the screen. But yeah,
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.000]  I'm getting amazing taste, guys. Real skittly, delicious.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.040]  Okay. Over to our other dab correspondent, Rick in Illinois.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.160]  Please tell us about your dab.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:50.640]  Okay. So this is what I'm enjoying right now. This is a terra petra, the rosin that a friend
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:07:01.520]  had put together for me. And terra petra is one of our feminized seeds. And we're going to
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.320]  heat up the Peak Pro here to kind of get this thing. Oh, there we go.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:13.200]  So these pros are great. They're Bluetooth. And they're so convenient.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:36.430]  But yeah, the much better than the last version. So smooth. Wow. Yeah, no, that's definitely
[01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:37.550]  definitely
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:46.030]  nice. This is what I'm working on. I got some Acapulco gold right here. These are some Acapulco
[01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.990]  gold seed. I don't know if you can tell the size of these seeds are humongous. As opposed to
[01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:57.070]  these tiny seeds right here. It might be a little hard for you guys to tell. But these are like
[01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:01.950]  double sized seeds, these Acapulco golds. And we're doing some vino hunts with them right now.
[01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:11.710]  They are I think they weigh point 03 as opposed to like point 017. So literally almost double
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:18.430]  the size. And so I'm working with some Acapulco, we got some Oaxacan, some Mexican stuff, and then
[01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:22.910]  got some interesting Colombian varieties that we're going to be working with really soon.
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:29.070]  So are you working on flowering time on those? Have you finished any of them yet?
[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:33.310]  Oh, no, I'm sure the flowering time is going to be quite a bit longer, but that's okay.
[01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:39.470]  So we're pollinating as well. So we're gonna be pollinating branches and see what we get. And
[01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:44.270]  then, you know, one thing I've been doing that if you guys are breeding and you want to get
[01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:49.230]  scientific with it, and don't want to spend too much money, but you want to, you know, terpene
[01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:54.590]  profile and cannabinoid profile, the best way to do it is to pollinate branches and then have plant
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:09:00.590]  materials saved. So you can test that plant material. Now, if you're talking about sequencing,
[01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.630]  you can save that plant material for a long time with those seeds. So if you don't have the money
[01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:09.710]  right now, you can do it down the road. But make sure to save a little bit of plant material when
[01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:15.950]  you do your breeding projects. I think it's a great idea. Justin, definitely.
[01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:20.030]  Anything else from the chat, Peter?
[01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:32.630]  Well, I just want to say, because I know you're into your MMA, James, I've been training.
[01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.270]  Sorry, I'm about to start training, but I got the...
[01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:42.230]  Oh, wait, what is it?
[01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:45.190]  Peter, log pipes.
[01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:46.310]  Peter, log pipes.
[01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:49.590]  That's from Onyx.
[01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.990]  Love it, love it.
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:57.270]  Yeah, it's funny because I got in my office, I got my winning boxing gloves. So we'll have to box
[01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.390]  on one of these shows, Peter.
[01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:09.910]  Why not? I thought it'd be cool to do like an FCP charity boxing, I mean, maybe like in a couple,
[01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:17.910]  maybe end of summer, early fall, SoCal, NorCal. We'll find a venue and get a whole bunch of...
[01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:25.430]  I want to do the FCP golf invitational and it doesn't matter how good or bad you are at golf.
[01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.190]  I think we should do blindfolded boxing.
[01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:33.110]  Or tag team boxing.
[01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:34.230]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.910]  So we had, and by the way, you guys are...
[01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:51.510]  I think Rick should give away some seeds, but we need to think of a good trivia question.
[01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:53.830]  I think so too.
[01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:55.190]  I'll give away some seeds.
[01:10:55.190 --> 01:11:01.750]  So I always go in the sports direction and Boston sports and people who don't watch sports hate
[01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:06.870]  that. So are there, if you guys can off the cuff, think of a good like
[01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:16.150]  breeding trivia question. And I guess we got to, we need to implement like a, Rick, let me just
[01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:21.510]  mute you because I'm getting the feedback, but we need to implement like a, because whenever we have
[01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:27.510]  to monitor the chat to see who answers first and then someone complains that they answered first,
[01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:32.070]  like a split second ahead of someone else. And we get the headache of having to deal with that.
[01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:37.910]  Yeah, it was tough. I had to give away seeds to people that didn't win because I wasn't sure.
[01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:41.990]  So I gave away to see you guys know I gave seeds to everybody. So it's going to, you know,
[01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.950]  one trivia question for now.
[01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:48.070]  This is like modern day little kids where everyone's a winner.
[01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:49.130]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.790]  I have a question that I think should be pretty simple to answer.
[01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:59.750]  So is it, is this like a first person to answer correctly question?
[01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.970]  Yes.
[01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:07.270]  All right. So let me look at, and everybody in the chat can help verify who answered first.
[01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.630]  Here we go.
[01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:19.270]  Okay. So James has a preferred number of hours of daylight versus night. What is that
[01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:23.670]  timeframe that he prefers for feminized auto flowers?
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.560]  They got to, oh God.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.280]  Did you see it?
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.400]  Yep. We got about 50 of them. Now we got to find the top one.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.920]  It was at nine.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.200]  Was 20 correct? Cause there are about four.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.800]  You know, man, man, it looks like he was the first one. Unless you guys see.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.280]  Can man, Dan.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:11.360]  Okay. So do we all, does, does anybody in the chat dispute can man, Dan answering first?
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.520]  Oh no, he did. I can see it right here, Peter.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.120]  I, I, I, I agree with you, but sometimes that's not good enough for people.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:20.500]  Yeah.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.880]  All right. We have a quorum. Can man, Dan is the one.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.380]  Okay.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:26.500]  All right.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.780]  And give them a pack of Mountain Dew Via Blast.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:43.740]  So yeah, I have seeds available on dagget.love and also on seeds here now officially. So
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.100]  I'm going to give away a gift certificate to get seeds from seeds here now and a gift
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:57.340]  certificate to get seeds from dagget.love. So you're going to get a gift certificate in the
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:01.900]  mail rather than seeds. And then you can get, with that gift certificate, there'll be a code
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.540]  where you can order any of my seeds for free. One pack.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.020]  Two cups.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:15.180]  And by mail, we mean via email. We can do that digitally. We can make that happen without
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:24.140]  send out a physical gift certificate. All right. So but you need, you need a, we need a winner.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:27.980]  So we need a question. Does that, do either of you have a good question?
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.660]  I think we're going to give Peter the question.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.500]  I have to think of a question?
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.660]  This may have to be a cannabis question. How about that?
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:49.260]  Yeah. By the way, I wish I had it queued up, but some, in the all of us get shade thrown our way,
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:54.620]  I got a, why does James Lau do that show with Peter? He knows nothing about cannabis.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:56.940]  Thanks, brother.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.180]  No, they're talking about me, Peter.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:10.940]  Yeah, we are. And then like, at CannaCon, Oklahoma, like someone was like,
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:15.500]  fuck Brandon Rust. I'm like, fucking it. Like everyone hates someone.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:17.980]  They hate you no matter what.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.780]  Yeah. Smoke some weed and.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.980]  All right. So can I do a Boston Sports?
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:33.020]  Yes. Boston Sports. I don't like Boston Sports, but you can do a Boston Sports.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:41.260]  MFK, you can troll Jim Belushi all you want. I was biting my, see, this is like, I need to be nice.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:52.700]  But yeah, Jim Belushi came on. What was today? Sunday on Friday. And I was joking that he never
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:59.340]  saw a camera and a microphone that he didn't want to cozy up to. They didn't want to sidle up to.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:10.940]  But I hear Gemma yelling my name. But all right. So in, in, since I've been watching the Bruins
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.980]  advance to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Okay, baby girl, come here.
[01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:34.050]  So there was a Bruins hockey player who is going to be amazing, who was paralyzed.
[01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:43.380]  So what was his name? And what are they winning? The gift certificate, right?
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:49.940]  And by the way, all of you guys are, Gemma's calling my name because all of you are standing
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:58.180]  between me and that big juicy brisket that you see right there. So as soon as we wrap this up,
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:05.300]  no, not, not college hockey, Bruins. Oh God.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:14.500]  We got Gretzky and Babiore. Not Patrice Bergeron, Cheddar Bob.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.980]  I got a scrub. I don't even know of anyone. Okay, let's, let's do a weed question. Then
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:29.460]  we'll cut it. Yeah, there we go. We're going to cut it. And I want to know three types of products
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:36.020]  and, or compounds that you can reverse female plants with to make them male.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.480]  I'll give you guys a hint. The first one we'll use colloidal silver.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:56.660]  Yeah. And people appreciate Grateful Dead questions, which we can keep for trivia.
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:04.530]  We do. What do we got?
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.040]  STS, colloidal silver, GBA, silver. Oh yeah. We got a lot of, okay.
[01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:21.950]  NGK. No, that's not it.
[01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:31.390]  STS, fertilization. That's going to have to work, but that's all compounds.
[01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:40.750]  The compound. Yeah. So if we can, you guys have two SCS. I don't know what, what's SCS?
[01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:49.870]  Copper, silver nitrate, silver thiosulfate, colloidal silver. I'll accept that. Silver,
[01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:55.630]  silver, silver. There's nano silver, which is also colloidal. It's a true silver.
[01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:58.910]  Silver thiosulfate, silver nitrate.
[01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:11.630]  GB, GA3 is a GA3 is also acceptable. And that would be, let's see. So LOCK, RODG was the first one.
[01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:21.870]  And Carmen Gustafson with GA3 STS and colloidal silver. I'm going to give it to both you guys.
[01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:22.590]  We have a ringer.
[01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:29.390]  Cobalt, silver and GA3. Was Mr. Toad, was he before that?
[01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:35.070]  No, I don't know. So by the way, there was someone who got my question right.
[01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:42.430]  Johnny HB, you can hit me up and we'll get you something too.
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:47.710]  We'll get you a gift certificate as well. It was Norm Levy.
[01:19:47.710 --> 01:20:00.200]  Oh, okay. No, I was just saying, let's throw in a pack of seeds as well.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.240]  It will do pink lemonade.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:16.360]  Nice. Okay, guys. So you are RODG. Is that like raw dog? Lock raw dog. And Carmen Gustafson,
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:23.880]  you guys email me. If you can screenshot your answer on those two and email me,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.080]  jamesloggenetics at gmail.com, I will take care of you. So yeah.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.840]  And by the way, don't get angry at me if it takes longer than a couple of weeks for
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.440]  James to get those packs out to you.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.960]  Yeah, it might take a little while. We have to actually make the seeds before we get them out.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:48.840]  Well, you know what? And then I guess I should give my email too. So these winners
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.960]  can get their seeds. So it's moskaseeds.com.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:02.660]  Cool.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:06.580]  Okay. And while those people are sending their emails,
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.300]  let's just all visualize what I'm going to be hitting in 10 minutes.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:14.580]  Nice.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:22.020]  So yeah, I don't know if you guys have seen some stuff in the chat about me getting in
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.220]  shape or whatever. And I think I just want to touch on that real quick. It actually kind of
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.740]  ties in with Rick with ulcerative colitis, something I've been battling for a long time.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:38.580]  I was on prednisone. I got what I believe to be COVID in March of last year. And the medication
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:43.460]  I was taking wouldn't work anymore. And so I was on prednisone trying to figure it out all the way
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:51.460]  until the end of April, I got my first infusion of Remicade. And so I got off prednisone shortly
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:56.660]  after that. And so I went from having this round face, which was from the prednisone to
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.540]  starting to work out and get in shape. And I'm feeling a lot better. My gut's healthy.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:08.740]  I didn't want to go on Remicade. It suppresses your immune system. And with all the talk of COVID
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:14.660]  right now, and you know, I tried everything I tried THCA, CBD, I had tinctures of both,
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:18.820]  trying different concentrations, different blends. And it came down to me having to go
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:24.100]  in monthly to get a blood infusion. And so it's not nearly as scary as I thought it was going to be.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.540]  You know, it's it's a thing thing we learn and you know, diet is important.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:37.620]  You know, it's pretty amazing how you can take some of these modern drugs. I mean,
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:43.300]  Remicade is a biologic and so it goes in and suppresses part of your immune system.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:48.580]  prednisone is the worst drug I've ever been on in my life. It's not something to look forward to.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:54.500]  If there's any way to go off of prednisone, you got to get off it. Rick is also dealt with
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:23:06.740]  ulcerative colitis. So for a long time, right? And, yeah, it's not not comfortable, but there's
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:14.260]  a lot of different types of therapies. Now. There's a really good hospital here in Chicago,
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:21.860]  Northwestern, that is a teaching institution. So they do a lot of like clinicals for different
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:28.420]  products, such as Remicade, as I remember, my GI who was the head of the department,
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:35.940]  talked about it. He just felt that I wasn't the right candidate for that type of medication. But
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:45.780]  yeah, I've been on the same med for it's called 6MP for like the last 10 years.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.660]  And it just keeps everything in check of the flare ups and it's
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:58.100]  gosh, it's been years. So yeah, good thing to be able to find that therapy that works for you.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:06.340]  Because you know, it can have a significant effect on your life. So yeah, it's best to
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.220]  treat it and stick to that therapy.
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.900]  Nice. Yes. Someone's
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:24.180]  up with nausea. And I would say that, you know, for me, nausea, you get the indica seem to work
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:31.860]  better for nausea. For me personally, I use a really strong varieties. And I think I kept my
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:37.380]  colitis in remission for seven years without drugs, just from smoking cannabis, I can attribute
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:42.420]  that to smoking cannabis. And then you know, as you get older, your body changes. And so now I'm
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.540]  on new treatments. And I feel really good about the stuff I'm on now I can eat normal food again,
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.980]  which, you know, it's like you go on a clean diet. And it's like, no matter what I did, I gained
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:25:00.100]  weight and I was bloated for a year. So it's good to be back to some sort of normalcy. You know,
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.860]  now with COVID almost, you know, looking like COVID is in remission as well.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:14.100]  So yeah, but they're Rick, hold on, you're muted. Go ahead. Oh, James, are you vaccinated?
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:21.380]  I am vaccinated. Yes. Okay. All right. Good. Good. How about you? Yes. Yeah.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:27.940]  I'm back. My wife made me get it immediately. She's like seven months pregnant.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.900]  You know, that's a whole nother conversation for other stuff. We've gotten fights on the show about
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:38.580]  the whole vaccination thing with Rosenthal. And there's nothing wrong with a vaccine. I think
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:42.740]  it's a personal choice. I'm all for medical freedom. You want to get vaccinated, you go
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.220]  get vaccinated. You don't want to get vaccinated. You have that choice. That's we live in America.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.980]  You know, you don't want it. You don't believe in vaccines, you dislike it. I'm 100% in support of
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:59.700]  medical freedom. Those are the freedoms that we have. You know, it's a personal preference.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:05.860]  So, so Rick, just one last breeding question for you. Do you see that one?
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:17.620]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The cherry cam. So the it's actually that snow lotus.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:27.060]  Um, it's actually a sunshine daydream. Cross to an anti cherry Afghan. And that's from Bodhi.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:36.180]  Yeah, that that one is really special is the most cherry of anything that I'd smell.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:43.540]  And so I was really excited to work with her. And that that chem 91
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:55.380]  um, was the ideal because it is she led so much gas to the offspring with that really nice cherry
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:05.860]  flavor. People seem to like that we gave it away for several years. But yeah, no, it's a it's really
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:20.040]  a really fun one. But to work with. Nice. Well, it's been a great show. My studio is going to be
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.840]  set here. Hopefully next week, maybe the week after. We're gonna do another show next week,
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.520]  regardless. And then yeah, I'd like to invite you Rick to come out to California. Maybe on your
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.520]  Oregon trip, you can come out a couple days early and we could film a James Loud episode
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.600]  is we're going to be filming in advance and then I'll be on the chat during the show.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.200]  So I kind of think we'll we'll be able to do some different stuff.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:50.440]  Can do like a live premiere. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got some interesting guests that are gonna be on
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.040]  the show. We got all kinds of cool Bay Area people. I'd love to have you on the show,
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:28:01.160]  Rick when we do it live. Or when we do it from the studio. Peter, good to have you guys.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:09.240]  Thanks, guys. So with that, just some housekeeping. Mr. Toad, who's in the chat.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:17.480]  All your stuff was cleaned out yesterday. So send more seeds down. James Loud, we're running out of
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:22.360]  some of your stuff, but I'll follow up with you on that. And hopefully Rick will bless us with
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  some of his genetics. And what's today's Sunday and maybe tomorrow we'll pull together a
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:41.400]  veterans roundtable. So I haven't planned it yet, but we'll maybe get Doc Ray and some other
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:50.520]  veterans. Excellent. Yeah. Well, enjoy the Memorial Day weekend. Don't forget what it's all about,
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:57.800]  people and people who died in the line for their service. We appreciate you and everything you've
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:03.400]  done. I hope you guys all take a nice dab and enjoy this wonderful Sunday. Have a good one.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.640]  All right. Thanks, everyone.
