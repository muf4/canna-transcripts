[00:10.880 --> 00:17.580]  We got Eric Branstad here of Greenhouse Advisory Group and also works in procurement for Boxcar
[00:17.580 --> 00:18.580]  Supply Co.
[00:18.580 --> 00:26.400]  We got my lovely wife Sarah, she works for Crescent Soil Services which provides...
[00:26.400 --> 00:28.880]  Microscope analysis for soils.
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.220]  Nice, microscope analysis for soils.
[00:32.220 --> 00:35.040]  So we got the batting warm ups out of the way, how you doing?
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.700]  I'm doing good, the cup is awesome this year, it hasn't rained yet today so everybody's
[00:40.700 --> 00:44.980]  seeming in good spirits, you know, even though it's changed this year, it's a little different
[00:44.980 --> 00:51.300]  than last year with the Prop 215 going into the Prop 64.
[00:51.300 --> 00:55.220]  You're definitely not seeing dudes with backpacks of pounds walking around this year, huh?
[00:55.220 --> 00:58.780]  No, no, there's no packs and the lines are a little different in the way you gotta buy
[00:58.780 --> 01:04.020]  things but overall everybody can blaze, you don't need to get a wristband in a certain
[01:04.020 --> 01:10.100]  area, everybody's kind of unified now I believe so I like that part of it.
[01:10.100 --> 01:13.940]  Several years ago the first Emerald Cup I came to, it was the first cannabis event and
[01:13.940 --> 01:17.780]  I didn't bring my medical card, I didn't even know that was a thing and I had to meet up
[01:17.780 --> 01:22.060]  with Eric, we had to do the old little Watusi, a little wristband swap-a-rino.
[01:22.060 --> 01:28.620]  Yeah, exactly, that's right, yeah, I learned that back in the day, yeah, put them on loose,
[01:28.620 --> 01:29.620]  I'm allergic.
[01:29.620 --> 01:35.940]  Well, I appreciate it because I drove 480 miles to come to an event without my driver's
[01:35.940 --> 01:38.660]  license so that was pretty stupid.
[01:38.660 --> 01:43.460]  You've come a long way since then I believe, I mean you guys are now leading the way in
[01:43.460 --> 01:47.860]  the soils deal on Elaine's webinar, that's big.
[01:47.860 --> 01:54.340]  It is, it's pretty surreal, you know, a few years ago we came hoping to just try and meet
[01:54.340 --> 01:59.900]  people from the industry and try to get connected with the movers and the shakers and thankfully
[01:59.900 --> 02:04.820]  Dragonfly Earth Medicine and Eric allowed me to hang out, I was just the weird dude
[02:04.820 --> 02:10.940]  with the microscope book trying to talk about math and I'm just really grateful this year,
[02:10.940 --> 02:15.100]  we have products that are on display that we designed, we've been working with some
[02:15.100 --> 02:21.140]  farmers that entered the cup and so we just feel really grateful that so much has developed
[02:21.140 --> 02:23.860]  in the first few years since just trying to be involved.
[02:23.860 --> 02:30.660]  Yeah, yeah, I agree, I know that it's very controversial right now with the big farms
[02:30.660 --> 02:35.940]  and the small farms, are you seeing any big differences in your line of work with soils
[02:35.940 --> 02:40.660]  and you know the bigger farms versus the smaller farms, I mean does the microscope see the
[02:40.660 --> 02:45.820]  difference and you know those kind of things or is your business still kind of the same
[02:45.820 --> 02:52.420]  plan, big or small, you know fix the soil, look it up in the microscope, do something.
[02:52.420 --> 02:57.820]  Yeah, our approach is always the same regardless of how big the farm is and so we just come
[02:57.820 --> 03:03.860]  in and we analyze what they're working with, what the issue is, try to take some measurements,
[03:03.860 --> 03:09.540]  you know the biggest issue we see in any facility whether it's a tent or whether it's a 40,000
[03:09.540 --> 03:14.260]  square foot greenhouse, it's the variation from the wettest pot to the driest pot is
[03:14.260 --> 03:19.060]  what really gives people a headache and so as we're moving into scale we really try to
[03:19.060 --> 03:21.540]  quantify those variations, you know.
[03:21.980 --> 03:28.980]  Yeah, and one of the biggest challenges of any farm really is mindset change and so you
[03:28.980 --> 03:33.540]  have to be able to look at what you're doing and scrutinize and say what is working and
[03:33.540 --> 03:39.980]  what is not working and even if you're married to a certain type of program, is that actually
[03:39.980 --> 03:45.300]  working for you, is that actually bringing success and why or why not and so those are
[03:45.300 --> 03:51.700]  the questions that every farm has to answer as they move forward and we love to help them
[03:51.700 --> 03:52.700]  out with those answers.
[03:52.700 --> 04:00.380]  Yeah, I love the getting to somewhere, you know like everybody kind of bottlenecks and
[04:00.380 --> 04:05.540]  kind of what to do and a lot of times people do nine different things, you know they change
[04:05.540 --> 04:10.860]  this, they change that, there's so many changes it's hard to track where the success is but
[04:10.980 --> 04:17.980]  it's easy to notice the failure or the problems that exist and so I know for you guys and
[04:17.980 --> 04:24.180]  myself, we spend a lot of time trying to do these things to help people solve these problems
[04:24.180 --> 04:29.180]  whether it's the environment up above or like you guys with the soil environment down below
[04:29.180 --> 04:34.140]  and like I said with the small farms and the big farms I'm kind of wondering because now
[04:34.140 --> 04:39.700]  when I'm doing the trim procurement I'm seeing a lot of the big farms too and it's kind of
[04:39.700 --> 04:44.860]  this bittersweet situation where I'm working with small farms, working with big farms,
[04:44.860 --> 04:48.740]  believe it or not the big farms are trying to do good things in some way, you know I
[04:48.740 --> 04:53.380]  mean I see a lot of them with organic approaches and trying to do you know the right thing
[04:53.380 --> 04:59.740]  ultimately but they have that name big farm and I kind of laugh a little bit because I
[04:59.740 --> 05:02.820]  thought of something the other day and maybe you guys can help me with this or see if it
[05:02.820 --> 05:09.380]  makes sense but the regenerative soil food web, you know general population of organic
[05:09.380 --> 05:15.620]  soil people, look at that slide that you and Elaine and people use of how the forest takes
[05:15.620 --> 05:20.820]  care of itself right, the forest is huge, it doesn't need to feed itself, it doesn't
[05:20.820 --> 05:27.220]  need to do all these things but yet everybody's focusing on the small farmer to do this regenerative
[05:27.220 --> 05:32.260]  work but you know can't the big farmers do it because it's the big forest and it seems
[05:32.340 --> 05:36.820]  to me the biggest of farmers could do this because it's the biggest of forests or whatever
[05:36.820 --> 05:42.580]  like where's the hang up or the disconnect where it's only the small farmer that you
[05:42.580 --> 05:49.580]  know I guess I feel like is not over supported but just you know hyper focused on where you
[05:49.860 --> 05:54.660]  know the big farmer also needs a little bit of help because I don't want them making a
[05:54.660 --> 06:00.260]  mess. And that's you know that's really what's scary it's like you know a lot of these farms,
[06:00.260 --> 06:05.060]  a lot of these people moving into the old cut flower houses like those water sources
[06:05.060 --> 06:09.860]  are so destroyed they're forced to use reverse osmosis and so you know these big commercial
[06:09.860 --> 06:14.420]  RO systems with these really contaminated water I mean they're three, four, twelve to
[06:14.420 --> 06:19.780]  one waste and so you know some of these facilities are using 30,000 gallons a day and you know
[06:19.780 --> 06:24.580]  we recently converted a farm that was 40,000 square feet that was doing drained waste and
[06:24.660 --> 06:31.300]  cocoa and you know they were averaging you know almost a thousand gallons for one little
[06:31.300 --> 06:37.060]  small area and we cut that down to 180 gallons and so one area was taking 700 to a thousand
[06:37.060 --> 06:43.380]  gallons drained of waste and we cut it down to less than 200. And so you know if you're
[06:43.380 --> 06:48.020]  talking about the argument of this high production salt model it's like well when you're dumping
[06:48.020 --> 06:52.500]  a thousand gallons of water into a space every day that's a lot of water that becomes a dewpoint
[06:52.500 --> 06:57.060]  that becomes visible mold and botrytis and this isn't the connection that people are making and so
[06:57.060 --> 07:02.740]  you know we go into a room and we cut that cut that water usage by three by four by five by
[07:02.740 --> 07:08.980]  seven sometimes and the mold pressure reduces you know and so we're able to quantify the organism
[07:08.980 --> 07:13.780]  populations which can give us an indication of disease pressure and so we can tweak these
[07:13.780 --> 07:18.740]  little values reduce the water usage and we're lowering our carbon footprint we're lowering our
[07:18.740 --> 07:23.060]  destruction to the planet we're lowering our usage of water and we're getting a mold free
[07:23.060 --> 07:28.020]  higher quality product you know and so that's what Sarah and I've really been trying to do is
[07:28.020 --> 07:32.580]  push these concepts into the commercial space so that people can see that it is a real thing you
[07:32.580 --> 07:38.180]  know and and the biggest opposition we always get is like well if we put everything all these plants
[07:38.180 --> 07:42.500]  into a single bed how are we going to keep the disease from moving from one place to another and
[07:42.500 --> 07:48.020]  I just pull up an image of Africa on my phone and point to Africa as one mother freaking container
[07:48.020 --> 07:52.980]  you know what I mean it's like it is one container all roots in the same container you know what I
[07:52.980 --> 07:58.500]  mean definitely scalable yeah and so yeah regenerative soil solutions are scalable it's just
[07:59.460 --> 08:05.860]  the real obstacle is that the techniques that people are teaching aren't necessarily necessarily
[08:05.860 --> 08:10.660]  that conducive to success in the commercial market and so what Sarah and I've really tried to do is
[08:10.660 --> 08:16.020]  figure out like how do we functionally put those natural systems into the commercial space and get
[08:16.020 --> 08:20.980]  them to work for us and you know unfortunately the organic farmers the regenerative people are
[08:22.420 --> 08:26.420]  you know they're getting a lot of waste streams you know and it's hard to be successful while
[08:26.420 --> 08:33.220]  cultivating out of a waste stream you know. What I think that we actually do best is to make living
[08:33.220 --> 08:40.020]  soil absolutely scalable and very simple so it has to be something very simple that every single
[08:40.020 --> 08:47.460]  move that you do at scale becomes very precise and totally reproducible across the system so you
[08:47.460 --> 08:53.940]  make sure that every single component your water your soil are on point before you get started
[08:53.940 --> 08:59.060]  and so that you have control and a baseline as you move forward and you roll it out across
[08:59.060 --> 09:04.900]  across a big area and that becomes that becomes something very attainable very manageable then
[09:04.900 --> 09:10.340]  you have labs that you look at and you're you're watching what's going on so that before you start
[09:10.340 --> 09:15.140]  seeing it in the plant you're seeing it in the soil and you have time to address it and that's
[09:15.140 --> 09:21.220]  really what helps people scale and get a handle on success in the end. So yeah it's funny to me
[09:21.220 --> 09:26.580]  because I see people with a lot of the products and certain things and maybe biologicals and whatnot
[09:26.580 --> 09:31.860]  and they're not using a soil analysis to determine what needs to be added and so after hanging out
[09:31.860 --> 09:38.260]  with you guys for so long I just yeah I see a lot of waste and spinning our wheels and is this the
[09:38.260 --> 09:42.660]  right thing or not how do you base that where do you get that metric or this is what I need
[09:43.460 --> 09:47.620]  versus what you don't need people do have a habit of this is when I throw a little dash of this
[09:48.180 --> 09:52.820]  you know I mend with a little of that don't get me wrong we do have our methods to our madness but
[09:52.820 --> 09:56.740]  when we're getting to this regulated area where cost of production is everything and
[09:56.740 --> 10:01.380]  you're on a larger scale or even a small craft farm what you spend money on to put in
[10:02.260 --> 10:07.700]  has to count it's got to work it can't be a game where oh that didn't work let's go try this
[10:08.500 --> 10:13.380]  and so yeah working with you guys and seeing what you do it just blows me away
[10:14.580 --> 10:21.700]  at the lack of use that's being put towards you know resolving these things and every place that
[10:21.700 --> 10:26.420]  I go to because it's really spinning the wheels and somebody that doesn't really do the microbiome
[10:26.420 --> 10:32.500]  biological counting and testing to quantify exactly what is going on well and I think that
[10:32.500 --> 10:37.860]  so simple yeah well and I think that the other thing is that you know there's a lot of talk that
[10:38.740 --> 10:44.420]  we need living soils and we all know we want living soil but unless you're quantifying it
[10:44.420 --> 10:49.620]  there's probably something living in it but what is it is it pathogens that you're stimulating is
[10:49.620 --> 10:54.820]  it only bacteria and what does that mean so it's like bringing that knowledge into something
[10:54.820 --> 11:01.140]  tangible and useful that that translates into yield and health and harvestability but you know
[11:01.140 --> 11:07.300]  the the below ground is one thing but if you're if you're cultivating up above and in the atmosphere
[11:07.300 --> 11:12.980]  as well and looking at that plant mass you got to have the right greenhouse environment or the right
[11:12.980 --> 11:17.300]  above ground with the airflow and the leaf temperatures and all that so what you bring to
[11:17.300 --> 11:23.300]  the table is that perfect marriage with us in the below ground so thank you for what you bring
[11:23.300 --> 11:27.780]  no I mean it's it's worked great for both of us because we kind of needed each other we didn't
[11:27.780 --> 11:34.340]  really know it but it has worked out great because I've learned a lot and I've seen a lot of great
[11:34.340 --> 11:40.580]  results come out of a lot of the projects that we've worked on together or you know on the side
[11:40.580 --> 11:46.980]  together to help people out so I mean yeah it's been really it's been really eye-opening for me
[11:46.980 --> 11:52.980]  and and going some of the places we've been to you know the trip to Macedonia and things
[11:53.460 --> 11:57.860]  and other countries of what's going on has been really interesting and you know I think it's
[11:57.860 --> 12:03.540]  really neat to go to some of those places that are really eager and blossoming for living soils
[12:03.540 --> 12:09.220]  and to grow you know nutrient dense cannabis which are tricone dense cannabis because
[12:09.940 --> 12:14.980]  we got to make oil right you know do we bring in native soil what kind of inputs are people
[12:14.980 --> 12:19.860]  working with what do we use and that's a variation you know one of the things that we do is we try
[12:19.860 --> 12:25.460]  not to stick to any specific dogma we don't try to stick to any sort of religion we just analyze
[12:25.460 --> 12:29.700]  what's in front of us what does the farm have and then we make the best use of that and so
[12:30.340 --> 12:35.220]  you know me personally I like to have anxiety and lose sleep and stress about stuff so that's why I
[12:35.220 --> 12:40.100]  learned to quantify things so I could send it out for a lab result and I could look at the numbers
[12:40.100 --> 12:45.140]  and the numbers don't have any emotion and I can make decisions without emotion and so you know
[12:45.140 --> 12:49.860]  whether the farm's planting in native soil or they're buying a commercial soil product we still
[12:49.860 --> 12:55.700]  do the mineral analysis we still do the biological analysis and we look at what's in front of us and
[12:55.700 --> 13:01.060]  unfortunately for cannabis farmers is you know the supply of soil that's coming into them is
[13:01.060 --> 13:07.140]  remarkably inconsistent and from my mathematical standpoint really unsuitable for the goal at hand
[13:07.140 --> 13:12.820]  and so there's a massive demand across all states especially in California and so there's a legitimate
[13:12.820 --> 13:19.540]  supply issue with soils and so the variation in the nutritional values of those soils are varying
[13:19.540 --> 13:25.460]  widely from batch to batch to batch from farm to farm to farm and so in my opinion that's one of
[13:25.460 --> 13:31.620]  the greatest benefits to permanent living soil is we quantify our inputs we send them in for testing
[13:31.620 --> 13:37.140]  we verify what we have we add what's missing to bring it into balance and then we just maintain
[13:37.140 --> 13:42.900]  it once and so all these farms that are trying to do this really high production organic model
[13:42.900 --> 13:47.940]  and they're bringing in new soil each time you're bringing in a new set of variables into the most
[13:47.940 --> 13:54.020]  difficult thing you've ever had to navigate and so you know that's one of my biggest advocates for
[13:54.020 --> 13:59.460]  living soil whether it's what I care about believe about or think is what people should do in my
[13:59.460 --> 14:05.540]  opinion it's it's the easiest way to mitigate variation and risk moving into an area when the
[14:05.540 --> 14:11.780]  profit is declining significantly and so you know some of the analysis we do you know a lot of these
[14:11.780 --> 14:17.300]  soils that people are producing have potassium and salt levels that are so high it's impossible
[14:17.300 --> 14:22.820]  to bring these soils into what we would call balance and these salts and these potassium start
[14:22.820 --> 14:28.260]  to antagonize other nutrients namely calcium manganese and things like that and so you start
[14:28.260 --> 14:34.900]  to have really really really difficult time having plant health at this new largest scale with this
[14:34.900 --> 14:39.300]  widest level of variability you know and and some of these soils that we've been relying on
[14:39.860 --> 14:44.180]  for all these years with these brands that we become accustomed to like you know some of them
[14:44.180 --> 14:49.140]  are sending out soil that has compost from hurricane katrina you know what I mean it's like
[14:49.140 --> 14:54.500]  the compost component of some of these bag soils are the waste and debris that was being composted
[14:54.500 --> 15:00.180]  from hurricane katrina and so we're seeing like you wouldn't name it you wouldn't believe what's
[15:00.180 --> 15:05.460]  in there in some of these soils and so that makes it difficult for cannabis cultivars to execute this
[15:05.460 --> 15:11.300]  task and so people scoff at the price a lot of time and they'll choose like a 70 municipal waste
[15:11.300 --> 15:18.420]  soil fight pests and disease and they'll scoff at our 300 soil but that 300 soil is a forever soil
[15:18.420 --> 15:23.780]  and you know every harvest or every second harvest you got to do like 20 to 40 dollars worth of
[15:23.780 --> 15:28.580]  mineral amending to each yard in the building and so the savings begins to build year after year
[15:28.580 --> 15:33.700]  after year while the quality gets better it just becomes more predictable you know we just try to
[15:33.700 --> 15:38.420]  meet people wherever they're at so if they if they're doing indoor if they're doing greenhouse
[15:38.420 --> 15:42.580]  or doing native soil they're bringing it in we just try to meet them wherever they're at and
[15:42.580 --> 15:47.860]  make that better and simplify what they're doing so if they're putting in all these inputs and top
[15:47.860 --> 15:53.140]  dressing and all that stuff we just make sure that that isn't swinging our biology any one direction
[15:53.140 --> 15:58.340]  we're not necessarily saying I mean sometimes we will say don't use that particular product but
[15:58.340 --> 16:03.140]  sometimes we're just saying yes that's a good product but maybe scale it down to a proper dose
[16:03.140 --> 16:08.660]  so that when we're dealing with biology everything becomes a food source and will swing your biology
[16:08.660 --> 16:14.820]  and those are the those are the principles that we teach and so anything can become nutrients
[16:14.820 --> 16:21.300]  anything can swing your biology but even if you're not doing soil though just teaching people about
[16:21.300 --> 16:26.980]  nutrition and spraying to heal things rather than kill things and that's really what this is about
[16:26.980 --> 16:33.140]  is making sure that the plants thrive making sure that our mindset enables that spray for health not
[16:33.140 --> 16:38.980]  for war well and that's the thing it's like you know some of these older farmers we work with
[16:38.980 --> 16:43.140]  they've been growing for 20 years and it's like you know they'll say stuff like when I first started
[16:43.140 --> 16:48.580]  I never would have imagined preventively spraying for pests we just didn't have mold we didn't have
[16:48.580 --> 16:55.780]  pests and so now we're into this mindset of fear of losing of crop loss and people are
[16:56.500 --> 17:01.460]  basing their program around spraying poisons or spraying compounds that are designed to kill
[17:01.460 --> 17:06.980]  things without accounting to how does that affect nutrition and plant development well and it affects
[17:06.980 --> 17:13.140]  the quality not the quality but the end product because as you've been hearing me rant and rave
[17:13.140 --> 17:19.300]  about was with the trim procurement you know that gets made into oil so we have a lot of flour and
[17:19.300 --> 17:25.060]  a lot of trim that passes cat one and cat two testing but when it's condensed or concentrated
[17:25.060 --> 17:31.060]  into an oil that's where we see the detects and the failure rates start to go up so in order to
[17:31.060 --> 17:38.100]  find clean product and make sure that every step of the way your product has viability and value
[17:39.220 --> 17:44.580]  you have to find better ways people have to find better ways it's just that's the way it's gone
[17:44.580 --> 17:49.060]  and now we're going into category three where the heavy metals are kicking in and I think that's a
[17:49.060 --> 17:54.260]  whole new ball game that people aren't really ready for because of the soils the compost the
[17:54.260 --> 18:00.340]  things that you're talking about cannabis is a bio accumulator a bio-remediator so it's trying to
[18:00.340 --> 18:05.940]  do its friendly job of cleaning the air cleaning the soil and what it's doing is actually picking
[18:05.940 --> 18:11.620]  up all this stuff and causing you know detectable amounts even in the flour I mean I judged the
[18:11.620 --> 18:17.620]  flour and there was some detectable amounts for certain things I know the microbials were up so
[18:17.620 --> 18:23.220]  that's a whole nother you know different category to look at too so I mean there's a lot of transparency
[18:23.220 --> 18:28.900]  of work and things that we all need to be able to do together and unfortunately sometimes we're
[18:28.900 --> 18:36.660]  bound by NDAs and certain things but there's ways around those too to help I think express you know
[18:37.380 --> 18:43.140]  without giving too much away here's what's going wrong here's how to fix it and it's backed up by
[18:43.140 --> 18:48.820]  math and also the support of a lot of other people that we've helped turn around. One of the things
[18:48.820 --> 18:53.780]  that we've seen in our work is because a lot of our work is analyzing crop loss and analyzing
[18:53.780 --> 18:59.700]  issues and helping people through difficult scenarios normally since we're kind of a new era
[19:00.660 --> 19:04.500]  math I guess you could say we're kind of an emerging market people aren't really used to what
[19:04.500 --> 19:10.260]  we do so they don't seek us out first typically and so a lot of times we come in after products
[19:10.260 --> 19:16.500]  been confiscated destroyed for contaminants and after a massive crop loss has happened
[19:17.300 --> 19:21.940]  and so what we found is there's actually a lot of contamination coming from other areas that
[19:21.940 --> 19:27.780]  we didn't know about you know and like our food isn't being tested every five pounds like cannabis
[19:27.780 --> 19:33.380]  is in Nevada for example and so you know Nevada had really really really tight constraints so we
[19:33.380 --> 19:37.860]  learned a lot helping farmers navigate that and we work for several farms trying to make it through
[19:37.860 --> 19:43.220]  that and what we're starting to see is that there's contamination and some of these products that we've
[19:43.220 --> 19:48.740]  been relying on and you know the department of ag from Oregon has done a fantastic job at doing
[19:48.740 --> 19:52.980]  their own testing and quantifying some of these products and posting on their website and so I'd
[19:52.980 --> 19:56.900]  encourage everybody to go check that out and see what the Oregon department of ag has already
[19:56.900 --> 20:02.580]  identified and we try to encourage people to test their own materials you know we're starting
[20:03.220 --> 20:08.020]  yeah everything you bring in the building and so we're starting to see pesticide contamination
[20:08.020 --> 20:14.260]  coming through organic products like we saw with the azadirachtin based sprays Oregon you know
[20:14.260 --> 20:19.540]  well the drift because the drift is really big and what I found out working with big ag guys in
[20:19.540 --> 20:26.580]  Salinas area not cannabis ones the real ag is how drift will actually go from town to town city to
[20:26.580 --> 20:33.380]  city it could actually start out in one place and end up in bakers the stuff they sprayed in Salinas
[20:33.540 --> 20:38.740]  yeah that story you told me about was mind-blowing trace it all the way back so we're you know we're
[20:38.740 --> 20:43.940]  starting to see a lot of issues with contamination and so one of the things we talk about in our
[20:43.940 --> 20:49.380]  workshops are you know testing your input so you don't get a surprise fail detect that causes you
[20:49.380 --> 20:53.940]  issues down the line and you know we're starting to see drift issues like you've seen a couple
[20:53.940 --> 21:00.180]  scenarios where the pesticides from an agricultural field actually somehow merged with the weather
[21:00.180 --> 21:04.260]  system went up and over the hill and caused the contaminant and they were able to prove that which
[21:04.260 --> 21:09.860]  is mind-blowing you know and yeah and so when I'm doing the trim procurement a lot of the oil I mean
[21:09.860 --> 21:14.340]  the flour and the trim will pass but we make oil and concentrate it and that's where we see the
[21:14.340 --> 21:20.340]  detects so a lot of the farms I go to when I see grape vineyards in the area I already start to
[21:20.340 --> 21:25.060]  get a little worried I've been in places where there's a lot of strawberries and it actually did
[21:25.060 --> 21:31.380]  okay but then again the farms know when they sprayed I went back and did a quarantine and that
[21:31.380 --> 21:37.140]  stuff had a detect so it's really tough being surrounded by the grapes by the strawberries
[21:38.180 --> 21:42.980]  you know like I said the flour and the trim will pass but a lot of times you need your product to
[21:42.980 --> 21:49.060]  be valuable all the way through whether it's the smalls the shake maybe the stems if you can make
[21:49.060 --> 21:54.580]  paper out of them or whatever but nevertheless you know the value starts to be diminished as
[21:54.660 --> 22:00.740]  these contaminants float around from other farms and it's carried by the fog you know the wind when
[22:00.740 --> 22:05.300]  you spray at the wrong time you know not everybody pays attention to the wind they're supposed to
[22:05.300 --> 22:10.900]  spray and how these things are applied according to the weather patterns and yeah if they can track
[22:10.900 --> 22:16.100]  it in regular ag eventually they'll be able to track it with cannabis and because cannabis is
[22:16.100 --> 22:21.940]  that bioremediator and and it tries to clean things up I mean it just sticks like a magnet
[22:22.420 --> 22:28.740]  and it's different contaminants from farm to farm it's never just the same one and no it's not all
[22:28.740 --> 22:36.020]  micro buternal eagle 20 shit it's all these other words I can't pronounce and the ag guys say oh
[22:36.020 --> 22:42.820]  that's found in you know you can google them and they're found in um you know whatever they are
[22:42.820 --> 22:48.020]  fungicides you know so a lot a lot of the fails is that one that's uh what is a surfactant and
[22:48.020 --> 22:52.580]  organic fungicides or something it's causing strobing yeah it's causing a lot of problems
[22:52.580 --> 22:57.540]  yeah there's some strange ones in there but at the end of the day like I said we want to help
[22:57.540 --> 23:02.980]  figure it out then we get into category three testing with the heavy metals microbials pop up
[23:02.980 --> 23:08.420]  so I mean it's just going to get a little bit more difficult as we go and people have to refine
[23:08.420 --> 23:14.420]  their skills each time and work with people that can test stuff and that you know that's what we've
[23:14.420 --> 23:19.620]  been about is since our work has come in after the car crash has already happened we've seen how
[23:19.620 --> 23:25.780]  these problems develop and you know the best way to to not have a crop confiscated and destroyed
[23:25.780 --> 23:30.580]  from contaminants or get a very very low value that isn't conducive to a profitable model like
[23:30.580 --> 23:34.980]  we need to do some predictive testing we need to test the pesticides that we plan to use
[23:34.980 --> 23:39.460]  you know we're seeing contamination in the bottles and so there's a certain aspect of
[23:39.620 --> 23:48.020]  hiding products through waste streams I guess you could say and dilution is the solution and so
[23:48.020 --> 23:52.180]  but that's the thing we were kind of joking around I was a judge for the flowers and
[23:52.180 --> 23:58.340]  and you know I don't know if it was me or you or during the you know help helping me judge
[23:59.060 --> 24:04.100]  you know at one point the joke was after we tried the flower we were like oh this trim wouldn't pass
[24:04.820 --> 24:07.860]  haha one of the one of the unfortunate
[24:15.860 --> 24:20.340]  I think I'm also a little sensitive though like my job includes going into a disaster
[24:20.340 --> 24:25.140]  and trying to fix it and one of the funny things about cannabis people is before they start working
[24:25.140 --> 24:30.500]  with you they always want you to smoke their cannabis and which is cool but like you know
[24:30.500 --> 24:35.060]  if you brought if you brought me for an issue I'm smoking a detect and so I've you know I've
[24:35.060 --> 24:39.540]  seen the look of the flower I've seen the pest I've seen the bottles on the wall I've seen the
[24:39.540 --> 24:45.220]  detect and I have a physical sensation to correlate that to and so yeah I'm definitely
[24:45.220 --> 24:50.980]  quite sensitive to the commonly used agricultural pesticides you know what I mean but I do got to
[24:50.980 --> 24:57.300]  say the quality though is up detect or not the entries were super fire the personal entries
[24:57.300 --> 25:03.940]  the license entries like the mixed light I was super pumped the top four was in my top four
[25:03.940 --> 25:10.500]  that you helped me with and you even helped and took notes and it was an insane task but the
[25:10.500 --> 25:15.860]  entries were fire and it has a lot to do with you know these techniques that we talked about and we
[25:15.860 --> 25:20.820]  see a lot of this through you know over the course of time the mixed light looking like indoor
[25:20.820 --> 25:27.140]  everybody has this level of I want it to look like indoor is the saying you know and how do they
[25:28.100 --> 25:32.900]  so how do they so what is the difference like the full sun sometimes takes some weathering or has a
[25:32.900 --> 25:38.260]  look and it's like why does some of these newer coverings in the greenhouses start to change that
[25:38.260 --> 25:42.820]  look like what's happening in that space that allows that flower to look more like indoor
[25:42.820 --> 25:48.740]  well it's mostly how the light hits the plants these micro climates you know help in some cases
[25:48.740 --> 25:54.900]  too because I have found a couple indoor grower I mean sorry outdoor growers that I was like how is
[25:54.900 --> 25:59.220]  this even possible but when you get into the greenhouse there's many things that you can do
[25:59.220 --> 26:04.260]  wrong rather than you know I guess you could do right and greenhouse becomes this global term well
[26:04.260 --> 26:09.140]  if I have a greenhouse I'm going to get this great product and that's not necessarily the case
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.820]  and it also leads to that idea that we can control everything and control gets to be futile and
[26:14.820 --> 26:19.940]  costly at times too so at the end of the day the greenhouse cover is really important because we
[26:19.940 --> 26:25.780]  can either magnify the light or we can diffuse the light which is calming down the sun's intensity
[26:25.780 --> 26:30.500]  and doing that with shade cloth it restricts the light but a good diffuse cover will split the
[26:30.500 --> 26:36.100]  light and actually create more light particles and cannabis does love a lot of does love a lot of
[26:36.100 --> 26:41.940]  light but it doesn't like too much because we can scorch and burn off those terpenes and valuable
[26:41.940 --> 26:48.660]  oils and cannabinoids like CBD and so how do we retain those things and usually it's with the use
[26:48.660 --> 26:54.820]  of good soils good airflow and a good greenhouse cover that actually does help calm down the sun's
[26:54.820 --> 27:00.500]  intensity intensity which lowers the leaf surface temperature and so with a lower leaf surface
[27:00.500 --> 27:06.260]  temperature we avoid condensation and you know which is plant transpiration at the end of the day
[27:06.260 --> 27:11.780]  which makes for better water usage and living soil techniques when we use a lot of water and we run
[27:11.780 --> 27:17.620]  into drying out you know it compromises our soil structure or quality of soil you know they call
[27:17.620 --> 27:22.820]  in one of us or both of us they call me in and then I go well now we got to call you guys in
[27:22.820 --> 27:28.500]  because we fix one thing we got to fix the other and so at the end of the day it just always adds
[27:28.500 --> 27:36.980]  to the quality of the plant and so with less inputs less sprays for war we have better terpene
[27:37.620 --> 27:45.060]  cannabinoid production and overall just you know better look taste everything so it just starts to
[27:45.060 --> 27:50.500]  go up and those levels go up and and now we get people saying it to us they stop us at these events
[27:50.500 --> 27:57.060]  and go yeah I can't believe yeah and so I mean it's not something that you know we're trying to
[27:57.060 --> 28:02.980]  sell as a product so to speak it's just as the truth approach I think it's the approach you know
[28:02.980 --> 28:07.300]  and we're you know we're really trying to change the mentality and one of the things we've noticed
[28:07.300 --> 28:12.500]  in our work is you know we'll get called into a greenhouse that's maybe a retrofit or a poorly
[28:12.500 --> 28:18.660]  designed style maybe and we'll get brought in to quantify why there's pockets of plant health and
[28:18.660 --> 28:23.860]  you know our microscope work and our mineral analysis can certainly show why there's variations
[28:23.860 --> 28:28.820]  and there is and those variations in the soil absolutely lead to plant health problems but
[28:28.820 --> 28:33.700]  then when I stand there in the greenhouse and I look up and they're doing some combination of
[28:33.700 --> 28:39.300]  pulling the shade cloth halfway or pulling the depth curtain halfway in an effort to shade
[28:39.300 --> 28:45.860]  and what people aren't realizing is that creates the most dynamic variation in microclimate from
[28:45.860 --> 28:51.140]  one plant to the next and what happens is they're using the wrong climate screen they look the same
[28:51.140 --> 28:55.940]  they're similar looking and I don't know if the greenhouse company's pumping it because of
[28:55.940 --> 29:00.580]  cheapness but it doesn't breathe so then what we're doing and trying to bring relief to the
[29:00.580 --> 29:04.980]  plants by using a climate screen or a shade cloth that doesn't breathe we're trapping air
[29:05.540 --> 29:11.220]  thus creating the greenhouse effect again in an area that's cut off from the ridge vent for
[29:11.220 --> 29:16.900]  ventilation and so it's almost like two wrongs that aren't making anything right so then we're
[29:16.900 --> 29:22.500]  opening the shade cloth to burp the greenhouse close the blackout system to calm down the sun's
[29:22.500 --> 29:26.900]  intensity but we're restricting a ton of light in the heat of the day I mean it's just these
[29:26.900 --> 29:31.860]  combinations and nobody's following anybody or everybody's following the neighbor but the neighbor
[29:31.860 --> 29:37.860]  is doing 10 different things every different run and it's impossible to set standards with some of
[29:37.860 --> 29:44.340]  these things because everybody's moving at such a fast pace that they don't have time to ask any
[29:44.340 --> 29:49.860]  questions they just go and act and you know maybe hire somebody that tells them to do this but I
[29:49.860 --> 29:54.660]  mean I don't know I don't know who I don't know who it is or where they're getting the info from
[29:54.660 --> 29:57.780]  well you're that guy they need to bring you in and make sure you got the right combination
[29:58.020 --> 30:02.340]  in order to wrap this up where do they find us where are you at how do we get a hold of you
[30:02.980 --> 30:06.660]  I'm almost impossible to get a hold of I avoid I avoid all the Sarah
[30:08.180 --> 30:11.060]  I avoid most people I dip in the shadows
[30:13.780 --> 30:23.700]  so uh so it's crescive soil.com crescive is c-r-e-s-c-i-v-e soil.com and um yeah so you can
[30:23.700 --> 30:29.380]  find us there Instagram we do have a Chris Crescive Soil Instagram um we haven't worked at
[30:29.380 --> 30:36.580]  all that much he works his own Scotola granola I'm nursing the dirt yeah so we um soil is our
[30:36.580 --> 30:42.660]  passion but also um this concept of nutrient dense food and and sort of setting the bar
[30:42.660 --> 30:48.260]  what is it that you know here's the interesting thing about what humans do we get busy creating
[30:48.260 --> 30:54.420]  something is it devastation is it war or do we really want to thrive and that's what that's what
[30:54.420 --> 30:59.620]  lights me up so like let's get busy thriving let's like you know make plants that like have
[30:59.620 --> 31:04.100]  total nutrient density and feed our bodies and feed our souls that's what we're about
[31:05.220 --> 31:10.820]  and cannabis because that's the bridge she is the bridge off of pharmaceuticals folks
[31:10.820 --> 31:17.140]  the bridge that's the truth and yeah you can find me at light depth greenhouse on Instagram
[31:17.140 --> 31:24.020]  it's light underscore depth underscore greenhouse and uh yeah if you want some trim procurement
[31:24.020 --> 31:31.700]  talk about farm consultants any of these kind of things let's link up my email is eric at boxcar
[31:31.700 --> 31:42.020]  supplyco.com and yeah it was great talking with you guys and being at the emerald cup we appreciate it
