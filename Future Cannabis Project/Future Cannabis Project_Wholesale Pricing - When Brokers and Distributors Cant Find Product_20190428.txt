[00:00.000 --> 00:06.440]  What what kind of pricing were you seeing like at the bottom and then kind of what are you seeing the trends going to?
[00:06.900 --> 00:14.100]  So, you know, I'm seeing you know, the price to farmer is back up, you know at a thousand eleven hundred dollars right now
[00:14.100 --> 00:21.920]  And it was a low light depth indoor. This is for your outdoor. Okay, you know your your better light depths are at like 12
[00:22.440 --> 00:25.900]  12 50 and your indoors are up at 15 16 again
[00:26.500 --> 00:30.060]  And then your true exotics, you know that are
[00:31.020 --> 00:34.740]  Exotics 30 percenters, you know, they're up above to where they should be
[00:35.420 --> 00:38.440]  And what were all those categories like?
[00:39.740 --> 00:41.060]  end of
[00:41.060 --> 00:45.580]  2017 so we were looking at five to six hundred for outdoors
[00:45.900 --> 00:50.580]  We were looking at eight to nine hundred for the light depth. We were looking at
[00:51.260 --> 00:58.400]  1300 for the good indoors 1250 1300 and then your exotics were commanding, you know 1850
[01:00.420 --> 01:06.700]  So we have seen a boost in the in the last six weeks of price to farmer
[01:06.980 --> 01:11.940]  You know makes me regret this year that I didn't just take everything and bury it don't now
