[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  would be like, oh, like this is dropping.
[00:05.760 --> 00:08.800]  And then they'd be like, oh, it's just a show on YouTube.
[00:08.800 --> 00:11.760]  So anyway, we are live. Thanks for waiting, everyone.
[00:14.600 --> 00:16.960]  Let me there I am.
[00:16.960 --> 00:18.920]  And there the crew is.
[00:18.920 --> 00:22.880]  So as I was telling these guys, I'm putting my two year,
[00:23.080 --> 00:26.200]  my two and six year old to bed right now. So I'm just going to.
[00:26.360 --> 00:29.280]  Sorry, I'm getting yelled at by my wife for being super loud,
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.440]  even though I'm in the basement. But anyway, I let you guys take it over.
[00:33.440 --> 00:36.360]  And I'll be back in a little bit.
[00:37.360 --> 00:39.200]  Handle your business.
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.400]  So we're just laughing about.
[00:44.400 --> 00:46.880]  I said, Peter said, hey, can you guys come on tonight?
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.320]  And I say, yeah, can you can you make a little graphic?
[00:49.320 --> 00:54.040]  And so is his graphic basically said Lemon Coffee,
[00:54.160 --> 00:54.760]  dropping tonight?
[00:54.760 --> 00:59.400]  And we both got DM's about from people asking about seeds and stuff.
[00:59.600 --> 01:02.320]  It's not a seed drop. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[01:03.680 --> 01:07.920]  Actually, I'm getting my first pretty USA seed drop here
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.040]  with the seeds here now real soon. And with you.
[01:12.040 --> 01:13.320]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13.320 --> 01:16.040]  I think I got a little bit of something special coming my way. Yeah.
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18.040 --> 01:21.920]  So this is your first time you're going to be dropping with with seeds here now.
[01:21.920 --> 01:23.360]  Yeah. James is such a cool guy.
[01:23.360 --> 01:27.120]  And when I met the family there, the community, it's just
[01:27.720 --> 01:28.600]  I just loved him.
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.320]  And it's just they made me feel like like a family member.
[01:32.320 --> 01:35.720]  You know, it's just a really cool atmosphere there.
[01:35.920 --> 01:37.400]  I like I like them.
[01:37.400 --> 01:39.120]  Yeah. Yeah. James. James handles his business.
[01:39.120 --> 01:41.720]  Well, I think, you know, he's been doing it for a long time.
[01:41.920 --> 01:45.720]  Yeah. He knows he knows he knows the strains.
[01:45.720 --> 01:47.920]  Boy, he knows he educates me sometimes.
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.320]  Yeah. For sure.
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.320]  He doesn't he doesn't just let anybody on there.
[01:51.320 --> 01:57.320]  If if you see a breeder on that site or from that bank, you know, you can
[01:57.320 --> 02:00.720]  you can bet your bottom dollar that they've they've done their homework
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.720]  and they're not just copying people's work and, you know, doing any kind of,
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.720]  you know, short sighted breeding, which really is kind of a good intro.
[02:13.320 --> 02:15.920]  Folks, if you don't know, this is this is Lemonhawk.
[02:15.920 --> 02:21.520]  Pacific Northwest legend, green bean seeds, Lemonhawk genetics.
[02:22.320 --> 02:24.120]  And he was my mentor.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.720]  He got me into breeding and I wouldn't I wouldn't be breeding.
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.920]  I wouldn't be doing what I am today if this guy didn't didn't really put me on to it.
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.720]  And how that happened was we we met up on a on a forum in the medical days called
[02:37.720 --> 02:39.120]  Northwest Green Thumb.
[02:39.720 --> 02:45.720]  And he was a guy that was a guy that was a guy that was a guy that was a guy that was
[02:46.320 --> 02:50.120]  Northwest Green Thumb was really cool local thing up here in the Seattle area in
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.120]  Washington state.
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.520]  And it was really focused around patients and, you know, the growers, you know, mostly.
[02:56.920 --> 03:05.520]  And so through that through that forum, we linked and, you know, he was doing stuff back then.
[03:05.520 --> 03:07.120]  This was how long ago was that, Mel?
[03:07.120 --> 03:07.820]  10 years?
[03:08.520 --> 03:12.920]  Well, no, I started making seeds about 2004, 2005.
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.920]  Hey, Kaya, the way I I remembered us meeting, it was a little bit different than what you just said there.
[03:20.920 --> 03:23.820]  The first time I ever saw you was at a cup.
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.220]  I usually want I usually want to write.
[03:27.220 --> 03:27.520]  Right.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.920]  I always want these local cups.
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.420]  And all of a sudden you got this young kid walking up there taking my first place to my first place trophy.
[03:37.020 --> 03:38.020]  I remember that man.
[03:38.020 --> 03:38.720]  I had to meet you.
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.320]  I had to talk to you and it was epic that night.
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.520]  We sat around for, I don't know, six, eight hours.
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.720]  And it seemed like only a half an hour went by.
[03:46.120 --> 03:50.220]  We were just shooting the shit and catching up and learning about each other.
[03:50.220 --> 03:54.320]  Man, you know, if anything, I want to say something about you.
[03:54.320 --> 03:58.520]  You know, I've known a lot of breeders, a lot of growers in my time.
[03:59.020 --> 04:05.820]  And I got to say that you're one you're somebody I have a lot of respect for and I admire you.
[04:06.620 --> 04:28.820]  And it's not just because of what you have done in breeding and so forth, but when you when we're moving ahead with the medical community and what impressed me the most was the day that you stood in front of the senators in Olympia and you were on the news and you were talking to thousands of people and with your passion and your message.
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.920]  It was it was part of what made the medical movement move forward and you were a big part of it.
[04:35.520 --> 04:38.120]  I'm blessed to have known you at that time.
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.420]  Blessed to know you now.
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.120]  This is the you're like my little brother from another mother, man, you know.
[04:45.120 --> 04:45.420]  No.
[04:47.020 --> 04:47.620]  Thanks for it.
[04:47.620 --> 04:55.120]  Thanks for taking me under your wing and and showing me this this cannabis breeding stuff and helping me helping me do that.
[04:55.120 --> 04:56.420]  And I do remember the cup.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.920]  That was the first Tacoma Hemp Cup.
[04:59.520 --> 05:02.120]  And they had the I think we had the thing down at that.
[05:03.920 --> 05:06.520]  It was one of the first brick and mortar deals.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.720]  That was like 2010.
[05:07.820 --> 05:09.120]  I want to say it was 2010.
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.120]  Do you remember what which brand you you want you won with?
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.520]  Yeah, that was chem four.
[05:14.020 --> 05:14.620]  Yeah.
[05:14.920 --> 05:15.120]  Yeah.
[05:15.120 --> 05:15.320]  Yeah.
[05:15.320 --> 05:18.120]  I'm for beat my chem double D out that that year man.
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.220]  I was like, oh, yeah, I was gonna win with that double D and never entered her yet.
[05:21.520 --> 05:24.820]  And it's like man, you just like pull the rug out from under my feet.
[05:24.920 --> 05:28.420]  I mean that like what the fuck you know, when I saw you.
[05:28.420 --> 05:33.120]  It was like who is that cocky dude because you had that baseball cap on with the flat, you know, bill.
[05:35.620 --> 05:48.820]  It was it was good times, you know, I was hoping that we could someday get together with online and talk to exotic Mike and fab man the original Northwest 47 crew.
[05:48.820 --> 05:50.220]  That would be so fucking cool.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.020]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[05:51.020 --> 05:52.320]  I bet Michael be down.
[05:52.820 --> 05:56.720]  We might have a hard time getting a hold of fab man, but I'm definitely down to try it.
[05:57.620 --> 05:58.920]  Yeah, that would be awesome.
[05:58.920 --> 06:06.620]  Just to just to catch up a little bit and you guys have hit up or following on Instagram.
[06:06.920 --> 06:21.020]  We've been doing some seed drops and I'm been directing folks to an email and that email is that nw47 at gmail.com and the end of you 47 the Northwest 47.
[06:21.020 --> 06:22.620]  That's the 47th parallel.
[06:22.620 --> 06:24.020]  That's kind of where we're at up here.
[06:24.420 --> 06:50.720]  And back in the medical days exotic Mike Lemon Hoko myself and another old time feller from up North and Bellingham would have meetings regularly, you know, I mean, you know, once every couple of months or once a month if we could make it and we would just talk breeding talk about what what the different guys were working with and what we thought was going to be good and you know, sharing smoke and that was really kind of a fun thing.
[06:50.720 --> 07:02.620]  And then and then we thought well, hey, you know, we can we can make a make a little club out of this and maybe you know, get a booth that at hemp fest or something and nobody was really doing that at the time.
[07:04.220 --> 07:16.320]  So that was really a again a blessing to be, you know, rubbing elbows with with you know, exotic Mike and you know, these old timers and even some of the younger guys like Thunder fudge.
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.720]  You got Thunder fudge.
[07:17.720 --> 07:18.620]  You got Doc D.
[07:18.620 --> 07:20.420]  That was what you know that showed up.
[07:21.020 --> 07:25.720]  Kind of see who else Cuban Cuban grower.
[07:25.820 --> 07:26.320]  Come on.
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.620]  We can't get about that.
[07:27.620 --> 07:28.220]  That dude.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.620]  Do you remember how we used to get set for the cups?
[07:30.620 --> 07:34.520]  We used to all get together and say, well, what's your entry like?
[07:34.520 --> 07:37.120]  We'd all smoke it and say, no, I think we got a better.
[07:37.320 --> 07:48.820]  That first cup with with Cuban you you called me up and you said, hey, there's this kid from the thumb and he's got some crazy good hash and he's thinking about entering it.
[07:48.820 --> 07:49.620]  What do you think?
[07:49.620 --> 07:58.320]  And I want to send him over to you, you know, and and you link this up and you know, man, he went on a tear just an absolute terror on the cups.
[07:59.320 --> 08:02.520]  He wasn't sharing them with nobody him and exotic.
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.520]  Mike just crushed it.
[08:03.520 --> 08:04.720]  Clean him up for a while.
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.620]  So that was that was really cool.
[08:06.620 --> 08:08.820]  I was really after this Seattle Cup.
[08:08.820 --> 08:09.720]  He came up to me.
[08:09.720 --> 08:10.420]  He goes lamb.
[08:10.420 --> 08:12.120]  Look, he shows me his metal.
[08:12.120 --> 08:13.020]  You know, it's a third place.
[08:13.020 --> 08:17.620]  Now he goes, look, I want I want a cup and I said, you know what?
[08:17.620 --> 08:19.820]  You're not a champion until you win three in a row.
[08:20.120 --> 08:20.720]  And you know what?
[08:20.720 --> 08:22.520]  I didn't talk to him for over 10 years.
[08:22.620 --> 08:25.320]  And when I talked to him again, he came on my discord.
[08:25.820 --> 08:26.420]  He goes, lamb.
[08:26.420 --> 08:27.720]  The first thing he told me was lamb.
[08:28.120 --> 08:28.720]  He goes, remember?
[08:28.720 --> 08:30.820]  He said I wasn't a champion till I went three in a row.
[08:31.120 --> 08:33.120]  He goes, I want 27 a row, buddy.
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.320]  That was really amazing.
[08:35.320 --> 08:39.420]  Amazing to watch, you know, absolutely amazing the way that they just could not
[08:39.420 --> 08:45.020]  be beat for nothing, you know, and well-deserved, you know, well-deserved.
[08:45.020 --> 08:46.120]  The vibe was right.
[08:46.120 --> 08:47.520]  The pop was right.
[08:47.520 --> 08:48.420]  The weed was right.
[08:48.420 --> 08:50.020]  It was good timing.
[08:50.020 --> 08:51.720]  Everybody was, you know, clicking.
[08:51.720 --> 08:52.720]  Everything was going good.
[08:52.720 --> 08:54.920]  Really good times back then, huh?
[08:54.920 --> 08:55.320]  Yeah.
[08:55.320 --> 08:55.620]  Yeah.
[08:55.620 --> 08:56.420]  The Cuban tech.
[08:57.920 --> 08:58.720]  Have you talked to him?
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.520]  Have you seen him?
[08:59.520 --> 09:00.220]  Have you seen him?
[09:00.220 --> 09:00.520]  Yeah.
[09:00.520 --> 09:00.720]  Yeah.
[09:00.720 --> 09:00.920]  Yeah.
[09:00.920 --> 09:01.120]  Yeah.
[09:01.120 --> 09:01.320]  Yeah.
[09:01.320 --> 09:01.520]  Yeah.
[09:01.520 --> 09:01.720]  Yeah.
[09:01.720 --> 09:01.920]  Yeah.
[09:01.920 --> 09:02.120]  Yeah.
[09:02.120 --> 09:02.320]  Yeah.
[09:02.320 --> 09:02.520]  Yeah.
[09:02.520 --> 09:02.720]  Yeah.
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.920]  You talked to him lately?
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.320]  You know what?
[09:05.320 --> 09:06.220]  It's been a while.
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.720]  Maybe, maybe six months, maybe even, maybe even a year, you know, this COVID
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.020]  thing, whoo, the year went by fast.
[09:13.020 --> 09:15.020]  I got, I got lost out in Hawaii for a while.
[09:15.020 --> 09:17.920]  So, but yeah, last time I talked to him, he was doing good.
[09:18.220 --> 09:21.920]  We actually, I was doing some work for an outfit up here and we bought a bunch
[09:21.920 --> 09:27.220]  of beds from him to use in our facility and yeah, yeah.
[09:28.420 --> 09:32.320]  Hey, Kai, let me, let me ask you a few questions about that new stream that
[09:32.320 --> 09:34.120]  you got, if you, if you don't mind.
[09:34.620 --> 09:35.920]  I was really interested.
[09:35.920 --> 09:38.120]  It was the black coffee.
[09:39.920 --> 09:40.520]  Tell me about it.
[09:41.020 --> 09:43.920]  So it's not, it's not my strain.
[09:44.720 --> 09:47.720]  The green source gardens and green source gardens.
[09:47.720 --> 09:48.820]  They're, they're down in Oregon.
[09:49.220 --> 09:54.120]  And I actually ran into them, met them for the first time at the living soil
[09:54.120 --> 09:54.820]  symposium.
[09:55.420 --> 09:59.820]  And I think the next year they might've won the Emerald cup, a regenerative
[09:59.820 --> 10:06.320]  farming award, just an incredible, incredible garden up there in Oregon,
[10:06.320 --> 10:08.720]  doing regenerative farming and hugel cultures.
[10:08.720 --> 10:15.420]  And, and so I had gifted them some coffee F3 back at that living soil symposium.
[10:15.820 --> 10:18.720]  And, you know, I always encourage people to, you know, work, work with the stuff
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.720]  and, and, you know, further it if you want to.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.320]  And he ended up popping the seeds and really found something that he liked in
[10:25.320 --> 10:30.720]  there and did some open pollinations and started selecting and working in line.
[10:31.120 --> 10:37.220]  And, you know, he bred a couple more F-gens and, and this is one of the
[10:37.220 --> 10:40.420]  outcrosses from those F-gens, the black coffee.
[10:40.420 --> 10:41.320]  I think I got a pack here.
[10:41.320 --> 10:41.820]  Let me grab it.
[10:44.950 --> 10:45.850]  Boom, right there.
[10:49.150 --> 10:55.350]  So the black dog, the black dog in here, this is, that's from BioVortex.
[10:55.350 --> 10:57.650]  I don't know if y'all know who BioVortex is.
[10:57.950 --> 11:04.050]  BioVortex guy, I actually have one of his books around here somewhere.
[11:04.850 --> 11:11.850]  Really incredible comic book, style book that talks all about, you know, soil
[11:11.850 --> 11:15.350]  science and, and doing things in a real natural manner.
[11:15.650 --> 11:22.850]  And so BioVortex guy had been breeding with this black dog, Kush, and he's
[11:22.850 --> 11:24.550]  worked at all kinds of different ways.
[11:24.850 --> 11:30.150]  And, and Green Source Garden guys took that black dog, Kush, they had a keeper
[11:30.150 --> 11:32.350]  from some seeds that they had selected.
[11:32.350 --> 11:35.050]  They do literally everything that they do is from seed.
[11:35.550 --> 11:41.250]  Everything they do is full season, outdoor, what we call natural cycle, you
[11:41.250 --> 11:44.150]  know, right in the, in the natural earth there.
[11:44.350 --> 11:48.550]  So they, they bred and they do like some selections on the hill and
[11:48.550 --> 11:49.550]  then they do some breeding.
[11:50.450 --> 11:52.550]  Do you know the genetics of the black dog?
[11:53.350 --> 11:53.850]  You know what?
[11:54.150 --> 11:59.050]  I'm not 100% sure, but I'm sure it would be easy to access.
[11:59.150 --> 12:02.350]  Somebody's got, somebody wants to Google it real quick.
[12:02.850 --> 12:04.650]  And then they, they hit that.
[12:04.650 --> 12:08.050]  So is that, that's the F4 on that, that black dog.
[12:08.350 --> 12:14.250]  And then they hit it with the coffee F5 and the pictures of it were just amazing.
[12:14.350 --> 12:17.050]  And I've got to sample some of the flowers myself.
[12:17.150 --> 12:20.250]  And it's, it's absolutely amazing herbs.
[12:20.650 --> 12:21.550]  Super strong.
[12:21.950 --> 12:25.850]  With your coffee, when you cubed it, are you planning on doing
[12:25.850 --> 12:26.950]  any further work with it?
[12:28.050 --> 12:28.650]  Yeah.
[12:28.650 --> 12:32.750]  You know, I want to, you know, as long as it keeps doing good stuff
[12:32.750 --> 12:37.150]  for me, I'm going to keep working it, you know, a lot of uniformity
[12:38.450 --> 12:40.750]  at, at, at the cube stage, you know?
[12:40.850 --> 12:45.950]  And so ultimately, you know, while I was working it on, on, on that
[12:45.950 --> 12:48.950]  sense was, you know, I wanted to be able to, to have a male that really
[12:48.950 --> 12:53.650]  produced and, and was kind of mimicking what the female was doing.
[12:54.450 --> 12:57.750]  So, you know, by having a male that's composed mostly of that mother's
[12:57.750 --> 13:01.850]  genetics, but DX and DX and DX, and you're increasing that, that
[13:01.850 --> 13:02.650]  potentiality.
[13:02.650 --> 13:04.750]  So that's, that's kind of where I was going with it.
[13:04.750 --> 13:07.450]  You know, now I'd like to just do the outcrosses and see, see what
[13:07.450 --> 13:12.150]  happens, you know, my best guesses are still just guesses.
[13:12.450 --> 13:17.950]  So until I can actually put that, that male onto some stuff and a lot
[13:17.950 --> 13:21.150]  of different stuff and, and see how it works with different genetics.
[13:21.150 --> 13:23.650]  I'm not, I'm not going to know kind of what, what to do with it.
[13:23.650 --> 13:27.450]  But at that point, you know, that's, this is kind of the, the hope and
[13:27.450 --> 13:28.750]  the direction that we're going in.
[13:29.950 --> 13:32.850]  But, but as always, you know, I'm doing other stuff too.
[13:32.950 --> 13:35.450]  You know, that Hamlet, Hamlet stuff that we've been running is just,
[13:35.450 --> 13:39.650]  it's such an incredible plant and it just perform, outperforming really
[13:39.650 --> 13:41.350]  everything we have on the farm right now.
[13:41.850 --> 13:44.750]  When you say outperforming, what, and what, and what standards are you
[13:44.750 --> 13:46.350]  looking for in performance?
[13:46.950 --> 13:49.850]  It, A, it checks all boxes so I can wash it.
[13:49.850 --> 13:51.150]  I can make flour with it.
[13:51.550 --> 13:55.150]  It's, it's got the right flower cycle time.
[13:55.150 --> 13:57.250]  So it's like about, you know, eight, nine weeks.
[13:57.450 --> 13:59.150]  It's a little faster in the greenhouse.
[13:59.450 --> 14:01.950]  But it's just, nothing can touch it.
[14:01.950 --> 14:06.350]  It never has any kind of issues and it's always overperforming everything
[14:06.350 --> 14:09.650]  else in the garden and it really returns on the hash.
[14:09.650 --> 14:12.650]  So that's kind of, that's been one of our favorites besides the
[14:12.650 --> 14:13.250]  strawberry.
[14:13.450 --> 14:19.150]  So on the Hamahama side, we're breeding out an FGen and we're going to
[14:19.150 --> 14:22.250]  actually going to be releasing a new line pretty soon with, with the
[14:22.250 --> 14:26.250]  Hamahama male against, you know, it's a small group of plants.
[14:27.550 --> 14:30.050]  But we're really happy and kind of hot on the Hamahama.
[14:30.050 --> 14:33.650]  You know, I got to follow, I got to follow where my nose goes, you know,
[14:33.650 --> 14:38.350]  and if I, if I'm running a bunch of stuff out there and this stuff is the
[14:38.350 --> 14:40.050]  best, then that's, that's where I'm going to go.
[14:40.250 --> 14:43.950]  And yeah, the Hamahama has been really running the farm.
[14:44.650 --> 14:48.750]  Well, see, you know, this is where I think somebody like you is blessed
[14:48.750 --> 14:52.750]  because you're kind of, you have a touch of the old school where we did
[14:52.950 --> 14:57.450]  smoke our weed and determine how good it was by our nose and our smoke,
[14:57.450 --> 14:57.750]  right?
[14:57.750 --> 15:00.050]  I mean, we didn't really care what it looked like at the time.
[15:00.050 --> 15:03.150]  If it got you stoned, it tastes decent, then it was good weed.
[15:03.550 --> 15:07.350]  But then you also are really involved with some of the newer strains.
[15:07.350 --> 15:09.350]  So you got the best of both worlds.
[15:09.850 --> 15:12.950]  I'm not as involved with the newer strains as you, Kaia.
[15:13.150 --> 15:15.350]  I don't even know what Runtz is to be honest.
[15:15.550 --> 15:17.850]  I don't have nothing against any of the newer strains.
[15:17.850 --> 15:21.950]  I think it's a blessing to see cannabis progress the way it is.
[15:22.350 --> 15:26.650]  You know, I still, I think there's room for everything as long as it's
[15:26.650 --> 15:28.950]  progressing forward and not going backwards.
[15:29.750 --> 15:32.950]  Yeah, you know, honestly, I don't bring in a lot of clones, Mel.
[15:33.650 --> 15:34.550]  I gave up on that.
[15:34.550 --> 15:38.450]  But you know, I get to see, I get to see some of the other stuff and, you
[15:38.550 --> 15:41.650]  know, most of the time, honestly, I'm kind of disappointed because it has
[15:41.650 --> 15:42.650]  this crazy cool name.
[15:42.650 --> 15:47.850]  And for me, you know, like good cannabis, there's something to the
[15:47.850 --> 15:48.950]  name, you know what I mean?
[15:48.950 --> 15:53.950]  Like it's, if you call it something, it's got to have a
[15:53.950 --> 15:55.350]  connection to that name.
[15:55.350 --> 15:59.750]  And a lot of times you get excited to smoke a banana or something and
[15:59.750 --> 16:03.050]  it's nothing like banana or anything like it.
[16:03.050 --> 16:04.850]  So I don't know.
[16:04.950 --> 16:08.850]  But on that note, you know, I think staying in your own lane and having
[16:08.850 --> 16:13.250]  your own stuff that you're working with and pulling in cool stuff that
[16:13.250 --> 16:15.650]  you think is fun, you know, that's good.
[16:15.650 --> 16:19.050]  But you know, run the stuff before you start breeding to it, you know,
[16:19.050 --> 16:19.850]  get to know it.
[16:20.350 --> 16:22.550]  And I think you're going to get better results.
[16:22.950 --> 16:26.350]  Hey, Kai, are you ever planning on going to do Femmes?
[16:26.350 --> 16:29.050]  A lot of people are going and dropping Femme seeds now.
[16:29.050 --> 16:31.850]  Are you ever planning on getting in that arena?
[16:32.650 --> 16:34.450]  You know, we actually are.
[16:34.550 --> 16:37.950]  I've actually had a couple people out there send me their different
[16:38.750 --> 16:40.650]  Femmes solutions to play with.
[16:41.150 --> 16:45.050]  And just because there's been such a demand for it and you know, my
[16:45.050 --> 16:50.650]  overstanding of how Femmes seeds can be bred, but also how nature might
[16:50.650 --> 16:54.250]  create that, kind of opened me up to it a little bit because I was really
[16:54.350 --> 16:55.550]  opposed to it for a while.
[16:57.050 --> 16:58.650]  But yeah, we're working with that.
[16:58.650 --> 17:02.850]  I'm also working with the Mandalorian, Mandalorian Genetics, and I gave
[17:02.850 --> 17:06.350]  him some of our coffee stock and he's going to be doing some stuff with
[17:06.750 --> 17:10.550]  auto flowering coffee and we'll be Femmenizing coffee.
[17:10.850 --> 17:14.450]  So, you know, especially for like the European guys, they all want, they
[17:14.450 --> 17:15.550]  all want Femmenized stuff.
[17:15.550 --> 17:17.050]  No, no, we're talking Femmes.
[17:17.250 --> 17:18.550]  You're not a newbie at this.
[17:19.150 --> 17:20.250]  You've done Femmes before.
[17:20.850 --> 17:21.850]  I know you have because we...
[17:25.450 --> 17:29.250]  I play with it, but it's not something that I was putting out, you know.
[17:29.750 --> 17:30.150]  Yeah.
[17:30.650 --> 17:31.250]  It was just something...
[17:32.050 --> 17:32.950]  It was good testing.
[17:32.950 --> 17:35.950]  I mean, you tested in your lab and I tested Femmes in my lab.
[17:35.950 --> 17:40.050]  So we got to see a part, you know, from different worlds and stuff, but
[17:40.050 --> 17:42.450]  our conclusions came to about the same at that time.
[17:42.850 --> 17:45.750]  And I think the only reason that we kind of steered away from Femmes is
[17:45.750 --> 17:48.250]  because of the lines that we were working.
[17:48.350 --> 17:52.150]  They weren't as work, you know, for Femmenization as they are now.
[17:52.250 --> 17:55.850]  Some of the lines that are being worked now, they're a lot more, you
[17:55.850 --> 17:57.550]  know, selected for those traits.
[17:58.550 --> 17:59.750]  It's more stability.
[18:00.050 --> 18:03.150]  Back 10 years ago, there was, you know, you were lucky if you even found
[18:03.150 --> 18:05.450]  a stable string 12 years ago.
[18:06.350 --> 18:08.350]  Yeah, I think there's something to that.
[18:08.350 --> 18:11.450]  I mean, some of the stuff that we were working on here, we've
[18:11.450 --> 18:16.250]  extended out so many generations and tightened things down.
[18:16.450 --> 18:20.550]  And, you know, like with the Cubed, I'm seeing really good uniformity,
[18:20.750 --> 18:21.650]  you know, in the Femmes.
[18:21.650 --> 18:26.250]  So to me, that lets you know you're on the right track, you know,
[18:26.350 --> 18:27.850]  and that's how it should be.
[18:28.150 --> 18:32.050]  So once you get to that point, then you can maybe, you know, if you
[18:32.050 --> 18:34.650]  want to do some Femmenized seeds, I think maybe there's still going
[18:34.650 --> 18:37.150]  to be variation in it, just like anything.
[18:37.150 --> 18:40.950]  But I don't know.
[18:41.050 --> 18:44.550]  I'm just, I'm less hesitant to mess with it now.
[18:44.550 --> 18:49.650]  And, you know, if that's what people want, then, you know, let's have at it.
[18:49.850 --> 18:53.150]  I know, I know, when I get people, new people that want to grow,
[18:53.250 --> 18:54.750]  I don't want to give them a clone anymore.
[18:54.850 --> 18:59.550]  And I tell them, you know, it's easy enough to call out a male, but,
[18:59.550 --> 19:02.250]  you know, a lot of people are really intimidated by that.
[19:02.450 --> 19:05.750]  So I find it really easy to give them a Femmenized seeds.
[19:05.750 --> 19:09.950]  But on the other hand, you know, it doesn't always work out so well,
[19:10.350 --> 19:10.850]  you know.
[19:11.750 --> 19:15.150]  You know, speaking of males, you know, we always get hit with this
[19:15.150 --> 19:19.350]  question and I'm going to ask it to you again, because your answer is
[19:19.350 --> 19:19.850]  great.
[19:19.850 --> 19:23.350]  And it teaches people on how to select males and stuff.
[19:23.350 --> 19:25.750]  What do you look for when you select a male?
[19:25.750 --> 19:26.250]  Okay.
[19:28.250 --> 19:30.150]  Well, I look for a lot of different things.
[19:30.150 --> 19:34.150]  Structure is very important, you know, because there can be great
[19:34.150 --> 19:37.450]  variation, just like in female plants and male plants and the structure.
[19:38.550 --> 19:41.450]  Stem rub is something that's always a really nice indicator.
[19:41.550 --> 19:44.750]  You know, if you're getting some cool smells off of it, that can't be a
[19:44.750 --> 19:45.350]  bad thing.
[19:46.350 --> 19:49.650]  I also try to, you know, some people when they're selecting their males,
[19:49.750 --> 19:54.750]  I like to put my seeds into a one-gallon pot and then let them get
[19:54.750 --> 19:57.450]  root bound and then the males start to show themselves.
[19:57.750 --> 20:01.850]  So generally the first males that show themselves, I try to call those.
[20:02.050 --> 20:05.450]  And then the really, really late males, they're not getting selected
[20:05.450 --> 20:05.950]  either.
[20:05.950 --> 20:08.450]  I kind of like somewhere in the middle, but also near the end, you
[20:08.450 --> 20:08.950]  know.
[20:10.750 --> 20:14.050]  I don't know that there's, you know, again, this is all about the
[20:14.050 --> 20:14.550]  structure.
[20:14.550 --> 20:16.550]  I don't know if there's any other way to do it.
[20:16.850 --> 20:20.250]  I don't know that there's, you know, again, this is all just kind of
[20:20.250 --> 20:24.150]  intuitive stuff and things that I've kind of, I've played with things
[20:24.150 --> 20:25.650]  and I've had stuff not work out.
[20:25.850 --> 20:30.050]  And, you know, that's kind of, you know, I'm not, we were talking about
[20:30.050 --> 20:33.750]  this the other day, the difference between scientific breeding and the
[20:33.750 --> 20:36.550]  art of breeding, or the science of breeding and the art of breeding,
[20:36.850 --> 20:37.150]  you know.
[20:37.150 --> 20:40.850]  And there's some powerful tools in the science of breeding, right?
[20:40.850 --> 20:46.350]  You can test stuff early and get ratios and you can find sex and you can
[20:46.350 --> 20:47.750]  do all kinds of cool things.
[20:48.950 --> 20:52.250]  And then, you know, you have the testing stuff at your fingertips.
[20:52.250 --> 20:55.650]  You can find out what the different cannabinoids are that are hidden in
[20:55.650 --> 20:58.550]  there, you know, that you wouldn't otherwise know without those
[20:58.550 --> 20:59.550]  scientific tools.
[20:59.750 --> 21:03.550]  But there's also the art of breeding and that's really where you're
[21:03.550 --> 21:08.750]  following the farmer's intuition, but more than the farmer's intuition,
[21:08.750 --> 21:11.550]  you're following the farmer's tools of his senses.
[21:11.850 --> 21:15.650]  So the farmer's in there making observations on plant structure, what
[21:15.650 --> 21:17.050]  is desirable and what isn't.
[21:17.150 --> 21:20.950]  And they're also making judgments, you know, and again, I think that's
[21:20.950 --> 21:26.050]  where people kind of get separated, is we all might have the same colors
[21:26.050 --> 21:29.150]  or the same genetics to work with, but how we're making those selections
[21:29.150 --> 21:29.650]  is different.
[21:29.650 --> 21:32.750]  And how we're making those selections is based off of our senses, you
[21:32.750 --> 21:37.850]  know, so how we look at the plant structure, how we select for, you
[21:37.850 --> 21:41.750]  know, crystal content or terpenes, you know, some guys might say, oh,
[21:41.750 --> 21:43.750]  I like this terpene this way or that one.
[21:43.850 --> 21:46.450]  Or if you've got two of them and they have the same terpene, then what
[21:46.450 --> 21:49.350]  are the little micro things that you're looking at as far as bud
[21:49.350 --> 21:53.350]  structure goes that might make you select one way or the other, you
[21:53.350 --> 21:56.750]  know, and are you going through and making sure that you're keeping
[21:56.750 --> 21:58.850]  those plants until you smoke the herbs?
[21:59.450 --> 22:02.250]  Because I know a lot of people just select off of just looking at them
[22:02.250 --> 22:05.650]  and some of these guys out here don't even smoke, which to me is
[22:05.650 --> 22:09.350]  really, it's strange, but I guess maybe if you had somebody there
[22:09.350 --> 22:11.750]  that you trusted, then that would be okay.
[22:12.350 --> 22:16.350]  But really, you know, that's kind of the art of breeding, you know,
[22:16.350 --> 22:16.850]  and no matter how much...
[22:16.850 --> 22:20.850]  Kyle, do you see that thing on the screen, the science of breeding
[22:20.850 --> 22:21.950]  versus art of breeding?
[22:22.150 --> 22:22.750]  There you go.
[22:22.850 --> 22:23.550]  Thank you, sir.
[22:25.250 --> 22:25.750]  I love it.
[22:25.850 --> 22:26.350]  Awesome.
[22:27.050 --> 22:32.250]  You know, and no matter how much science you have, you can't predict
[22:32.250 --> 22:33.250]  what it's going to throw.
[22:33.450 --> 22:35.850]  You know, you can have a good idea, you can have a good guess, an
[22:35.850 --> 22:40.750]  educated guess, but until you actually cross those plants and run that
[22:40.750 --> 22:44.150]  progeny and look and see what it did and what you've got in there,
[22:44.150 --> 22:46.850]  that's how you know if you made good selections or not.
[22:47.150 --> 22:49.850]  And that's, to me, that's why like a testing stuff is important.
[22:49.850 --> 22:54.250]  But you know, the market is dictating things and people are just
[22:54.250 --> 22:55.650]  wanting to get their hands on stuff.
[22:55.650 --> 22:56.850]  It's very hot right now.
[22:57.650 --> 23:01.750]  So we're probably going to put out some stuff that's untested, you
[23:01.750 --> 23:04.650]  know, just as long as people know what it is, and I think they'll be
[23:04.650 --> 23:05.850]  stoked to get their hands on it.
[23:06.650 --> 23:10.550]  Here's a general question and you'd be the perfect person to
[23:10.550 --> 23:12.650]  explain it to some of the newer growers.
[23:13.950 --> 23:16.950]  We mentioned F-generations, filet-o-generations.
[23:16.950 --> 23:18.450]  What does that terminology mean?
[23:18.450 --> 23:22.650]  Why do breeders even, why is it concerned to breeders?
[23:24.050 --> 23:30.450]  Well, and it's not so much even just the F-gen part of it, but what
[23:30.450 --> 23:32.550]  you're doing at those different stages.
[23:33.050 --> 23:37.150]  So F-gen is basically you're breeding brothers and sisters down the
[23:37.150 --> 23:42.350]  line. So to create an F-1, you're taking two unrelated and you breed
[23:42.350 --> 23:42.850]  them together.
[23:42.850 --> 23:45.150]  That's your first generation, it's filet-o-generation one.
[23:45.750 --> 23:50.850]  And then if you took and popped a lot of those seeds and then bred
[23:50.850 --> 23:54.650]  brothers and sisters together, you'd be creating the next F-gen, F-2,
[23:54.750 --> 23:56.550]  F-3, and so on and so forth.
[23:56.750 --> 23:59.750]  But at those different spots, you can also be doing either open
[23:59.750 --> 24:04.750]  pollinations, where you're basically using multiple females and
[24:04.750 --> 24:06.150]  multiple males.
[24:06.450 --> 24:07.650]  What's the purpose?
[24:07.650 --> 24:09.350]  Why would you do that?
[24:09.850 --> 24:11.750]  That's going to open up the genetic pool.
[24:13.150 --> 24:17.250]  Okay, so that's going to give you a whole lot more, a lot more options
[24:17.250 --> 24:20.750]  and visibility of what's inside those different plants.
[24:20.750 --> 24:24.050]  It's different recombinations of genes.
[24:24.750 --> 24:30.050]  Okay, so you might want to open it up to see what's in there, what
[24:30.050 --> 24:30.650]  you've got.
[24:30.850 --> 24:34.550]  Okay, and then from that point, you could narrow it down and you say,
[24:34.550 --> 24:38.450]  oh, I really like this female or these three females and then narrow
[24:38.450 --> 24:38.850]  it down.
[24:38.850 --> 24:41.750]  And I really like the looks of these couple males over here and
[24:41.750 --> 24:42.450]  narrow it down.
[24:42.950 --> 24:46.350]  And then ultimately, you'd want to be, you know, breeding with one
[24:46.350 --> 24:49.550]  male so that you know exactly what's going to go on in the next
[24:49.550 --> 24:53.750]  round. And you might only even have one female or two, you know,
[24:53.750 --> 24:54.250]  I don't know.
[24:54.750 --> 24:58.850]  But you know, as long as you're picking the best one and then
[24:58.850 --> 25:00.050]  you're breeding those together.
[25:00.850 --> 25:03.450]  And at some point, if you wanted to do a back cross, right, you
[25:03.450 --> 25:05.450]  might take one of those plants and then you're going to first,
[25:05.450 --> 25:06.850]  you're going to have to out cross it.
[25:07.250 --> 25:12.050]  So you would cross it to an unrelated cultivar and then you're
[25:12.050 --> 25:14.150]  going to bring it back to that original.
[25:14.250 --> 25:18.450]  Then you'd be selecting out boys in the filial generation, essentially.
[25:18.450 --> 25:22.050]  Well, it'd be the F1 generation and then you're bringing it
[25:22.050 --> 25:22.350]  back.
[25:22.350 --> 25:26.750]  So then BX1 and then you'd select a male from that BX1 and breed
[25:26.750 --> 25:28.150]  it back to the mom again.
[25:28.350 --> 25:29.750]  That's the back cross two.
[25:30.150 --> 25:33.150]  And then you'd select the male again from that progeny and keep
[25:33.150 --> 25:34.150]  bringing it back.
[25:34.150 --> 25:36.750]  And as you're doing that, you're basically stacking the genetics
[25:37.250 --> 25:40.350]  towards the mom's deck of cards, so to speak.
[25:40.650 --> 25:44.250]  Now, that's a great philosophy on how when you're developing or
[25:44.250 --> 25:49.150]  you're trying to be stacking traits to develop an ideal cultivar
[25:49.150 --> 25:52.550]  female. Would you do the same to make a male for breeding?
[25:52.950 --> 25:53.750]  You tell me, Mel.
[25:54.550 --> 25:56.850]  I mean, just the way you explained it.
[25:56.850 --> 25:58.350]  Why not do it for a male, right?
[25:58.650 --> 25:59.250]  Why not?
[25:59.950 --> 26:04.050]  I mean, it's just you're stacking the genetics, which is going
[26:04.050 --> 26:06.550]  to make your breeding more predictable.
[26:06.850 --> 26:07.250]  Yeah.
[26:07.250 --> 26:10.750]  I mean, listen, it wouldn't be any different for boys or girls.
[26:11.350 --> 26:14.450]  The genetic coding works the same way, right?
[26:15.350 --> 26:20.150]  So, but let's say if you wanted a chocolate male for breeding,
[26:20.250 --> 26:23.250]  you could actually develop a chocolate male by doing this type
[26:23.250 --> 26:24.450]  of selection, right?
[26:24.550 --> 26:24.950]  Okay.
[26:25.450 --> 26:25.750]  Yeah.
[26:25.750 --> 26:25.950]  Yeah.
[26:25.950 --> 26:28.850]  I don't think, you know, and I remember seeing
[26:30.150 --> 26:33.250]  seeing a guy do a lot of males out in the field once.
[26:33.750 --> 26:37.750]  Doing big selections on males, but I don't see a lot of folks
[26:37.750 --> 26:38.950]  doing that so much.
[26:40.950 --> 26:44.850]  And again, you know, that might be where that science part
[26:44.850 --> 26:47.350]  comes in, where you've got these tools where you can start to
[26:47.350 --> 26:51.650]  analyze males without having to take them, you know, long cycle
[26:51.650 --> 26:55.050]  and do kind of things, you know, you can even test maybe for
[26:55.050 --> 26:56.150]  terpenes in males.
[26:56.650 --> 26:57.250]  I don't know.
[26:57.250 --> 26:58.850]  This isn't something that I've played with.
[26:59.850 --> 27:02.650]  But I would imagine that you could start doing that and
[27:03.350 --> 27:06.150]  and then after you gathered enough data, you would have some
[27:06.150 --> 27:09.650]  really cool stuff to base your judgments on.
[27:09.850 --> 27:12.450]  You're kind of doing that by nature, but let's say the stem
[27:12.450 --> 27:17.850]  rub, we're linking those traits that we smell in the stem versus
[27:17.850 --> 27:21.550]  the potency that we've experienced in the past, right?
[27:21.750 --> 27:24.550]  So we're trying to link traits is what we're trying to do,
[27:24.550 --> 27:27.550]  trying to find something that we can link to a certain trait
[27:27.550 --> 27:31.650]  that is going to be a pretty consistent in the genetics.
[27:31.650 --> 27:36.650]  But if you could do it through scientific research, microscopes
[27:36.650 --> 27:40.050]  and cutting into slicing into DNA and stuff like that, why
[27:40.050 --> 27:42.050]  not? But that's way over my head.
[27:42.150 --> 27:43.750]  That's the next generation, Kaya.
[27:43.750 --> 27:45.150]  That's for you and your kids.
[27:45.150 --> 27:46.050]  That's for your kids.
[27:46.750 --> 27:47.650]  Yeah, probably my kids.
[27:47.650 --> 27:50.750]  I mean, you know, and even having access to that, you pretty
[27:50.750 --> 27:55.150]  much have to be, you know, in one of these legalized markets
[27:55.250 --> 27:58.150]  to have access to even some of the testing and stuff.
[27:58.150 --> 27:59.750]  It's just the way that they're doing it.
[27:59.750 --> 28:05.050]  So, yeah, we'll get there at some point with our little farm
[28:05.250 --> 28:08.150]  out there, you know, right now we're just making hash, but
[28:08.150 --> 28:12.550]  at some point we'll turn our eye on doing that kind of breeding
[28:12.550 --> 28:14.850]  stuff in there with the testing labs and all of that.
[28:15.050 --> 28:17.950]  I don't think very many folks are doing that right now.
[28:18.750 --> 28:21.850]  How many breeders or how many commercial farms are breeding
[28:21.850 --> 28:22.750]  in Washington right now?
[28:22.750 --> 28:23.250]  Do you know?
[28:23.850 --> 28:25.950]  I don't know many.
[28:26.450 --> 28:28.950]  I know Dutch Blooms is doing some work on his farm.
[28:30.450 --> 28:33.050]  But aside from that, most of them are definitely not doing
[28:33.050 --> 28:34.550]  any kind of intentional breeding.
[28:35.050 --> 28:37.850]  Would you say that that would be a lucrative market, especially
[28:37.850 --> 28:40.550]  the way everybody's closed off and getting new genetics into
[28:40.550 --> 28:42.450]  the commercial field?
[28:43.150 --> 28:46.250]  No, they're still able to bring genetics and stuff in.
[28:47.850 --> 28:50.250]  You know, they're buying, they're participating in the seed
[28:50.450 --> 28:51.550]  thing, you know what I mean?
[28:51.550 --> 28:54.650]  So they're bringing new stuff in and just not having to breed,
[28:54.950 --> 28:56.250]  you know, they're just...
[28:56.850 --> 28:57.950]  Oh, they're allowing that now?
[29:01.250 --> 29:03.450]  I think lots of people, you know what I mean?
[29:03.450 --> 29:06.250]  They've had their windows, they brought a lot of stuff in, so
[29:06.250 --> 29:07.150]  it's there.
[29:08.050 --> 29:08.650]  It's there.
[29:09.850 --> 29:12.150]  Yeah, but you know, after a few years, it's going to be a
[29:12.150 --> 29:14.850]  closed market where if there's no new genetics coming in,
[29:14.850 --> 29:17.350]  everybody's going to be smoking and selling the same stuff
[29:17.350 --> 29:18.450]  in the stores, right?
[29:19.050 --> 29:19.850]  I don't know.
[29:19.850 --> 29:22.550]  I honestly, I think that they're getting, especially in
[29:22.550 --> 29:24.750]  Washington, you know, they're getting better and better every
[29:24.750 --> 29:30.150]  year about revamping their rules and I think they'll keep it
[29:30.150 --> 29:32.050]  open and I think there's going to something's going to happen
[29:32.050 --> 29:35.250]  maybe potentially on the federal level that'll change all this
[29:35.250 --> 29:35.950]  anyways.
[29:36.250 --> 29:36.650]  Yeah.
[29:37.350 --> 29:40.050]  Yeah, but as soon as it changes on the federal level, all the
[29:40.350 --> 29:43.650]  I mean, state rules could turn around and change too, especially
[29:43.650 --> 29:46.050]  with genetics and opening the door with new genetics coming
[29:46.050 --> 29:46.850]  in and stuff.
[29:47.850 --> 29:48.650]  It's interesting.
[29:49.450 --> 29:51.250]  Stuff coming around the corner.
[29:52.950 --> 29:53.250]  Yeah.
[29:53.250 --> 29:56.650]  Hey, speaking of which, what do you, I know you're doing some
[29:56.650 --> 29:57.550]  stuff with that blueberry.
[29:57.550 --> 29:59.050]  What else do you got going on Mel?
[29:59.850 --> 30:02.150]  And when do I get my hands on those blueberry seeds?
[30:02.450 --> 30:03.750]  I'll see you tomorrow, right?
[30:04.150 --> 30:04.750]  Yeah.
[30:04.750 --> 30:05.450]  Yeah.
[30:05.650 --> 30:07.250]  I got your babies here, by the way.
[30:07.350 --> 30:08.250]  Right on, right on.
[30:09.350 --> 30:11.730]  I'm actually, what I'm doing right now, I've been playing
[30:11.750 --> 30:16.630]  around a little bit with some older stuff like the Black
[30:16.630 --> 30:19.710]  Triangle, I crossed Black Triangle and with the Big Sur
[30:19.730 --> 30:20.530]  Holy Wheat.
[30:21.030 --> 30:23.130]  Oh, and we're in testing right now.
[30:23.130 --> 30:26.330]  I'm just sending testers out this last week.
[30:26.630 --> 30:27.930]  I got that blueberry.
[30:28.130 --> 30:31.010]  I crossed, I crossed that one to the Big Sur Holy Wheat and
[30:31.030 --> 30:34.010]  testers are just now finishing up and we're getting all kinds
[30:34.030 --> 30:36.130]  of cool terpenes out of it.
[30:36.530 --> 30:37.430]  We got blueberry.
[30:37.430 --> 30:38.630]  We got piney blueberry.
[30:38.630 --> 30:41.130]  We got lemon pledge out of it.
[30:41.130 --> 30:43.810]  I mean, because you know, Big Sur Holy and you got like a
[30:43.810 --> 30:47.390]  50-50 cut there and you got a little bit of weird stuff going
[30:47.410 --> 30:49.110]  in there too, about 10%.
[30:49.110 --> 30:52.610]  Let's see, someone reported tennis balls.
[30:53.410 --> 30:55.990]  Can of tennis, like fresh can of tennis balls is what it's
[30:56.010 --> 30:56.310]  not like.
[30:56.310 --> 30:56.710]  Rubber.
[30:56.710 --> 30:58.910]  Yeah, that rubber, that's from that blueberry.
[30:58.910 --> 30:59.710]  I'm telling you.
[31:00.210 --> 31:00.910]  Yeah, that's...
[31:01.010 --> 31:01.710]  Rubbery.
[31:02.610 --> 31:05.690]  Well, you know, with that cross because of the Big Sur Holy
[31:05.710 --> 31:08.390]  Wheat, you know, big, you know, all the crosses that all the
[31:08.410 --> 31:09.810]  strains that were in that one.
[31:10.710 --> 31:14.890]  I didn't think it was going to be that stable in the first F1
[31:14.910 --> 31:15.510]  generation.
[31:15.510 --> 31:19.490]  But what I'm seeing is a lot of blueberry, about 50% blueberry
[31:19.510 --> 31:20.610]  showing up in the females.
[31:22.610 --> 31:23.910]  For folks out there listening,
[31:25.610 --> 31:27.410]  there was a cut up here in Washington.
[31:27.410 --> 31:31.610]  They called the $500 cut and not very many people held it.
[31:31.710 --> 31:32.210]  And
[31:33.310 --> 31:38.010]  it's a, we call it, you know, a pre-99 DJ short blueberry.
[31:38.010 --> 31:39.610]  It's a sativa dominant.
[31:40.310 --> 31:43.210]  So basically it's a squat little bugger, but thin leaves
[31:43.610 --> 31:47.410]  and the high is up and shiny all day long.
[31:47.410 --> 31:48.110]  No burnout.
[31:48.110 --> 31:52.810]  You can just blaze it and the most delicious blueberry flavor
[31:53.310 --> 31:55.210]  in a joint all the way through.
[31:56.110 --> 31:57.110]  It's everybody's favorite.
[31:57.110 --> 31:58.910]  Everybody that I know, it's their favorite.
[32:00.210 --> 32:02.590]  You just can't, you can't get over it, you know, and I mean
[32:02.610 --> 32:04.510]  the cuts been around for over 20 years, right?
[32:04.510 --> 32:04.910]  So,
[32:05.210 --> 32:06.210]  she's hard to reach.
[32:07.210 --> 32:07.510]  Mr.
[32:07.510 --> 32:09.510]  Hoko here was the one that shepherded
[32:10.710 --> 32:12.910]  that plant through and shared it with a lot of us.
[32:12.910 --> 32:13.410]  And
[32:14.310 --> 32:17.490]  yeah, if I was stuck on an island and could only have one
[32:17.510 --> 32:18.710]  herbs or maybe two,
[32:21.010 --> 32:22.610]  that one or chem double D.
[32:22.810 --> 32:24.310]  Those are two of my favorite, but
[32:25.510 --> 32:29.090]  that blueberry, speaking of her, you know, she's really hard
[32:29.110 --> 32:29.910]  to breed with.
[32:30.110 --> 32:32.690]  A lot of people think that, you know, I think that's why you
[32:32.690 --> 32:35.170]  don't see a lot of blueberry breeders out there because
[32:35.190 --> 32:37.390]  that's not a very easy strain to play with.
[32:38.590 --> 32:41.390]  There's so many ways that it can go backwards on you
[32:42.190 --> 32:44.770]  and it has on me, you know, after about 12 years of work
[32:44.790 --> 32:46.990]  and all of a sudden on my BX2s,
[32:47.490 --> 32:49.490]  I had a shit storm going on.
[32:49.490 --> 32:50.790]  It's like, what the fuck?
[32:51.090 --> 32:53.890]  You know, it's like you don't expect that after 12 years, but
[32:54.090 --> 32:56.170]  you know, it teaches you something when you get that
[32:56.190 --> 32:59.390]  deep on how to put pull things back together, but
[33:00.690 --> 33:02.290]  it's looking good on the BX3s.
[33:02.290 --> 33:04.990]  I don't know if you've seen any pictures I posted on Instagram.
[33:06.090 --> 33:07.890]  Man, you know, I need that smoke now.
[33:08.290 --> 33:09.290]  Bring it over to me.
[33:10.890 --> 33:12.290]  Yeah, I'll bring you some.
[33:12.290 --> 33:15.290]  Yeah, I got some hanging here pretty soon in about two days.
[33:15.590 --> 33:16.190]  Awesome.
[33:16.690 --> 33:17.290]  Awesome.
[33:18.190 --> 33:19.790]  Are you are you still doing stuff with dogs?
[33:19.790 --> 33:20.190]  No.
[33:20.590 --> 33:20.990]  Yeah.
[33:20.990 --> 33:21.390]  Yeah.
[33:21.490 --> 33:23.390]  Oh the real dogs.
[33:23.990 --> 33:24.290]  Yeah.
[33:24.290 --> 33:26.890]  No, no, just my own little personal dog.
[33:26.890 --> 33:28.190]  I do little dog tricks and stuff.
[33:28.190 --> 33:30.490]  She's got about 10-15 tricks that she could do.
[33:30.890 --> 33:34.490]  I'm not doing protection dogs or anything like that anymore.
[33:34.890 --> 33:36.790]  It's my body's like can't handle it.
[33:36.790 --> 33:40.490]  I'm all broken up, Kaya, you know, you know, yeah, those dogs
[33:40.490 --> 33:41.290]  are no joke.
[33:42.190 --> 33:46.290]  But but I that speaking of dogs, I am working the chem dog lines
[33:46.390 --> 33:53.690]  that I like to see I got bodies cut the chem D and I hit that
[33:53.690 --> 33:55.990]  with my double D BX2.
[33:56.690 --> 33:57.590]  Oh my God.
[33:58.090 --> 33:59.190]  Oh my God.
[34:00.090 --> 34:04.690]  What these are going through testing now and I'm making F2's
[34:06.290 --> 34:09.990]  real soon and I'm going to probably test those before I make
[34:10.190 --> 34:14.090]  drop them but I'm going to redo that breeding the double D back
[34:14.090 --> 34:15.690]  to Bodie's D.
[34:16.290 --> 34:19.090]  That was that was a that's a nice mix right there.
[34:19.190 --> 34:21.990]  Yeah, I love that chem double D and what was the one that's
[34:21.990 --> 34:23.290]  so good seeds did?
[34:24.490 --> 34:25.290]  Oh that Dogon.
[34:25.890 --> 34:30.090]  It was it was Stardog back cross to times double D.
[34:30.990 --> 34:31.290]  Man.
[34:31.290 --> 34:33.590]  I don't know what was one of those but man that was amazing
[34:33.590 --> 34:33.990]  herbs.
[34:33.990 --> 34:34.990]  Holy cow.
[34:36.990 --> 34:39.790]  You never got any of that Dolly Patron that I use chem for
[34:39.790 --> 34:45.490]  your chem for and I crossed it to my double D and I called it
[34:45.790 --> 34:49.190]  what's the see Greenspan was supposed to he was my rep right?
[34:49.290 --> 34:53.490]  He was supposed to release it as Dolly Parton because double
[34:53.490 --> 34:55.090]  D's right, right, right.
[34:55.590 --> 34:56.990]  Couldn't fucking spell right.
[34:57.690 --> 34:59.690]  It released to the world is Dolly Patron.
[35:04.490 --> 35:06.390]  The spell checked on your on your.
[35:07.790 --> 35:10.090]  It was too late by the time it was released man.
[35:10.190 --> 35:10.890]  It was already.
[35:15.090 --> 35:19.690]  But yeah, that was one of them but yeah that chem for I got
[35:19.690 --> 35:23.090]  her locked up in some seed forms, but I also got that cut
[35:23.090 --> 35:24.090]  coming back at you.
[35:24.190 --> 35:24.990]  If you still want her.
[35:25.590 --> 35:28.290]  Yeah, I would love I would love to have the chem for cut.
[35:28.290 --> 35:32.290]  I have not had that plant in my in my garden in a long time.
[35:32.890 --> 35:34.290]  I'll try to grab her next week.

[36:24.390 --> 36:27.690]  We made a we had like a basically like we had Logan come
[36:27.690 --> 36:33.490]  out from Hawaii and he did a farm session like a two day
[36:33.490 --> 36:36.190]  three day class that we had out there and we made a big huge
[36:36.190 --> 36:40.090]  IMO pile and got all that kick-started up and I made a big
[36:40.090 --> 36:44.290]  old batch of OHN and we got the FAA rolling.
[36:44.290 --> 36:48.490]  So and he brought out a whole bunch of calcium bicarbonate.
[36:48.590 --> 36:50.790]  So we were making the water soluble cow and
[36:52.590 --> 36:56.090]  Cal Foss, you know, we burn in the woods and burning bones
[36:56.090 --> 36:58.390]  and yeah, we got it all going on out there, bro.
[36:58.990 --> 36:59.590]  Hey brother.

[37:03.590 --> 37:04.990]  How's the wife and kids doing?
[37:05.590 --> 37:06.590]  They're doing great.
[37:06.590 --> 37:10.190]  They're upstairs watching a movie Friday movie night.
[37:10.190 --> 37:14.190]  So yeah, the babies the babies are finally back in school
[37:15.490 --> 37:18.090]  and they're super stoked to ride on the bus and get to hang
[37:18.090 --> 37:21.190]  out. But you know, we've just been keeping a low key and
[37:21.690 --> 37:24.090]  getting up to the mountains and skiing, you know, spending
[37:24.090 --> 37:24.790]  our time up there.
[37:24.790 --> 37:27.290]  It's a good good way to get out and get some fresh air.
[37:28.290 --> 37:32.390]  Yeah, I hope you don't mind but I shared roughly your story.
[37:32.390 --> 37:34.790]  I didn't tell exactly how because you were there.
[37:34.790 --> 37:35.290]  I don't know.
[37:35.290 --> 37:38.290]  I just on how your baby son was born.
[37:39.090 --> 37:43.690]  Oh, I was I think I was on one of the I can't remember which
[37:43.690 --> 37:46.190]  stream show I was on but I just touched on it as I was talking
[37:46.190 --> 37:48.690]  about, you know, what kind of person you were and how you
[37:48.690 --> 37:52.790]  delivered your own son on the freeway and it's like that was
[37:52.790 --> 37:53.090]  so cool.
[37:53.090 --> 37:54.790]  You want to go into that to kayak?
[37:58.390 --> 37:59.690]  It was actually really really cool.
[37:59.690 --> 38:02.990]  I was encouraging my wife to you know, have have the baby
[38:02.990 --> 38:03.290]  at home.
[38:03.290 --> 38:10.390]  Anyways, and this was our third baby and yeah, she said, hey,
[38:10.390 --> 38:12.290]  I'm having contractions and you know, we were getting everybody
[38:12.390 --> 38:17.590]  packed up and ready to go and and our water broke and before
[38:17.590 --> 38:20.490]  we knew it, you know, it was like we're in the car racing to
[38:20.490 --> 38:23.990]  the hospital and you know, I said you want me to pull over and
[38:23.990 --> 38:26.590]  get call an ambulance and she said no, I just just gun it.
[38:26.890 --> 38:30.490]  So, you know, the two girls were my babies were in the backseat.
[38:31.890 --> 38:38.090]  Iris would have been two and then Ella was I guess six and and
[38:38.190 --> 38:39.690]  Tutu was back there.
[38:39.690 --> 38:43.890]  Grandma was back there and we're doing a hundred miles an hour
[38:43.890 --> 38:49.090]  over the Narrows Bridge and Tutu's back there praying and we
[38:49.090 --> 38:52.190]  came to a light there in North Tacoma on the way to the hospital
[38:52.190 --> 38:55.990]  and she said it's babies coming now and I said, babe five minutes.
[38:55.990 --> 38:56.790]  We're there.
[38:56.990 --> 38:58.190]  She said no right now.
[38:58.890 --> 39:00.090]  So right there at the intersection.
[39:00.090 --> 39:03.590]  We just, you know, turn the hazards on and jumped out and you
[39:03.590 --> 39:07.590]  know, Tutu basically had had the baby most of the way out and
[39:08.090 --> 39:11.590]  wrapped him up in the in the hoodie and drove to the hospital
[39:11.590 --> 39:15.290]  after that was it was really a really powerful experience, you
[39:15.290 --> 39:18.290]  know, seeing my wife's instincts take over.
[39:18.990 --> 39:23.690]  Yeah, I was just a servant at that point and she did all the
[39:23.690 --> 39:24.890]  hard work and amazing work.
[39:24.890 --> 39:29.990]  I just I was just there, you know, what an experience to be
[39:29.990 --> 39:32.290]  right there with your son being born.
[39:32.290 --> 39:34.790]  It's just so it must have been so cool, huh?
[39:35.290 --> 39:36.590]  It was it was powerful.
[39:36.890 --> 39:37.790]  It was really powerful.
[39:38.190 --> 39:39.190]  I was proud of my wife.
[39:39.190 --> 39:42.390]  I was like man, this woman just whoo.
[39:44.490 --> 39:49.590]  She knew exactly what to do, you know, and and yeah, it's amazing.
[39:49.890 --> 39:51.590]  You got any more kids on the way?
[39:52.590 --> 39:53.490]  You can't ask me that.
[39:57.590 --> 39:59.390]  Who are you talking to Bill?
[40:00.690 --> 40:04.090]  You know, every two years it seemed like you had another one
[40:04.090 --> 40:04.490]  coming.
[40:05.090 --> 40:05.590]  Yeah.
[40:05.590 --> 40:05.990]  Yeah.
[40:05.990 --> 40:07.990]  No Lennox is six now.
[40:07.990 --> 40:11.590]  So oh my God.
[40:11.690 --> 40:12.190]  Yeah.
[40:12.190 --> 40:12.390]  Yeah.
[40:12.390 --> 40:14.690]  He's a he's skiing all the way from the top of the mountain
[40:14.690 --> 40:15.890]  to the bottom that bugger.
[40:17.590 --> 40:18.290]  He's trouble.
[40:18.390 --> 40:19.490]  He really is.
[40:19.790 --> 40:22.390]  Are you are you heading back to Hawaii anytime soon?
[40:23.090 --> 40:26.890]  You know, we spent a good three months out there last year and
[40:27.290 --> 40:28.790]  we've been hitting it pretty hard here.
[40:29.490 --> 40:32.390]  I'll probably get out there maybe in a month when we get through.
[40:32.990 --> 40:35.490]  We just took down one of our indoor rooms.
[40:35.890 --> 40:40.290]  We're about to hit the greenhouse next this coming week and then
[40:41.090 --> 40:45.090]  then we've got one more 24 lighter to pop off in like two more weeks.
[40:45.290 --> 40:49.390]  And as soon as I get through that and get everything washed out.
[40:49.490 --> 40:53.390]  We'll have a little bit of a break and probably get home and catch
[40:53.390 --> 40:57.390]  some Sun and some surf and see if at one time at one point in time
[40:57.390 --> 41:01.590]  you mentioned something about maybe opening up a an operation there.
[41:02.590 --> 41:03.790]  Two licenses and stuff.
[41:03.790 --> 41:04.290]  How'd that go?
[41:04.290 --> 41:05.890]  Did you ever go through with that?
[41:06.690 --> 41:09.990]  Oh, no, that's subject.
[41:11.890 --> 41:12.690]  No, we did.
[41:12.690 --> 41:17.190]  We put we put a lot of effort into into trying to get a license out
[41:17.190 --> 41:17.490]  there.
[41:17.890 --> 41:20.890]  They they had incredibly high barriers to entry.
[41:20.990 --> 41:25.290]  I mean you had to you had to have some really crazy stuff and you
[41:25.290 --> 41:29.690]  know, we found people to work with and put in our application and
[41:30.090 --> 41:33.890]  got denied for a technicality that wasn't, you know, they basically
[41:33.890 --> 41:36.790]  said that my wife wasn't old enough.
[41:37.790 --> 41:40.090]  They said she wasn't 21, but that's incorrect.
[41:40.090 --> 41:43.390]  She was, you know, well over 21.
[41:43.790 --> 41:45.890]  So but by then they had already awarded.
[41:45.890 --> 41:46.890]  It was just crooked.
[41:47.090 --> 41:49.290]  I mean, I just come right out and say it, you know, it was
[41:49.290 --> 41:50.790]  super crooked the way that they did it.
[41:50.890 --> 41:55.390]  So we got boxed out and the folks that are in there in there and
[41:55.390 --> 41:55.990]  good for them.
[41:56.790 --> 42:02.690]  But yeah, that was and hopefully, you know, they they go full
[42:02.690 --> 42:03.690]  legalization right now.
[42:03.690 --> 42:07.590]  It's just medical and they've got basically if you got a license
[42:08.590 --> 42:12.190]  on any given Island, there was a couple two to one two or three
[42:12.290 --> 42:13.390]  depending on the size of the island.
[42:13.390 --> 42:17.090]  I think Oahu maybe had four but Big Island had two and basically
[42:17.090 --> 42:20.490]  you got granted a monopoly to vertically integrate.
[42:20.490 --> 42:22.990]  So you got a couple gardens and you got a couple stores and nobody
[42:22.990 --> 42:23.690]  else could play.
[42:23.890 --> 42:26.990]  I think that patients still can grow their own medicine there,
[42:26.990 --> 42:30.590]  but they've they've reduced their your plant counts and stuff
[42:30.590 --> 42:31.990]  just like they did here in Washington.
[42:31.990 --> 42:37.190]  I mean, it's the same story no matter what state you're in when
[42:37.190 --> 42:40.290]  the government wants your tax dollars are going to shut down
[42:40.590 --> 42:43.790]  your medical services and stuff because that's what they're
[42:43.790 --> 42:44.190]  doing.
[42:44.390 --> 42:45.290]  You know, that's the model.
[42:45.890 --> 42:47.890]  So just just quickly there.
[42:47.890 --> 42:50.490]  There's a Dutch Blooms sighting.
[42:50.690 --> 42:51.490]  Hey,
[42:56.290 --> 42:57.390]  what's up, man?
[42:59.190 --> 43:01.790]  Yeah, I've been lurking in the comments talking shit this
[43:01.790 --> 43:02.390]  whole time.
[43:04.390 --> 43:06.490]  Why can't I see the comments when I'm on here?
[43:06.490 --> 43:07.090]  Damn it.
[43:07.990 --> 43:09.190]  You gotta be on YouTube.
[43:10.690 --> 43:14.290]  But man, I'm so not technically savvy Mel.
[43:14.590 --> 43:15.190]  Quit.
[43:17.790 --> 43:18.390]  How you doing?
[43:19.390 --> 43:20.790]  How you doing, man?
[43:21.090 --> 43:21.990]  How you doing, bro?
[43:22.290 --> 43:22.590]  Good.
[43:22.590 --> 43:23.190]  Good.
[43:25.890 --> 43:28.190]  Yeah, I've been wanting to leak up with you man for a minute.
[43:28.390 --> 43:33.390]  We met briefly at at Shango's deal a couple years ago.
[43:33.490 --> 43:36.690]  I think it was last spring or maybe two Springs ago.
[43:37.590 --> 43:38.690]  I don't remember man.
[43:38.690 --> 43:42.690]  It's yeah, you know how my memory goes, especially.
[43:44.790 --> 43:45.490]  But yeah, sure.
[43:45.490 --> 43:50.090]  We got a hook up and yeah, talk a little bit smoking joint.
[43:52.190 --> 43:56.490]  I heard you doing some breeding trying to trying to I'm looking
[43:56.490 --> 44:01.290]  through some stuff and finding some stuff and you want to talk
[44:01.290 --> 44:02.990]  about like looking at some shit.
[44:02.990 --> 44:04.090]  This dude has been looking.
[44:04.090 --> 44:08.590]  He got he popped more seeds in the smallest area.
[44:08.590 --> 44:12.290]  Just I went through there and there was a bunch of crazy
[44:12.290 --> 44:12.690]  crazy.
[44:12.690 --> 44:15.390]  This patches this and this patches that he had so much good
[44:15.390 --> 44:18.790]  stuff up there to look at and smell is like kid in a candy
[44:18.790 --> 44:19.290]  store.
[44:20.590 --> 44:21.490]  Right on man.
[44:21.490 --> 44:24.490]  Yeah, I got I got blessed because I did the conference
[44:24.490 --> 44:28.490]  right and you know, so Pete I just got to meet a lot of cool
[44:28.490 --> 44:30.590]  people, you know, and they fucking hooked me up.
[44:30.590 --> 44:35.990]  And so I was the real truth of it is I was I've been struggling
[44:35.990 --> 44:39.590]  to be at the 502 thing, you know, I've struggled to make
[44:39.590 --> 44:42.190]  money and but it's I own the whole thing.
[44:42.190 --> 44:43.690]  It's on my it's on my property.
[44:43.690 --> 44:48.490]  So I just started shifting my perspective and realizing I can
[44:48.490 --> 44:51.790]  do some cool damage because I can run a lot of seeds and my
[44:51.790 --> 44:52.290]  client.
[44:52.690 --> 44:55.190]  Are you doing a tier 3 to tier 2 or tier 1?
[44:55.190 --> 45:00.990]  I got a tier 2 and I'm actually taking on a tier 3 as well, but
[45:00.990 --> 45:03.790]  I'm going to keep all my seed stuff on the tier 2, you know,
[45:03.790 --> 45:04.590]  it's enough for me.
[45:05.890 --> 45:06.990]  I'm looking for a chair one.
[45:06.990 --> 45:08.590]  If you know anybody want to get out.
[45:10.090 --> 45:13.190]  Yeah, man, that's the one to get there's there's a big push.
[45:13.190 --> 45:13.790]  Yeah.
[45:15.090 --> 45:18.590]  I'm not really trying to get this tier 3 but a friend of
[45:18.590 --> 45:19.990]  mine it just it was good.
[45:19.990 --> 45:22.090]  They need help and it's just really working out really well.
[45:22.090 --> 45:25.890]  So there's a processor guy that's getting involved and I'm
[45:26.690 --> 45:29.790]  I've been really excited man to be honest because the market
[45:29.790 --> 45:34.290]  is shifted in my mind and in Kaya has been the biggest fucking
[45:34.590 --> 45:38.990]  wind in my sails in terms of he's been processing hash and
[45:38.990 --> 45:41.290]  selling it and sending money to me.
[45:41.990 --> 45:44.890]  Like that that hadn't happened for a while.
[45:44.890 --> 45:49.590]  Honestly, you know, it used to be like normal like that's just
[45:49.590 --> 45:50.490]  how we did shit.
[45:50.490 --> 45:53.990]  But like man once since I got in the legal game that didn't
[45:53.990 --> 45:57.790]  happen and it just happened and I fucking super grateful to
[45:57.790 --> 46:02.290]  have you in my life and really yeah, you know, it's a good
[46:02.290 --> 46:03.490]  time to be in 502.
[46:03.890 --> 46:04.990]  Just big karma man.
[46:04.990 --> 46:06.490]  You know, you put out good karma.
[46:06.490 --> 46:07.390]  You're going to get it back.
[46:07.390 --> 46:09.390]  That's the way I look at, you know, Mary Jane always takes
[46:09.390 --> 46:10.590]  care of who takes care of me.
[46:10.590 --> 46:12.690]  I'm not going to take care of who takes care of Mary Jane.
[46:12.690 --> 46:15.890]  That's you know, it's always been that way and she'll she'll
[46:15.890 --> 46:17.890]  wash out the losers too.
[46:18.090 --> 46:20.590]  I mean, you know, they'll be around for a little bit but
[46:20.590 --> 46:21.890]  they don't stay around that long.
[46:22.390 --> 46:27.090]  I wonder if I maybe like I just am tough son of a bitch loser
[46:27.090 --> 46:30.390]  because I got a hard fucking shake man.
[46:33.490 --> 46:35.590]  Like are you gonna stick around son of a bitch?
[46:35.990 --> 46:37.090]  Bro, you're immortal.
[46:37.090 --> 46:38.290]  You cannot be killed.
[46:38.290 --> 46:39.290]  I can't be killed.
[46:39.290 --> 46:39.790]  No stop.
[46:39.790 --> 46:41.290]  It will can't be stopped.
[46:44.890 --> 46:47.890]  Yeah, that's the only way to be in this in this industry
[46:47.890 --> 46:52.090]  because you know, there's so many fucking roadblocks going
[46:52.090 --> 46:54.890]  through this life, you know, this type of life that if you
[46:54.890 --> 46:57.090]  don't have thick skin, you ain't going to make it.
[46:57.190 --> 46:58.490]  I mean, you know, you're going to quit.
[46:58.490 --> 47:00.290]  There's some it's so easy to quit.
[47:00.690 --> 47:04.790]  I think we all been there but it's so fucking easy to quit
[47:04.790 --> 47:07.290]  but you know, the people that make it are the ones that tough
[47:07.290 --> 47:08.990]  it out and keep on going.
[47:09.690 --> 47:12.690]  Well in the power of working with people to you know, like
[47:14.090 --> 47:16.890]  some guys try to start a business and do it kind of in
[47:16.890 --> 47:21.590]  the American, you know, co2 or CEO, you know, top down and
[47:21.590 --> 47:25.390]  like that works for some people but you know, I don't know.
[47:25.390 --> 47:27.790]  I'm just I'm starting to like I as one guy I've been working
[47:27.790 --> 47:29.290]  with but there's a Sunnyland grown.
[47:29.290 --> 47:30.390]  He's on here in the chats.
[47:30.390 --> 47:33.490]  He's been out helping on the farm and it's been really cool
[47:33.490 --> 47:36.190]  and I'm working with starting to work with Rob from Seattle
[47:36.590 --> 47:40.890]  Seattle chronic seeds and I can yeah super cool and that is
[47:40.890 --> 47:42.790]  it's just like night and day.
[47:42.890 --> 47:46.190]  I just I don't know if I'm feeling really jazzed about 2021
[47:46.190 --> 47:50.490]  and working with everybody and you know, it just feels I just
[47:50.490 --> 47:53.490]  have a bounce in my step about the whole whole thing, you
[47:53.490 --> 47:56.390]  know, right on I could see a difference man from you know,
[47:56.390 --> 47:57.490]  just a few months ago.
[47:57.990 --> 47:58.390]  Yeah.
[47:58.390 --> 48:00.690]  Yeah, right on man.
[48:00.690 --> 48:01.090]  It's good.
[48:01.090 --> 48:02.390]  Good to see them.
[48:02.390 --> 48:04.390]  Good viewers in the market right now.
[48:07.090 --> 48:10.190]  We're about to just keep them smashed up here.
[48:11.290 --> 48:11.890]  It's cool.
[48:11.890 --> 48:14.190]  It's cool working with the two licenses, you know, because
[48:14.590 --> 48:17.290]  because it just is not we didn't even really plan it out,
[48:17.290 --> 48:20.390]  but I just harvested in December and now he's bringing down
[48:20.390 --> 48:21.790]  and then it's going to go punk.
[48:21.990 --> 48:22.290]  Lunk.
[48:22.390 --> 48:22.790]  Lunk.
[48:22.890 --> 48:23.390]  Lunk.
[48:24.490 --> 48:24.790]  Yeah.
[48:25.190 --> 48:27.590]  Yeah, you know and having partner farms where you can share
[48:27.590 --> 48:33.290]  genetics and share best practices and you know, especially
[48:33.990 --> 48:36.790]  a network is your net worth, you know what I mean?
[48:36.790 --> 48:39.790]  Like try standing on your own and it's going to be difficult
[48:39.790 --> 48:43.890]  when you got when you got good people to fall back on and
[48:43.890 --> 48:47.590]  everybody's really pushing for this, you know, a common goal.
[48:47.990 --> 48:48.890]  It's a powerful thing.
[48:48.890 --> 48:53.190]  It's a real powerful thing and now we're seeing it in action.
[48:53.290 --> 48:57.790]  So yeah, we're about to drop some some of the some of this
[48:57.790 --> 49:03.090]  really beautiful RSO from Josh's garden out to people and
[49:03.390 --> 49:06.990]  we also got some some really Crips flowers, by the way,
[49:06.990 --> 49:08.890]  send me send me some extra for the head.
[49:08.990 --> 49:13.290]  I hope you know so I can you know, who makes their RSO and
[49:13.490 --> 49:18.090]  again, I'm with it, you know, helping with cataracts.
[49:18.790 --> 49:22.890]  I'm excited to get that that cut down to you.
[49:24.290 --> 49:27.090]  The I'm going to I announced it the other night on the show.
[49:27.090 --> 49:31.990]  I'm calling it blackwap gas in the black blackwap gas and
[49:31.990 --> 49:38.590]  the blackwap fruit the the testarosa BLR because the yeah,
[49:38.690 --> 49:39.590]  that's what I'm going with.
[49:40.190 --> 49:41.290]  No, no, I went up.
[49:41.290 --> 49:44.690]  I went up and I walked a farm up there and he had he had so
[49:44.690 --> 49:45.790]  many different female.
[49:45.790 --> 49:47.090]  It was unbelievable.
[49:47.590 --> 49:51.790]  And at the end of the walk we went in and he said, I think
[49:51.790 --> 49:52.590]  I really like this one.
[49:52.590 --> 49:55.890]  I think this is my best one and it was the most this plant
[49:55.890 --> 49:56.890]  was just black.
[49:57.190 --> 50:01.790]  It was super dark and and it had I squeezed it and it
[50:01.790 --> 50:04.890]  just the gas on it was just overwhelming.
[50:04.890 --> 50:06.890]  It was it was really incredible plant.
[50:07.190 --> 50:09.290]  So yeah, I think you got a winner.
[50:09.490 --> 50:12.090]  That's a that's a major winner that one right there.
[50:13.090 --> 50:14.090]  Yeah, and it's in it.
[50:14.090 --> 50:17.790]  I mean, I feel like what's up with you smoke light.
[50:18.390 --> 50:20.190]  It's exactly like the flavor.
[50:20.390 --> 50:23.290]  It's so when I was going when I when I when I was looking
[50:23.290 --> 50:27.590]  at it originally, I was wanting the I was rolling dog walker
[50:27.590 --> 50:30.990]  and Skittles like a little bit of Skittles in with the dog
[50:30.990 --> 50:33.990]  Walker joints and that's what kind of what I was after.
[50:35.290 --> 50:39.990]  But this one is like so I really wanted to hit that Skittles
[50:39.990 --> 50:42.690]  and I really wanted to hit that what I kind of like have
[50:42.690 --> 50:46.290]  a hard time describing that I think is the camp for kind
[50:46.290 --> 50:50.390]  of like almost a Lucky Charms marshmallow II gassy flavor.
[50:51.090 --> 50:51.390]  I don't know.
[50:51.390 --> 50:54.290]  That's kind of the way I think of it the how it comes through
[50:54.290 --> 50:56.090]  and the Gorilla Glue a little bit.
[50:56.290 --> 50:57.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:57.390 --> 50:58.390]  You know what I'm talking about?
[50:58.390 --> 51:00.690]  Yeah, I know you're talking about so I wanted that with
[51:00.690 --> 51:02.890]  the with the Skittles flavor just a little bit of it in
[51:02.890 --> 51:06.790]  there and that's the female that I selected on the on the
[51:06.790 --> 51:09.190]  first one and then this this was from the F2.
[51:09.190 --> 51:14.590]  I think I had like 1200 1500 seeds and I caught this one
[51:14.590 --> 51:19.090]  at the very end and I was just like, oh fuck and I rank
[51:19.090 --> 51:21.990]  yank the whole plant up and you saw it, you know, I think
[51:21.990 --> 51:23.090]  four weeks later.
[51:23.990 --> 51:25.990]  I yanked the whole plant right out of the bed put it in a
[51:25.990 --> 51:29.990]  pot to cuts off the the nugs the nugs flowers, you know,
[51:30.090 --> 51:34.390]  and and rooted them and prayed to God that I was going to
[51:34.390 --> 51:37.890]  get the sucker to revenge and she did and and it was a
[51:37.890 --> 51:38.590]  rough ride.
[51:38.590 --> 51:40.890]  I had a couple ones that popped up and then I couldn't get
[51:40.890 --> 51:41.190]  a bet.
[51:41.190 --> 51:41.790]  You know what I mean?
[51:41.790 --> 51:44.190]  It was like I finally got that it was like the last one.
[51:44.190 --> 51:45.190]  I'm like, oh man.
[51:45.290 --> 51:46.090]  Oh man.
[51:46.290 --> 51:47.590]  Oh man, please.
[51:47.590 --> 51:48.390]  Well, let me live.
[51:48.790 --> 51:51.890]  You're not going to take I mean you had thousands of thousands
[51:51.890 --> 51:52.690]  of plants out there.
[51:52.890 --> 51:56.190]  You're not going to take a cuts of every single one of those
[51:56.590 --> 51:59.390]  can't and track them and then at the end of the cycle.
[51:59.390 --> 51:59.890]  I got it.
[51:59.890 --> 52:01.190]  He'd like you're just not going to do that.
[52:01.190 --> 52:05.890]  So you you're, you know, revenge game or or or, you know,
[52:05.890 --> 52:09.490]  cloning the the butt at the end there, you know, you it's
[52:09.490 --> 52:11.990]  always a risk but you that's really your only option.
[52:12.390 --> 52:13.390]  What's your revenge game?
[52:13.390 --> 52:14.890]  Like what's the percentage?
[52:15.190 --> 52:17.290]  Oh, whatever first started it was shit man.
[52:17.290 --> 52:20.690]  I've been getting my ass kicked for like three or four years
[52:21.190 --> 52:21.690]  on it.
[52:22.090 --> 52:25.890]  Now I'm getting what will what if I what I did this last time
[52:25.890 --> 52:28.990]  with the cherry pie lime as I just left him right in the beds
[52:28.990 --> 52:30.190]  instead of ripping them out.
[52:30.590 --> 52:32.690]  Usually it's end of the season October.
[52:32.690 --> 52:36.690]  And so I'll go through with a shovel and I'll kind of slice
[52:36.690 --> 52:39.590]  around the thing, you know, and I'll give it like three or
[52:39.590 --> 52:42.390]  four days and I'll come back and do it a little push and I
[52:42.390 --> 52:44.690]  just kind of slowly break the root break it up right and
[52:44.690 --> 52:47.990]  tried to slow the stress down, you know before that I've
[52:47.990 --> 52:51.590]  trimmed it down to a third of what it was, you know, and
[52:51.590 --> 52:54.390]  then I throw it in a new pot and just water the fuck out
[52:54.390 --> 52:55.490]  of it throw it in the corner.
[52:55.490 --> 52:58.890]  So it's not under direct light and that was how I used to
[52:58.990 --> 52:59.490]  do it.
[52:59.890 --> 53:04.490]  And now I just leaving him right in the beds if I can and
[53:04.490 --> 53:06.690]  flipping him right back to lights and I start hit him every
[53:06.690 --> 53:09.490]  day with the fulvic acid just a little bit, you know, I don't
[53:09.490 --> 53:11.090]  want to get too deep in the buds or anything.
[53:11.090 --> 53:15.090]  Just get up a real quick spray with the fulvic acid, you know,
[53:15.090 --> 53:17.290]  if we do a little bit of nitrogen if I can, you know, and
[53:17.290 --> 53:20.890]  whatever alfalfa type shit, you know, that's it and I just
[53:20.890 --> 53:26.590]  be patient and you know, right now this is I think week three
[53:26.590 --> 53:27.390]  or four.
[53:27.790 --> 53:28.690]  What would you say?
[53:28.790 --> 53:32.290]  What percentage are you getting on your survival's?
[53:34.190 --> 53:40.490]  Right now I'm on week four and I have probably out of 20 20
[53:40.490 --> 53:41.290]  ish plants.
[53:41.290 --> 53:44.490]  I probably have two to three already started with like, you
[53:44.490 --> 53:47.790]  know, pop something popped up in it and almost everything
[53:47.790 --> 53:51.290]  else has green in there where I'm like it's coming in
[53:51.290 --> 53:51.790]  Sunnyland.
[53:51.790 --> 53:52.390]  He's in the back.
[53:52.390 --> 53:55.290]  He can probably verify we go in there every morning and
[53:55.390 --> 53:57.990]  you're getting good survival rates off your yeah, I'm getting
[53:57.990 --> 53:58.590]  pretty good.
[53:58.990 --> 54:01.890]  Yeah, but it took me a while and I've lost a lot of shit, you
[54:01.890 --> 54:02.690]  know, learning.
[54:03.890 --> 54:07.690]  I'm up to about if I do 20 on the revenge I get about 19
[54:07.690 --> 54:08.190]  back.
[54:09.090 --> 54:12.290]  Yeah, tell us no, what's your process?
[54:13.290 --> 54:14.690]  I just cut them back.
[54:14.990 --> 54:15.990]  See I'm in pots.
[54:16.090 --> 54:18.690]  I'm not in the ground.
[54:18.890 --> 54:21.190]  So I just cut him back.
[54:21.390 --> 54:26.790]  I leave for four nodes up to two four nodes, you know branches
[54:26.790 --> 54:31.990]  up when I harvest and I don't even transplant.
[54:31.990 --> 54:35.290]  I just watered straight water for about a week wash all that
[54:35.590 --> 54:38.690]  food out that whatever's left and then I start feeding really
[54:38.690 --> 54:41.390]  light and the main thing when you're revenge.
[54:41.990 --> 54:43.290]  People tend to over water.
[54:43.290 --> 54:44.990]  That's how you kill your revenge.
[54:45.690 --> 54:46.790]  You don't want over water.
[54:47.690 --> 54:50.090]  They just shut down for like a week or two and they don't do
[54:50.090 --> 54:53.390]  shit because they have no respiration up top.
[54:53.390 --> 54:56.090]  There's nothing to take that water out of the dirt, right?
[54:56.090 --> 54:58.590]  Because you cut all the top off when you harvest it.
[54:58.790 --> 55:01.490]  So you got to alter your watering.
[55:01.490 --> 55:02.590]  You got to cut back.
[55:03.090 --> 55:04.590]  You got to keep it just barely alive.
[55:04.990 --> 55:08.490]  But then I go 24 7 on my light to that that really helps.
[55:10.890 --> 55:14.790]  I am man about 10 years ago, maybe longer.
[55:15.790 --> 55:19.190]  I answered a quick when we were doing Craigslist clones, you
[55:19.190 --> 55:19.990]  know in port.
[55:19.990 --> 55:21.490]  This is back when I lived in Portland.
[55:21.990 --> 55:25.590]  I went to go get some some clones from this guy and he just
[55:25.590 --> 55:29.490]  invited me over and brought me into his space and he must have
[55:29.490 --> 55:33.890]  had I don't know was 24 30 some some lights in his in his garage
[55:33.890 --> 55:38.390]  type deal real nice setup and he started looking close and he
[55:38.390 --> 55:42.490]  revenge the whole thing and that's how he grew every time he
[55:42.490 --> 55:44.690]  he would revenge he would do it three.
[55:44.690 --> 55:45.690]  He would go three cycles.
[55:45.690 --> 55:48.090]  I think he told me he was just running buds.
[55:48.090 --> 55:49.490]  He was running it out.
[55:49.590 --> 55:50.690]  I do the same thing.
[55:50.890 --> 55:53.290]  You know what people say that buds get smaller.
[55:53.290 --> 55:57.290]  I mean, I know some experienced growers tell me not to do it
[55:57.290 --> 55:59.790]  this way because you get smaller buds, but that's not true.
[56:00.590 --> 56:03.890]  If you cut everything back and you regrow it through veg cycle
[56:03.990 --> 56:07.690]  correctly, it grows just like a regular plant except for you
[56:07.690 --> 56:08.890]  got a bigger base.
[56:09.190 --> 56:11.190]  I mean you're going to when you go through flower again, you're
[56:11.190 --> 56:15.090]  going to have huge clothes if you do it right and I've flowered
[56:15.090 --> 56:18.490]  a plant the most of flowered one plant was either four or five
[56:18.490 --> 56:18.690]  times.
[56:18.690 --> 56:19.490]  I can't remember.
[56:20.390 --> 56:20.990]  That's cool.
[56:21.290 --> 56:21.790]  That's cool.
[56:21.890 --> 56:22.690]  It could be done.
[56:22.690 --> 56:25.290]  I mean just but you got to also treat the roots right?
[56:25.290 --> 56:27.890]  You got to cut back the roots a little bit and you know, put
[56:27.890 --> 56:30.690]  it in new pot every time you're you know, you go back into
[56:30.690 --> 56:31.190]  veg.
[56:33.690 --> 56:35.790]  Yeah, I don't remember if he told me if he did that or not.
[56:35.790 --> 56:37.890]  I mean that was a long time ago, but that's cool, man.
[56:37.890 --> 56:38.590]  That's really cool.
[56:39.190 --> 56:43.890]  Yeah, it could I used to when I used to grow commercially back
[56:43.890 --> 56:45.090]  in the 80s and stuff.
[56:46.490 --> 56:48.790]  You didn't want to go out and do a lot of clones because you
[56:48.790 --> 56:49.990]  have to go through a lot of supplies.
[56:49.990 --> 56:51.290]  You don't want to go get supplies, right?
[56:51.290 --> 56:53.790]  So you want to just do one big bed of clones as much as you
[56:53.790 --> 56:57.390]  can as many as you can you had one mother that I used to have
[56:57.390 --> 57:01.090]  just one mother that my mother's stay around for between five
[57:01.090 --> 57:01.890]  and seven years.
[57:03.290 --> 57:06.690]  Each mother and when you know, they got Woody the stocks got
[57:06.690 --> 57:07.590]  really thick and Woody.
[57:07.590 --> 57:08.890]  That's when I would switch them out.
[57:09.290 --> 57:12.890]  I'd borrow the mothers and bring in a new one, but they would
[57:12.890 --> 57:14.990]  stick around so that I wouldn't have to fuck with it.
[57:14.990 --> 57:16.090]  I would just have one mother.
[57:16.290 --> 57:17.990]  I mean, I will only at that time.
[57:17.990 --> 57:19.090]  I only grew two strains.
[57:19.090 --> 57:19.990]  So it was really easy.
[57:19.990 --> 57:21.890]  I didn't have to label anything that could tell them apart
[57:21.890 --> 57:25.890]  just by the look, you know, one was more Indica leaning and
[57:25.890 --> 57:27.790]  the other one was a little bit more sativa leaning.
[57:28.590 --> 57:31.790]  It was really easy to do it that way when you had two extremes
[57:31.790 --> 57:35.290]  and and you didn't have to label labeling is, you know, when
[57:35.290 --> 57:38.890]  you're doing commercial like that even labeling and Ky you
[57:38.890 --> 57:42.290]  know this it takes time and every time you're putting time
[57:42.290 --> 57:44.690]  into your grow your there you're going to get busted if you
[57:45.090 --> 57:46.990]  every time you're in or your girl you're risking getting
[57:46.990 --> 57:48.090]  busted, right?
[57:48.090 --> 57:50.790]  So you don't want to spend as much time as you you don't you
[57:50.790 --> 57:53.290]  don't want to be there if you don't have to be and and if
[57:53.290 --> 57:55.790]  you're labeling, you know, that's you're doing shit that
[57:55.790 --> 57:58.890]  you don't have to be doing and you're just putting your ass
[57:58.890 --> 58:00.990]  on the line for nothing, you know,
[58:01.990 --> 58:04.190]  Hey, there's some people out there living like that.
[58:04.590 --> 58:08.390]  I know I know there's a lesson lesson less those renegades
[58:08.390 --> 58:10.390]  man, you know, because I we live those life.
[58:10.390 --> 58:12.290]  We live that life and I know how hard it is.
[58:12.290 --> 58:16.290]  It just there's some states out there still illegal and I pray
[58:16.290 --> 58:16.790]  for him.
[58:16.990 --> 58:17.790]  I'm in their corner.
[58:20.190 --> 58:23.390]  I mean, they're the ones that you know, they are doing what
[58:23.390 --> 58:26.090]  we did, you know hiding from the law and hiding from the
[58:26.090 --> 58:26.990]  fucking Rippers.
[58:27.090 --> 58:27.890]  It wasn't the law.
[58:27.890 --> 58:29.690]  It was a fucking Rippers that I was scared.
[58:31.790 --> 58:35.790]  Yeah, as soon as you let like medical come in or or or
[58:35.790 --> 58:39.190]  recreational and you let people grow and stuff fuck man, the
[58:39.190 --> 58:40.290]  Rippers disappeared.
[58:40.290 --> 58:42.590]  They were gone, you know, I don't know.
[58:42.590 --> 58:46.990]  I think you know commercial when it wasn't worth them getting
[58:46.990 --> 58:50.290]  shot breaking into your you know, garage or warehouse, you
[58:50.290 --> 58:53.790]  know, I don't know when you got a store on every block and
[58:53.790 --> 58:55.190]  you can buy a gram for five bucks.
[58:55.190 --> 58:58.090]  Why you know, why break into someone's house to try to steal
[58:58.090 --> 58:59.590]  some weed, right?
[58:59.590 --> 58:59.890]  Yeah.
[58:59.890 --> 59:00.190]  Right.
[59:00.190 --> 59:00.390]  Yeah.
[59:00.390 --> 59:05.290]  No for real my buddy Kenny Mount Baker Highway.
[59:05.990 --> 59:10.190]  He's got a legal farm up here, you know, not too far from me
[59:10.590 --> 59:13.890]  and I think it was two or three years in a row.
[59:13.990 --> 59:18.890]  Somebody came by and stole from him up the fence took a bunch
[59:18.890 --> 59:21.590]  of stuff, you know, it's obviously someone in the area,
[59:21.690 --> 59:24.190]  you know, he calls there's just not much that could be done
[59:24.190 --> 59:24.690]  about it.
[59:24.690 --> 59:28.590]  You know, it wasn't he was a bummer, you know, and he's such
[59:28.590 --> 59:29.190]  a nice guy.
[59:29.190 --> 59:32.890]  He just took it with you know, whatever and and then this
[59:33.390 --> 59:36.790]  the last time it happened the dude and we have videos right?
[59:36.790 --> 59:39.890]  We have cameras so you can see everything you should posted
[59:39.890 --> 59:42.590]  a video of the dude jumping over and landing directly on
[59:42.590 --> 59:43.390]  a t-post.
[59:45.790 --> 59:46.290]  Oh, really?
[59:49.490 --> 59:50.490]  That's karma for you.
[59:54.290 --> 59:55.390]  Never came back.
[59:57.790 --> 59:58.690]  Movie truck.
[59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.390]  You want to hear a fucking back in the 80s.
[01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.890]  I was hanging out with these guys that while they taught me
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:09.590]  to grow it was a little click and but they were all like
[01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.690]  cranksters, right?
[01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.990]  They were bikers and they did crank and stuff and I wasn't
[01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:18.090]  really into that but they would like rip each other off of
[01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.090]  each other's crops.
[01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.590]  I mean they kick each other's doors down and take the crop
[01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.590]  and you know, they would never fight over it but they would
[01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.490]  just rip each other off and I remember riding around with
[01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.190]  Ed one day.
[01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:30.490]  I said, where are we going?
[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:30.690]  He goes?
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.690]  Oh, we're going by Joey's.
[01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:33.090]  I said isn't Joey working right now.
[01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.590]  He goes.
[01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.290]  Yeah, that's why we're going by there.
[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:37.190]  It's like fuck.
[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.690]  Hey, what I sat in the van.
[01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:39.790]  He pulled out a chainsaw.
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.990]  He cut right through the fucking side of the house and pull
[01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.390]  out.
[01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:49.190]  I mean, you know that kind of shit doesn't happen.
[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:52.490]  I hope it doesn't happen now, but I seen that shit happens
[01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.090]  like whoa.
[01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.690]  Crazy.
[01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.490]  Chainsaw right through the house.
[01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:59.290]  Yeah.
[01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.890]  I mean, what's it going to do?
[01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.590]  Call the cops.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.890]  You're killing me bro.
[01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:13.590]  It was crazy world back then but you know, these guys they
[01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:16.090]  always they had the bills in their pocket and we went to
[01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.690]  the highest, you know, all the big restaurants and on the
[01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:22.890]  strip over by the airport all the fucking top-class restaurants
[01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:23.190]  and shit.
[01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:24.890]  We'd eat there almost every day.
[01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:26.290]  I never paid for anything.
[01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.090]  I was I was kind of like like their dealer.
[01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:32.790]  I sold all their weed and they treated me like oh fuck.
[01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.490]  Yeah, but you know, I probably I probably made more money than
[01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.290]  them because you know, I know what I paid him for a quarter
[01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:40.890]  pound and I made three times that.
[01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:45.590]  So I made bank, you know, they were happy with you know, me
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.890]  getting you know, selling five selling five pounds for him
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.890]  every week, but I was happier.
[01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.190]  But that's how I started growing.
[01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.490]  Kyatt one of those dudes.
[01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.290]  He became my mentor.
[01:01:56.190 --> 01:02:01.290]  He was a his name was Ed Hilton and hopefully he's still alive.
[01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:03.390]  He was about 10 15 years older than me.
[01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:04.890]  He had he had cancer.
[01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:07.090]  I remember and that's what got him into growing.
[01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.390]  He had he had a tumor on his ear.
[01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:11.990]  He had his whole ear removed and I remember him wearing like
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.990]  a band-aid tape over his ear all the time.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.690]  But yeah, we were in a remote country.
[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:20.990]  Yeah, we were in a remote control car race and I was
[01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.690]  trying to break my cocaine habit back then.
[01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.090]  So I try to break myself.
[01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.890]  So I got into remote control cars and he was pitting with
[01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:33.390]  me and and he always had the tank and he turned around sold
[01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.390]  me a quarter for like 20 bucks.
[01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:37.990]  It was like, oh that dude's growing, you know, as soon as
[01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:39.690]  I he sold me a quarter for 20 bucks.
[01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.090]  I was like, yeah, that dude's growing.
[01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.890]  So I got, you know, I hung around with them and I said,
[01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.290]  hey, you want me to turn some of your shit and he didn't
[01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.090]  know I knew a lot of people and I was turning shit like
[01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.790]  boom.
[01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:51.790]  I was five pounds.
[01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:54.990]  There's no problem that you know, I was he I sold I sold
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.290]  out every time he cropped out.
[01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.590]  I was his drop.
[01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:03.290]  He would hit me with five pounds every well every four or
[01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:08.290]  five days every time I called him but we started on a front
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:11.190]  and before you know, I was I was given I was paying up front
[01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:15.790]  for four pounds, you know, like here's here's a here's a
[01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:21.490]  thousand bucks for a half pound, you know, prices back in
[01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.590]  the day were serious.
[01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.190]  Yeah, what got you into breeding though?
[01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:32.290]  My last bus when I lost lemon and Hoko because those are
[01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:32.990]  those two strains.
[01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:38.090]  I grew for about 22 years because I've read dogs and I've
[01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.690]  read a lot of things in my life, right?
[01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.390]  I especially dogs.
[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.990]  I bred dogs working dogs Belgian Malinois for over 22 years.
[01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:46.090]  Dang.
[01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:50.290]  I didn't realize yeah out of my lines that I bred and work.
[01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:55.390]  I had over 300 working titles on my dogs working time and
[01:03:55.990 --> 01:04:00.190]  and with that kind of confidence about breeding.
[01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.090]  I after I lost my lemon Hoko.
[01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:02.590]  I said shit.
[01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:03.490]  I'll just remake.
[01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.190]  I'll just rebreathe, you know that strain I can find I can
[01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.690]  breed it.
[01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:09.490]  I've been chasing.
[01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.590]  I've been chasing the there's one and I know this I've been
[01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:15.090]  asking him about it for years.
[01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:16.890]  It's now changed.
[01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:17.790]  The name is changed.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:22.790]  But the matter the 80 the 85 Maui Wowie the electric Maui.
[01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:24.390]  I've been looking for that.
[01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:27.990]  That's the component of the Hoko that's missing that I need
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:35.190]  to find and that I mean is the cherry bomb, you know, from
[01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:36.190]  mean mean jeans.
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.090]  He's got the marijuana.
[01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.390]  He calls it the cherry bomb.
[01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:40.190]  No, this is different.
[01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:43.390]  This is the this is fruity, but it wasn't cherry.
[01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:47.590]  I mean when we when I smoked it, it was see I pushed about
[01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:48.790]  when it came in.
[01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:50.290]  It only came in one time.
[01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.990]  It was like here for about three months and then it stopped
[01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:56.690]  it and we never saw it again the Maui it was in Washington
[01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.490]  at that time and I probably had my hands on between two and
[01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:03.390]  three or four pounds somewhere in there, but it wasn't a lot.
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:08.590]  I was selling it by the ounces back then but it was back in
[01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.790]  the 80s 200 bucks an ounce.
[01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:11.690]  That was a lot.
[01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:14.790]  Right and I was getting 200 bucks an ounce.
[01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.890]  I think that the normal price was a hundred or hundred and
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:22.590]  twenty four for an ounce of green weed green bud and I was
[01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:26.190]  getting 200 for the Maui but the Maui was it was what that
[01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:29.590]  one weed that you could sit around and smoke a bowl or a
[01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.390]  joint with like four or five people and not really say anything
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:36.490]  and all of a sudden you look at somebody in the room and you
[01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.990]  just bust out laughing.
[01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:40.190]  You don't even know why you're laughing right and everybody
[01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.890]  starts laughing you kind of you know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:46.490]  It's that uncontrollable laugh right that Maui did it to you
[01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.990]  and I can never find weed like that that would do that to me
[01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:53.090]  Northern Lights did that to me in 1997.
[01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:57.790]  Yeah, that's funny shit.
[01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.390]  Yeah, those that that was that was some of the the epic
[01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:08.890]  strains that I remember the Maui and there's there's some
[01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:12.490]  really good ones back then, you know, you know cam dog the
[01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.990]  reason why I really like cam dog a lot and it's only because
[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:21.190]  I've tasted that I that that's a real familiar terpene to me
[01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.290]  that I smoked it as a kid when I was like 20 years old 25
[01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:25.690]  years old.
[01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.990]  I came across that flavor before and now when I got older,
[01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.990]  it's like man.
[01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.990]  I got I just gravitated to it towards it because it's very
[01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.590]  very familiar reminds me of when I was a kid.
[01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:40.090]  So I don't know if you guys didn't I don't right.
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.290]  What's that?
[01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.290]  You're into the D.
[01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:43.990]  I like them all man.
[01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:45.490]  I've smoked sis.
[01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.290]  I smoked for I smoked D.
[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:49.290]  I smoked 91.
[01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.990]  I've had 91 for a little bit but I never got to flower.
[01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.690]  I lost her.
[01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:54.990]  I lost her before I put her in the flower.
[01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.090]  It was a skunk VAs 91.
[01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.090]  I'm gonna try to get again.
[01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.990]  It's it's in that Northwest here.
[01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:02.290]  I could probably grab it.
[01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:04.390]  But yeah, I might have a line on it.
[01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.390]  I've got to I got to smoke it.
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:13.090]  I got to meet him in Colorado this year and smoke a couple
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:13.490]  buds.
[01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.790]  He was kind of up to Memphis and buds it just you know,
[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:19.790]  lock in the flavor, you know, like right and so it was it
[01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:20.290]  was cool.
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.590]  Hey, I might get him on my breeders cast.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:25.390]  I messaged him on Instagram and say hey you want to come
[01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:27.790]  over on breezecast love to have you as a guest.
[01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.790]  He goes, I don't have a problem with that.
[01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.990]  He was short short little response, but that's cool.
[01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:37.990]  But yet you tone Willie he came by with some some bud for
[01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.790]  the 91.
[01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:40.990]  It was really nice.
[01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.890]  He does a really good job and growing.
[01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.490]  I don't know if you guys ever smoke as we did.
[01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:47.490]  I met him in Portland a number of years back.
[01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.390]  Oh my God that do can't fucking grow.
[01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:53.690]  He's what he's one of the you know, he's one of the guys
[01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.590]  that could probably win a cup pretty easy.
[01:07:55.890 --> 01:08:00.190]  I would say we did a they did a dude grows thing in Portland.
[01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:06.990]  This is a number of years ago 2017 maybe something like that
[01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.490]  anyways and then and we went they went down they came up
[01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:12.890]  to visit me and see my greenhouse and then we all hopped
[01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:15.590]  in the cars and went down to Portland and they did a comp
[01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:20.290]  there and everyone just put jars in the table and the jar
[01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:23.990]  with the last weed one and he was him dude by far, you know.
[01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:31.690]  I love that.
[01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:34.290]  That's the best has got to be the best.
[01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:36.090]  That's cool.
[01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:36.790]  Way of judging.
[01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:37.390]  We too.
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:38.390]  Oh man.
[01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.990]  I love it.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.490]  It was a fun show dude and Steve was there Steve dread, you
[01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:47.590]  know potent onyx and he was he had this I don't know he was
[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:50.490]  doing this crazy chemistry shit where he was, you know, giving
[01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:54.090]  people extracts that were like, you know, he'd be like this
[01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:55.190]  is 40 milligrams of bag.
[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.590]  I'll take two of those and he'd like no bro and I take what
[01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:05.690]  I am I just was like, you know, just they call me for skin
[01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:05.990]  eyes.
[01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:07.190]  I get the bubble.
[01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.990]  You guys have drops coming up or what are you doing with
[01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.690]  your seeds?
[01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:21.790]  Let me I'm still testing, you know, I was actually, you know,
[01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:26.390]  the my buddy Nick Risen who I work with breeding and we
[01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.790]  were credit.
[01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:27.490]  We're starting to brand.
[01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:31.090]  We haven't dropped yet, but we're testing right now, but he
[01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.190]  was a German Shepherd breeder and did did, you know, all that
[01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:38.690]  stuff, you know, testing is very very important man, you know
[01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:39.590]  for skin.
[01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:46.290]  Yeah, testing is real important even in dog, you know for dog
[01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.290]  breeding.
[01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:52.790]  We don't it's the same thing as what we're doing with cannabis
[01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:53.590]  with with puppies.
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:58.190]  Let's say if I want to do a ring sport or Schutzen work or
[01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.590]  police work with the puppy.
[01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:02.090]  We don't I don't just take a puppy and say I'm going to train
[01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.290]  it.
[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:06.190]  You got to test the puppy to see if it has the right traits to
[01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.490]  do the type of work that you want it to do right?
[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.390]  There's what we call prey instinct and defense.
[01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:14.790]  See there's only two people don't know this not a lot of people
[01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.190]  don't know this but some people do there's only two reasons a
[01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.190]  dog will ever bite in nature.
[01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.590]  One is self-protection.
[01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:25.490]  If a bear is going to eat a wolf will protect itself.
[01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:29.490]  And the second one is to for the dog to eat prey.
[01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:35.490]  So you got defense and prey and those two traits are inherent
[01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:40.290]  in it in every dog breed no matter what every dog has a level
[01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.390]  of defense and every dog has a level of prey some dogs prey
[01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:48.390]  levels are here and their defensive levels are way low and
[01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:51.390]  some dogs are the opposite meaning that if you even look at
[01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:55.290]  a dog they'll growl and bark at you while they're very defensive.
[01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.290]  Some dogs if you jump real quick, they'll try to bite you because
[01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:01.190]  they're very prey oriented.
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.090]  They react by movement.
[01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:09.690]  So those are those two instincts that we we test for and we
[01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:13.490]  promote through breeding and and and so forth in training, you
[01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:17.590]  know, okay testing and dogs testing for those traits.
[01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:22.690]  Opens the door for the breeding part for the training part because
[01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:25.890]  if you don't test if the dog doesn't have the correct traits,
[01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.690]  the training is going to be very very hard.
[01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.990]  It's going to be like Jedi's.
[01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:35.590]  Yeah, just for a minute.
[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:38.290]  What told me about I mean, they would start like day one, you know,
[01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.690]  there are date, you know, there he was doing little movements and
[01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:44.290]  trying to get him to follow and he was telling me like the selection
[01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:48.890]  Process just like the seedlings with melon was that their eyes
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:52.590]  focus at about 27 days, which is about, you know, three and a half
[01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:53.190]  four weeks.
[01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:57.590]  That's when you start putting a movement like a piece of burlap
[01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.890]  where you move move things in front of the puppies eyes to see if
[01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:01.390]  it'll follow.
[01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:05.190]  That's one way of testing to see whether it see with with the
[01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:05.690]  working dogs.
[01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:06.790]  What we want is fast development.
[01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:11.190]  We don't want a dog that their eyes develop slower than another
[01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:12.290]  puppies eyes.
[01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:17.490]  So we want to faster they develop the earlier they can train it when
[01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:22.690]  when I was training my working puppies, they would be biting the
[01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:26.290]  man in the suit before they were even teething at 12 weeks old.
[01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:28.990]  I could send him on a man and little puppy.
[01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:30.990]  Yeah, but they'd bite a man in the suit.
[01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:36.690]  This is all through selection to genetics and then train you have
[01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.890]  to motivate the puppy to do that.
[01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:43.390]  But yeah, it's it's in it and it crosses over to cannabis.
[01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:44.790]  It's the same thing for cannabis.
[01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:48.290]  What we're doing is we're doing the same thing.
[01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:49.390]  We're selecting.
[01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:54.090]  We're testing for traits and then moving them forward to breeding.
[01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:57.790]  Same thing with dogs except for we're focusing on different things
[01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.390]  with cannabis.
[01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.390]  That makes any sense to me.
[01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:06.790]  I mean, that's that's been the cool friendship that with Nick is
[01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:10.590]  I've just been learning about this and I hear one of his dogs right
[01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.790]  here is from his last breeding right here.
[01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:18.590]  Here's the difference between breeding plants and dogs that I found
[01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:21.290]  that it's a really really strict differences of black and white
[01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:22.390]  difference with plants.
[01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:27.590]  You can go generational and then back back cross with dogs.
[01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:30.390]  You can't really do that because you can't really clone a dog.
[01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:34.090]  Keep keep the the P1 generation around for a long time.
[01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:36.390]  You only have a certain amount of time to breed with it.
[01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:40.190]  So if you're going to do any back crossing or inline breeding with an
[01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:45.990]  animal has to be done within a three to four year span or you freeze the
[01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:47.590]  semen though, right?
[01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:52.090]  Yeah, but if you do that technology back in the day when I was doing that
[01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:57.390]  the frozen semen it was it was it wasn't as successful as like the
[01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:01.990]  success rate was below 50% I don't know what it is now, but it was below
[01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:08.490]  50% and and and then you know, who knows what kind of chromosome damage
[01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.390]  the frozen semen sure, right?
[01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.390]  There's all kinds of factors.
[01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:16.990]  I think doing it natural anytime you can do it natural by nature is
[01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.390]  probably the best way of doing it in my opinion.
[01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:26.390]  Because you're letting you're letting the force, you know, here's another
[01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:31.090]  thing that people don't think about is is, you know, we're all creatures
[01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:35.390]  of water and and electricity, right?
[01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:36.990]  I mean, that's what we have in this.
[01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:42.390]  That's what drives us is electrical impulses through our our nerves and
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:47.090]  our brains and so forth and it's got to be some sort of factor that that
[01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:53.390]  that that relates to when the sperm gets together with the egg.
[01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:57.690]  There's there's still two different creatures, but they're still operating
[01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.390]  with those same impulses with electricity and so forth.
[01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:05.090]  So what's to say that that you know, the lineup isn't always the same.
[01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:08.190]  Let's say and that's what that's I think that's where you have the genetic
[01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:11.290]  difference like you your two brother if you have a brother is not going to
[01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.390]  be exactly like you but you are brothers.
[01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.990]  Why aren't you exactly alike?
[01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:19.890]  It's from the same sperm and same egg donor.
[01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:23.090]  It should be exactly by theory.
[01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:28.890]  Unless there's a lot of recessives involved, but I'm saying that because
[01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:32.590]  there's other factors that we don't consider magnetism electricity
[01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:36.490]  humidity pressure atmospheric pressure.
[01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:41.790]  All those can be factors in the process of conception right when it
[01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:47.290]  conceives in a if you're if you have conception in one environment and
[01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.890]  then you have a conception in a different environment.
[01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:55.190]  You could have two different types of growth out of both cells.
[01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.890]  Sure.
[01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:00.090]  So we don't consider all those things and this is what pet plant breeding
[01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:03.890]  say if you make a cross between my blueberry back cross if I made the same
[01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:07.590]  cross blueberry back cross three, I'm going to cube it and I cubed it in the
[01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:08.290]  winter time.
[01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:11.790]  Well, those seeds grow up the same as if I cubed it in the summertime.
[01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:15.890]  Two different atmospheres working on the cross.
[01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:16.390]  Yeah.
[01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.490]  Yeah.
[01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:19.890]  No, we talk about that a lot like when you're when you're breeding if you're
[01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:24.690]  breeding indoors versus if you're breeding, you know, full cycle full
[01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:27.290]  natural cycle outdoors, you know what I mean?
[01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:29.790]  They're getting they're getting some different stuff, right?
[01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:33.990]  And if you keep breeding in that soil and growing in that soil year after year,
[01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:38.190]  there's a there's a there's a relationship between the microbes that
[01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:41.790]  are happening there between the environment right and it becomes dialed
[01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:44.990]  in it becomes more Hardy it becomes, you know, that's there's something to
[01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.390]  that right?
[01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:48.390]  That's that's the adaptogenic property of the cannabis plant.
[01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:50.390]  I mean most plants any of them right?
[01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:51.790]  That's how they survive.
[01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:53.290]  Are you ready?
[01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:53.690]  Yes.
[01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:55.890]  Do you do right?
[01:16:55.890 --> 01:17:01.990]  They say with right that we were were like a hundred or a thousand bacterial
[01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:03.390]  cells per human cell, right?
[01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:04.490]  So we're way far more.
[01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:07.190]  We're ten to one more bacterial than we are even human.
[01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:12.790]  What about in plants, you know, and in humans, that's the part of the DNA that
[01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:16.790]  can that can move a little bit right human DNA doesn't really change in our
[01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:17.390]  lifetime.
[01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:20.790]  But but yet we put us in different environments, right?
[01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:25.190]  We're going to put clone you and put you in a bunch of different environments
[01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:28.590]  and you're going to develop differently and that's that's those microbes that
[01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:30.790]  are part of your body even adapting right?
[01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:35.390]  So I would imagine the same kind of stuff is happening with plants as they're
[01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:39.290]  interacting with the microbes in the soil and interacting with the environment
[01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:42.690]  at the same time, you know, I mean, that's that's the that's that's the
[01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:47.690]  natural information that they're inputting and then the genetic stuff is
[01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:50.290]  making its choices inside of the plant.
[01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:51.390]  Here's one up for you.
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.790]  Okay.
[01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:55.990]  Okay, that makes sense what you're saying, but we none of us really consider
[01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.590]  you guys.
[01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:01.390]  I keep on hitting on this and I did stir some conversation a few months ago
[01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:06.890]  with somebody about the golden ratio the Fibonacci code that's in every
[01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:08.390]  everything that in nature.
[01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:12.590]  It has to be it has to have a play, you know, we saw the pennant Punnett
[01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:16.590]  Square come up and that's Mendel and Slough, right?
[01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:22.290]  But when Mendel wrote the Punnett Square or discovered or described the
[01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:24.090]  Pennant Square, he never considered.
[01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:27.890]  I don't think he considered the Fibonacci code the golden ratio and how
[01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:28.890]  it plays into it.
[01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:29.990]  Why not?
[01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:33.790]  It has to it just makes sense that it has to right?
[01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:38.390]  Yeah, unless you can think of a reason why it would be excluded.
[01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:43.290]  I mean if it's in every scenario, I always think the coolest part of that
[01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:47.990]  Bell is we talked about it in the Korean natural farming stuff, right?
[01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:52.590]  So when you make your ferments, you're only filling up the jar two-thirds
[01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:57.090]  of the way so that you've got that that that golden that that ratio and
[01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:00.790]  that's without that you need that right and then when they talk about
[01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:05.890]  Earth where we live and then the atmosphere, it's also a golden ratio,
[01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:06.090]  right?
[01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:10.390]  So center of the Earth to the deal is like two-thirds and then outer crust
[01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:12.390]  to the top of the atmosphere is the one-third, right?
[01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:16.090]  So it's it's like we're in that fermenting zone everything were fermented,
[01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:18.190]  you know, and so to speak right?
[01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:21.490]  I mean, that's that's why we're alive the microbes were there there with
[01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:25.190]  us were there with them and without that ratio we wouldn't exist.
[01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:33.290]  So just quickly I told Tyler you guys were talking about dog semen and
[01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:36.590]  he was like I could contribute to that conversation.
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:42.090]  So Tyler with that with that with that welcome to the conversation.
[01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.690]  I was like dog semen? I got right the fuck up.
[01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:45.690]  I was like let's do this.
[01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:47.590]  Howdy Tyler.
[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:51.490]  I was reading books getting the kids down.
[01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:58.090]  Gonna sneak out to the old hut do some smoking some shucking of some beans.
[01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:05.490]  I got some badass fucking Pam 1 and Pam 15 to the Testarossa Black
[01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:06.190]  Lamb Reserve.
[01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.990]  I got from Josh sitting right there some of the beans.
[01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:10.690]  I selected a cool fuel mill out of there.
[01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:13.390]  I'm doing all the pulling the seeds out of there.
[01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:14.190]  They're all beautiful.
[01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.690]  So yeah, I'm going to get ready to go to work.
[01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:21.890]  I got coffee brewing and my second shift starts now.
[01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:23.890]  I got to wake up these fruit trees in the morning.
[01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:27.190]  Calling in some dog walker earlier man.
[01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:30.890]  It's fucking the rest of the wicked dude, you know, this guy you this guy
[01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.190]  is always working man.
[01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:36.390]  He's like me like I'll text him and it'll be like 12 p.m.
[01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:37.490]  12 a.m.
[01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:39.290]  Or be like 4 a.m.
[01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.290]  He's always working, you know, doing something.
[01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:47.090]  Up doing something man.
[01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:49.390]  It's a crazy time of year right now.
[01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:53.090]  We got fruit trees like a motherfucker and it's it.
[01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:56.690]  We haven't been as cold as we normally are and trees are waking up.
[01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:59.590]  People are panicking, you know, their peaches and shit are waking up and
[01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:00.590]  everybody's got shit.
[01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.590]  They need to get, you know, prepped and ready and planted and pruned and
[01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:05.190]  all that shit.
[01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:09.090]  So I've been going like non-stop 24 7, you know.
[01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:13.390]  Um, can I kid?
[01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:17.590]  Can I ask you about avocados in terms of in terms of terms, you know,
[01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:18.690]  avocados, right?
[01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:21.690]  So yeah, I have a I grew.
[01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:24.190]  I think this is a pertinent to our discussion.
[01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:25.390]  Maybe I hope it is.
[01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:29.990]  I grew a couple avocados from pits and they're about eight years old.
[01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:36.890]  Just not just for bullshit reasons, you know, and and I was online the
[01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:39.390]  day early in the morning or something.
[01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.490]  It's awesome guy talking about.
[01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:42.890]  He's like, oh one in 10,000 avocados is good.
[01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.390]  And I'm like, come on, bro.
[01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:45.690]  One in 10,000.
[01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:49.790]  Give me a fucking break one in 10,000 and right there.
[01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:53.890]  But right then and there I ordered some some four-year-old avocado.
[01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:58.590]  You know, because I think right?
[01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.290]  Yeah, but I know you popped a lot of avocados.
[01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:05.390]  And so I just was curious as in your an avocado country, you know, like
[01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:09.590]  talk about avocados at first definitely not one in 10,000.
[01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:16.390]  It's most of the time people don't have the patience to get them to start
[01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.590]  bearing, you know around here.
[01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:20.790]  It'll take them 10 years, you know, eight to ten years to start bearing
[01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:27.790]  and a problem with avocados people think that they'll plant a seed and
[01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:30.990]  it won't be it won't be viable or whatever.
[01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:32.990]  It will never produce or any of those things.
[01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.990]  And those are crazy things.
[01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:39.390]  And the reason the reason why that that that whole misconception happens
[01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:42.590]  is because there's a types and there's B types of avocados, right?
[01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:47.190]  And like it takes an avocado a while like an A type, right?
[01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:48.290]  Is it is a Haas?
[01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:49.390]  Okay, good example.
[01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:50.190]  Haas is an A.
[01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.590]  Always an A.
[01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:54.290]  Every Haas you ever seen came from a cutting cutting is an A.
[01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:55.690]  Reed is an A.
[01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:59.390]  There's there's there's B's, Fuertes are B's, Bacon's are B's.
[01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:03.790]  But what the importance of that is when the flowers open on A types,
[01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:07.690]  and I always get it mixed up, but the first day that the flowers open,
[01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:11.590]  they're all male parts and then that they close up, you know, after their
[01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.590]  period of time their day or two or their evening or their cycle and then
[01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:17.790]  they reopen again and they've changed sex and their female parts, right?
[01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:22.990]  So that a single flower tassel on an A plant, a young little plant going
[01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:25.890]  there around for a while, you know, a short period of time can set a
[01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:29.090]  flower tassel out and they usually don't set a whole bunch of flower
[01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:31.390]  tassels that are open and then close in at different times.
[01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.390]  It's usually just one or two good flowers, you know, stocks.
[01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:37.790]  They're all opening and closing on the same schedule and you don't get
[01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:42.090]  pollination that way unless you have a B type of avocado because the B has
[01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:44.690]  the opposite flower cycle schedule, right?
[01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:49.090]  So whatever they is the first day they open their their one sex and they
[01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:53.090]  close up the B's the opposite and they do the same thing the opposite way.
[01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:57.290]  So when every avocado grows around the world or you know, wherever they
[01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:02.690]  grow avocados, they'll plant 10, you know, 10 hosses or you know, whatever
[01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:07.290]  for every one bacon or every one Zutano or every one Fuerte so that you
[01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:11.790]  ensure that you have a B, you know, flower or another type of avocado
[01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:15.790]  that's on an opposite, you know, type of schedule where there'll be more
[01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:17.290]  male and female parts present.
[01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:25.690]  But that same hoss avocado can produce its own fruit by itself after a long
[01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:30.790]  time of growing and becoming mature because when it sets flowers when it's
[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.990]  old and mature it's setting some flowers are opening today and then some
[01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:36.890]  flower stocks are opening tomorrow and next week.
[01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:41.490]  So they're all on, you know, all on alternate schedules and it has male
[01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:44.690]  and female parts present more likely and it can kind of pollinate itself
[01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:45.490]  as it gets older.
[01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:50.290]  That's why you always hear like avocados won't produce fruit for 10 years
[01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:53.490]  or you know, 12 years or seven years from a seed.
[01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:57.290]  It's just because it needs to have that maturity to be able to set flower
[01:24:57.290 --> 01:25:00.190]  tassels that are open in a different time so it can pollinate itself.
[01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:06.290]  But as far as the fruit being good, like every avocado we've ever gotten
[01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:08.290]  has been a chance seedling, you know what I mean?
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:12.790]  It was a chance seedling at some point, you know, a reed, a Zutano, a Mexicola,
[01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:18.190]  you know, Mexico Grande, you know, Char Wokona's, the fucking list goes
[01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.090]  on, lamb hoss.
[01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:22.790]  They were all chance seedlings at one point, you know, in a grove.
[01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:24.490]  Something happened.
[01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:25.790]  All bags.
[01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:28.390]  Yeah, all bags, right?
[01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:32.290]  Yeah, somebody, somebody fucking saw this random thing growing in the
[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:32.890]  grove.
[01:25:33.190 --> 01:25:33.890]  It was a good one.
[01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:36.690]  It had a different time than the other trees, right?
[01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:38.790]  A good one is the one they call crazy hoss, right?
[01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:42.090]  In Florida, there was one called crazy hoss and it's called Carmen.
[01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:44.490]  It's called hoss Carmen and it was held tight.
[01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:48.090]  It was like, it was like the sour D or the chem dog of the avocado world,
[01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:48.490]  right?
[01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:51.890]  And it's this avocado that ripened earlier than all the other hoss
[01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:56.790]  avocados that have this, this extra, you know, this extra crop beforehand
[01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:01.090]  and it has these, these characteristics that were unlike all the other
[01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:04.390]  fruit and it was basically just a chance seedling of the rotten piece
[01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:07.790]  of fruit that fell on the ground and sprouted and over that period of
[01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:11.390]  time, you know, it was able to be pollinated a little sooner because
[01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:13.190]  it's around a bunch of other avocado trees.
[01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:16.090]  So you'll get sooner production that way, you know, better pollination
[01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:19.790]  if it does flower, but it does take them a little while to reach
[01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:24.490]  maturity to set flowers, get pollinated and then go through the
[01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:27.590]  whole process of selecting the fruit.
[01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:31.190]  So like another thing with avocados that makes it hard, which is a
[01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:34.590]  whole nother fucking thing that makes it hard to tell if your avocado
[01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:35.790]  is any good from a seed.
[01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:41.790]  Is it like every avocado has a season where your oil content has to
[01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:45.890]  get to a certain, a peak ripeness point, right?
[01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:51.390]  Like Haas's or usually like March to June, they have one of the
[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:55.290]  longest seasons, but my Fuerte we start picking like Christmas is
[01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:59.590]  like when I start picking my Fuertes, January to about March is when
[01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:02.790]  I'm eating my Fuertes and if I don't get them off by March, then I
[01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:03.790]  miss my flower cycle.
[01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.690]  But all that means is if I pick them at a different time, they'll be
[01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:12.890]  nice and big, like say in October, many months before they're ready.
[01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:15.290]  They'll look like store quality avocados.
[01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:17.490]  They'll be big and ripe and beautiful.
[01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:23.590]  But if you pick that avocado out of season, then it's watery, doesn't
[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:27.990]  taste good if it ripens up or will wrinkle and not be any good and
[01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:31.590]  edible at all because the oil content isn't right in it to be able to
[01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:34.390]  hold it through the ripening process, right?
[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:38.290]  So if you have a chance seedling, you don't know when the fuck to
[01:27:38.290 --> 01:27:39.390]  pick it, right?
[01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:43.290]  So it looks like it's ready for half the season, you know what I mean?
[01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:45.790]  When they're hanging there, if it does get to the point where it's
[01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:47.690]  actually set fruit, you don't know when to pick it.
[01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:50.390]  So it takes you a couple years to find out.
[01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:52.090]  But what do you know just by like feel?
[01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:55.090]  Like, you know, like most of us who eat avocados.
[01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:56.790]  They don't ripen on the tree.
[01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:59.590]  The thing with avocados is you have to pick them and they have to
[01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:00.690]  ripen off the tree.
[01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:05.990]  So you would pick one every two or three days and take notes, let it
[01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.190]  ripen off and then go.
[01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:08.990]  Got it.
[01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.890]  Yep.
[01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:12.690]  Or wait for it to drop.
[01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:15.290]  I always tell people to like they have this big tree with avocado
[01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.990]  tree and they're like, well, when the fuck it has fruit, but they're
[01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.790]  never any good.
[01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:20.290]  And I'm like, when do they drop?
[01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:24.990]  And then they'll pay attention to when they start dropping and then
[01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:27.390]  a month before they start dropping.
[01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:29.590]  I tell you that's when you want them next, right?
[01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:31.690]  Or a tip I tell people all the time.
[01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:33.890]  Well, as soon as the rats start eating them and you start seeing
[01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:36.890]  a rat damage on them, that's when they're that's when the oil
[01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:37.490]  contents, right?
[01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:40.090]  Because they know they can smell it better than we can.
[01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:41.790]  So you start seeing damage on the fruit.
[01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:44.890]  You know that they're getting close to being able to that content,
[01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:45.190]  right?
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:47.890]  So then that's when we start picking them and things and then so
[01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:52.590]  it just takes a little bit of like it takes time like a motherfucker
[01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:57.490]  and then it takes like effort and like, you know, knowledge of what
[01:28:57.490 --> 01:29:01.790]  possibly it could have been and then it just it just takes like, you
[01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:05.290]  know, sorting it out to be so you're going to do is have some good
[01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:07.890]  avocado tree in a grove, right?
[01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:11.390]  Already that, you know, we're badass plant some seedlings of some
[01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:14.990]  really tasty fruit that you like, you know, don't count on for any
[01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.290]  time.
[01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:18.990]  But when the time comes you'll be able to have, you know, you'll be
[01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:20.890]  able to make that decision, you know what I mean?
[01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:24.890]  But nine times out of ten, bro, that tree is going to reproduce
[01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:27.190]  just like a fucking bag seed, right?
[01:29:27.490 --> 01:29:30.490]  And it's going to be carrying those fucking genetics of whatever
[01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:31.690]  pollinated, right?
[01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:34.990]  So if you got good genetics in that in that growth, yeah, it's a
[01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:38.190]  roll of the genetic dice and you know, I mean they might not all be
[01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:43.090]  Fucking winners, you know, but you're not one in 10,000, you know
[01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:43.390]  what I mean?
[01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.190]  That's just fucking crazy talk, you know what I mean?
[01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:47.690]  That's just like that's not taking the time, you know what I mean?
[01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:52.390]  In my opinion, but I've seen lots of what I just learned is that
[01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:59.390]  even and I just learned that like even like the the the Hass
[01:29:59.390 --> 01:30:04.690]  avocado that I ordered in the bacon that I ordered it just being a
[01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:05.690]  Dumbo grower.
[01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:09.390]  If I don't know the cycles, I'll pull them at the wrong time and
[01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:10.590]  they may not taste good.
[01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:11.490]  That's on her.
[01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.390]  Yeah.
[01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:13.490]  Yeah, it happens to me all the time.
[01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.990]  I didn't know that.
[01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.790]  Yep.
[01:30:14.890 --> 01:30:15.190]  Yep.
[01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:18.290]  You gotta know and like in my in my office I got, you know, you
[01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:19.190]  know right over there.
[01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:23.390]  There's a chart of like all my avocados, you know, all my citrus
[01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:26.290]  and like there's like all these varieties of Helen hearts toss
[01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:33.090]  and it tells me season, you know, shape of tree cold taro tolerance
[01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:34.890]  and it gives me all these fucking stats.
[01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:37.190]  It's like we have under certain seed packs, you know what I mean?
[01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:39.290]  From all the years and testing and all these things and then when
[01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:41.690]  people ask me questions, you have looked at those charts for
[01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:42.490]  fucking years.
[01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:45.290]  I can just fucking I have all memorized, you know what I mean?
[01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:47.190]  And I've seen all those trees in action.
[01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:50.590]  So once you know, once you get all those things going you're like,
[01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:53.490]  oh, this is a fourth day and I can see I can see by looking at the
[01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:57.090]  leaf of an avocado tree kind of, you know, eight out of ten times,
[01:30:57.090 --> 01:30:59.790]  you know around here the varieties that we cultivate in this area.
[01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:02.090]  Like I can probably call that variety out like nobody's business
[01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:07.390]  to have certain unique features that really are subtle, but you
[01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:08.490]  can totally pick them out.
[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:09.090]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.390]  And you just kind of just like just like anything man.
[01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:12.290]  Like a vegetative.
[01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.890]  Yeah, it was cool.
[01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:16.390]  Like working at the nursery and shit.
[01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:20.090]  Like when I was a kid fucking avocado truck would come in or
[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:23.590]  a you know fruit tree truck would come in and back in be full of
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:26.390]  fucking all different types of fruit trees and I'd have this I'd
[01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:30.390]  have this chart and there'd be nobody around and I have all these
[01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:33.890]  tags and I was just a fucking kid and I'm like, okay, I pull off.
[01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:36.390]  I pull off a row of these fucking plants and I'd be like, okay,
[01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:40.090]  these are Zutanos and I would fucking look at all these Zutanos
[01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:43.290]  and I would tag the Zutanos and I was like these ones are the Fuertes
[01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.990]  and I would do that with every fucking fruit tree for years.
[01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:49.490]  We did that for years pulling them off and you just see different,
[01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:51.390]  you know those things and you can see them in the truck.
[01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:53.990]  You're like, okay after you got good you started pointing at those
[01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:56.090]  you're like, oh, I want those reeds back there those things and
[01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:58.790]  like people like how the fuck you know, it's just it's just cool
[01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:03.190]  man plants and all those are cool, but always plant the seed dude.
[01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:05.090]  Just don't hold your breath with trees.
[01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:07.390]  I mean you plant them today and just you know, have some shit
[01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.690]  that works that you know about and then you can go back to those
[01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:12.990]  ones that you make, you know what I mean a fiddle with you know,
[01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:14.590]  I'm making mangoes and shit right now.
[01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.490]  I pollinate mangoes plant mango seeds.
[01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:19.390]  I got all kinds of fucking mango trees growing around that.
[01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:21.390]  I don't know if they're going to be any good or not going to be
[01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.690]  any good.
[01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:25.490]  A lot of them are and as soon as we start getting to points where
[01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:28.190]  you know, six seven years down the line.
[01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:31.690]  They'll be ready to go but I already got other mango trees and
[01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:32.290]  other stuff.
[01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.490]  So I'm not sweating, you know what I mean?
[01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:39.490]  But so just quickly Tyler you're way off topic from our dog semen
[01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:46.490]  conversation, but but I but I wouldn't mind if you if you rift on
[01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:49.590]  mangoes the same way you just rift on avocados.
[01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:55.390]  Yeah, I like to learn about the mango breeding.
[01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:58.190]  And cultivation world.
[01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:59.090]  Yeah.
[01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:00.790]  Have you ever have you ever ran the Hayden?
[01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.590]  Hayden mango?
[01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.790]  Yeah.

[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.890]  That's it.
[01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:11.590]  I don't know what in the hell what kind of mango of these people
[01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:13.090]  been feeding me on the mainland.
[01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:18.590]  There's a what the fuck is this a good place to for people to look
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:21.490]  up mangoes and like learn a lot about mangoes with cool charts.
[01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:23.990]  You go to a Pine Island nursery.
[01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:26.590]  It's a it's a it's a nursery in Florida.
[01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:31.990]  They do a lot of the mango breeding and a lot of the selections
[01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:34.890]  and a lot of the like the preservation of the cool varieties
[01:33:34.890 --> 01:33:37.690]  and things like that, but you can go to that website and click
[01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:38.190]  on the bottom.
[01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:41.790]  They'll be like like a viewer mango viewer and like, you know,
[01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:44.490]  a bunch of other weird tropical fruit viewers and you click
[01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:46.990]  on those and sorry, hang on.
[01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:51.990]  It's not one to charge my phone and it'll pull up like all
[01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:54.990]  those, you know, these little pictures with the different
[01:33:54.990 --> 01:34:00.790]  mangoes cotton candy Hayden, you know, Tim Mateo's, you know,
[01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:01.590]  zil's.
[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:03.690]  I mean, there's there's thousands and thousands of different
[01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:05.090]  mangoes, but you can actually see it.
[01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:09.690]  I rate them like, you know, five mangoes out of five for flavor
[01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:12.790]  and growth habit and disease resistance and stuff like that.
[01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:19.390]  I wish we things so cows we can grow mangoes like crazy, but
[01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:22.890]  you'd be hard-pressed to find it in good varieties at any
[01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:25.190]  nursery's like people don't think that you can grow them.
[01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:25.790]  It's really weird.
[01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:28.890]  I'm always turning people on to, you know, growing Hayden's
[01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:33.990]  and coconut creams and Glen's and fucking Alfonzo's and all
[01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:36.790]  kinds of cool varieties are just fucking delicacies, you know,
[01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:41.190]  just just just fucking ice cream mango candy in your hand.
[01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:41.690]  You know what I mean?
[01:34:41.690 --> 01:34:42.390]  Like delicious.
[01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:43.690]  So you got to send me one.
[01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:44.690]  You got to send me one.
[01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:47.590]  Hayden mango do I'm telling you.
[01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:51.690]  Fucking commercial status, man.
[01:34:53.490 --> 01:34:54.590]  Do you do peaches too?
[01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:55.590]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:55.890]  Yeah.
[01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:56.090]  Yeah.
[01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.590]  Peaches.
[01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:00.190]  We get some up here called I think it's called a red globe.
[01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:01.390]  Yes, the globe.
[01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:01.690]  Yep.
[01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:02.090]  The girl.
[01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:03.590]  I love my favorite one man.
[01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:06.390]  They're just massive and like so delicious.
[01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:06.990]  Yep.
[01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:09.890]  There's a there's a like here.
[01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:12.390]  We don't do the we don't do the globes as much like we have
[01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:16.490]  like the Babcock's and the evil prides and the mid prize.
[01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.190]  It kind of just depends on if you're looking for like white
[01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:23.390]  flesh or the old-fashioned yellow flesh on peaches, you know
[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.790]  what I mean?
[01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:29.090]  Like you got the old school like, you know, the like the
[01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.290]  don't Georgia peaches and all those classic thing people
[01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.990]  think of as peaches, you know, I mean those yellow ones and
[01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:38.790]  here they those are like August pride and mid pride and stuff
[01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:42.090]  like that peaches and nectarines are hell of hell of fast
[01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:46.290]  producers like over producers when they set flowers and stuff
[01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:50.590]  them always we will take off 75% of them and thinning and
[01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:53.490]  fill up trash cans with just quarter-sized fruit like this
[01:35:53.490 --> 01:35:56.490]  before they're right just so we can get some some Mac daddy's
[01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:58.990]  hanging on the tree because they are just there.
[01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:00.490]  They're they're branch breakers.
[01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:01.090]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:04.190]  So peaches and nectarines you got they take a little bit more
[01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:07.890]  work pruning and and making sure that they're ready to hold
[01:36:07.890 --> 01:36:10.990]  the load and and they get a little bit more disease and stuff
[01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:14.190]  and peach leaf curl and stuff around here and and other things
[01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:17.790]  but man if you want something to produce fast in your yard
[01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:20.790]  put a peach in there, you know, I mean that second year from
[01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:24.290]  a bare root, you know, peach tree at $20 peach tree.
[01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:25.790]  You'll have some fruit dang went on there.
[01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:27.990]  You know, they're like straight to the punch.
[01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.690]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:32.390]  A mango or an avocado you're going to wait a couple years
[01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:35.990]  before you're going to be able to to pull anything of value
[01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:40.590]  out of that, you know, but started a mango time tipping
[01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:42.890]  tipping is going on a mangoes, you know right now when it's
[01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:46.090]  winter all those old flower tassels and stuff.
[01:36:46.090 --> 01:36:48.190]  We just did a bunch of tipping before it may and winter came
[01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:48.790]  like the fall.
[01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:51.990]  I do a lot of tipping on where you you kind of cut the ends
[01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:55.890]  of the mango the tips of the mango branches and like it
[01:36:55.890 --> 01:36:59.290]  makes the can be more complex and we're more bushy, but it
[01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:00.790]  cleans it all up and gets it ready.
[01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:04.190]  And then when you do good tipping at the right time, depending
[01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:06.390]  on your climate and when you're going to begin to your flower
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:09.690]  cycles are going you actually can kind of trick your tree
[01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:15.190]  into doing better production more consistently and more
[01:37:15.190 --> 01:37:18.490]  evenly through the canopy because mangoes are like notorious
[01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:21.490]  for just like setting a random flower and throwing a random,
[01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:24.390]  you know set here and then not doing it on the rest of the
[01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:27.390]  branches and you kind of you got to get all the branches
[01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:30.190]  and the whole tree on like the same page in order to put
[01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:34.490]  it into like real real production mode, you know, I mean
[01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:37.890]  I'm funky little tricks with those things.
[01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:40.990]  Terrapin and all kinds of fucking shit.
[01:37:41.290 --> 01:37:43.590]  My favorite things lately are blue Aries man.
[01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:46.190]  One of my favorite things in the world are the blue Aries
[01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:46.490]  dude.
[01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:49.590]  They're the plum and cherry crosses and those things are
[01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:54.290]  it's like a horse and a donkey.
[01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.290]  Yeah, you sent me a box of those.
[01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.990]  Yeah, I sent you a couple.
[01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:59.990]  I could yeah, those are fucking delicious.
[01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.490]  Yeah, a couple.
[01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:00.990]  Yeah.
[01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.490]  Is it really one?
[01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:02.090]  Yeah.
[01:38:02.490 --> 01:38:05.790]  Yeah, I took a took a bunch to the San Diego Zoo and we did
[01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:08.090]  the talk before COVID and stuff man people were like all
[01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:09.290]  the Hort apartment down there.
[01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:12.390]  I did a did a talk down there and was teaching about their
[01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.890]  fruit trees and stuff and I brought big box of blue Aries
[01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:20.190]  and like the whole the whole friggin Zoo like crew was there
[01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:22.590]  just like what the hell are these things?
[01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:25.590]  It's amazing, you know, so they are they're really fucking
[01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.890]  good.
[01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:27.790]  They hang on the tree a really long time, which is what I
[01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:30.890]  like a peach or something as soon as they come right you
[01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:34.790]  got like, you know, two weeks, you know, maybe a month if
[01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:37.590]  you're lucky pulling and eating some fruit off of that they
[01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:38.890]  go they go really quick.
[01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:41.290]  They come right really quick and they go really quick and
[01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:42.990]  I'll think they'd be able to make it up here.
[01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.890]  Huh?
[01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:47.490]  You think they'd hang up here some varieties would yeah,
[01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:48.090]  there's a green.
[01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.590]  That's what I was saying earlier, dude.
[01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:56.090]  I planted my bananas and and a lime and I have all these
[01:38:56.090 --> 01:39:00.390]  potted, you know fruit trees tropical fruit trees and I
[01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:02.590]  fucking started planning my greenhouse last week.
[01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:04.790]  Yeah, I couldn't handle I was like fuck it.
[01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:12.090]  You know, I've never seen I've never seen a fully functioning
[01:39:12.090 --> 01:39:16.090]  like tropical greenhouse in your type of climate like actually
[01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:18.190]  like kicking off and going but that's the way to do it.
[01:39:18.190 --> 01:39:18.490]  Dude.
[01:39:18.490 --> 01:39:20.890]  If I live where you live you bet your ass.
[01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:23.490]  I'd be having fucking mangoes and fucking avocados and they're
[01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:26.090]  you know, cost of money and we're doing it anyway.
[01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.590]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:26.590 --> 01:39:27.390]  You're doing it anyway.
[01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:28.690]  It's a little little portion.
[01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:30.790]  I thought about it and I was just like fuck it, you know,
[01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:34.890]  let's put them in there and now they got a big house like
[01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:36.290]  that in Wrights Park in Tacoma.
[01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:38.190]  It's got all kinds of crazy shit.
[01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.090]  It's like a conservatorium thing.
[01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:42.790]  It's the craziest fucking greenhouse you've ever seen.
[01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:45.990]  It looks like a big church Church Cathedral thing.
[01:39:46.190 --> 01:39:46.990]  Yeah.
[01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:49.590]  Yeah in Minnesota.
[01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.890]  Right.
[01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:51.590]  This is what a dork I am in Minnesota.
[01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:55.990]  I would go to the conservatory in the middle of winter and
[01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:59.090]  walk around my big puppy on and a pair of scissors in my
[01:39:59.090 --> 01:40:00.590]  pocket, you know,
[01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:03.890]  right into it.
[01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:06.490]  I know a little bit of a greenhouse and plug it and I'd
[01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:10.190]  have all I have nutmeg and all this shit growing and grape
[01:40:10.190 --> 01:40:13.290]  fruits and fucking steel strips.
[01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.990]  Well, okay.
[01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:17.090]  That's how I make a lot of my trees dude.
[01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:18.190]  Like I just did.
[01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:21.490]  I just did a bunch of figs like we did Black Missions and
[01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:26.990]  Tiger Pinoche and Codota and fucking black fucking Madeira
[01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:29.190]  a bunch of different fig varieties and all the fucking
[01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:30.590]  cuttings like at the nursery.
[01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:32.790]  We should just go old old man.
[01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:36.190]  Just just wheel in a fucking just a whole cart full of fucking
[01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:39.190]  these cuttings of fig branches and we used to just cut them
[01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:42.090]  up into these little, you know, six or eight inch long little
[01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:44.990]  fucking plugs and just plug them into the fucking into the
[01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:50.390]  rooting fucking block and man a little little like perlite
[01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:53.290]  maybe a little seed starter mix and a big-ass fucking like
[01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.390]  little raised bed thing.
[01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:56.890]  That's like, you know a foot deep, you know what I mean with
[01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:00.290]  some heat mats under it plug a bunch of fucking figs or
[01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:03.190]  cherimoya just a bunch of cuttings through there and then
[01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:06.490]  by the end of the summer, they'd all be like five six foot
[01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:10.290]  tall and we'd sell them all for you know, 50 60 bucks and it
[01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:11.590]  was just all those branches.
[01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:14.390]  So this time of year, that's what I always pick up is all
[01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:16.290]  the cool figs and all stuff that I don't have.
[01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:18.790]  I'll take all the cuttings of some of the stuff and I'll make
[01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:21.890]  new trees out of those and just boom got new trees all day
[01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:25.690]  long, you know, so by this summer, well, you know a bunch
[01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:27.890]  of cool figs that are ready to roll that are already ready
[01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:29.290]  to produce and stuff next year.
[01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:33.990]  So, you know got a got a reserve of figs and mulberries.
[01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:37.490]  I do a lot of that with those and I took some mangoes of
[01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:41.690]  this unknown seed variety mango from La Mesa that I've been
[01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:44.790]  caring for for the last few years and it has this cool like
[01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:46.790]  Nam Dak Mai mango.
[01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:53.090]  It's like this long like it's this long like Asian mango.
[01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:56.490]  It's yellow golden canary yellow fucking beautiful.
[01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:57.890]  It's a little crispy.
[01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:00.590]  It doesn't get super super soggy until you let it go really
[01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:04.090]  over over ripe, but it's fucking delicious a little crunchy.
[01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:09.890]  It's something similar to that this weird mango tree and when
[01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:13.290]  I was doing, you know working stuff in my brain, we're going
[01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:14.490]  to propagate this motherfucker.
[01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:17.890]  So I took a big old branch off of that sucker and I just put
[01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:20.390]  those into the propagation too.
[01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:22.590]  So we're going to try to make some of those and see if we
[01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:23.290]  get those to root.
[01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:25.590]  Hopefully don't get too cold out there and it doesn't amuse
[01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:28.590]  me because I don't have too many circles out for them.
[01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:31.790]  I have a question for you Tyler.
[01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:37.090]  I grew up in New England and it blows my mind in SoCal that
[01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:42.090]  like I mean, I just pulled cauliflower today.
[01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:43.790]  Yep.
[01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:48.190]  Do you appreciate what you can do in SoCal?
[01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:49.590]  I was just walking around.
[01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:54.090]  Are you jaded and you're like like you're so used to it that
[01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:56.290]  well my wife you're unfazed.
[01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:59.690]  So she's from she's from Rochester dude.
[01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:03.890]  She's from fucking negative 18 degree snowy weather and like
[01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:06.490]  all your fucking fruits and vegetables for the most part
[01:43:06.490 --> 01:43:09.090]  unless you're an Italian family and you got it going on like
[01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:11.790]  which a lot of you do they got cool gardens going on but they
[01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:14.990]  can't go everything out there but most everything shipped in
[01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:17.490]  there, you know, all your all your all your produce is just
[01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:19.290]  shipped in from other places, right?
[01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:24.290]  It's not it's not any good, you know, and her family her
[01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:27.090]  parents everybody like they never eaten any type of fruit
[01:43:27.090 --> 01:43:29.690]  until they started hanging out with me like literally like I
[01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:31.190]  she's never like eating mango.
[01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:34.590]  She never eaten all this weird shit like lychee and Surinam
[01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:35.690]  cherries all this weird shit.
[01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:39.790]  She nobody's ever heard of she it's unbelievable and her
[01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:43.590]  parents like where's all this stuff in you know, and I went
[01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:47.190]  back there and I was like looking around when I was back
[01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:49.490]  with you know, visiting her family and around wait.
[01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.790]  Sorry.
[01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:53.790]  Where is she like Jersey Italian or like Rochester, New York?
[01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:54.290]  I ride.
[01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:55.690]  Okay, Rochester.
[01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:59.690]  Yeah, Buffalo Rochester that whole fucking cold zone.
[01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:04.190]  But when I was driving around here like here in SoCal everybody
[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:05.490]  has a fruit tree in their front yard.
[01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:07.190]  There's a fruit tree in everybody's fucking yard.
[01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:08.390]  There's there's an orange tree.
[01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:09.990]  There's a fucking avocado tree.
[01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.690]  There's a glass.
[01:44:10.690 --> 01:44:13.090]  Simmons, you know every fucking yard.
[01:44:13.090 --> 01:44:14.790]  There's something growing in there.
[01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:17.390]  You like everything you'd be hard-pressed to not find something,
[01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:21.190]  you know, and it there it's like I couldn't find anything
[01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:24.890]  until the last day and I it was this little Italian family and
[01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:28.890]  he had a couple of sea-grown nectarines some fig tree that
[01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:32.490]  he protected the shit out of and his garden and he was his
[01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:33.190]  pride and joy.
[01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:36.390]  It was the only fucking real fruit trees that I saw like normal
[01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:39.990]  people growing like in that whole region there.
[01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:43.790]  I know there's more but like compared to here is like like
[01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:47.390]  you're saying it's like that really made me realize how we
[01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:50.290]  can we can do it all and and me and my son were walking around
[01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:53.190]  today pulling shit out of the ground and eating onions and
[01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.390]  fucking sugar snap peas and you know, all kinds of stuff that
[01:44:57.390 --> 01:45:01.090]  are that are popping up out there already radishes and you
[01:45:01.090 --> 01:45:03.490]  know, it's everybody's got snow on the ground most places.
[01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:08.090]  So I'm thankful but you know, it's always greener on the other
[01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:10.990]  side. That's today's cauliflower.
[01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:12.490]  Nice.
[01:45:13.290 --> 01:45:14.190]  Nice.
[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:15.190]  Yum.
[01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:19.190]  That was I had my six-year-old chop that. That's great, dude.
[01:45:19.890 --> 01:45:23.590]  Yeah, we pulled some good carrots today and some radishes
[01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:27.590]  and definitely California stuff, you know.
[01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:32.190]  So I wouldn't say it's very satisfying.
[01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:35.590]  Hey Peter, I'm going to check out man.
[01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:37.690]  Thank you for having me on Mel.
[01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:40.290]  It was good to catch up with you Tyler dude.
[01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:41.490]  Send us some fruit.
[01:45:44.190 --> 01:45:45.790]  I'll send you all kinds of stuff man.
[01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:49.890]  I'm gonna come to our fruit baskets for everybody watching
[01:45:49.890 --> 01:45:50.390]  tonight.
[01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:51.690]  I'll get some fruit baskets out.
[01:45:53.190 --> 01:45:54.490]  So we'll take a tour.
[01:45:54.490 --> 01:45:54.990]  We'll do that.
[01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:57.090]  We'll do a little tour one of these days on the channel and
[01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:58.390]  everybody can see the garden and stuff.
[01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:59.090]  We'll do that.
[01:45:59.790 --> 01:46:01.790]  Yeah, mean right on y'all.
[01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.890]  Less thinking.
[01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:03.690]  Much love.
[01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:04.590]  Good night, bro.
[01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.590]  Cheers.
[01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:12.390]  Tyler you got more in you or you want to call it a night?
[01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:16.690]  Man, I got a I got half a joint left.
[01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:19.490]  So I mean got a couple more questions.
[01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:22.690]  I can spit until this joint goes out or my phone dies.
[01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:28.690]  So Mel, you asked Kaya about kind of male selection.
[01:46:28.690 --> 01:46:30.890]  What's your male selection process?
[01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:32.390]  God, I love finding males man.
[01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.890]  It's one of my favorite things in the world.
[01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.590]  I like.
[01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:40.790]  Let's start with Mel.
[01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:50.290]  Oh, well, I well, it depends.
[01:46:50.290 --> 01:46:52.090]  See depends on what you're what you're looking for.
[01:46:52.090 --> 01:46:54.190]  What direction you want to go with your breeding.
[01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:59.890]  If you have a plan and you want, I'll explain to or talking
[01:46:59.890 --> 01:47:04.890]  to Kaya about layering and stuff in genetics and instead
[01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:07.190]  of just creating a female, why not create a male?
[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:09.590]  That's kind of why I went that way with the question is
[01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:14.090]  because I that's what I did in my early breeding projects
[01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:18.990]  was not I wasn't really concentrating on making females.
[01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:22.590]  I was concentrating on making breeder males by testing
[01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:26.590]  the females the sisters of the males that would give
[01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:29.390]  me a close an idea of what the males were going to be
[01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:33.090]  like and I would just breed for certain type of males because
[01:47:33.090 --> 01:47:36.690]  I wanted to use those males to cross into different lines
[01:47:36.690 --> 01:47:38.390]  and I wanted those males to be stable.
[01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:42.390]  I wanted them to be dominant and and recessive depending
[01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:43.890]  on what I was using them for.
[01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:48.690]  So like for instance, if I wanted to cross into the blueberry
[01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:54.190]  the line that I used was and I tested different things
[01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:55.290]  that I cross into blueberries.
[01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:56.990]  See what was dominant against blueberry.
[01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:58.290]  Blueberry is pretty dominant.
[01:47:58.390 --> 01:48:01.190]  What happens is a lot of times with the blueberry you'll
[01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:04.090]  get a percentage that comes back blueberry, but usually
[01:48:04.090 --> 01:48:07.890]  the F1s depending on who the male is most likely you'll
[01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:11.690]  get a lot a lot of earthy flavors that come back and that's
[01:48:11.690 --> 01:48:15.690]  been the most you know, everybody says that they get earthiness
[01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:16.290]  out of their blueberry.
[01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:19.690]  Well, that's true, but there's a lot of selection and that
[01:48:19.690 --> 01:48:22.090]  earthiness is just it's a recessive trait.
[01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:24.690]  So if you know how to breed around that and through
[01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:27.790]  that you'll get the blueberry terpenes that come through
[01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:30.590]  it. So, you know, you don't give up on it because it's
[01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:31.690]  earthy earthiness.
[01:48:31.690 --> 01:48:33.290]  You just have to select and breed through it.
[01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.290]  And when I say select males when you ask me how do I select
[01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:38.690]  males? It's not the male.
[01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:42.290]  Okay, the female gives you traits that you can select for
[01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:43.190]  so does the male.
[01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:46.190]  I mean you can't select for resin content.
[01:48:46.190 --> 01:48:49.190]  Well, I guess you can if now with some males, but you really
[01:48:49.190 --> 01:48:52.490]  can't the females the one that produces the flower structure
[01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:58.990]  basically the we want to judge both male and female on finish
[01:48:58.990 --> 01:49:07.290]  rates, but the female gives you the terpenes and the potency
[01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:10.590]  because you can't really smoke the male for that unless you
[01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:14.390]  smoke his sisters, his sisters, but the male with you can
[01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:19.290]  select the male for is what he shows you is his structure and
[01:49:19.290 --> 01:49:21.990]  that's the that's probably the strongest trait that you can
[01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:26.890]  use your mail for because you can breed anything else into
[01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:29.990]  that line through the female especially if you're if you're
[01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:34.090]  selecting the females for potency and terpenes the males for
[01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:34.590]  structure.
[01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.790]  That's kind of how I do my males is for structure.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.160]  I don't I don't really do this stem rub because I don't see
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:48.060]  a correlation me personally between rubbing the stem and
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.360]  and the end product.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.560]  I've never tagged with a piney smell or a skunky smell for
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.060]  potency at the end product.
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:01.060]  What I do is I'll walk through the garden if I can smell a
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:01.460]  plant.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.960]  I mean, there's certain terpenes that just stick out itch and
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.160]  just pop right up those deserve a little bit of interest and
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.860]  attention, but I don't really do any any artificial stem rubs
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:13.560]  or anything like that.
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:17.660]  I just really don't I mean I did but I didn't see any any
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:20.760]  correlation with the end product with the stem rubs.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.760]  So just to me, I mean, what does it do?
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:29.060]  It smells really cool when it's been veg, but that's not what
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.160]  we're smoking, right?
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.960]  We're smoking the flower at the end.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.760]  That's what we want to test and see see if you know the
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:37.960]  correlation between stem rub and the end product then yeah,
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.860]  that makes sense.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.660]  But if you don't you're just doing a blind test on the stem
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:43.960]  rub. What is that proof?
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.460]  What are you going to what are you shooting for?
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.860]  So that's that's the way I look at it.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.000]  Tyler I was cracking up.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.000]  You were like doing doing doing doing doing doing.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.100]  And you're muted.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.900]  You got to unmute yourself.
[01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:13.830]  Then my phone is like there we go.
[01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:14.630]  Push the button.
[01:51:14.730 --> 01:51:16.230]  It won't take my finger.
[01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:17.330]  I don't know what the deal is.
[01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:18.330]  It must be dirty.
[01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.730]  I don't know.
[01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:20.930]  I'm like pushing the button over and over again.
[01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:21.430]  Nothing.
[01:51:23.130 --> 01:51:24.030]  Over and over again.
[01:51:25.530 --> 01:51:26.630]  Yeah, I like to test.
[01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:30.930]  I like to do lots of testing on my males as of late, you know,
[01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:34.810]  a lot of intuition goes into what males I like to use, you
[01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:38.830]  know, initially unless I'm doing a specific project.
[01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:41.310]  I'm doing some sort of preservation and then you know,
[01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:43.310]  there's different rules, but if I'm just like looking through
[01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:46.810]  some a line or something and there's there's a plant in
[01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:51.610]  there that looks looks like a female acts like a female
[01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:55.110]  catches my attention in any way and turns out to be a male.
[01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:58.490]  I'm always tag certain plants that kind of like kind of just
[01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:02.690]  stand out among the group and once they kind of stand out
[01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:06.290]  among the group and kind of work their way up into you know,
[01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:10.290]  more of my frontal vision then, you know, I watch them a little
[01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:12.690]  closer and if it really turns out to be something kind of
[01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:13.210]  interesting.
[01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:14.710]  I'm looking to use that.
[01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:19.390]  I would like I take take some leaf samples and I have it
[01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:22.990]  tested for for what what's in there because you can't like
[01:52:23.010 --> 01:52:25.990]  like you're saying, you know, you can't you know, you don't
[01:52:26.010 --> 01:52:27.410]  know you don't know you don't know.
[01:52:28.210 --> 01:52:30.510]  So Lola is your kind of girl?
[01:52:32.210 --> 01:52:34.510]  I said Lola is your kind of girl.
[01:52:34.710 --> 01:52:36.510]  Lola is my type of girl.
[01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:40.810]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:42.210]  Okay, Tyler.
[01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:46.490]  Do you let your males finish out or do you flower them all the
[01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:47.010]  way out?
[01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:48.810]  I flower them all the way out.
[01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:50.110]  I take cuts of my males.
[01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:51.290]  I like to flower them all the way out.
[01:52:51.310 --> 01:52:53.610]  Actually, resin males are my thing.
[01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:57.690]  So 90% of the time, you know, male ain't going to make the
[01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:00.210]  cut, you know, it just it just isn't it just
[01:53:01.210 --> 01:53:04.190]  you know, I see a hundred thousand freaking males, you
[01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:07.690]  know, and a lot of people pick up this big strong buff
[01:53:07.710 --> 01:53:10.490]  rocking, you know, kick-ass looking male and that's great
[01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:11.790]  for certain things, but
[01:53:12.690 --> 01:53:16.090]  I always like those dainty special ones, you know, and
[01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:18.870]  most people don't even believe that there are resin males
[01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:21.370]  existed, you know, but I've been I've been playing with
[01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:23.470]  those things for as long as I can remember.
[01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:27.770]  Final males just had some had some trikes on them and early
[01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:29.990]  triking males are always
[01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:32.790]  ones that I can almost guarantee that I'm going to use
[01:53:33.190 --> 01:53:34.090]  when they're when they're
[01:53:34.690 --> 01:53:36.190]  early and strong
[01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:39.770]  before they even get finished out before they even make it
[01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:43.650]  to, you know, week 4 to 6 to 10 to 12, depending on what the
[01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.370]  strain is.
[01:53:45.170 --> 01:53:47.650]  If they're already throwing trikes or their or their leaves
[01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:50.370]  or their stocks are really greasy and tacky.
[01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.070]  I like that.
[01:53:52.570 --> 01:53:52.970]  I do.
[01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:56.970]  I like taking those grease and tacks and resin and I like
[01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:00.150]  I like to hope that those correlate and those males in my
[01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:04.070]  testing experience have always tested highest in, you know,
[01:54:05.070 --> 01:54:06.170]  everything obviously.
[01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:09.370]  But I'm a resin male type of guy.
[01:54:09.370 --> 01:54:12.450]  So and if I find a resin male, I love letting them flower out.
[01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:15.050]  It's one of my favorite things and I always have cool pictures
[01:54:15.070 --> 01:54:16.770]  of males that are always flowered out.
[01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:18.270]  I love taking like
[01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:20.070]  stocks of males
[01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:23.750]  cutting off the flower, you know, stocks a week before
[01:54:23.770 --> 01:54:26.270]  they like dropping the pollen and like collecting those and
[01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:28.850]  you know, collecting pollen with those, you know, in little
[01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:31.450]  days and I keep them hanging up in the house for a little
[01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:32.170]  while.
[01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:34.270]  I like I like males, you know.
[01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:35.470]  Have you seen any...
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:36.970]  Mr. Cressey likes males.
[01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:39.370]  What's going on with the...
[01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:40.770]  Is that a headlamp Beanie?
[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.970]  Dude.
[01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:43.470]  That's cool.
[01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:46.270]  This got Bluetooth capabilities.
[01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.670]  I listen to the phone with Bluetooth.
[01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:48.670]  I've been listening to you guys all night.
[01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:49.570]  Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:50.770]  I just I had to.
[01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:51.970]  No, that is cool.
[01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:55.970]  And I can charge it like with a USB
[01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:58.370]  cable.
[01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:59.470]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:00.470]  No batteries are running.
[01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.970]  So that's
[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:03.170]  you know, it's not that weird to check out.
[01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.770]  100% dude.
[01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:05.170]  Farmer.
[01:55:05.170 --> 01:55:06.170]  True farmer, bro.
[01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:07.070]  I'm out there, dude.
[01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:07.970]  I got shit to do.
[01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:09.770]  Hey Tyler, have you seen...
[01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:12.970]  Have you ever seen any males reverse back to females?
[01:55:13.170 --> 01:55:14.970]  I'm actually doing that right now, man.
[01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:16.970]  I'm doing that with some florel right now.
[01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:17.570]  My...
[01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:19.370]  You're forcing it?
[01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.970]  I'm reversing.
[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:21.770]  I've seen them done.
[01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:22.470]  I've seen them.
[01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:23.470]  I've seen them reversed.
[01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:24.070]  I've seen
[01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:25.670]  beautiful stuff.
[01:55:25.670 --> 01:55:26.870]  I've seen 707,
[01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:30.870]  you know, take back some males and some beautiful stuff.
[01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:31.870]  Me and Mr.
[01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:33.170]  Toad have talked about it.
[01:55:34.770 --> 01:55:35.270]  Have you ever...
[01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:35.870]  Have you ever...
[01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:38.070]  Have you ever seen it without any
[01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.870]  hormones at it?
[01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:41.170]  I've seen
[01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:43.770]  hermaphrodite males.
[01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:45.570]  Like where they're...
[01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:47.570]  where they're male for a while.
[01:55:47.670 --> 01:55:48.170]  Yeah.
[01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:49.370]  And all of a sudden they start throwing,
[01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.870]  throwing,
[01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:52.970]  you know, throwing hairs and trying to pollinate themselves
[01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:53.570]  and start getting all...
[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:54.470]  I had a couple of those.
[01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:55.870]  ...wacky and shit like that, you know?
[01:55:56.170 --> 01:55:57.070]  Yeah, that was weird.
[01:55:57.070 --> 01:55:57.570]  Yeah.
[01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:59.470]  Yeah, I've seen that a few times,
[01:55:59.770 --> 01:56:00.270]  which is kind of...
[01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:03.470]  I even collected some seeds from just out of curiosity.
[01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:04.270]  He's like, okay.
[01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:05.370]  I always wanted a pop.
[01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:09.070]  That's what I'm doing with this reverse male finally
[01:56:09.070 --> 01:56:10.470]  because, you know, me and Mr.
[01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:12.670]  Toad were talking about it and I always have floral,
[01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:13.670]  you know, with me.
[01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:17.350]  Like I use it for olive trees and stuff anyway to suppress
[01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:19.570]  flowers and fruit drop and all kinds of stuff.
[01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:22.370]  So when I figured out I could use that to reverse males,
[01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.970]  I'm like, shit, dude,
[01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:24.770]  I probably got some of that in my truck right now.
[01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:28.250]  So I kind of figured out what I'm doing and I'm playing
[01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:31.070]  around with that right now with a pandemic male.
[01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:34.950]  So he's already a resin male as it is one of the ones that
[01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:36.570]  I kept, I made, you know,
[01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:41.270]  it's a TK Chem 91, Pam Anderson,
[01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:45.070]  and it's a resin male that I selected out of the group
[01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:47.870]  and he's kind of tall and lanky, but he's greasy.
[01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:51.050]  He drops some actual friggin, you know, resin heads on him
[01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:55.050]  and he doesn't throw any friggin hairs or anything
[01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:57.570]  at any point fully flowered out or not.
[01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:59.870]  He re-vegs really nice.
[01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:01.070]  He's fucking tough.
[01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:02.970]  It's a good, it's a good fucking male.
[01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:04.270]  He's got, you know, he's...
[01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:07.850]  That's important, a male that re-vegs, that's real important
[01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:08.870]  in my garden.
[01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:09.670]  Yeah, that's yeah.
[01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:09.870]  Yeah.
[01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:10.970]  Yeah, big, big thing.
[01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:13.550]  I like looking at roots on there, the ones that have the
[01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:16.450]  biggest, nastiest root system, regardless of what's up top,
[01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:19.570]  you know, the ones that clone easy, stuff like that,
[01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:21.470]  but we're gonna, we're reversing that.
[01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:23.770]  We just started that, we just started that process, man.
[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.370]  So we're gonna see what that actually does, you know, to him
[01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:29.250]  and it should be really interesting, but I'm gonna let
[01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:31.430]  him pollinate himself too, because I've got, you know, I
[01:57:31.450 --> 01:57:32.050]  got cuts.
[01:57:32.050 --> 01:57:34.930]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do a weird male project
[01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:37.630]  and I'm gonna plant those fucking seeds and we're gonna
[01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:40.030]  see what comes out of those, you know, so that's, that's,
[01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:41.350]  that's up on deck right now.
[01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.850]  So that's funny.
[01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:42.850]  You know what would be weird?
[01:57:42.850 --> 01:57:46.630]  If a breeder made a goal out there to breed a hundred
[01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:47.750]  percent Hermes.
[01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:48.450]  Yeah.
[01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:50.850]  I mean, wouldn't that be weird?
[01:57:50.850 --> 01:57:51.350]  Just like...
[01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:52.250]  That would be weird.
[01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:54.150]  Hey man, you know, I mean...
[01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:55.550]  Every seed's gonna be a Herme.
[01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:56.550]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:57.650 --> 01:57:58.950]  You know, I mean, who knows?
[01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:02.650]  I mean, it's weird, like, a lot of people talk like the male
[01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:06.050]  carries more information on its chromosome.
[01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:09.850]  There's weird things that it could be holding or doing.
[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:11.730]  It's not, you know, I mean...
[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:14.330]  Tyler, out of all the crops that I've grown out of all my
[01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:16.550]  years, the most potent plants
[01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:19.050]  that I had to kill off were Hermes.
[01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:22.530]  I mean, they were the, I mean, it's like, oh my fucking God,
[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:24.350]  why did you do a hermaphrodite?
[01:58:24.850 --> 01:58:27.730]  Yeah, they're just glitz and early as fuck and just beautiful.
[01:58:28.330 --> 01:58:32.730]  Yeah, and the smell is just greasy, just dripping.
[01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:34.330]  Oh my God.
[01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:35.930]  It just always happens that way.
[01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:37.730]  The best ones are always Hermes.
[01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:39.130]  It just seems like it.
[01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:41.710]  And that's funny because like, you know, all those crosses
[01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:43.910]  that come out from those Hermes crosses, you know, all those
[01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:45.910]  accidental fucking pollinations, you know, they're
[01:58:45.930 --> 01:58:47.430]  always just fucking fired.
[01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:49.630]  All the legends are Hermes, they came from Hermes.
[01:58:49.730 --> 01:58:51.330]  All the legends came from Hermes.
[01:58:51.330 --> 01:58:53.330]  I'm not supporting Hermes, but there's something...
[01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:54.030]  No, I know.
[01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.830]  There's something to it.
[01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:56.330]  There's gotta be a correlation to it.
[01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:58.330]  Exactly
[01:58:58.510 --> 01:59:05.830]  You know, but yeah, thanks of the plant right on some level it's the strength of the plants will to survive
[01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:11.330]  Yeah, yeah, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if it wasn't but but the problem
[01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:16.170]  It's all depending on like what the you know, how you know the stress level that's when
[01:59:16.730 --> 01:59:22.570]  Word becomes an issue and for some of us, you know, I'm pretty high. I'm pretty hard on on
[01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:25.570]  Selecting against Hermes
[01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:27.930]  Yeah
[01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:30.810]  Everybody tries to
[01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:35.050]  But what do you do when they come up in a project that you've been working on for five or six years?
[01:59:35.610 --> 01:59:37.610]  I know
[01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.810]  Everything we're built on is
[01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:48.250]  A sour a fucking cookie. I mean fuck I mean, it's you know, it's in there anyway, you know
[01:59:48.250 --> 01:59:52.490]  So it's like it's it's hard not to I was look that's why I looked into that that
[01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:54.890]  Khalid ties ain
[01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:58.410]  reunion Island thing because it had documented like
[01:59:59.010 --> 02:00:02.850]  extreme low hermaphroditism like, you know as this
[02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:08.290]  cultivated land race for generational time and I was like never would explain
[02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:12.850]  I was like if you started with something like that and like move forward, you know what I mean?
[02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:17.490]  That's that's where I was going. But you know, that's a project that died out, but it's funny
[02:00:17.490 --> 02:00:21.770]  Doesn't matter what you're really breeding with because in the end you just you got to do selection
[02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:28.130]  Yeah, it's all about selection. Yeah all about selection and everybody, you know, what's cool is every breeder
[02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:31.290]  Selects a differently through their own eyes, right?
[02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:37.330]  So that's why we got the varieties that we have and some some will have to be good selections. Some won't be so good
[02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:40.930]  But that's oh, that's just it works
[02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:46.450]  So just quickly before I lose them there's a comment
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:52.530]  Picking smaller males for breeding the set of big strong ones and then a question
[02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:58.250]  Which is reversing a male to get actual resin production from flower. I
[02:01:00.570 --> 02:01:02.570]  Talked to some cool a little bit about
[02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:05.010]  what
[02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:10.770]  He how he picked his males, but he didn't say anything about the smaller ones. He's he told me way back
[02:01:10.770 --> 02:01:17.210]  He said that he didn't like the first ones that flower it showed flower and he didn't like the ones that that flowered the longest
[02:01:17.210 --> 02:01:19.050]  He always went for the mid
[02:01:19.050 --> 02:01:24.330]  And that's kind of how I I select my males twos right in the mid middle middle of the flower range
[02:01:26.370 --> 02:01:28.370]  But I don't know about this
[02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:32.090]  Always pick those smaller dainty ones, you know, I don't know why but
[02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:35.290]  No, I
[02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:40.810]  Always like the more feminine looking males. I like to match that up, you know
[02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:44.370]  I was blessed to be able to
[02:01:45.010 --> 02:01:50.170]  When I before I even started breeding or dropping seeds on the market and stuff. I was a
[02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:54.690]  Test for those test growing for sub cool for about two and a half years. I
[02:01:55.330 --> 02:01:57.410]  did the quirk old the
[02:01:58.050 --> 02:01:59.930]  cheesequake
[02:01:59.930 --> 02:02:01.730]  God what else?
[02:02:01.730 --> 02:02:04.850]  He had a purple one. I forget the purple one that we drew
[02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:10.050]  And I test group for motor rebel. I test grew for
[02:02:10.810 --> 02:02:13.170]  Cali was who else Kelly connection? I
[02:02:13.930 --> 02:02:15.930]  Think we're yeah
[02:02:19.050 --> 02:02:22.930]  Yeah, there's a few there's a few guys that I just grew for way back in the year
[02:02:22.930 --> 02:02:26.050]  But you know, it was it was kind of cool just to kind of see what you know how
[02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:31.730]  To you know do the feedback that they had a list of things that they're looking for and gonna get you in that
[02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:36.450]  Mind of the you know the breeder. So say see what they're looking for and and
[02:02:37.130 --> 02:02:41.930]  How they select that was years ago, I mean I remember when we did the test girls we had a list
[02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:45.370]  I mean, there's certain traits like how long was the veg?
[02:02:46.450 --> 02:02:52.210]  Were they dominant and indica or sativa or hybrid? You know what? I mean? There was like a checklist that we had to answer
[02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:54.730]  these questionnaires that
[02:02:55.050 --> 02:02:57.250]  That the readers would want to know
[02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:02.450]  Some cool wasn't like that. But the other guys were like motor rebel who gave us a little thing and
[02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:07.450]  But those are good, you know what those guys are still those I still keep in contact with a lot of those guys
[02:03:07.450 --> 02:03:12.370]  as a matter of fact, I kept in contact with sub cool until about a year before he passed and then
[02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:20.170]  A motor rebel I just talked I just met the kind of cross paths with him a few years ago about two years ago and then
[02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:23.770]  Swerve
[02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:26.290]  We bump each we bump into each other every now and then but
[02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:31.250]  Man, I wish I could connect with them a lot more. I don't everybody's so busy nowadays, you know
[02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:36.690]  They're just everybody's doing their own thing and I can I totally relate, you know, everybody's on their own little path
[02:03:37.210 --> 02:03:39.210]  But but it's kind of cool
[02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:44.370]  That's what the cups in Seattle was really cool about because it was like where we could meet with everybody
[02:03:44.370 --> 02:03:49.250]  Yeah, and we don't have those things anymore because of the legalization
[02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:51.890]  When they made it legal in our state
[02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:53.890]  When they made it legal in our state
[02:03:54.250 --> 02:04:01.410]  They they took away the the fun stuff like the hemp fest and the cups and all that shit that we used to party
[02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:04.930]  We can't smoke in public anymore
[02:04:12.810 --> 02:04:17.650]  They were more relaxed when about a smoking public when it was illegal
[02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:20.930]  Then when it's legal now, they don't want us to smoke in public
[02:04:29.410 --> 02:04:35.890]  It should about seven years ago or ten years ago at hemp fest you can be standing right next to a cop smoking a joint
[02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:46.290]  So that was that another question about the mail the reverse he wanted to
[02:04:47.090 --> 02:04:50.930]  He wanted to know if the harvest resin from it or to see the resin from it
[02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:54.690]  you you think you gather from that that that question it was
[02:04:56.690 --> 02:05:01.450]  We can ask we can ask for clarification that was
[02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:05.890]  Have you done a male reversal
[02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:07.770]  now
[02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:11.290]  No, no, I did a little bit of female reversal, but I never
[02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:18.010]  Attempted a male reversal and not not on purpose. I've had him reverse on me like outdoors where I was like, oh fuck
[02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:20.010]  Look at that
[02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:22.250]  Yeah
[02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:31.610]  Selected a stack of males last year
[02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:34.330]  revenge them
[02:05:34.330 --> 02:05:36.450]  Some of them have gone to shit to be honest
[02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:39.330]  And I just kind of cleaned the whole situation up and trying to you know
[02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:42.930]  I think I got about knocked everything down to about 12, you know
[02:05:44.490 --> 02:05:46.490]  From a couple different lines and I
[02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:53.090]  Think that probably that's that honestly the best way for me to go forward with it is to maybe do reversals on them rather than
[02:05:53.530 --> 02:05:55.690]  It's almost seems like it's a it's the short
[02:05:55.690 --> 02:05:59.370]  it's a shorter game to find out what they're gonna be like then then having to
[02:05:59.810 --> 02:06:03.890]  Dump dump them and then test the progeny in some way
[02:06:05.490 --> 02:06:07.490]  Again
[02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:11.850]  It seems like almost a faster route to find out what they what they're gonna put then then
[02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:18.730]  Putting them on something else and testing the progeny to just do a reversal, you know with them and with the males with the males
[02:06:18.730 --> 02:06:20.250]  Yeah
[02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:22.250]  Okay
[02:06:24.130 --> 02:06:26.410]  It's kind of a question statement, you know
[02:06:26.410 --> 02:06:32.610]  I think I think you're still like it doesn't really matter like what they can do because like they still might not pass any of that
[02:06:32.610 --> 02:06:34.610]  You know what? I mean?
[02:06:34.610 --> 02:06:39.770]  Yeah, not only that if you think about you're making an s1 basically, right
[02:06:40.690 --> 02:06:42.850]  Right reversing it into an s1
[02:06:42.850 --> 02:06:46.330]  So the progeny you expect to be like the parent like that
[02:06:46.330 --> 02:06:53.290]  But it's not gonna be because when you make the s1 you're crossing the parents of that plant back into itself
[02:06:54.330 --> 02:06:56.690]  So you're not crossing that plant back into itself
[02:06:56.690 --> 02:07:01.410]  You're crossing the parents back into itself and those parents have recessives that made that one
[02:07:01.530 --> 02:07:04.850]  So you those are gonna start popping up so you're never gonna have a
[02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:08.810]  homozygous crop by doing this
[02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:14.130]  And that's the
[02:07:15.690 --> 02:07:17.690]  Right, I
[02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:21.890]  Think no matter no matter what you're gonna have to still grow fucking, you know
[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:26.090]  a bunch of the seeds to figure out what you know, like I'd like I
[02:07:26.530 --> 02:07:29.370]  Recently selected that my my Pam at three
[02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:32.690]  To make the f4 Pam generation
[02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:35.570]  last season and
[02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:44.090]  Everything in the f4 generation had the Turk profile that I fucking hate that I select against in Pamela. So
[02:07:45.450 --> 02:07:47.810]  Somebody likes it, but I don't like that Turk profile
[02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:48.970]  It's not the one that I want
[02:07:48.970 --> 02:07:56.090]  But it's it's that male carry that that thing and he didn't smell like that when I selected him and I had no idea
[02:07:56.210 --> 02:08:01.650]  That that's what he was gonna really contribute but across the board even in other plants I
[02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:05.890]  picked up that goddamn turf profile, so I
[02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:10.130]  Scrapped that whole at four because I don't want I don't want that in the thing
[02:08:10.130 --> 02:08:13.490]  So I got to remake it so I got I got to look back in the f3
[02:08:14.050 --> 02:08:17.250]  Pull out a new male and go go go back
[02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:21.330]  but yeah, I didn't know that that he would he would do that and
[02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:25.250]  He fucking did that shit so what's your
[02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:35.210]  What's your seed company's name bro family tree seeds, okay, okay
[02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:46.010]  Okay, yes, I never met you before so it's like and this dude talks like he's breathing. Yeah, he's a breeder
[02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:51.930]  He's not just all about dogs
[02:09:02.130 --> 02:09:04.130]  Tyler you've let us down
[02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:11.850]  He's gonna tell some story from high school where he chugged a bunch of beer
[02:09:13.650 --> 02:09:15.650]  One thing led to another
[02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:18.250]  dog semen involved
[02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:25.330]  Tyler you breed dogs
[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:33.890]  So I'm a I'm a fruit tree specialist, I'm an arborist I built my life doing fruit trees and cannabis
[02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:40.130]  And yeah, so we've done avocado and mango. I have I have some yuzu outside
[02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:42.370]  Are you?
[02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:46.610]  Can you drop some knowledge on the citrus yuzu
[02:09:47.730 --> 02:09:49.730]  family
[02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:54.270]  Like those yuzus and it's basically a sour orange, you know
[02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:57.250]  You can use it for all kinds of things
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:10:02.010]  It's kind of I don't know you you you have you have you have an Asian wife
[02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:08.730]  So you use a lot of Asian food probably right right we do and that's that's a staple thing that we had it tonight
[02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:16.510]  Yeah, the cap your lime and the yuzu orange those are staples for different types of you know, Asian culinary dishes
[02:10:16.890 --> 02:10:24.290]  it's not something you pull off the tree and just like eat or you know, but it is yuzu finicky in the world of
[02:10:25.570 --> 02:10:28.250]  Lemon and no, it's not actually
[02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:33.170]  It's really kind of a nasty plant. It's really heavily thorned
[02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:37.850]  Yeah, yeah. No it is my but mine is mine is very finicky
[02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:45.890]  It's well, it's finicky because of the care practices and you have I would be willing to bet my you know
[02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:47.890]  I'd be willing to bet parts of my body
[02:10:48.010 --> 02:10:53.810]  That the way that it's planted or if it's not planted or any case like you have, you know
[02:10:54.330 --> 02:10:56.330]  different things going on and
[02:10:57.850 --> 02:11:04.290]  Like people read like citrus don't want water and that's all bullshit and then people don't water them enough
[02:11:04.290 --> 02:11:10.610]  People don't want to mulch them properly and then like there's all these other things but citrus in general
[02:11:11.490 --> 02:11:15.130]  At a young age will take a little while to get going
[02:11:15.130 --> 02:11:15.690]  You know what?
[02:11:15.690 --> 02:11:18.810]  I mean like you can plant if you buy the smallest fucking citrus little
[02:11:18.810 --> 02:11:19.210]  Yeah
[02:11:19.210 --> 02:11:24.770]  I'm citrus you put it in your yard and you're even in a place like LA or San Diego or you got good weather
[02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:27.650]  It still could take that thing, you know
[02:11:27.930 --> 02:11:32.570]  Three years two to three years to really start doing something where you notice
[02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:35.210]  Is doing proper work
[02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:40.010]  of
[02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:07.670]  rants and stuff about that. But in most times that that soil is clean under
[02:12:07.670 --> 02:12:11.610]  there. You got rocks or decorative things going on. Those soil temperatures are
[02:12:11.610 --> 02:12:16.310]  jumping around and as soon as it hits 1130 that plant stops drinking water and
[02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:21.650]  it's not eating any food and it gets yellow and it gets picked on. And if it
[02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:26.330]  is growing well, we're slowly, because they do grow slowly at first, until they can get
[02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:32.210]  up their their feet under them, they'll get picked on by the leaf miners. So in
[02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:39.610]  June, like early, like late May, you know I'll remind you probably, you know, or you
[02:12:39.610 --> 02:12:43.370]  remind me, but we'll talk about, we'll get you some leaf miner traps. And basically
[02:12:43.370 --> 02:12:50.050]  it's a little pheromone, little sticky box that will attract the the male leaf
[02:12:50.050 --> 02:12:54.650]  miner to go in the box instead of mate with the females and decimate your tree.
[02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:57.890]  So all your tree, just all your new growth just gets fucking decimated. Looks
[02:12:57.890 --> 02:13:01.250]  like shit. And then you or your gardener goes out there and cuts it off because
[02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:04.530]  it looks like shit. And your tree never grows because every year your new growth
[02:13:04.530 --> 02:13:08.690]  gets beat up by the goddamn leaf miner and the other stuff. Because in San Diego
[02:13:08.690 --> 02:13:11.890]  we don't have winter to kill a lot of stuff and all the other bugs pick on you
[02:13:11.890 --> 02:13:15.530]  when the leaf miner aren't here. And in the peak of the summer the leaf miner are
[02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:21.530]  wreaking havoc on all your new growth. So young trees feel it worse. So yuzu's,
[02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:25.330]  they're no more finicky than the other, but you just need to do a couple things
[02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:32.610]  when they're young. More foliar feeding. Get some fish, get some fish
[02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:37.770]  hydrosylate or some fish emulsion. Get some humic acid or fulvic acid. Push it
[02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:42.170]  in there with some fulvic acid. You know that's that's a cool trick that I use a lot.
[02:13:42.170 --> 02:13:48.330]  Throw some fish in some fulvic acid. I'm looking at you Pacific bro. Make sure the ground is mulched.
[02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:54.610]  Make sure you're doing that, you know, you're doing things like that. But yuzu's
[02:13:54.610 --> 02:13:58.330]  are cool. They're the best thing you can do for is get the leaf miner traps in
[02:13:58.330 --> 02:14:03.210]  the summer. You put one out in June and put another one out in late August and
[02:14:03.210 --> 02:14:09.370]  that'll knock down 50% of your damage and your problem. And then you can kind
[02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:13.650]  of work with that. And if you can get, you know, 50% pressure off of a young
[02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:17.330]  tree then that thing will grow quicker. You feed it good. You force
[02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:22.850]  feed it a little bit. And by year four or year five you should be good to go.
[02:14:22.850 --> 02:14:27.530]  But you don't want to prune it a lot if you want it to produce. So you want to
[02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:34.690]  just protect it and love it. Get it nice and you know healthy before you
[02:14:34.690 --> 02:14:41.010]  start doing anything to her. But yuzu's are cool. I don't have a yuzu. I got a
[02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:47.050]  kaffir lime which is, you know, you use the leaves and you know all kinds of
[02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:50.530]  different Thai cooking and stuff. But I used to bring the leaves and I used to just
[02:14:50.530 --> 02:14:53.650]  crinkle them up in my pocket at work when I used to work the nursery or
[02:14:53.650 --> 02:14:56.970]  whatever. And we'd jam them in my shirt or rub them on my thing so I didn't smell like
[02:14:56.970 --> 02:15:00.410]  dank all the time. You know what I mean? Stuff like that. It would be my perfume.
[02:15:00.410 --> 02:15:03.970]  It was great. You could use it for everything. Yuzu's do great too. Just rub those on
[02:15:03.970 --> 02:15:10.770]  your sleeve. Go talk to anybody dude. Fresh and refreshed. You know.
[02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:14.650]  We got lots of seeds in there too. You getting any of them off of there? You
[02:15:14.650 --> 02:15:22.170]  tried them yet? On the seed front? No, the yuzu. Have you pulled any fruit off of that tree yet?
[02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:28.730]  Yeah but this is why I'm drilling you with my questions because my
[02:15:28.730 --> 02:15:35.970]  fruit is not very satisfying. Yeah. It's underwhelming relative to what I
[02:15:35.970 --> 02:15:43.250]  know Yuzu's potential is. You send me some pictures. We'll look at it. I'll give you some stuff.
[02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:49.210]  I definitely will. If it's a real youngster, I always tell people this.
[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:53.450]  Fruit tastings and stuff. They do all these weird fruit tastings like they do
[02:15:53.450 --> 02:15:57.050]  with anything else. They taste the new apples and the blueberries and all the
[02:15:57.050 --> 02:16:01.090]  weird hot fruits. All the geeks get together and rate fruit tastings and
[02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:07.450]  stuff which is killer. You always notice that the trees that they enter
[02:16:07.450 --> 02:16:14.010]  are always like the old fucking trees. They're always like the 30, 40, 50, 60, 70
[02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:18.890]  year old fucking trees that are putting out the best quality, best tasting fruit.
[02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:22.970]  And those younger trees are just like young kids. You know, you can't expect
[02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:28.090]  them to be you know doing good work or putting in the time even though they're
[02:16:28.090 --> 02:16:31.650]  like you know doing it takes them a little while to build the relationships
[02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:38.170]  and to get the practice and work out the kinks and really figure out how to craft
[02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:41.650]  this piece of fruit that's fucking super tasty. You know what I mean with all the
[02:16:41.650 --> 02:16:44.970]  elements around it. You know what I mean? It's got to build all those things. So all
[02:16:44.970 --> 02:16:49.210]  those old you know the older trees are always the ones that have the best
[02:16:49.210 --> 02:16:52.690]  fucking tasting fruit and the best things. It's had the most practice, has the
[02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:56.970]  most relationships. It's been around the longest. It's really plugged in and
[02:16:57.130 --> 02:17:01.370]  that's when the money starts happening. So I always say don't judge a tree by
[02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:05.850]  its fruit until after at least year six or seven you can start really start
[02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:10.050]  thinking about you know hey is this not what it's supposed to taste like. It will
[02:17:10.050 --> 02:17:15.650]  actually fucking change quite a bit. You'd be surprised in certain types of
[02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:23.530]  plants like blueberries and you know things like that. So I should not
[02:17:23.530 --> 02:17:31.530]  feel bad that in year three my yuzu. No. That's all I really wanted to know.
[02:17:31.530 --> 02:17:37.290]  No but yeah you got to do some stuff. I mean it could be it could be good but
[02:17:37.290 --> 02:17:43.530]  you got you know it's it's still it's still a youngster and it lives in LA so
[02:17:43.530 --> 02:17:50.490]  it needs you know. It doesn't have a lot to complain about. Yeah our water is terrible dude.
[02:17:50.490 --> 02:17:55.410]  Like that's the one thing that sometimes plants and citrus and things
[02:17:55.410 --> 02:18:00.450]  around you have a hard time with is like we're like the last time I looked a few
[02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:04.610]  years ago we were ninth on the worst water in the country like rating you
[02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:07.890]  know. Like our chance Southern California we have like the ninth worst water in
[02:18:07.890 --> 02:18:12.210]  the country like you know testing wise or something. I don't know how close or
[02:18:12.210 --> 02:18:18.050]  different it is now. We can't be much better. Sometimes what's in that water
[02:18:18.050 --> 02:18:23.250]  will react negatively you know and there's all kinds of fucking big word
[02:18:23.250 --> 02:18:28.970]  fucking things chloramines and fucking these other things that have ionic bonds
[02:18:28.970 --> 02:18:32.890]  that will block that fucking that exchange that that nutrient exchange
[02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:35.770]  that needs to happen especially with young trees that are locked out and
[02:18:35.770 --> 02:18:42.130]  crappy soil and stuff like that. So having really poor water makes it harder
[02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:46.530]  for some trees that are having a shitty time to kind of pull out of out of
[02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:50.490]  fucking dodge. So if you got really bad water your trees not growing or it seems
[02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:53.690]  like it's yellow and just not putting picking up what it needs to do and you
[02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:58.530]  swear to God you're doing everything that you can you know that it's right to
[02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:03.090]  do the thing and still not working then you got to look at your water. And I
[02:19:03.090 --> 02:19:07.810]  always do I always start doing foliar feedings with like bottled water, filtered
[02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:13.730]  water, clean water, good water that I know is good and not my water mixed with the
[02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:18.610]  folic acid and like some fish or some kelp or some sort of you know fertilizer
[02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:23.450]  with minerals and nutrients in there that can push into that into that you
[02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:26.610]  know force feed you know that plant a little bit you know kind of like if
[02:19:26.610 --> 02:19:31.250]  you're dehydrated and you go to the hospital because you know you can't take
[02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:35.370]  in fluid fast enough so they give you an IV straight to the straight to the vein.
[02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:39.730]  Foliar feeding and stuff the right way you can kind of do that same thing with
[02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:42.930]  a young tree or a sick tree or tree that needs a little shot of something
[02:19:42.930 --> 02:19:47.890]  and sometimes doing that with clean water will fucking give that tree a
[02:19:47.890 --> 02:19:51.490]  fucking IV or that that main line or that good good water that's not all
[02:19:51.490 --> 02:19:55.570]  blocked out it's not dealing with that block out in the root system and all of
[02:19:55.570 --> 02:19:58.650]  a sudden it gets a full belly and a fucking recharge like fuck this
[02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:01.650]  situation I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do and all of a sudden that wakes the tree
[02:20:01.650 --> 02:20:05.170]  up and the thing just starts fucking taking off and just dealing with it it's
[02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:10.850]  fucking crazy but I've seen that happen with some citrus like a number of times
[02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:15.690]  and it's like well I guess that's what we should have done you know all right
[02:20:15.690 --> 02:20:22.210]  so Justin in summary you're a fan of IVs yourself I like IVs and I like good
[02:20:22.210 --> 02:20:32.370]  water do you and the wife inject each other with just nutrient like well you
[02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:48.650]  know no wonder you have so much energy all the time yeah I was gonna say why
[02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:54.650]  why don't we all tap because it's almost I don't remember what time we started
[02:20:54.650 --> 02:21:02.250]  but I guess it was a while ago yeah I got shit to do in the morning all right well
[02:21:02.250 --> 02:21:11.370]  does anybody disagree with the idea of ending? No, but thanks for inviting me in
[02:21:11.370 --> 02:21:17.850]  and yes thank you here's a lemon hoco like just to hear more about you you
[02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:21.050]  know and what's going on you know I want to get to know you more man on a
[02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:25.850]  personal level dude right on man we'll hook up I'm you gonna be by Kaya's
[02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:32.410]  tomorrow? No I'm up in Bellingham man okay yeah so but where you at are you
[02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:38.010]  down on that down that near there? Graham. Yeah I'll be down around sometime
[02:21:38.010 --> 02:21:46.650]  but you know I'd love to link up. Okay cool. Bellingham, that's like four hours away. I know.
[02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:54.810]  All right Tyler it's good Tyler we'll talk SoCal stuff. We'll swap stories of
[02:21:54.810 --> 02:22:01.170]  plants that are looking exceptional in February. All right thank you everyone
[02:22:01.170 --> 02:22:05.810]  have a good night. Later. Much love.
