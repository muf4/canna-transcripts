[00:01.850 --> 00:08.170]  Good morning everyone it is 11 a.m. on the west coast and that must mean
[00:08.170 --> 00:18.410]  another episode of the James Loud show with the one and only Mr. James Loud!
[00:18.410 --> 00:23.650]  Hey guys how's it going thanks for tuning in this week we have a really special show.
[00:23.650 --> 00:28.250]  I wanted to first start off telling you guys a little bit about my trip to
[00:28.250 --> 00:34.450]  Arizona I got to see some amazing flower you know I had a great trip I went to
[00:34.450 --> 00:40.290]  Tucson I got a little tour of Earth Healing in their facility if you have a
[00:40.290 --> 00:43.330]  chance to go check out their dispensary go check them out they're doing some
[00:43.330 --> 00:48.530]  amazing stuff with extracts their sugar is some of the best I've seen yeah so
[00:48.530 --> 00:56.530]  check them out and today our guests on episode 24 are Dr. Joseph Ramahi PhD
[00:57.250 --> 01:02.210]  and we have Justin from Apical Biotech these guys work together and we got a
[01:02.210 --> 01:06.610]  lot to talk about today about plant health so Joseph you want to tell us a
[01:06.610 --> 01:10.730]  little bit about hoplate and viroid I believe that is the topic of the day
[01:10.730 --> 01:19.170]  yeah so morning hi everyone yeah today we're gonna talk about it's known on the
[01:19.170 --> 01:24.730]  west coast for a very long time as dudding and in kind of like the THC
[01:24.730 --> 01:28.570]  cannabis space it's been this disease that's been spreading around for
[01:28.570 --> 01:33.730]  probably the better part of the last decade and it's called hop latent
[01:33.730 --> 01:40.850]  viroid and this is a plant specific pathogen it's a pathogenic RNA that's
[01:40.850 --> 01:45.370]  kind of like a virus we'll talk about that later and really we're here to talk
[01:45.370 --> 01:50.970]  about yields and kind of like dudding people all over the west coast for you
[01:50.970 --> 01:55.970]  know going back 10 years or more we're like they were doing flower runs and
[01:55.970 --> 02:02.130]  then plants would randomly just produce flower that was more or less useless
[02:02.130 --> 02:06.850]  there were no trichomes it didn't smell right there were often weird structural
[02:06.850 --> 02:15.090]  problems associated as well and then this all kind of came to a head in like
[02:15.090 --> 02:23.810]  the late 20 teens and in 2019 hop latent viroid was publicly identified in the
[02:23.810 --> 02:29.330]  cannabis space in California and this plant or in this plant disease has been
[02:29.330 --> 02:32.930]  you know it's been devastating right causing millions of dollars of loss in
[02:32.930 --> 02:37.730]  the cannabis space and it's worldwide spread we know it's in Europe we know
[02:37.730 --> 02:43.850]  it's in Canada I have my DMS on Instagram are really interesting from
[02:43.850 --> 02:54.370]  people from Maine Michigan Pennsylvania New York Oklahoma right so many people
[02:54.370 --> 02:58.250]  are struggling with these kinds of issues that the West Coast was dealing
[02:58.250 --> 03:02.090]  with I don't know five five more years ago and it's these kinds of like
[03:02.090 --> 03:06.410]  there's this kind of spreading disease or something's going on with my yields
[03:06.410 --> 03:11.010]  like and it's different kinds of yields and crop losses that people are
[03:11.010 --> 03:15.530]  suffering from the two big ones with hop late and thyroid are the obvious
[03:15.530 --> 03:20.210]  dudding lack of like flower production that hurts your pocket right because
[03:20.210 --> 03:24.330]  you're like okay this room is supposed to produce this much weight and it
[03:24.330 --> 03:30.210]  didn't and the other one is rooting and clone production in your own vegetative
[03:30.210 --> 03:35.770]  crop or if you are a vegetative nursery hop late and thyroid really impacts
[03:35.770 --> 03:40.530]  rooting success rate and if you're a nursery that makes your clones at 95%
[03:40.530 --> 03:45.690]  rooting success and everyone's happy when that goes to 30% everyone's worried
[03:45.690 --> 03:51.170]  also hop late and thyroid input into tissue culture systems has been really
[03:51.170 --> 03:55.130]  really devastating to people because it makes the whole tissue culture program
[03:55.130 --> 04:00.250]  inconsistent so people were doing tissue culture propagation of hop late and
[04:00.250 --> 04:06.210]  thyroid infected lines and strains and they're like oh the rooting is all over
[04:06.210 --> 04:10.130]  the place the multiplication is all over the place the intake is all over the
[04:10.210 --> 04:16.290]  place and it's because they were were the plants infected and oh also one last
[04:16.290 --> 04:19.370]  thing before you know I just realized I've been ranting for a few minutes now
[04:19.370 --> 04:24.930]  is the asymptomatic nature of hop late and thyroid is really one of the most
[04:24.930 --> 04:30.850]  troubling part of the disease a large number of plants are asymptomatically
[04:30.850 --> 04:37.050]  infected and they spread the disease and then you have a room full of infected
[04:37.050 --> 04:41.930]  plants and then some secondary stress happens like heat stress nutrient stress
[04:41.930 --> 04:48.210]  light stress whatever and then you lose sometimes 10 to 20 percent of your crop
[04:48.210 --> 04:54.250]  or more and that's really been economically impactful as people try to
[04:54.250 --> 05:01.210]  scale hard in new markets right so there's there's a another thing that I
[05:01.210 --> 05:05.410]  want to touch on with that so really good growers it's easier to identify but
[05:05.450 --> 05:10.050]  people that have tons of issues with their problem with nutrition and with
[05:10.050 --> 05:16.650]  environment you know it's it's harder to identify correct um yes I mean it takes
[05:16.650 --> 05:23.290]  an eye to know what a plant is supposed to look like Justin like we and you have
[05:23.290 --> 05:26.610]  had this discussion at length right about you know you have like a
[05:26.610 --> 05:30.890]  population of any plants and you walk them every day and then you know how are
[05:30.890 --> 05:34.810]  things supposed to look at different stages right can you yeah do you know
[05:34.810 --> 05:48.230]  yeah yeah I mean different stages I mean would you would you say that it
[05:48.230 --> 05:52.750]  expresses differently at different stages oh and so I'm thinking about I'm
[05:52.750 --> 05:59.990]  trying to like catalog through my head right now and say mostly by the grower
[05:59.990 --> 06:06.430]  is input or nurseries input and the health of the plants it it's like I see
[06:06.430 --> 06:13.030]  it really it acts the same but it it responds the plants respond differently
[06:13.030 --> 06:19.910]  different stages does that make sense yeah definitely um and also let's also
[06:19.910 --> 06:25.630]  let's remind everyone you don't see invisible molecular diseases you have to
[06:25.630 --> 06:31.550]  do tests to actually detect their presence or absence but these symptoms
[06:31.550 --> 06:35.670]  and the symptomatic plants and the different ways that the infected plants
[06:35.670 --> 06:40.470]  do or don't display the disease that's what we're talking about like the
[06:40.470 --> 06:45.990]  structural things oh this leaf variegation isn't normal
[06:45.990 --> 06:51.830]  yeah it's just you have to have that kind of like data set in your experience
[06:51.830 --> 06:55.990]  of oh these are what all these good plants should look like this is what
[06:55.990 --> 07:03.990]  this plant should look like at this week in veg or this week in flower and yeah
[07:03.990 --> 07:08.910]  and a lot of people that was a struggle in a lot of plants tissue culture I was
[07:08.910 --> 07:12.630]  talking to an orchid producer that got that's been doing orchid tissue culture
[07:12.630 --> 07:16.670]  since 1981 and he's like a lot of people tried to open orchid tissue culture labs
[07:16.830 --> 07:22.270]  but they failed because they didn't know what the in vitro plants were supposed
[07:22.270 --> 07:27.270]  to look like and I really struggled with that until I went back to my initial
[07:27.270 --> 07:32.750]  experiences with cannabis to in tissue culture in 2016 and there was a lot of
[07:32.750 --> 07:36.830]  weird stuff that you see and you're like what is tolerable or no quote-unquote
[07:36.830 --> 07:42.790]  normal at any individual stage of tissue culture that that's like a microcosm of
[07:42.790 --> 07:48.310]  any grow right you're like oh I just did I just up potted my transplants they
[07:48.310 --> 07:55.670]  should be looking like this a few days in right yeah so let's let's talk about
[07:55.670 --> 08:01.870]  seeds we got questions on the chat about seeds does it pass through seeds I mean
[08:01.870 --> 08:06.830]  there's a lot of speculation going on and there I hear yes I hear no what's
[08:06.830 --> 08:12.710]  your take on that Joe so I've had correspondence and back and forth with
[08:12.710 --> 08:18.670]  information and testing information from a couple of groups with interesting kind
[08:18.670 --> 08:25.390]  of like reports and Oli Bechtas at Purple City Genetics in Oakland
[08:25.390 --> 08:31.030]  California he's doing active research on hoplite and byroid he's published he was
[08:31.030 --> 08:35.870]  one of the original authors on the work that publicized this disease and in
[08:35.870 --> 08:42.990]  cannabis so Ali he's been sowing seed from positive tested seed donor moms and
[08:42.990 --> 08:50.390]  he's been like testing 30 seed here you know small initial trials and everything
[08:50.390 --> 08:53.630]  is cut we're not ever all yeah everything is coming up negative on
[08:53.630 --> 08:58.270]  these very small initial trials so you're like okay interesting so you're
[08:58.270 --> 09:03.150]  like okay was it a pollen donor or like was it mom dad who's infected was it
[09:03.150 --> 09:06.630]  matter do you not test enough seed that's interesting like we'll move
[09:06.630 --> 09:12.270]  forward right Dark Heart and Jeremy Warren
[09:12.430 --> 09:18.590]  they put out on either their white paper or somewhere on their website that it
[09:18.590 --> 09:23.310]  was seed transmissible at a small population they sewed a bunch of seed
[09:23.310 --> 09:29.710]  and tested it and they said they caught some hoplite and byroid but I mean I
[09:29.710 --> 09:32.550]  guess for both of them it's like I haven't physically seen the data this is
[09:32.550 --> 09:35.830]  just stuff that I've read on people's websites or directly spoken with the
[09:35.830 --> 09:40.950]  people that did the work so and then other people on Instagram are like oh I
[09:40.950 --> 09:44.750]  don't think it's seed transmittable because I grow from seed only and I
[09:44.750 --> 09:49.670]  don't have problems and I'm like okay so as far as my trials of like cracking
[09:49.670 --> 09:53.030]  seed and checking it they've been really really small so my trials are almost
[09:53.030 --> 09:58.510]  like non not even that informative my main testing has always been dealing
[09:58.510 --> 10:02.870]  with known infected plants and making them into testing negative in all in
[10:02.870 --> 10:07.870]  vitro as opposed to I need like that's one of my biggest projects in 2021 is
[10:07.870 --> 10:15.190]  doing kind of seed transmission studies right so how prevalent is it out there
[10:15.190 --> 10:22.070]  how how infected you know as a whole you think it's on every continent that we're
[10:22.070 --> 10:27.310]  growing cannabis now you know and you have any guess as to what percentage I
[10:27.310 --> 10:31.710]  guess it's hard because we don't test everything no what do you think Justin
[10:31.710 --> 10:38.190]  well I was gonna actually say with the seed aspect of it I have definitely
[10:38.190 --> 10:46.230]  seen observationally I can't prove chain of custody but doing massive pheno hunts
[10:46.230 --> 10:50.990]  at some of these facilities we definitely have had positive plants and
[10:50.990 --> 10:57.470]  you know I didn't test the moms the seeds came from different breeders but
[10:57.470 --> 11:04.510]  how did it get in there in a closed-off facility so I would say I believe it
[11:04.510 --> 11:10.830]  passes through seed certainly I've also had other people that I were the wheat
[11:10.830 --> 11:15.470]  Joe and I work with pop positive and they were shocked like all of this is
[11:15.470 --> 11:20.910]  from seed houses possible I know I agree with Justin and I dealt with those same
[11:20.910 --> 11:24.990]  people you're like but shenanigans always happen right so you're like how
[11:24.990 --> 11:29.150]  you know cross and reinfection does happen right so if someone had a pot a
[11:29.150 --> 11:32.990]  seed born population you're like well maybe an employee blah blah blah and
[11:32.990 --> 11:37.150]  you're like it's that's not impossible but like Justin said these kinds of
[11:37.150 --> 11:41.790]  studies where you have the testing report of the seed mom or dad you know
[11:41.790 --> 11:45.630]  or dad and then the progeny not many people are doing this kind of like
[11:45.790 --> 11:51.870]  sequential generation testing so so Mojave Richmond jumped in and he said I
[11:51.870 --> 11:55.910]  know a group overseas that brought in seeds with phytosanitary certified seeds
[11:55.910 --> 12:02.310]  and they were infected oh damn thanks Mojave yeah good stuff you know that's
[12:02.310 --> 12:07.910]  you know it's it's funny phytosanitary certification at that level you would
[12:07.910 --> 12:11.470]  you would hope that they caught stuff like that and they were testing but that
[12:11.470 --> 12:16.470]  doesn't necessarily mean that they were so I again like I've worked with groups
[12:16.470 --> 12:19.990]  that have been like all good clean and they're like we're closed off we don't
[12:19.990 --> 12:22.830]  take any genetics for anyone we sterilize our tools when we start from
[12:22.830 --> 12:27.590]  seed and I'm like sweet and then most people that do have these problems
[12:27.590 --> 12:34.950]  they've been moving around cuts a lot so and hi Mojave yeah well we got to get
[12:34.950 --> 12:39.190]  Mojave back on here one of these days you know I think him and I on the future
[12:39.190 --> 12:43.270]  cannabis project we brought up hoplite and with sour diesel as being you know
[12:43.270 --> 12:47.470]  one of the first varieties that both of us had recognized that potentially had
[12:47.470 --> 12:53.550]  hoplite and you know a mid-2000s I want to do like a tasting party with me you
[12:53.550 --> 12:59.630]  and Mojave and with some sage and some sour diesel yeah yeah yeah and some
[12:59.630 --> 13:05.950]  sage and sour as well yeah this is amazing yeah and I have that in the lab
[13:05.990 --> 13:10.630]  nice excellent yeah and then I did all those crosses with the sage and sour
[13:10.630 --> 13:17.510]  some awesome stuff so yeah we're gonna be releasing those shortly with Adam so
[13:17.510 --> 13:22.670]  let's go back to hoplite and talk about how you can recognize it I think you
[13:22.670 --> 13:26.870]  said basically I think we got it in a little more detail on past episodes but
[13:26.870 --> 13:31.450]  I really think that's an important part is how does someone identify hoplite and
[13:31.450 --> 13:38.770]  viroid Justin you want to start I mean observationally the first thing that I
[13:38.770 --> 13:43.970]  see is if you really pay attention to the morphology of the plant that's like
[13:43.970 --> 13:51.290]  the first dead giveaway I've seen plants do extreme stretching I've seen other
[13:51.290 --> 13:56.730]  plants respond with extremely tight internode spacing but the overall
[13:56.730 --> 14:04.170]  morphology of the plant is no longer a symphony of growth it's sporadic you
[14:04.170 --> 14:09.970]  start seeing kind of weird looking spiraling leaves kind of a little bit
[14:09.970 --> 14:18.290]  paralleling or the twist at the top that's one like early sign brittle
[14:18.290 --> 14:24.410]  branches so if your branches break off really easy in a nursery low rooting
[14:24.410 --> 14:31.490]  success that's a really dead giveaway I'd say and then slow growth if you
[14:31.490 --> 14:35.450]  look at plants every day you can tell which ones are slow and which ones are
[14:35.450 --> 14:39.130]  grown like they're supposed to so slow growth definitely and that you know
[14:39.130 --> 14:43.530]  that's the term dutting right that we mean how long ago was that coined I
[14:43.530 --> 14:53.170]  can't recall but 2016 probably I think is when probably yeah dutting people
[14:53.170 --> 14:57.050]  started that I know called it that thing the dutting disease yeah I mean I
[14:57.050 --> 14:59.490]  think people were calling it dutting disease back then more than they were
[14:59.490 --> 15:03.050]  calling it hoplite oh we're nobody was calling a hoplite that I know they were
[15:03.050 --> 15:12.210]  calling it dutting or spiky yeah yeah yeah so and then I guess the the obvious
[15:12.210 --> 15:17.330]  way to tell that you're gonna get the real answer is through testing yeah so
[15:17.330 --> 15:23.410]  there's two types of kinds of testing that people do to detect actually there's
[15:23.410 --> 15:28.090]  more than two I'll start we'll start with two of many and it's kind of like
[15:28.090 --> 15:33.930]  you want to detect the presence or absence of like a virus or and this can
[15:33.930 --> 15:38.770]  also be used for like certain bacteria or fungi this is kinds of like molecular
[15:38.770 --> 15:44.370]  diagnostics for the presence or absence of the genetic material of the disease
[15:44.370 --> 15:48.370]  right so that's how that's one of the many ways that we do Koba testing and
[15:48.370 --> 15:52.810]  it's these molecular diagnostics things like PCR polymerase chain reaction and
[15:52.810 --> 15:58.930]  this is a molecular diagnostic assay to basically detect the presence of the
[15:58.930 --> 16:04.330]  hoplite and viroid RNA there's no protein associated with it this disease
[16:04.330 --> 16:10.130]  encodes no genes it's super small it's 256 base pairs in a little tight circle
[16:10.130 --> 16:17.610]  of RNA and it kind of just screws up plant gene function you know just the
[16:17.610 --> 16:21.810]  making of the mRNA to make the protein products that are genes so that's like
[16:21.810 --> 16:25.930]  one way these molecular assays are one thing one of many ways of disease
[16:25.930 --> 16:30.650]  detection the other way are these kinds of antibody based assays which you use
[16:30.650 --> 16:40.250]  to detect the presence or absence of a via of a viral or a bacterial protein
[16:40.250 --> 16:45.370]  right so you're like oh you can do antibody tests to detect the presence of
[16:45.370 --> 16:52.730]  you know aspergillus or pseudomonas or you know tobacco mosaic virus even but
[16:52.730 --> 16:56.890]  if the detections are kind of different and they cost different and the time
[16:57.010 --> 17:01.370]  frames are different so like an antibody based assay you can do at a bench for
[17:01.370 --> 17:06.250]  you know and implement it in your lab for like hundreds of dollars and you can
[17:06.250 --> 17:10.850]  get you know results in 30 minutes you know and you're like okay I did this
[17:10.850 --> 17:17.570]  antibody test on-site it was you know maybe $35 a bit a pop for an assay but
[17:17.570 --> 17:22.330]  you know I bought a kit of 10 online and that's how I did my antibody assays on
[17:22.330 --> 17:26.170]  site you could also outsource these antibody assays to labs for similar cost
[17:26.330 --> 17:30.850]  you know you're gonna spend hundreds of dollars to do a decent number of these
[17:30.850 --> 17:35.530]  tests molecular biology assays are more expensive because you need to literally
[17:35.530 --> 17:41.650]  extract the RNA and send it to a lab and they need to use these PCR machines and
[17:41.650 --> 17:46.370]  those kinds of assays costs dozens of dollars you know some people will charge
[17:46.370 --> 17:54.610]  $100 an assay $50 for an assay $75 for multiple assays so many people when they
[17:54.650 --> 17:59.050]  start doing these kinds of molecular diagnostics the bill adds up to
[17:59.050 --> 18:04.250]  thousands of dollars very quickly so at the end or I don't know we could do it
[18:04.250 --> 18:08.450]  right now we could talk about the kinds of different options for the assays and
[18:08.450 --> 18:12.170]  different price points but we've got a whole different section of this that we
[18:12.170 --> 18:16.890]  could talk about later I'd say honestly Joe you should probably start I would
[18:16.890 --> 18:21.730]  dive into a PCR just a little bit and false positives and how you need to even
[18:21.730 --> 18:28.170]  really be careful which labs you use and you need to question their protocols
[18:28.170 --> 18:32.770]  a little bit to make sure they're not just getting a quick test that can give
[18:32.770 --> 18:38.410]  you false positives or negatives oh totally well I think what to especially
[18:38.410 --> 18:43.290]  with what Justin just said I think a lot of this stuff in our industry in the
[18:43.290 --> 18:49.330]  cannabis space is this world of trust but verify where you need to trust the
[18:49.330 --> 18:52.410]  lab that you're working with you need to trust that you're going to send them
[18:52.410 --> 18:58.530]  material and that we don't have HIPAA you know it's not like I go to you know
[18:58.530 --> 19:02.890]  a hospital and I do tests there and I know that they're not going to you know
[19:02.890 --> 19:06.730]  tell my tell someone what my test results were you know there's none of
[19:06.730 --> 19:10.490]  that really in cannabis so there's all these issues about like intellectual
[19:10.490 --> 19:15.530]  property who knows what about testing so one of the first things that many people
[19:15.530 --> 19:20.330]  are very you know discerning about are what are you doing what exactly are you
[19:20.330 --> 19:25.130]  doing with the material that I'm mailing you and what exactly are you doing with
[19:25.130 --> 19:29.530]  the data that comes out of it because let's not forget or you know we can even
[19:29.530 --> 19:32.210]  talk about that real quickly because it's kind of relevant to hoplite
[19:32.210 --> 19:37.490]  enviroid testing or just mailing cannabis material around is this you
[19:37.490 --> 19:44.090]  know the phylo story right of people banking other people's material I was in
[19:44.090 --> 19:50.210]  this space for a while and one of my guarantees my guarantees that was
[19:50.210 --> 19:56.050]  always tied to me Joe Ramani PhD the operator was hey if you give me stuff I
[19:56.050 --> 19:59.770]  don't talk to anyone about it except for you because you're paying me for a
[19:59.770 --> 20:04.050]  service and all associated materials with that project is destroyed at the
[20:04.050 --> 20:07.970]  end of the project I don't do anything with your DNA I don't do anything with
[20:07.970 --> 20:14.610]  your data aside from my own mass data collection of I've done this many tests
[20:14.610 --> 20:20.210]  and I've tested this many hots and this many negatives but most of the stuff is
[20:20.210 --> 20:25.130]  as anonymized as I can be you know everyone can see on my Instagram that I
[20:25.130 --> 20:29.690]  don't put good or bad things on blast really unless it's me really right I'm
[20:29.690 --> 20:33.770]  like this is my stuff hey look at this sick plant guys it's awful it's all mine
[20:33.770 --> 20:39.370]  right but I'm never in any place been like oh I got some strain from this guy
[20:39.370 --> 20:44.370]  X Y & Z and it's positive for anything because that's you know it's not good
[20:44.370 --> 20:50.290]  for business or ethically right so um yeah so anyways how I got on this
[20:50.290 --> 20:54.690]  tangent was this whole idea of like testing and working with people and
[20:54.690 --> 20:58.250]  sending Justin you know you asked me that question about who you were because
[20:58.250 --> 21:05.010]  this all came from who you work with right test would verify yeah you need to
[21:05.010 --> 21:07.570]  so you need to be careful about that whole process right how do they handle
[21:07.570 --> 21:13.690]  your data and then you need to ask or yeah I say not just that but just the
[21:13.690 --> 21:21.010]  overall efficacy reliability of using PCR correctly and making sure that
[21:21.010 --> 21:27.050]  they're you know bringing in the material and extracting correctly making
[21:27.050 --> 21:32.890]  sure that their protocols primers probes everything is on point you know
[21:32.890 --> 21:38.850]  because I've seen as you have as well as let a false positive at other labs all
[21:38.850 --> 21:47.890]  our false negatives things like that so not all qPCR I didn't see that does Joe
[21:47.890 --> 21:52.050]  attribute many of the tobacco mosaic virus claims to actually be hoplite
[21:52.050 --> 21:55.410]  environment is TMV prevailing in cannabis commercially or is it a myth at
[21:55.730 --> 22:00.970]  future cannabis product what's up Chad Justin you want to talk about TMV first
[22:00.970 --> 22:06.410]  and then I'll say my two cents no no we'll go back to TMV go ahead and all
[22:06.410 --> 22:10.770]  let me ask let me answer Chad's question or what was I in there so maybe lots of
[22:10.770 --> 22:14.450]  Chad lots of people thought hoplite enviroid was TMV I used to work with
[22:14.450 --> 22:17.090]  tomato people that were super scared of it they didn't allow people smoke
[22:17.090 --> 22:22.890]  cigarettes I personally have not detected a lot much or actually any TMV
[22:22.890 --> 22:26.730]  in the data and the stuff when I've gone testing for it but I think Justin
[22:26.730 --> 22:33.610]  has right yeah there's a specific pathologist that and a specific breeder
[22:33.610 --> 22:39.730]  that I know of where the plant did test positive for TMV okay all right back to
[22:39.730 --> 22:44.850]  all right sweet back to false positives and false negatives depending on the
[22:44.850 --> 22:51.130]  technology being used all right yeah like we said chain of custody how
[22:51.130 --> 22:55.290]  samples are even collected matters right let's put on testing shenanigans
[22:55.290 --> 22:59.610]  right sometimes when people have big moms part of the plant can test positive
[22:59.610 --> 23:03.570]  and part of the plant can test negative so that's one confounding factor in
[23:03.570 --> 23:08.130]  itself right that's how when people are doing these big cloning projects and
[23:08.130 --> 23:15.170]  dudding seems random in their population think about your process when you think
[23:15.170 --> 23:18.730]  about your disease right you're like well how do you really collect moms you
[23:18.730 --> 23:22.010]  know the next generation and you're like okay I take mom I put her on a
[23:22.010 --> 23:26.770]  maybe a you know hopefully for your the backs of your employees sakes that mom
[23:26.770 --> 23:29.490]  is at some kind of operational level anyways the mom you cut you take
[23:29.490 --> 23:34.690]  cuttings throughout a single mom maybe from the top down maybe from left right
[23:34.690 --> 23:37.810]  a lot of different people do this differently but at the end of the product
[23:37.810 --> 23:42.730]  you have a bouquet of cuttings or a bag or a container of cuttings from one mom
[23:42.730 --> 23:48.050]  and then you go do slice and prick so at the next stage that bouquet gets maybe
[23:48.050 --> 23:53.450]  dunked in something and then it gets you know pricked in Rockwell cubes it
[23:53.450 --> 23:57.050]  there's other stages in this process right but my point is the bouquet
[23:57.050 --> 24:01.130]  everything got mixed up like a barrel of monkeys and then you prick it and since
[24:01.130 --> 24:05.630]  parts of that big mom donor plant was positive and negative your tray has
[24:05.630 --> 24:11.050]  these weird chunks of a bunch of these plugs failed but this section was good
[24:11.050 --> 24:15.570]  and then or you know it's never like uniform like lost the whole thing or
[24:15.570 --> 24:19.970]  everything was great it's this weird spottiness and then that randomness
[24:19.970 --> 24:26.410]  follows down the rest of the cycle when you look at your room and what duds so
[24:26.410 --> 24:30.650]  that in itself sampling and distribution of the viroid in the plant is the
[24:30.650 --> 24:35.210]  starting issue the next one is kind of like extraction technologies and just
[24:35.210 --> 24:41.370]  what kind of assay you're gonna use and some people do like a RNA extraction and
[24:41.370 --> 24:45.730]  there's multiple ways of doing that and then they put that into what's called
[24:45.730 --> 24:50.850]  PCR polymerase chain reaction again I'm simplifying it streamlining this whole
[24:50.850 --> 24:55.250]  process and then there's different kinds of PCR right there's even different
[24:55.250 --> 25:01.450]  kinds of quantitative PCR there's probe based I'm 10 year old plant a plant PhD
[25:01.450 --> 25:07.330]  so I call it taq man PCR and that's one way that's kind of how the FDA the VA
[25:07.330 --> 25:10.890]  use this kind of PCR technology to look for COVID and then you have this other
[25:10.890 --> 25:16.250]  quantitative PCR called cyber green quantitative PCR which has its pros and
[25:16.250 --> 25:21.850]  cons and is less sensitive maybe than the probe based one and then there's
[25:21.850 --> 25:27.450]  just straight-up og called endpoint PCR where you like run a gel like an agarose
[25:27.450 --> 25:31.930]  gel you take it out of the tube stain it through and then that's very that's not
[25:31.930 --> 25:37.450]  as quantitative as the quantitative PCR that uses lights to detect the presence
[25:37.450 --> 25:41.610]  absence of that signal so that in itself there's three different
[25:41.610 --> 25:47.090]  technologies mainly used I'll talk about RPA the isothermal reactions that are
[25:47.090 --> 25:53.570]  super interesting but just let's just talk about PCR right the viral titer
[25:53.570 --> 25:57.930]  it's all about there are these things called invisible infections right where
[25:57.930 --> 26:04.770]  if how could you if you had some if you had some way to detect something what if
[26:04.770 --> 26:08.690]  there's like only one copy in like 1 trillion right how would that's
[26:08.690 --> 26:14.250]  invisible to some technologies so sometimes when you get these strength of
[26:14.250 --> 26:19.130]  signals from quantitative PCR sometimes you get strong signals and sometimes you
[26:19.130 --> 26:23.690]  get weak signals and those weak signals are sometimes fall you're like okay is
[26:23.690 --> 26:28.810]  that is that a false negative or is that a false positive or is that like a
[26:28.810 --> 26:34.690]  barely they're not negative and me and Justin have tracked these questionable
[26:34.690 --> 26:40.170]  we call them high CT values right like a normal CT value of some of a positive Q
[26:40.170 --> 26:44.450]  PCR assay is something like in the 20s that's the number of cycles that you did
[26:44.450 --> 26:48.810]  the PCR amplification to detect your thing right in this case hoplate and
[26:48.810 --> 26:53.730]  byroid if there's a very very very low amount of starting material that it
[26:53.730 --> 26:58.970]  takes many more cycles and then at a super high number of cycles you're like
[26:58.970 --> 27:04.010]  was that even real to start with like mathematically I think at 36 cycles
[27:04.010 --> 27:10.370]  that's like a billion fold amplification where if you see something you had one
[27:10.370 --> 27:14.570]  molecule in your tube someone's gonna bust my balls in the comments throughout
[27:14.570 --> 27:20.690]  about this anyways so yeah so it's this whole issue about can you even see it
[27:20.690 --> 27:25.770]  that it's there and so you have technological issues you have sampling
[27:25.770 --> 27:32.050]  issues so it's really you can't it's not one thing that you just do once and
[27:32.050 --> 27:35.770]  you're like I'm good or I'm not good right this is not like when I was in
[27:35.770 --> 27:40.370]  high school and I would go to plant parent could and get a STD test I was
[27:40.370 --> 27:44.970]  not like all right I'm good from here on out for the meantime right this is
[27:44.970 --> 27:49.010]  something that you need to continuously do in agriculture if you like you need
[27:49.010 --> 27:53.730]  to keep this is how horticulture and the National Clean Plant Network works
[27:53.730 --> 27:58.970]  for if you go to UC Davis Foundation Plant Services or the National Clean
[27:58.970 --> 28:05.570]  Plant Network station in Riverside or University of Washington or Cornell or
[28:05.570 --> 28:10.730]  Madison Wisconsin they're like hey do you I need this clean plant right I'm
[28:10.730 --> 28:15.710]  gonna go to Davis and buy a clean and order a clean chestnut that's a verified
[28:15.710 --> 28:19.230]  virus free they're like that'll be several thousand dollars in two years
[28:19.230 --> 28:25.550]  and I'm like okay okay that's what it takes that yeah so the clean plant
[28:25.550 --> 28:32.070]  program based on hops based off of the Pacific Northwest that's kind of where I
[28:32.070 --> 28:37.510]  learned a lot about this system and I work closely with a with salt with a PhD
[28:37.510 --> 28:43.350]  product of the National Clean Plant Network citrus program and I learn a lot
[28:43.350 --> 28:50.190]  from these folks and yeah jet jet just quickly Joe can you clarify I mean
[28:50.190 --> 28:54.950]  obviously there's some cultivars that in their nature yield lower that's not what
[28:54.950 --> 28:59.070]  you're talking about you're talking about relative to a plant's potential
[28:59.070 --> 29:06.870]  whether it's lower normal related to us oh no totally I'm not talking about like
[29:06.870 --> 29:12.710]  I normally make 90 pounds of bananas and I made 70 pounds of bananas let's let's
[29:12.710 --> 29:15.390]  be honest everyone here on this call and a lot of our watchers we're here to
[29:15.390 --> 29:20.910]  grow fire right Justin you want to talk about this exactly yeah sure I mean
[29:20.910 --> 29:27.670]  specifically we're resin farmers right I mean at the end of the day that's what
[29:27.670 --> 29:34.510]  we are right resin farmers so I would specifically say hoplate and viroid does
[29:34.510 --> 29:40.550]  affect overall yield but it heavily affects resin yield the entire cannibal
[29:40.550 --> 29:46.150]  content the terpene synthase all of it I mean it just destroys flower a week
[29:46.150 --> 29:50.830]  six weeks seven week eight like you see the flower turn I mean I have lots of
[29:50.830 --> 29:57.270]  pictures of side-by-side plants where you see a really beautiful flower and
[29:57.270 --> 30:01.390]  then right next to it a positive plant you see this like burnt kind of crisp
[30:01.390 --> 30:09.110]  looking low quality low resin plant and so it doesn't just affect your physical
[30:09.110 --> 30:14.270]  yield it affects your resin completely all the cannibal contents the trichomes
[30:14.270 --> 30:19.110]  like they don't they don't pop up they're not there yeah even for the best
[30:19.110 --> 30:23.390]  growers you know I Joe yeah one of our one of our mutual friends in San
[30:23.390 --> 30:29.750]  Francisco that his grow we tested a bunch of stuff and you know it's like
[30:29.750 --> 30:34.230]  his stuff was one plant would express and the next one wouldn't and it would
[30:34.230 --> 30:38.270]  have you'd have this beautiful amazing sticky plant next to this dry dutted out
[30:38.350 --> 30:44.070]  plant yeah and go ahead well I think what and yeah like took because I'm
[30:44.070 --> 30:49.910]  because I have totally and it's not even really art yes totally impacts even like
[30:49.910 --> 30:53.870]  really good growers but what about beginners right I think about like when
[30:53.870 --> 30:59.550]  I was really starting you know like whole rooms and stuff back and like I
[30:59.550 --> 31:03.750]  can't say exactly when fully whatever yeah it was yeah the mid-20 teens you
[31:03.750 --> 31:08.990]  know I was doing these rooms and I was like this wasn't great but this is like
[31:08.990 --> 31:13.430]  the second time I've done this right so I would be like maybe I just suck right
[31:13.430 --> 31:18.510]  and but when I look back years later right I was like yeah no those plants
[31:18.510 --> 31:22.870]  didn't have any frosting yeah I had it yes I had issues with lights yes I had
[31:22.870 --> 31:27.350]  issues with nutrients it was like the third room that I ever did flower on my
[31:27.350 --> 31:31.150]  you know what I mean and then so a lot of people that just don't have that kind
[31:31.150 --> 31:34.710]  of like the experience under their belt they experience dutting and they're
[31:34.710 --> 31:39.830]  like well mate well I did fuck up on Cal Mag that for those two weeks and and not
[31:39.830 --> 31:44.270]  just the individual beginner growers it's kind of like people that aren't
[31:44.270 --> 31:47.590]  used to dealing with this disease because that's what I deal with outdoor
[31:47.590 --> 31:52.470]  it with other states and other countries where people are like hey the management
[31:52.470 --> 31:57.430]  this is always like the head grower or someone in cultivation and they're like
[31:57.430 --> 32:01.270]  hey we're having these issues and the management people are like hell maybe
[32:01.270 --> 32:05.910]  you're just not doing your job right you know or maybe they've hyper focus on one
[32:05.910 --> 32:10.670]  very real but only tangentially relevant problem where they're like oh no it's
[32:10.670 --> 32:14.310]  the lights as soon as we fix the lights that then everything will get better or
[32:14.310 --> 32:17.710]  oh no we just need to dial in the nutrients or maybe it's our media system
[32:17.710 --> 32:22.230]  or maybe it's a temperature issue with the building or room and they're like
[32:22.230 --> 32:27.950]  when we fix that problem the dutting will go away and that's a big deal in
[32:27.950 --> 32:32.670]  like Oklahoma and the Midwest I think right now where people are like the
[32:32.670 --> 32:37.110]  whole operation is only a year or two old so they're like okay maybe you're
[32:37.110 --> 32:41.230]  suffering these things because it's just growing pains and it's many times likely
[32:41.230 --> 32:48.550]  that they got disease genetics in from another state straight up right yeah
[32:48.550 --> 32:52.190]  it's really interesting and then you know it's just like high quality
[32:52.190 --> 32:56.550]  genetics if you're not a good grower it's gonna be hard for you to tell the
[32:56.550 --> 33:01.230]  difference between an amazing cultivar and a mediocre cultivar well that's I
[33:01.230 --> 33:05.790]  think a lot of that is just genetics in general I think anyone that's ever sold
[33:05.790 --> 33:11.070]  or distributed genetics in the cannabis or hemp space everyone is always like is
[33:11.070 --> 33:18.150]  this fire can I get 30% THC can I get 5% CBG can I get you know can I get these
[33:18.510 --> 33:24.070]  out of this plant and one of my friends Carlos is like well can you like you
[33:24.070 --> 33:28.070]  know are you capable of produce what can you show me that you have produced as
[33:28.070 --> 33:32.750]  your kind of like benchmark right like I think in the people that are all about
[33:32.750 --> 33:38.430]  like pound per plant pound per square foot very few people kind of like say
[33:38.430 --> 33:45.110]  the numbers and their distribution sales or just the bag of flour in their hand
[33:45.110 --> 33:53.710]  you know pony up on that talk right yeah totally well so I guess we should
[33:53.710 --> 33:58.430]  jump into prevention unless you want to talk about the handheld device oh yeah
[33:58.430 --> 34:03.630]  so yeah these two other technologies so there's a these are isothermal these are
[34:03.630 --> 34:07.870]  isothermal reactions polymerase chain reaction is this kind of like three
[34:07.870 --> 34:13.710]  temperature cycle that this guy carry mollus got a Nobel Prize for in the like
[34:13.710 --> 34:19.470]  80s or 90s thinking about this way of detecting molecular biology on an LSD
[34:19.470 --> 34:25.190]  fuel to drive to Tahoe anyways there's different kinds of molecular biology
[34:25.190 --> 34:28.310]  techniques to detect this kind of stuff that have been developed in like the
[34:28.310 --> 34:35.030]  recent decades and there are these isothermal reactions called lamp and RPA
[34:35.030 --> 34:39.050]  I'm gonna screw up the acronym for RPA I'm just gonna say RPA is one of the
[34:39.050 --> 34:44.970]  technologies used by this company Agdia that has a handheld device that I am you
[34:44.970 --> 34:48.650]  know I'm in talks with them about demoing one and potentially acquiring
[34:48.650 --> 34:55.890]  one and it's this handheld device that you can do six samples at a time and it
[34:55.890 --> 34:59.810]  just runs it all at one temperature and it's a different kind of molecular
[34:59.810 --> 35:06.930]  biology reaction but it uses primers just like PCR to bind a target DNA or
[35:06.930 --> 35:11.610]  RNA sequence to detect it basically right that's all we really need to talk
[35:11.610 --> 35:15.130]  about and it all happens at one temperature these kinds of reactions are
[35:15.130 --> 35:21.650]  you know still like 13 for $13 a reaction and the the machine itself is
[35:21.650 --> 35:27.410]  like $10,000 right so I'm like okay this is interesting as an on-site diagnostics
[35:27.410 --> 35:31.890]  that could be really interesting because how the Agdia were how it how the Agdia
[35:31.890 --> 35:36.810]  whole process works is I worked with Agdia before on their antibody plant
[35:36.930 --> 35:41.570]  virus tests and how the many of the Agdia platform works is you take leaves
[35:41.570 --> 35:49.970]  and you put it in this weird ziplock bag thingy that has like mesh and it has a
[35:49.970 --> 35:53.890]  buffer in it and you kind of like homogenize it by just doing this and
[35:53.890 --> 35:58.010]  everyone is like is that good enough and I'm like I don't know you like
[35:58.010 --> 36:01.610]  everyone's like is that good enough you get the RNA out that way and I'm like I
[36:01.610 --> 36:07.690]  guess right like I'm like my in what they do it in PCR we like use machines
[36:07.690 --> 36:12.970]  to you know make it this you know this uniform green soup but I again I haven't
[36:12.970 --> 36:16.490]  I need to get hands-on time with this Agdia machine and then you get this
[36:16.490 --> 36:21.010]  green soup and you mix the green soup with a buffer with you know which is
[36:21.010 --> 36:28.730]  salts and stuff with this little pellet and the pellet has all of the enzyme all
[36:28.730 --> 36:34.650]  of the stuff to make that RPA analysis reaction happen you put that in a
[36:34.650 --> 36:38.610]  little tube you put that little tube in the machine that can hold six tubes at
[36:38.610 --> 36:42.770]  once and then in 20 minutes you have an assay right and I'm like okay and you
[36:42.770 --> 36:45.850]  just have a straight positive negative that's all they give you they don't give
[36:45.850 --> 36:50.770]  you a you know CT valve you know it was a faint week this is a weak positive or
[36:50.770 --> 36:55.250]  this was a Agdia wants to streamline the whole program so it's like an iPhone
[36:55.250 --> 36:58.810]  almost where you just you know mix the three things together stick it in the
[36:58.810 --> 37:04.010]  thingy press the button BAM right but there's pros and cons to this system
[37:04.010 --> 37:07.650]  obviously right you're like well what if that green goop step wasn't good enough
[37:07.650 --> 37:12.130]  what if you know the handheld machine wasn't sensitive enough what if I
[37:12.130 --> 37:16.570]  diluted it first you know how much could I dilute it before it goes negative
[37:16.570 --> 37:20.610]  these are these kinds of like limit of detection questions that are obvious
[37:20.610 --> 37:25.050]  that I need to see with my own hands before I tell someone go buy this thing
[37:25.050 --> 37:29.650]  but I do will tell people openly and be like this is a thing that exists in the
[37:29.650 --> 37:33.930]  industry right several groups are using it but I just haven't talked to any of
[37:33.930 --> 37:40.410]  them mano a mano yet so yeah the potential is great I think I think it
[37:40.410 --> 37:44.050]  sounds awesome I can't wait to get my hands on one like hope it'll happen in
[37:44.050 --> 37:47.310]  the next month or two with all my driving around California now that I'm
[37:47.310 --> 37:51.710]  vaccinated like I'm like tell me where to go and I'll go give them a visit I'm
[37:51.710 --> 37:55.990]  like I know you want to sell me the this you know tens of thousands of dollars of
[37:55.990 --> 38:03.270]  machine and kits yeah yeah so let's let's dive into prevention because I
[38:03.270 --> 38:07.150]  think there's a lot of people that think that I'm just gonna sanitize with alcohol
[38:07.150 --> 38:12.070]  and that's gonna cut it and that's just not the case with hop late well I saw
[38:12.070 --> 38:17.190]  something in the comments actually that keeps popping up that's someone asking
[38:17.190 --> 38:24.190]  can hop late and drill ride be passed from any other plant species definitely
[38:24.190 --> 38:28.630]  hops yeah that's what I mean you know so I just want that to be very clear that
[38:28.630 --> 38:35.470]  of course it can there's a lot of plant diseases that are named based off what
[38:35.470 --> 38:41.110]  plant they were found in originally but passed to all kinds of plants so yes be
[38:41.110 --> 38:45.230]  careful with other plants and actually something I make sure that my employees
[38:45.230 --> 38:52.830]  don't do not have late and very specifically but botrytis is a huge
[38:52.830 --> 38:59.790]  problem right little tangent but I don't allow fresh fruit or vegetables in my
[38:59.790 --> 39:06.630]  break room or at my lab specifically because those can harbor different
[39:06.630 --> 39:10.810]  things on the pests and molds and all kinds of stuff so you should be really
[39:10.810 --> 39:15.130]  careful with other plants or fresh fruit or vegetables around your growth
[39:15.130 --> 39:23.050]  or home grows a lot of employees will go back and forth from their home grow or a
[39:23.050 --> 39:31.530]  friend's grow and then go straight to work same clothes yeah you can bring all
[39:31.530 --> 39:37.450]  kinds of cool stuff into your commercial sanity yeah clean environment by having
[39:37.450 --> 39:41.130]  employees that have home grows I mean I think a lot of people try to tell their
[39:41.130 --> 39:45.490]  employees not to but are they gonna listen who knows yeah it's enforcement
[39:45.490 --> 39:49.930]  it's the enforcement and kind of like making the whole team all of the
[39:49.930 --> 39:53.450]  employees you got to make people care and that's different for different
[39:53.450 --> 39:58.250]  people right I think many employers work with this you know struggle with this on
[39:58.250 --> 40:01.050]  all sorts of different levels right because you don't own your employees but
[40:01.050 --> 40:04.530]  you want your employees to care and how do you do that do you do it with a fully
[40:04.530 --> 40:09.610]  stocked food break room right do that with you know some product every Friday
[40:09.610 --> 40:15.810]  afternoon do you do that with you know PTO programs or whatever it's
[40:15.810 --> 40:19.850]  interesting how I'm watching people implement kind of like because it's not
[40:19.850 --> 40:25.210]  even more rigorous it's just a program for things like tool sanitation and
[40:25.210 --> 40:30.490]  people are like oh it's so hard for us to kind of like do this now it's hard
[40:30.490 --> 40:34.770]  for us to deal with the budgets and implementation of this kinds of like
[40:34.770 --> 40:38.610]  disease and pathogen testing and I just tell everyone it's right or well I tell
[40:38.610 --> 40:42.330]  people in California I'm like we survived things that were implemented
[40:42.330 --> 40:45.430]  because of the realities of our situation before back in the day we
[40:45.430 --> 40:53.730]  didn't have to do THC compliance testing or testing for metals or pesticides you
[40:53.730 --> 40:57.450]  know you go back 10 you know in cannabis you go back five years and the whole
[40:57.690 --> 41:03.970]  scenes different as you go back right so I love hanging out with Justin and James
[41:03.970 --> 41:07.530]  because we get to talk about what was like what was stuff like when you were
[41:07.530 --> 41:11.010]  listening to DMX right and you're like well I've been listening to DMX since
[41:11.010 --> 41:14.650]  you know the 90s so what do you mean mid-2000s DMX or like 90s you know and
[41:14.650 --> 41:19.370]  you're like what was going on in weed that time right we in James we were
[41:19.370 --> 41:22.650]  talking about this if you were this person breeding in this part of the
[41:22.650 --> 41:26.530]  country you were probably working with these kinds of genetics right that's
[41:26.530 --> 41:33.770]  true at different times so that's why yeah I've only been in in cannabis for
[41:33.770 --> 41:37.690]  like you know five six years but you know I've been in cannabis for 15 and
[41:37.690 --> 41:42.090]  you guys have been working and producing for decades now and I love everyone's
[41:42.090 --> 41:49.650]  different story totally totally so let's go back to sanitizing tools and
[41:49.650 --> 41:55.650]  prevention alcohol you want to talk about Justin alcohol doesn't cut it I
[41:55.650 --> 42:00.930]  think people I saw something about 70% alcohol 90% alcohol that that just
[42:00.930 --> 42:04.010]  doesn't cut it and there's all there's a lot of things that do and a lot of
[42:04.010 --> 42:07.210]  things that you can sanitize your tools with because I think that's one of the
[42:07.210 --> 42:11.930]  most important things what's your take on that Justin well alcohol I believe
[42:11.930 --> 42:18.090]  was starting to be used because alcohol helps dissolve resin and so trimmers
[42:18.090 --> 42:23.210]  would use them on their scissors and I think it snuck into people thinking they
[42:23.210 --> 42:27.290]  were being cleaned by using alcohol on their scissors and don't get me wrong
[42:27.290 --> 42:31.970]  alcohol is good for bacteria we use it heavily in the lab and bacteria is the
[42:31.970 --> 42:40.210]  most present but it does not work well with viruses and viroids completely not
[42:40.210 --> 42:44.450]  all of them especially viroids and Joe can talk more about that but also fungi
[42:44.450 --> 42:51.130]  alcohol doesn't kill all fungi it's fun guys very resistant so no alcohol the
[42:51.130 --> 42:55.290]  overall answer that I have for people's alcohol is not good enough and something
[42:55.290 --> 43:00.810]  that was a discussion online the other day is that cultivated actually the
[43:00.810 --> 43:06.610]  nursery in Sacramento discussed or was discussing I think on Joe's Instagram
[43:06.610 --> 43:10.970]  about tool sanitation and what works well that doesn't destroy your scissors
[43:10.970 --> 43:15.650]  so that's kind of a problem that if you're using bleach or viricone which
[43:15.650 --> 43:20.090]  does work well and Joe has some papers on this as well I'm actually putting
[43:20.090 --> 43:25.050]  them in the chat right now I'm trying okay good yeah that shows efficacy of
[43:25.050 --> 43:31.970]  each so so yeah bleach slash viricone viricone is pretty stable it works well
[43:31.970 --> 43:38.370]  but it does oxidize your scissors so you have to use it correctly and you know
[43:38.370 --> 43:41.730]  end up swapping out your scissors more often than you would expect because it's
[43:41.730 --> 43:48.210]  corrosive so I'm also working on something that cultivated and I were
[43:48.210 --> 43:54.410]  talking something that I'm working on is using ozone aquatius ozone that's
[43:54.410 --> 43:59.210]  something I've been working with heavily as far as water treatment and so I'm
[43:59.210 --> 44:04.330]  trying to get it in the lab and nurseries so we always have a nice cold
[44:04.330 --> 44:12.010]  so you're not using heat or bleach ozone is pretty okay for people and
[44:12.010 --> 44:19.210]  aquatius suspension and works great at sterilizing so I've been playing around
[44:19.210 --> 44:24.730]  with that actually lately how about h2o to or Cl O2 hydrogen peroxide or a
[44:24.730 --> 44:30.930]  chlorine dioxide I haven't seen any papers on chlorine dioxide I know there's
[44:30.930 --> 44:37.410]  it has something to do if I can totally could be misquoting but has to do with
[44:37.410 --> 44:41.570]  the molecular structure of chlorine dioxide supposedly it's a better more
[44:41.610 --> 44:46.250]  efficient oxidizer that was one thing that's been told me by the the procure
[44:46.250 --> 44:54.010]  guys and I have used that in gas form to kind of like help cleanse rooms but I
[44:54.010 --> 44:58.530]  have not specifically done any trials to look for efficacy against a
[44:58.530 --> 45:04.650]  varoid but my suspicion it's chlorine so at the end of the day it's gonna act the
[45:04.650 --> 45:12.370]  same as you know you would use bleach or vericon and what was the other one
[45:12.370 --> 45:21.810]  you said h2o to hydrogen peroxide yeah that's an oxidizer as well and it works
[45:21.810 --> 45:28.210]  I believe Joe on that paper they show the efficacy of h2o to correct on that
[45:28.210 --> 45:35.170]  I put up on the I put up like two papers on the chat and the first one it
[45:35.170 --> 45:40.290]  compares things like milk bleach vericon as hydrogen peroxide and they have a
[45:40.290 --> 45:47.370]  chart with something like 20 chemicals in it interesting yeah oh no no that's
[45:47.370 --> 45:53.050]  the other one that that's the I put up two links yeah that the that's the link
[45:53.050 --> 45:59.530]  to Oli Bechtas paper on hoplite and viroid and cannabis which actually the
[45:59.530 --> 46:04.210]  references section on that paper is really interesting so just the resources
[46:04.210 --> 46:09.570]  that Oli referenced and that group it wasn't just all on that group
[46:09.570 --> 46:13.170]  referenced on that paper just the resources because even in that there's
[46:13.170 --> 46:18.250]  like a sub review of viral diseases in hops so you're like okay what are these
[46:18.250 --> 46:23.010]  future things that we're worried about coming because honestly hoplite and
[46:23.010 --> 46:26.130]  byroid is you know it's literally everywhere it's international it's in
[46:26.130 --> 46:32.210]  Europe it's in Canada it's probably wherever West Coast cannabis has been
[46:32.210 --> 46:36.810]  distributed and probably if we got infected from somewhere else wherever
[46:36.810 --> 46:41.530]  that originated from right so we know it's you know semi globally distributed
[46:41.530 --> 46:48.890]  everyone right now in 29 2021 is 2021 is kind of dealing with like the out the
[46:48.890 --> 46:55.530]  aftermath of the last few years it's really been spread around globally so
[46:55.530 --> 46:59.690]  lots of people and all sorts of production systems in Europe and North
[46:59.690 --> 47:05.970]  America at least have had these kinds of like scaling problems that for many of
[47:05.970 --> 47:09.730]  them their scaling problems had nothing to do with the disease for many of them
[47:09.730 --> 47:14.730]  they had scaling problems because money or labor or kovat but you know many but
[47:14.850 --> 47:19.970]  many of them also had scaling problems they tried to scale infected stock and
[47:19.970 --> 47:27.770]  then the populations once you went from 10,000 plants to a hundred thousand
[47:27.770 --> 47:32.930]  plants a million plants that that shit don't scale linearly right problems when
[47:32.930 --> 47:35.970]  things get you know biggie said it the best right more money more problems as
[47:35.970 --> 47:41.330]  you get more plants you know problems that were little problems and warehouses
[47:41.650 --> 47:49.970]  become really scary problems when it's for facilities on a compound so I think
[47:49.970 --> 47:53.570]  that's these are the big leagues right you know go talk to someone that's grown
[47:53.570 --> 48:01.490]  blueberries or bananas or roses or you know citrus trees or rice you know it's
[48:01.490 --> 48:05.290]  my you know my grand you know my family grows rice and anyways whatever and
[48:05.290 --> 48:10.370]  you're like they're like this is hard this is a numbers game and losses at big
[48:10.370 --> 48:14.650]  numbers yeah you lose 10% of a warehouse whatever you lose 10% of
[48:14.650 --> 48:21.970]  several acres of flower that's terrifying numbers right or not even
[48:21.970 --> 48:25.250]  terrifying because at that scale whatever's right it's just significant
[48:25.250 --> 48:29.210]  very significant numbers I think me and Justin right now one thing that we've
[48:29.210 --> 48:34.930]  realized in our you know several years now of creating a tested Marist M-based
[48:34.930 --> 48:40.130]  library and is convincing people the importance of this work that we've been
[48:40.130 --> 48:45.530]  doing for several years and because Justin you can talk to this right people
[48:45.530 --> 48:51.570]  are like well what is what is the big deal right about this whole loss thing
[48:51.570 --> 48:55.610]  right what's five five percent acceptable loss just grow ten percent bigger right
[48:55.610 --> 49:03.050]  oh I mean look at large-scale and what's still is that just me we me and you
[49:03.050 --> 49:07.690]  always need to qualify our scale because people are always like yoga I got a
[49:07.690 --> 49:12.250]  bajillion plants and in this state bro and you know because you know me and you
[49:12.250 --> 49:16.450]  I'm always like yeah I've had these intermediate stage populations where I'm
[49:16.450 --> 49:21.450]  like you know hundred thousand ish tissue culture plants in a single
[49:21.450 --> 49:25.890]  facility that's what I'm about and people have corroborated I can
[49:25.890 --> 49:30.530]  corroborate that from people that do and don't like me right I'm like I have you
[49:30.530 --> 49:36.210]  know these populations and these yields that I had can back up right and Justin
[49:36.210 --> 49:41.490]  together have a library that we could back up but Justin come on go I just set
[49:41.490 --> 49:46.530]  you up yeah yeah well with scale right like a lot of people don't want to admit
[49:46.530 --> 49:52.970]  that there is a financial aspect to cannabis obviously which you know you
[49:52.970 --> 49:56.330]  just have to choose who you work with and make sure that they're a good
[49:56.330 --> 49:59.330]  person at the end of the day right everybody has to feed themselves and
[49:59.330 --> 50:04.530]  employee people so when we talk about scale a lot of these facilities I visit
[50:04.530 --> 50:09.170]  I would say are producing tens of thousands of cuttings a month after
[50:09.170 --> 50:16.290]  nursery growing hundreds and hundreds of pounds a month of cannabis and an
[50:16.290 --> 50:22.170]  example is like I work out in Pennsylvania and if that group had a 10%
[50:22.170 --> 50:27.370]  loss you're looking at I mean so with Pennsylvania right now with how
[50:27.370 --> 50:34.170]  everything is you it's really hard to get flour there's only 25 grow processors
[50:34.170 --> 50:39.730]  in the state so I look at it as from if you lose a hundred pounds to something
[50:39.730 --> 50:44.650]  like coplate and vero specifically and you can't sell that flour you can't
[50:44.650 --> 50:48.890]  produce any extract from it then that's a hundred pounds lost that the patients
[50:48.890 --> 50:53.890]  can't get access to so that's how I look at it is is really a lot of those folks
[50:53.890 --> 50:59.410]  out there are truly medicinal users and so they're already struggling and those
[50:59.410 --> 51:04.330]  people end up being forced to go to the street to get cannabis which is usually
[51:04.330 --> 51:09.290]  tainted not all the time but most time is tainted so that's how I look at it
[51:09.290 --> 51:15.850]  scaled you know issues and in yield and then of course you have the financial
[51:15.850 --> 51:19.050]  side I mean you know the company the CFO's those guys are gonna look at it
[51:19.050 --> 51:23.850]  like oh well a hundred pounds it you know eight grand a pound do the math you
[51:23.850 --> 51:31.730]  know that's a shit ton of money so yeah is do you say 800 a pound 8,000 a pound
[51:31.730 --> 51:35.970]  oh 8,000 either way that's those are crazy numbers but that's that's the
[51:35.970 --> 51:44.370]  truth you know it's like so going back on topic cultivated genetics in the chat
[51:44.370 --> 51:49.210]  said hypochlorous acid is something we are all going to be trialing as well as
[51:49.210 --> 51:53.530]  disinfectant at high ppm studies and results will be shared what's your
[51:53.530 --> 51:57.690]  thought on that Joe or Justin?
[51:57.690 --> 52:03.970]  um hypochlorous acid is not super stable it's a more natural chlorine and if I
[52:03.970 --> 52:08.210]  remember right we actually produce it in our inside of our bodies naturally to a
[52:08.210 --> 52:13.050]  degree but I could totally wrong I'm pretty sure I read that once on the
[52:13.050 --> 52:21.850]  internet. Hypochlorous acid isn't bad but it's very unstable so making sure
[52:21.850 --> 52:28.370]  that your hypochlorous acid is always at the correct ppm for the efficacy you
[52:28.370 --> 52:35.410]  know is important also developing I mean doing very good controlled trials and
[52:35.410 --> 52:39.530]  looking at contact time and what is really required because the other thing
[52:39.530 --> 52:44.170]  is if you just spray something now with bleach and wipe it off you don't
[52:44.170 --> 52:48.410]  necessarily have contact time so any sort of oxidizer needs a specific
[52:48.410 --> 52:55.050]  contact time and you always make sure that it's a stable. Hypochlorous acid I
[52:55.050 --> 53:03.530]  like it but I worry about its stability also there's a facility I was working at
[53:03.530 --> 53:07.690]  where they had the it was potassium chloride salt that would go into a
[53:07.770 --> 53:13.450]  membrane and it would make a hypochlorous acid on site I thought that was pretty
[53:13.450 --> 53:19.730]  cool but you know they're looking at forcing those guys to become certified
[53:19.730 --> 53:23.290]  as chemical manufacturers so that's another thing that it's kind of
[53:23.290 --> 53:29.530]  interesting and with any oxidizer right bleach is very strong you can
[53:29.530 --> 53:35.290]  smell it. Hypochlorous acid you can smell it a little bit but how do we make sure
[53:35.290 --> 53:42.810]  that the solution is always stable and at the correct ppm especially with
[53:42.810 --> 53:47.370]  contact time and employees right you got to make sure your employees are doing
[53:47.370 --> 53:53.890]  things correctly as well so you know how long so as far as besides I understand
[53:53.890 --> 53:58.010]  the contact time and it's different with every every chemical compound that you
[53:58.010 --> 54:03.690]  use but how long does hoplate and viroid stay alive is there something that 30
[54:03.690 --> 54:09.210]  days 60 days 90 days could still affect plants if it's on your tools or is it
[54:09.210 --> 54:16.530]  something that you know has a short half-life how does that work Joe I think
[54:16.530 --> 54:20.450]  I mean that's a really good question I think a lot of them to start off the bat
[54:20.450 --> 54:27.450]  with I don't know man however I do know some things that I've tested right um I
[54:27.450 --> 54:32.130]  tested hoplate and viroid on like semi dried flower that was like fairly deep
[54:32.130 --> 54:36.290]  into cure so you're like that plant went self was probably dead for at least
[54:36.290 --> 54:41.370]  you know two weeks when I was taking those samples and still getting like
[54:41.370 --> 54:47.810]  good RNA detection of hoplate and viroid on dutted flower it definitely is
[54:47.810 --> 54:52.050]  getting passed around on tools mechanic like viroids are you know mainly
[54:52.050 --> 54:57.050]  transmitted by tools right and tool sanitation is like one of those things
[54:57.050 --> 55:01.210]  where you eat pro you know people either do or they don't do it right because
[55:01.210 --> 55:04.450]  they either know about it or they don't really have it implemented and if
[55:04.450 --> 55:08.370]  they're implementing it they're at least trying something right there's like
[55:08.370 --> 55:13.530]  rules and gloves and maybe a there's a closet or a corner somewhere in the
[55:13.530 --> 55:17.610]  operation where you got the bleach and the mop and bucket and you know this is
[55:17.610 --> 55:23.570]  where our cleaning station is right and I talked to a lot of people and I talked
[55:23.570 --> 55:27.970]  to them about tool sanitation and they're like what and I'm like yeah bro
[55:27.970 --> 55:32.810]  the the plant juice gets on the scissors and when you mix that plant
[55:32.810 --> 55:37.130]  juice from one plant with the plant juice from the other plant sometimes you
[55:37.130 --> 55:41.370]  can spread around diseases like the viruses and people are like plants get
[55:41.370 --> 55:46.490]  viruses sometimes and I'm like yeah play actually the first virus we ever
[55:46.490 --> 55:53.170]  discovered was from plants so it goes back to this thing of you know just
[55:53.170 --> 55:56.810]  constant education and I tell them also you know what you're not just spreading
[55:56.810 --> 56:01.210]  hoplain virid you are you people also tool sanitation is good for preventing
[56:01.210 --> 56:06.570]  the spread of but try it as soon to know a pseudomonas pretty much many many
[56:06.570 --> 56:11.090]  diseases in the grow are spreader I'm like it's like sharing needles yo and
[56:11.090 --> 56:16.890]  they're like word and I'm like yes so this is kind of my PSA free info that I
[56:16.890 --> 56:22.010]  tell everyone that I have access to is like tool sanitation tool sanitation
[56:22.170 --> 56:27.730]  I'm like I tell college kids use condoms for free right I'm like that is just
[56:27.730 --> 56:33.490]  info that I hope is commonplace one day right so if I just and and the reason
[56:33.490 --> 56:38.650]  why I keep it up is I meet these people almost every week through Instagram or
[56:38.650 --> 56:43.370]  whatever and it's news to them and that's fine you know I don't I don't fade
[56:43.370 --> 56:48.010]  anyone for not knowing anything because I don't know hell of shit right and you
[56:48.010 --> 56:53.570]  know and on average you know that's the whole XKCD webcomic joke on ever average
[56:53.570 --> 56:58.530]  any new piece of information around 10,000 people learn it that day so if
[56:58.530 --> 57:03.890]  you're like nobody knows nothing right to everyone knows of that you're like
[57:03.890 --> 57:06.850]  people are born at a certain rate so you're like okay you didn't know about
[57:06.850 --> 57:11.410]  tool sanitation you're about to be today's today's of 10,000 people that
[57:11.410 --> 57:15.490]  learn something new right and then I sneak in other weird stuff like jujitsu
[57:15.490 --> 57:21.210]  or cooking our wars but it always bases around that tool sanitation don't
[57:21.210 --> 57:25.130]  spread your disease around your growth yeah okay so someone in the chat just
[57:25.130 --> 57:29.970]  had mentioned defoliating leaves like if you're if you're thinning your canopy
[57:29.970 --> 57:33.210]  how do they prevent it if they're doing something like that if they're using
[57:33.210 --> 57:36.410]  their hands should they be switching gloves between each plant what's your
[57:36.410 --> 57:43.250]  recommendation for that Justin what's yours yeah so I actually like using
[57:43.250 --> 57:49.130]  disposable razor blades it's one of the easier ways to defoliate and not have to
[57:49.130 --> 57:53.770]  worry as much about tool sanitation and as long as they use a new blade and new
[57:53.770 --> 57:58.250]  gloves on every different cultivar specifically or maybe a specific area of
[57:58.250 --> 58:01.570]  canopy just depending on what the operation is because every operation is
[58:01.570 --> 58:05.930]  a little bit different that's what I recommend and if it's not that then a
[58:05.930 --> 58:14.290]  little tool cart behind them with a cup of your con in a suit like a little soup
[58:14.290 --> 58:19.330]  container and dipping the tools in that between each plant so that you get
[58:19.330 --> 58:22.890]  contact time for sure and as long as you're swapping up between each mom
[58:22.890 --> 58:27.210]  that's gonna help mitigate a lot of the risk but definitely the SAP on the
[58:27.210 --> 58:32.510]  gloves can pass it mechanically just as well but if you grab I like to show
[58:32.510 --> 58:36.430]  people so when I defoliate and I show people to defoliate I like to actually
[58:36.430 --> 58:40.350]  grab the fans with one glove and cut with the other so you're not coming into
[58:40.350 --> 58:45.470]  contact with SAP as much as possible but when you're really reaching into canopy
[58:45.470 --> 58:49.670]  it is gonna get all over your gloves yeah I like to change hands every plant
[58:49.670 --> 58:57.390]  literally cut off and swap hands every time so what people you what I would do
[58:57.390 --> 59:01.030]  and I've seen other people do is like if you have to handle a bunch of plants
[59:01.030 --> 59:05.390]  quickly they'll put on like five pairs of gloves at once and they're like bam
[59:05.390 --> 59:10.190]  bam bam bam bam you know what I mean to like just peel off to quickly move but
[59:10.190 --> 59:15.910]  that gets expensive everyone has to make different kinds of concessions you know
[59:15.910 --> 59:21.310]  some people are all about you know like those like $3.99 boxes of razor blades
[59:21.310 --> 59:26.590]  that you buy at Home Depot or honestly probably super cheap from China online
[59:26.830 --> 59:31.750]  and they're like one razor blade a plant you know to do and but then you get into
[59:31.750 --> 59:36.230]  this gnarly stuff right of people are like well what about that your whole
[59:36.230 --> 59:40.790]  spiel you just told me a while ago about part of the plant is negative and part
[59:40.790 --> 59:45.510]  of the plant is positive and I was like the really insane people sterilize after
[59:45.510 --> 59:52.710]  every cut how sir you know what are you about what life are you about right like
[59:52.870 --> 59:59.750]  how OCD are you willing to go to we need robotic arms that's it yeah but so I'll
[59:59.750 --> 01:00:04.150]  throw in the business standpoint of that because that's a lot of my job most time
[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:08.870]  on consulting and that's you know so when you're doing flower most time when
[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.150]  cultivar you're not going to have one plant now some places I think Michigan for
[01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:19.350]  example before you know you can only do so many plants you had big ass plants so
[01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.870]  you could just cut that one big ass plant with one razor blade one pair of
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.910]  gloves not a big deal and then at scale you typically have rows and rows of
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:32.670]  specific cultivars so you know you don't have to go as overboard because there's
[01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:38.430]  going to be a point where you spend too much time physically or spend too much
[01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:42.870]  on labor to where even if you had that crop loss you're now spending more labor
[01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:47.230]  trying to prevent that crop loss so it's about proper risk mitigation and what
[01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:53.790]  makes the most sense and what just go ahead was talking about on super big
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:58.390]  populations you people do you could it's like binning or chunking you're like I
[01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:03.910]  don't test every plant but I test every five plants like clockwork so or like or
[01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.230]  you know I don't swap my tools or even you know I don't swap my tools every
[01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:11.750]  plant but every three I do or every table or every unit that I know that I
[01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:20.470]  can compartmentalize it if slash when shit goes wrong yeah interesting well I
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:25.510]  think one topic that we really haven't mentioned around it is so now that I
[01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:30.190]  find that I have it because I've done some tests what do I do because I love
[01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:35.750]  this cultivar and I want to keep this around forever how do I how do I clean
[01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:40.030]  it what do I what do I do and how should I you know how should I deal with my
[01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.910]  room that I know that's infected do I have to get rid of everything in the
[01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:47.270]  room do I get rid of what test positive what you know what's your approach on
[01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:57.750]  that Justin I mean my approach always is trying to first teach you how to
[01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:05.190]  identify it without testing to help but with specific genetic I mean I've had
[01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:11.990]  people that bring genetics like please help save this and sometimes you know
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:17.670]  tissue culture isn't successful the first time it takes multiple marist
[01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:23.430]  emanations along with some other therapies to get rid of like hoplate
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:28.510]  and viroid for example and in the meantime you have to make judgment calls
[01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:34.390]  based on who the growers what they're doing with it the scale of all of it you
[01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:39.910]  know and it's like okay do you know say if you're at large scale what makes
[01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:45.430]  financial sense to just work on tissue culturing this cultivar for now and
[01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:52.030]  replacing your crop with a different clean verified genetic or is it better
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:59.350]  to still grow the genetic and just try to be very OCD about how you cut through
[01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:04.070]  the garden and how you do everything in the garden right every case is different
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:14.030]  and so you know some people don't can't necessarily afford what it costs to
[01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:22.710]  remediate the disease through a tissue culture lab sometimes you know I've
[01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:27.230]  heard and I've never verified this I've heard people grow their plants really
[01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:31.830]  fast take the tops off and constantly clone and can outrun it I've never
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:36.630]  experienced that myself it's called hoplate viroid for a reason because it's
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:42.390]  latent and it'll come back Joe have you ever seen anybody outrun the disease I
[01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:46.590]  met people but I want to talk to someone in that had brought up a really really
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:50.310]  good point rad Ripley he's like tissue culture say goodbye to the indigenous
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.830]  microbes and he's talking about because we're bleaching material that goes in
[01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:58.870]  and out of the TC system and rad many people are already implementing some
[01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:05.350]  kind of like re-inoculation exiting tissue culture but your point of like
[01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:10.230]  what are these kinds of like endogenous microbiomes on the donor material is
[01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:15.730]  actually very very good it's super interesting point but even that varies
[01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:22.870]  from location to location so it's not like a strain has an associated and then
[01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:26.310]  you know just to contradict myself maybe through seed stuff gets saved that way
[01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:29.870]  so I'll totally argue both sides of this argument on this podcast I don't
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:33.870]  care but um but people are working on that kind of stuff and it's really it
[01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.870]  was a really interesting stuff I saw in the in the chat which is all over the
[01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:43.750]  place today ladies and gentlemen you know this is always fun yeah this chats
[01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:48.710]  awesome by the way yeah we got a lot of resistance to that's a great question
[01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:53.150]  too yeah man is oh we breed for resistance for hoplate and viroid and
[01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:57.110]  then something comes in and wipes out all the resistant ones because it's not
[01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:01.990]  hoplate and viroid right or hoplate and viroid evolves and it's red queen and
[01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:06.590]  then they're no longer resistant because it's no longer hoplate and viroid it's
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:11.870]  hoplate and viroid plus version x3 but that's a really good question you know
[01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:14.630]  and I'm sure some people are doing this kinds of like does this disease
[01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:20.190]  resistance breeding to for things like powdery mildew, botrytis, lots of things
[01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:26.790]  but I always want to maintain cannabis to breed. You always have to be careful when you breed
[01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.990]  right you're like what are you breeding for what are you gonna lose what are the
[01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:34.110]  pros and cons what are you giving up you know what are you gaining that was again
[01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.430]  really good question don't breed for anything just let the
[01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:41.270]  plants decide that's great that was great anyway sorry I caught up on the
[01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:46.190]  chat they're like they know I'm breeding it so they're putting wild shit in there
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:58.310]  100% so so yeah I guess let's take some questions before we wrap and you got
[01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:07.470]  some great stuff in the chat we do I wanted to acknowledge the biggest the
[01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:13.110]  the man hurling the most feces in the chat if I can find them that's you
[01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:20.710]  Papa Shan, Papi Shan where's your where's Papi Shan's I had it all queued
[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:32.520]  up before oh yeah anyway so this is every time you're feeling bad about
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:42.440]  yourself Joe you can reread this comment. Retiring you need a little moral boost. My sisters remind me that
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:49.320]  I have a PhD but I'm not that smart and my lady is a proud Tennessean and she reminds me
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.280]  that Californians have a special kind of elitism but what can I say is I'm all
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.240]  about West Coast cannabis right like and I used to just say California cannabis
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.720]  and then I had friends that grow up in Oregon and Seattle and you know just
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.360]  give me a call and go hey bro it's San Diego it's all the way from the from
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:16.480]  Arizona all the way to Seattle up in Washington Colorado included they're
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.680]  growing some super fire oh no you don't stop at the border either BC bud right
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:29.360]  BC bud goes way back right so I don't know yeah they're super nice but that's
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.400]  fighting words eh right oh yeah and then you know the East Coast is really
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.920]  catching up I think you know they've got good weed in Boston for a long time so
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.520]  yeah I would say coastal I'm even a mad respect to people from Chicago and all
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.840]  over the Midwest and South that are just like these little oases in the middle of
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.240]  God knows what oh yeah we talked about in Texas in the shoreline you know I
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.880]  mean we start talking about Texas there's good weed all over I mean there's
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.520]  shitty weed in California too just not as much as other places I'm like
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.840]  Birmingham Alabama really really I'm like really here Birmingham clearly
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.480]  indoors you know but uh I'm like good job guys I was like I'm impressed you
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:19.520]  know Ashland yeah see people yeah it's all yeah Ashland's got the fire for sure
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:26.720]  yeah okay so so we'll kick it off with mr. Chad Westport who asked this early
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:37.000]  and I had taken note in my little text edit notes but uh Mac also slow wait
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.920]  slow veg plant could this cut only strain likely be spreading this hoplite
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.920]  and viroid future cannabis project are those signs we'd see you can't I mean
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.480]  that's a fair question you're like people are like okay there are these
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.480]  problematic cuts that are kind of like nationally problematic and I don't know
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.880]  if that's a Mac I don't think that is a Mac thing right there's definitely I
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.000]  mean there's Mac literally everywhere back something Mac crossed to something
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.320]  right you're kind of you're like is it OG push is it this OG kush that's
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:14.920]  spreading hoplite and viroid is it this and I'm like many popular strains and
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.320]  many just you know just not even popular just many distributed strains definitely
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.280]  moved it around I've done testing very close up to and actually with some
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.440]  people directly with the breeders on pop Lee and viroid testing because I've
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.760]  been doing this shit since 2019 right literally as right before that paper
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.640]  came out I was doing this in space in 2019 so um the whole point is you're
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:44.880]  like okay shit was she a typoid Mary right was this patient zero and I think
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.480]  that we're so deep in the game that that is relevant for understanding how things
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:56.280]  spread but it is not relevant for blame right we think this thing originated
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:03.480]  somewhere on the west coast sometime in maybe during the Bush administration
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:09.520]  right like this is all pre Obama right so that is when people really sniffing
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.320]  around this kind of crop loss I believe Adam done just so you guys know it's
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:24.180]  Adam Dunn's fault we can go back to Adam no I mean all jokes aside we don't know
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.580]  exactly where it came from and I don't think we'll ever know exactly where it
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.860]  came from we're all in that I mean I'm straight up we're all in this together
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:36.180]  I'm always interested in who is putting information out into the industry and I
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.940]  don't really give a fuck if you're the first person to put something out unless
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.780]  it's like this really interesting new like game changer thing right but if
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:49.400]  you're all like hey um gloves are a good idea for preventing the spread I'm like
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.500]  great throw it on the pile that's not a game-changing thing right people are
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:58.500]  literally trying to sell hey pay me $5,000 and I'll give you a remediation
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:04.060]  program and that remediation program is literally five minutes of what we talked
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:09.420]  about today right it's like hey bleach your tools quarantine stuff this is
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:16.500]  transmittable and I love how my I'm not good at Instagram but I have mediators
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.540]  I've handlers on Instagram that are like a go in and delete that comment on that
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.540]  thingy that well that was a bot to some titties but to lead to that one that
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:30.260]  person's trying to sell these charlatan solutions and I'm like okay I think
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:34.340]  there's common knowledge that everyone needs to know about like you know tool
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:41.540]  sanitation but Justin do you want to build off of that about that you're like
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:47.660]  what is even that what have you been rambling about you gotta unmute yourself
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:53.940]  Justin's probably going to the bathroom no I mute just to make for the headphones
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:12:00.020]  so someone in the chat is like this is $5,000 worth of knowledge you could Venmo
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:05.260]  me PayPal my only fans no I'm just joking about this not not for big poppy
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:15.780]  yeah I'm not I'm just joking about that he just saved you guys $5,000 so yeah
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:22.500]  Justin is there anything else you want to touch on before before we close here
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:32.380]  ever so slightly so hoplite and viride can can be scary but just have good
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.780]  protocols good sanitation methods and make sure you're doing things right and
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:43.620]  be observational and you can do a pretty good job at preventing severe outbreaks
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:47.620]  you know I see some of the comments people like oh you're selling the same
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:53.620]  scare as Corona and this and that well you know it's not the same it's a
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:58.620]  completely different thing it's a plant pathogen plants don't travel the same
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:07.780]  way we do we're talking garden specific patient specific pathogen remediation
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:13.780]  and helping these gardens you know stop internal spread and then if you stop
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:18.220]  sharing cuts it's simple it's a lot easier right or just test the cuts that
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:24.860]  you share rest of your rest of Europe is not good Italy Spain Amsterdam Sweden
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:31.300]  Switzerland they're moving around hemp with it and something else that I'd say
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:37.060]  is you know when it does eventually become federally illegal it'll be a lot
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:43.420]  easier to help a lot more of these gardens because right now universities
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:47.820]  do a lot of cleanup work for other industry other crops strawberries
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:52.180]  blueberries things like that they get cleaned up by universities and it's much
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:57.640]  cheaper because they have federal funding and big grants the cost to do it
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:04.460]  is very expensive but I'm hoping that when we do have federal legalization at
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.740]  least some of the universities I'm working with on hemp they're still kind
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:14.540]  of careful about it but door will fly open on THC and we'll have a lot more
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:22.020]  ability to attack this so right now I just want everybody to understand like
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:27.620]  hey we're not saying you have to constantly test and you know a lot of
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.060]  the stuff we're talking about is it scaled gardens right if you're a
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.780]  homegrower you're gonna see different things you're gonna deal with different
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.420]  things right but just buy some clean verified clean cuts or pop some more
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:45.420]  seeds you know it's not gonna destroy your personal garden like it can at some
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:51.220]  of these scale places or some of these nurseries right so I don't want people
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.980]  think we're trying to sell fear we're just trying to sell precaution that's it
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:01.740]  yeah I think me and Justin both and James we know people that have lost a
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:07.100]  lot of money to this disease operations that have had to close down because of
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:12.180]  this disease companies that have had to do massive downsizing because of crop
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:17.900]  loss issues and cash flow issues because of this disease and it's very real right
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.100]  and like Justin said if you're a homegrower this is not a problem for you
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.860]  really hopefully you know the industry will sort this out and you'll have you
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.020]  know these kinds of like hey I want to buy this clone sure it's three dollars
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:32.540]  more than what I was paying ten five you know a while ago but you know I know
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:37.300]  that it shouldn't dud right we're talking about these mass production
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.140]  systems where people are growing thousands or more of plants where 10% of
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:48.780]  that or more really hurts we're talking about situations where you know
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:54.020]  providers of genetic material are in sorry I'm trying to think about my
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:16:02.060]  wording are in litigation space because of these kinds of issues and it really
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:07.860]  breaks my heart when I talk to people out in kind of like newer markets like
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:15.820]  Oklahoma or Ohio or Michigan because I have like friends that operate out in
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:21.940]  those in those systems out there and they're like dude no one even knows
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.580]  someone just got wiped out like they lost half their room and they're
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.140]  probably gonna go belly-up because things were already kind of rough and
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:33.780]  I'm like shit so that's this major concern for like you know the people
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.620]  that are taking the flower that's the highest risk in this operation in this
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:41.020]  game you know it's can you grow that flower well and then you get different
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:44.540]  prices depending on how well you do that job right and I love how in the chat
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.460]  someone was like is this all just a byproduct of capitalism is capitalism
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:53.900]  doing this to us I don't know about that maybe I think that's a really fun
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.540]  interesting conversation to have I'll go deep on that right however let's just go
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:02.220]  back to like agriculture grow plants good right grow plants good right that's
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.060]  kind of like it's but yeah it's bad English but grow plants good it's
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.180]  literally the foundation of everything right growing plants good in one place
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:13.300]  allowed us to fucking have agriculture and stay in one place and have this
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:18.340]  whole fucking concept of tomorrow right hey if I grow food here I could hang
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:23.220]  out here and tomorrow I can learn things like math and then you get into things
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.140]  like psychology capitalism socialism whatever no first you got to grow plants
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.380]  good right so you need to feed everyone so then you get into this weird issue of
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.180]  well is that you know why are you so interested in yield and you're like
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:40.300]  because this is hard work right if I'm doing all this labor I need the output
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.500]  to be consistent we just I just and that's just normal if I say hi to James
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:49.300]  every time I see him I want him to say suck back right these kinds of weird
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:56.140]  consistencies of patterns are just human fucking nature right so everyone that
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.260]  wants to grow cannabis we want to do it well for many different reasons you got
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.300]  plant pimps that just want to make money but I think the people that are really
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.940]  good at it they weren't trying to be the best grower they were just trying to do
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.900]  a really good job and by that the byproduct was success and money right so
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.380]  yeah just grow fire that's what I'm about and I grow mids at home with my
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:20.700]  like few number of runs right Justin grows fire James rose fire if you just
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.380]  put a gun to my head and grow fire I'm like God help me let's see what let's
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:28.260]  roll the dice but I'm good at giving people starting plant material that
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.340]  they're like roll that dice you got a real good chance if you could pull off
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:37.300]  fire you won't dud that's my skill set and contribution to this whole pipeline
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.420]  and running my mouth on this kind of stuff so people are like oh shit I
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:47.380]  don't know about Red Queen theory for disease evolution or Cavendish bananas
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:55.140]  whatever's yeah guys I just want to touch on that with Joe saying he doesn't
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:59.340]  grow fire and I think these are things you learn over time you know I don't
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:03.820]  think justice first harvest was extreme fire and some people you know as far as
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.340]  top a plus it's not something that happens every time either it's something
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.860]  that you learn how to do over time you and if you have gradual improvement
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:17.580]  that's a good sign if you're just staying stagnant plateauing with your
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.340]  girl and it either gets worse or just stays the same you need to really look
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:25.340]  at your protocols how you're doing it you know you need to look at your
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.820]  environment and your nutrition and see which one of those things you can
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:33.220]  improve on and slowly change stuff I know when I first started I wanted to
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.460]  change stuff every time or I wanted to use 20 different nutrients and that's
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.460]  not necessarily the best way to go about it you want to start incorporating
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.420]  things one at a time with your nutrient plan so you can see what actually makes
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:49.860]  a difference and I think keep it simple you're gonna get better product at the
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.820]  end of the day you're gonna have a better smoke and that's what we're all
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:57.740]  trying to achieve I think yeah I'm farmers right resin farmers thank you
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:01.660]  Justin for that that was great yeah and if you're if you're not progressing
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:06.740]  you're regressing yeah 100 fire changes we talk about this all the time what was
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:11.580]  fire in the 90s what was fire 10 years ago what's fired you be in 10 years from
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.980]  now my favorite thing to do when I go to new facilities and work with different
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:18.940]  cultivators is ask them specifically if they've ever had a perfect run or
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:23.780]  perfect flower and if their answer is yes or more often than not I'm like okay
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:27.860]  well you're not like you're not judging yourself enough yeah because I can
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:31.180]  always find something with wrong with my flower doesn't matter if other people
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:35.700]  can't every run I can pick something out rub yeah well this wasn't perfect
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.500]  this wasn't exactly what I wanted or it's my name is sir you know there's
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.500]  always a little bit of something there yeah this is hardcore like research and
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.380]  development pushing it's like I had professors that were like if you don't
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:52.540]  fuck up every once in a while you're not trying new shit right like that's how
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.620]  you get progress so you screw up every once in a while right I mean hopefully
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:00.180]  you mitigate it right you take this like calculated risk and you see how this
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:06.700]  thing goes out yeah learn from your mistakes I have a question based on a
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:12.100]  conversation I had with a breeder yesterday when I was telling him what
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:17.180]  we're talking about today and his thoughts are kind of a lot of the cross
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:24.420]  breeding is leading to some of these issues where and so my question is if
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:30.140]  you go back to kind of more land race he's stuffed is that stuff exhibit as
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:37.580]  much of these virus and byroid traits as stuff that's like a cross of a cross of
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:43.540]  a cross of a cross of a cross we don't know right now without I mean
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.740]  bioinformatics I don't think anybody could reliably answer that but I was
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:52.300]  like let's start off great fucking question I don't fucking know but we all
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.620]  have like my mind is right racing right now because I'm thinking of well what
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:01.980]  varieties have I worked with that are land race ish and did she deal with it
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:07.980]  differently then you know some like new recent f1 that was pushing like 31% law
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.340]  red Congolese I'll tell you red Congolese has it you know I have a
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:16.660]  friend my friend's company in San Francisco has been you know they've been
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:21.900]  they had it in tissue culture I believe through node and that red Congolese was
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.420]  for the last year has been expressing hoplate and vered that is a land race
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:31.700]  variety so I don't think land races the they can still have it and express it
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:36.460]  just like other varieties that being said a lot of these complex poly hybrids
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.380]  they're you know they're just a basically a rendition of something else
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:45.220]  and they're not super strong and stable or vigorous you don't get vigorous
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:51.100]  growth you might have awesome terpenes but as far as are they gonna perform
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:56.780]  better or worse you know I mean that's that's hearsay right and I will say
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.780]  this a lot of people right now are probably secretly working on it and
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.900]  hoarding the information due to the intellectual property rights of it you
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:12.300]  know because they want financial gain Kevin McKiernan is at least publicizing
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:19.420]  as much information as he can on the I can't read the block he's using
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:27.780]  blockchain to publish sequences for prior art so we'll have a lot of answers
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:33.540]  to this question I would say fairly soon in the next couple of years and so many
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:42.220]  people are working on it yeah yeah let me just I know you want to wrap it but
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.420]  let me just throw you kind of a bunch of the questions that have been asked and
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:49.940]  you guys can maybe pick one or wherever you want to go if you want to table them
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:57.700]  for next time our recurring hop latent viroid Joe be back every month ladies
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.700]  and gentlemen with and Joe are you feeling good about yourself right now
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:10.100]  what well cuz every time I think you're feeling a little too high and hoity-toity
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:17.740]  I'll give you a little papi love big papi PhD grow shit what a surprise but
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:23.940]  so fried piper said are there any cannabis breeders that breed for viruses
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:30.180]  resistance like vegetable breeders Jer Bear any straightforward tested evidence
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.820]  of the hemp mosaic virus or TMV the in cannabis drew Lane if you have brought
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.420]  in outside genetics to a facility and totally quarantine them through flour
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:42.860]  with proper sanitation is taking no cuttings from them or is there any worry
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:49.180]  of transfer twisted roots what human oh this is actually a good one is kind of
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:54.780]  viruses and byroids as a driver for evolution so this is twisted roots said
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:58.660]  what humans don't understand as a virus is the first step to mutation and
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:05.460]  evolution imagine the future of can cannabis keep the keep the virus Alan
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.980]  Hayes and what are the applications for CRISPR tech and tissue culture for
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:14.060]  removing the byroid Joe Versace so just to be clear tissue culture can't fully
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:23.220]  get rid of H LV magma seeds okay magma seed says are there in in Varun
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:28.420]  environmental factors that trigger it an empath said maybe a dumb question but our
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:34.340]  vaccines possible for a plant like with humans all right there's a lot there
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:41.100]  there's a lot yeah okay let me be very clear Joe and I and a couple of other
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.940]  people we know have successfully removed hoplite and override through marriage
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:50.980]  and culture and tissue culture yeah at me right and I and I'll rattle them off
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:55.400]  or I mean I know if you because they're good friends Maxwell Vetterli at Dark
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:04.560]  Heart who else has put up straight-up data right that their test tube plants
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.040]  test or you know test tube garden he's put up some PCR testing data of his
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.960]  post Marist M stuff I think Rick Rick is successful he removed it right yeah and
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.720]  let's just stop there yeah let's and there's others and others London will
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:24.040]  leave it at that yeah yeah I think the problem too with that is there's a lot
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.120]  of consultants going around saying they can clean it they can do Marist M
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:36.480]  culture I mean in in the reality is it's extremely difficult and expensive as a
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:42.760]  startup and a lab and it takes a big learning curve but I didn't do tissue
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:50.000]  culture before about four years ago and I think that my cannabis experience
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.320]  contributed to my success in tissue culture but I originally was just doing
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.360]  it for myself until people started knocking down my door and begging me to
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:05.480]  do it for him and I'm like uh okay fine so and Joe's been doing it longer than I
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:12.760]  have it's it's not easy why do they keep saying all breeding is selective which
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.480]  is a fair point but I don't know how meta they're getting with it right that's
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:26.520]  like a super loaded ass question right very selective question like yeah and
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:34.600]  apparently this chat hates Joe Rogan well I love my he don't sell yourself
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.720]  short well bald and jiu-jitsu man it's not yeah but there were other things on
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.240]  that test or the driving force can we learn to live with it that's actually a
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.720]  really good question too because people are like if this happens in agriculture
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:53.640]  if when you take a look at disease progression in a crop you want to
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.480]  prevent diseases coming in that's kind of like the first stage and then if it
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.480]  gets in you want to try to get it out that's another stage but another stage
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:06.320]  is kind of like learning to live with it and you just have that kind of crop
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.960]  acceptable crop loss or you do you know mitigation factors to kind of like in
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.840]  and people have asked me this about hoplite and viroid we're like one super
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.280]  active area of research right now is why are asymptomatic plants asymptomatic
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:30.000]  and why do dudded plants dud and I'm like shit dunno smoke a bowl and think
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.080]  about that one but we're like we're looking for like biomarkers for like
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.520]  what are easier faster ways to tell the difference between an asymptomatic
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.760]  infected plant that's gonna make okay flower or and even what that even means
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.080]  right you're like just because you're asymptomatic what's really going on on
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.000]  that plant maybe your flower is kind of okay but you're like missing something
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.040]  that we just don't know about so I don't really want to envision a world where we
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.200]  kind of just have to live with hoplite and viroid I want a smallpox this
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:06.640]  motherfucker but you know you have to plan for everything and if you have to
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.600]  have those scenarios where you live with a chronic infection just like any
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:15.960]  other chronic infection there's probably going to be some kind of cost associated
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.960]  with it in long-term production and I've just seen massive massive loss to
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.520]  hoplite and viroid so I don't want to think about oh yes tolerable it's all
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.920]  right because I dealt with that bullshit for years and it's all right turned into
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:37.120]  losing half of a flower room sometimes so it's not all right right you know you
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.880]  really need to get tool sanitation going on to prevent spread but that prevents
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.960]  mechanical spread people have asked me all sorts of really good questions about
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:51.520]  does it spread through like water or shared beds or what if I have three
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:56.040]  plants in one kind of closed loop system that the irrigation system feeds can
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.080]  those three plants spread it what if three plants are touching but not you
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.080]  know what I mean like there's all this we don't know that I don't want to
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:08.280]  gamble on right now for that for introducing that kind of variable into a
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.760]  system that's supposed to make people millions of dollars plus right this is
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.760]  where we in the billions of dollars right now right that's what cannabis is
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:25.280]  turning into in this century and these operations at scale just kind of they
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:28.920]  just have to operate differently because of all the money involved like I've
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.800]  worked at startup biotech companies and I've also worked at genentech you know
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.400]  one's a billion dollar company and one's a yeah we got a hundred K in the bank so
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.120]  we're gonna tell people we have 180 right or something like that right so
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.800]  just there's different scales of reality based on the budget that drives your
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.280]  program and I get it I've been a young man once sometimes that budget is zero
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:56.560]  and credit cards I completely understand but you know you can't do that if you
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.800]  want to grow a million plants and if you want to grow a million plants of
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:09.080]  anything you need to really we really need to the chat is hilarious yeah we
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.800]  need to just kind of like think about if you're operating at scale what does that
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:20.080]  even mean and what do you do to protect your bets on growing a hundred or a
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:27.510]  thousand or a million of anything right right excellent I got you gotta love the
[01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:32.230]  chat today the chat's been that's hilarious man yeah that's killing me
[01:31:32.230 --> 01:31:37.310]  it's killer being like oh man a lot of these people I think I love what like
[01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:44.830]  with any topic 50% of the chat hates Joe Rogan and 50% loves them so yeah I mean
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.590]  that's how I learned about bill burr and you know and acronyms for things that
[01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:54.630]  I'm not gonna say right now but yeah whatever all right one thing out one
[01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:58.630]  thing I'll say to those guys in the chat is I have a lot of friends that
[01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:04.190]  I've grown up with and they depend their family depends on cannabis legal or
[01:32:04.190 --> 01:32:09.830]  traditional and this has been detrimental to them so don't take away
[01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:14.510]  from the hard work that they're doing the risks that are taking trying to say
[01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:22.590]  that you know papers aren't important or having clean plants is important from
[01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:27.030]  day one of growing I've never heard anybody say I don't care about getting
[01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:35.790]  dirty plants yeah go talk to someone who grows potatoes or you know alfalfa or
[01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:41.950]  kale or literally any farmer any proper agriculture person who they get that
[01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:45.750]  whole grow plant good shit right like talk to someone about working with these
[01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:49.830]  plant production systems and you're like hey would it would you be okay if just
[01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:54.870]  every once in a while you lost a quarter of it not right yeah and demand
[01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:59.510]  from from nurseries demand papers they're selling you something they're
[01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:04.230]  telling you that they're selling a good genetic that's clean or at least is
[01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:08.790]  supposed to be clean that's the expectation so if the consumer or farmer
[01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:13.590]  demand changes right and and these nurseries are held to a higher standard
[01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:21.270]  the overall industry will change that's capitalism yeah like again so again
[01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:25.790]  history let's go back remember when THC percentages first came out James and
[01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:31.950]  Justin when did that really start happening in the industry 2000 in what
[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:39.990]  for when the dispensaries in California start having the chart yeah I would say
[01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:44.830]  by 2008 it was something that we there was only a handful of people doing it
[01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:50.350]  you know a halen back in the day in 2012 was a lint was pretty much the only
[01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:55.830]  place you can go and that was a program run through UC Davis yeah and Steve
[01:33:55.830 --> 01:34:00.430]  helped us do a lot of testing so steep Hill was a halen turned into steep Hill
[01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:05.010]  okay that's where Steve Hill came from was Halen labs which was run by UC
[01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:08.830]  Davis which was pretty awesome back in the day I thought it was mind-blowing
[01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:13.330]  and then they were like oh and now you can test terpenes it's like big big game
[01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:18.070]  changers but yeah I remember what happened and people were like well is it
[01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:22.350]  really 24 or did you just over dry it what's your water content right like oh
[01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:26.630]  that was huge there was this pushback about what the fuck does even THC
[01:34:26.630 --> 01:34:34.950]  percentage mean you know there still is yeah totally well yeah guys I really

[01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:09.590]  sometimes when I do math when I'm on a conference call like this I look very
[01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:15.750]  upset and I'm just probably writing 3 plus 8 equals 11 sometimes if I'm lucky
[01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:20.190]  and I get it right right so yeah so people like this is glaring down but you
[01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:24.030]  know I'm here to also you know this is you know James said that was the topic
[01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:32.550]  of this it was he's like I need a six-month budget on something and I'm
[01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:39.270]  math around on paper and it was but I don't know my point good times good
