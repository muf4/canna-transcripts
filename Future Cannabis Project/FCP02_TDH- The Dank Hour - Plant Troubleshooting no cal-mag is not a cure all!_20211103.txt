Hey everybody! A minute or two early. The room's gonna be setting up shortly.
But I want to let you know we have some awesome stuff. I haven't posted them up yet.
But we have some awesome stuff coming up so keep your eye out and make sure to
follow all the videos and stuff that I have scheduled coming up. We've got some
special guests coming in and of course the regular great stuff. I hope you guys
liked the Canada Book Club yesterday. Should be a fun show again today and
without any further ado we'll get started and get things rolling.
And let's make sure we have...
Pretty good. Just getting this whole shebangling ready to go. Joining the
conversation right now.
There we go. All right how are we hearing me over in Future Cannabis Project? Can
you hear me loud and clear guys? Can you mind talking for me a little bit?
Hello? One more time for me. Testing. Testing one two three. Am I coming through?
Houston do you read? The purple flowers smell pink. All right we are good to go
and everything is looking nice and sharp. I gotta edit this up a little bit for
the frame. Set it a little bit cleaner and then hopefully everybody is doing well.
Thank You James, Ray Ray, Jay North, Loyalty Cannabis, everybody. Travis
everybody going on there. It's always a pleasure to have you guys on board with
us over at Future Cannabis Project as well as all of our amazing moderators on
this stage. Of course we have a little bit of a fun one for you today and
probably a little bit more of a casual chat because we're gonna be talking about
diagnosing plants and plant troubleshooting. No CalMag is not a cure
all and I really just wanted to put that out there as almost a joke and a push
because I really do think that too often newer growers are told to like
throw this or that at it and I think there's better ways of going out
diagnosing plants. So we have an amazing panel of experts here to discuss this
very fact. We're gonna get into that right now and if we could just go
through our panel real quick and everybody introduce themselves starting
from Jameson, Damian, Corey, Josh and Dr. Kan.
Hello everyone my name is Jameson Walborn. I have been touching the plant since 2006.
I've been in the legal industry since 2016. I've overseen a little over 50,000
square foot feet of cultivation space be built out and just shy of 20,000 square
feet of extraction space. Currently doing some consulting work both here and in
the US and super excited to be here. Cool thanks. Sorry guys. I'm Damian. I am a
compliance inspector for the Zagame Anishinaabe Cannabis Board. I've been
working with the plant since spring of 2001 give or take. Yeah everybody on the
panel is a good friend of mine and yeah Corey's next. I need to unmute on that
side there we go. Sorry about that. Good evening my name is Corey. I'm a
principal managing partner for Resonate Cannabis Incorporated up here in
Canada. We do large-scale cultivation. I've been involved with the plant and
creating medicine for about 17 years now. Just about to finish my horticulture
diploma finally writing my final project as we speak and I am super excited for
this conversation. We're simulcasting live on Resonate Radio. It's wonderful to
see you London and everybody up here. I can't wait. I am complete.
Hi everybody this is Dr. Anna Schwab and I have a background and education in
cellular and molecular biology. I have a master's degree in plant population
genetics. My PhD was specifically looking at population genetics and variation in
cannabis and I currently am in New Jersey working with an aquaponics
company. Growing hemp at the moment but we will be branching out when we get
New Jersey start giving out licenses we will be branching out into the higher
THC plants and I also teach modern cannabis science at the University of
Boulder in Colorado or University of Colorado in Boulder. I'm complete.
Josh did you want to have a quick a little I'm sorry I didn't notice that
you were in PTR I kind of screwed that up there a little bit. Do you want to go
ahead and introduce yourself? Not a problem. Hey everyone I'm Josh Burke. I'm a grower for 15
years breeder researcher. I've worked in the industry in research and development.
Did you go out for any? Yeah. You caught out a little bit there Josh you want to
try again. You were research and development. We'll give you a couple
minutes to come back. I know you're busy and it got the little ones running around
so we won't rush too much. Jason how are you doing? Do you want to have a quick
introduction for yourself? Absolutely I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.
Appreciate you inviting me up and to join the crew tonight. Yeah I'm Jason
Gideon also known as Hota Herb on Instagram. I'm a home cultivator and I
love talking about more cowbell. I'm excited to talk about it tonight. Well
really I mean I know I put cowmeg in the title and it was really just kind of a
poke I'm not gonna lie. I really want to focus this kind of conversation on what
what exactly how do we identify a plant as becoming sick or sick or imbalanced
and how do we diagnose those issues and go about correcting them. I think
there is a methodology and thought process that is gained over a certain
amount of time that isn't you know as easy to learn. It's not something that
you can just be just read a lot in a book. There's a lot of learning and
waiting and kind of back and forth and taking the time with the plant. I
thought it would be a great opportunity to like talk about that specific
progress and I thought it'd be funny to throw the cowmeg reference out there
because we all know that one too many times there's been a suggestion to use
cowmeg where it might not be necessary. That being said there are a
lot of great uses of cowmeg. I don't want this to necessarily be like a cowmeg
attack or cowmeg discussion but more about plant diagnosis and poking fun a
little bit at all of our all the situational humor in our lives. So if I
could get rolling and get started I'm gonna hop over to you Jameson. What are
kind of the first things that you see happen in the plant like actually I got
a better way to start. Dr. Anubis I got a great question for you and I thought of
this and of course I thought of it it's a question. So when you have plant with
different mutations often we have plant with an extra branch or a leaf mutation
or perhaps variegation or a fascination. These various different
types of mutation are often considered problematic, called unnecessarily
sometimes. I mean we look at some genetics that have come up that are
amazing that have things like variegation. Can you talk a little bit
about like what mutations would be considered detrimental to the plant and
and are all mutations considered to be a plant issue? Yeah that's a great question.
So I can tell you a hundred percent of the time it's not a polyploid. That's
thing number one. I know there's a couple of different scenarios where
people consistently say oh it's a polyploid. It's a polyploid. That would be
world phylotaxy and world phylotaxy just means there's more than the normal
number which is two branches coming off one node. So if you have three or four
it's called world phylotaxy. It's nothing to worry about. You might have more dense
canopy, leaf, leaves and things like that. So I feel like all that would take is
just some careful removal of some of the extra growth but it shouldn't
necessarily affect the flower once it gets there. You might even be able to
actually use that to your advantage to have more apical growth if you top it
and you know use some training and things like that. Then there's variegation
which a lot of people just look at variegation and go oh my god it's
tobacco mosaic virus. Almost a hundred percent of the time it's not going to be
tobacco mosaic virus. It doesn't infect cannabis very easily and not like it
does with the members of the Solanaceae family, the tomato potato family
where it's very contagious and can cause a lot of problems. There are some other
big viruses that do infect cannabis and you won't just notice variegation in a
plant though. You'll also notice like the plant just looks sick and weak. It'll
stunt its growth. It just won't look as robust as your other plants and in
that case you know you definitely want to not grow that plant out for you know
to keep your room clean and you'd want to dispose of that plant accordingly as
though it is infected with a virus. There's other leaf mutations that cause a problem.
If the plant looks weird I would say just let it go see what happens. There's some
leaf mutations that just affect the leaves but some of these mutations also
lead to weird growth. Maybe growing out something that has a mutation that you're not
familiar with or that you're not trying to cultivate. Maybe it wouldn't be the
best use of your time and resources to grow that plant out because it's likely
that that plant may not be you know you might not get the yield or the phenotype
that you're looking for in your end product. And then satiation is a really
interesting one. We've seen that a lot popping up. Also not a polyploid.
Satiation is a cresting. It's a local mutation and leads to an abnormal
growth pattern. You can see that maybe in the flattening of a stem or most
commonly you're going to see that in the cresting of the flower. So you'll see
kind of it'll be like a line of flowers and they'll be really densely packed.
Those aren't necessarily bad but they are so densely packed that it's not
going to be a very good quality flower and you run the risk of you know getting
mold and stuff in those densely packed flowers. I would suggest just cutting
those off when you see them so that you're not wasting time growing out this
weirdo mutation. It's cool looking if you want to grow it out. Sure go ahead if
you've got the you know resources to do so but it's not you're it's not going to
end up with something that you would want. And then I had one final. What was my
other thing? Oh yeah there's some other bug mutations like fox tailing and
things like that but again these weirdo flower mutations are maybe not something
that you want to spend time on if that's not specifically what you're looking for.
So that's my spiel on mutation. Awesome so I mean that's my biggest concern right?
Like there's a lot of potential out there for different plants to have a
great opportunity to succeed and oftentimes there's this panic culling.
You know like oh my god this plant has you know derogation is probably one of
the most common ones that I see that is that is that is a rush that is rushed out
and going oh no there's a mutation it's probably some sort of virus or something
like that and like it's it's not and it's actually could you could lose a lot
of amazing potential there that's kind of the beauty of cannabis right? So I
mean what would we know like I've grown polypilloid that you guys could actually
check the YouTube there I did I'm not sorry oh my god Anna oh my you did you
hear me what I said oh my gosh oh I almost like swallowed my tongue oh no
yeah no so I I did grow out a face it'd plant that had that shape mutation to it
and it was so hard not simple I like I lost it but the rest of the plant
actually did good so you could have cut off that and had it as a top thing and
it branched out really really nicely so it doesn't completely lose it but it is
it was a very interesting thing and you guys can actually check that out I have
side-by-side of that growing with another plant in my YouTube which is
very neat but then I wanted to jump over so what is like is there a specific
because I know like a lot of plants if they're stressful show three-pronged
leaves or or a lot less leaves leaflets on their leaves is there a sign that
it's more of that you should do some digging that it's not just a mutation is
there specifically maybe it's like single leaflet things or something like
that that could not be a mutation the warning signs to move away is there
something that kind of barriers that you know I I'm not really sure I just we
just finished a grow where he had a whole bunch of really weird growth
patterns and I am not sure if it we had some issues you know we're trying to
iron out all the wrinkles and get our aquaponic system kind of up to you know
all iron down you know nailed down and and and and working well and so we've
had some issues so at certain points in the grow our plants were stressed and so
we have seen some abnormal growth and it was like it was weird because we grow in
like depth hoop houses and so they're not sealed and it was weird like we had
probably 60 plants that we were working on and like three of them got a fit just
three and they were like full-on just being attacked like covered it was
disgusting but they didn't attack any of the other plants and those plants of
course had some issues so you know that can be it that can insects can be a
source of mutation like if if the plants reacting it can cause mutations in the
plant like satiation or foxtailing or or things like that so if you are seeing
something weird going on in your plant in terms of abnormal you know you it's
throwing out one leaf one leaflet instead of that you know the palmate
leaves that would would have normally like five to nine or eleven leaves or
something like that and your buds start to stack that can be an indication that
there's something going on with your plant outside of outside of what its
natural genetics are it can be a pest issue or a viral issue or something like
that so I guess it would just be a matter of definitely keeping an eye on
it and trying to figure out why is my plant growing strangely because yeah it
could be it could be some sort of deficiency or a predator or herbivore or
something that's leading to something your plants reacting to it and it's
getting weird so yeah yeah these things can lead to a weird phenotype I guess so
we've like I I really thought this was a great way to kind of set this stage
because we've like I mentioned I think there's a lot of potential in cannabis
over there and some of these unique variants that might be found through
mutation and that's just a repeat of the code created actually could you go into
if you got a I know you're there thank you actually for joining us on stage
welcome tonight and I appreciate you being here say hello to everybody out
there and my first question for you today is like what exactly if you could
explain what causes a mutation so that we kind of a quick explanation that so
we can explain kind of what what that is and why it's not necessarily bad and
then from there in aeroponics because you're working in an aeroponics facility
what were what are the first noticeable signs of plant nutrition deficiency that
you see most common and when troubleshooting in your facility yeah
hey guys thanks for having me so a mutation is just going to be a change in
the genetic code so something is actually causing the genetics of that
plant to kind of shift which can cause all sorts of cascading effects as far as
different growth patterns and the overall genetic structure is now you
know altered so you can get plants that grow abnormally I think in you know in
my opinion that it takes definitely several generations to really see that I
mean obviously you have to choose that plant as a mother and then start
cloning off of that but for that's what kind of my definition is and super
interesting to kind of come across those different genetics and phenotypes I
personally haven't come across a lot but always curious to see like different
examples of it but as far as growing in our aeroponics and nutrient deficiencies
I've actually been doing a deep dive into this recently because obviously you
want to keep your nutrition dialed in but with our system I can actually see
how my plants are eating now while I don't know what components of that
reservoir they're eating I can see kind of their uptake and as far as
deficiencies I think it's important to and I don't know if you guys already
went into it but mobile and non mobile or immobile really that's telling of
what that plants kind of communicating to you so I see a lot of cow mag for
sure but it's also really important to think about your micronutrients so you
know nitrogen conversion pathways and you got to have all your micronutrients
to actually have that plant be able to convert that energy into or that that
fertilizer that you're feeding them you know it's got to have all of its
components so I would say cow mag for sure because I know you know magnesium
is kind of an antagonistic towards other positively charged ions or cat
ions but sometimes you can see phosphorus for sure and I would say when
we transplant our plants into flower they always seem to kind of go into a
little bit of transplant shock but they really start to show that they're
phosphorus at that stage but luckily they grow out of it so what exactly does
that look I think it's really interesting with aeroponics because it's
so quick the reaction to the plant when you change nutrients or do those
transplants and stuff like that but then their bounce back is so fast what does
that look like in time relevance to other mediums that you've experienced in
the past actually so really what we what we notice as soon as those plants that
are transplanted start pushing roots they just take off so you will see you
know kind of that phosphorus so the stems get a little bit purple I do think
there's a correlation to light intensity sometimes with that but you'll see them
really bounce back you know usually you can tell they'll bounce back by like day
three because they'll really start pushing a lot of new growth that's a
really really quick turnaround time so we're gonna bounce over to the other
side of the other side of the spectrum here I'm gonna ask David Jamison a
question as he is more of like the bed-living soil grower yeah it's a lot
more of a slow approach you can't just rush around and change stuff in that
type of business it does a lot of effect so how do you go about diagnosing an
issue as an actual problem so you just see you see something wrong with the
plant maybe a increase in yellowing or some burning or something's wrong what's
the first kind of step process that goes on in your mind when you're working
in your kind of an organic system so if I'm running a phenol hunt in living beds
and I see one plant yellowing or struggling in a certain way typically
I'm looking to see if that plants that specific phenotype doesn't like the
moisture levels in the soil or the you know just just being a hungry plant and
so I'm not able and my experience doesn't lie in hydroponic growing where
I'm measuring around often and it really you know I I have just the utmost
respect for growers like Ashley because you know you're really you're you're if
you're not putting it there the plant can't take it up whereas I'm growing in
and and and and typically sifting in living beds so if I see something that
is difficult to grow I you know the likelihood of me moving that on to the
next chapter selection is fairly low but as far as addressing a problem you know
I potentially won't address a problem if I've got you know 95 to 9% of my bed
completely happy and some plants are struggling I might just leave them in
living soil I think that you know you you really have to watch it and think
ahead and plan your your move 7 to 14 days ahead so you're really playing
catch-up at any point where you you've identified a problem and that needs to
be addressed immediately there are guys that will put immediately available you
know potentially salt based nutrients into their soil and you know to cause a
course correction immediately and you know sort of hope that the natural soil
food web takes care of you know flushing those salts out and I think for the most
part dependent on you know the severity of what you're doing you know that's
very possible so it's it's different in living soil you know living soil is much
more letting you know you you do all your homework ahead of time where you
build your soil and then you more or less on cruise control whereas you know
what Ashley's doing is driving you know the race car and making every part of
that move so you know it's just a whole different animal I love that point I
think that that was exactly where I wanted to hit at is that in the organic
system and organic methodology what you doing these big beds is unless it's a
critical problem that's spreading through the whole bed the last thing you
ever actually want to do is is something right you want to let the processes the
what all the work and all the time that you prep naturally take over and allow
that system to correct itself right because the plant in the medium hat
depending on where it's at have the ability to break sit down and continue
forward now Jason if you're available I know you're on a completely different
side of the spectrum making a lot of your own nutrients and specializing in
Korean natural farming and your plants have a very brilliant color to them most
of the time and they're very unique so I would love to know how you go about and
and and what your thought process is when you start seeing deficiencies and
and and judging or course correcting a plant in in you know naturally the
flowering periods yeah no absolutely I think you know similar to what Jamison
was saying in the Korean natural farming school we try to focus on the
plant as it's moving through its life cycles and we try to preload the
nutrients that the plants will need at that juncture so when you're moving into
that transition stage similar to what Ashley was saying earlier where they see
that phosphorus deficiency during transition as part of the Korean natural
farming process we tend to load phosphorus modify and go from a
nitrogen-based mixture to a phosphorus based mixture during that transition
period to help the plant get over that hump and move towards that now from a
deficiency standpoint we will diagnose the plant based on similar tools looking
for you know a loss of color indications of spotting either in variation variable
variable spots within the leaves or along the ridges which might indicate
different types of deficiencies and using a foliar approach with one of the
fermented nutrients to try to you know provide the plant what it needs but I
think in many cases again similar to what Jamison was saying because of the
way that these natural approaches work by the time you see that deficiency that
happened probably weeks ago or at least days ago right the the plant is making
millions and millions and millions of decisions every second on where to put
nutrients into the plant and back again to what Ashley was saying whether those
nutrients are mobile or not mobile and then whether those nutrients are
available to it in the soil will determine whether those nutrients in
some cases the plant will solve for itself so that's in my in my garden
that's usually how I'm approaching it is tending to work that root drench
approach for the proper stage of life and then if I'm seeing a specific type
of deficiency I'll try to approach it and deal with it either by adding to
that root drench or by if it's something that seems to be needs to be
addressed immediately then it's something I'll probably add into a
foliar and use a foliar spray which would be a much faster uptake by the
plant interesting now I've always I've always loved the wait-and-see approach
and I'm trying to like do that a little bit better now in my life
rush rush and and I'm trying to slow it down a little bit like I use natural
organic natural again but I use pest control predator pest for pest control
and then you know there's always a population learning to navigate kind of
how to judge your mind because your initial task when you see a pest or a
problem or an issue in your plants is to correct it and and and I think human
nature is to really you know fix things in and put things into our ideal image
and there's this beautiful kind of thing that cannabis a does no matter what
system you're in because it still takes time to for things to happen in to take
effect and that the one of the most important things to learn is like
patience with these things so I wanted to jump over to Josh when you see a
plant issue do you have a checklist that you would go through in order of
things like a write-off that hey yeah so I actually do have a checklist that I
have copied from some magazine back in the day that I had used and basically
just kind of run through you know looking at the plant when you you know
notice you have that issue initially and see where the issue is and I mean
that most people have already kind of touched on different points like mobile
and mobile nutrients and things like that but you're you know looking at the
new growth or if it's you know something in the old growth I can really kind of
give you an idea as to you know what kind of issues you might be looking at a
lot of the time I mean if you're tracking your grow and you you know
you're writing down you know the you know what you're feeding the plant if
you're you know in a synthetic based or salt based system you know looking back
you can generally see you know like okay something happened here and this is
what's going on you know sometimes you'll have like one plant that is you
know that one off which you know as others have mentioned sometimes up plant
you know if it's if you're doing kind of a monocrop and have a bunch of them that
you know you can flush it out and you know reset that pot and then kind of
read like you know go back to it but if it's you know problem then you don't
necessarily you know need to keep it but if it's one of your you know only few or
like you know up here in Canada you can only have four then you go through those
lists and see what things could you know help with that
thank you Josh awesome answer I hope you're having fun with all the kiddos
running around minute over there in the other garden sorry no you got to go
around for it give me a second you're just gonna have to go around her way I
got some parsley sorry everybody I've got my wife needs some green onion and
it's not in the greenhouse it's just outside the greenhouse which means you
have to walk a little bit further and yeah it's a little bit of a thing but
anyways as we jump back into it and I get it back on the track I'd love to
hop over to Corey and ask you if there was a recent issue that you had and how
what was your process of diagnosing and then how and what was the issue and then
how did you fix it thanks London I mean not to repeat a bunch of stuff in here
but pretty much you know same kind of methodology that we're looking at here
I think one of the things that I'd like to touch on that I kind of you know when
I really really get stumped is trying to you know one of the things that was
introduced to me something called Mulder's chart it's a chart that
represents all the essential plant elements and how they how they interact
with each other and so I use that in combination with kind of making sure
that my nutrient element ratios are pretty much the same or that need to be
you know not the same as far as the numbers are concerned but just as same
as fine as far as the synergistic relationships of Mulder's chart and
making sure that you know everything is kind of working with that relationship
together so you know sometimes if you put a little bit too much calm egg in
there for example when you're going to try and correct an issue you're actually
gonna lock out potassium and cause a whole bunch of other things so I just
kind of wanted to touch on that that was really interesting by the title of the
room of course is you know sometimes when you go on these things to try and
fix things you might go in a direction that's going to cause a little bit more
trouble so as far as the large scale is concerned you know depending on the
operation and what you know kind of flexibility that we have or what we're
trying to do and achieve our goals and we're looking at you know again kind of
going at the root zone and attacking that if we can right away or you know
thank goodness in Canada they've opened up our our foliar feeding limitations so
we can you know go at it a little bit differently but you know I really do
it's it's very interesting listening you know Jameson and Ashley and kind of you
know really highlighting how it's it's a really a different focus when you have
that bed that's there then versus going the hydroponic way you know I've been
lucky to kind of go through both and I think it's really good to just kind of
sit back and understand what formula you're doing you know a lot of us who
come from you know of course the background of doing this from home for
so many years some of those you know methods aren't going to be the same or
kind of the same troubleshooting methods will not be the same that you can use in
that large scale so I like to go a little bit more technical when I'm in
that large scale really take a look you know again that Mulder's chart is I just
I absolutely love that little dome and trying to understand you know maybe
through the troubleshooting process I might be over correcting and causing
more problems than I want to so I think that's kind of the things that I like to
highlight in my troubleshooting because everything else is pretty much pretty
much been said but yeah that Mulder charts something that I can really kind
of step back take a deep breath you know take a look at the irrigation data and
environment data and really understand what's happening in that moment and
attack the plant at the you know method that is the best for that situation I'm
complete awesome great answer Cory as always and we appreciate having you on
stage and thank you resident radio for being around we appreciate today Damon
we had a talk earlier today it's always fun chatting with you and I could spend
hours doing it we could probably waste half of our day just shooting the shit
so do you have like an example of a recent plant issue that you've seen and
how and what exactly you saw how you identified it how you went about fixing it
yeah like October or not October May I had three plants that were just ravaged
normally because it's like Josh said you know somebody like us we're not gonna
waste our time trying to fix it right like way back in the day what I would do
is I would use RO water and chelate to flush the plant and then start over like
because I'm a salt guy my issue isn't really deficiency my issue is the
inverse and it's like the abundance right so I had three plants that were
really really sick assumably had hops latent and the reason why we went with
that is because it was something that was supposed to be 18% and it was coming
out at 10 and the plant just looked ravaged we also figured it had tobacco
mosaic virus now tobacco mosaic virus you can diagnose a lot easier there are
kits out there you know but right now there's nothing on the market available
to you know unless you're gonna go the genetic route and use somebody like Anna
to like say yes that plant has hops so essentially what I did is like normally
I would just throw this plant away instead we kind of somehow stumbled upon
a heat conditioning response with the cell by using trace elements and that's
really all I can say right there's a couple other things that we did again
with a foiler spray to fix it for the four plant growers your easiest bet is
is when you start seeing abundance flush it flush your soil right let get rid of
all the necrotic plant material and then just start over in deficiencies it's
like you can just go to the internet and if a plant like if a snake plant is low
in nitrogen it's gonna look the same as a cannabis plant like that's pretty much
standard across the board so you know you can use Google to like type in
what's wrong with my plant and there's gonna be a ton of pictures right like
there's even a really nice cannabis information thing that's been around for
about a decade that it'll tell you you know these spots in this location doing
this that's phosphorus burn right or you know this green with yellow that's
you're starting to get into a nitrogen deficiency so it's kind of easy just
look on the internet you can figure it out from there but for guys like James
and Josh me when we fuck up and it's sometimes it's just easier to like call
that plant and make sure you're mixing your nutrients properly so I'm David
awesome and always a pleasure go ahead ash so just to clarify for anybody who's
kind of curious about mobile versus immobile nutrients so the way I like to
describe it to my growers is your mobile nutrients now most of them are usually
the amounts that the plant requires the most for physiological function so if
they are deficient in that they will actually translocate that that nutrient
from their oldest growth to the newest most developing leaves so you'll see
those deficiencies usually on the lower leaves with your immobile what that
means is that plant can't move that nutrient around so you will see the
deficiencies usually in the new growth so when you're trying to see if you've
got a deficiency take a look at where you're actually seeing it and then
there's a lot of good references for what are all your mobile versus in a
mobile nutrients so just wanted to clarify that for those of you that were
unaware I think of course you mentioned it as well as the pH chart it's super
important for cannabis and again I think Damon you mentioned as well
reliefs what's the pH of the medium and the pH of the water and then what have I
changed do you see a lot of pH issues naturally in organic you don't see it so
much but do does anybody else have the same kind of consensus is like before
you do anything or before you add anything to the product to your medium
or to the plant it's it's check everything else right no I completely
agree and I think like one of the other things that I caution people as well is
to only change one thing don't change a bunch of things I think it's it's
especially for home growers and and smaller growers we see something's wrong
with that plant and we freak out and so we try you know we quickly Google that
and we find six or seven different things and we get some advice from our
buddy and so we try five or six different things at the same time and we
just the temperature and I play with the humidity and I'm gonna go ahead and play
with my pH and I'll throw in a little bit more of this product because I heard
somebody say it was great maybe throw some in an additional biology in there
and unfortunately you may fix the problem but you won't know what you did
to fix it so I think it's really important to as you said be patient take
the time when you're diagnosing stuff and then do just one thing see how the
plant reacts and then do something else if you make too many changes at the same
time you won't know what's working and you won't know what's not working so
that's that's my advice there I like I really want to bring this topic up
because that's a really great point Jason because there is like in a lot of
places like in Massachusetts you have the home grow program in Canada we have
that you can get a CNPR license which is like your home medical grow license but
you but everybody's depending on their areas is allowed to grow for plants and
you know seeds are expensive and there's some beautiful genetic and plants out
there so you really when you're home growing and you only have your floor you
want everything to work out as best as possible so often this comes into issue
and I think environment can play a lot more of a role than people often think
and that there's actually the plants availability to take up nutrient
changes often Canada we see often going into winter when people are setting up
their indoor grows specifically when they have it in in their basements in
Canada or on the lower part of the suite or in any cold region places is that the
floor is very very cold and can actually cool the medium to an extreme degree go
ahead Jason. Yep I was gonna agree with you because that's I mean I'm growing in
my basement Massachusetts right and we're not quite as cold as our friends
up north and in in Canada but we get it gets really cold here too and you have
to get the pots off the bottom you have to get them off the cement that that
cold is going to translate right in there you also get different amounts of
humidity at different times of the year the colder it gets the less humidity you
have you may have to add heat if you add heat then you're gonna lose humidity so
you have to adjust the humidity to accommodate the additional heat that you
just added because your basement is now dropping below the temperatures and I
think you're right that's another area that if you're not within those ranges
once you start dropping below 75 degrees and especially below 70 degrees you're
gonna see deficiencies in your plants that are specifically because the
temperatures and the environment are not right for that plant to be able to take
up the nutrients and take advantage of everything else. Thank you Jason I appreciate that
yeah there's this it's very common in the floor in ducks a lot would you have
any special tricks that you use you know what I I have the funniest little thing
so I got like that the small I think they're like the 10-inch saucers that
you would regularly have to just put your pots in I just flip them upside
down and burn holes in the sides over there flow in between them and just
having that one inch off of that ground is and the available airflow helps a lot
is that some do you have any little tricks? Yeah yeah I definitely have some
of those plastic airlift trays that sit nicely inside the big saucers so that
you can put your 8 gallon pots or 12 gallon pots up on the mean 16s will fit
on those so just those little plastic trays that give you that inch or two up
of a lift is a good way and then all my you know in my veg tents I've actually
just built myself some benches some rolling two by four benches that I put
some drain trays on and I put the plants in that and then they're you know they're
they're like a foot off the ground so they're definitely not getting getting
that cold temperature I you know and in the summer I try to actually do the
opposite which is actually will put them down on the ground purposely
because the cement on the floor tends to be a little bit nice and cool in the
summertime so that's another way that you can take advantage of the environment
going the opposite way in the summer
truly genius and a great hack for the home grower. Roy, in general I think you
can use these in different maybe not in a commercial scale but these factors can
play in mind when you're doing the kind of large-scale especially like in a
place like Canada. Jameson for example lives in the prairies and I'll tell you
what it is fucking dry as fuck out there and and BC where it is humid and wet all
the time so I imagine that having a humidity leveled out a lot easier like
that humidity is always a challenge for you in this type of a space what are
kind of the first sign that you see that oh my gosh maybe I need to really
start working on my humidity. Maybe I got you a giant dab. Do any of the other
speakers want to talk on? So too much humidity it kind of depends on where
that plant is at in its stage but you know too much humidity what happens is
those plants don't have to work hard to pull water through their roots because
they're being satisfied by the high humidity in the room so they get kind of
you know complacent with having to uptake any water so they're naturally
going to you know. Humidity in flowers obviously a little bit different you can
see that mostly in the bud structure you can get seed contamination but you know
as a clone they just will not push roots because they don't need to and the
leaves can get you know definitely necrotic pretty quickly but you know as
far as moms if you don't keep those nice and thin humidity I see a lot of an
issue in the under care you know the under canopy so you want to make sure
that you're really cleaning out those leaves because they'll get necrotic
pretty quickly and then kind of in veg kind of the same thing like with with
mothers you want to just make sure that you're keeping everything cleaned up and
trimmed up so that you don't have any plants that are touching leaves that can
can grow contamination or anything like that so kind of depends on the stage but
I think you know the plants don't have to work as hard to translocate that
water so you can see kind of some deficiencies with high humidity. I think
on the other end of the spectrum then you get when you get below 40% humidity
regardless of your environment it starts to put pressure on the stomata and it
makes it more difficult for the plant to be able to breathe and exchange oxygen
and other things for the stomata so you do need to make sure that you don't let
your humidity drop too low because that does also start to have negative effects
on the plants as well. So I got a good follow-up for you here Ashley when it
comes to the high humidity thing because I mean you're naturally gonna
run into that in your in your your stylite facility of course seroponics.
When you are concerned about bud rot is there a simple test or or methodology to
do? One thing that I've done before and then I find is really really handy is if
you go through and like pull on some of those tighter fan that are in the buds
and if they come out just like no problem like it completely separates out
that's a really good sign that there's some mold in there and that you need to
do some further inspection. Are there any little tricks and things that you do
that might? Sorry I didn't know that was for me.
So look for contamination you know with a large-scale room you kind of have to
cut your losses with certain things and bud rot is definitely one of them. You
want to just actually you know what I always recommend with trying to dispose
of any contamination is take like a plastic bag with you drape it over as
smoothly as you can so you don't kind of spread any more spores and then cut that
branch off and or even you know sometimes entire plants but you know
sacrifice that one so it doesn't spread but you're gonna have to with bud rot
just kind of cut that out and move on. I'm not sure that you know the
efficiency of different bud washes or but something like bud rot that actual
tissue internally is already rotten so there's nothing really to recover that's
going to be favorable so you definitely have to cut your losses with that one
unfortunately. Awesome well I'm going to open up the stage a little bit we'll
come up and ask some questions yeah and I agree like bud rots done it's over
runaway in a commercial facility but I think if you're in smaller zone like for
me it's you wrap that bet you wrap it up with the bag yeah you tight it right
really tight and you put a you cut it off at least two to three inches below
any sort of infection and stuff like that you can save some plant as long as
you don't let those mold or spread. I think getting into the specifics of how
we how we deal with each issue is for another episode. Chase welcome to this
stage as always as one of the you know you do the breeders table here on the
Mondays it's always awesome to see you. I wanted to ask you in your kind of time
spent is there a recent issue that you ran into and how did you identify that
recent issue and that then what did you do to fix that issue with your
plants or when you're consulting? For me it's really contingent I kind of have
my set protocols that I do in commercial settings just out of convenience of
being able to set stuff up but on the consulting side usually the first thing
that I'll do is start at the basic beginnings obviously environmentals are
important and obviously most growers even at the commercial setting a lot of
them don't even know about things like vapor pressure deficit so it's really
getting back to the basics trying to figure out what their waters like asking
the right questions and most of the time it boils down to cleanliness of the crow
overall and just those basic fundamentals really will tell you a lot
if you see areas that are accumulating dirt debris and dust if you're using a
medium or some type of a substrate on the floor you can tell that you know
they're not sweeping the way that they should so with that most of the time
you'll see commercial operations where a lot of times people are taking an
existing building and they'll retrofit it to be able to grow cannabis which
inherently that building wasn't designed for or growing cannabis in it you can
convert a lot of things over but I always like you know if possible to
start with a blank slate so just for me I think that that's the the neat thing
when it comes to cannabis is trying to make an environment conducive to a grow
whenever that's effectively was purpose for that space so cleanliness is a
really big thing quality of water just washing things on a regular basis
people don't understand that you can't just keep a pair of scissors forever and
use those time in and time out I try to teach people that if they need to buy
like an exacto knife sometimes that you can just get those little cheap razor
blade inserts and you can just replace those and that's more cost-effective
than buying pairs of scissors all the time because I have seen operations at
the commercial level that they've transmitted pathogens because of not
cleaning their utensils which is actually a lot more common I thought was
really going on but since I've had opportunity to go into a state with a
fairly new cannabis program you kind of get to see a wide gamut of skill sets a
lot of people that are new to cannabis that are just trying to figure it out so
and also it also boils down to what kind of resources people have available are
people doing stuff from like a gorilla grow mentality or do they have all the
bells and whistles or they have automation just because I think that
even with full automation there's something that you lose whenever you get
to a certain number of plants and you don't have the ability to physically
interact with every one of those plants on your farm every single day but you
know that just boils down to the way that I look at the plant you know I know
that eventually we'll get to a point where there'll be massive combines
farming cannabis which will be neat just like other commodity crops but at the
same time I still like that personalization by being able to inspect
plants personally I do too I think there's something special about it
especially with a lot of these cultivars you can really bring them to the next
level by taking that extra time and effort and care and pushing them that far
I like I always say that if you have a plant even if it's got like a unique
mutation run it through and give it a couple rounds because even if it's okay
you might be able to tune it in to get it to that next level and you never know
what flight this could be there which is great so chase thank you very much for
joining us on stage and I have a zinger for our panel today
cheddar Bob coming through cheddar Bob and I'll put this up here can you ask the
panel about magnesium uptake when using LED is there a rapid uptake and why that
happens and also a better way to prepare that occurring that is a incredibly
complex question and I will throw it toward our panel of experts does anybody
want to jump into this one first don't hesitate otherwise I'm gonna yeah this
is Cory when you switch to LEDs generally what happens is you have a
more focused spectrum and so what's gonna happen when you have that targeted
spectrum is you should have an overall higher photosynthetic activity in the
plant so that's pretty much it basically from my understanding of it is yeah
you're just gonna see kind of a higher photosynthetic activity and yeah
definitely should add just a little bit more magnesium when you do if you are
making that switch and you're not used to it definitely recommend putting a
little bit more magnesium in your feed in general I am complete so one of the
challenges with that is if you're using something that's already a pre-mixed
nutrient right so you buy that bottle of nutrients and you dose it the mils per
gallon or mils per liter that they recommend and you feed that you know
sometimes plants have different metabolic rates and you know they want
to eat different things just in who they are as individual strains so you
really sometimes have a tough time being able to just add a little bit more here
or there with pre-mixed nutrients you can get supplements that are a little
bit more less you know less nutrients and a little bit more dialed in so what
I always recommend is if even if say you are trying to treat for something
you know foliar feeds are the proper ones that are chelated you know chelated
means it's going to be bioavailable for that plant and you know you can think of
a foliar application is the plants got this much surface area on its canopy and
if you can spray you know different micronutrients or macronutrients that
plant is in fact and if you verify that that's a deficiency you know you can
apply a foliar feed to this extensive surface area and they can get it to
their tissues a lot more rapidly they do make a lot of good you know pre bottled
mix and I know that's what a lot of home growers and people you know use so
sometimes I think if you if you have confirmed that you have a deficiency
sometimes foliar feeds are a little bit easier you're not messing with the
entire reservoir chemistry you know uptake a little bit more magnesium but
you throw something else off so look into if you if you're curious look into
you know you can google bioavailable foliar feeds and a lot of the time
they're going to be the better quality ones are going to be from usually like
large-scale farm ag companies so GH biotech is a great company that has
chelated bioavailable individual nutrients so sometimes you know you can
you can try a different method both foliar and you know changing the
nutrients that are in that res but foliar I think it's a great application
to get that plant those nutrients without really throwing the res chemistry off I
have good one to throw in with this that we forgot to mention as well and I
think it's important to know and I wonder how many of the panel have done
this before is reaching out to the breeder and asking them or doing a
little bit of research background research on the strain some plants can
do a lot more like like you mentioned there's a lot of difference in
cultivation of each plant there can be a varying degree of difference
including those and take a little bit of effort do you guys reach out to the
breeders ever to ask background questions or anything like that I can
speak to that real briefly I try to tell people that less is more when it comes
to cannabis in Oklahoma everything is limited to 10 pound batches so I tell
people that if you're going to grow a cultivar make sure that you hit 10
pounds of it or it's not cost-effective because you have to get a COA that costs
anywhere from two to four hundred dollars out there so that broken down
over ten pounds ends up being you know an extra twenty to forty dollars but
when you're only growing one pound and you have to get that compliance test you
know it does impact your ability to be profitable and you have to sell that
pound for more to be able to get that money that's the reason why a lot of
people can get black market product for less than what they can get in the
dispensary is because of that COA and that chain of custody and just like
humans yes we all can feed off of a 2500 or 2000 calorie diet and will sustain
life for all of us but at the same size or at the same time we're all different
weights we're all different sizes so you know really dialing in a recipe is
conducive to the cultivar and I tell people just to work cultivar multiple
times before they really figure it out because most of the time even with a
breeder that you have to grow that cultivar out multiple times before you
really figure it out especially if you're trying to you know hit markers on
the analytical side besides your markers that you look at from a visual and a and
a terpene standpoint awesome thank you chase that's a great point shorty
welcome to this stage it's always lovely hearing you speak I don't know if we get
to share space with you but welcome to this stage how are you doing this
evening and you have a question or a comment for our panel of experts this
evening and again I invite anybody to raise their hand and come up and come up
to stage and ask a question or make a comment also there future cannabis
project welcome to do the same thank you London yes um maybe this more than a
troubleshooting is much more of a type of I'm looking for a preventative
maintenance in regards to so tonight I've been working on my own my batch I
got I got 100 gallon buckets and that's where I'll be mixing my water to get my
pH level ready and it's got a pump on it so when I go into my bedroom or my
flower rooms that will be pressurized and I can and I can water my plants and
should note that this is living soil so I'm starting with living soil so I'm
just going to give a watering system to them all right now I'm wanting to go
back and it's time to give nutrients so I mix my say 35 gallons of water to my
nutrients recipe and that same system is now going to supply my nutrients this
day so I apply my nutrients and I want you to consider that when I just did
that if I don't drain all my lines and stuff that my first blast of my product
coming out of my hose and my watering will be that clean water because or that
pH water of 5.8 let's say was the first thing coming through until I got to my
nutrients blend maybe no big deal but I'm new and I wanted to track and
understand everything I'm doing to the plant let's say so no big deal I'm now
watering my nutrients my dark-colored nutrient water comes through I'm
watering my with my nutrients now and I'm done for the day I am concerned that
I need to make sure I get all that nutrients let's say backwashed so
tonight I was hooking up a water system water line to go back into my watering
system to back flush back to that hundred gallon tank until I get fresh
and then shut everything off and clean my area am I being too anal am I being
too worried about leaving these nutrients I think I'm worried that if I
go in the next day I want to give it water and also I'm going to be giving it
nutrients or maybe I should be leaving it in the line because it's going to
give me problems in the line did I ask the question in a way that someone might
be able to steer me if I'm over thinking it yeah no you're definitely not
overthinking it as clean as you can be is I mean cleanliness is next to
godliness you can't overthink cleaning depending on you know but what you just
walk through is a perfect scenario and if you don't know what happens to hoses
with nutrient water in them if they sit too long you will definitely start to
smell like sulfur sulfur so definitely definitely recommend you walking through
that protocol you just listed off because you're not going to you're not
harming anything by being thorough about how you're cleaning you're you're in the
right direction and continue being that anal about it it's only going to benefit
you thank you Ashley I would I would definitely take a note about it and
submit it in there but I do I do something similar so I run five gallon
tanks in the drain to waste system and naturally there's like this little bit
that's always left over at the end and there's always the stuff that's in the
line as well and and just to ensure that everything is good and on point what I
usually do is just like drain the hose into the into the tank until until I
know that the entire batch that is in the tank and in the hose is the same
consistency me doing but is there any is there anything else or you feel
complete as it were Geordie and again I appreciate it they ask the question today
no I feel complete I got that confidence that that was the right thing because I
mean there there is a concern isn't there about leaving that in the line and
stuff that it could it would it would not be good to reuse that hold nutrients
that can't sit idle very long like that am I correct absolutely correct yeah
thank you that's where other people were lead me and like I said I'm new so I
appreciate you guys I mean I have a desire to learn and I'm a quick learner
and but I'm still new thanks guys I'm over you got some nutrients I'm sorry
yeah some nutrients won't also won't stay in solution as well so they'll
start to separate and break out of the of the liquid so when they come through
the line they might the nutrients themselves may let me left in your lines
and you definitely want to be good at flushing those things out that's the
places where molds and bacterias and other things are gonna are gonna build
up over time as well that you need to keep an eye on so absolutely the right
direction Jody and on top of that it is a lot of work to to clean pipes out with
a pressure washer and stuff like that if you have a lot of lines and stuff we
used to have to do like our line but I've had to clean out a few lines and
it's good keep gross work and it can really screw up like all your entire
system depending on what you are like drip systems especially be a lot more
challenging when you have those nutrients because those salt water and stuff like that
but yeah I appreciate if there's anybody else in the audience that would like to
come up and say hello, or come up and say hi. Also out there in the future cannabis projects.
Hello Chris how are you?
Did anybody take down anything special for their fall harvest this year?
I'll ask the panel before we close out.
I'm about to take down my New England Rock Candy and my Dr. Lime F2.
So both all the plants in my flower tent are about to come down they're just about ready.
So I'm gonna be bringing those down and I did want to mention and I'm gonna give
myself a quick little shameless plug but we will be talking about foliar Thursday
night on my show so 6 p.m. Pacific sorry 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern we will be
getting into foliar with Nick from the Rude Belief so definitely if you're
interested in foliar and learning more about foliar we'll be talking all about that Thursday night.
Anybody else want to do some shout outs before we close?
Oh sure Jason those are fucking awesome I rewatched your episode that was your
background story and it was very very fun and quite in-depth I'd appreciate you
for putting that out there it's always fucking nerve-wracking doing that stuff
I always like interviewing but I don't like being interviewed.
And to do an hour and a half straight with with no breaks was also was a challenge as well so I appreciate it thank you.
My hat goes off to you Jason especially solo that's a challenge.
Anybody else in Dr. Animus? Cory do you have what do you have going on next week or this week in your world of social media?
I appreciate that brother yeah I said resonate media we have another
Cannabook Club next week appreciate the support over on future cannabis project
with that we're gonna be taking a look at a review paper of basically as many
light experiments as this paper could find and we're going over that next
Monday November 8th so that's the the next place that you'll see us and
appreciate it London also if anybody's interested you know click on the profile
sign up for London's course this guy knows a thing or two about growing so
sign up for London's course someone's got to give you a plug London I'm
complete. Go ahead Jason, David did you want to go? Sign up for London's course.
Thanks guys. I just want to echo that. I'm all bless you over here I appreciate you.
Thank you and thank you guys out a future cannabis project I will say as
well actually Chase you have a show on Mondays do you have anything else going
on that you want to shout out and let people know about because they should
definitely check out the breeder panel that you are like what are the key guys
I love listening to you on Mondays. I have finally after all these years
ordered a seed separator or so I'm excited to be waiting for my Amazon
order so I have bit the bullet and finally got one after all this time so
I'm super duper excited to have one of those. Technology's great. So plugs to the
seed separators in the soon bomb genetics about to hit the local market
for chases you're gonna go into that but we're good we know we're gonna see
you everywhere and be talking about it but you back everybody else I'll come
back and join us again whenever they like I appreciate each and every one you
Josh, Jameson, Cory, Dr. Annett, Jason Gideon, Joda Herb. Do you prefer me to say Joda?
Joda Herb. Jason it's fine either one it really doesn't matter I am me and my
alter ego are fine with either recognition so thank you.
Jason from Joda Herb, Ashley and Chase. Always wonderful to have you guys up on stage and talk about things and I
think we've gone through a lot of great information that a lot of people find a
lot of great value in so thanks again check it out on future cannabis projects
and yeah you guys keep being you. I appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you. Thanks guys. I'll leave the room open for a minute make sure to follow
these amazing moderators and these amazing speakers and follow the club as
well because there are some freaking awesome people here follow the people
that you're standing next to follow everybody.
My mic is muted hello can you hear me out there in the future cannabis project
world guys I appreciate you all it was awesome having you along for the show
we'll be back next week so we got the Canadians coming through with a little
bit of Canadian industry perspective next week we're gonna do kind of a fall
smoke up that'll be chill and a lot of fun you can probably hear my little one
screaming around right in the background there they are and then on Saturday we
have a awesome show where we got BC bubble man and we're gonna talk cash and
get to know him a little bit on the day in power people behind the plant on
future cannabis project that is again on there I'm gonna post that up very
shortly thanks again each and every one of you for tuning in Alka your garden is
freaking awesome shoot me a message anytime if you want to chat a catch up
again I appreciate each step one of you keep growing guys and keep it going
