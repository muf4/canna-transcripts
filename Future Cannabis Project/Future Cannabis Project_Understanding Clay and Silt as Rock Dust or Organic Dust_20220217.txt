[00:00.000 --> 00:07.720]  Alright, we are live. Good morning boys and girls. Just some quick housekeeping on things
[00:07.720 --> 00:17.680]  that I'm excited about and doing in the background. But we have our first event post-COVID, or
[00:17.680 --> 00:25.260]  not post-COVID, but two years into COVID, we're finally doing the music stuff. So this
[00:25.260 --> 00:33.660]  is for those of you who live in the LA area. We got a Breeder Roundtable, followed by an
[00:33.660 --> 00:40.220]  eight-piece reggae band, Jagoon and Justifia, at the Townhouse in Venice. And with that,
[00:40.220 --> 00:41.220]  Brian, take it away.
[00:41.220 --> 00:46.260]  Yeah, it looks pretty cool, Peter. Good morning to you Living Soil nerds. Happy Thursday to
[00:46.260 --> 00:52.660]  you. As always, we're going to have a fantastic conversation today. I always kind of judge
[00:52.660 --> 00:57.380]  where we're going to go by how many emojis Leighton sends me Thursday morning. And he
[00:57.380 --> 01:02.700]  has been rapid firing those emojis. So I will let the viewers know that we're probably going
[01:02.700 --> 01:09.340]  to hear some rants today, warranted rants, and just some fun talking more about diving
[01:09.340 --> 01:15.860]  deeper into rock dust and are all rock dust equal? You learned that when we were first
[01:15.860 --> 01:20.980]  getting into this, we learned that later on in the growing experience. Diversity wasn't
[01:20.980 --> 01:25.820]  really taught upon. I don't think at first we really understood the real importance of
[01:25.820 --> 01:31.020]  calcium with trace minerals and really improving the overall immunity of the plant system by
[01:31.020 --> 01:36.300]  adding these. So we're going to dive deeper into that, but I'm kind of excited to see
[01:36.300 --> 01:41.540]  what Mr. Morrison over here has to say. So I'm going to give it to our co-host.
[01:41.540 --> 01:54.100]  All right. So I came to the realization I'm broken. My experience with Pauline over the
[01:54.100 --> 02:04.900]  last three years, or just under three before she passed, fucked me up. Right. So clay and
[02:04.900 --> 02:18.180]  silt are broken down shit, right? So clay comes from either volcanic ash or rock that
[02:18.180 --> 02:26.380]  has been ground by glaciers. And I don't think humans can imagine the force that it takes
[02:26.380 --> 02:36.060]  to turn a solid rock into a fucking clay. So I called a friend of mine and I said, dude,
[02:36.060 --> 02:41.260]  I'm fucking broken. I need a reset. I need I need to hero those. I need to fucking vision
[02:41.260 --> 02:50.020]  quest. So he flew in Monday and I fucking hero dosed on Tuesday. Like I broke myself the fuck
[02:50.300 --> 03:01.100]  into silt and fucking clay. I just, I, you don't understand what it's fucking like to be so
[03:01.100 --> 03:08.780]  fucking hurting that you, you just don't care about fucking anything. And so it was just irony.
[03:08.780 --> 03:13.700]  It was the universe hard at work that we had no guests. And Brian texted me and I said, you know,
[03:13.700 --> 03:19.860]  let's talk about clay and silt because they are the foundations of, of regenerated life.
[03:19.860 --> 03:28.740]  The, that something was taken down so fucking low that there's nothing left of it, but yet it is the
[03:28.740 --> 03:35.980]  reset of nature. And I'm going to take you to a fucking landslide people. We're as soon as two
[03:35.980 --> 03:41.180]  hours into this, when I get done puking my shit, I'm going to fucking get in my car and I'm going
[03:41.180 --> 03:48.140]  to drive to a fucking landslide where I harvest clay and silt for people. Like I sent out three
[03:48.140 --> 03:54.300]  boxes yesterday, two went to Michigan, one went to Virginia for people that want to build a
[03:54.300 --> 04:00.580]  horizontal soil system, but don't have access to silt and clay there. It's from grounds frozen.
[04:00.580 --> 04:08.220]  It's, you know, you can't, you can't wild craft shit right now. So yeah, I'm wearing the fuck
[04:08.340 --> 04:18.110]  cancer shirt again, because fuck that shit. And, and being broken is no fun there. It's just,
[04:18.110 --> 04:26.680]  you guys, I was at a fucking dinner meeting last night for the most amazing project I've ever
[04:26.680 --> 04:32.360]  fucking had the opportunity to work on. Fuck the St. Louis arches. It was an $800 million
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.560]  fucking project. And if you've ever been to St. Louis and looked at the arches,
[04:37.560 --> 04:45.560]  it's an impressive fucking man-made architectural fucking feature. But it was for humans. It was,
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.000]  it was like, look how big my penis or my breasts are. Right. It wasn't about like, Oh, let's, let's,
[04:51.640 --> 04:57.560]  let's get back to nature. It was about look how great humanity is. Look what we can fucking build.
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.640]  Yeah, it was, it was a great project. I, I, I'm proud of the work that I did there,
[05:04.520 --> 05:07.720]  but this project is, is the largest
[05:10.840 --> 05:16.040]  nature bridge on the planet. So they're building an overpass over the one Oh one.
[05:18.040 --> 05:26.280]  So that cougars and turkeys and, and, and wildlife can cross over the one Oh one without
[05:26.600 --> 05:34.600]  getting fucking killed. And it all kind of stemmed from this movement for P 22 P stands for,
[05:34.600 --> 05:42.520]  I believe Panther 22 was the, was the mountain lion that was caught on camera
[05:44.040 --> 05:51.240]  crossing that highway and became a movement out here. Like, you know, everybody in Hollywood
[05:52.200 --> 05:58.120]  and Malibu were all about P 22 and they started raising money. And
[05:59.480 --> 06:06.600]  the desire was to create a safe passage for both macro and micro
[06:08.600 --> 06:14.920]  animals to be able to access the land on both sides of the highway, which there's an immense
[06:14.920 --> 06:21.160]  amount of land. And so what, if for whatever reason, people got behind P 22 and they raised
[06:21.160 --> 06:29.480]  a lot of fucking money and they united groups from pretty much all over the country to, to build this
[06:31.480 --> 06:36.440]  bridge and a series of tunnels to allow these animals to move back and forth between these
[06:36.440 --> 06:43.400]  pockets of, of nature that we haven't fucked up yet. So I'm at this meeting last night
[06:44.600 --> 06:52.600]  talking about how we're going to move forward and how we're going to make sure that, that we provide
[06:52.600 --> 06:58.760]  the most perfect representation of what would have been there a thousand years ago if we hadn't
[06:58.760 --> 07:05.960]  touched it. So IMOs, everything, plant life, they're, they're growing oak trees from fucking
[07:05.960 --> 07:11.880]  sea so that they are, they're grown in the area in which they're going to be planted. And, and
[07:11.880 --> 07:14.840]  25 years from now, this place is going to be a fucking paradise.
[07:17.320 --> 07:24.200]  And the animals will safely be able to cross over the 101 in a way that they're not exposed to
[07:24.200 --> 07:27.560]  the lights and the noise. I mean, this, this bridge is fucking badass.
[07:29.400 --> 07:36.920]  And I can't find fucking joy in this. Like I, I'm, I'm proud to be a part of it. I should be excited.
[07:36.920 --> 07:42.680]  I should be thrilled. I should be jumping out of my fucking skin to be able to work on a project
[07:42.680 --> 07:52.280]  of this magnitude, but I, I I'm broken. I'm fucking broken, man. So I am clay. I am silt. I am the
[07:52.840 --> 08:03.960]  smallest particulate of, of a rock or of a tree. And dosing definitely hit a reset, but
[08:05.480 --> 08:12.200]  I don't know is I'll ever be whole like I was prior to, to, to dealing with this shit.
[08:13.880 --> 08:19.720]  And then watching a loved one go from a healthy fucking happy human being to
[08:19.800 --> 08:25.080]  Skeletor to an Auschwitz fucking survivor. And she didn't survive.
[08:29.910 --> 08:35.910]  So I'm undone ranting and, and being pissed off at the fucking world. And Oh, incidentally,
[08:35.910 --> 08:41.990]  look at my forehead. You see that little pink fucking dot. If you look back last week's video,
[08:41.990 --> 08:51.190]  you'll see it was a black and gray scab on my forehead. Pauline was so worried about it before
[08:51.190 --> 08:59.990]  she got sick and all the attention went on trying to keep her here. She had gotten, I have a pad
[08:59.990 --> 09:04.230]  over there somewhere with, with a skin doctor that she was like, you gotta go see this guy.
[09:04.230 --> 09:10.070]  You gotta go see this guy. You gotta get that shit taken care of because it's probably fucking
[09:10.070 --> 09:17.110]  cancer. So when I'm dosing, I'm in the middle of this fucking incredibly hard, hard fucking trip
[09:17.990 --> 09:23.430]  and it hurts. And I don't, I never touched it because as soon as I touched it, it fucking hurt.
[09:23.430 --> 09:30.070]  So I always kept my hands away from that spot. And in the middle of this fucking experience,
[09:31.030 --> 09:36.630]  I looked over at fucking Corey and I touched my head and it fell off in my fucking hands.
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.440]  Man, to be honest with you, I think you're headed down the exact path that you need.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  Heroic dosing is for anybody that's ever done that is, it's intense. I mean, that is something
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.440]  that is, I wouldn't recommend the first time you ever try mushrooms that you try a heroic dose,
[09:57.440 --> 10:03.440]  but you work up to that and then you find certain things in life.
[10:03.440 --> 10:13.200]  I would never be prepared for it. I don't care how much you dose. You go to a place that's,
[10:16.000 --> 10:31.120]  alternate, meta, multiverse place that it's, it's so fucking deep and painful at the same time that
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.520]  I don't think you could ever be prepared. Just like fucking going through cancer,
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.000]  watching someone you love fucking die, melt in front of your fucking eyes.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  Dude, I'm fucking strong human. I've been through fucking many traumas in my life.
[10:44.960 --> 10:52.400]  That one fucked me up. It fucked me up hard, man. And, and the hero dosing is the same thing. It's
[10:52.400 --> 11:00.640]  like just getting like at the end of the trip, eight, nine o'clock at night, I looked at Corey
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.600]  and I said, dude, I got a fucking concussion. Like, and, and I want to explain this correctly.
[11:07.680 --> 11:16.720]  It's like, like getting hit so fucking hard in the head, not, not, not breaking skin, not,
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.400]  you know, a bruise or a bump, but like with a helmet. So the, the impact is spread out through
[11:24.400 --> 11:32.720]  your whole head, but your brain went fucking slosh. And, and now you have a headache. That's
[11:32.720 --> 11:39.200]  not like a headache that you usually take aspirin for. It's the brain fucking hurts.
[11:40.560 --> 11:48.480]  And that's, that's what it is. It's like you, you hurt the, the, the, the essence of what your
[11:48.480 --> 11:54.480]  vessel is. All right. So again, spirituality, right? Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.240]  You still have a spirit inside of you. The body is the vessel. It's just the container,
[12:00.240 --> 12:07.600]  the thing that holds that spirit in one place until the body dies, then the spirits let go
[12:07.600 --> 12:15.200]  and becomes back a part of the energy, the universal energy. So when you, when you have
[12:15.200 --> 12:23.440]  a concussion, that's so fucking powerful that your fucking brain hurts, that's, that's a hero
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.440]  man. That's I, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless they're fucking broken.
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.680]  And if you're broken, that's, you're not in a good place, man.
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.560]  Um, you know, as I was talking to him, like, yeah, I've done acid and I've done mushrooms
[12:40.560 --> 12:47.120]  and I've enjoyed it. I've laughed. I've played, I've seen like how the plants dance and the wind
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.160]  and the sunlight all look different and cool. And that's fun, man. That's, that's, that's joy.
[12:52.160 --> 12:58.880]  That's entertainment. Hero dosing is no fucking joke, man. You're going to a place that's,
[12:58.880 --> 13:06.720]  that's fucking horribly painful. Uh, broken. I mean, to be fair, it's not always a painful
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.200]  place. It's just where you are in your life. And you, you needed to probably have those
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.400]  walls come down because you've lost the love of your life. But once those walls came down
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.400]  doing a heroic dose, you're starting to deal with what, what happened.
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.560]  Yes, you're probably exactly correct. And mushrooms are the way to go, man. I really
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.280]  do feel that because the older I get, I realized that most people don't give a shit about
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.160]  just men and their, and their problems and shit. And we just deal with that shit and we just keep
[13:36.160 --> 13:41.280]  things moving. Uh, but the reality, especially at this level, uh, when you've lost someone,
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.960]  there needs to be some time for healing, but you know, somebody that's always working or
[13:46.960 --> 13:53.040]  taking care of a family. A lot of times we don't have, um, really time for anything other than
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.120]  that kind of stuff or just keep moving. We don't think about it. So I commend you for taking the
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.800]  time to calm your mind and actually deal with what happened. Cause that's, that's something
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.040]  to be commendable. I think most people have horrific things happen to them and just try to
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.920]  bury it and keep it moving. Uh, and that causes a variety of other issues in life.
[14:12.960 --> 14:20.080]  It's called the shadow effect. So I highly recommend the audience look into the documentary
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.600]  called the shadow effect or the books that she wrote. We all have a yin and yang. We all have
[14:25.600 --> 14:33.040]  a good and a bad side to us. And if we bury the bad and bury all of those traumas, then they come
[14:33.040 --> 14:41.600]  out in other ways and usually very harmful and hurtful ways. And yeah, dude, I fortunately I'm
[14:41.600 --> 14:47.680]  blessed enough to have done enough spirit work, energy work that I can realize that, yeah, I'm
[14:47.680 --> 14:57.680]  fucked up. That one fucking, that one dinged me hard and it's important to stop and breathe and
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.960]  look and understand that I'm broken, right? Yeah. I can get fixed. We'll ever be the same. No,
[15:05.520 --> 15:15.120]  never. Um, and so yeah, it's, it's, it's fucking hard work, but, but necessary. And I think that
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.480]  you're right, Brian, we don't take enough time as humans to stop and reflect on our traumas or
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.640]  our experiences in the proper way, because we're so busy with this fucking thing and work and money
[15:29.680 --> 15:37.360]  life and kids and relationships that, that we don't have time to stop and reflect. And I sat
[15:37.360 --> 15:44.080]  here since, well, even before December 20th, before she passed away, I sat in that chair,
[15:44.080 --> 15:53.280]  looking out the fucking window going, what the fuck? What the fuck? And no matter how hard I
[15:53.280 --> 16:00.480]  tried to come out of that fucking shit, I couldn't do, I fucking couldn't. And I come off like to
[16:00.480 --> 16:08.720]  people like, oh, I'm fine. Yeah. I'm cool. Inside, I'm not cool, man. I'm fucking broken. I'm hurting.
[16:09.280 --> 16:16.480]  So yeah, that was a way to just accept the fact that the glacier is pushing over my rock formation
[16:16.480 --> 16:23.120]  and turning me into the smallest particulate it possibly can in hopes that it provides life and
[16:23.120 --> 16:30.640]  future for something else. And that's why it's just so fucking ironic that today's conversation
[16:31.600 --> 16:39.360]  is about these two things. So let's, let's get on, let's get past the, the, my fucking issues.
[16:39.360 --> 16:48.480]  And let's talk about what is silt and what is clay. So clay and silt have completely different
[16:48.480 --> 16:55.360]  properties. And again, I get pissed at the dogma of soil science that, that, that determine
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.480]  silt and clay as their particulate size and not on their individual qualities.
[17:02.240 --> 17:08.320]  Silt and clay are fucking opposite, man. One is an organic form of dust. Silt is an organic form
[17:08.320 --> 17:17.040]  of dust. Clay is a rock dust. So rock, we've talked about it being alive and yes, it is,
[17:17.040 --> 17:21.680]  but it's still has properties that are completely different than a fucking tree.
[17:22.160 --> 17:29.520]  A tree can't eat rock, but the biology can break the rock down and provide mineral to the plant.
[17:30.960 --> 17:41.120]  So these are in many ways, the, the aftermath of, of a whole other life that existed for potentially
[17:41.120 --> 17:47.440]  thousands of years in the form of a Redwood or millions or billions of years in the form of a
[17:47.440 --> 17:54.400]  rock formation. Clay has both positive and negative charges. Silt is pretty much a negative
[17:54.400 --> 18:01.680]  charge. And yet soil science dogma states that though they're the same thing, they're just
[18:01.680 --> 18:09.540]  different because of their particulate size. We as, we as a species need to fucking get our shit
[18:09.540 --> 18:16.740]  together and, and, and start to really look at things instead of, you know, look at the
[18:17.140 --> 18:24.020]  look at things instead of how we control them or how we, we define them and, and look at them for
[18:24.020 --> 18:33.460]  what they really are. You know, clay, clay increases the ability for nutrients to be stored
[18:34.660 --> 18:43.300]  in the soil. So it has a high CEC cation exchange capacity. So it holds calcium, magnesium,
[18:43.300 --> 18:55.860]  potassium, salt and, and silt doesn't. And so, you know, going back to the conversation
[18:55.860 --> 19:01.060]  about living soils is like, how are you ever going to get a living soil in, in, in potting soil?
[19:01.620 --> 19:09.300]  How are you ever going to get the level of natural biology that would live in a soil system
[19:09.300 --> 19:17.860]  in nature into your pot or your bed if you don't have silt and clay? And, you know, again,
[19:17.860 --> 19:26.180]  the irony of all of this is just out of fucking control that, you know, I stumbled upon
[19:27.780 --> 19:34.180]  people that showed me places like where we're going to go later today, this landslide and
[19:35.060 --> 19:39.940]  Peter, at some point you got to play that song landslide. I forget the artist. She was part of
[19:39.940 --> 19:44.020]  Fleetwood Mac. I believe that's Stevie Nicks, man. That's a tough song to hear brother.
[19:45.300 --> 19:52.660]  You know, that's a, that's a, that's nature's reset, a landslide, a fucking tornado, an
[19:52.660 --> 19:58.740]  earthquake, a fucking tsunami, burricane. That's, that's how guy, a reset shit.
[19:59.300 --> 20:07.380]  So how ironic that, you know, I come across these, this gentleman who bought a landslide,
[20:08.820 --> 20:14.580]  he fucking bought a landslide back in the eighties and has been harvesting clay
[20:15.940 --> 20:24.980]  from this to use as a cap for landfills. So to prevent the methane from escaping and to prevent
[20:24.980 --> 20:32.180]  erosion and prevent water from, from traveling through these landfills and polluting the
[20:32.180 --> 20:39.220]  groundwater, they, they do what's called a clay cap. So they, they cap the landfill with clay
[20:39.220 --> 20:44.340]  so that the water sheds off of it and doesn't travel through it. And they also doing that
[20:44.660 --> 20:52.020]  through it and they also doing that trap the methane. So he bought a land fucking slide
[20:54.580 --> 21:01.140]  so that he could harvest the clay and, and use it in industry, human, human industry.
[21:02.820 --> 21:07.060]  And when I, when I got there and I looked around, I was like, Oh my fucking God, dude,
[21:07.060 --> 21:12.180]  you're sitting on a gold mine. This, this, this shit's incredibly valuable. And he,
[21:12.180 --> 21:20.420]  he thought I was a lunatic. And a year later he, he realizes that, yeah, I'm crazy. Sure. But
[21:21.380 --> 21:27.460]  there is a true value to, to the material that he calls it overburden. So when they're mining
[21:27.460 --> 21:33.140]  the clay, when they're digging through this slide to get to the pockets of clay that are valuable,
[21:33.860 --> 21:37.860]  they throw all this other shit off that silt blended with clay.
[21:38.660 --> 21:43.940]  And I'm like, that's dude, that's magic. Like you can build the most incredible soil with this
[21:43.940 --> 21:48.980]  component. Yeah. You got to mix it with organic matter and you got to mix it with sand, but,
[21:48.980 --> 21:55.220]  but you have a concentration of silt and clay. That's almost equal. It's almost 50, 50.
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.580]  And so, you know, like Django went,
[22:00.820 --> 22:08.180]  Django went, he called me, I don't know how many times when he went down the journey of trying to
[22:08.740 --> 22:13.460]  wild craft, um, silt and clay for his horizontal soil system.
[22:15.860 --> 22:22.500]  I can't find it. Where do I look for this shit? I'm like, dude, swamps, uh, old riverbeds,
[22:22.500 --> 22:27.300]  Oxbows. Uh, that's where you're going to find the silt. It's organic matter, dude. It's mud. It's,
[22:27.860 --> 22:34.580]  it's slippery. Like if you take silt and you run it between your fingers, it's, it's silky.
[22:34.580 --> 22:41.220]  It feels like silk clay is not clay is like greasy. It rolls together. It's sticky.
[22:41.940 --> 22:48.500]  So the two have a completely different field to them. So I'm like, use your touch, dude. Like
[22:48.500 --> 22:54.740]  go out to, to, you know, hike the riverbeds, hike, hike where there's erosion because you'll find it
[22:54.740 --> 22:59.620]  there. You'll, you'll be able to identify it by touch. If it rolls together in a snake between
[22:59.620 --> 23:04.980]  your fingers, it's fucking clay. If it's gritty, then it's clay with sand. If it's, if it's gritty
[23:04.980 --> 23:11.620]  and silky, it's probably silt and sand mixed together. And if it has all three components,
[23:11.620 --> 23:19.860]  then basically you've got dirt, you've got earth, you got something of value. And so he spent weeks
[23:20.820 --> 23:28.500]  tromping around, trying to find pockets of this shit. And he did eventually he got them. So
[23:33.310 --> 23:38.190]  these things are so important in, in, if you're trying to get
[23:40.270 --> 23:47.310]  full expression of any genetic cultivar, I don't care if it's a fucking palm tree or a cannabis
[23:47.310 --> 23:53.790]  plant. If you don't have those variables, those ingredients, those components,
[23:54.990 --> 24:03.230]  you're never going to get to a point where you actually have allowed that genetic potential to
[24:03.230 --> 24:09.550]  express itself. And, you know, I, I know I got on the limb, I get all fucking crazy. But
[24:10.350 --> 24:18.510]  the reality of the fact is that if, if you truly want to have or provide the potential for
[24:18.510 --> 24:27.470]  anything, you can't, you can't limit the, the ingredients you, you, you, you can't, you can't
[24:27.470 --> 24:34.190]  say, Oh, you, you can have this, but you can't have that because you've, you've, you've denied
[24:35.150 --> 24:41.710]  something that, that has the potential to allow again, full genetic expression.
[24:43.150 --> 24:52.350]  And understanding that, you know, silt was at some point a living thing
[24:54.990 --> 25:00.110]  that was on the surface, as well as just underneath the surface of the earth,
[25:00.990 --> 25:10.990]  um, where a rock is, is just a geological expression of the planet. Whereas,
[25:12.190 --> 25:17.310]  you know, the rock's been here for billions of years, the plants, the life, you know,
[25:17.950 --> 25:27.150]  the debate is still wide open. I think it's 1.3 billion years that, that we have, we believe that
[25:27.150 --> 25:32.510]  the expression of, of life, uh, plants, the first ones, or perhaps even
[25:34.430 --> 25:39.470]  pro proker, I can't even fucking talk. Multicelled
[25:41.310 --> 25:52.510]  organisms, the foundation of life was began to express itself. So these components are,
[25:52.830 --> 25:58.510]  are, are the foundation of what we see today. Um,
[26:00.270 --> 26:04.830]  probably more importantly, the beauty of the planet a thousand years ago, before we had the mass
[26:07.390 --> 26:14.030]  expansion of humanity to the point where we stopped all of the migrations, um,
[26:14.110 --> 26:24.830]  or slowed them down and restricted the, the evolution or the potential of, of what life
[26:24.830 --> 26:37.140]  could have been if we had not focused on money and power. Yeah. See, I am reset.
[26:39.540 --> 26:42.900]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, buddy. I feel like you got to do that a couple of times,
[26:42.900 --> 26:46.100]  you know, um, when you, when you're healing from something like this,
[26:46.100 --> 26:49.860]  this is probably going to take like six months to a year, man, but you're on the right path.
[26:49.860 --> 26:57.220]  That's for sure. I don't think I'll ever be what I was prior. That's all right.
[26:58.580 --> 27:04.980]  It's okay. It's part of, part of that illusion too. I would say to you, how could you, I mean,
[27:04.980 --> 27:12.020]  right, right. How could you, how could you ever come back? So, oh, Pauline's dog, you guys have
[27:12.020 --> 27:23.380]  seen him. Um, I I've not a dog. I've never had a dog. I I'm not a dog or a dog person. Um, but
[27:23.380 --> 27:36.020]  in many ways I truly believe that she, she brought him into our life. She, she sent me pictures of
[27:36.020 --> 27:41.300]  him. I was out on the East coast. I forget where she was. We weren't together and she started
[27:41.300 --> 27:46.180]  sending me pictures of this litter of puppies. And, and I'm like, Pauline, I got no time for a
[27:46.180 --> 27:52.660]  dog. You're fucking kidding me. I'm traveling all over the place. A dog is like a child. You need
[27:52.660 --> 27:58.740]  to love them. You need to show them respect and nurture them and teach them to be responsible.
[27:58.740 --> 28:05.860]  You don't want them biting somebody or causing harm or killing a cat or a bird or anything else.
[28:05.860 --> 28:12.820]  The dogs are, they're fucking aggressive, man. I don't have time for that. And yet she just
[28:12.820 --> 28:20.580]  pursued and constantly sent me pictures of, of this breed. This is a, he's a mini Australian
[28:20.580 --> 28:26.740]  shepherd. And if any of you know what they are, they're highly intelligent, high energy. Um,
[28:27.700 --> 28:32.420]  they'll, they'll train you if you don't train them. I mean, they'll, they'll train you with
[28:32.420 --> 28:42.340]  bad behavior. And so this guy ends up in my life, um, but he's not mine. He's hers. And,
[28:42.340 --> 28:48.980]  and this breed is really a one human dog. They don't like, he wouldn't even let me near her for
[28:48.980 --> 28:58.340]  three fucking months. And so we learned to get along. We, we learned to, um, tolerate each other.
[28:58.420 --> 29:06.500]  And then as she started to go through, you know, some serious fucking alternative healing methods,
[29:06.500 --> 29:11.860]  she went to Mexico and spent three months down there. She was down in Laguna beach for another
[29:11.860 --> 29:18.660]  month, um, you know, fighting the cancer because she adopted, we knew that the, she had two tumors,
[29:18.660 --> 29:24.660]  one on her lungs and one on her intestines that were growing fast. And she wasn't, she wasn't
[29:25.620 --> 29:31.540]  willing to do chemo at that point in time. So all of a sudden he's left with me for months on end.
[29:32.180 --> 29:40.900]  And so we had no choice but to, to figure each other out. Right. And so I, I said, Pauline,
[29:40.900 --> 29:44.740]  I can't fucking, I don't know how to deal with this guy. He's like fucking all over the place.
[29:44.740 --> 29:50.500]  And she's like, well, there's this trainer that I wanted to work with, call her and deal with her.
[29:51.060 --> 29:58.820]  And so she gave me this woman's Robin Roy's name and I called her, I said, look, I have an
[29:58.820 --> 30:07.060]  Australian shepherd that I, I don't know how to deal with. And that's, you know, has a lot of
[30:07.060 --> 30:15.460]  misbehavior. I need, I need help. I don't speak dog. And so she,
[30:16.020 --> 30:22.340]  she came and, and, you know, met Poe and I explained to her, I said, yeah, he's, he nips
[30:22.340 --> 30:26.740]  people and it's a problem. I'm scared that he's going to break skin and someone's going to
[30:27.540 --> 30:35.140]  complain and this dog is going to be put down. And so she began learning to speak to this dog
[30:35.140 --> 30:41.700]  and, and teach me how to talk to it as well in a way to give it insurance that it doesn't have
[30:42.020 --> 30:50.020]  to, you know, bark and freak out that anybody comes near me. And as we started to work together,
[30:50.020 --> 30:54.660]  I got to know her a little bit more and more. And, and she went through trauma. She lost her
[30:54.660 --> 31:04.260]  husband six years ago to cancer and she has never rebounded. She's, she's, she's, she has three
[31:04.820 --> 31:15.300]  dogs. So she has a support network, but she's not the same dude. And I don't think, you know, if,
[31:15.300 --> 31:26.100]  if I, if I allow that to, to drive me, then I probably never will allow myself to emotionally
[31:26.820 --> 31:32.340]  attached to anything else. And in many ways, like she's a beautiful spirit, she's a good looking
[31:32.340 --> 31:39.540]  woman, but she too is broken. She, she's silt or clay at this point in her life. And, and,
[31:41.220 --> 31:49.540]  you know, she appears to be happy and whole as a human, but if you are an emotional person,
[31:49.860 --> 31:56.580]  she appears to be happy and whole as a human. But if you are an empath,
[31:58.180 --> 32:05.140]  you can see through the facade. You can see the fact that no, she's, she's still in a lot of pain.
[32:05.140 --> 32:16.500]  She lost her, her companion, her, her co-spirit, her other half. And in that regard, you know,
[32:16.500 --> 32:26.970]  I think that, I think that it's a very difficult thing to look at. It's like looking yourself in
[32:26.970 --> 32:31.050]  the mirror and staring into your own eyes and looking into your soul and asking yourself,
[32:31.050 --> 32:35.850]  are you a good person? Are you doing the right things in life? And it's called spirit work or
[32:35.850 --> 32:42.650]  energy work. And it's, most people can't do it. They just can't fucking do it. But I think that
[32:43.610 --> 32:49.050]  if you're ever going to be, again, hit your potential as a, as a human or a spirit, then,
[32:49.050 --> 32:56.090]  then that is really important work to do. But at the same regard, you know,
[32:57.450 --> 33:04.570]  I don't think that you'll ever be able to go back to the place you were before you looked into your
[33:04.570 --> 33:09.290]  eyeballs and started asking yourself those kinds of questions. That's going to throw you on a path
[33:09.370 --> 33:15.290]  that is going to change you for better or worse, hopefully better. But
[33:17.450 --> 33:22.970]  so it's similar to the same thing as losing, losing something that is, is
[33:24.810 --> 33:31.930]  perhaps a gift from the universe, something that helps to complete you helps to hit your potential.
[33:32.810 --> 33:38.170]  You lose shit like that, man. I, you know, again, it's evolution.
[33:40.090 --> 33:44.250]  I wouldn't have suffered. I wouldn't have done this. I wouldn't have experienced it if I wasn't
[33:44.250 --> 33:52.330]  supposed to, but it doesn't make it fucking easy. And I don't know. I don't know, again, if,
[33:53.290 --> 34:02.890]  if it's ever going to stop like that, that, that piece, that the fact that I can't fucking talk to
[34:02.890 --> 34:10.010]  her, like she's still here. Like you fucking fact that that thing fell off my head. That's her
[34:10.010 --> 34:14.410]  energy, dude. She was scared about that thing and she burned it the fuck off my head while I'm
[34:14.410 --> 34:21.930]  tripping. Uh, Corey saw her an operation here, uh, the night he got here and he, he, he was like,
[34:21.930 --> 34:27.530]  I wasn't sure I should tell you this. I, I, I, you know, are you, are you afraid of ghosts?
[34:27.530 --> 34:33.050]  And I'm like, no, do you know, I get energy. I'm fine with that. Like, there's so many things that
[34:33.050 --> 34:39.130]  have happened recently that, that, that let me know she's still here. The Hawk, the next day
[34:39.130 --> 34:45.210]  landing on my fence, like five feet from me. That's on my Instagram. That, that was fucking
[34:45.210 --> 34:53.690]  real this morning as I was like freaking out a Heron flew over at the top of my head, a big one.
[34:54.730 --> 35:02.010]  And he wasn't that far up. And if you, if you are spiritual and you look into
[35:02.970 --> 35:12.090]  animal spirits or the messages that they bring you, um, you are in touch with the environment
[35:12.090 --> 35:18.330]  around you. And in being in touch, you will get signals, messages from loved ones that are no
[35:18.330 --> 35:26.410]  longer here in, in the sign or in the exposure to, to these incredible majestic creatures.
[35:26.490 --> 35:31.210]  Um, they're sending you a message. They're telling you, Hey, we're okay. We're we're all right. And
[35:31.210 --> 35:40.010]  I know you're not, but maybe by you seeing this or being exposed to it, that it will help you
[35:41.050 --> 35:48.170]  in a profound way to tolerate the fact that you have to continue this journey
[35:48.490 --> 35:54.490]  In this world that, you know, is not going in the right direction. And you know, those, again,
[35:54.490 --> 35:58.170]  it's like spirit work. It's like looking yourself in the eyes and saying, Hey, am I a good person
[35:58.170 --> 36:04.730]  or not? Am I, am I hurting people or am I helping people? And it's not that it's good or bad. Again,
[36:04.730 --> 36:10.410]  you cannot define right or wrong. There is nothing. It's yin and yang. You have to have the
[36:10.410 --> 36:16.410]  black. And again, that's going back to the shadow world. Like if you don't, uh, you don't have the
[36:16.650 --> 36:26.090]  If you don't allow yourself to be that or have that component of your spirit, you, you, you are
[36:26.890 --> 36:36.170]  restricting your ability to, to mature spiritually, to hit nirvana, enlightenment, whatever the fuck
[36:36.170 --> 36:42.570]  you want to call it. So if you don't acknowledge your dark side, if you don't acknowledge the fact
[36:42.570 --> 36:48.970]  that you have these thoughts, then you are restricting your ability to hit your potential.
[36:52.900 --> 37:00.500]  Yeah. I'm sorry, peeps. I wanted to talk about salt and clay.
[37:02.580 --> 37:07.540]  Hey man. Well, look, I feel like the communities listen to you, you know, over a year, it's probably
[37:07.540 --> 37:13.780]  like three or four months on top of that year. Um, every Thursday, you know, give. So if you need to
[37:13.780 --> 37:17.540]  take 30 minutes to kind of talk about what you've been going through. And for those that have never
[37:17.540 --> 37:22.980]  done a heroic dose or actually even done mushrooms in general, um, the best way I can describe it is
[37:22.980 --> 37:29.060]  like a, it's an inside cleanse, um, things that are out the, the background of life, like just
[37:29.060 --> 37:33.540]  the way the trees are, the way the wind's blowing, especially on a heroic dose, you just see
[37:34.740 --> 37:38.900]  the same, the same reality that you're in. It's just that it's a little bit different. And then
[37:38.900 --> 37:46.820]  of course the doses take it to where you can become almost, uh, um, yeah, it was mushrooms,
[37:46.820 --> 37:54.580]  right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So penis envy to be exact. And I have, those are pretty intense.
[37:54.580 --> 38:01.780]  I mean, I have golden teachers, um, and they're, they're a wonderful, um, experience, but
[38:02.740 --> 38:09.540]  the ones that the, the, the dose he gave me was of a different strain, uh, cultivar. And the,
[38:09.540 --> 38:14.580]  the experience was a lot different. Uh, the golden teachers tend to be light and giggly.
[38:14.580 --> 38:25.380]  They're fun, right? They're, they're more of a, a bubbly buzz or experience. Those f****** penis
[38:25.780 --> 38:32.340]  man. They'll f****** kick your ass hard. They'll, they'll pull you in, pull you in and down and
[38:33.700 --> 38:40.740]  take you to places that perhaps you don't want to go, or perhaps you need to go. So it's, I, I just,
[38:41.860 --> 38:46.980]  I think that people need to understand that it's similar to like a Sediva or an Indica. They're,
[38:46.980 --> 38:51.940]  they're, they're radically different experiences. One of couch lock you and the other would make
[38:51.940 --> 38:58.100]  you bounce off the walls. Your headspace too, is really important for what what's going to happen
[38:58.100 --> 39:02.340]  during that trip as well. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't recommend, uh, if you've never done this, just
[39:02.340 --> 39:08.020]  kind of doing it when you're depressed or, uh, per personal story, I did a mushrooms with a
[39:08.020 --> 39:13.940]  friend that I thought would be able to handle it. Uh, and he's kind of a funny guy. So he was,
[39:13.940 --> 39:18.820]  he was having issues. We were trying to calm him down, but he kept going, this is not fun guy.
[39:18.820 --> 39:23.220]  Like obviously fun guy with the, with the mushrooms, but he kept fucking saying that
[39:23.220 --> 39:29.460]  shit for hours, just puking. And, and for whatever reason, man, I mean, it was kind of a doubt that
[39:29.460 --> 39:34.340]  that's been my worst trip because I had to kind of like deal with deal with that. Cause it was just
[39:34.340 --> 39:39.540]  hit him and I, uh, but it was interesting to kind of see from that perspective, like he had trauma,
[39:39.540 --> 39:43.700]  he had stuff that he was dealing with. Obviously he'd never shared this kind of stuff with me,
[39:43.700 --> 39:48.660]  uh, but he just kind of went through it and I've never done ayahuasca, but I would imagine
[39:48.740 --> 39:52.820]  it's kind of the same experience. Like if you can share that with a, with a friend, I mean,
[39:52.820 --> 39:56.980]  maybe that's something late and you could work up to as well. I've heard great things with it.
[39:56.980 --> 40:02.020]  Again, I've never personally tried it. I have done DMT, which maybe that's something else
[40:02.020 --> 40:07.380]  in time, but that's also something that you really want to, um, pick your source and understand,
[40:07.380 --> 40:12.820]  like you need a comfort, you know, it needs to be your, your environment is important. All of
[40:12.820 --> 40:19.780]  those little things. Uh, cause I see younger kids doing like DMT dabs and clubs and stuff. And I
[40:19.780 --> 40:23.780]  don't feel like that's the same thing. Like if you're after what you're after, you got to blast
[40:23.780 --> 40:31.220]  off. Yeah. And you know, that was one of the things that I so loved about Pauline is that she
[40:31.220 --> 40:38.820]  had done a two year shaman course where they experienced and exposed themselves to all of the
[40:38.820 --> 40:51.060]  potential, um, altering forms of compounds, whether it was the frog, uh, pus or ayahuasca,
[40:52.260 --> 41:02.820]  uh, DMT, uh, psilocybin, uh, that's the cactus peyote. So yeah, she did all of them. Um, and
[41:02.820 --> 41:08.580]  more often than not, it wasn't a group thing. It was a individual experience, which is even harder.
[41:09.540 --> 41:15.940]  You have to be in a really, really good headspace to go take a heroic dose of something by yourself.
[41:16.900 --> 41:23.060]  I mean, I, I, I didn't have the strength to do it. I called Corey and I said, dude, I need help.
[41:23.060 --> 41:30.260]  I'm fucking hurt and I'm fucking broken. I need, I need, I need to reset and I need a guide. I
[41:30.260 --> 41:36.260]  can't, I don't want to do this by myself. I'm afraid that I'll fucking twist. And so, yeah,
[41:36.260 --> 41:40.980]  he hopped on a plane and he came down here and, and you know, he took a little bit, probably half
[41:40.980 --> 41:48.500]  what I did, um, so that he was like in the right frame of mind to understand where, where my mind
[41:48.500 --> 41:56.420]  went. And so, yeah, if you're going to, if you're going to use these types of tools, please be smart
[41:56.420 --> 42:01.940]  about it and make sure that you are in the right frame of mind, like what you're saying, Brian,
[42:01.940 --> 42:10.420]  if you're, if you're depressed or, uh, you're, you're not ready to allow what's going to happen
[42:10.420 --> 42:16.980]  to happen, then don't do it because you will have a bad experience and then you'll basically ruin
[42:18.180 --> 42:26.660]  the ability to use it in the future because you'll be scared of it. So yeah, I, I prepared
[42:26.660 --> 42:34.820]  myself. Like I got up and I showered that morning. Like I scrubbed myself head to toe and, and the
[42:34.820 --> 42:41.300]  whole time I was washing myself, I was reminding myself of, of what I'm about to go on, what I'm
[42:41.300 --> 42:48.980]  doing. Um, it's not going to be fun, but I want to show proper respect to the plant by properly
[42:48.980 --> 42:55.540]  respecting my body and, and, and making sure that I'm as clean as I possibly can. And then I took
[42:55.540 --> 43:00.900]  Poe down to the beach and I took my shirt off. I took my shoes off. I walked in the sand. I grounded,
[43:00.900 --> 43:08.580]  I rolled around in the sand. I, I, I properly prepared my vessel to deal with what I was going
[43:08.580 --> 43:16.100]  to go through. And trust me, it wasn't, it wasn't fun. It was not a pleasurable experience, but
[43:16.100 --> 43:21.700]  it was obviously very important because I just couldn't fucking keep going on. I couldn't keep
[43:21.700 --> 43:29.060]  saying, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. You know, like, I don't know. You, you've witnessed me, Brian,
[43:29.060 --> 43:35.140]  going through all of this. Did, did I appear to be radically different? I mean, I don't know because
[43:35.140 --> 43:40.340]  I'm, I'm not, man, you haven't, you haven't been the same. And, um, that's why I'm bringing up that.
[43:40.340 --> 43:45.860]  I'm, I'm in a way, man, I'm proud of you for going through this. This is again, I feel how men can
[43:45.860 --> 43:51.140]  probably handle things, uh, hanging out with a buddy, using psychedelics, if that's your choice,
[43:51.140 --> 43:55.860]  or, you know, some guys just need a conversation. Um, but this is on a whole nother level,
[43:56.500 --> 44:01.300]  uh, you know, when you've lost a loved one and these, these are things that are on a deeper level.
[44:01.860 --> 44:07.220]  Um, you know, yesterday we kind of talked about superficial things and how emotional people get.
[44:07.220 --> 44:13.300]  Um, it really is silly. Uh, and then you, you know, today is it's, it's on a whole nother level
[44:13.300 --> 44:20.020]  when you've lost, you know, the love of your life. Uh, and I, I do believe that, um, you are headed
[44:20.020 --> 44:24.180]  down the right path, man. I would, I wouldn't say that when you said, oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[44:24.820 --> 44:29.300]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't say I believe that. That's the question you asked me.
[44:31.780 --> 44:35.460]  Yeah. Well, you know, it's, again, you can project certain things,
[44:35.700 --> 44:44.420]  you know, like your relationships with other people. Um, you can, you, you can mask to some
[44:44.420 --> 44:54.020]  degree, um, the, the internal trauma, the damage, the brokenness, and in a way that people don't
[44:54.580 --> 44:57.140]  worry about you. Right. Um,
[45:01.780 --> 45:06.900]  like I'm sure everybody out there has had experiences where they've had a breakdown of some
[45:06.900 --> 45:15.620]  kind, whether it was a breakup with someone you love or divorce or a loss of a family member,
[45:16.180 --> 45:25.940]  friend, or forced child. Um, and those kinds of traumas you as a human tend to mask, you tend to
[45:25.940 --> 45:33.860]  just bury. Um, I mean, yeah, I was, I was pretty good at it. I was pretty functional on the outside,
[45:33.860 --> 45:42.500]  but internally I was a fucking disaster, man. And so I chose to, to try to find a way to
[45:43.220 --> 45:50.740]  um, break down to silt and clay, what was left of the feelings and emotions that I had for her.
[45:50.740 --> 45:58.180]  And, and, you know, again, I I'm so blessed. I'm so grateful. I'm so lucky to have had that time
[45:58.180 --> 46:06.820]  with her because she was on the same level as me, you know, spiritually. And, and, you know,
[46:07.700 --> 46:12.580]  I think that at the end of the day, and this was part of the discussion that Corey and I had was,
[46:13.380 --> 46:22.100]  I'm not depressed. I'm just really fucking sad. I'm not, I'm not angry. I'm not mad, but I have
[46:22.100 --> 46:30.180]  these feelings, these passions inside of me that want to fucking come out. And if I don't, I will,
[46:30.180 --> 46:35.220]  I'm afraid that the shadow is going to get me and I'm not going to be
[46:37.300 --> 46:43.300]  doing the things I'm supposed to be doing, like working on this bridge, right? If I was, if I,
[46:43.300 --> 46:48.820]  if I become a basket case, they're not going to allow me to be a part of that project.
[46:49.860 --> 46:58.180]  So in many ways I have to keep going and I have to, I have to be there wholeheartedly and not broken.
[46:59.060 --> 47:07.780]  Um, I, yes, I can be, I can be, I can be dinged. I can be, you know, somewhat broken, but I still
[47:07.780 --> 47:13.140]  have to be responsible. I have to get up. I have to show up. I have to do the work. Right. So,
[47:15.140 --> 47:20.580]  you know, that's where I think, you know, it's, it's easy to hide this shit and, and not admit to
[47:20.580 --> 47:28.020]  yourself that you're hurting or you're dinged or you're broken. Um, and just carry on and, or
[47:28.020 --> 47:38.020]  allow distraction, allow, you know, life to, to, uh, help you carry on. But I don't think that
[47:38.020 --> 47:43.380]  that's the, you're, I don't believe you're going to ever get to what you're supposed to do or
[47:43.940 --> 47:48.020]  the potential that you could have, or, or the things that you could have done.
[47:48.980 --> 47:53.940]  If you, if you stay in that denial of the fact that you're, you're, you're hurt.
[47:56.260 --> 48:12.460]  So in many ways, um, compounds like psilocybin can help you, um, metabolize, digest, accept.
[48:13.420 --> 48:19.900]  Psilocybin is medicine the same way. Cannabis is medicine. It's just more and more, you know,
[48:19.900 --> 48:24.780]  the state that I live in is decriminalized. It's viewed upon as medicine. The university
[48:24.780 --> 48:29.340]  of Denver had a talk with Paul Stamets, uh, you know, talking about the benefits of this.
[48:29.980 --> 48:35.180]  So for a long time, people have been used to just popping pills. So I encourage a lot,
[48:35.820 --> 48:40.780]  actually everybody that has ever been interested in this, uh, I would encourage you to try it at
[48:40.780 --> 48:46.940]  some point in your life, uh, as well as DMT, just realize that DMT is like mushrooms times 10,
[48:46.940 --> 48:51.900]  a hundred, wherever your tolerance level is that. Yeah. It's going to launch you really hard,
[48:51.900 --> 48:58.460]  really fast. Whereas the mushrooms are going to linger and you're going to be suspended for a
[48:58.460 --> 49:04.300]  longer period of time. And, and you know what, you're right, dude. I think that, you know,
[49:05.100 --> 49:13.100]  it's important that, that all humans allow, um, themselves to be exposed to these compounds,
[49:13.100 --> 49:21.820]  the way nature to universe Gaia and planted. Um, yeah, we, we've been pushed into
[49:21.820 --> 49:25.260]  pharmaceuticals. There's a pill for everything, pill to make you happy,
[49:25.260 --> 49:28.620]  people to make you sleep, but they're not, they're not,
[49:29.500 --> 49:33.420]  those aren't long-term. Yeah. And those aren't long-term solutions. Same way with some of the,
[49:34.060 --> 49:38.140]  the growing stuff, you know, those are band-aids you got to find out what the source.
[49:39.100 --> 49:42.460]  Most of the time, to be honest, it's because we're not outside enough. So the fact that you're going
[49:42.460 --> 49:46.940]  out, you're taking your shirt off and going to the beach. I mean, that you have a huge advantage over
[49:46.940 --> 49:51.340]  even, you know, people in Colorado, we don't have a beach. Right. So, I mean, the fact that you can
[49:51.340 --> 49:57.500]  even just go out, be in the sun, that's something else that I would, I would say is definitely been
[49:57.500 --> 50:04.060]  proven to help with loss, depression, that kind of stuff, vitamin D from the sun, from the source
[50:04.060 --> 50:09.580]  itself. That's why those even, those lights, I definitely don't think it's the same thing,
[50:09.580 --> 50:15.100]  but those, they have like vitamin D, a light that you can use, like if you in certain states,
[50:15.100 --> 50:20.140]  it rains all the time or seasonal depression. Right. So if that works, imagine what sunlight's
[50:20.140 --> 50:25.020]  going to actually do for you. And I, unfortunately I've had, even for 2022, I've had some friends
[50:25.020 --> 50:30.700]  reach out to me that are, you know, they told me they were depressed and that, and I shared that
[50:30.700 --> 50:36.060]  with them, you know, what's your nutrition like, what's you know, are you going outside? And most
[50:36.060 --> 50:42.620]  of the time the answers are no, or, you know, I eat, I eat poorly. And that, that is a gift that
[50:42.620 --> 50:47.580]  I would say to you guys. When I played online poker for profit, I ate out of the vending machine.
[50:48.460 --> 50:55.340]  My stomach, whatever, I had horrific just problems in general with just nutrition,
[50:55.340 --> 51:01.580]  huge black stuff under your eyes. Once I fixed that and I realized that nutrition, food is
[51:01.580 --> 51:08.060]  medicine, really focused on cannabis now as medicine, your life is going to change. I assure
[51:08.060 --> 51:15.500]  you of that. So I, myself, I was, I had, you know, we were, we were doing well in the, in the hustling
[51:15.500 --> 51:21.420]  aspect, but as a human being, I had no like worth when we were first doing that, we would sit on the
[51:21.420 --> 51:27.420]  couch and play Madden and Grand Theft Auto and just all this like stupid shit, just pissing away hours.
[51:28.300 --> 51:33.820]  And as that progressed and then we'd go out to eat and like, I didn't realize, but it takes,
[51:33.820 --> 51:39.340]  it takes months. And then after that, I don't know what happens to you, but you kind of lose your way.
[51:39.340 --> 51:44.860]  So that's when I started to focus more on like day-to-day shit. Unfortunately, you know, with
[51:44.860 --> 51:48.940]  you, with a loss, I feel like that brings you back into that perspective, man, where it's like
[51:48.940 --> 51:55.100]  every day really does matter. And if you wake up with a purpose, you know, you're having a mindset
[51:55.100 --> 52:00.940]  of abundance, then you can achieve certain shit in life. And I'm living it right now with just
[52:00.940 --> 52:06.140]  weird things open up in your life when you are feeling better, when you just maybe come correct
[52:06.140 --> 52:11.020]  with certain people aren't as bitchy as, you know, we were kind of talking about this yesterday, like
[52:11.020 --> 52:14.940]  wanting to work with individuals and not everybody's going to say yes to you. So not,
[52:14.940 --> 52:19.100]  not holding a grudge on that kind of stuff and just feeling better in general. I feel like that
[52:19.100 --> 52:23.180]  vibe is going to come off. You're going to be a better farmer. You're going to be a better human
[52:23.180 --> 52:29.020]  being. You're going to be able to deal with extreme trauma as best that you can. And again,
[52:29.020 --> 52:35.020]  buddy, psilocybin, in my opinion, is probably the best thing you could do. And then especially doing
[52:35.020 --> 52:39.660]  it outside on the beach or just being outside. I mean, that's to me, those are some of my
[52:39.660 --> 52:44.780]  happiest memories with good buddies. We even had this place in college called Zimbabwe,
[52:44.780 --> 52:49.420]  where we just go out there and they had these fighter jets that would practice fighting against
[52:49.420 --> 52:53.340]  each other and they would shoot fireworks. So we'd be tripping balls, smoking blunts and just
[52:53.340 --> 52:57.980]  laughing and giggling and watching them, you know, watching jets fly over. So there's,
[52:57.980 --> 53:02.060]  there's all those little things that you got to find in life, you know, and there's probably
[53:02.060 --> 53:06.380]  memories that you have little spots where you were, you know, had a certain memory of Pauline
[53:07.180 --> 53:10.780]  when I would, you know, if I were you, I'd trip and kind of go back to those spots,
[53:11.420 --> 53:20.780]  kind of just see, see what happens. Yeah, no. I think being grateful,
[53:25.250 --> 53:34.290]  even if you're still in a sore place, if you're still hurting, being grateful is, is the most
[53:34.290 --> 53:40.770]  important thing. Like I'm still fucking here, right? I'm grateful. She, she, she fought,
[53:41.410 --> 53:48.850]  she fought, fought so fucking hard. She took fucking chemo, dude. She was so against chemo
[53:49.490 --> 53:56.610]  and, and she caved because she wanted to live. She wanted to stay here. And so
[53:56.850 --> 54:01.810]  gratefulness is the foundation of life. If you're not appreciative of the fact that,
[54:02.690 --> 54:08.450]  yeah, I have the sun, I have the beach, I have PO, I have all of these beautiful things. I work,
[54:09.810 --> 54:15.410]  you know, I, I'm so blessed, but even with all of those blessings,
[54:16.370 --> 54:23.410]  there's still, there's still fucking trauma and pain. And I'm not sure like, you know, that, that
[54:23.570 --> 54:33.170]  that dose, that, that trip, that experience, that exposure was, was what I had to do to, to not to
[54:33.170 --> 54:38.930]  be grateful because I was, but I couldn't get up every day, dude. I couldn't get up and be like
[54:38.930 --> 54:46.530]  excited for the day. I was broken. It's fucking broken. I was grateful. Yes. I still bless my
[54:47.490 --> 54:51.650]  I was grateful. Yes. I still bless my food every time I sit down and eat,
[54:52.450 --> 54:58.850]  but it didn't make me want to eat it. To be honest, I didn't fucking want to eat.
[54:59.970 --> 55:03.970]  You know, a lot of times I was force-feeding and that's when I got to the point where I'm like,
[55:03.970 --> 55:14.370]  holy fuck, man, this, this, this dinged me in a way that, that if I don't look at or, or
[55:14.370 --> 55:23.330]  deal with, or, or try to allow it to, to wash through me or, or evolve me, it's going to fuck
[55:23.330 --> 55:29.330]  me up. I'm, I'm going to fuck up. I'm going to become homeless or I'm going to, you know,
[55:29.330 --> 55:37.730]  commit suicide or do something fucking stupid. So, you know, if, if I can say anything to, to
[55:38.610 --> 55:44.610]  anybody listening your mental health is like really fucking important.
[55:47.810 --> 55:52.370]  We've all seen people crash and burn around us because they didn't deal with it. They, they,
[55:52.370 --> 56:00.050]  they didn't examine it or allow it to be they, they buried it or tried to hold it back.
[56:01.330 --> 56:06.930]  And, you know, our society as a whole is like, you know, how many people take antidepressants
[56:06.930 --> 56:12.210]  and anxieties? You know, that was the first thing that I did when I met Pauline was, you know,
[56:12.210 --> 56:20.690]  I was like, so, and I probably should just tell the story. All right. So I met Pauline at a cacao
[56:20.690 --> 56:28.690]  ceremony. So I didn't know what a cacao ceremony was. I was very into meditation and my particular
[56:28.690 --> 56:36.930]  meditation was a practice of not focusing on breathing, but focusing on the line between
[56:36.930 --> 56:43.330]  conscious and unconscious. So my goal was to get to a point where I was surfing the line
[56:43.330 --> 56:49.810]  between falling asleep and being wide awake. So my eyes are closed. I'm, you know, I'm,
[56:49.810 --> 56:57.250]  I'm breathing normally. I'm not focused on my breath. And I can literally with my eyes closed
[56:57.250 --> 57:03.010]  tell if someone walks in the room, who they are, what they're doing, you know, I got really good
[57:03.010 --> 57:09.810]  at this. And so this friend of mine, Harlan was like, Hey, there's this cacao ceremony. I, I,
[57:09.810 --> 57:13.410]  I want you to come. I want you to come as my guest. And I was like, all right, well, what the
[57:13.410 --> 57:18.610]  fuck is cacao ceremony? So we just drink chocolate. I'm like, well, how bad can that be drink chocolate
[57:18.610 --> 57:25.010]  and meditate? How bad could that be? Right. So I go to this ceremony. I mean, I rolled in like,
[57:25.010 --> 57:28.770]  you know, a minute late of stuffing this fucking egg salad sandwich down my throat
[57:28.770 --> 57:33.570]  because I hadn't eaten anything that day. And, you know, it's four o'clock in the afternoon.
[57:34.690 --> 57:39.730]  And I, so I come in, you know, disheveled, you know, trying to find my space. It's a crowded
[57:39.730 --> 57:43.970]  room full of people. And you basically roll out a yoga mat. And that's where you're do your
[57:43.970 --> 57:48.290]  meditation, whether you're sitting or laying down. In this particular case, they encourage you to lay
[57:48.370 --> 57:55.570]  down and they gave you yoga blocks for your head and stuff. And so I don't know what, I don't know
[57:55.570 --> 58:01.650]  what I'm, what to expect of this, but, uh, you know, being a spiritual being and understanding
[58:01.650 --> 58:05.010]  meditation, I'm like, yeah, this would be, this would be interesting. This would be a good
[58:05.010 --> 58:10.690]  experience. So I, you know, where they go through the process of blessing the chocolate and talking
[58:10.690 --> 58:17.810]  a little bit about cacao and where it came from and the power of this particular plant and the
[58:17.810 --> 58:27.090]  way it was celebrated or religiously used in, in ancient cultures. So you're kind of like, get your,
[58:27.090 --> 58:33.650]  your head wrapped around, you know, Oh, something's going to happen here. And so we all drink our
[58:34.450 --> 58:40.530]  cacao and it's bitter. And, you know, we, you had the choice of adding honey or not. And
[58:40.530 --> 58:46.370]  believe me, you want to add honey because the shit's bitter as day is long. And so then,
[58:47.010 --> 58:53.250]  you know, we lay down and so Pauline was the guided, she was, she was the guide for this
[58:53.250 --> 59:04.050]  meditation or the first one. Um, so she was chanting using, uh, singing bowls and, and
[59:04.050 --> 59:11.250]  rattles, light drumming, and speaking to the people who were all laying down with the eyes
[59:11.250 --> 59:19.970]  closed, meditating, guiding. Well, it was fucked up because she came into my fucking meditation.
[59:19.970 --> 59:26.770]  Like, I don't know how to explain it other than the fact that there was someone in my fucking head.
[59:27.410 --> 59:36.690]  And when the ceremony was complete, it was about an hour. Um, she brought you back. She said,
[59:36.690 --> 59:43.490]  okay, I want you to slowly, you know, come back into your body, feel, feel your skin,
[59:43.490 --> 59:53.570]  you know, feel yourself. Um, and so we were brought back into present and she said, okay,
[59:53.570 --> 01:00:01.170]  go ahead and sit up and come back. So I sat up and I looked at her in the eyes and was like,
[01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:08.770]  what the fuck was that? You know, I don't know you. I'd never met her before in my life. And I'm
[01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:15.410]  like, were you fucking in my head or was that me? And she goes, I was in your fucking head. And I,
[01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:21.010]  I've never experienced that in my life. And I've done this for years. And I'm like, well, what the
[01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:27.410]  fuck is that all about? Like, I wasn't swearing. I was just like, horrified. And the owner of the,
[01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:34.370]  the place Valley spirit, Christie, you know, like came in between the two of us. And I was
[01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:39.970]  in the front row looking, you know, probably five, six feet from her and said, do you guys know each
[01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:47.010]  other? And I'm fucking like, white as a ghost. I'm sure going, what the fuck just happened?
[01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:56.850]  What is this? And so I left, right. We did another session. Sean was the next guide.
[01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.970]  Went through that session. Everything was great. Got up left. You know, that was the end of it. I
[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:08.770]  never, never expected anything more to ever come of that experience because I, you know, I wasn't
[01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:20.130]  like into or needed alternative healing. So a year goes by. I slipped on black ice, broke a rib,
[01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:32.690]  cracked two, was in fucking horrible pain. Three weeks later, December 1st, I got out of my car,
[01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:38.050]  slipped on black ice, went almost underneath the car, fucked up my back, like to the point where
[01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:43.410]  I couldn't stand up. Like I was fucking done now for you don't know me. I have a disectomy. So
[01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:49.490]  that's where they take a disc and they remove all of the jelly from the center of the donut,
[01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.290]  so to say. And what happens when they do that is the disc above and below start to become
[01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.610]  over pressurized, exposed to
[01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:07.250]  inappropriate pressures because the disc that's below or above them is dead for lack of better
[01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:14.610]  words. It's not, it's no longer functioning. So I basically like crawled my way back into the car
[01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:20.210]  and drove myself to the ER and went in there and said, look, I need an MRI. I need a CT scan.
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:27.170]  I'm afraid I really fucked shit up. I'm in just horrific pain. You know, I literally dragging my
[01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:33.170]  leg. And they were like, no, we're not going to do an MRI. We're going to give you muscle relaxants,
[01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:44.050]  steroids, oxy and two other meds. So I had five fucking meds that I was told or instructed to use.
[01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:49.890]  So I went home and I laid in bed because that's all I could really do. And I popped these fucking
[01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:57.570]  pills for like five days. And then one night I got up and to go to the bathroom and I got
[01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:03.410]  almost all the way to the bathroom and my leg gave out the one that I was dragging. It just
[01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:08.290]  fucking let go. And I slammed into a bureau. I was like, oh, I'm going to have to go to the
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:15.650]  ER. And I'm like, this is not working. I'm worse now than I was the day I went into the fucking ER.
[01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:23.810]  And so I said, you know, I basically got my shit together, got up, got to the bathroom, pissed,
[01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:31.250]  and I was like, I'm going to go to the ER. And I was like, I'm going to go to the ER. And I was
[01:03:31.250 --> 01:04:01.170]  like, I'm going to go to the ER. And I was like, I'm going to go to the ER. And I basically got my shit together, got up, got to the bathroom, pissed, and went back, got a glass of water, and went into the guest bedroom and just shut the door. I plugged my phone in, in the other room, I shut it off. And I just said, I got to fucking clean up. I got to clean out here. So I spent three days meditating, drinking water, no food, no phone, no computer. Just fucking laying there, meditating.
[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:24.290]  At the end of the three days, I said, Okay, I need an alternative way to deal with this. And I know the Valley Spirit, they did, you know, all of the alternatives. So I got in my car, I drove down there, I walked in, Christy was behind the desk, and she looked at me, and she recognized me from the year earlier. And this weird experience that Pauline, one of her lead
[01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:53.410]  practitioners experienced, and she she goes, Whoa, you don't look good. I'm like, No, I'm fucked up. I need I need real help here. I have this health issue, my back is fucked up. And I'm coming off, you know, a very powerful mix of pharmaceuticals that that are not helping me. And she's like, All right, I'll get in with Jampa, he'll do acupuncture,
[01:04:54.370 --> 01:05:24.130]  and he'll do Chinese herbs, that'll help to detox you and start to move your energy into the appropriate way to heal. And then I'll put you in with Pauline, she'll do Reiki, which is healing, energy work, deep tissue massage, and restorative yoga. And so I basically spent four days a week, going to this place and spending three or four hours in treatment. And this lasted for
[01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:53.930]  about three or four weeks. And so in the treatment, you know, you you you start to get to know people because you're you're with them for extended periods of time. So this one day, Pauline's like, Alright, so you know, she's she's working on me. And and she's like, So what do you do? And I'm like, Well, I'm a soil biologist, soil engineer. And she's like, What the fuck is that? And I'm like, Well, so I look at your sand soap clay and organic
[01:05:53.930 --> 01:06:23.450]  matter. And I try to figure out the best way to infuse it with biology. So that your soil generates life, whatever it is you want to grow, whether it's, you know, whatever plant doesn't matter. And she goes, you work with cannabis? And I go, Yeah, of course, right? They tend to be, as a community, the ones that that truly understand the beauty of the
[01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:53.130]  plant and the soil and they want to, they, they, they, they love their plant. They're not like a landscaper, which is going to hack your fucking plants. You know, what is it called cut, blow and go? You know, they're, they're, landscapers don't appreciate the plants that they're trimming or cutting or manipulating or planting. They don't really care. Where cannabis people love that plant. They, they, they, they're all about it. So yeah, of course, I work with cannabis and
[01:06:53.130 --> 01:07:21.610]  cannabis cultivators. And so she's like, Well, I need that as a tool. This is what I do. And she explained to me how she was, you know, going through this shaman course, dealing with, you know, these plants that provide an effect to the human body or mind. And she didn't have, you know, this was Connecticut prohibition. So there was, she didn't have access to it.
[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:51.570]  So I'm like, Well, yeah, I can, I can get you whatever you need. You know, do you understand the endocannabinoid system? She had no clue. I said, Do you know the difference between THC and CBD? No fucking clue. So I'm like, Alright, you ever smoked weed? She said, Well, yes, I've smoked weed, but I end up convulsing and throwing up. And I, I don't like that. And I'm like, Alright, so you've had a bad experience with it. And and you, you overdose.
[01:07:51.610 --> 01:08:21.450]  On on it, if you had micro dosed, you wouldn't have had that, that experience of convulsing and shaking and throwing up. So we need to take it slow. And you need to understand what a dose is. And especially if you're going to be treating patients with this, you, you need to know how to be proper and responsible in exposure to this plant. You know, you can't just never smoke cannabis.
[01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:51.410]  And take a fucking dab, you're gonna be fucked up, you're gonna be traumatized. So we started with that. And so I'm working with her on my healing during the day. And then I would work with her later in the afternoon, or the next day or night, whenever I'm exposing her to the understanding of this plant and how to properly use it, especially with
[01:08:51.410 --> 01:09:19.440]  people that have never been exposed to it. And her clients were generally, you know, my age or some older. So they were brought up in this prohibition that that the plant was demonized, there was a gateway drug, it was, you know, it was problematic, and all that fucking insanity, the drug wars brought on.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:46.240]  And so we became, you know, friends, we ended up spending quite a bit of time together. And then there was this one time that, you know, I called her out. And I said, You know what, you're a beautiful spirit, but you don't know what you want. You, you are happy in your misery, if that makes sense. And she got mad at me.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:10:04.240]  And I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm speaking truth. I'm calling a spade a spade. I'm just I'm expressing what I'm seeing and feeling after knowing you for intimately working with you for, you know, the last couple months.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:31.240]  And I left, I went to work. And the next day, she came to my shop. And she walked up to me and planted a kiss on me. And I was like, Whoa, what was that? She goes, You're right. I was not acknowledging what I want, or what I like or what I attracted to.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:59.240]  And I was like, Okay, I'm not sure I'm ready for a relationship, but I'll try. You know, I'll be real with you. And that began the next level of relationship what I had with her. And again, you guys remember, she came into my fucking meditation, like, that's spirit, man. That's universe. That's that's crazy fucking shit.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:17.240]  And so our relationship started. And I was like, Alright, so if you really are serious about using this plant as medicine for your clients, then I need to show you what it's all about.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:38.240]  Like I had gotten her CBD crude, which has a little bit of THC in it. I got her CBD distillate. I was not into isolate. I told her that, you know, you don't want to fuck with that. And she was kind of playing with isolate because someone got it for a different person. Like you don't you don't want isolate. Isolate is you're losing the medicine, you're losing the plant.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:12:07.240]  So I'd gotten her those tools, but I hadn't gotten her like the hardcore THC extracts that you can make tinctures with other types of medicine. And so at that point, ironically, Corey, the guy that came here and hirados with me, Pauline had worked with his mother, and actually had provided her with some of the CBD crude for her, her patients.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:31.240]  And Pauline and her talked about it. And she said, Well, my son lives out in Oregon, and he makes these tinctures with with high THC. And I was when Pauline told me this, I'm like, Well, let's get him on the phone. Let's let's talk to him, see what he's all about. And sure as shit, you know, he does. He did butter extracts, he did alcohol extracts.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:58.240]  And so we formed a relationship with this kid, Corey, you know, very early on and on my relationship with her. And, you know, he was providing this this tincture, which was actually amazingly, not only delicious to take it orally, but it had a wonderful effect. It didn't make you, you know, fucked up, it just it took the edge off.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:25.240]  So it was, again, more of a micro dose approach than a macro dose. And so now she had THC in in low dose, and she had the her CBDs. And so I'm like, Well, you know, if you're gonna if you're gonna continue this, which you're obviously you're on the path now, I really should take you out west and show you the plant show you how to grow it responsibly. I love it.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:47.240]  So I took her to a farm in NorCal in more humble, actually, where I knew the head grower. He he and I met at the first region conference. And I understood his practices and his approaches to cultivating this plant. So I knew that his his work was clean.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:14:08.240]  So we went there, I met with Dan, introduced Pauline to Dan and and his boss. Beautiful spirit. She and her partner and her sister were all working on this farm. So, you know, we're hanging out,
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:30.240]  helping them cut down the plants and hang them in the barn. And, you know, Pauline connects with Jackie's sister and Jackie's sister's like, Oh, yeah, I always, you know, like I bless the products when when I finish them before I give them to people, because she made extracts with with some of the excess.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:59.240]  And so Pauline connected with her and they really jive together because Pauline is a very spiritual creature and always blessed everything, whether it was her food or her medicine. So they connected and you know, I was working with Dan like, you know, how you doing? What's the pest pressure like? You know, how is the season been? How is your plants doing? And then we spent like three days, you know, just talking about the plants and the plants.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:19.240]  And we spent three days there going through all the different extraction methods from butane to alcohol to, you know, short path, long path, distillation and and really showed Pauline from the soil to the medicine, what was involved.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:43.240]  She got it like she she got immersed immersion, like just totally fucking down the rabbit hole of regenerative organic cultivation of this plant. And then what to do with it after how to dry it out of curate how to manipulate it for medicine. And so, you know, it was a beautiful experience.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:16:06.830]  As a matter of fact, this picture came from our last day. We were down in in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco. I brought her down to a an aqua aquaponics facility there to show her more of my work.
[01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:26.830]  So she understood like the biological approach to to what I was doing, like showing her fish waste. This particular facility took the fish waste, put it in with worms and let the worms move through it. And then they took the sludge that was left and remineralized it, use it as a fertilizer.
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:48.830]  And I was like, well, they've they've done it. They've taken another step. Like I don't use worms. I just aerobically stabilize the stuff and then use it to to treat soil. And so, yeah, they've taken a little bit further, but they've lost the biology, but they don't need the biology because the biology is in the water that the plants are growing.
[01:16:48.830 --> 01:17:10.830]  So it's a different approach. I'm bringing aquaponics to you where they're using aquaponics in situ, in place. So she got the full like, you know, immersion from from soil, from sand, so clay and organic matter to biology to plant to to product.
[01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:34.830]  So it was a beautiful experience. And, you know, I think that was really what galvanized us as a as a couple and prepared us for this horrific journey, this horrific future reality that became part of my existence and hers.
[01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:41.830]  And so anyway, I I think the point that I'm trying to make is that.
[01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:45.830]  That it's going to be pretty traumatic.
[01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.830]  If you lose them and.
[01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:56.830]  It's fucking hard to bounce back, man. It's really fucking hard to bounce back from that.
[01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:00.830]  But it doesn't help with the fact that.
[01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:10.160]  I can't just fucking talk to her. I can't hug her. I can't kiss her. I can't hug her. I can't.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160]  So.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.160]  End of the day, I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.160]  But it doesn't help with the fact that.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:32.160]  I can't just fucking talk to her. I can't hug her. I can't kiss her. I can't share her energy in a way that that I did prior.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160]  So.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  End of the day.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:46.060]  What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.380]  what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right?
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.920]  Well, I mean, I can tell you when we started this to now,
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.520]  like just letting you talk and kind of talk through it and talk through, you know,
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.280]  the things that you've been going through and probably also just hearing yourself
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.200]  talk out loud.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.960]  There's definitely a difference in life when you're constantly in your head,
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.880]  talking to yourself.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.880]  And then when you're putting it on paper or you're out there speaking you know,
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.160]  as a conversation. So I think today, man,
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  as time progresses, this is also part of that. You know,
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.600]  you're doing a mega dose of therapy work in front of a bunch of strangers,
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.560]  you know?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.360]  But this community is starting to build up to where I think they'll definitely
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.840]  respect what you're going through. Try to relate with what you're going through.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.840]  Most of us probably can't and then try to you know,
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.200]  find ways maybe, you know, again, it comes down to,
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.360]  we've been talking about this a few times,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.320]  just respecting one another as human beings,
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.160]  realizing that most of us probably got some bullshit behind the scenes that we're
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.240]  trying to cover up. So all the little pettiness, the shit that we, you know,
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.160]  kind of for some reasons,
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.760]  some individuals kind of put up with, or it's just like, oh,
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.160]  that's how that person acts or reacts.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.720]  And then that just was always weeded out before social media and stuff.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.760]  People just wouldn't mess with individuals that were constantly causing drama
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.920]  or being just bitch ass individuals.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.480]  Where now that there's no checks and balances with that,
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.120]  you can't cut them off and they can't make any more money.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.440]  Cause everybody says, you know, fuck that guy. I feel like with social media,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.560]  there's just ways to continue that process.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.800]  So there's a full circle with this and like,
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.720]  I'm getting older late and I know it's, you know, things are, you know,
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.040]  I'm really focused on family. When I was younger, like I was saying,
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.280]  I felt like I pissed away a lot of hours. I had money in my pocket,
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.120]  but I had no goals, no dreams.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.800]  I fucked up my microbiome that it made me depressed. You know, I've,
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.000]  I've had definitely thoughts that I feel like most people that have been in my
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.840]  life, they would never think that I would think those things. But once I, again,
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.840]  focused on nutrition, rebuilt that microbiome,
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.720]  I do feel like that's part of the secret, not necessarily for you, sir,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.440]  but just people in general that live in an apartment, live in a city,
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.000]  never really go outside, eat poorly. They kill that microbiome.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.280]  I've personally done it playing, playing cards. Uh,
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.840]  and then when I focused on that,
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.720]  it was amazing how your thoughts kind of change in that you're not craving all
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.640]  the, it's just, you have to go through it to, to, to, I guess, believe it,
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.960]  you know, and the easiest way to start to see that is I've been saying that for a
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.120]  hopefully a year now is the autophagy approach of fasting.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.280]  And if you can do that, you'll see benefits. Uh,
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.800]  and then once you start to go down that rabbit hole,
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.000]  it's just on a whole nother level, man.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.200]  You start to understand why psilocybin probably is important.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.600]  I think that helps build the microbiome. Uh, there's a,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.600]  there's a reason why that kind of is, um, I don't know.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.480]  I don't know about you, man,
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.200]  but I have to kind of like prep myself or do lemon tech.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.920]  If I'm going to do a heroic dose, that's a lot of, you know,
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.960]  I don't enjoy ingesting mushrooms.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.720]  I know some people don't really mind that,
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.200]  but I personally don't like doing it.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.840]  I like to either mix it with chocolate or do like a lemon tech. Uh,
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.640]  but other than that, uh, it, it,
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.920]  it is on a, uh, another level because that's,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.760]  that's not something that you want to experience daily. You know,
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.840]  that's something that you build up to even, uh, you know,
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.000]  I have some friends that are micro dosing, but when I see them sometimes,
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.160]  it's like, Hmm, you took a little more than a micro dose today. Didn't you? So
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.600]  I personally feel like if you're really trying to get over something,
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.360]  micro dosing is where it's at. Uh, if not,
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.600]  I also am starting to focus on sometimes being sober, man,
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.640]  just having a sober mind, even from cannabis. I enjoy smoking on the show,
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.320]  but you know, at night I've, I've kind of stopped doing that at 8.00 PM.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.000]  Same time I stopped eating. I've noticed that my,
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.320]  some of my dreams are starting to come back and that also helps with mental
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.560]  health. I think maybe smoking cannabis late into the evening.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.440]  This is just totally me like shooting the shit here,
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.600]  but I think that fucks up your dreams or at least fucks up my dreams because I
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.680]  don't dream when I've been smoking heavy cannabis day in, day out.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.960]  And I have horrible sleep patterns. So just, uh,
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.600]  we took a huge right turn for the show today. So I guess, you know, givens,
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.760]  but mental health is extremely important, man.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.280]  And if you need to talk about it, then I think that, you know,
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:39.000]  the community's here for that because trauma is huge.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.160]  And like I said, man, the older that I'm getting,
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.560]  I realized that that most men don't have really anybody to talk about the deep
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.920]  shit. So you either got to take that shit in, do some psilocybin,
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.440]  maybe have one, one buddy that you really rock with,
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.160]  but it is hard to trust people nowadays. And you trust stuff with people.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.720]  I've personally had that where they push that, turn that against you, you know,
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.640]  little secrets that you've had in life where they they'll turn that and tell
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.560]  everybody about it.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.480]  So it's really hard for men to internalize and deal with something that you're
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.320]  going through. So again, man, kudos for you to, to,
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.800]  to finding out what works. And again,
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.240]  my personal opinion is psilocybin is where it's at,
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.520]  especially for somebody that can mentally handle larger doses.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.880]  That is definitely a new pill to swallow, man.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.680]  That that is the way to, to, to deal with things and use.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.600]  If you have to use something, I do feel like psilocybin is where it's at.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.640]  And I've personally seen, I wish I could get more back into it,
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.680]  but when I was trying to get out of my little slump or depression,
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.080]  I started focusing on yoga and just kind of just feeling good on a,
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.240]  on a whole general basis. And that seemed to help as well.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.440]  So I don't know if you've ever done that,
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.520]  but I personally probably should do that because it,
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.200]  there's nothing better than man. Then when you're able to do all those,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.760]  it was like a hot yoga class. You do the same poses.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.280]  So after like weeks and months go by,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.960]  it kind of felt like living soil in a way you could physically see like you're
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.520]  improving over time. The body feels
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.640]  Bikram yoga. I think that's what that's called.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.760]  You're in more, more into.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.320]  Yeah, but there's, it's like a 27 poses.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.640]  You do the same damn poses every time and whatever,
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.960]  however that gentleman figured that shit out, supposedly, you know,
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.040]  I don't know like more of the dogma behind it, but just go into the class.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.000]  There's a reason why you're doing those poses,
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  the same poses over and over again. And you can naturally feel that, man.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.920]  That, that helped me with sadness, depression, what, you know,
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.960]  just feeling good in general, man.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.040]  Yeah. You're getting back in touch with the body.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.600]  And the mind and the spirit. So that's, you know,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.600]  that's the focus behind yoga in, in where it came from,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.880]  the roots of,
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.880]  of trying to figure out the mechanics of the vessel to enlighten or higher or
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.520]  make the spirit vibrate higher at a higher level.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.160]  And that, that in many ways is like, you know,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.320]  both could be a martial art or can be a restorative way to build the body and
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.880]  heal the body. Yeah, that's yoga is some pretty crazy shit,
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.600]  dude. You know,
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  Pauline was very much into it and taught me a lot about it in a way that,
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.880]  that I have deep respect for it. I haven't been practicing and maybe,
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.680]  maybe that's something that I should start again. You know,
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.880]  because it was, it was regenerative. It was healing.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.360]  It's the only thing I've found where you can really quiet the mind.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.760]  Cause everybody's, you know, everybody's there to do the same thing.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.800]  So you don't have your kids yelling upstairs or, you know,
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.240]  whatever you can really just kind of get into it. And I'm getting, man, you,
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.880]  I'm glad you realize that you're going through trauma. Like this is a loss,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.120]  but at the same time, it's on a whole nother level because of, you know,
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.680]  the connection that you had. And that is something that it's going to take.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.440]  I mean, be real with yourself, right? That's going to take a while to heal from.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.720]  So I'm doing heroic doses. You probably have to do that several times.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.160]  And I probably will never heal. I mean, like again,
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.280]  I'm broken. I duct taped and wired myself with a coat hanger back together.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.520]  I'm still here, but that, that wound,
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.640]  that scar that brokenness, that's never going to fucking go away, dude.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.880]  Never. But yeah, through, through introspection,
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.040]  through reflection, through dosing,
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.720]  I'll maintain,
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.160]  I'll maybe even evolve. Maybe I'll get better as a, as a spirit, as a human.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.000]  But the loss will never go away. Like, like Robin,
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.200]  I mean six years later,
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:12.080]  she's still very much in a, in a state of,
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.040]  of loss. You know, it's,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.760]  it's not something that will ever,
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.320]  she can never be replaced in her life. Her husband will never be replaced.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:29.120]  And you know, I believe in her,
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.600]  her world. She's not even interested in looking for,
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:38.320]  for another partner. And that was, you know, that was part of,
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:41.720]  part of the work that I did was like, no, I'm not fucking interested.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.360]  I don't want to get into another relationship. I, you know,
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.200]  I, the thing that,
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.880]  that forced me to deal with it and to dose like that
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.080]  was the fact that I had no desire to
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.880]  make or have friends or,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.360]  or be involved in a relationship regardless of whether it was a,
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.680]  you know, sexual relationship or just a, you know, friend,
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.640]  no desire and no,
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.600]  no
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.760]  passion or happiness or joy in what I do. I mean,
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.520]  to me getting up in the morning and being like, Oh, what am I going to do today?
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.320]  I'm going to make compost or I'm going to, I'm going to make some extracts.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.400]  I'm going to, you know, get some clay silt sent out to the East coast,
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.960]  whatever that was passion, dude, that, that was like the drive.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.200]  And then when,
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.640]  when I realized that I just didn't,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.880]  didn't have any of that passion left, you know,
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.080]  I showed it outside. Like I didn't let anybody know that, that,
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.360]  that I was so fucking broken internally. I hit it.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.240]  That's when I realized I'm in trouble. Like if, if I don't deal with this shit,
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.120]  it's going to fuck me up. It's going to come out like the shadow effect.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120]  It's going to come out in a really negative way.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  I'm going to do something or hurt somebody or hurt myself or, you know, it's,
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.480]  it's not going to go in the direction it's supposed to.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.240]  And so fortunately I'm,
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.920]  I'm spiritual enough that I, that I can realize this shit.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.520]  Like I can say to myself, all right, you're fucked right now.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:37.480]  You got to deal with this. A lot of people I think are, are so,
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.880]  or they allow the,
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.360]  the effects of the world around them,
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.240]  drama, distraction, uh, neediness,
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.680]  energy vampires. They, they allow those things to come in and, and,
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.880]  and they don't properly reflect internally on themselves as to their mental
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.480]  health and their existence as to, you know,
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.560]  what is really important. And so, you know, again, I'm blessed that I,
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.320]  that I have that, or I am an empath.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.120]  I have these energy things,
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:25.120]  spiritual things that have occurred in my life that allow me to say,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.240]  okay, fuck, I am, I am in trouble here. And,
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.880]  you know, I, I'm not going to deal with distraction. I'm not going to deal with,
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.000]  with, you know,
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.640]  things allowing myself to hide from the fact that, that yes,
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.720]  I am in fucking pain. Um,
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.400]  and I think if, if anything is taken away from this,
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:51.360]  that hopefully people can like seriously look themselves in the eyes and say,
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.360]  Hey, you know, are you, are you being the potential you could,
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.800]  are you hiding or are you hurting? Um,
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.480]  and, and how do I deal with it? And, you know,
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.760]  self-reflection is the beginning, like, like yoga. It's the beginning of,
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.520]  of a, of a, of a path, a journey that,
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.880]  that will allow you to, um, continue on even,
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.000]  even after trauma, even after repression, whatever it is. Um,
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.760]  you know, it, it's fucking crazy, Brian.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.880]  The happiest people I've ever met in my life are poor. They have nothing.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.000]  And the most miserable people I've met in my life are billionaires.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.000]  They have everything. You know, it's like,
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  I think that the reason why the,
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  the people that have less are generally more happy is they're not controlled by
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.440]  the possession.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.560]  They're not controlled by who's going to steal what from me or what's going to
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.720]  break down and I have to repair it. Or, or, you know,
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:01.240]  I laughed at my son all the time. I'm like, yeah, what you own owns you, man.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]  Literally. So
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.960]  that's a fight club shit right there, boy.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.080]  What, what, what do you mean fight club?
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.880]  That's a famous line in fight club. What you own ends up owning you.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:19.080]  Wow. I maybe I, he's like talking about Martha Stewart and he's like,
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.120]  fuck Martha Stewart.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.480]  Maybe I need to watch that movie.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.880]  Yeah, man. If you haven't seen that in a long time, that's a,
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:31.880]  that's a fantastic movie. Um, but you need to find things that are just,
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.400]  you know, little improvements every day. And I, I believe in that.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.760]  Whether you're mentally strong and healthy,
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.040]  that's also important daily or whether you know,
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.240]  you're on the flip side of that and you're just trying to like, Hey man,
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.560]  I went outside today. I got groceries, took a shower, got my shit done.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.400]  You know, sometimes that is the win and just stack those little wins.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.000]  And that's, you know, from my experience,
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.560]  that's how you're able to pull that shit out.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:01.160]  And I hope that more men hear that shit because most of us will never talk about
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.680]  what we're going through. Uh, I know that, you know,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.680]  I've had losses and stuff even last year and late and I wouldn't,
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.160]  I wouldn't have the balls to sit here and talk about all of the things that,
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.120]  how it affected me and all that, you know? So again, man,
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.440]  kudos to you for just sharing. Cause that's tough.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.280]  I think for a lot of individuals, uh, especially, especially men,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.560]  to just sit there and talk about something that really affected them.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.880]  Well, you know, if that helps other people, cool. I mean,
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.200]  that's what I'm all about is, you know,
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.600]  when I chose to take this
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.280]  path of working with soil and working with people,
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.360]  it was not about money. Um, I had made money. I had, you know,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.880]  made a lot of money. I, I,
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.040]  I lost my wife because I made so much money and she became possessed with it.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.720]  And she became possessed with it.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.760]  So when I went through the divorce and came out of the other side of that,
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.200]  which was pretty fucking ugly, I mean, you know, I'm a family man.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.040]  I was all about my kids and my wife and, and you know,
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.960]  that's what I was taught, you know, to be a good person. Don't steal, lie,
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.440]  cheat, don't do any of those things.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.120]  Just be a good human being and all good things will come to you.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.560]  That's what I was brought up with. That's what I was taught.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.960]  And then to have my ex wife, uh,
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  basically just tossed me out and start saying these horrible lies about that I
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.840]  was an abuser and I, you know, was,
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.560]  was brutal on the kids and all this fucking crazy shit, dude.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  When I came out of that and was like, all right,
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.680]  what I'm doing now is not working.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.720]  What I need to do is do something that, that makes my soul,
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.800]  feeds my soul, not, not my pocket, not possession,
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.880]  but something that allows my spirit to be who I know,
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.400]  um, would make a difference. You know, that was a,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.960]  that was a powerful choice. And that's when I said, you know,
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.320]  I'm going to do something that makes me happy.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.320]  It doesn't necessarily make me a lot of money. And that's, let's,
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.400]  let's go back to the basics.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.080]  I think the money comes from that, man. It does. Brian, you're,
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.640]  when you have an abundance mindset and that's really hard to achieve,
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.680]  it's like faking confidence when you don't have it.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.800]  When you're in front of pretty girl, they smell that shit from a mile away.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.760]  And it's the same thing. I feel like when you're,
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.200]  you're kind of faking your work ethic or you're kind of just going through the
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.480]  motions. If you're actually out there with an abundant mindset, putting stuff in,
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.280]  however that shit works, still have no idea how that shit works,
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.520]  but people pop up. Somebody gives you a phone call.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.120]  Somebody hits you up in social media and says like, Hey, this dude saw your
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.880]  website. So, you know, it's just weird how, however, that,
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.760]  that math equation works in life.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.320]  And then that shit might take you years to be able to build that up.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.240]  But I do believe that it comes at some point when you're putting in the effort.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.080]  And that's for any individual, just putting in the effort, focusing,
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.840]  stacking those little wins. There's a guy I like to watch. His name is Wes Watson.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.360]  He was in prison for a long time. He talks about stacking little wins.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:17.520]  He's a little aggressive but reminds me of certain things in my past.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.960]  So I love listening to him. I feel like he has a lot of wisdom to say.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.680]  But he talked about depression, especially, you know, being locked up like that.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.960]  Heavy, heavy lockup. Stacking those little wins, man.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.280]  Just finding little ways to find happiness, to keep,
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.600]  kind of keep things moving where the next day you're trying to, you know,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.480]  he was even saying like with chess or, or, you know, with poker or something,
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.400]  just trying to be like, Oh, he beat me today.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.240]  I'm just trying to stack that win tomorrow. I'm doing my pushups. I'm doing.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.960]  So whatever those little things are for you to stack those wins, going outside,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.520]  you know, with your dog, being on the beach, you know, doing that on a daily basis.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:54.800]  That's how I feel.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.000]  You turn the tide to that mindset where you start to get a healthier mindset.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.080]  You start to realize it's like, yeah, man, I can, I can pull,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.280]  pull myself through this. And late night, I've never really, you know,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.360]  we've never even personally met just on the shit every single day or every single
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.440]  week. And you know, nutrition, man, I don't know your nutrition.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.720]  It seemed like Pauline took fantastic care of you.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.000]  You were getting sandwiches and shit, you know, mid, mid show. So just,
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.800]  I want to give you that as a, as a, you know,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.160]  a gift that I personally went through, man. Don't,
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.080]  don't neglect your nutrition when you're, you know,
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.480]  just all alone because that's, that's where I was, man, just kind of grinding.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.320]  And I didn't have family back then. You know,
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.880]  all my family's in Georgia. So it was just me out here dealing with shit.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.320]  And when I messed up my microbiome,
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.400]  that's where weird thoughts started to come into. And I believe,
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.720]  I mean, I don't, I don't have any white papers for you on this shit.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.240]  This is just what I experienced. But I do believe when you fucked that up, man,
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.240]  and you mess up that microbiome,
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.520]  there is some kind of shift in your mindset, the way that you want to eat the,
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.520]  the, you know, certain things, maybe even,
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.760]  I feel like I'm trying to run away from certain problems. So it was like, ah,
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.600]  I want to, you know, I'm going to get drunk as shit tonight and stuff.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.680]  That was just, there was a lot of heavy,
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.200]  easy alternatives than just doing a heroic dose again, you know,
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.160]  kudos to you and dealing with that shit.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.800]  Because most people have probably never even experienced all of the,
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.080]  the happiness that you can achieve after doing a, a,
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:36.960]  a trip like that and coming through the other side and kind of realizing that
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.560]  like, man, life is pretty deep,
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.880]  pretty special that we're fucking floating in infinite space.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.920]  And we're just on this like beautiful, perfect planet somehow.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.920]  And whatever your belief system is and all that. And, you know,
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:52.080]  but the fact that we're all just kind of here kicking it and figuring this shit
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.120]  out together to me is pretty cool. And again, buddy,
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.320]  appreciate you kind of showing the flip side of things.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.680]  Cause everybody now with social media either only shows the good things or
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.000]  pretends that everything is always happy. And that is not how life is.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.120]  And we don't support each other enough. I know that for a fact.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.600]  When people go away or, you know, like that's why I was always hoping
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.200]  to reach out to individuals that do get locked up.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.120]  Cause most people never reach out to them until they come out.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.800]  So there's just whatever your little prison is,
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.720]  doesn't necessarily have to be behind bars, but whatever's hindering you, man,
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.400]  you gotta remember to go outside. I think like going, you know,
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.800]  taking a shower, just, just little things like that, man, stacking those wins.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:40.440]  I'm not saying that you'll be the same guy.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.480]  I felt like we said that at the beginning,
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.080]  but you definitely give a lot to the community, man.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.120]  So if you need the community to give back to you right now, which, you know,
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  is what you're asking,
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:56.000]  then I hope that people hear that and in the replays and stuff and kind of just
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.080]  reach out. Cause dark places are hard to come through, man.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280]  I've definitely personally felt that stuff.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:06.960]  And maybe I'll talk about some of those things at some point too, but I,
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.480]  I almost took my own life.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.240]  So there's a lot of things that when you're dealing with stuff and you don't feel
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.480]  like anybody gives a fuck, there are people out there that do, man.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.240]  So kudos to you, brother. Hard to talk about stuff like that.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.640]  Yeah. I mean,
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.920]  if, if you don't,
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.680]  then you end up getting in bad places like you, you know, like your,
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.840]  your gut vinyl. I mean, you're spot on.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.640]  Food is medicine. And if you're not eating appropriately, you're,
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.560]  you're spinning down the wrong path.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.800]  That leads to other negative effects of your life.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.640]  So, yeah, I mean, I do that.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.120]  I don't know why, but I,
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.840]  I guess I don't give enough.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.040]  I don't give a fuck what people think.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.200]  I just, I don't care anymore.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:07.120]  And sharing is easy. I mean,
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.680]  and I don't think I deserve respect or,
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.960]  or appreciation for being honest or,
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:18.600]  or talking about this because I truly
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.600]  believe that it perhaps will help somebody else in their world,
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.960]  in their journey, whether,
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.760]  whether it's to do a hero dose or just to eat properly or to take the time to
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.520]  reflect on who the fuck you are and what you're doing. I mean,
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.760]  that was probably the most amazing thing that came out of the last two years was
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.160]  it was a statement Pauline made one day on the beach.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.040]  And I literally think it was just about a year ago.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.280]  We'd come through nine months of, of like, what the fuck? Like we're older,
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.240]  dude. Like to shut the world down was just not even a
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.880]  possibility. And she's like, yeah, you know,
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.880]  now everybody knows what it's like to live with cancer.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.280]  You could die any minute you get this fucking virus, you can die.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.320]  And so now everybody on this planet knows what it's like to live with cancer,
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:15.080]  to have a death sentence. And it took me back at the moment.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:18.760]  I was like, Whoa, what are you fucking saying? And then I thought about it.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.520]  And I'm like, Holy shit, you're, you're, you're right.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.280]  And so I think that
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.680]  so many people during this nine months, two years,
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.160]  whatever it's fucking been for every individual,
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.560]  cause a lot of people are back to work and you know, over this, this, you know,
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.120]  reality for the most part, they've gone on with their daily lives.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.000]  But I think that everybody in the world at some point over the last two years
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.800]  started thinking about, Oh, well, how am I affecting?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.760]  Because we all were, we were all shut down, locked up.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.560]  Like there was a lot of time for reflection. And I think that, you know,
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:05.680]  that's where the word woke was pirated.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.920]  And now the word woke means that you're an entitled person. And it's,
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:14.280]  it's not woke means that you, you thought about something,
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.000]  you thought about what you ate or, or your mental health,
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.960]  or your spirituality. You, you,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.440]  you took the first step in saying, who the fuck am I?
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.160]  What am I fucking doing? Why am I here? What am I,
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.000]  am I taking, or am I giving, or what is it all about?
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.640]  And that to me is the word woke is that you had a moment
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.800]  in time that whether it was your life flashed before your eyes,
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.360]  or you, you stop to think about your impact
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.360]  as a human being here. And now
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.720]  I think that, you know, that's both a beautiful,
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.720]  but terrifying moment in, in, in one's life, where you can,
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.400]  you can go off the deep end in a heartbeat. You know, you can get depressed.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.320]  You can be like, Oh my God, look around me. This planet's fucked.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.280]  Where is the species fucked? But you can also say, how, how,
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.440]  how can I better, you know, the earth is going to be fine.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.680]  We as a species need to get over that. The earth is going to be fine.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.320]  We're the problem. We're not going to be fine. We, we,
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.320]  we are drinking water, breathing air and eating food that is, that is
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.640]  detrimental. Um,
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.360]  um, and if, if you're blessed enough to be able to eat
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.520]  from the earth, uh,
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.200]  foods that, that are not in any way affected by,
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.680]  by the pollution around you, you're fucking lucky as hell.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.440]  You know, I, I, I read a, uh,
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:03.520]  a white paper on the gut biome of,
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.200]  of three different places to underdeveloped
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.880]  countries. Um,
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.400]  and then America and the way they showed like
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.520]  our health versus theirs, where, where they don't have pesticides,
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.160]  they don't have fertilizers. They're underdeveloped. They have no choice.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.960]  They drink from the river. They eat from the forest.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.560]  Their gut biomes were like a hundred times X times
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:38.240]  more diverse in the biology of their stool than,
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.480]  than the Americans, because they didn't,
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.680]  they weren't exposed to those fucking things. And, and you,
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.960]  you talk about gut health and spirituality and mental health.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.440]  They are all fucking connected, Brian. They're so fucking connected.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.560]  It's not funny. Why do you think Americans are the,
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.840]  are the population that uses more fucking synthetic
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.600]  narcotic, uh, pharmaceutical, whatever you want to call it.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:12.720]  We take more fucking pills than the whole world combined
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.600]  as, as a race, the American people, we use pharmaceuticals like
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:23.960]  they're going out of the fucking off the rails, whether it's vitamins,
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.760]  whether it's minerals, whether it's synthetics, uh, whatever.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.280]  I mean, and we have, we have
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:36.040]  destroyed our gut health and
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.560]  you're, you're, you're fucking spot on Brian that, that, you know,
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  your mental health is directly connected to your gut health.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.040]  And I truly believe that I really do. If,
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.320]  if you've ever suffered with causing, uh, just in inflammation alone,
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.680]  like leaky gut, I didn't have like all, you know,
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.320]  we've had people on the show that were talking about,
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.680]  they've had like IBS and all that. I,
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.800]  I've never experienced anything like that.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.720]  And it was horrific just dealing with a leaky gut and having like inflammation.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.800]  And from what I understand, uh,
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:12.960]  that's when a lot of things are kind of getting into your bloodstream stuff.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.040]  That's not even, um, breaking down necessarily. So just feel awful.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.040]  You feel tired all the time. Uh, so if you,
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.360]  if you really want to change your life around, I, you know,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.040]  I like to check in with some of my friends,
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.640]  maybe we should check in on just the future cannabis project in general,
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.480]  but you know, here we are, what, six weeks into the new year,
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.520]  like where's your head at? Are you focused on certain things?
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.840]  Have you already given up on all of those things? You know,
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:40.160]  you get excited for the new year. Uh, it is that those little wins.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.800]  That's why I think Wes Watson, you know,
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:46.400]  check that dude out if you're into that kind of, um, education. Uh, but,
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.160]  but stacking those little wins, finding ways where it's, you know,
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.120]  you might be held down, you might be locked down. There's, you know,
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.440]  a variety of different prisons, uh,
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:59.480]  but stacking different things to where you're starting to see the light. Uh,
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.000]  and if, if your major issue is just mental mental problems or something,
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.960]  maybe take a moment and, um,
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.280]  consciously look at your lifestyle, what you're eating, what's your sleep like?
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:14.160]  Cause if you go to any doctor, uh,
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.400]  more than likely they are going to prescribe some kind of pill or some heavy,
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.680]  like ambient or something. Now you're addicted to that.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.360]  Shit where let's go to the source. Let's find food the same way we find,
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.760]  um, solutions for us as farmers, as a community. Uh,
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:32.240]  there is a way for us as a community to also talk about, you know,
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.280]  the microbiome, like the, it really is the same thing.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.040]  Like when you understand building the microbiome in the soil system,
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.000]  and then you even take 50% of that and start to drink, you know,
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.120]  fermented foods, eat fermented foods,
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.240]  focus consciously on what you're eating on a daily basis.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:51.280]  You will realize real quick what it used to feel like,
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.960]  how good it feels to sometimes wake up in the morning, the cherry on top,
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.400]  which now it's probably got me excited is, uh, you know,
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.680]  maybe doing yoga a couple of times a week and like really getting the joints.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.840]  Uh, and then you just have a, a productive self.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.120]  And if you're the provider for your family,
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.960]  mental health is extremely important because without you, what are they,
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:14.080]  you know, a lot of people rely on you.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.080]  So make sure that you take time for yourself, um,
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:22.280]  and find ways to, to have cannabis as medicine,
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:25.400]  but also focus on food as medicine. I know a lot of us,
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.400]  especially growing up in the South, we were joking about it yesterday late.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.920]  You know, nobody taught us.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.120]  I would go to this place called checkers and get a 99 cent chicken sandwich for
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.240]  years. I thought I was eating the same thing as like, if you know,
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.400]  I thought chicken was chicken. It was just whatever they,
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.160]  theirs was a little bit cheaper. Had no clue. My, my parents,
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.320]  a lot of my people in my family are, are overweight.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.200]  We just had no idea.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.640]  There was no family education on, on food and medicine and stuff. So yeah,
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.560]  you know, you had to learn that as getting older. Uh, that's why I, I,
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:03.000]  probably obsessively teach my kids like when they have a bellyache or something
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.520]  like that. Well, how much candy did you eat? Uh, association.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.240]  No nobody taught me that stuff where I,
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.880]  to this day until I really got into the autophagy,
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.560]  I would crave peanut butter M&Ms.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.720]  Like I would fucking sit there like late at night and just be like,
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.480]  I don't want to go to the gas station. I would have these thoughts,
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.440]  like this weird ass thoughts, man. How is that? Is that me?
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.120]  Or is that the microbiome that yeast that a lot of people talk about that rears
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.880]  his ugly head at night? That's why you want those sweets and foods.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:36.440]  I personally felt that now did, did my ass get up and go get it? Yeah.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:40.200]  Sometimes, you know, so who, who was really,
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.840]  I was, I was weak when I was, um, you know,
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:49.040]  had really no purpose. No pocket, pocket book is good,
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:53.280]  but everything else in my life is absolutely in chaos.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:57.760]  And I had really no idea because I would just go out to eat or something or just
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:59.600]  kind of, I don't know,
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.160]  just not not really focused on day to day consciousness of,
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.920]  of health and mental health. And then once those months go by,
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:10.040]  it's kind of the same thing. It can spiral both ways.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.800]  So stack those little wins, man. I know,
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.720]  I know I am talking to some of you that probably reached out to me at the
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:18.960]  beginning of January. So I'm not going to obviously call you out,
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:22.640]  but I'm calling you out on, on this. Where are you at right now?
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.560]  I know that you're watching this right now. Like, where are you focused?
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.040]  Are you talking about the things that you shared with me? We, we, you know,
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.040]  we all have big dreams. I had no idea that I was going to be,
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.600]  I shared that with some of you about the isopod thing.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.200]  I had no idea where this shit was going to take me. Uh,
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.680]  and now it's taking me where I'm,
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:44.400]  I'm just at all of how quickly something can come from just a little niche.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.360]  So find your niche, find something that you want to wake up in the morning, uh,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.160]  and learn. If you don't have a skill, I personally went to Udemy,
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.680]  which is an online school. Uh, they have, uh, sales like every month where this
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.160]  shit goes from 200, $400 a class to 899, 1299.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:05.040]  Wait for that. Buy that class, teach yourself a skillset.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:08.240]  The main thing I personally feel like is e-commerce.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.880]  If you can find something that you can, uh, have an e-commerce business with,
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.880]  that is going to help you just because you're building something, you know?
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:19.160]  So if you don't have the ability to grow, I personally can't grow right now.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.240]  Late night I had to move because of a, you know,
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:27.960]  bullshit in my past, but the gentleman sued me, uh, for, um, you know,
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.800]  we bought a house together and he hadn't lived there for five years yet.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:34.480]  You know, he gets half of the money even to, you know, up to this point,
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.800]  even though I paid all that. So I, on the back end this whole year,
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.640]  I've had to deal with my own shit at the same time.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.000]  I just tried to keep it focused. You know,
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.960]  friends have even just weird shit in my life has gone where I've never,
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.360]  never experienced that before. And for whatever reason, it shimmied it down,
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.400]  shimmied it down. I kept my head down,
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.320]  especially focused on nutrition and just trying to be healthy,
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:59.280]  do some pushups every now and then lift some weights. Uh,
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.200]  and things have changed for me. Uh,
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.840]  and I hope that other individuals see that. And I hope Leighton that, you know,
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:08.440]  you sharing today will relate to individuals that,
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.880]  that are on a certain path of the community.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.200]  Definitely doesn't want to see you guys go down. Uh,
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:18.200]  and there are people here that there's enough people in this community where
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.640]  somebody has probably gone through some shit just like you have. I mean,
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.320]  there's enough human beings on the, that we've all had fucked up.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.960]  Things happened to us, thought fucked up things. Uh,
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.440]  but we've also had wonderful things happen to us in life. And so we gotta,
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.920]  remember that part too. When it's, when it's super dark,
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.320]  there are good things that happen. Uh, it's just, you know,
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:42.720]  ups and downs, man, that is life.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.000]  Nothing straight up, but nothing straight down either.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.480]  That was a beautiful rant, my friend. Beautiful. Um, I think the,
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.400]  the only piece you left out, which I want to throw back at you is soil.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.840]  Get your fucking hands dirty. Go make some fucking compost, connect,
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:03.600]  get grounded. Like,
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  I think the only reason I'm still here and healthy is because of the last 14
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.640]  years playing with, with compost and soil. Like I bathe in the shit, dude,
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.680]  I get covered with it. My,
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.920]  my clothes literally rot off my body because of all the biology.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.400]  You know, I, people, the job sites,
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:25.760]  they laugh at me because I come wearing these holy fucking pants because I'm
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  like, look, I'm not going to wear clean pants.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  I'm playing with organic acids and that shit's going to fucking eat the clothes
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:34.320]  that I'm wearing.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.320]  So why would I wear clean clothes or new clothes playing with this shit?
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.000]  But you know, I think that that, that right there,
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:46.680]  the connection to soil and healthy,
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:52.080]  healthy earth is the biggest factor that you can put into your life to bring you
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.840]  back into balance. Get eat the fucking compost, man.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.520]  If it stinks, don't touch it. If it smells really good,
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.160]  put it some in a glass of water and fucking drink it. You know,
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:05.680]  I, that was,
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.160]  that goes back to that conversation I had with that,
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:12.360]  with that chief of staff that he was like, Oh my fucking God, this,
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.760]  this could be a game changer in,
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.080]  in fecal transplant and putting gut health,
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:23.120]  just the basic biology to break food down so that the body has nutrition.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.840]  That's why they do this to,
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.400]  that's why they put the feces from one into another is because their body is
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.800]  not, can't digest the food. It can't, it can't accept the nutrition from it.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.520]  So if we, if we
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.520]  expose ourselves to healthy food,
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:44.720]  if we, if we
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.880]  expose ourselves to healthy soil on a regular basis,
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.720]  you are going to rebuild that biome by default.
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:00.800]  And you want to segue into, we probably owe the viewers a little,
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.000]  little talk on like you know, there are, there's differences in, in,
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:08.280]  in dust and rock dust and stuff.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.560]  When we first got involved in it,
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.520]  I felt like it was because of down to earth.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.360]  They had this product called Azomite and it's something like A to Z minerals
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.720]  plus trace minerals or trace elements. You know, it's an acronym.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.800]  From what I understand, it comes from one place in Utah.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.520]  So it's a very unique place. Right. But then at the same time, when
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.720]  people started testing stuff over the last few years it's,
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.880]  Azomite is usually like ranked third where,
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.880]  you know, more like basalt and that kind of stuff are ranked higher.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:48.920]  Glacial rock dust is from what I understand when it's a quality product
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.360]  usually comes in at number one.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:54.480]  So I wanted to kind of talk about those different things,
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.840]  what your thought process is on,
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.120]  and then maybe talk about the differences between buying those and then just
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.520]  going out, like you had mentioned, finding the Stevie Nicks, Stevie Nicks style,
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:07.280]  finding the landslides and doing it for yourself.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.360]  Yeah, no, that is important to understand.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.200]  Azomite about one third of it has value.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:21.400]  The rest is filler. I'm not saying that it's not an amazing thing.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.160]  It just has a lot of aluminum in it. And yes,
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.480]  basalt rock dust is way more valuable. And again,
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.760]  this is like, you know, being broken.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:38.040]  The rock was broken down to a point where now you can use it to remineralize
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.760]  depleted soils. And,
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.880]  and again in the dust form you are dealing with a surface area that can be
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.920]  colonized very easily by the microbes.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.200]  And the microbes are really the ones doing the magic,
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.440]  whether they're in your gut or in the soil or, or, you know, you, you,
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:06.600]  you are a fucking microbe. You're, you're,
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:11.640]  you're way more microbial than, than you are mind.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:21.720]  So the exposure to, to these things,
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.640]  these influences are really important. I mean,
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  if, if you took a tablespoon or a teaspoon of,
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:34.960]  of pure rock dust and ingested it,
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.400]  you would again provide minerals that your body is not getting from any foods
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:42.800]  that you're eating.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:48.080]  There was a big thing here in LA not long ago,
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.560]  and I'm sure Peter could talk to this, where people were eating clay.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.040]  Clay became a big thing that the big nutritional,
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.760]  like the Benignite clays and stuff. Is that what you're getting into?
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:04.160]  Nutritional clay. And there was,
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.640]  there's value to it, but everybody laughed and said,
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.440]  these guys are fucking nuts. Peter, you want to talk to this?
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:12.240]  I, well I don't, I, I, late in while,
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.400]  you may assume that I'm up on the wacky LA trends.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:19.320]  I'm actually not, but I do brush my teeth with,
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.960]  with clay toothpaste. There you go. There you go.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.520]  And I've never looked back.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:27.120]  And that was actually from one of the shows we did when actually Cheddar Bob,
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.760]  who's back in the chat was like,
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.480]  like that dude has the shiniest pearly whites I've ever seen.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:37.480]  Like what's his secret? And, and he mentioned a specific brand.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:40.400]  And I, that's my buddy Alex. Yeah. All right.
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.200]  So you remember exactly what I'm talking. So I, I,
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.080]  I bought that and I was like,
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:49.320]  six different ones. And I wanted to like make my,
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.960]  I haven't gotten to making my own yet, but I was like,
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.960]  I could just buy all this stuff in bulk and,
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.680]  and put it together. But yeah, no, I,
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:00.720]  I have not gone back to the crest,
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.680]  but I, I, I have yet to eat the clay,
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:08.040]  but I do brush my teeth with it and it's cool. It like, it,
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:11.280]  it does conceptually what they're saying,
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.840]  but it's not like it's like,
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.320]  it, it does conceptually what they're saying. And I,
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:23.560]  I believe it is like crest or,
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.960]  or any toothpaste like Colgate crest, whatever.
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.240]  It's basically stripping your mouth of, of everything.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.240]  So it's like taking the equivalent of like penicillin to kill
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.640]  everything in your gut, but you're also killing all the good stuff.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.000]  And it's almost like RO water, right? Like it's stripping out every,
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:49.520]  like all the minerals. So like if you use the clay stuff, I mean,
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:54.560]  this is my very non-scientific layman understanding of what's going on in my
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.200]  mouth right now, but, but my teeth feel clean. They feel great.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.480]  And I, I haven't touched like,
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:04.640]  wasn't there a specific brand he used?
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.760]  Yeah. And I had that brand.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.800]  Uh, so it doesn't really matter about the brand.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.480]  No, I mean, I just went, I bought like four days. I mean, I,
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:17.880]  I can do like a show and tell at some point of like, Oh my God. And actually,
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.160]  so, so one of them has like it, one of them has activated charcoal in it,
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.920]  which conceptually is good, but like,
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.920]  I can only do that in the shower cause otherwise I'm just making a mess
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.520]  everywhere. Um, Gemma's into my clay toothpaste.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.080]  Like she wants, she wants in on it. Uh, but yeah,
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.000]  they all have like slightly different. Um,
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.840]  like that one has the activated charcoal. Some have MCT or like coconut oil.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  Uh, some are powders like, like the activated charcoal ones, a powder.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.720]  So like if I open the jar up and like you sneeze or breathe hard,
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.680]  like it suddenly like a black smoke, you know, it's like, fuck that.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:03.400]  That's why I only do it in the shower. Um,
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.800]  yeah, I don't use it every day. Um, but that's good to know. Uh,
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.240]  it'll strip everything.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.640]  Well, you know, that's, that's the thing.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.120]  It's like you're a dosing on antibiotics. You're going to fuck yourself up good.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.560]  And people, probiotics are bullshit. All right. That,
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.760]  that was a whole nother thing that I was reading about in that paper about,
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.000]  you know,
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:31.200]  because humanity has woken up to the fact that, you know,
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:35.720]  we use too much antibiotics and that they're causing, um,
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  diversity to go way down in our systems that we should be using anti or,
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.320]  or, uh, probiotics. Well, probiotics, what is that?
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.560]  What, what probiotic is, is compost is healthy soil.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.480]  That that will reestablish your, your gut bio, uh,
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:01.180]  yogurt. No, you know, you're only feeding what's present.
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.040]  If you're missing that, you're not,
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:08.080]  you can't get it back without providing it into the system again.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:13.400]  And, and those mineral toothpaste are providing you with,
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.280]  with nutrition and something that, you know, that I learned a long time ago,
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.000]  which is really fucking bad-ass. If you think about it, your teeth,
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:26.280]  not only are they there to, to crush, to pulverize, uh,
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:30.360]  the things that you intake more importantly,
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.760]  the, the, the biome on your teeth, the, the,
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.840]  the living organisms send messages to your stomach about what you're eating so
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:45.080]  that it can, the stomach can properly produce the Amazon's to break it fucking
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:51.080]  down. That, you know, that again, is this like giant connection.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.720]  Who's in charge. You really think you're in charge of your body.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:58.480]  You really think that your vessel, your mind controls your,
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:01.520]  your vessel. No, your vessel is your best.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:08.200]  Okay. So, so here's a, to get specific, uh,
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:13.080]  the Fritz, so his uncle Harry's was the first one. Uh,
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.760]  and then I ordered Redmond,
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:20.480]  which actually is currently in the lead because the Redmond is more of a pace.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.320]  So actually uncle Harry's is a pace too. Um,
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.240]  and I'll probably order that again. The Redmond one right above it,
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:33.000]  the activated charcoal one is the one where like I can only do it in the shower
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:38.000]  and then this other one dirty mouth toothpaste. But yeah,
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.200]  you see here like bentonite clay. Um, you know,
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.880]  and then they each have different kind of like essential oils that are probably
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:50.800]  known for like antibacterial or anti whatever. Um,
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.840]  what, what, what?
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:59.000]  Sorry. There we go. All right. Um, but anyway, that,
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.600]  that was my deep dive into all that stuff and I'm, I'm happier for it.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:08.960]  No. Which one do you like better using both the Redmond or the uncle?
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.120]  What was the uncle's son?
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.880]  I like the uncle Harry's and the Redmond. Um, I like,
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.800]  that's the one I'm current. Well, I, I,
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:20.400]  I needed to get through the black one cause I was like,
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:24.680]  I just need to get through this so I don't have like the possibility of the
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:27.800]  mess all like, cause I also don't put, I like,
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.880]  I don't, it's also like the form factor, right?
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:35.960]  So I don't put the top on all the way. Uh,
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.520]  so I just kind of lay it on.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.520]  So if anybody else comes in the bathroom and like doesn't realize that it's not
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:47.120]  screwed on all the way and then like lifts it up and all this black powder just
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:51.200]  falls all over and anyway, it was stressful. That was, uh,
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:55.280]  these are the inner workings of, of, of, uh,
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.720]  my bathroom moments.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:03.640]  Well, TMI on the, uh, but yeah, so, so that, that one was only in the shower.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.080]  Thank you for sharing that either.
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:09.760]  Now I don't feel like I'm the only one talking crazy shit.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.800]  So it is crazy. I mean, just, uh, you know,
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:21.400]  someone said dentists are only interested in you coming back. Um, I mean,
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:25.920]  I don't think every doctor or dentist necessarily has like evil plans,
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:30.960]  but I do agree that I don't know why the crests and the Colgate's and all that
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.880]  stuff. Uh, yeah.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.280]  Or I do know why they suddenly dominate the toothpaste industry. Um,
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.960]  but I, yeah, like, uh, Elka and by the way, welcome back Elka.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:49.480]  Uh, I will call you later, but, um, yeah, like, like the baking soda.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:55.960]  I mean, so simple, right? And that's kind of, I think you said baking soda.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:01.480]  Uh, uh, uh,
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:06.640]  what was it? Coconut oil or something and something else. But, uh, yeah,
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:10.400]  I think that was baking soda and coconut oil.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:11.880]  Yeah.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:16.880]  Yeah. Which costs what? Like that's like one thing of baking soda lasts you a
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:17.720]  year.
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:19.920]  Right. Anyway.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.880]  Yes. I know I dunk my pace in the bat black powder,
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.360]  but tell me that you've never spilled some of it. Oh my gosh. Baby cake. Come
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.200]  here.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:30.960]  Come here.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.480]  I'm sure Peter, you weren't worried about yourself.
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:35.240]  You were worried about your children coming in there.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.240]  You know, we're throwing it. Oh,
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:41.440]  I was mostly worried about getting yelled at in the, uh,
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:45.920]  black powder got all over everything. That's right. From Hillary.
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:46.960]  Would yell at me.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.160]  Oh, just came in to say hi to do you see the doggy
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:01.440]  who else has cute chubby cheeks. Yes. You have cute chubby cheeks.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.480]  So should I, uh,
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.560]  get her up and get in the car and go into the play?
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:08.600]  You guys want to go there?
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:11.920]  Is it like a couple minutes away?
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.560]  No, no. It's probably half hour.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.320]  Well, why don't you go?
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:24.680]  What you should do is take some video and narrate and just remember,
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.160]  hold your camera this way. Not like an Instagram star this way.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.840]  Yeah. That makes a big difference.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.440]  We're television. Uh,
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:37.640]  what do you call it?
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.320]  It's like landscape, right?
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:46.800]  All you have to do is hold your phone like this.
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:48.640]  And it works.
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:53.280]  Yes. Just don't walk around like this.
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.080]  All right. So, but in the car, it's going to be in a stand like this.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.120]  Maybe I can turn the car.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.000]  Well, no, I would say we could probably call it a day.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.560]  Cause I got a bunch of stuff to do, but, uh,
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:10.960]  I don't think we need to Peter. I'll send you a video from the place.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.120]  That was the entire point I was trying to make is just to take a five minute
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:19.280]  video and just talk. And then, uh, when you're home,
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.000]  you can email it to me or upload it to,
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.120]  we'll figure it out on the backend. But by the end of your trip there,
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.640]  you will have one to two video files on your phone.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:33.720]  And then I'll just,
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.200]  I'll just email them to you and you can attach it to this,
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.360]  this, uh, session.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.720]  I feel like we got to do this one again, late and it'd be fair.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.440]  We'll just kind of get back to this one.
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:47.120]  I feel like it'd be like,
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:50.280]  if I promised my kids ice cream and I gave them Brussels sprouts,
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.640]  that was the episode was, it was like,
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.200]  it's good for their health.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.080]  Do a deep dive into, uh,
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.840]  into the nuance differences between all these things and no, no, we're not
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:07.480]  going to give you some life lessons.
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.440]  Yeah. Uh, well, you know, I guess it is what it is. Um,
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:19.320]  and you know, thank you for letting me data dump or emotional
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.760]  dump today. Uh, but yes, we will,
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:27.400]  we will do another session on, on clay and silt and,
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:32.240]  and the incredible value and power they have in whether you adjust them or
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.760]  whether you provide them for
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:36.800]  actually, what would be cool is when we do that,
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:39.000]  if you just had a little bowl of each one,
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.800]  like the things you're going to talk about.
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.640]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm always a big fan of props and, uh, visual aids.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:49.280]  That was the whole goal of going to the fucking mine.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.560]  So bring some back.
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:54.360]  I will. I actually loaded buckets and shovel,
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:58.480]  I have shovel in my car because I'm going to bring it back because I just sent
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.720]  out the last bit of it. I had to, uh,
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:05.400]  to different people who are trying to build the horizontal soil systems in the
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.000]  winter. I just didn't have access to it.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.040]  The title of today's show is a metaphor.
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:11.480]  Yeah.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.880]  This was clay and silt layers of live show today. There you go. Cheddar Bob.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:19.840]  There you go.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.600]  This show is descriptive by far.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.240]  We just live just went.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.600]  All right. Well I got, uh, I got baby cake in the background somewhere,
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.840]  so I'm going to go hang out with her, but, uh,
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:39.080]  Hey Peter, real quick. Have you ever seen the four moms, uh, brand?
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.000]  I just learned about this.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.480]  You can like set it to an app on your phone and then it'll rock the baby.
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.920]  But you can do like tree swing or, uh, wait, what?
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.720]  I'll have, I'll do a little video later on. Cause it was blowing my mind.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.920]  Oh, the technology for kids.
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.800]  What is it a, uh,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.680]  It's like an electronic baby thing.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.680]  And then my wife got this like bonnet thing too.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.720]  So that it moves for the baby. It blew my mind.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.520]  I might've been too high last night. You know,
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:13.680]  to me, I was like, I want to ask Peter this. Cause, uh,
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:15.720]  you having three kids, I don't know if you've ever seen that.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:17.840]  The Nanette, uh,
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.240]  that's kind of the most technologically advanced thing we have,
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.640]  which is, it's just a camera that it's an over, it's, it's, uh,
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.120]  an unnecessarily expensive camera that like monitors all this stuff.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.600]  And I'm like, why do you need to monitor all that stuff?
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.920]  And she's actually never monitored any of it, but it's a camera. Like I can,
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:45.360]  I can look on my phone and see the, the, like the kid rolling or,
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.600]  you know, current Val, well, Valentina just, this is a big, uh,
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.240]  big move in the family. Valentina finally, uh,
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.200]  moved from the crib to a little bed. Um,
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.760]  so she no longer has a little camera over her crib,
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.720]  but Carolina has a little camera,
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:05.280]  but I feel like you could just get any cheap
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.800]  camera. Yeah. It's a baby monitor. But, but the Nanette is like,
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.440]  it's an unnecessarily expensive baby monitor. I mean, it's probably,
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.480]  I don't know how much it's probably like 150 bucks, but it's like,
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:25.280]  you could get one for 30. Like I could just get a USB camera and
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:27.520]  anyway.
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.840]  Well definitely post something about that thing that blew your mind.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.120]  Cause I don't get it. It's a, it's a crib or a cradle.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:39.800]  It's like a rocker, I guess. It looks like a spaceship to me.
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.440]  That's why when my wife brought it home, I was, I was kind of Chuckler.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.440]  Like what I was talking about yesterday is,
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:51.440]  is what I loved and I guess in modern mommy stuff,
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.080]  it's like, you're not supposed to do this, but the, the thing where like,
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:00.520]  before your kid can walk,
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  you put them in like the bungee thing and let them like bounce up and down.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.000]  And, uh, I mean, I, I, I always think kind of modern,
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  like parenting advice that like becomes like trendy is kind of,
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:21.640]  I'm just like, y'all don't know. Like,
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.800]  yeah, you're going to raise your kids.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:28.480]  Like it's like, Oh no, we don't do that anymore. And it's like, ah,
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:32.880]  like people have been doing whatever that is for thousands of years,
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.840]  I'm sure. Yeah. Or it'd be things like, you know,
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:39.320]  like don't let your kid sleep in your bed or like, you know,
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.320]  let your kid cry it out or, uh, you know,
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:46.600]  whatever it is. Um,
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.640]  it's like, what's the science behind that? Like probably not. Uh,
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:57.680]  but things become trendy and, you know,
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.840]  mommy Facebook groups. And
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:06.280]  so anyway, that's, uh,
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:10.960]  I shank my boys as I watch like kids and kind of like,
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:14.040]  like I've never thought about kids as much as I do now.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:17.200]  Cause now I have kids obviously. Yeah. So disbanded,
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.800]  disbanded does not think about these things, but I just find some of like the,
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:25.960]  the, you know, like there are books on like parenting and,
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:30.040]  um, I'm just kinda like,
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.800]  I'm more of a wing it kind of person.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.800]  Well, I think, I think the best things come out of, uh, not over,
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.880]  just loud, whether it's loud. Yeah.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.480]  You know, it's funny, like, you know, I used to laugh about this shit,
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:50.560]  but it's really
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.360]  kind of deep. If you think about it, when I would get my kids,
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.160]  when they were young, um, Christmas presents, right.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.600]  You played with the fucking box. Like
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.600]  all we needed to do was give them a box. We didn't need to buy something,
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.160]  you know, and they had a blast with it. You know,
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:12.440]  they climbed in and out of it, turn it into a fort, rolled around. And it,
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:15.640]  they was, you know, it became, you know,
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:19.240]  a thing that allowed them creativity.
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:21.840]  To using their own mind to entertain themselves, not,
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:26.000]  not the thing that was in the box. It was the box that allowed that creativity.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:29.320]  So I think in many ways, parenting is,
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:34.320]  is we've been taught that we need to focus on material things.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:38.400]  And in reality, those really aren't what the kids want. They, they,
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:42.160]  they want to be creative. They want to be able to, you know,
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:47.160]  play with the, the, the shape or the box for lack of better things.
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.680]  And that is more entertaining than the fucking toy that was inside of it.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:56.000]  I know. Yeah. And I like with Gemma, when she was like one and two,
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.200]  I was like, if I just throw something crinkly in front of her,
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:03.040]  she'll like play with it for hours. Like, um,
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:09.480]  what? We lost Brian. Brian hit the wrong button, but, uh,
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.400]  and by the way, so if, if, um,
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.480]  Mr. Toad's still watching,
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.760]  I would still love for you to fire up channel two tonight if, uh,
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.720]  you're down for it and bring on the Motley crew. Uh,
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:28.600]  that's my house. Oh, my other housekeeping is, uh,
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:33.600]  what, what, what is, uh, this is,
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:37.720]  so what I want to do with this is we're doing this at the townhouse in Venice.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.160]  So Layton, you should definitely come. And, um,
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.440]  but I want, I'm hopefully going to live stream the whole thing.
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.560]  So I have a John from snow, high seeds, uh,
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.480]  and Tyler family tree.
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:55.440]  And I just reached out to Mel Frank to see if he'll come, uh,
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:00.440]  to have kind of a breeder round table and then interview jogoon and then his
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:05.320]  eight piece reggae band is going to play for about an hour and a half. Uh,
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.680]  so if I can't stream it live,
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.440]  um, then it'll just be online the next day.
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:15.840]  But the, that's the goal. And then this weekend at the, uh,
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:18.840]  the Humboldt seed swap, we're doing the same thing.
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:22.640]  So there are a couple of panels and then a band playing after,
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:25.640]  but that's not going to be live, but the video will be,
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.640]  I think Trevor's emceeing one of the panels and, uh,
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.840]  Trevor sun grown mids and I forget what the other one is, but, uh,
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:37.440]  anyway, like when we're talking about, so for me, it's like,
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:43.400]  if, if I could make my work be stuff that,
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:48.520]  like if I could hang around and smoke good weed and listen to good music and
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:50.440]  hang out with people I like, and then like,
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:55.120]  when I don't feel like dealing with anyone, I can go to like my greenhouse and
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.840]  play with my plants. Like that's, that's what I'm.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:01.000]  And it's like slowly pushing me to do that.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:05.840]  That's what I'm. And it's like slowly pushing my vision forward. Uh,
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:10.920]  but anyway, the music thing would make me very happy.
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.200]  So when we talk about happiness,
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.680]  if I can have like cool LA bands of which there are many,
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:20.840]  uh, come play, um,
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:23.720]  that is a place.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:24.920]  This place in Venice.
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:27.880]  It's in it's the townhouse. It's been,
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.920]  it's a speakeasy that's been around since like the late twenties or whenever
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:34.920]  prohibition was, uh,
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.360]  it's literally almost a hundred years old. Um,
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:45.400]  so I used to do events there before, um, uh,
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:50.960]  shit got shut down and that's why in the background I kind of want to get my own
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.600]  square box, which, um,
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.880]  like the greenhouse and Camarillo, I'm still,
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:03.640]  I'm still waiting for someone to move out, uh, who's taking his time evidently.
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:04.840]  And, uh,
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:10.720]  but there's a 1500 square foot spot in the Santa Monica area that after this
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:17.120]  first event, I'd like to lock down, but it's, uh,
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.240]  it's kind of a scary finesse. I mean, it's not hugely, well,
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.880]  it's definitely a chunk of change, but it's,
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:28.920]  it's like can you take a square box and make it throw off enough money to cover
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.160]  your costs? You're not stressing out over it. That's kind of the goal.
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:37.040]  But I think I can make it happen. So
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:41.280]  if anybody could, you could Peter, it is, it is pretty hard to get,
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:44.400]  we're throwing all the expos here in Denver and stuff.
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:48.600]  It's really hard to get people to pay you money. Yeah.
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:51.760]  But you got one hell of a platform. So I,
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.960]  I would imagine if anybody could do it, man, you would definitely have it.
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:58.920]  Well, I locked in sponsor number one for, uh,
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.000]  for that event. I figure I'm like,
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.920]  if I had four sponsors and whatever, it's like it covers,
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:07.400]  like the band is thing.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:11.880]  I gotta pay like a thousand bucks to the band or it wasn't the band.
[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:16.480]  It was the main guy. We'll do it for free. But, uh, he's like,
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:18.720]  I could play acoustic guitar, like, and,
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:22.760]  or I could get like the whole band. And I was like, let's go big.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:26.000]  I'd rather do it right. Then like, I mean,
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:31.120]  the difference between the eight piece band and like the
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:33.480]  lead singer pulling out his acoustic guitar,
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:38.520]  dramatic. Yeah. So I was just like, let's do it.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:41.680]  And let me go find some sponsors to pay for that.
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.080]  Is there a place on windward up?
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:48.960]  It is. Okay. Have you ever been there?
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:52.760]  Probably not. I've been here for two years.
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:55.400]  All right. You've been here only during COVID.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:59.200]  Right. So I have not explored or, or, you know,
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:01.040]  how far is that for you?
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:05.360]  About an hour and 17 minutes or something
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:08.800]  where I am. Yeah. An hour and 17.
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:13.800]  I don't know about you. That's, that's really nothing for me, but
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.160]  maybe we should go for that, man. Go, go.
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:27.000]  Yeah. I have some friends sending some weed down from humble. So we'll have,
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.600]  uh, some other people bringing some of the local wheat. What's that?
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:33.360]  Isn't that seed swap with Joey?
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:38.000]  The humble. That's this weekend. Yeah. That's a Saturday.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.320]  Yeah. Where's that? Shout out to him, man. That's in humble.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.000]  Oh, that's up there. So you going up there?
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:49.480]  No, no, no, no, no. I, uh, the, the three kids, uh,
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:54.200]  there was a ball and chain on my ankle. That's mostly this garage.
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:56.240]  I don't travel very far from it.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:02.360]  And, uh, but yeah,
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.000]  originally Gemma was supposed to be with me this weekend,
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.800]  but now she's with her mom. So I'm like, I could be like,
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:09.600]  I need to go up to humbled,
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:13.520]  but I don't think my wife would be very happy if I was like,
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.000]  good luck with the two kids.
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:20.840]  Yeah. Right. That's probably not going to go over well.
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:22.440]  No.
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:24.640]  Put them in the four moms thing. Hit the app.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:30.960]  All right. You guys just need to be relaxed in these, in these, uh,
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.720]  rockers for 24 hours.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.400]  This is like the baby Yoda bucket container where, you know,
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:41.440]  the little crib thing that floats. You guys watch Mandalorian.
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.720]  It definitely floats. They're like, I'll show you here in a couple of hours.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.200]  I'll make a little video.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:48.480]  Cause I'm blown away.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.920]  Next week show and tell Leighton will have sand, silt, clay,
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.360]  uh, rock dust, and Brian will have a baby rocker.
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:24:59.640]  What could go wrong?
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:03.080]  Hey, we're talking about important stuff, right?
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:04.040]  Yeah.
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.280]  Yeah. We could, we could have the bait. We could have, uh, yeah,
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:14.280]  I always wanted to do like the, the parent kid conversations,
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.280]  uh,
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.920]  one weed, but, uh, yeah, we could do sand, silt and clay too.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.200]  Home gardening with the kids.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.320]  Uh, when, when Peyton Manning,
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.200]  we use the word Omaha and it could mean anything at any time.
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:35.400]  Right. So I feel like sandstone clay will be coming for this episode.
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:37.840]  Shit, man. We're talking sandstone clay.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.720]  That family is killing it, is killing it with a retirement TV commercials.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:49.160]  And like even the brother and the, the, the, what's the oldest brother's name?
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.760]  There's Eli Peyton. Uh, and then the brother,
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.160]  couldn't play football beyond college. And then the dad, and they're like in every,
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:05.880]  like every day I see a commercial with at a minimum one of them.
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.400]  And a lot of times now it's all four of them in the same commercial.
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:13.280]  Well, they're trying to buy the Broncos. So let's hope they do.
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.200]  There we go. Cheddar Bob.
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:16.840]  That's what I said, man.
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.000]  I didn't hear it. Yeah.
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:24.840]  Archie Manning. Uh, that, that is like a father of fathers. It seems like.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:28.080]  Well, I'm sorry. I'm talking the brother. Uh,
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:29.960]  Oh yeah. He's the father Archie.
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:33.800]  Hard to remember their names. You see when they don't play pro,
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.640]  that's the sad part of life.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:39.800]  Cooper. No one remembers second place. Cooper Manning.
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:46.440]  Interesting. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Roman reckless with the, this is like a,
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.840]  what's the show where you get to throw out a lifeline?
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.320]  Whose line is it anyway?
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:54.040]  No, no, no. Is it the, yeah. Is that what it is?
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:57.920]  The game show where like you can like call someone up.
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.680]  Oh yeah. What is that one? Oh, the lifeline.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.520]  Yeah. I mean, I don't watch it, but I know
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.920]  Jimmy crack corn. I see your comment.
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:12.720]  Right. I can hear you.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:16.640]  We got all sorts.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:21.720]  I love like the 18 different conversations in the chat. People are talking.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:23.360]  Everything.
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:25.560]  Fox news and MSNBC.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:30.520]  And maybe not, maybe not. I just see Trump, Fox news, Hannity.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.280]  So Mr. Toad is on there.
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:37.080]  I saw he popped in and said that he was, I guess,
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.880]  down for tonight and that he reached out to the other guys to see if they could
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:42.760]  show up. There he is.
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:48.000]  Yeah. He, uh, with, uh, hopefully cheddar Bob,
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.440]  maybe, um,
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:55.120]  our boy from Sacramento sack town who was in the chat
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:59.560]  earlier. And, uh, maybe we'll have a blue, green tank sighting.
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:02.840]  Can talk about the,
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:08.120]  the trials and tribulations of running Maine's finest
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:10.800]  licensed cannabis dispensary.
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:12.560]  There you go.

[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:41.560]  Feels good though. Right, Peter?
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:44.080]  Like you enjoy your food a little more when you wait.
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.200]  Yeah. But now when I do that every day, every day, I'm like, fuck,
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:48.560]  why haven't I eaten anything yet?
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:52.320]  It's four in the afternoon and I still haven't eaten anything.
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.120]  And I've licked like fucking licking like.
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:58.560]  What are these things?
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:03.020]  The problems he has,
[02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:06.420]  how's that all those like the the number of these things
[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:10.140]  that I lick on a daily basis, because like if I only do one at a time,
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:11.740]  I'm kind of like what?
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:15.260]  Like I also have a little sponge that I get wet so I can dab it.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.380]  But if I'm like, oh, it's just one, I like lick it.
[02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:20.660]  And then like 10 minutes later, I'll be like, oh, it's just one.
[02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:21.340]  And I'll lick it.
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.460]  And then 10 minutes later, like you say, I'm just like, I feel dizzy.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.380]  So I'm about got bio damage, dude.
[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:32.140]  Stop licking those fucking things.
[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:35.180]  Yeah, doesn't some of that stuff like have cancer causing?
[02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:37.340]  I'm sure. Yes, I'm sure.
[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:40.140]  And and the sponge actually was right over there.
[02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:42.300]  I think it's inside now, but.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:47.780]  Yeah, I'm in full support of the sponge,
[02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:52.060]  and that's why usually I'll try to set it up where I do like tons at a time.
[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:54.460]  So I'm just like dab, right?
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:58.740]  And then I have my like I have all different things.
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:30:02.620]  So once I like fold it over, I need to put something that has weight on it.
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:04.780]  So like so it just stays down.
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:08.220]  So I'm like finding all different like, you know,
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:12.820]  I'll stick one under here, one under here, like slide them under my computer.
[02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:17.420]  Dude, all you need is those little things that you put your snack bag.
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:20.300]  You know, the little like, give me one second.
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:27.740]  We used to use the little like crack files that you can buy at the heady shops.
[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:30.060]  They'd like these little glass and had a screw top.
[02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:31.300]  You can put like 10.
[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:32.740]  There you go.
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:34.380]  And then you just keep.
[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:36.340]  Oh, we got those two.
[02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:37.660]  Yeah, I have this one.
[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:41.740]  I have this one big candle that just it's like super heavy.
[02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:45.260]  So I just I put them like all around the outside.
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.100]  But anyway, again, the inner where you guys
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:53.020]  have learned about my my shower toothpaste routine.
[02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:58.900]  My your dietary issues with envelopes.
[02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:00.100]  Right.
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:03.100]  Did you definitely need to play?
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:11.220]  I'm going to say then it all ends up.
[02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:15.420]  Yeah, so here we have this was the most recent harvest we got.
[02:31:18.490 --> 02:31:19.530]  You can.
[02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:22.970]  The flower or seed.
[02:31:22.970 --> 02:31:25.090]  It's seed of radish.
[02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:27.130]  OK, so it's rat tail radish.
[02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:31.730]  So, you know, I had a rat tail when I was a little kid.
[02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:34.130]  I had I had.
[02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:37.050]  How do you say you grew up poor without saying I'm more at a mullet?
[02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:41.330]  Yeah, I think I had a rat tail for a minute, but it was.
[02:31:42.330 --> 02:31:43.330]  That's embarrassing.
[02:31:43.330 --> 02:31:45.810]  I can't believe my parents would do that to me, you know?
[02:31:48.370 --> 02:31:49.530]  You know what happened to me?
[02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:51.970]  Anytime I got out of line, they fucking shave.
[02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:55.250]  It was crazy.
[02:31:55.530 --> 02:31:58.050]  They called it a crew cut, but it was more punishment.
[02:31:58.130 --> 02:32:00.650]  And my dad would always say, as soon as your hair gets long,
[02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:03.090]  we get out of control and fucking shave.
[02:32:06.570 --> 02:32:08.930]  You had you had the how we long crew cut.
[02:32:09.890 --> 02:32:12.930]  Did they fucking any time like any time
[02:32:12.970 --> 02:32:16.170]  my hair got past a certain point, they'd fucking shave.
[02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:20.370]  And I'd be embarrassed as fucking hell going into school the next day.
[02:32:20.970 --> 02:32:26.650]  But yeah, and so into the mean hallways of DS Regional High School.
[02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.690]  Yeah.
[02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:33.210]  Dover, Sherbourne, what what what was the the mascot?
[02:32:35.130 --> 02:32:37.690]  So I don't remember.
[02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:42.850]  I do. That's a great question.
[02:32:44.130 --> 02:32:45.690]  Was it a horse?
[02:32:47.250 --> 02:32:48.890]  That's it's a possibility.
[02:32:48.890 --> 02:32:50.130]  A bird, a horse.
[02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:52.970]  Oh, you so do you remember what it was? No.
[02:32:58.890 --> 02:33:01.890]  Let's see. Yeah, I would say that's a trivia question.
[02:33:02.090 --> 02:33:05.090]  I was going to I was about to say someone should win something.
[02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:08.890]  Of course, now people know what we're talking about.
[02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:16.610]  Yeah, the name was the Raiders, but I don't remember what the mascot was.
[02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:19.850]  I'm on the website.
[02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:21.090]  Raiders.
[02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:24.650]  It's a terrible athletics.
[02:33:25.210 --> 02:33:28.290]  Well, it's the Raiders, so it's a
[02:33:29.570 --> 02:33:32.610]  it's a guy in a like medieval knight.
[02:33:35.730 --> 02:33:37.770]  That was our mascot. Yeah.
[02:33:38.930 --> 02:33:41.730]  I mean, maybe it wasn't when
[02:33:41.730 --> 02:33:43.930]  no, it's better than ours, man, we were the Comets.
[02:33:44.810 --> 02:33:46.450]  No, we were definitely the Raiders.
[02:33:46.450 --> 02:33:48.530]  I remember that, but I don't remember that.
[02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:49.970]  I don't remember that.
[02:33:49.970 --> 02:33:52.770]  We were the Mustangs.
[02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:55.570]  And then at Brown, it was the Bruins.
[02:33:55.570 --> 02:33:58.650]  But then people were like, but that's a male bear.
[02:33:58.650 --> 02:34:00.610]  So we just became the brown bears,
[02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:04.530]  which we went from the Bruins to the bears.
[02:34:08.690 --> 02:34:10.730]  Oh, God, look where we've gone.
[02:34:11.290 --> 02:34:13.970]  Anyway, we're all over the map today, right?
[02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:17.210]  Yeah, we need to have a.
[02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:22.450]  Yeah, I remember what I think it was on this one where we're talking
[02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:25.890]  like in the chat, we were talking WWF and it was like
[02:34:26.730 --> 02:34:30.250]  everyone was throwing out like the mid 80s WWF wrestlers.
[02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:32.370]  So now we're going down a rabbit hole of
[02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:36.730]  everyone's high school mascot.
[02:34:37.530 --> 02:34:38.290]  Mascot.
[02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:42.610]  Was that when you took the picture of what's his name and put it up
[02:34:44.210 --> 02:34:46.570]  because I was wearing that fucking head thing?
[02:34:46.930 --> 02:34:48.770]  Oh, Hulk Hogan.
[02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:50.010]  Hulk Hogan, yes.
[02:34:50.010 --> 02:34:54.330]  Was that was that the episode when the chat was going crazy on the WWF?
[02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:56.290]  It may have been on a couple episodes.
[02:34:56.290 --> 02:34:58.050]  I think we were on that for a while.
[02:34:58.050 --> 02:35:00.050]  I think that didn't get old for a while.
[02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:06.650]  I'm I'm a big fan of like 70s and 80s nostalgia.
[02:35:07.730 --> 02:35:11.290]  Well, I like the one where they were all talking meatballs.
[02:35:11.850 --> 02:35:13.170]  I was getting hungry.
[02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:16.450]  They had all coming up with recipes that was what, two weeks ago or something.
[02:35:18.570 --> 02:35:19.610]  That's made me hungry.
[02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:22.290]  I think about it with this thumbs up.
[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:29.570]  Now, it was always like Hulk Hogan had like no moves.
[02:35:29.570 --> 02:35:32.730]  I think he just had like the kick, like he couldn't lift his legs.
[02:35:32.730 --> 02:35:35.170]  So he just had like the kick to the chest or something.
[02:35:35.170 --> 02:35:35.690]  Yeah, I did.
[02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:39.650]  And then you had like Jimmy Superfly Schnucker who could like jump off
[02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:43.770]  the top ropes and like flip over and like pin someone.
[02:35:44.050 --> 02:35:47.170]  So you had like this like I think Hacksaw Jim Doug.
[02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:48.930]  I mean, he didn't have many moves either.
[02:35:48.930 --> 02:35:51.970]  Like you had some of these guys who are just totally not athletic.
[02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:56.010]  You just hit people with boards.
[02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:57.730]  What about Jake the Snake?
[02:35:57.730 --> 02:35:59.010]  Remember that dude?
[02:35:59.010 --> 02:36:00.050]  I do.
[02:36:00.890 --> 02:36:03.210]  I had all the little action figures when I was a kid, man.
[02:36:03.290 --> 02:36:03.890]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:06.690]  I was born when I got older and I found out that it wasn't real.
[02:36:09.690 --> 02:36:10.690]  I had no idea.
[02:36:10.690 --> 02:36:11.890]  Like Santa Claus.
[02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:12.890]  Yeah.
[02:36:12.890 --> 02:36:13.890]  You know, it's funny.
[02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:17.490]  My son was totally into those little characters too.
[02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:23.890]  Those little like WWF little, you know, like it couldn't be more than three inches
[02:36:23.890 --> 02:36:26.090]  or two inches tall, little action figures.
[02:36:26.090 --> 02:36:27.890]  Is that what you're talking about, Brian?
[02:36:27.890 --> 02:36:28.890]  Yeah.
[02:36:28.890 --> 02:36:30.890]  I would have like the ultimate warrior.
[02:36:30.890 --> 02:36:35.890]  That dude always seemed like he had like the best physique I felt like for when you're
[02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:37.890]  trying to beat up your brother or something.
[02:36:37.890 --> 02:36:38.890]  Yeah.
[02:36:38.890 --> 02:36:41.890]  Let's give everyone.
[02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:42.890]  Yeah.
[02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:47.890]  I'm looking at the visuals of the action figures.
[02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:48.890]  Bill Goldberg.
[02:36:48.890 --> 02:36:50.890]  That dude grew up in Atlanta.
[02:36:50.890 --> 02:36:52.890]  My brother, like we went and got his autograph one day.
[02:36:52.890 --> 02:36:54.890]  But he was more recent.
[02:36:54.890 --> 02:36:56.890]  He was like 90s, right?
[02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:58.890]  Recent if you say like 1990s.
[02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:00.890]  Yeah.
[02:37:00.890 --> 02:37:01.890]  Yeah.
[02:37:01.890 --> 02:37:02.890]  Yeah.
[02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:03.890]  But that dude was jacked too.
[02:37:03.890 --> 02:37:06.890]  I just ruined Santa for someone.
[02:37:06.890 --> 02:37:09.890]  Oh, we told him that wrestling isn't real?
[02:37:09.890 --> 02:37:10.890]  No, no, no.
[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:11.890]  That Santa isn't real.
[02:37:11.890 --> 02:37:12.890]  Oh.
[02:37:12.890 --> 02:37:17.890]  I thought they'd be bummed that wrestling wasn't real.
[02:37:17.890 --> 02:37:18.890]  Fuck.
[02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:19.890]  All right.
[02:37:19.890 --> 02:37:20.890]  Time to eat something.
[02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:21.890]  Yes.
[02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:22.890]  All right.
[02:37:22.890 --> 02:37:23.890]  Let's go.
[02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:28.890]  And don't go hit the McDonald's, but eat some vegetables.
[02:37:28.890 --> 02:37:29.890]  Fruit.
[02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:30.890]  Fruit.
[02:37:30.890 --> 02:37:31.890]  Just start to be conscious.
[02:37:31.890 --> 02:37:34.890]  Even if you do eat crap food, just be conscious of like how your body reacts to that.
[02:37:34.890 --> 02:37:36.890]  And you'll start to be like, oh.
[02:37:36.890 --> 02:37:37.890]  Yeah.
[02:37:37.890 --> 02:37:38.890]  I don't feel so good.
[02:37:38.890 --> 02:37:42.890]  I subconsciously, I guess, just dealt with being sluggish all the damn time.
[02:37:42.890 --> 02:37:45.890]  You're not normally supposed to eat something and then want to take a nap.
[02:37:45.890 --> 02:37:48.890]  You're not supposed to eat something and then want to take a nap.
[02:37:48.890 --> 02:37:51.890]  You're not supposed to eat something and then want to take a nap.
[02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:53.890]  You're not normally supposed to eat something and then want to take a nap.
[02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:56.890]  So if that's what you're doing, some shit ain't right.
[02:37:56.890 --> 02:37:57.890]  There you go.
[02:37:57.890 --> 02:37:58.890]  Good advice.
