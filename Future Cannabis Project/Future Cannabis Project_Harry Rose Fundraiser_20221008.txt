[00:26.200 --> 00:29.660]  Rosette well at rosette wellness on Instagram. I
[00:30.460 --> 00:34.220]  Think that's how it's a yeah, you know rosette wellness
[00:34.880 --> 00:42.400]  Rosotics and rosette lab works and like Harry's been in the background of the medical cannabis
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.560]  movement since the 90s
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.320]  and
[00:46.320 --> 00:48.320]  You know when you meet him when you talk to him
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.440]  He's just like such a real humble dude, and and I had a chance to interview him twice
[00:53.440 --> 01:00.520]  I can't even honestly remember where I met or how I met Harry. I think it was just on alive, but the amount of
[01:01.080 --> 01:05.680]  Kindness and knowledge that that man exudes in the time he takes and you know day in and day out
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.600]  it just it was just like very apparent that I wanted to learn more about this dude and
[01:10.800 --> 01:18.720]  through interviewing him and learning like how interesting a guy he was and you know the fact that you know, he was the
[01:19.440 --> 01:22.880]  Sound engineer for for Steve Jobs when he was doing the
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.720]  when he was doing the tours and like dropping all the new Apple products or he worked on the wall of sound and like with
[01:28.720 --> 01:30.720]  The Grateful Dead and he you know
[01:31.320 --> 01:38.240]  Like had a conversation or two with Jerry like I just like thought it was so interesting and then you know when he really
[01:38.800 --> 01:40.600]  started talking about
[01:40.600 --> 01:47.120]  Getting into cannabis and really how he got in was he was dying like he had this autoimmune disease and he got up to Northern
[01:47.320 --> 01:51.160]  California and really just moved to seclusion to
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.200]  You know see his self out and he happened to move next to Ringo Lawrence
[01:58.200 --> 02:04.360]  who was like the father of modern CBD and like does not get his his flowers that he should
[02:05.200 --> 02:07.000]  and
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.600]  became
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.440]  You know started using the the full-spectrum oils
[02:11.840 --> 02:19.080]  He ended up healing himself through Ringo's genetics and then started working with Ringo to get this medicine out to the people and like
[02:19.280 --> 02:21.280]  You know, the rest is history
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.600]  Rosette was born from there after sort of understanding that he had no other choice, but to create a brand
[02:27.400 --> 02:31.280]  And Harry continues to help the people and you know spend more time
[02:32.040 --> 02:38.080]  helping people than helping himself and so, you know, the point of this is to
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.200]  bring together the community and
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.880]  Support Harry so that he can continue supporting others because that's what he's put on this earth to do
[02:47.600 --> 02:55.080]  And so yeah, I'm super stoked. We've got you know, mission Hill melts Adam for mission Hill melts as well as mace mace is like the
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.400]  Auction guy. He probably could write the college course. He would be the college professor on it and
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.760]  So yeah, man
[03:03.760 --> 03:09.800]  I I just like I'm super grateful that I have enough of a voice that I can pull some people together and guys like may
[03:09.800 --> 03:11.800]  Show up and guys like Adam show up
[03:12.360 --> 03:14.360]  So yeah, we're gonna be pulling up a bunch of people

[33:11.260 --> 33:14.300]  Alright, but this is just for the one. This is just for the one
[33:15.460 --> 33:18.780]  Pack we got 500 bucks how much time we got left maze?

[33:51.880 --> 33:53.880]  There's not too much stuff happening
[33:54.160 --> 33:56.360]  Since this is all for a good cause, you know
[33:56.840 --> 34:02.960]  Cannabis Hill did drop 500 and 350 is not a little bit of money either and just so we're not like
[34:03.680 --> 34:05.680]  Going around the corner too many times
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.640]  I think you know if cannabis Hill wouldn't mind and you know
[34:09.640 --> 34:14.520]  They wouldn't mind maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle and have both of them tap in at 400 and we just knocked that
[34:14.520 --> 34:16.520]  out the park like that
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.320]  Yeah, and it'd be the same thing that way, you know
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.280]  It even out they'd save money and they pay the same shit at the end of the day just so everyone
[34:26.760 --> 34:31.760]  You know just so it's not this we're beating at the same drum again, you know, just just just a little
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.480]  Just thinking about that
[34:34.880 --> 34:37.680]  and and we basically save that time and
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.240]  All that just just a little thought, you know, just a little thought if you guys think that's a good idea
[34:44.280 --> 34:46.280]  It's up to the the people that
[34:47.320 --> 34:50.680]  You know are bidding as well. I think that's fair

[47:53.630 --> 47:56.430]  But let's get a bit of time on the clock.
[47:56.430 --> 47:59.310]  Can I add some pork barrel to that contract?
[47:59.310 --> 48:03.310]  Because I got 10 more minutes and I just want to make sure I end up with something else
[48:03.310 --> 48:04.630]  to bring to the table.
[48:04.630 --> 48:07.950]  I have these Cap Junkie rainbow belts that I made.
[48:07.950 --> 48:09.190]  I never released them.
[48:09.190 --> 48:10.630]  I don't know if I'm releasing them.
[48:10.630 --> 48:12.410]  There's just not enough.
[48:12.410 --> 48:14.110]  And I'll throw those on the chopping block.
[48:14.110 --> 48:16.950]  The Cap Junkie clone cost $1,000.
[48:17.550 --> 48:19.030]  I managed to get one.
[48:19.030 --> 48:22.190]  I grew tons of rainbow belts, found a really nice smell.
[48:22.190 --> 48:23.470]  And that's what that is right there.
[48:23.470 --> 48:26.190]  So I'll throw in the Cap Junkie rainbow belts.
[48:26.190 --> 48:29.070]  I'll throw in a dealer's choice pack of Thug Pug.
[48:29.070 --> 48:30.830]  I got a bunch of Thug Pug stuff.
[48:30.830 --> 48:31.830]  I'll throw in one of those.
[48:31.830 --> 48:37.510]  I'll throw in a dealer's choice pack of some Bodhi and one other name brand reader and
[48:37.510 --> 48:40.430]  five packs of Masonic gear on top of that.
[48:40.430 --> 48:42.710]  We'll pull Kaya's stuff out.
[48:42.710 --> 48:43.710]  We'll just do that.
[48:43.710 --> 48:44.710]  We're just doing that.
[48:44.710 --> 48:46.470]  Bro, well, let's do that.
[48:46.510 --> 48:50.270]  I just want to make sure I get something else to bring to the table before I head out of
[48:50.270 --> 48:51.270]  here.
[48:51.270 --> 48:52.270]  I know.
[48:52.270 --> 48:53.270]  I appreciate you.
[48:53.270 --> 48:58.630]  So Mace is throwing down huge, another huge, huge, huge.
[48:58.630 --> 49:00.950]  I have to write that down or else I'll forget.
[49:00.950 --> 49:01.950]  Let me see.
[49:01.950 --> 49:05.150]  Cap Junkie, I won't.
[49:05.150 --> 49:21.740]  Cap Junkie, Bodhi, name brand pack and five Masonic packs.
[49:21.740 --> 49:22.740]  Dealer's choice.
[49:22.740 --> 49:27.340]  So you're getting Cap Junkie rainbow belts, one Thug Pug, dealer's choice variety, one
[49:27.340 --> 49:30.540]  Bodhi dealer's choice variety, one other name brand pack.
[49:30.540 --> 49:33.980]  So that could be like archive exotic.
[49:33.980 --> 49:37.740]  Who knows, you know, and then five other, you know, dealer's choice varieties on top
[49:37.740 --> 49:38.740]  of that.
[49:38.740 --> 49:39.740]  Let's get it going.
[49:39.740 --> 49:43.060]  We got Danimal at 300 coming in swinging.
[49:43.060 --> 49:45.260]  Big Ops Danimal.
[49:45.260 --> 49:47.260]  That's the homie.
[49:47.260 --> 49:48.500]  Nope.
[49:48.500 --> 49:50.100]  This is not for the PNW.
[49:50.100 --> 49:54.060]  We've excluded that just because I only have 10 more minutes before I got to lock up my
[49:54.060 --> 49:55.180]  shop.
[49:55.180 --> 49:56.860]  So appreciate you guys.
[49:57.380 --> 49:58.380]  I'm here.
[49:58.380 --> 49:59.380]  I made it.
[49:59.380 --> 50:01.100]  You know, shout out Big Harry, man.
[50:01.100 --> 50:05.300]  Freaking appreciate all the love and support you guys are bringing for the homies.
[50:05.300 --> 50:06.980]  This is how community works, homie.
[50:06.980 --> 50:07.980]  Just like this.
[50:07.980 --> 50:10.380]  We all come together and help motherfuckers when they need that help and shit.
[50:10.380 --> 50:13.220]  And we keep showing everyone that we're better than they think we are.
[50:13.220 --> 50:14.220]  No doubt, man.
[50:14.220 --> 50:15.220]  No doubt.
[50:15.220 --> 50:18.100]  This is for just the Masonic stuff, Dave.
[50:18.100 --> 50:20.060]  This isn't for the Pacific Northwest roots.
[50:20.060 --> 50:24.980]  So this is a big pack of, it's not just Masonic gear.
[50:24.980 --> 50:26.260]  It's a ton of gear.
[50:26.660 --> 50:33.340]  It's Thug Pug, it's Dealer's Choice, which is, you know, in Mace's Vault.
[50:33.340 --> 50:36.660]  And then you've got five packs of Masonic.
[50:36.660 --> 50:40.740]  And what was the rainbow?

[50:54.380 --> 50:58.380]  And you're getting five, six, seven, eight, nine packs.
[50:58.380 --> 51:00.220]  We launched Cap Junkie recently.
[51:00.220 --> 51:02.700]  It did big numbers in Waterhash.
[51:02.700 --> 51:09.340]  The Cap Junkie costed $1,000, you know, like ridiculous prices.
[51:09.340 --> 51:13.180]  You guys go rob it and save some money.

[57:44.100 --> 57:49.140]  So I put a bunch of those up and people wanted to just deposit 50 directly to Harry without
[57:49.140 --> 57:50.140]  having to bid.
[57:50.140 --> 57:53.860]  Once I get the screenshots, I'll get seeds out to you.
[57:53.860 --> 57:58.020]  Thank you so much, Mr. Toad.
[57:58.020 --> 57:59.020]  Really appreciate you, man.
[57:59.020 --> 58:05.380]  And that, you know, we're going to have some lower level options as well.
[58:05.380 --> 58:08.580]  Not level lower, like lower price range.
[58:08.580 --> 58:13.460]  Yeah, we're going to let we're going to let Mission Hill kick it off, though.
[58:14.420 --> 58:15.420]  Oh, you're muted, brother.
[58:16.340 --> 58:17.340]  Hello there.
[58:17.340 --> 58:18.340]  How are we doing?
[58:18.340 --> 58:19.340]  All right.
[58:19.340 --> 58:20.340]  Let's try that again.
[58:20.340 --> 58:25.260]  I'm calling this the Mission Hill Head Stash because these are three really fire packs
[58:25.260 --> 58:27.860]  out of my personal collection.
[58:27.860 --> 58:31.220]  So all you're bidding on all three of these.
[58:31.220 --> 58:33.660]  The first one is Malbu Marcia Wilson.
[58:33.660 --> 58:40.460]  So that's Trap Cookies, Cookies and Cream Wilson, Orange Terps, Tropical Fruit Terps,
[58:40.460 --> 58:42.020]  Big Hash Yield.
[58:42.020 --> 58:44.300]  That's the first pack.
[58:44.300 --> 58:50.280]  Second pack, Archive Lemon Heads.
[58:50.280 --> 58:55.860]  This is a fire straight lemon cleaner terp.
[58:55.860 --> 58:58.500]  It does good hash numbers.
[58:58.500 --> 59:04.260]  When I first started smoking good melt, 710 Labs was running this and they killed it.
[59:04.260 --> 59:06.660]  So this is a tried and true hash.
[59:06.660 --> 59:14.420]  And then last but not least, fucking very much dead stock from Farmhouse Studio Genetics,
[59:14.420 --> 59:17.140]  aka our man Shwale.
[59:17.140 --> 59:19.420]  This is the Glazed Donuts.
[59:19.420 --> 59:28.100]  So Purple Punch, Crusty Grape, Cake Fuel, Jelly Donut Terps, pretty standard harvest
[59:28.100 --> 59:33.660]  time, good for indoor growing, lots of big heads.
[59:33.660 --> 59:41.200]  So these are three things that your boy would love to be smoking on any day of the week.
[59:41.200 --> 59:46.420]  You're guaranteed to find hash keepers in all of these packs.
[59:46.420 --> 59:49.580]  And we're going to throw this up for Harry.
[59:49.580 --> 59:52.380]  So I think we'll start this off.
[59:52.380 --> 59:54.580]  Wow, Luke Hayward already.
[59:54.580 --> 59:56.060]  All right, there we go.
[59:56.060 --> 59:57.700]  So we're starting at 250.
[59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.420]  So these are absolute hitters.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.060]  Yo appreciate you mission.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.220]  Appreciate you Adam and Hanna.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.220]  Appreciate you Luke.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.220]  Shout out.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220]  Yo, this is fire.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.380]  This is a fire combo here.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.580]  Yeah, there's lots of good stuff too.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.780]  That's Shwale Pack.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.780]  The Shwale Pack.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.900]  Big gas.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.900]  Very limited.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:21.420]  Very, very much made for hashing.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.780]  It's got a fantastic name.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.540]  A little bit more unique genetics than what people are seeing on the market these days.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:36.510]  So something cool for people to work on.
[01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.590]  Malibu Marsha Wilson, dude.
[01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:39.750]  Can't say enough good things.
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:43.470]  The Malibu Marsha on its own is fantastic.
[01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.470]  Great orange chirps.
[01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:48.590]  You get a little bit of like cream from the cooking cream.
[01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.430]  And then you cross that to Macy's Tried and True Wilson.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.430]  It's hard to beat.
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:58.190]  You're looking for the tropical fruit and the orange chirps.
[01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:59.190]  This is a...
[01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:04.150]  I'm going to start the timer for two minutes.
[01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:05.310]  Two minutes.
[01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:07.110]  And then archive baby lemon heads.
[01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.110]  Dude, this is a classic.
[01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:09.110]  You can't beat this the other way either.
[01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.110]  275.
[01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.110]  275.
[01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:12.110]  My man.
[01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:13.110]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:25.950]  PayPal is going to be posted immediately in the chat by my man, Caribbean Tasting Team.
[01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.590]  All three of these.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:31.630]  You're getting haters.
[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:37.750]  You're finding a new line of hash keepers out of these three.
[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.270]  Payment links are all going to be posted in the chat.
[01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:48.430]  And if you were to put all those into a cart in a seed bank and check out, you'd be talking
[01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.950]  about $750 plus shipping, depending on where you were.
[01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:56.230]  If you can find it, which you can.
[01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:57.230]  Good luck.
[01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.870]  Good luck finding those.
[01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:02.030]  We got one minute left.
[01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.030]  We're here to support.
[01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:05.110]  This is definitely a dank package.
[01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:06.110]  There we go.
[01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:17.180]  Adam posting up the PayPal as well as the...
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.180]  There's a PayPal.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.940]  There's also, I think a Venmo and a Cash App in there.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.940]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.340]  And we got the lemon heads.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.340]  280.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.340]  280.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.340]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:34.340]  You want to maybe fix that, Adam?
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:48.260]  I don't know if that's 100% right or put the bases in.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.820]  We got 14 seconds left.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.420]  We're at 280.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.540]  And if anyone refreshes the YouTube page, all the payment methods are in the description
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.620]  of the YouTube channel.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:04.980]  It has all the Venmo, the PayPal, and the Cash App right in the description.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.980]  That's it.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.060]  We're calling time unless there's any snipes.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.020]  300 at the fucking buzzer.
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.020]  There we go.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.020]  Tricomb Shatterworks.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.420]  My man, bro.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.420]  That's a good snag.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.420]  That's a steal.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.420]  Dude, excellent steal.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:25.180]  These are going to do you some good.
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.180]  Tricomb Shatterworks.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.100]  And more importantly, they're going to throw me and Harry some good, so we're hyped on
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.100]  that.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.100]  Appreciate you.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.100]  All right.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:42.100]  And like Peter said, take a screenshot for payment info.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.700]  We're going to keep reposting the payment info in the chat.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.500]  Corey, how are you doing, brother?
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500]  Good.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  Good to see you.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.580]  I wanted to jump on, say hello.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.580]  It's been a while.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.780]  Bro, it's so good to see you.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780]  Glad to see you.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780]  Adam, what's up, brother?
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780]  How are you doing, man?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]  How are you doing, brother?
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780]  Doing good.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.780]  Doing good.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780]  Really enjoying that Big Hit Rosin, man.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.780]  Everywhere I go, it's the big hit.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.780]  So I love it.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.780]  I love it.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:05.780]  We were sure blessed to spin that, dude.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.780]  100%.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780]  Love it.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780]  Yeah, I got a couple of things.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780]  I just wanted to show some support for Harry.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780]  Throw a couple of things up.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780]  Rotten gave me the link, so I wanted to jump on.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780]  I haven't got any cool shit like that.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.780]  I'm not going to lie.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.700]  a couple of things.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.700]  Rotten gave me the link.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.140]  So I wanted to jump on.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.860]  I haven't got any cool shit like you guys have.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.860]  No.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:33.920]  But I wanted to put up a couple of things that I have because I got to do Mr. Trees
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.720]  here later, and I wanted to come on and show some support.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.780]  Do you want me to jump on and do this now?
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.780]  How do you want to do it?
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.780]  Yeah, let's go.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.780]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.040]  So I'll flip my camera around here, if I can.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]  Let's see.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.340]  All right, did we lose him?
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.940]  Nope, I'm still here.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.940]  I'm trying to...
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.900]  You got to hit more on settings.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900]  It should be under there.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]  It's not under the camera.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:10.800]  All right.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]  Here we go.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]  Here we go.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.720]  All right, so I've got some Dutch blooms.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.800]  I got the gold mugger.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800]  Awesome.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.720]  Here we go.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.200]  We got more Dutch blooms.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.320]  This is the ice cream cake by Black Wap Gold.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.400]  Nice.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.680]  And I got some skunk house genetics.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680]  I got...
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680]  Ooh.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]  Paris Mare.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680]  All right.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.680]  All right.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.720]  And you say you have no cool seeds.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  Yeah, come on.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.960]  Well, I mean, not cool like stuff you guys have, but it's cool for me.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.360]  Bro, this is great.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.360]  All right, where do you want to start this out, Corey?
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.640]  Wherever you feel comfortable.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]  Let it rip.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.640]  Whatever's clever.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640]  I'm all...
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.840]  Whatever you think is good.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840]  No insults here.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]  We're going to open up the bidding.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:04.080]  I'm going to put two minutes on the clock.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.680]  Mo Grart, $200.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680]  There we go.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680]  Kicking it off.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680]  Appreciate you, Mo Grart.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:15.160]  That's three packs, two Dutch blooms packs, and a skunk house.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.640]  Paris Larry F2.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:23.200]  Paris Larry was clearly desirable enough that the skunk house wanted to work it into it
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.560]  in a specific direction.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.640]  I actually don't know much about the Paris Larry.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.720]  I don't either.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720]  I don't either.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.480]  It was interesting enough where I bought it and I wanted to dig into it, but never got
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480]  to it.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.580]  If I was a betting man, I would say that's Paris OG, Larry OG.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.000]  So that sounds like OG on OG, which is-
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Probably gassy.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.720]  Yeah, that Paris OG was big, I feel like around 2015, 2014.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.200]  Big BHO strain.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.120]  It was super tasty.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:58.760]  I remember I think it was West Coast Cure was running it a bunch.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.760]  Super nice OG derps.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]  Nice.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.020]  All right.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.520]  So Tricomb Shatterworks, as always, being super helpful.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.440]  The gold mugger is ICC by Blackwap Gold.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.360]  The Paris Larry and then the Paris Larry F2.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.160]  The gold mugger, the ICC Blackwap Gold and the Paris Larry up on deck.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.160]  There's the three strains.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.480]  We got 42 seconds left.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:31.040]  The current bid is 280, I believe.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.440]  And there's the PayPal, the Venmo 280.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:42.440]  So if you want the beans shipped out tomorrow or the day after, then just go ask your payment
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.840]  info and we'll get those shipped out right away.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.920]  We got 18 seconds on the clock.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:56.030]  We got 280 for those three packs.
[01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.030]  Big terps.
[01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:58.030]  Big terps.
[01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.030]  Oh, man.
[01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.030]  Woo!
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.030]  That's a knee slap.
[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:06.630]  All right, that's it.
[01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:07.870]  We're going to call that.
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.310]  That's awesome.
[01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:16.270]  So I don't know a ton about this, but I'll trust Rotten if he tells me everything's
[01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.270]  cocoa on the payment.
[01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.030]  I'll get the information.
[01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:20.550]  I'll send everything out on Monday.
[01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.630]  Yeah, shout out to Adam.
[01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:23.630]  Oh, Tuesday.
[01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:24.630]  We get a holiday Monday.
[01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:25.630]  Monday's a holiday.
[01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:26.630]  No worries.
[01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:28.750]  Well, Monday is a holiday.
[01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:33.870]  So yeah, earliest shipping will be Tuesday for us American cats.
[01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:44.750]  Shout out to both Lobster Fam Farms as well as Adam in the chat at Terpene Tasting Team
[01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:47.550]  who's doing all the organization on the back end.
[01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:48.710]  He's just as important.
[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:52.350]  Both those guys are just as important as the guys up here.
[01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:57.110]  There'd be no way we could keep it all organized without those back end guys.
[01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:59.430]  So huge shout out to those guys.
[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.350]  Make sure you're giving them a follow, man.
[01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:04.670]  They're just as much and just as important members of the community.
[01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.590]  So huge shout out to them.
[01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:08.590]  Let's keep it rolling.
[01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:11.950]  Speaking of those guys, let's give away some more free shit.
[01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:12.950]  Woo!
[01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:13.950]  We got a 15.
[01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:16.350]  Oh, man, that shit is fire right there.
[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.350]  That shit puts me out.
[01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.350]  That's the one hitter quitter named after my pinball.
[01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.350]  Tell him about it.
[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:25.390]  That's the Cory Stardog cut from JJ across to my space chief.
[01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.670]  That shit's nothing but gas, plastic, kerosene, propane.
[01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.950]  That shit will kick in your ass.
[01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:32.350]  It drops me, man.
[01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:35.310]  When I'm doing live feed, one joint of that lasts me about nine hours, man.
[01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:36.310]  I'm serious.
[01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:37.310]  Fuck me up.
[01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:41.270]  I did a write up on it on the Skunk Magazine website.
[01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:43.030]  Julie published it up there.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:49.430]  If anyone wants to go check it out, that one hitter quitter is fucking fire, man.
[01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.790]  What was the pup's nickname?
[01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.390]  Yanni boy?
[01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:53.390]  We called him Yandi.
[01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:56.310]  We called him fucking Cleveland one hitter quitter.
[01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:58.030]  That dude had more nicknames than a motherfucker.
[01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.430]  He was 14 and a half when he passed.
[01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.270]  He was my mom's best friend and myself.
[01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:05.030]  That dude protected my family forever.
[01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:06.950]  The best dog I ever knew.
[01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:08.310]  Tell the chat how to spell it.
[01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:11.110]  Whoever spells it first gets it.
[01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:12.110]  Yandi.
[01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:13.190]  Y-O-N-D-I.
[01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:15.310]  Put that out there.
[01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.270]  We'll give you a free pack of one hitter quitter.
[01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.870]  That shit is my favorite weed right now.
[01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:20.870]  Locked in.
[01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:21.870]  Boom.
[01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:22.870]  All right.
[01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:23.870]  That's it.
[01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:24.870]  Short and sweet.
[01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:25.870]  More free shit coming soon.
[01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.870]  Hey, fellas.
[01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:27.870]  I'm going to jump out.
[01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.110]  I really appreciate you.
[01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.110]  It was awesome.
[01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:33.110]  Good to see you, brother.
[01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:34.390]  Excellent seeing you.
[01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:35.390]  Great talking to you, Adam.
[01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:36.390]  We'll see you soon.
[01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:37.390]  Boom.
[01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:38.390]  As usual.
[01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:39.390]  Thanks, everybody.
[01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:40.390]  Appreciate you, brother.
[01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:41.390]  All right.
[01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:45.270]  Man, I'm stoked to see so many people coming in and helping.
[01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.270]  Yeah, man.
[01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:47.270]  That's what it's about.
[01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:48.270]  Yo.
[01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:49.270]  What up, guys?
[01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:50.270]  What's up, man?
[01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:51.270]  How you doing, Toad?
[01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.270]  How you doing, Adam?
[01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:53.270]  Nice to see you, Jamison.
[01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:54.270]  What up, man?
[01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.270]  Thanks for the invite.
[01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:56.270]  Anytime, bro.
[01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:57.270]  I just want to give a big shout out to Harry.
[01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.270]  As someone who I really believe cannabis saved my life.
[01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:59.270]  If it wasn't for people like Harry, you know, I would not be here.
[01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:01.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:02.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:04.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:05.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:07.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:08.270]  I would not be here.
[01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.530]  There would be a lot of people like myself that are really struggling.
[01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:15.510]  So Harry's changing lives every day.
[01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:18.810]  So make sure you guys show some support.
[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:19.810]  Make sure you're following him.
[01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:21.150]  Show him some love.
[01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:23.490]  He really could use this support right now.
[01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.490]  And yeah, so I want to throw some gear up.
[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:33.910]  I—me and Melting Pots just did a big pollination with this root beer backcross that I'm working
[01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.430]  with from Mean Gene.
[01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:37.490]  It's the Root Beer Backcross II.
[01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.550]  And I popped him during about 2020.
[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:45.250]  2020 and I've been you know testing this male crossing into a bunch of stuff and so just recently we
[01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.050]  Redid a pollination that I had done about a year ago
[01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:55.790]  and it's a Donnie burger times root beer back cross to and this is my burgers and beer and
[01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:58.530]  I actually have
[01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:03.510]  there's a couple people growing it right now, but there's a guy named Marcus a Rulius on IG and
[01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:07.930]  Let me adjust the lighting. He's been growing it out and
[01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:12.330]  Oh, sorry, I jacked it up. You've been growing her out and he is
[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:15.870]  absolutely crushing it with the
[01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:21.790]  If he knows he's found a buddy locally shared some with me and they were
[01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:26.650]  He had like four different selections. They range from like sharpie to
[01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:29.770]  Fresh spray paint
[01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:31.370]  There's a lot of unique turps in there
[01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:35.910]  The Donnie burger is like really offensive on its own, but this cross produces some really cool stuff
[01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.150]  So we're gonna do for this one. We're gonna
[01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:42.070]  This auction we're gonna do a pack of the burgers and beer
[01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:50.430]  We're gonna do a 30 pack 30 seeds and this is the Mac one root beer back cross to and these are gonna be unreleased
[01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:53.690]  So this is the only chance anyone will ever get to get these ones
[01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:56.710]  The burgers and beer is out and I'm making more of them
[01:12:57.230 --> 01:13:00.130]  And then as well if you follow me and Jean closely
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:05.110]  He just did his root beer freeze and the root beer freeze is root beer back cross to
[01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:13.190]  F2 and so I actually made some f2s myself using my selection from the same line. So this is an unreleased
[01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:20.730]  Seed stock as well. These aren't going out to anyone but you guys on the auction. So this is a triple pack burgers and beer
[01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.730]  pure root beer f2
[01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.370]  My version of jeans root beer freeze on the Mac one
[01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:29.890]  So is that
[01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:38.050]  To 10 packs. Yeah, yeah to 15 and a 30 to 15s and a 30. Yeah one double pack for the Mac one
[01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:40.770]  hippie spinach
[01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:45.930]  Chubby monkey 200 hippie. Thank you for starting it off brother. I always appreciate you guys
[01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:51.970]  I'm pretty sure didn't that ginger large just drop burgers and beer live rousing. I think I saw
[01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:55.510]  300 oh, yeah, if you did then I missed it man
[01:13:56.030 --> 01:14:01.070]  I think it might have I I would yeah, I would take a look. I think he just watched. Thank you
[01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:04.630]  300 bucks Luke Luke Hayward
[01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:10.870]  Shout out Luke chubby monkey 325. Let's go guys. It's for a good cause these seeds will never be seen
[01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:17.390]  So if you want to start me or you want to start working your own thing or establishing yourself in the space
[01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:23.710]  You know, this is this is a real opportunity to do so ranch is putting in the real work
[01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.990]  You know, he's really doing the legwork
[01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:29.350]  Making the selections. You've got the same
[01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:34.590]  Backcross that gene just did but done by a different individual
[01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.990]  Yeah, and if you were able to grab those root beer freezes
[01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:43.390]  This would be something really cool to run side by side and maybe even take in two different directions if you're a breeder yourself
[01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:46.830]  So you could have a lot of fun exploring, you know different variations in the root beer
[01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:48.790]  and
[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:51.630]  Josh Colbert just asked what the taste was like
[01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:57.390]  So do you want to talk a little bit about the taste ranch on the on that root beer back cross on the roof on?
[01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:03.790]  The root beer back cross. Yeah, so the one that I found I was getting a lot of like it wasn't straight root beer
[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:07.350]  but it was it was definite root beer and some black licorice and
[01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:09.910]  og and to me it's like a
[01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:16.470]  it's like a really unique variant of an og in my mind from the stuff that I've tried and
[01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:23.150]  The selection that I made I'm really curious to try gene selection and some of these you know
[01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:25.510]  F2 selections that people are making in the freeze
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:31.110]  But I think you'll find some varying stuff in the in the F2s
[01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:36.070]  I'm not really great at describing the turps and it's not my favorite
[01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:42.030]  Thing to do but I know some people are really really descriptive. So sorry that I'm not
[01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:48.950]  No, that's okay we appreciate you coming on we appreciate you putting up packs and supporting a that's what it's about. Yeah, and
[01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.550]  So right now I think we got Luke
[01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:56.510]  I believe is in the lead with 300 and
[01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:02.150]  I haven't put any time on the clock. So I'm gonna put a minute on the clock
[01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:07.710]  Perfect, yeah, thank you, you know try and pull up some more photos of this
[01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.710]  The burgers and beer is tested
[01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:15.670]  These F2s I have not popped in the Mac one. I have not popped these are fresh crosses
[01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.110]  They will be will be unreleased
[01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:23.390]  So you'll be the only one to get to run them but burgers and beer has been proven to really crush outside
[01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:27.390]  All of the root beer crosses really crush outside
[01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:32.270]  I did some other ones with this same male last season. And so this male really is
[01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:35.870]  Really nice
[01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:38.310]  Really nice
[01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.310]  So, okay
[01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:45.590]  In the lead with $400 Luke is a great individual. He's a good friend of mine
[01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:49.990]  Had the pleasure of hanging out with him more than a couple times
[01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:52.870]  and
[01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:55.750]  This is we got 15 seconds left
[01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:58.590]  three packs
[01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:00.270]  30
[01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:02.670]  15 15 to unreleased
[01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:07.310]  One released and well known to be a washer and with reports back
[01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:12.270]  And that's it we're gonna call it also Luke
[01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:16.190]  Luke you get that you run that bro. I
[01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.910]  Hate you supporting the community see if you Luke
[01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:28.670]  Hey word, thank you. No worries, brother
[01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.230]  And then I do have
[01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:33.870]  We're gonna do another one
[01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:39.550]  Yeah, let's do another one. And this one is gonna be the same with the burgers and beer in the root beer
[01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:41.550]  We're doing another one of these
[01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:44.910]  Okay, so the root beer there will be two of you guys with it
[01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:49.390]  But then the other pack is gonna be biscotti. And so this is biscotti root beer
[01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:52.190]  This is the biscotti clone. I got from Masonic and
[01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.830]  It's really nice
[01:17:54.830 --> 01:18:01.070]  I don't want to describe the terms on it, but it was one that I really liked and this is one that I'm gonna be going
[01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.070]  Through myself in the future. So
[01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.510]  Yeah biscotti and we're gonna do another 30 pack. So a double
[01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:14.590]  30 packet of biscotti root beer back to the root beer back crust to add to and the burgers and beer
[01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.630]  All right, who's starting this off? I?
[01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:20.430]  Think somebody's gonna start
[01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:23.390]  Alright who's starting this off I
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.670]  Think somebody just missed out on the last one. This is pretty much the same as the one before so
[01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:32.390]  Let's see it guys before but instead of Mac. We're doing biscotti
[01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:38.470]  250 to Roy Duggan Roy you're a wise man. You're wise man
[01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:45.470]  You have my respect if you don't know you're gonna learn soon. All right, I'm gonna put two minutes on the clock
[01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.470]  Two minutes we got lots of seeds

[01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:13.350]  Seed lines on this is stuff that not everybody has and very few people are gonna look at and work. So
[01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.590]  Very cool Dustin at 350
[01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:20.590]  That's the

[01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:38.570]  Mutant genetics. They don't really look like weed
[01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:43.570]  And they start flowering. They're pretty crazy pretty fun to grow
[01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:51.370]  Homie was crossing them with some modern genetics so you can find something in between the lineages

[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.940]  It's beautiful

[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.300]  think it's a kind of a bummer that with weed being legal the
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:07.260]  Beautiful medical products are sort of falling by the wayside and Harry's really
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.220]  Trying to keep those going so we got to keep Harry going as much as we can

[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.460]  hopping on his lives and hearing him talk about what he's working with but
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.420]  Once again, we got three

[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.940]  Yeah, these are they're crazy beautiful to grow. They are
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.900]  absolutely wild so

[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.140]  Let's deal a steel Thai guy
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.380]  Yo six star seeds appreciate you dropping by bro

[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:15.820]  Awesome. All right. Well, yeah, we're not going anywhere. So yeah, why don't we why don't we I'd love I'd love to hear about your
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.140]  Seeds man. Let's let's hear what you got to put up. Oh
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.760]  Did it glitch
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.240]  Might have lagged just a touch
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.880]  the bag
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.640]  Sorry, but love no, I'll get right over you good stuff. Yeah
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.840]  So, yeah, I reversed a straw guava and hit it to some stuff was trying to make a
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:53.440]  Washer that had CBD in the bags other than you know, really small
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.680]  25 micron stuff so finally was able to capture a one-to-one
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.440]  THC to CBD and the majority of you know, the 90 to 160 bags that everyone runs and
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040]  the dominant terpene
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.800]  myrcene
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.440]  So it's a it's a recreational CBD hash rosin that I'm making with it, but
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.080]  yeah, I'd love to get that out there to anyone that has interest in CBD and
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.240]  doesn't do huge numbers on the wash, but
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.640]  It does wash
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.640]  So I've got that to
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.000]  Does the rosin have a high CBD content like have you gotten the actual rosin tested
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:43.880]  Yeah, I did actually you can see that on my Instagram model results through SC labs as I remember
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.320]  I think it was around like 45 to 40 percent CBD and 40 percent THC
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.480]  Damn, that's fucking awesome. Nice work. Yeah, really awesome work. You're doing six star. I'm really curious
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.980]  How did the texture come out with all that CBD?
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:06.120]  It's really oily it's hard to get it to crash or nucleate even with heat and time
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.940]  Yeah CBD this time it would probably great for car that oily like that
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.500]  Definitely some incredible work. Yeah, I haven't had a
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.220]  Right
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.420]  On appreciate that
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.620]  So, yeah, I'd like to
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:37.500]  offer up six packs I have bred by me as well as a couple other packs from other breeders just have laying around the
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:42.240]  Put so it's one pack of the Guava Nana CBD
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:49.820]  And then a pack of the Guava Nana a
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  Pack of greasy fruits
[01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:05.050]  And a pack of sweet tail and what did what's the sweet tail and then also
[01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:13.930]  That's strong Nana across the skunk and then across to a straw guava
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:19.930]  And so all of these pretty much wash for me except for the greasy fruits
[01:29:19.930 --> 01:29:24.770]  I hadn't tried washing that just because the turf rub on it was pretty greasy as opposed to sandy
[01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:27.010]  but
[01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:32.490]  Then in addition to those if you're in a CBD, I've got some equilibrium genetics high tide CBD
[01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:39.930]  That's an unopened pack and then I've got a half pack of each Bodhi seeds
[01:29:42.490 --> 01:29:45.250]  The master hash plant and the mango hash plant
[01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:48.170]  so
[01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:50.170]  approximately nine packs
[01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:54.090]  Again no
[01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:56.730]  Yeah started anywhere
[01:29:57.010 --> 01:30:01.170]  That's fucking awesome. We got nine packs. We got one two ones in there
[01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:08.170]  We got I think is it a THC or CBD Dom as well from that from the CBD breeder?
[01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:15.170]  You know, I haven't run that equilibrium genetics high tide CBD it's
[01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:18.370]  Probably a one-to-one. I'm guessing
[01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:25.450]  That's awesome, all right. Well, we got one two ones and high THC's all mixed up I
[01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:28.610]  Noticed a bunch of them were friends are they all them
[01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:33.450]  So they're all fans except for
[01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.410]  My stuff's all times except for the
[01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:42.210]  Straw man across the skunk. Those are regulars
[01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:52.170]  And I also have some skunk up Jews at the back cross those are regulars as well awesome
[01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:58.330]  I'm gonna start the the timer for two minutes
[01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:01.930]  Let's start the bidding at $50
[01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:10.890]  Let's go Nana I
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.380]  Know it looks like a lot of hashers out there
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:20.980]  So I'd mentioned also on the Guava Nana that hit super good numbers for Matt Shaka over at Shaka solvent lists
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.540]  He ran a whole bed of that in the outdoor
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.820]  greenhouse and
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:30.980]  Remember correctly. It was like somewhere in the three percent to hash. Oh
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.580]  Shout out DBS, what up?
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.300]  Shout out Scott appreciate you dog
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:46.180]  80 80 for Scott and you know, these are these are washers straw guava is still so hot and Cali like
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.460]  every single hash maker
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:53.620]  needs a straw guava or some type of strawberry and so to be able to
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.060]  Have this as well as you know
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:02.940]  The the one-to-ones that wash are so rare that there's only a few guys even looking
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.780]  For that kind of stuff and you know that resin is so hard to deal with
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:13.220]  So, you know if you're maybe trying to get into the hash community and you want to carve out yourself a niche, you know
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:19.320]  Selecting and and working with one-to-ones and high type three varietals that are high CBD
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.480]  You know that that is that is
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:28.960]  Space where there's a lot of headroom to breathe in as far as not a lot of people. They're working with it. No
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.720]  not out to
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.220]  Shout out to six star shout out to anybody
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:39.240]  I know the guy named Foxtrot is doing some work with with CBD hunters
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.360]  Very few people we got Scott at 120 Scott wants these things
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.960]  Shout out to first name last name and great name and
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.080]  Brendan's but Scott's still on it Brendan's Brendan came back at 130

[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:10.480]  Yeah, you're guaranteed pretty much to get a good washer a good Fino from any of these packs
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.480]  I've
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:16.800]  Test popped and had lots of other people around me grow them in many different environments
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.680]  hydro outdoor and
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.640]  Everybody had great success and hit
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200]  Pretty decent numbers on the hash
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:32.880]  Yeah, everything's super turpy like really like you said dominant with the strawberries and funk fuel from the strawglova
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.680]  150 chef Reese that's what's up. Shout out chef Reese
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.960]  Rock with me from the hash maker hangouts. I respect that
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.960]  But yeah, I really appreciate you guys putting this on for Harry
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.480]  the Rose Rosette wellness tinctures has done
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.800]  so much for me, I mean, I don't want to say it like saved my life, but
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.640]  that along with a few things pretty much did and

[01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:24.050]  If you don't know much about Harry and what he does you really got to look into the tinctures he makes because he's pretty much
[01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:26.930]  The only one out there making an acidic form
[01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:31.730]  CBD a and THC a and the fullest spectrum and most applicable
[01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:34.330]  Alcohol-free

[01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:40.770]  It's unbelievable really until you try it and you'll appreciate it
[01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:48.190]  All right, Brendan looking like he's gonna snag these packs. Not is it a pack seven packs?
[01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:57.130]  Nine, I think so. It's six packs for me one pack from equilibrium and two half packs from Bodie
[01:34:57.130 --> 01:34:59.130]  Damn
[01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:04.290]  Box to Brendan you fucking smart man 200 Jeff Reese with this night

[01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:58.290]  100 bucks a pack. This is a this is $900
[01:35:58.290 --> 01:36:03.530]  We've got a lot of room to go guys like just because I start doesn't mean we need to finish there
[01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:06.490]  so six are with the
[01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:07.450]  the
[01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:10.370]  Guava, Nana CBD the female you selected
[01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:15.730]  The CBD plant was that the one you reversed or was it this the block straw guava you reversed?
[01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:19.450]  The mother was straw guava, that's the plant I reversed
[01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:26.210]  It was
[01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:30.730]  CBD glu tied across the banana and G that I did previously and
[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:34.810]  Then I hit that to straw guava and that's what made the the wash to 80
[01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:36.810]  It's really cool stuff you're doing there six time
[01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:39.610]  My own thanks appreciate that
[01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:41.610]  We got 38 seconds left on the clock
[01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:46.050]  Let's go everyone. If you want it speak up or forever hold your peace
[01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:48.770]  We got lots and lots of gear to run through
[01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:56.490]  Marjolaine
[01:36:58.490 --> 01:37:00.490]  I
[01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:02.490]  See
[01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:07.170]  CBD was super
[01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:10.130]  Beneficial to me with regarding my health and getting back on track
[01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:16.130]  so I had to focus on it in terms of growing and breeding and just super lucky that I was able to
[01:37:16.650 --> 01:37:19.450]  Find something that appears in the hash bags
[01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:24.410]  Yeah, it's amazing to one
[01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:32.490]  Congratulations to Wayne Mustafa send that money send that confirmation and we'll get you those beans man. We appreciate you
[01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:37.210]  Q we haven't had a chance to say what's up, man. How you been? Yeah
[01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:40.650]  Appreciate it. You are right now
[01:37:41.290 --> 01:37:47.010]  Yeah, yeah, we're pressing all day a little beat. But um, yeah, we just ate and I ate half my dinner
[01:37:47.010 --> 01:37:50.010]  I'm gonna go get some more beans. I'm gonna go get some more beans
[01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:54.530]  Little beat but um, yeah, we just ate and I ate half my dinner and
[01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:59.810]  Yeah jumped in here to help help Harry the fucking pioneer of all pioneers. So
[01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:04.250]  I appreciate you showing up. What what are you doing up today?
[01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:11.650]  So I've got a pretty big lot. I was thinking about splitting into two lots. Yeah
[01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:14.410]  But I'm not really
[01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:20.210]  It basically it could be a good a good three small lots or it's better as one big lot
[01:38:20.210 --> 01:38:27.730]  It doesn't really split down the middle is two, but it's six packs of seeds in total so we can let's do three small lots
[01:38:27.730 --> 01:38:29.810]  There's been a lot of big lots. So
[01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:33.010]  Some time with it. Yeah
[01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:37.650]  Cool, it'll be better because they're all very different like there's more
[01:38:38.290 --> 01:38:40.690]  nostalgic old-school lines and then there's more like
[01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:46.170]  Hype hashers in two different directions. So let's break it into three pieces. Um, uh
[01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:53.810]  So we'll do a hasher then we'll do an old-school then we'll do a hasher again, so let's start with these
[01:38:54.490 --> 01:38:58.050]  So these are both from my buddy drew at crystal rose seed
[01:38:58.330 --> 01:39:03.330]  Co he made the stardose II the dog breath and my loose Lucy
[01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:09.650]  So this is Apple of my eye, which is Apple fritter skittles hit with his pie. I mailed
[01:39:10.410 --> 01:39:14.290]  Pie I mail which the pie I is pie dough
[01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:17.010]  ogkb triple kush
[01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:23.930]  pie dough is a super famous hash making strain in Maine that got popular through mega raw and
[01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:30.630]  Then this is the same mail but hit two cookies and cream. So both of these are bred specifically for hash
[01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:35.050]  Usually if I find a keeper from drew it absolutely dumps
[01:39:35.050 --> 01:39:38.950]  So I'm not gonna say I always find keepers when I find good plants
[01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:45.570]  They tend to wash the loose Lucy being the exception, but that's just a super great B plant. So it's a little different
[01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:47.770]  So yeah, I'd be like both of these
[01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:52.170]  I'm trying to hold them to get them in the shot. Yeah, these are these are kind of the two options here
[01:39:52.650 --> 01:39:58.330]  Their sister line. So a lot of times I'll run things like this where the male is the same and the female is different
[01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:01.270]  that way if one of the
[01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:06.630]  One plant has dominant genes and something that you didn't predict and the gene pool kind of doesn't go your way
[01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:10.070]  There's a good chance that the other gene pool will go in your favor
[01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:11.910]  So I think you get a better
[01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:15.590]  You get to know the breeder better when you run two things from the same male
[01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:19.350]  Rather than just putting all your eggs in one basket being like, oh, they don't know what they're doing
[01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:21.350]  you got it, you got to give them a fair shot and
[01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:27.790]  You know give give the alleles and the genes a chance to line up and make the combinations that you're looking for
[01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:30.810]  But this breeder he breeds a lot of hype
[01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:36.630]  cutting edge stuff and he breeds for hash and those are really the two things that he likes to stay ahead of the hype and
[01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.690]  He likes to breed for watching numbers. So
[01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:48.010]  We started I know that that I know that apple fritter skittles, that's a popular clone
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:50.010]  I believe that was going around and I know
[01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:55.090]  Masonic was working with it and some other folks who are breeding for hash. They were using that one. No one's proven
[01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:59.490]  Yeah, so he'll he's really on the pulse and he'll go and scoop up
[01:40:59.610 --> 01:41:04.470]  You know a handful of newer cuts and like run them or have a friend run them and be like, okay
[01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:07.410]  We like these or whole gram from skunk foot or you know
[01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:09.930]  Like it's a pretty tight circle over there in Western, Maine
[01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.330]  and he's pretty good at scooping stuff up that uh
[01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:17.010]  That's that brings success for people and and putting him into his breeding projects. So
[01:41:17.610 --> 01:41:22.650]  Yeah, it's fun stuff. I've I've got the pie dough BX. I've got two packs of that
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:27.490]  So I figured I could let someone else play with these while I go through the through the BX
[01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:32.810]  So we got unique turps. We got Scott gross at a hundred DBS all the list
[01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:35.210]  appreciate
[01:41:35.210 --> 01:41:38.090]  Last time I ran the cookies and cream cross from this dude
[01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:42.570]  This shit was straight butterscotch milkshake like I kid you not caramel
[01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.170]  butterscotch
[01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:49.550]  Vanilla ice cream. It was so good. The structure was branchy
[01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:53.470]  It was just you know a hair on the small side which cookie plants are so it didn't stick around
[01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:55.510]  But it was really special
[01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:59.990]  It was like one of those things you don't want to show your friends because then they're only gonna want to buy that weed
[01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:03.110]  It was it was that kind of shit. So really pretty stuff
[01:42:04.110 --> 01:42:06.110]  30 seconds
[01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:09.670]  Two crosses that are
[01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:16.230]  Not very not gonna be well known able to produce unique turps that are gonna stand out in your area
[01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:19.030]  We got the leader with Scott we running it down
[01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:21.510]  10 seconds left
[01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:25.750]  Cookie cutter was the name of the cookies and cream cross and the skittles pie
[01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:31.350]  I cross is Apple of my eye because it's you know pie eyed male, right?
[01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:33.630]  So pretty good names
[01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:35.590]  They're gonna stick out on a menu
[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.750]  like when you
[01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:42.630]  when you go to a store to sell them your herb the last thing you want is for them to already have your strain and
[01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:48.430]  Working with breeders that are off the beaten path like ranch and and you know and toad people like that
[01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:52.510]  It's gonna give you an edge when you go to sell your pounds of herb to these stores
[01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:56.190]  And it's gonna make it where you're not competing with other people
[01:42:56.190 --> 01:42:58.790]  You don't have the fifth bag of wedding cake that's come in that month
[01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:04.550]  So, you know, I can't I can't recommend enough to just kind of get a little bit off the beaten path. So
[01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:07.070]  And that's time
[01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:09.790]  That's going to
[01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:11.870]  Sorry to interrupt ranch that's going to
[01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:15.870]  Scott Scott appreciate you dog
[01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:18.750]  So yeah, thanks Scott. You have some fun
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:24.590]  Those first two you want to put something in between or you want to go again Q totally up to you
[01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:29.190]  Yeah, yeah, I could I could go again and maybe we'll save the last one for later
[01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:33.790]  And unless someone's waiting somebody waiting. Yeah, does anybody want to jump on?
[01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:39.750]  Is anybody in a rush because I'm not in a rush and I if anybody's got somewhere to be then wants to put something
[01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:44.910]  But yo shout out cannabis Hills man. Appreciate you showing up if you turn your phone to your side
[01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:47.790]  It'll get you a better view so everybody can see you
[01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:57.870]  Signals bad, so I kind of want to move it
[01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.310]  I
[01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:17.110]  Was everyone tonight over there doing good. Oh, we're good man. We're here for Harry
[01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:21.830]  We appreciate everybody showing up and it's just so good to see all you guys some of you guys
[01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:27.230]  I haven't even connected with before and some of you guys I have but just like this is all Harry, you know
[01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:31.590]  Like he's he just put a man of an education and impacts
[01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:37.690]  To make sure he continues to be able to focus on doing what he's doing and helping people. So
[01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:41.750]  You coming man, why don't
[01:44:42.630 --> 01:44:46.370]  What camera says you want to throw something up man? I'd love for you, you know
[01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:49.590]  you know, so I
[01:44:50.190 --> 01:44:54.630]  Really haven't released any seed. There's been some seed I put in some people's hands and
[01:44:57.030 --> 01:45:02.750]  There's some see that I felt more comfortable as first generations to give somebody some
[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:07.010]  Some chance to look at him Harry was Harry is one of them people
[01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:09.170]  This last spring
[01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:12.090]  Harry did a pretty big seed hunt looking for
[01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:14.770]  Best of the best within his own
[01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:16.730]  work
[01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:21.610]  For those of you that haven't tried Harry's garlic rose rose exotics
[01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:26.530]  Garlic rose. It's a it's a live rosin, but this is made with
[01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:29.170]  Harry's GMO cookie
[01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:34.930]  Cross to hit Harry's chem dog. So like that's what's in available
[01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:41.890]  So like that's what's in available in the store so a good way to support Harry other than tonight is like
[01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:49.210]  Every Friday every Monday every day of the week drop into the dispensaries and like grab a Perry's work
[01:45:51.250 --> 01:45:57.370]  Before I talk about the seed, I mean it's it's important but what's more important is Harry and to know more about like
[01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:02.970]  What Harry's done what he's doing just like in a nutshell real quick from what I know
[01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:09.410]  And I've only known Harry for for a few years less than a handful of me like two or three but
[01:46:10.890 --> 01:46:12.890]  From what I know is
[01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:16.530]  Harry's dedicated to his patients. He's dedicated to the plant
[01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:19.730]  he's he's like
[01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:22.130]  He doesn't do it for the money
[01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:25.530]  But like when we're working and we're putting money into it
[01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:30.010]  we need to like at least stay alive and even like we've got bills and stuff, but
[01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:32.130]  like
[01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:34.130]  Harry does it because
[01:46:34.410 --> 01:46:37.310]  Well, Harry makes it because he takes it
[01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:40.250]  So if you really want to know the real story and everything about it
[01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:46.410]  you got to like start watching Harry because he puts it out there he gets real personal and and that's why
[01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:53.770]  That's why I'm like to be supportive. I mean it ain't it's it's just about that one of Harry's products
[01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:56.530]  His rosette his wellness
[01:46:57.130 --> 01:46:59.130]  One of my brothers my baby brother
[01:46:59.450 --> 01:47:01.330]  He's not a baby, but he's my youngest
[01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:07.330]  He takes it every day because it changed and it changes life like my brother needs it. I see my brother like
[01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:11.730]  Right in front of me dropped to the floor hold his chest like he was dying in the doctors
[01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:14.370]  They ain't even figured it out in the last year and a half
[01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:19.410]  They they give him all these pills for this for that this symptom and don't even diagnose him
[01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:21.850]  He started taking Harry's rosette wellness, which is I?
[01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:27.090]  Mean Harry makes here he makes full spectrum. I don't want to talk about his product
[01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:31.410]  I don't you gotta listen to Harry but but it changed my brother's everyday life and
[01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:39.610]  Harry puts it in Harry's helpful and it's time to help here. That's all I want to see Harry continue doing what he's doing and
[01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:42.410]  You know, it's for us
[01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:46.730]  consumers and patients and like lovers of this plant to like
[01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:53.130]  Want the best and Harry makes Harry puts up something the best like the best like it's there
[01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:56.210]  but anyway, so Harry grew out some seed and
[01:47:56.810 --> 01:48:01.690]  Some you know, these were these were like first gens like we don't know like some of them
[01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:04.890]  they look at a little but here he opened him up a little more and
[01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:14.210]  He's got some of them going he says they're solid I mean he washed any yet, but he's got full garlic turps
[01:48:14.210 --> 01:48:18.970]  This is a garlic GMO cookie that I have different than Harry's something
[01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:22.130]  I secured at a high times as a clone back in
[01:48:23.770 --> 01:48:25.770]  2019
[01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:30.010]  And I ran the plant and I loved it. I loved it
[01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:34.570]  Depending on how it express you get a little different effect
[01:48:35.890 --> 01:48:41.810]  Some people it'll knock them down some people lift them up for me for me. It lifts me up for most people
[01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:48.610]  It lifts up. It's like straight garlic and onion turps. No fruit in this GMO that I used
[01:48:49.210 --> 01:48:52.930]  However, the chili verde milk and I selected back in 2019
[01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:59.770]  It brings some some creaminess it brings some pepper for sure
[01:49:02.650 --> 01:49:06.450]  So like there's a lot of potential there and I don't know I got like I
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:12.370]  Got like 10 packs put up I mean 100 seeds we can we can do what you want
[01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:16.010]  I can do a few singles I can do some some some
[01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:19.830]  25 pack I do a 50 pack. I mean however you want to break it down
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.210]  I
[01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:26.410]  Also have other stuff I'd like to I
[01:49:27.490 --> 01:49:29.570]  Don't just throw them in and fatten it up
[01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:35.530]  These are these are I've never groomed these are ethos stuff that I got from
[01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:41.570]  a friend who got him from me from Colin I
[01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:45.370]  Mean I know how the vibe is in the industry
[01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:51.890]  I have still tasted some of his weed and even even if for me as I'm my everyday heavy user didn't
[01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:59.210]  Last as long as I like it still got me lifted like so and I only tried one of his smoke. So like this stuff's got
[01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:00.730]  I
[01:50:00.730 --> 01:50:03.570]  Mean I got OG Kush auto flower, which
[01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:07.970]  Actually, I think there's only three in that so we won't even that'll just be tossed in
[01:50:08.490 --> 01:50:10.210]  but uh
[01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:13.650]  Here's his rain maker. These are feminized and
[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.650]  Here's it
[01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:19.690]  This is a six-pack
[01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:26.050]  Yeah, these you can these you can I don't know if you can get them or not, but I've had them in the fridge for like
[01:50:26.970 --> 01:50:32.770]  Shit I don't know six seven eight years something like that. So do five five of your packs and
[01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:36.250]  then I mean, it's however you want to do it man, like
[01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:40.450]  Yeah, I put up a hundred seeds man. Like
[01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:44.490]  no, like there's fire in there man, just because they they
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:51.130]  Just say nobody just because nobody's raved about him yet. I know the parents I know stock
[01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:56.170]  Harry's growing them if you got see people want to just like Harry tells me that it looks solid
[01:50:56.170 --> 01:50:58.530]  that's all he can say because he watched a minute, but
[01:50:59.090 --> 01:51:00.530]  You know, it's for Harry
[01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:06.010]  So just if you want to check out some some good garlic turps a little peppery turps the garlic turps are dominant
[01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:10.610]  Coordinate with Harry seen but you know, I also got some other stuff
[01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:17.610]  That I could just put out there to fatten up so so people, you know help support Harry
[01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:20.730]  I got a strawberry cough. That's across to a
[01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:26.050]  What was a flow cough full cough f3 was the
[01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:29.770]  You know, I can't remember who they're from
[01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.930]  But I remember when I got him I wanted him
[01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:38.330]  He's like, yeah, I got you because I work with a strawberry cough from like 50 like for the last 15 years
[01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:41.690]  All right
[01:51:43.170 --> 01:51:46.490]  We're gonna get it started so we're gonna do five packs
[01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:49.810]  the garlic
[01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:52.730]  Work that you've done that Harry's grown out
[01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:58.450]  And then we're gonna do the two packs the six pack of ethos these right here
[01:51:58.850 --> 01:52:02.050]  And how many of how many seeds are in the other?
[01:52:02.370 --> 01:52:09.690]  Those the Rainmakers six feminized seeds. That's a citrus gone across to the Mandarin sunset and then
[01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:15.170]  Two minutes
[01:52:15.170 --> 01:52:17.490]  It's starting right now, so who's gonna kick it off
[01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:25.090]  This other ethos is an ethos chem OG. It's a reverse back cross one. It's Colorado chem
[01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:27.770]  reverse back cross
[01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:30.250]  Three
[01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:35.090]  Times okey. Oh gee cush reverse back cross for so, you know
[01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:39.970]  I don't really grow feminized seed, but I was interested in popping these I just never did
[01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:44.210]  You'd see garage we appreciate you
[01:52:46.530 --> 01:52:53.490]  Five packs of cannabis hills and the cannabis hills five packs. There you go. Chubby monkey. That's what you know
[01:52:53.850 --> 01:53:01.290]  Let's let's just let's be clear on on those GMO garlic cookie female and that chili bear day male I selected
[01:53:01.930 --> 01:53:08.530]  Although I matched them up and you know, whatever. Whoo. Whoo. That's other people's work. I got my own work
[01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:12.890]  I haven't really say my own work. I'm working on my stuff for a while now, but
[01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:18.530]  So I don't need credit for that. I just try to match up good what I can
[01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:22.050]  50 seconds left
[01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:28.690]  Five six seven packs of seeds chubby monkey 200 bucks. We got 40 seconds
[01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:34.050]  Anybody else in on this you got the GMO cross?
[01:53:34.890 --> 01:53:36.450]  garlic City
[01:53:36.450 --> 01:53:37.570]  plus
[01:53:37.570 --> 01:53:39.570]  two packs a ethos
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.640]  In the lead with 200 wait, how many how many of the garlic rose
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:01.560]  They're not garlic rose the garlic GMO cookie types chili verde a first-gen but
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.540]  Chili verde male or chili verde female reversed. No, it was a GMO
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.120]  Cookie, you know
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:17.120]  And it was a male chili verde that I selected. It's Afghani very broad big plant
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:22.260]  I got that I could know that well either way not tonight, but you know, I mean
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.360]  That's all
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:31.820]  Turned up the male put a lot of influence and pepper and a lot of different varietals across like
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.880]  So he's not dominant, but he does contribute a lot of the crosses
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:44.240]  Are the females are dominant, but he does contribute pretty heavy. He leaves his print though. He leaves. All right
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.240]  No, he was a good print up
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.040]  Monkey gets that yo Canada sells. I appreciate you Paul

[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  I like
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:35.200]  They're all original originals that I just pulled them off my wall and in the hallway
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:40.320]  And I'll have some packs of seeds with those two hall
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.360]  There you go
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.000]  Tony you'll kick in some seed packs with them y'all can decide if we want to do like all at one time or just
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.160]  individually one each
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:55.120]  If you want to do each I'll put a pack of seeds with each one you do just put them up there for
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.920]  Whatever you want man, I'll give them some one-hitter quitter packs
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.120]  How many of them are there

[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.920]  Okay, so small ones will do 15 packs of one-hitter quitter and I can do a 50 pack on the big one
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:44.240]  We're not gonna do the small ones one at a time
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.800]  Do them all together we'll do it we'll do three and then two but we just okay
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:00.920]  Also that are framed with with them like when the hurricanes blow the sand fence down I would reclaim the sand fence and build frames
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.360]  So have these two also
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.720]  Put up
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.040]  Where you are working out of sir, where you based on?
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.440]  Excuse me
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:15.000]  Where you based again? I live in Tidewater. I'm in Virginia
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:21.880]  Cool. Okay. What let's put the three choose the three small ones
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.960]  You're putting up and we're only going to show those for the next two minutes
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.320]  So right now and told what are you throwing in on this we're starting the clock
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.760]  well, if you're gonna do all three of them, I'll give a
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.320]  15 pack of for each one of those so you get three 15 pack the one-hitter quitter
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:46.280]  Will be a backpack which is the black walk fruit space cheese and a
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.600]  Back which is a backpack and a government cheese the GMO space cheese one you get three packing cheese does
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.760]  Amazing, bro. All right, we're definitely gonna get this guy's website, but let's focus on
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:04.960]  This is the only way you can get it pretty much is buying it like this it's really not for sale anymore
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:09.480]  250 more girl. I appreciate you more growing starting it off man
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.080]  So
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.160]  Right, you know that when you surf like it's all about finding a break from left to right
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.920]  Like if the if the waves just fold right in and you don't get any time for the for the wave to break from
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.320]  One side to the other it's not really that good a surf
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:30.560]  So like I don't know to me these like perfect crashes on the right where they unfold on the left like that
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.560]  It's it's really nice. Like I like
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.720]  That's a great description. So my done sir, that's awesome
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.720]  I

[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.040]  I
[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:05.960]  Can't get these paintings anywhere else. These are one of ones with the three pack from
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.720]  backpack and three 100 quid as the seats are
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.160]  Backpack pack and a fucking government cheese pack. They all have 15 seeds in them
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.540]  Ones across the GMO ones across the black walk through
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.280]  I'll show you guys the mail
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.240]  Let me see if I can yeah, where is he?

[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.660]  extremely resonated in purple
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:29.140]  You've got it Brian
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.700]  That's a nice cross now man anyone else
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:39.020]  We are currently on the government cheese that's part of that I showed earlier
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.180]  There's the alarm
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:45.300]  Going once
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.540]  Going twice
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:56.500]  There's another top off of the the government cheese
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.300]  Yeah
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:05.500]  All right mogul I took that 420 Adam terpene tasting team right in the book and
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.540]  Let's thank you, man, bro
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.260]  let's
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:15.900]  Let's go to Q. Let's take another let's go back to Q and do some
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:20.660]  Q so just real quick shout out Adam for terpene tasting
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:24.620]  He's been helping when I say help and really just doing the whole fucking thing
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:28.380]  But he's been getting my website up and I have a website up and I'll be able to do
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.700]  Direct a patient with everybody with the med card
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.600]  You know as long as they come to my state
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:39.260]  So really excited about that super big big deal for me big accomplishment
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:42.900]  to be able to work directly with patients and stuff and
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:48.380]  Yeah, I'm super pumped. So on on another note, thanks Adam
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:54.800]  But yeah, I got a I got two packs of seeds. So ones from relic and one from dynasty which are both
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.540]  professor P if you guys
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:01.060]  You know are aware that he's the breeder for both of these companies
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:07.420]  Relic is more of like preservation work, right and dynasty is more like line work more like
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:10.500]  More for like, you know
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:14.700]  directional like finished masterpiece kind of plants and lines
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:23.120]  Whereas relic is more preservation. So this is the thunder fruit, which is Madagascar Thunderfuck to the grapefruit f2
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.400]  I believe
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.280]  Yeah, and this is like the sweeter juicier grapefruit
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:34.560]  And the madness could Thunderfuck is is a super pure Afghani type really short really squat
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.120]  Really fast finishing like close to 50-day kind of stuff
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:46.120]  and the resin is is is pretty tough and dry from the Afghani types and helps some of the grapefruits be
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:51.840]  More available to to you know to washing you're not necessarily gonna find a washer
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:56.400]  But it does make those juicy grapefruit turps like possible for you to find them in washing
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:00.460]  Which is why I grabbed it, but it seems like it might need a new home other than me
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:06.600]  so that's the one and the other is the lime very mega so
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:11.580]  We were standing outside at flask lounge, which is like
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.600]  It's like a bar EDM, you know spot in Portland, Maine and
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:23.640]  P was burning one of these and I just got the craziest like incense like really really
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.680]  incense stick blueberry floral incense like smell ever and I was like
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:35.360]  What the fuck are you smoking and I'm very mega and so I immediately was like word. Let me fucking get one
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.860]  So these have the mega fauna in them, which is Cali snapple super silver haze
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.700]  So you get this Matt like Collins of
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:47.860]  Sativa genetics and then they're hit with this huckleberry, which is a classic blueberry type. Oh
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:55.780]  Yeah, so you're gonna get this really nice blueberry type that's gonna kind of bring down the flower time make the bud density better
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:01.380]  You know, it's gonna it's gonna make it a more practical plant, but you're gonna get these crazy sativa expressions
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:05.900]  You know and kind of get them locked into a more practical frame more practical plant
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:12.420]  So that's you know, Professor Pete doesn't do a lot of polyhybrids. So usually when he does it's like why the fuck did he do that?
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.560]  So this is one of those where it's like, okay
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:20.020]  He doesn't usually do a lot of stuff like this and I think somebody will have a lot of fun if they if they grab it
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:22.020]  So these are the two that we're doing
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:26.620]  And we can just start at like 75. I think that's like more than more than reasonable
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:32.780]  The limeberry mega is really hard to get your hands on and I don't think the grapefruit f2 male is gonna get reused
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:37.840]  Maybe for at least for at least for a fucking while for sure. Yeah
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:40.540]  Got two minutes on the clock
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:44.860]  Professor P has some fire ass weed. I had the same thing happened to me when I met him
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:49.620]  He was smoking some shit that smelled so much different than everything else in the room
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:52.100]  I had to walk over to him like what are you smoking brother?
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:57.460]  Fucking he he had the fire. He was smoking some of the Miss Universe some crossed us something
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:04.200]  I can't remember but the smell was intoxicating did it cut through everything else and there was like 15 other breeders in the room
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.020]  We all had fire, but he should popped off hard
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:11.220]  Yeah, dude, he takes growing weed really seriously like just a man
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:15.900]  I mean so it's like he comes through some jars that are just like fucking nuts. Yeah
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:20.860]  Pps a fucking the man that dude knows what he's doing when it comes to breeding plants
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:26.500]  Yeah, man, he take he takes it super seriously. And yeah, he's always up to some cool shit
[02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:29.860]  I'm always trying to learn from him and he's just a great fucking person like
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:34.660]  Down to it. So oh, yeah, that's the homie. Yeah. Oh
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:39.460]  Yeah, I just figured that out so I don't have to hold that. All right
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:46.060]  50 seconds on the clock two packs up
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:48.300]  Let's go
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:50.100]  Rotten skateboards is hungry for it
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.780]  Dustin came with 150 but Ron came back with 160
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:58.140]  It's Dustin gonna get into a little bit of a little bit of a pissing match here. Let's go
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:03.220]  Dude, these these library megas are really hard to get and Alaskan Thunderfuck
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:09.260]  I mean, it's Matt news get Thunderfuck, but we all know that's fucking Alaskan Thunderfuck to grapefruit is not you know
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:15.820]  That shit doesn't I don't I haven't seen that available online. Like I think that was an in-person thing only that I grabbed
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:18.820]  First time I met him like a year and a half ago. So
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:25.300]  Yeah, it's there, you know, they're they're things I was I was having trouble parting with but
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:29.260]  These days I usually don't keep stuff unless I have two or more packs
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:34.500]  So I was like, I only got one pack of these, you know, hopefully somebody will find something special. So
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.780]  Seconds left everybody
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:45.300]  Let's look in let's get Harry helped out. I mean that dudes fucking just he's like just
[02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:47.940]  Radiates, you know passion, you know
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:53.780]  like there's no there's very few people even close to the level of passion that that guy has for this plant and
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:58.620]  Especially for saving people with the plan. I mean a lot of us love the plant for ourselves
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:04.520]  Yes, you look people with the plant and it's awesome agree more brother. We're letting it roll
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:07.060]  another minute on the clock
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:09.500]  See where it goes
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.660]  Rotten with 185 Dustin coming back at 200
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.580]  We got 55
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.980]  Seconds, we're gonna let it go
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:24.420]  Rhymes a straight G dude puts the stuff together and then bids on half of the stuff like come on
[02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.740]  He knows what's up hungry for it, man
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:31.380]  It just gets us in here to steal all our seats. He's a genius
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:37.380]  Dustin's in the lead with 200. We got these two packs from professor Q up for grabs from
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:43.700]  From another professor and yeah from the from the OG professor
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:57.820]  Yeah, dude, so yeah people don't know like dynasty and relic like do your homework like he he's been
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:04.740]  You know, he's he's in that kind of second era of you know, okay, we're not doing UK Amsterdam breeding anymore
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:08.700]  Like, you know as far as like modern we're gonna grow weed inside
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:13.980]  He's definitely one of those those bigger people that that made a big footprint in in you know
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.460]  In the way that that plants are now
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:22.380]  And just held a lot of old stuff like the coffin and Miss Universe and Oregon Afghani
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:26.540]  Tons of old plants that got muddled and lost he still has them in their original form. So
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:30.700]  Yeah, and I mean there's certainly nothing wrong with doing hype shit
[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:35.420]  I love buying hype shit, but that dude stays true to what he thinks is good weed and
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:39.140]  It's really important because that it allows those
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:45.500]  Corners of the cannabis gene pool to be unwavered and we need people like that to like say this is my fucking corner
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:47.700]  I'm gonna hold this shit down and then I'm gonna hold this shit down
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:51.060]  And we need people like that to like say this is my fucking corner
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.660]  I'm gonna hold this shit down and it's not gonna get muddled. So
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:56.180]  Yeah, it's really important stuff
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:09:00.700]  Yeah, and and he's awesome people. I mean he had bubble bags when I was in fucking high school
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.380]  So dude, dude knows what he's doing when it comes to hash too
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:10.300]  And if you look at his photography like he's the reason zoom does what zoom does like not not like solely
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:15.900]  But when you talk to zoom like like professor P is like one of the first people in the cannabis trichome macro space
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:20.780]  Period so there's a lot of different avenues that that dude pioneered

[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:05.580]  Five packs of the
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:11.380]  The GMO garlic cookies and chili bear the OG and then I
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:16.380]  Guess that's like the rest of them and then why don't I just put these in there too? These are those
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.660]  20 20 garlic seeds 20 garlic Pile verde seeds
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:33.380]  So I'm gonna put two minutes and 30 seconds on the clock and I'm gonna let you talk about that specific crafts
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:39.660]  Okay, right on things. So the the GMO cookie is a straight
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:43.380]  Garlic and onions no fruit on that
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:50.380]  Top top, I mean it grows good on top or top but top it made like I
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:53.820]  Don't even know 18 and 18 inch coal is indoor
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.500]  the resin itself
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.500]  Depending on your environment and how it expressed
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:06.740]  I mean, I've had the plants known a little not a little but a lot skunky and then I mean the granules are
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:09.060]  very bulbous
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:13.480]  Sticky and kind of a dry sticky so I mean
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:20.340]  I've never watched it. But I mean I would imagine really good washer the male chili verde that I selected used
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:24.740]  Was an Afghani leaning very very big frame plant
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:33.820]  In veg it had a stem rub of like green banana and then in bloom it was like sweet banana so
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:41.460]  Right when it comes to other crosses that I have worked chili verde influences it's there
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.980]  But from what I hear with Harry who's run those the season full term
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:52.060]  They're still in the ground the GMO to the very day that they're turning up a lot of garlic turps
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:57.960]  Chili, very they pepper is present some but mostly turning up garlic turps. So
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:00.660]  You know
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.180]  As far as for doing it for Harry being helpful Harry is I
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:12.060]  Mean I've given him a lot of time listening, but Harry's given his time educating
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:15.620]  He spent so much knowledge and
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.900]  Just to give back

[02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:28.370]  Basically a root beer to a sibling of root beer Jaro is
[02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:32.970]  It's the same thing. It's like a pretty underrated plant, but I've been
[02:21:33.490 --> 02:21:38.690]  Jaro crosses for a couple years now and finding like root beer and ginger ale turps really cool stuff
[02:21:39.370 --> 02:21:43.770]  so Jaro Jaro is the headband version of
[02:21:44.850 --> 02:21:46.850]  Root beer root beer being the sour
[02:21:47.810 --> 02:21:51.650]  Beer is headband Jaro is sour diesel. Okay

[02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:15.530]  Legs. Oh, okay. We're gonna just put that single pack up because that's a pack and a half
[02:22:17.130 --> 02:22:20.210]  So well, yeah, they were super limited
[02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:23.770]  Jackson knows I'm putting it up. He's pretty pumped
[02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:25.890]  There weren't many of them at all
[02:22:25.890 --> 02:22:31.130]  I think it was a speakeasy VIP release and they didn't even make it to the public. They got sold on VIP
[02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:35.650]  I'm gonna put I'm gonna put for I'm gonna put four minutes on the clock
[02:22:35.650 --> 02:22:40.890]  I'm gonna start having a dab and I'm gonna let you and professor Q and
[02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:47.530]  Anybody else who wants to jump in chat about this pack and we can start the bidding. It's starting now four minutes is on the clock
[02:22:47.810 --> 02:22:49.810]  So
[02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:58.370]  I've never even seen a jar o mail like used before like I can't think of another circumstance where he did use it. I
[02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:02.850]  Have a couple cross. I think I have some yes go G. Jaro
[02:23:03.730 --> 02:23:06.410]  Sky color double Chris Charles a bunch of it
[02:23:07.330 --> 02:23:11.690]  But I've been fortunate enough to smoke mean jeans actual root beer
[02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:18.010]  And it's cool like I found a bunch of stuff that was really similar and other stuff like even freebies
[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:20.290]  He's been giving out over the years like the lime pop
[02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:27.050]  Sky Jaro and things like that. You're finding these really cool root beer sweet sassafras really effervescent
[02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:29.730]  turps within the line herbal
[02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:34.050]  Just really so so between the jar when the root beer
[02:23:34.210 --> 02:23:38.450]  How did what do you feel the main differences are like you reach for one over the other?
[02:23:38.450 --> 02:23:40.450]  Do you feel like one's more diesel ones more?
[02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:44.090]  Sarsaparilla or like how do you kind of put them in your own words?
[02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:47.810]  Well, I've never had the jar Oh pure
[02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:55.890]  I've only had it as a cross with things and I really like the jar of going into anything because it's just it it
[02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:57.890]  adds that really
[02:23:58.050 --> 02:24:00.050]  funky effervescent
[02:24:00.130 --> 02:24:05.770]  Bubbliness where I don't know something just really unique about the mouth feel of it and the flavor of it
[02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:10.410]  And straight
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:16.890]  Is everything big that it hits does it add size to things like a diesel or a headband and plant might
[02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:24.170]  It's it's it's pretty much like a like a diesel or a head boy and been similar structure for sure
[02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:28.530]  Yeah, I've been digging into the mean mug the line at this point
[02:24:29.170 --> 02:24:31.010]  We're at f3 with it
[02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:37.010]  I'd bought a bunch of packs from the original drop and sent them to a buddy in Slovenia chucking snail
[02:24:37.570 --> 02:24:39.570]  He sifted through him and found
[02:24:40.050 --> 02:24:44.170]  What mean genius said probably like the closest thing to his root beer clone
[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:52.450]  To those this season I've gone through and eliminated like anything with that GMO funk to it
[02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:57.050]  Yeah, whoever
[02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:01.090]  Three mean mugs to
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:08.850]  We're only a 210 let's go people this is ridiculous. Let's run this up. This is for Harry. This is a good cause
[02:25:08.850 --> 02:25:11.490]  These are limited packs. This is craziness. I
[02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:16.210]  Mean like
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:22.240]  Headbands all around in those first two
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.880]  so the coca-cola is
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.560]  Root beer hit to is there a GMO in there? What kind of a GMO is that?
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:34.480]  Root beer hit to is there a GMO in there? What makes it coca-cola again?
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:40.360]  No, there's no GMO in this at all. This is just a pheno of root beer. Oh
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:42.280]  cool
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:45.840]  So that's a that's a like a selection out of a root beer seed line
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.120]  Correct. Oh
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:50.640]  Fuck. Yeah, damn damn
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:57.920]  Diesel's ran some cream. They always have you can work this for 50 seconds left. We got 325
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:00.960]  Yo
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:04.960]  Farming coming in hot get it
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.800]  36 seconds left
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:13.680]  If PO gets those seeds they're gonna get popped at my farm so
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:17.280]  Everybody else needs a chill
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:22.280]  Rotten skateboards, it's they're staying in Maine. It's looking like they're staying in Maine
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:28.160]  Bringing them up. They're gonna go on the first the phenol. I'm gonna get here
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.840]  We'll call it the Theo hunt it'll be lit
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.120]  Go 10 seconds left there right now. They're in rotten's hands two seconds
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:41.960]  Rotten
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:44.680]  Yo
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  Appreciate you rotten
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:02.900]  You have the opportunity
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:13.320]  It's
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:15.080]  the opportunity, you can come back.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.940]  We won't hold it, like it's not a bad look.
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:19.200]  You have the opportunity.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.200]  We will allow a restrike, but I won't hold you anymore
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.440]  if you do it, all right?
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.400]  All right, and Rik, congratulations, those are yours.
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.280]  Fucking right, fucking right.
[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:37.000]  We had another homie, Jimmy Toucan.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.360]  I didn't say what's up, man.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:40.520]  Thank you so much for coming by.
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:42.320]  Thanks, you know.
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.640]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:45.440]  Good, man.
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:46.880]  Appreciate you stopping in
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:49.400]  and appreciate you showing love for Harry.
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.000]  What, did you have any packs you wanted to put up?
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.440]  Yeah, I got a couple little packages I can throw up.
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:57.400]  Fire, fire.
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:02.000]  Are they your work or are they someone else's?
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.800]  This is all for me.
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:05.360]  Oh, fire, that's dope.
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:06.720]  Where are you based out of?
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.320]  We're on the East Coast.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:10.160]  Oh, very cool.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.600]  What the Northeast, so.
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:16.720]  The B coast.
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:19.320]  The B coast.
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.000]  What do you got, what are you putting up?
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.560]  All right, so for the first set,
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.440]  let's do some longer flowering stuff.
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:34.600]  I got one of the last packs of Tommy Badger,
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:38.840]  which is Honey Badger Haze from Dynasty.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:44.120]  That's a female selection of mine.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.680]  Lots of melon, a little bit of vanilla.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.320]  Big, big plants.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.400]  They just, they get a little floppy though
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:54.600]  the last couple of weeks.
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.360]  They do need a little attention.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:28:59.800]  So it's the Honey Badger Haze
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:02.360]  hit with Tom Hill Haze Male.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:06.320]  That's I think a 15 pack of that.
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:09.160]  A 15 pack of Original Recipe,
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:14.160]  which is an old cut of Flying Dutchman's Original Haze
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:17.240]  hit with the Coca-Cola Root Beer Male.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.320]  And a pack of Astro Zombie F2,
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:27.320]  which is Hill Tribe Mung Thai from, let's see, RC Colas
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:35.280]  from ICMAG, and that was hit with Vietnamese Black.
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:37.720]  So pretty good range there.
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:40.480]  All longer flowering everywhere from kind of mellow happy
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:43.860]  to peeling your eyelids back.
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:46.520]  All 15 packs on those.
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:50.160]  Vanilla, melon, haze?
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.240]  Come on.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:55.200]  Like that is pretty much it for me.
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:57.040]  Like I chase hazes for a fact,
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:29:59.400]  not as much the flavor profiles
[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:00.560]  that I typically encounter.
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:04.160]  And so to have something that's melony and fire.
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:08.040]  All right, we're gonna put three minutes on the clock
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:10.760]  and we're gonna start chatting about this right now.
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:13.520]  So three minutes going on the clock.
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:15.360]  We've already started at 75.
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.320]  Rodden, you know Rodden's heavy for those sativas
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:21.120]  and he's in the mix now.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:22.480]  So he's in it.
[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.680]  He's got his beak wet.
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:27.860]  So yeah, tell us more about these packs.
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:29.540]  You can keep going.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:31.840]  Yeah, so the Astro Zombie,
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.420]  I started a few years ago with,
[02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:40.260]  I went through a bunch of RC's Juicy Fruit Thai
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:43.620]  and I really liked the Juicy Fruit,
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:46.520]  especially indoors because it is a little more manageable.
[02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:53.660]  And it's a great kind of gateway for people
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:56.920]  who wanna get into the longer flowering stuff,
[02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:01.000]  but don't quite want that really sweaty,
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.040]  paranoid inducing kind of stuff.
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:10.040]  So, and it made a great partner with the Vietnamese.
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:14.220]  They both come through, like you'll get Juicy Fruit,
[02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:17.680]  you'll get some of that kind of dirty church floor
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:20.980]  from the hay side.
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:24.880]  And then occasionally some goofballs
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:28.680]  from the mung tile pop out.
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:32.860]  Once in a while you'll find the peach expression in there.
[02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:38.740]  But they get real big, real branchy
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:41.820]  and good amount of stretch.
[02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:46.180]  But they're still manageable indoors.
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:47.420]  I just don't, you know,
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:50.140]  you veg them short and flower them quick, so.
[02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:52.620]  Sounds like you're playing
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.980]  with a lot of equatorial types inside.
[02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:57.300]  Is that kind of your happy place?
[02:31:58.700 --> 02:32:01.220]  Well, yeah, I mean, I like to play with a lot of stuff.
[02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:03.500]  So, I mean, that's, but they're definitely,
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:06.100]  definitely high on my list.
[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:08.460]  You know, the next couple of years
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:10.460]  we'll get more into doing some stuff outdoors,
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:14.420]  but we got so many people trying to pull these off indoors
[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:19.420]  that, you know, it's been a good ride.
[02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:24.420]  It's been a good ride, you know,
[02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:27.100]  trying to figure out how to tame them indoors,
[02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:28.420]  how best to grow them indoors.
[02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:31.580]  And really it's, I mean, it's not all that hard.
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:34.420]  You just don't get crazy, you know,
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.820]  trying to grow big ass plants
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.700]  because you'll end up with, you know,
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:39.180]  you'll end up chopping the shit out of it
[02:32:39.180 --> 02:32:41.700]  two weeks, three, four weeks in the flower, you know.
[02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:44.500]  So do you like to run your light cycle
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:46.540]  like 11 on, 13 off?
[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:47.660]  You do anything like that
[02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:50.220]  for these more equatorial types?
[02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.220]  Yeah, with the long flowering ones,
[02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:57.220]  we start out at like 11, 11 and a half hours.
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:00.660]  And I work my way down to nine.
[02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:01.500]  Whoa.
[02:33:02.380 --> 02:33:05.860]  So we kind of just slowly, you know,
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:07.220]  every week or 10 days,
[02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:09.140]  you cut the light back about 15 minutes,
[02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:10.420]  15 minutes, 15 minutes.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:11.340]  So you get down to,
[02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.300]  we end up about nine hours on the long flowering room.
[02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:17.220]  That's fucking pro tip right there, dude.
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:19.620]  That's super sick, man.
[02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:22.260]  All right, J5, congratulations.
[02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:26.020]  You got yourself some beautiful long flowering plants.
[02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:28.860]  Jimmy, we're gonna be right back to you.
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.220]  We're gonna jump over to Cabrone the Cam.
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:32.860]  Am I saying that right, brother?
[02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:34.900]  Yeah, buddy, the Cabrone.
[02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:35.980]  Appreciate you, man.
[02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:38.140]  Appreciate you coming out and showing love for Harry.
[02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:38.980]  Of course, man.
[02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:40.820]  Around Skateboard Said Charity, I came running.
[02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:44.900]  So basically to keep up with the Mean Gene train,
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:47.220]  not on the Coca-Cola root beer train yet,
[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:51.220]  but these are some F4s I made on the Sky Cuddler.
[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:54.060]  So if anybody's into that kush,
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:57.740]  that really good piney, you know, earthy,
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:33:58.860]  kind of like the TK,
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:00.780]  but a little bit less of that earthy finish,
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:02.100]  more of that kind of master kush,
[02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:05.780]  like sweet kind of piney, totally up your alley.
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:10.500]  I use the Sky Cuddler, so that's like 10 seeds.
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:12.340]  And we'll do that super cheap, man,
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:13.260]  since you guys, you know,
[02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:14.500]  all these cool high runners there.
[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:15.900]  I've got a shit ton of these F4s.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:19.460]  So if you guys want to start them at like maybe 40 bucks
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:22.060]  or something like that, man, keep it super cheap.
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:23.820]  We got two minutes on the clock.
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:25.260]  And yeah, man, I'd love to learn.
[02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:26.860]  So did you grow these outdoors?
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:28.780]  How'd you do the cross?
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:29.620]  Like-
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:30.460]  So I did.
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:34.460]  So I went out to and picked these up from Gene in 2018.
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:36.300]  We're over here on the East Coast in Maryland.
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.700]  So I grew those indoors and outdoors.
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:41.300]  Outdoors, we're super humid here.
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:42.800]  So it gets a little bit leafy,
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:45.960]  but still super just tasty, man.
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:48.480]  I didn't find a single one that I didn't enjoy.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:50.160]  I ended up keeping two males.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.080]  I kept the taller one,
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.400]  which is a more like kush representative
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.360]  and use that a bunch of my crosses themselves.
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:59.820]  So anybody that actually picks those up,
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.680]  I'm going to throw in some Sour Best Shit Ever
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.920]  across to the Ancient OG,
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.300]  across to that Sky Cuddler Kush Male as well.
[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:12.900]  Wabuddy just kicked it off at 50 bucks.
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:17.900]  So you're getting a 10 pack of the Sky Cuddler F4.
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:20.780]  And then-
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.780]  And then 10 of the Sour Best Shit Ever
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.060]  across to Ancient OG.
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.620]  That's from Bodhi and Green Bodhi.
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:28.380]  That was a collab they did for the Dalai Lama project.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:33.380]  And then I selected a more like earthy kind of cushy one,
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:36.540]  like I said, a little bit more on the pine side as well.
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:39.300]  Cause I'm just into that piney old weed, man.
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:40.860]  I come from like that era, dude.
[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:42.320]  Like we just love good OG.
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:44.340]  So I did that selection.
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:46.820]  I hit with the taller cushy Sky Cuddler Male.
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:49.260]  So if you're into good kush,
[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:51.580]  it makes a super tacky resin as well.
[02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:53.640]  I haven't washed it or anything like that,
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.100]  but indoors I found a really good tacky resin.
[02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:58.940]  I haven't ran the Sour Best Shit Ever
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:01.220]  Ancient OG Sky Cuddler outside,
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:02.800]  but indoors it does fucking awesome.
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:04.360]  But the Sky Cuddler itself outdoors
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.700]  does great here in our area.
[02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:07.420]  So I'm sure it does great anywhere
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:09.100]  where it's a little bit more dry.
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:10.340]  First name, last name.
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:14.020]  We got 10 seconds left in the lead with a hundred.
[02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:16.020]  Anyone want to snipe?
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:17.360]  Now's your chance.
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:22.620]  That's for the two packs.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:27.620]  So shout out first name, last name with the snag.
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.140]  Appreciate you.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.020]  Are you moving that like away from the lemon lime
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:37.140]  and more towards like the pine soap kind of side of things?
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:38.680]  Yeah, more like the pine,
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:41.700]  like almost so piney that it's like Christmas tree.
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:44.740]  Think of like a Christmas candle or something like that.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:48.180]  I'm a real sucker for, I don't know, man.
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:50.600]  I had a bag of like the Hell's Angels years ago
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.500]  that just like, it went from like, it wasn't as gassy.
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:55.700]  It was more fucking like piney.
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:58.380]  And I just have been chasing that flavor ever since, man.
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:00.140]  And then I ended up finding some really good
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:02.580]  Master Kush Crosses from Duke.
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:04.780]  They gave me that piney like resin material.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:07.080]  So I ended up just like chasing it even more and more
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:08.340]  and found it in the Sky Cutler.
[02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:10.540]  It was just flat on what I was looking for.
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:12.580]  So I ran with that male that I had.
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:15.420]  And even the shorter male, I had ran with some other crosses
[02:37:15.420 --> 02:37:17.340]  but the taller ones what I kept.
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:20.920]  Cabrone, we had a last minute snipe.
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:24.460]  Are you able to double down and do two people
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:28.180]  for double at a hundred so we can double it up?
[02:37:28.180 --> 02:37:29.100]  Damn right, dude.
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:29.940]  Absolutely, man.
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.220]  Anything for Harry, dude.
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:32.980]  Yo, appreciate you, bro.
[02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:33.820]  For sure, man.
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:35.540]  Thank you to Cabrone the Cam.
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:38.400]  Okay, B and first name, last name.
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.580]  You both are gonna get it for a hundred, bro.
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:43.180]  Okay, B, I appreciate you spending your money
[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:44.780]  and putting that out like that.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:46.680]  So appreciate you.
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:50.940]  Anyone who wants to step up,
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:54.080]  I've got some stuff given to me by some individuals
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:57.000]  in the community, but is there anybody in a rush
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.820]  or have somewhere to be?
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:00.960]  I'm happy to jump to them.
[02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:05.360]  Do you want to, do we wanna do the,
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:10.700]  do we wanna do the, I guess let's do Kaya.
[02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:15.440]  I'll put up, Kaya, it's his kid's birthday
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.820]  so he can't make it, but he wanted to give his respect
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:21.000]  to Mr. Harry Rose.
[02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:26.820]  And so we're going to, I just have to pull it up.
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:29.060]  So many people have messaged me for things to put up
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:31.840]  for them, Kaya.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.500]  All right, so Kaya is going, we're gonna be putting up
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:42.220]  one pack of coffee F7, as well as one pack
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:46.720]  of strawberry yogurt by Royal Sour Coffee.
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:53.380]  So I'm almost wanting to split these,
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:57.840]  but yeah, let's split them.
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:59.080]  We're gonna split them.
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.460]  We're gonna just put the coffee F7 up
[02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:02.500]  and we're gonna put it out.
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:03.480]  Cause I think, you know what?
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:05.860]  That's the best way to get the most money for Harry.
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:07.280]  And I got the time.
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:11.260]  So if you guys got the time, we're gonna do it that way.
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:14.200]  So we're just gonna put up the coffee F7 right now.
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:16.180]  I'm gonna start the clock.
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:18.080]  I'm gonna only put it for two minutes.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:21.580]  Not much needs to be said about.
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:26.440]  I'm actually running these right now.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:28.360]  I chopped them down.
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:32.800]  Well, I chopped seven of nine of them down two days ago.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.880]  I'm in Northern Vermont.
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:37.520]  It's been really cold and kind of shitty
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:38.480]  the end of the season.
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:40.720]  They've gone through three frosts.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:43.120]  They are some of the most resilient genetics
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.480]  I've run with in a long time.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.480]  I've had a lot of things up here in Vermont
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:50.700]  in a new environment that I've really struggled with.
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:54.600]  Blight issues, leaf spotting,
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:57.560]  even just things dying off from the cold,
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:58.920]  like really, really cold.
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.680]  And these plants fucking kick ass.
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:02.920]  They stink.
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:04.880]  They're frosty as fuck.
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:08.200]  They're not the biggest, most vigorous plants,
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.660]  but fuck man.
[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:11.800]  I don't know which one I'm gonna keep.
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:13.560]  I'm gonna run a shitload of them next year.
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:15.300]  I tell you that much.
[02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:17.360]  I got the boys alive.
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:19.240]  I got them all backed up.
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:20.600]  Those plants are killer.
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.380]  So whoever gets this, I'll give them to you.
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.220]  200 from Dave.
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:25.040]  Dave's not there.
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:25.880]  One minute left.
[02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:28.340]  Coffee is fucking up.
[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:31.100]  If I'm correct, this is Green Source's work, right?
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:32.500]  And not Kaia's work?
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:33.340]  Because Kaia-
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:37.700]  I imagine it's that Green Source Pacific Northwest
[02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:39.860]  collab, Woodbox.
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:41.460]  Yeah.
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:43.140]  Because Kaia's not putting them out at this point.
[02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:45.620]  This is kind of a collab with both of them on it.
[02:40:45.620 --> 02:40:47.300]  Is that kind of how this one went?
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:50.920]  So this is Nick and Roscoe Paul throwing it down,
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:52.120]  which is, in my opinion,
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:54.560]  those are like two of the heaviest hitters,
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:57.400]  you know, in the Pacific Northwest.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.400]  Both super regenerative agricultural practices
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:02.360]  and both take breeding really seriously
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:04.640]  and hash making extremely seriously.
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:07.000]  Yeah.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.160]  210.
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:10.440]  Canna man Dan.
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:18.540]  10 seconds left.
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:22.020]  Does Dave have a response?
[02:41:29.010 --> 02:41:30.650]  210.
[02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:32.090]  Give him a second for lag.
[02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:36.210]  I think he's going home with these.
[02:41:39.350 --> 02:41:40.430]  Awesome.
[02:41:40.430 --> 02:41:41.270]  All right.
[02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:42.510]  210, Canna man Dan.
[02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:43.950]  Adam, note it.
[02:41:43.950 --> 02:41:46.310]  The coffee F7, Green Source Gardens,
[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:48.630]  Kaia work is going off.
[02:41:51.010 --> 02:41:51.850]  I think-
[02:41:51.850 --> 02:41:53.510]  Talking line work.
[02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:54.350]  Talking line work.
[02:41:54.350 --> 02:41:55.630]  Talking line work, bro.
[02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:57.030]  I think how much you got.
[02:41:57.170 --> 02:42:01.250]  I think that art piece is calling to me, man.
[02:42:01.250 --> 02:42:02.250]  That's a beautiful,
[02:42:02.250 --> 02:42:04.370]  that's a thing of beauty right there.
[02:42:06.890 --> 02:42:09.370]  You want to put up the next two pieces or?
[02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:11.890]  Two pieces.
[02:42:11.890 --> 02:42:14.390]  I think that piece alone is pretty nice.
[02:42:16.290 --> 02:42:19.050]  Do the big boy by itself.
[02:42:19.050 --> 02:42:19.890]  Yeah.
[02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:21.570]  Oh, wow.
[02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:23.850]  And that's-
[02:42:23.850 --> 02:42:25.450]  This is the one on linen, right?
[02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:27.470]  Yes, it's on stretched linen.
[02:42:28.430 --> 02:42:32.630]  Got hanger wire on it.
[02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:33.670]  Could see right through it.
[02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:34.950]  That's fucking tight.
[02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:35.810]  Yeah.
[02:42:35.810 --> 02:42:37.490]  That's beautiful, bro.
[02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:38.330]  All right.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:40.030]  We're starting the bidding
[02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:41.870]  and we're just going to let it go.
[02:42:43.450 --> 02:42:46.510]  I'm going to put three minutes on the clock.
[02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:49.310]  We'll add these four packs that Cheddar Bob kicked in.
[02:42:49.310 --> 02:42:51.990]  We've got a, what do we got?
[02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:54.950]  Legend OG Kush Fims.
[02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:58.450]  Some dragons with matches CBD stuff.
[02:42:58.450 --> 02:43:00.350]  Pack of my Bob's cheddar
[02:43:00.350 --> 02:43:05.210]  and a winter circle F2 from Soul Rebel.
[02:43:05.210 --> 02:43:08.410]  That's another four packs of seeds that'll go with that.
[02:43:08.410 --> 02:43:09.250]  There you go.
[02:43:10.290 --> 02:43:11.130]  Awesome.
[02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:19.570]  All right, guys.
[02:43:19.570 --> 02:43:20.410]  Well, I'm going to bow out,
[02:43:20.410 --> 02:43:22.370]  give someone else a chance to get into the group here.
[02:43:22.370 --> 02:43:23.450]  It's my birthday.
[02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:25.450]  It's like 12 o'clock here on the East coast.
[02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:27.210]  So I'm going to go back to sleep.
[02:43:28.370 --> 02:43:30.210]  Happy birthday, man.
[02:43:30.210 --> 02:43:31.530]  I appreciate it, man.
[02:43:31.530 --> 02:43:32.850]  Happy birthday, man.
[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:34.530]  Thank you guys.
[02:43:34.530 --> 02:43:36.430]  Hey, love the Harry and love you guys.
[02:43:36.430 --> 02:43:37.890]  So much respect over there, Toad.
[02:43:37.890 --> 02:43:39.250]  You're the fucking man.
[02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:40.090]  See you guys.
[02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:40.930]  Yeah, man.
[02:43:40.930 --> 02:43:42.170]  Have a good one.
[02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:43.010]  Get in touch.
[02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:45.290]  Thanks.
[02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:48.610]  All right.
[02:43:48.610 --> 02:43:50.290]  Where are we at?
[02:43:50.290 --> 02:43:53.130]  We got one minute, 50 seconds left.
[02:43:53.130 --> 02:43:54.930]  Toad, we had $200.
[02:43:56.210 --> 02:43:58.130]  We got this beautiful work of art.
[02:43:58.790 --> 02:44:00.150]  We have four prints.
[02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:02.790]  Mr. Toad, this is on silk.
[02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:04.630]  This is a beautiful way.
[02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:06.430]  Wow, look at all that work in there.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:14.060]  This'll go beautifully matching with any of the guys
[02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:17.460]  who snagged all the small canvas prints,
[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:19.220]  as well as four packs.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:21.340]  I'm picturing here.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:24.300]  The Bob's cheddar is across
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:26.740]  a Bruce Banner three to my space cheese.
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:31.540]  Does this come with the gooey space cheese, Ty?
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:34.200]  This one here?
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:36.600]  No, the other ones came with it, not this one.
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:39.240]  Oh, I was feeling like if you smoked the gooey space cheese
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:41.040]  and looked at the rainbow waves,
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:45.080]  you would have a really good interaction.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:46.280]  We can throw them in there, too.
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:47.120]  It don't matter.
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:48.160]  No, no, no pressure.
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:50.840]  I got so many of those, we can do it.
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:53.040]  Just thinking about the peach and the melon and the kiwi.
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:54.600]  I was like, this looks like it.
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:59.380]  You can get that out of the NorCal space goo
[02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:00.780]  and my vintage cheddar.
[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:03.700]  The Kim 91, the space cheese has like watermelon
[02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:05.300]  and peaches that come out of it.
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:09.820]  With Kim backed on it, it's crazy.
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:11.940]  You got that mothball up in there?
[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:13.180]  Can I find the mothball?
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:18.140]  That's probably gonna show up more
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:21.580]  in maybe the dog walker cross
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:24.060]  or either the Kim four cross.
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:28.140]  Then the Kim 91.
[02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:29.940]  Okay, okay, cool.
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:31.420]  Yeah, I never fucked with Kim four.
[02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:34.180]  That's kind of the, that's the mystery child to me still.
[02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:37.020]  I'm still, I gotta get to know it.
[02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:38.160]  She's nine.
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:40.860]  I did a cross with the four, the D and the 91
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:42.820]  all with that space cheese male.
[02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:44.460]  Oh, what the fuck?
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.300]  Who won?
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:46.120]  Did the D win?
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:48.580]  I feel like the D is just so honored.
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:50.780]  I think the four is the best one out of all of them,
[02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:52.780]  the Kim four, the space cheese.
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.640]  It retains more of the Kim funk
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:59.400]  and a more majority of the seeds than the other ones.
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:00.240]  Okay.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:05.840]  Or a Kim with a, like a fruit that's on top of the Kim
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:08.560]  from the 91 and the D they'll pop out of theirs.
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:11.160]  All right, congratulations.
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.800]  You got that for 220, my man.
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:18.000]  That's a fucking steal.
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:20.300]  That is a fucking steal.
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:24.420]  That's a fabulous steal.
[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:27.780]  Appreciate everybody that's coming out.
[02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:32.540]  All right, so I've got some stuff
[02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:35.200]  from Kate Nedick's ungrown.
[02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:37.900]  Dude, hell yeah.
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:39.740]  Kate Nedick is what's up.
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:43.860]  She is doing some really serious work out in Maine.
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:45.860]  He could not make it on,
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:48.560]  but he gave me some stuff to put up.
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:50.420]  So we're gonna put it up.
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.820]  He's also working with a lot of Jean's work.
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:00.400]  So I'm just looking at this trying to see
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:01.240]  how I'm gonna split it up.
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:02.280]  Cause he was very generous.
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:05.840]  He putting up 400 seeds, each different hundred packs.
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:08.060]  So maybe we're gonna split this.
[02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:09.200]  So we're gonna do,
[02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:14.700]  we're gonna do a 50 pack of the Cherry West BX F2.
[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:23.340]  So he took Jean's Cherry West BX
[02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:26.980]  and he made a selection and then F2'd that.
[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:31.940]  And then platinum skittles by that Cherry West.
[02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:34.480]  So 50 seeds of each.
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.980]  Terpene Tasting Team, write that down
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  cause we're gonna have to tell them
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.040]  how we're splitting this up.
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:45.480]  And yeah, we're gonna start the bidding at $50
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:51.000]  for a hundred seeds, which is silly.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.480]  And I'm gonna put two minutes on the clock.
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:56.660]  So that's from Kate Nedick's ungrown.
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:03.720]  So Kate Nedick lives super coastal
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:06.120]  and has crazy humidity pressure.
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:09.660]  So he breeds really intently for early finishing
[02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:11.660]  and a high mildew resistance.
[02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:14.420]  He has way heavier fogs than I do.
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:16.860]  So, and then the, you know,
[02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:19.080]  what I know about the Cherry West line
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:20.940]  is basically that there, you know,
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:23.560]  there was a Cherry Pie clone that me and Jean liked
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.460]  and it was rosier and more floral,
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:29.840]  I believe than the traditional Cherry Pie
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.220]  and sweet as fuck of course.
[02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:33.380]  And moved that, you know,
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:36.200]  it has been back crossing towards that original
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  rose water, more floral sweet selection.
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:42.720]  So this would be that,
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:44.640]  then selected for early finishing,
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:45.860]  high mildew resistance,
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:49.360]  and then the favorable selection hit to the F2
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:53.000]  of the same type and then out crossed to,
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:53.820]  what was it?
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:55.160]  A Platinum Skittles?
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:56.000]  Yep.
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:00.000]  So I don't know too much about Platinum Skittles,
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  but if fucking Kate Nedick grows it,
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:05.260]  then it does good with mold, mildew,
[02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:06.260]  and it finishes early.
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:08.720]  I mean, that's kind of like,
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:10.180]  that's what that dude does.
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:11.020]  So it's just-
[02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:13.860]  The Cherry West line is really, really fast.
[02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:15.500]  It's a really special plant.
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:16.340]  What do they want?
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:18.340]  For the seeds directly to Harry?
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:19.460]  Is that what you guys are talking about
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:20.980]  with the comment on the bottom?
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:27.740]  Me and Jean, can anyone put up seeds to donate for Harry?
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:29.620]  He's just saying like, can anyone put them up?
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:31.460]  Yes, anyone can put them up.
[02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:32.580]  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:35.080]  130 right now, Wayne Mustapha.
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:37.640]  That's a hundred seeds for 130.
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:40.640]  That's $1.30 a seed.
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:42.000]  That's banging.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.200]  You get a hundred regular seeds.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.760]  We got 28 seconds left.
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:49.720]  Jameson, do you want to tell that fella
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.280]  how he can put up seeds to donate?
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:53.320]  Yes.
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:58.320]  If you message Terpene Tasting Team on Instagram,
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:00.680]  he can send you a link
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:03.260]  and we can bring you up here live
[02:50:03.260 --> 02:50:07.140]  and get you putting up seeds.
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:08.980]  So we're almost done.
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:11.400]  Agnes back in for 150 bucks.
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:14.120]  Coming in last minute.
[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:18.460]  We'll give a second for the lag
[02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:23.300]  to see if there's any counters.
[02:50:26.410 --> 02:50:28.450]  I would like a story on this platinum Skittles.
[02:50:28.450 --> 02:50:30.890]  Like is it platinum Girl Scout cookies to Skittles?
[02:50:30.890 --> 02:50:32.170]  How did it get platinum?
[02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:33.790]  I must know.
[02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:34.610]  Sounds so good.
[02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:37.030]  I don't know right now.
[02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:41.270]  So 150, Agnes Beckett, that's you.
[02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:43.530]  Hundred seeds heading your way.
[02:50:43.530 --> 02:50:48.530]  That is the Cherry West back cross F2
[02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:51.990]  as well as the platinum Skittles by the Cherry West.
[02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:56.990]  And we're gonna go to Good People Gardens.
[02:50:57.750 --> 02:51:01.070]  Do you have another pack or are you just feeling?
[02:51:01.090 --> 02:51:02.410]  Anyone's more than welcome to chill.
[02:51:02.410 --> 02:51:04.810]  I just wanna make sure everybody gets.
[02:51:04.810 --> 02:51:05.650]  I'm chilling.
[02:51:05.650 --> 02:51:06.930]  No, I was gonna say those Cherry West.
[02:51:06.930 --> 02:51:08.470]  I've grown a whole hell of a lot of them.
[02:51:08.470 --> 02:51:12.530]  Some of them will finish late August.
[02:51:12.530 --> 02:51:15.470]  Some you can push them into September.
[02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:16.930]  They are extremely resilient.
[02:51:16.930 --> 02:51:19.370]  The flavor on those things is incredible.
[02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:20.930]  Is that late August?
[02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:23.290]  Is that late August finish?
[02:51:23.290 --> 02:51:26.650]  Is that like an auto flower treat or is it just?
[02:51:26.650 --> 02:51:27.570]  It almost is.
[02:51:27.570 --> 02:51:29.370]  Like it almost auto triggers some of them
[02:51:29.370 --> 02:51:30.450]  when you put them in.
[02:51:31.350 --> 02:51:32.830]  You wanna get them to go long,
[02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:35.030]  I would recommend direct sow in them almost.
[02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:36.790]  Or like just not let them get root bound
[02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:38.030]  in any way, shape or form.
[02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:41.670]  Yeah, root restriction auto flower treat.
[02:51:43.070 --> 02:51:44.710]  That's fucking cool as fuck.
[02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:45.550]  I just do them out.
[02:51:45.550 --> 02:51:47.430]  You can keep them in veg though as a mom though.
[02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:48.270]  That's for sure.
[02:51:48.270 --> 02:51:49.430]  But like as soon as you.
[02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:53.790]  They will mom over the winter.
[02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:54.630]  Oh, hell yeah.
[02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:55.470]  Yep.
[02:51:55.470 --> 02:51:56.290]  Okay, cool.
[02:51:56.290 --> 02:51:57.130]  Cool, tight.
[02:51:57.130 --> 02:51:57.990]  I've grown them three seasons.
[02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:59.990]  I grew them on Cape Cod in the wettest of weather.
[02:52:00.330 --> 02:52:01.410]  They're awesome.
[02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:02.290]  Oh, nice.
[02:52:02.290 --> 02:52:03.890]  Yeah, fuck.
[02:52:03.890 --> 02:52:05.730]  Yeah, Cape Cod supposed to be gnarly.
[02:52:06.690 --> 02:52:08.730]  My homie is down in Martha's Vineyard, Theo.
[02:52:08.730 --> 02:52:11.450]  And he's like, dude, it's like a fog machine down here.
[02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:14.070]  So I definitely, sometimes I'm happy
[02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:15.810]  to be inland a little bit, I guess.
[02:52:19.130 --> 02:52:21.690]  I can do these if you want, J-Mo.
[02:52:21.690 --> 02:52:23.010]  I know you're busy.
[02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:23.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:52:23.850 --> 02:52:24.690]  Go for it.
[02:52:25.570 --> 02:52:29.490]  So these are from my homie, Matty, Solo Seed Co.
[02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.810]  He's here in Maine.
[02:52:30.810 --> 02:52:31.650]  He's an OG.
[02:52:31.650 --> 02:52:33.870]  You know, he's been fucking growing good weed
[02:52:33.870 --> 02:52:36.530]  since I was fucking learning how to use a pencil.
[02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:42.230]  So yeah, these are, when I first met him,
[02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:44.590]  I was like, dude, you know all your shit's out of order,
[02:52:44.590 --> 02:52:45.430]  right?
[02:52:45.430 --> 02:52:49.670]  He puts his female second and his males first.
[02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:50.510]  And I was like, what's going on?
[02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:51.510]  He's like, I just like it that way.
[02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:53.670]  I was like, all right, as long as you know it's off.
[02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:56.230]  And he definitely knows it's off, but does it anyway.
[02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:58.030]  So I gotta unread it.
[02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:02.850]  So basically it's, he has this Skittles Blissful Wizard
[02:53:02.850 --> 02:53:07.350]  male that he uses that seems to pass Cookie's Frost
[02:53:07.350 --> 02:53:09.410]  and Skittles flavor very well.
[02:53:09.410 --> 02:53:10.970]  And this has hit to GMO.
[02:53:10.970 --> 02:53:13.930]  When I first met him, he had a jar of this weed.
[02:53:13.930 --> 02:53:15.710]  It's called Modified Magic.
[02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:16.610]  That's the name.
[02:53:16.610 --> 02:53:18.770]  So when I first met him, he had a jar of this weed
[02:53:18.770 --> 02:53:22.210]  and it was the first time I'd really smelled GMO
[02:53:22.210 --> 02:53:25.690]  perfectly 50-50 split with something pleasant.
[02:53:25.690 --> 02:53:29.170]  So like an acrid to a fruit, like perfectly split.
[02:53:29.170 --> 02:53:31.630]  So it's this really perfect Skittles candy
[02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:35.850]  with the super nasty onion, you know, halitosis funk.
[02:53:35.850 --> 02:53:39.710]  So it also dumps resin apparently,
[02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:43.430]  and it seems to be a little on the longer side,
[02:53:43.430 --> 02:53:44.550]  nine, 10 weeks, you know,
[02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:46.750]  like you would expect from a GMO hybrid.
[02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:50.270]  So that's maybe the one drawback, but bag of peel's insane.
[02:53:50.270 --> 02:53:51.310]  Flavor's insane.
[02:53:51.310 --> 02:53:52.970]  Resin's really nice.
[02:53:52.970 --> 02:53:55.390]  So if you can, you know, if you're used to growing
[02:53:55.890 --> 02:53:58.690]  nine, 10 weekers, then this is a great,
[02:53:58.690 --> 02:54:00.650]  this is a great modern, you know,
[02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:03.170]  kind of modern remix that's, you know,
[02:54:03.170 --> 02:54:04.390]  gonna be a classic, right?
[02:54:04.390 --> 02:54:07.450]  I mean, Skittles and GMO have basically
[02:54:07.450 --> 02:54:10.610]  completely strong armed their way into, you know,
[02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:12.890]  the best 10 strains of the past five years.
[02:54:12.890 --> 02:54:14.090]  And I don't think there's anything
[02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:15.570]  any of us can do about it, right?
[02:54:15.570 --> 02:54:18.610]  So this is great if you need something like that
[02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:19.450]  in your menu.
[02:54:20.530 --> 02:54:22.650]  I'm putting the time on the clock here,
[02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:24.050]  two minutes on the clock.
[02:54:25.050 --> 02:54:28.830]  So low seed co is the name, like so low,
[02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:33.150]  so the seed's low, so low seed co, so low farms.
[02:54:33.150 --> 02:54:34.990]  Mattie's good people, check him out.
[02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:38.190]  He actually supplied the grapefruit
[02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:41.310]  for a lot of Professor P's sweeter grapefruit projects.
[02:54:41.310 --> 02:54:44.070]  The more acrid grapefruit in Professor P's work
[02:54:44.070 --> 02:54:49.070]  is like a, I believe like a more New York connection,
[02:54:49.270 --> 02:54:51.590]  but the sweeter, so the grapefruit IVL
[02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:53.670]  is different than the grapefruit F2 work,
[02:54:54.290 --> 02:54:56.930]  the F2 work is all for Mattie, so now you know.
[02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:03.710]  All right.
[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:11.000]  Two minutes, one minute.
[02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:16.220]  Where's the bid at, 50 bucks.
[02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:17.060]  There it is.
[02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:21.320]  Oh man, I should just keep them.
[02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:27.460]  People are resonating.
[02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:30.740]  Dude, there's been a lot of like outside the park,
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:34.940]  just like more exotic, just crazy stuff going on.
[02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:37.220]  This is pretty like right down the middle,
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:39.540]  but if you wanna try to learn how to make hash,
[02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:42.600]  this is a really nice like sure bet.
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.180]  You can just fucking grow them
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:47.320]  and practice making some hash, so it's good for that.
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:50.560]  But I mean, it is, I have enough GMO in my library,
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.260]  I don't really need more, so I get it, you know, no words.
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:59.260]  We got Rodden at 75, appreciate you Rodden.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:03.680]  Thanks Rodden.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:08.020]  20 seconds left.
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:18.300]  Going, going, gone, Rodden with the GMO steel.
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:25.140]  I'm gonna put up some stuff from the Viking
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:26.620]  who couldn't make it tonight.
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:32.740]  So T Beasle is very apologetic
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:36.200]  that he cannot make it, tear in spirit, I guarantee it.
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:40.340]  And so we're gonna put up some rare packs.
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:42.280]  I don't know, some of these are rare.
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:44.980]  I know some are rare and some might be available,
[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:48.120]  but we're gonna put up two packs
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:49.600]  from Little Lake Valley to start off.
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:51.580]  We're gonna put up the Tesseract,
[02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:54.280]  which is the Lemon Alien Dog,
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:56.480]  which is Lemon Kush by Alien Dog,
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:00.000]  for his shallow sashimi.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.160]  And then we're gonna put up the Little Lake Valley Perp,
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:08.160]  which is the Granddaddy Purple to the Purple Urkel F5,
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:11.320]  that then crossed to his shallow sashimi.
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:16.320]  So these are two, these two packs,
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.640]  the two packs on the bottom,
[02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:25.560]  and those are gonna, we'll start the bidding at $100.
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:29.780]  And these two packs are fire.
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:31.380]  If you know T Beasle's work
[02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:33.140]  and you know Little Lake Valley,
[02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:38.140]  you know it's, there you go, Brian, $100, two packs.
[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:42.940]  The Little Lake Valley Perp and Tesseract.
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:46.520]  I don't know if these are available on the site.
[02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:56.070]  Oh, that was a bid on, oh.
[02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:58.830]  That was for the last thing.
[02:57:58.830 --> 02:58:03.350]  I think Rotten is saying that Brian can have him
[02:58:03.350 --> 02:58:05.030]  for the extra 25.
[02:58:05.910 --> 02:58:08.350]  Okay, so that's for the last one.
[02:58:08.350 --> 02:58:13.350]  So Brian, I'll post the Venmo PayPal Cash app again.
[02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:14.510]  They're yours.
[02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:17.430]  And congratulations, Brian.
[02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:21.150]  So we've got the Tesseract
[02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:26.150]  and the Little Lake Valley Purple
[02:58:26.390 --> 02:58:31.190]  from Little Lake Valley.
[02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:32.190]  What's the male?
[02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:35.150]  Are they all expiration date or what's the deal?
[02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:37.350]  They're both shallow sashimi.
[02:58:37.350 --> 02:58:38.590]  Okay, cool.
[02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:43.590]  So that's the GMO hit to the heirloom OG
[02:58:46.230 --> 02:58:47.610]  with the sunset sherb.
[02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:52.430]  It's gonna be nice.
[02:58:52.430 --> 02:58:54.950]  I mean, it's gonna make huge plants.
[02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:58.710]  Yeah, what T-Beazle has been doing
[02:58:58.710 --> 02:59:03.110]  is forward breeding polyhybrid F1 types
[02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:06.750]  to just move dominant traits forward.
[02:59:06.750 --> 02:59:08.530]  So what you're basically doing every round
[02:59:08.530 --> 02:59:11.010]  is you're grabbing as many dominant traits as you can
[02:59:11.010 --> 02:59:13.750]  and pushing them forward to the next round
[02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:18.750]  and then hammering those onto unsuspecting phenotypes
[02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:23.750]  and trying to blast through some of those characteristics
[02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:28.190]  that help to make plants washable.
[02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:32.870]  So the goal is to trap some of those really nice flavors
[02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:35.310]  inside of trichomes that are extractable.
[02:59:35.310 --> 02:59:38.710]  So that's really the concept, the direction,
[02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:41.950]  the principle behind all of his breeding practices.
[02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:46.590]  And in my own work,
[02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:49.230]  obviously not trying to speak for anybody.
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:55.960]  We've been getting multiple people
[02:59:55.960 --> 03:00:00.320]  having really good feedback about his work.
[03:00:00.320 --> 03:00:02.840]  So, you know, really.
[03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:06.760]  I got a great story.
[03:00:06.760 --> 03:00:08.800]  So I was just popping some seeds, right?
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:12.560]  I popped a bunch of banana ties from Riot.
[03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:15.800]  I popped a bunch of, what did I have?
[03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:20.800]  I had a bunch of cheese, what did Callie Snapple cheeses.
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:26.360]  I got a bunch of, what was the other thing I popped?
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:33.280]  Oh, the chocolate space trip, right?
[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:36.880]  So it's a bunch of chocolate rain males, you know,
[03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:39.200]  that were remaking the mocha lope
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:42.000]  hit onto the black of blue magoo.
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:45.440]  And the fourth thing I was popping was this lime.
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:49.880]  T Beazle has this, the lime, chemical lime,
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:54.680]  phenotype from the cherry limeade F2
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:57.640]  hit with the expiration date male.
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:00:59.360]  So I wanted some mean gene stuff,
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.000]  but I want some shit that washes, right?
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.840]  So I was kind of going down this road
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.960]  and I pop everything in bowls in maintenance solution.
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:08.360]  Right, so I got some bowls, you know, just like this.
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:10.920]  And, you know, I've gotten full of maintenance solution
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:13.320]  and I'm soaking my seeds in there and I'm doing,
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:14.640]  it's the last one, right?
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:17.960]  So I'm doing it and I walk into the grow
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:20.040]  and I'm about to take the first seed
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:21.600]  and put it in the first hole
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:24.400]  because I direct so after they germinate.
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:27.080]  And I just dropped the whole fucking bowl on concrete
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:30.000]  and all the seeds are just on,
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:31.520]  already germinated their tails,
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:32.920]  there's all over concrete,
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:34.240]  which is not the cleanest concrete
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:35.600]  because it's in my grow and I'm, you know,
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:36.760]  dirty fucking hippie.
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:39.160]  So I'm just like, what the fuck?
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:42.440]  So I put all these seeds in their holes
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:45.040]  and literally I think I still had almost 90%
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:48.040]  fucking germination rate after smashing a bowl
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:50.040]  of germinated seeds on the ground.
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:52.640]  So that's the second time I pop seeds for him
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:55.080]  and they're always the most vigorous
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:58.800]  or on par with the most vigorous seeds that I pop.
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:00.520]  So I can at least speak to that
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:02.080]  and I'm looking forward to seeing what else
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:03.920]  the seeds have to show me.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:06.800]  But yeah, so it's a little story just to let you know
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:07.960]  what kind of toughness you're getting
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:09.520]  for free with these seeds.
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:13.280]  Yo, shout out and shout out to T-Bone.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.280]  You got those two packs for 150.
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:25.520]  So next on the block, we're gonna have,
[03:02:27.740 --> 03:02:29.980]  is anybody here wanna put up any packs?
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:32.680]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:34.560]  All right, let's go, let's go.
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.560]  All right, let's do a few short flowering ones.
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:47.840]  Speaking of the Cherry West, when those first came out,
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:51.260]  I made a few more and there was a incidental pollination
[03:02:51.260 --> 03:02:54.120]  with some of the gals that were in the room.
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:57.000]  And they, over the last couple of years,
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.160]  they turned out to be some of the best outdoor plants
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:01.000]  that we've had.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  So here's a pack of, what are we, Old Sogs,
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:10.720]  Super Silver Haze by Cherry West.
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:14.280]  Cherry West is, as discussed earlier, finish really fast,
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:17.580]  really mold resistant, pest resistant.
[03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:20.240]  They do just fantastic outdoors
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:22.240]  and all kinds of crazy fruit flavors
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:25.920]  from cherry to pomegranate to quince
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:28.020]  and all kinds of neat shit.
[03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:29.980]  So we'll do a pack of those.
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:36.640]  A pack of 87 bottles, which is 87 Lime Pop
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:40.440]  by the Coca-Cola Root Beer BC2,
[03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:46.620]  as well as, now that they're public,
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:51.120]  I'll let go of a 10 pack out of my stash
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.000]  of Coca-Cola Root Beer BC2F2.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  So it's basically the same kind of generation
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.040]  or whatever that Gene just released,
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:03.000]  his Root Beer Freeze.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:07.600]  So the Root Beer Freeze is BC2F2,
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:09.840]  that he did a big ass selection outdoors.
[03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:13.820]  So there's a good 40 seeds.
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:16.320]  Take it away.
[03:04:19.230 --> 03:04:23.350]  So that Super Silver Haze Cherry West,
[03:04:23.350 --> 03:04:25.950]  did you get a chance to grow any of those out?
[03:04:25.950 --> 03:04:29.730]  Like, they just seem like they'd be the craziest variation
[03:04:29.810 --> 03:04:30.810]  in the Gene pool.
[03:04:32.290 --> 03:04:35.870]  Yeah, big, big plants.
[03:04:36.890 --> 03:04:41.890]  The Old Sog is a little limp.
[03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:44.550]  It needs crutches early on in flower.
[03:04:46.370 --> 03:04:50.170]  So the Cherry West gave it some backbone,
[03:04:50.170 --> 03:04:51.290]  sped it up a little bit.
[03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:54.370]  And yeah, there's all kinds of really cool metallic,
[03:04:55.210 --> 03:05:00.210]  like metallic stringent fruit flavors in there.
[03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:02.490]  Man, that sounds fire.
[03:05:02.490 --> 03:05:06.850]  Are you getting the Spear Cola from the Super Silver Haze
[03:05:06.850 --> 03:05:10.930]  with like the bud structure of,
[03:05:10.930 --> 03:05:12.210]  like, did you see anything like that
[03:05:12.210 --> 03:05:13.610]  where you're actually getting the,
[03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:15.850]  you know, not the cookies, you know,
[03:05:15.850 --> 03:05:18.570]  but the cherry pie look on some of the nugs size
[03:05:18.570 --> 03:05:20.370]  from the Super Silver?
[03:05:20.370 --> 03:05:23.250]  Yeah, there's definitely like more filled out
[03:05:23.250 --> 03:05:27.290]  Spear type Colas, a good mix in the flower structure.
[03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:30.450]  So the, you know, the Cherry West was kind of chunky
[03:05:31.930 --> 03:05:34.930]  and wasn't like the biggest yielder in the garden.
[03:05:34.930 --> 03:05:36.690]  But between the two of them though,
[03:05:36.690 --> 03:05:38.970]  you'll see some big Spear shaped Colas
[03:05:38.970 --> 03:05:40.770]  with medium density.
[03:05:40.770 --> 03:05:41.710]  They'll throw down.
[03:05:42.610 --> 03:05:46.210]  I did, it was both this Old Sog's cut,
[03:05:46.210 --> 03:05:51.210]  and then I have an NL5F3 selection out of Bodhi's release
[03:05:52.210 --> 03:05:56.850]  that in veg, you probably couldn't tell the difference
[03:05:56.850 --> 03:05:58.650]  between that and Old Sog's cut.
[03:06:00.330 --> 03:06:02.290]  And is that Old Sog's in your,
[03:06:02.290 --> 03:06:03.870]  like for you and your experience,
[03:06:03.870 --> 03:06:07.290]  is that one of the things that breeds metallic like best
[03:06:07.290 --> 03:06:08.490]  out of what you've seen?
[03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:11.570]  Cause that, I mean, I don't see a lot of metallic turps.
[03:06:11.570 --> 03:06:14.210]  I mean, granted I don't run long flowering sativas much,
[03:06:14.210 --> 03:06:17.630]  but that's still, it's still something I don't hear about.
[03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:19.430]  I don't hear about people actually smoking it.
[03:06:19.430 --> 03:06:21.430]  I hear about people remembering about it,
[03:06:21.430 --> 03:06:22.710]  but I don't see that many penny.
[03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:23.790]  I don't see that much nickel.
[03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:26.230]  I don't see that much battery, you know,
[03:06:26.230 --> 03:06:28.710]  like that kind of stuff just isn't that common anymore.
[03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:30.190]  At least it isn't for me.
[03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:31.030]  Right, right.
[03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:33.870]  I've only hit the Old Sog with,
[03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:36.150]  I think two different males now.
[03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:39.270]  And now I'm trying to think of who else it was.
[03:06:39.270 --> 03:06:42.910]  And I know it wasn't a big run or anything
[03:06:42.910 --> 03:06:45.010]  and it was nothing that was ever released.
[03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:48.450]  But the Old Sog, and there's a couple others,
[03:06:48.450 --> 03:06:52.610]  if I had my brain about me, I could spit it out.
[03:06:54.850 --> 03:06:55.690]  Who the hell was it?
[03:06:55.690 --> 03:06:57.610]  I get that really, like, you know,
[03:06:57.610 --> 03:07:01.290]  it's like sticking your tongue on a battery type of,
[03:07:01.290 --> 03:07:06.210]  you know, it's got that fizzy, you know, fizzy metal,
[03:07:06.210 --> 03:07:09.130]  you know, like a piece of silver in your mouth.
[03:07:09.130 --> 03:07:10.210]  Hell yeah.
[03:07:10.210 --> 03:07:11.250]  You know.
[03:07:11.250 --> 03:07:12.570]  Yeah, pop rocks and pennies.
[03:07:12.570 --> 03:07:13.850]  That sounds fucking awesome.
[03:07:13.850 --> 03:07:15.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:15.690 --> 03:07:19.250]  Yeah, and that's one of the, you know,
[03:07:19.250 --> 03:07:20.650]  that's like the root beer there
[03:07:20.650 --> 03:07:21.850]  that we were talking about earlier.
[03:07:21.850 --> 03:07:26.850]  There's that really fizzy, almost citric acid type
[03:07:28.170 --> 03:07:31.650]  that come out of the green selections
[03:07:31.650 --> 03:07:36.650]  that lean more towards, I think it's the sour diesel side.
[03:07:36.930 --> 03:07:39.090]  And then there was some others
[03:07:39.090 --> 03:07:41.610]  that are just really acrid, sickly sweet
[03:07:42.210 --> 03:07:47.210]  that came out of the more black Afghani.
[03:07:47.290 --> 03:07:51.570]  Like I have one of the root beer BC2s
[03:07:51.570 --> 03:07:54.150]  that I got last year through auction.
[03:07:56.170 --> 03:08:00.290]  And Gene said it looks, it's the most,
[03:08:00.290 --> 03:08:02.010]  the heaviest black Afghan leaner
[03:08:02.010 --> 03:08:03.330]  that he's seen come out of the line.
[03:08:03.330 --> 03:08:06.690]  And it turns just about black and it's shorter.
[03:08:06.690 --> 03:08:08.690]  It's really sickly sweet.
[03:08:08.690 --> 03:08:13.690]  So the BC2F2 packs that are up for grabs,
[03:08:14.970 --> 03:08:16.370]  there's gonna be a couple of beans
[03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:19.690]  out of three different females there.
[03:08:19.690 --> 03:08:22.770]  So the black Afghani girl,
[03:08:22.770 --> 03:08:26.010]  there's a really fizzy, like sour leaning girl,
[03:08:26.010 --> 03:08:28.290]  and then one that was kind of in between.
[03:08:28.290 --> 03:08:30.370]  So thank you so much, Jimmy.
[03:08:30.370 --> 03:08:32.410]  We gotta keep going, but congratulations.
[03:08:32.410 --> 03:08:34.850]  Dave's not there on that one.
[03:08:35.850 --> 03:08:40.850]  Next up, we're gonna throw up Kaya's second pack for Harry.
[03:08:42.770 --> 03:08:47.770]  And that is his strawberry yogurt to his Royal sour coffee.
[03:08:47.890 --> 03:08:52.210]  So we're gonna put three minutes on the clock.
[03:08:52.210 --> 03:08:57.130]  We're gonna keep rolling and we're gonna put up that.
[03:08:58.250 --> 03:09:00.250]  And I've had a chance to try the yogurt.
[03:09:00.250 --> 03:09:02.690]  I haven't tried this specific cross,
[03:09:02.690 --> 03:09:04.770]  but I know that yogurt is incredible
[03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:06.530]  and hashrosen.
[03:09:08.290 --> 03:09:13.290]  So the, yeah, we're gonna start that bid.
[03:09:15.850 --> 03:09:17.770]  We're gonna put three minutes on the clock
[03:09:17.770 --> 03:09:20.330]  and that's Pacific Northwest roots,
[03:09:22.530 --> 03:09:27.530]  strawberry yogurt by the Royal sour coffee.
[03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:34.530]  That Royal sour coffee smells like all the chemicals
[03:09:35.290 --> 03:09:36.130]  that you put under your kitchen sink
[03:09:36.130 --> 03:09:38.410]  or like bathroom cleaner chemicals,
[03:09:38.410 --> 03:09:43.410]  urinal cakes, like she's nasty.
[03:09:43.410 --> 03:09:44.890]  That's awesome.
[03:09:44.890 --> 03:09:46.490]  Starting it out at a hundred dollars.
[03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:48.050]  Appreciate you, bro.
[03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:50.250]  These packs go a lot more than that.
[03:09:50.250 --> 03:09:51.130]  Let's see more.
[03:09:51.130 --> 03:09:52.970]  This is for Jerry.
[03:09:52.970 --> 03:09:54.530]  Does the Royal do the Royal thing
[03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:58.290]  where it brings all the finish times like in?
[03:09:58.290 --> 03:09:59.890]  Do we know?
[03:09:59.890 --> 03:10:03.370]  No, I've run the Royal sour coffee
[03:10:03.410 --> 03:10:05.050]  and it's a longer,
[03:10:06.010 --> 03:10:09.650]  I actually have it going right now in mass
[03:10:09.650 --> 03:10:12.410]  and that thing's probably got still another week left,
[03:10:12.410 --> 03:10:13.290]  maybe 10 days.
[03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:18.260]  We got a hundred dollars,
[03:10:18.260 --> 03:10:21.820]  Wayne Mustafa strawberry yogurt by Royal sour coffee
[03:10:21.820 --> 03:10:23.740]  from Pacific Northwest roots.
[03:10:25.100 --> 03:10:28.660]  For Harry Rose, this thing's gonna work outside.
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:31.340]  We're at in a wet, wet part of the world,
[03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:35.300]  the coastal area of Washington.
[03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:39.340]  It is not a friendly place to grow cannabis.
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:40.340]  That's for sure.
[03:10:42.500 --> 03:10:47.500]  So, if you can survive there, you can go anywhere.
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:52.580]  So 120 martial artist, appreciate you, dog.
[03:10:52.580 --> 03:10:54.500]  We got 120 for this pack.
[03:10:55.780 --> 03:10:57.540]  I know Harry appreciates it.
[03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:02.180]  Plenty of deals coming, but this is the coffee,
[03:11:02.180 --> 03:11:05.740]  or sorry, the strawberry yogurt by the Royal sour coffee.
[03:11:05.740 --> 03:11:08.780]  We got one minute left on the clock.
[03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:13.780]  Martial artists in the lead with 120.
[03:11:15.420 --> 03:11:16.740]  More packs to come.
[03:11:19.140 --> 03:11:21.100]  Hope everybody's having a great night.
[03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:25.820]  Yeah, so strawberry, like you can get,
[03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:28.780]  you can get like strawberry starburst turps.
[03:11:28.780 --> 03:11:30.020]  I found a really nice,
[03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:34.100]  I went through like 36 seeds of the straw guava S1s
[03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:36.100]  and found a really nice like strawberry
[03:11:36.100 --> 03:11:38.020]  high chew isolated turp.
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:40.700]  There's no side secondary turps,
[03:11:40.700 --> 03:11:43.700]  but strawberry stuff, depending on the type of strawberry,
[03:11:43.700 --> 03:11:45.540]  isn't really all that common and solventless.
[03:11:45.540 --> 03:11:48.220]  So it is nice to have like, you know,
[03:11:48.220 --> 03:11:51.620]  actual strawberries or things like that.
[03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:53.860]  And I know that Kaia has been ripping this,
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:57.020]  this strawberry fro-yo for a minute
[03:11:57.020 --> 03:11:59.020]  and he doesn't keep things around for hash
[03:11:59.020 --> 03:11:59.860]  that aren't good hash.
[03:11:59.860 --> 03:12:03.060]  So if I was a hash maker, which I am,
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:04.980]  I'd be greatly considering it.
[03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:07.500]  And if I didn't just get some stuff from him,
[03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:10.220]  I wouldn't be, I'd probably be trying to get this.
[03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:11.300]  So.
[03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:13.980]  125, Wayne Mustafa.
[03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:18.820]  We're gonna give it a second in case there,
[03:12:18.820 --> 03:12:21.780]  Martial artist wants to come back for,
[03:12:22.780 --> 03:12:24.340]  hey, how are ya?
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:27.580]  But that's a good deal for anybody.
[03:12:29.340 --> 03:12:33.340]  So congratulations to Wayne Mustafa.
[03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:37.140]  Another good, oh, Martial artist came back.
[03:12:37.140 --> 03:12:38.860]  That's fair, 140.
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:42.060]  That's a big jump too, I appreciate that.
[03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:43.540]  Get it Martial.
[03:12:43.540 --> 03:12:44.740]  There you go.
[03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:47.860]  That's still a great price for that pack, so.
[03:12:47.860 --> 03:12:50.500]  Leaving no room for doubt, yeah, nice work.
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:51.320]  Yeah.
[03:12:52.780 --> 03:12:54.740]  Give it a minute, give it a second,
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:56.500]  but that goes to Martial.
[03:12:56.500 --> 03:12:58.700]  Unless Wayne, you wanna jump back?
[03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:00.900]  It's a fundraiser, so it's for a good cause.
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:03.700]  We're gonna let it go, we're gonna let it go over time.
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:07.740]  Awesome, all right.
[03:13:10.860 --> 03:13:13.020]  It's awesome you guys are kicking it and hanging out.
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:15.940]  I just wanted, does anybody else wanna put up a pack?
[03:13:15.940 --> 03:13:17.700]  I've got some other stuff from some other people
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:19.940]  that I know we wanna get up,
[03:13:19.940 --> 03:13:21.380]  but if anybody wants to put it up.
[03:13:21.980 --> 03:13:23.340]  It's getting late for me over here.
[03:13:23.340 --> 03:13:24.740]  I got one more.
[03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:25.780]  Awesome, let's do it.
[03:13:29.940 --> 03:13:33.860]  Ooh, the Crickets and Cicada, let's go.
[03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:38.500]  Open pollination, freshwater Pakistani.
[03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:40.780]  Very nice, all right, I got three minutes
[03:13:40.780 --> 03:13:42.100]  on the clock on this one.
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:46.980]  Is that like a shiny, soapy, packy?
[03:13:46.980 --> 03:13:49.420]  What do we know about that packy?
[03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:50.780]  I couldn't tell you.
[03:13:50.780 --> 03:13:52.740]  Mystery packy, I love it.
[03:13:53.580 --> 03:13:56.660]  So general info on packies versus Afghanis.
[03:13:56.660 --> 03:14:00.140]  They're both have a lot of acrid phenotypes.
[03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:02.620]  A lot of Afghanis can go sweet and bubble gummy
[03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:05.060]  and stuff like that, but generally with Afghanis,
[03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:07.420]  you're either gonna get sweet or you're gonna get
[03:14:07.420 --> 03:14:11.300]  like tiry, stuff like that.
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:13.380]  The packies start to get more piney.
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:16.780]  So like what we think of more of like an OG Kush type,
[03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:19.260]  a lot of those come more from Pakistani,
[03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:21.740]  whereas like the really frosty Afghanis,
[03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:23.860]  the peppery stuff that's more bland,
[03:14:23.860 --> 03:14:27.140]  and then the bubble gums, and then also like the tiry stuff,
[03:14:27.140 --> 03:14:29.900]  a lot of that is more Afghani versus packy.
[03:14:29.900 --> 03:14:34.900]  So you might be able to find some really greasy pine types
[03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:38.620]  in here, that would probably be what you would be after.
[03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:42.660]  I've heard a lot of people say that they also believe
[03:14:42.660 --> 03:14:47.660]  Urkel and cookies to be like more packy leaning traits,
[03:14:47.820 --> 03:14:52.580]  but I do not have the wisdom to neither confirm nor deny.
[03:14:52.580 --> 03:14:53.420]  So yeah.
[03:14:55.140 --> 03:14:56.340]  There you go.
[03:14:56.340 --> 03:14:58.300]  Yeah, I was gonna use them in like a breeding project,
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:00.740]  but I'll give them up.
[03:15:00.740 --> 03:15:02.300]  Got plenty of seeds.
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:03.460]  Appreciate you bro.
[03:15:03.460 --> 03:15:08.460]  110 Devon Sona for these cricket and cicada.
[03:15:09.620 --> 03:15:12.260]  Crickets and cicada is a seed company run
[03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:13.820]  by Mr. Bob Hemphill.
[03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:19.460]  He is a true OG, and if you know many stories,
[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:24.580]  you know that Bob's been there for more than a few years,
[03:15:24.580 --> 03:15:28.500]  and there's a lot of great work that comes out of that,
[03:15:28.500 --> 03:15:30.180]  that company.
[03:15:30.180 --> 03:15:31.020]  They released the product.
[03:15:31.020 --> 03:15:33.740]  Everything he's been doing, they're just killing it.
[03:15:33.740 --> 03:15:35.580]  Him and Hannah Bull are just killing it
[03:15:35.580 --> 03:15:37.740]  with these seed lines they're doing,
[03:15:37.740 --> 03:15:40.020]  preserving the classics and making it available
[03:15:40.020 --> 03:15:42.380]  to people in seed form, it's just really cool.
[03:15:43.940 --> 03:15:47.820]  Yeah, making sure those classics don't get lost is huge.
[03:15:49.580 --> 03:15:59.620]  Packies have a lot better mold and mildew resistance
[03:16:01.060 --> 03:16:05.820]  than Afghanis, because they are lower in elevation.
[03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:10.100]  So Afghanistan, especially up in the Kush Mountain range
[03:16:10.100 --> 03:16:13.340]  and all that good stuff, that's all like high desert.
[03:16:13.340 --> 03:16:17.180]  So think like Colorado, whereas a lot of Pakistan
[03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:20.980]  is lower in elevation and has a lot more mold
[03:16:20.980 --> 03:16:24.100]  and mildew issues.
[03:16:24.100 --> 03:16:27.220]  So you're gonna get a lot more mold and mildew resistance
[03:16:27.220 --> 03:16:29.060]  with plants from there while still being able
[03:16:29.060 --> 03:16:30.420]  to get some early finishers.
[03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:33.460]  So it's a good spot to start if you wanna play
[03:16:33.460 --> 03:16:35.740]  with some land races that I would think
[03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:37.540]  would be more on the forgiving side.
[03:16:42.180 --> 03:16:45.180]  All right, well, it looks like Devon's gonna do
[03:16:47.180 --> 03:16:48.340]  to take this.
[03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:52.420]  Congratulations to Devon.
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:56.460]  And make sure everybody goes out
[03:16:56.460 --> 03:16:58.020]  and follows Good People Gardens.
[03:16:58.020 --> 03:16:59.660]  Thank you so much for coming out, man.
[03:16:59.660 --> 03:17:03.300]  Like, really appreciate you helping support Henry
[03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:05.420]  and means a ton.
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:06.740]  All right, you guys have a good night, man.
[03:17:06.740 --> 03:17:08.100]  Thank you for having me.
[03:17:08.100 --> 03:17:10.260]  Dude, you too, man, peace, thanks.
[03:17:11.580 --> 03:17:16.580]  All right, so we're gonna go back to Cape Netic.
[03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:18.540]  Sun grown.
[03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:24.500]  And we're going to put up a bit bigger.
[03:17:27.020 --> 03:17:32.020]  This time we're gonna do 50 of 50 seeds
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:41.100]  of the Lime Pop Cush by Sky Jaro OG by Cherry West.
[03:17:41.100 --> 03:17:46.100]  So this is Gene's work to Gene's work
[03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:50.180]  and then back to Gene's work.
[03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:53.660]  So we're gonna do 50 of those.
[03:17:54.620 --> 03:17:59.620]  And then we're gonna do 50 of the Pina by Guava Jelly
[03:18:03.540 --> 03:18:07.380]  CBD Rich by Cherry West.
[03:18:07.380 --> 03:18:10.780]  So these are all regular, 100 seeds.
[03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:18.340]  First one is the Lime Pop Cush by Sky Jaro OG by Cherry West
[03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:21.300]  and that's 100 seeds.
[03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:26.020]  And the second is the Pina by the Guava Jelly CBD Rich
[03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:28.980]  Guava Jelly by Cherry West.
[03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:32.860]  We're gonna start off.
[03:18:32.860 --> 03:18:36.620]  We're gonna put two minutes on the clock.
[03:18:36.660 --> 03:18:40.740]  100 seeds, let's get it started.
[03:18:40.740 --> 03:18:42.740]  Do you even like turps?
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:45.780]  What is good?
[03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:48.420]  Cause there's no way you can say that you like turps
[03:18:48.420 --> 03:18:50.080]  and then not get these seeds.
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:52.660]  I just wouldn't make any sense.
[03:18:52.660 --> 03:18:56.300]  Dude, that's crazy madness.
[03:18:56.300 --> 03:19:00.500]  And this guy puts it, this guy is the real deal.
[03:19:00.500 --> 03:19:04.940]  Just the Pina and the Cherry West,
[03:19:05.220 --> 03:19:08.640]  that's gonna be the craziest, most insane stuff ever.
[03:19:09.540 --> 03:19:12.500]  And then those CBD lines are just gonna bring stuff in
[03:19:12.500 --> 03:19:14.420]  from left field.
[03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:18.060]  You're gonna get into corners and nooks and crannies
[03:19:18.060 --> 03:19:20.220]  of the gene pool that you can't,
[03:19:20.220 --> 03:19:23.460]  I don't think you'd be able to reach in THC only options.
[03:19:23.460 --> 03:19:25.400]  So that's gonna be really cool.
[03:19:26.300 --> 03:19:29.300]  You're gonna pull out some really cool stuff.
[03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:33.060]  The Lime Pop to the Sky Jaro to the Cherry West as well.
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:37.900]  That's just like, there's a reason why Mean Gene
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:42.900]  is held in such high regard by all your favorite breeders,
[03:19:43.260 --> 03:19:46.420]  favorite breeder is what Mean Gene is really.
[03:19:46.420 --> 03:19:50.940]  And all this work is his work.
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:54.880]  So Nedic as a complete, as a absolutely,
[03:19:56.380 --> 03:20:01.080]  very, very accomplished grower in the space,
[03:20:03.060 --> 03:20:05.460]  working in the harsh climate in Maine,
[03:20:05.460 --> 03:20:08.940]  working with all Jackson's varietals,
[03:20:10.940 --> 03:20:12.860]  this is meaningful work.
[03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:18.780]  That first one, so I don't know,
[03:20:18.780 --> 03:20:23.060]  I think of plant types as being shoulder to shoulder.
[03:20:23.060 --> 03:20:25.820]  And I think of Kush being shoulder to shoulder
[03:20:25.820 --> 03:20:28.160]  with Headband, which is shoulder to shoulder with Diesels,
[03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:30.220]  which is shoulder to shoulder with Chemdogs.
[03:20:30.220 --> 03:20:32.300]  And you get in this whole smear
[03:20:32.340 --> 03:20:34.980]  where the Lime Kush is bringing in
[03:20:34.980 --> 03:20:38.020]  the Limey Far Kush OG side.
[03:20:38.020 --> 03:20:39.860]  And then you're kind of getting this,
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:42.900]  then you're going all the way to the Jaro,
[03:20:42.900 --> 03:20:45.920]  which is more of the almost Headband Diesely side.
[03:20:46.820 --> 03:20:50.060]  And then you're, so you're taking this kind of huge gamut
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:53.540]  of Diesel OG Lime, and you're hitting that whole thing
[03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:54.380]  with the Cherry West.
[03:20:54.380 --> 03:20:56.940]  So it just seems like a gassy,
[03:20:57.820 --> 03:21:01.980]  an old school gas heads dream hit with a modern,
[03:21:02.980 --> 03:21:05.780]  Cherry super sexy bud type.
[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:09.740]  So all selected to be grown outside in the Northeast.
[03:21:11.980 --> 03:21:15.620]  Sounds like I'm gonna be calling Cape Medicare pretty soon.
[03:21:15.620 --> 03:21:16.620]  That's what it sounds like.
[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:19.540]  Randy H, you got a deal, man.
[03:21:19.540 --> 03:21:21.540]  100 seeds for $200.
[03:21:22.540 --> 03:21:26.460]  All Jackson's work, all crossed and worked
[03:21:26.460 --> 03:21:28.560]  by Cape Medics Ungrown.
[03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:31.340]  Congratulations.
[03:21:31.340 --> 03:21:36.340]  All right, so we're gonna jump to the second three pack
[03:21:36.860 --> 03:21:39.660]  from T Beasel.
[03:21:39.660 --> 03:21:44.420]  So this is going to be the Baboon,
[03:21:44.420 --> 03:21:46.740]  which is Bananas and Blow.
[03:21:46.740 --> 03:21:51.060]  And Bananas and Blow is Banana OG by Sour Apple
[03:21:51.060 --> 03:21:52.660]  to the Shallot Shashimi.
[03:21:55.260 --> 03:22:00.260]  And then the Royal Jelly, which is Creme Royale.
[03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:06.100]  And Creme Royale is the Acai Gelato to the Purple Gelato.
[03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:11.640]  And that is crossed into the Shallot Shashimi.
[03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:16.640]  And then the last pack of this combo is the B20,
[03:22:17.480 --> 03:22:22.480]  which is Rolling Coal, which is Glow Plug
[03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:26.160]  by Shallot Shashimi.
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:29.000]  So T Beasel's work itself.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:32.800]  Glow Plug is Sour Diesel by Faux Fauna.
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:37.800]  Faux Fauna is the Heirloom OG to the Banana OG to...
[03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:43.120]  Yeah, to the Deadhead OG.
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:48.120]  And then that's all crossed to expiration date.
[03:22:53.280 --> 03:22:58.080]  So you get both of his strong males here,
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:00.320]  or his lines.
[03:23:00.320 --> 03:23:02.660]  You get his Shallot Shashimi line,
[03:23:02.660 --> 03:23:04.760]  as well as his expiration date line.
[03:23:05.920 --> 03:23:08.700]  So that's one pack of the Baboon,
[03:23:08.700 --> 03:23:11.520]  one pack of Royal Jelly, one pack of B20.
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:13.600]  We're gonna put two minutes on the clock.
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:15.760]  We're gonna start the bidding.
[03:23:15.760 --> 03:23:17.380]  We'll start at 50 bucks.
[03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:22.720]  So on shit like that B20, you're gonna get,
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:24.420]  like if you know your pun in squares and stuff,
[03:23:24.420 --> 03:23:27.240]  you're gonna get recessives that come through.
[03:23:27.240 --> 03:23:29.740]  So you're gonna, because you're getting,
[03:23:29.740 --> 03:23:32.320]  because dominant trades don't really matter anymore,
[03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:35.320]  you're gonna get reoccurrences of recessive trades
[03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:36.640]  that never would have popped through.
[03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:38.200]  So you're gonna see a lot of stuff
[03:23:38.200 --> 03:23:40.920]  that people in just the F1 hybrids aren't gonna see.
[03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:44.200]  So you're gonna potentially get a lot more
[03:23:45.520 --> 03:23:49.680]  variants and options, which in his lines
[03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:52.800]  is gonna probably lead you to more variety
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:54.840]  in different types of washing plants.
[03:23:54.840 --> 03:23:55.800]  So you might be able to find something
[03:23:55.800 --> 03:23:57.920]  that's better for melt, something that's better for rosin,
[03:23:57.920 --> 03:24:00.600]  something that's better for dry sift, things like that.
[03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:03.680]  And some of those like internal back crosses,
[03:24:03.680 --> 03:24:06.460]  or in-crosses, really they're just extended,
[03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:09.180]  like polyhybrid in-crosses anyway.
[03:24:09.180 --> 03:24:11.460]  So that's a super fucking cool.
[03:24:11.460 --> 03:24:13.820]  Another thing to take note of when you look at T Beazle,
[03:24:13.820 --> 03:24:18.060]  he has, I believe, three Emerald Cup victories
[03:24:18.060 --> 03:24:21.500]  for solventless hash, and they're pretty much
[03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:22.820]  all with sour diesel.
[03:24:22.820 --> 03:24:24.900]  So any crosses with sour diesel
[03:24:24.900 --> 03:24:27.700]  or with his award-winning cup sour diesel,
[03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:30.300]  which is really important when in our world now
[03:24:30.300 --> 03:24:33.140]  everyone has the sour diesel, right?
[03:24:33.140 --> 03:24:35.900]  Well, he has the one that he won the cup with
[03:24:35.900 --> 03:24:37.340]  in solventless hash form.
[03:24:37.340 --> 03:24:41.180]  So it's a little more than just like the sour diesel, right?
[03:24:41.180 --> 03:24:43.140]  It's got a little more provenance
[03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:45.740]  and a little more proof to the pudding there.
[03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:50.260]  So that's a super, that glow plug is a super hot ticket,
[03:24:50.260 --> 03:24:53.020]  I would say, that's the one with the diesel in it, right?
[03:24:54.620 --> 03:24:55.740]  Jameson?
[03:24:55.740 --> 03:24:57.340]  100%.
[03:24:57.340 --> 03:24:59.480]  Yeah, so there's some really cool stuff there.
[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:04.480]  And if ice water hash is what you wanna do,
[03:25:04.540 --> 03:25:06.940]  this is a really good way to have something
[03:25:07.580 --> 03:25:08.980]  that's different and go about doing that.
[03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:17.270]  Perfect, so all right, Endless Summer's in the lead.
[03:25:17.270 --> 03:25:20.470]  Three packs, three seconds left.
[03:25:20.470 --> 03:25:23.870]  Oh, also, just so you know, fucking,
[03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:27.150]  I've been a gelato hater since you could be a gelato hater,
[03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:29.750]  but I finally ran something from one of my friends
[03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:33.310]  and it had that Acai gelato in it, and I'm fucking hooked.
[03:25:33.310 --> 03:25:36.350]  The shit actually smells like Acai bowls.
[03:25:36.350 --> 03:25:38.390]  Like if you go and get those smoothie bowls
[03:25:38.390 --> 03:25:41.230]  with the pink and purple fruit on the bottom,
[03:25:41.230 --> 03:25:43.590]  it is like, once you smell it,
[03:25:43.590 --> 03:25:45.150]  it's like now it's stuck in my head.
[03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:48.130]  So there's some really nice stuff
[03:25:48.130 --> 03:25:50.590]  as far as different fruity profiles,
[03:25:50.590 --> 03:25:52.990]  not quite blueberry, not quite raspberry,
[03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:57.550]  but kinda in between that sour purple berry flavor
[03:25:57.550 --> 03:26:00.210]  that you can find with that Acai gelato plant.
[03:26:00.210 --> 03:26:04.470]  So if you're gonna do a gelato,
[03:26:04.470 --> 03:26:06.570]  that one's kinda got my vote, I would say.
[03:26:07.570 --> 03:26:11.050]  It's in my savory sorbet that I got from Solo Seeds
[03:26:11.050 --> 03:26:12.090]  that I hunted, so.
[03:26:14.290 --> 03:26:18.370]  Okay, so I'm just trying to figure out
[03:26:18.370 --> 03:26:21.930]  where Turp Hunter's packs are,
[03:26:21.930 --> 03:26:26.930]  but we got the winner written down, Endless Summer.
[03:26:27.010 --> 03:26:29.250]  Congratulations, three packs of,
[03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:32.770]  saw them on Little Lake Valley for 160.
[03:26:33.610 --> 03:26:38.610]  All right, now we're gonna go to,
[03:26:39.770 --> 03:26:44.770]  we're gonna do a full Netic Sun Grown pack.
[03:26:44.890 --> 03:26:47.890]  So we're gonna do 50 of every seed.
[03:26:47.890 --> 03:26:52.890]  So we're gonna do a 50 pack of the Cherry West BX F2,
[03:26:52.890 --> 03:26:57.890]  a 50 pack of the Cherry West BX F2,
[03:26:59.330 --> 03:27:02.790]  a 50 pack of the Platinum Skittles by Cherry West,
[03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:07.790]  a 50 pack of the Lime Pop Kush by Sky Jaro by Cherry West,
[03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:11.370]  a 50 pack of the Pina by Guava Jelly CBD Rich
[03:27:11.370 --> 03:27:16.370]  by Cherry West, all for Hairy Rose, and all available.
[03:27:18.370 --> 03:27:22.450]  All 50 seeds, all regular, all from Cape Netic,
[03:27:23.290 --> 03:27:26.050]  and I don't know where the Guava Jelly is from,
[03:27:26.050 --> 03:27:30.590]  but everything else is from Freeborn Selections.
[03:27:33.250 --> 03:27:37.770]  So Chef Reese starting it off $200 for 200 seeds,
[03:27:37.770 --> 03:27:39.190]  that's a good start.
[03:27:41.450 --> 03:27:43.350]  So again, I'm gonna start the clock,
[03:27:43.350 --> 03:27:46.170]  I'll put three minutes on this one,
[03:27:46.170 --> 03:27:47.470]  because it's a bigger one.
[03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:51.890]  Yeah, that's a huge fucking breeder box, that's crazy.
[03:27:52.250 --> 03:27:53.810]  Yeah, this'll get you started.
[03:27:55.210 --> 03:27:56.050]  Yeah.
[03:27:58.430 --> 03:28:00.810]  You could potentially eradicate turpless weed
[03:28:00.810 --> 03:28:03.290]  from the face of the earth with that much seed right there.
[03:28:03.290 --> 03:28:06.930]  Not enough to do something with it, that's for sure.
[03:28:06.930 --> 03:28:11.930]  All right, so Cherry West BX F2, 50 seeds,
[03:28:12.330 --> 03:28:16.450]  Platinum Skittles, which I assume is the Platinum
[03:28:16.450 --> 03:28:21.030]  from in-house to the Skittles from third gen,
[03:28:21.930 --> 03:28:24.810]  to Cherry West, I could be wrong about that.
[03:28:24.810 --> 03:28:27.670]  The Lime Pop Kush, which is,
[03:28:29.170 --> 03:28:31.810]  is that the Cherry Lime Pop or the Lime Pop?
[03:28:32.850 --> 03:28:34.930]  We can find out from Cape Netic,
[03:28:34.930 --> 03:28:38.410]  to the Sky Jaro, to the Cherry West,
[03:28:38.410 --> 03:28:40.690]  and that's another 50 seeds.
[03:28:40.690 --> 03:28:45.690]  And then the Pina, which is Jackson's Pina,
[03:28:46.450 --> 03:28:51.330]  to Guava Jelly CBD Rich varietal to the Cherry West.
[03:28:51.930 --> 03:28:56.930]  So right now, Chef Reese, we got 250 or 200 seeds,
[03:28:57.810 --> 03:29:01.210]  $2.50 a seed, that's a good deal.
[03:29:01.210 --> 03:29:02.050]  It's a good deal.
[03:29:02.050 --> 03:29:04.210]  Hey, everybody, I gotta get moving.
[03:29:04.210 --> 03:29:07.290]  I'm gonna pass out, have a good one.
[03:29:07.290 --> 03:29:09.050]  Thank you so much for all the support, bro.
[03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:10.970]  I appreciate you so much, man.
[03:29:10.970 --> 03:29:12.130]  Thanks for coming through.
[03:29:12.130 --> 03:29:14.650]  It's not a prize, it's what Harry's done
[03:29:14.650 --> 03:29:17.550]  to fucking help everybody, so we're all doing our part.
[03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:19.250]  Thank you guys all for being here.
[03:29:19.250 --> 03:29:20.930]  Everybody, thanks for putting your money up
[03:29:20.970 --> 03:29:24.010]  and saving your money to spend seeds with all of us,
[03:29:24.010 --> 03:29:25.930]  and instead of your seed banks.
[03:29:25.930 --> 03:29:27.690]  I mean, support your local seed banks
[03:29:27.690 --> 03:29:30.610]  and your distant ones, but this is a big deal.
[03:29:30.610 --> 03:29:32.930]  This is community, so glad everybody's here.
[03:29:32.930 --> 03:29:33.770]  Peace out.
[03:29:34.690 --> 03:29:35.530]  Later, Quinn.
[03:29:40.490 --> 03:29:45.490]  All right, so we got one minute and seven seconds
[03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:48.910]  left on the clock.
[03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:53.910]  Jeff Reese in the lead with 250.
[03:29:53.950 --> 03:29:56.550]  This is for all the bag of tricks.
[03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:59.470]  This is for all four strains, 250 seeds each,
[03:29:59.470 --> 03:30:03.930]  regular seeds, bred outside, outdoors in Maine.
[03:30:05.550 --> 03:30:07.710]  Man, that's a nice amount of seed.
[03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:08.830]  You get a nice sift.
[03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:12.910]  That's no 10-pack.
[03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:14.230]  No.
[03:30:14.230 --> 03:30:17.910]  You call out half your mails if you're not looking for mails.
[03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:19.510]  Hey, keep it simple, you know?
[03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:22.110]  Just go find some good stuff.
[03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:22.950]  Yeah.
[03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:26.670]  260, first name, last name.
[03:30:26.670 --> 03:30:28.270]  Appreciate you, bro.
[03:30:28.270 --> 03:30:29.230]  Yeah, man, thanks.
[03:30:29.230 --> 03:30:30.070]  That's good.
[03:30:31.610 --> 03:30:33.210]  Helping the cause for every man.
[03:30:42.860 --> 03:30:44.540]  Sorry, guys, I'm just looking at,
[03:30:44.540 --> 03:30:46.860]  I'm trying to dig through my messages here.
[03:30:46.860 --> 03:30:48.100]  Everybody's reaching out,
[03:30:48.100 --> 03:30:50.780]  so I wanna make sure I get everybody put on.
[03:30:55.380 --> 03:30:57.380]  All right, that's it.
[03:30:57.380 --> 03:31:02.380]  So payment will be put up in the chat.
[03:31:03.100 --> 03:31:06.400]  There's Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal.
[03:31:08.700 --> 03:31:13.700]  There's also, yo, is that Chubby Monkey with 275?
[03:31:15.140 --> 03:31:16.160]  We're taking that.
[03:31:17.300 --> 03:31:19.100]  Right on, perfect, okay.
[03:31:20.820 --> 03:31:23.020]  Yeah, the payment, there you go.
[03:31:23.020 --> 03:31:25.620]  Venmo, Future Cannabis just threw it in right there.
[03:31:25.620 --> 03:31:27.560]  There's also PayPal if you need it.
[03:31:32.180 --> 03:31:37.180]  So right now I've got a donation from Hebe's Hashrozen.
[03:31:42.140 --> 03:31:45.700]  So Hebe's Hashrozen, I believe, is out of Alaska
[03:31:45.700 --> 03:31:48.460]  and does his own breeding.
[03:31:48.460 --> 03:31:53.460]  He's got the one pack of the Sunset Sherb
[03:31:54.460 --> 03:31:57.700]  to his Peanut Butter Breath.
[03:31:57.700 --> 03:32:00.220]  He's got one pack of his Meat Breath
[03:32:00.220 --> 03:32:02.300]  to his Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:06.700]  one pack of Apple Tarts to his Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:32:06.700 --> 03:32:09.460]  and a pack of Sour Patch Kiss,
[03:32:09.460 --> 03:32:13.420]  which is his Sour Kush to his Kimbo Kush
[03:32:13.420 --> 03:32:15.260]  to his Peanut Butter Breath.
[03:32:15.260 --> 03:32:18.060]  So he's clearly working with a Peanut Butter Breath male.
[03:32:18.340 --> 03:32:23.420]  They all do well to Hash,
[03:32:23.420 --> 03:32:25.420]  don't have exact numbers on all of them,
[03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:27.460]  15 seeds per pack.
[03:32:27.460 --> 03:32:30.620]  So I will show you a picture.
[03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:35.620]  These are from our friends Hebe's Hashrozen,
[03:32:37.800 --> 03:32:40.060]  Double Elite Genetics.
[03:32:40.060 --> 03:32:42.860]  I believe he's out of Alaska.
[03:32:42.860 --> 03:32:44.700]  I believe he's out of Alaska.
[03:32:45.700 --> 03:32:48.820]  So there we go.
[03:32:48.820 --> 03:32:50.500]  These are for Harry.
[03:32:50.500 --> 03:32:55.500]  Let's start the bidding at $40 just to start it.
[03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:05.020]  And adding Canadian shipping, I'd do 20 US.
[03:33:07.460 --> 03:33:08.980]  I think that's reasonable.
[03:33:10.820 --> 03:33:14.100]  And if you're national,
[03:33:14.540 --> 03:33:15.740]  then I think just 10.
[03:33:20.220 --> 03:33:24.300]  So again, I'm gonna start the clock, two minutes.
[03:33:28.140 --> 03:33:33.140]  And that is the Sunset Shard to his Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:33:37.820 --> 03:33:40.400]  the Meat Breath to his Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:43.020]  the Apple Tarts to his Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:33:43.020 --> 03:33:46.940]  and the Sour Kush to the Kimbo Kush
[03:33:46.940 --> 03:33:48.340]  to his Peanut Butter Breath.
[03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:52.740]  And these is a Hashmaker who also grows and breeds.
[03:33:54.260 --> 03:33:56.900]  Wayne Mustapha with 80.
[03:33:56.900 --> 03:33:58.380]  We appreciate you, Wayne.
[03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:02.860]  And these are the seeds here.
[03:34:10.020 --> 03:34:14.480]  We've got one minute on the clock.
[03:34:14.480 --> 03:34:16.300]  This is for Harry Rose.
[03:34:16.980 --> 03:34:19.980]  We appreciate each and every one of you coming out
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:23.220]  and just even hanging out with us.
[03:34:25.340 --> 03:34:30.340]  And this is the Sunset Shard to the Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:34:30.500 --> 03:34:32.780]  the Meat Breath to the Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:34:32.780 --> 03:34:34.980]  the Apple Tarts to the Peanut Butter Breath,
[03:34:34.980 --> 03:34:37.500]  and the Sour Patch Kiss, which is the Sour Kush
[03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:40.220]  and the Kimbo Kush to the Peanut Butter Breath.
[03:34:40.220 --> 03:34:42.980]  Each pack has 15 seeds.
[03:34:42.980 --> 03:34:47.200]  So your total of 60 seeds.
[03:34:49.660 --> 03:34:54.660]  And the current lead is Wayne Mustapha with 80.
[03:34:55.460 --> 03:34:57.460]  We appreciate you, Wayne Mustapha.
[03:34:58.860 --> 03:34:59.900]  Yeah, right on Wayne.
[03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:06.620]  We'll do another freebie after this one too,
[03:35:06.620 --> 03:35:07.780]  get people fired up.
[03:35:07.780 --> 03:35:09.320]  Don't forget, go tell your friends.
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:10.900]  We're giving away free stuff.
[03:35:10.900 --> 03:35:13.460]  Everyone's trying to come out for Harry.
[03:35:13.460 --> 03:35:14.380]  Let's keep it rolling.
[03:35:14.860 --> 03:35:16.940]  It's only 1230, let's go.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:18.020]  Let's go.
[03:35:18.020 --> 03:35:19.540]  I'm trying to...
[03:35:23.780 --> 03:35:25.860]  All right, we got how much?
[03:35:25.860 --> 03:35:26.780]  I don't wanna...
[03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:30.220]  That's it.
[03:35:30.220 --> 03:35:32.060]  That's time, congratulations.
[03:35:32.060 --> 03:35:33.620]  Oh, big wave Dave.
[03:35:33.620 --> 03:35:34.860]  Big wave Dave.
[03:35:34.860 --> 03:35:35.700]  What up, Dave?
[03:35:36.900 --> 03:35:37.740]  Coming in.
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:42.180]  Coming to get those new tarps, congrats.
[03:35:42.180 --> 03:35:44.300]  All right, congrats, big wave Dave.
[03:35:49.260 --> 03:35:51.340]  All right, freebie time.
[03:35:52.300 --> 03:35:54.820]  We're giving away Bob's Cheddar.
[03:35:54.820 --> 03:35:57.480]  It's the Bruce Banner into the space cheese.
[03:35:58.700 --> 03:36:01.180]  10 seeds regular.
[03:36:01.180 --> 03:36:04.900]  First one to say...
[03:36:04.900 --> 03:36:06.140]  What do we got, what do we got?
[03:36:06.140 --> 03:36:08.780]  No, no, no, you're gonna do the hashtag.
[03:36:08.780 --> 03:36:10.180]  Yeah, let's do the hashtag spin.
[03:36:10.180 --> 03:36:11.740]  You're right, Peter's on point.
[03:36:15.260 --> 03:36:17.500]  But you gotta tell them what the hashtag is.
[03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:18.980]  I told them earlier.
[03:36:19.020 --> 03:36:21.300]  There's probably already a bunch in there.
[03:36:21.300 --> 03:36:23.100]  I'm gonna type it in right now.
[03:36:27.620 --> 03:36:28.780]  Actually, I can't remember.
[03:36:28.780 --> 03:36:29.620]  It was...
[03:36:29.620 --> 03:36:31.220]  It was Harry Rose.
[03:36:31.220 --> 03:36:32.860]  Yeah, but it was all cap sensitive.
[03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:34.940]  I don't remember what the fuck I did.
[03:36:34.940 --> 03:36:39.940]  I'm not sure if the thing that randomly selects
[03:36:39.940 --> 03:36:43.020]  is case sensitive, but you were...
[03:36:43.020 --> 03:36:44.980]  Harry, hashtag Harry...
[03:36:44.980 --> 03:36:46.380]  Here, I'll put it in the...
[03:36:47.380 --> 03:36:48.620]  Hold on.
[03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:55.710]  That.
[03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:56.550]  There we go.
[03:37:02.090 --> 03:37:03.730]  We got some people...
[03:37:03.730 --> 03:37:04.890]  We're close.
[03:37:06.330 --> 03:37:07.490]  Yeah, you gotta stay sharp.
[03:37:07.490 --> 03:37:09.890]  It's midnight, we're giving away free stuff,
[03:37:09.890 --> 03:37:11.050]  but we're not just giving it away.
[03:37:11.050 --> 03:37:15.210]  You gotta at least think for three seconds consecutively.
[03:37:19.850 --> 03:37:21.610]  There we go, look at that.
[03:37:31.350 --> 03:37:35.910]  And you can thank Boneyard Seeds for all these freebies.
[03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:36.950]  It's all on them.
[03:37:39.870 --> 03:37:41.030]  Shout out to Boneyard.
[03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:48.790]  All right, so...
[03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:50.230]  Can you pull the wheel up, Peter?
[03:37:50.230 --> 03:37:51.230]  Do you have a...
[03:37:51.230 --> 03:37:53.510]  I sure can, hold on.
[03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:56.630]  All right.
[03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:59.230]  You wanna give it 10 more seconds?
[03:37:59.230 --> 03:38:02.590]  And who was that?
[03:38:02.590 --> 03:38:04.430]  Big wave, Dave.
[03:38:05.310 --> 03:38:08.870]  The PayPal is right in here.
[03:38:12.030 --> 03:38:16.710]  If you see that, most recent chat.
[03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:21.910]  Okay, here we go.
[03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:25.230]  You ready?
[03:38:25.230 --> 03:38:26.310]  You wanna call it?
[03:38:27.430 --> 03:38:28.830]  Yeah, everyone send it.
[03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:30.470]  If you haven't logged into your second account
[03:38:30.470 --> 03:38:33.470]  or told someone, I think we started it like 25 minutes ago.
[03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:35.190]  Let's roll.
[03:38:36.270 --> 03:38:37.110]  All right.
[03:38:41.460 --> 03:38:44.260]  We got 25 entries so far.
[03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:46.060]  Wow, oh, there we go.
[03:38:47.220 --> 03:38:52.220]  There we go, we'll give you five, four, three,
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:58.340]  three, three, two, one.
[03:39:00.700 --> 03:39:02.380]  We'll get to 30, how about that?
[03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:04.180]  There we go.
[03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:09.590]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[03:39:12.910 --> 03:39:14.230]  Damn.
[03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:20.670]  That was like the, what is it?
[03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:23.550]  The Wheel of Fortune wheel where like,
[03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:25.750]  it just goes past the new car.
[03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:29.190]  I thought you had this one in the bag.
[03:39:29.190 --> 03:39:30.870]  Purple thumb.
[03:39:36.490 --> 03:39:37.330]  Purple thumb?
[03:39:37.450 --> 03:39:38.530]  Purple thumb.
[03:39:39.410 --> 03:39:40.890]  Yeah, you scored purple thumb.
[03:39:40.890 --> 03:39:43.450]  That's the Bruce Banner number three
[03:39:43.450 --> 03:39:45.330]  into the space cheese.
[03:39:45.330 --> 03:39:47.170]  Hit me up on Insta, you scored.
[03:39:48.090 --> 03:39:51.250]  Yeah, Rotten Skateboards on Insta.
[03:39:53.650 --> 03:39:57.810]  Or you want that or Lobster Fam Farms?
[03:39:57.810 --> 03:39:59.290]  Yeah, Rotten's cool.
[03:39:59.290 --> 03:40:00.130]  Okay.
[03:40:03.180 --> 03:40:04.180]  How about you, Peter?
[03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:05.740]  You got anything you wanna throw up, Peter?
[03:40:05.740 --> 03:40:07.860]  I imagine you got a random seed pack
[03:40:07.980 --> 03:40:09.340]  or two kicking around now.
[03:40:11.940 --> 03:40:15.060]  I can, I'm trying to think.
[03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:20.060]  I'm finishing out some, they're not ready,
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:25.300]  but some Lime One, Grape Soda, Skunk, Cherry West.
[03:40:28.620 --> 03:40:29.460]  Nice.
[03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:33.140]  I could throw up 50 of those.
[03:40:33.140 --> 03:40:34.460]  We can do futures.
[03:40:34.740 --> 03:40:38.260]  People, some people are into futures.
[03:40:38.260 --> 03:40:40.060]  You get them when they're done?
[03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:41.660]  Yeah, I was gonna say, it'll be,
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:46.500]  I'm shopping them in probably two weeks.
[03:40:47.940 --> 03:40:50.740]  All right, so we got, we're gonna put up three minutes.
[03:40:50.740 --> 03:40:52.460]  Let's talk about it.
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:54.020]  Futures, that's cool.
[03:40:57.020 --> 03:40:58.900]  Yeah, those are the ones I've been talking about
[03:40:58.900 --> 03:41:02.300]  that I'm growing in like six different neighbor's yards.
[03:41:06.160 --> 03:41:11.160]  That's better than all over your yard, spread them out.
[03:41:13.720 --> 03:41:15.280]  My wife hates the smell.
[03:41:17.480 --> 03:41:21.200]  So you, did you do the cross?
[03:41:21.200 --> 03:41:23.960]  Yeah, that's a mean gene, that's Jackson.
[03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:25.240]  Okay, okay, okay.
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:28.840]  But the seeds that you're harvesting,
[03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:33.720]  like did you do, how are you, how'd you create the seed?
[03:41:33.720 --> 03:41:38.720]  I did an open pollination from what Jackson sent down to me.
[03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:39.560]  Gotcha.
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:44.560]  And so it was three males and 10 females.
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:47.560]  Oh, that's very cool.
[03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:52.120]  Wayne Mustapha participating.
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:56.320]  Futures are better than unreleased, huh?
[03:41:56.320 --> 03:41:57.160]  Oh yeah.
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:02.200]  Wayne Mustapha at 60, we got two minutes on the clock.
[03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:07.240]  At open pollination directed by the breeder himself,
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:09.920]  executed by Peter.
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:11.920]  You're looking for-
[03:42:11.920 --> 03:42:14.880]  The support Harry Rose, that's pretty tough right there.
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:16.640]  And the support Harry Rose.
[03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:18.480]  THC Garage with 70.
[03:42:18.480 --> 03:42:21.640]  I see you been all night THC Garage, appreciate you.
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:29.640]  And I have other stuff that's gonna be months after that.
[03:42:29.800 --> 03:42:34.640]  So we'll hold off on that for a future fundraiser.
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:38.280]  Yeah, too far in the future futures is dangerous.
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:40.400]  That's the Panama Red Crosses
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:43.680]  that are just starting to show sex.
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:47.440]  Rotten Skateboards is a big skateboarder.
[03:42:47.440 --> 03:42:51.120]  So if you check him out on his page, Rotten Skateboards.
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:53.920]  If you wanna see the type of wounds I took yesterday,
[03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:55.440]  we're actively in the field.
[03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:56.280]  Oh.
[03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:00.440]  I'm down to the white meat on this one.
[03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:01.640]  I won't even show it.
[03:43:03.160 --> 03:43:05.360]  You got one minute left on those.
[03:43:06.920 --> 03:43:11.920]  70 THC Garage for the 50 open pollination from Jackson.
[03:43:18.630 --> 03:43:21.550]  Daga does send some of the best freebies in the biz.
[03:43:21.550 --> 03:43:23.490]  Shout out Peter and the fam.
[03:43:23.730 --> 03:43:24.570]  Ha ha.
[03:43:26.930 --> 03:43:28.290]  Shipping charges to Canada.
[03:43:28.290 --> 03:43:31.990]  We're doing 20 to Canada, 10 domestic.
[03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:34.250]  36 seconds left on the clock.
[03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:44.830]  75, Wayne Mustapha shall not be stopped.
[03:43:44.830 --> 03:43:45.670]  He's home.
[03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:48.310]  What, like $1.25 per seed?
[03:43:48.310 --> 03:43:49.150]  Yeah, come on.
[03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:53.070]  $80, Dave not there, lifting it up.
[03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:54.390]  Sorry, let's see the rest.
[03:43:55.390 --> 03:43:58.550]  Is that a recent accident?
[03:44:00.310 --> 03:44:01.150]  Dave's not there.
[03:44:01.150 --> 03:44:02.270]  Rotten.
[03:44:02.270 --> 03:44:04.710]  At 80, Rotten's not here.
[03:44:06.350 --> 03:44:08.670]  How did that go to last name?
[03:44:08.670 --> 03:44:11.270]  I caught one yesterday goofing around with my knees.
[03:44:11.270 --> 03:44:14.510]  Pretty much both hands are all tore up really, really bad.
[03:44:15.790 --> 03:44:17.550]  This here's down to the white meat.
[03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:19.330]  We're up to $2 a seed.
[03:44:21.350 --> 03:44:24.170]  First name, last name, $2 a seed.
[03:44:25.350 --> 03:44:27.350]  Eugene from Mendocino.
[03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:29.630]  Open pollination.
[03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:39.340]  I've got some packs here from Turp Hunter.
[03:44:40.500 --> 03:44:41.340]  Actually.
[03:44:43.500 --> 03:44:48.500]  He is putting up.
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:56.680]  All right, so Turp Hunter out of Washington
[03:44:56.720 --> 03:45:01.720]  is gonna be putting up a pack of the very sought after
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:06.720]  Southern Hospitality from Little Lake Valley Seed Co.
[03:45:06.720 --> 03:45:11.720]  As well as two bonus packs from a new company,
[03:45:13.580 --> 03:45:15.880]  which is his friend's breeding company
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:20.880]  that uses the mail from Little Lake's Jelly Donut Pack.
[03:45:21.880 --> 03:45:26.680]  So they are related, these three packs.
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:29.880]  But I don't have pictures of the two other packs
[03:45:29.880 --> 03:45:31.920]  or the Southern Hospitality.
[03:45:31.920 --> 03:45:34.240]  What I do know is I have smoked
[03:45:34.240 --> 03:45:36.760]  and seen Southern Hospitality growing.
[03:45:37.640 --> 03:45:41.040]  MTS Farms found two keepers that yielded,
[03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:45.860]  I believe over 4.5% to rosin.
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:50.360]  So really impressive genetics with Little Lake Valley.
[03:45:50.800 --> 03:45:53.120]  I'm gonna put the two minutes on the clock
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:54.680]  and we're gonna get it started.
[03:45:59.380 --> 03:46:03.700]  And first name, last name, hit me,
[03:46:03.700 --> 03:46:08.700]  donate at dagga.love, D-A-G-G-A dot L-O-V-E.
[03:46:12.810 --> 03:46:14.250]  It's not dagga.garden?
[03:46:14.250 --> 03:46:16.450]  That's what I've been pumping up all night.
[03:46:16.450 --> 03:46:18.930]  It, they go to each other.
[03:46:18.930 --> 03:46:23.450]  If you type in dagga.love, it goes to dagga.garden.
[03:46:23.450 --> 03:46:28.090]  But for my email, I use the love.
[03:46:29.890 --> 03:46:34.890]  So we got one pack of Southern Hospitality.
[03:46:36.970 --> 03:46:39.490]  Yeah, the pack is signed by Team Diesel himself.
[03:46:39.490 --> 03:46:40.610]  Thank you, Adam.
[03:46:40.610 --> 03:46:43.210]  So the pack is signed by Team Diesel himself.
[03:46:43.210 --> 03:46:45.810]  It is signed at Melting of the Heads.
[03:46:45.810 --> 03:46:50.650]  And it is with two other packs.
[03:46:50.650 --> 03:46:52.430]  It's Southern Hospitality.
[03:46:54.450 --> 03:46:59.450]  If somebody can look up that cross, I could look it up.
[03:46:59.810 --> 03:47:00.650]  I'll look it up.
[03:47:04.130 --> 03:47:05.090]  Coffee time.
[03:47:06.530 --> 03:47:08.610]  I gotta put my eye drops in.
[03:47:18.310 --> 03:47:20.970]  Someone was asking before if I actually make skateboards.
[03:47:20.970 --> 03:47:23.170]  Yes, I'm gonna be auctioning off some soon
[03:47:23.170 --> 03:47:25.350]  once it slows down a little.
[03:47:34.260 --> 03:47:36.660]  All right, there we go.
[03:47:36.660 --> 03:47:37.500]  I think Adam.
[03:47:37.620 --> 03:47:39.060]  I figured it out.
[03:47:39.060 --> 03:47:40.500]  Adam got it.
[03:47:45.980 --> 03:47:50.220]  Is Chris gonna put up his entire fall harvest
[03:47:51.260 --> 03:47:52.540]  for a good cause?
[03:47:53.380 --> 03:47:55.380]  Chris was boycotted from the link.
[03:48:00.770 --> 03:48:02.490]  All right, there it is.
[03:48:04.050 --> 03:48:04.890]  All right.
[03:48:06.970 --> 03:48:10.090]  So that goes to Oreck.
[03:48:10.090 --> 03:48:11.690]  Congratulations, Oreck.
[03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:17.010]  You are the winner of the signed Southern Hospitality pack
[03:48:18.010 --> 03:48:20.650]  and the two other unknown packs
[03:48:20.650 --> 03:48:23.630]  that are listed there by Adam Bear.
[03:48:26.190 --> 03:48:27.150]  You killed it, man.
[03:48:27.150 --> 03:48:32.490]  That's a good grab.
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:36.760]  Awesome, yeah.
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:38.640]  Rodden, let's see these skateboards, bro.
[03:48:38.640 --> 03:48:40.880]  I'd love to see these skateboards, man.
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:45.320]  Okay, let me get the phone going real quick.
[03:48:45.320 --> 03:48:47.120]  So when you say you make the skateboard,
[03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:48.120]  like do you buy it?
[03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:51.920]  So I get to do the fun part.
[03:48:51.920 --> 03:48:54.980]  I get to come up with the ideas for the graphics.
[03:48:54.980 --> 03:48:58.220]  They manufacture them down in Alabama
[03:48:58.220 --> 03:48:59.940]  and it's just like a husband and a wife
[03:48:59.940 --> 03:49:01.700]  who've been doing it since the mid 90s.
[03:49:01.700 --> 03:49:02.540]  It's craft.
[03:49:02.540 --> 03:49:03.520]  It's like their whole life.
[03:49:03.520 --> 03:49:04.920]  Same as a good gardener.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:06.000]  They do a small batch.
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:07.280]  It takes for goddamn ever.
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:10.620]  The lead times are horrendous, but it's craft.
[03:49:11.620 --> 03:49:14.180]  My buddy does the graphic designs.
[03:49:14.180 --> 03:49:16.320]  He worked at Lego for a number of years,
[03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:18.740]  so he's like overqualified for my ideas
[03:49:18.740 --> 03:49:21.800]  and I pretty much just get to come up with concepts.
[03:49:23.780 --> 03:49:24.900]  That's the fun part.
[03:49:28.770 --> 03:49:29.610]  So let me-
[03:49:29.610 --> 03:49:31.090]  Wow, those look nice, man.
[03:49:31.090 --> 03:49:34.650]  Let me dial in my phone and then I'll go lay them out
[03:49:34.650 --> 03:49:38.130]  and I'll show the seeds.
[03:49:38.130 --> 03:49:39.090]  I'm gonna be putting up too.
[03:49:39.090 --> 03:49:40.170]  How many people we got in here?
[03:49:40.170 --> 03:49:40.990]  110.
[03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:42.170]  Someone's gonna get a screaming deal.
[03:49:42.930 --> 03:49:44.370]  Hopefully someone appreciates it.
[03:49:46.410 --> 03:49:48.410]  Ron, so those are undrilled.
[03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:49.650]  I don't know much about boards,
[03:49:49.650 --> 03:49:53.010]  but I know that looks like a really nice quality board.
[03:49:53.010 --> 03:49:55.690]  No, they come pre-drilled.
[03:49:55.690 --> 03:49:56.650]  That's an important part.
[03:49:56.650 --> 03:49:58.690]  It has to be super precise.
[03:49:58.690 --> 03:49:59.530]  Right on.
[03:50:01.570 --> 03:50:04.730]  Yeah, that looks like a really nice board.
[03:50:04.730 --> 03:50:06.930]  People have been getting really good deals.
[03:50:06.930 --> 03:50:07.770]  All right.
[03:50:45.330 --> 03:50:49.770]  Agnes, don't forget to reach out to
[03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:55.170]  Terpene K15 on Instagram
[03:50:55.170 --> 03:50:56.650]  and they can send you a link
[03:50:57.530 --> 03:50:59.970]  to be able to come into this live
[03:50:59.970 --> 03:51:02.970]  and you can talk about your seeds.
[03:51:02.970 --> 03:51:06.750]  That is definitely some mango sorbet, Green Valley Grower.
[03:51:14.010 --> 03:51:14.850]  All right.
[03:51:25.340 --> 03:51:28.860]  So I wanna throw a possible just, you know,
[03:51:28.860 --> 03:51:31.500]  buy me now deal if you want.
[03:51:31.500 --> 03:51:35.820]  If you want all seven of the translation series,
[03:51:35.820 --> 03:51:38.300]  that's like enough to fill up a whole goddamn wall.
[03:51:38.300 --> 03:51:40.900]  If you wanna just hang them on your wall,
[03:51:40.900 --> 03:51:42.020]  if you wanna skate them,
[03:51:42.020 --> 03:51:44.500]  I got pretty much all the sizes available.
[03:51:45.420 --> 03:51:46.500]  What do we call this?
[03:51:46.500 --> 03:51:50.580]  We'll call this 200 bucks if someone wants to just snag it.
[03:51:51.420 --> 03:51:52.340]  If not, we'll start throwing some seeds
[03:51:52.340 --> 03:51:53.540]  in with some other shit.
[03:51:54.980 --> 03:51:57.580]  But if you know skateboarders, it's a screaming deal.
[03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:17.350]  All right, Kiwi Cake, damn.
[03:52:17.350 --> 03:52:19.990]  Sweet deal, don't sleep.
[03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:22.230]  I'm not a skateboarder, but oh, there's some,
[03:52:22.230 --> 03:52:24.710]  oh, damn, we got some packs here too.
[03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:28.190]  So if no one wants just that,
[03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:30.690]  then we'll line up some seeds too.
[03:52:31.570 --> 03:52:35.090]  So we got the Masonic Blueberry little bundle here.
[03:52:38.350 --> 03:52:40.950]  Blue Night, Dosey Dose, Wilson F2.
[03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:45.410]  That DJ Blueberry, Newberry Wilson.
[03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:50.910]  Blueberry V2, Wilson F2.
[03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:52.830]  So you got the good old Wilson all up in there
[03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:53.830]  with some blueberry.
[03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:55.970]  If you're looking to get some blueberry turps going,
[03:52:55.970 --> 03:52:56.950]  start hunting.
[03:52:57.830 --> 03:53:00.150]  All right, is that what you wanna do?
[03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:03.470]  Let's break it up into chunks here, that's a lot.
[03:53:03.470 --> 03:53:04.990]  You tell me, I got a gang of shit.
[03:53:04.990 --> 03:53:07.190]  I was trying to just get someone to come up.
[03:53:08.230 --> 03:53:09.670]  Bro, let's do that.
[03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:12.710]  Let's break it up, make sure.
[03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:15.350]  Let's do the Masonic Blueberry bundle then.
[03:53:15.350 --> 03:53:18.350]  All right, so talk about the Blueberry bundle.
[03:53:18.350 --> 03:53:20.270]  I'll put a few minutes on the clock.
[03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:23.430]  Oh, I don't know too much about it.
[03:53:23.430 --> 03:53:27.250]  I know the Wilson is well known to dump.
[03:53:27.250 --> 03:53:29.410]  Blueberry was one of the first batch.
[03:53:29.410 --> 03:53:32.170]  We used to just call it Heddy's back then.
[03:53:32.170 --> 03:53:35.010]  I think it was 1998 or some shit like that.
[03:53:35.010 --> 03:53:37.370]  And that was one of the first batches of cannabis I got
[03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:42.250]  that made me know like, yeah, I wanna get more into this.
[03:53:42.250 --> 03:53:44.230]  Northern Lights number five that same year,
[03:53:44.230 --> 03:53:45.970]  but the Blueberry was really the first,
[03:53:45.970 --> 03:53:47.010]  I'll never forget it.
[03:53:47.010 --> 03:53:50.010]  So hold something special in my heart, that's for sure.
[03:53:50.010 --> 03:53:52.570]  Anyone who tasted it knows what I'm talking about.
[03:53:59.860 --> 03:54:01.580]  What other packs you got in there?
[03:54:01.580 --> 03:54:05.600]  I see, I see Dave, yeah, Dave's stalking that, yeah.
[03:54:07.220 --> 03:54:11.260]  The Frog Farts expensive, that one's a...
[03:54:11.260 --> 03:54:13.140]  Yeah, I was gonna just bundle everything together.
[03:54:13.140 --> 03:54:14.380]  Did anyone pop on this one?
[03:54:14.380 --> 03:54:15.860]  Anyone got any interest or no?
[03:54:17.220 --> 03:54:18.980]  Nobody's popped yet.
[03:54:18.980 --> 03:54:21.460]  Starting bid, 50 bucks.
[03:54:21.460 --> 03:54:24.100]  Randy, 100 bucks, there we go.
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:25.740]  There we go, game on.
[03:54:25.740 --> 03:54:26.580]  Let's go.
[03:54:26.580 --> 03:54:29.460]  Randy, we got a minute left.
[03:54:30.300 --> 03:54:33.020]  All right, so what actually is the deal?
[03:54:33.020 --> 03:54:35.000]  So we got how many packs available?
[03:54:36.660 --> 03:54:41.660]  These three, I'll throw in another one right now.
[03:54:42.860 --> 03:54:45.140]  Yeah, let's throw another one on.
[03:54:45.140 --> 03:54:48.720]  Ghost OG, Space Cheese, 15 Seeds of Regs.
[03:54:54.030 --> 03:54:57.750]  We got four packs, I think the bid's at 100.
[03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:59.510]  Bid's at 100.
[03:54:59.510 --> 03:55:01.110]  Yeah, you can't argue with that.
[03:55:02.110 --> 03:55:03.670]  And every little bit counts,
[03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:06.110]  don't forget we're supporting the big homie.
[03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:09.070]  Wayne Mustapha says 150 with a board.
[03:55:09.070 --> 03:55:11.190]  Oh, 100%.
[03:55:11.190 --> 03:55:13.550]  There you go, 150 with a board.
[03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:14.950]  Should we just close it out there
[03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:16.270]  or are we gonna keep competing?
[03:55:16.270 --> 03:55:20.670]  Ah, it's got a board now, we got about 30, 15 seconds left.
[03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:22.310]  Let's see what everybody has to say.
[03:55:22.310 --> 03:55:23.630]  Anyone who knows anything,
[03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:25.950]  that shipping on a skateboard's no fucking joke,
[03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:26.890]  so let's go.
[03:55:32.490 --> 03:55:35.610]  All right, going once, going twice.
[03:55:38.250 --> 03:55:40.770]  Sold to Wayne Mustapha.
[03:55:40.770 --> 03:55:42.450]  You got it, homie.
[03:55:42.450 --> 03:55:43.970]  Here, take a quick look at them
[03:55:43.970 --> 03:55:46.330]  and you keep in mind which one you got
[03:55:46.330 --> 03:55:47.890]  or which one you want, let me know.
[03:55:47.890 --> 03:55:48.770]  And if you're gonna ride it,
[03:55:48.770 --> 03:55:51.170]  let me know what size you want, I'll lace you up.
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:55.940]  All these ones say rotten skateboards
[03:55:55.940 --> 03:55:57.200]  just in a different language.
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:55:58.860]  Whatever the flag's representing,
[03:55:59.780 --> 03:56:01.500]  it's what language it's in.
[03:56:01.500 --> 03:56:03.060]  You tell me which one you got
[03:56:03.060 --> 03:56:04.760]  or which one you want, you got it.
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:08.380]  All right, next one, we'll get that frog fart going
[03:56:08.380 --> 03:56:12.160]  if Dave's not here still, still creeping around.
[03:56:13.300 --> 03:56:14.700]  I'm gonna get some time on the clock.
[03:56:14.700 --> 03:56:16.780]  How about the frog fart and a board?
[03:56:17.820 --> 03:56:19.680]  Just the frog fart and a board?
[03:56:19.680 --> 03:56:21.420]  Well, let's see what happens.
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:24.820]  Because I'll tell you, you know what I mean,
[03:56:24.820 --> 03:56:26.540]  like just the shipping on a board's like,
[03:56:26.540 --> 03:56:27.940]  you know, it's crushing it,
[03:56:27.940 --> 03:56:30.100]  so I'd rather do them with some kind of bundles
[03:56:30.100 --> 03:56:31.460]  and try to get as much as I can,
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:33.620]  but I'm not tripping either, we'll send it.
[03:56:34.660 --> 03:56:37.740]  So we'll do the frog fart, which I actually got.
[03:56:37.740 --> 03:56:40.140]  This was from the Nick Risden auction
[03:56:40.140 --> 03:56:42.780]  to raise some funds for his medical bills.
[03:56:42.780 --> 03:56:44.060]  A lot of time with these auctions,
[03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:46.340]  I'll just snag something up and kind of recycle it in
[03:56:46.340 --> 03:56:48.100]  and just keep the good vibes rolling.
[03:56:48.100 --> 03:56:50.340]  So this one already has good vibes attached to it.
[03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:52.500]  There's probably some fucking winners in there.
[03:56:53.820 --> 03:56:55.580]  This is a little one pack.
[03:56:56.420 --> 03:56:58.060]  This is a fucking blackberry,
[03:56:58.100 --> 03:57:00.740]  and I just like it because it's got a sexy ass Mylar.
[03:57:02.100 --> 03:57:06.660]  So we got the Bread Buy 42, Not For Sale 3B one pack.
[03:57:06.660 --> 03:57:09.100]  There's way more package in here than the seeds should get,
[03:57:09.100 --> 03:57:10.440]  but we'll send that too.
[03:57:12.660 --> 03:57:13.960]  I got this one.
[03:57:15.980 --> 03:57:19.220]  The White and the 87 Lime Pop.
[03:57:19.220 --> 03:57:20.460]  And this homie was dope.
[03:57:20.460 --> 03:57:21.900]  I met him at an event one time
[03:57:21.900 --> 03:57:24.300]  and we were talking about the white for like an hour,
[03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:25.580]  just old school cat,
[03:57:25.580 --> 03:57:27.020]  and we were just tripping on it for a long time.
[03:57:27.020 --> 03:57:28.980]  He started pulling out seeds left and right to get me.
[03:57:28.980 --> 03:57:31.660]  So this one I haven't gone through yet,
[03:57:31.660 --> 03:57:33.820]  but could be some fire in there.
[03:57:33.820 --> 03:57:34.660]  So why don't we-
[03:57:34.660 --> 03:57:36.700]  There should be fire in that white.
[03:57:36.700 --> 03:57:39.180]  Why don't we do those three?
[03:57:39.180 --> 03:57:40.140]  And if it gets to-
[03:57:40.140 --> 03:57:43.040]  Dave, how'd you go from 200 down to 100?
[03:57:44.940 --> 03:57:47.260]  Because he wanted the Masonic with it.
[03:57:47.260 --> 03:57:48.500]  I see where you're at.
[03:57:48.500 --> 03:57:49.980]  He's a smart cat.
[03:57:50.900 --> 03:57:55.900]  We could throw a NorCal Space Goo in there too.
[03:57:57.940 --> 03:57:59.860]  10 seeds a regular.
[03:57:59.860 --> 03:58:01.300]  So we got those four packs.
[03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:03.100]  And if it gets up to at least up to like,
[03:58:03.100 --> 03:58:04.620]  let's say two and a quarter,
[03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:07.180]  200 we'll call it and I'll throw a board in there.
[03:58:08.060 --> 03:58:08.900]  There you go.
[03:58:08.900 --> 03:58:10.180]  200 for a board.
[03:58:10.180 --> 03:58:13.260]  Dave's not there right now with 100.
[03:58:13.260 --> 03:58:15.860]  Looking at these four packs.
[03:58:16.980 --> 03:58:17.820]  And like I said,
[03:58:17.820 --> 03:58:20.380]  this one's already got good vibe blaze to it.
[03:58:20.380 --> 03:58:22.920]  So this one's gonna crack some keepers.
[03:58:24.820 --> 03:58:26.340]  Good vibes all around.
[03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:33.590]  Going once.
[03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:38.670]  Going twice.
[03:58:43.350 --> 03:58:45.550]  150, Dave's not there.
[03:58:45.550 --> 03:58:48.350]  Yo, appreciate you Dave.
[03:58:48.350 --> 03:58:49.590]  That's solid Dave.
[03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:50.430]  You know the value.
[03:58:50.430 --> 03:58:51.270]  This pack's good.
[03:58:51.270 --> 03:58:53.310]  Good against me, so.
[03:58:53.310 --> 03:58:54.150]  Dave's on point.
[03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:55.950]  200, Russell Garnett.
[03:58:56.950 --> 03:58:58.190]  There we go.
[03:58:58.190 --> 03:59:00.390]  200, let it ride.
[03:59:00.390 --> 03:59:01.910]  Yeah, the white man.
[03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:03.950]  Yeah, that's, yeah, man.
[03:59:05.910 --> 03:59:07.910]  Yeah, that white got some potency to it.
[03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:09.590]  It's genetic, man.
[03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:10.950]  Oh yeah.
[03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:15.030]  Breaks up nice, turns nice.
[03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:17.150]  It makes nice tricones, man.
[03:59:17.150 --> 03:59:19.990]  Don't forget this one pack with the sexy Mylar either.
[03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:21.430]  This one's got the nice feel.
[03:59:21.430 --> 03:59:24.150]  I don't know what sort of R&D they did on this pack.
[03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:25.390]  I'm not sure what they did with this.
[03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:27.590]  You had a snipe here.
[03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:31.030]  Yeah, I'm not sure if it ended,
[03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:33.550]  but we keep it rolling if anyone wants to throw more.
[03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:34.390]  Russell takes it.
[03:59:34.390 --> 03:59:35.590]  I'll throw some more shit on too.
[03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:37.830]  What do we got sitting around?
[03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:39.710]  Russell takes it with his skateboard.
[03:59:43.570 --> 03:59:46.050]  You can add that to the next one, Rob.
[03:59:46.050 --> 03:59:47.810]  Just leave that with his skateboard
[03:59:47.810 --> 03:59:49.810]  and give it to Russell Garnett.
[03:59:49.810 --> 03:59:51.290]  All right, sounds good.
[03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:52.490]  Unless Dave's not here,
[03:59:52.490 --> 03:59:56.250]  unless he wants the green beans.
[03:59:56.290 --> 03:59:58.450]  He let it go.
[03:59:58.450 --> 04:00:00.370]  If Dave's not here, let it go.
[04:00:00.370 --> 04:00:01.210]  All right.
[04:00:02.210 --> 04:00:03.050]  Awesome.
[04:00:04.530 --> 04:00:06.250]  Right, what's up next, man?
[04:00:07.770 --> 04:00:09.970]  All right, now he was on here earlier.
[04:00:09.970 --> 04:00:13.210]  This is from Good People's Gardens.
[04:00:13.210 --> 04:00:14.610]  This isn't even cannabis.
[04:00:14.610 --> 04:00:16.090]  This is a gourd.
[04:00:16.090 --> 04:00:17.290]  So if there's anyone out here
[04:00:17.290 --> 04:00:19.650]  that grows more than cannabis,
[04:00:19.650 --> 04:00:22.410]  we're gonna start with this one and get your gourd on.
[04:00:23.610 --> 04:00:24.450]  Ooh.
[04:00:24.450 --> 04:00:26.130]  I'm not sure if anyone could look this up.
[04:00:26.970 --> 04:00:28.450]  I forget what the goddamn SLH is.
[04:00:28.450 --> 04:00:29.810]  Uber Lemonade.
[04:00:29.810 --> 04:00:31.330]  There we go, yeah.
[04:00:31.330 --> 04:00:34.650]  And that's crossed with the phone home.
[04:00:34.650 --> 04:00:37.370]  Think there's 11 seeds in here I counted before.
[04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:38.650]  Doesn't say if they're regular or not.
[04:00:38.650 --> 04:00:40.490]  These are ones I scored at the RegenCon
[04:00:40.490 --> 04:00:41.690]  and someone hooked me up.
[04:00:41.690 --> 04:00:42.850]  I can't remember, but.
[04:00:44.170 --> 04:00:47.250]  Yes, Chad, that's why he's stocking up now
[04:00:47.250 --> 04:00:49.170]  so he'll have something to talk about.
[04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:57.190]  You, you, Russell Garnett,
[04:00:57.190 --> 04:01:01.470]  you need to just get the PayPal or the Venmo or Cash App,
[04:01:01.470 --> 04:01:04.070]  which is right above your comment.
[04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:05.670]  And then you just send the money there.
[04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:08.630]  Once we have a receipt that the money is there,
[04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:10.110]  we send you the package.
[04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:14.990]  But I think his question is once he makes the payment,
[04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:16.950]  who should he get in touch with?
[04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:17.790]  Because.
[04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:23.830]  I'm gonna wait to hear from whoever Greenlight said
[04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:25.270]  it was paid and then I'll send it.
[04:01:25.270 --> 04:01:27.150]  So it'll go down the chain of command
[04:01:27.150 --> 04:01:27.990]  as long as everyone goes to RegenCon.
[04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:30.550]  Yeah, I don't know if he needs to get in touch with anyone.
[04:01:30.550 --> 04:01:33.550]  I think he just needs to trust that once he makes the payment
[04:01:33.550 --> 04:01:36.270]  that the mail will be sent.
[04:01:36.270 --> 04:01:37.230]  Yeah, I got you, man.
[04:01:37.230 --> 04:01:38.190]  I'll hold you down.
[04:01:38.190 --> 04:01:41.190]  I'm trying to keep a reputation as not being, you know,
[04:01:41.190 --> 04:01:43.310]  I'm trying to be a standup guy in this community
[04:01:43.310 --> 04:01:45.430]  so I ain't gonna fuck around.
[04:01:45.430 --> 04:01:46.270]  There you go.
[04:01:47.350 --> 04:01:49.630]  I think everybody is on this.
[04:01:49.630 --> 04:01:54.190]  And Russell, he's on Instagram as rotten skateboards.
[04:01:56.430 --> 04:01:58.870]  So this next one, I also wanted to say to everyone
[04:01:58.870 --> 04:02:00.230]  who even if they got a freebie,
[04:02:00.230 --> 04:02:03.630]  they're gonna get a gang of stickers of the Boneyard.
[04:02:03.630 --> 04:02:06.310]  This one, we got the Gourd.
[04:02:06.310 --> 04:02:08.670]  We got the Super Lemon Haze phone home.
[04:02:09.630 --> 04:02:12.070]  15 Corey Crush, that's the pure crush.
[04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:13.350]  Someone was talking about before.
[04:02:13.350 --> 04:02:15.350]  I'm not sure if they're still in here.
[04:02:15.390 --> 04:02:20.030]  15 Seeds, another banger of the Bob's Cheddar,
[04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:21.550]  another banger of the backpack.
[04:02:21.550 --> 04:02:25.430]  That's Dutch and Toad.
[04:02:26.310 --> 04:02:28.710]  We'll start at 20 bucks.
[04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:29.870]  Who's still awake here?
[04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:31.390]  $20, $20 bill.
[04:02:31.390 --> 04:02:33.350]  Support fucking Harry, let's go.
[04:02:33.350 --> 04:02:34.430]  Let's go, let's go.
[04:02:34.430 --> 04:02:35.390]  Support Harry.
[04:02:35.390 --> 04:02:38.870]  Anybody who won anything should reach out
[04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:43.670]  to Terpene Tasting Team with their address.
[04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:48.270]  And that's T-E-R-P-E-N-E, tasting team.
[04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:54.350]  And you can say what you won, how much the bid was,
[04:02:54.350 --> 04:02:57.110]  and if you don't, and your address.
[04:02:57.110 --> 04:03:00.070]  And then it will help everybody.
[04:03:00.070 --> 04:03:02.830]  Everybody here is here for community.
[04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:05.590]  Let's try and go the extra mile for everyone
[04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:07.790]  and make it easy on everybody.
[04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:09.870]  But yeah, that's how we will figure it out.
[04:03:09.870 --> 04:03:12.670]  And good point, first name, last name.
[04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:17.710]  Wayne Mustapha, we got 60, THC Garage, 60, tied at 60.
[04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:21.830]  So why don't you guys decide who's gonna be the tiebreaker
[04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:23.070]  and take it to 70.
[04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:29.830]  So that's, we got 43 seeds, I think,
[04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:34.070]  43 cannabis seeds, then you got some gourd seeds,
[04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:35.630]  and then you got some stickers.
[04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:37.350]  Let's do it.
[04:03:41.000 --> 04:03:43.440]  I'll throw in some goddamn Dutch seeds too.
[04:03:43.440 --> 04:03:48.120]  I got two bubblegum feminized free.
[04:03:48.120 --> 04:03:50.680]  I can't even remember what hokey Dutch company
[04:03:50.680 --> 04:03:53.080]  these are from, but some of the Amsterdam cats
[04:03:53.080 --> 04:03:54.520]  threw this one in something.
[04:03:55.800 --> 04:03:57.200]  Who knows what's going on with it?
[04:03:57.200 --> 04:03:58.040]  Let's go.
[04:03:58.040 --> 04:03:59.600]  You never know what you're gonna find.
[04:03:59.600 --> 04:04:01.200]  Could be the next big thing.
[04:04:04.430 --> 04:04:05.870]  Could be the next big thing.
[04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:08.670]  We've got 70 from Wayne Mustapha.
[04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:12.870]  Pickups Mustapha, been here all night.
[04:04:15.150 --> 04:04:19.510]  75 Green Valley, 80 Wayne Mustapha back.
[04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:20.950]  Shout out Wayne Mustapha.
[04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:25.070]  I think this one retails for a hundred.
[04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:26.470]  So do the math.
[04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:28.350]  There you go.
[04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:33.630]  80 is what we packed, you get how many packs, it's crazy.
[04:04:40.410 --> 04:04:42.730]  Get in there, Captain, throw up 85.
[04:04:44.250 --> 04:04:49.250]  Hey, Jameson, I got this three beans of this auto flower,
[04:04:49.770 --> 04:04:53.610]  the Ethos OG Kush, an R5.
[04:04:53.610 --> 04:04:56.250]  I'll never grow these auto flowers.
[04:04:56.250 --> 04:04:58.450]  I did grow two of them.
[04:04:58.450 --> 04:05:01.010]  I popped three.
[04:05:01.010 --> 04:05:03.410]  I soaked three or planted, I direct soaked,
[04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:05.930]  I direct soaked three, two came up.
[04:05:05.930 --> 04:05:09.130]  It was good Kush, but I'm just not into autos.
[04:05:10.370 --> 04:05:12.090]  Well, I'll just lay that on there.
[04:05:14.090 --> 04:05:18.690]  I'll ship it to, I'll even ship it,
[04:05:19.050 --> 04:05:20.050]  to whoever gets it.
[04:05:23.330 --> 04:05:27.050]  All right, so just to make it complicated for Adam,
[04:05:27.050 --> 04:05:29.810]  just Adam, make sure you know this one,
[04:05:29.810 --> 04:05:33.690]  there's two shippers on this and Cannabis Hills,
[04:05:33.690 --> 04:05:37.690]  shout out Cannabis Hills is gonna ship some autos
[04:05:37.690 --> 04:05:40.290]  to the individual who wins this one as well.
[04:05:40.290 --> 04:05:44.970]  So we got 85 from HR Inc.
[04:05:44.970 --> 04:05:46.330]  Thank you, HR.
[04:05:46.330 --> 04:05:48.170]  Thank you, Cannabis Hills.
[04:05:48.690 --> 04:05:49.530]  Appreciate you.
[04:05:53.400 --> 04:05:56.560]  All right, so come on, Mustafa.
[04:05:56.560 --> 04:05:58.440]  You're not stopping now.
[04:05:58.440 --> 04:06:00.480]  Too many packs.
[04:06:00.480 --> 04:06:02.080]  One pack is $100.
[04:06:02.080 --> 04:06:05.360]  You're still already still off of one pack.
[04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:11.180]  Might just have to sit here for a minute.
[04:06:11.180 --> 04:06:12.020]  It's all good.
[04:06:12.020 --> 04:06:14.380]  Someone's gotta get the late night deals.
[04:06:14.380 --> 04:06:17.860]  There you go, Mustafa, my motherfucking man.
[04:06:17.860 --> 04:06:19.820]  That's my man right there.
[04:06:20.700 --> 04:06:22.580]  Again, $90.
[04:06:22.580 --> 04:06:24.700]  And if anything you do, like I said,
[04:06:24.700 --> 04:06:26.180]  you buy a couple more than you need
[04:06:26.180 --> 04:06:27.900]  and then you got a seed pack or two
[04:06:27.900 --> 04:06:29.260]  to throw up for the next auction.
[04:06:29.260 --> 04:06:31.580]  Even if it brings in 20 bucks, 25 bucks,
[04:06:31.580 --> 04:06:34.260]  it'll be for a good cause and you're still coming up.
[04:06:34.260 --> 04:06:35.980]  You're still getting ahead.
[04:06:35.980 --> 04:06:38.780]  That's how we generate positive momentum.
[04:06:40.300 --> 04:06:41.140]  This is true.
[04:06:42.700 --> 04:06:43.540]  Excuse me.
[04:06:45.580 --> 04:06:47.620]  All right, we got $90.
[04:06:48.340 --> 04:06:49.780]  We got 30 seconds left.
[04:06:51.980 --> 04:06:54.060]  Nice, I'm stoked someone's getting a good deal.
[04:06:54.060 --> 04:06:56.260]  I bet the best one's gonna be in the Dutch.
[04:06:57.500 --> 04:06:59.100]  Oh yeah, the boat will go.
[04:07:01.700 --> 04:07:04.660]  HR coming back strong with $100.
[04:07:04.660 --> 04:07:05.500]  Nice.
[04:07:07.380 --> 04:07:08.500]  It's a good deal.
[04:07:08.500 --> 04:07:09.660]  What did we count it out to?
[04:07:09.660 --> 04:07:12.500]  43 seeds, something like that, 42 seeds?
[04:07:12.500 --> 04:07:14.460]  So many good deals, yeah.
[04:07:14.460 --> 04:07:15.940]  It's good, good deals.
[04:07:17.980 --> 04:07:19.380]  And you got some gourds.
[04:07:23.130 --> 04:07:26.610]  Some gourds to flush out your garden next year.
[04:07:27.570 --> 04:07:29.650]  Who do you hit up again, 110?
[04:07:30.610 --> 04:07:31.850]  Who do you hit up again?
[04:07:31.850 --> 04:07:33.810]  Go for it, Mustapha.
[04:07:33.810 --> 04:07:35.930]  Who do you hit up again, 110?
[04:07:35.930 --> 04:07:37.410]  I don't know what that means.
[04:07:37.410 --> 04:07:40.450]  Terpene testing team, if you win the bid.
[04:07:40.450 --> 04:07:41.730]  If you win the bid.
[04:07:44.610 --> 04:07:46.930]  Hit a dab up, it's dab time.
[04:07:46.930 --> 04:07:49.290]  Yeah, for sure, my brain.
[04:07:50.210 --> 04:07:51.970]  You gotta hit a dab.
[04:07:51.970 --> 04:07:55.010]  Peep game on the torch, it's got the dolly on it.
[04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:57.570]  Yo, that's cool.
[04:07:57.570 --> 04:07:59.930]  It blends pretty well with the color.
[04:07:59.930 --> 04:08:02.050]  I was like, damn, that looks really good.
[04:08:07.520 --> 04:08:08.360]  All right.
[04:08:09.480 --> 04:08:10.320]  120.
[04:08:12.000 --> 04:08:13.400]  HR.
[04:08:13.400 --> 04:08:16.560]  If you're trying to hit up to make payment,
[04:08:16.560 --> 04:08:21.440]  if you win, Mustapha, it's Terpene Testing Team on Insta.
[04:08:21.440 --> 04:08:23.560]  You're more than welcome to hit me up as well,
[04:08:24.440 --> 04:08:26.560]  but as long as he confirms payment and gets your address,
[04:08:26.560 --> 04:08:28.720]  you get your stuff for sure.
[04:08:28.720 --> 04:08:32.640]  Yeah, but in the chat, if you just scroll back
[04:08:32.640 --> 04:08:34.760]  a billion times we've posted.
[04:08:38.080 --> 04:08:39.600]  Like a straight billion.
[04:08:39.600 --> 04:08:42.360]  Like not a million, but a straight little B.
[04:08:43.520 --> 04:08:47.800]  So if you just scroll back, you can find the payment info.
[04:08:47.800 --> 04:08:50.800]  And then you take that info, you screenshot that,
[04:08:50.800 --> 04:08:54.440]  you show it to Terpene Testing Team on Instagram
[04:08:54.440 --> 04:08:58.760]  with your address, and then a week or two later,
[04:08:58.760 --> 04:09:01.560]  these beans just show up and you just get them wet
[04:09:01.560 --> 04:09:02.760]  and then blow them out.
[04:09:06.280 --> 04:09:09.840]  120, all right, so, so to HR.
[04:09:09.840 --> 04:09:12.640]  So to the man, HR.
[04:09:12.640 --> 04:09:14.760]  You get these beans, Doug.
[04:09:14.760 --> 04:09:16.080]  Pick them and run.
[04:09:16.080 --> 04:09:18.280]  And you get the autos with them.
[04:09:18.280 --> 04:09:19.440]  That's a good score.
[04:09:19.480 --> 04:09:22.440]  And I challenge you to re-auction at least one of them,
[04:09:22.440 --> 04:09:24.160]  even if it's the gourds.
[04:09:24.160 --> 04:09:29.160]  All right, so Adam, please make note that this is a double.
[04:09:30.200 --> 04:09:32.640]  So this is the only one that you'll have to follow up
[04:09:32.640 --> 04:09:35.200]  with two people for shipping instead of one,
[04:09:36.600 --> 04:09:38.800]  which is fine, you just make a note of it.
[04:09:40.480 --> 04:09:44.000]  Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.
[04:09:45.800 --> 04:09:46.640]  So.
[04:09:49.560 --> 04:09:51.080]  Thank you, so much.
[04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:03.170]  Mic check.
[04:10:11.620 --> 04:10:14.500]  Kill your phone.
[04:10:15.900 --> 04:10:16.740]  I just did, okay.
[04:10:16.740 --> 04:10:17.780]  All right, I'm back.
[04:10:17.780 --> 04:10:19.060]  Yep.
[04:10:19.060 --> 04:10:19.900]  Mic check.
[04:10:19.900 --> 04:10:22.700]  So next up, whoever we got in here still,
[04:10:22.700 --> 04:10:25.820]  late night, late night come ups, 98 people.
[04:10:25.820 --> 04:10:28.260]  So I reached out to the big homie, Piff Coast,
[04:10:28.260 --> 04:10:29.980]  who I give much, much respect to
[04:10:29.980 --> 04:10:32.660]  for changing the game here on the East Coast
[04:10:32.660 --> 04:10:34.100]  and definitely changing my game.
[04:10:34.100 --> 04:10:37.900]  I mean, fuck, big ups, big ups.
[04:10:37.900 --> 04:10:41.380]  And he said he'll donate any pack he's got on here.
[04:10:41.380 --> 04:10:43.900]  You can go to his website real quick.
[04:10:43.900 --> 04:10:47.340]  I think I can click around if I'm on the site.
[04:10:49.300 --> 04:10:52.100]  And yeah, we'll start it at 20 bucks.
[04:10:54.140 --> 04:10:58.220]  The Holy Communion has had some success washing.
[04:10:59.060 --> 04:11:00.220]  Trying to get the Piff Terps
[04:11:00.220 --> 04:11:02.660]  is definitely like a unicorn chase.
[04:11:02.660 --> 04:11:05.140]  I'm going through about 40 seeds myself right now,
[04:11:05.140 --> 04:11:06.500]  looking for just that.
[04:11:11.620 --> 04:11:16.060]  Sour Glue, Audubon Perp, the Poudre.
[04:11:16.060 --> 04:11:18.540]  Not sure how many people in here are from the Tri-State
[04:11:18.540 --> 04:11:22.640]  or the East Coast, but the Piff is something special.
[04:11:24.460 --> 04:11:26.340]  Took them about two seconds to be like,
[04:11:26.340 --> 04:11:27.860]  yep, I'll support.
[04:11:28.500 --> 04:11:31.540]  I've smoked the Holy Communion and it's-
[04:11:31.540 --> 04:11:32.860]  You want to mute, Jameson?
[04:11:37.580 --> 04:11:38.580]  No, I can hear him.
[04:11:39.820 --> 04:11:41.100]  I know, now you're muted.
[04:11:41.100 --> 04:11:42.540]  Oh, I thought he asked me to mute.
[04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:46.500]  I've smoked the Holy Communion and it's incredible.
[04:11:47.700 --> 04:11:50.260]  And Piff Coast is doing incredible work.
[04:11:50.260 --> 04:11:52.980]  So these packs are fire.
[04:11:54.100 --> 04:11:56.260]  And shout out to them for supporting Harry.
[04:12:00.150 --> 04:12:02.830]  And I'm not sure if we started a timer,
[04:12:03.190 --> 04:12:06.830]  but we'll send it for a couple minutes.
[04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:14.910]  I think my audio was just off before.
[04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:16.510]  Was I just screaming over people?
[04:12:21.980 --> 04:12:24.100]  Yeah, like someone else was saying before,
[04:12:24.100 --> 04:12:29.100]  I think it was before Six Star, the Ranch.
[04:12:30.260 --> 04:12:31.380]  You want something different?
[04:12:31.380 --> 04:12:32.740]  You want something to stand out?
[04:12:32.740 --> 04:12:34.740]  You want something that not everyone else has?
[04:12:34.740 --> 04:12:37.100]  Find a winner out of here and watch people be like,
[04:12:37.100 --> 04:12:38.580]  yo, when's that going to be done again?
[04:12:38.580 --> 04:12:40.580]  Or watch you just be on the edge of your seat
[04:12:40.580 --> 04:12:43.900]  waiting for your next harvest if it's for your own stash.
[04:12:53.260 --> 04:12:54.420]  And he was going to come on,
[04:12:54.420 --> 04:12:56.620]  but I don't think he got home until super late.
[04:12:56.620 --> 04:12:58.380]  So he told me to just hold it down.
[04:13:00.140 --> 04:13:01.740]  Pazio with 100.
[04:13:03.220 --> 04:13:04.660]  We got one minute left.
[04:13:07.180 --> 04:13:09.700]  Pazio Grone, appreciate you.
[04:13:12.930 --> 04:13:15.010]  And don't forget it's for Harry.
[04:13:15.010 --> 04:13:17.970]  You know, even if it's close to face value,
[04:13:17.970 --> 04:13:20.930]  you're supporting Harry, you're also supporting PIVCOAST,
[04:13:20.930 --> 04:13:22.290]  which has been putting in work.
[04:13:22.290 --> 04:13:26.090]  And like, you know, like a lot of us coming up super broke
[04:13:26.090 --> 04:13:28.730]  and not from like, you know, like making it work.
[04:13:28.730 --> 04:13:30.730]  So it's like, it's good to support all these cats.
[04:13:30.730 --> 04:13:33.730]  You know, it's like, let's get the momentum.
[04:13:36.560 --> 04:13:37.760]  Yeah, man.
[04:13:37.760 --> 04:13:40.280]  Both of those cats have had a super positive impact
[04:13:40.280 --> 04:13:41.960]  on my like cannabis life.
[04:13:41.960 --> 04:13:42.840]  So that's for sure.
[04:13:43.360 --> 04:13:45.440]  You know, I'm definitely giving it up for them.
[04:13:46.800 --> 04:13:48.680]  The best weed is when it starts,
[04:13:48.680 --> 04:13:50.240]  when it's grown from love, man.
[04:13:53.480 --> 04:13:55.520]  One pack, Randy, one pack.
[04:13:57.360 --> 04:13:58.200]  Yeah.
[04:13:59.600 --> 04:14:01.640]  I think he wanted me to kind of just pick one out
[04:14:01.640 --> 04:14:03.400]  and just throw it up, but I figured it'd be funner
[04:14:03.400 --> 04:14:05.000]  so someone could pick their own.
[04:14:06.040 --> 04:14:07.760]  And don't just pick the most expensive one,
[04:14:07.760 --> 04:14:09.560]  pick the one that you want the most.
[04:14:10.000 --> 04:14:10.840]  That's it.
[04:14:10.840 --> 04:14:11.840]  There we go.
[04:14:13.240 --> 04:14:14.520]  All right, I got some more stuff.
[04:14:14.520 --> 04:14:21.800]  Are you there, Peter?
[04:14:23.040 --> 04:14:24.200]  Yeah.
[04:14:24.200 --> 04:14:26.440]  Could I text you some images
[04:14:26.440 --> 04:14:27.760]  and you can get them up real quick?
[04:14:27.760 --> 04:14:30.160]  I don't think I'd be confident enough to do it.
[04:14:30.160 --> 04:14:31.360]  Sure.
[04:14:31.360 --> 04:14:32.520]  Okay, give me one sec.
[04:14:34.080 --> 04:14:36.920]  And then after that, I may or may not go to bed.
[04:14:39.920 --> 04:15:05.450]  All right, so these next ones are gonna be
[04:15:05.570 --> 04:15:08.890]  coming from some younger cats up here in Maine.
[04:15:08.890 --> 04:15:11.250]  They go by Fractal Cannabis.
[04:15:11.250 --> 04:15:16.250]  And we all have different views from where I'm standing.
[04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:18.650]  These are young cats coming up really correct
[04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:21.370]  in the cannabis business, industry, community,
[04:15:21.370 --> 04:15:22.810]  whatever you wanna call it, the culture.
[04:15:22.810 --> 04:15:25.650]  They're coming real correct and they're like mid-20s.
[04:15:25.650 --> 04:15:28.490]  So I'm giving big props to these cats.
[04:15:28.490 --> 04:15:32.810]  Adam Paisy Grown did win the last one for 100, yeah.
[04:15:32.890 --> 04:15:35.170]  Did that first one go through, Peter?
[04:15:35.170 --> 04:15:45.660]  Yeah, I like that one so far.
[04:15:47.580 --> 04:15:48.420]  All right.
[04:15:50.260 --> 04:16:01.580]  So I can see we got at least, we got one from Top Dog.
[04:16:02.980 --> 04:16:07.980]  HP21F2, looking like 12 regular seeds
[04:16:07.980 --> 04:16:11.940]  of the Jane Doe Kush across with the UWBX2.
[04:16:12.100 --> 04:16:14.900]  Top Dog's always good, something to go through.
[04:16:16.500 --> 04:16:18.100]  Katsu Seeds.
[04:16:20.300 --> 04:16:21.540]  Dracor Nor.
[04:16:22.620 --> 04:16:27.620]  Dracories No. 5, the Rev Funk Cut across with Hot Cakes.
[04:16:28.500 --> 04:16:30.540]  Looks like 10 regular seeds there.
[04:16:33.820 --> 04:16:35.820]  From Dungeon Vault Genetics.
[04:16:35.820 --> 04:16:37.620]  I'm gonna give a big props to the guys
[04:16:38.140 --> 04:16:40.340]  from Dungeon Vault Genetics.
[04:16:40.340 --> 04:16:42.220]  There's some Dutch Oven.
[04:16:42.220 --> 04:16:44.620]  That's the Dutch Tree across with the Hot Rod.
[04:16:56.620 --> 04:16:58.060]  I think that's about the short and skinny of it.
[04:16:58.060 --> 04:16:59.860]  You got the images, Peter?
[04:16:59.860 --> 04:17:04.380]  Yeah, I'm just trying to find them in my downloads.
[04:17:06.060 --> 04:17:15.010]  So one of them is Green Bodhi.
[04:17:15.010 --> 04:17:19.370]  That's Loation Landrace across with the Agla 78 Affie.
[04:17:20.290 --> 04:17:23.570]  The other one's from Katsu, that's the Dracor Nor.
[04:17:24.970 --> 04:17:27.850]  And the other one's from Dungeon Vault, that's Dutch Oven.
[04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:33.890]  And no, not Fractal Genetics.
[04:17:33.890 --> 04:17:35.930]  It's Fractal with a K.
[04:17:35.930 --> 04:17:39.010]  And I think it might even just be Fractal,
[04:17:39.010 --> 04:17:40.850]  but they're doing all sorts of stuff up here.
[04:17:40.850 --> 04:17:44.050]  They have a delivery service, they have a grow.
[04:17:44.050 --> 04:17:45.930]  They're at every event.
[04:17:45.930 --> 04:17:47.450]  They're always bringing positivity.
[04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:49.490]  They're working hard and they cook like crazy.
[04:17:49.490 --> 04:17:52.290]  They do this little skit every night on their stories
[04:17:52.290 --> 04:17:54.490]  where they act like their dinner is like
[04:17:54.490 --> 04:17:56.530]  they're assessing a batch of hash
[04:17:56.530 --> 04:17:59.010]  or how flour is drying.
[04:17:59.010 --> 04:18:00.930]  They'd be like, what was the cure time
[04:18:00.930 --> 04:18:02.570]  on that pizza dough there?
[04:18:02.570 --> 04:18:03.890]  And they start grilling each other
[04:18:03.890 --> 04:18:04.890]  like they're in a session,
[04:18:04.890 --> 04:18:06.290]  but it's about dinner every night.
[04:18:06.290 --> 04:18:08.170]  I love the theme they got going on.
[04:18:09.410 --> 04:18:11.930]  And yeah, they're coming super correct
[04:18:11.930 --> 04:18:13.050]  from my point of view.
[04:18:13.170 --> 04:18:14.690]  Yeah, they're coming super correct
[04:18:14.690 --> 04:18:15.810]  from my point of view.
[04:18:19.230 --> 04:18:21.030]  I guess we'll start it off at 20 bucks.
[04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:22.110]  It's late night.
[04:18:22.110 --> 04:18:24.670]  Who's gonna score a whole bunch of packs for cheap?
[04:18:26.270 --> 04:18:27.870]  20 bucks.
[04:18:27.870 --> 04:18:28.710]  Well, we'll start there.
[04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:29.870]  We'll see where it goes.
[04:18:34.390 --> 04:18:37.590]  Okay, I'll have the images ready in a minute.
[04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:40.350]  The Laotian Landry's full mouth is pink
[04:18:40.350 --> 04:18:41.710]  like pencil eraser.
[04:18:46.660 --> 04:18:49.580]  There you go, Wayne Mustapha, bro.
[04:18:49.620 --> 04:18:52.820]  Putting this thing on your back, bro.
[04:18:52.820 --> 04:18:53.660]  Let's go.
[04:18:53.660 --> 04:18:55.300]  You are getting some smoke show deals though,
[04:18:55.300 --> 04:18:58.020]  so I'm not gonna give you too much credit.
[04:18:58.020 --> 04:18:59.060]  But I appreciate you.
[04:19:05.730 --> 04:19:07.850]  Wayne Mustapha with the 80.
[04:19:09.850 --> 04:19:13.050]  Rodney with the banged up hands from skating.
[04:19:13.050 --> 04:19:18.050]  No, I was watching Rodney Mullins' Day One song today.
[04:19:20.050 --> 04:19:22.610]  The original one or the number two?
[04:19:22.610 --> 04:19:23.810]  The original.
[04:19:23.850 --> 04:19:24.690]  That's funny.
[04:19:24.690 --> 04:19:27.050]  That's one of the first skate videos I ever saw.
[04:19:27.050 --> 04:19:28.050]  That's wild.
[04:19:29.090 --> 04:19:31.730]  I just put it on because I felt like watching it.
[04:19:33.970 --> 04:19:35.090]  I was counting seats,
[04:19:35.090 --> 04:19:37.650]  so I had to pay attention a little bit,
[04:19:37.650 --> 04:19:39.810]  but I wanted to watch something.
[04:19:39.810 --> 04:19:43.170]  I didn't want to just watch skis swirl around.
[04:19:43.170 --> 04:19:44.650]  And that's what I watched.
[04:19:45.770 --> 04:19:46.650]  That's fire.
[04:19:52.100 --> 04:19:54.020]  All right, 9UChubbyMonkey.
[04:19:55.420 --> 04:19:57.060]  What do we got on the block?
[04:19:58.060 --> 04:20:00.140]  Peter's still getting the images up,
[04:20:00.140 --> 04:20:03.420]  and I don't even think like we started the timer yet,
[04:20:03.420 --> 04:20:05.660]  but I figure we start at 20 just in case.
[04:20:10.100 --> 04:20:11.780]  So these are the Katsu.
[04:20:11.780 --> 04:20:13.940]  I guess we can start the timer now if we're showing it.
[04:20:13.940 --> 04:20:17.660]  This is the Katsu Drakor Nor.
[04:20:17.660 --> 04:20:21.260]  That's Dracary's number five across with Hotcakes.
[04:20:21.260 --> 04:20:23.860]  I have absolutely no idea what's going on with that.
[04:20:24.140 --> 04:20:26.660]  We got a minute 50 on the block.
[04:20:26.660 --> 04:20:28.020]  Nice milers though.
[04:20:28.020 --> 04:20:30.340]  Dungeon Vault is the Dutch oven,
[04:20:30.340 --> 04:20:33.500]  is the Dutch treat crossed with the hot rod.
[04:20:33.500 --> 04:20:35.820]  There was a Dutch treat going around Oakland for a while
[04:20:35.820 --> 04:20:38.220]  that was like a super medicinal smoke,
[04:20:38.220 --> 04:20:40.900]  and it was still a good buzz.
[04:20:40.900 --> 04:20:43.060]  Jordan of the Islands.
[04:20:43.060 --> 04:20:45.380]  That's a $200 pack right there.
[04:20:45.380 --> 04:20:48.540]  That Green Bodhi pack is easy 250.
[04:20:48.540 --> 04:20:49.660]  For real?
[04:20:49.660 --> 04:20:50.500]  Yeah, bro.
[04:20:50.620 --> 04:20:51.940]  What Green Bodhi pack is that?
[04:20:51.940 --> 04:20:52.780]  Is that a freebie?
[04:20:52.780 --> 04:20:55.140]  Is that a full pack of beans?
[04:20:55.140 --> 04:21:00.140]  Laotian Landrace crossed with Agala 78 Afi.
[04:21:00.140 --> 04:21:00.980]  Good lord.
[04:21:03.260 --> 04:21:04.260]  Yeah, don't sleep on it.
[04:21:04.260 --> 04:21:05.340]  If it goes for too cheap,
[04:21:05.340 --> 04:21:07.860]  I'll just bid it up myself and just buy it and keep them
[04:21:07.860 --> 04:21:09.260]  because the homie became correct
[04:21:09.260 --> 04:21:10.300]  that he's coming like that.
[04:21:10.300 --> 04:21:12.100]  Top Dog is definitely a good genetic.
[04:21:13.180 --> 04:21:15.500]  This homie came fucking correct.
[04:21:15.500 --> 04:21:17.340]  Top Dog, all this stuff.
[04:21:17.380 --> 04:21:19.300]  This homie came fucking correct.
[04:21:19.300 --> 04:21:22.500]  Top Dog, all this stuff is fire.
[04:21:22.500 --> 04:21:25.700]  What I'm saying, the way we met was so fire too.
[04:21:25.700 --> 04:21:28.620]  We were at a cannabis event and they had a piece of prosciutto.
[04:21:28.620 --> 04:21:30.700]  It was like a whole half of a pig.
[04:21:30.700 --> 04:21:32.700]  And I just walked up and just grabbed a slice
[04:21:32.700 --> 04:21:34.100]  and we just started chopping it up.
[04:21:34.100 --> 04:21:36.140]  It was fucking game on from there.
[04:21:36.140 --> 04:21:37.860]  We've been getting it.
[04:21:37.860 --> 04:21:40.060]  Yo, the Katsu stuff.
[04:21:40.060 --> 04:21:42.620]  Katsu is like an OG breeder.
[04:21:42.620 --> 04:21:43.460]  He's been doing it,
[04:21:43.460 --> 04:21:47.340]  working with heirloom varietals for like decades.
[04:21:48.900 --> 04:21:51.300]  He's worked with all the top dudes
[04:21:51.300 --> 04:21:52.900]  and he has his own thing.
[04:21:54.740 --> 04:21:57.260]  That Top Dog pack is a winner, Dave's not there.
[04:21:57.260 --> 04:22:00.180]  And then also the Dutch oven,
[04:22:01.820 --> 04:22:06.220]  that Dutch oven has got a lot of winning turps in it.
[04:22:06.220 --> 04:22:07.060]  These are gas.
[04:22:07.060 --> 04:22:09.500]  This is fire.
[04:22:09.500 --> 04:22:12.100]  Wayne Mustapha with 210.
[04:22:12.100 --> 04:22:13.900]  That's the Top Dog pack.
[04:22:13.900 --> 04:22:15.340]  Yeah, you already know.
[04:22:15.340 --> 04:22:16.780]  Just the Top Dog pack.
[04:22:18.820 --> 04:22:19.660]  Which is still cool.
[04:22:19.660 --> 04:22:21.580]  It's cool to get some good deals in these auctions,
[04:22:21.580 --> 04:22:23.380]  but don't forget we're supporting Harry Rose.
[04:22:23.380 --> 04:22:24.220]  I know it's late night.
[04:22:24.220 --> 04:22:25.860]  We're all getting a little loopy,
[04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:27.740]  but don't forget what's going on here.
[04:22:27.740 --> 04:22:29.180]  This dude's probably still up working
[04:22:29.180 --> 04:22:32.020]  or up thinking about what work has to be done tomorrow.
[04:22:33.020 --> 04:22:36.340]  Put another two minutes on just because.
[04:22:36.340 --> 04:22:37.420]  That's a lot of heat.
[04:22:40.700 --> 04:22:41.740]  I didn't realize that.
[04:22:42.260 --> 04:22:44.260]  That's how correct these young homies are coming.
[04:22:44.260 --> 04:22:45.780]  They didn't even take two seconds
[04:22:45.780 --> 04:22:46.940]  till they're like, yep, I got you.
[04:22:46.940 --> 04:22:49.260]  Let me get home and send you the pics.
[04:22:49.260 --> 04:22:50.500]  Yeah, no, green.
[04:22:50.500 --> 04:22:52.540]  Those three packs are hot, hot heat.
[04:22:52.540 --> 04:22:54.520]  That's $600 all day long.
[04:23:00.770 --> 04:23:02.490]  250, Brian, 420.
[04:23:02.490 --> 04:23:03.770]  No, it's more than 600.
[04:23:03.770 --> 04:23:05.490]  My bad, I forgot about those.
[04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:08.930]  $300 all day long.
[04:23:12.920 --> 04:23:15.020]  Yeah, don't sleep, everyone.
[04:23:15.380 --> 04:23:17.100]  You can think about it any which way you want.
[04:23:17.100 --> 04:23:18.700]  You wanna be a shrewd businessman,
[04:23:18.700 --> 04:23:21.220]  resell some of them and get a couple for free.
[04:23:21.220 --> 04:23:22.620]  You wanna be a humanitarian,
[04:23:22.620 --> 04:23:24.900]  re-donate some to another cause.
[04:23:24.900 --> 04:23:26.700]  You wanna find some dank pop them all.
[04:23:26.700 --> 04:23:29.380]  The value's there no matter what way you look at it.
[04:23:29.380 --> 04:23:30.440]  And these homies are down.
[04:23:30.440 --> 04:23:32.500]  I think they're going through 700 different seeds
[04:23:32.500 --> 04:23:34.420]  right now doing the Fino hunt.
[04:23:36.180 --> 04:23:37.600]  They got packs for days.
[04:23:39.220 --> 04:23:40.660]  Chubby Monkey with 270.
[04:23:40.660 --> 04:23:42.700]  I see you, Chubby Monkey.
[04:23:42.700 --> 04:23:43.540]  Let's go.
[04:23:48.360 --> 04:23:50.360]  If this gets up to 400 too,
[04:23:50.360 --> 04:23:53.400]  I'll throw in a skateboard if anyone cares,
[04:23:53.400 --> 04:23:54.600]  or would appreciate that,
[04:23:54.600 --> 04:23:56.360]  or I'll throw in some hoodies,
[04:23:56.360 --> 04:23:59.260]  or some t-shirts or whatever, some rotten gear.
[04:23:59.260 --> 04:24:00.320]  But let's try to run it up.
[04:24:00.320 --> 04:24:02.320]  If these guys did donate something good,
[04:24:03.280 --> 04:24:06.640]  let's show them the due respect, show Harry their respect.
[04:24:06.640 --> 04:24:08.000]  Peter's been up all night.
[04:24:08.000 --> 04:24:09.800]  He ain't getting paid for this shit.
[04:24:12.000 --> 04:24:16.080]  You got two packs of Katsu gear.
[04:24:16.080 --> 04:24:18.360]  If you look up Katsu,
[04:24:18.360 --> 04:24:21.960]  that dude's been around since, I believe, the 70s,
[04:24:22.920 --> 04:24:24.280]  doing work with this plant.
[04:24:25.200 --> 04:24:27.240]  And then you get,
[04:24:28.200 --> 04:24:29.400]  we're gonna stop that.
[04:24:30.560 --> 04:24:34.600]  And then you get the Dutch oven that has the gas.
[04:24:34.600 --> 04:24:36.000]  Dave knows what's up.
[04:24:37.560 --> 04:24:39.400]  Rotten's got it at 300.
[04:24:39.400 --> 04:24:40.880]  See, Rotten sees it.
[04:24:40.880 --> 04:24:41.720]  Randy got me.
[04:24:41.720 --> 04:24:43.760]  Like I was saying, I'm not gonna let my homie go out like that.
[04:24:43.760 --> 04:24:45.420]  I'll just pop them and then give them the cuts
[04:24:45.760 --> 04:24:46.600]  and then I'll give the winners back.
[04:24:46.600 --> 04:24:47.740]  I'll be all stoked.
[04:24:47.740 --> 04:24:50.900]  No, seriously, because you've got Katsu.
[04:24:50.900 --> 04:24:51.740]  That's the right thing.
[04:24:51.740 --> 04:24:52.660]  You've got Katsu.
[04:24:52.660 --> 04:24:57.620]  You've got the gases with the dungeon vault.
[04:24:57.620 --> 04:25:01.580]  And then you've got, yeah,
[04:25:05.500 --> 04:25:06.980]  the 320 Wayne Mustapha.
[04:25:06.980 --> 04:25:07.820]  There you go.
[04:25:07.820 --> 04:25:09.380]  I like to see it about 300.
[04:25:11.060 --> 04:25:12.300]  Get it up to 400.
[04:25:12.300 --> 04:25:14.620]  Get yourself a hoodie, skateboard.
[04:25:14.660 --> 04:25:15.620]  Get whatever you want.
[04:25:15.620 --> 04:25:17.780]  Let's run the money up for the big homies.
[04:25:17.780 --> 04:25:19.580]  Don't forget to support Daga.
[04:25:22.250 --> 04:25:24.410]  Support all that fucking shit that matters.
[04:25:28.390 --> 04:25:29.590]  All right.
[04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:34.590]  Well, I think we're gonna slow it down.
[04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:37.550]  We're gonna final call here.
[04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:42.110]  This is Wayne Mustapha.
[04:25:43.470 --> 04:25:45.330]  Congratulations, my man.
[04:25:46.330 --> 04:25:48.170]  That might be the steal of the night.
[04:25:53.770 --> 04:25:55.970]  You did good there.
[04:25:55.970 --> 04:25:59.650]  You can sleep well tonight, my friend.
[04:25:59.650 --> 04:26:01.050]  Very well tonight.
[04:26:03.330 --> 04:26:07.090]  But yeah, man, I think that's awesome.
[04:26:07.090 --> 04:26:12.090]  I think that everybody showed up.
[04:26:13.410 --> 04:26:14.530]  That was very cool.
[04:26:17.680 --> 04:26:21.040]  Do you have anything else you wanna put forward, Rotten?
[04:26:21.040 --> 04:26:25.080]  Because I don't think I have much more myself.
[04:26:25.080 --> 04:26:27.480]  And I think I got through the list to everyone
[04:26:27.480 --> 04:26:30.600]  that was supposed to come on.
[04:26:30.600 --> 04:26:32.960]  So yeah, I think just about dab time.
[04:26:32.960 --> 04:26:35.120]  I'll get back to lugging some water.
[04:26:35.120 --> 04:26:36.080]  Yeah, man.
[04:26:36.080 --> 04:26:36.920]  Wow.
[04:26:36.920 --> 04:26:38.360]  I appreciate CannavaSills.
[04:26:38.360 --> 04:26:40.000]  You rocked with us the whole time, man.
[04:26:40.000 --> 04:26:41.100]  I appreciate you.
[04:26:42.600 --> 04:26:44.600]  I appreciate everybody in the chat.
[04:26:44.600 --> 04:26:48.200]  Everybody, Peter for letting us use Future Cannabis.
[04:26:48.200 --> 04:26:49.040]  That's really cool.
[04:26:49.040 --> 04:26:50.360]  That's really big of you.
[04:26:52.080 --> 04:26:55.480]  And yeah, I hope everyone here follows Peter.
[04:26:55.480 --> 04:27:00.280]  I mean, also follows Peter, but follows Harry.
[04:27:01.440 --> 04:27:06.200]  Even if you didn't bid, even if you didn't do anything,
[04:27:06.200 --> 04:27:07.640]  Harry doesn't care.
[04:27:07.640 --> 04:27:09.420]  Harry just wants to educate.
[04:27:09.420 --> 04:27:13.560]  And so if you ever have a question about cannabis
[04:27:13.560 --> 04:27:17.640]  and how it would help, or a family member gets sick
[04:27:17.640 --> 04:27:19.360]  and you have a question,
[04:27:19.360 --> 04:27:21.800]  Harry's that right person to go to.
[04:27:21.800 --> 04:27:26.000]  And Harry will take time out of his day, just stop.
[04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:27.480]  And he will take time out of his day
[04:27:27.480 --> 04:27:29.780]  to help you and talk to you.
[04:27:29.780 --> 04:27:33.400]  And so I just hope everybody who ever sees this,
[04:27:33.400 --> 04:27:36.360]  if they can just do one thing, it's follow Harry Rose.
[04:27:36.360 --> 04:27:39.800]  I mean, that guy should have 27,000 followers minimum.
[04:27:41.400 --> 04:27:43.160]  And he doesn't right yet.
[04:27:44.000 --> 04:27:47.560]  So I hope we can all help get them there.
[04:27:47.560 --> 04:27:51.000]  But there's niches in cannabis that aren't for everybody,
[04:27:51.000 --> 04:27:54.120]  but Harry's for the people, Harry's for everybody.
[04:27:54.120 --> 04:27:56.120]  Harry's for medical access.
[04:27:56.120 --> 04:27:59.440]  Big up Harry, big up everybody who is in here.
[04:27:59.440 --> 04:28:02.120]  Huge shout out to everybody who put money down, man.
[04:28:02.120 --> 04:28:04.160]  That's really walking your talk.
[04:28:06.040 --> 04:28:07.920]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[04:28:07.920 --> 04:28:09.420]  Yeah, no problem.
[04:28:10.520 --> 04:28:12.560]  And yeah, so out of-
[04:28:12.880 --> 04:28:15.040]  I'm hoping to continue the conversations with Harry
[04:28:15.040 --> 04:28:17.120]  here on Future Cannabis Project as well,
[04:28:17.120 --> 04:28:20.560]  so we can have more ears open to broadcast too.
[04:28:21.560 --> 04:28:26.560]  And so if everybody here is a man of their word
[04:28:27.020 --> 04:28:29.660]  and pays what they say they paid,
[04:28:31.320 --> 04:28:33.880]  Adam, AKA Terrapin Tasting Team,
[04:28:33.880 --> 04:28:36.120]  the man behind the curtain that's making this all happen,
[04:28:36.120 --> 04:28:39.080]  just let me know that we raised Harry
[04:28:39.080 --> 04:28:40.960]  just over $10,000 tonight.
[04:28:40.960 --> 04:28:42.840]  And that's what I tried to wanted to do.
[04:28:42.840 --> 04:28:46.400]  So I'm fucking pumped about that.
[04:28:46.400 --> 04:28:48.880]  Big shout out to everybody.
[04:28:48.880 --> 04:28:52.020]  Big shout out to Harry and all the work that he did
[04:28:52.020 --> 04:28:53.680]  and continues to do.
[04:28:53.680 --> 04:28:54.620]  And thank you guys,
[04:28:54.620 --> 04:28:56.640]  because that's exactly what I wanted to do.
[04:28:56.640 --> 04:28:58.040]  I wanted to raise Harry 10K.
[04:28:58.040 --> 04:29:01.480]  So that's dope that we can come together
[04:29:01.480 --> 04:29:02.560]  as a community and do that.
[04:29:02.560 --> 04:29:04.740]  That makes me fucking so stoked.
[04:29:04.740 --> 04:29:08.960]  So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, everybody.
[04:29:09.960 --> 04:29:13.480]  Yeah, thank you, thank you, everyone.
[04:29:13.480 --> 04:29:15.000]  One last thing I wanna say too,
[04:29:15.000 --> 04:29:18.560]  we'll be doing another fundraiser in a couple of weeks
[04:29:18.560 --> 04:29:21.600]  to help someone in the community get a new wheelchair.
[04:29:21.600 --> 04:29:23.800]  And that should be exciting too.
[04:29:23.800 --> 04:29:25.720]  There should be a ton of good stuff up there.
[04:29:25.720 --> 04:29:27.720]  And hopefully we bring the good vibes
[04:29:27.720 --> 04:29:31.580]  and get someone who deserves a new chair rolling proper.
[04:29:33.960 --> 04:29:35.440]  Keep on the lookout for that.
[04:29:36.440 --> 04:29:38.480]  Dope, we definitely will.
[04:29:38.480 --> 04:29:40.000]  I think I know who that is.
[04:29:40.000 --> 04:29:41.420]  I'll be there.
[04:29:41.420 --> 04:29:42.680]  We'll all be there.
[04:29:42.680 --> 04:29:43.600]  Just let me know.
[04:29:44.720 --> 04:29:45.560]  Oh yeah.
[04:29:46.400 --> 04:29:47.240]  Yeah, we kind of got to keep it.
[04:29:47.240 --> 04:29:49.200]  It's like, if you know, you know,
[04:29:49.200 --> 04:29:50.880]  just for like whatever purposes,
[04:29:50.880 --> 04:29:53.520]  we can't really like broadcast like who it's for too much.
[04:29:53.520 --> 04:29:54.880]  But you know, if you know, you know,
[04:29:54.880 --> 04:29:57.520]  we're gonna come correct for the big homie.
[04:29:57.520 --> 04:29:59.080]  Awesome, all right.
[04:29:59.080 --> 04:30:01.200]  Well, I appreciate everybody.
[04:30:01.200 --> 04:30:02.760]  I'm gonna jump off.
[04:30:02.760 --> 04:30:04.360]  I'm like a little bit zonked,
[04:30:04.360 --> 04:30:05.760]  but I'm so stoked.
[04:30:07.000 --> 04:30:08.040]  Yo Adam, thank you.
[04:30:08.040 --> 04:30:09.680]  You are the true champion behind this.
[04:30:09.680 --> 04:30:12.160]  Everybody give Terpy a taste of it.
[04:30:12.160 --> 04:30:13.400]  He's a true unsung hero.
[04:30:13.400 --> 04:30:14.400]  He's coming up.
[04:30:14.400 --> 04:30:17.400]  And in 10 years, everybody's gonna know that dude's name.
[04:30:17.400 --> 04:30:19.760]  So I'm calling it right now.
[04:30:19.760 --> 04:30:21.320]  Peace and love everybody.
[04:30:21.320 --> 04:30:22.760]  Cheers.
