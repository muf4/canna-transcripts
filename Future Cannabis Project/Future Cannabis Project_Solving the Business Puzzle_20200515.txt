[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  Welcome, Solving the Business Puzzle.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.800]  Our guests today are Sam Edwards and Bam.
[00:07.240 --> 00:08.720]  That is me.
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.680]  And my name is Peter Saveri, Future Cannabis Project.
[00:12.680 --> 00:17.100]  We have Eric Branstad and Tom Himes on the show as well.
[00:17.100 --> 00:22.100]  So I think the concept here is I'd love to have people
[00:25.160 --> 00:27.040]  and you guys are our guinea pigs
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.160]  who are in the cultivation game
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.480]  kind of telling their war stories, warts and all
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.440]  of their business journey to where you are today,
[00:39.440 --> 00:42.060]  how you got here, the pivots you made,
[00:42.960 --> 00:45.180]  the shit that hit the fan moments,
[00:45.180 --> 00:48.760]  the opportunities you didn't expect that you jumped on
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.700]  and that paid off, and then kind of your vision
[00:51.700 --> 00:55.240]  and strategy for the puzzle you see
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.040]  that you're solving going forward in your own business.
[00:59.040 --> 01:01.960]  So why don't we kick it off with Sam
[01:01.960 --> 01:03.480]  and we'll give you the floor.
[01:06.040 --> 01:10.120]  Well, I'm pretty honored to be here with Eric and Bam
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.720]  and it's my first time meeting you, Tom,
[01:11.720 --> 01:12.960]  but I'm looking forward to hearing
[01:12.960 --> 01:14.400]  what you have to say as well.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.680]  Yeah, so I started in cannabis like 12 years ago,
[01:19.680 --> 01:22.080]  dorm room in college like a lot of other people.
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.080]  Throughout 2010 through 2015,
[01:28.120 --> 01:30.000]  I worked full-time as an engineer
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.360]  while cultivating light depth indoor,
[01:33.360 --> 01:35.000]  some large scale outdoor,
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.720]  just doing what everybody else has kind of been doing,
[01:37.720 --> 01:41.040]  just doing 70, 80 hour weeks for years on end.
[01:42.120 --> 01:44.360]  And then I started the Sonoma Cannabis Company
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.160]  and the Aya brand and really went pretty hard
[01:47.160 --> 01:49.000]  on the CO2 extracts.
[01:49.520 --> 01:53.400]  And yeah, it was really, that business has failed.
[01:54.400 --> 01:57.520]  It was, yeah, it was just a lot of struggles,
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.040]  trials and tribulations.
[01:59.040 --> 02:01.760]  We tried, we had a problem finding any clean trim
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.680]  and in 2017 went back into cultivation.
[02:05.680 --> 02:08.840]  Fires up in Sonoma County really affected us.
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.960]  I remember kind of one of the big things for me
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.360]  was looking at what the future of extracts were
[02:14.360 --> 02:16.240]  and it was not CO2 extraction
[02:17.240 --> 02:18.880]  and seeing really what was going to happen
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.920]  in the future with extracts.
[02:20.920 --> 02:22.200]  And then looking at,
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.280]  I remember one of the first like 40 acre farms,
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.000]  I went down and saw in Salinas in early 2017.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.600]  And I was like, okay, this is what's gonna be,
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.840]  this is what's happening.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.280]  And I've always been up here in Sonoma County,
[02:40.160 --> 02:42.080]  we have a one acre cap right now.
[02:42.080 --> 02:44.080]  I've always been kind of like for a while,
[02:44.080 --> 02:47.000]  I was like one acre was probably minimum viable business.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.080]  Nowadays, I really think that three acres
[02:51.080 --> 02:53.440]  as far as when you're talking about outdoor or hoops
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.280]  is probably the minimum viable project size
[02:57.280 --> 02:59.960]  to be able to make it through these next few years.
[03:00.960 --> 03:03.160]  Yeah, and as far as like my outlook on the industry,
[03:03.160 --> 03:06.160]  I think it's gonna be a lot more trials
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.200]  and tribulations ahead.
[03:07.200 --> 03:08.480]  I don't think the next three years
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.000]  are going to be rainbows and sunshine.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.560]  I think it's gonna be a lot of struggle
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.000]  and yeah, I'm just kind of ready to take that on.
[03:19.290 --> 03:23.130]  So talk about, can we do like the post-mortem autopsy
[03:23.130 --> 03:25.490]  on Sonoma Cannabis and IA brand or the-
[03:25.490 --> 03:26.330]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:26.330 --> 03:28.850]  And kind of like when you started it,
[03:28.850 --> 03:32.330]  kind of talk about like the initial entrepreneurial
[03:32.330 --> 03:34.970]  successes you were having.
[03:36.290 --> 03:38.090]  Yeah, so we-
[03:38.090 --> 03:39.450]  Downhill.
[03:39.450 --> 03:44.450]  Yeah, so like I had been dabbling in making extracts
[03:45.050 --> 03:50.050]  and had like in late 13, had like precipitated out THCA
[03:51.890 --> 03:55.090]  and entered that in SoCal High Times Cup and did well.
[03:55.090 --> 04:00.090]  And then, yeah, when I custom designed a CO2 machine
[04:00.610 --> 04:04.610]  with another, an engineer that had built one very similarly,
[04:04.610 --> 04:07.650]  made some tweaks, made our first custom one
[04:07.650 --> 04:11.450]  and we were hitting, you know, six, 7% terpenes
[04:11.450 --> 04:16.450]  on a version, you know, kind of fresh press cold extraction.
[04:17.770 --> 04:20.570]  And so we were just seeing a lot of demand for our product.
[04:20.570 --> 04:22.370]  And this was what year?
[04:22.370 --> 04:25.330]  This was late 15.
[04:25.330 --> 04:26.250]  Okay.
[04:26.250 --> 04:28.050]  Yeah, and then so in 16, we realized
[04:28.050 --> 04:30.330]  we were gonna start to brand and go down that route
[04:30.330 --> 04:33.570]  because we saw wholesale oil prices tanking
[04:33.570 --> 04:36.050]  and without a brand, we couldn't really actually explain
[04:36.050 --> 04:38.130]  our value proposition of quality.
[04:39.450 --> 04:41.370]  With the help of two other partners,
[04:42.290 --> 04:43.850]  one of which Aaron Bro,
[04:43.850 --> 04:46.930]  which he went on to start Snow Pacific Distribution.
[04:46.930 --> 04:48.570]  He was our sales team.
[04:48.570 --> 04:53.290]  He launched us into 60 shelves in three months
[04:53.290 --> 04:56.930]  and starting in June of 2016.
[04:57.730 --> 04:58.650]  We kind of just-
[04:58.650 --> 05:00.810]  And under what brand name?
[05:00.810 --> 05:01.930]  That was the Aya brand.
[05:01.930 --> 05:02.770]  Okay.
[05:02.770 --> 05:03.650]  Yeah, it was interesting
[05:03.650 --> 05:05.770]  because the reason that brand started
[05:05.770 --> 05:09.210]  was because one of my clients, the engineering firm,
[05:09.210 --> 05:11.850]  has a very large marketing company.
[05:11.850 --> 05:16.290]  And I got us an in there and we got them to design our brand
[05:17.250 --> 05:19.170]  and, you know, take equity for that brand,
[05:19.170 --> 05:22.650]  which was really lucky because just to do all that work
[05:22.650 --> 05:24.090]  would have been a half a million dollars with them.
[05:24.090 --> 05:25.050]  They had like a whole block
[05:25.050 --> 05:28.450]  and they launched Nest into four countries in 2017.
[05:28.450 --> 05:30.010]  I mean, they're a huge company.
[05:30.010 --> 05:32.930]  I knew the president of that company and founder.
[05:32.930 --> 05:35.890]  And so it got us them to take on our project.
[05:35.930 --> 05:37.330]  And essentially we just,
[05:39.370 --> 05:41.410]  there's a couple of downfalls with that company.
[05:41.410 --> 05:43.930]  One of which was we held true to our-
[05:43.930 --> 05:46.210]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:46.210 --> 05:50.170]  Before you get to the downfalls, talk about the ascent.
[05:50.170 --> 05:53.090]  So talk about kind of the early successes.
[05:53.090 --> 05:54.210]  So I assume it was what,
[05:54.210 --> 05:56.770]  flour pre-rolls and CO2 extracted-
[05:56.770 --> 05:57.730]  Yeah, it was good.
[05:57.730 --> 05:58.570]  It was CO2.
[05:58.570 --> 05:59.890]  Or something, or what were the-
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.970]  It was just CO2, vape pens.
[06:02.970 --> 06:03.810]  Okay.
[06:03.810 --> 06:06.050]  So then we eventually dropped
[06:06.050 --> 06:10.890]  the extra virgin solventless rosin.
[06:10.890 --> 06:13.090]  And then we also dropped pre-rolls.
[06:13.090 --> 06:18.090]  And the pre-rolls, I think it was like mid to late 2017.
[06:18.890 --> 06:21.250]  And it was really saturated at that point.
[06:21.250 --> 06:23.730]  We were looking at kind of like horizontal,
[06:23.730 --> 06:27.170]  maintaining a certain number of shelves well
[06:27.170 --> 06:30.850]  and not servicing a bunch of shelves that didn't do well
[06:30.850 --> 06:32.530]  and were actually more expensive to maintain
[06:33.490 --> 06:34.770]  than what they earned us.
[06:34.770 --> 06:36.490]  And so we wanted to try to expand our footprint
[06:36.490 --> 06:37.970]  within those existing shelves.
[06:37.970 --> 06:40.690]  And that's kind of why we went down those product lines.
[06:41.570 --> 06:44.010]  Yeah, it was some exciting time.
[06:44.010 --> 06:45.690]  It was really hard to manage capital
[06:45.690 --> 06:48.170]  because we were all entirely self-funded.
[06:49.250 --> 06:52.570]  And when you're trying to decide
[06:52.570 --> 06:55.130]  whether to buy 20,000 more cartridges
[06:55.130 --> 06:57.690]  or you're deciding whether to how much clean trim
[06:57.690 --> 07:01.050]  you can buy or clean smalls you can buy,
[07:01.050 --> 07:05.170]  it's just really difficult capital balance with employees
[07:05.170 --> 07:07.730]  and with everything else that was going on.
[07:07.730 --> 07:11.650]  It was just maintaining supply chain
[07:11.650 --> 07:13.770]  and accounts payable and accounts receivable
[07:13.770 --> 07:18.770]  was a very stressful endeavor.
[07:19.930 --> 07:22.210]  So that we're looking at the product, right?
[07:22.210 --> 07:23.050]  The Vapen?
[07:23.050 --> 07:23.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:26.970 --> 07:31.010]  And so talk about, I mean, you were on a few shelves.
[07:31.970 --> 07:36.970]  You were doing all your own, sorry, let me get back to me.
[07:37.170 --> 07:40.370]  You were, cause one of the things, go ahead.
[07:40.370 --> 07:41.210]  Just a quick question.
[07:41.210 --> 07:46.210]  Did you purposely stay away from flour, jarred eighths,
[07:47.010 --> 07:48.770]  that type of product?
[07:48.770 --> 07:50.410]  Yeah, we did.
[07:50.410 --> 07:53.850]  Mostly because we viewed it as a too,
[07:53.850 --> 07:58.370]  it was too capital intensive to scale for us.
[07:59.370 --> 08:00.210]  Got it.
[08:00.210 --> 08:03.610]  And so talk about kind of like the,
[08:03.610 --> 08:06.370]  you talked about staying small in terms of not trying
[08:06.370 --> 08:07.810]  to be on every shelf in the state.
[08:07.810 --> 08:10.690]  You wanted to kind of keep those 60 accounts
[08:10.690 --> 08:13.130]  and you had revenue growth, right?
[08:13.130 --> 08:14.970]  Like it started out successful
[08:14.970 --> 08:19.170]  and you were growing all your own biomass for-
[08:19.170 --> 08:20.010]  No, we weren't.
[08:20.010 --> 08:20.850]  We weren't.
[08:20.850 --> 08:24.130]  We grew some, but at the time,
[08:24.570 --> 08:29.570]  we, in 2016, we grew past what we could actually source
[08:30.530 --> 08:31.810]  of clean material.
[08:31.810 --> 08:35.090]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times we'd run a first,
[08:35.090 --> 08:40.090]  we'd do a first pull, crack the bottom of the condenser tube
[08:42.170 --> 08:45.050]  and send it off right for a test and it popped up
[08:45.050 --> 08:48.090]  for avid, fluoramide or Eagle.
[08:48.090 --> 08:49.930]  I mean, it's just, it was, and that,
[08:49.930 --> 08:52.130]  especially in that time, now we've got the whole
[08:52.130 --> 08:53.170]  regulated market and everything,
[08:53.170 --> 08:56.570]  but in that time we were trying to stay 100% clean,
[08:56.570 --> 08:59.170]  high terpene count and 100% pesticide free.
[08:59.170 --> 09:00.650]  And we never broke the 100,
[09:00.650 --> 09:04.090]  we never broke that promise to our customers
[09:04.090 --> 09:05.410]  to be pesticide free.
[09:05.410 --> 09:08.330]  And to be honest, it was one of our downfalls.
[09:08.330 --> 09:10.690]  I mean, a lot of competitor brands, a lot of their brands,
[09:10.690 --> 09:12.130]  we had just pushed all that,
[09:13.890 --> 09:15.330]  all of that product out to shelf,
[09:15.330 --> 09:17.690]  like much of our competitors did.
[09:17.690 --> 09:20.330]  We would have done really well, but at the same time,
[09:20.330 --> 09:22.130]  that's one thing I can look in the mirror
[09:22.130 --> 09:24.530]  on that whole decision and really see.
[09:24.530 --> 09:28.690]  So they knowingly put a tainted product out into the market
[09:28.690 --> 09:31.810]  to keep growth and momentum and market share.
[09:31.810 --> 09:32.810]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[09:32.810 --> 09:35.210]  That was, I mean, I'm not gonna name any names about that,
[09:35.210 --> 09:38.610]  but that was, I'd say at that time.
[09:38.610 --> 09:41.050]  That was gonna be my next question.
[09:41.050 --> 09:42.330]  No, no, I mean.
[09:42.330 --> 09:47.330]  All right, so you, I mean, talk about the early revenues,
[09:47.970 --> 09:51.130]  cause I remember when I was listening to that podcast,
[09:51.370 --> 09:54.450]  you were like, and we, within three months you had,
[09:54.450 --> 09:56.250]  what was your monthly revenue?
[09:56.250 --> 09:57.730]  I mean, these are exciting times.
[09:57.730 --> 10:00.770]  You're like a two man shop and you're generating revenue.
[10:01.770 --> 10:05.210]  Yeah, I think in the course of like 18 months,
[10:05.210 --> 10:08.170]  I'm not sure, I think we, of course 18 months,
[10:08.170 --> 10:10.810]  I think we just only turned over like a couple million.
[10:13.290 --> 10:16.570]  So it wasn't huge, it wasn't like, it wasn't.
[10:16.570 --> 10:19.570]  But I mean like you went from like 10,000 a month
[10:19.570 --> 10:22.930]  to 20 to 30,000 a month in sales.
[10:22.930 --> 10:24.850]  Yeah, it goes from a day a month very quickly.
[10:24.850 --> 10:26.730]  Okay, so a hundred thousand a month,
[10:26.730 --> 10:29.090]  that's not a bad trajectory.
[10:29.090 --> 10:32.250]  And then kind of what happened?
[10:32.250 --> 10:36.690]  I mean, now we're starting to go back down the hill
[10:36.690 --> 10:40.210]  of success and so what was the downfall?
[10:41.890 --> 10:46.890]  In 2017, we went to actually scale to cultivate
[10:47.050 --> 10:50.090]  all of our own product because, or not all of it,
[10:50.090 --> 10:53.890]  but we went to cultivate as much as possible.
[10:53.890 --> 10:56.530]  And we, at the time our team,
[10:56.530 --> 10:58.170]  we'd come from cultivation first.
[10:58.170 --> 11:01.330]  So it wasn't something that we hadn't done before,
[11:01.330 --> 11:03.970]  but we went to cultivate as much as we possibly could
[11:03.970 --> 11:07.810]  that we knew 100% would be pesticide free.
[11:07.810 --> 11:10.570]  So we wouldn't have these constant overheads
[11:10.570 --> 11:15.090]  of R&D tests and failures and the constant runaround
[11:15.130 --> 11:17.450]  of telling people that their shit was dirty
[11:17.450 --> 11:19.090]  and then them saying it wasn't dirty
[11:19.090 --> 11:21.650]  and all this shit that would constantly go on
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.610]  during that period.
[11:23.930 --> 11:27.690]  So it was, we went pretty hard on the cultivation.
[11:30.450 --> 11:34.610]  We had massive fires, the Tubbs Fire and the Valley,
[11:34.610 --> 11:37.690]  the Nunn's Canyon Fire that year.
[11:37.690 --> 11:41.210]  That was like, I remember it was the Sunday night.
[11:41.210 --> 11:43.850]  I had a 20 person harvest crew come in the next day
[11:44.530 --> 11:47.530]  on October 8th for all of our early harvest
[11:47.530 --> 11:49.810]  and my house burned down that night.
[11:51.330 --> 11:56.330]  And so we, yeah, we lost a lot of product that night.
[11:57.010 --> 11:57.890]  I can't say that was,
[11:57.890 --> 11:59.730]  I can't blame it completely on the fire.
[11:59.730 --> 12:01.650]  We were having a lot of problems
[12:01.650 --> 12:04.530]  just from cashflow purposes,
[12:04.530 --> 12:07.570]  accounts not paying us even back then.
[12:07.570 --> 12:10.610]  And we were also, we couldn't,
[12:10.610 --> 12:13.290]  we were working so much in our business
[12:13.770 --> 12:16.010]  that we couldn't actually work for our business.
[12:16.010 --> 12:19.330]  So at that time we really needed to take on capital,
[12:19.330 --> 12:21.170]  take on partners.
[12:21.170 --> 12:22.530]  I know my partner at the time,
[12:22.530 --> 12:25.170]  we were working with an investment group
[12:25.170 --> 12:27.490]  and we were on the precipice of accepting
[12:27.490 --> 12:29.690]  like seven and a half million dollars of investment
[12:29.690 --> 12:32.730]  to buy some large property for cultivation
[12:32.730 --> 12:34.210]  in Sonoma County and large property
[12:34.210 --> 12:35.530]  and also industrial property
[12:35.530 --> 12:39.010]  for our, to get a Type 6 license in Santa Rosa.
[12:39.010 --> 12:42.210]  And we looked at it and we're like, holy shit,
[12:42.250 --> 12:44.330]  this market, this property we're about to buy
[12:44.330 --> 12:46.530]  is 35% over market average
[12:46.530 --> 12:48.570]  because it was peak prospecting years.
[12:48.570 --> 12:51.770]  And all we're gonna do is hand over our entire company,
[12:51.770 --> 12:54.330]  this investment group in less than a year
[12:54.330 --> 12:55.490]  because there's no way
[12:55.490 --> 12:57.850]  we're gonna be able to actually handle this.
[12:57.850 --> 12:59.850]  And so we actually turned it down.
[12:59.850 --> 13:01.010]  And that's one thing I,
[13:02.170 --> 13:05.010]  we failed early versus failing later on,
[13:05.010 --> 13:06.690]  but we would have failed either way
[13:06.690 --> 13:08.170]  with the way that that investment was set up
[13:08.170 --> 13:11.410]  and the way that that real estate was set up.
[13:11.410 --> 13:13.010]  Being a civil engineer in Sonoma County,
[13:13.010 --> 13:15.690]  I knew how long it really took to get a CUP
[13:15.690 --> 13:17.570]  and how long it was really gonna take.
[13:17.570 --> 13:18.690]  And look where we are.
[13:18.690 --> 13:22.250]  A lot of people have got in the CUP process,
[13:22.250 --> 13:27.250]  mid 2016 and are still in that CUP process
[13:27.570 --> 13:29.090]  three, three and a half years later,
[13:29.090 --> 13:30.610]  still don't have a permit,
[13:30.610 --> 13:32.450]  still are just burning money on rent,
[13:32.450 --> 13:34.610]  burning money on properties.
[13:34.610 --> 13:38.010]  So in that situation, I'm glad that I left it.
[13:40.980 --> 13:44.060]  And so what was the business?
[13:44.060 --> 13:47.700]  So when did you finally essentially put the bullet
[13:47.700 --> 13:50.260]  in the company's head and kind of,
[13:50.260 --> 13:52.340]  was it unanimous agreement?
[13:52.340 --> 13:54.980]  Like we just need to shut this thing down or?
[13:54.980 --> 13:58.580]  So I had a really awesome partner
[13:58.580 --> 14:02.780]  and even to this day, he's just a really good dude.
[14:03.700 --> 14:06.260]  And so what happened was essentially
[14:06.260 --> 14:09.380]  he had put more money into the company than I had.
[14:09.900 --> 14:14.900]  And I gave the company over to him
[14:15.180 --> 14:18.300]  because I was, at that time after my house burned down
[14:18.300 --> 14:20.420]  and everything in like early 2018,
[14:21.420 --> 14:23.300]  it wasn't gonna survive with,
[14:25.580 --> 14:28.980]  it couldn't support me to pay me a wage like it had.
[14:28.980 --> 14:32.380]  And so I actually just signed over all my percentage to him
[14:33.300 --> 14:35.180]  and let him try to make it succeed.
[14:35.180 --> 14:38.860]  And he made a good run at it as well.
[14:39.380 --> 14:43.900]  We tried to do some contract manufacturing stuff, but yeah.
[14:43.900 --> 14:45.900]  What were the big challenges back then
[14:45.900 --> 14:47.500]  to getting into more shops,
[14:47.500 --> 14:52.500]  to getting, taking those 60 shelves up to 120 or 150?
[14:54.980 --> 14:58.060]  Ultimately you had to be able to make very good terms
[14:58.060 --> 14:58.940]  for the retailer.
[14:58.940 --> 15:02.660]  You had to be net 45, net 60.
[15:02.660 --> 15:05.580]  You had to compete, the customer education wasn't there.
[15:05.620 --> 15:08.060]  So we're trying to sell pens,
[15:08.060 --> 15:13.060]  a replacement tip at 1950, $20 per 500 milligram.
[15:14.420 --> 15:18.980]  And at the time we were getting undercut all day,
[15:18.980 --> 15:23.100]  $12 for 500 milligrams for people that weren't clean.
[15:23.100 --> 15:25.500]  And it was really difficult.
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.220]  And the retail shops are just like,
[15:27.220 --> 15:28.860]  yeah, our customers aren't gonna,
[15:28.860 --> 15:30.780]  they're putting on way more than a,
[15:30.780 --> 15:32.340]  they're putting on a 200% markup
[15:32.340 --> 15:35.900]  trying to sell a pen tip for 60 bucks.
[15:35.900 --> 15:38.380]  And it was really difficult to get the velocity
[15:38.380 --> 15:39.740]  we needed at that rate.
[15:40.860 --> 15:43.380]  I'm sure Bam, I know with your,
[15:44.860 --> 15:46.500]  I think, what did you get that?
[15:46.500 --> 15:48.660]  Was it 16 or 17?
[15:48.660 --> 15:51.180]  I think it was 16 where you got second
[15:51.180 --> 15:52.980]  and I got third in the Emerald Cup.
[15:55.900 --> 15:56.820]  You know what I mean?
[15:56.820 --> 15:58.260]  Yeah, let me unmute him.
[15:58.260 --> 16:01.180]  All right, Bam, take it from the top again, you were muted.
[16:02.180 --> 16:03.980]  I said, yeah, in 2016,
[16:03.980 --> 16:07.020]  we took first and second at the Emerald Cup.
[16:07.020 --> 16:07.860]  That's right.
[16:09.220 --> 16:11.020]  First and second.
[16:11.020 --> 16:12.620]  So we took first at Chalice.
[16:12.620 --> 16:17.620]  We took first and second at Happy Place.
[16:19.060 --> 16:22.740]  We took first, second and third at the Santa Cruz Cup.
[16:22.740 --> 16:24.740]  We took first at the Stoners Cup.
[16:24.740 --> 16:27.660]  We crushed it in terms of the awards.
[16:27.660 --> 16:29.700]  And what category?
[16:30.660 --> 16:31.980]  CO2 extractions.
[16:32.900 --> 16:35.580]  And we had a very similar story to Sam's
[16:35.580 --> 16:38.340]  in that we were meticulous about our sourcing,
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.180]  never failed.
[16:39.180 --> 16:44.180]  I think when both me and Sam placed at the Emerald Cup,
[16:45.340 --> 16:48.060]  there was three companies that didn't fail
[16:48.060 --> 16:49.700]  for something or the other.
[16:49.700 --> 16:52.580]  And that was the top five.
[16:52.580 --> 16:55.060]  Two was ours, I think two was Sam's.
[16:55.060 --> 16:58.940]  And then there was another company that also had passed.
[16:59.180 --> 17:03.380]  And similarly at Chalice and Happy Place,
[17:03.380 --> 17:07.140]  we took first, but there was only two companies
[17:07.140 --> 17:12.140]  out of like 12 or 15 that entered that passed.
[17:12.660 --> 17:16.020]  And just quickly, what year was that?
[17:16.020 --> 17:17.260]  2016.
[17:17.260 --> 17:18.340]  Got it.
[17:18.340 --> 17:21.380]  And similar trends carried over into 2017.
[17:21.380 --> 17:22.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:22.500 --> 17:27.500]  It wasn't until July of 18 that really,
[17:27.740 --> 17:30.540]  that pesticides actually got taken off the shelf.
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.380]  Yeah.
[17:33.380 --> 17:37.860]  But as far as the trials and tribulations go,
[17:37.860 --> 17:40.940]  I can relate to a lot of what Sam's talking about.
[17:41.820 --> 17:45.260]  When you're really focusing on building a craft brand
[17:45.260 --> 17:47.380]  and you're putting your emphasis on quality,
[17:47.380 --> 17:50.420]  to me it's not just about the quality of the product,
[17:50.420 --> 17:52.180]  but it's the quality of the supply chain
[17:52.180 --> 17:55.620]  and the healthy ecosystem for all people that are involved.
[17:55.660 --> 17:58.860]  We were really, we knew every single farm
[17:58.860 --> 17:59.700]  that we've worked with.
[17:59.700 --> 18:01.700]  We knew every single farmer
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.940]  and we made sure that we paid them what was a fair wage
[18:05.940 --> 18:10.140]  because we were farmers who started the company.
[18:10.140 --> 18:15.140]  And our goal was to bring quality to the market
[18:17.020 --> 18:18.980]  and also to the supply chain.
[18:18.980 --> 18:20.380]  Because we came from the foundation
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.860]  that business should be good to all parties involved,
[18:22.860 --> 18:27.180]  producers, manufacturers, retailers, as well as consumers.
[18:27.180 --> 18:29.340]  But we struggled with the same thing
[18:29.340 --> 18:31.020]  in terms of market penetration.
[18:32.340 --> 18:33.940]  We've just kept being undercut.
[18:33.940 --> 18:36.460]  We couldn't compete with this point.
[18:36.460 --> 18:40.260]  Because when you're making like a high end CO2 extraction,
[18:41.660 --> 18:45.980]  if you're touching 15% return, you're crushing it.
[18:45.980 --> 18:47.700]  That's the amazing thing.
[18:47.700 --> 18:48.540]  Crushing it.
[18:48.540 --> 18:51.060]  I think that was maybe the highest return that we ever had.
[18:51.100 --> 18:55.860]  We had, you know, our CO2 was definitely a lot different
[18:55.860 --> 19:00.220]  than much of the other CO2 that was on the market.
[19:00.220 --> 19:02.780]  We had a single solvent extraction.
[19:02.780 --> 19:04.940]  We didn't use any ethanol.
[19:04.940 --> 19:07.460]  We didn't do any winterization process.
[19:07.460 --> 19:12.460]  And our trim carts were testing between 10 and 15%.
[19:12.780 --> 19:16.260]  And our whole flower runs were testing
[19:16.260 --> 19:19.380]  from between 15 and 30%.
[19:19.420 --> 19:20.260]  I remember smoking this.
[19:20.260 --> 19:23.300]  But that didn't necessarily translate into better sales.
[19:23.300 --> 19:26.700]  Even with all the awards, even with all the recognition,
[19:27.980 --> 19:30.380]  one of the biggest hurdles that we faced
[19:30.380 --> 19:32.220]  was just getting shelf space.
[19:32.220 --> 19:35.780]  If you weren't gonna be giving retailers
[19:37.500 --> 19:40.060]  a ridiculous margin, in my mind,
[19:41.420 --> 19:42.460]  it wasn't gonna work.
[19:42.460 --> 19:44.900]  And we couldn't compete with this list.
[19:45.500 --> 19:49.820]  The process of making this and flavoring it
[19:49.820 --> 19:53.700]  is significantly cheaper than taking award-winning strains
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.500]  from award-winning farmers
[19:55.500 --> 19:58.820]  and doing a virgin cold press extract
[19:58.820 --> 20:03.700]  where you're getting anywhere between 7% and 15% returns.
[20:03.700 --> 20:06.860]  And factor in the fact that we're paying our farmers
[20:06.860 --> 20:10.740]  what championship winning flowers were worth.
[20:10.780 --> 20:14.900]  But our goal was never to make handover for this profit.
[20:14.900 --> 20:17.820]  We just wanted to bring a high quality product
[20:17.820 --> 20:19.860]  to the market and find a space.
[20:19.860 --> 20:23.780]  But we had problems getting into more than 30 stores.
[20:23.780 --> 20:27.420]  And there was a lot of brands, I'm not gonna name them,
[20:27.420 --> 20:32.420]  that were able to come in and undercut us by almost 50%.
[20:33.420 --> 20:38.420]  And we were barely operating on a 5% margin,
[20:39.180 --> 20:41.420]  10% margin at that time
[20:42.500 --> 20:46.620]  because of the way that our supply chain worked.
[20:48.180 --> 20:50.620]  I'm still very proud of the product that we made.
[20:53.060 --> 20:54.660]  We had amazing carts.
[20:55.940 --> 21:00.940]  We put an emphasis on quality over quantity.
[21:00.980 --> 21:04.340]  So one of the big issues that we had faced
[21:04.340 --> 21:08.300]  was higher return rate.
[21:09.260 --> 21:14.260]  When we made our carts, we didn't use any epoxies or glues,
[21:14.540 --> 21:18.220]  which are what terpenes dissolve this.
[21:19.820 --> 21:21.940]  There's a lot of information about this out there.
[21:21.940 --> 21:24.060]  But limonene, which is a high,
[21:24.060 --> 21:29.060]  which is very common terpene found in a number of strains,
[21:29.860 --> 21:31.820]  will dissolve epoxies.
[21:31.860 --> 21:34.900]  And so we tried to make a construction of carts
[21:34.900 --> 21:39.900]  that didn't involve many of these carcinogenic agents.
[21:42.180 --> 21:45.900]  And as a result, we had a higher default rate.
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.820]  We warrantied everything that we did.
[21:47.820 --> 21:52.060]  Our fault rate was never more than a 2% to 5%.
[21:52.060 --> 21:56.740]  But when you're operating on a thin margin of 5% to 10%,
[21:56.740 --> 22:00.580]  if you're lucky, that will make or break your company.
[22:01.460 --> 22:04.300]  But I still don't narrow it down to that.
[22:04.300 --> 22:07.140]  From us, from a craft farmer standpoint,
[22:07.140 --> 22:11.140]  from a small business farm to table type model,
[22:11.140 --> 22:16.020]  the biggest hurdle for us was getting shelf space.
[22:16.020 --> 22:17.820]  Some of the hurdles that we had was
[22:18.740 --> 22:21.540]  retailers wanted us to incentivize it
[22:21.540 --> 22:24.460]  by giving them a bunch of freebies and promos.
[22:24.460 --> 22:28.860]  And there was only a certain degree that we could do
[22:28.860 --> 22:30.660]  in terms of doing that.
[22:30.660 --> 22:34.700]  Because again, you're operating on a 5% to 10% margin.
[22:34.700 --> 22:36.220]  How are you supposed to do buy one,
[22:36.220 --> 22:38.500]  get one free all day long?
[22:39.540 --> 22:42.580]  Yeah, two days a month, they wanna buy one, get one.
[22:42.580 --> 22:44.220]  It's like, are you kidding me?
[22:44.220 --> 22:46.660]  Right, so basically we're gonna go bankrupt
[22:46.660 --> 22:48.700]  based on promotion.
[22:48.700 --> 22:51.180]  And I understand that some companies
[22:51.180 --> 22:54.260]  very successfully leveraged their market share
[22:54.260 --> 22:56.780]  into corporate buyouts.
[22:56.780 --> 23:00.380]  And that worked out wonderfully for some people.
[23:00.380 --> 23:01.860]  But again, that wasn't,
[23:01.860 --> 23:05.460]  we were a small farmer collective of individuals.
[23:05.460 --> 23:07.180]  This is something that I experimented with
[23:07.180 --> 23:09.980]  in my bedroom trying to make.
[23:09.980 --> 23:13.660]  And again, our focus was on the craft,
[23:13.660 --> 23:16.300]  not so much the business end of things.
[23:17.940 --> 23:22.420]  In hindsight, I wish that we had analyzed it
[23:22.420 --> 23:25.660]  more from like the business analytical mind.
[23:25.660 --> 23:28.380]  But I don't regret anything that we did
[23:28.380 --> 23:31.220]  because I know that we didn't compromise our values.
[23:32.580 --> 23:37.580]  And I think the biggest hurdle for us is
[23:37.580 --> 23:41.300]  how do we, even going into today's market,
[23:41.300 --> 23:46.300]  how do we maintain that craft feel and story and history
[23:50.540 --> 23:54.060]  without getting lost in the sauce
[23:54.100 --> 23:55.740]  of the retail and distribution world?
[23:55.740 --> 23:58.900]  I think that's a hard one to see.
[23:58.900 --> 24:01.620]  And just listening to Sam speak now,
[24:01.620 --> 24:03.540]  mentioning how by your analysis-
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.740]  Just quickly, Ben.
[24:06.740 --> 24:08.060]  Just quickly, Ben.
[24:08.060 --> 24:11.580]  Can you hold the microphone up?
[24:11.580 --> 24:13.580]  Is that it at your neck?
[24:13.580 --> 24:15.940]  Where's the actual, there's something around your neck.
[24:15.940 --> 24:17.460]  Is that your microphone or?
[24:18.460 --> 24:20.220]  Is this any better?
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.260]  That's much better, much better.
[24:24.580 --> 24:25.420]  Yeah.
[24:26.300 --> 24:28.620]  Okay, so what I was saying was-
[24:28.620 --> 24:32.340]  And actually, just quickly before you go on,
[24:32.340 --> 24:36.940]  was this the product that you launched in the beginning?
[24:37.820 --> 24:40.580]  Yes, that was the product that we launched.
[24:42.260 --> 24:45.620]  So it was all like full transparency, name of the strain.
[24:45.620 --> 24:47.380]  We took a very like wine.
[24:48.740 --> 24:51.900]  I'm a foodie and I like wine.
[24:51.900 --> 24:54.860]  And so Appalachian and origin and provenance
[24:54.860 --> 24:58.740]  are all like very important aspects of what I do.
[24:58.740 --> 25:02.940]  So we felt it was important to like label the strain,
[25:02.940 --> 25:06.620]  the conditions of growth, indoor, outdoor, greenhouse,
[25:06.620 --> 25:09.860]  the season, to capture the terroir
[25:09.860 --> 25:13.180]  and then name the actual farms that they had come from.
[25:13.180 --> 25:16.220]  So all of our packaging included the name of the strain,
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.700]  the name of the farmer,
[25:17.700 --> 25:21.140]  the county that it was grown in and the season,
[25:21.140 --> 25:23.580]  just so that as we showcase,
[25:23.580 --> 25:24.500]  because I'm also a breeder,
[25:24.500 --> 25:28.220]  so environment and terroir are all really big
[25:28.220 --> 25:30.100]  and important aspects to me.
[25:30.100 --> 25:34.220]  And it's really interesting to see how an OG Kush
[25:34.220 --> 25:36.700]  grown in Santa Cruz in the wintertime
[25:36.700 --> 25:41.300]  tastes so much different than one grown at the same farm
[25:41.300 --> 25:42.140]  in the summertime.
[25:42.140 --> 25:44.020]  And I thought this was gonna be a great tool
[25:44.020 --> 25:46.060]  to educate consumers.
[25:46.060 --> 25:49.420]  Because for me, if you're a small farm,
[25:49.420 --> 25:52.380]  trying to make it in the big market,
[25:52.380 --> 25:55.420]  the most important aspect is consumer education.
[25:56.700 --> 25:59.140]  If you're producing a quality product,
[25:59.140 --> 26:01.620]  the big disconnect is that a lot of times
[26:02.740 --> 26:05.060]  uninitiated consumers don't understand
[26:06.460 --> 26:07.860]  what that quality means.
[26:08.900 --> 26:11.780]  I remember doing in-stores
[26:11.780 --> 26:13.900]  and having to educate people on terpenes.
[26:13.900 --> 26:16.300]  People didn't know what terpenes were
[26:16.300 --> 26:18.340]  or how that affected it.
[26:18.340 --> 26:19.980]  And a lot of people didn't even think about
[26:19.980 --> 26:21.420]  like the pesticide.
[26:21.420 --> 26:24.220]  I thought after we took Chalice
[26:24.220 --> 26:27.260]  and we saw 15 other brands,
[26:27.260 --> 26:29.420]  1200 brands fail for testing,
[26:29.420 --> 26:32.580]  that this was gonna be the aha moment for consumers.
[26:32.580 --> 26:33.740]  And it wasn't.
[26:37.180 --> 26:42.060]  I never ever in the history of being out there vending,
[26:42.060 --> 26:44.980]  did I ever get a question from a consumer
[26:44.980 --> 26:47.620]  that involved the safety of the product
[26:47.660 --> 26:50.780]  and whether it contained pesticides
[26:50.780 --> 26:52.900]  or had it undergone that testing.
[26:52.900 --> 26:54.660]  And we put a lot of emphasis into that
[26:54.660 --> 26:56.980]  because we thought that that was an important thing
[26:56.980 --> 26:57.820]  to highlight.
[26:59.220 --> 27:01.180]  It's interesting that like editorial staff
[27:01.180 --> 27:02.460]  at different magazines
[27:04.180 --> 27:07.460]  and different media outlets did promote those things.
[27:07.460 --> 27:12.140]  But somehow even with all that media education campaign
[27:12.140 --> 27:13.860]  and our personal outreach,
[27:14.260 --> 27:19.260]  it didn't translate to consumers.
[27:19.500 --> 27:21.300]  And to be quite honest,
[27:21.300 --> 27:25.660]  I didn't see the push from the retail segment
[27:25.660 --> 27:29.860]  to highlight those benefits or proportions.
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.380]  And it always made me wonder,
[27:32.620 --> 27:34.820]  is it really just all about the margin?
[27:34.820 --> 27:36.580]  Is it really just all about the margin?
[27:36.580 --> 27:41.580]  Because why weren't these retailers being our partners
[27:42.300 --> 27:44.420]  in the education of the consumers?
[27:44.420 --> 27:47.340]  Was education detrimental to their bottom line?
[27:47.340 --> 27:50.820]  And if education is detrimental to their bottom line.
[27:50.820 --> 27:54.100]  I mean, I think I can agree with that 100%.
[27:54.100 --> 27:54.940]  The problem that I saw,
[27:54.940 --> 27:57.740]  and I heard this directly from someone's lips
[27:57.740 --> 28:00.540]  that was the owner of a dispensary.
[28:00.540 --> 28:04.620]  Well, if we come out and say you're pesticide free,
[28:04.620 --> 28:06.860]  that says everything else has pesticides.
[28:06.860 --> 28:08.180]  So we can't even say that.
[28:09.180 --> 28:12.020]  And so it was like,
[28:12.020 --> 28:13.940]  and it just goes to show like that,
[28:13.940 --> 28:18.380]  like timing in business is more important than anything.
[28:18.380 --> 28:22.020]  I mean, I feel all the people that are starting companies
[28:22.020 --> 28:23.980]  right at the beginning of this year
[28:23.980 --> 28:25.180]  and now COVID is happening.
[28:25.180 --> 28:27.060]  It's like they didn't have a chance.
[28:27.060 --> 28:29.820]  Timing is just like this, I don't know.
[28:29.820 --> 28:32.260]  It's a force in and of itself.
[28:33.260 --> 28:34.100]  Definitely.
[28:36.500 --> 28:37.820]  Definitely.
[28:38.460 --> 28:39.500]  Well, it wasn't even an aha moment
[28:39.500 --> 28:41.140]  for the farmers at that time.
[28:44.100 --> 28:45.900]  What do you mean?
[28:45.900 --> 28:47.740]  Well, what Bam was saying a minute ago,
[28:47.740 --> 28:50.300]  he thought that when the test results
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.620]  from all these different events, not just chalice,
[28:52.620 --> 28:54.140]  we all thought the consumers,
[28:54.140 --> 28:56.260]  it would be an aha moment for a lot of them,
[28:56.260 --> 28:59.140]  but it was barely an aha moment for the farmers as well,
[28:59.140 --> 29:02.940]  because this dirty process continued all the way through
[29:02.940 --> 29:04.300]  even the legalization.
[29:04.340 --> 29:07.260]  I mean, the BCC still has a list
[29:07.260 --> 29:08.660]  that comes out every two weeks
[29:08.660 --> 29:10.620]  and it's cleaned up tremendously,
[29:10.620 --> 29:15.620]  but it's not like it's eradicated.
[29:19.540 --> 29:22.020]  That being said, it's not always the farmer's fault.
[29:22.020 --> 29:25.220]  And I say this because out of all the batches
[29:25.220 --> 29:30.220]  of stuff that we tested, we only had failed once.
[29:31.220 --> 29:34.660]  And as a part of our own due diligence,
[29:34.660 --> 29:38.100]  that really stumped us because A, we know all these farmers,
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.580]  we visited the farms,
[29:39.580 --> 29:42.260]  we have like deep, meaningful relationships with them
[29:42.260 --> 29:44.700]  much beyond business, and there are friendships.
[29:44.700 --> 29:47.460]  And we knew that these farmers didn't participate
[29:47.460 --> 29:51.060]  in those kinds of practices.
[29:51.060 --> 29:54.180]  And so I remember we spent umpteen dollars
[29:54.180 --> 29:56.740]  because we kept thinking that the lab was wrong.
[29:57.580 --> 30:01.900]  And we sent out samples to multiple labs.
[30:01.900 --> 30:05.780]  And it was interesting that like two of the three labs
[30:05.780 --> 30:07.900]  that we had sent to didn't detect it,
[30:07.900 --> 30:09.460]  only one detected it.
[30:09.460 --> 30:12.820]  And we were so adamant about like knowing our farmers
[30:12.820 --> 30:16.380]  that they didn't spray these things
[30:16.380 --> 30:18.940]  that we were insisting that the lab was wrong.
[30:18.940 --> 30:22.060]  And so the lab held their ground and said,
[30:22.140 --> 30:23.620]  no, we're sure of our process.
[30:23.620 --> 30:26.940]  We know that like this is not working.
[30:26.940 --> 30:28.900]  And thankfully, we have great relationships
[30:28.900 --> 30:30.140]  with all the labs.
[30:30.140 --> 30:33.060]  And it was cool to get all the lab directors into a room
[30:33.060 --> 30:35.620]  where they discussed their tech.
[30:35.620 --> 30:37.700]  And the two other labs actually wound up admitting
[30:37.700 --> 30:40.060]  that their process was wrong.
[30:40.060 --> 30:42.220]  And they learned something out of that.
[30:42.220 --> 30:47.220]  And we found out sure enough that that one farmer had failed.
[30:47.500 --> 30:50.300]  And so then we took it even further.
[30:50.340 --> 30:54.140]  And started doing more research.
[30:54.140 --> 30:55.820]  And what we found out was that he was a victim
[30:55.820 --> 30:58.860]  of one of his neighbors spraying and catching some drift.
[31:00.060 --> 31:02.060]  And it wasn't on all of his plants.
[31:02.060 --> 31:02.900]  It was only on-
[31:02.900 --> 31:06.380]  Was his neighbor another agricultural crop producer
[31:06.380 --> 31:08.060]  or was he also a cannabis farmer?
[31:08.060 --> 31:10.100]  He was a cannabis farmer.
[31:10.100 --> 31:11.780]  He was a cannabis farmer who admitted
[31:11.780 --> 31:15.540]  to have spraying the substance that we had failed for.
[31:15.540 --> 31:18.660]  And a lot of our batches had come
[31:18.700 --> 31:22.420]  from this particular farmer and none of them had failed.
[31:22.420 --> 31:24.620]  So it was extra perplexing to us
[31:24.620 --> 31:26.700]  and kind of what was the motivating factor
[31:26.700 --> 31:29.620]  behind insisting that the lab was wrong.
[31:29.620 --> 31:34.420]  But again, due diligence showed, led us to the truth.
[31:34.420 --> 31:35.740]  And we found that out.
[31:35.740 --> 31:38.580]  So in long story short, sometimes when you're dealing
[31:38.580 --> 31:41.460]  with these kinds of things, it's not always the farmer's fault.
[31:41.460 --> 31:44.060]  There are factors that like farmers can't control.
[31:45.100 --> 31:46.660]  Drift is real, I get it.
[31:46.660 --> 31:48.180]  I mean, when I was hunting trim,
[31:48.700 --> 31:50.300]  if I saw grapes, I'd turn around
[31:50.300 --> 31:52.260]  because I knew it was gonna be,
[31:52.260 --> 31:56.020]  if I could see grapes visually from the driveway
[31:56.020 --> 31:59.620]  or from where the grow was, I hit a detect every time.
[31:59.620 --> 32:02.460]  I mean, there was no question about it.
[32:02.460 --> 32:05.380]  I mean, strawberries in some cases,
[32:05.380 --> 32:07.220]  when I was going through the Salinas Valley
[32:07.220 --> 32:09.620]  seemed to be safer than going near places
[32:09.620 --> 32:11.540]  in the hills that had grapes.
[32:11.540 --> 32:14.060]  And I would go to even organic farms
[32:14.060 --> 32:16.660]  that were surrounded by organic peppers
[32:16.660 --> 32:21.660]  and hundreds of acres of certified organic farms,
[32:22.460 --> 32:24.620]  but there were grapes in the distance on the hills.
[32:24.620 --> 32:26.460]  And sure enough, we'd pop a detect.
[32:26.460 --> 32:28.860]  And it got really difficult for a while,
[32:28.860 --> 32:32.260]  especially in 2018, because the drift was everywhere.
[32:32.260 --> 32:35.260]  And everybody was trying to get in where they could.
[32:35.260 --> 32:37.460]  And a lot of the places that allowed cannabis
[32:37.460 --> 32:41.300]  had conventional agricultural practices
[32:41.300 --> 32:44.460]  either right next door or formerly on the same site.
[32:45.460 --> 32:47.900]  Hey, Eric, aren't a lot of those grape growers
[32:47.900 --> 32:50.820]  also complaining about their cannabis neighbors?
[32:50.820 --> 32:52.140]  So what's up with that?
[32:52.140 --> 32:54.980]  Is the drift go both ways or what's going on?
[32:56.140 --> 32:59.140]  There's been studies done for traditional ag crops
[32:59.140 --> 33:01.180]  where they spray something in Salinas.
[33:01.180 --> 33:02.780]  And because it was a foggy day,
[33:02.780 --> 33:04.620]  that chemical goes all the way,
[33:04.620 --> 33:06.620]  travels all the way to Fresno.
[33:06.620 --> 33:09.700]  And there was actually a case that went down
[33:09.700 --> 33:12.220]  about that whole thing because there is liability.
[33:12.540 --> 33:16.900]  I mean, drift actually can cause liable actions at times.
[33:16.900 --> 33:18.940]  And so it gets kind of tricky.
[33:18.940 --> 33:20.300]  And I don't know a lot of lawsuits
[33:20.300 --> 33:22.500]  that are actually happening because of it.
[33:22.500 --> 33:24.940]  I think it might be harder to track down the normal,
[33:24.940 --> 33:27.420]  but the drift is just real.
[33:27.420 --> 33:30.740]  And you have to be able to plan ahead for that
[33:30.740 --> 33:32.460]  or figure out certain ways.
[33:32.460 --> 33:35.220]  The wells are contaminated in certain areas too.
[33:35.220 --> 33:38.380]  Traditional ag areas didn't have to have
[33:38.380 --> 33:40.540]  backflow prevention devices put on
[33:40.580 --> 33:42.980]  up until about 20 years ago.
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.060]  And in some cases, there's places that were using chloridane
[33:46.060 --> 33:47.660]  that was outlawed 30 years ago,
[33:47.660 --> 33:49.340]  but it still comes up in the well.
[33:49.340 --> 33:52.620]  And so, again, yeah, it isn't the farmer for everything,
[33:52.620 --> 33:54.860]  even though it was pretty easy to go to farms
[33:54.860 --> 33:58.140]  and find a bottle of Eagle 20 hiding in the corner
[33:58.140 --> 33:58.980]  at the end of the day.
[33:58.980 --> 34:01.340]  But even that eventually got cleaned up.
[34:01.340 --> 34:05.340]  But not a lot of people were doing micro extractions too
[34:05.340 --> 34:06.380]  to test the trim.
[34:06.380 --> 34:07.700]  A lot of people would buy trim
[34:07.700 --> 34:09.420]  and go on plant material tests
[34:09.420 --> 34:11.540]  and not actual oil tests.
[34:11.540 --> 34:15.100]  And so really, in 2018,
[34:15.100 --> 34:17.020]  I think was starting to be more of the time
[34:17.020 --> 34:19.020]  when people would do micro extractions
[34:19.020 --> 34:20.980]  before they would actually go buy the trim
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.700]  to find out what was in it.
[34:22.700 --> 34:27.500]  And then slowly after that, remediation has become a business.
[34:30.140 --> 34:31.620]  That's a really important point
[34:31.620 --> 34:36.460]  because in that example that I cited just now,
[34:36.460 --> 34:39.060]  where we involve the labs,
[34:39.700 --> 34:41.660]  we had test results from the actual flower
[34:41.660 --> 34:43.740]  and the flower didn't test.
[34:43.740 --> 34:47.740]  It was only in concentration that that drift did appear.
[34:52.780 --> 34:55.540]  Yeah, people would show me R&D tests all the time
[34:55.540 --> 34:57.500]  and it would be plant material on the top.
[34:57.500 --> 34:59.020]  And I could never really do anything
[34:59.020 --> 35:01.260]  with an R&D test from a farm
[35:01.260 --> 35:04.140]  without going out there and taking samples,
[35:04.140 --> 35:06.340]  sending it back to the place
[35:06.340 --> 35:07.900]  where it got the micro extraction
[35:07.900 --> 35:09.260]  and then that goes to the lab.
[35:09.260 --> 35:11.700]  And so it was really tricky for all the trim hunters
[35:11.740 --> 35:14.140]  in 2018 even,
[35:14.140 --> 35:15.780]  because it started getting real cutthroat
[35:15.780 --> 35:20.380]  where people were just going after trim like no tomorrow.
[35:20.380 --> 35:23.300]  And some people would COD
[35:23.300 --> 35:25.780]  or come pick up the trim based on an R&D,
[35:25.780 --> 35:26.980]  but then they'd wanna return it
[35:26.980 --> 35:28.420]  as soon as they started finding out
[35:28.420 --> 35:31.700]  that it was contaminated with something.
[35:31.700 --> 35:35.580]  And eventually people were okay with people taking samples
[35:35.580 --> 35:37.980]  and waiting two weeks to come back with the results
[35:37.980 --> 35:40.220]  to verify its cleanliness
[35:40.220 --> 35:41.740]  so that you could put a price on it.
[35:41.740 --> 35:44.740]  And depending on what had to be remediated or not,
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.980]  and how much THC was inside of that stuff
[35:48.980 --> 35:51.900]  dictated the price or the value of it.
[35:51.900 --> 35:55.740]  And it was really interesting to see
[35:55.740 --> 35:57.140]  because a lot of the labs
[35:57.140 --> 35:59.820]  wouldn't have the same exact results each time.
[35:59.820 --> 36:01.980]  So then the lab shopping on the legal side
[36:01.980 --> 36:03.460]  became really popular,
[36:04.380 --> 36:06.660]  as well as the category three kicking in
[36:06.700 --> 36:10.380]  and the heavy metals were really prevalent everywhere.
[36:10.380 --> 36:13.580]  But according to the people that make the oil,
[36:13.580 --> 36:15.020]  remediating the heavy metals
[36:15.020 --> 36:17.660]  is a lot easier than the other stuff.
[36:22.860 --> 36:27.860]  So just quickly, Sam, let's pick up with your story
[36:29.460 --> 36:34.060]  and then Ben, we'll go back to you from the top.
[36:34.060 --> 36:38.540]  But so in basically in 2018,
[36:38.580 --> 36:43.580]  it sounds like you put Aya to bed from your perspective.
[36:44.300 --> 36:45.500]  You walked away from it.
[36:45.500 --> 36:46.340]  I walked away.
[36:46.340 --> 36:48.220]  And then kind of what happens next?
[36:48.220 --> 36:49.940]  Because you weren't defeated.
[36:49.940 --> 36:53.060]  Yeah, and then my partner went to carry the torch
[36:54.180 --> 36:55.900]  for a little while in 2018.
[36:55.900 --> 37:00.740]  And then I think he gave it a nap.
[37:00.740 --> 37:02.580]  He may bring it back, to be honest.
[37:02.580 --> 37:05.820]  I know that he has all the marks, he has all the branding.
[37:06.020 --> 37:08.620]  I wouldn't doubt that he could have what it takes
[37:08.620 --> 37:10.540]  to actually bring the company back,
[37:10.540 --> 37:12.100]  which would be really cool to see
[37:12.100 --> 37:13.420]  whenever the timing is right,
[37:13.420 --> 37:15.660]  as we talk about how important that is.
[37:15.660 --> 37:16.980]  But yeah, I left that.
[37:18.900 --> 37:23.900]  Yeah, I got involved in a project to purchase,
[37:24.660 --> 37:27.980]  bought a vineyard in Northern Sonoma County,
[37:27.980 --> 37:29.460]  went to go put in permits on it
[37:29.460 --> 37:32.260]  to go back to my roots in cultivation.
[37:33.260 --> 37:36.700]  My neighbors are some really wealthy vineyard owners.
[37:36.700 --> 37:38.220]  They sued me, sued us.
[37:39.340 --> 37:41.180]  And I had it in our budget.
[37:41.180 --> 37:43.220]  So when we raised the capital and stuff,
[37:43.220 --> 37:45.540]  that we had enough money to sue ourselves into the permit.
[37:45.540 --> 37:46.860]  So I knew we were illegal.
[37:48.380 --> 37:50.140]  We were good because of what our zoning was,
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.740]  because I had previously done use permitting
[37:51.740 --> 37:53.140]  as a civil engineer.
[37:53.140 --> 37:57.660]  And then we realized that it just wasn't gonna be worth it
[37:57.660 --> 37:58.580]  for what it was.
[37:59.580 --> 38:02.660]  And we sold the property for a nice little return
[38:02.660 --> 38:03.900]  on a one-year investment.
[38:05.180 --> 38:09.980]  But yeah, that was like we sold that in August 18.
[38:11.380 --> 38:13.380]  And was that to someone else
[38:13.380 --> 38:15.780]  who had the intent of growing cannabis on it
[38:15.780 --> 38:16.620]  or a different purpose?
[38:16.620 --> 38:17.460]  No.
[38:17.460 --> 38:18.300]  Okay.
[38:18.300 --> 38:21.540]  I'm sure it's a large second home
[38:21.540 --> 38:24.260]  to some tech pro at this point.
[38:24.860 --> 38:26.500]  And then I, late 18,
[38:27.860 --> 38:29.580]  was just doing a lot of consulting for different people.
[38:29.580 --> 38:32.460]  What I really specialized in and I still do
[38:32.460 --> 38:34.540]  is because I've spent so much time
[38:34.540 --> 38:35.620]  doing real estate development,
[38:35.620 --> 38:37.740]  I can like walk on a piece of property
[38:37.740 --> 38:39.500]  and tell you basically how much it's gonna cost
[38:39.500 --> 38:40.620]  to get a project done there
[38:40.620 --> 38:42.100]  and how long it's gonna take and how much money.
[38:42.100 --> 38:43.740]  Because what it is now is like,
[38:43.740 --> 38:45.700]  how quick can you get your return on your investment?
[38:45.700 --> 38:47.580]  And then how quick you can scale that property
[38:47.580 --> 38:51.340]  and what's the total lifetime economic viability.
[38:51.780 --> 38:54.260]  And so I was doing a lot of consulting on that
[38:54.260 --> 38:58.260]  and also aided helping a lot of other people get investment.
[38:58.260 --> 39:00.900]  And so then I went to work for a private equity firm
[39:00.900 --> 39:02.620]  on the investment side.
[39:02.620 --> 39:07.620]  And I just left there in February of 2020.
[39:08.300 --> 39:10.540]  And that was cannabis investments or?
[39:10.540 --> 39:12.020]  Yeah, I mean, they're involved
[39:12.020 --> 39:14.180]  in a lot of different investments.
[39:14.180 --> 39:16.900]  It was software fund, biotech fund,
[39:16.900 --> 39:18.700]  they played around in the cannabis industry.
[39:18.860 --> 39:20.660]  And then they also have a software fund, biotech fund,
[39:20.660 --> 39:23.580]  they played around in crypto and blockchain.
[39:23.580 --> 39:25.180]  But I aided in vetting
[39:25.180 --> 39:28.780]  and working on their entire cannabis investment strategy.
[39:29.860 --> 39:32.420]  And what was the strategy you developed
[39:32.420 --> 39:33.820]  from an investor?
[39:33.820 --> 39:35.700]  Essentially putting together a lot of people
[39:35.700 --> 39:37.220]  that do the best thing at what they do
[39:37.220 --> 39:40.260]  into a centralized vertically integrated company,
[39:40.260 --> 39:41.980]  which at the end of 18,
[39:41.980 --> 39:44.980]  the way that we did our investment strategies
[39:45.540 --> 39:49.220]  from the capital market side was pretty interesting.
[39:49.220 --> 39:53.980]  And eventually we got caught in the capital crunch
[39:53.980 --> 39:55.740]  in late 19.
[39:55.740 --> 40:00.740]  And that actually, they put a lot of money out,
[40:00.900 --> 40:03.460]  what they refer to as deal money.
[40:03.460 --> 40:07.380]  And then ultimately did not tranche in the millions
[40:07.380 --> 40:09.620]  that they were going to at the end of last year.
[40:09.620 --> 40:13.140]  So that's a big part of why I left in February.
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.460]  So I've read a couple of recent articles
[40:16.460 --> 40:19.260]  that investors of that scale
[40:19.260 --> 40:21.140]  are kind of huddled on the sidelines,
[40:21.140 --> 40:23.180]  saving up their money,
[40:23.180 --> 40:25.100]  building up coffers to come in
[40:25.100 --> 40:29.380]  and buy stuff up pennies on the dollar.
[40:29.380 --> 40:30.740]  Is that what you're saying?
[40:31.980 --> 40:33.580]  No, well, yes and no.
[40:33.580 --> 40:36.620]  There's a lot of distressed asset investors out there.
[40:36.620 --> 40:38.860]  It's more along the side of like the way
[40:38.860 --> 40:40.620]  that a lot of investment works.
[40:40.660 --> 40:43.980]  Like a lot of times you don't want partners, right?
[40:43.980 --> 40:45.980]  You just want to do a deal all by yourself.
[40:45.980 --> 40:47.300]  You're in a hundred percent control.
[40:47.300 --> 40:48.580]  You have no one to answer to.
[40:48.580 --> 40:51.940]  It's just you and your decisions.
[40:51.940 --> 40:54.740]  But that's not really a very good strategy.
[40:54.740 --> 40:58.420]  A really good strategy is to diversify your risk.
[40:58.420 --> 41:00.380]  Make sure you get buy-in on valuation.
[41:00.380 --> 41:02.020]  So you're not coming in on an investment
[41:02.020 --> 41:04.340]  at too high of a valuation or too low of a valuation
[41:04.340 --> 41:05.340]  that's fair.
[41:05.340 --> 41:09.420]  You're coming in in something that's a verified valuation
[41:09.420 --> 41:13.620]  between two or three other institutional,
[41:13.620 --> 41:15.460]  whether it's private equity family offices
[41:15.460 --> 41:17.860]  or actual institutional investors.
[41:17.860 --> 41:20.500]  And then you guys all tranch in together
[41:20.500 --> 41:23.180]  to raise the capital that's required.
[41:23.180 --> 41:25.260]  And not only does that pool,
[41:25.260 --> 41:26.340]  not just capital resources,
[41:26.340 --> 41:28.500]  it pulls network resources.
[41:28.500 --> 41:32.780]  It pulls everybody into the same ship to all row together.
[41:32.780 --> 41:36.100]  And that was the strategy we were working under.
[41:36.540 --> 41:40.860]  And ultimately what you're hoping that everyone agrees
[41:40.860 --> 41:42.180]  to the same valuation.
[41:42.180 --> 41:44.820]  And that was near impossible at the end of last year.
[41:46.700 --> 41:47.940]  Distressed assets.
[41:47.940 --> 41:48.780]  Yes.
[41:48.780 --> 41:49.980]  The one problem that people don't realize
[41:49.980 --> 41:52.300]  about distressed assets is that,
[41:52.300 --> 41:55.100]  a lot of people are trying to sell licenses right now.
[41:55.100 --> 41:57.340]  And when people say, what is a license worth?
[41:58.300 --> 42:01.060]  I usually say 50% of whatever the lease is.
[42:02.340 --> 42:05.260]  Because the problem is that when you say you have a lease,
[42:05.300 --> 42:07.700]  it's like, or you have a license.
[42:07.700 --> 42:09.140]  Well, if you own that property,
[42:09.140 --> 42:11.500]  there's carrying capacity to that.
[42:11.500 --> 42:14.020]  If you have a lease, then you just have to,
[42:14.020 --> 42:17.780]  like for instance, if you have a distribution license
[42:17.780 --> 42:20.260]  and your overhead is 150 grand a year
[42:20.260 --> 42:22.940]  just to keep the lights on,
[42:22.940 --> 42:24.140]  well, what do you have to make?
[42:24.140 --> 42:27.140]  How much gross revenue would you have to have per year
[42:27.140 --> 42:28.740]  in order to keep those lights on?
[42:28.740 --> 42:30.060]  About 3 million probably,
[42:31.020 --> 42:33.500]  just to get your margin to then pay your rent.
[42:33.500 --> 42:35.100]  You know what I mean?
[42:35.940 --> 42:38.180]  So at that point, then you're trying to stand up
[42:38.180 --> 42:41.540]  instantly at 3 million annual revenue in business
[42:41.540 --> 42:43.940]  within a year, which isn't hard to do
[42:43.940 --> 42:44.980]  if you have a whole lot of flowers
[42:44.980 --> 42:46.860]  and you're good at what you do.
[42:46.860 --> 42:48.180]  But if you're an investor
[42:48.180 --> 42:50.100]  and you have no idea what you're doing,
[42:50.100 --> 42:52.700]  you're gonna lose, 100%, you're gonna lose.
[42:52.700 --> 42:54.620]  More investors have lost money in cannabis
[42:54.620 --> 42:57.620]  than what they've made outside of the public markets.
[42:57.620 --> 42:58.980]  But on the private investment side,
[42:58.980 --> 43:01.660]  it's pretty much been all losses from what I've seen.
[43:04.950 --> 43:05.790]  Got it.
[43:05.790 --> 43:07.910]  Okay, so in February,
[43:07.910 --> 43:10.830]  you basically leave the investment firm
[43:10.830 --> 43:13.790]  and kind of, I assume we're now up to
[43:13.790 --> 43:15.630]  what you're currently doing.
[43:15.630 --> 43:17.990]  So do you wanna talk about what you're doing
[43:17.990 --> 43:19.350]  and your vision?
[43:19.350 --> 43:22.310]  The puzzle you're putting together for your business?
[43:22.310 --> 43:24.390]  Yeah, so one of my strategies
[43:24.390 --> 43:26.430]  since I've learned a lot of really hard lessons
[43:26.430 --> 43:28.270]  over the last five years,
[43:28.270 --> 43:29.630]  I always keep like two or things,
[43:29.630 --> 43:32.110]  just like two or three consulting projects,
[43:32.110 --> 43:35.070]  opportunities always like in the background.
[43:35.110 --> 43:38.750]  So if whatever's happening at the moment is not working out,
[43:38.750 --> 43:41.430]  there's always something to fall back on.
[43:41.430 --> 43:43.870]  Usually, sometimes it takes two, three, four, five months
[43:43.870 --> 43:45.670]  until that next thing comes along.
[43:45.670 --> 43:49.630]  But in cannabis, it's really hard to
[43:49.630 --> 43:51.990]  just be all in on one thing.
[43:51.990 --> 43:55.590]  And now I'm going all in on one thing.
[43:56.430 --> 43:59.430]  But yeah, I was consulting towards the end of last year
[43:59.430 --> 44:02.990]  always on some very large cultivation stuff
[44:03.790 --> 44:06.910]  and really trying to gain that kind of mid-market gap
[44:06.910 --> 44:10.550]  that we're seeing in the flower market.
[44:10.550 --> 44:12.710]  And the flower market,
[44:12.710 --> 44:15.230]  like when you look at data right now,
[44:15.230 --> 44:18.630]  it's totally subjective to your understanding
[44:18.630 --> 44:22.350]  of what and how big the black market is.
[44:22.350 --> 44:24.310]  Because when you look at right now,
[44:24.310 --> 44:28.150]  it looks like flowers are dwindling in market share
[44:28.150 --> 44:30.990]  comparative to vapes, edibles,
[44:31.030 --> 44:34.270]  the rest of new product developments and such.
[44:34.270 --> 44:35.990]  But if you take the black market,
[44:35.990 --> 44:38.230]  if you just rolled the black market data
[44:38.230 --> 44:39.750]  into the white market,
[44:39.750 --> 44:41.350]  flowers would still be just an absolutely
[44:41.350 --> 44:45.030]  massive market share, over 50% by far.
[44:45.030 --> 44:49.390]  And so there is, as we go on to conquer the black market,
[44:49.390 --> 44:51.870]  which we will not do through enforcement.
[44:51.870 --> 44:56.350]  Just quickly, you're saying
[44:56.350 --> 44:58.510]  there's not a huge black market edibles?
[44:59.510 --> 45:01.790]  There is, but it pales in comparison
[45:01.790 --> 45:06.790]  to the flower black market.
[45:13.290 --> 45:16.010]  The one side about that is that
[45:16.890 --> 45:19.930]  as quality and price,
[45:19.930 --> 45:21.650]  I've always said in cannabis,
[45:21.650 --> 45:23.050]  the one thing you will never change,
[45:23.050 --> 45:24.970]  you can regulate, you can tax,
[45:24.970 --> 45:26.170]  you can do this or that.
[45:26.170 --> 45:28.170]  The one thing you can never change
[45:28.450 --> 45:31.730]  is the amount of money that's in your consumer's pocket.
[45:32.770 --> 45:36.650]  And because of that, until there's quality cannabis
[45:36.650 --> 45:38.090]  at the right price point,
[45:38.090 --> 45:41.690]  a lot of variety available in a convenient location,
[45:43.010 --> 45:45.810]  that's the only way you actually tackle the black market.
[45:46.810 --> 45:49.250]  So from my standpoint,
[45:49.250 --> 45:51.450]  if you can scale through the mid-market flowers,
[45:51.450 --> 45:52.930]  not the low end, not the high,
[45:52.930 --> 45:54.970]  like the high light assisted greenhouse
[45:54.970 --> 45:57.330]  that Eric's probably producing,
[45:58.290 --> 45:59.250]  a lot of that's really good,
[45:59.250 --> 46:00.810]  and I would love to smoke some,
[46:01.850 --> 46:04.490]  but more that mid-market,
[46:04.490 --> 46:06.970]  above like bottom barrel outdoor,
[46:06.970 --> 46:10.370]  which there's just gonna be endless amounts of this fall.
[46:12.210 --> 46:15.010]  Can you define your terms with like maybe price points
[46:15.010 --> 46:17.170]  or something so that we can?
[46:17.170 --> 46:20.930]  Yeah, I think right now we're in the middle of the drought.
[46:20.930 --> 46:22.050]  I think it's a drought that like,
[46:22.050 --> 46:24.890]  I can't believe how bad the drought is right now.
[46:24.890 --> 46:25.730]  I don't know if you got,
[46:25.890 --> 46:29.570]  Bam or Eric can acknowledge how bad the drought is right now.
[46:29.570 --> 46:31.090]  It's rough.
[46:31.090 --> 46:32.530]  On the black or the white?
[46:33.450 --> 46:34.610]  Both.
[46:34.610 --> 46:35.450]  Right.
[46:37.250 --> 46:38.810]  I think there's more on the licensed
[46:38.810 --> 46:41.010]  than there is on the unlicensed.
[46:41.010 --> 46:42.730]  I mean, even though they're both in a drought,
[46:42.730 --> 46:46.410]  I think the severity of the black market right now
[46:46.410 --> 46:51.010]  is worse off than the licensed.
[46:51.010 --> 46:52.690]  No, I'd agree.
[46:52.690 --> 46:54.490]  I would 100% agree.
[46:55.450 --> 46:57.970]  Yeah, so there's, as far as quality,
[46:57.970 --> 47:02.970]  I'm talking about like 23 to 27% THC,
[47:03.490 --> 47:07.210]  light green color, decent nug size.
[47:07.210 --> 47:12.210]  What would be selling right now on the legal market?
[47:12.250 --> 47:14.890]  Probably between like 900 and 1200.
[47:16.650 --> 47:19.050]  That market space, and then,
[47:19.050 --> 47:20.850]  and that's gonna, this fall,
[47:20.850 --> 47:22.890]  that's gonna drop and it'll probably be somewhere
[47:22.890 --> 47:26.250]  between like 500 and 900 or so,
[47:26.250 --> 47:30.810]  something based on strain and furthermore inequality.
[47:30.810 --> 47:32.730]  But then you have like all the really low end
[47:32.730 --> 47:34.810]  where there's not even a strain name on the back
[47:34.810 --> 47:39.650]  and that stuff's going for 250 to 450.
[47:41.290 --> 47:44.090]  Which becomes the gamble at the retail side
[47:44.090 --> 47:46.210]  because then you're getting $25 aids
[47:46.210 --> 47:47.410]  that you can't see through.
[47:47.410 --> 47:49.730]  There's no sample to smell or anything.
[47:49.770 --> 47:54.330]  And so people are really pulling the gambling handle there
[47:54.330 --> 47:56.330]  on what they're gonna get when they get back.
[47:56.330 --> 47:59.690]  And unfortunately the consumers are burned,
[47:59.690 --> 48:04.570]  but the level of wanting to find good weed never stops.
[48:04.570 --> 48:08.930]  And so they just keep chasing down those cheap aids
[48:08.930 --> 48:11.490]  till they find a sweet one, basically,
[48:11.490 --> 48:13.010]  is what it looks like to me.
[48:13.010 --> 48:18.010]  Because the $75 stuff is really,
[48:18.330 --> 48:20.850]  I mean, a special market.
[48:20.850 --> 48:24.250]  Yeah, and honestly, this year we're seeing
[48:24.250 --> 48:28.090]  so many massive light assisted greenhouses come online
[48:28.090 --> 48:31.730]  and so many really, really good indoor growers
[48:31.730 --> 48:34.810]  that started on their projects two and a half years ago
[48:34.810 --> 48:36.970]  and they're finally turning the lights on right now
[48:36.970 --> 48:38.330]  because believe it or not,
[48:38.330 --> 48:40.970]  if you wanna open a 500 light grow,
[48:40.970 --> 48:42.890]  that's probably about how long it's gonna take
[48:42.890 --> 48:44.650]  from inception to real estate acquisition
[48:44.650 --> 48:46.770]  to turning your lights on and getting your first crop,
[48:46.810 --> 48:49.010]  probably two and a half to three years.
[48:49.010 --> 48:51.770]  And so we're gonna see,
[48:53.570 --> 48:56.890]  I do not envy the folks that are turning on 500 lights
[48:56.890 --> 48:59.810]  of indoor and hoping to get premium,
[49:01.170 --> 49:04.490]  26 to 3,200 a pound for exotics this fall.
[49:04.490 --> 49:06.570]  I don't envy those people at all.
[49:07.410 --> 49:09.970]  And these mega facilities have some stumbling blocks.
[49:09.970 --> 49:12.650]  I mean, it takes however long to set up,
[49:12.650 --> 49:14.410]  like you're saying and turn on the lights,
[49:14.410 --> 49:17.410]  but then it takes a good amount of the same time
[49:17.410 --> 49:18.850]  to really get their feet wet
[49:18.850 --> 49:22.730]  and get through some of those learning curves basically.
[49:22.730 --> 49:25.810]  There's not a lot of people in the greenhouse world
[49:25.810 --> 49:28.330]  that know how to run those big mega facilities
[49:28.330 --> 49:33.330]  and it comes with some painful learning curves basically.
[49:34.210 --> 49:36.570]  A lot of them, what I see do good on the first run
[49:36.570 --> 49:39.210]  cause everything's kind of clean first shot,
[49:39.210 --> 49:41.730]  but by the time it gets to the second
[49:41.770 --> 49:44.890]  and trying to facilitate their own propagation,
[49:44.890 --> 49:46.450]  there's just the learning curves
[49:46.450 --> 49:48.490]  just come from the left and the right.
[49:48.490 --> 49:51.450]  And then these mega facilities that aren't used to
[49:51.450 --> 49:54.050]  the pest pressure and pathogen pressure that comes up,
[49:54.050 --> 49:58.450]  it just, man, so I mean, in a lot of ways
[49:58.450 --> 50:01.170]  it takes some time before they're really gonna
[50:01.170 --> 50:03.370]  saturate the market let's say.
[50:03.370 --> 50:07.050]  So Eric, do you think that cloning will,
[50:07.050 --> 50:09.250]  like in the grape industry,
[50:09.250 --> 50:12.690]  there's not a single large vineyard manager or owner
[50:12.690 --> 50:14.730]  that actually does their own propagation.
[50:15.810 --> 50:18.930]  And they've tried and they have their own glass facilities.
[50:18.930 --> 50:22.570]  They have their own French oak forests for their burials,
[50:22.570 --> 50:24.970]  but the one thing they do not do
[50:24.970 --> 50:27.570]  is they do not do their own clones.
[50:27.570 --> 50:31.610]  And I'm wondering if we're gonna see in cannabis,
[50:31.610 --> 50:34.330]  anybody like in the end, say 10 years from now
[50:34.330 --> 50:36.930]  when it starts to level out and be steady state
[50:36.930 --> 50:40.530]  and really mature, is it all gonna be outsourced cloning?
[50:40.530 --> 50:43.250]  Is anyone gonna take their own clones?
[50:43.250 --> 50:44.170]  That's a good question.
[50:44.170 --> 50:46.170]  I mean, the virus has a lot to do with that.
[50:46.170 --> 50:48.010]  It's not just pests and pathogens,
[50:48.010 --> 50:51.610]  the actual gutting or virus that occurs
[50:51.610 --> 50:55.010]  is a big knock in the teeth for people
[50:55.010 --> 50:56.450]  that are trying to do it themselves.
[50:56.450 --> 50:58.330]  But if you look at, like you said,
[50:58.330 --> 51:01.170]  grapes or if you look at strawberries,
[51:01.170 --> 51:04.370]  I mean, strawberry producers don't make
[51:04.410 --> 51:07.290]  their own strawberries and those are all tissue culture
[51:07.290 --> 51:08.690]  because of the viruses.
[51:08.690 --> 51:11.290]  And they don't really try to figure out
[51:11.290 --> 51:12.810]  what virus it actually has.
[51:12.810 --> 51:15.850]  They don't give a lot of virus names to strawberries.
[51:15.850 --> 51:17.410]  They just clean it up and move on.
[51:17.410 --> 51:21.530]  There's not gonna be this eradication of things.
[51:21.530 --> 51:24.810]  And that's what a lot of these bigger producers in cannabis
[51:24.810 --> 51:28.010]  that don't have big scale people on their team
[51:28.970 --> 51:32.130]  understand basically is that the eradication,
[51:32.130 --> 51:33.210]  it doesn't exist.
[51:33.250 --> 51:34.810]  It's more of a control factor.
[51:34.810 --> 51:39.290]  And so the nursery does potentially have a lot of that
[51:39.290 --> 51:41.650]  can be factored in, but at the same time,
[51:41.650 --> 51:44.210]  the nurseries are also spreading a lot of the problems
[51:44.210 --> 51:47.450]  that are really hard to deal with.
[51:47.450 --> 51:51.570]  And so relationships matter in who you're working with,
[51:51.570 --> 51:55.210]  but there's gotta be more tissue culture at a bigger scale
[51:55.210 --> 51:58.170]  that is more affordable at the same time.
[51:58.170 --> 51:59.890]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[51:59.890 --> 52:01.650]  I think the only thing I would mention
[52:01.650 --> 52:05.250]  is that I don't think any nursery is gonna survive
[52:05.250 --> 52:08.650]  that also doesn't have like a 10 or 20,000 square foot
[52:08.650 --> 52:11.330]  light depth on site assisted,
[52:11.330 --> 52:14.370]  because I just noticed that when you go to the nurseries
[52:14.370 --> 52:17.650]  that don't actually flower any of their own product out,
[52:19.730 --> 52:21.410]  their understanding of what's going on
[52:21.410 --> 52:23.970]  is massively lower than those that do.
[52:23.970 --> 52:25.690]  They don't have enough clones.
[52:25.690 --> 52:27.610]  They can't sell enough without,
[52:27.610 --> 52:29.210]  spring is the hot time,
[52:29.210 --> 52:31.730]  spring and second run depths or whatever.
[52:31.730 --> 52:33.170]  And so as you go into winter time,
[52:33.170 --> 52:37.010]  when you have that many people shutting down for the season,
[52:37.010 --> 52:38.650]  the output just isn't there.
[52:38.650 --> 52:41.610]  So basically they have to throw in some flowers,
[52:41.610 --> 52:44.490]  but eventually when they get some good relationships
[52:44.490 --> 52:46.330]  going with some of these bigger facilities
[52:46.330 --> 52:50.090]  and things do kind of narrow down, like you're saying,
[52:50.090 --> 52:54.250]  and if we look into our glass ball or whatever and say,
[52:54.250 --> 52:56.610]  yeah, maybe the future is nurseries
[52:56.610 --> 52:58.210]  supplying these bigger facilities
[52:58.210 --> 53:01.250]  that do go year round, they do have a shot,
[53:01.250 --> 53:04.610]  but again, we're just not there yet.
[53:04.610 --> 53:06.570]  Yeah, one of my good friends.
[53:07.970 --> 53:09.810]  Sorry, go ahead, Vim.
[53:09.810 --> 53:11.250]  So I think that's where a great place
[53:11.250 --> 53:13.570]  where room for breeders exist,
[53:13.570 --> 53:16.290]  because right now we have a lot of strains
[53:16.290 --> 53:17.530]  that aren't stable.
[53:17.530 --> 53:20.570]  It's like people are just crossing two different strains.
[53:20.570 --> 53:23.410]  They haven't been IBL, they haven't been in bread line.
[53:23.410 --> 53:26.730]  So I think give it five years from now
[53:26.770 --> 53:28.610]  with a real focus on breeding
[53:28.610 --> 53:31.890]  and stabilizing important characteristics and traits,
[53:31.890 --> 53:34.490]  and you can have a uniform seed crop
[53:34.490 --> 53:38.850]  that produces a plant that's consistent enough
[53:40.570 --> 53:43.690]  to be put into the same bags for consumers,
[53:43.690 --> 53:46.370]  has characteristics like traits,
[53:47.370 --> 53:48.970]  like smell,
[53:51.930 --> 53:55.050]  bag appeal and all that, isolated and locked.
[53:55.050 --> 53:57.210]  I think that becomes the more sustainable
[53:57.210 --> 54:00.770]  and long-term method.
[54:00.770 --> 54:02.610]  You don't have to worry about viruses as much.
[54:02.610 --> 54:04.770]  You don't have to worry about pest as much.
[54:04.770 --> 54:07.650]  And in terms of cost of production,
[54:07.650 --> 54:09.570]  you can't beat that, right?
[54:09.570 --> 54:12.890]  Yeah, one of the only, and I agree with you,
[54:12.890 --> 54:15.530]  I think that one of the only issues,
[54:15.530 --> 54:17.290]  and I saw this spring as I've been trying to figure out
[54:17.290 --> 54:19.290]  what I'm gonna cultivate this summer,
[54:19.290 --> 54:23.570]  and is that even if you have two or three phenotypes
[54:24.010 --> 54:25.650]  in a seed stock,
[54:26.690 --> 54:29.530]  if you are not extremely on it
[54:29.530 --> 54:32.850]  with flagging those and harvesting together,
[54:32.850 --> 54:34.650]  you can actually fail the VOA
[54:34.650 --> 54:36.890]  for being focused back on the seed content.
[54:38.290 --> 54:40.170]  And so it's one of those things where,
[54:41.370 --> 54:44.570]  like for instance, if you're doing 18 different phenotypes
[54:44.570 --> 54:46.450]  or 18 different cultivars,
[54:46.450 --> 54:48.730]  and you're doing half of those seeds or all seed,
[54:48.730 --> 54:50.610]  all of a sudden you have 100 phenotypes
[54:50.650 --> 54:52.370]  and trying to,
[54:52.370 --> 54:56.610]  what logistical supply chain standpoint of harvesting,
[54:56.610 --> 54:59.810]  curing, and taking to market 100 phenotypes
[54:59.810 --> 55:02.410]  is like, I can't even imagine how difficult that would be.
[55:02.410 --> 55:05.650]  So it's a, if we can get to that point in five years,
[55:05.650 --> 55:06.890]  I cannot wait for that moment
[55:06.890 --> 55:09.410]  because I'd much rather be growing seed than clumb
[55:09.410 --> 55:11.290]  from a cultivator standpoint.
[55:12.610 --> 55:13.930]  One thing I wanna mention too,
[55:13.930 --> 55:15.050]  so one of my good friends
[55:15.050 --> 55:18.770]  is one of the largest great nursery in California,
[55:18.770 --> 55:22.930]  and they have 400 acres of every one of their varietals.
[55:22.930 --> 55:25.650]  So they like have a 400 acre vineyard management
[55:25.650 --> 55:26.810]  and they have every single varietal
[55:26.810 --> 55:29.810]  that they sell as a clone, just as a tender.
[55:29.810 --> 55:31.850]  So you can actually see them all being grown.
[55:31.850 --> 55:32.690]  You can see the grapes.
[55:32.690 --> 55:34.970]  You can actually get a bottle of wine from those grapes.
[55:34.970 --> 55:35.890]  And, but they don't,
[55:35.890 --> 55:37.370]  those 400 acres of vineyard management,
[55:37.370 --> 55:39.570]  they don't, that's not for selling those grapes.
[55:39.570 --> 55:41.850]  That's actually just for selling their clones.
[55:41.850 --> 55:43.290]  So I think it's gonna be interesting to see,
[55:43.290 --> 55:47.250]  like I wanna see a large nursery that is,
[55:47.250 --> 55:48.370]  is coordinating off an area
[55:48.370 --> 55:50.890]  so that you can see everything growing while you're,
[55:50.890 --> 55:51.810]  you know, and that is a place
[55:51.810 --> 55:54.130]  where breeders could really excel in that way.
[55:55.970 --> 55:57.570]  Yeah.
[55:57.570 --> 56:01.650]  And I think that five years is the realistic target,
[56:01.650 --> 56:04.370]  but a lot of that also depends on the regulatory framework.
[56:04.370 --> 56:06.410]  What has kept breeders thus far
[56:06.410 --> 56:07.890]  from producing that kind of seeds
[56:07.890 --> 56:10.570]  is plant counts and canopy size.
[56:10.570 --> 56:13.730]  And those are the things that breeders need as tools.
[56:13.770 --> 56:16.850]  They need volume because breeding is a statistics game.
[56:17.850 --> 56:21.490]  And so the more space and canopy that's available
[56:22.410 --> 56:27.410]  to breeders, the sooner we're gonna arrive at that point.
[56:27.570 --> 56:28.410]  Yeah.
[56:29.410 --> 56:31.890]  I can't say that I see the regulatory hurdles
[56:31.890 --> 56:33.330]  going away anytime.
[56:33.330 --> 56:35.210]  No, I'm honestly like,
[56:35.210 --> 56:37.770]  I don't know what is gonna happen with federal legalization,
[56:37.770 --> 56:41.690]  but it's probably gonna be another 3000 pages of regulations.
[56:44.290 --> 56:47.370]  That's also kind of why I've made the pivot towards hemp.
[56:48.970 --> 56:49.810]  Because of-
[56:49.810 --> 56:50.810]  Wait, don't go there.
[56:50.810 --> 56:52.490]  Wait, we're gonna get to that.
[56:52.490 --> 56:54.210]  Cause I wanna give you a long,
[56:54.210 --> 56:56.570]  like plenty of time to talk about it.
[56:56.570 --> 56:57.610]  So let's, all right.
[56:57.610 --> 57:00.890]  So we're gonna get to your pivot, but,
[57:00.890 --> 57:05.290]  so Sam, it seems like you're going after kind of like
[57:05.290 --> 57:10.290]  the 20% of consumers who smoke 80% of the flower
[57:10.770 --> 57:14.650]  and are looking for value and at least good enough quality.
[57:14.650 --> 57:17.450]  I mean, obviously everybody would love to smoke
[57:17.450 --> 57:22.450]  the most premium, but it's an affordability issue.
[57:22.690 --> 57:26.330]  Yeah. I mean, what I'm going for is unfortunately
[57:26.330 --> 57:29.410]  coming to the realization that quality doesn't
[57:29.410 --> 57:31.930]  equal business success, unfortunately.
[57:31.930 --> 57:35.490]  So it's, we're gonna,
[57:35.490 --> 57:37.890]  and so we're growing a lot of product
[57:37.930 --> 57:41.810]  and I wanna grow the very best product I can,
[57:41.810 --> 57:44.970]  but I also need to keep my cost of goods extremely low
[57:44.970 --> 57:46.770]  and be competitive in the marketplace.
[57:46.770 --> 57:49.730]  And so we're doing 100% native soil,
[57:49.730 --> 57:52.450]  not using a single bit of import soil
[57:52.450 --> 57:53.850]  and using almost all,
[57:53.850 --> 57:56.530]  trying to do all biologicals, 100% organic,
[57:56.530 --> 58:00.130]  and really just shooting for an extremely low cost of goods
[58:01.050 --> 58:03.170]  in order to meet a good quality product
[58:03.170 --> 58:06.690]  and try to hit, try to hit two and a half percent terbians.
[58:06.690 --> 58:09.050]  Okay. And so I don't know if you already said it,
[58:09.050 --> 58:12.290]  but where are you building out a facility
[58:12.290 --> 58:15.330]  and how big, how many acres?
[58:15.330 --> 58:18.530]  We're, we just got our state licenses last week.
[58:19.490 --> 58:20.370]  We're up in Lake County.
[58:20.370 --> 58:22.570]  Lake County is allowing a lot of cultivation
[58:22.570 --> 58:23.650]  going on up there.
[58:24.610 --> 58:27.130]  And yeah, we're doing some,
[58:27.130 --> 58:29.850]  we'll see exactly how many acres we do this year,
[58:29.850 --> 58:32.210]  but it'll be over three.
[58:33.210 --> 58:37.370]  And that gets back to your business viability
[58:37.370 --> 58:41.610]  that you need to be of a certain scale to succeed.
[58:41.610 --> 58:44.010]  Yeah. You need to be of a certain scale
[58:44.010 --> 58:48.410]  and you need to, you need to treat it like an ag business
[58:48.410 --> 58:50.010]  and not like a cannabis farm.
[58:51.530 --> 58:53.250]  And in order to do that,
[58:53.250 --> 58:58.250]  you need to really analyze every input you're doing
[58:59.090 --> 59:02.290]  and not be willing to change.
[59:02.290 --> 59:03.210]  Like, I think the biggest thing
[59:03.210 --> 59:05.450]  is being willing to change your mind.
[59:05.450 --> 59:08.130]  I started out as an indoor hydro grower.
[59:08.130 --> 59:11.690]  I went to indoor veganics.
[59:11.690 --> 59:15.010]  Then I went to outdoor organics
[59:15.010 --> 59:20.090]  and I went to kind of more conventional light depth
[59:20.090 --> 59:22.210]  and then all organic outdoor.
[59:22.210 --> 59:24.650]  And we're going to stick with all organic outdoor now.
[59:31.020 --> 59:32.300]  Okay. Sorry.
[59:32.300 --> 59:34.540]  We got family at home.
[59:35.540 --> 59:37.820]  So where we're catching you is,
[59:37.820 --> 59:40.300]  and I remember when I last spoke to you,
[59:40.300 --> 59:43.620]  you were shopping nurseries for I think, what?
[59:43.620 --> 59:45.460]  40,000 clones.
[59:45.460 --> 59:49.940]  And so did you pick up your babies?
[59:49.940 --> 59:52.220]  No, I haven't yet.
[59:52.220 --> 59:55.580]  I honestly, what I like,
[59:55.580 --> 59:58.020]  actually it's funny how like TG Genetics,
[59:58.020 --> 59:58.860]  maybe it was Beard Bros.
[59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.020]  I can't remember the art of the pivot.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.940]  So like what I thought I was going to do in January,
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.260]  I'm not doing.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.460]  And what I thought I was going to do a month ago,
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.620]  I'm also not doing.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.260]  So can you tell us what you thought
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.660]  you were going to do in January
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.220]  and then what you thought you were going to do last month?
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.620]  I thought I was going to do like almost all seed in January.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.500]  And then last month I thought I was going to do
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.140]  half seed, half clone.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.980]  And I had my full 18 different cultivars
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.100]  that I was going to do.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.580]  And now I'm not going to do either one of those things.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.740]  I have to ask, is it finances,
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.740]  but also other factors that are influencing your decisions?
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.940]  I mean, it's just real-time market data.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.380]  Seeing what everyone else is doing
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.860]  and really it's all like,
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.980]  it's like looking at all of the competition and jockeying
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.380]  to make sure that you're not going to be screwed
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.140]  in December and January,
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.260]  because it's not that far away.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.140]  And I was going to do a couple,
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.260]  maybe going to do a whole bunch of autos.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.140]  And now I'm seeing everybody grow autos
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.220]  and have no dry space and the auto market's going to crash.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.820]  And so it's interesting to see.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.700]  And there's a bunch of people that already have,
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.340]  they're going to hit their cost of goods
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.340]  and they already have their supply contracts set up
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.700]  and they're going to be fine doing their autos,
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.020]  but I don't have those set up.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.660]  So I'm not going to do autos.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.420]  And so it's just interesting to see what,
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.660]  I think what's dangerous this fall is,
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.500]  for those of us that have grown
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.220]  and been in many, many harvest seasons,
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.460]  it's rough, it's always rough.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.300]  It's always rough.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.540]  There's always a massive glut.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.180]  Everyone's trying to just pay their trimmers
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.780]  and buy Christmas presents for their kids.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.660]  And it's gnarly from a market side.
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.180]  And so it's making sure that,
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.940]  like, I think it's kind of funny.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.020]  I'm not set on this,
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.980]  but I may do a little bit of Blue Dream this year.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.420]  I grew Blue Dream for a long time.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.940]  And then I was like always hating on Blue Dream
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.780]  because it was worth four or $500 less per pound
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.860]  than the OGs and other things.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.540]  And now I'm like, I think I might do some,
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.060]  I think I'll do some Blue Dream again.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.260]  I'm not going to do too much Blue Dream.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.980]  So it's just really about like,
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.260]  it's funny because in the grape world,
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.540]  people are like picking,
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.100]  it was all the rage for all cab.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.580]  And now, and then like a movie comes out
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.300]  and everyone hates Merlot.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.940]  And then now, and everyone's like,
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.060]  Pinot's going to be all the rage.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.780]  And everyone just was planting Pinot
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.060]  like no other on the coast.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.140]  And now Pinot, there's a glut on Pinot.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.140]  And so it's just kind of,
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.220]  the one thing that's rough about selecting your cultivars
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.420]  is how much is independent on outside marketing
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.660]  in the marketplace.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.700]  And whether it's kind of funny when you see like,
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.140]  like what is the market of the mid-zodics, right?
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.700]  Have you looked at that?
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.220]  I mean, with the dispensaries,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.220]  as far as like what sells the most
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.180]  and what varieties people really hit at
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.940]  in certain areas of markets compared to North and South.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.660]  Because the, like, yeah,
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.300]  when we were judging the Emerald Cup sitting next to Joe
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.540]  and listening to his deal,
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.260]  it's like, he can't get enough blue dreams and hazes
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.820]  and daytime weed.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.660]  Yeah.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.500]  And so, yeah, San Francisco loves daytime weed.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.740]  LA loves its nighttime weed.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.700]  At the same time, like I just try to travel around the state
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.540]  and one of the things that I've noticed
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.500]  is like a lot of the distribution companies,
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.660]  like if you're waiting on data from like Headset
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.300]  or BDS or those things, like you're always getting data.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.820]  Like, yeah, they have a weekly data
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.380]  that really comes out, but if I didn't, you know,
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.180]  like where exactly are those dispensaries?
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.460]  How much was their sample size?
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.900]  How can you really extrapolate on those statistics
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.020]  versus like knowing the sales,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.020]  knowing the account manager that manages 20 sales reps
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.660]  and talking to him and having that relationship
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.420]  is like the most important thing you could have.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.860]  And you can't just jump into that relationship.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.660]  It has to be built over years of being in the industry.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:15.660]  So on your three acres, you had mentioned Blue Dream.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.940]  So first of all, do you have hoop houses?
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.700]  Do you have state-of-the-art greenhouses built by Eric?
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.380]  What do you have going on there?
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.620]  I think I would love to have state-of-the-art greenhouses
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:27.780]  built by Eric.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.900]  I'd actually talked to Eric
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.620]  when I first started this project,
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.380]  but no, we haven't decided exactly how many acres,
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.260]  you know, it may be far beyond the three.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.980]  We'll just see just quite yet because it's still early
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.980]  and we're still processing our soil,
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.220]  but it's gonna be native full sun, full sun.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.340]  Really, you know, that's like the one thing
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.340]  I always talk about.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.420]  Sorry, so you're not using any light depth or anything.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.540]  You're outdoor.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.820]  Okay, got it, got it, got it.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.900]  And that's, you can only,
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:07.620]  it's, I think the future of
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.900]  cost-effective high-quality cannabis
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.100]  is high hoop, very tunnels.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.020]  I was just gonna say that I can get a deal
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.180]  on some right now too.
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.260]  I got a, there's a farmer that's taken down
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.460]  a couple hundred acres and they're selling.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.620]  Oh shit, call me after the show.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.460]  Okay.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.300]  After the show.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.820]  I'll send you a picture.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.260]  Yeah.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.460]  Yeah, that's killer.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:35.620]  That's what I was gonna say though.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.420]  The berry hoops for outdoor on a couple acres like that.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.700]  I mean, that's where I was getting some decent biomass
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.420]  for a little bit was on a 40 acres in Buellton.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.020]  Most people saw it on the news
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.340]  after annual permits started coming out,
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.180]  but I was going there when the temp permits
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.980]  were still active, everything was valid.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:59.660]  But man, they were, they had more weed coming down
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.780]  that they knew what to do with,
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.460]  but the berry hoops were great because they,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.380]  you know, an economical approach to protecting some outdoor.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.620]  Yeah.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.860]  And yeah, it's interesting because I feel like with,
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.140]  I know Eric, you and I have talked about this quite a bit.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.700]  If you look at who's producing some of the very best
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.300]  sun grown in the whole state, you know,
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.460]  they're doing it in berry tunnels or they're using hoops
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.740]  and they're using a specific covering on their hoops.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.380]  I've talked to a lot of farmers this year
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.180]  that are doing full sun that are talking about
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:35.220]  like using a specific type of shade structure this fall
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.220]  in the last three weeks of flower, just to get the color.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.940]  Because one of the problems you always have with outdoors
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.420]  that your color can be a little darker
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.580]  and you can get some hyperoxidation and come March,
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.100]  you know, it just doesn't look very good.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.940]  And you can, there's a lot of things you can do
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.500]  to get around that that are highly effective.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.780]  And what is the specific shade cover they're using?
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.100]  Well, their climate screens, they call them nowadays.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.820]  Most of them, I mean, people will still get
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.220]  the traditional shade cloth that looks like a mesh,
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.620]  but people that really know what's up
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.180]  are getting climate screens.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.660]  A common one that people know of is called a Luminette.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.580]  It's kind of more of a climate screen,
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.700]  but it has a Mylar coating on the outside.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.140]  So it's highly reflective, but the stuff that I use is,
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.620]  and it's common in a lot of the fancy greenhouses,
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.740]  the climate screens kind of have the white strips
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.860]  going through it with the webbing in between
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.020]  holding these little white strips together.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.500]  So that's very breathable.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.260]  Depending on how thick or how close together
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.340]  these little white strips are,
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.820]  dictates the level of shading that's created.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.820]  But they really reflect light well and work much better.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.700]  In some cases, people prefer the greenhouse covers
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.020]  because they are trying to protect from late rains
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:44.900]  and things like that.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.140]  But other people that just wanna get, you know,
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:52.500]  the exposure down, the late summer exposure on those flowers
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.560]  is really helpful because what happens is plants outside
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.040]  get exposed to UV and that infrared.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.600]  And at certain points, infrared bringing the heat like that,
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.560]  if it's not scattered by a shade cloth
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.440]  or a diffused greenhouse cover, plants have to sweat.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.400]  People perspire, plants transpire.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.600]  And so basically when those big dense flowers
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.480]  are trying to sweat, moisture's trapped inside.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.200]  And so that's how we get bud rot.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.800]  And a lot of people wanna avoid bud rot
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.000]  and the botrytis and things like that.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.880]  And so also keeping the color
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.320]  because cannabis or terpenes, you know,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.960]  are easy to zap off or oxidate, you know,
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.120]  UV, UVB is discoloring and degrading.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.880]  And so while a lot of people, you know,
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.640]  argue over UVB or UVs in general,
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.880]  giving higher THC ratings,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.680]  it really can be tough on the terpene content
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.440]  and especially the color of the plant.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.560]  So, you know, there's a lot of people
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.680]  I sold climate screens to last year
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.380]  that just did their hoops predominantly
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.520]  with the shade screen and had great success
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.320]  and said they'll never go back.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.360]  And then I have other people that prefer, like I said,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.920]  a diffused greenhouse cover.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.720]  But when you use a greenhouse cover,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.000]  the problem is most people trap too much air.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.960]  They don't have enough openings to avoid trapping air.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.760]  And when you trap air, it heats up.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.160]  We don't need the greenhouse effect in the summertime.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.240]  And so using a greenhouse cover
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.480]  in conjunction with a shade screen
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.720]  doesn't always do the trick
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.040]  because then it's still shady and hot inside.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.760]  And so there's a few methods to the madness, so to speak.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.320]  But at the end of the day,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.160]  yeah, bury hoops with a shade screen
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.680]  and a couple of them covered with the poly weave
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.800]  just to kind of do a little side by sides wouldn't hurt
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.760]  when you have that much square footage to do.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.520]  And, you know, you can do a little cost analysis on,
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.900]  I think the shade screens, depending on the size,
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.000]  would be more affordable
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.320]  than the poly woven greenhouse covers.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.880]  But most people just kind of deflect to the films
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.040]  and then trap too much air.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.960]  So they have too much exposure,
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.760]  too much trapped air, which overheats.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.620]  And then they go, why did I get this greenhouse?
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.180]  I was better off outdoors.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:56.780]  And so, you know, it's really important
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.460]  to get those colors and not have it look like outdoor.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.420]  That's why I always try to call things sun grown
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.100]  and then see where the consumer
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.100]  or the person kind of asks from there.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.180]  Yeah.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.700]  Yeah, it's gonna be, yeah, it's interesting to see what,
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.940]  you know, there's, in cannabis,
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.100]  there's like so many different ways to skin the cat
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.740]  and everyone has their own methodology and such.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.300]  And yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.460]  what kind of proves out to be an industry standard
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.620]  in 10 years.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.620]  So, Sam, wrapping up with your story up to present time.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.600]  So it's gonna be a couple acres
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.380]  and then the cultivars you're gonna run,
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.900]  you mentioned Blue Dream.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.340]  Are you gonna be running stuff
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.700]  that's kind of known in the market?
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.780]  Or like, what's your decision-making process
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.940]  for the cultivars you're running
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.500]  and how many do you think you'll run in season one?
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.980]  We could run, you know, we'll see.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.700]  We may end up doing like upwards of 10 acres.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.980]  And if we go that route,
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.580]  then we're gonna go with, you know,
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.020]  two cultivars per acre.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.940]  And it'll be a mix of some tried and true,
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.620]  some possibly, you know, we'll see.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:16.620]  But it's really hard to gauge the market just perfect.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.740]  And you also have to,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.780]  when you're looking at these decisions,
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.740]  you have to look at them as supply chain standpoint
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:24.780]  because you can't monocrop
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.300]  and you can't have your entire harvest come in at one time
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.820]  when you don't have enough drying space for it.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.740]  So like, and pay and, you know,
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.060]  investing enough money to have enough drying space
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:41.060]  to dry your entire crop in 10 days is astronomical.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.380]  And it'd be a very poor use of capital.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.420]  You know, building a multimillion dollar building
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.420]  for one week a year or at most two weeks a year,
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.300]  that would be a pretty poor business decision.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.460]  So having a rolling harvest, you know,
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.860]  a five to six week rolling harvest is really important.
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.020]  So some cultivars that are eight week, nine week,
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.060]  10 week, 11 week, like just picking and choosing.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:10.900]  Okay, got it.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:11.860]  I got a question.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.820]  Do you have your distribution channels set yet?
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:19.060]  Are you still talking to distributors?
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.420]  What's that environment looking like for you?
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.780]  And will you go with one?
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.340]  Will you go with a few?
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.260]  And what are those relationships?
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.500]  Those are important factors
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.860]  if you're making your decisions, aren't you?
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.780]  Yeah, yeah, no, we'll see what it comes out to be,
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.900]  but yeah, I can't imagine if you put all your money
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.980]  into one thing, you're not gonna get it.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.940]  I can't imagine if you put all your eggs in one basket
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.940]  and you were my friend, I'd slap you.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.020]  And are you gonna have your own brand
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.700]  or are you gonna just sell it all to other people
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.780]  who wanna white label it?
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.980]  Yeah, I think we're not gonna have our own brand this year.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.220]  I think one of the things I learned
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.740]  about having a brand the last time
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.740]  was that it's just the most important principles
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.980]  in business are cashflow first, profit second, brand third.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.500]  And brand is arguably the least important
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.660]  decision-making process
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.060]  in how a consumer buys cannabis today.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.260]  And so it's, they'd rather buy quality,
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.220]  exotic name brand, whatever, high THC,
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.300]  they don't care who it comes from.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.620]  They're like an IPA drinker.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.260]  I mean, how many IPA drinkers do you know
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.740]  that buy the exact same IPA every single week?
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.180]  I don't know any, I'm one of them
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.980]  and I don't buy the same IPA every week.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.820]  No, it's way different.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.860]  Yeah, I just always go into the store
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:39.740]  and I'm just like, let me try something different.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.260]  Sometimes I'll cycle back through the same ones.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.660]  Yeah, that's why, especially even going back
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.500]  to the private investment stuff,
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.380]  it's really poor investment strategy
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.980]  to invest in one company if you were
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.580]  because the chances that a consumer,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.580]  the brand loyalty that exists in cannabis,
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.700]  well, it just doesn't exist on a flower side.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.300]  Got it.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.020]  All right, Bam, are you ready to get into the hot seat?
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.500]  And we've heard a little bit of this story
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:11.540]  which was what, like 2015 to 2017 in the CO2 extract.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.140]  And by the way, somebody early on in the comments
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.260]  mentioned that they loved your pens and missed them.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.100]  So I hope.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:20.940]  Oh, thank you.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.220]  I missed them too.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.500]  So why don't you, I mean, start from wherever you think
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.700]  it's logical to start in terms of telling
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:34.460]  your kind of business story and let's get started.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.900]  Sure, I mean, as far as my business story goes,
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:41.620]  I'd say the highest grade was probably like
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:46.620]  my deepest venture into the business side of cannabis.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.380]  I've been cultivating for a long time.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:55.980]  I think my first crop was in like the late 90s.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.180]  And where was that?
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.860]  That was in Massachusetts.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.100]  What, you're also from Beantown?
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.540]  Get the fuck out.
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.980]  Pat's man, Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.580]  Grew up right outside Fenway Park.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.780]  Learned to ride my BMX in the parking lot.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.220]  Yeah, all right.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.740]  All right, so your first grow was like
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.620]  an HPS grow somewhere in.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.260]  It was actually a fluorescent grow.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.420]  I had gone through extreme lengths
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.420]  to get a closet set up from Canada.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:35.380]  And also went up to Canada to get my first seeds,
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:41.100]  which were some AK-47s from Holland via Canada.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.140]  And that was my first run.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:50.140]  But then I wound up coming up to California
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:55.180]  in the late 2000s and just growing as a grower.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.660]  Started focusing on breeding.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.500]  I worked at Coastal Seeds for a while,
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.300]  where I cut my teeth.
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.620]  Learning under Kagyu, who's an older breeder.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:12.740]  He's been breeding for a long time.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.740]  And then somewhere along the journey,
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.380]  I stumbled upon CO2.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.940]  There was a farmer in Santa Cruz
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.740]  who'd been making CO2.
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.380]  And I was like, wow, this is pretty good.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.900]  This is different than some of the other CO2
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.540]  that I had tried on the market.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.820]  And I had studied chemistry for a while
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.500]  and I had worked in a lab for a while.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.500]  So analytical mind started getting to it
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.340]  after I tried it.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.620]  And I was like, all right, these are,
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.820]  I see a lot of potential here and room for improvement.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:51.820]  So I bought myself a little bench top unit
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.820]  and started doing as many runs
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.100]  as I could possibly do in a day.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.140]  By the way, who is that guy you see on the screen?
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:08.140]  That was my mentor, Kagyu, Michael from Coastal Seeds.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:13.340]  And I remember I was a young breeder
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.940]  with not that much experience
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.060]  and probably a little bit arrogant
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.300]  because I was like, hey, I'm starting the seed company.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.380]  You wanna join?
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:26.380]  And this is the guy who is twice my age
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:32.060]  and had been doing it for a lot longer.
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.860]  And I remember taking home a nug of his
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.980]  and smoking it and it was mind-blowingly good.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:42.660]  And in that moment, I had like the epiphany
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:44.420]  that maybe I should just humble myself
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.140]  instead of trying to get an older guy
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.420]  to join my seed company.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.340]  Why don't I go join his company
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.500]  and learn the ropes?
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.100]  And so that's what I did for a while.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.540]  And Coastal Seeds was always more like a project of passion
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.180]  to me than a business maneuver.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.060]  The highest grade was when I started developing
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.620]  our CO2 process,
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.620]  which we call the virgin coal press extract.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:17.300]  And was that with some friends or what was the,
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.540]  who are the people, the key people?
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.540]  That was me in a lab, not lab, it was my bedroom
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.900]  with a bench top unit waking up.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.100]  I needed to get four runs in a day
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.460]  in order to develop my process
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.140]  and my machine ran on four hour cycles.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.500]  So I'd set my alarm and I'd sleep for four hours
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.220]  and I'd wake up in the middle of the night
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:39.620]  and I'd reload the machine
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.700]  and then let it go again and go back to sleep
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.220]  as I was developing my process
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.820]  because I needed to collect as much data as I could
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.580]  in order to develop my whole process.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.820]  And then down the line, I needed money to scale
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:58.260]  because CO2 equipment isn't cheap.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.140]  And so I brought on an investor slash partner
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.700]  and we got a bigger machine and got into a lab
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.100]  and then try to go to market
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.860]  where we had a lot of like success in the award circuit
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.700]  but struggled to get our retail sales to make us profitable.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.180]  And looking back kind of retrospectively,
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.900]  why do you think that was?
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:30.740]  Several factors.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.740]  I mean, one, I think, and I hate to always do this
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:39.500]  but I see a lot of problems with the regulatory framework.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.300]  I don't believe there should be bottlenecks
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.820]  in terms of retail.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.700]  Like I don't understand why producers
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.780]  can't take things directly to market.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.220]  Because I think that if we could take things
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.460]  directly to market,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.020]  we would have been an extremely successful company.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.060]  But for me, the biggest hurdle was getting just shelf space,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.860]  getting face time for clients.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.700]  That was the hardest component.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.020]  There was a lot of cronyism.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.540]  You had to know so-and-so
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.420]  and you have these different markets that are limited.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.380]  Like I can speak specifically to Santa Cruz
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.740]  because that's where I'm based.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.300]  You know that there's a monopoly there
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.860]  of like 11 dispensaries
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.180]  that have had that chokehold and stranglehold on the market.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.660]  And when anytime you limit consumer choice,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:32.100]  it's not just the consumers who are at a disadvantage.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.020]  Manufacturers and producers are as well
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.700]  because here you have behemoths
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:40.540]  and they are the gatekeepers to the retail market.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.180]  And the retail market is where revenue is generated.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.940]  So for us, that was the biggest hurdle.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.660]  It was always a fight
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:52.300]  and it was always about how much could we give up
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:58.460]  in order to gain market share.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.420]  And then you couple that with like having to compete
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:08.420]  with hydrocarbon and extracts and distillate.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.060]  That's a much cheaper production process.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:17.140]  The cost of equipment, I mean, you can spend under $20,000
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.180]  and have everything that you need to produce
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.500]  a lot of that stuff.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:23.460]  Like I think the cheapest CO2 unit
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.460]  that you can buy is the benchtop unit
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.140]  which is a $35,000 investment.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.660]  And if you're trying to get into any form of production,
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.340]  I think at the time that we were doing things,
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:38.740]  it was about $100,000 for the machine
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:43.740]  in order to produce, be able to process 100 pounds a month,
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.580]  working six days a week.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.420]  And then there's a laboratory overhead too.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:55.620]  Again, this was like all my projects,
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.580]  our projects, our passion projects more so than business.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:03.540]  I like to do what I love more so than focus.
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.620]  And making money isn't my passion, it's a necessity.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:12.020]  So I have a question here because this is really important.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.580]  Meanwhile, despite all these challenges over this time,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:20.140]  you have developed a reputation and also a fan base.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.300]  Is that not correct?
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.940]  I mean, they're out there, aren't they?
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.180]  Sure, yes, we have.
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.940]  I mean, I still get requests all the time about our carts
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.620]  and that was probably the most meaningful part
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:33.660]  of the entire thing.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.540]  It was nice to, I love connecting with consumers.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.020]  I love educating them.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:43.020]  I love hearing genuine feedback from people
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.580]  who truly appreciate what it is that we had done.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.780]  But I think the biggest hurdle for me is
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.340]  how do I translate that into a sustainable project?
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.340]  Not just environmentally sustainable,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.620]  not just consumer sustainable,
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.220]  but financially sustainable.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:03.700]  And that was a real challenge between,
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.900]  I think it would be even more so of a challenge now
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.060]  under Prop 64 than it was under Prop 215.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.380]  And to me, the solution is open up the market.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.100]  Like stop limiting retail channels,
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.860]  stop limiting producer licenses
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:27.500]  and really give people the chance to compete
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.140]  on a level playing ground.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:34.140]  And I always prided myself on,
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.820]  now I'm a naturalized American citizen
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.900]  and I always prided myself on the idea of the meritocracy,
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.940]  on the idea of a free market,
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:51.980]  on the idea of these principles being the driving factor.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:57.340]  And that those that excel and do the best should prevail.
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.980]  And I think that's my biggest gripe with regulation.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:05.260]  The way that regulation is, I'm not against regulation.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.460]  Mind you, we were self-regulating way before this.
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.620]  Our standards were smashing cap three.
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.140]  We were already doing that.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.660]  That was a standard that we had set for ourselves.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.580]  And so it's frustrating to me to see that
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.900]  like in the name of health and safety,
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.100]  you have oligarchies being carved out.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.100]  And especially in the retail segment of the industry
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.900]  where, and I've talked to people in the past.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.180]  So obviously as we were growing,
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:40.420]  I had friends who were doing similar type businesses
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.420]  in Colorado and Washington.
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.460]  And I was always reasoning with them.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.820]  How do I crack this nut?
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.860]  How do we get this shelf space?
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.860]  How do we break through and get onto the open platform?
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.540]  And unfortunately it sounded a lot like the radio industry.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.860]  It's kind of a pay to play thing.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.420]  A lot of the feedback that I was getting
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.300]  from other successful people was,
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.780]  but tender nights, you have to like,
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.780]  you have to give away merch.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.740]  You have to, and so again,
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.500]  it comes down to spending more money
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.940]  in order to gain access to the market.
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:24.420]  For a startup company that's operating on thin margins
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.340]  as is that becomes a nightmare.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.660]  A hundred percent.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.660]  So, my whole dream with the California market,
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:41.420]  and I think what it was before Prop 64 was
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:47.060]  that you had thousands of mom and pop growers,
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:51.620]  tincture makers, everybody was small
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.700]  and hiring their first couple of people.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.940]  They were passionate.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.100]  They were excited to be like, holy shit,
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.660]  I may be able to make a career out of what I love.
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.740]  And California, every state and every country
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.740]  gets to create its own vision
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.820]  of what a cannabis market gets to look like.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.420]  I'm drinking mids right now, if you guys can see that.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.460]  Mostly because when my wife went to the grocery store,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:23.380]  I can't be like, I can't see what beer she's gonna buy.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.740]  I was like, just buy me a 30 pack of Bud Light.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:32.020]  But like Bud, InBev and Miller Coors
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.460]  dominate all the distribution.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.780]  They control distribution for alcohol, right?
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.620]  So you have kind of a couple of companies
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.380]  controlling everything.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.540]  If you're a small beverage brand,
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.700]  your aspiration is basically to be bought up
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.980]  by Coca-Cola or Pepsi or InBev or Miller Coors
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.100]  because they control it all.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.860]  And we had a fresh start
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.700]  and we didn't need to go in that direction
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.020]  and things were moving along nicely.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.500]  You guys had brands.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.540]  You were, I mean, obviously you were frustrated,
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:08.300]  but you were mom and pops starting businesses.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.780]  And then with Prop 64, basically the guillotine came down
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.180]  and it's gonna turn out like every other industry
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.500]  where you're gonna have a couple MSOs,
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.260]  multi-state operators dominating.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.060]  Maybe you'll have the retail chain that controls retail.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.620]  They're gonna have purchasing power.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.660]  They're gonna be able to slap around the little guys.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:27.660]  That's what MedMen wanted to be.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.180]  They wanted to own all of California,
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.100]  all of global retail like Starbucks
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.580]  and squeeze all the other operators.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:38.420]  So anyway-
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.860]  What High Times plans to be.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.700]  Exactly.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.060]  All right, so carry on.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.100]  I'm not anti those people doing what they do.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.060]  What I'm anti is them preventing us
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.260]  from carving out a space for ourselves.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:52.100]  Like, okay, great, there's Bud Light,
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.820]  but there's Pete's Wicked Ale
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.140]  and there's other small companies
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.620]  and they eventually get bought up.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.700]  But how did those companies get their start?
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  They started small.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.860]  They had access to the market
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.260]  and they were able to take it direct to consumer.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.140]  And so they were able to actually build their brand
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.780]  on their own, right?
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:12.460]  That's, I think that's the dream of most cannabis
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.660]  entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs in general.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.420]  We want to be able to, if we do the work
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.620]  and we put in the time,
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:27.620]  then we should be rewarded for that time and effort
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.460]  instead of constantly running into different hurdles
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.820]  and different roadblocks.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:39.820]  And one aspect of Prop 64 that I really am disgruntled about
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:45.220]  is the amount of power that's devolved to counties.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:50.220]  Because then you really see this disproportionate access
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.860]  to the market based on geographic locations
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:59.660]  that come down to local political powers.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.660]  And I was a political science major
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:08.660]  and I didn't realize how, in my mind,
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:14.300]  it's a form of corruption when you have a few people
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:21.060]  in positions of power that get to make decisions
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.980]  that affect the large numbers of people's lives.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.940]  And oftentimes it comes down to not just the people
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:32.780]  but it comes down to not just what is legislated,
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.660]  but it's the application of said law.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.660]  So in my particular case, it's Santa Cruz County,
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:40.140]  which is what I'm talking about.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.460]  And in Santa Cruz County, you have the board of supervisors
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.460]  who have come out and said that they're not out
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.060]  to shut down mom and pops.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:52.060]  They're not out to do, just enable big business.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:54.620]  But then if you look at the application of the law,
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:59.620]  which is often devolved to lifetime unelected bureaucrats
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.660]  who are put into these positions.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.940]  And so there's no real way for the voters to check them.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:07.340]  There's a disconnect between what was said
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:12.220]  by the legislators and how that law is applied.
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.020]  And you see it all across the state.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.420]  You can see the success of different cannabis ventures
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.820]  and startups based on their county.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:26.300]  How many huge companies that were operating
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.140]  out of Santa Cruz have now moved to Monterey
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.420]  or moved elsewhere?
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.980]  And that's great and fine and dandy
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:34.340]  if you're a big company that has the revenue
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:35.860]  and the financial backing.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.660]  But there's a whole segment of the economy
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.020]  that was homesteaders such as myself.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:43.140]  I never wanted to be a hundred acre grow.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.860]  I've always just wanted to have a small family farm
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.100]  and be able to take my product to the market.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.940]  I would love to see the day when I can just be
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:51.380]  at the farmer's market.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:54.220]  I love what I do and I wanna continue to do what I do
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.620]  without having to uproot my entire family
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.860]  and move jurisdictions
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.780]  because there's a friendlier location over there.
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.300]  And I think that's-
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.900]  Yeah, no, I had talked to, I mean, I've talked to people
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.940]  who, for example, like moved from Oakland to Sacramento
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.780]  because Oakland was so crazy
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.700]  and they were just like, it's more front.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.740]  But I mean, obviously, ideally you wouldn't have to move
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.900]  your entire family just to do what you wanna do.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.500]  That's crazy.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.940]  Yeah, especially when some of us
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:28.860]  have staked our entire lives and built our homes.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:33.860]  When people buy a house, it's not a small decision.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:39.980]  You're investing everything into something
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.980]  and then to have some local politics stand in the way
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.260]  of you living your dream, doesn't seem fair to me.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.020]  And I understand, and I don't wanna like contradict
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.180]  the need for regulation.
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.900]  Again, I'm not an anti-regulation person.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.820]  I just think that regulation needs to be rolled out
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.860]  in a manner that actually addresses health and safety
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:05.420]  rather than like limiting access to the market.
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.380]  There is a middle ground.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.940]  There's a middle ground to be had
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.140]  where we can address the needs and the concerns
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.780]  of different communities
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.780]  without stifling entrepreneurship and ingenuity.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.020]  Right.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.100]  Dan, what do you think about Oregon?
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.060]  Because this is one of the things that I've battled with
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:27.100]  with Prop 64 is that it was done with this guise
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.020]  of protecting small farmers.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.620]  It was done in all these like, this kind of,
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.860]  oh yeah, we're gonna protect the little guy for five years.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.380]  And then all of a sudden switcheroo, stacking licenses,
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.300]  all this stuff.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.100]  And then it's like, at the end of the day,
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.140]  I've looked at it and been like,
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.140]  it would have been better off if they'd said,
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.580]  all right, you have to show proof of funds,
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.820]  $5 million or else you can't get in.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:48.780]  Because you know what?
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.380]  Then we all would have just been like, you know what?
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:51.820]  All right, we're gonna stay underground.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.340]  We're gonna screw that, stay underground.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.220]  Instead, we all like lost, you know,
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.380]  hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:00.660]  trying to become legal, to have it stuffed in your face,
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.380]  which I've known a lot of my friends that has happened to.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.260]  And at the end of the day, it would have been better
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.820]  to just be like, okay, I could have made the choice
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.340]  to not do that.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.620]  And then you have Oregon that's like, all right,
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.780]  free for all.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.540]  It was like, instead of this bleeding out
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.860]  of three to four years, if you're seeing in California,
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.900]  it was like, it completely blew up,
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.260]  it completely collapsed and pounds went nowhere.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.140]  And then it was just like survival of the fittest,
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.340]  raw capitalism.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.180]  And a lot of people are sour about that.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:30.180]  But at the same time, I look at it to where,
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.300]  what would have been better for our community?
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.260]  And I don't know what it is.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.100]  I don't know the answer to it.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.540]  But at the same time, it's just like,
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.860]  what's going on right now for the vast majority of people
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:40.820]  is not working.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:44.260]  It's only working for a select few.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.100]  I agree.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.460]  And I think that-
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.940]  And then Oklahoma is another example
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.900]  of a kind of free market.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:56.590]  And it'll be interesting to see how that goes.
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:57.830]  Go ahead, Dan.
[01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:58.670]  I was saying that, yeah.
[01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:01.950]  I mean, I think that that free for all model
[01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:05.790]  is actually what in my mind is the fairest.
[01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:09.910]  I mean, I think that if there's a glut in the market,
[01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:14.070]  but there's no barriers to entry to the market
[01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:17.670]  for the producers, then it's on the producer.
[01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:20.110]  That's where the brand starts moving out of third place
[01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:22.590]  on your list and starts moving into first place
[01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.790]  because then you start having to connect
[01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.830]  and identifying with consumers
[01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:28.790]  and reinvesting in your communities
[01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:30.950]  and making those bonds that are important
[01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:34.510]  so that people are saying, okay, I have a consumer choice.
[01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:36.870]  Why am, the market's flooded.
[01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:38.790]  Why am I going with this brand?
[01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:41.470]  Because this brand has done the consumer outreach.
[01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:43.110]  They've done the education.
[01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:48.110]  And those are the values that I place high on culture.
[01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:50.070]  Forget business.
[01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.910]  Yeah, I know.
[01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:51.790]  Culture in general.
[01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:53.110]  I agree.
[01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:54.710]  It's the crazy thing that you mentioned earlier
[01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:55.990]  about the farmer's market.
[01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.510]  There have been so many that are now national
[01:34:58.510 --> 01:35:03.070]  and worldwide food and agriculture product brands
[01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:05.110]  that started at a farmer's market
[01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:10.110]  because you've got direct market info from your customer.
[01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:13.230]  You weren't deciphering this market info
[01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:16.510]  from a bud tender to a buyer at a club
[01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.390]  to a sales rep at a distributor
[01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:19.910]  to then the sourcing at the distributor.
[01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:21.950]  And now you've got a game of telephone
[01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.350]  so you don't even know what your customer wanted
[01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.870]  or what they said.
[01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:26.070]  And when you're at the farmer's market,
[01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:29.390]  you can know, pivot quickly on your business model
[01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.470]  or your product, your strains, whatever it's gonna be.
[01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:33.190]  And then you can meet your customer's needs.
[01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:34.910]  And so that's like, in a lot of ways,
[01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:38.070]  why that farmer's market model is so important
[01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:40.390]  and why we need it so bad.
[01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:44.190]  Well, I think also for a lot of small farmers,
[01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:46.790]  if they could just do farmer's markets,
[01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:49.310]  they could clear out most of their harvest
[01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:53.190]  through that model and just move on to next season.
[01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:55.110]  Because now they're at the mercy of distributors, right?
[01:35:55.110 --> 01:35:57.830]  A distributor, I'm a humbled farmer.
[01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:00.350]  I can't interact with the end user.
[01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:03.430]  I have to rely on a distributor who doesn't care about me.
[01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:06.550]  And then I'm in the retail on-ramp
[01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:08.990]  and the bud tenders don't care about me.
[01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:13.190]  And if I could go to 10 farmer's markets a year,
[01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:17.590]  I could connect with the person who values my product
[01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:19.750]  and is like, I love your shit.
[01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:22.230]  Yeah, and you don't get the situation
[01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:24.590]  where the consumer walks in and asks the bud tender,
[01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:25.910]  what's your favorite strain?
[01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:26.750]  Oh, you know what it is?
[01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:28.350]  It's what we have the most of in stock.
[01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:31.190]  That's my favorite strain.
[01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.070]  The one that we get the most margins on
[01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:35.750]  and we need to get rid of today.
[01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:40.510]  And I've seen that happen so many times
[01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:42.590]  and props to all the bud tenders out there
[01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:43.750]  that are not like that
[01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:46.030]  and actually do their job like a sommelier.
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:48.670]  Because I don't want to take anything away from them.
[01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:50.790]  There are great bud tenders out there
[01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:53.150]  who really genuinely connect with their consumers,
[01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:55.990]  know their products in and out and do that.
[01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:59.670]  But then you also have pressures from like product managers
[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:03.630]  and retail managers who have to do inventory management.
[01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:06.950]  And inventory management and consumer good,
[01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:07.990]  seldom line up.
[01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:10.510]  They just seldom line up
[01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:13.670]  in the way that the market is currently shaped.
[01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.110]  That doesn't mean that it can't be altered.
[01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:18.870]  So talk about your,
[01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:26.470]  I assume you shut down the CO2 vape pen stuff.
[01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:29.950]  So when did you shut that down
[01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:32.030]  and then kind of what was the next pivot?
[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:38.030]  So we shut that down in the summer before Prop 64 kicked in.
[01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:39.910]  And it was kind of a-
[01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:43.190]  So 2017, summer of 2017?
[01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.670]  17, I believe that's what it was.
[01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:50.430]  Summer of June or July of 2017.
[01:37:52.710 --> 01:37:54.710]  And was that a difficult decision?
[01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:55.590]  Sure.
[01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:58.230]  Yeah, talk about some of them.
[01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:01.670]  So yeah, one of the problems was the licensing hurdles.
[01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:05.150]  Trying to find a jurisdiction
[01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:07.030]  that we could get the license.
[01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:11.070]  Nobody had their licensing programs rolled out.
[01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:14.630]  We were operating in Richmond at the time
[01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:19.630]  and it was very unclear as to how that was gonna roll out.
[01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:24.670]  So we were struggling with basically finding a location
[01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:26.590]  that was gonna be ready in time
[01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:30.110]  for the transition to Prop 64
[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:34.510]  that would allow us to just keep chugging along.
[01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.030]  So this was trying to find a type six license,
[01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:42.590]  a jurisdiction where you could do type six CO2 extraction?
[01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:48.750]  The places that were convenient to us
[01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:50.310]  and where we had already been operating
[01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:52.670]  hadn't worked out their entire framework yet.
[01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:54.110]  They kept kicking it down the line
[01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:56.230]  and saying it's coming online, it's coming online.
[01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.190]  When you're barely making rent in payroll every month,
[01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.630]  you don't have time to wait for them
[01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.710]  to make those decisions.
[01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:07.630]  Unfortunately, I also got into a really gnarly car accident
[01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:10.390]  that left me in a coma for about a month and a half.
[01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:15.990]  And so when I came out of it, it was kind of chaos.
[01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:17.910]  I suffered traumatic brain injury
[01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.510]  and I wasn't really all together.
[01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:25.950]  Some of the investors basically tried to cut me
[01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:29.510]  out of the company and it just kind of got ugly from there.
[01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:34.510]  And I chose to shut out the brand rather than fight
[01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:39.070]  while I was actually fighting for my mental sanity
[01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.910]  at the moment.
[01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:41.870]  I had three ongoing brain hemorrhages.
[01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:46.870]  I wasn't in any shape or position to get into legal battles
[01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:50.710]  or try to navigate the slope.
[01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:54.990]  It took me about a year of therapy and downtime
[01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:58.510]  before I could actually pick pieces of myself
[01:39:58.510 --> 01:40:00.110]  back up together.
[01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:02.630]  So it was a combination of factors
[01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:06.750]  that led to the shuttering of the brand.
[01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:10.830]  But we didn't have the funding.
[01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:12.710]  Let me ask you a specific question
[01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:14.550]  because I feel like in this industry,
[01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:18.070]  I've been screwed more than any other industry I've been in
[01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:22.750]  and it's never been by people who are legacy in the industry.
[01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:25.150]  It's always by kind of newer people
[01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:28.630]  and were the people who were trying to push you out
[01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:31.710]  legacy people or kind of like the newer investors?
[01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:33.470]  They were legacy people.
[01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:34.670]  They were legacy people.
[01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:39.350]  It was a complicated string of events.
[01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:41.110]  It's hard to assign blame.
[01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:44.430]  If anything, it's just a sad story.
[01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:52.830]  If I had to pinpoint it, it was fear.
[01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:56.230]  I think that people were, me coming out of a coma,
[01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:59.670]  me almost dying, me being the heart of the brand,
[01:40:59.670 --> 01:41:04.670]  I had to put fear in the investors' hearts
[01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:10.110]  and they felt the need to take control of their investment.
[01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:16.870]  But they did so in a way that was unmindful
[01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:21.870]  of my contributions and the work that I had done.
[01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:25.390]  It was my tech, I invented the brand
[01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:28.350]  and I did all that basic groundwork.
[01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:30.590]  So I wasn't gonna be cut out.
[01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:33.030]  They weren't bad people, they were legacy people.
[01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:35.070]  Fear will lead to bad outcomes.
[01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:36.470]  Fear, I think in general,
[01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:39.150]  leads to bad decision-making and poor outcomes.
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:44.950]  If I have to look at myself,
[01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:46.350]  because at the end of the day,
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.190]  if you're analyzing any problem,
[01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:50.470]  there's only one person that you can blame,
[01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:52.430]  it's yourself, because it's the only person
[01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:53.470]  that you can control.
[01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:59.750]  I would say that my reaction to what I felt
[01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:04.630]  was like encroachment was also probably
[01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:08.390]  disproportionate as well and had something to do with it,
[01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:11.350]  but I don't take all the blame for it.
[01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:13.150]  If I had to pinpoint it on one thing,
[01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:15.190]  I think it was fear and uncertainty.
[01:42:17.630 --> 01:42:19.950]  The combination of fear and uncertainty
[01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:24.710]  led to a chain reaction of bad outcomes
[01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:28.430]  and bad reactions that wound up multiplying.
[01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:32.990]  It was like one overreaction or miscalculation
[01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:36.670]  led to the other overreaction or miscalculation
[01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:41.670]  that kind of ping-ponged in a negative feedback loop.
[01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:44.470]  Yeah, I was gonna say feedback loop.
[01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:46.310]  Yeah.
[01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:52.070]  Okay, so that's 2017.
[01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:55.270]  So now what happens next?
[01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:58.630]  You shut the brand down and...
[01:42:59.550 --> 01:43:01.230]  Focused on my health for a while.
[01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:02.070]  Yeah.
[01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:05.910]  Traumatic brain injury is a pretty serious thing.
[01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:08.470]  It's one of those things that nobody can really explain
[01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.830]  in like one conversation, but just imagine losing your brain
[01:43:12.710 --> 01:43:14.750]  and then having to pick up all the pieces
[01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:15.990]  and put it back together.
[01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:20.910]  So after that, after I came back out of it,
[01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:24.230]  the breeder me was,
[01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:28.270]  wanted to continue being a cultivator and a breeder.
[01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:30.710]  I continued to run into the different struggles
[01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:32.710]  and hurdles in Santa Cruz County,
[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:34.310]  where they spent a lot of time
[01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:37.430]  trying to address the mountain community,
[01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:40.950]  which is the traditional growing area of Santa Cruz County.
[01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:45.070]  But subsequently, most of the legislation that was passed
[01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:47.390]  made it almost impossible for anybody in the mountains
[01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:48.870]  to get a license.
[01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:51.150]  Everything was pushed into the traditional
[01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:53.270]  berry growing areas of Watsonville.
[01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:57.590]  And a lot of brands left Santa Cruz
[01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:00.950]  and a lot of other farmers went rogue and went outlaw.
[01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:06.110]  I decided that I was gonna focus on breeding
[01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:08.710]  and cultivation somehow some way.
[01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:10.750]  And then I was looking at all the hurdles
[01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:14.590]  and by the time you deal with conditional use permit
[01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:18.390]  and every other agency that wants a piece of the pie
[01:44:19.230 --> 01:44:22.390]  before the ingredient list has even been put together,
[01:44:24.630 --> 01:44:26.910]  it just seemed like a nightmare to me.
[01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:28.390]  I'm 42 years old.
[01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:31.190]  I don't feel old, but I don't feel like I have all the time
[01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:32.350]  in the world to waste,
[01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:36.190]  jumping through hoops and playing Simon Says.
[01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:41.790]  And so I looked into hemp
[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:44.270]  because in my mind it's the same plant.
[01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:49.110]  And as a breeder, if my focus is something besides THC,
[01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:51.830]  there are so many traits within the same plant
[01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.470]  that I can focus on right now
[01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:55.950]  in terms of like structure, uniformity,
[01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:58.310]  yield, disease resistance,
[01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:02.510]  gnomes, colors, all the other novel chemical use.
[01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:05.310]  There are many traits that I can focus on
[01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:08.230]  on stabilizing right now and producing
[01:45:08.230 --> 01:45:11.830]  that whenever it goes federally legal or nationally legal,
[01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:14.830]  if I wanna put THC back into it,
[01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:19.190]  it's not gonna be a quantum step to do so.
[01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:25.270]  And my interactions with the Ag Department
[01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:28.470]  and the CDEFA have been phenomenal.
[01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:30.230]  They're an amazing agency.
[01:45:30.230 --> 01:45:33.750]  And I found that they were there.
[01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:35.310]  I felt like I had partners.
[01:45:35.310 --> 01:45:37.390]  And so that's one of the reasons
[01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:40.750]  why I went down the hemp route.
[01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:43.030]  I didn't have this antagonistic relationship
[01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:44.430]  with the government where I felt
[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:46.270]  everybody was trying to get a piece of the pie
[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:47.470]  before it was baked.
[01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:49.390]  And everybody was trying to stand in my way
[01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:51.870]  and stop me from achieving the goals that I wanted.
[01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:54.110]  I felt like I had real partners that are there
[01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:56.670]  to assist me in achieving my goals.
[01:45:56.670 --> 01:45:58.390]  If I have questions for them
[01:45:58.390 --> 01:46:01.230]  and I give them examples of things that I wanna do,
[01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:03.910]  somebody gets back to me within 24 to 48 hours
[01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:05.830]  with the concrete answers.
[01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:08.430]  And they're always coming at it from the perspective
[01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:11.590]  of how can I enable Bam to achieve his goal
[01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:12.430]  rather than standing in his way.
[01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:14.910]  And that was very refreshing for a cannabis farmer
[01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:20.590]  who spent a lifetime having to live in the shadows
[01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:24.110]  and dodge government agency
[01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:27.550]  in order to do what I think is a basic human right,
[01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:32.950]  to have a relationship with a government agency
[01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:36.270]  who cared enough to make sure
[01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:37.830]  that they were gonna give me the tools
[01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:39.830]  that I needed for my success.
[01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:44.830]  And something struck me the other day.
[01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:46.510]  I was actually having a conversation
[01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:47.670]  with the Ag Commissioner.
[01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:50.310]  I've been looking, so right now I have
[01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:53.750]  a California industry stock license to do hemp.
[01:46:55.910 --> 01:47:00.790]  That's how I can sell clones and seeds to other people
[01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:04.390]  and I can ship all over the country as long as it's hemp.
[01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:08.110]  And I had a client that was in another state
[01:47:08.110 --> 01:47:12.310]  and I wanted to do everything above board and logistically.
[01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:14.310]  And this was kind of a new problem for them.
[01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:16.870]  Like hemp is legal.
[01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:20.310]  It's legal for me to like sell it, move it, do whatever.
[01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:23.830]  But there are still steps along the way
[01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:25.990]  that haven't been clearly defined.
[01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:29.350]  And I remember when things were not clearly defined
[01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:32.430]  in cannabis, it came down to the regulator
[01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:35.070]  or the sheriff or whoever it was
[01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:36.230]  that you were dealing with,
[01:47:36.230 --> 01:47:39.550]  that interpretation fell upon them.
[01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:42.430]  And it was up to you later to clean up the mess
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:46.230]  that was made or fight or challenge their opinion
[01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:47.510]  of that enforcement.
[01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.630]  And what I like about working with the CDFA
[01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:53.950]  is that they work with you to problem solve it
[01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:57.630]  and get you the concrete answers.
[01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:00.150]  And generally their focus is on operating
[01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:02.070]  within the spirit of the law.
[01:48:02.710 --> 01:48:04.710]  And so I had been troubleshooting
[01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:07.990]  how to do this logistically.
[01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:10.710]  Every step along the way, I felt like I had a partner.
[01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:11.750]  They would call me up.
[01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:12.590]  They didn't have the answer.
[01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:14.070]  They would connect me to somebody else
[01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:16.070]  in another department that could.
[01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:17.990]  And it was a collaborative team effort
[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:21.350]  amongst three different people within the CDFA
[01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:24.430]  and the ag department who were working with me
[01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:26.070]  and were even reaching across the aisle
[01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:28.230]  to the other state to make phone calls there
[01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:31.630]  to make sure that everybody who needed to be on board
[01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:34.350]  for this project was there.
[01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:37.750]  And I said to the ag commission, I said, I just want,
[01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:40.590]  and I know that they're understaffed right now
[01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:43.510]  with the COVID crisis, offices are closed.
[01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:45.990]  They're having to work from home
[01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:48.430]  and it's just a struggle for them.
[01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:51.550]  And so even in all that mess,
[01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:53.230]  they're still responding to all my needs
[01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:55.470]  within 24 to 48 hours and doing it.
[01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:57.110]  And so I said, thank you.
[01:48:57.110 --> 01:49:00.230]  I said, thank you so much for being my partner
[01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:02.230]  and making me feel empowered.
[01:49:02.230 --> 01:49:04.910]  And I'm just deeply grateful.
[01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:06.630]  And I wanted to share that gratitude
[01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.630]  with the commissioner.
[01:49:08.630 --> 01:49:11.670]  And she said something to me that just moved me.
[01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.510]  She said, of course.
[01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:16.950]  And I said, she said, I'm blessed to have a great team
[01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:20.030]  and you're welcome.
[01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:21.550]  We're glad to be here for you.
[01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:24.070]  She said, we are public servants.
[01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:25.110]  That is our job.
[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:27.590]  It was the first time that I had associated
[01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:29.670]  a government worker with the term public servant.
[01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:31.990]  The last time I heard public servant
[01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:34.310]  was when my grandparents used to talk
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:36.670]  about government agency.
[01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:39.310]  And obviously I'm coming from the cannabis industry bias.
[01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:40.990]  This is where I have been.
[01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:44.950]  And so it's very hard having been on the wrong side
[01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:47.750]  of the persecution stick for a number of years
[01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:52.510]  to see government as a partner or a public servant.
[01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:56.550]  But it felt good to hear that coming from government agent
[01:49:56.550 --> 01:50:00.670]  that they were there to assist me and help me
[01:50:00.670 --> 01:50:02.070]  in a way that enabled me.
[01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:06.550]  So that's kind of why I'm really enjoying my shift
[01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:08.550]  in my transition to hemp.
[01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:13.230]  Because now I feel like I have a partner.
[01:50:13.230 --> 01:50:15.190]  Like you're just a farmer.
[01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:16.990]  I'm just a farmer.
[01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:18.030]  That's all I wanted to be.
[01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:21.430]  I just wanted to be a farmer and focus on my work.
[01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:25.070]  Like this isn't about organized crime
[01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:26.430]  or minting a bunch of money.
[01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:28.150]  It's about a culture.
[01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:28.990]  It's about a lifestyle.
[01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:32.790]  It's about a, and it's refreshing.
[01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:34.750]  So that's my favorite.
[01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:35.910]  Can I just add in here?
[01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:38.990]  I have mixed feelings because after hearing you talk
[01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:42.990]  I can't help but think that hemp's gain is cannabis's loss.
[01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:45.710]  Why is that?
[01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:46.710]  Because we need you.
[01:50:47.670 --> 01:50:49.350]  We need people like you.
[01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:50.190]  Thank you.
[01:50:50.190 --> 01:50:52.070]  Well, I'm here and I'm not going anywhere.
[01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:55.670]  And like to me cannabis and hemp are the same thing.
[01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:58.230]  I think this is a great opportunity for,
[01:50:59.310 --> 01:51:01.710]  I need to channel my energy somewhere.
[01:51:01.710 --> 01:51:03.510]  Like Santa Cruz County has made it impossible
[01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:06.190]  for me to like operate within the cannabis space.
[01:51:06.190 --> 01:51:08.670]  But hemp is cannabis.
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:10.470]  The only difference is that I'm not
[01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:13.230]  in the THC realm of things.
[01:51:13.230 --> 01:51:15.030]  It's all hemp at first.
[01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.870]  It's all hemp.
[01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:17.950]  It really is all hemp.
[01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:20.790]  So from a specific,
[01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:24.750]  what's the word I'm looking for?
[01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:27.230]  Basically when you first decided
[01:51:27.230 --> 01:51:29.550]  that you want to go the hemp route,
[01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:32.230]  you know, with a 0.3% limit,
[01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:37.230]  where did you source your initial stock to play with?
[01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:43.830]  So my germplasm, I actually already had some.
[01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:47.070]  Because you didn't have a bunch of 0.3% seeds in your,
[01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:47.910]  you did.
[01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:50.310]  I didn't have a bunch of 0.3%,
[01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:53.150]  but I had an Afghan heirloom
[01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:57.710]  that I had received as a last gift from my father
[01:51:59.190 --> 01:52:01.590]  who had been working in Afghanistan at the time.
[01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.670]  And I found a variety in there
[01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:07.750]  that tests as federally compliant hemp
[01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:09.870]  with really high percentage of THC.
[01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:12.310]  Not CBD, not THC.
[01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:16.670]  And so I had this great stock and it's unique
[01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:19.310]  in that many cannabis varieties
[01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:24.350]  will move all cannabinoids in ratio.
[01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.030]  This variety doesn't.
[01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:29.030]  The THC caps out.
[01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:31.950]  And depending on how good you grow the plant,
[01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:35.110]  you'll get a much higher percentage of CBD,
[01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:39.150]  whereas the THC stays the same.
[01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:40.790]  It locks in at 0.27.
[01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:46.150]  But it'll produce at the highest
[01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.390]  that I've got it to produce at is a 39 to one ratio
[01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:52.430]  where we get it in the 19% CBD range.
[01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:57.430]  And then it still stays at 0.27 in terms of THC.
[01:52:57.790 --> 01:53:01.430]  So that's my foundational stock right there.
[01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:04.470]  Sourcing genetics, I've been blessed by,
[01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:06.270]  we had also been working with some Panama Red
[01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:08.070]  when we were at Coastal Seeds.
[01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:11.110]  And that had a large number of high CBD varieties.
[01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:14.590]  And so I'm registered for both as a research institute
[01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:17.630]  for my hemp breeding, as well as the production.
[01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:20.510]  Everything that goes in my production field
[01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:23.430]  has to be below 0.3.
[01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:27.470]  In my research field, in my research space,
[01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:32.470]  it's okay if something tests a little bit hot
[01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:34.830]  as long as I'm continuing to work on selection
[01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:37.830]  that is working towards stuff that won't test hot.
[01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:39.710]  None of that can ever come to market.
[01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:44.750]  So I have to destroy anything that is above 0.3 THC.
[01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:49.430]  But that doesn't mean that I have to destroy the seed.
[01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:52.390]  See that's often because as long as I'm working that line
[01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:55.790]  and continuing the progress towards producing hemp,
[01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:57.990]  I can keep it in that research space
[01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:59.750]  and continue to work towards that.
[01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:03.910]  And then when I've actually achieved the research goals,
[01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:06.390]  then I can move it into the production fields
[01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:08.590]  for production.
[01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:12.510]  So I have a lot of freedom
[01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:14.990]  to work towards those cultivars.
[01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:16.630]  And there's also the generosity.
[01:54:16.630 --> 01:54:18.230]  Instagram's a great place.
[01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:20.790]  There are a bunch of people
[01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:23.150]  who know about the journey that I'm making
[01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:25.790]  and the transition who have had seeds
[01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:28.710]  and have sent me seeds or given me seeds.
[01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:32.990]  I met somebody who gave me some feral seeds.
[01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:35.190]  They'd gone out to Nebraska.
[01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:36.630]  They'd found it in the field.
[01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:40.510]  And so it's just a lot of it's community.
[01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:43.390]  Where has all this stuff ever come from?
[01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:45.710]  From the culture and the community that exists
[01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:47.470]  and the networks that we have
[01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:50.630]  and the kindness of different people's collectors
[01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:52.150]  and breeders out there in the field.
[01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:54.470]  And so shout out to everybody out there
[01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:57.590]  who's doing their part to preserve and share seed.
[01:54:57.590 --> 01:55:01.030]  It's so important that we keep our germplasm open
[01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.710]  and that we continue to share.
[01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:05.430]  Dan, I had a question.
[01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:09.790]  Before you even mentioned that, I was gonna ask you,
[01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:15.510]  who's your favorite genetic house right now
[01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:19.630]  and what are they working on that you are excited about
[01:55:19.630 --> 01:55:21.830]  to see what's gonna come to fruition out of?
[01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:25.590]  My favorite genetic house is,
[01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:29.190]  I don't know that I have a favorite genetic house.
[01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:34.710]  I think I really like the work that Bodhi does
[01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:36.630]  from Bodhi Seeds.
[01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:40.230]  I like the Myrica Seed Trust.
[01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:43.910]  I like the fact that he makes a lot of land-raised genetics
[01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:47.310]  open to the people.
[01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:49.430]  I love Dean Jean's work.
[01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:50.310]  He crushes it.
[01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:51.870]  All of his stuff is fire.
[01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:55.270]  I have different favorites for different reasons.
[01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:58.870]  But in general, those that are out there sharing seed
[01:55:59.550 --> 01:56:03.110]  and pushing the boundaries and trying to make things open
[01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:05.510]  and don't come from the hoarding mentality
[01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:08.830]  or the ego mentality are the ones
[01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:11.790]  that I really have the most respect for.
[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.350]  I'm hoarding a bunch of Bodhi Seeds
[01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:19.270]  of his Iranian snow lotus crosses.
[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:21.830]  So if you ever wanna mess with those, let me know
[01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:23.950]  because they're just sitting in my freezer right now.
[01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:24.790]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:25.830]  It's on the train.
[01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:29.550]  So ever since I saw that he had those on the list,
[01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:34.550]  I think I bought a lot of packs in 2017 Emerald Cup.
[01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:37.990]  Anything that was crossed with the sky lotus
[01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:40.190]  or the snow lotus, I picked up.
[01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:44.790]  You know, a lot of the guys who have got my germplasm
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:47.150]  from and who I really have umpteen respect for right now
[01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:48.870]  are not even famous breeders.
[01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:52.150]  They're just guys that have like followed me on Instagram
[01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:55.710]  and they hit me in the DM and say,
[01:56:56.590 --> 01:56:58.670]  hey, I have this, you want it?
[01:56:59.590 --> 01:57:01.550]  And I'm like, hell yeah, score.
[01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:04.270]  You know, like it's really the generosity
[01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:08.150]  of the community that has helped me
[01:57:08.150 --> 01:57:09.750]  to continue on my journey.
[01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:12.790]  So props to all you out there in the community
[01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:17.110]  doing your part, you know, like that's the fuel to my fire.
[01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:24.270]  So what's your business vision for the hemp breeding?
[01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:29.070]  Or is it like, are you gonna be planting fields yourself
[01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:30.630]  or do you wanna just be a breeder
[01:57:30.630 --> 01:57:32.870]  and selling seeds to other people?
[01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:35.550]  So yeah, right.
[01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:39.510]  I think I wanna focus on being a breeder in a nursery.
[01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:42.470]  I love to cultivate, but until the regulations
[01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:46.350]  start to come more into what I would consider normal,
[01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:52.910]  I don't see myself planting huge fields of flower.
[01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:58.910]  I also wonder about the viability of the CBD market
[01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:03.950]  as hundreds and hundreds of acres come into production.
[01:58:04.670 --> 01:58:08.510]  What I really see is value added products, you know?
[01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:10.990]  So it's like, what are you gonna do with that CBD?
[01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:17.270]  And focusing on formulations that work
[01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:22.870]  with other bioavailable compounds from different plants
[01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:28.830]  and putting together winning combinations for people.
[01:58:30.190 --> 01:58:32.390]  In the CBD space, I particularly happen
[01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:34.870]  to really love caffeine mixed with CBD.
[01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:36.670]  I think it's an amazing combination.
[01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:41.950]  And so I am working with a farmer right now
[01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:46.950]  to produce our own CBD infused products.
[01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:50.310]  So I'm gonna be using CBD mixed with CBD
[01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:52.630]  and I'm gonna be using CBD infused coffee.
[01:58:53.630 --> 01:58:56.430]  But yeah, for me personally on the cultivator tip,
[01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:58.990]  I wanna focus on using my research space
[01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:03.350]  to develop coastal hardy hemp varieties
[01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:07.310]  and ideally unlock the potential of different cannabinoids
[01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:08.590]  and be able to produce seeds.
[01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:11.910]  Look, I have a small family farm.
[01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:14.710]  We have two acres of production, right?
[01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:15.550]  No, but guess what?
[01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:17.910]  I can empower 5,000 acres of hemp.
[01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:20.630]  On my two acres, how many pounds can I grow?
[01:59:20.630 --> 01:59:23.830]  I'm not producing 10,000 pounds on my two acres
[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:27.710]  but I could produce 2 million seeds, 3 million seeds.
[01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:32.710]  And if I focused on producing high quality seed
[01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:37.830]  that can be used in larger scale agriculture,
[01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:42.870]  I think that's like a niche that I can carve out for myself
[01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:45.710]  and still enjoy the work that I love,
[01:59:45.710 --> 01:59:47.470]  which is working with the plants.
[01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:53.150]  Bam, aren't a lot of those large hemp farms
[01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:56.190]  coming online in Kentucky as well,
[01:59:56.190 --> 01:59:58.830]  being brought online by people who've never grown hemp
[01:59:58.830 --> 02:00:00.830]  or cannabis before.
[02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:03.750]  So I'm wondering, is there also an opportunity
[02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:06.470]  for you to, you're not growing it yourself,
[02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:11.470]  but help them grow the best hemp they possibly could?
[02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:13.830]  Sure, yes.
[02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:18.710]  And I'm open to doing consultations.
[02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:21.910]  I have done a number of interviews
[02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:26.430]  with different companies to do consultations.
[02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:28.110]  But I think a lot of times,
[02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:31.550]  at least what I've seen in my experience
[02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:36.550]  is that a lot of these new starters
[02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:39.790]  don't see the value in the wisdom
[02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:43.550]  that a lot of us growers possess.
[02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:46.310]  I'm sure that there are some out there,
[02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:50.230]  but if I had to say out of like the numerous interviews
[02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:53.430]  that I've gone to, maybe two people I've actually done,
[02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:55.590]  and the rest are just,
[02:00:57.590 --> 02:00:59.550]  you don't wanna work for $15 an hour?
[02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:04.710]  No, I'm sorry, I don't wanna travel 2,000 miles
[02:01:04.710 --> 02:01:07.470]  to work for $15 an hour when I live in California,
[02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:12.510]  which is like, it's not gonna cover the basic needs.
[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:17.430]  I think that the best way that I can actually do that
[02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:20.870]  is make their lives easier by producing hardy strains.
[02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:25.870]  Like my winter focus was on producing cold hardy selections
[02:01:26.150 --> 02:01:28.510]  that were gonna survive rough weather patches.
[02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:30.630]  If I could produce a seed that they pop,
[02:01:30.630 --> 02:01:33.550]  it's gonna do well, and it's a no brainer,
[02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:35.110]  I'm already empowering them.
[02:01:35.110 --> 02:01:37.430]  I'm already helping the uninitiated.
[02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:39.550]  I'm been asked to them.
[02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:44.510]  Like if I can produce a seed that's gonna do well
[02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:50.790]  in rough conditions and still give a good result,
[02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:54.950]  I think that that has more power of reach
[02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:57.910]  than me doing individual consultations
[02:01:57.910 --> 02:02:02.430]  with any specific company.
[02:02:02.430 --> 02:02:05.630]  And honestly, like my passion is to stay with the plant
[02:02:05.670 --> 02:02:07.670]  and work with it and grow it myself.
[02:02:07.670 --> 02:02:11.350]  Advising school, I like to do educational seminars
[02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:12.670]  and types of things.
[02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:15.550]  And I think maybe if that was kind of like my goal,
[02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:20.550]  I'd focus more on doing a blog or a video channel
[02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:24.030]  and get out that information for free.
[02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:25.790]  But the service that I wanna produce
[02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:28.390]  is to produce sustainable seeds
[02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:31.110]  that lead to sustainable outcomes.
[02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:33.390]  So just quickly, someone asked in the chat,
[02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:36.830]  how do I get a hold of your CBD seeds?
[02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:38.270]  Essentially your hemp seeds.
[02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:43.230]  I can be reached at info at stockandbean.com.
[02:02:43.230 --> 02:02:45.430]  Stock and Bean is the name
[02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:47.830]  of my cultivar development company.
[02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:55.190]  We'll be selling our seed at the Regenerative Seed Company.
[02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:57.110]  I think it's regenerativeseedco.com.
[02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:59.630]  That's probably the first place
[02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:01.910]  that I'll be releasing any of our seed.
[02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:07.750]  Now tell me one or two lessons you learned from Kagyu.
[02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:14.030]  Like about breeding and cannabis
[02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:17.030]  and genetics and cultivation.
[02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:21.350]  Two lessons about Kagyu.
[02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:22.750]  What did Yoda teach you?
[02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:26.230]  Oh man.
[02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:29.430]  It's a good question.
[02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:35.070]  I think he taught me how to humble myself.
[02:03:35.070 --> 02:03:39.390]  That was a really big lesson.
[02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:47.390]  I can't recall any specific tech,
[02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:49.910]  how to collect pollen.
[02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:52.430]  He showed me a couple of different techniques
[02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:53.750]  on how to collect pollen.
[02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:02.110]  Respect for the plant, respect for the lines.
[02:04:02.710 --> 02:04:04.670]  A lot of the technique that I've learned
[02:04:05.590 --> 02:04:09.110]  in terms of like technical aspect,
[02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:10.070]  I learned out of books.
[02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:13.550]  And I went to the UC Davis Plant Breeding Academy,
[02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:14.510]  a lot of that stuff.
[02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:17.830]  But it was more just like mentorship,
[02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:22.830]  like wisdom, sharing ideas,
[02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:27.630]  having that mind who gave me perspectives on history.
[02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:31.350]  He had been growing in the Santa Cruz Mountains
[02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:32.910]  since the 70s.
[02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:34.710]  And sometimes it's just,
[02:04:34.710 --> 02:04:38.790]  it's pieces of wisdom more so than knowledge.
[02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:42.590]  Wisdom is like the experience of having used that knowledge.
[02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:48.670]  And so as I would encounter different things,
[02:04:48.670 --> 02:04:52.990]  just having that ear of somebody who'd been through it
[02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:57.030]  and known that I can share and bounce the ideas off of,
[02:04:57.030 --> 02:05:00.430]  and then hear his different experience,
[02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:02.910]  helped to inform and shape my experience.
[02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:05.430]  Right.
[02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:06.270]  Right.
[02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:07.110]  All right.
[02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:10.150]  So we are already after four.
[02:05:10.150 --> 02:05:12.350]  So I wanted to throw one piece of red meat
[02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:14.310]  as a topic into the conversation,
[02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:15.390]  then we can call it a wrap.
[02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:18.830]  And that is Appalachian, it's coming.
[02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:22.710]  So Sam, we're gonna start with you
[02:05:22.710 --> 02:05:25.070]  because you had some thoughts on Appalachian
[02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:28.230]  and you're growing a native soil in Lake County.
[02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:31.510]  So you could have the Lake County Appalachian.
[02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:32.990]  So let's talk Appalachian.
[02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:36.430]  So I guess, first of all,
[02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:37.870]  some of you guys have probably heard me talk.
[02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:40.190]  I've been on a lot of panels with Frenchy
[02:05:41.230 --> 02:05:45.390]  and Justin and a few other people.
[02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:49.190]  One of my main things about Appalachians is like,
[02:05:49.190 --> 02:05:50.910]  if you look at the French system
[02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.150]  and you look at United States system,
[02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:56.630]  the French system is about an insane amount of control.
[02:05:56.630 --> 02:05:59.590]  And it's also, it attempts to tell the consumer
[02:05:59.590 --> 02:06:01.350]  what is a good product.
[02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:04.630]  And it's about cultural preservation on methodology.
[02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:09.470]  And that methodology is kind of hindered on zero change.
[02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:12.470]  But in the marketplace,
[02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:16.270]  its reasoning is to attempt to tell the consumer
[02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:17.710]  what is good and what is bad.
[02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:21.710]  The United States system is kind of goes along with,
[02:06:21.710 --> 02:06:25.150]  in the United States culture and laissez-faire capitalism.
[02:06:25.150 --> 02:06:29.190]  And it lets the consumer decide what is good quality.
[02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:35.550]  And with that comes a lot of issues.
[02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:39.030]  And so when you have a lot of people saying,
[02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:40.430]  hey, we want like a French system
[02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:42.150]  for cultural preservation,
[02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:44.190]  yet we wanna call our,
[02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:45.710]  we wanna say that we have terroir
[02:06:45.710 --> 02:06:50.710]  and we're rocking in happy frog soil.
[02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:52.630]  We're in a greenhouse.
[02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:57.070]  Those things are antonymous to what terroir is.
[02:06:57.070 --> 02:07:00.590]  I'd argue, and with the United States,
[02:07:00.590 --> 02:07:04.070]  great with the grape viticulture areas,
[02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:05.430]  that if you use Roundup,
[02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:06.830]  you can't claim an app,
[02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:10.110]  you shouldn't be able to claim an appellation or a terroir
[02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:14.230]  because Roundup kills the microbiome of the soil.
[02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:17.230]  And so, I'm not saying the United States system
[02:07:17.230 --> 02:07:19.510]  is perfect or better,
[02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:22.630]  but I also don't think that what a lot of these,
[02:07:22.630 --> 02:07:24.150]  a lot of people are trying to instill
[02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:28.510]  in the California appellation system for cannabis,
[02:07:29.590 --> 02:07:30.830]  they wanna say, oh, well,
[02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:32.590]  we've worked with the soil for 20 years
[02:07:32.590 --> 02:07:34.310]  and it's regenerative and such.
[02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:37.270]  And it's like, yeah, but it's still not native soil.
[02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:38.950]  It's still not native soil.
[02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:42.150]  And so my kind of two thesis points
[02:07:42.150 --> 02:07:46.750]  of California cannabis appellations are 100% native soil,
[02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:49.270]  less than 2% by volume inputs.
[02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:52.630]  And I've written comments to CDFA about this
[02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:54.710]  when they were just doing their thing.
[02:07:54.710 --> 02:07:59.710]  And then also that there can be no covering
[02:07:59.710 --> 02:08:01.670]  between you and the sun,
[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:03.590]  if you actually want to be,
[02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:05.790]  to actually declare yourself an appellation.
[02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:08.150]  Another thing is like,
[02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:09.550]  I just don't think that,
[02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:11.630]  unfortunately, consumers care about it right now.
[02:08:11.630 --> 02:08:14.910]  It's gonna matter in 10 or 20 years for sure.
[02:08:14.910 --> 02:08:17.550]  But right now there's such a select few people
[02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:19.470]  that actually care about it.
[02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:25.550]  I assume Frenchy would agree with what you just said, right?
[02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:27.150]  Does he disagree with any of that?
[02:08:27.150 --> 02:08:32.150]  I always feel like when his veins start popping,
[02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:35.190]  it's when people are calling something appellation
[02:08:35.190 --> 02:08:38.870]  that isn't what the French definition of appellation is.
[02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:41.190]  Well, their side of it's like,
[02:08:41.190 --> 02:08:42.950]  I think a little bit more on like,
[02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:45.910]  they wanna have extreme control.
[02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:48.190]  Sorry, who's they, the French?
[02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:51.070]  No, there's people in the cannabis community
[02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:52.750]  that they want to say,
[02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:54.590]  hey, you can't grow Long Valley Kush
[02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:55.790]  outside of Laytonville
[02:08:57.470 --> 02:09:01.630]  and call it and use that destination of the name
[02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:05.070]  or they wanna use different strain issues like that.
[02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:06.630]  But then there's also a lot of folks,
[02:09:06.630 --> 02:09:09.790]  I mean, I've argued with someone in San Francisco
[02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:13.870]  about how their different warehouses of indoor
[02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:15.630]  had different appellations.
[02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:17.710]  I'm not kidding.
[02:09:17.710 --> 02:09:21.070]  Like someone legitimately tried to argue that point to me
[02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:26.270]  because of, and I was just kind of like, what?
[02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:28.150]  So there's just a lot of folks that I think
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:31.510]  the biggest one to me that most of the cannabis,
[02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:33.830]  where I differ than most of the cannabis community
[02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:36.310]  is soil that you can't,
[02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:40.950]  I don't think you'll be able to use any import soil
[02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:43.150]  whatsoever and still call yourself an appellation
[02:09:43.150 --> 02:09:46.310]  or even necessarily designate a county of origin
[02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:47.710]  without having native soil.
[02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:50.990]  But it also has to be in the ground.
[02:09:52.110 --> 02:09:53.470]  Yep, yep.
[02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:56.590]  But terroir also encompasses so much more
[02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:57.430]  than just the soil.
[02:09:57.430 --> 02:10:00.710]  It also encompasses the people and the culture
[02:10:00.710 --> 02:10:03.510]  and the practices of the people that are cultivating it.
[02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:05.190]  I think that often gets lost.
[02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:07.190]  And I'm not taking away anything from what you're saying,
[02:10:07.190 --> 02:10:09.430]  but if you wanna get down to like the argument
[02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:12.750]  about like the warehouses in San Francisco,
[02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:14.950]  there's a culture behind that.
[02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:17.630]  There's a culture and that there are people behind that.
[02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:21.030]  And they definitely influence it because you plug and play
[02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:22.990]  and take some growers from Sacramento
[02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:25.310]  and put them into the same warehouse,
[02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:27.430]  it's going to change the outcome.
[02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:32.430]  And so there are arguments to be made
[02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:36.270]  for an appellation of the different neighborhoods,
[02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:39.950]  especially when you consider the people that are involved.
[02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:42.590]  And I think that's one of the most important aspects
[02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:46.870]  of an appellation or terroir is the people.
[02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:49.750]  It's the relationship between the people
[02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:54.470]  that are cultivating and the plants that helps to define.
[02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:56.150]  We're not talking about land raise here.
[02:10:56.150 --> 02:10:57.990]  We're not talking about plants in the wild.
[02:10:58.030 --> 02:11:02.910]  We're talking about plants that undergo a daily interaction
[02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:07.550]  with the workforce and the cultural practices.
[02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:10.310]  And if you wanna get back to the French definition
[02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:13.710]  of appellation, one of my issues with them is a lot
[02:11:13.710 --> 02:11:15.790]  of that stuff was said in the 1700s.
[02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:18.390]  They're like, okay, if you're in this section of soil,
[02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:19.750]  now you're a grand crew.
[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:22.710]  And if you're over here, you're such and such.
[02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:24.950]  And that takes away from the terroir
[02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:26.750]  of the people that are building the soil.
[02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:29.270]  When I got my property, it was all clay.
[02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:30.590]  I built hugelkultur beds.
[02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:32.310]  I did permacultural practices.
[02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:33.310]  I did chopped and dropped.
[02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:37.190]  And I turned a lot of my clay into loam.
[02:11:37.190 --> 02:11:41.590]  And so is it native soil?
[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:45.470]  It's natively built soil, right?
[02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:50.390]  And if I can do that in five years,
[02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:52.750]  how is it that in 300 years,
[02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:56.350]  everybody who was still grand crew back then
[02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:59.830]  is a grand crew right now because of a map
[02:11:59.830 --> 02:12:02.630]  that was defined way back then.
[02:12:02.630 --> 02:12:04.390]  That's something I don't wanna see.
[02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:05.550]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:06.390]  I agree with that.
[02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:09.110]  Because that's, yeah, who developed those maps?
[02:12:09.110 --> 02:12:10.550]  It was like the large landowners,
[02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:14.190]  the kings and the queens, oligarchy of that time.
[02:12:14.190 --> 02:12:16.870]  And I guess the one thing that I'd say we disagree on
[02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:21.190]  is the fact that the culture side of it of people,
[02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:25.870]  you can either classify terroir through science
[02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:28.470]  or you can classify it through a cultural aspect.
[02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:31.750]  And one of the things that a lot of,
[02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:36.670]  in order to designate your own AVA in the United States,
[02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:39.510]  you have to prove scientifically that it has,
[02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:44.390]  the climate and the soil and everything around it
[02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:48.390]  leads to a different outcome in the end product.
[02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:51.470]  And one of the issues with the cultural side of it
[02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:54.470]  is that, yeah, there's methodologies of such
[02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:56.110]  that could lead you to,
[02:12:56.110 --> 02:12:59.070]  but if it's not, if you take a person out of it
[02:12:59.070 --> 02:13:01.870]  and it's not replicatable in the same place,
[02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:04.750]  then it wouldn't really have terroir in that location.
[02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:08.190]  Then it's just an entire humanistic aspect of it.
[02:13:13.670 --> 02:13:14.510]  I don't know.
[02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:20.830]  I think that you can break down the culture
[02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:22.390]  to a scientific level.
[02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:25.950]  The methodology and the practices of the people
[02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:30.830]  that are working has a very scientifically describable
[02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:35.110]  and measurable effect and impact on the plant.
[02:13:35.110 --> 02:13:37.670]  Yeah, I could see that.
[02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:40.750]  I think back to your statement earlier
[02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:43.830]  about soil building,
[02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:45.670]  that's a very different level of soil building
[02:13:45.670 --> 02:13:50.670]  than say, adding 10% perlite to your native soil.
[02:13:50.710 --> 02:13:51.550]  Sure.
[02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:54.150]  And that's my problem that I have with,
[02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:57.790]  we started with 20 years ago,
[02:13:57.790 --> 02:14:00.190]  we got a truckload of ancient forest
[02:14:00.190 --> 02:14:01.230]  and that's what we started with.
[02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:02.430]  And now it's regenerate,
[02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:04.430]  it's a very different thing than actually
[02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:08.510]  going through biodynamic methodologies on your own property
[02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:10.270]  with everything from your property.
[02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:12.590]  It's a very different aspect.
[02:14:12.590 --> 02:14:15.270]  I think one thing about like, for instance,
[02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:17.390]  I guess my, we were talking about a lot earlier
[02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:19.670]  about just the regulatory burden
[02:14:19.670 --> 02:14:21.590]  and the regulatory framework.
[02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:26.670]  What I don't like about what a lot of people
[02:14:27.190 --> 02:14:28.830]  in the cannabis industry are advocating for
[02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:30.590]  with Appalachians is,
[02:14:30.590 --> 02:14:33.670]  and essentially a whole entire other regulatory framework
[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:35.270]  that you have to operate within
[02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:37.430]  to try to get some market viability.
[02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:40.910]  And that is where I'm kind of like,
[02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:42.670]  wait, I gotta do all these set of rules
[02:14:42.670 --> 02:14:43.550]  and all these set of rules,
[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:45.630]  now I'm supposed to do all those set of rules
[02:14:45.630 --> 02:14:48.390]  that I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
[02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:50.310]  I think it's a hard,
[02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:52.430]  that's a hard sell for me
[02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:55.830]  when people are asking for an extremely high
[02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:59.030]  regulatory burden just to claim an Appalachian.
[02:14:59.030 --> 02:15:01.950]  So if you wanna get the organic certification
[02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:04.350]  and the Appalachian designation,
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:07.830]  you got a lot of regulatory hurdles to jump through.
[02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:10.110]  For the record, I'm doing both of those.
[02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:11.230]  I'm gonna do both of those.
[02:15:11.230 --> 02:15:15.190]  So just, I'm gonna go through the hoops to do it
[02:15:15.190 --> 02:15:16.990]  because I believe in it.
[02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:18.950]  But at the same time,
[02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:21.550]  I hope that it's not so cumbersome
[02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:26.550]  that it makes it a really hard business decision.
[02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:28.150]  I hope it's an easier business decision
[02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:30.430]  and easier to sell to my partners.
[02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:31.910]  Well, I think one thing that's really important
[02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:34.590]  not to get lost here in this part of the conversation
[02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:36.550]  is the fact that regulation is actually leading
[02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:39.830]  to the death of Appalachians that have already existed
[02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:43.630]  before there was any like ABA or any board to dictate that.
[02:15:43.630 --> 02:15:45.710]  And I'm seeing that right here in Santa Cruz County.
[02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:49.590]  Like the traditional growing areas
[02:15:49.590 --> 02:15:51.350]  where the culture has existed,
[02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:53.350]  where the blue dream has come from,
[02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:55.070]  where all these other old,
[02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:59.830]  Big Sur, Holy Weed and a lot of other old strains
[02:15:59.830 --> 02:16:02.990]  were founded and based are being eradicated
[02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:07.110]  by conditional use permits and zoning regulations
[02:16:07.110 --> 02:16:11.190]  that don't align with health and safety
[02:16:11.190 --> 02:16:16.190]  or cannabis and just,
[02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:18.830]  they have to do with other agendas.
[02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:23.830]  But that's the silent killer of the existing Appalachia.
[02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:27.270]  And I can only speak firsthand about Santa Cruz County
[02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:28.390]  because that's what I live.
[02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:31.030]  And I hate to like keep bringing it back
[02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.950]  to Santa Cruz County,
[02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.310]  but that's my frame of reference
[02:16:33.310 --> 02:16:35.830]  because that's where I'm at.
[02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:38.190]  And I know that there's growers in Calaveras
[02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:40.830]  and growers in Nevada County and Yuba
[02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:46.470]  who are all experiencing different forms of barriers.
[02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:49.110]  And they have a tragedy.
[02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:54.990]  The tragedy for us to lose these heritage terroirs
[02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:58.670]  to things like F1 permits.
[02:16:59.630 --> 02:17:01.230]  Yeah, whatever you call them,
[02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:03.270]  the tragedy is losing them.
[02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:05.190]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:06.030]  Yeah.
[02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:10.710]  All right, well, gentlemen on that,
[02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:12.510]  we just passed 420.
[02:17:12.510 --> 02:17:14.430]  I got a five-year-old
[02:17:14.430 --> 02:17:16.390]  who I promised to go rollerblading with.
[02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:21.390]  So we will wrap on the Appalachian conversation.
[02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:25.190]  I appreciate your time and your stories
[02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:28.990]  and have a great weekend.
[02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.830]  Thanks for having us.
[02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:31.510]  Good being with all you guys.
[02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:32.350]  Thank you.
