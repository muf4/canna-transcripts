[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  Okay Gemma, what are we looking at right now?
[00:01.680 --> 00:02.680]  A praying mantis.
[00:02.680 --> 00:03.680]  Nice.
[00:03.680 --> 00:08.680]  Alright Gemma, bring the bug.
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.000]  Here, give me the top.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.960]  Alright, come over here.
[00:13.960 --> 00:17.400]  We pulled a bug off the, uh, okay here, give it to me.
[00:17.400 --> 00:18.400]  Give it to me.
[00:18.400 --> 00:19.400]  I got it, got it, got it, got it.
[00:19.400 --> 00:20.400]  Watch.
[00:20.400 --> 00:21.400]  It's upside down.
[00:21.400 --> 00:22.400]  I know.
[00:22.400 --> 00:23.400]  So watch.
[00:23.400 --> 00:24.400]  Here's the praying mantis.
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.400]  Oh, damn.
[00:25.420 --> 00:26.520]  It's all off.
[00:26.520 --> 00:27.520]  Where?
[00:27.520 --> 00:30.520]  I can't even see where the, yeah.
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.520]  It's right there.
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.520]  Yep.
[00:34.520 --> 00:48.060]  What if it doesn't eat it?
[00:48.060 --> 00:49.060]  Ugh.
[00:49.060 --> 00:50.060]  Come on praying mantis.
[00:50.060 --> 00:51.460]  It just took it.
[00:51.460 --> 00:52.460]  It just took it.
[00:52.460 --> 00:53.460]  Is it going to eat?
[00:53.460 --> 00:54.540]  Yeah, it's going to eat.
[00:54.540 --> 00:56.440]  So the...
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.160]  Hey, the mantis just took it.
[01:00.160 --> 01:02.080]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:02.080 --> 01:04.180]  Yeah, is he eating it?
[01:04.180 --> 01:05.180]  He sure is.
[01:05.180 --> 01:06.180]  He's...
[01:06.180 --> 01:07.180]  Munching on it?
[01:07.180 --> 01:08.180]  Doesn't that look yummy and delicious?
[01:08.180 --> 01:09.180]  No.
[01:09.180 --> 01:10.180]  I would not eat it.
[01:10.180 --> 01:11.180]  You wouldn't.
[01:11.180 --> 01:12.180]  The mantis likes it.
[01:12.180 --> 01:13.180]  Look at that.
[01:13.180 --> 01:14.180]  It's now, it's the domesticated mantis.
[01:14.180 --> 01:15.180]  It's just going to expect us to hand feed it every day.
[01:15.180 --> 01:16.180]  Can we do it a little bit more?
[01:16.180 --> 01:17.180]  Yeah, why?
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.180]  They can only eat one thing at a time.
[01:18.180 --> 01:19.180]  Can we give it another one?
[01:19.180 --> 01:20.180]  No, baby.
[01:20.180 --> 01:21.180]  Look at you.
[01:21.180 --> 01:22.180]  You just want to feed the mantis bugs, huh?
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.180]  Okay, so look at that.
[01:23.180 --> 01:24.180]  That is a good boy.
[01:24.180 --> 01:25.180]  He's eating it.
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.180]  He's eating it.
[01:26.180 --> 01:27.180]  He's eating it.
[01:27.180 --> 01:28.180]  He's eating it.
[01:28.180 --> 01:29.180]  He's eating it.
[01:29.180 --> 01:30.180]  He's eating it.
[01:30.180 --> 01:31.180]  He's eating it.
[01:32.180 --> 01:42.320]  Okay, so look at that, that is a good...
[01:42.320 --> 01:45.320]  It doesn't even care that we're here.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.320]  Isn't that cool?
[01:46.320 --> 01:47.320]  Yeah.
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.320]  Like, look how big that mantis is.
[01:49.320 --> 01:56.320]  And it's totally eating this bug that wants to eat our plants, right?
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.320]  Mm-hmm.
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.320]  And do we like bugs that eat our plants?
[02:01.320 --> 02:02.320]  No.
[02:02.320 --> 02:03.320]  Not so much.
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.320]  We don't dislike them, but not we...
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.040]  We like, we don't mind them when they're just a couple of them,
[02:09.960 --> 02:16.920]  but when they bring all their friends to the plant, but yeah that is...
