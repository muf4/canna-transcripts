[00:00.000 --> 00:08.060]  And let me.
[00:08.060 --> 00:18.060]  All right, we are live on YouTube. Welcome, everybody. We're going to be talking about a new tool law enforcement has in its arsenal.
[00:19.060 --> 00:37.060]  A civil tool to go against cultivators in this case specifically in Humboldt, that is abatements, which carries stiff penalties if you are out of compliance so we're going to talk with Ed Denson Nicole Norris and Robert, I'm going to hand it to you and you can kick us off.
[00:38.060 --> 00:46.060]  Hey, thanks Peter for inviting me on to moderate this program today. We'll be discussing an important topic to the Humboldt County community.
[00:46.060 --> 00:53.060]  The Humboldt County cannabis abatement program and its effects on the community since its inception.
[00:53.060 --> 01:12.060]  We're going to have two special guests today to join the conversation. We're going to be talking to esteemed local attorney Ed Denson and local reporter correspondent Nicole Norris who has extensively covered this subject here in Humboldt in local media.
[01:12.060 --> 01:28.060]  For those of our listeners and our viewers tuning in who may not be aware of the subject. The cannabis abatement program was the county's design strategy to try to eliminate the unregulated farms from the Royal rural land landscape would.
[01:28.060 --> 01:36.060]  So yeah, we're just waiting to hear from Ed, Ed and Nicole will be joining us briefly.
[01:37.060 --> 01:42.060]  Why don't you kind of give us the background of what of what's going on and what you've seen.
[01:42.060 --> 01:59.060]  Sure. So basically you know we rounded the corner on legalization in 2017. And at that time you know they they throw this number around that there was somewhere in the neighborhood of you know maybe 10 to 12,000 farms that existed in rural Humboldt County.
[02:00.060 --> 02:16.060]  And they basically had to design a strategy to eliminate a large number of these farms and prior to legalization law enforcement was using criminal penalties, which sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't.
[02:16.060 --> 02:26.060]  So when we rounded the corner on legalization, they came up with this new strategy where it was going to shift to civil penalties rather than criminal penalties.
[02:26.060 --> 02:49.060]  And in doing that, it hit the growers in their pocketbooks, rather than growers having to be hauled off to jail and serving long sentences, they were going to fine the growers anywhere from 10 to $30,000 a day for offenses such as maybe illegal road grading undersized culverts.
[02:50.060 --> 03:03.060]  And it could have even been associated with what we refer to as legacy issues legacy issues or issues that were on the property and existed before possibly the current property owner even own the property.
[03:04.060 --> 03:13.060]  And so you have this rural landscape in Humboldt County where you know the logging industry basically decimated a large portion of the landscape.
[03:13.060 --> 03:26.060]  And at that time, they weren't being as regulated or monitored. And so a lot of these things slip through that now the current owners, even if they've owned the properties for 30 or 40 years.
[03:26.060 --> 03:36.060]  Once all this stuff with legalization happened, all those issues associated with their properties came up as you know hot button issues.
[03:37.060 --> 03:53.060]  And so the county started this abatement program. They started a carpet bombing certain neighborhoods in the county with these letters threatening that people would be fined, like I said 10 you know to possibly $30,000 a day.
[03:53.060 --> 03:57.060]  And this really, you know, shook the community.
[03:58.060 --> 04:06.060]  And it's had you know unintended consequences. And, yeah.
[04:06.060 --> 04:14.060]  Yeah, so I'm trying to troubleshoot a ad logging in but it what what what.
[04:14.060 --> 04:29.060]  The most fascinating thing is that they're like we're not going to make as much money coming after someone for illegally growing 1000 plants, the stiffer penalty would be for finding that same person.
[04:29.060 --> 04:39.060]  You know, non compliant with, you know, having their greenhouse, you know, five feet too close to the neighbor's property.
[04:40.060 --> 04:56.060]  Correct. And the way they structured this is that these $10,000 a day fines could go on for 90 days. And so then after 90 days, you have a 900,000 bill with the county, and some people ended up walking away from their properties because it was just
[04:56.060 --> 05:04.060]  such steep fines and even if you hire a lawyer to try to resolve this situation. It's not a guarantee that it's going to be resolved.
[05:04.060 --> 05:20.060]  And what you had, and I was not paying attention because I was focused on Ed but what when you and I talked the other day we talked about like if a grape grower or what was your example like someone who does something else like, of course, they're fine.
[05:20.060 --> 05:42.060]  If you have a Napa County grape cultivation for wine without a permit, it's find it 1% of Humboldt County's cultivation fine, which is $100 a day. So it's, it's just ironic that Humboldt County set their, the fine at $10,000 a day, when for any other industry
[05:42.060 --> 05:48.060]  that exists in California, they're being fined it, you know, 1%.
[05:48.060 --> 05:53.060]  And Nicole just joined us. Welcome, Nicole.
[05:53.060 --> 05:57.060]  You're muted.
[05:57.060 --> 06:06.060]  Good morning. Thanks so much for having me sorry I'm running a little late. No worries. So you wrote a trilogy on this topic right on Kim count.
[06:06.060 --> 06:20.060]  Oh my goodness actually it's a four part series right now but there are so many aspects to it. I mean I'm certainly going to be continuing the series until hopefully the program stops.
[06:20.060 --> 06:22.060]  That's the goal.
[06:23.060 --> 06:38.060]  Do you want to kind of give us like the, if you gave us the the condensed cliff notes summary of articles one, two and three what what are kind of some of the key takeaways and findings of.
[06:39.060 --> 06:59.060]  Yeah, I mean it's a, it's a civil tool to punish people because it's more, I don't know if profitable would be the word or more a kick in the groin to farmers that then the criminal penalties and that's kind of the most surprising thing for me.
[07:00.060 --> 07:17.060]  You speak with most people in Humboldt County and they would prefer to have a raid happen on their property than to deal with an abatement. It's this program is is really criminalization, and the drug war in another fashion.
[07:18.060 --> 07:29.060]  People couldn't get through the permit process because it was so complex. The same department that was tasked with making the permit process is also tasked with enforcing people who haven't gone through it.
[07:30.060 --> 07:39.060]  So there's no incentive for them to really bring people into compliance. And you can see that in the numbers. I mean, they've collected.
[07:40.060 --> 07:54.060]  It's changed since I wrote that part three, but they've collected 16 million and property liens they've actually attached to properties 20 million has been approved in property liens in addition to that.
[07:55.060 --> 08:15.060]  And they've collected 4.7 million in, I mean cash from our community, and mostly in one district to district to that southern Humboldt, and that's the heart of the cannabis culture, really, which is what is such a loss about you know this, our whole community is really feeling the impacts.
[08:16.060 --> 08:20.060]  So, as you're showing here yeah this is part three.
[08:20.060 --> 08:23.060]  In this one, I go through all the figures.
[08:24.060 --> 08:49.060]  And the majority of the abatements, it's, it's about 36% went to smaller farms, I would say 6000 square feet or less. So, these people should have been, you know, given the welcome mat by the planning department they should have been given an easy path to compliance instead they got abated, while their neighbors who typically are larger, the majority of the people who were abated were actually the people who were in the abatement.
[08:50.060 --> 09:02.060]  And the majority of farms that are permitted right now are going to people with 10,000 square feet and larger, which by California agricultural standards is actually a medium sized farm.
[09:02.060 --> 09:11.060]  The 10,000 square foot to 20,000 square foot range is medium, and then 20,000 and above is a large farm by California agricultural definitions.
[09:12.060 --> 09:22.060]  So small farms are 10,000 square feet and less. And unfortunately, those are the people that are getting abated, and the people getting through the permit process are larger than that.
[09:24.060 --> 09:26.060]  Is that a good overview.
[09:26.060 --> 09:32.060]  I didn't really touch on the two people that I interviewed, but I'll hand it back to you.
[09:33.060 --> 09:34.060]  Go ahead.
[09:34.060 --> 09:44.060]  Yeah, it is a good overview I always like I told Peter the other day I always like to use my mountain as my perspective for what's going on in Humboldt County.
[09:44.060 --> 09:59.060]  And so the people that we used to refer to as the mega growers here in Humboldt County are most of the people who received permits on my mountain. And so everything that Nicole saying is absolutely spot on because we're dealing with.
[10:00.060 --> 10:10.060]  You know, a culture of the people prior to legalization were kind of frowned upon in the community. Now they're the people who are somewhat running the industry.
[10:11.060 --> 10:20.060]  Absolutely, absolutely. I mean just yesterday, for example, in the planning or the supervisors meeting that they had there, they're talking about making
[10:21.060 --> 10:30.060]  their proposals for a small farmer permit for 2000 square foot and less making it a little easier. At the same meeting they're talking about expanding.
[10:31.060 --> 10:39.060]  I think it's a 13 acre farm by like four acres, almost. I mean that's the landscape right now.
[10:40.060 --> 10:41.060]  And Ed, can you hear us.
[10:42.060 --> 10:44.060]  I can hear you. Can you hear me.
[10:45.060 --> 10:46.060]  We are so excited to be here.
[10:46.060 --> 10:53.060]  As far as I know, maybe like five super large farms like that where they're like seven acres or larger.
[10:54.060 --> 10:59.060]  While the little guys, of course, are struggling to barely get you know the 2000 square foot permit.
[11:00.060 --> 11:01.060]  That's the best we've done so far.
[11:03.060 --> 11:05.060]  And Ed, can you hear us.
[11:06.060 --> 11:08.060]  I can hear you. Can you hear me.
[11:09.060 --> 11:10.060]  We sure can. Welcome.
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.060]  Welcome Ed.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.060]  Thank you.
[11:14.060 --> 11:26.060]  My computer says my connection is unstable. And there's some other computer attempting to access.
[11:26.060 --> 11:27.060]  No, I'm blocking it.
[11:28.060 --> 11:29.060]  Okay.
[11:29.060 --> 11:32.060]  Got it. Well, you're coming in loud and clear.
[11:33.060 --> 11:43.060]  So, tell us about this new tool that law enforcement is using against, it seems, mostly small cultivators.
[11:45.060 --> 11:47.060]  If by this new tool you mean abatement?
[11:48.060 --> 11:49.060]  Yes.
[11:49.060 --> 11:52.060]  Yes. Okay. That's not law enforcement.
[11:53.060 --> 11:58.060]  It's an end run around law enforcement by the planning department.
[11:59.060 --> 12:14.060]  The Board of Supervisors in the middle of 2017 instituted a program of civil nuisance enforcement.
[12:14.060 --> 12:20.060]  They decided if you had a farm without a permit, that was a nuisance.
[12:21.060 --> 12:26.060]  And if it was in a greenhouse without a permit, that was the second nuisance.
[12:26.060 --> 12:31.060]  And if it was on a graded flat without a permit, that was the third nuisance.
[12:32.060 --> 12:34.060]  Okay. That's virtually everybody.
[12:36.060 --> 12:43.060]  And they put in penalties of $10,000 a day per nuisance.
[12:44.060 --> 12:51.060]  Per day. And each day that the nuisance continues is a new day.
[12:52.060 --> 12:57.060]  So, they've gotten fines up to $900,000.
[12:58.060 --> 13:13.060]  Have you ever seen anything like this where a daily penalty, like, can you find other industries or markets or where someone's fined $10,000 a day for anything?
[13:14.060 --> 13:19.060]  The state has now adopted similar penalties.
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.060]  There's really...
[13:25.060 --> 13:27.060]  Well, this amounts to forfeiture.
[13:28.060 --> 13:35.060]  And things have not been this bad since before Prop 215.
[13:37.060 --> 13:42.060]  This is the most serious enforcement, the most serious penalties.
[13:43.060 --> 13:55.060]  And the thing is that these, since they're going after you civilly, you don't have the same rights you have if they went after you criminally.
[13:56.060 --> 14:10.060]  So, it's much easier to impose these fines than it would be to impose, to go through a criminal process with the same evidence and get a conviction.
[14:12.060 --> 14:16.360]  This is Tom. I have a question.
[14:16.360 --> 14:32.360]  After reading the articles, it seems like the justification for the original action was to go after large, egregious operators and to leave the mom and pops alone, but that the exact opposite has happened.
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.360]  So, what's going on?
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.360]  I wish I knew.
[14:37.360 --> 14:41.360]  But John Ford consistently misleads the public.
[14:41.360 --> 14:47.360]  It wouldn't be popular for him to do this program if people really knew what was going on.
[14:48.360 --> 14:56.360]  So, consistently throughout press interviews and such, he'll say things like, oh, we've only made a couple mistakes.
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.360]  And then he'll come back and say, oh, we've had 13 mistakes, but we actually don't keep track, but we only had 13.
[15:03.360 --> 15:04.360]  And things like that.
[15:04.360 --> 15:09.360]  So, it's either he's not keeping track, which I think is a good thing.
[15:09.360 --> 15:15.360]  Or he's not keeping track, which I kind of know isn't true because I interview these people and I know their stories.
[15:15.360 --> 15:20.360]  I know they've reached out to John Ford the best that they can to explain to him that he's been wrong.
[15:20.360 --> 15:22.360]  His department's making a lot of mistakes.
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.360]  So, I think they're just in a state of denial.
[15:26.360 --> 15:30.360]  Should I invite him on to talk to us right now?
[15:31.360 --> 15:34.360]  You guys carry on. I'll email him right now.
[15:34.360 --> 15:36.360]  Are you serious? I would love that.
[15:36.360 --> 15:39.360]  I've been waiting to interview John Ford for so long.
[15:40.360 --> 15:43.360]  I've asked him so many times for an interview.
[15:43.360 --> 15:55.360]  And, you know, when reporters hold people, public officials accountable, they typically don't do interviews with them because, you know, they'll ask the tough questions, right?
[15:56.360 --> 16:04.360]  The program probably originally was designed to go after big growth.
[16:04.360 --> 16:11.360]  Ford said soon after the program began, all the big growth turned out to be licensed.
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.360]  Yeah.
[16:13.360 --> 16:20.360]  So, they had, what do you call it, gold slippage.
[16:20.360 --> 16:33.360]  Since all the big guys were licensed and they had this $200,000 or $300,000 satellite program, you know, they were all geared up to get somebody.
[16:33.360 --> 16:36.360]  So, they started getting the small people.
[16:36.360 --> 16:39.360]  Nicole, what's the smallest one you know of?
[16:40.360 --> 16:42.360]  160 square feet.
[16:42.360 --> 16:43.360]  Wow.
[16:43.360 --> 16:44.360]  There you go.
[16:44.360 --> 16:51.360]  Yeah. And really, you have to also consider the fact that the county satellite is inaccurate, too.
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.360]  So, that would have been 100 square feet, really.
[16:54.360 --> 17:01.360]  They can be inaccurate, I was told by an expert, three feet on either side.
[17:02.360 --> 17:11.360]  So, if you were talking 160 acres, or sorry, 160 square foot space, I mean, you can be inaccurate on that.
[17:11.360 --> 17:19.360]  The largest one was 95,000 square feet, I should say, but the next largest one was in like the 40,000 square feet, which is about an acre.
[17:19.360 --> 17:26.360]  And there are several licensed farms who are that size and larger, as I mentioned.
[17:26.360 --> 17:29.360]  So, I just sent John Ford an email.
[17:29.360 --> 17:32.360]  We'll see if he responds and jumps on.
[17:32.360 --> 17:44.360]  But, Robert, this is a critical point because you had mentioned to me that the satellite imagery that the county is relying on is completely inaccurate.
[17:45.360 --> 17:48.360]  And it's almost like you're guilty.
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.360]  They're like, you're too close to your neighbor's property.
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.360]  And you're like, no, I'm not.
[17:53.360 --> 17:59.360]  But the burden of proof is on you to correct their factual inaccuracy, right?
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.360]  Correct. Yeah, Nicole just made reference to that.
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.360]  The Humboldt County uses what's called GIS.
[18:05.360 --> 18:07.360]  And GIS is inaccurate.
[18:07.360 --> 18:15.360]  It's basically a guy in the Humboldt County Planning Division office, and he's putting squares and boxes around all the parcels that exist in our county.
[18:15.360 --> 18:25.360]  But he's not out there shooting lines using a transit on the ground and making accurate lines as if, you know, like he was an engineer.
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.360]  And so the county absolutely is using inaccurate imagery.
[18:31.360 --> 18:38.360]  One of the people I interviewed, actually, we know the dimensions of her garden space because she ended up getting a permit.
[18:38.360 --> 18:42.360]  That was part two, I believe, in the series.
[18:42.360 --> 18:49.360]  So she she basically had a 5,000 square foot space that they said was 10,000 square feet.
[18:49.360 --> 18:51.360]  It can be that inaccurate.
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.360]  So all of these numbers I'm giving you, imagine it's worse.
[18:56.360 --> 18:59.360]  So that's one example.
[18:59.360 --> 19:07.360]  Ed, the county, they've done such an incredible job with this abatement program locally that they actually received an award for it.
[19:07.360 --> 19:16.360]  I wanted you to talk about the award that the county was awarded for doing such a great job with the abatement program here in Humboldt.
[19:17.360 --> 19:28.360]  That award, I believe, was from the Association of County Governments, which is, well, is just what it sounds like.
[19:29.360 --> 19:44.360]  Estelle Fennell, the supervisor for District 2, where most of these abatements took place, is on the governing committee of that group.
[19:45.360 --> 19:52.360]  Estelle Fennell and John Ford, I believe, put together this program of abatement.
[19:52.360 --> 20:00.360]  And so, in effect, she's awarding herself for this program.
[20:00.360 --> 20:08.360]  It was effective in that it raised millions of dollars for the county in penalties.
[20:09.360 --> 20:18.360]  But in terms of justice, it's a complete washout.
[20:18.360 --> 20:27.360]  We're in court now challenging four of their conclusions.
[20:27.360 --> 20:30.360]  I should mention something, too.
[20:30.360 --> 20:33.360]  I protested that award.
[20:34.360 --> 20:40.360]  I sent them all a letter saying, you must be out of your minds to make this award.
[20:40.360 --> 20:43.360]  Nothing slows them down, of course.
[20:43.360 --> 20:46.360]  It was just one more piece of paper in the trash.
[20:46.360 --> 20:52.360]  But where was I going?
[20:52.360 --> 20:55.360]  You protested the award. You wrote a letter.
[20:55.360 --> 20:58.360]  And John Ford's feelings got hurt.
[20:59.360 --> 21:06.360]  This program is, in theory, an environmental program.
[21:06.360 --> 21:18.360]  It's the Humboldt Environmental something program, based on the theory that if they can't regulate it, it must be bad for the environment.
[21:18.360 --> 21:24.360]  Really, that's the premise.
[21:25.360 --> 21:35.360]  Can you talk a little bit about the arguments you're making in court and whether you think they'll prevail, specifically, what your arguments are?
[21:35.360 --> 21:38.360]  Yes, but I think we need to start at the beginning.
[21:38.360 --> 21:44.360]  You get an abatement notice, you've got 10 days to clear everything up.
[21:44.360 --> 21:47.360]  And if you do, there are no fines.
[21:48.360 --> 21:57.360]  If you run over the 10 days, unless they give you permission to run over, the fines start kicking in.
[21:57.360 --> 22:04.360]  10 per violation per day, they add up quite fast.
[22:04.360 --> 22:06.360]  You can appeal.
[22:07.360 --> 22:20.360]  But if you appeal, they are prohibited by the Humboldt County Code from giving you an appeal hearing for 15 days.
[22:20.360 --> 22:29.360]  So, in other words, if you appeal, you risk 15 days of these enormous fines.
[22:29.360 --> 22:49.360]  And then, when you get your hearing, the hearing officer, the civil equivalent of a judge, is there by contract with John Ford, the head of the planning department that is prosecuting him.
[22:49.360 --> 22:56.360]  So, the prosecutor is paying the judge.
[22:56.360 --> 23:06.360]  Right? By the hour, $240 an hour to run this so-called appeal hearing.
[23:06.360 --> 23:11.360]  So, needless to say, no one ever wins these hearings.
[23:11.360 --> 23:22.360]  Now, I've objected on grounds from the start to the finish.
[23:23.360 --> 23:29.360]  I've objected to the procedure. I've objected to them hiring the judge.
[23:30.360 --> 23:41.360]  I object to them classifying marijuana as a serious violation with these $10,000 penalties.
[23:41.360 --> 23:53.360]  I told them that the program is unconstitutional because marijuana is not a threat to the environment or to public safety.
[23:53.360 --> 24:00.360]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[24:00.360 --> 24:24.360]  I should say that the reason we're now in real court challenging these things is because I don't think this evidence will meet the standards that are legally required to take somebody's money or take their land.
[24:25.360 --> 24:31.360]  Are you asking for the program to be completely struck or do you want them to moderate how they apply it?
[24:32.360 --> 24:34.360]  These are individual cases.
[24:35.360 --> 25:01.360]  And so, I'm going in in each individual case and asking them to rule that the findings of the hearing officer, which is to say the verdict, were not legally adequate, not held up by evidence and is void, and that the penalties are void.
[25:02.360 --> 25:17.360]  If I win any one of these cases, it will destroy the program because the same reasoning I'm using, obviously anybody else could use if they wanted to go into court with it.
[25:20.630 --> 25:22.630]  Does that mean they're fighting it tooth and nail?
[25:23.630 --> 25:24.630]  Yes.
[25:24.630 --> 25:25.630]  Yeah.
[25:26.630 --> 25:40.630]  And there have been a couple of cases in ahead of mine and on one of them, a fellow named Kusada, the judge knocked the fines way down.
[25:41.630 --> 25:42.630]  They were still substantial.
[25:43.630 --> 25:44.630]  This is the real judge.
[25:45.630 --> 25:52.630]  And the county promptly appealed that and it's in the Court of Appeals now in San Francisco.
[25:55.630 --> 26:04.630]  The thing about these hearings are, before you get to court, are administrative law hearings.
[26:05.630 --> 26:12.630]  And it turns out there are very few challenges of those hearings in actual court.
[26:13.630 --> 26:24.630]  So, new law is being made, which is always more fun than old law, to make it, that is.
[26:25.630 --> 26:38.630]  So, it's quite possible that the county is going to be in court with us for several years on these cases.
[26:39.630 --> 26:43.630]  Yeah, they've only processed about, I think, 20 or 25, right, Ed?
[26:44.630 --> 26:49.630]  I think the last time in the CEU report they said they'd only had 20 or 25 hearings.
[26:50.630 --> 26:51.630]  Yeah.
[26:52.630 --> 27:01.630]  Yeah, and at the moment, well, of course, winter is coming, but at the moment, the abatement program has more or less stalled out.
[27:02.630 --> 27:10.630]  Their contract with California Hearing Officer LLC has expired.
[27:11.630 --> 27:19.630]  I don't know if they renewed it, but I haven't heard of them doing any further programs since I went to court on the first one.
[27:20.630 --> 27:23.630]  I should say there's another major law firm.
[27:24.630 --> 27:25.630]  There is another lawyer.
[27:26.630 --> 27:27.630]  They are a major law firm.
[27:28.630 --> 27:29.630]  I am a solo.
[27:30.630 --> 27:35.630]  But there is, that is also in there giving them a real hard time.
[27:36.630 --> 27:50.630]  We have come up with a theory that the fines themselves are prohibited by state law, that they cannot fine you more than $500 for marijuana.
[27:51.630 --> 27:52.630]  They can only do that once.
[27:53.630 --> 28:00.630]  Needless to say, they are contesting that quite strongly.
[28:01.630 --> 28:18.630]  Also, at the recent supervisors' meetings, they were asked to ratify a three-year contract for the satellites at just under $300,000 a year.
[28:19.630 --> 28:26.630]  So it sounds like perhaps the program is still ongoing.
[28:27.630 --> 28:32.630]  I should say there's no point in having those satellites for anything but for this.
[28:35.630 --> 28:36.630]  Ed, I don't know if you've heard about this.
[28:37.630 --> 28:43.630]  I actually submitted a records request to find out, but I heard that the satellite couldn't be paid for by the Planning and Building Department.
[28:44.630 --> 28:47.630]  And that's why they're not able to do it because it's only $300,000.
[28:48.630 --> 28:49.630]  They have millions.
[28:49.630 --> 28:51.630]  I'm sure they would pay for it, right?
[28:52.630 --> 28:54.630]  But I heard that they can't because it's a conflict of interest or something.
[28:55.630 --> 28:57.630]  It had to come from some sort of government funding.
[28:58.630 --> 28:59.630]  Did you hear about that?
[29:00.630 --> 29:02.630]  And maybe that was why there was no satellite this year.
[29:03.630 --> 29:05.630]  I'm looking into it, but I heard that recently.
[29:06.630 --> 29:07.630]  That's interesting.
[29:08.630 --> 29:09.630]  There was no satellite abatements this year.
[29:10.630 --> 29:14.630]  There was only about 26 abatements coupled with raids.
[29:15.630 --> 29:16.630]  I'm sorry, forgive me.
[29:16.630 --> 29:19.630]  There was a handful in the beginning of the year before the pandemic.
[29:20.630 --> 29:21.630]  Right.
[29:21.630 --> 29:23.630]  And, well, two things about that.
[29:24.630 --> 29:28.630]  The proper way for them to do this is to send in the sheriff.
[29:29.630 --> 29:45.630]  Because, for one thing, in August 2019, they went to the sheriff with, I don't know, what, 12, 15 cases and said, here's our evidence.
[29:46.630 --> 29:49.630]  We want you to go raid these people.
[29:50.630 --> 29:55.630]  Or, as they say politely, get a search warrant and serve it.
[29:56.630 --> 30:02.630]  And the sheriff looked at the evidence and promptly didn't do it.
[30:03.630 --> 30:12.630]  Instead, he sent the helicopters out to get real evidence so that he could ask for a search warrant.
[30:13.630 --> 30:30.630]  Obviously, he felt that all their satellite images and their suppositions of what they were seeing did not amount to probable cause, which is probable cause is a very low standard.
[30:31.630 --> 30:36.630]  It's a reasonable person would suspect a crime was going on.
[30:37.630 --> 30:51.630]  And the sheriff obviously didn't feel that the reasonable person looking at their satellite evidence, listening to their explanations, would believe that there was a crime.
[30:53.630 --> 30:59.630]  So, we'll see how that turns out, but I thought that was quite shocking.
[31:00.630 --> 31:14.420]  Yeah, it seems like with no on the ground verification used in the abatement program, it's just, it's, there's going to be more false positives are going to come up, and they've already happened.
[31:15.420 --> 31:25.420]  And, yeah, I just think the false positive scenario will continue until their eyes are on the ground like you just described, whether it's in a helicopter or they're actually putting boots on the ground.
[31:25.420 --> 31:36.420]  Yeah, in Trinity County, for example, they don't have which Trinity County for folks who are listening from outside of the Emerald Triangle. It's a part of the Emerald Triangle, it's just east of Humboldt County.
[31:37.420 --> 31:48.420]  Their daily fine, correct me if I'm wrong, Ed, is $100 a day, and they don't use satellites, it's only on the ground verification and Butte County.
[31:48.420 --> 31:53.420]  I believe it's also on the ground verification and the fine is a $500 daily fine there.
[31:54.420 --> 32:09.420]  My hometown county of Tehama, where they piloted this program, I've been informed in 2014 and 15, they completely ended outdoor cultivation, including medical and six plants.
[32:10.420 --> 32:18.420]  The only thing you can do in Tehama County is get a permit. Well in 2015 you could get a permit for an indoor and it couldn't be in a residence.
[32:19.420 --> 32:25.420]  So they piloted the satellite abatement or the abatement program they're using drones and
[32:26.420 --> 32:32.420]  else was it also helicopters and they're making, of course, so many mistakes, even with the helicopters and the drones.
[32:32.420 --> 32:41.420]  They're accusing people with maple trees and olive trees and actually horses were injured because they were flying so low out there.
[32:42.420 --> 32:50.420]  Just an interesting thing to juxtapose and you guys had asked earlier also about any other industry that has comparable fines and
[32:51.420 --> 33:00.420]  well everyone's always comparing cannabis to grapes for wine, right? It should be comparable, the industries at least, but their daily
[33:01.420 --> 33:13.420]  or actually they don't have a daily fine. It's a one time fine of $100 for your first violation growing grapes without a permit, which is essentially the problem here with the cannabis, just not having the permit.
[33:14.420 --> 33:29.420]  Well, I have argued too on this fines business that the people of the state of California have already spoken about the penalties for cultivation without permits.
[33:30.420 --> 33:46.420]  And they did that in Proposition 64. And when they spoke, what they said was, this is a misdemeanor and there should be not more than $500 fine.
[33:47.420 --> 33:58.420]  Now, they also allow, because it's in the criminal system, they allow jail time, but in fact they never impose it.
[33:59.420 --> 34:16.420]  So for the county to turn around and say, well, how about we run a system with practically no evidence, very low standards and charge not 500 once, but 10,000 a day.
[34:18.420 --> 34:26.420]  This, well, it's an attempt to override the voters is what's going on.
[34:29.420 --> 34:36.420]  The city of Sacramento had a similar program, but mostly for indoor growth.
[34:36.420 --> 34:54.420]  And that ended in a cascade of lawsuits. They've had to abandon the program because, well, it was essentially the same thing. They were actually seizing people's homes on very slight evidence.
[34:55.420 --> 34:56.420]  So.
[34:59.420 --> 35:15.420]  So this really sounds like government run amok. And the real question is why they're doing it, what the purpose is, and do you really think they want to drive these people out of their homes and for what purpose?
[35:16.420 --> 35:35.420]  A few years ago, when I talked to farmers in Humboldt about the abatements, which were really starting to ramp up then, one of the prevailing theories was, yeah, they want to run us out and have retired people come up and this will be the future.
[35:36.420 --> 35:42.420]  Is that this type of stuff you're hearing, you think is going on?
[35:43.420 --> 35:50.420]  I have a much less conspiracy theory about this thing.
[35:51.420 --> 36:06.420]  I think what happened was when they set up the licensing program, they set it up poorly, so poorly that they couldn't entice most of the growers into getting licenses.
[36:07.420 --> 36:20.420]  Then they were faced with two alternatives. Fix the program or, you know, the carrot or the stick. Fix the program or really go after the people who won't go into it.
[36:21.420 --> 36:42.420]  And the abatement program shows they decided to use the stick and just make it so destructive to your life to grow outside the program that you wouldn't do it.
[36:43.420 --> 36:54.420]  The problem with the retirement theory is we don't have the infrastructure for old people.
[36:54.420 --> 37:01.420]  And take it from me, I'm an old person and it's not here.
[37:01.420 --> 37:08.420]  And it's particularly not here on the lands that are being used for marijuana cultivation.
[37:09.420 --> 37:36.420]  If you get up into the deep mountains where this stuff's going on, up in the rancho, the far reaches of Salmon Creek and stuff, you are miles from the nearest paved road on a road that's almost impassable in the winter and could destroy your car just because of the potholes and ruts and stuff in the summer.
[37:37.420 --> 37:40.420]  Not inviting to retirees.
[37:40.420 --> 37:51.420]  I think the people that if they were after retirees, these are people who want nice houses in a suburb with a lawn.
[37:52.420 --> 38:08.420]  They do not want to be homesteading under primitive conditions away from medical care, away from reliable utilities and all that.
[38:08.420 --> 38:11.420]  Just, that's my thought.
[38:12.420 --> 38:21.420]  I don't think it's a conspiracy, though, to recognize that several of our supervisors are well known to have ties in the cannabis industry.
[38:21.420 --> 38:30.420]  And people, you know, shaping these policies, they're known to be affiliated with some of the major farms in the area.
[38:30.420 --> 38:33.420]  So it's a multi-billion dollar industry.
[38:33.420 --> 38:38.420]  Would Rex, I don't know how to pronounce his last name, would Rex Bone be one of them?
[38:38.420 --> 38:41.420]  He has a son named Trevor, correct?
[38:41.420 --> 38:44.420]  Yeah, Trevor, you can find his highlights.
[38:44.420 --> 38:49.420]  I guess he pepper sprayed some children that were involved.
[38:49.420 --> 38:52.420]  It's on Redheaded Black Belt from several years ago.
[38:52.420 --> 38:59.420]  But just to clue everyone in, so Rex Bone is a Humboldt County Board of Supervisors member.
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.420]  Yeah, District 1.
[39:00.420 --> 39:03.420]  So he has political power in Humboldt.
[39:03.420 --> 39:07.420]  His son is one of the license holders.
[39:07.420 --> 39:14.420]  His son has a cannabis license and his son has a criminal record for, as you just said, pepper spraying little kids.
[39:14.420 --> 39:23.420]  Yeah, associated with unpaid workers, too, which is pretty common in the permitted cannabis industry, believe it or not.
[39:23.420 --> 39:28.420]  I've actually worked for three permitted farms and I got paid by zero of them.
[39:28.420 --> 39:30.420]  Oh, that's not true.
[39:30.420 --> 39:33.420]  You got paid on one of them.
[39:33.420 --> 39:34.420]  One of them?
[39:34.420 --> 39:36.420]  After you went to court.
[39:36.420 --> 39:39.420]  No, no. Oh, God, we'll talk about that later.
[39:39.420 --> 39:41.420]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[39:41.420 --> 39:55.420]  So wait, Tom, just quickly, I wanted to show, because I'm going to move on from this, but this is the award you were talking about, State Association of Lodz, Humboldt County's cannabis enforcement efforts.
[39:55.420 --> 40:01.420]  Yeah, so so Virginia Bass, she's District 3.
[40:01.420 --> 40:02.420]  Thank you, Ed.
[40:02.420 --> 40:09.420]  She also received some campaign contributions, the maximum amount from a Canadian cannabis company.
[40:10.420 --> 40:21.420]  I don't know exactly where that led or what that means, but she's she was the president of CSAC, California State Association for Counties, who gave out this award.
[40:21.420 --> 40:25.420]  Estelle Fennell was the president like two years ago.
[40:25.420 --> 40:34.420]  And they're all, you know, on the board of directors now and in the elite cabinet.
[40:34.420 --> 40:36.420]  Yeah, that's Rex Fone there.
[40:36.420 --> 40:43.420]  And he he basically has the the honeydew farm complex of like 13 acres, I think, out there.
[40:43.420 --> 40:46.420]  It's horrible looking when you drive out honeydew.
[40:46.420 --> 40:51.420]  It used to be the most lovely drive and now it's just greenhouses for miles.
[40:52.420 --> 40:59.420]  Okay, so last question for me. This really sounds like a simmering story of government malfeasance and corruption.
[40:59.420 --> 41:16.420]  So your three part article over three months, which kudos to you for all of that research and doing it and getting your numbers backed up was a step, you know, really congratulations for for doing that.
[41:16.420 --> 41:22.420]  It was over three months, March, April and May. So so now we're in October.
[41:22.420 --> 41:39.420]  And my question is, has have you heard from anyone? Has there been any action from the PCC, from the legislature, from the governor's office, from any trade groups to to this expose?
[41:39.420 --> 41:42.420]  And just quickly that that's Trevor on the left, right?
[41:43.420 --> 41:44.420]  Yeah.
[41:44.420 --> 41:56.420]  Okay, so so the board of supervisors son, who pepper sprayed kids and seems like got arrested now has a seven acre cultivation in Humboldt County.
[41:56.420 --> 42:01.420]  So he was fast track because I know plenty of and speak up Humboldt Ridgetop Farms.
[42:01.420 --> 42:04.420]  How many of your friends are still waiting for their licenses?
[42:04.420 --> 42:08.420]  Yeah, many, many applied in 2017. And they're still waiting.
[42:08.420 --> 42:09.420]  That reminds me.
[42:09.420 --> 42:21.420]  Yeah, I have a friend. You know, what's interesting that the most recent list that I just got in July revealed that only 12 people who applied in 2016 have actually finished their permit.
[42:21.420 --> 42:27.420]  Several are in the interim phase. I also know a fellow who I'm covering. I'm doing a story on him next.
[42:28.420 --> 42:40.420]  He's just done everything he possibly could. He even applied early in 2016. Beautiful permaculture, small farm. It's it's ridiculous that it's taken him so long to just get that permit.
[42:40.420 --> 42:44.420]  We're making vaccines faster than that. Right.
[42:44.420 --> 42:59.420]  I think with regards to Ed's earlier sentiments, with regards to the objectives of the county and the reason they're doing this, it seems to me from the outside looking in, that it would be easier for the county to regulate and keep their eyes on 500
[42:59.420 --> 43:06.420]  permitted farms in the county, rather than 10,000 or 12,000 perfect permitted farms.
[43:06.420 --> 43:07.420]  Sure.
[43:07.420 --> 43:21.420]  I think, though, look at it as a jobs program for the county. It doesn't cost the money to regulate these farms, they charge fees for doing.
[43:21.420 --> 43:23.420]  They're.
[43:23.420 --> 43:35.420]  So, I don't, I don't know it's hard to get into the exact psychology of this. I just think that I'm, I'm probably repeating myself.
[43:35.420 --> 43:49.420]  But, but when they came up with this idea. It didn't work. And they couldn't figure out how to fix it. This is like beating your puppy for peeing on the floor.
[43:49.420 --> 43:53.420]  The puppy is peeing on the floor to appease you.
[43:53.420 --> 43:57.420]  And the response is you beat it some more.
[43:57.420 --> 44:00.420]  This isn't going anywhere.
[44:00.420 --> 44:08.420]  What we're doing with this is the county's economy is really in a shambles.
[44:08.420 --> 44:21.420]  I mean before the COVID thing business and Garberville was down 25 or 30% because of the mess from them doing the licensing and abatement program.
[44:22.420 --> 44:26.420]  And now the NGOs are going under.
[44:26.420 --> 44:35.420]  Because now no one has money to donate. We had a thriving community here. And they destroyed it.
[44:36.420 --> 44:57.420]  For me just quickly as an outsider down in LA looking in, I would think that the, you know, county of Humboldt would know damn well how they're making money as a community and supporting their citizens and community centers and things like that and they've completely bungled, you know, logins not coming back.
[44:57.420 --> 45:02.420]  What were the other ones? Was it mining, logging, fisheries?
[45:02.420 --> 45:08.420]  I mean, you guys are the Bordeaux of cannabis.
[45:08.420 --> 45:20.420]  And I also view it like, you know, I was in New York for 13 years and it's such a transient world where like everybody is not from there and you don't really have any community connections to other people.
[45:21.420 --> 45:46.420]  Again, this is my outsider's perception but like, these are communities where everybody, my assumption, generally knows other people and it's like you're abating and penalizing the father of a kid in your kid's school and crushing the dreams of people who, you know, are part of your community and shooting yourselves in the foot.
[45:47.420 --> 45:58.420]  Literally, like our volunteer firefighters, a lot of them had actually grown small farm, you know, farm cannabis, smaller farms, they had smaller farms, and they can't afford to do that anymore.
[45:58.420 --> 46:12.420]  Our t-ball coaches, our nonprofits, our schools, I mean people used to volunteer, our radio station, and a lot of people just can't afford to do that anymore because they don't have their 20 plants outside, which is tragic.
[46:17.420 --> 46:33.420]  So, it seems like there's a combination of kind of just stupidity and like if I get back to Rex Bone, nefarious shenanigans.
[46:33.420 --> 46:41.420]  But would you say kind of the building, John Ford's what the building and planning commissioner what's that department called?
[46:41.420 --> 46:44.420]  The planning and building department, he's the director.
[46:44.420 --> 46:57.420]  Is that just kind of like, when you look at what they're doing, like, do you put them in the nefarious bucket or the incompetent kind of stupidity shooting themselves in the foot bucket?
[46:57.420 --> 47:02.420]  Shooting themselves in the foot, absolutely. I mean, they have no incentive.
[47:02.420 --> 47:16.420]  They're definitely nefarious. I don't think they have an incentive to be honest with the public. I think they want people to think that oh everything's going great. They always, Rex Bone actually yesterday, the supervisors meeting was like hey, cannabis is going so well, we're leading the state.
[47:16.420 --> 47:26.420]  We're not leading the state when you compare what we had in farms prior to legalization. We're totally getting beat by Trinity, by Mendocino, by Santa Barbara counties.
[47:27.420 --> 47:50.420]  They had less farms to begin with and they're, you know, rivaling our numbers. So yeah, they're constantly harping into us saying that well they're approving these mega farms, there's multi billion dollars on the line, you know, maybe more eventually and so I do think there's definitely opportunity for corruption to happen and it's just the nature of regulatory capture, as they say.
[47:51.420 --> 47:56.420]  Is district one up for re-election this November?
[47:56.420 --> 47:59.420]  Shockingly, no.
[47:59.420 --> 48:03.420]  We thought this fellow was going to win but who?
[48:03.420 --> 48:06.420]  Yeah, Rex won the primary.
[48:06.420 --> 48:07.420]  I can't imagine.
[48:07.420 --> 48:11.420]  Estelle did not win the primary.
[48:11.420 --> 48:19.420]  She was not the loser, but she didn't get enough votes to have a majority.
[48:19.420 --> 48:33.420]  And I have no idea, of course that was back when COVID was just sort of starting. I have no idea what's going on in the supervisors campaigns.
[48:33.420 --> 48:34.420]  They have a meeting today.
[48:34.420 --> 48:36.420]  And here it is four weeks away.
[48:36.420 --> 48:37.420]  Yeah.
[48:37.420 --> 48:40.420]  But I don't know. I mean...
[48:41.420 --> 48:48.420]  Wait, but you're saying he's not up for any sort of vote right now but there was a primary before?
[48:48.420 --> 48:49.420]  He was not.
[48:49.420 --> 48:51.420]  Okay, so he is safe.
[48:51.420 --> 49:02.420]  When is Rex next up for us to put a candidate against him and put a heavy PR campaign behind that candidate?
[49:02.420 --> 49:09.420]  I think someone just tried to do that and it's got more to do with the lines of the zoning of, or sorry, the lines of the districts.
[49:09.420 --> 49:14.420]  Because Rex is representing Eureka, similar to Estelle with district two.
[49:14.420 --> 49:20.420]  She has all of Fortuna and these like, you know, city centers and then this very rural population.
[49:20.420 --> 49:24.420]  Same with Rex Bone. He's got this huge rural population that hates him.
[49:24.420 --> 49:25.420]  Same with Estelle.
[49:25.420 --> 49:28.420]  The rural folks, they're like, no, get these people out of office.
[49:29.420 --> 49:34.420]  But then the city dwellers, they align with their policies and they just keep voting for them.
[49:34.420 --> 49:37.420]  So I think we need to redraw the districts personally.
[49:37.420 --> 49:42.420]  Either in for two or four years.
[49:42.420 --> 49:44.420]  I don't know which.
[49:44.420 --> 49:45.420]  Two.
[49:45.420 --> 49:46.420]  Two?
[49:46.420 --> 49:47.420]  Yeah.
[49:47.420 --> 49:50.420]  Then 2022, Peter.
[49:50.420 --> 49:51.420]  Okay.
[49:51.420 --> 49:58.420]  So in a year and a half, we will all get back on and bring on the candidate running against Rex.
[49:58.420 --> 50:03.420]  Well, can you guys give a shout out to any how many supervisors are there in Humboldt?
[50:03.420 --> 50:05.420]  Five.
[50:05.420 --> 50:11.420]  And can you give a shout out to any who are truly like deserving of a pat on the back?
[50:11.420 --> 50:13.420]  Oh, yeah.
[50:13.420 --> 50:15.420]  Steve Madrone, District 5.
[50:15.420 --> 50:23.420]  He just got elected and beat the fellow that also got that Canadian cannabis money campaign contributions, Ryan Sundberg.
[50:23.420 --> 50:25.420]  He has a mining company, I believe, as well.
[50:25.420 --> 50:27.420]  But he beat him.
[50:27.420 --> 50:31.420]  And it's mostly because he's all rural residents and they know better.
[50:31.420 --> 50:32.420]  Right.
[50:32.420 --> 50:34.420]  Than to vote for that fellow again.
[50:34.420 --> 50:38.420]  District 5 is the north end of the county.
[50:38.420 --> 50:40.420]  Yeah, Steve Madrone is great.
[50:41.420 --> 50:45.420]  District 2, where I am, is Estelle Fennell.
[50:45.420 --> 50:47.420]  It's the south end.
[50:47.420 --> 50:59.420]  We had big expectations for Estelle when she got in office because she lived in the rural part of the county.
[50:59.420 --> 51:03.420]  She is or was a marijuana grower.
[51:04.420 --> 51:08.420]  She should have understood that the community.
[51:08.420 --> 51:13.420]  But, well, it is what it is.
[51:13.420 --> 51:17.420]  You give people power. With it comes responsibility.
[51:17.420 --> 51:24.420]  They have assumed the power, but not the responsibility.
[51:25.420 --> 51:36.420]  Just quickly, in the YouTube chat, City Soulshine Growing asked, is there a way people watching who have skills such as paralegals can help with this important work?
[51:36.420 --> 51:42.420]  Because it seems like a lot of what you guys are doing is not for high pay or compensation.
[51:43.420 --> 51:57.420]  How can people get involved in, and let's take the case study of Humboldt County, of kind of helping to sculpt policy in a sensible direction?
[51:57.420 --> 52:01.420]  Can they reach out to you guys?
[52:01.420 --> 52:03.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:03.420 --> 52:04.420]  Sorry, Ed, go ahead.
[52:05.420 --> 52:09.420]  I was going to say, that's a good question.
[52:09.420 --> 52:13.420]  We are, of course, need more people.
[52:13.420 --> 52:25.420]  But, with like what I'm doing, legal work, you need people who are trained to do legal work.
[52:26.420 --> 52:40.420]  Because, if I'm in court saying, these people made all these mistakes and did all this wrong stuff, and they can turn around and say, yeah, well, look at your stuff.
[52:40.420 --> 52:44.420]  I'm blown out of the water.
[52:44.420 --> 52:56.420]  I think Nicole needs also a good deal of help, but from people who have certain skills, not just...
[52:56.420 --> 52:59.420]  Yeah, it's data crunching.
[52:59.420 --> 53:03.420]  Yeah, I need 15 of me. Really, I always say that.
[53:04.420 --> 53:16.420]  If anyone wants to contact me, they can reach out to Nikki, N-I-K-K-I, Jean, J-E-A-N, Norris, N-O-R-R-I-S, at Gmail, Nikki, Jean, Norris, at Gmail.
[53:16.420 --> 53:21.420]  I would love to talk with them, especially if they have any sort of paralegal skills, or data crunching.
[53:21.420 --> 53:23.420]  I just posted it in the chat.
[53:23.420 --> 53:28.070]  Thank you.
[53:28.070 --> 53:31.070]  Yeah, activism in cannabis is really strange right now.
[53:31.070 --> 53:42.070]  That's why I say I need 15 of me, because so many people are tied up in either the permit process, or they're afraid of the abatement process, or they're doing the safe homes.
[53:42.070 --> 53:44.070]  And we're, again, so rural.
[53:44.070 --> 53:51.070]  There's a lot of elders in this community, too, that are just getting old and don't want to stand up.
[53:51.070 --> 53:54.070]  They can't stand up and fight anymore, really, is what it is.
[53:55.070 --> 54:01.070]  I don't know if the county intentionally did that, but they've definitely taken advantage of our lack of organization so much.
[54:01.070 --> 54:09.070]  But there's a bunch of people like me, too, a couple handfuls of folks that are really dedicated, and we're fighting the good fight.
[54:09.070 --> 54:12.070]  But yeah, if you've got any skills, hit me up, please.
[54:13.070 --> 54:21.070]  Can you talk about, you know, you posted the multi-part article series in Redheaded Black Belt.
[54:21.070 --> 54:26.070]  That's read by a lot of local cannabis farmers.
[54:26.070 --> 54:30.070]  So what were the reactions in the comments section?
[54:30.070 --> 54:35.070]  Well, it's really surprising.
[54:35.070 --> 54:38.070]  I just had my baby, so I've been a little bit out of the loop.
[54:39.070 --> 54:40.070]  I was writing before Redheaded Black Belt.
[54:40.070 --> 54:48.070]  I was writing for a local newspaper called The Green Fuse run by Paul Insomer and Joshua Golden, a radical little green newspaper.
[54:48.070 --> 54:53.070]  And I was reporting on this, but I was one of the only people in the whole county covering this.
[54:53.070 --> 55:03.070]  It's not a popular issue because the way that legalization is kind of unfolded, according to UC Berkeley, they're regulating it as if it's a problem.
[55:04.070 --> 55:15.070]  Whether that be environmental or culturally, like with certain populations across California, like the Hmong population, you know, they'll use legalization to kind of eradicate the whole culture.
[55:15.070 --> 55:22.070]  And they're doing that here in Cumbell County, too, with the hippies or conscious humans or whatever you want to call them.
[55:22.070 --> 55:24.070]  Let me break in here.
[55:24.070 --> 55:25.070]  Please.
[55:25.070 --> 55:30.070]  Nicole is way too modest about the response to this article.
[55:30.070 --> 55:31.070]  Oh.
[55:32.070 --> 55:38.070]  If you look at the comments to her articles, they're almost entirely favorable.
[55:38.070 --> 55:42.070]  And there are quite a few of them.
[55:42.070 --> 55:48.070]  She is the only writer to do anything of substance.
[55:49.070 --> 55:56.070]  You know, I mean, anyone can write a comment and say, I don't like this program, we should get rid of it still.
[55:56.070 --> 56:04.070]  But Nicole has written factual articles that demonstrate what the problems are.
[56:04.070 --> 56:10.070]  And that's what it's a way to let people appreciate it.
[56:10.070 --> 56:11.070]  Thank you, Ed.
[56:12.070 --> 56:13.070]  It's just really important to get the information out there.
[56:13.070 --> 56:18.070]  I was truly inspired by Ed's comments on the CSAC award initially.
[56:18.070 --> 56:24.070]  I'm like, I've got to refute this because John Ford is just completely lying about someone I admire immensely.
[56:24.070 --> 56:26.070]  Ed was like, don't worry about it.
[56:26.070 --> 56:27.070]  I'm not worried about it.
[56:28.070 --> 56:42.070]  But when John Ford said that Ed's comments about the abatement program was inaccurate, and I knew full well that everything Ed said was right on, and everything I had seen in person with this agency, I had to stand up.
[56:42.070 --> 56:45.070]  And it was impossible to get John Ford to call me back.
[56:45.070 --> 56:48.070]  So I just submitted record requests after record requests.
[56:48.070 --> 56:52.070]  And I'm not a mathematician, but I crunched the data.
[56:52.070 --> 56:55.070]  I cross-referenced it with UC Berkeley.
[56:55.070 --> 56:57.070]  And I had them run the numbers.
[56:57.070 --> 57:00.070]  But I could always use more data crunching assistance.
[57:00.070 --> 57:02.070]  There's so much to crunch.
[57:02.070 --> 57:04.070]  I just got this massive list from the state.
[57:04.070 --> 57:07.070]  So I'll have some more information for you guys soon.
[57:08.070 --> 57:23.070]  And Robert, can you talk about, you know, we just touched a little bit on kind of like, you know, you have the older farmers who are kind of, you know, hanging up their hats right now.
[57:24.070 --> 57:39.070]  But can you talk about kind of the landscape of the, you know, small farmers and farming community from like 2016, you know, to present time and kind of, it's almost like complete decimation.
[57:39.070 --> 57:44.070]  So feel free to paint a picture of decimation and sadness.
[57:44.070 --> 57:51.070]  Yeah, like I said earlier, I always like to use my personal mountain here at home as kind of my pulse of the community.
[57:52.070 --> 58:01.070]  And so in the old days, driving up and down my mountain, we all used to wave to each other because we all knew we were participating in the same illicit activity.
[58:01.070 --> 58:04.070]  And if we were pulling it off, we were proud of each other.
[58:04.070 --> 58:13.070]  And even though there was some people that maybe we frowned upon because we felt like they were bringing heat to the community, we still respected those people because they were still part of our community.
[58:13.070 --> 58:14.070]  Does that make sense?
[58:15.070 --> 58:28.070]  As opposed to now, there's this big division in our community where you have the licensed operators, and then you have the illicit operators, and we're not all waving at each other like we used to.
[58:28.070 --> 58:35.070]  And we don't have a cohesive community like we used to. There's a lot of division, you know.
[58:35.070 --> 58:38.070]  It definitely didn't bring people together is what I'm seeing.
[58:38.070 --> 58:42.070]  And then as you guys were talking, something that I feel is an important point.
[58:42.070 --> 58:48.070]  When the county set out to do this in 2017, they wanted to decimate the traditional market.
[58:48.070 --> 58:56.070]  And in doing so for three years, the only thing they've done is raise the prices of traditional market cannabis.
[58:56.070 --> 59:01.070]  And so I don't know if that was an unintended consequence or if that was something that they planned to happen.
[59:02.070 --> 59:06.070]  But I hear there's an uptick as far as the price of cannabis.
[59:06.070 --> 59:12.070]  I don't think it's just related to the COVID situation and the fires.
[59:12.070 --> 59:17.070]  It has to do with the amount of eradication that's been happening over the past three years.
[59:17.070 --> 59:22.070]  We're the epicenter for production for the entire nation, not for the state of California.
[59:22.070 --> 59:24.070]  We're the epicenter for the whole nation.
[59:25.070 --> 59:33.070]  So, you know, the county, they went about this one way when in my mind, I can think of 10 other ways that they could have approached this.
[59:33.070 --> 59:43.070]  That probably would have had a more favorable outcome for the entire community rather than six, seven, eight families in every mountain community that exists in Humboldt.
[59:44.070 --> 59:58.070]  Right. Yeah. The price per pound in fall of 2017, according to a study done by UC Berkeley, was 500 to 1100 on average.
[59:58.070 --> 01:00:02.070]  So it was quite low back then when legalization hit.
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:07.070]  And then this year, it's just astronomical and it's really chasing people indoors.
[01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.070]  I'd say this year, my guess, what did I hear last?
[01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:18.070]  23 for indoor and indoors really popular now because people have to make a living and they can't grow outdoor now.
[01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:25.070]  It's horrible. What legalization has done for the environment is ironic because people aren't stopping growing.
[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:32.070]  It's very true, Nicole. If people have high time centerfold indoor weed, it's going for three thousand dollars a pound right now.
[01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.070]  Those are numbers that we haven't seen since the early 2000s.
[01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:41.070]  You know, and that was that was due to the eradication efforts that were occurring here.
[01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.070]  And like Nicole just mentioned, it is pushing people indoors.
[01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:53.070]  And if you look at the stats from this year, some of the operations that law enforcement did get, they were indoor operations and guys are running generators again.
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:58.070]  And it just it doesn't make any sense. You know, like the price of fuel isn't cheap like it used to be.
[01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.070]  And no one wants to be polluting their communities.
[01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:06.070]  But people feel like they have no other choice. And not to say that I'm I'm pro that or anti that.
[01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:12.070]  I can just understand when people feel like they're pushed into a corner and they have no other option.
[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:22.070]  Absolutely. You really can't blame them. And also another aspect of this is the mega grows that didn't get permitted, which is, in my opinion, I seen so few of those.
[01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:26.070]  I don't think there are a lot more of those left that are like, you know, an acre in size.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:37.070]  Those guys, I have heard they're going underground indoor. I've talked to a fellow. He's like, I, I heard of a farm that was like an acre long or something ridiculous like that.
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:43.070]  I mean, people can go underground now with indoors. It's just it's it's wild.
[01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.070]  But yeah, so the prices this year are wild and.
[01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:58.070]  And although, although the prices are up over the past three years like you guys said earlier, we are one of the only counties to report lost sales tax during that that period of time.
[01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:12.070]  And so even though prices are up now it shows that we're still using that sales tax revenue. And like Ed said towns like Garberville today, it should almost feel like the day of reggae on the river in Garberville.
[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:20.070]  I don't know. But if you drive to Garberville today it looks like a ghost town and it doesn't feel like the day before reggae on the river.
[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.070]  Right. I'm really worried about our, our region.
[01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:39.070]  Very few rural communities can take it the sort of hit that we've had in the last few years with millions and millions extracted 75% of which has been from our small district, where I don't know Ed are there 20,000 people that are in this area.
[01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:55.070]  36 million, oh sorry 40 something million. It's like, how, who can who can take that sort of hit, and you can definitely see it and you see it in drug overdoses you see it in suicides, you see it and substance abuse issues, aces.
[01:02:56.070 --> 01:03:09.070]  Like we already talked about nonprofits, it's widespread, and I don't, I don't know what the trade off was supposed to be but they haven't. They haven't seized the opportunity that humble county cannabis industry should have been.
[01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:23.070]  And even looking at the low numbers if there was 10,000 farms farms pre legalization and 500 permitted farms maybe in February that means only 5% assimilated I don't see that as being a success in my mind.
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:39.070]  Yeah, yeah, the like I said Santa Barbara is much higher percentage I forget I ran the numbers, Trinity and Mendocino as well have higher percentage success rate, the farms pre legalization were 10 to 30,000 to and humble county so it could be lower than that,
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:42.070]  than five for sure.
[01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.070]  Yeah.
[01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.070]  I think something we do.
[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:52.070]  What can we do what we do and you know, I think an important point also is during the onset of the pandemic.
[01:03:52.070 --> 01:04:04.070]  We were hearing through the local community that residents were fearing growing vegetables and their small greenhouses at their homesteads, because they didn't want to be drug into this drag net that the county has been doing county wide.
[01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:18.070]  And so I feel it's a real important time that people should be stuffing their greenhouses with their vegetables, growing as much as possible you know we're experiencing a pandemic when, when else would be a better time for people to be growing tons of vegetables
[01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:23.070]  in the greenhouses existing infrastructure that they already have on their land.
[01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:37.070]  Exactly. I literally came to Humboldt County to grow food and live sustainably in harmony with the planet. I didn't come here for cannabis. I just had a scholarship and I wanted to go back to school before it expired but I found my love for cannabis while I was
[01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:41.070]  But when we're.
[01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:49.070]  I'm so sorry, what, what were you talking about I lost my train of thought so yeah growing food and fruit and vegetables in a greenhouse we need to be doing this right now.
[01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:59.070]  Right, and it's it's never a better time. The moment that I need the food in the greenhouse that I've grown for the past 1012 years in Humboldt County. I'm not allowed to anymore.
[01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:16.070]  I didn't get an abatement. I didn't get a warning letter, my landlords are just scared of the abatement program, understandably, and so they don't want a greenhouse, and I get it but basically the county has taken food out of my child's mouth and a breastfeeding mother's mouth.
[01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:39.070]  So, it's gross, and I literally went in November 2019 and I begged the supervisors, I told them this story I said, I just want to grow food for my son. In the winter, I grow food year round without a greenhouse I cannot do that in Humboldt County down in Los Angeles Peter and I remember I had a rooftop garden in downtown LA and I grew a lot of stuff in the winter and fall and all year round but in
[01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:46.070]  Oh yeah, I got I got a watermelon growing right now and beans and tomatoes, I mean I got everything.
[01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:50.070]  I'm looking at it right now it's good to be in LA.
[01:05:50.070 --> 01:06:00.070]  So John Ford if you're watching right now you're you're taking food out of the mouths of a breastfeeding mother and her newborn child.
[01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:02.070]  Wow, what a terrible thing.
[01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.070]  During a pandemic.
[01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.070]  Yeah, during a pandemic.
[01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:06.070]  An economic collapse.
[01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:13.070]  Maybe john I'll click on that zoom login and defend his honor.
[01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.070]  But, all right.
[01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:24.070]  Something about john john for is an extremely decent man.
[01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:35.070]  He's got a great heart, and he will correct. A lot of these problems, one at a time.
[01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:54.070]  He doesn't seem to be able to see the systematic problem that's going on. And he cannot fix all the problems that are being caused by the policies, he helped right and that he's implementing.
[01:06:54.070 --> 01:07:03.070]  So, I feel, I really feel bad for john for because he's a good man doing bad things.
[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:13.070]  He sure is doing bad things I mean when I lost my train of thought again I'm so sorry.
[01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.070]  It's been an hour and a half.
[01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:27.070]  John Ford, and I think he means well and. But yeah, when he's taking something away he's or when he's giving something to us he's like, Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to say.
[01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:41.070]  There's this ongoing like assumption in their department and I think that it must be this opinion must be held by john Ford, that everyone in cannabis has money, and they owe it to their criminals so they owe it to the county.
[01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:53.070]  And when you walk into the planning and building department you are a criminal it feels like a lot of people have told me when they're going to get the permits or their safe home applications, they feel like they're being criminalized still just by the nature
[01:07:54.070 --> 01:08:07.070]  of the cannabis, even though it's legal. So I've had several times from the planning and building department I have a great interview and they're like, you know, I asked why, why don't you charge penalties for regular abatements that aren't involving cannabis that's interesting
[01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:12.070]  because the penalties are so extreme for cannabis, and they say, Oh well they have money.
[01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.070]  They can afford it.
[01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:27.070]  God really is that right because the elders I see going through the abatement program barely have, you know, clothes without holes in them and they just want to grow food and the nuns at the monastery you know they're.
[01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:37.070]  It's wild. It's wild, but I think so breastfeeding breastfeeding mothers and nuns john Ford.
[01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:45.070]  Yeah, I think he's imposing additional stress on a community that's still recovering from the drug war that's never ended.
[01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:57.070]  And, you know, just people around here, we're, we're, we have PTSD from years of living under the blades, and it's it's not just me it's our collective community.
[01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:11.070]  Yeah, and the least that they owe us is like a small permit a micro permit for a 2000 square foot farm that should be like no questions asked a 600 square foot greenhouse, whatever you want to grow in it food, cannabis, any medicine.
[01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:25.070]  It should be like no questions asked. Sorry about the drug war but it's not that way at all. It's more illegal now right at it, you said that before it feels more illegal now, or does feel like that more legal than when camp was around.
[01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:49.070]  So just Robert I feel like the, I don't even that last someone posted there were like 260 people watching so I feel like we've made them eat their spinach and sprouts by listening to a deep wonk ish legal conversation so I want to give them a little
[01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:57.070]  bit of background and I want you to talk about what you what you grew this season, and tell us about it.
[01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:14.070]  Sure. So most of my lineup this season is from Jesse Dodd from bio vortex. I found Jesse seeds do very well in my microclimate and Jesse does most of his breeding on the coast, where it's really foggy and moist.
[01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:24.070]  And I've been telling him that none of his strains that I've run rot out here where I live in the inland valleys where it's hot and dry during the summer.
[01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:41.070]  And I've been running his genetics for the past three years, and I've been extremely happy with everything that I've run from him. And he's been doing some back crosses that he's had for years, including his black dog.
[01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:54.070]  I've done some of his black dog crosses and yeah just everything that I'm running of his I can't even think off of the top of my head everything that I have this year of his, but it's phenomenal and the qualities, always top of the line.
[01:10:54.070 --> 01:11:08.070]  And if anyone can get their hands on his seeds I would highly recommend it Jesse's a phenomenal breeder he's a really down to earth guy. And yeah you know this season it's been tough for cultivators here in the Emerald Triangle.
[01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:21.070]  We've been dealing with smoke since, shoot I'd say August, the end of August where I live, and it's been on and off but it's been more on than it's been off.
[01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:38.070]  And there's been ash on the plants, and yeah we just persevere that's kind of, that's the thing about this community is you can like knock us down in the ground, everyone could be get knocked down but we still kind of rise up again, and it's just there's a lot
[01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:42.070]  of perseverance that goes on in this region of California.
[01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:48.070]  You have deep roots cultivating on that specific hill right?
[01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:56.070]  Yeah so I've lived in Humboldt since 1997 I bought my land in 2000 I built my house in 2002.
[01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:08.070]  So can you kind of talk about the evolution of kind of the genetics and cultivars that have kind of crossed your path over, like have you seen trends I mean you're currently running Jesse's stuff but
[01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:15.070]  So you know I've always made my own seeds over the years it's one of the things that I really enjoy about growing cannabis.
[01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:31.070]  It's kind of like you know making the next generation that you get to see your offspring the following year. And, you know, the way the markets been working is some people are kind of chasing more trendy trend, you know trendy strains and trends and this and that.
[01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:43.070]  And I've always worked with the heirloom strains I found that the strains that are from my hill or from my microclimate are always programmed to do the best here.
[01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:59.070]  It's like they just naturally do better in our bio region, and so you know when I first got my land. We were given seeds from old timers who lived up here on the mountain they had been here from the 70s and they were some of the original growers, and they
[01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:14.070]  And the black was a black Afghani cross with an Alaskan black and I'm not talking about purple weed I'm talking about weed that's black like like a black wood stove that's painted with cast iron black paint.
[01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:20.070]  And the weed was so black that the crystals just looked like they were exploding off of the weed.
[01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:30.070]  And so we've used the black as a staple in a lot of the crosses that we've made over the years, I can remember when train wreck was popular we crossed it with the black.
[01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:33.070]  I remember when banana was popular we crossed it with the black.
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:41.070]  Anything that I could get in clone form because I live off the grid and I don't have power to run lights thousand watt lights.
[01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:47.070]  And I don't have the energy to keep moms during the winter, and so anything that I could get in clone form from people over the years.
[01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:56.070]  Since I started growing here in the late 90s I've crossed with the black and the black is just really sturdy it's just a it's a great strain.
[01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:09.070]  To use as kind of a breeding block for for my mountain and so yeah we you know we've done it all you know I like I said I've been here since 97 and you know we went through the og and sour diesel craze and.
[01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:18.070]  I never really hopped on that bandwagon and I was growing seed weed, I was growing weed from seed not seeded weed, but I was growing weed grown from seed.
[01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:27.070]  And it always wasn't the most desirable as far as what people wanted at the time, but when the buyers would open up the bag, they knew it was the best.
[01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:36.070]  And it didn't have to be og or sour diesel, it could be one of these these off brand strains that we created, and you know, even if we gave it some interesting name.
[01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:49.070]  yeah it's just the weeds, you know the weed grows really well in our region, like you guys know and yeah we're just you know we've still we're doing it and we're still doing it and yeah I don't see anything really changing a lot of the people that I know didn't.
[01:14:50.070 --> 01:15:00.070]  assimilate into the regulated market they're still here they didn't sell their land they didn't bow out to Tahiti with their pelican containers full of cash like the planning department thinks they have.
[01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:15.070]  And you know a lot of these people are just you know, making enough money to feed their families and to get by and to put food on the table and buy sneakers and all the stuff that kids require these days and that's the reality of Humboldt these days is the times of when.
[01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:27.070]  guys were here making millions of dollars and you could come here in one year and make a million bucks that's gone we've all been reduced to smaller amounts and if you're even growing these days you're like a superstar.
[01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:31.070]  yeah speaking of which do you guys want to see my plants.
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.070]  I would love to.
[01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:37.070]  Five little plants I guess you have to enable the screen sharing.
[01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:41.070]  yeah yeah hold on.
[01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:48.070]  I really resonate with what you just said, though i'm like oh that reminds me, I should show you my seed plants.
[01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:51.070]  Okay, do you see that you can now share your screen.
[01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:57.070]  And while you're looking for Robert can you talk about the scene on your on your hill like our people.
[01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:04.070]  Like do you does everybody know each other is a communal are you guys like swapping seeds and clones and.
[01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:07.070]  Okay, so what am I doing their own business.
[01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:12.070]  yeah it's a great question and so when I when I bought my land in 2000.
[01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:15.070]  And just quickly, those are your five plants they're huge.
[01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.070]  Yeah I had one male so I ended up only with five.
[01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:22.070]  Wow they look awesome incredible monsters.
[01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:26.070]  The three in the back there's three in the back and there's actually only like one that's.
[01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:29.070]  you're you're either three feet taller they're enormous.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.070]  Yes, right.
[01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:33.070]  And I don't think you're three feet tall.
[01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:44.070]  I actually buy my seeds from an old timer who hasn't come into compliance, I like to support small mom and pop businesses this strain is, I think, you can see it's a little bit of a.
[01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:52.070]  I think she calls it something like river og but it's a really rare strain and it's prolific.
[01:16:53.070 --> 01:17:01.070]  yeah these are just amazing and I love composting I do all my own like composting and i'm really into it soil building living.
[01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:05.070]  And, and are you imminently about to chop or have you already chopped.
[01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.070]  No, these are like four weeks away, I would say.
[01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:10.070]  Oh wow okay.
[01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.070]  phenomenal.
[01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:17.070]  bless your heart, thanks I wish I had more space and you know the legal right to grow more.
[01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:25.070]  So big middle finger to the government when they say you can only grow six plants and you're like I can grow some oak tree size plan right.
[01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.070]  Right, I think there's.
[01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:36.070]  So Peter back to your question about in the early 2000s when I bought my land in 2000 our Community here on the mountain was a lot more cohesive.
[01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:46.070]  And we used to have barbecues and we would have Super Bowl parties and the neighbors got together a lot more and we would share seeds and we would share genetics.
[01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:55.070]  And then what happened was is the green rush started and when the green rush started people got a little bit greedier and they started putting out a little bit more.
[01:17:56.070 --> 01:18:02.070]  And they put in gates where there hadn't been gates before when they started keeping those gates locked and closed.
[01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:11.070]  And there started being less parties, because everyone was working so hard and there started being less Super Bowl parties and barbecues and just get togethers.
[01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:17.070]  Where we would get together and see each other's faces and the green rush went on for a while, like we know.
[01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:25.070]  And it attracted more people to everyone's properties, and so there was more traffic on the road, there was more supply trucks coming in.
[01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:32.070]  There was more stuff being delivered, and you know we're talking about country roads that don't have capacity for these large trucks.
[01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:43.070]  You know, to be going up and down all the time, and it seems like over time the relationships between the neighbors began to deteriorate.
[01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:50.070]  And it began to deteriorate for a number of reasons, but there just wasn't the cohesion like there was when I first got my land.
[01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:58.070]  And I've seen this in other mountains too, because I go to other mountains, I'm not just on my mountain and so I've worked in other communities.
[01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:08.070]  I have lots of friends countywide in all three of the counties, and I feel like this is a common thing that I hear from a lot of growing communities in the Emerald Triangle.
[01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:18.070]  That kind of the neighborhood cohesion kind of deteriorated over time, and now I feel like it's trying to rebuild a little bit, but it's hard because we're all pegged against each other.
[01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:25.070]  Because there's the legal market, and then there's kind of the traditional market, and maybe not everyone sees eye to eye like they used to.
[01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:38.070]  Yeah, I was just talking to an advocate friend, a cannabis advocate, and she was explaining a scene at her family reunion where she's got across the board, you know, every type of farmer in the community.
[01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:45.070]  We've got the mega permitted growers, we've got the small abated farmers, you've got just people at odds.
[01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:51.070]  They were just standing, she said, around with their arms folded and glaring at each other. Isn't that so sad?
[01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:52.070]  It's really sad.
[01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:59.070]  We talk about the cultural loss here. This place is so rare. That's the biggest issue for me, I think.
[01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:06.070]  Beyond the land rights, property rights, medical cannabis rights, growing your own food, all of those rights.
[01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:15.070]  That's the biggest issue for me, the loss of a unique altruistic culture that really doesn't exist anywhere else in America that I know of.
[01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:17.070]  I agree 100%.
[01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:31.070]  Ed, were you smoking cannabis back in the 60s with Jerry Garcia and the Dead and Yorma Kaukonen and Hot Tuna and Traffic and Jimi Hendrix and...
[01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:41.070]  Well, Peter, I have to tell you this, only my close friends know, so I count you among my close friends.
[01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.070]  You're live on YouTube.
[01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:46.070]  I don't smoke pot.
[01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:54.070]  I have never smoked pot, except when I went to see Coriana Scotzi.
[01:20:54.070 --> 01:21:03.070]  A couple of friends dragged me into a doorway, got me stoned, and pushed me into the theater.
[01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:16.070]  During my college days in Berkeley in the 60s, I was much more into peyote and LSD, those things.
[01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:27.070]  But I suppose the reason I get involved in all this is not because I love pot.
[01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:30.070]  I'm sort of a libertarian.
[01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:38.070]  I don't think it's up to me or society to say, no, you can't have this medicine.
[01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:44.070]  No, you can't grow on your own land like that.
[01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:51.070]  I was an activist up here for 10 or 15 years before I became a lawyer.
[01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:55.070]  That's why I find it ironic that you have...
[01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:59.070]  It's like Democrat, Republican, Libertarian.
[01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:05.070]  You have people who don't act in kind of how they label themselves.
[01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:12.070]  A lot of these Northern counties, I'm guessing, have a lot of Libertarians, and yet they're...
[01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:14.070]  You can't grow your six plants.
[01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.070]  You can't do this.
[01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:16.070]  You can't do that.
[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:18.070]  And it's like, aren't you guys Libertarians?
[01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:21.070]  What's going on?
[01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:22.070]  Yeah.
[01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.070]  Yeah.
[01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.070]  That has been strange.
[01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:34.070]  We have one supervisor in the early years of this millennium, Roger Rodoni.
[01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:47.070]  He was a cattle rancher, Libertarian, who helped push through some really good ordinances here in the county for growers.
[01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:53.070]  But a few years back, he was killed in an automobile accident.
[01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:59.070]  And since then, the board has been less useful.
[01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:03.070]  Roger was a great supervisor.
[01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:12.070]  He was head of the Cattlemen's Association and a big proponent of legalizing cannabis.
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:22.070]  Just quickly, Nicole, people want to know, and this is specifically the big cush, when did she start the plants from seed?
[01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:24.070]  Must be early March or February.
[01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:27.070]  So when did you start those?
[01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:29.070]  You're muted.
[01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.070]  You're muted.
[01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:31.070]  Sorry about that.
[01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:32.070]  This year, actually, I bought...
[01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:33.070]  Forgive me.
[01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:38.070]  I usually buy seeds from her, but because I didn't have a greenhouse, I actually bought seed starts from her.
[01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:41.070]  And I believe she starts in February.
[01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:43.070]  We're all on the biodynamic calendar.
[01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:47.070]  So whenever the full moon was or the full moon, yeah.
[01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:48.070]  Yeah.
[01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:49.070]  So talk about...
[01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:52.070]  So those are just straight into the ground.
[01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:54.070]  Well, she started them.
[01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:58.070]  No, these seeds are not straight into the ground, I wish I could do that.
[01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:00.070]  So they're in pots?
[01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:01.070]  They were in pots.
[01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.070]  Oh, yeah, they're in the ground now.
[01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.070]  Right now.
[01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:05.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:06.070]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:10.070]  So they're in the ground, like 13 feet tall.
[01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:14.070]  And are you just watering them?
[01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:15.070]  Are you putting water?
[01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:18.070]  Are you any amendments?
[01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:20.070]  It's completely organic.
[01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:24.070]  I go to this beautiful garden store called the Beneficial Living Center.
[01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:28.070]  And they use all locally sourced products.
[01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:33.070]  My friend owns the company, and he makes all of the products with local companies.
[01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:36.070]  You can bring your plastic containers in even and refill them.
[01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:40.070]  So all the fish is coming from the fish guy, and they're making fish hydrolysate.
[01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:43.070]  And then I make my own compost teas on site.
[01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:50.070]  I've got a great recipe from them, worm castings, compost, bokashi.
[01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:52.070]  I'm really into bokashi these days.
[01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:55.070]  I just think that's like the ticket to growing the best tea.
[01:24:55.070 --> 01:25:00.070]  We're going to be talking bokashi tomorrow with Brandon from Bokashi Earthworks.
[01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:01.070]  Oh, beautiful.
[01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:02.070]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:05.070]  So I use a lot of bokashi.
[01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:06.070]  What else?
[01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:12.070]  Frass, insect castings, or whatever they're called, nematodes.
[01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:14.070]  I'm all about beneficial.
[01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:16.070]  As you can see, I'm growing food.
[01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:19.070]  Well, the food's behind the cannabis mostly.
[01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:27.070]  But I have to have everything organic, of course, out of principle and because I eat out of pure, too.
[01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:32.070]  And if you were to guesstimate how many pounds you'll get per plant?
[01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:33.070]  Don't do it.
[01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:34.070]  I undercut it.
[01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:39.070]  I don't think there's that much there, really.
[01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:46.070]  I would say maybe a pound each or something like that.
[01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:47.070]  Yeah.
[01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:56.070]  Not enough for someone who has arthritis or sleeping issues or a broken spine at one point, broken feet.
[01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:57.070]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:00.070]  I use cannabis medicinally for pain.
[01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:04.070]  It won't be enough to cover my need this year, I don't think.
[01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.070]  And there's other people living there, too.
[01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:10.070]  They also have pain.
[01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:16.070]  And do you have any issues?
[01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:21.070]  To me, if I were a breastfeeding mother, I would have no problem.
[01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:29.070]  If you're in pain and choice A is to take a Tylenol and choice B is to take a hit, I'd personally rather take the hit and breastfeed my baby.
[01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:30.070]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:32.070]  Actually, there's been one study.
[01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:37.070]  Because of the illegality of it, people don't get to study this.
[01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:42.070]  But in O'Shaughnessy's, are you guys familiar with that cannabis publication?
[01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:43.070]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.070]  Okay.
[01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:45.070]  They did a great spread.
[01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:52.070]  In fact, my midwife, she is friends with the nurse and anthropologist who did the only study on this issue.
[01:26:53.070 --> 01:27:05.070]  She writes in O'Shaughnessy the whole research and everything that she discovered, which was breastfeeding mothers and their children are actually better off in a lot of ways.
[01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:07.070]  There's no adverse impacts.
[01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:10.070]  And the people that were funding it were working with Congress.
[01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:13.070]  And that's not what Congress wanted them to find.
[01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:15.070]  So they cut down the funding.
[01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:17.070]  And they couldn't finish the study.
[01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:19.070]  So that's kind of how that works.
[01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:24.070]  Prior to legalization in 2017, there had been studies done in Jamaica.
[01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.070]  Exactly.
[01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.070]  Yeah.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:27.070]  Yeah.
[01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:29.070]  And so it has been studied.
[01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:32.070]  And like she said, there really isn't any known adverse effects.
[01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.070]  I actually have two boys.
[01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:35.070]  One's nine.
[01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:36.070]  I have three boys.
[01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:41.070]  But of my older boys, my nine-year-old and my 11-year-old, they were both breastfed babies.
[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:45.070]  And the mom did use cannabis during the time.
[01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.070]  Not excessively, just medicinally.
[01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:53.070]  And both of my boys are perfect specimens, textbook children.
[01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:54.070]  Yeah.
[01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.070]  Are you biased?
[01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.070]  Yeah, I would say so.
[01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:01.070]  Yeah.
[01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:14.070]  So just quickly, Nicole, sustainable reapings, Ed, or is she bokashi composting and adding top dressing with it or adding the bokashi into the soil?
[01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:16.070]  All of the above.
[01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:20.070]  I do bokashi in my compost tea, in my compost tea bag.
[01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:27.070]  I put about three cups, if I've got enough of it, in a, what are they, three-gallon bags or something like that.
[01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:29.070]  I'll put like three cups in there.
[01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:32.070]  If you want my quick recipe for compost tea, it's pretty simple.
[01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:33.070]  Let's do it.
[01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:37.070]  You just do half worm castings to double compost, basically.
[01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:42.070]  Around four cups worm casting to ten cups of compost.
[01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:43.070]  Mix it up.
[01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.070]  The more biodiversity you've got, the better.
[01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:51.070]  Like use the biodynamic compost and then use compost from your backyard.
[01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:56.070]  And then, especially your backyard, in fact, the better, the more localized you can get, the better off it'll be.
[01:28:56.070 --> 01:29:01.070]  And then I put in, like I said, frass, which is just insects.
[01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:03.070]  What else?
[01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:09.070]  And is the frass something you're doing on your property or are you just buying it from that store you mentioned?
[01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:13.070]  I'm buying it from the Beneficial Living Center, which they locally source it all.
[01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.070]  It's their product.
[01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:21.070]  Because I have tons of black soldier flies and worms.
[01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:23.070]  You should call Seth.
[01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.070]  They're munching away.
[01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:27.070]  I have the leachate.
[01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:29.070]  I have the castings.
[01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:31.070]  Yeah.
[01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:33.070]  Oh, biochar.
[01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:35.070]  You cannot forget biochar.
[01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.070]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.070]  How could I forget that?
[01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:38.070]  Put a cup of biochar in there.
[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:40.070]  It's amazing.
[01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:43.070]  I know I'm forgetting stuff.
[01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:45.070]  Aminos.
[01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:49.070]  I've got, like, these finite minerals.
[01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:54.070]  And I think that might be it.
[01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.070]  Nematodes, like I mentioned.
[01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:58.070]  Bacillus.
[01:29:58.070 --> 01:30:00.070]  There's a lot of inoculants that you can do.
[01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:05.070]  But definitely check out the Beneficial Living Center and talk to Seth if you've got questions.
[01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:07.070]  He's so helpful.
[01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:10.070]  And he's got a great store in Arcata, California.
[01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:11.070]  That is a great store.
[01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.070]  Yeah.
[01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:22.070]  And he can actually punch in your soil sample and then tell you how many cups of everything to put in your garden, your actual soil, doing the top dressing, et cetera.
[01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:24.070]  So kind of what your deficiencies are.
[01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:25.070]  Exactly.
[01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:28.070]  He'll customize the prescription.
[01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:29.070]  Yeah.
[01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:30.070]  It's pretty cool.
[01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.070]  It's pretty cool.
[01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:35.070]  And Robert, what do you ...?
[01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:38.070]  So I run Compost Teas as well.
[01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:40.070]  I run a strictly organic program.
[01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:43.070]  I have, you know, the whole time I've been growing cannabis.
[01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:50.070]  I was trained in 1996 at Kohalo Organics, which was an organic salad green farm in Hawi, Hawaii.
[01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:55.070]  I studied with the master grower there.
[01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:58.070]  And he trained us in organic agriculture.
[01:30:58.070 --> 01:31:00.070]  His name was Dan Trumpy.
[01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:08.070]  And so I've carried that into my cannabis growing pretty much my whole career.
[01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.070]  I, too, like to use compost tea.
[01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:15.070]  I have a real simple recipe as well, kind of like Nicole was just describing.
[01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.070]  And, yeah, I use all organic amendments.
[01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:34.070]  I found that my soil that I trucked in over 20 years ago from McClellan Mountain Ranch, which was a place we used to locally source soil out Highway 36, that the soil has gotten better over the years.
[01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:39.070]  And I don't even have to put very much amendments back into it these days.
[01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:48.070]  And the soil biology has kind of just gotten to this real equilibrium where I don't find myself needing to add as much as I used to.
[01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:50.070]  And the plants do phenomenal.
[01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:55.070]  And, yeah, a real similar program to what she was just describing.
[01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:57.070]  And companion planting.
[01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:59.070]  Yeah, everyone's got to do companion planting.
[01:31:59.070 --> 01:32:00.070]  It's just the best.
[01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.070]  Nasturtiums, parsley, basil.
[01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:06.070]  What are the other companion plants?
[01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:07.070]  Marigolds.
[01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:08.070]  Marigolds, of course.
[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:09.070]  Calendula.
[01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.070]  The bugs will all go over there.
[01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:12.070]  Yeah.
[01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:13.070]  Totally.
[01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:14.070]  Yeah, we found mint as well.
[01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:15.070]  We'll grow mint sometimes.
[01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:16.070]  Yeah.
[01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:17.070]  I wonder if that's...
[01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:19.070]  Yeah, I had no issues this year whatsoever.
[01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:22.070]  I barely had to spray any preventative.
[01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:28.070]  Do you, with your mint, do you keep it tamed in a pot?
[01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:30.070]  Because those roots are vicious.
[01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:36.070]  It's in a big bed, and it does spread, but I found it just spreads along the edge.
[01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:39.070]  It doesn't go into the interior of my bed.
[01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:43.070]  And so what we'll do is if it starts getting out of control, we'll cut it back.
[01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:46.070]  But, yeah, it comes back every year.
[01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:49.070]  It's probably been there for, you know, almost 20 years.
[01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:54.070]  And so, yeah, I don't contain it in a container, no.
[01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:58.070]  It's in a big soil bed that I have.
[01:32:58.070 --> 01:33:00.070]  I like when stuff like that comes up.
[01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:05.070]  You know, like cilantro sometimes will show itself, and I'll have, like, asparagus that I had years ago.
[01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:07.070]  Sometimes it'll show itself.
[01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:13.070]  And I feel like that's good, you know, to have kind of the polyculture, you know, effect going on.
[01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:14.070]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:16.070]  Plants prefer that, definitely.
[01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:19.070]  And actually, that's one problem with legalization, too.
[01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:27.070]  You go to permitted farms, and because you're paying for every square foot with taxes and everything, you're encouraged to monocrop.
[01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:29.070]  So just shove everything in one spot.
[01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:32.070]  And the farmers don't like it, the real farmers.
[01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:33.070]  They know better.
[01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:35.070]  They want to put their mint.
[01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:39.070]  They want to do all of these things, but they're going to be charged for every foot.
[01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.070]  Sure.
[01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:43.070]  Which is not a part of the culture here, either.
[01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:53.070]  I mean, when I think of Humboldt, I think of a 20-foot plant or a 10-foot plant with all the food around it and, you know, scattered about the hillside.
[01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.070]  Biodiversity.
[01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:55.070]  Yeah.
[01:33:55.070 --> 01:34:03.070]  So the commentary as we move to living soil ideas and concepts in the chat is coming alive.
[01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.070]  Sustainable.
[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:19.070]  So first of all, Greg McAllister, who's in Hawaii, since you just mentioned Hawaii, he said biochar needs to be bioactivated first and then kind of a 5% in the mix is, I guess, his target recommendation.
[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.070]  Yeah.
[01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:38.070]  And then Sustainable Reapings Ed said, if digging through my fungal compost and I find a deposit of like almond yellow rust colored stuff, isn't that humix or fulvic acid deposits?
[01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:40.070]  I would not know.
[01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:42.070]  But it sounds like it could be.
[01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:46.070]  That's what my fulvic and my finite minerals look like.
[01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:51.070]  So maybe hit up the BLC. Just give Seth a call and ask him.
[01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:56.070]  He'll let you know. Or check out a soil sample analysis, maybe.
[01:34:56.070 --> 01:35:02.070]  Jason E. also has caterpillars like Tom.
[01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:06.070]  Yeah, there are parasitic wasps.
[01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:18.070]  And then what is it the B, the B, BT or BI or, which is a spray.
[01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:30.070]  Yeah, at this point, I saw your video at this point you just want to kind of hand pluck them like you guys were doing. You don't really want to spray anything on your plants this far into flowering, right, even though, even though some people have this year, I actually
[01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:38.070]  I was talking to a doctor at the Chevron in Garberville the other day. And it seems like because of low light intensity.
[01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:49.070]  He's been out and about spraying people's plants and flowering, but that's not something I would recommend and I would just pick off the, the caterpillars as necessary as you encounter them.
[01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:52.070]  Oh, I've been bug hunting. All right.
[01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:56.070]  Robert, I want to come up and visit you sometime. This is Tom.
[01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.070]  Anytime Tom.
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:08.070]  Thank you so much. I have a question for you. You sound like a really great candidate for the new appellation program so I'm kind of curious what you feel about it.
[01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:20.070]  You know, I'm very interested in it, but because I still run a traditional scene, I think they're really shooting for the people that have kind of stepped into the light and went for the
[01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:39.070]  permit jazz. I know Jesse who I mentioned earlier, Jesse Dodd, he's working on that committee, if I remember correctly, and it sounded like they just recently got their funding to set up some weather stations on these regenerative farms that exist in our communities
[01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:59.070]  So they have real information as far as weather data to be able to compile for this, for this project for the appellation project. I think the appellation project is is a great thing. And I think it definitely could help our community. I don't know how it's all going to play out but it seems like it's a great idea from the onslaught.
[01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:07.070]  So back to you quickly because you really sound like an incredible addition to your community into the industry.
[01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:18.070]  Where do you see yourself in and you're not old, you know, you got, you know, you're, where do you see yourself in five years.
[01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:38.070]  Yeah, you know what, I was born in 78 I'm only 42 years old I've lived here since 1997. And so I've, I've lived my whole entire adult life in Humboldt County I think I moved here when I was 18 years old in a in a Volkswagen bus in a 1978 Volkswagen bus.
[01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:56.070]  I lived at clam beach for a minute and plugged into the community by 2000 I own my land, where do I see myself in five years you know I really don't know I don't see myself wanting to assimilate into the, the licensing system as it stands right now because I've seen
[01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:07.070]  neighbors and friends that are in it and they're just so disgruntled with the way things are running that I don't need the additional stress in my life, like, like, I have enough stress.
[01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:19.070]  And so you know I look at myself and I have all these other skill sets. I've been a glassblower in my lifetime. I built my house from scratch so I'm a carpenter by trade.
[01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:35.070]  I can pretty pretty much do most of the trades because I've done building in my lifetime, I own a piece of heavy equipment. I could run heavy equipment if I have to but but what's happening here in Humboldt is there's less and less of those jobs and so if I said
[01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:50.070]  I want to be a carpenter, I'm not going to grow weed for profit anymore. I'm just going to get out of this and I'm gonna, I'm just going to do carpentry, like there's not enough work around here because the growers that supported that industry, which paid the
[01:38:50.070 --> 01:39:07.070]  money to do it, it just doesn't exist like it did prior to legalization. And so, you know, I've been saving pretty much my whole adult life, and I still don't feel like I'm in that comfortable of a position because I've been raising kids the whole time.
[01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:26.070]  I've been paying property taxes. I've been paying federal income tax, just like everyone. And yeah, it's just, you know, I don't really know. I don't see myself jumping over and hopping into the legal market, but I also probably don't see myself totally abandoning what I've done for for over 23 years.
[01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:45.070]  I feel like it'd be like telling a dentist, like, you can't practice dentistry anymore. Like what dentist is going to leave his dental practice, you know, like I don't know I just try to look at it from from a grander perspective, you know, it'd be like telling Ed he can't practice law anymore, you know, he probably would be disgruntled.
[01:39:45.070 --> 01:40:00.070]  And so, you know, I still want to continue growing weed. It's something that I've done, you know, pretty much my whole adult life. I really enjoy it. I use it medicinally. I have sciatica that I've suffered from for many years and
[01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:18.070]  yeah, I just feel like it'd be nice if the system was more open to accepting people who weren't the mega growers that had an easier time to assimilate because they had the Pelican containers, Pelican containers full of cash to go to the planning department and
[01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:44.070]  and grease the wheels basically and you know I didn't know the lobbyists and I don't know any lobbyists, and I'm, I'm like an old like Grateful Dead type guy like I dropped out of high school when I was 15 and went on dead tour like that you know that's the type of person I am I, I'm like a hippie glassblower pop growing type person and the legal system I don't know that it's for me to be honest with you.
[01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:56.070]  But, but I'd like to help in any way that I can because my community is important and the cannabis culture is very important and like Nicole was saying a lot of this stuff is just going to get swept under the rug.
[01:40:56.070 --> 01:41:12.070]  And we're not even going to remember any of the people that kind of laid the foundation for for us to be here today you know people died in Humboldt County and got shot over deals gone bad and you know people lost their land and you know people went to jail for long
[01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:26.070]  periods of time you know I had to go into jail but I didn't have to serve a prison sentence for weed, like that would have driven me bonkers I was listening to the other day, Peter had a guest on it's a gentleman in Oklahoma, and he was talking about.
[01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:46.070]  And he was talking about serving a sentence for cannabis and being in jail and how bad jail really is and how you have to stick to your race in jail because if you don't you can like die and just stuff that like me is kind of like a hippie idealist type person I've never had to deal with any of that stuff except for when I got.
[01:41:46.070 --> 01:42:00.070]  Right, you know I've been popped and I've gotten in trouble I've lived here for over 20 years, I don't have a totally clean slate, but uh but I've never had to go to prison, and so you know I just look at a lot of the people that have suffered and paid their dues for our community.
[01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:13.070]  And a lot of the people that are out there representing the cannabis community they're not always the people that have paid their dues, and there's guys that showed up here three or four years ago and they just kind of hopped into legal cannabis and they might have a humble
[01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:26.070]  claim, but it doesn't mean that they've been here for 20 years or 3040 years like some of the other people that we know, and it's all about building community and a lot of those people haven't been building community what they're doing is they're
[01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:32.070]  because they want to have market share, and they want to have shelf space as opposed to.
[01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:47.070]  We were here donating to the community before those people ever existed in the community and I'm even a new transplant to Humboldt I've only lived here since 1997 I've only lived here for 23 years, but I put in 23 hard years here.
[01:42:48.070 --> 01:43:00.070]  And I've done my time and I paid my dues and I paid my my social dues to society when I had to do community service and all the stuff that that growers get wrapped up into.
[01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:15.070]  But yeah you know I really don't know you know in five years from now it'd be interesting to see you know where I'm at. I've had my successes, but I've also had my losses and so you know if you count all my successes to my losses.
[01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:25.070]  I don't know it just it might not all equal out but uh yeah you know we'll just keep plugging along my kids are enrolled in school, where we live, even though they're not back in school.
[01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:31.070]  This year and yeah we're just you know we're embedded in this community, you know I built my home here.
[01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:40.070]  When I was like 22 years old I don't see myself like selling my house to anyone anytime soon it's like the house that I've lived in my whole adult life.
[01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:45.070]  I just added on recently for my kids and yeah we love it here, this is where we live.
[01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:52.070]  So speaking of oh geez can you tell everybody whoops about.
[01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:57.070]  Of course, that woman.
[01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:08.070]  Yeah, so this is a gal down in southern Humboldt and we call her goat male because she has a herd of goats and she's a buddy.
[01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:11.070]  I just realized that there we go.
[01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:13.070]  There we go.
[01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:20.070]  That's her there too. That's her picture as well. So yeah, she's a farmer down in the southern Humboldt area she's in the eastern part of the county.
[01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:33.070]  I believe she's in blocksburg and that's my buddy's stepmom and she's a real OG and my buddy's dad was a real OG and they were growing out on the the ranch lands in the old days.
[01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:41.070]  And you know my buddy said that when his parents showed up at the school to pick him up he knew it was a day he had to work.
[01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:46.070]  And that if the bus was there to pick him up he knew that he didn't have to work that day.
[01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:53.070]  And so yeah you know you're talking about people who have been here for 40 years who raised their kids in this community of I've only been here since 97.
[01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:59.070]  And so you know you're showing picture of a lady who you know is has way deeper roots than I have.
[01:44:59.070 --> 01:45:08.070]  And yeah you know she was producing worm castings kind of as a micro business when people didn't even know what worm castings were.
[01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:18.070]  And yeah you're showing pictures of real OG people and she's not the only one and you know those people they're getting older like Ed and they're not going to be here forever.
[01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:27.070]  And so I like to talk to those people and hear their stories and hear about the real adversities people experienced here prior to legalization.
[01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:32.070]  You know prior to legalization imagine all the adversities people were experiencing.
[01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:42.070]  Right and we're trying to coax her. The reason I brought her up is because we're trying to coax her gently to tell her story.
[01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:43.070]  Yes.
[01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:57.070]  But I can appreciate how shy someone would be who's been living you know her entire adult life with helicopters flying overhead and just wanting to stay in the background.
[01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:06.070]  Yeah being a weed grower prior to legalization didn't make us the most like sociable people that existed in America.
[01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:19.070]  Yeah you know like yeah you know how it is Peter you know I'm pretty much preaching to the choir but but you know you know we we lived social isolation before they recommended that we needed to do it for coronavirus.
[01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:30.070]  Right. That's what I always joke like all the like humble farmer like whatever any anybody who's in a remote region is like okay it's just life as usual.
[01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:32.070]  Pretty much.
[01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:48.070]  So so you know I feel like we touched base on a lot of awesome subjects today. I am proud that I could you know coax Ed and Nicole into coming on to the program and I really appreciate you giving me the platform to moderate the program Peter.
[01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:51.070]  But I'm going to dog off pretty soon.
[01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:57.070]  Yeah no we yeah no we so we can wrap it up there about 300 people watching right now and we appreciate it.
[01:46:58.070 --> 01:47:11.070]  Because we all got other shit to do but we're working on Peter McGuire Mike Ritter who is the Humboldt University professor Fred.
[01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:21.070]  Chris man to talk about Thai stick and running drugs in the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:34.070]  And so we'll we'll schedule that one, hopefully for the next week or two and then tomorrow we have living soil with Brandon rust and Brian and Layton Morrison.
[01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:51.070]  Oh, so one big thing I mean we've been talking, you know, people getting thrown in jail and I mentioned this the other day but Christian Carter, who I brought on to talk about what's going on in El Dorado County is in jail right now so
[01:47:52.070 --> 01:48:10.070]  I'm working with his mom and his girlfriend to base I think we'll we'll put together a fundraiser to raise money for his legal fees, because he is currently in jail in El Dorado and I reached out to.
[01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:19.070]  And I'm blanking on his name but the guy who runs like the El Dorado County growers Association so there's anyone watching from El Dorado County.
[01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:26.070]  I could use your help because I'm just one dude down in LA trying to help someone out up in El Dorado.
[01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:39.070]  So, similarly to how Nicole could use some help with with what she's trying to do on behalf of not even yourself right like you're doing this stuff on behalf of the community.
[01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:44.070]  You're doing this stuff on behalf of other people and it's like I could use a little help.
[01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:59.070]  Yeah, yeah, definitely not. I have no horse in the race as they say I don't own property. I just had a greenhouse full of vegetables and I am a medical cannabis user and yeah I used to have a medical garden but I don't anymore.
[01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:08.070]  Other than that I have no affiliation and working of course in the law office and for permitted farms that never paid me but yeah.
[01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:20.070]  Not doing this for myself I'm definitely doing this for my son and hoping that he has a community to grow up in here that is safe and yeah there's hope.
[01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:23.070]  All right, I think.
[01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:43.070]  I was gonna say, with regards to Christian being in jail and it's 2020 to think that anyone's in jail on fresh charges from 2020 for cultivating cannabis, it's somewhat infuriating and whatever help that you know we could, you know, do to help Christian
[01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:53.070]  out I totally would be down because I just find it so infuriating that anyone's in jail and it's 2020 and weed's legal in California.
[01:49:54.070 --> 01:50:19.070]  Right, so yeah I'll keep everyone posted on that but I think probably within I mean definitely within the next week I was, you know, with Mia we touched on the last prisoner project and Steve D'Angelo who is I certainly the most high profile board member I don't know if he's one of the co founders but I'm going to try to bring him on and.
[01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:32.070]  And maybe a lawyer and Christian's mom and girlfriend to just kind of talk people in prison with a specific emphasis on raising money for Christian so.
[01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:43.070]  Anyway, with that we will wrap it up, thank you everybody and I'm going to get to my I'm still harvesting all my tobacco seeds.
[01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:45.070]  Thank you guys.
[01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:47.070]  Thank you.
[01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:50.070]  And, and by the way, Tom.
[01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:59.070]  Tyler who is treetop farms is going to come help build a
[01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:02.070]  some moth netting.
