[00:00.190 --> 00:04.350]  and we're live! Welcome to another episode of
[00:06.010 --> 00:13.530]  Planting Seeds with Mr. Tree and we're actually at a season finale I believe here. We've all grown these plants out
[00:13.530 --> 00:19.410]  We've all consumed these plants that we've all enjoyed them. I've got some hashbrows and I got my flower power cam set up
[00:19.550 --> 00:24.430]  Ready to go and there was some fire in those packs man. I got some crosses
[00:24.430 --> 00:29.730]  I've done a mass breeding thing and there's some badass stuff that has been thrown in there together
[00:30.190 --> 00:33.430]  But I mean nobody's here to see me. Nobody's here to listen to me
[00:33.430 --> 00:38.970]  There's four other fantastic fucking human beings in the audience here in the in the group here that that
[00:39.230 --> 00:42.370]  Everybody's here to chat with and of course, we'll leave we'll leave mr.
[00:42.370 --> 00:47.430]  Trees to the end because he he's always got too much to say every single time. How you doing crow still grown?
[00:47.430 --> 00:53.790]  Oh gee, and how was the Kenharm roof red? What did you grow? Tell me all about it
[00:53.910 --> 00:59.110]  I'm gonna have a fucking fat dab. So we ended up with out of nine
[01:00.230 --> 01:02.230]  two really good females
[01:02.830 --> 01:04.430]  I
[01:04.430 --> 01:11.130]  Think I got about a half pound to a pound off of each. We'll go see in a second. I'll go
[01:11.710 --> 01:17.630]  Out to the the drying room and I'll pull the plants. I haven't even touched them
[01:17.630 --> 01:21.150]  I just let them sit and dry and hang for a while. So
[01:21.830 --> 01:23.830]  we'll see that in a minute and
[01:25.230 --> 01:27.530]  Yeah, they turned out really nice
[01:27.530 --> 01:34.690]  I mean I got to harvest off of I got a harvest of seeds at the beginning and then I was able to get some
[01:34.690 --> 01:35.810]  bud
[01:35.810 --> 01:37.810]  still at the end
[01:37.890 --> 01:44.530]  Obviously, there's a reduction in yield when you've already gone and hit it with pollen
[01:45.050 --> 01:46.810]  but
[01:46.810 --> 01:48.810]  it did pretty well and
[01:49.650 --> 01:53.170]  Yeah, I got some other stuff out there. I got some original haze
[01:54.090 --> 01:56.650]  That's drying and I got some other
[01:57.290 --> 01:59.170]  OG kush
[01:59.170 --> 02:05.670]  That that I had selected and I had revenge and it just barely made buds
[02:06.170 --> 02:11.130]  But I was just happy that it did anything because I think I tried to hit it with some pollen
[02:11.130 --> 02:14.090]  So we'll see what that yields
[02:14.370 --> 02:20.130]  but yeah, we'll go out there and in a little bit and and I'll show off all that stuff and
[02:20.290 --> 02:22.290]  Yeah
[02:22.290 --> 02:29.450]  I'm just still going I still got like three different original hazes going that are like six feet seven feet tall. So
[02:30.810 --> 02:36.210]  we're gonna see what that that yields in the next few weeks and I'll be posting that on IG and
[02:37.770 --> 02:41.970]  Yeah, it's kind of a boring boring time now
[02:45.370 --> 02:47.370]  Do we start these
[02:48.370 --> 02:54.850]  You anybody remember our first episode and how many weeks ago that was because I feel like it's been a few months to say
[02:54.850 --> 02:56.850]  at least like I feel like it was
[02:58.210 --> 03:01.290]  Hmm June May June
[03:05.490 --> 03:07.490]  Is like probably May June
[03:09.970 --> 03:12.570]  Cuz that's about when I started depping him
[03:14.530 --> 03:18.330]  So that's as far as I remember was around Janus
[03:21.050 --> 03:27.890]  And then what about Corey why don't we move on you what did you get what did you grow is it harvested is it smokable
[03:27.890 --> 03:30.130]  Are you smoking it now? What's going on? Okay
[03:31.650 --> 03:35.010]  So I ended up with four females
[03:36.850 --> 03:38.250]  And
[03:38.250 --> 03:40.250]  I took him down
[03:40.450 --> 03:43.650]  The week that we had discussed I was going to take him down
[03:43.650 --> 03:48.690]  I think it was a week prior to the show. We were scheduled to do a show
[03:48.690 --> 03:53.410]  I think it was the week before the show that I unfortunately apologized again was sick and slept through
[03:53.970 --> 03:55.970]  and I
[03:56.690 --> 04:00.530]  Had a few challenges during the grow so
[04:01.890 --> 04:06.050]  it was not my finest work by any means and I
[04:06.770 --> 04:10.210]  Had a couple of different issues nothing drastic
[04:10.970 --> 04:14.010]  The flower in my opinion still came out fantastic
[04:15.610 --> 04:17.130]  It's
[04:17.130 --> 04:23.570]  Got some great fun. Are you okay with giving me some details on what went wrong? Oh, absolutely. Okay, so
[04:24.250 --> 04:25.610]  I
[04:25.610 --> 04:27.610]  Have been doing this a short time
[04:28.490 --> 04:29.890]  and
[04:29.890 --> 04:35.330]  Know enough that I'm not set up to really be growing indoors in the summertime
[04:36.010 --> 04:37.690]  and
[04:37.690 --> 04:39.690]  That ended up happening
[04:39.690 --> 04:45.650]  So to try to alleviate some of my heat issues. I ran my lights in the evening
[04:46.290 --> 04:47.650]  And
[04:47.650 --> 04:50.130]  To I have my tent set up in my garage
[04:50.730 --> 04:53.770]  To try to get a little bit of air circulation
[04:54.290 --> 04:58.530]  Put some fans in the windows in the garage in blue air outward
[05:01.010 --> 05:08.050]  That's all well and good but now I've got daylight coming into the garage that normally is blocked off and
[05:08.730 --> 05:13.290]  So now I'm getting light coming in. I run my tents with negative pressure
[05:13.290 --> 05:16.130]  So I've got this extra stretch going on
[05:16.130 --> 05:23.290]  So all of my seams and zippers have the tiniest little pinholes when they're under a stress
[05:23.730 --> 05:25.450]  condition which
[05:25.450 --> 05:29.170]  Normally if I'm running at night, I'm not having the issue
[05:29.170 --> 05:33.450]  So what ended up happening was I noticed things were
[05:34.450 --> 05:36.450]  slowing down or
[05:37.130 --> 05:40.250]  I thought maybe we're taking a little bit longer than
[05:40.850 --> 05:43.530]  Normal to initiate and like I say, I'm not you know
[05:43.530 --> 05:50.090]  I don't have a lot of experience and I haven't seen enough plants to be able to say. Oh, well that's happening. This is happening
[05:50.730 --> 05:58.130]  I'm just kind of working backwards from what I had going on and and this is the best I can come up with for a solution
[05:58.810 --> 06:02.770]  And this was two tents worth and it you could actually
[06:03.530 --> 06:05.530]  see
[06:05.650 --> 06:09.850]  Almost like a drift across the tents where
[06:10.250 --> 06:13.130]  The light had gotten progressively worse
[06:13.770 --> 06:19.570]  Towards some other plants as opposed to the beginning, you know the way the light was coming in the room in other words
[06:20.290 --> 06:22.250]  and I
[06:22.250 --> 06:26.590]  One good thing I can say for anybody who's concerned especially mr. Trees
[06:27.450 --> 06:29.950]  nothing showed intersex trait, so
[06:30.570 --> 06:31.930]  they
[06:31.930 --> 06:33.930]  slowed down and
[06:35.050 --> 06:38.250]  Probably should have been finished two weeks ahead of when they were
[06:38.810 --> 06:40.810]  So
[06:41.130 --> 06:48.130]  There was that whole issue so, you know, I've got some funny structure I got some strange leaf
[06:48.850 --> 06:54.290]  You know variations simply for the fact that you know, they were getting confused ultimately
[06:55.050 --> 06:58.610]  and and again, I'm not upset because
[06:59.410 --> 07:02.650]  The flower rips me. I mean, it's absolute
[07:03.250 --> 07:04.490]  fire
[07:04.490 --> 07:10.170]  So I'm thrilled with the quality the the the flavors it's it's crazy
[07:10.170 --> 07:13.850]  I've got one that I just can't stop smoking. It tastes like I
[07:14.490 --> 07:18.890]  Call it Thanksgiving dinner. It's it's got like this
[07:19.850 --> 07:24.850]  Every time I smell it I smell stuffing brought it to Cheddar Bob's today
[07:24.850 --> 07:29.690]  He smelled the celery and then he's like, yeah, he's like I think it's you know
[07:29.690 --> 07:34.570]  I just it's Thanksgiving dinner in a jar. I love it. It hits super hard
[07:35.410 --> 07:41.050]  You know, it was it was fun. It's it's it's definitely fire weed. No question about it
[07:43.330 --> 07:47.050]  It's hard it's hard to grow in the summertime, I was sorry to interrupt you
[07:47.050 --> 07:50.250]  No, no, I was thinking like summertime indoor man
[07:50.250 --> 07:54.890]  That's if you're not, you know, you're not locked in with like a good pure
[07:55.410 --> 08:01.010]  Air conditioned controlled environment fuck man. You're you're a you know
[08:03.010 --> 08:05.810]  Yeah, summer blood is tough to pull off inside so
[08:06.450 --> 08:11.530]  That explains a lot. I didn't know I didn't know you you know that that you were you know that you were
[08:12.050 --> 08:15.050]  Doing you flipped your lights so that it was nighttime at daytime, too
[08:15.050 --> 08:18.690]  And that always gets me all fucking all wild too
[08:18.690 --> 08:22.250]  You know what? I mean, whatever you have to do that to conserve for heat and all that other stuff here
[08:22.970 --> 08:30.290]  Everything wants to be at a certain point at a certain point everything gets kind of confused and upside down and it's yeah, it's tough
[08:30.290 --> 08:32.730]  It's tough in the summertime, but that's cool. That's good
[08:34.570 --> 08:41.650]  Definitely, you know it gave it gave me a good idea that those plants don't care about you know getting some light leak
[08:41.650 --> 08:43.650]  you know, so
[08:45.450 --> 08:48.490]  That's it that's a good thing in my opinion so, you know my mistake
[08:49.010 --> 08:54.690]  Benefits somebody else in the future, you know, if you've got if you've got an issue where you might get some light leaks
[08:54.690 --> 08:59.090]  I didn't see out of the four females that I had any intersex traits and
[09:01.090 --> 09:05.490]  Yeah, I I only cut them down because I got scared
[09:08.410 --> 09:14.090]  Quite honestly, so it it's I think they would have been fine going longer
[09:14.930 --> 09:21.770]  I've got a you know, what's probably a 13 week or Bickett og was in the same tent
[09:22.650 --> 09:28.890]  And you know, they I probably could have let it go the same length. It it would have been fine
[09:28.890 --> 09:30.890]  I just got I got scared
[09:32.490 --> 09:39.450]  Yeah, that that intersex trait is not an on-off switch it's actually a percentage of
[09:40.050 --> 09:42.050]  stress
[09:42.530 --> 09:47.290]  Modulation so once it hits a certain amount of stress then it goes so
[09:49.530 --> 09:52.810]  He just bred a very very strong
[09:54.930 --> 10:01.330]  Resilient that just doesn't want to respond to that stress which is actually
[10:01.970 --> 10:03.970]  as far as
[10:05.210 --> 10:07.490]  Like I guess, you know
[10:07.890 --> 10:12.770]  Making more progeny goes is it the best thing because
[10:13.490 --> 10:19.810]  Then it's less likely to make more seats because that's the whole point is it exists to make seats
[10:20.770 --> 10:23.250]  We don't want it for that. But you know
[10:24.170 --> 10:26.170]  That's what it exists for
[10:26.490 --> 10:30.730]  but yeah, I mean it's really cool that like you're able to find that and
[10:30.730 --> 10:33.930]  Yeah, I I noticed the same thing as far as
[10:34.810 --> 10:38.330]  That stuff goes like because it is chem base. I
[10:38.970 --> 10:42.170]  Did not notice any intersex traits
[10:43.770 --> 10:46.650]  Even pushing the hell out of it and like
[10:47.850 --> 10:52.650]  Flowering it then revenging it then re flowering it. It just didn't want to go
[10:53.850 --> 10:57.770]  So, I mean it's it's some solid genetics
[10:57.850 --> 11:06.090]  The only thing I would work on is the KMR side it looks a little bit like some of the KMR
[11:08.170 --> 11:12.010]  Male progeny it just seemed like
[11:13.450 --> 11:19.450]  It was doing something. I don't know odd where you have really good ones and then
[11:20.330 --> 11:25.290]  Just okay ones, but the really good ones are the ones that are like
[11:25.290 --> 11:31.690]  Just okay ones, but the really good ones are insane and then the okay ones are just you know
[11:33.130 --> 11:35.130]  Kind of it's okay. What do you mean?
[11:35.850 --> 11:40.570]  Do you mind me ask what you what do you mean by just okay versus really good like it like
[11:41.450 --> 11:43.130]  Explain that out
[11:43.130 --> 11:45.130]  Okay, so like morphologically
[11:45.610 --> 11:47.610]  uh, they would be
[11:48.330 --> 11:52.490]  Darker green they wouldn't need as many nutrients. They didn't need as much care
[11:53.050 --> 11:55.050]  bigger leaves
[11:55.130 --> 12:00.890]  Yeah, yeah, the leaves would be more like upward and happy and they'd be darker green and all that
[12:01.610 --> 12:03.130]  uh
[12:03.130 --> 12:06.670]  But you know what though that's that was that was my frostiest
[12:07.610 --> 12:14.170]  Plant was that was that funny one that you're talking about and that could just be who the hell knows. I mean, I didn't run
[12:14.650 --> 12:16.810]  a ton of them, but that was my
[12:17.350 --> 12:19.350]  Frostiest plant that that funky looking
[12:20.250 --> 12:22.570]  You know, whatever you said that was the kenda
[12:23.450 --> 12:25.610]  Not so good one, you know what I mean, I don't yeah
[12:26.730 --> 12:33.290]  The bud structure was like kind of weird and that's what like I was kind of scared of that one. I thought but it started to
[12:33.850 --> 12:35.850]  come
[12:35.850 --> 12:39.690]  Yeah, you know what I mean it grew itself out of it almost you know, but
[12:41.130 --> 12:48.830]  Time it's kind of like train wreck when you grow train wreck out like it takes forever to veg out to to like maturity
[12:49.630 --> 12:55.070]  And so you got this gangly like retarded looking plant with these tiny leaves and stuff
[12:55.710 --> 12:58.830]  But then once it finally gets there, then it's good to go
[12:59.630 --> 13:03.870]  But yeah, I mean like they got out of it like they snapped out of it
[13:03.950 --> 13:05.470]  but it was like
[13:05.470 --> 13:11.630]  There were some that were fast and there were some that were slow and I generally just select for like the speed
[13:12.350 --> 13:13.150]  uh
[13:13.150 --> 13:18.030]  just because you know in this industry, you got to just go as quickly as possible, but
[13:18.830 --> 13:26.030]  I'm sure there was some good stuff in there. I just selected the fastest girls I could find and then I just went with them
[13:26.830 --> 13:28.270]  and um
[13:28.270 --> 13:33.630]  They turned out really nice. And yeah, I want to I want to show you all them in a second. But uh
[13:34.830 --> 13:36.030]  Yeah
[13:36.030 --> 13:38.030]  awesome cross
[13:38.190 --> 13:40.190]  It's it's funny like the uh
[13:41.050 --> 13:43.070]  Everything that that it touched
[13:44.030 --> 13:49.790]  Were like pretty plants, you know, like the pam is a pretty plant like buds are very pretty the
[13:50.350 --> 13:52.830]  Ice cream cake is a pretty plant buds are pretty
[13:53.470 --> 14:00.270]  Uh sfe is a pretty plant like the nugs look really pretty and solid and and you know, it's like they're all
[14:00.970 --> 14:02.430]  beautiful
[14:02.430 --> 14:09.710]  Looking plants, you know, and as soon as the candahar tested it made everything ugly and tough and more leafy and
[14:10.270 --> 14:11.870]  um
[14:11.870 --> 14:16.750]  Kind of just a little more rough around the edges, you know, I noticed a lot more
[14:17.310 --> 14:23.070]  Like short squattyness to a lot of the frame, you know what I mean and long running buds, you know, I noticed
[14:23.710 --> 14:24.910]  um
[14:24.910 --> 14:30.670]  The good the best thing that I noticed about I think out of all those and I just made a post too of the pure one
[14:31.470 --> 14:36.430]  Uh candahar stock a picture a picture of the one of the pure one of the pure ones
[14:36.990 --> 14:38.430]  Um
[14:38.430 --> 14:43.230]  And out of all this out of all the plants that were done outside this year
[14:43.630 --> 14:48.270]  The candahar's got very little budworm damage compared to anybody else if any
[14:48.670 --> 14:52.830]  A couple of them were completely kind of just left alone didn't bother anything
[14:53.390 --> 14:54.430]  um
[14:54.430 --> 14:59.070]  Which was odd because around here everything gets decimated. It just gets left out, you know what I mean?
[14:59.070 --> 15:01.950]  It's just like doesn't really matter. It's like there's nothing that really will
[15:02.510 --> 15:06.190]  Will resist that but compared speaking I I
[15:06.910 --> 15:11.470]  It had some budworm resistance, you know what I mean? I'm kind of kind of blown away by that. Um
[15:12.750 --> 15:14.750]  the the garbage skunk
[15:15.550 --> 15:21.150]  Nasty turps that I was looking for aren't as prevalent in that p1 stock, you know in those females, you know
[15:21.150 --> 15:24.990]  it's like it's very it's very creamy very spicy very
[15:25.630 --> 15:29.230]  kind of just kind of different kind of kind of woody and
[15:30.190 --> 15:32.190]  Unusual nothing that's like, you know
[15:33.710 --> 15:37.550]  You know a modern type smell that you're like, oh that's what this is, you know, um
[15:38.910 --> 15:40.110]  so
[15:40.110 --> 15:42.350]  it's really an interesting plan on how the the
[15:43.070 --> 15:48.990]  Like the ugly and toughness factor kind of was just like pushed into all the all the offspring
[15:49.390 --> 15:51.390]  but i'm wondering if like
[15:51.390 --> 15:54.030]  You know the like that resistance factor
[15:54.510 --> 16:01.070]  Is is the one thing that I could pull from pull from the cross like that on like the budworms and their outdoor stuff and
[16:01.470 --> 16:04.990]  Um the bud rod. I didn't have a lot of those types of things and issues that way
[16:05.470 --> 16:07.470]  um, so i'd like to
[16:08.350 --> 16:12.270]  Look at that a little bit more but as far as like making good plants that are going to go in jars
[16:12.270 --> 16:15.390]  It's hard man. That's it. That's those are those are taking genetics out
[16:16.030 --> 16:20.590]  And working those lines it needs to be refined a lot, you know across across this
[16:20.670 --> 16:24.510]  You got to really look through them and find find the ones that you're really looking for it's got a
[16:24.830 --> 16:27.790]  It's got a lot of work in there, especially on the pure side
[16:28.190 --> 16:33.550]  And then once once it crosses it to those those polyhybrids and those other those other cool plants
[16:34.030 --> 16:38.610]  There is some cool fucking shit that those those plants definitely improve the smokability
[16:39.470 --> 16:41.470]  You know factor the turf factor
[16:41.950 --> 16:43.870]  the resin factor
[16:43.870 --> 16:48.670]  A lot of those things but there's yeah, you gotta you gotta look through some to find find something
[16:48.750 --> 16:53.630]  So there's some resistance genes for outdoors and things in there that I was blown away by
[16:54.990 --> 16:58.590]  And i've seen it across a few different places. So it's not just like here or other, you know
[16:58.590 --> 17:04.030]  I've seen it across a couple places here in this area amongst my my little group group of buddies and stuff
[17:04.750 --> 17:07.950]  um, and it's been consistent there with that pure stock too, so
[17:08.510 --> 17:10.910]  Pretty cool. Pretty interesting, you know, but
[17:10.910 --> 17:12.910]  So
[17:14.190 --> 17:19.550]  Nick how you doing brother? You look like you're having a good listen and meditate
[17:20.590 --> 17:24.190]  I am man. I've been super busy. I've had some
[17:24.910 --> 17:26.910]  You know really?
[17:26.910 --> 17:32.350]  Weird things happen at the farm this year with some genetics and i'm just I don't know just
[17:32.990 --> 17:35.790]  Listening to everything man and kind of playing the game
[17:35.790 --> 17:41.550]  And kind of you know, all you can do is make your best judgment but you guys talking about this weird stuff and
[17:42.350 --> 17:44.350]  you know, uh
[17:44.350 --> 17:48.430]  man, I had some genetics and I can't tell you if they were like just
[17:49.390 --> 17:51.390]  trash genetics or
[17:51.470 --> 17:55.470]  Or really what? Um, you know, I have some stuff that I
[17:57.550 --> 17:59.150]  I've bred
[17:59.150 --> 18:01.150]  You know, I've bred
[18:01.150 --> 18:06.590]  I've bred a whole bunch of plants outside and kind of just threw all these plants a big pile and
[18:07.230 --> 18:11.470]  Just weed eat it around it all year and a bunch of plants came up, you know, like
[18:12.110 --> 18:14.510]  It wasn't planned. It's not what I picked but
[18:15.150 --> 18:21.550]  Man, some really cool stock came out of it and I was like damn man. This is really workable. It was like uk cheese and like
[18:23.070 --> 18:25.870]  Red lebanese, creole, and like
[18:26.750 --> 18:32.830]  Red lebanese to sourdough and white widow to sourdough. I mean, there's just some really cool stuff out there man and like, uh,
[18:33.470 --> 18:36.270]  You know, I just kind of well bred
[18:36.910 --> 18:41.470]  Red lebanese to like I don't know 12 different things that I had running
[18:42.190 --> 18:44.690]  That was crossed with an original skunk 18
[18:45.230 --> 18:48.990]  and it was some work that uh a guy did with
[18:48.990 --> 18:50.990]  Kevin jodry and um
[18:52.030 --> 18:54.770]  Man, some of this stuff came up. It was just phenomenal
[18:55.310 --> 19:01.150]  Some of it was kind of like weird and mutant, you know, like the leech structure and those got called fast and
[19:01.710 --> 19:05.630]  The some of my males that just I knew were males that I just didn't like
[19:06.190 --> 19:11.070]  At all the plant just in general cut them out, you know, and like I don't know
[19:11.070 --> 19:14.910]  I just I just I just I just I just I just I just I just
[19:15.230 --> 19:20.750]  Just in general cut them out, you know, and like I don't know about like 30 plants came up and
[19:21.870 --> 19:27.150]  I was left with like, I don't know 11 or something like that at the end and I had like
[19:27.790 --> 19:31.150]  Three males that were just like one that flowered super fast
[19:31.630 --> 19:34.190]  One that had the greatest structure i've ever seen
[19:34.750 --> 19:40.430]  and one that chucked the most pollen i've ever seen and it like the whole plant structure was just
[19:41.230 --> 19:43.230]  beautiful christmas tree, you know and
[19:43.230 --> 19:50.670]  I had some females there and I'm but some of this stuff like rotted from the bottom up and never finished out
[19:52.230 --> 19:57.450]  Like literally like the the and I had that with some other stuff
[19:57.450 --> 20:03.410]  I ran some other breeders stuff. That wasn't my stuff that I bred in the backyard and I had my
[20:04.510 --> 20:08.890]  Dad's neighbor's house and I gifted some stuff and I you know
[20:08.890 --> 20:11.830]  I was going through and I just kind of helped people grow weed and
[20:11.990 --> 20:13.150]  And
[20:13.150 --> 20:18.450]  And I dry it for him and everything and give him back a good product that way they're not smoking mold and shit
[20:18.450 --> 20:22.510]  you know, I mean that's this for me that's big and I try to
[20:23.030 --> 20:28.510]  Just help everybody out and they get to help me sift through genetics because I don't have a great big facility
[20:28.510 --> 20:33.870]  But I do my own but like so the the tops never finished out and the bottoms
[20:34.950 --> 20:41.170]  Never really finished either but they turned brown and started rotting like and it wasn't from caterpillar damage
[20:41.170 --> 20:45.410]  It wasn't from rude aphids. I mean dude, I had microscopes out. I had
[20:46.050 --> 20:50.150]  Everything known to man and I just I really couldn't tell you what it was
[20:50.150 --> 20:51.450]  I you know
[20:51.450 --> 20:56.790]  I did a whole bunch of reading asking people stuff and some people say it's bad genetics
[20:56.790 --> 21:01.410]  Some people say sativas and I don't grow a lot of sativas here in in
[21:02.050 --> 21:04.930]  Oklahoma man, they just don't work. I mean, they're too long
[21:05.250 --> 21:12.450]  We don't have the season and they they just don't work they're just fluffy buds that never turn into a
[21:13.170 --> 21:17.610]  Rock-hard sellability bud that so I can't I can't really mess with it indoor
[21:17.610 --> 21:24.930]  I could probably work it but it takes to some of them take too long on coastal but I was what I was saying is
[21:25.850 --> 21:34.090]  yeah, they just never like the trichomes never even got close to ambrine or tinging or and it and I had a few of
[21:34.210 --> 21:39.970]  them and they're like all the same genetics side-by-side and even like some of these other breeders genetics and
[21:40.170 --> 21:46.890]  Just going through there and I've never seen anything like that before and some of and even some of the stuff
[21:47.130 --> 21:48.770]  That I ran through
[21:48.770 --> 21:54.770]  Was weird had a weird leaf structure, you know, like flowered and flowered again almost like
[21:55.410 --> 22:02.930]  It was like a rudder Ellis type of thing, but it wasn't you know, or supposedly wasn't I mean, I don't know
[22:02.930 --> 22:04.930]  I just saw some weird stuff this year
[22:05.930 --> 22:09.130]  sifting newer genetics because I'm trying to
[22:09.970 --> 22:12.630]  Not only sift the hype and follow the hype
[22:12.630 --> 22:18.770]  But I'm also trying to bring that old school stuff back into it and I did get you to pollen and everything
[22:18.850 --> 22:21.930]  coastal that was that was really cool. It's in the freezer and
[22:23.530 --> 22:25.530]  Yeah, shout out to
[22:25.730 --> 22:30.690]  Dag of love man. I told Peter I bought some spice cream from
[22:31.610 --> 22:33.250]  Emerald
[22:33.250 --> 22:34.370]  and
[22:34.370 --> 22:36.530]  Emerald Mountain and they didn't pop
[22:36.530 --> 22:37.530]  I mean
[22:37.530 --> 22:42.650]  he gifted me another pack to replace that because I was super stoked about it because I'm trying to do like a
[22:42.970 --> 22:47.770]  Three two three line some genetics up, you know, like when you breed cattle or dogs
[22:48.330 --> 22:50.570]  Just bringing three of the same
[22:51.090 --> 22:55.330]  Back to you know and making a three two three a full circle
[22:55.930 --> 23:00.930]  But what were you gonna say coastal maybe you guys have you guys ever seen or
[23:01.530 --> 23:07.370]  Dealt with anything like that. Like that was the weirdest thing. I mean, dude, I am so high
[23:07.370 --> 23:09.610]  I forgot what I was even gonna say
[23:09.610 --> 23:11.610]  The
[23:11.610 --> 23:18.250]  Rotten from the bottom up, you know what I mean and having buds rotten and it's not fucking caterpillars and stuff like that
[23:18.250 --> 23:22.650]  Then I mean that's that's you know, like high humidity
[23:23.930 --> 23:29.530]  Buds getting wet in some aspect like spraying the buds with something or it's really foggy out or
[23:30.410 --> 23:32.410]  You know other places things like that
[23:33.050 --> 23:35.970]  But I mean, I think that's the thing. I mean, I think that's the thing
[23:36.090 --> 23:37.530]  Or
[23:37.530 --> 23:39.530]  You know other places things like that
[23:40.770 --> 23:47.190]  Like bugs and stuff aren't gonna cause the rot aside from the the caterpillars causing the damage and then that causes the blood rot
[23:47.190 --> 23:49.770]  That's like 99% of the problem usually, you know what I mean?
[23:49.770 --> 23:53.330]  But if it wasn't any of the caterpillar action and it was literally rotting from the bottom up
[23:53.610 --> 23:56.830]  Now that's like some sort of a root root fungus root rot
[23:57.210 --> 24:02.290]  Some sort of a bad pathogen in the soil some long something along those lines. So I
[24:03.250 --> 24:05.250]  hit the
[24:06.010 --> 24:08.010]  Epithelium
[24:08.010 --> 24:10.330]  Something like that's a root rot fungus, you know
[24:11.730 --> 24:14.090]  Yeah, I dry farm so I don't water man
[24:15.570 --> 24:17.570]  That's that
[24:17.650 --> 24:25.330]  Yeah, I don't water once not not all year on the plants do their thing and the soil and I just mulch
[24:25.850 --> 24:30.450]  I just keep the mow my grass and keep the grass on it
[24:30.810 --> 24:35.090]  But like you were saying the humidity thing man, we had some spikes in humidity
[24:35.090 --> 24:41.170]  We had some like hundred degree days when they were flowering because they were kind of like some early flowers
[24:41.170 --> 24:45.010]  I think they like like I said more sativa leaning but like
[24:46.170 --> 24:49.890]  Mmm, it just when I've ran a bunch of stuff
[24:49.890 --> 24:56.090]  But I've never had that problem before and I like we had some off days like like two or three days
[24:56.090 --> 25:01.170]  It was like a hundred and three degrees here with like high humidity and there was buds on there
[25:01.170 --> 25:05.650]  And then it was like the next day like 70 degrees and cool
[25:05.650 --> 25:06.850]  And you know
[25:06.850 --> 25:14.330]  We just had this back-and-forth battle kind of all year and I just think maybe they the genetics just didn't line up to work
[25:14.330 --> 25:16.850]  With our client climate or something
[25:16.850 --> 25:21.770]  But like I don't want to say they're trash genetics because some of them were like man, dude
[25:21.770 --> 25:26.010]  They look so phenomenal and I was like, dude, these are so workable
[25:26.010 --> 25:29.450]  I could work with these and I like almost want to take them inside and
[25:30.050 --> 25:31.250]  and
[25:31.250 --> 25:35.850]  See what they're capable of inside because they didn't work outside, but they were like
[25:36.490 --> 25:41.850]  super pretty like I have a I have a but I'll show you it's like I
[25:42.450 --> 25:48.770]  Kept the very tippy top like the tippy top and then everything else under it was like whatever but I
[25:49.290 --> 25:55.930]  I don't know. It was cool. But back to the candor man that that was a really cool strain. I
[25:56.650 --> 25:58.010]  smoked
[25:58.010 --> 25:59.690]  that
[25:59.690 --> 26:03.170]  Number two Fino and it was almost like a tamarind
[26:04.410 --> 26:06.410]  You know, I had that spicy
[26:06.850 --> 26:14.930]  Sweet note it was dude. It was really phenomenal. It was unique. I had one that was like a woody. I
[26:15.810 --> 26:23.210]  Want to say a cedar kind of orangey cedar, you know some orange peel in it like it was it was really nice
[26:23.210 --> 26:26.290]  I think that was Fino seven. I
[26:27.530 --> 26:28.970]  still have
[26:28.970 --> 26:35.210]  All six females because I'm picky. I want to go back through him again. It wasn't the perfect run
[26:35.210 --> 26:37.290]  I'd like to run them outside and get it
[26:38.450 --> 26:40.490]  Vegged up to throw them out in time
[26:40.490 --> 26:44.250]  But maybe one of my friends let me throw it in the greenhouse or something and
[26:45.930 --> 26:50.850]  But I kept a male and I chucked Paul in having a
[26:51.610 --> 26:55.050]  clone of the male and I'm gonna cross it to
[26:56.250 --> 26:58.250]  Coastals little
[26:58.450 --> 27:02.250]  Purple haze thing cuz really man, I like the Pam
[27:02.570 --> 27:07.530]  I've been looking at your Pam pictures all Pam one Pam 15
[27:07.530 --> 27:13.650]  I don't know is Pam 13 Nick Lima reasons, right? He's running that I
[27:14.650 --> 27:21.050]  Didn't know there was a 13 or whatever, but did they all look all the Pam's look good
[27:21.050 --> 27:23.050]  I even want to go on dagger and buy the
[27:23.450 --> 27:28.370]  Pam 15 cross just to see what it did to the one, you know, like
[27:29.330 --> 27:31.330]  the Pam's and
[27:31.810 --> 27:36.290]  Super nice. And they're cool man. What I've really learned to this year
[27:36.290 --> 27:37.610]  I
[27:37.610 --> 27:42.690]  Confirmed it this year the last couple years like I've seen it kind of happen and I was like I wonder if it was a
[27:42.690 --> 27:50.050]  fluke and this year I kind of set up a situation where it could kind of like happen like in a controlled environment and
[27:51.090 --> 27:59.010]  The 15 and the one my Pam one and the fam 15 the gophers don't like them. They won't eat them, which is really odd
[27:59.890 --> 28:03.090]  I live out where there's where there's tons of gophers, right?
[28:03.090 --> 28:05.530]  And it's like a big fucking issue here
[28:05.530 --> 28:09.650]  Like I kill gophers all the time, even though I don't want to I have to kill lots of gophers
[28:09.650 --> 28:11.930]  it's just the way that it is here and
[28:13.570 --> 28:18.890]  Every time that I put like a few plants outside like the Mac one SSE the Royal
[28:19.250 --> 28:20.490]  Within a day or two
[28:20.490 --> 28:22.730]  They're pulled down no matter how big they are
[28:22.730 --> 28:27.370]  They can be three foot tall and set up as soon as I place them and you know in the ground and they can even
[28:27.370 --> 28:28.770]  Be in a few greenhouse areas
[28:28.770 --> 28:34.650]  I haven't refurbished in a while where the gophers made their way up through and have gotten into the greenhouse area now
[28:35.250 --> 28:42.610]  But they go specifically for those ones and they'll pull them down and they'll eat those motherfuckers like nothing and it's it's it's a serious deal
[28:42.610 --> 28:46.770]  I have to really have to really put forethought into you know, you know go for patrol
[28:47.330 --> 28:52.450]  When I put certain plants out, but every time I have a couple of Pam's
[28:53.050 --> 28:58.730]  In the mix with these and they're never touched and like the last couple years I'm like, yes, whatever
[28:58.730 --> 29:01.770]  I killed them before it got a chance to eat the Pam or what?
[29:01.770 --> 29:06.530]  you know what I'm saying? So this year I said it up and like a no known gopher area and
[29:07.130 --> 29:09.130]  Put put the Pam's in there
[29:09.130 --> 29:13.490]  Kind of put put them put the Mac in there a couple of those other ones in there and within three days
[29:14.090 --> 29:18.090]  Within three days like two of them are gone, you know, like it was like it was like Mac and og
[29:18.090 --> 29:19.170]  You're gone. You know what? I mean?
[29:19.170 --> 29:21.090]  It's like no more if that was all you had it there we go
[29:21.090 --> 29:24.330]  you know and then like another day or two went by and then like
[29:24.490 --> 29:29.210]  slowly the other ones got picked off and then I left them and I let him sit there and
[29:30.930 --> 29:35.570]  It slowly got down to just Pam one and Pam 15 and they were completely different spots
[29:35.570 --> 29:38.650]  you know what I mean in that little plot, you know apart from each other and
[29:39.770 --> 29:45.250]  They made it all the way through and nothing ever my fucking touched us and everybody else around them
[29:45.250 --> 29:48.810]  Just got picked off like fucking, you know, like snipers, you know, like just
[29:49.810 --> 29:50.890]  so
[29:50.890 --> 29:56.010]  I'm gonna confirm it, you know what I mean? It's like they got some of that resistance in there that they don't like for sure
[29:56.010 --> 29:57.410]  you know, but
[29:57.410 --> 30:03.530]  They're great great plants, too. I mean, I wouldn't keep them just for that. But those are fun plants to smoke. I think
[30:05.050 --> 30:10.770]  I think the 13 is like the the Royal Pam which is the Royal
[30:15.250 --> 30:19.970]  That's a great that's a great combo for sure the Royal and the Royal and the Pam together
[30:20.130 --> 30:24.090]  They have similar profiles and stuff and the Pam has a different body
[30:24.530 --> 30:31.390]  Which really helps the Royals body and then the Royal has a lot of these other properties that helps out the Pam's properties the flavors
[30:31.390 --> 30:35.210]  And a couple other things that really kind of jump. So those are that's a good pairing for sure
[30:39.170 --> 30:41.170]  Yeah, I always want to know like
[30:42.170 --> 30:49.850]  You know the plants go through those little stress factors and stuff and man I've had plants get devoured by just
[30:50.250 --> 30:53.250]  grasshoppers like or crickets and like, you know
[30:53.250 --> 31:00.730]  you have all these plants in a room and it's like these single ones get singled out and it's like they get just
[31:00.770 --> 31:02.770]  mowed down by like
[31:02.930 --> 31:06.330]  Word where the fuck did these crickets come from?
[31:11.890 --> 31:13.170]  Or
[31:13.170 --> 31:15.170]  but man I ran your
[31:15.850 --> 31:18.570]  Pam on some of the I mean I
[31:19.650 --> 31:25.530]  Run all the genetics I run through I I put them through hell like every one of them
[31:25.530 --> 31:30.610]  I make sure they have my I make sure they have my it's because I have a dog so it's really easy
[31:30.610 --> 31:32.610]  Just let them in there
[31:33.530 --> 31:34.930]  I
[31:34.930 --> 31:41.250]  Mean I were even like I tried to bring high humidity in rooms. I try to bring mold
[31:43.090 --> 31:47.330]  Dude everything that I did to these plants they just
[31:48.250 --> 31:55.690]  fought at all they were super resistant and I know it's the Pam because the Pam shines through on all of them and
[31:56.450 --> 32:04.530]  and the Kandahar is a little funky, but man it I think the Kandahar brings a lot of CBD to
[32:05.690 --> 32:11.610]  to the whole mix like, you know all that leaf and everything and
[32:12.490 --> 32:18.610]  it brings like you were saying a lot of hardiness like I I dropped the temperature super cold and
[32:19.530 --> 32:26.250]  They you know how a lot of them they get that purple stock and then they just try to or black stock and they just
[32:26.250 --> 32:29.450]  Don't look good at all. Like yeah, this didn't do that
[32:29.450 --> 32:34.290]  I put them through sue I spiked the temperature like smoked it, you know
[32:34.290 --> 32:38.130]  and it was minimal minimal foxtailing and
[32:39.170 --> 32:41.810]  not a single intersex trait and
[32:42.570 --> 32:47.130]  Which is I mean, I had a lot of plants that I just called out
[32:47.130 --> 32:50.530]  You know and a lot of genetics that I was really wanting to work with
[32:51.090 --> 32:57.810]  It had great great parents great backgrounds, you know, like chasing numbers type of thing
[32:57.810 --> 33:01.650]  But you know, like if you chase numbers you might end up with nothing. I
[33:02.330 --> 33:04.170]  mean
[33:04.170 --> 33:06.090]  it just
[33:06.090 --> 33:11.850]  Dude, it's shined. It was really nice and I appreciate you letting let me
[33:12.490 --> 33:19.890]  have that one because I the Pam and I like I was saying I started looking at your pictures of the Pam and all your
[33:20.050 --> 33:23.010]  variations of Pam and all your crosses to it and like
[33:23.770 --> 33:25.770]  dude killer
[33:25.770 --> 33:27.770]  Yeah, I'll get yeah
[33:28.610 --> 33:30.610]  It's like
[33:31.530 --> 33:33.530]  It's a good breeding plan
[33:33.530 --> 33:38.610]  It's bred to Pam it really does. I mean it does some it's a good pairing for a lot of things
[33:38.610 --> 33:41.650]  It does a lot of improvements and then takes a lot of good things. It's
[33:42.170 --> 33:45.010]  Yeah, I've kept it a lot around a long time. You know what I mean?
[33:45.010 --> 33:49.450]  It's hard for people I can be why reserve a space, you know, you reserve a space for something
[33:49.450 --> 33:54.050]  It's like fuck you're out of here pretty quick, you know if you suck, you know, so I will get you some
[33:54.050 --> 34:00.530]  We'll get you some cool stock, you know of the different of the different Pam stuff so you can you can jump through there
[34:00.610 --> 34:02.610]  Cuz that's cool. It's cool to look at
[34:03.130 --> 34:04.450]  Yeah
[34:04.450 --> 34:07.130]  We're having a library, you know, I got a question
[34:07.690 --> 34:14.010]  If yes, you will be running the way I do in my tents. Would you pop the
[34:14.530 --> 34:15.770]  Pam
[34:15.770 --> 34:17.770]  Pam 15
[34:21.170 --> 34:28.650]  So what if so into what so yeah, so if I was I'd probably I mean if so the 15 is gonna give you a
[34:31.170 --> 34:36.690]  Taller plant, you know, I mean you'll either get a couple of and so you can have a choice
[34:36.970 --> 34:41.370]  Usually it'll either be one friggin single stock unless you're doing a lot of topping work
[34:41.370 --> 34:47.250]  You know what? I mean? Because it'll just go straight up and just be this tall thing or it'll be a really nice multi branched
[34:48.130 --> 34:51.170]  Tall lanky plant like the Pam at the 15 is a taller
[34:51.850 --> 34:53.850]  Scrawn plants
[34:54.290 --> 35:00.970]  Training all that stuff is awesome for that. You know what I mean? She's that anything like that would be great, you know
[35:01.930 --> 35:05.690]  Pam Pam one stuff is gonna be more modern, you know what I mean?
[35:05.690 --> 35:12.330]  You're gonna get a little bit of the taller stuff, but you're also gonna get more more modern bug bud structures like denser buds
[35:13.410 --> 35:15.410]  closer closer nodes
[35:16.770 --> 35:20.530]  You'll have you know a little bit more color with Pam one stuff
[35:20.530 --> 35:23.810]  She'll give you more color, you know and in her and her crosses
[35:24.490 --> 35:29.970]  The 15 is a little more wild. I keep the same sounds a little more tame the one sounds a little more team
[35:30.690 --> 35:36.610]  Yeah, like the Pam ones like it's like more modern and it's like the one what people expect to see when it's in the bag
[35:36.610 --> 35:39.750]  You know what? I mean? You can kind of a really good batch of Pam looks really nice
[35:39.750 --> 35:41.750]  I mean it looks it can look really nice
[35:41.970 --> 35:46.750]  The 15 it's it's gonna be it's gonna be different and you're gonna look at that
[35:46.870 --> 35:51.510]  What the fuck is that you're gonna open it's gonna be like dirty diapers and cheese and
[35:52.070 --> 35:58.790]  Like, you know like incense and funky tones like that with taller lankier plants and it's gonna have
[35:58.790 --> 36:02.910]  It's good. I like the high of the 15 better than than the one
[36:04.070 --> 36:05.510]  both
[36:05.510 --> 36:09.910]  One is like yeah, but the one makes makes really good plants
[36:09.910 --> 36:13.910]  You know what? I mean? Like everything with one makes really good traditional plants, you know
[36:14.390 --> 36:17.190]  It's hard to you know, it's good to have both of them
[36:17.190 --> 36:21.590]  That's why I keep them both because they're they're two different spectrums of the line, you know, I feel you
[36:21.590 --> 36:24.710]  I completely feel you're saying. Yep hundred percent. Yeah
[36:26.630 --> 36:30.070]  And so we got to do another another tester run with
[36:31.430 --> 36:37.990]  Something new, you know, like some I don't know some SF ES 1 or some I'm doing the
[36:43.910 --> 36:45.910]  Fucking name
[36:55.430 --> 37:00.990]  Who are you you know, that's right. That's right. Yeah, we'll have to do that one. I have to do that one next
[37:00.990 --> 37:02.990]  That's the that's the SFE
[37:04.230 --> 37:11.110]  Reverse is feminized. So you're gonna you know, everybody has any problems and my stuff and you can jump out now, but it's
[37:11.110 --> 37:13.110]  It's like
[37:21.430 --> 37:24.790]  Taking feminized and doing it very wrong
[37:25.390 --> 37:32.630]  Yes, you know, it's too long of a rabbit hole, but it's I love I would trust you. I would trust me. Yes
[37:33.710 --> 37:35.230]  Just come this way
[37:35.230 --> 37:40.030]  But yeah, the the SFV column reversed to the dog walker, which are like my two
[37:40.630 --> 37:46.110]  You know my two favorite smokes, you know, I love those are my two plants I love you can count on you know
[37:46.110 --> 37:51.830]  You're like I need something that that I can count on, you know, you're like you pull you reach for that jar, you know
[37:52.870 --> 37:57.090]  To the nastiest smelling, you know coolest resin
[37:58.030 --> 38:03.790]  Dankest plants that I love, you know, so I smash those together and that's the cowboy caviar
[38:03.790 --> 38:06.830]  So it's something that I can remake to which is cool
[38:06.830 --> 38:11.950]  So it's something that if everybody seems to like it and we we start running through it
[38:11.950 --> 38:16.510]  I got a bunch of people growing it now looking at it, you know all over and
[38:17.030 --> 38:21.630]  I got some that I've been working on for a little while that I'm finally getting into flower now
[38:21.630 --> 38:23.630]  So we'll see we'll see shortly
[38:24.230 --> 38:28.070]  But yeah, those those guys might be cool. And then there's a couple other ones
[38:28.070 --> 38:30.270]  There's some Mac ones and stuff, but I'll send you guys a list
[38:30.270 --> 38:35.150]  We'll come to the list and we can vote on on the next one that that we do and we'll do we'll do one of those
[38:35.710 --> 38:38.270]  Either way, I'll get you some cowboy caviar
[38:39.870 --> 38:43.630]  I'm so excited. I got to run in a four by before right now, and I'm
[38:44.430 --> 38:47.110]  Super excited soon as soon as I got him. I was like
[38:52.470 --> 38:54.470]  Yeah, man those are
[38:54.790 --> 38:58.790]  Yeah, I'm excited about that. I just got some maximum some Mac one
[38:59.590 --> 39:01.590]  to the Santa's cookies
[39:02.550 --> 39:08.350]  F2 so like the whole you know, then bread together again
[39:08.350 --> 39:10.470]  I just shucked a bunch of those seeds
[39:10.470 --> 39:12.390]  so I'm excited because the
[39:12.390 --> 39:19.070]  Resin mail and then the female that I chose out of the batch is like just just delicious spot-on
[39:19.470 --> 39:21.470]  Turps are turned up
[39:22.190 --> 39:24.110]  Santa's cookies is
[39:24.110 --> 39:26.110]  1979 Christmas bud
[39:26.110 --> 39:29.730]  Which is like this it's like I remember that shit I do
[39:31.750 --> 39:38.370]  School pine bud, you know what? I mean? It's this very piney old-school heavy-duty Indica type pine bud, right?
[39:40.630 --> 39:45.110]  It was really green yeah, no like really green as from you
[39:45.110 --> 39:49.070]  It's not used to see that type of stuff on the East Coast, you know stuff a lot. Yes
[39:49.070 --> 39:54.030]  It's the Christmas. Oh, yeah to the forum cookie. So the forum cookie clone, right?
[39:54.030 --> 39:57.030]  So it's Christmas bud the 1979 to the forum cookie clone
[39:57.030 --> 40:04.550]  so it took that that made Santa's cookies and then that was what I looked through that combination and
[40:05.790 --> 40:10.190]  Did a took a bunch of emails and I pollinated, you know a bunch of different things
[40:10.310 --> 40:16.510]  But I made I pollinated the Mac one as well and made that first initial cross and the Mac one didn't give me very many
[40:16.510 --> 40:22.870]  Seeds I got you know a friggin, you know, tiny little vial full of seeds out of that that were viable
[40:22.870 --> 40:30.450]  So I popped all of those ones and bred those together and then you know what? I mean? Here we go. We're going
[40:32.030 --> 40:38.510]  But the two that I really chose that I isolated that I'm you know excited about the pairing I got going on is really cool
[40:38.510 --> 40:43.550]  So I'm gonna look at this little batch here and we'll look at those two. Those are cool
[40:43.550 --> 40:46.430]  I finally got it to give me some seed now, so
[40:47.430 --> 40:52.270]  That's not a probably we got it. We got through that first phase, you know, we keep going get more seed out of it
[40:52.270 --> 40:57.950]  So I was telling my my dad the other day cuz we you know, we've been breeding stuff
[40:57.950 --> 41:03.390]  I was like, you know, everybody's always like oh no, there's seeds in my weed and I'm like
[41:16.270 --> 41:18.270]  It's it's just a fact
[41:19.270 --> 41:23.710]  Right each seed is worth like 10 bucks like, you know
[41:23.710 --> 41:30.050]  Like you're basically making more out of it by getting seeds than the bud itself
[41:30.790 --> 41:31.870]  and
[41:31.870 --> 41:38.950]  Like yeah people are bitching about it. I'm just sitting there like I'll trade you blood for fucking seeds cuz I
[41:39.470 --> 41:41.470]  Mean, I'll do that all day
[41:42.230 --> 41:43.390]  It's hilarious
[41:43.390 --> 41:48.910]  You have to pay $100 a pack of 10 seeds or you you could just get 10 seeds out of a bag
[41:50.070 --> 41:53.310]  Yeah, it's like a yeah, it's a free gift. Yeah, exactly
[41:54.150 --> 41:59.550]  It's it's just hilarious. It just depends who you are and how you look at it, I guess
[42:02.970 --> 42:08.130]  What are you smoking on London I'm seeing this swirls keep going on with this
[42:09.130 --> 42:11.130]  Yeah
[42:11.410 --> 42:18.290]  Yeah, I'm not a big dabber so I'm like looking at this like intricate it's fucking it's trippy as fuck
[42:18.290 --> 42:20.490]  It's cool as shit. I'm loving it
[42:26.810 --> 42:29.310]  So I've been I've been oh weird mystery go
[42:30.170 --> 42:35.170]  Mr. Treats here cuz I want to tell him what I was. Oh, yeah, you fucking look at that jar
[42:35.170 --> 42:41.050]  Do you know how much that jar like did you broke it? That's the it's hard to tell with the color
[42:41.050 --> 42:47.770]  Is it green a little bit? Did you a little but that's that's big, you know G Ross and fresh frozen
[42:50.650 --> 42:57.450]  Flower rosin flower rosin, right? No, no. No. Well fresh frozen though. Yeah, not sift. It's washed
[42:58.730 --> 43:01.730]  Okay, so you washed you made a bubble. I didn't I
[43:02.330 --> 43:09.130]  Mission Hill melts in Maine did it that's a beaut that's a big fucking jar man. I put in
[43:09.650 --> 43:15.610]  3,000 grams of flour frozen and got back after they took 25%
[43:17.050 --> 43:18.610]  160 grams
[43:18.610 --> 43:22.890]  so at almost 200 grams out of 3,000 of
[43:23.410 --> 43:25.410]  You know, I mean, so that's almost like
[43:26.090 --> 43:28.970]  Six point something seven percent somewhere in there
[43:29.970 --> 43:35.850]  It dumps a shit ton and it's fucking it smells like a skunk threw up gasoline
[43:38.690 --> 43:42.090]  Focus that flavor down and it's so good. So, okay
[43:42.090 --> 43:43.370]  so I got really
[43:43.370 --> 43:48.810]  we all got into this and I like ran over to go grab all my shit cuz I got a bunch of fuck because I've
[43:48.810 --> 43:52.450]  Just like giving up on running clones. I'm just like, you know, fuck it
[43:52.450 --> 43:55.890]  I got so many seeds and I know people and I want to plant all these seeds
[43:55.890 --> 44:01.730]  Let's just plant fucking seeds. So like all of these are by seed behind me and there's a lot of them
[44:01.730 --> 44:06.370]  There's another 20 30 over there. There's over there my fucking outdoor man
[44:06.370 --> 44:11.170]  And it wasn't the one outdoor that I have wasn't the aqua focal goal from Barney farms that I thought I was
[44:11.170 --> 44:16.850]  It's actually now that it's like full deep into flower. It's like sure no sub cools the dank Chernobyl
[44:17.090 --> 44:23.330]  It's like fucking just glorious man. And for the first time ever we've had a good enough year to be able to harvest
[44:23.330 --> 44:28.250]  So I like harvested kind of the primo stuff. We get a lot of mist in the mornings like I'm right by the water
[44:28.250 --> 44:34.370]  So like I haven't had to water because my plants water themselves from the from the fog. It's pretty fucked
[44:35.970 --> 44:39.250]  So they're doing brilliantly but it's like I'm kind of like well
[44:39.250 --> 44:42.250]  let's harvest that like all the top really nice stuff because
[44:42.610 --> 44:48.010]  It's ready and I don't like no point in losing it because and pushing it and getting greedy
[44:48.010 --> 44:52.330]  You know what? I mean? Like there's no point in getting greedy about it, right? Cuz I could just lose all of it
[44:52.970 --> 44:56.570]  But I got some great stuff I worked through some of Ryan Lee's stuff
[44:56.570 --> 45:02.090]  I actually had a male Paul and out a whole pollinate a whole section of
[45:04.650 --> 45:07.570]  Of it so I got a ton of the ice cream the
[45:07.810 --> 45:11.370]  Kenhara roof red cross ice cream cake cross like eight different things
[45:11.770 --> 45:16.610]  So I'll be like fucking pretty kind of fun to one of it some of its the velvet sky this beautiful purple
[45:16.890 --> 45:23.970]  Like a man the color in this and quick pretty quick to develop to in comparison to some of the others great plant a
[45:24.250 --> 45:27.850]  Really heavy heavy hitter grape. Oh gee like really nice plant
[45:28.410 --> 45:33.690]  I got so this is the Kenhara roof red. Oh shit. I gotta
[45:34.210 --> 45:36.730]  Put the other the flower power cam back in
[45:38.570 --> 45:46.290]  So this is the Kenhara roof red in a cream there's not much left because it's fucking delicious
[45:46.610 --> 45:47.850]  I
[45:47.850 --> 45:49.850]  Love that jar. I
[45:50.810 --> 45:56.050]  Got so many of these is ridiculous. You can you want some I'll fucking send you some of their fucking I got wait
[45:56.050 --> 46:00.570]  That is fucking badass, but it is beautiful. It's a nice cream
[46:00.570 --> 46:05.130]  And that's just straight flower rosin not not hash not nothing just flower smashed
[46:05.850 --> 46:11.850]  Right nice like kind of gold amber like when I fret when I pressed it out. It was like beautiful and gold
[46:12.850 --> 46:18.650]  It's got a little red tone to it, maybe it's a light too, that's cool. No, that's cool. I like it
[46:18.650 --> 46:22.650]  Yeah, no it does have a little bit of red tone to it. You're right. I like that. I like that
[46:24.050 --> 46:29.890]  It's like smoky and it's got this amazing flavor profile to it is really really really nice
[46:30.770 --> 46:33.810]  It pressed out really good. I found so out of the pack
[46:33.810 --> 46:37.630]  I got like six like I'm a terrible seed popper
[46:37.630 --> 46:42.030]  So like you just got to remember this and I also lost a pack of seeds
[46:42.030 --> 46:44.710]  So we're not gonna even count the pack of seed that we lost. Okay
[46:49.310 --> 46:51.310]  Fuck you
[46:57.950 --> 47:03.190]  So anyways, I had I did pretty good I got I got three
[47:04.190 --> 47:07.910]  Good girls three good males out of six seeds that popped
[47:09.230 --> 47:12.350]  And and the males were strong very
[47:13.070 --> 47:18.030]  Beautiful plants they developed nicely and they fucking took some punishment. Mr. Treece. I
[47:19.190 --> 47:21.190]  Mean they really got fucked
[47:21.310 --> 47:25.870]  They got they got it hard and they were strong and powerful and they were able to get through it regardless
[47:26.470 --> 47:31.710]  They had a great rub great smell to them. I I would pick these plants out as a great flowering plant
[47:33.430 --> 47:34.990]  And then so I
[47:34.990 --> 47:38.150]  They pollinated a whole bunch of stuff then I got three females
[47:38.510 --> 47:45.250]  One of them was a little bit kind of like I think I had a watering issue because I just didn't get proper development
[47:45.550 --> 47:46.710]  Another one was alright
[47:46.710 --> 47:53.230]  And then we were talking a little bit about the the bud development is they all had that putrid II smell during during flower
[47:53.230 --> 47:55.230]  Actually, they all really lean to that
[47:55.510 --> 48:00.070]  Fish umami, but they really dug into the ice cream cake after harvest
[48:00.510 --> 48:07.350]  They got like this creamy kind of rich umami kind of tone to them it was like it's a rope
[48:09.070 --> 48:13.430]  Like
[48:13.750 --> 48:15.750]  It's beautiful it's a really nice plan
[48:19.710 --> 48:21.410]  Yeah, and I got and it's cool
[48:21.410 --> 48:29.110]  It was the the leaf shape with the short stubby fucking fat thickly like they were thick the leaves were fucking thick
[48:30.150 --> 48:32.150]  thick leaves
[48:32.790 --> 48:36.390]  Yeah, I like really strong like I got one I
[48:38.470 --> 48:46.530]  Don't know this doesn't represent now, I don't have anything that represents it correctly, but like really thick and beautiful like route
[48:48.790 --> 48:54.070]  Rounded at the tips I want to say I don't remember exactly we'll have to play back the video go back to the previous
[48:54.270 --> 48:56.270]  Episodes you'll be able to find it
[48:58.070 --> 49:00.070]  And
[49:00.550 --> 49:02.550]  Yeah
[49:03.150 --> 49:05.150]  Came in one of them really
[49:05.310 --> 49:09.030]  Favored the ice cream cake side, and I actually showed it to Kevin Jodri
[49:09.030 --> 49:13.190]  And he thought it was like really favored that side to it was very interesting kind of plant
[49:13.950 --> 49:15.550]  I
[49:15.550 --> 49:20.310]  Loved it. It was beautiful great grow very fun very unique. I would definitely tell anybody to do it
[49:20.310 --> 49:22.310]  What's the pack size on it again?
[49:24.550 --> 49:29.390]  They're like I think it says 12 12 regular seeds, but there's more than that in there
[49:30.110 --> 49:31.390]  12 regular
[49:31.390 --> 49:36.470]  Per pack yeah, that's falling. Yeah, that's falling. Yeah, man. Oh, there's more than that
[49:37.230 --> 49:42.030]  That's a good pack of beans and and the beans are fucking quality and you get some fun
[49:42.030 --> 49:45.630]  And you get just Tyler's cool like that he throws in extra
[49:51.350 --> 49:56.910]  12 in there and you get like 10 or 11 and like to premature fuck
[49:59.390 --> 50:01.390]  $100 on this
[50:01.790 --> 50:03.790]  No
[50:03.990 --> 50:06.310]  You should get you should get a plethora bag
[50:06.830 --> 50:10.330]  Has the best bag I primo dear yeah
[50:11.150 --> 50:14.030]  Lying Dutchman was the worst of that shit
[50:17.630 --> 50:20.750]  They don't even exist and I don't even know if any of the other
[50:23.070 --> 50:28.350]  Yeah, yeah, I mean back then it was like anything was good. It was all good
[50:29.990 --> 50:32.230]  It was all good, you know it was something
[50:33.110 --> 50:35.110]  It was something exactly exactly
[50:36.750 --> 50:41.350]  The thing is is is if you roll up to a party with this
[50:42.710 --> 50:46.310]  You're gonna be it's loud, and it's it's different
[50:46.630 --> 50:53.310]  Okay, like not nobody nobody else in the room is gonna have something that's gonna taste or smoke like this
[50:53.910 --> 50:57.670]  Just straight up so it's a really cool smoke so you got to try it
[50:57.670 --> 51:02.150]  I don't know if it's and it's not something you're ever gonna find commercially
[51:02.150 --> 51:06.590]  I'm sorry the yield on it was like the ideal cut was on it good
[51:06.590 --> 51:11.950]  But I did have like when you really let the bud stack out and you put it under LEDs
[51:11.950 --> 51:17.710]  And you and you pushed it kind of with a mix of blend nutrients some of them sickened out quite a bit and
[51:18.270 --> 51:20.750]  They could they got a little bit of mud rye in there
[51:20.750 --> 51:27.070]  Not like there was a little bit there. You know, but that was like I pushed him pretty hard
[51:28.590 --> 51:30.590]  You know
[51:36.110 --> 51:43.870]  So it is and and it wasn't the perfect row they had a couple dry out moments better that that that I wouldn't
[51:43.870 --> 51:45.870]  Regularly let happen
[51:45.910 --> 51:47.750]  But like a beautiful
[51:48.750 --> 51:55.910]  It's interesting like like you know setting out to like do it do the initial thing and look look for something
[51:55.910 --> 52:00.390]  You know what I mean, and it's just in the end. I didn't find what I was looking for at all
[52:00.390 --> 52:02.870]  You know what I mean, but I did find some cool different little
[52:03.510 --> 52:07.670]  Surprises and and and things in there, which is cool to you know to kind of like
[52:07.670 --> 52:11.230]  You know like you know like you know like you know like you know like you know
[52:11.230 --> 52:13.230]  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean
[52:13.870 --> 52:20.030]  Surprises and and and things in there, which is cool to you know to kind of see across the board, you know
[52:21.230 --> 52:23.230]  special
[52:28.590 --> 52:32.670]  Like you've gone through a lot of stuff like what did you what do you find is unique about it?
[52:32.670 --> 52:35.430]  What did what did what were you expecting? What were you looking for?
[52:39.080 --> 52:42.600]  Sorry, you kind of wanted but I wanted more nasty. Oh
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.960]  I wanted more nasty nasty turps, and I got a lot more pleasant than I was expecting
[52:48.960 --> 52:49.680]  You know what I mean?
[52:49.680 --> 52:55.400]  I got more I got more nasty looking plants with more pleasant turps when I wanted
[52:55.840 --> 52:59.420]  Kind of the reverse of that you know what I'm saying. You know when I was looking for that so
[53:00.200 --> 53:08.280]  There are things like them like the mutant leaf gene and other types of recessive traits that don't come out and those first initial crosses
[53:08.640 --> 53:11.320]  You know what I mean, so by by
[53:12.320 --> 53:17.360]  Inbreeding them which I've done, you know what I mean and growing that that f2 generation or that next generation
[53:17.360 --> 53:22.520]  Hopefully I can unlock something in there and maybe maybe that smells in there and that in that group
[53:23.240 --> 53:26.360]  but I didn't find the smells in in
[53:27.600 --> 53:31.060]  prominence like I was I was hoping to see you know, I mean, so
[53:33.320 --> 53:36.040]  They're cool, they're special fucking special
[53:37.320 --> 53:38.560]  I
[53:38.560 --> 53:42.180]  Was shocked on the budworm thing like literally like I did this
[53:42.520 --> 53:48.360]  Specific type of things this year where I was doing different tests and I was shocked on the on the resistance factor
[53:48.360 --> 53:54.800]  You know what? I mean spider mites and thrips and different pressures that I see nearby in there
[53:55.760 --> 53:58.040]  in the original stock was like
[53:58.680 --> 54:01.600]  Fuck that, you know what? I mean ain't happening, you know, so
[54:02.280 --> 54:06.560]  The opposite with the fucking damn horn worms
[54:07.160 --> 54:09.160]  They were eating them
[54:09.800 --> 54:15.040]  the good ones the good girls alive now like that the
[54:15.760 --> 54:19.120]  Thrips I did not see them do a damn thing
[54:19.640 --> 54:24.120]  Spider mites were kind of attacking him, but they're really more attacking my hazes
[54:26.200 --> 54:30.160]  But yeah, I mean they're they're pretty hardy
[54:30.240 --> 54:32.240]  I
[54:32.440 --> 54:36.040]  Like to see what they could do like cross with some other
[54:36.840 --> 54:40.760]  Afghanica and see like how you can do basically
[54:42.120 --> 54:44.120]  Triangle down to
[54:44.200 --> 54:46.200]  something ideal as
[54:46.600 --> 54:53.960]  far as an indica goes because I honestly feel like you really only need to have a sativa and
[54:54.400 --> 55:00.880]  An indica and you don't need all these in-between hybrid you just need the ideal sativa the ideal
[55:01.760 --> 55:03.760]  like indica and
[55:04.520 --> 55:07.280]  and then simplify your whole
[55:08.760 --> 55:10.760]  operation
[55:11.320 --> 55:13.360]  Because that's kind of the way like
[55:14.520 --> 55:19.200]  normal everyday like apples oranges everything else goes
[55:20.080 --> 55:22.240]  you know, yeah tomatoes and
[55:24.480 --> 55:25.920]  Yeah, I think
[55:25.920 --> 55:33.160]  Afghanica and probably Colombian sativa is probably the horn of where you want to like
[55:33.160 --> 55:35.160]  How's he done?
[55:36.440 --> 55:38.440]  Skated I
[55:43.440 --> 55:45.440]  Think I just heard someone
[55:46.840 --> 55:48.840]  Chime in
[55:49.200 --> 55:51.920]  Yeah, I think mr. Cheese made a noise he went blank
[55:52.920 --> 55:54.920]  Oh
[55:55.200 --> 55:57.200]  Fight with somebody
[55:58.680 --> 56:00.360]  Well
[56:00.360 --> 56:02.440]  Yeah, what do you got there?
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.200]  Well, you know I was talking about that plant earlier
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.640]  This is the top of it
[56:11.280 --> 56:13.720]  The the bottoms, you know
[56:13.720 --> 56:14.280]  like I said
[56:14.280 --> 56:20.680]  I kept the tippy tops because these looked fine and I seeded this plant and I was wanting to kind of run through it and
[56:20.680 --> 56:27.480]  See like what went wrong and why the bottoms started ripening from the bottom up
[56:27.480 --> 56:30.160]  I think the bottom up it like
[56:31.200 --> 56:37.440]  It rotted but it wasn't like I dry farm. So it wasn't I had a microscope on it
[56:37.440 --> 56:43.640]  And it it didn't even happen just to me. There's a few other genetics from other breeders and that
[56:44.240 --> 56:47.000]  same things happened I ran pheno runs of
[56:47.480 --> 56:53.200]  Packs of seeds and you know, there would be like one or two phenos that just did that this year
[56:53.200 --> 56:56.360]  Like maybe it was the climate and maybe it was
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.960]  You know like those hundred degree days with the high humidity spikes and it just wasn't
[57:03.480 --> 57:05.840]  Bread for here, but um
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.640]  This was it has a really great structure. It was super sparkly
[57:13.320 --> 57:16.560]  Can't really pick it up. Here's another one. This is a
[57:17.280 --> 57:19.280]  UW University of Washington
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.880]  That's a you dub
[57:24.720 --> 57:26.720]  This is
[57:26.760 --> 57:29.920]  Lima Rilla from Brandon Russ and
[57:31.840 --> 57:38.360]  This is his black light and I ran a bunch of different things I
[57:40.040 --> 57:42.820]  Don't know I'm just looking for something unique, you know
[57:42.860 --> 57:48.980]  I spend about five thousand dollars a year and different packs of seeds and kind of sift through
[57:49.380 --> 57:52.420]  That's kind of my budget. So I mean I I
[57:53.020 --> 57:58.020]  Spend that I used to spend that in weed, you know before I was growing it
[57:58.020 --> 58:00.540]  So I figured that was my budget for weed
[58:01.140 --> 58:06.940]  You know, I spend like five six thousand dollars a year buying quarter pounds and half pounds and smoking them
[58:07.620 --> 58:13.980]  Ever since I was in high school, so I mean that's just kind of my budget and so now I'm like a seed fiend
[58:14.660 --> 58:17.460]  Like all I do is buy seeds. It's so hard
[58:17.460 --> 58:22.500]  I like gotta like check my bank account and be like can I afford this pack this week?
[58:22.500 --> 58:25.400]  You know like oh god stop doing that
[58:27.440 --> 58:33.140]  Yeah, mrs. Coastal's like pissed off every week cuz I'm like I gotta buy another back
[58:33.180 --> 58:39.980]  Gotta go buy another back like I'll show you right now like a small fraction of my fucking
[58:40.300 --> 58:45.260]  Seed collection, but yeah, I'm in the same damn place as you man
[58:45.260 --> 58:49.020]  It's just like if you couldn't see it you gonna buy it
[58:49.020 --> 58:56.260]  I I have weed from every continent on the planet and other than Antarctica
[58:57.540 --> 59:00.500]  And she's like what the hell are you fucking doing?
[59:01.180 --> 59:05.660]  I'm like you gotta have everything so you can make anything you want
[59:07.500 --> 59:09.780]  It's almost like an obsession I
[59:11.820 --> 59:16.780]  Really like this time of year because I get a test all my flavors and like smoke them
[59:16.780 --> 59:22.140]  however, I want to and all these different flavors and get these different notes and
[59:22.940 --> 59:29.740]  I'm really upset that I couldn't get the damn Pam Kandahar out in time like man those plants
[59:29.740 --> 59:35.100]  It wouldn't it may have been an ounce and I just like bigger plants, you know
[59:35.100 --> 59:37.980]  Like they at least got to be a quarter pound or something
[59:38.060 --> 59:43.300]  It's a good because by the time you figure out if you like it or not, you know
[59:43.300 --> 59:46.380]  Like cuz everybody's dipping into the cookie jar
[59:47.020 --> 59:54.740]  You know before it before it's ready before it's even you before you should even be smoking it. You're already smoking it
[59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.820]  You're like rolling it loose so you can fucking smoke it, you know
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.780]  And I'm like damn it and by the time you figure out if you really like it, you're like two ounces in
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.100]  So I'm like you got to grow enough of it, man
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.340]  You got one of them trim bags, is that what that is?
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.700]  There we go. I
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980]  Can hear you?
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.140]  nice
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:28.380]  The wife was yelling at me and then my ear food died and it was a whole
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:46.780]  I'm squishing some rosin right now on one of these just to pass some time in the background
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.260]  Nice, I put I
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.660]  put
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.540]  Three and a half grams in a let's see. What did I put it in?
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580]  120 micron bag
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.380]  187
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.060]  Almost three minutes
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:11.500]  And then I'm gonna pause it pause the sound so I can it's a mechanical I mean a yeah
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.300]  No, it's it's got it's got the so it's loud
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.820]  So I'll mute it. That's cool. I
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.820]  Like I like
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.140]  Sounds of silence. Yeah
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.180]  It's definitely different press in pure flour, you know what I mean and walk
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:39.660]  Doing the whole whole dance and then you know, there's all the other ways to just use the press is really cool
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.780]  You know the different product being made I
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.620]  think
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.180]  Under use, you know, it's dirty but
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:58.380]  Yeah, I've been making hash for 24 years and I still can't get like that like that hard press
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:03.100]  Stuff like to work for me. Like it's like magic
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:10.260]  I don't know what the hell people do but I just do butane extraction and I just stick with
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:18.140]  And dry sift and I just stick with what I know. I'll make like gummy hash by mixing it and whatever but
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.740]  Yeah, y'all that makes it that that that hard press fucking hash I
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:30.740]  More power to you. That shit is difficult as fuck to actually get it done, right?
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:38.620]  Well, were you showing London that was pretty good yeah, it's a
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.740]  Yeah, it's a little one
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.340]  That's a long one. Yeah, it's a nice one
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.380]  it's a
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.740]  Summer Ron Harrington stuff. He was on the show a little while ago. He stopped in as a visit
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:58.940]  It turned out really really nice. It's just guy. It's actually the first time I'm opening the jars
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.900]  I got really excited because you guys were like we were all showing the weed and stuff and smoking weed
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:10.100]  But I really excited ran over and grabbed my weed and I have six jars and I can only usually carry five
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.460]  comfortably, but I tried and
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.680]  I broke the last jar of weed and they're all
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.160]  Fucking hit the ground pretty hard. So I got a box of weed now, which is what's strange
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.480]  It was it was another one. It's a different
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.560]  It's kind of a mixed seed of my buddies
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.080]  And I've got some more of that which I watched your Facebook
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:41.920]  Live with him because uh, he yeah, he came on I was interested because he said he had some really old genetics
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.920]  and then I seen that he also was
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.880]  Crossing them with autos
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.880]  Yeah, yeah, he does. Well cuz he works in Canada, right? So it's like, oh, yeah
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:58.320]  Short term season. Yeah, but this stuff is like greasy as fuck. It's beautiful. It's a really nice plant
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.360]  Really really good. I got kind of a mixed bag of his stuff when I saw him I grow up
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.320]  And I've just kind of cracked it open. I have my lemon cush headband, which is just turned out beautifully
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.560]  I'm like, I've been opening up the jars and it's just like it's exactly what it's
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.920]  supposed to be
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.120]  Man I'm so excited to smoke. I'm really excited to press it in a rock
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.600]  they're just gonna get so good, but it's like that I'm giving them a little bit of a break and an open up today and
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.720]  Give me a second
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.720]  I'm gonna try not to break another fucking jar or get them filled with mold
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:51.040]  I'm breaking the jaws the worst. I've been doing it a lot recently. The bottoms have been breaking out of them
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.080]  London you are on to something with the rosin on this
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:14.300]  It's beautiful it smells amazing for the kinder hearts. Yes. It's very special. It's so nice
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.520]  The smoke is nice
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.520]  I
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.520]  Wish we lived closer I
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.840]  know I
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:38.000]  Really want to ship you some cuts and stuff, but I don't know if they would make it
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.660]  It'd be better to just ship you some seed Corey. Yep
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.960]  But I got I got some seed. I've been working on like some
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:53.480]  Some I don't know I think it's pretty nice. I haven't ran it yet, but I'm super stoked about
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.880]  Oh, yeah, I
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.880]  Think I agree with London
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:07.280]  I mean so many people have so much nice stuff to offer and I want to grow it all out and you know what I
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.680]  mean
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.680]  Keeping cuts is hard. Oh
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:19.420]  It's a bitch especially when you get your like testing out like a hundred at a time or so
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.340]  like
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:29.140]  You can't sit there and keep a hundred female plants like off to the side while you're still trying to play
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.980]  Basically flower the others I couldn't
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:40.000]  It becomes like unless you have like multiple the best ones always die
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.440]  Yeah, yeah like that I shit you not so I always make sure that I see the
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:54.480]  Motherfuckers that way I can get at least something from that even if it wasn't a good cross at least I still have
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.160]  those genetics somewhere
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.640]  No, I
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840]  I'm always just like
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.960]  The best ones die, you know, they don't you'll take like ten cuts
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.600]  None of the cuts work, you know
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:20.460]  The plant like ah shit man now what if it doesn't clone well and you take ten cuts and they don't live
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.120]  I mean, I don't even know if I want to keep a plant
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.840]  Guys were talking like that, you know that the weirdest plant that you guys had in the whole cross
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.680]  Was the sparkliest one and it was probably one of the dankest ones
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.480]  but do you do you want to work with that a lot of people don't and
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.120]  you know, it's gonna carry down the lineage as you
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.760]  progress if you did keep it, I mean, but it's
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:54.080]  So predominant, you know like the same thing your most
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.240]  intersexed
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.080]  Plants that ones that was just herm off the bat, you know, like those are some of the
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.480]  Sparkliest plants you'll ever see and you know, I don't know what sparkle is because I don't like
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:16.800]  I'm all about the high and not the sparkle, but it's great bag of pill, you know, and that's something that is
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.440]  Workable bag of pill. I mean you can always work on
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.720]  getting the
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.520]  Stoniness back into the genetics. It's getting that sparkliness out of its heart
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.740]  You know, it's that chem dominance that cam
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.440]  Dog dominance be it D or four or one
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:48.360]  But like it's that like it just draws people back and it always
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:56.040]  Hurts just no matter what six weeks. It's throwing a banana somewhere and you're not gonna see it and
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.600]  Yeah, it's part of life and you know, it's not even a big deal
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.560]  I think it's cool. Like someone was saying earlier like awesome
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560]  there's seeds and it's like that's the way I feel like
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.360]  You know what the more seeds better because now you can like make more
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.920]  Progeny from that and see what else you can get out of it and it's always just cool
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.760]  You know, like just worrying about the seeds and whether or not it seeds is kind of like silly
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:35.440]  I think because like people like us we're just sitting here like looking like at it like
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.700]  Well now I got a new opportunity to grow this out
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:48.180]  Okay, and so it's no longer a problem it's actually like a positive and
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:58.260]  So I just I honestly feel like it really is a good thing and I
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.580]  Really hope to just keep screwing with this stuff and see where it'll lead
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.540]  Because I think it's Oh
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.740]  Cory's got some stuff on screen. This is the
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:21.380]  That's the cool ranch that I was gonna say it like Stewie Griffin cool French
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.820]  What it does smell like
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.740]  Okay, so it turned into like a
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.140]  funky odd burnt orange
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.900]  But it's still got like a funny
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:45.700]  Vitamin kind of smell to it. Like I don't know. It's it's a it's a strange
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.620]  I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it is. It's
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.020]  smokes
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.860]  through on the joint
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:59.660]  I smoked a joint of it today and got some flavors that I never got out of it before
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.260]  So it's starting to you know mature and cure and do its thing
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:10.820]  No, it's it's it's fucking bomb weed it rips my face off I love it, you know, so
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:18.860]  Everything that I've grown of yours so far it guarantees I'm gonna get high, you know, I mean
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.420]  No question
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:27.140]  If I want it if I want to get a nice relaxed smoke going I could grab, you know this stuff
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.140]  I really yeah that that
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.140]  Yeah, that that
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.180]  Cup a couple of the Fino's of the of the Kenda ha
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.300]  Cross but that that cool ranch is that shit's awesome. I love it
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:45.660]  Dude, anything that smells like onions is a keeper
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:52.980]  Like I mean, I mean that you're easy, you know, I mean, they're just they were monsters. So yeah, awesome
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:57.340]  awesome stuff
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:03.000]  That's awesome dude, thank you for growing that that's cool those are nice little you man it's it's
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.140]  advertised
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.140]  100% grenades
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.040]  Yeah, no it it got I got
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.740]  17 plus ounces in a 4x4
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500]  So, yeah, I was killer
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.600]  Damn
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.080]  That's pretty good, dude. I mean
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.640]  Yeah, I mean especially for you you were saying with all the little problems you were having and like, you know
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.880]  And it's still it's not
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560]  Yeah
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.800]  That's killer man, and that's a killer plant cuz I've seen it and I was like dude Cory what the fuck is that man?
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.800]  like that is
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.520]  It's a cool ranch man from mr. D
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080]  Yeah
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.120]  Say it again, how does that smash that cool ranch? I don't know. Let's give it a run
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:19.120]  You have a rousing press and you haven't pressed everything you have already I've been going through hell
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.960]  It wasn't just you that I blew off. I blew off life dude. I wasn't feeling good now
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.200]  Catch up and you've been doing blowing off. Yeah
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.560]  It's not just you know, does your neck hurt? Yeah always I've had surgery
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560]  I
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.680]  Was only funny if nobody laughed why did you laugh it was like come on man
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.600]  You know, you're really serious for a minute. Like oh, that was a terribly unfunny joke London. Do you weigh your
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080]  Flower before you press it like you
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:12.200]  Think there's a dial on our thing on the thing that I use. Okay, so there's something that yeah
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.600]  Otherwise I would just like throw shit in there and make it happen man
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.240]  It's a lot of fun, dude
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.120]  It's a lot of fun you throw 14 grams in and you get a couple grams
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.880]  Oh, you get like a gram maybe two out and depending on what it is
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.200]  Yeah
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.720]  Yeah, and sometimes you gotta let shit rest out a little bit and they really change after some times
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.960]  That's kind of some fun fun part of it, too
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.400]  And then you see the whirly gigs right the whirly gigs is pretty cool. That's like I
[01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:49.430]  Always press my
[01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.070]  freezer
[01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:55.230]  It was go right in the freezer after after I press them out and then you know
[01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:58.830]  Usually it's too hot here. Like it's just too hot here and everything melts
[01:14:58.950 --> 01:15:04.870]  It's like I can't leave anything out like where you are. It doesn't matter you leave shit out this fucking refrigerator all the time
[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:24.630]  But you know, yeah, it's like my mouth so I have to go like immediately like into the freezer, you know what I mean?
[01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:29.710]  So I'm no master presser. I'm terrible, but I have a couple little presses that I use
[01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:35.550]  I'll smash like a quarter at a time, you know, seven grams eight grams, you know, ten grams at a time
[01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:41.030]  Unlike this on the rosin ear I have like a rosin ear and then I have like
[01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:45.630]  Fucking I don't even know the name of it. It's just old it works really good though
[01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:50.550]  But yeah, they smash about about 14 grams tops and you know
[01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:54.590]  You can you can smash it out. And once it all peels pours down and
[01:15:55.190 --> 01:16:00.590]  Take it out throw the pucks and aside and that they go right in the freezer and you can just stack them up like little
[01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.950]  You know little library just a little stack
[01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:07.430]  You can make a little mark on them and throw in the freezer and pull them out, you know
[01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.030]  Pull them out when you're hurting. That's what I use them for
[01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:18.790]  Do you keep them right on the parchment paper? Yeah, I don't put I don't put it in anything or nothing
[01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:22.630]  I mean, I probably should put it in like a plastic bag or something, but I don't I don't even do that
[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:25.550]  I just they're just folded already from being in the press
[01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.950]  You know
[01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:31.470]  I just I just take out the prying and put them back together and then put them up in a shelf of the
[01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:38.230]  You know in a little bin in the freezer, you know, and they're just they just hang out there for indefinitely
[01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.070]  Different way
[01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:48.910]  And I don't think it's better or anything but what I yeah, I don't know shit I guess this is what I do
[01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.750]  Yeah, yeah
[01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.790]  blindly in the blind but um
[01:16:54.110 --> 01:17:00.270]  like what I'll do is I'll fill a container up with almost freezing water and
[01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:06.750]  Then I'll do a BHL extraction with about like an ounce at a time
[01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:10.670]  and I'll use one to two cylinders of
[01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:12.750]  Of
[01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.390]  the B chain
[01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:19.470]  and I'll just use pure butane like that doesn't have any additives to it and
[01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:24.190]  I'll clean it out and just clean out the cylinder and then
[01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.750]  What I'll do is let that boil off
[01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:34.150]  And I try to do this stuff in the winter time like after harvest and stuff
[01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:40.310]  Because it's super cold outside in the colder. It is the slower it kind of like burns off
[01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.070]  and
[01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.550]  I've found it works pretty well
[01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.670]  The only problem is
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:55.030]  it's like very very very slow and
[01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:58.670]  Like if you're too quick with it
[01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:04.030]  You will find residual butane inside of the hash
[01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:06.150]  because
[01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:11.550]  It won't all burn off and like and just kind of boil off
[01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:20.070]  Like people I don't think I don't think I don't think it will ever I think unless you put it under vacuum and do it
[01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.070]  Do it the right way, you know
[01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:24.350]  Yeah, we're ever gonna be right, you know
[01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:29.590]  We got to get you pressing something, you know, so we don't have to worry about all that crap, you know
[01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:32.630]  It's better for you. Anyway, you know, we got smash yourself
[01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:35.390]  Yeah, get yourself a little Ros in the air
[01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:39.110]  Like they're 150 bucks. You can get the little small one
[01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:44.750]  you can smash an eighth at a time and you can just learn with that and it is the shit just to
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.430]  Cut out all that fucking
[01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:53.870]  Potential, you know, but there are some artists out there. That's how we all got here, you know, but yeah, definitely
[01:18:55.390 --> 01:19:00.110]  That shit scares me so oh, yeah, it's dangerous as shit
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:09.080]  What's that so what are the marbles do I always wonder like is that it's just gonna air right move around the stuff
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.800]  Is that all it does or is it do something other than move around the material?
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.740]  I don't give a fuck. It looks really cool
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.840]  No, I'm
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.720]  Wondering what they do
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:36.080]  Beautiful yeah, it does it has a little bit has a golden red sunburst on to it's got a good tone to it. I
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.120]  Like that
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:46.240]  Mix methodology, you know, I'm not this ain't regenerative. This ain't hydroponic. This is just what the fuck I feel like
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:53.760]  It's a beautiful plant man, it's a really nice grow it creams out real good the volume
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.360]  Capacity if you're liking them out that you get out of it is pretty good
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.720]  I let it air out for a few days after it gets pressed and it kind of like
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.920]  Split out if you leave it in kind of a warmer area and it's actually really nice
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.520]  if you
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:17.040]  The turn up right and some of that extra water will evaporate I'm trying to just get a nice
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.920]  Perfectly still like
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.360]  Stretchy it's got some it's got some good mass to it. It looks like
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.840]  Cream it's definitely
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:48.000]  It's really nice. Yeah, I've always wondered with the little stones or the balls the balls
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.040]  Explain the balls so the balls are supposed to stir it. Yes
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400]  That's what the function is
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:05.960]  Like I think about the balls that makes the even extra neat and I've got some cool ones too, which is actually really funky
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.720]  This second let me let me fix the lens here
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.880]  I'm an old-school pipe smokers joint smoker
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:20.240]  All these little moving whistles and parts they wouldn't they wouldn't last a day for me
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.240]  But I really like watching and seeing
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920]  You know that man
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.640]  You'd think that and I was exactly like you until like three months ago
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:37.080]  Well, I'll check back with you in about in about six months and we'll see if you're still doing it, you know
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.640]  I'm always come on strong, but I was on that you come up here for lift
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  That's good
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.840]  Everyone
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.440]  Let's just roll through real fast
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.800]  Because I think we're all about the same age
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.760]  What when did you start smoking?
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.520]  Like what year or what age age year whatever
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.840]  I
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:14.360]  Was about 15, you know when when the Mexican brick weed
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.800]  fell across my my my past
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:26.200]  You know about 15 and that was shit. I was I'm almost 40. So a long time ago
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:33.920]  Man, I was 15. I don't know what year that was hot man. Yes, it's a I'm terrible at that. Yeah, so I
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.640]  Was 12 it was 87
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.320]  so
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.400]  So I do have like the crazy swirler ones too. So I like
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.660]  Yeah, I mean like so I'm like the baby on here. I'm like 29 guys
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.560]  But I started smoking when I was when I was 13 and I've smoked every fucking day and made it a ritual except for one
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.200]  Time I was on probation and got drug tested
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:10.280]  Every month so I had to quit and that's when weed was legal here like it just went legal
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.280]  I'm sitting here on probation
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.120]  Week
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:26.920]  They had after I got injured they had me like where I couldn't smoke. I couldn't drink
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.320]  I couldn't do nothing and I'm like sitting there going insane
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:36.240]  And this is like the first time in 24 years. I can't fucking smoke weed
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.240]  Like I was like what the living hell am I going?
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:52.800]  Like no, you know, you shouldn't be smoking marijuana. I'm like, oh my god, you're calling it that like just okay, we're done
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.360]  That's when I decided I was leaving. But yeah
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.720]  It's been a crazy ass week for us
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.520]  present
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.240]  So those balls only spin when you oh, okay, so they spin when you're clearing the chamber they spend the whole time
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.920]  The whole time I guess
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.400]  So the bulls got a couple holes in it at point in the air in a certain direction
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.120]  So if you plug the top it sucks the holes through the air. So I've got one
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.680]  Suck them through the bottom called slurpers to I've got all sorts of fun one
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:34.920]  Her slurps. Oh, yeah, that's awesome and you're cold and you're cold starting and it looked like you were cold
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.920]  See, I know I know some stuff but I'm just trying to figure out what you're doing and what the hell I can ask somebody
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.760]  Some real questions. That's good. Yeah, so my what I've figured out is that I can smoke
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:59.580]  Like like usually I'd sit down and I smoke like a gram to a gram and a half at least in doobies or
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.600]  Pipes or bowls, you know what? I mean? Like how much you smoke in a city when you sit down and have a sesh
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.720]  And man, I'll smoke. I don't know an ounce an ounce a week. Maybe you know something like that
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.320]  Just to yourself
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.800]  Yeah somewhere around there maybe maybe maybe maybe half to an ounce on any given week depending on the season and what I got in
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.840]  The jars when I'm done. I smoke a lot. I smoke a lot of pipe holes and stuff
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.440]  so like tonight like I brought in like I didn't weigh it, but it was a
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.080]  You know, probably a two-gram nug and it's not here anymore. It's fine
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.080]  so I
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.440]  Wish I had another one, but that one's got so I'll get another one a little bit, you know
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.560]  so I smoke a lot of weed and I love man the flower is what really takes me to the to the
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.520]  To the good zone, you know
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.960]  Like the the dabs and the press in and stuff like it's all it's all really one-sided for me
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.760]  I really it doesn't last as long it tastes better
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.560]  It's amazingly clean and tastes delicious and I wish that you know, I could like capture that some way
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:11.640]  but it really it gives me more of a headache later on as opposed to like
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.800]  Really making me feel the way that I like to feel and then I always go back no matter if I take like two or
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.640]  Three dabs, right?
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.940]  I always go back and smoke a pipe hole or smoke and smoke a joint and like get my get a reset
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.100]  It's just my that's my habit. You know what I mean? So
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.560]  I'm a flower smoker for life, dude. I love flower. I love those those dirty flowers, you know, but
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.080]  But I you know, I have you know
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.280]  I've got lots of time with different extracts of all different shapes and colors
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.200]  but I come in the phases where I like them and I'll dab for a little while and I'll make a bunch of a
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.400]  Bunch of stuff and I'll use up some things and then yeah, I'll come back to my come back to the to the joint
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.720]  You know, I mean hang out there for a while
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:59.280]  you know, I smoke pipes in here because if I smoke a joint in here, I'll set off the fire of the smoke detector and
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.760]  That's a fucking whole nightmare to deal with so I
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.640]  Take a puff or two in there, you know, but I like smoking joints a lot
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.120]  Solution what you do is you take a
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.220]  Grocery bag you wrap it around
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.000]  Around the damn thing. I do that in hotels around the world. That's
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  Everywhere
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.320]  The or wherever the hell I can and yeah
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's easy as hell you just
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.600]  Wrap it up and then you'll just cut off all the damn smoke
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.400]  You know, I had one one time when I set off the smoke detector, you know
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.920]  and my other place and
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.920]  And it wouldn't shut off
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.080]  And I couldn't get it to shut off and I like wrapped it up and I wrapped it in blanket
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.720]  I wrapped it in towels or put a trash bag and put it underneath the shit. I couldn't get to shut off
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.720]  I couldn't do the kill switch and they take it outside and I had to fucking smash the thing after like wrestle with it for
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.360]  Like ten minutes and tossing a whole fucking stir, you know, it was like it was terrible. It was like
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.720]  Remember, it was like the middle of the night. It was a real it was it was some sort of real uncomfortable situation
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.000]  You know what? I mean where you didn't want that thing going off, you know
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.760]  So I always hear be always proactive, you know, no
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.480]  No, it was it it was another one of one of my old houses, you know when I was here
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.920]  It was close quarters with a lot of other, you know, a lot of other problems, you know, so I shit
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.200]  Yeah, it was that was a bad day, but I emptied a commercial building with a torch
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:58.120]  They told me it was disarmed but yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that's that's it sometimes you get enough, you know
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.640]  resurrected dead
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.240]  Everybody's outside looking at you, you know
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.640]  So getting back to it I would not advise my Fino to be pressed
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.840]  There you go, yeah the cool ranch the cool ranch the cool ranch but yeah
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.080]  This one here. I've been working on it it
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.040]  It's spread out. Yeah, you know what? I mean? So there you go
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.720]  Yeah
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.480]  You press it how much are you pressing in a bag? Ah 3.5
[01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.150]  All right
[01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:41.150]  different stuff, you know and
[01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:43.150]  You never know until you do it
[01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:48.830]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that I can't press like I press it and just it's too oily to pick up
[01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:54.870]  You know, I mean like I can't I can't get it cold enough. I can't you know, I mean, I mean I
[01:29:55.470 --> 01:30:00.870]  It's a little bit the consistency. Yeah, it's amazingly hard to work with. You know what I mean?
[01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:07.750]  But there's other stuff. It's just like a dream, you know, this is amazing, you know, how's this killer?
[01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:10.590]  You know, this Kenda are is nice. I mean, I haven't even
[01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:13.830]  Right out of the thing and you know, you know
[01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:20.110]  you know one that really fucking was was a killer one for me that the dog had for a while was the
[01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:26.190]  Green eggs and ham. That was the pan 15 to the Santa's cookies. I have and
[01:30:26.670 --> 01:30:32.790]  Yeah, that one that one was a down the resin just like shook off of all those butts like you would touch it
[01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:37.670]  You would break it up and like there'd be a pile of fucking golden resin just on the table underneath of it
[01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:43.830]  Like it was like it was a dropper it it it pressed out really nice stuff it it washed really nice
[01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:49.230]  It had some cool, you know, that was a good hashing. I was I was stoked on that one. That was a good one that pressed
[01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:54.470]  Surprised me on the on how much better it did than a lot of other things and that's it
[01:30:54.590 --> 01:31:00.030]  That's got a menthol thing going right or a sour yeah, it's like yeah, it's very
[01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:04.830]  That's what that's kind of. Yeah, it's the description of the sour cream and and
[01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:08.950]  sour cream and menthol or a sour cream and a pine forest
[01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:11.910]  that's like
[01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:15.230]  It's kind of like breakfast herps I like to call them
[01:31:15.230 --> 01:31:21.110]  They're like very kind of like kind of like eggs and bacon kind of tones to it. Like just very kind of
[01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:23.550]  Like Teresa
[01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:29.710]  Yeah, it's kind of like a yeah, it's kind of like some breakfast type there
[01:31:29.710 --> 01:31:36.770]  But there was a heavy mint influence like a heavy menthol North American breakfast like a traditional North American breakfast. Are we like?
[01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:47.270]  It's a lumberjack no, we do not we do not have these on the plate on this one
[01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:53.350]  It would be like like more like an eggs and bacon and and a French toast type smell
[01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:57.630]  Like a Denny's probably more towards. Yeah
[01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:02.110]  Yeah more like a Denny's but like with some cream
[01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:07.870]  You know like a creamy like a creaminess to the Denny's like you're eating sour cream at Denny's right on something
[01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:10.790]  something rich, you know like
[01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:13.950]  It's it's definitely an interesting but it has a lot of like
[01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:17.870]  Our cream on you while you're driving by Denny's
[01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:30.750]  Cream it's got this sour note to it. It's got this like it's got a sour note to it
[01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:35.390]  But yeah, a real rich pineness to it. You know, it's like this really good. It's it's interesting
[01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:37.630]  it's a real it's a real complex kind of a
[01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:39.790]  If the flavor
[01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:46.510]  Takes off your greatest animation will be a guy driving into a Denny's with a tub of cream
[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:57.670]  Exactly so like some ganja gets this like onion II like sour creamy like
[01:32:57.950 --> 01:33:02.310]  Sent to it, but it's also got this woodiness to it
[01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:10.470]  And I think what he's talking about is like that kind of like just like off smell like the
[01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:13.350]  greenhouse had a train called
[01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:19.270]  What was it called Hawaiian snow and it was just totally
[01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:25.590]  onion II but like woody and hazy and we're just like dank as hell and
[01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:31.070]  I think that's where he's leaning towards it almost it probably almost smells like
[01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:35.230]  Differential fluid
[01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:38.630]  All right, if anyone knows what that smells like
[01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:41.390]  Yeah
[01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:43.430]  Bullshit
[01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:45.030]  Yeah, it's got a lot of that
[01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:50.430]  But then you got you got a pine you got a pine background like a pine exhale and a pine finest
[01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:52.430]  It was just really cool
[01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:55.190]  Yeah, yep kind of a cool one
[01:33:55.350 --> 01:34:02.470]  But yeah, that's exactly kind of the and that hazy type turps that that stuff comes right from that 15 that pan 15
[01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.470]  You know, and that's that that that
[01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:07.830]  That's funky like cheesy
[01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:10.190]  incense
[01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:16.950]  Hazy type, you know is the kick-ass we go about is it strong shit? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:18.310]  You got some strength in there
[01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:21.710]  You got strength you got strength and you got you know, cuz you got some modern stuff
[01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:28.470]  You got some of the like it's got that old Christmas bud, you know that that 79 old school shit, you know that piney stuff
[01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:33.150]  It's got the forum cookie in there. You know what I mean? And then it's got the Pam 15 in there
[01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:36.870]  you know what I mean, um drunk ass weed or and and
[01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:44.710]  Yeah, yeah somewhere at least at least those three right there, you know, I mean off-hand for that one and that's a good that's
[01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:46.910]  That's it. That's a winning combination. Yep
[01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:49.990]  for sure, so
[01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:53.550]  Sounded good and always buy man. I was excited
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.020]  No, but thank you guys for growing those up
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:08.260]  Those candy hearts and you know wasting your space and your time and you know
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.300]  Showing up talking about it. That's what I'm cool, bro
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.620]  Yeah, we'll do something
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:23.060]  coming up
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.060]  Years
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:32.660]  It's something we'll do some face mountain stuff coming up, you know, so we can all be like, oh my god
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:37.260]  I got this thing that you know, I killed my grandma to keep around, you know
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:40.180]  I mean, so we'll get some of that stuff coming for you. Yeah
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:42.780]  some gas
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.260]  Well
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.260]  Oh
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:57.380]  Yeah, I started showing off some of the harvest
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:08.540]  Trying to get up brooking back
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.540]  Oh
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:29.980]  Okay, I do not know how to manipulate the camera so here we got
[01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:39.410]  Some haze original haze
[01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:45.930]  All right, this is one of the first polls and that's been dry for about a week
[01:36:47.530 --> 01:36:49.530]  We just pulled the day
[01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:52.090]  He's an OG kush
[01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:54.730]  like an heirloom OG kush
[01:36:55.850 --> 01:37:03.450]  and that was revenge and so we got that drying now and
[01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:06.130]  then
[01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:08.130]  you see
[01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:10.930]  The K of ours are the last
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.420]  This is one of them
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.380]  Oh
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.380]  Right
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:46.600]  Here's the other
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:52.600]  Yeah, now the trim work begins, you know, that's the he my loathing part, you know
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.760]  Yeah, one time begins
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  That's
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.920]  Three more haze is going
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.880]  Original haze is they'll probably go until December and
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:16.520]  Yeah, they're already at like over a pound of seeds, so that's kind of neat but
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.320]  It's scary because that hit the um
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:26.200]  It is a real problem out here on the case
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.160]  and
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.360]  It loves to eat up these plants. It doesn't even matter if it's a sativa
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.140]  like typically a sativa can like
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.800]  fight a pantheon but
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:43.280]  Out here. It is just brutal
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.640]  so
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.320]  We're just hoping to get through December and then be done with it and then start our
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.720]  Indoor grow which we have like an indoor setup
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.760]  Before when we and the terminate the other ones
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.720]  Yeah, we got like a nice little four by eight
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.720]  And
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760]  Yeah
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.760]  Pretty simple setup, but
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:29.240]  We're just doing what we can with with well with with all the damn mold and everything else
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.240]  I mean the mold out here is insane
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.400]  The humidity levels about 60 to 70 percent of every given permit so
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:44.320]  We're just you know fighting against the tide, but no it's hard man. It's hard to go outside
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.640]  No, so it will grow outside those those farmers
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.880]  Salutes because they pull off some shit, you know
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.440]  No joke. There's there's stuff out there way out of your control. You know what I mean gotta be
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:04.160]  You know, you gotta be ready to go, you know, so I want to play but man that looks like a lot of work
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:12.160]  Everywhere is different. Yeah, and everywhere is different, you know, you can you can have a set of skills somewhere and now you're no skills anywhere else and there's humidity and
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:21.280]  Drought and shitty soil and fucking bugs and fucking diseases and weird situations. It's like yeah, it's thieves
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Yeah, yeah, they're sharing this shit out there somebody's gonna be like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.400]  I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna be like, oh, yeah
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.400]  Yeah, they're sharing this shit out there somebody's don't worry about
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.840]  It's way
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.600]  Leafy or weed and it's a lot of fucking work
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.760]  Well, not always not always that's that's different that that I can I can I can I can
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.120]  Share with you a few gems. It'll blow your mind. You know what I mean? That would would pass for
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.160]  That would pass for indoor or high quality any day of the week, you know what I mean?
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.800]  When you're on right right when you patient when you pick leaves, you know, like yeah
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.480]  You're gonna have more mass know Matt. No. Yeah. Yeah for sure. You got more
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.480]  I
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  Spend in a whole day picking one way if you got you got him in the ground or nice. Oh, yeah
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:32.360]  Fuck. Yeah, you are, you know, you making some compost your penis worms
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.520]  Goes on, you know here your counter for magic whatever you're doing, you know
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.400]  Yeah
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.720]  You'll have definitely more of that shit but like leaf to bud ratio and and like the way that they
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.400]  Flowers, yeah, you can have you can have some pretty flowers that are just like a snip snip, you know
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.160]  The one the one is a good one to trim up 15. Yeah
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.920]  Yeah
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.920]  15 I don't even bother trimming half the time, you know, I cut off the big leaves
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:19.080]  But the 15 throws resin out on all the and all those leaves. So those leaves are really
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.840]  You know, they're valuable in a lot of ways. So there it's a good it's a good presser and a good washer for that
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:31.360]  But I like it at the 15. It'll definitely give you more of that raw look, but the one is like
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.040]  Real pretty, you know
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520]  Pretty in this
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:43.840]  She looks good in the jar good job. I'm looking forward to having some good some good Pam in the jar some fresh Pam in
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840]  the jar, you know
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:51.160]  Coming up. So you get that pretty soon. We'll be at that that one of the one of the
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.680]  the sessions the FCP sessions, you know, so
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.400]  Never know if you're in ever in LA they have this
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.000]  You know, I can't even fucking say it man, it's
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:12.520]  But yeah, you know people bring their their stuff and it's cool because it happens a lot
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:18.340]  So, you know, you get to see different things from different times and different different thing, you know different shows
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:26.240]  I think events are so cool to get together with people and it's it's it's a magical. Yep. That's cool
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:35.750]  I'm trying to see if I can load some of my photos from my outdoor harvest hanging and I'm gonna go bug it
[01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:40.110]  But if life doesn't fuck around with the internet
[01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:43.230]  I might be able to
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:48.900]  Don't worry just enjoy the process
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.860]  Of watching a load bar
[01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:06.790]  So, mr. Trees
[01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:13.270]  Out of curiosity. I'm not familiar with the dog Walker. What is the cowboy caviar?
[01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:22.470]  Yeah, I think I got an idea but what's that what's the dog dog Walker is chem for to an OG
[01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:26.230]  It's chem for to Albert OG our Albert Walker OG
[01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:33.870]  I've never seen the Albert Walker OG, but if it's an OG then it's you know, it's it's it's like it's like an OG
[01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:41.830]  But really it's it's the chem for side of it that shines through in the dog Walker and it's a very it's a very chem
[01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:44.150]  Chem plans got a lot of like
[01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.310]  the raw fuel the nastiness
[01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:56.630]  The resin content like a like a killer chem 91 or the chem D that type of that that type of resin
[01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:59.190]  It's got this beautiful
[01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:02.670]  Rich
[01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:04.630]  Gassy
[01:45:04.630 --> 01:45:06.350]  You know
[01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:12.950]  Delicious flavor. It's musty. It's a shorter swattier plant more of it like an indica looking type frame
[01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:18.750]  You know shorter squatty a little bit more branchiness has killer friggin big outside
[01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:22.850]  It's got it's not big leaves. It's got you know, I'd say
[01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:27.950]  Indoors, it's got smaller leaves than most it's got
[01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:30.790]  smaller more more dainty
[01:45:32.670 --> 01:45:34.670]  I can post up a couple of pictures
[01:45:36.150 --> 01:45:38.830]  See it, you know these things I mean
[01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:46.030]  Outdoors it has it'll put on a regular size leaf, but it's not known for its leaf size by any means, you know
[01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:48.030]  But yeah, yeah
[01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:49.390]  Yeah
[01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:52.270]  What is that? Is that the cowboy caviar or is it something different?
[01:45:55.590 --> 01:46:01.550]  Yeah, there you go, there you go, so they'll be more short and squatty like I said, it was short and squatty
[01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:05.710]  That's that really dog Walker esque thing is gonna dominate through
[01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:10.190]  But the weed on those things are gonna be fucking ferocious, you know
[01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:14.990]  Did the it's gonna be ferocious. It's gonna be stinky. It's gonna be good
[01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:17.670]  It's gonna be ferocious in some way or shape or form, you know
[01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:25.770]  Sometimes when you cross like when you cross the pan with the dog Walker or you cross the pan with the SFE
[01:46:26.190 --> 01:46:28.790]  sometimes we get a lot of those other pan traits in there and
[01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:34.590]  It's not as it's not as gassy and it's not as it's not as dominant towards that side
[01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:38.370]  But because there's such fucking like commando
[01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:40.510]  powerful
[01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:44.150]  You know offensive fuel type, you know plants
[01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:48.990]  And it's a reversal. So it's those exact profiles and on each other, you know
[01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:52.570]  You're gonna get a lot a lot more of that present. So
[01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:57.790]  Yeah, those look good. Those look like they look like they're supposed to they're more short and spotty
[01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:00.790]  Definitely top them so you can get some branching to come out
[01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:09.190]  Yep, yeah get them get them to start branching out because they'll be more don't need more compact, you know
[01:47:10.150 --> 01:47:14.950]  But the big leaves are just they're just they're just trying to soak up a lot of light, you know, you're feeding them good
[01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:17.750]  They're growing fast. You know, they're going fast. That's cool. That's
[01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:20.670]  Well, you're doing well with this
[01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:22.750]  so
[01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:24.750]  Yeah, I'm excited. Those are
[01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:30.470]  Something I can like I said, there's something that I'm gonna remake and you know, keep around and have I think that's gonna be a good
[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:37.470]  That's gonna be a good state, you know good staple for you want some strong power fuel?
[01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:43.390]  You know in your in your in your jar. It's what I'm fighting a boat right now
[01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.310]  Yeah, definitely out of everything that I you know
[01:47:47.710 --> 01:47:50.630]  Yeah, those and the lifeguards are really cool
[01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:57.430]  You get a lot of Pam influence in the lifeguard and that's the lifeguard sfp one and that's you get those tools and those nasty
[01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.550]  Searing qualities and it's like super good
[01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:05.110]  But those will be taller plants and even in the seedling stage you see the Pam how it stretches out the frame
[01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:11.190]  But because the dog walkers used in that one and and she she keeps those she keeps them a little bit more
[01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:13.870]  You know squat and taught, you know, so
[01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:18.530]  That's cool. It's cool to see him like that rock and roll. Yeah, we're going to do those
[01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:25.230]  I want to do what to do those that's happening. I'll get you guys some of those, you know
[01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:31.520]  I know
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:39.440]  And if you want to see the p1 the Kandahar like pure picture I put a picture of that up or something outside
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.720]  So I'm hygiene so you can
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.280]  Just see what one of them looks like. Oh, yeah, it's a big thick
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:52.520]  Running Cola's the classic Indica looking plant, you know, I mean really short really short and stout
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.640]  So I forgot they were even you know doing what they're doing. They're so tough. They really are
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:09.640]  Okay, I tried to get the fucking actual photos but I couldn't get the actual photos so this sucks
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.040]  But we almost got the actual photos
[01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:18.410]  Apparently I can't use this stuff today
[01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:21.610]  boom
[01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:23.970]  So that's
[01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:26.530]  It's guy
[01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:39.090]  That's me fucking with the visible spectrum that you can see there I want to try and zoom it in more but it won't let me
[01:49:40.810 --> 01:49:42.810]  Dutch passion photo
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.760]  You lost you got yeah a real nice plan beautiful
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.640]  Very pretty purple nice rails down the leaves
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.720]  This is a you're on mute. Mr. Treece
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.320]  Yeah, thank you
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.720]  It's that it's that big old mug it's showing up again
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:18.300]  That looks great man. Yeah, I love the rails on there. Yeah. I love I love the rails
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:24.360]  The pretty plant yeah, it's a beautiful it's a beautiful specimen that one is
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.760]  Very old well, you're doing well for so far up north out there, you know, I mean, that's great. Yeah excellent beautiful work
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  I'm great
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  Okay, it's becoming late
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.010]  Yes, sir. Yes, my wife
[01:50:42.970 --> 01:50:44.970]  Loves me. Oh, yeah
[01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:48.090]  And that could go either way
[01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:50.810]  It's gonna go one way or worse one way
[01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:58.330]  You understand
[01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:03.930]  A couple more kids there you'll be
[01:51:05.130 --> 01:51:08.010]  Show you my last of my cool stuff. So I got some of the
[01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:10.810]  Fuck you can't see shit on this
[01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:13.690]  It's a nice
[01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:16.570]  Fuck you can't see shit on this
[01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:20.010]  You know what? I can do I probably
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:30.020]  Because I was showing this earlier but you guys were like deep in it so I didn't want to interrupt
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.740]  Oh, yes, I enjoyed it
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.620]  and then so I got
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:40.500]  All right, so that's a cat this is actually the
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:43.460]  red lebanese
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.100]  Okay, yeah, that looks good
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.820]  Looks like those fat leaves from the hash
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:55.300]  All these other plants have been planted at the same time and i've literally cut some of them in half
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:59.620]  How tall this one is, okay, so
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:03.700]  It's a plant that came out before it was
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:07.380]  Somewhere over there somewhere but check this out. So I did
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.900]  So like these plants were getting way tall
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.780]  And they have a very hollow stem
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.020]  So I like cut a little v in there and I've bandaged it up for a little bit
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:20.740]  How long do you think I should leave that on before I can pull it off?
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:25.300]  I don't know as long as you can, you know, um, yeah
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.420]  It's it takes several months for some things to heal over it takes several weeks for other things
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:38.180]  But it's gonna bear weight right in that spot. So I would just keep it there. I just would say fuck it and just
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.660]  Keep it until you start to see it start to gorge over
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.260]  Yeah, yeah until you start seeing a problem happening. Yeah
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.060]  but it probably won't like
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.180]  It probably won't get too crazy because now it's weak in there
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:58.900]  It's those regenerative farmers genetics, man. I got the fucking stuff from dragonfly earth medicine
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:01.780]  uh, and these beans
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:03.860]  Awesome
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:10.980]  They they just they're they're they're aggressively fucking like here. Just let me show you the top that I cut off of one of these plants
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:17.140]  Man red lebanese is one of my favorite plants, you know, and I
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:23.640]  Saw that's exactly what it was. I mean it has that leathery look that predominant
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.580]  uh
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:34.680]  You know seriation and leaves I mean it's it's a it's a really nice plant man. I put a plan out of red lebanese
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:36.020]  uh
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:40.500]  You know kind of like I do every year. I'll put a plan out late in season
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.580]  Give it like a month to grow and see what it's made of, you know
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:47.300]  And it performed well
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.340]  It's one of my my favorite
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.180]  Hell, yeah
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:58.180]  It's funny that nick brought up red lebanese and I like I literally have some blonde
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.220]  Lebanese hash in my hand right now
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.780]  That's cool
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:08.100]  That's that's that's the top huh, that's cool. Oh, yeah
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:11.300]  Old school stuff you're keeping it
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:20.260]  And they always have this smell. Do you have any that have this like fiery smell just like from a simple
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.420]  Stem rub
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:28.180]  Oh, yeah, i've got like an array of stuff so i've got like stuff from dragonfly in here
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.780]  That's like short stubby and fat and I got stuff from dragonfly in here
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:36.100]  That's like big tall steve like look at the size of those leaves, man
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.820]  On the red lebanese though, do you have some that's just like that's no clear bro. That's a tree
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.940]  And she's like happy that's awesome
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:53.860]  She's like i'm pulling a mr. Trees right now i'm i'm just got her in the water. Look at me go
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:59.140]  Like there you go. I'm gonna check back in a month with this shirt gonna be like check it out. I'm mr. Trees
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.260]  Fuck I gotta get a hat now. I gotta get a cool hat
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:09.460]  Yeah, by then they always have that mango freaking doing right? No, they always got that mango
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.140]  enos
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.140]  at that age
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:22.100]  It's it's crazy like I I just don't know why but yeah eastern european plants tend to have like a mango
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.300]  scent to them
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:27.540]  I don't know if anyone else has seen that but
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.940]  That's what I'm
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:39.060]  So what did so we're all in other words incredibly impressed with mr. Tree's amazing genetics. Yes
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:42.420]  Yeah, clearly yes
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.880]  We grow more of mr. Tree's genetics
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.660]  It's all I do
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.660]  It's happening
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.620]  That's not
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.420]  Yeah
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:59.780]  More gear. Yes. I need some more gear. I'll send you some my gear. I got a bunch of stuff that I just ran
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:00.900]  You know
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:02.900]  Yeah, man, we'll trade that'd be cool
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:04.500]  Yeah
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:08.820]  Now we'll uh, we'll work on some good stuff. Corey's got a good jump on those those cowboys
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:12.020]  I think those are up on daga too. A few of those are up there
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:16.820]  Have you tried any of the uh, have you tried any of the skunk one stuff from todd mccormick?
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:25.780]  I haven't grown any of those out yet. No, no, um next time I I have I mean i'm interested to see you know
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:30.980]  I'm looking for somebody who you know who I trust as a grower to
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:35.700]  Just show me a batch or two of something that they if they found out of there that they like
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.820]  I want to see something out of there, but I am interested
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:43.700]  I'll have a bunch to show you at some point. I got like I got a dozen
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:47.220]  So I got a buddy that just took it took it took a round of it and selfed it
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:50.740]  And then just grabbed like a little four five mili bottle
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:56.900]  And filled three of them up and just handed them to me and then like the little baggies like here's some more
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:00.180]  I'm like, oh fuck it. I got a lot. Yeah. Hell. Yeah. Yeah. Hell. Yeah
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:02.820]  No, I've read a book
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.620]  I've read a bunch of skunks and
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:09.540]  Man, I really thought that's what I was looking for
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.740]  And then I found out that I don't like skunk at all
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:16.580]  You know what i'm saying like
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.580]  I was like so totally like hyped. I bought like that's it
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.540]  almost every skunk you could think of and I was just like, you know, this is like
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:31.700]  It's cool, but it's just not what I don't think I and I just don't care for it
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.440]  Like I've realized that I really care for like the ogs
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:42.500]  Like that's totally different, you know, like I really I was like skunk skunk skunk and then it was like man, that's not really
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:44.660]  What i'm looking for at all
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.380]  And then like yeah
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.460]  So I got some uh
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:55.700]  Some og 18 by reserve privada and you know a lot of people bred those
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:01.140]  The og kush breasts and stuff and like, uh
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:06.180]  I can see why they came from that. So like where's the
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.620]  original ogs at like those were like the
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:12.420]  You know top notch
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:20.260]  Shit, I think I like I like skunk too, but it's not what I was thinking it was and it's not what I was after
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:23.380]  I I come to realize that after I ran like
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.540]  I don't know
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.540]  20 different variations of skunk
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:31.620]  Here's the question man, yeah, do you think you'll ever find what you're after?
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:35.140]  Yes
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.140]  I think i'll have to breed it though
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:39.300]  Just like just like mr
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:45.460]  Trees, you know, he's over there and he's got he's got himself a little library that he knows what he likes
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:47.780]  He's just trying to make it come to life
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.740]  Oh, yeah
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:56.660]  You know, sometimes i'm like sometimes i'm like oh man this I mean these plants have it all you know
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:00.580]  and it's like sometimes we're like well, maybe we can fill with this and
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:04.900]  Make it different and yeah, that's a good question. London. I mean that's hard to
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:10.420]  that's hard to know if you'll if i'll ever if i'll ever find what what i'm looking for, you know, because
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.700]  I think I think i've you know
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:20.340]  I've seen I don't know. I'm, you know, I haven't met a breeder yet. That's been like i'll find it one day
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.620]  I'll be done my work. I don't think there is a perfect plan
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.820]  I think there's there's a lot of perfect plants, you know what I mean?
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:31.620]  And you've got to have you've got to have them all and there's no such thing as one that has everything that you want
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:32.660]  it's just
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:35.700]  Because there's always something on the other side. There's always grasses greener
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.740]  You know no matter what so you've got to have lots of different types of throws that are all good plants
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:45.300]  I think good plants are ones that the jar empties first and fast
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:50.100]  And it wasn't a complete bitch to grow so you could get it to the jar
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:53.300]  Like if it's a complete bitch to grow and you can't get it to the jar
[01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:57.780]  I don't give a fuck how fire it is. It's like you can't get to the jar, you know, I mean, it's a fucking bitch
[01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.620]  you know, so
[01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:02.900]  Uh, it's gotta you know, it's got to be fairly easy to get into the jar
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:07.060]  But once it's in the jar, it's got to go it can't just be like whatever you know what I mean?
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:10.660]  So that's like the quest like, you know, you need lots of plants to do that
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:14.100]  Yeah, exactly. It has to be
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:16.420]  Turnoverable
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:18.500]  It has to be turnoverable
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.540]  and the other thing is it's like
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.260]  It has to be marketable
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:25.700]  um
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:29.940]  you have to look at these factors when you're looking at it and
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:33.860]  Otherwise, you're just pissing away your fucking time
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:39.460]  I mean and that's just honesty and and I know it seemed harsh
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:42.260]  But it's reality
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:45.800]  And it's what each of you are basically
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:51.220]  kind of hinting on but all basically honing on
[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:54.020]  is
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.020]  You have to not be
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.580]  pissing away
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:00.020]  the time
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:02.020]  with the product
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:03.940]  Um
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.500]  That won't actually turn over
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:11.380]  And unfortunately, there's a lot of folks that are starting to do that now
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:16.260]  And they think that the run skittles yada yada yada
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.860]  Cross is gonna do it and it didn't
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.580]  and um
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:31.540]  I think the market is finally starting to take a turn and and going away from
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:34.660]  Uh
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.540]  I guess the fake marketing and people are starting to look towards
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.580]  Good like wholesome
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.660]  uh
[02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:46.100]  brands
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.020]  and so
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:50.760]  I don't see this this whole situation
[02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:58.660]  Going in in favor of these folks who are trying to take advantage of everyone else
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.540]  in the cannabis market because
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:06.580]  I think the consumers have become a lot more
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.960]  uh
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:12.160]  Educated. Yes. Yes. Thank you so much
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.320]  And and it's like you can't pretend like they're idiots
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.240]  anymore
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.240]  and so like
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.240]  It's not going to happen
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:25.120]  Like we're we're moving forward
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:31.920]  So I guess that that's the the sum of what I I guess I had to say
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.400]  It's just like
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.800]  We we all have as a community
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:43.040]  Move forward and we're not gonna put up with people trying to take advantage of us
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:49.940]  I hope so
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:55.540]  I mean, I I really hope people are learning, you know and taking the time to learn and
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:58.740]  understand that the products that they get
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.460]  in the end market
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:03.940]  Is uh at a medical
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:07.460]  Grade for them, you know because this is a medical product
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.460]  I mean, I know people do it rec and everything else but
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:15.940]  In the end, it's just like every other herb that you buy on the shelf
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:19.380]  you know thyme and rosemary and
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:25.300]  You know the stuff that you get in that pack pre-packaged stuff is so subpar
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:28.500]  Compared to that stuff that you get at the farmer's market
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:31.540]  Know your farmer
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:33.940]  You know and uh
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.060]  Hopefully, you know that craft will
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.940]  Will eventually pay off?
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:41.460]  because you know
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:44.260]  Um, i'm not into that big corporation thing
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.100]  it
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:49.460]  You know green like those hothouse tomatoes taste like shit
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:52.180]  That's why I grow my own
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:53.140]  you know
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.020]  uh
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.940]  Same thing with the weed
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:57.940]  I encourage everybody to grow their own
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:01.220]  Yep
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.220]  It's the only way we just gotta grow it out
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.100]  And you know a little live
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:11.700]  And share it with everyone and share it. Yeah. Yeah
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:20.980]  Cool i'm gonna go before the wife kills me. Thank you guys. This has been a wonderful
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.980]  Today's from uh
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:34.920]  Great we love thank you guys guys big time
