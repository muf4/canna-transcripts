[00:13.950 --> 00:16.510]  You know, we're talking about more of the coveted,
[00:16.510 --> 00:18.150]  the top shelf right now.
[00:18.150 --> 00:21.430]  And obviously, thousands of different cultivars
[00:21.430 --> 00:24.070]  and strains and substrains and cross-breds
[00:24.070 --> 00:26.130]  and back-breds and all the rest of it.
[00:26.130 --> 00:27.070]  How do you determine?
[00:27.070 --> 00:27.910]  Like, how do you know?
[00:27.910 --> 00:31.510]  I mean, we know some trendy ones like Gorilla Glue blew up
[00:31.510 --> 00:36.270]  and Bubba97 and Blue Skittles we were just talking about
[00:36.270 --> 00:39.410]  or even some of the more modern cushes.
[00:39.410 --> 00:41.470]  But is there a way for you to kind of get feedback
[00:41.470 --> 00:43.350]  from the open market to go,
[00:43.350 --> 00:45.510]  hey, maybe I should do something that's a bit of a,
[00:45.510 --> 00:49.030]  maybe a retro Acapulco Gold crossed with Northern Lights.
[00:49.030 --> 00:49.870]  Yeah.
[00:49.870 --> 00:50.690]  You know?
[00:50.690 --> 00:51.790]  There's a company called Seed Junkie,
[00:51.790 --> 00:53.370]  but there are seed junkies out there.
[00:53.370 --> 00:55.870]  There is a whole phenomena of people
[00:55.870 --> 00:57.550]  that are paying attention to the breeders
[00:57.550 --> 00:59.410]  that are coming out with the new stuff.
[00:59.410 --> 01:00.870]  And we're, you know, we're seeing trends,
[01:00.870 --> 01:03.310]  you know, OGs for a long time.
[01:03.310 --> 01:05.610]  Then it was everything with cookies.
[01:05.610 --> 01:08.150]  And now like Purple Punch came on the market.
[01:08.150 --> 01:09.510]  Now I'm seeing all these things
[01:09.510 --> 01:11.390]  that are crossed with Purple Punch.
[01:11.390 --> 01:13.330]  So I think it's just always gonna be an evolving thing.
[01:14.170 --> 01:15.650]  And then how do you know that's gonna hit
[01:15.650 --> 01:17.490]  or gonna become a hit?
[01:17.490 --> 01:18.970]  Is I think it boils down to,
[01:18.970 --> 01:21.130]  well A, the quality of the genetics,
[01:21.130 --> 01:24.130]  and then, you know, B is marketing and market outreach,
[01:24.130 --> 01:28.090]  you know, get someone that's well known to hype it up
[01:28.090 --> 01:30.110]  and, you know, really covet that
[01:30.110 --> 01:31.890]  or win a cup with that stream.
[01:32.770 --> 01:36.050]  But that's kind of another artistry and beauty
[01:36.050 --> 01:39.330]  in growing cannabis is that the sky's the limit.
[01:39.330 --> 01:42.290]  And, you know, we're just getting into breeding
[01:42.290 --> 01:45.170]  on my farms and trying to do some selections.
[01:45.170 --> 01:47.570]  And I mean, that is all, that's a lot of work.
[01:47.570 --> 01:48.830]  It doesn't take much space.
[01:48.830 --> 01:51.610]  It's really high volume production
[01:51.610 --> 01:54.770]  and low square footage or small square footage.
[01:54.770 --> 01:56.450]  So it's attractive in that regard.
[01:56.450 --> 01:58.530]  And it's always attractive to make something new
[01:58.530 --> 01:59.770]  and exciting.
[01:59.770 --> 02:03.250]  So I think once we get all our operations in place
[02:03.250 --> 02:04.810]  that that's gonna be the next fun thing
[02:04.810 --> 02:08.290]  is to focus on breeding and work with other breeders
[02:08.290 --> 02:11.010]  that are, and then using their material.
[02:11.010 --> 02:13.770]  Someone like Kevin is like super into that, Kevin Jodry.
[02:13.770 --> 02:14.610]  I love it.
[02:14.610 --> 02:15.450]  He geeks out on that stuff.
[02:15.450 --> 02:17.690]  You know, it's, it almost takes over the passion
[02:17.690 --> 02:19.090]  from growing the plant.
[02:19.090 --> 02:19.910]  Agreed.
[02:19.910 --> 02:22.650]  To just being the breeding factor and, you know,
[02:22.650 --> 02:24.730]  that hunt and seeing what males are gonna be
[02:24.730 --> 02:26.970]  that you're gonna select and teaming them up
[02:26.970 --> 02:30.610]  with the females and, you know, just creating that cross.
[02:30.610 --> 02:35.610]  And there's wizardry, artistry, and a little bit of luck,
[02:35.770 --> 02:37.370]  I'd say in all of it.
[02:37.370 --> 02:38.210]  So.
[02:38.210 --> 02:39.370]  Right, so you never know, you get something you see.
[02:39.370 --> 02:41.530]  I mean, we can bring the lab into the equation.
[02:41.530 --> 02:42.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42.370 --> 02:44.330]  But I'm a little bit of a seed hunter
[02:44.330 --> 02:45.650]  and I'm looking for someone else.
[02:45.650 --> 02:48.770]  Like I'm looking and I've heard it exists in Amsterdam
[02:48.770 --> 02:51.690]  that someone has a true, pure Acapulco gold,
[02:51.690 --> 02:54.010]  not some sort of crossbred or backbred.
[02:54.010 --> 02:56.250]  But I agree with you, it's an art.
[02:56.250 --> 02:58.890]  One concern I have is, you know,
[02:58.890 --> 03:00.450]  something great comes along,
[03:00.450 --> 03:03.190]  but we're so busy trying to constantly innovate
[03:03.190 --> 03:04.030]  and change it.
[03:04.030 --> 03:05.050]  And unfortunately in the States,
[03:05.050 --> 03:06.850]  it's kind of a race to the top, right?
[03:06.850 --> 03:08.850]  A lot of us that are purists are a little bummed
[03:09.370 --> 03:10.850]  that it's this whole THC race to,
[03:10.850 --> 03:13.930]  oh, I've got a Chernobyl that's a 36%, a 38%,
[03:13.930 --> 03:15.070]  it's overkill.
[03:15.070 --> 03:18.310]  My concern is if everyone's racing to the next thing,
[03:18.310 --> 03:19.890]  what about some of those coveted strains
[03:19.890 --> 03:21.570]  we loved and grew up with, right?
[03:21.570 --> 03:23.330]  Like a true Northern Lights.
[03:23.330 --> 03:24.170]  Oh yeah.
[03:24.170 --> 03:26.410]  You know, which I know Jodri has, I know he's got it.
[03:26.410 --> 03:28.490]  But it's like, are we gonna miss out
[03:28.490 --> 03:30.850]  on some of those coveted too, you know?
[03:30.850 --> 03:31.690]  So.
[03:31.690 --> 03:33.410]  Yeah, it really bothers me that people pay so much attention
[03:33.410 --> 03:36.090]  to high versatility Indica, it's like whatever,
[03:36.090 --> 03:37.450]  or potency levels.
[03:37.450 --> 03:40.810]  It's like, I personally would never judge any cannabis
[03:40.810 --> 03:42.690]  that I wanna consume or check it out.
[03:42.690 --> 03:43.530]  By the percentage.
[03:43.530 --> 03:46.730]  By the percentage, or whether it's a hybrid or sativa.
[03:46.730 --> 03:49.970]  I mean, when it's growing, it's very obvious
[03:49.970 --> 03:52.850]  for most growers to tell that it has some sativa qualities.
[03:52.850 --> 03:56.450]  And I like sativas, but everything pretty much at this point
[03:56.450 --> 03:58.410]  unless you're getting into some true land racing,
[03:58.410 --> 04:00.050]  historic, everything's a hybrid.
[04:00.050 --> 04:00.890]  That's exactly it.
[04:00.890 --> 04:04.530]  Whether it's sativa dominant or hybrid, or Indica dominant,
[04:04.530 --> 04:07.370]  it's all cannabis.
[04:08.290 --> 04:10.610]  And you can look at something that's like a Skittles,
[04:10.610 --> 04:13.770]  which is always low, doesn't have much bag appeal.
[04:14.770 --> 04:18.810]  Usually tests around 14%, but it tastes so good.
[04:18.810 --> 04:19.650]  I think it's the blue diamond, man.
[04:19.650 --> 04:20.890]  And still gets me so high.
[04:20.890 --> 04:22.930]  I think it's the blue side of that equation, in my opinion.
[04:22.930 --> 04:26.770]  I agree, it's such a well-rounded, and Jodri gets into,
[04:26.770 --> 04:29.770]  and I think it's the next phase, it's more of the terpenes.
[04:29.770 --> 04:32.650]  I love Mersene, I'm a lemony, there's certain terps
[04:32.650 --> 04:35.770]  I know that I love more so, but it's funny you mention that
[04:35.770 --> 04:39.610]  because I was back at the Cannabis with Ricardo Bacca.
[04:39.610 --> 04:41.010]  They did a whole documentary he was in
[04:41.010 --> 04:43.250]  called Rolling Papers, and the producer,
[04:43.250 --> 04:44.850]  every opportunity he had, he'd ask,
[04:44.850 --> 04:46.850]  he's like, are you high right now?
[04:46.850 --> 04:48.330]  And asking someone if they're high right now
[04:48.330 --> 04:50.910]  in this industry is very similar to asking someone,
[04:50.910 --> 04:52.250]  are you Indica or Sativa?
[04:52.250 --> 04:54.090]  I laugh when someone asks that because yeah,
[04:54.090 --> 04:57.810]  if I had to choose, I'm an Indica dominant guy.
[04:57.810 --> 04:59.490]  I'm a nighttime medical, I'm an advocate
[04:59.490 --> 05:00.730]  on the medicinal side.
[05:00.730 --> 05:03.970]  My ailments more so I deal with in the evenings, at night.
[05:03.970 --> 05:05.890]  But it's funny when people are like,
[05:05.890 --> 05:09.130]  Indica, Sativa, or hybrid, it's like,
[05:09.130 --> 05:10.210]  really pretty much everything.
[05:10.210 --> 05:11.770]  I would venture to guess, I don't know what you're,
[05:11.770 --> 05:14.290]  I'd say 80% plus out there are hybrids, right?
[05:14.290 --> 05:15.810]  On the shelves, easy.
[05:15.810 --> 05:17.450]  I mean, it's just crazy to think that someone
[05:17.450 --> 05:19.450]  has a pure Sativa or a pure Indica,
[05:19.450 --> 05:20.730]  because to your point, land-raised.
[05:20.730 --> 05:22.650]  I mean, it's only, if you can find something
[05:22.650 --> 05:27.010]  that's truly out of Afghan, or truly out of South Africa,
[05:27.010 --> 05:29.650]  truly out of, I mean, it's just hard, right?
[05:29.650 --> 05:32.250]  It's crazy stuff.
