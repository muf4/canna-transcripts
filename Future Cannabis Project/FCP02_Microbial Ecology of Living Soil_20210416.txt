yeah hold on one second those are for you they're shells from Hawaii I know
but dad ever oh my god my internet connection is killing me now give me
yeah I mean you guys maybe just do some small talk
aha I'm in all right well we'll uh welcome everybody to the room
hi my name is Latham Morrison I'm a soil micro can't even think straight
soil biologist soil engineer we have leaf here leaf why don't you introduce
yourself everyone well at least you remember your name
Leighton even if you don't remember what you do that's that's always nice
yeah I'm leaf Olson I'm a environmental scientist and dabble in mycology plant
science water various things like that and sometimes talk about them on the
radio and on the apply ecology podcast and it's nice to be here with you all
and oh my gosh look who's here the man of the hour oh my too kind
hey everyone I guess that's my cue to introduce myself for those that aren't
familiar my name is Craig Truster I'm a applied
mycologist educator and citizen
about soil and looking at ecosystems really so definitely excited to talk and
will just get recently got is uh working with the organization that grows food
and converts empty lots in New York City into farms and a big part of it is
to make all that happen it's gonna be compost so I'm pretty stoked to be all
right sounds good well we've Peter's the only one that hasn't introduced himself
but he told me he warned me that he was gonna be kind of running around crazy so
we we chop it up about microbials in the soil system usually we have talked a
little bit about water and some of the other things that are directly related
to soil biology and so I think for tonight's show we discussed perhaps
talking a little bit about some of the new and exciting things that are coming
out that are gonna help make some wonderful advances in the next few years
and Craig I'd love you to explain about that new testing method that we're
texting about earlier yesterday with respect to could you describe it and
there are never yes it was that it was the genomics so a quicker better way to
understand the difference and individual species that within the community okay
we'll talk about a number of different ways and so I'll kind of set the table
for anyone who isn't familiar with this because I think there's a lot of things
that the technology's really come a long way it's pretty exciting however with
any technology there are limits and also there are developments that I'm kind of
you know make things that were once thought impractical impossible or
incredibly technical far more accessible so we can talk about that so definitely
with trying to understand the symphony that is nature in soils in biology and
ecologies whether on micro macro scale kind of investigating the microbial
world is essential conventionally we've accomplished this through microscopy
there's a whole range of microscopy techniques that are had been employed
for decades and improved upon you know going back to Anthony von Lohenhauen
with a first microscope using investigating the first documented
microorganism which we called amicules which you know we've obviously kind of
expanded upon classified more appropriately but still at the end of
the day it's very intensive you are basically have to dedicate a significant
amount of time to understand the morphology of these organisms you know
even even getting them down to a genus and when we talk about genius we're
talking about you know the grouping of organisms that are closely similar
before the speciation occurs so you know if anyone is familiar with dr. Leningham
soil food web this is you know this microscopy this shadowing light
microscopy is essential to characterize who's home who's doing what and also
understand relations in a make soil system whether it is has abundant
organic matter scant organic matter and you know whether there's abundant
microbes or scant microbes with whose house so microscopy is great but it takes
a fair bit of time there are kind of you know the more experience you have
under the scope the more you can kind of assess things qualitatively you know
very quickly kind of because you have this kind of almost like this mental
memory you can understand and see forms and have a better intuition about it
however to truly document these microbes and to articulate them and record them
and also to kind of have the process of moving things away from an anecdote to a
documentation to do science and all these incredible practices which we can
use to boost microbial diversity it's incredibly time-intensive so what was
really exciting was the notion that we can incorporate a number of molecular
techniques so just working on the principle that we understand that every
living entity every organism has a genome it has DNA basically the cold
storage mechanism for maintaining genetic information that it can then
read that information and basically produce the multitude of enzymes and
proteins that drive the biochemistry the mechanisms of life so it's pretty handy
and every organism hasn't so also to within similar organisms there's similar
motifs and patterns you know all organisms have a conserved set of
genetic information or genes that they require that you know they were
essential for you know just a basically to functional break down organic
material to drive your metabolism we won't get anything particular but this
doesn't remember that there is all organisms share a to the last universal
common ancestor called Luca so every single biological living organism on
this planet can trace its lineage back to this this primary organism to where
there is very much similarity that's kind of manifested itself amongst all
current organisms okay so great we're able to understand DNA we can you know
more recently in the past 20 years we can sequence it sequencing has gone down
sequences the process of basically you're able to obtain DNA either through
extracting and isolating from an organism or you can have basically
extracted from the environment since you know there's DNA all over the place and
it's incredibly durable it is the molecule that life bases it's upon so
durability is incredibly important so you can even extract from the
environment so one of the problems though however if we're trying to
investigate these microbes living in very tightly knit communities the the
problem is that you know if you're taking let's say a soil sample or a
water sample you don't per se have any you know you know if you whatever DNA
you're isolating in that sample you have no idea whether that DNA that you
isolated were you know you're getting that you've sequenced those those
organisms micro or macro whether they were alive today yesterday a decade ago
you know you don't know whether they're active or dormant so it's kind of you
know it's like a pish posh everything mixed together in general so this is
something that's really kind of you know there's never methodologies that
researchers have had to devise and develop to kind of you know kind of take
this potential bias into fact you know just based upon the sample that's there
so kind of correlating other information or data about the habitat
and what they can know or observe based upon other microbes or organisms that
are studying but what's really exciting now is that as we're able to get all
this these this DNA from the environment sequence it but also we're building
these huge data sets we're building this this big data everyone talks about our
data science but the application of all that is formally called bioinformatics
so the factor is bio referring to biology the fact that we can extract
these molecules DNA we can sequence them and effectively digitize them so there
are four letters in DNA ATG and C won't get into the names of the actual
descriptors but keeping it simple but once they're digitized we have them in
databases and then we can have these references so we are able to you know
reference a genetic sequence organism we understand however sometimes we just
extract DNA from the environment and there's no hits back right we could
search that sequence against databases it's a similar organism but
characterized as sometimes we get no results so we'll come back as an
unidentified organism which is pretty wild so you know we can do things where
we can okay we have all these unspecified unidentified organisms kind
of these these microbial friends we've yet acquainted with you pay but what's
really interesting is that we can understand that all these organisms that
we've extracted some of them although they may be an unknown some of those
unknowns may be similar or dissimilar to one another so we can actually sort them
so it's kind of the unknown hit list we can we can basically look at their
genomes and see what pattern of their genes their DNA or similar or dissimilar
we can group them we can group them into things called use operational taxonomic
units so it's really important because you know so much of soil it is kind of
it is really kind of like the you know it's the black box of our current age
you know you know I think even even our da Vinci pretty much said it that you
know himself that we knew more about the Wanderers the planets above the cosmos
above than actually the soil beneath our feet so it's pretty amazing that even we
can kind of extract this DNA but it's like this biological dark matter in a
sense of what's unknown but we can kind of tease out we can poke and prod at it
so that's pretty amazing because we can build these groupings and then if we can
actually look at the genes we can compare what the genes are relative to
other organisms and see okay we don't need to accept electrons to basically
allow this process to get so it's pretty amazing so we can look at these unknowns
and get information still the problem is you know for going in and extracting all
this DNA from from a from a soil or water any kind of you know substrate
that you're working with you're still kind of in the notion of okay when was
this taken right for all intents and purposes yeah you could get this but you
know you're the equivalent of you know let's say that I was let's say that you
were an extraterrestrial anthropologist right you are someone from outer space
that were really interested in human civilization right here now and maybe
even recently and let's say you wanted to study New York extracting this DNA
from the soil or from like a sample we're macroscopic organisms and we're
sampling microscopic ones so may imagine this um this macroscopic or megascopic
extraterrestrial going down and taking a core sample that's that's maybe like a
mile deep and 10 miles wide of any metropolitan area that you're living in
New York City San Francisco Los Angeles and yeah very well you would get
information about human beings living on living on the surface of the earth at
point maybe even some of the the past couple hundred even thousand years of
activity of what's buried beneath the girth but you would also probably get
the fossil record of everything going back a couple hundred million years in
the geological scale so you get this whole mix of information there so what's
really exciting now is some new developments they're working on to kind
of solve this is something called it's the acronym is bond cat FACS bond cat
stands for bio orthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging so that gobbledygook
what it basically means is that all of our things that make up our body our
body and you know and all the you know and also the enzymes that allow the
function which are functional proteins they're made up of amino acids chains
amino acids bound together by these bonds polypeptide bonds you may have
heard that term so it's you know there's about 20 out of them and so they're
pretty essential and in the order of them is critical because they fold up
in a certain way especially for enzymes they provide a function and then even
for protein structural proteins they have to fold in a certain way to kind of
provide that quality to them whether it's for example a protein related to
your fingernails a protein related to your muscle you know relate to your bone
it's really important the structure and shape is pretty important as well but
anyway getting back to the point that non canonical amino acid is they
basically take an amino acid that's pretty common methionine and they
modify it they modify it with the I believe this alkyl group so it's this
group of they modify one part of the modified the amino acid so that pretty
much you have this out group access in it after for a fluorescent dye tag so
it's pretty amazing what you can do is you can insert you can cold you can take
a sample of this of the soil and you can pretty much put this sample into a
microcosm or a culture vessel and insert some of this amino acid in there
and you know microbes are chewing away constantly organic matter you know
organic matter is made up of a variety of carbon molecules and also proteins as
well and they're recycling those proteins into amino acids so they can
synthesize their own proteins so you insert some of this non canonical amino
acid into the microcosm and the microbes take it up they pull it up into their
bodies they use it they use it in search synthesizing proteins either function
and these they pretty much have this tag that will adapt to a fluorescent dye
bound up inside these living organisms as they're going about their their
living business so then you can introduce this dye into the microcosm
and it will selectively bind to those adapters on the amino acid so it's
amazing so for the first time you can actually use FACS which is a flow
assisted cell sorting I believe and you can pretty much run these microbes
through a microfluidic device this little kind of very thin little tube and
then you can shine a laser through this column and then if the microbes actually
do have that fluorescent dye incorporated into their proteins through
the non canonical amino acid it'll fluoresce and then you can pretty much
get a sense of who's home and then you can even use crazier methods to sort
out these microbes and kind of do investigative work on them so this is
something that's the bleeding edge something that's kind of going on it
research laboratories but you know this is something that is pretty remarkable
because the one square to current try to circle is with this DNA work you had no
idea whether the microbes you're working with are active they're dormant or
they're dead but that's kind of one example of how this and you know so
pointed leading edge the bleeding edge but to kind of give to kind of come back
around and provide some perspective about when we're collecting genetic
information the first basis one was was you know was pretty much genomics so
genomic work we're looking at the genomes of them and be able to identify
them based upon their DNA what's even more interesting is we can kind of tease
out maybe who's home or who's doing what by something called transcriptomics so
transcripts are basically when you take a DNA you have an enzyme called RNA
polymerase and what that does is it takes the DNA and it reads it and makes
the it makes the companion molecule the RNA the RNA is a little more temporary
so like if you imagine DNA is a is like a recipe book a family heirloom which
you know you wanna you want to keep it safe and stable you know if you wanted
to write down a recipe on that you wouldn't you know rip out the recipe and
take it home put in your pocket no you baby copy it down you would trans trans
you transcribe it onto a note card that's basically RNA so what you can do
is you can do transcriptomics when you can look at what RNA is just out there
in the environment in these cells basically showing what parts of the
genome they're expressing these different functions of metabolism or you
know more meta metabolism with other organisms in the environment so that's
transcriptomics which is you can kind of get some fun home for that then you
can get into the whole aspect proteomics you can basically break down based upon
a variety of transcripts but also to DNA what classes of proteins are there we
understand microbes that share protein families based upon function they can
have some variability so think about this right you know to have a car you
know like cars come in all different shapes and sizes and forms and speeds
and functions but at the end of the day you got a pretty short laundry list of
all the essential things that you need to pretty much have a compost
combustion motor vehicle gas tank spark plugs pistons you know so the functional
part of these things don't change too much right you know they're conserved
but you know the the flair the design the size can have some variability so
that you can kind of equate this to kind of protein families or enzymes
families where the functional parts they're conserved they don't change much
because they have an important job to do but the things that aren't so
essential can have some variability over time so kind of the proteomics in that
respect and then also the next level stuff kind of also on the bleeding edge
kind of on the same thing with that the bond cat FACS of which is looking at
whose home and who's active is also the metabolomics so you're basically what's
pretty amazing is you can look at a biological simple you can see what's
there what can be food for organisms which we call them substrates and then
also look at the product what is also been metabolized and then compare that
with the genomes of the organisms what enzyme classes and you can pretty much
do metabolic maps of whose home who's doing what who's chewing on what who's
pooping out what you know who's eating that poop you know because in all
microbial sense organisms waste is another one's food source which is
ultimately leaves with the generation of humus and humic matter but um yeah I
guess that that kind of wraps it up provides a bit of context into where
we've been what we're doing and where we're going
so hopefully I wasn't too much of a down yeah you know what you know it
makes me think actually I want to want to pose a question to you late and
follow up on what Craig was just saying if you were like no bawling out of
control and just had you know a bunch of you know government funded research
labs you know your hand and want to analyze anything you wanted them to
analyze how would you try to utilize these technologies for your own
practices and soil consulting and growing I'm glad you asked that
question that was kind of the direction I was wanting to take it you know to
reel it back in just a little bit and understanding microscopy I learned this
very early early on in my beginnings of sitting around spending a lot of time
behind a microscope trying to identify different types of organisms and whether
this was a healthy system or not healthy system and so what I noticed
that the other students that were there who were well well well a lot more nets
than I am well well on their way to becoming you know really good
microscopists I would notice that if they were in a bad mood or if they in a
good mood they would see things differently and I would have them look
at a sample or they would look at a sample and then I would look at the same
sample and try to see what they were seeing or understand what they were
looking at and the better I got at this the more I realized that the individual
mood would have effect their emotional status or stasis had an effect on what
they saw and it got worse I actually took three similar samples of a product
or three identically same samples of a product that I had made and shipped it
off to a soil soil food wet lab and had three radically different results come
back so it verified my hypothesis that if if this person was in a good stasis
that they would see positive things and vice versa so all of a sudden it became
very relevant that that microscopy had a serious weakness as far as the ability
to really you know quantitative create a quantitative value of what it is and
since then I've gone about looking at a bigger picture so I look at it like
alright what are the other characters I'm seeing where did the soil come from
is it is a dirt there's a is it a good rich loom what is what are the
biological constituents groups that are there and so I've always been extremely
excited to take it from reductionism which is to identify each individual
organism and then try to figure out what part they're playing in it to the
communities because it's always been about the communities to me and I think
that you know as a inoculant maker I'm looking to to create the most diversity
possibly can along with the support work so think of it like you know you're
trying to move an army in you're trying to inoculate something or take something
over you need your you know your logistics guy you need your milk and
cookies you need all your food your water medical supplies ammunition
equipment to make repairs so you really want that support network not just that
one individual or you know three or four individuals stay in the phosphate
solubilizing bacteria and so you know in my mind this tool now provides a
combination of these tools because obviously it's not one there's many
different pieces coming together here kind of like a general contractor you
bring the electrician the plumber the framers you put them all in the same
place and you say build and now you have the ability by using these multiple
stool multiple different tools to assess like Craig said who's home who's doing
what who's providing food who's who's rolling the tanks who's rolling the
artillery bringing up the rear who's making sure all the milk and cookies are
there for everybody when they get time to roll into roll into their bunks you
know that's that's all the more probably important than it is to reduce on a
single cell level which is this guy and what is he doing so in my mind it's you
know again it's it's great time an exciting time in the world of
microbiology because now we're not limited to these personal side effects
of mood and now we can actually really dive deeper down the true function of
all of these components not just a few different ones so that would be my
answer to that question leaf and how would you use this tool if you have it
unbelievably unlimited access oh boy that's a possibilities are so vast but I
guess what it could really be an official to like when I'm thinking of
you know my background is more academic even though I'm not in academia right
now but kind of like bridging this gap between a lot of these more practitioner
tools that since I've been out of academia and meet people within
regenerative agriculture composting soil health natural farming etc it's like I
started learning about that stuff because I was in academia kind of
interested in bioremediation habitat restoration things like that and a lot
of those techniques aren't don't exist in that sphere because usually you know
a lot of the published research is trying out you know a certain variety of
plant adding you know a certain type of fungus but the I these tools haven't
really been assessed in the academic sphere partially because there's a no
there's not existing literature to you know say what it is that they are so
with these with these techniques we can go from you know someone knowing that
they have a good compost recipe because they understand the principles of
composting and they put it together and turn it right but then combining that
with these tools of assessing what specific microbes are active in it and
when you're applying it and you know and also you know how this is affected
seasonally like when you're if you have a microbial inoculum and you apply it
in the springtime or the summer or the winter you know even if you have the
same baseline community in there like which ones are really getting active in
the different seasons or it could even be sampled on even a smaller temporal
scale of you know who's active after a big rain or when it's dry the thing is
if you can start to really quantify those types of microbes and you know
who's living what you know groups of organisms bacteria the fungi etc are in
there and can kind of dial that in for specific techniques then that to me is
like becomes a bridge or the gap between a lot of this much more what I would view
as like pragmatic you know practice of you know for people who are actually you
know growing plants and farming and you know have developed these methods and
bridging that gap between the academic research labs that are you know and
potentially like ag research where they have all these tools to research all the
stuff but they shy away from a lot of those techniques I feel like primarily
because they're not very well understood and because if you try to go on Google
Scholar and look up for you know the biome of a compost pile there's not
really research on that but that would be really important because then it
would allow a lot of these more kind of regenerative techniques and you know the
stuff that I know you and I'm like a lot of the people in the audience are
probably practicing would allow those to then be potentially analyzed in a way
that they could be published in peer-reviewed literature and then
compared side by side with more I hate to use the word conventional but you
know the techniques that are currently being used because they're a little more
simple and streamlined to understand so yeah having genetic tools or you know
the combination of the microscopy and the genetics and other measurements that
can then demonstrate you know specifically who's living what's
happening in these and these compost piles and these you know IMO collections
and whatever it is then that creates the tool for people whether it's academic researchers who want to go deeper into
understanding how these things work or if it's like you are like a practitioner
a farmer you know biological land management with with the you know a
municipality or someone like that or you want to apply to get grant funding from
a federal agency to do this type of stuff as soon as there starts to be more
of a scientific basis of you know these are the microbes live in these things we
know these microbes do these functions and look the soil is healthier it'll be
way easier for people who are in the kind of regenerative field to do work
with you know what kind of more legitimate organizations or I shouldn't
say legitimate but you know more institutional organizations that have
lots of funding and then that could be kind of a path of opening the faucet a
little for you know more funding and interest and attention to get paid to a
lot of these methods that seem to work but haven't really been you know studied
in that peer-reviewed science realm which you know they work so I mean who
cares really except for they have to have that background before you you know
are gonna have a better chance of you know getting the the SARE grants to give
you know the money to do this kind of stuff because I've been involved in
trying to apply for some of those grants and we like want to test something with
you know like myco filtration or some sort of micro compost thing there's a
little often a hang-up or a challenge because they're like where's the proof
of concept and it's like well these people did it but a lot of times when I
say where's the concept they want peer-reviewed literature that
demonstrates this is a thing and so it's kind of a chicken-and-the-egg
situation or you know who's we we need proof to fund it oh we need to fund it
to make the proof and if we can bridge that gap these tools could really help I
think advance the legitimacy and the the prestige of like more nuanced
composting and biological soil management. That was great Leif. Yeah and
it's again it's it's helping steer people into regenerating soil and right
now I've been reading a lot of articles about just how decimated our crop belts
are so we've lost a lot of the soil it's been transported which is basically how
three-quarters of the soil or 80% of the soil in the world is formed through
transportation so that would be wind or water and ice as well so that would
really help us say okay we've lost the organic horizon half of our A horizon is
gone we're getting down to the B horizon what is that horizons parent material
made up of how best do we transport that in time forward to provide the right
microbials to really get that system to kick off and so that in my mind is
exactly what you're talking about is getting you know not only funding but
but documentation is to which organism which organism should be put into play
at first in order to speed up the geological time that it takes to turn
basically you know damaged
aerials and it damages not the right word but when a glacier plows over all
living life what comes first to build that soil back after the glaciers
recede and that's kind of what I'm talking about same with a volcano or or
an earthquake where you have a serious devastation to the physical component of
the soil itself like what we've done with plowing so yeah I think I think that
you know these kinds of tools and techniques will be invaluable especially
as the price comes down and another reason why we formed this group here is
to hopefully encourage more academic scientists get involved with you know
the regen world the farmers the people that are out there doing that doing the
work in the soil so Craig why don't you answer the question to what would you do
with these tools you had unlimited access well it's not just access access
the tools because I think this is one thing I've definitely thought about with
you know you can have all the toys in the world but a lot of the toys were
never designed to be used alone they're incredibly intricate and complex they
can generate quite a bit of information but it takes a collaboration of people
to kind of answer the questions that are posed out you know you know when there's
a large question or a general kind of you know inquiry into something you have
any of the tools that will give you any kind of qualitative or quantitative
assessment but the biggest thing is to have a team people that better
understand so yeah definitely it'll be it'll be a world that have these things
that's one thing I have I wanted to state beforehand because it is any work
especially in this higher and cutting-edge of science it is
collaborative because there there's no way that anyone could be an expert in
everything with these aspects you could you know understand a broad swath but
when it comes down to physically doing the work theory and practice are two
different things to answer the question one thing that I'm really interested is
looking at more so the consortiums that are living in different types of
compost especially the compost that is you know potentially sub thermophilic
this is something that you know if anyone who has experience with natural
farming this is pretty important you're doing this collections of microbes from
the from your natural environment you're trying to stabilize them but also to
wake them back up especially on a variety of substrates a combination of
nitrogen and carbon and then eventually incorporate them into your soil so this
is one of the things of 131 degrees Fahrenheit a number of the aerobic
organisms can survive these high heats they'll go dormant the the bacteria will
sporeulate some the fungi will sporeulate as well the the nematodes
and permafrost will insist on those people themselves into these incredibly
powerful hydrophobic coats to go through the stressful transition and this is one
of the things when you when you go through the process of composting into
heated up to kill any pest or pathogens in the organic matter in any kind of
undesirable seeds of plants that may be in it you need to let it stabilize you
need to let it recover it has to go through the the stabilization but also
maturation phase and slowly the diversity will recover so this is
something I'm really interested is looking at using some of these to
characterize what's going on who's home and also potentially who's doing what in
of these really potent and powerful sub thermophilic compost that are going on
with natural farming and some even to I'm interested to experiment this year
since I do have some flexibility doing some of the sub sub thermophilic
composting with a variety of materials that you can really crawl this is the
biggest thing why you know if you are composting and you're not able to ensure
the chain of custody all the materials there's any ambiguity you should go
through the phase because there's always at risk unless you actually
dealing with a microscope to verify what's going on you might be some
pathogens are passed in there that could really give yourself a headache but I
think there are ways to speed up the process of maturation with some of the
sub thermophilic composting when I'm talking about sub thermophilic the
aerobic decomposition of organic matter below 131 degrees Fahrenheit tension
even below 115 that approaching range as well with that you can get some
interesting biodiversity going as well
thank you Craig that was awesome yes so basically that's what I do now I
control my ingredients I make a biologically diverse compost but I
literally collect the greens and browns so I have chain of custody I know where
they came from I always focus on as much diversity as I possibly can and I
harvest as much fresh material as I can from different areas and so basically
usually my piles don't hit the 120 threshold so I like to think is 130 is a
threshold 120 is a threshold everything that we understand about natural farming
is that at 120 build a pile I will get it to about 115 if I get there I'll flip
it if not sure but where the real sweet spot is is between 80 and 85 degrees
with a moisture content of about 60% and you can just literally watch the
amoebas every one of them is splitting you'll see incredible nematode
generation fly to be present and so this is a great way to really create
something that's more of an inoculant than it is a compost and compost has
many different terms you know there's the biodynamic compost is greasy doesn't
have a lot of organisms but it takes two years to make traditional thermal fillet
compost as Craig was mentioning takes at least a year because you know you have
to have that maturity to come back and play those organisms can start to come
out of cysts or spore to start repopulating it who's got that much time
so you know in all of the commercial composting facilities I visited and
there's a lot of them and or use their products it's horrible it's very rarely
mature more often than not it's hot often is gassing off the ammonia which
is what you kind of want to keep into play because it's a great source for
other microbes to consume so it's it's a challenge you know in in the commercial
composting industry they don't have space you know if their inner city or
even suburban you know or commercial landscape of the commercial office parks
you don't have the time to let stuff sit for that period of time especially when
you're trying to burn up a waste stream so I think it's the combination that
Craig had kind of alluded to that you know using that feedstock call it feed
stock as it really is it's a mature and then blending it with a good low temp
biologically rich material you could you could advance the process a lot quicker
I just a friend of mine and I kind of started a compost cup out here in
Ventura County and it's called the Ventura County compost cup and you can
actually visit the site Ventura County or VC compost calm and we're really
trying to get awareness out to people that you know all these different types
of compost grades you know like ones mulch ones nutrient-rich and then you
have like the biological side of it so getting people aware of how best to use
compost if you're using a nutrient-dense compost if you don't have biologics or a
good biological soil you're really not going to get a further breakdown or a
speedy release of those nutrients and that's where you know that's where the
biological side comes into play and if you could get a commercial composter to
have both of these products and blend them together as before they sell it or
at the time of sale we would have so much better results or for people would
have they would physically see the results and it's all about that as
humans we tend to be doubting Thomas's we want to know we want to see that this
is what's going on and when you spread a immature compost you're not going to get
great reaction in most cases you might actually kill the plant or you'll see a
yellowing and what that yellowing is is that the thermophytes are still trying
to break down the carbon so they need nitrogen so they'll steal nitrogen from
your soil which is really problematic so that's I hear again you know now if
we have tools like what we were talking about earlier think of the potential of
how we can turn something that's immature into maturity very quickly and
a friend of mine a dear friend of mine and you know cohort chip Osborne from
Osborne organics and I've been talking about this for years as to how how we
could take that immature stuff so that we can keep up with a with a pace of the
materials that will feed stocks coming in mature it fast enough to get it out
and have it usable so yeah I'm really looking forward to again as time permits
you know getting these the costs and and the what I want to call AI that would be
able to direct a lot of these more advanced pieces of the puzzle so that we
as the individuals or groups can utilize some of these you know really
interesting biological interactions and communities either one you boys like to
add to that yeah I'll take a swing yeah so I think this is something to you
especially the case I'm working on when it comes to composting especially in
urban areas there is no shortage of feedstocks to utilize this is kind of
blessing in the curse because you know it's really hard to know what is the
point of origin of things you're working with especially if you're trying to kind
of deal with kind of effects of potential pesticides organic
contaminants inorganic contaminants kind of anything's the gamut so I think
yeah definitely the notion of the fact you know especially if you're more rural
or suburban area you gotta get around to kind of make relationships with companies
or stores or organizations to you know get okay like oh we'll pick up all your
your rinds from for the food scraps you don't use okay you'll pick up your coffee
grounds okay we'll pick up this which is just great you got a heart you got a
card it around but you can kind of establish more relationship where
especially in the cities with communities people that want to just
don't want to see their organics go straight into landfill much rather see
it compost it is hard to control so something actually kind of dealing with
right now especially as we're trying to start up the community kind of collection
of food scraps back in and which there is a surprising amount coming in each
each week and how to process it definitely I'm I have no question about
meeting a process but also what to do with it kind of off to start to bat I
think one of the first things with this kind of compost about given the fact
there's nowhere for it to sound mature is that often in a lot of urban
environments a lot of lots that are being converted into green space which I
think is essential that's that's one of the biggest things to happen have a
space where nature can slowly return back to an area which has normally been
a built environment rather than a natural environment is you know just
applying this compost straight down on the lot itself a lot of the soils are
especially in my in New York City or sandy we've incredibly sandy soils and
so if you walk around empty lot and kick it up it's this this fine sandy dust
that just kind of kicks up and who knows what's in it between heavy metals between
organic contaminants petroleum hydrocarbons so just that first batch of
compost the compost you may not know what's in it just putting it down to put
that organic matter onto these really depleted soils these bacterially dominant
you know dirt and then basically layering other sources of biomass I'm
very fortunate to have access to thousands of pounds of spent mushrooms
substrate so combining that with the compost and dropping mulch on top of it
it's great I'm you know I'm basically thinking about okay well if I can't use
this compost right away it'll be sitting there you know basically
intercalated basically entwined with fungal biomass and a rich woody
substrate to kind of cover it that you know that microbial diversity in that
in that layer you know will continue to grow over time maybe not what I'm gonna
try to cultivate but the ambient population beneath my feet will kind of
amplify so on the note of kind of understanding what you can grow and have
I think definitely the notion of like pre-inoculating different substrates
very fortunate to have an abundance of mushroom mycelium the residual biomass
from mushroom cultivation you can use that to inoculate my wood chips other
woody materials even probably added it back into my compost after it's done to
kind of help boost the fungal ratio since a number of the the higher tiers
of the soil food web the micron the micro arthropods and even fungal feeding
nematodes having an extra fungal biomass is essential to kind of get the
flywheel going so there's a lot of ways you can kind of deal with that of
reduced diversity by adding in some of these decomposer fungi which are you
know basically have enjoyed quite a number quite a bit of popularity as
they've kind of been growing for gourmet cultivation so I think also to that as
well the sub thermophilic composting essential but also to another aspect to
is on you know prospecting diversity in your area you know I think leaf is no
stranger to the magic of leaf mold no no pun intended but the reality is to is
that you know there's a wide variety of fungi that play important roles not the
white rot fungi not the fungi that make fruity bodies but the secondary and
tertiary decomposes which are essential for cycling nutrients which you know
along with that with yeasts are as well and something that I've even thought
about too is on you know combinations of kind of doing collections some of
these interesting kind of urban IMOs per se even kind of ways to kind of you know
cultivate microbes on a variety materials cardboard we're swimming in it
lots and lots of it and even kind of the thing it was kind of going into you know
potentially not so much a forest but there are some pockets of forest in the
city and some some thicker parts of public parks and spaces and utilizing a
variety materials which are abundant fungal foods and burying them in
combination wood chips and see what kind of just wild decomposer fungi you can
get so everything I've seen more so definitely leans on my background of
mycology and understanding that a lot of these processes to kind of speed things
that's rely upon these uh these not these not only these decomposer fungi
but these mutualistic fungi where you know if you want to bring back the
mutualistic fungi you're going to need plants as well so I think there's a lot
of focus upon you know how you can work with local species local plants local
kind of cultivation techniques and that you know it's not a one-size-fits-all
approach it's you know this is going to be something that's very specific to
your buyer region in your biome based upon the ambient conditions of
temperature humidity available moisture species that are available you know
natives and also you know invasive species that you know probably do have a
secondary function there are some pretty tenacious invasives right there that
kind of outcompete with anything but I this is something I do I do I do really
think about with kind of the beauty of natural farming is the fact that you can
plants that are undesirable you can ferment them into food for the plants
that are desirable so you know quite a number of threads but I think definitely
kind of bring it back to how to improve the quality of compost you know I was on
here the other day and talking to someone about oh yeah I got this mushroom
compost they carted it in I was like okay mushroom compost what is it what
in particular is it oh well they grow they grow they grow portabellos on it
all this kind of stuff so it's manure I'm like okay cool I'm interesting I'm
trying to think about whether you know they've been pasteurized it and I said I
was like okay what temperature was it oh well when I came off the truck it was a
hundred and forty five degrees and I was like Jesus Christ you know it's you know
in this the reality is you know not to put any denture to a person but it was
it was the factors that a lot of times people you know who will sell sell
certain things won't communicate or understand the nuance that's that that
has to return to ambient temperature before it's finished now that pile of
quote-unquote mushroom compost you know I believe I believe actually Jared's
here he mentioned that he let it kind of sit and stabilize and bring down back to
temperature that does have an abundant variety of organisms probably living on
and their ways to incorporate it because I think one of the biggest things you
can do is when you're building these compost is to maximize biological
diversity from a variety of feedstocks and food sources the hardest thing is
kind of knowing what is that what is the point of origin and understanding if
there's any remediation or any work you got to do to clean up any messes from
the past yeah a few things to add on there yeah I mean just the the term
mushroom compost I think is one to be very skeptical of you know not because
it's yeah what is mushroom compost I remember when I was much younger my my
parents they they got some mushroom compost from the mulch yard down the
road and put it on this one garden bed and that garden bed didn't produce
anything that year and has just been full of weeds and hasn't really had any
yields like for several years that after that happened and you know because
whatever it was about that compost probably had a bunch of pathogens in it
or something who knows but uh yeah it's just a word but yeah piles I guess I
guess really I just want to you know talk about the importance or give my you
know my thoughts on importance of piles and having lots of different piles
because it allows you know really important delineation with having
different types of mulches and inoculums like you know Craig mentioned the leaf
mold which actually you leaf mold piles can get good white rot fungi I've had a
lot of like blue it's grow out of them which are pretty pretty nice and tasty
but you know having having you know piles of leaves having multiple piles of
them instead of like one giant pile because the bigger the pile is the more
likely the bottom of it's gonna get anaerobic have your different types of
woody debris and multiple compost piles I think is really important as well like
having your you know your one like the primo super super heady you know best
quality compost pile that you it only everything that goes in it is something
that you know what it was kind of like what Layton was talking about Craig's
been mentioning with chain of custody have like you know at least one if not
more of like the super primo piles and have your other piles that are kind of
like maybe in decreasing quality of like you know it's pretty good but we throw
some stuff in there we don't really know exactly where it came from then you know
you can have like your shit pile or it's like you know you're throwing you know
things that you know are like whatever it is like tons of weed seeds in them or
you know materials that you know are probably gonna go anaerobic or not
break down you know more waste streams that probably are you know low in
nutrients and might have some level of contamination in them and then that pile
is like you don't really more let it sit maybe use it in certain landscaping
context but never put it on any like edible you know food you want to grow
and then you know you have those different piles and it uh it's I think
that I mean that helps it in terms of really trying to channel and stream the
waste products and turn them into something because if you're trying to
take on too much waste and you don't have enough places to delineate them
then you kind of get this one mediocre quality thing but um yeah we're about
close looks like we're out three minutes after the hour we want to like bring in
anyone if anyone wants to ask any questions and Q&A at this point and just
quickly while you queue Ryan up I got a brain gem and I get a covet test I'll be
back in like 30 minutes all right the YouTube chat is enjoy the show thanks
guys Ryan did you have any thing you want to ask her or comment on yeah
actually I have a question for all you guys and I've just been running some
experiments with a large pile of wood chips that I have on my property that
I've gotten from a tree trimming service down the road and I went down and I
scoped out the the I mean they have a gigantic pile of them and it's like free
come and sir you know give them as much as you want so I went and scoped them
out they had really good worm activity lots of fungal growth in them I ended up
paying to have them delivered to my homestead and they've been sitting here
for about a year they're really dormant now except for a ton of fungal activity
and I am curious with this talk of identification of different fungal
species through RNA and DNA testing would it be advantageous for me if I'm
getting positive benefits by using this fungal dominant wood chip compost it's
like a mix of broken down wood chips and sand and whatnot it just seems to be a
perfect substrate for these mushrooms to grow I've mixed it into my different
soil mixes that I use for seedlings and long-term plantings and beds I'm getting
really positive results long question short would it be advantageous for me to
culture this mycelium that I'm able to harvest from these piles to try to
propagate it out and be able to spread it throughout my entire property do you
have a is do you have any pictures of mushrooms their fruit bodies to come out
or is it just a matter mycelium that's growing through the wood chips currently
it's just a mat of mycelium I have actually taken samples of it and started
playing around with sushi rolls and whatnot trying to get it to grow out and
it seems to be a very aggressive fungus I don't have to do much and just leave
it at room temp and it takes over cardboard so I have these ideas of like
a biodigester or something that can assist the decomposition of any any kind
of materials I have on the property that I want to break down and use for
soil I have not seen any fruiting bodies I don't I don't know if it'll ever fruit
it's always got to be that perfect condition that's my understanding but I
do get very positive results with all sorts of different species of plants is
it a you thick what is what is the quality of the mycelium like just could
you try to describe it I know that sounds a bit not a very good boy and I'll
kind of clarify that anyone's listening um so yeah obviously the way we identify
macro fungi so fungi that you know fungi are interesting because they're you know
they're they're essentially microscopic organisms they're they're prompt their
primary physical form is is this mycelial phase which basically are these
high filaments called hyphae and these are incredibly small anywhere between
four to twenty microns of a mers like a millionth of meter times four or four to
twenty and then when they coalesce together they make them a map of this
hyphae called mycelium now there are a variety of fungi in the soil that are
active in decomposing some of their mycelium you can't even see it some kind
of express themselves that you can see as molds the coloration is actually the
coloration of the spore production being exposed to light through pigment
production but what Ryan's talking about here is is a filamentous fungus which
you know it sounds like it a lot of these a lot of these decomposer from a
lot of these macro fungi will have incredibly pretty prolific mycelium's
mycelium will mesh together to form these structures called rhizomorphs so
you know it's interesting because the mycelium is the organism oftentimes
people say mycelium is those roots of mushrooms well you know mushrooms are
just kind of be the fruiting body but but there is a form that these mycelium
these hyphae can fuse together to make these superstructures so individual
hyphal filaments are kind of like streets or alleyways or kind of roads
these rhizomorphs are like super mega highways that can stream nutrients
through them and basically and move them as well so there are quite a number
of species probably well there are quite a number of species that might fit the
bill with with Ryan's what Ryan's describing so normally mushroom
cultivators who cultivate these macro fungi these mushroom producing fungi
that are edible that variety of them are decomposer fungi these white rod fungi
meaning they break down the lignin the the brown heterogeneous compound which
makes wood wood you can identify them through the mushroom itself the fruiting
body but also to you on an agar plate an experienced cultivator will be able to
tell the different types of structures that these these hyphae these mycelium
produced based upon the species so there is a bit of nuanced if you are
acclimated to it what Ryan's talking about is probably some decomposer
fungus some white rod fungus there are a couple of species that might be possible
but I'm gonna shove my gob let Ryan describe it but I just wanted to clarify
those details for the room or anyone listening that may not have experience
but fungi but are curious and by a couple of species you mean like hundreds or
thousands of species that could be right yeah it's kind of crazy because in the
whole the whole grouping of fungi there are millions and we've only we've only
identified or you know yeah got it close to identifying less than 2% yeah I think
it's a situation where you want to put on your functional ecologist hat in
terms of function because it's like yeah without some sort of DNA testing it's
probably gonna be close to impossible to know what that specifically is unless
you see a mushroom growing out of it but it's growing on mulch it's super
vigorous it's growing fast it's decomposing it that probably it's
probably beneficial I'm very biased so you should know that when I say this but
I would say like definitely you know grow it out break it up add it to places
I don't know about like naturally everywhere on the property because maybe
not everyone the property is a good niche for it and maybe you don't want it
to like you know take over some more delicate ecosystems but yeah it's like
if it's a super vigorous fungus and you know unless if you're just you know
living in some sort of you know like magical old old growth forest where it
doesn't need more fungal activity I think that's that's a good idea and you
know you could try expanding it out and you know in buckets of wood chips or you
know it sounds like you were doing the like cardboard burritos or something
with it yeah yeah practice low low-tech cultivation stuff I've done that some I
worked on a project this landfill and we were doing test plots that you know try
to inoculate wood chips and hold this stuff in place the stuff we inoculated
it with didn't really grow that well but a wild fungus grew and I collected some
sample bags at the end of the project and one of the sample bags where my
psyllium looked pretty strong in it I started adding that to buckets of wood
chips the same way you would with like King's trafferia or oyster or something
where you soak the wood chips hardwood chips and then drain them off and add
some you know the spawn to it and I've got buckets of that growing and I have
no idea what it is I don't quite know what I'm gonna do with it but I feel
like I should still propagate it because you know I can put you know I've like
wine cap straferia spawn I can put under mulch or in soil but hey this is
something different I don't know what it is but it's different but yeah if
it's a white if it's got you can see like you know healthy looking white
cords it's probably not you know pathogenic or yeah and to describe it it
smells like a pearl oyster mushroom when you turn when you tear it open and even
if it's surrounded by organic matter and whatnot it seems to be completely taking
over the organic matter and there's no bacterial smell you know the nose knows
like so I've always trusted that as a natural farmer and the intent it just
feels like that I don't know I don't want to sound all hippie dippy or
anything but the the intent of the mushroom seems to be a decomposer it's
white rot for sure and I feel very confident hearing that you get the same
feelings from different mycelial activity that I should probably take the
advantageous move and try and propagate it out in a few five-gallon pails and at
least spread it around because it's going anywhere the mulch goes anyways
but at least this way I can concentrate it and kind of try and target certain
areas and maybe even move it to a different property too so I have 10
acres here and 40 out another area that I'm trying to just turn into food
forests and whatnot so yeah thank you and then for all you know yeah and for
all you know like it it could also be providing other functions that white
rot fungi could provide on the land such as like water mycelium yeah yeah
you know water filtration breaking down if there's contaminants whatever kind of
cool stuff like a potent white rot fungus could do that could be doing and
then you can kind of amplify that ecological function of it so that sounds
really cool that's exciting to hear about that yeah I'd just like to speak a
second on that too and you know that the fungi is probably the the thing that we
have decimated the most in our agricultural practices and you know one
of the key factors to this is its ability to build soil structure and
that's that's something that you know you have a very valuable tool there
especially as you see speak of garden forests to get that F to B fungal to
bacterial relationship up around your core trees would be critical and I'm
sure you're going to see some really good plant reaction now trees do take
potentially a year for some of the hardwoods some of the earlier succession
trees like deciduous will you might see reaction within nine months six months
so yeah I would highly recommend that you use that as a inoculant for around
any of your older mature trees or bushes and then let it do its thing because
it's going to travel and and potentially reach out into the soils
around it and if there's enough organic matter it will continue to propagate so
just by moving the chips you're you're essentially doing that and then to take
another level and actually cultivate something in a bucket of water or
excuse me a bucket of wet chips I think is a brilliant idea and with 50 acres to
play with I think you scored a big one there my friend so congratulations
because that's you know not not the normal course for most of us out here
thank you I appreciate that it what really amazed me is I was just goofing
around one night with my son and I'm like I'll do some sushi rolls so I use
cold water to prep the cardboard no sterilization at all it was well water
through the mycelium myceliated chips in there a couple of them were completely
covered but some of them were like 50% covered with mycelium took right to the
cardboard no contamination at all so I'm pumped man feels good that sounds
like like pleurotus definitely and another note to definitely something
really interesting if you encounter wild strains or or species of fungi or even
just this you know species of fungi can be pretty tenacious but even wild
strains are a bit more tolerant mostly because they're living out in the wild
where they're encountering all variety of bacteria fungi even viruses and
they're expressing things whenever you pick up a culture on agar plate or in
liquid culture unless you know the cultivator or the person that sourced it
you have no idea how many generations that that strain has been living on a
very specific and comfortable formulation of sugars either in liquid
culture broth or an agar so even to wild strains a fun guy if you identify
some of these beneficial what one of those that can be a great benefit
beneficial acts applications are incredibly forgiving so just a quick
little comment on that yeah yeah and like well first off Craig I'll bet you
$50 it's not pleurotus but uh deal Ryan keep an eye on keep you updated I have
naturally occurring blue it's hercules and possibly oysters too but I don't
know we'll see but what I what I was actually I was kind of gonna reiterate
what Craig just said I almost a view like if we're not thinking about you
know growing mushrooms for food and we're thinking about like trying to find
good fungi to work with and as a land management tool it's almost like a good
vetting mechanism that if you if the fungus you're working with can't grow
on like non sterilized non pasteurized cardboard or even wood chips like you
know soak the wood chips so they're hydrated but you know don't even
necessarily ferment them and inoculate them like a fungus can't grow on those
things it's probably not one you want to be working with and you know in a land
management context because if it's gonna need to have sterilized or pasteurized
substrate that's you know it's a whole nother step so it's almost like when you
do find wild fungi and want to experiment with growing them out it you
know maybe get them out a little bit but and in there you know if you're trying
to really bulk it up maybe do some cold water fermentation but really the ones
that can grow on you know with no effort at all those are the ones you probably
want to focus on propagating keep it simple and you know something else that
none of us have even mentioned is that the power of that as a food source for
the soil food web micro arthropods fungal feeding nematodes you know even
some larger insects and you know some ground squirrels and whatnot will all
consume that and then release their waste right where that is so you're
really generating a whole cycle a whole ecosystem by spreading that around so
you know again kudos to you my friend well done it's like cheat codes for your
soil it's it's pretty great if you're lucky enough to have them sure yeah
definitely thanks thank you Ryan for I really appreciate you guys time yeah
definitely I hope to see you around love the natural farming connection and love
people that are you know interacting with their environment and not afraid
investigate what's going on so that's kind of what we're looking at here Evan
how's it going welcome to the stage love for you to introduce yourself and then
maybe here a comment or question that you have or interested in making to kind
of drive the conversation for the for the rest of the hour thank you I wanted
to thank everyone for having this room this is my favorite microbiology chat on
all clubhouse so I'm really grateful that everyone comes to share their
knowledge I had a question for you Craig would you mind going back over that
methionine tagging method is it you you glue a fluorescent tracer onto the
methionine and then see what uptakes and see what proteins it ends up in yeah so
it's the technique is let's see you actually that I can pull up the paper
that referenced it came out in June of 2019 the paper is called probing the
active fraction of soil microbes using B o and C a T FAC s so that's bond cat
and B o n C a T bond cats an acronym bio orthogonal non canonical amino acid
tagging and then the actual method for which they're able to you know utilize
that tagging through fluorescence dye is FAC s fluorescence activated cell
sorting it's a cell flow cell cytometry but basically in short they have a
methionine they modify the actual modification has this alkyl group I
believe I've the terminology is incredible it's something really
definitely dive into the the paper but they've the modification methionine
allows a fluorescent diet of far easily bind selectively and preferably allowing
it to pretty much be observed in this fluorescence activated cell sorting so
the paper I'll repeat it once again probing the active fraction of soil
microbiomes using bond cat FAC s and what's really amazing I think that
they've actually interpreted this and even to aquatic ecosystems so I think
one thing about it if you want to learn about this if you look up a paper on
Google Scholar or any other publication and look at the citations you can see
what other papers have referenced in see where they've taken this investigation
even further into other disciplines or aspects so it is once you kind of
getting once you kind of unlock another level of investigating going down rabbit
holes when you learn how to look at papers and assess them and find them
because you could very easily spend the better part of a day kind of going down
one rabbit hole on a certain technique or technology if you find a paper let's
say for maybe five years ago and then follow it's I take that follow the
follow the other papers that have cited it over the over those over the
following five years but yeah definitely I'm having that entry question in
detail was there anything particular to the actual the detail I believe the
actual that method of the fluorescent dye binding to that alkyl group is
called click chemistry like click like the actual button in general as well
yeah I just want to add there's a YouTube video I watched a while back it
came out like last year from there's a is a YouTube channel called micro
seminar and it's just like a bunch of like hour-long talks of microbiologists
talking about you know whatever stuff but they you know they're kind of
academic but there was there's one about a year ago or as a guy from
somewhere from Scandinavia or something but his talk was it was it was like an
aquatic ecology thing but it was using the bond cap FACS method and he kind of
he does a pretty good job explaining how how it does it and there's like you know
slides and diagrams so that was helpful for me because I'd heard about it you
know Craig had told me about it I didn't really get what was going on at all and
watching this made like you know conceptually made more sense so if you
go to the micro seminar YouTube channel and the guy's name is Roland Hatson
Pitchler or Hatson Pickler or something but it was a it was a presentation from
like last April so that's just that's another resource if you want to you know
sit back and let someone explain it to you in addition to trying to read the
primary literature yourself
oh thank you very much oh okay yeah the the I've actually got it here looked up
so if you want to dive into it the again like we mentioned the YouTube channels
micro seminar so my M and micro is capitalized and S's and seminar is
capitalized one word and the the talk itself is eco physiology of uncultured
sediment dwelling microbes revealed by substrate probably referring to that
this video cuts off before I click it but yeah definitely thank you I'll check
out Roland's talk and just a kind of orthogonal question for you Craig have
you do you know Blackie Migliosi I do know Blackie I'm actually good friends
with him I haven't seen him in person in a while I know he's been busy working
away but yeah him and I him and I him and I have a good friends and also some
of his his background at work especially work I did when he was down at Georgia
Tech kind of a lot of visualization and cell applications and kind of the
integrated system they were trying to build out with having like a greenhouse
there were mushrooms in it they'd also cultivate like spirulina edible allergy
and try to like emulate like an ecosphere where like you know the notion is that the
the fungi breathe like we do they breathe in oxygen breathe out carbon dioxide and then
you know algae since they are you know a predis like basically an ant progenitor of
I'd say progenitor but predecessor ancestor of plants more so being aquatic photosynthesizers
they consume carbon dioxide and put out oxygen but yeah Blackie's Blackie's awesome yeah that's
awesome I know he recently had his birthday I missed out unfortunately yeah I know him through
media stuff you should get back in touch with him he's supposed to come over to my backyard for a
barbecue this Saturday come on carpool I've got I've got so many more questions is is he gonna
bring his stump with the nails in it I want to play stumps really bad better he's been talking
about stumps for so long but but yeah thanks so much yeah anytime Evan and we'll leave the we'll
leave stumps for the mystery of the listeners there so all right yeah hammer it involves a
hammer nails and a stump yeah I know I think I think I think also some kind of fermented beverages
and spinning and tossing right can't give away all the secrets but yeah
Leighton you want to add anything to that uh any other aspects
uh no but you know I I just was uh I was just thinking to we should probably reset the room
real quick and just let people know that we're here talking about uh microbial ecology of the
living soil and how we are really just scratching the surface on this these new tools that are
becoming available that will really bring humanity to the next level hopefully within the next five
or six years or so but yeah there's there's a reset and were there any other follow-up questions
uh from anybody in the audience or Evan or Ryan I just had a general question uh have people started
plumbing the role of archaea in these webs with like these metagen metagenomic tools
it's it's something that I I think is it has been overlooked as well um they're incredibly
important especially with some fermentation we actually have a there's another person Tom who's
been on a couple times and I think he runs um another kind of group called essentially microbial
so he studies actually um anaerobes uh methanogen so ones actually do do kind of
kind of anaerobic methane metabolism um but but yes I think that's something that is is key or
there they're playing an important role and it's it's crazy to think about that archaea were
only a thing weren't even a thing up until the 70s when Carl Wu's uh formally understood them and
kind of did that work to look at uh family relationships of genes so I think I think
within the soil food web uh different ecology webs archaea which are you know they're in kind of
more extreme conditions um especially ones possibly even into the uh the the lower oxygen
gradients and even anoxic and playing some of the longer metabolism especially on kind of the more
the geological um time frame so I think that's something that is I think people are realizing
that that is something that needs to be looked into um you know we owe largely the advances in
molecular biology to an archaea uh thermos aqueous which was actually kind of extracted from a
geothermal event which allowed us to amplify DNA for genetic sequencing and working and the enzyme
that allows us to do that is a DNA polymerase um the process of this through called polymerase
chain reaction or PCR uh is using heat to cycle through these temperatures to allow you to
separate the strain of the DNA allow basically they basically separate because the the bonds
between them are hydrogen bonds the the bonds linking the nucleotides together are far more
stable and durable um but you go heat up heat up uh you would heat up the sample um the buffer that
the uh the DNA and the enzymes are in the DNA would separate uh kind of imagine a rungs of a ladder
kind of being pulled apart separate it and then you would slide in a very short um sequence of DNA
called a primer or an oligo nucleotide that would kind of be a start and stop point for a region of
interest and then this uh enzyme DNA polymerase would come along and then make a copy of that and
then you would cycle success successively and eventually uh DNA polymerase would bind to just
the copies because they'd be far shorter and be able to kind of click back together um a lot faster
than the bigger strand of DNA so what's amazing with this is that um through the cycling of
temperature um a lot of the polymerase to be were had available they would denature and break down
because the high temperature but lo and behold you have this archaea thermos aqueous living in a
geothermal hot spring whose enzymes can survive incredibly high temperature variances so it's
pretty amazing we use a enzyme from organisms that live in extreme environments to perform these um
these molecular functions that we can kind of replicate these uh a version of these natural
reactions that happen in every single organism on earth inside of a test tube so we could further
dive down the rabbit hole so that's that's kind of a little love letter to archaea kind of going off
evan's question and yeah i'd love to just pipe in um evan yes uh there are a few companies out there
that are starting to propagate um archaea for agricultural use um they have shown some really
interesting potential um to uh you know especially uh sodic soils or low nutrient soils i'm not sure
all of the interactions and interfaces but um yeah it's definitely something to keep an eye on and
we're very much uh kind of overlooking them because of our understanding that they just generally live
in in hostile environments that aren't suitable for for us anyway but i'm still waiting for some
more information from him about they were doing a bunch of studies uh to you know really try to
determine why it was working so well um and yet obviously the studies haven't been completed but
definitely keep your eyes open because that's going to be a whole new door to open up in in
better understanding again soil succession or or helping push soil succession toward fertility
so that was a great question i'm glad you asked that oh it craig i thought tom replied that he
might hop on tonight so we may have our special guest tom popping on at any time so possibly
and tom was the person i mentioned who's a he's a researcher looking into um methanogenic microbes
but also we do talk about a wide variety of kind of intuitions that we do have about
you know the interactions these microbes are not something that's straightforward and linear that
you know based upon certain conditions um they will form functions well they'll utilize genes
they have but are not apparently being utilized until the circumstances are stressful to help
them survive or even to the potential of meta metabolism so much like we uh as you know
individuals human beings you know we're 35 trillion cells um each one of our cells the same
dna but we have over we have several hundred uh different cell types um which all differentiate
your own kind of unique function and form which is important you know um you know your
muscle cells a muscle cell in your arm that's going to be like being able to expand and contract
as a certain shape and form a nerve cell in any part of your body has its own kind of morphology
and they play important functions based upon the regions of the genome they're expressing
so it is it is pretty important to kind of think about that ultimately they are kind of this kind
of this meta function and that in microbial communities based upon certain stressful events
you probably do have a functioning of a similar meta metabolism well they'll come together to
solve different roles based upon certain conditions of abundance of food or scarcity of food as well
so i think a lot of it now is we're looking into saying not just understanding the individual
microorganism kind of doing this function this comes in this comes out but also too what happens
when the condition is when the soil is in a certain condition what about what food is abundant what
other similar to similar types of microbes with different with similar to similar metabolic
functions are there how could they function in a kind of meta metabolism so that's that's something
that's pretty exciting as well that tom uh tom has tom has also been talking about and then also
some of the interesting things uh recently uh some bacterial fungal interactions that you know in the
soil food web if anyone's familiar with it um dr laning's contribution to organizing the the the
organisms that live in the soil from micro from microscopic to macroscopic based upon trophism
based upon how they acquire their food or energy oftentimes it's kind of very you know sorted in
columns in that capacity but we're realizing there are far more interconnections between the different
members um you know in the in the kind of the soul food web 1.0 it talks about that there's
interactions between the plants and bacteria and then between the plants and fungi and vice versa
but what's happening is that ultimately the bacteria and the fungi are intertwined the um
the bacteria actually live on and shuttle across the hyphae and uh interact and help help them to
um basically will feed off certain exudates or you know concentrations of exudates or materials
the fungi are producing which will then trigger response and the bacteria to help them you know
solubilize certain nutrients with the trade-on or vice versa the bacteria will provide provide
certain fungi with certain mineral elements or organic compounds which will help um certain
things with like gene like spore production or gene expression so it's pretty amazing because
we're realizing that you know these when you're getting into the microscopic cell
uh between fungi and bacteria you're getting kind of a similar composite organism situation that
it's never really been about a kind of singular organism existing by itself um but at the end of
the day everything is driven by you know the small trickle of energy coming from the sun it's just the
fact that you have um organisms that have the ability to perform a this reduction reaction of
pulling carbon dioxide out of the air using the energy from from photons coming down to pretty
much bind these carbons these these oxidative source and then also with water to pretty much
make these sugars which go on to make more complex proteins and exudates so it's pretty
amazing that all this is happening based upon being leveraged by the fact the kind of really
the magic of photosynthesis it is a spec is a spectacular amazing concept especially even into
the the kind of biophysical dynamics of how it's even possible but that that's another conversation
some of the biophysics of it is pretty wild but elegant and beautiful wow well said craig well
said and you guys neither one of you touched on horizontal gene transfer um so the understanding
of the interaction between two totally different species of bacteria exchanging genetic information
and then morphing into new or morphing maybe not the right word maybe advancing or
successionarily growing or evolving would be a better word but those interactions too are still
understudied and and how how can you study a single bacteria when it could morph into something else
within a day or maybe less so trying to focus in on traditional reduction science to analyze what
this exact species does i think you know we need to open our eyes to more of a broader view of this
you know looking at things in communities and not necessarily individuals but thank you for that
greg that was great and evan loved the questions my friend loved them leaf you want to pop pipe in
yeah just another note on horizontal gene transfer it's not only just bacteria to bacteria it can be
bacteria to fungus and you know between domains of life as well so there's a lot of genetic
fluidity between different types of organisms and kind of uh you know it's maybe it's a precursor to
what we as humans are going to start experiencing in the next few decades uh with you know more
advanced technology virtual reality uh you know like augmented implants you will be having where
it's kind of like what where does one individual end and the other begin and you know what's the
border of that and so these microbes have been kind of you know clear in the way for those
philosophical discussions which is exciting but i know yeah i know craig you uh had sent over this
paper that came out recently where it was about uh the uh mycorrhizal uh microbiome and there being
like the distinct bacterial species growing around mycorrhizae different than the soil around them
and so it's uh you know it's cool because it's you know fungi their stomach is external so it
makes sense that their microbiome is external too just like their gut there and now speaking of
mycorrhizae and how to study mycorrhizae and you know people trying to get into new directions of
studying mycorrhizae i'm going to make a shameless plug right now for the new episode of applied
mycology podcast coming out tomorrow with a friend of ours who's a researcher at uc riverside who's
trying to do pretty high level research on how mycorrhizae affect heavy metal uptake in plants
and other topics related to that which it turns out are not straightforward and simple and some
mycorrhizae will increase plant heavy metal uptake some will reduce it and that's kind of true of
various nutrients so if uh if you all want to want to listen to more blabbering on about mycorrhizae
and fungi check that out tomorrow but yeah that's all i have to say now leaf where is
that on is that a podcast on iphone or is it yeah it's on a pod yeah it's podcast so it's on any
podcast platform like apple or google podcast or you know whatever whatever those those apps are
spotify etc okay so you're you're blanketed that's great i look forward to listening to it my friend
um so do we have any other questions in the audience on any of the things that we've discussed
or are presently discussing okay well then uh i guess we uh we dive back into uh the future and
potential of unlocking some of these you know really important processes that are occurring on a
nano scale um and at a time speed or a time uh that we probably aren't even aware of um
and so yeah craig leaf and i have uh formed a study group about a year plus now ago to to discuss
these things and so you know we very much enjoy um you know letting letting the pop the public
understand a little bit more about um some of these processes that most people aren't even aware
of unless you're you know very much an academic or or you really love research and so you know
that was one of the reasons why i brought up these you know these tests tonight because i
think that that's going to be a really helpful thing in advancing um our understanding of how
the systems work and more importantly how we're going to begin to rehabilitate um some of the
devastation that we've left behind as a species uh worldwide so um yeah you know craig uh maybe we
should uh spend a little time talking a little bit more about or or life uh on on some of these
you know morphologies that that are that are occurring like like the lichen and the interaction
in organisms yeah you know something that just came up in my mind as you were saying that in
terms of uh you know what are the potentials are of having you know more affordable accessible
metagenomic technology available is well first i was thinking about how i was for for randomly for
another project last year i was reading a lot about duckweed the limna is the main genus of it
which is that actually utilized a lot in water filtration because it's a little it's like a
tiny little plant that floats on the surface of water it's like not an algae but it gets mistaken
for it a lot and duckweeds used a lot in remediation and they found that duckweed has an extremely
unique microbiome and its roots and it's like roots and its leaf tissue like much more so than
other plants where it's it's extremely predictable like what species of microbes and what proportions
you'll find them in duckweed and it's probably those microbes are the things that are actually
doing the water treatments in terms of you know breaking down contaminants in water and whatnot
and the fact you know this duckweed has such a specific microbiome it just got me thinking on
if we have these better you know more access these technologies one interesting thing would
be to potentially profile different plant species and figure out like which plant species have
really specific or unique like endophyte uh you know microbiomes in them and types of endophytic
fungi bacteria that grow inside of them like which ones are they more specific or generalist
also which ones are more influenced by or influencing the soil they go into because like
when a plant is transplanted somewhere a lot of times the like endophytes living in that plant
will then establish in the soil because a lot of endophytes go back and forth between the soil and
the inside of the plant so it makes me wonder if you know whether it's that like early successional
species have a more like vigorous microbiome that then kind of colonizes the soil whereas if it's
you know so like a mature like hardwood tree does that need to have the microbiome around it more
curated ahead of time and almost like that could be another characteristic to try to look at in
plants especially in the context of habitat restoration soil restoration things like that
we know certain species of plants are like really influential on the microbiome around them and can
kind of more set up shop and in different places and establish that as opposed to if there's other
plants that are not going to be able to influence it as much and are you know going to be less of
a ecosystem engineer than other types that's just something that up is a potential application of
these technologies characterizing plants in a way you know that's that's interesting um subject there
I was working with a gentleman named Luke Spangenberg at the university or excuse me
Santa Fe Community College so that's uh sc uh sfcc and he was doing some amazing work on growing out
terrestrial algaes for the use of bio inoculants and or fertilizers so slow release fertilizers so
these algaes do have a flagellum they are mobile they can live in they're obviously soil born but
they're they can live in aquatic environments as a matter of fact that's how he bred them out
and so we got down the rabbit hole a couple of times on really trying to bump the species ability
to survive in hostile terrains so he was typically growing them out with a traditional synthetic
fertilizer you know miracle grow whatever you want to call it and I was encouraging him to start
using some more organic forms that would be pre-bite pre-digested by biology or broken down
to a point that it was more readily available for the algae to take up and then what would be the
response when we put it out in the soil because something that was discussed a little bit earlier
but never really highlighted was the difference between in vivo and in vitro so in vitro means
that you're growing out a species in the perfect environment perfect food perfect light perfect
temperature no competition so you take an organism like that and you toss them out into the soil
and I typically refer that to as a biostimulant because there's no real proof that that that
bacteria for lack of organism is going to take hold it's kind of like taking the wealthy child
who's grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth and done nothing for himself and throwing him in
the ghetto he's not going to last very long but the opposite is true as well if you take someone
who's grown up in incredibly hostile tough environments with limited resources you toss
them into a place with unlimited resources they're gonna they're gonna do very well so again
this is kind of like how best to prepare you know some of these organisms whether they're plants
with a unique biome or whether they're a specific bacteria or maybe like archaea that had maybe
trans-horizontal genes transfer with with a soil organism that was more suitable for that environment
you know these are kinds of really deep questions that you know I know the boys and I love to chop
up and go down that rabbit hole and that's here again why we do this you know every every week is
to kind of you know expose some of the some of the information that we've gathered or bounced off of
each other and here's here's just a little anecdotal fun thing the dandelion is probably
the most hated plant in in in our united states because we don't like to see them on our lawns and
unfortunately we have way too much lawn that should be reduced to meadows as far as I'm
concerned but the dandelion has some incredible properties it's got medicinal properties
it is an indicator of nutrient deficit in the soil so when you have a tremendous amount of them
it's what they're trying to do is grow pull those nutrients up and then provide them as they die off
for the next successional plant to come into play another another one that's gotten a real bad rap
is crab grass now crab grass grows horizontally on the surface and actually has the ability to
excrete a herbicide so may I ask the question why are we using roundup and not something that's more
of a biological and less toxic way to perhaps reduce our dandelions any comments on that boy
uh yeah I don't I don't know if I'll be able to sell any any of the people I do work for on a
crab grass uh is this an herbicide but I like I like where that's going and uh I just a note uh
the number one cultivated plant in the United States is turf grass and uh I think the lawn care
industry it's like four billion dollars but that like that was like three or four years ago so
yeah it's not corn it's not soybeans it's grass which requires a tremendous amount of fertilizer
and water which is again why I wish we would come up with alternatives like meadows or actually
crops instead of lawns something that you know perhaps a pumpkin patch or melons anything that
that can provide locally grown food sources that can be given and shared with mongster neighbors
but that's just been something that I've been complaining about since um yeah for a number of
years now uh is reducing the amount of lawns and footprints of of turf grass uh in in the United
States of America um Craig did you have anything you wanted to chop up on that last one we're gonna
start um with respect to well it's without a doubt I think the biggest thing is that a lot of our
perceptions about you know I think it kind of stems from kind of gardening but also horticulture
where I think a lot of it is like a very neat plan notion oh like which is an extension to
being an architect or engineering this concept as well so I think there's a lot of maybe philosophy
that comes into it about how we look at built systems or the built environment and try to apply
that to the living environment and some you know some organisms some plants can kind of conform to
that notion a lot much easier than others and then kind of anything that's kind of doing its own thing
um is an aberration I think oftentimes the the phrase is a weed is a plant that a weed is kind
of a plant that is you know undesirable but more so it is a great amount of potential because it's
able to survive and environments that are incredibly uh us incredibly hostile or incredibly
challenging where where other plants you know can't can't handle that respect some kind of
butchering notion but basically uh just I don't know I'm just trying to put it down on particular
plants but I think the bigger kind of thing to to state and it's probably because I'm just
I've had a long day and I'm just trying to overthink it but I think yes I think definitely
we need to move more into a notion of reducing the obsession with a monoculture um working more
to understand that you know working towards a polyculture system understanding plant guilds
understanding that plants can work in unison together that you can have ornamental beauty but
it's not going to look like a flat plane that it can be you know complement you can be compliments
of kind of these meadow systems through these kind of polycultures and if you have a garden
um you know you can even integrate cover cropping the fact is that you know you don't it'd be far
easier to restart your garden because there's going to be plants there continually putting
down biomass into the soil putting exudates out of the soil throughout the entire year and also
too it's uh you know personally in my opinion I'd much rather look at you know plants that are
you know producing biomass and going through the winter and my temperate climate than just kind of
bare soil or things that have kind of gone gone to fallow or dried after they've kind of um they've
kind of gone to uh gone to flower than seed so I I think that definitely the notion is kind of we need
to break down the notion of the the kind of very um pristine uh and uniform and that doesn't mean
you can have something that's manicured you can have a you can have a polycultural system that is
beautiful and intricate and kind of chaotic but just controlled just enough based upon how the
planning has gone through but um I guess that's uh what I would add to that conversation I'm starting
to lose gas as the night goes on it's been a it's been a long day of uh shoveling chicken shit so
I love that Craig thank you thank you for sharing that and and yeah you know um I had the pleasure
of working with some pretty high-end landscape architects a few years back and you know it was
it was it was a difficult push to get them to think outside the box I was able to convince
some of them to to pollinator gardens and I think as a species humanity needs everybody should be
growing some type of wildflower mixes on their property to help support the indigenous insects
which will in turn support greater bird life and right up the right up the food ladder so you know
these are simple little things that people can do and they don't take away from anything it's not
like you're you know growing something that's ugly they they continuously produce I grew one out here
in southern California last year I haven't I haven't replanted it yet I was kind of hoping that
some of the ones that I planted last year went to seed um would would repopulate but it hasn't it
hasn't taken it hasn't filled in as much as I'd like to so I'll probably be receiving it shortly
but you know the the amount of indigenous insects that were coming around was amazing
had tons of butterflies all kinds of songbirds it's another thing that people really need to
start thinking about doing is bird feeders and and bird baths because they just bring in an
incredible diversity of of manure from the birds that are living on insect frats or insects so
that's basically like a very very rich nitrogen source right underneath the bird feeder that I
have here the plants were going crazy so it's you know again it's it's it's biomimicry of nature
thinking about the way you know the planet was before we had such incredible influence
and direction and and basically kind of pushed things out of the way to to humanize nature to
beautify nature and I think moving forward you know you know in probably you know soon if if not
within a year or two people are going to realize you know how important that that diversity actually
is and that you know this the discussions of climate change and you know people don't understand
that bare soil really is the the driving factor to extreme weather I'm not saying that the planet
isn't in flux I truly believe it is look at the ice ages so you know polar shifts I mean we know
this for a fact so it's you can blame humans or you can say humans encouraged it or influenced
it somehow but in the bigger picture everything is in is in flux but you know one of the best
things that we could do as a species is come together and demand that no soil be left bare
the the the amount of nitrogen that needs to be pumped into bare soil is insane when if you just
had a cover crop and you crimped and rolled it and left it in place as a living mulch most of that
could be reduced very quickly and better yet you're going to have aggregations aggregation is
the most important sign of fertility in the soil so aggregates are basically clumps of biomass
created by bacterial biofilms and by glomulin from fungi excreted
and what that does is it allows air to infiltrate and get down to help feed that biome of biology
and it allows the co2 that's generated by that biology to come back out and help support the
plant life and also more importantly it allows water to infiltrate it prevents erosion because
the water is being stored down in the soil system so therefore less irrigation is required especially
in some of these hotter drier areas and it can be so easily incorporated into to big ag and so
you know those are some some of these these processes that are being perhaps overlooked
and should be i think it should it should come from a i wish it would come from government but
i don't think it ever will i think that the government is unfortunately too focused on
generating money and less so on for the people by the people and so that that is probably the
reason why some of these policies haven't been pushed into place and so perhaps it has to come
from the grassroots from from groups like this and others saying that you know hey give us a hand
and let's not allow that to happen leaf did you want to pipe in on that because we're almost out
of time yeah yeah no closing thought i'm actually i'm actually going to go back and reel it back to
a more uh more innocent and innocuous place which is the uh concept of pollinator gardens i remember
talking to these landscape architects once and they're saying that and i don't know i don't know
this is true or not i just i throw it out you i'll throw it out there to get your opinion on it
but i'm talking about the idea that it can sometimes be uh not the best land management
strategy to have like a specific pollinator garden in the landscape where you got like all the native
pollinator plants right here and then they're like not the other places because it's almost
like creating a trap for the native pollinators because you've got like this pollinator garden
all the pollinators are there it's like they're gonna get all eaten by the predators because it'll
be really easy to find it's almost like having a red light district or something
the implication is you want like distributed pollinator gardens around so it's not so obvious
where to find them all but yeah uh it reminded me that i hadn't thought of that in a few years
until you brought it up there but yeah i think we're uh at 8 59 so uh i want to hear your rebuttal
to that laden and then we'll probably wrap it up um yeah no i there is there is some merit to that
but not a much so basically what happens with pollinator gardens is you're bringing in the local
indigenous predators so not only are you creating areas for the bees to um you know collect pollen
but but you're also encouraging natural predator bugs so like the diversity so some of the bugs
will be living there at night some of the bugs and they'll be going off to forest during the day
and then the pollinators will come in and they will collect the pollen from those and then they
will fly off so it's really a multi-tiered kind of way to look at it and again it's got to be uh
it can't be monoculture culture it's got to be polyculture it's got to have as much diversity
as you can and yes by all means put a put three or four of them up there's no reason
or yard so anyway that's six o'clock i know i'm pretty spent this is my podcast thursdays
and i know craig is banged up because that was the first time i've ever heard him slow down
so uh that being said i i i don't know if peter's back uh peter are you around
um peter are you around did he get it yeah so i guess uh i guess he's he must
do you have covid cedar now i'm back so he was getting negative for clean
uh his daughter it was my six-year-old my six-year-old needs to get tested for school
that reopens next week so we stuck a q-tip up her nose and i rubbed it around for
15 seconds per nostril that was fun
anyway yeah just go ahead and wrap it up and thank you all for coming and uh please don't
hesitate to join next week we'll be doing the same time four o'clock pacific standard time through 6
p.m um and uh thanks for coming all right thank you everyone and thanks to the uh youtube audience
which has been having their own side conversation the whole time and uh keeping it pg 13 so i
appreciate that take care everyone have a great night all right see you guys very much
all right see you everyone it's time for dinner with the kids
all right let me kill that broadcast and have a good night
