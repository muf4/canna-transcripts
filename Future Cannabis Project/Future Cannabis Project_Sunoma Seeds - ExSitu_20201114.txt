[00:04.800 --> 00:12.000]  Oh, hello. I believe we are live. Can someone give me a thumbs up in the chat
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.420]  if you see me and hear me? I see the countdown going or the... Jiggy Norris, Jim F,
[00:21.420 --> 00:28.300]  yeehaw. Okay, Overgrow, I assume that's a thumbs up and we are live. Welcome for an
[00:28.300 --> 00:35.260]  impromptu Saturday afternoon conversation with Evan from Whole Plant
[00:35.260 --> 00:41.340]  Wellness and Sonoma Seeds. He's one of the breeders in the group and behind him
[00:41.340 --> 00:55.060]  right now is what? This is the Kickboxer. So it's a hybrid of a Gummy Punch and a
[00:55.060 --> 01:02.400]  Hohokan Tai. Got it. You want to tell us a little bit about it? Yeah, so like I
[01:02.400 --> 01:08.140]  said, it's a hybrid of Gummy Punch and Hohokan Tai. Gummy Punch... Actually, let's
[01:08.140 --> 01:14.820]  take a step back. Where are you and kind of, because someone asked if it's
[01:14.820 --> 01:19.540]  soil or hydro and I was like, let's just start with where you are and how you're creating growth.
[01:20.020 --> 01:29.940]  This is all soil. This is classic outdoor NorCal style, whole soil, all organic pesticides.
[01:29.940 --> 01:39.180]  I can do a quick shot. You can see they're in seven gallon pots because I
[01:39.180 --> 01:44.820]  was testing this genetic. That's not what I grow in for production, but I don't
[01:44.820 --> 01:47.860]  want to give too much space to something because I'm unsure of how it's going to
[01:47.860 --> 01:54.660]  do. I just give them like a five to seven gallon pot and then if they crush it,
[01:54.660 --> 02:01.060]  then I know there's something to keep looking at. Right. Okay, so and just
[02:01.060 --> 02:06.340]  quickly, your audio changed when we went... Did you touch anything on your audio or
[02:06.340 --> 02:12.940]  is it still the same? You haven't touched anything? I put a Bluetooth speaker on so
[02:12.940 --> 02:20.210]  I could hear you a little better. You want me to turn that off? Yeah. Okay, let me hear you.
[02:26.180 --> 02:32.820]  Can you hear me? That's much better. Okay, yeah. So sorry about that. Should I go over what I was
[02:32.820 --> 02:40.500]  just saying again? Sure, let's start from the top. So what you see here is basically a classic NorCal
[02:40.580 --> 02:50.260]  style outdoor grow. It's full sun, in soil, all organic, no pesticides in Sonoma County.
[02:51.140 --> 02:58.900]  And these particular plants are in seven gallon plastic containers just for testing purposes
[02:59.940 --> 03:03.860]  because this is the first time I actually grew out the strain outside.
[03:04.980 --> 03:08.260]  I didn't really know what it was going to do, so I just kind of give it a smaller pot.
[03:08.500 --> 03:13.220]  To just squeeze it in wherever I can. And if it does well in those conditions,
[03:13.220 --> 03:16.340]  then I know it's something I can look into a little further.
[03:18.020 --> 03:20.020]  Well, I think we just...
[04:14.300 --> 04:20.300]  Wow, that's trippy. What's going on? Oh yeah, you got two Peters. Yeah.
[04:21.660 --> 04:27.660]  And it looks like the second one is zoomed in. Yeah, give me... All right, what...
[04:29.420 --> 04:37.580]  Ah, there we go. Okay, that was trippy. Yeah, what happened? Okay, so you were talking and
[04:37.580 --> 04:46.460]  you lost me at some point, but why don't you take three? Third time's a charm, right? Right.
[04:48.220 --> 04:53.740]  So basically what I was saying is this is just a typical style NorCal outdoor grow, full sun,
[04:54.300 --> 05:04.380]  full soil, all organic, no pesticides. There's really nothing too crazy behind it. All natural
[05:04.380 --> 05:11.260]  farming and JADAM principles, but these particular plants are in a seven gallon container. I'm trying
[05:11.260 --> 05:20.300]  to get it in the picture here. They're just in testing pots just to keep things from overgrowing.
[05:20.380 --> 05:28.700]  I don't grow most of my garden in pots. It's most of my gardens in the ground,
[05:28.700 --> 05:32.700]  but because I'm unsure of how these were going to do this year, I'd give them a small pot.
[05:34.220 --> 05:41.740]  Got it. Okay. And so what has... So can you talk about the lineage of the Kickboxer and then grow
[05:42.460 --> 05:50.700]  what you've noticed? So the Kickboxer is a cross of our flagship Gummy Punch, which is a
[05:51.260 --> 06:00.460]  modern day hybrid of Gummy Bear and Purple Punch 2.0. And we took that as the mom and crossed it
[06:00.460 --> 06:11.260]  to a male O'Hawken Thai that we inherited from a local old time old grower. He's been growing the
[06:11.260 --> 06:16.380]  same O'Hawken Thai since the seventies or eighties when his brother used to fly a cargo plane back
[06:16.380 --> 06:24.140]  and forth from picking up O'Hawken Thai. But there's actually a backstory posted on my Instagram
[06:24.140 --> 06:28.220]  if you want to read it. Well, actually, can you give us the backstory? Because it's kind of pretty
[06:28.220 --> 06:32.860]  cool. Yeah, the backstory... It's not cool for the guy, but it's interesting, I should say.
[06:32.860 --> 06:41.660]  Paraphrasing, it comes from a guy named Bruno Flake was his nickname. And him and his brother
[06:42.220 --> 06:48.780]  were going back and forth in cargo planes, delivering and smuggling cannabis from, I guess,
[06:48.780 --> 06:56.780]  Mexico, where they were getting O'Hawken Thai. And they would take seeds out of the best batches
[06:57.340 --> 07:05.180]  that they liked, and they would grow them every year. And they were doing that in the eighties,
[07:05.180 --> 07:11.260]  maybe the late seventies. So ever since then, they've been every year recreating seeds,
[07:12.140 --> 07:18.460]  selecting for the fastest finishing, best smoking in Northern California climate,
[07:19.020 --> 07:21.900]  because they were based out of Sonoma County, which is where they were farming.
[07:22.860 --> 07:34.620]  So the O'Hawken Thai is a California acclimated land race sativa, more or less. So it will finish
[07:34.620 --> 07:41.660]  in Northern California or similar environments. I actually had some friends in Maine finish it
[07:41.660 --> 07:53.780]  this year and they harvested it the first week of October. Wow. Okay. And I think also part of the
[07:53.780 --> 08:01.220]  story was the brother of Bruno had gotten arrested at some point along the line. So the strain has
[08:01.220 --> 08:08.660]  been kept alive for all these years after the fact of them smuggling, because it's a memory of his
[08:08.660 --> 08:15.540]  brother who's incarcerated. He should be actually getting released in the next three or four years.
[08:15.540 --> 08:20.660]  If I'm getting that correct. I don't know them personally. I'm just kind of going off of rumor.
[08:28.140 --> 08:35.900]  All right. So I'm trying to queue up. Give me some technical time to get the images going. But
[08:37.100 --> 08:47.660]  okay. So you want to continue on the kickboxer and I'll pull up some images and then we'll move
[08:47.660 --> 08:58.860]  on. Yeah. So what I've seen so far with the strain is that it will grow and finish within a 10 week
[08:58.860 --> 09:10.220]  period. I've tried it indoors once and I've tried it outdoors once and they both showed promise.
[09:10.220 --> 09:18.700]  The indoors started to throw some bananas in the end. So I really wouldn't recommend, you know,
[09:18.700 --> 09:22.780]  just planting and forgetting it. I think you're going to need to do some hunting to weed out the
[09:22.780 --> 09:33.820]  most resilient of the plants in that pack that you get. But outdoors, no problems at all. Absolutely
[09:33.820 --> 09:41.820]  no hermaphrodism, no issues with mold in either indoor or outdoor. And they just went through a
[09:41.820 --> 09:48.140]  big rainstorm last night and no branches broke. I mean, you can see ones flopping over here,
[09:48.700 --> 09:54.940]  but it's not breaking. So very strong branches, likes to stretch as you can see.
[09:56.780 --> 10:03.580]  It's behind me. It's probably standing eight feet tall and a seven gallon pot. So
[10:05.100 --> 10:10.060]  if you put this in the ground, I would expect to go, you know, 10 foot minimum.
[10:10.620 --> 10:23.900]  As far as what you can expect for phenotypes in this, there are, I've got three testers here.
[10:23.900 --> 10:30.780]  One is straight purple, like the Gummy Punch will get. One is all green and one is kind of
[10:30.780 --> 10:34.540]  somewhere in the middle. It's kind of getting purple and green, which is more like leaning
[10:34.540 --> 10:41.420]  towards the how the O'Hawk and Tai grew outdoors. So there's definitely going to be some variability
[10:41.980 --> 10:48.220]  in the expression. It's a first generation cross. I haven't done too much selective breeding on it.
[10:49.020 --> 10:57.100]  It's just, it's a strong matchup right from the start. The O'Hawk and Tai is very resistant to
[10:57.100 --> 11:03.020]  Botrytis. That really helped out the Gummy Punch because, you know, the Gummy Punch, it gets very
[11:03.020 --> 11:13.420]  dense. It grows almost like a golf ball. It's just, it's very hard. So, you know, in the wetter,
[11:13.420 --> 11:19.900]  colder times of the month, they can get a little moldy, but the Kickboxer, not showing any mold at
[11:19.900 --> 11:27.020]  all. So it seems like a really good matchup of a new school hybrid and an old school Landry Sativa.
[11:27.580 --> 11:33.340]  Got it. And someone was commenting that you were whacking that cola with your entire hand. So
[11:33.340 --> 11:41.980]  what's your hand smell like? Smells like, like earthy sandalwood kind of haze. If you're familiar
[11:41.980 --> 11:51.260]  with like C5 or Cuban Black Haze or Pith, it's got that kind of smell. It's not very fruity,
[11:51.900 --> 11:57.900]  but it's, it's got some stank, that's for sure. And just quickly for people asking what this is,
[11:57.900 --> 12:05.500]  it's Kickboxer and its parents are Gummy Punch F2 and O'Hawk and Tai. Well, actually,
[12:06.220 --> 12:13.820]  the Gummy Punch F2 isn't the parent of this one. Oh, sorry. But the Gummy Punch F2 are the,
[12:13.820 --> 12:19.580]  what I have available as far as seeds in the Gummy Punch line. Okay. It's a Gummy Punch and a
[12:20.540 --> 12:24.860]  O'Hawk and Tai. Yeah. The mother of this is our Keeper Gummy Punch that we've been
[12:25.740 --> 12:32.620]  working for the last three years. Got it. Okay. Or two years. I selected it in 2018.
[12:34.620 --> 12:39.740]  Uh, talk about the coloring. Cause you mentioned, so, so one of its parents is,
[12:39.740 --> 12:44.940]  I guess, very purple and the other is not. And so let me try to get, get it in the frame here.
[12:45.900 --> 12:47.420]  Get a live, live, uh,
[12:50.060 --> 12:56.780]  shot. Can I turn my camera around? Yeah. You got to hit the, um, the sprocket looking cam.
[12:56.780 --> 13:10.320]  Oh, okay. Yeah. Flip it. So while you're doing it. Oh, I see that camera. Yeah. There you go.
[13:11.280 --> 13:19.760]  Boom. All right. Okay. So turn it 90 degrees like a TV. Look at that. So that's the purple one.
[13:19.760 --> 13:25.040]  This is the one that gets most purple. Um, this is the cola that's been flopping over
[13:25.040 --> 13:33.920]  that I just smacked with my hand. Um, it's November what? 13th or 14th now. And it could go longer.
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.200]  I'm going to try to push it as long as I can because I like to let my strains go.
[13:40.640 --> 13:47.680]  To the end, if I have the time. Um, but here's the other one who's kind of like the halfway
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.520]  purple and green. This one seems to have more resin than that. Uh, last phenotype as well
[13:58.340 --> 14:02.500]  supported by my Arbor. Other than that, no trellis.
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.860]  This one didn't, didn't fall into the Arbor. So it's flopping over.
[14:08.020 --> 14:15.820]  Uh, and this is the green Fino also very resinous for a sativa
[14:17.580 --> 14:24.710]  and you can't wait to smoke it. I haven't smoked it outdoors yet. I've only smoked it indoors.
[14:26.390 --> 14:32.070]  So I'm looking forward to everything came out really, really good from this, uh, last season.
[14:32.070 --> 14:48.720]  So yeah, you guys saw my little rolling tray there for a minute, didn't you? Yeah. Enrique
[14:53.130 --> 14:58.810]  Enrique said, I can smell it through your lens. Yeah. It's a, it's a really nice one. It's,
[14:59.370 --> 15:05.690]  it's true to the sativa profile that people should expect.
[15:06.970 --> 15:10.250]  Doesn't smell like Jack at all. Nothing weird like that.
[15:17.570 --> 15:22.530]  Some high, they're like, they're pushing eight foot tall right now. And they're in a seven gallon
[15:22.610 --> 15:35.420]  pot. Yeah, definitely a true narrow leaf drug type plant. Um, even though that the gummy punch is
[15:35.420 --> 15:39.340]  in to get heavy, it didn't seem to fatten up the leaves too much from the O'Hawken.
[15:40.700 --> 15:46.700]  Honestly, most of the expression is on the O'Hawken side. Um, but the gummy punch really
[15:46.700 --> 15:51.260]  just bolstered the, uh, bag appeal and the density of the flowers.
[15:51.740 --> 15:57.820]  Okay. So unlucky, uh, is going to lead us into the next one. So why don't we,
[15:57.820 --> 16:04.940]  why don't we go to the O'Hawken tie? Um, but before we go there, let me just do one last,
[16:04.940 --> 16:14.620]  uh, one last visual walkthrough of, uh, of the kickboxer, which is what we were just looking at
[16:15.580 --> 16:25.790]  or talking about. And so you are imminently going to smoke this, right?
[16:26.990 --> 16:31.550]  Uh, no, I can't yet. It's still growing. I haven't had the chance to dry it yet.
[16:32.430 --> 16:35.790]  I said, so how much longer? I thought you were imminently chopping.
[16:36.830 --> 16:43.870]  No, I mean, I could right now it's definitely finished enough, but the way that the weather's
[16:43.870 --> 16:49.070]  been, I kind of want to push it as long as I can to see what it'll do in its later end.
[16:49.630 --> 16:54.990]  Yeah. Um, a lot of the times these plants, once they get tired, they'll start to
[16:54.990 --> 16:58.590]  harm on you. And I'm kind of trying to make sure they don't do that.
[16:59.870 --> 17:16.590]  Right. That's very thoughtful. Um, okay. So, uh, where is my hoodie? Uh, we do ship to Canada
[17:16.590 --> 17:22.510]  and we're adding more breeders every week at the link below. And I have some announcements,
[17:22.510 --> 17:31.550]  uh, pretty imminently. Um, yeah, I always try to do that. And I'm like, you're very good at, uh,
[17:32.270 --> 17:35.470]  yes. Look at that. You're even following it. He's a pro.
[17:35.470 --> 17:38.830]  You got it. You got to put me on one of those game shows for kids.
[17:38.830 --> 17:44.910]  Yeah. So heuristic value asks how long you like to, what, what can you talk about? Let's start
[17:44.910 --> 17:50.110]  with harvest, dry and cure. So what are you looking for? I mean, obviously you're trying to
[17:50.110 --> 17:55.950]  push this for a specific reason, but under normal circumstances, what are you looking for that tells
[17:55.950 --> 18:00.110]  you a plant's ready to harvest and then what's your drying and curing process?
[18:00.110 --> 18:11.630]  So, you know, the, the, the best way to, to, to know is to kind of balance a few different things.
[18:11.630 --> 18:16.830]  You want to look at the resin heads to see how they're appearing. Like if they're brown and
[18:16.830 --> 18:22.750]  they're starting to like bend over like a dead sunflower, that's an indicator that they are
[18:22.750 --> 18:29.550]  finished, but some strains won't go Amber. Some strains won't bend over and they're still mature.
[18:29.550 --> 18:35.790]  So that's why I say it's a balance of, you know, observing the resin head at the time of you want
[18:35.790 --> 18:43.390]  to harvest, but also observing the plant because the, the plant will start to die back when it's
[18:43.390 --> 18:50.990]  ready. Like a tomato or a cucumber or anything else, you know, the, the, the plants will start
[18:50.990 --> 18:58.190]  to lose that intense growth appearance. The turgidity of the leaves is like, like the, you
[18:58.190 --> 19:04.030]  know, the, the way the leaves look, some will start to droop more as they get closer to harvest. And
[19:06.670 --> 19:12.350]  after a while, I mean, you just kind of get a feel for it. And I've been growing long enough
[19:12.350 --> 19:20.750]  to just kind of know when it's time, but I always tell people, you don't have like a two day window.
[19:20.750 --> 19:27.950]  It's like a two to three week window of when you can harvest. So, you know, if you feel like it's
[19:27.950 --> 19:32.750]  time to harvest, but you feel like it's a little too early, push it another week and see what it
[19:32.750 --> 19:38.670]  starts and see what it does. You know, another thing you can do is you can harvest the tops of
[19:38.670 --> 19:43.550]  the plants before the lowers, because the tops will start to finish before the lowers,
[19:44.990 --> 19:59.050]  much like a tomato or other vegetable. That's what I look for when the plant's growing. So
[19:59.050 --> 20:03.530]  do you want me to move into how I like to store it when it's drying, or should I kind of keep going
[20:03.530 --> 20:10.970]  on that? Either one. I mean, if you have more to say on that, we got time. I mean, it's hard to
[20:10.970 --> 20:16.730]  fill. I could talk. I mean, people like long form. All right. How about a raise of hands? Who wants
[20:16.730 --> 20:28.570]  the long form extended version? City Soul likes the progressive harvest method. Yeah, because by
[20:28.570 --> 20:36.250]  doing the progressive harvest method, you're able to actually taste the plant at two stages
[20:36.250 --> 20:42.650]  of ripeness. Also, you can take the top on its earlier side and then leave the lowers for taking
[20:42.650 --> 20:48.410]  on the later side. So you can get an idea for when you want to harvest that strain for the future.
[20:49.530 --> 20:56.010]  Because I, my gummy punch, for example, if you harvest it in the beginning of October,
[20:56.010 --> 21:04.250]  it won't be purple and it'll have more of a gassy kind of a, what I call like a
[21:05.130 --> 21:12.890]  OG-esque kind of taste to it. But if you let it go to November, it'll get purple and it'll
[21:12.890 --> 21:20.090]  taste more grapey. And other strains, you know, there'll be more of an uplifting effect on the
[21:20.090 --> 21:25.770]  earlier side of harvest and more of a sedative effect on the later end of the spectrum.
[21:26.490 --> 21:32.650]  So by doing the progressive harvesting, you're kind of enabling yourself to get best of both
[21:32.650 --> 21:41.450]  worlds in some cases. And also, if you're a good grower, you might've grown too much weed to dry
[21:41.450 --> 21:48.650]  in your dry room. So often we will have to harvest half of the plant first, dry it, move it out,
[21:48.650 --> 21:52.010]  then harvest the rest of the plant because our dry space is limited.
[21:54.730 --> 22:04.970]  Right. Okay. So how about kind of your, you know, drying? Like, are you, do you kind of try to bring
[22:04.970 --> 22:10.250]  it down fast in the early stages and kind of like slow it down like a plane coming in the land later
[22:10.250 --> 22:16.010]  on as you need? What I like to do is I like to just cut it. And if I can do the whole plant,
[22:16.010 --> 22:22.090]  I will. That's ideal. Roots and all even clean the roots off with all the dirt,
[22:22.650 --> 22:31.770]  but that's not always feasible. So if the plant's too big, break it down into smaller chunks,
[22:31.770 --> 22:40.650]  but I like to go bigger pieces rather than smaller. And when I cut them, I'm usually cutting
[22:40.650 --> 22:47.450]  them and hanging them right away. I don't let them sit on the floor. I don't smash them in a
[22:47.450 --> 22:54.250]  tote. I hang them on a coat hanger and I carry them into the dry room on a coat hanger. I don't
[22:54.250 --> 23:01.930]  want to smash those resin heads. I don't want to crush the bud at all. Sometimes it happens because
[23:01.930 --> 23:08.730]  you just have too much and it's okay. It doesn't ruin the bud, but it's just much,
[23:08.730 --> 23:15.450]  it's just artisanal quality when you don't smush it. It's that subtle difference that makes
[23:17.370 --> 23:22.090]  a noticeable difference in the end when you're smoking it. So that's what I like to do when I
[23:22.090 --> 23:29.610]  can. And then it goes into a room that's ideally 60 degrees Fahrenheit, 60% relative humidity.
[23:30.730 --> 23:36.970]  Of course, it's not always those conditions, but that's my baseline. It gets colder during the
[23:36.970 --> 23:41.930]  night and it gets warmer during the day, but I don't want it to ever go above 75.
[23:44.970 --> 23:51.370]  Also, adversely, the colder it gets, the drier it'll get. So you got to be careful of too cold
[23:51.370 --> 23:59.690]  also. I like to do 60 and 60 because it enables a nice long, slow, dry, and it takes about 14 to 21
[23:59.690 --> 24:06.570]  days typically. Sometimes it can take as short as seven to 10 days if they're very small pieces
[24:06.650 --> 24:14.970]  or bucked down, not on the branch. So it has a lot of variability. There's things that influence
[24:15.930 --> 24:24.010]  the dry time, but you can expect typically 10 to 21 days at 60 and 60.
[24:26.010 --> 24:35.440]  Oh, I think I know what I did. Hold on. All right. The Pakistan,
[24:35.440 --> 24:38.160]  people were asking about the Pakistan treasure.
[24:39.120 --> 24:42.080]  And I just realized, what was the price on those?
[24:42.800 --> 24:44.800]  125 for 15 seeds.
[24:44.800 --> 24:48.480]  125. That's why it wasn't showing up because I didn't put the price in.
[24:50.160 --> 24:53.920]  Sorry. Okay. Everybody in 10 seconds, that will be...
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.560]  Yeah. People were like, it's still not showing up. Okay.
[25:02.800 --> 25:08.960]  Sorry. I'm troubleshooting for the people on the chat right now while we talk.
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.600]  Lewis wants to know what your grinder of choice is.
[25:14.480 --> 25:15.840]  Oh, Mendel mulcher.
[25:16.400 --> 25:16.900]  Yeah.
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.240]  You can't go wrong. And this one is special because they don't make this design anymore.
[25:22.640 --> 25:31.840]  It's a wider edge and it actually has some like chunks taken out of it so you can grab it without
[25:31.840 --> 25:37.840]  slipping, but they don't make this design anymore. And I don't know why, because it's way better than
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.760]  the design they have now. I've had this thing for, I think, five years.
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.170]  And it's still as sharp as it was when I first got it. It's an incredible grinder.
[25:50.330 --> 25:55.900]  I can't remember. Did we finish up on drying and curing?
[25:57.900 --> 25:59.740]  No. I mean, I could go further.
[25:59.740 --> 26:00.540]  Yeah. Let's keep going.
[26:00.540 --> 26:07.500]  So where I left off was that I like to hang it in a room that's 60 and 60, 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
[26:07.500 --> 26:15.340]  60% relative humidity. But the other thing that I like is there's no windows in my room that I dry
[26:15.740 --> 26:21.580]  in. So sunlight doesn't come in and it's in a cellar more or less. So it stays very consistent.
[26:21.580 --> 26:23.020]  There's not a lot of fluctuation.
[26:23.020 --> 26:23.980]  Yeah. I like that.
[26:23.980 --> 26:27.180]  And that's important because if you have a room that's, you know,
[26:28.140 --> 26:35.020]  fluctuating between 60 and 80 degrees or something on a regular basis, the bud is, I mean, it'll dry
[26:35.020 --> 26:40.140]  and you'll get your eye, but it just, it's not as good. So I like to hang it in a room that's
[26:40.940 --> 26:47.580]  the bud is, I mean, it'll dry and you'll get your eye, but it just, you'll lose subtle flavor and
[26:48.140 --> 26:56.460]  it'll just not be as smooth as it could be otherwise. So sometimes you can't help it
[26:56.460 --> 26:58.860]  and that's okay. It doesn't mean throw the weed away.
[27:00.940 --> 27:05.740]  Yeah. I always wondered why, you know, I don't know what the cost is, but like, if I had to do
[27:05.820 --> 27:18.140]  a Nevada indoor grow, couldn't you just dig down and basically, you know, start 20 feet down and go
[27:18.140 --> 27:21.180]  to six feet down or something?
[27:21.180 --> 27:23.100]  Yeah. You're just building a root cellar at that point.
[27:23.100 --> 27:24.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[27:24.380 --> 27:30.860]  And yeah, those conditions are ideal. There actually might be a little on the cooler side,
[27:30.860 --> 27:38.940]  to be honest, because 50 to 55, I mean, it's good, but it's just a little too cold.
[27:39.500 --> 27:43.260]  Well, but you figure with your, I mean, we're talking indoors. So like with your lights and
[27:43.260 --> 27:47.740]  all the other things that throw off heat, you're kind of getting creeping back up to...
[27:47.740 --> 27:52.940]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll do that all the time in my grow rooms. Like I'll use the lights or
[27:53.820 --> 27:56.940]  the dehumidifier to add heat in certain cases.
[27:57.340 --> 28:03.100]  I mean, actually, if you were in Nevada, you could just pull fresh air heat in, I mean,
[28:03.100 --> 28:08.780]  through filtration. But if it's 110 degrees outside or during the day, you know...
[28:10.780 --> 28:15.340]  And here, you know, at nighttime, you got the free AC by pulling air in.
[28:18.440 --> 28:21.080]  Not by you, but up in Sonoma County.
[28:24.220 --> 28:28.780]  Yeah. Dennis is trimming some rebel grown double OG sour right now.
[28:28.780 --> 28:31.180]  That's some good weed. That is some good weed.
[28:32.060 --> 28:41.180]  I did some breeding with double OG sour back in 2017, and those were probably the first of
[28:41.180 --> 28:48.540]  our strains to sell out. They went quick. Philippe is critical of your joint.
[28:51.100 --> 28:54.540]  Six out of 10. I mean, look at this. It's perfect.
[28:55.420 --> 29:05.700]  I would be satisfied with that. I love my friend Larry rolls just monstrously fat tight joints.
[29:07.300 --> 29:14.660]  You know what? I used to roll bigger joints, and I like to roll modest and more of the joints
[29:14.660 --> 29:21.140]  rather than one big one. I smoke all day long. I mean, I wake up...
[29:21.380 --> 29:30.420]  So Randy, our Olympic panel, Randy is giving you a better score. How about we throw out...
[29:30.420 --> 29:33.620]  Everybody rate his joint, and we'll throw out the high and the low.
[29:37.040 --> 29:41.280]  Thank you, Randy. You're a gentleman and a scholar, sir.
[29:43.920 --> 29:44.420]  So...
[29:47.360 --> 29:51.120]  Oh, Eric. Oh, Eric. My God. We got a couple eights in here.
[29:53.520 --> 29:56.320]  Although, Brad...
[29:57.680 --> 30:00.400]  Whoa. Brad coming in hot with a double digit.
[30:02.640 --> 30:03.520]  Thanks, man.
[30:03.520 --> 30:05.920]  Luis, wait. You can't change here. It wasn't...
[30:09.920 --> 30:15.520]  I thought it was... I know it was Philippe who said, yeah, Luis is a little more...
[30:16.800 --> 30:22.320]  All right. We got all sorts of grades. Now we have the partial scores.
[30:23.040 --> 30:30.480]  I'm happy with these scores. I haven't... I'm happy. I'm still on the better side of the scale.
[30:31.600 --> 30:33.600]  I haven't fallen below five with one person.
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.680]  Oh, there's Cash. Hey, Cash.
[30:41.440 --> 30:47.600]  Okay. So we did a little detour through your drying and curing process.
[30:48.160 --> 30:51.280]  Or how about let's go to curing. Kind of how long...
[30:53.120 --> 31:01.520]  So what I like to do is once the buds, the branches that are hanging,
[31:02.800 --> 31:10.880]  once the stems start to snap, not to... They can sometimes bend, but as long as they don't
[31:10.960 --> 31:18.480]  like have like a rubbery or like a flexy feel to it, I like to take the branch off the line
[31:18.480 --> 31:24.560]  and put it into a standard black and yellow tote that you get from a hardware store.
[31:26.160 --> 31:33.440]  And I like to fill them up all the way, if I can, with just flour, no plastic
[31:34.560 --> 31:37.200]  beside the tote, like no bag is what I'm saying.
[31:38.160 --> 31:46.240]  And then I'll just let it sit in that tote and burp as needed if it's not perfectly dry
[31:47.360 --> 31:54.000]  until it's trimmed. But I trim pretty quickly. I usually don't let it sit around too long.
[31:54.000 --> 32:01.200]  I like to do something with it pretty quickly. But I have left stuff untrimmed in the tote
[32:02.000 --> 32:11.120]  for six months and it keeps very well. It preserves best on the branch untrimmed.
[32:14.400 --> 32:17.760]  I don't understand the science behind it, but it seems like the leaves
[32:18.560 --> 32:22.000]  oxidize before the flowers do in that situation.
[32:24.000 --> 32:30.320]  So you get a lot better terpene preservation in that way and color preservation that way.
[32:31.840 --> 32:39.200]  But if you're like me and you trim it right away, once I get it back from the trimmer,
[32:39.200 --> 32:45.440]  I usually just let it sit in turkey bags in the same tote, in the same dry room,
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.920]  because the conditions are perfect for storing at the 60 to 60.
[32:53.910 --> 32:59.190]  And when you do trim, do you like a tight trim, a loose trim? I mean, what kind of trim?
[32:59.670 --> 33:07.350]  Oh, I'm not. I'm probably one of the best farmers you can find as far as what I ask for in trimming
[33:07.350 --> 33:16.550]  because I really don't care. I mean, I shouldn't say I don't care. I should just say that I have a
[33:19.750 --> 33:22.550]  I'm flexible in what I'm willing to accept. You know, it's
[33:23.030 --> 33:31.430]  I use the same trimmer every year and she's experienced. So whatever she does is usually
[33:31.430 --> 33:37.590]  the right thing. I don't ask her to do tighter or looser. She just kind of knows what's right.
[33:37.590 --> 33:45.120]  I just ask to take all the leaves off, you know. I want the bud to look like it does naturally.
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.760]  I'm not trying to manipulate its appearance by trimming.
[33:48.400 --> 33:54.480]  First of all, Zach, that hair, I'm very jealous of it. Different types of plastic?
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.680]  I don't think so. I don't think so. And definitely not in a way that humans will perceive.
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.440]  Maybe scientifically, like statistically, if you were to laboratory test it and
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.080]  diagnose it, but not in my experience.
[34:15.120 --> 34:15.620]  Cody.
[34:16.420 --> 34:21.380]  Yeah, absolutely. Look at this. I don't know if you can see right now,
[34:22.020 --> 34:27.060]  but this is some East Coast sour diesel that I grew and I just pulled the leaves
[34:27.780 --> 34:31.540]  that don't have crystal off and I'm smoking that. That's what I'm smoking right now.
[34:32.180 --> 34:36.500]  These are the leaves I pulled off by hand. There's lots of little leaves left on there.
[34:40.160 --> 34:45.520]  I mean, this is also my head stash. When I'm, you know, growing stuff for other people,
[34:45.520 --> 34:51.440]  I tend to clean it up a little tighter just because that's kind of the accepted thing.
[34:55.460 --> 35:02.100]  But it's, I tell people who come over, who visit me, I'll give them a jar of weed that's
[35:02.100 --> 35:08.180]  untrimmed often and they'll look at me like, you lazy bastard. I'm like, no, no, no. Trust me,
[35:08.180 --> 35:13.780]  it's better this way. When you get weed untrimmed, it preserves longer and this is how an old OG
[35:13.780 --> 35:19.060]  would give you weed. So there's a function to it, believe me.
[35:24.420 --> 35:27.780]  Are all the neighbors' dogs barking at each other?
[35:28.580 --> 35:34.340]  Those are my two dogs. They're probably barking at some guy on the street.
[35:36.580 --> 35:41.700]  Someone brought up nitrogen. I almost feel like that's like if you're not good at
[35:42.260 --> 35:48.580]  drying, curing, and preserving, that that's kind of what you turn to. I remember talking to
[35:49.780 --> 35:58.420]  Kevin Jodry a long time ago about this and the idea was kind of like the dog food industry,
[35:58.420 --> 36:05.300]  you know, they ship slightly moist quantities of dog food and they're not
[36:05.540 --> 36:08.660]  they're not injecting it with nitrogen.
[36:12.740 --> 36:13.300]  But anyway.
[36:13.300 --> 36:17.300]  Hey, real quick, Peter. I just got a message from the musician friend of mine.
[36:19.140 --> 36:19.780]  Is he ready?
[36:20.660 --> 36:24.180]  He's going to hop on, I think. So if someone pops up.
[36:24.820 --> 36:29.380]  Yeah, we'll bring him in. All right. Well, then let's get to it. Let's see if we can squeeze
[36:29.380 --> 36:34.980]  out. I think the Oaxacan Thai people were asking some questions about. So why don't we
[36:34.980 --> 36:38.260]  move to that since that's one of the parents of the kickboxer?
[36:38.900 --> 36:44.500]  Yeah, if people can repeat their questions because they're way up in the chat. So.
[36:48.740 --> 37:03.950]  So the people who previously asked questions, I think something kind of like about the.
[37:05.790 --> 37:08.430]  I remember it was like, what's the Oaxacan and what's the tie?
[37:09.150 --> 37:11.630]  That Oaxacan is a Mexican.
[37:13.390 --> 37:15.470]  What is it? State Oaxaca?
[37:16.350 --> 37:20.350]  Yeah. Yeah, it's a state. So it's the Oaxacan.
[37:21.550 --> 37:29.390]  It was must have been a land race cannabis seed that was obtained in Oaxaca.
[37:29.390 --> 37:32.990]  And then it was. So the question was, did you cross that yourself?
[37:32.990 --> 37:35.230]  No. Okay, got it. Got it.
[37:36.190 --> 37:42.910]  No, because these the guys, Bruno Flake, the smuggler used to pick up Oaxacan Thai
[37:42.910 --> 37:48.510]  already grown in Mexico. And at that time, a lot of the weed was with seeds.
[37:48.510 --> 37:51.070]  So he would collect the seeds from the weed he was selling
[37:51.950 --> 37:57.470]  and grew them himself and selectively bred for what he considered the best quality.
[37:57.550 --> 38:06.030]  Okay, and then this one, the flower, it'll finish. It's a I would say eight to 12 weeks because
[38:07.070 --> 38:13.070]  it has been selectively bred to finish outdoors in Northern California before November.
[38:14.750 --> 38:25.470]  And it this year, a friend of mine in Maine grew it from seed outdoors and he harvested it the first
[38:25.470 --> 38:29.550]  and he harvested it the first week of October. So that's closer to eight weeks.
[38:32.670 --> 38:40.180]  And then we just lost it inbreeding. Does the Oaxacan Thai suffer from inbreeding depression
[38:40.180 --> 38:47.300]  being it so inbred? No, because he didn't. He didn't inbreed the weak plants. He grew
[38:47.300 --> 38:55.620]  them every year and bred together the strongest plants. So it's it's an inbred line, yes, but
[38:55.620 --> 39:04.180]  not to its degradation. It's it's a strong inbred line. Right. Oaxaca is a land race for Mexico and
[39:04.180 --> 39:07.620]  someone in Mexico crossed it to some Thai at some point.
[39:12.110 --> 39:17.710]  Unlucky. Do you have first hand knowledge of it really being from Thai growing in Oaxaca?
[39:18.590 --> 39:26.510]  No, I don't. But I am just kind of taking his word for it and basing it off of
[39:27.150 --> 39:34.030]  other things I've seen from that region of the world. You know, it's not dramatically different.
[39:36.670 --> 39:50.590]  I grew a Kathmandu Nepal. And that had a similar sort of nose and structure. So,
[39:50.590 --> 39:55.070]  you know, it's the same kind of hemisphere, same part of the world. You expect kind of similar
[39:55.150 --> 40:00.990]  characteristics in the in the cannabis from there, I think. I guess there's a chance that it's not Thai,
[40:01.870 --> 40:06.670]  but there's really no way I could corroborate that without a time.
[40:08.830 --> 40:14.190]  Well, how about this? Do you like it? I love it. My friend in Maine, I was just on the phone with
[40:14.190 --> 40:17.150]  him this morning. He said that's all he's been smoking from his harvest.
[40:17.470 --> 40:25.470]  It's not a weak land race. I feel like land races get the bad name sometimes.
[40:28.030 --> 40:37.070]  I forgot we have images. So let me cue some up. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely I've been skeptical
[40:37.070 --> 40:44.830]  buying Thais and Oaxacan, you know, lineages before. But this one packs a punch as far as
[40:45.470 --> 40:54.510]  the modern standards. That's the Oaxacan Thai. Yeah. So that's the mom. You know,
[40:55.070 --> 41:04.750]  she was completely seeded up. So give her some credibility. Not the most resinous plant,
[41:04.750 --> 41:08.430]  but the gummy punch. We know we're talking about the Oaxacan Thai in general here.
[41:09.390 --> 41:18.270]  Yeah, it's that's the dad or one of the few dads. I used three dads in our seed increase.
[41:20.670 --> 41:27.710]  We had four plants given to us. One was a female and the other three were males.
[41:31.040 --> 41:38.080]  So we let them pollinate everybody and made seeds and then crossed that to the to itself. Yeah.
[41:40.160 --> 41:47.040]  And look who just joined us. This is my partner. This is Ed. Ed, how are you? Pretty good.
[41:48.320 --> 41:54.160]  So we're we're talking we were just talking kickboxer and now we're talking
[41:54.880 --> 42:01.440]  Oaxacan Thai. Oh, nice. Yeah, that one's that one's got a special story to it.
[42:02.480 --> 42:07.360]  Did you already tell them? I did. I did. But I don't know if we have any new viewers since
[42:07.360 --> 42:13.680]  then, because that was like 40 minutes or 30 minutes ago. So why not? Your name's Ed.
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.040]  Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you give your version of the story for
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.480]  people who are just recently tuning in? Let's see how bad I fucked it up.
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.920]  Yeah. So I have another partner that I work with and he's good buddies with another guy.
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.360]  They pretty much been stoner buddies or, you know, smoking weed together for 30 years,
[42:37.360 --> 42:44.160]  40 years now. But he used to hang out with Bruno and his brother, brother Barry, which is the one
[42:44.160 --> 42:50.800]  I know. And, you know, we've, you know, gone back and forth. I've given him some of our gummy punch,
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.440]  some of our rose a mosa. He loved it. So he wanted to give me something that was something like
[42:55.520 --> 43:01.920]  deer to him. So that was the Hawaikin tie that his brother gave to him. His brother used to fly
[43:01.920 --> 43:08.320]  to Columbia and pick up the Hawaikin tie. It's originated from Mexico, but it was grown really
[43:08.320 --> 43:14.640]  big in Columbia. I'm really monopolized there. So that's where he would pick it up and then fly back
[43:14.640 --> 43:18.800]  over here because Mexico is a little more hotter than Columbia. They were able to do it easier.
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.640]  I don't know. It was back in the seventies. So he actually ended up getting in trouble,
[43:24.640 --> 43:28.880]  but almost every time he would bring back weed, he would smoke with his brother Barry and they
[43:28.880 --> 43:34.160]  would pick out the best seeds of the best batches because these were huge, huge monocrop fields
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.320]  they were getting it from. So all started from seed, you know, everything's done from seed.
[43:38.320 --> 43:43.760]  So there was a bunch of different phenos. It was pretty much close, but not, you know,
[43:43.840 --> 43:51.920]  they weren't, they weren't standardized. So, sorry, I'm reading something.
[43:53.760 --> 43:58.960]  Well, so actually, yeah, if you're reading them, take a look. Just people are commenting on the.
[44:01.120 --> 44:07.360]  Yeah. So what I think is they actually brought tie over to Mexico and then they crossed it to
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.920]  the Hawaikin land race that was there. And I think that's what actually made the Hawaikin tie.
[44:12.880 --> 44:18.000]  But I'm not, I'm not entirely sure. It's a very strong sativa. Pretty much everyone I've talked
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.960]  to all old school smokers when they said they've had it, it was just this nice head rush. They just
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.760]  had parties and they had a great time. None of them were like couch locked and just do stone.
[44:29.760 --> 44:34.720]  All of them were just like dancing around, just having a good time. But anyways, so he ended up
[44:34.720 --> 44:41.040]  getting in trouble and Barry, his brother kept the seeds and, you know, they just loved it. So he's
[44:41.040 --> 44:48.560]  been growing it almost every year. He'll plant like four seeds in one pot and just have like 10
[44:48.560 --> 44:54.480]  or 20 pots that he grows and he won't kill any of the males. He'll let it seed out because he wants
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.440]  to keep getting the seeds and keep standardizing it and making it. He said there was this one
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.480]  particular pheno that he's been going after and his brother liked the most and he's been trying
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.880]  to preserve it the most. He kind of lost it, he said back like four or five years ago, but he's
[45:08.880 --> 45:14.240]  starting to get it back. It might be a recessive trait, but from him breeding over and over again,
[45:14.960 --> 45:21.440]  it's pretty standardized now. Almost everything we breed to it, it's the nodes are like stacked
[45:21.440 --> 45:26.720]  perfectly. You can take a measure, like a measuring tape and you can measure between each node.
[45:26.720 --> 45:33.120]  Once it becomes like after that first stretch period and that first two week stretch period,
[45:33.120 --> 45:41.200]  the nodes are perfectly symmetrical all the way up. Other than that, I don't really know.
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.400]  Someone asked, give me one second, how many generations old? This is an interesting part
[45:48.400 --> 45:54.240]  of the story. Yeah, so that's really hard to actually like get a real answer from him
[45:54.240 --> 45:58.880]  because he never kept track. There's some years that he didn't get good seed from them. So he kind
[45:58.880 --> 46:03.200]  of just threw out that batch and then went from the year prior and he never really kept track. He
[46:03.200 --> 46:09.440]  didn't write down 27, 28, but I asked him if he already guessed, he's probably at like F30, F28,
[46:09.440 --> 46:15.120]  somewhere around there right now. And look at that, our musical guest is here.
[46:16.240 --> 46:23.680]  Nice. This is amazing. So why don't we just quickly, let's wrap up the, I mean, we can always
[46:23.680 --> 46:31.680]  come back to it, but anything. So the Oaxacan tie, let me just, here, hold on. Let me just queue up
[46:31.680 --> 46:43.360]  the pictures again. So that's the one of the males, right? A couple of, yeah, I think that's, yeah.
[46:44.320 --> 46:55.560]  Two males. And then, oh, sorry, Evan, I muted you before.
[46:56.680 --> 46:59.160]  I thought you did because the dogs, I wasn't offended.
[47:00.680 --> 47:04.920]  And so that's a, what a pregnant, that's a seated female, right?
[47:05.800 --> 47:13.480]  Yeah, she was all seated up. Same, just without flash during the day.
[47:14.280 --> 47:19.320]  The reason I like these photos, because it showed the color that the Oaxacan would get.
[47:20.760 --> 47:29.160]  It doesn't, it's not much of a resin champion, but it does get sativa flowers and it gets a
[47:29.160 --> 47:35.160]  nice purple color to it. And I feel like it doesn't partake too much on the strain too much.
[47:35.160 --> 47:40.200]  I feel like it really adds color and structure, but without taking too much of the flavor of
[47:41.160 --> 47:47.480]  what have you crossed. Yeah, no, it's cool. It really plays nicely. We crossed it to, I think,
[47:47.480 --> 47:54.760]  five other modern hybrids that we've grown and we've tested, I think, four of them. And all of
[47:54.760 --> 48:03.720]  them were, like Ed said earlier, very consistent in how they grew, stacking wise and good quality,
[48:03.720 --> 48:09.000]  dense flowers. It was just like a perfect combination of sativa and whatever we had
[48:09.000 --> 48:17.390]  crossed it with. All right, well, with that, should we take our music break?
[48:19.150 --> 48:24.510]  Sounds great to me. And where are you? You're on the East Coast, but where on the East Coast?
[48:24.510 --> 48:32.110]  I'm on the East Coast in New Jersey. Can you hear me well? Jersey. My dad was born in Fort Lee.
[48:32.990 --> 48:37.870]  Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, I'm from New Jersey also, Peter.
[48:38.590 --> 48:43.150]  I remember. Yeah, I know you said you were from the East Coast.
[48:43.150 --> 48:50.670]  Yeah, Evan and I go way back. I actually support and is going on right now.
[48:50.670 --> 48:53.550]  Oh, nice. I didn't even know you had shirts.
[48:54.270 --> 48:57.710]  Oh, yeah, I do. I don't at the moment. So sorry, everybody.
[48:57.710 --> 48:58.990]  You sold out. I got to print some more.
[48:59.630 --> 49:00.990]  Look at those again. Yeah.
[49:01.870 --> 49:03.550]  I got to get some more.
[49:03.550 --> 49:05.790]  Did New Jersey, any movement?
[49:07.390 --> 49:09.150]  Yeah, they did.
[49:09.150 --> 49:10.750]  Yeah, yeah, just did. Yep.
[49:12.030 --> 49:14.030]  I think it goes into effect in January.
[49:14.990 --> 49:17.470]  And that's for adult use or that's.
[49:18.270 --> 49:20.750]  I think adult use. Yeah, it's like an older thing.
[49:21.550 --> 49:22.050]  Yeah.
[49:22.510 --> 49:28.350]  Sorry. So just quickly on the Oaxacan tie heuristic value asked about germination rates.
[49:29.230 --> 49:32.750]  Oh, 100 percent. I mean, ninety nine point nine nine percent.
[49:33.950 --> 49:34.450]  Very high.
[49:35.230 --> 49:37.630]  High. They're fresh. I just made them last year.
[49:41.390 --> 49:43.710]  So hold on. Give me one second.
[49:49.120 --> 49:52.960]  Good God. Sorry. Someone was like, sweet. There's music, too.
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.320]  Oh, yeah. Here we go. All right. To queue up our musical guest.
[49:59.840 --> 50:02.320]  You can just take it away and play something.
[50:02.320 --> 50:05.440]  Sure. Yeah. How long you want me to go for?
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.000]  You mean like the Grateful Dead, like 40 minute jam or.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.840]  Yeah, I can give you whatever you want. Yeah.
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.000]  Why don't you why don't you do a first thing in the five minute range?
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.160]  OK, I have to seven minute and.
[50:20.320 --> 50:21.760]  We can go from there.
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.760]  Cool. Sounds good. All right.
[50:23.760 --> 50:28.960]  All right. So I got a I got a bit of gear here, so I don't think I'm going to start with that.
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.240]  We got multiple instruments. Damn.
[50:36.560 --> 50:40.240]  Yeah, Mike's no joke. He's he's been the musical wizard.
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.720]  Our whole lives. Someone asked what guitar you're playing.
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.200]  Oh, that is that's a strat, Mexican Stratocaster.
[50:49.760 --> 50:53.040]  Nice. So can you guys hear that at all?
[50:53.840 --> 50:56.080]  It's it's low, but we can hear it.
[50:56.080 --> 52:02.860]  Yeah, now we hear it.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.680]  In.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.480]  In.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.480]  In.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.480]  In.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.480]  In.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.480]  In.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  In.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.480]  In.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:52.480]  It's bursting with terpenes and a very high yielding plant.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.560]  It grows big, beefy nugs.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.480]  Soda can size nugs.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.260]  Not as dense as the gummy punch, but larger flowers.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.780]  But not larvae.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:12.140]  It's still plenty dense for today's standards.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.820]  There goes my fucking cherry.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:30.740]  All right, so let's, you want to tee up the kind of XC2, like who is XC2?
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:38.540]  So yeah, XC2 is a preservationist of Afghan and Pakistan indigen types.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:47.380]  He has been preserving three lines since the, I guess the early 90s.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:52.980]  He has the Jalalabad Star, Khytril Precious, and Pakistan Treasure.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:27:01.700]  He has a website that explains all of these in a, like on, you know, with a written out
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.220]  paragraph.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:09.340]  But essentially these seeds originated in country of origin, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:14.580]  And before the Soviet invasion, they were exported out.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:22.780]  And he has been preserving them pure, inbred, since, indoors, because of where he lives,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:27.980]  it's not acceptable or legal to grow.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:32.740]  So it's a very clandestine thing that he's doing and it's difficult for him to get the
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:39.060]  seeds out when he does get to do it occasionally.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.780]  And I, that's how I got the seeds.
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.780]  I placed an order from him.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:44.940]  Hey.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:49.460]  I placed an order from him and he sent me the seeds.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:56.300]  I grew them all out and I reproduced the seeds with like just a strut seeding crease, open
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.220]  pollinated each line separately.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.340]  And then I contacted him after the fact, told him I did it.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:11.540]  And I asked if he minded if I sold them, you know, being a partner with him.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:13.620]  And he said, yes, please.
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:19.100]  And he's been very supportive of me doing it.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:25.820]  I probably just because it's hard for him to keep up with the advertising stuff.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.900]  He can't use Instagram like we do.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.100]  He, yeah.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:35.480]  So he is a preservationist grower.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.580]  It's really all I know about him.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:39.140]  I don't know him personally.
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:45.460]  I've grown out the seeds and they are exactly what he described they would be.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.220]  And all very similar in their expression.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:53.340]  So, you know, it walks like a duck, talks like a duck.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.340]  It's probably a duck.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:01.220]  So just a quick general question about your breeding.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.220]  Yeah.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.220]  Yeah.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.460]  Yeah.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:10.580]  We do make all of our seeds outdoors under the sun, all organic in soil.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:15.090]  Okay.
[01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:18.690]  So why don't we start with that?
[01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:28.770]  Why don't we start with the, you want to start with the Chytral Precious?
[01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:29.770]  Yeah.
[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:36.570]  So it's a compact Pakistan plant.
[01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:44.050]  It grows very tightly nodes, very tightly stacked nodes and very tight clusters of flowers
[01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:49.290]  that don't have a very like skunky, funky, offensive smell.
[01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:54.210]  It's more sweet or earthy.
[01:29:54.210 --> 01:30:02.210]  Supposedly the line has been preserved in Pakistan for hashish traditionally, but it
[01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:03.970]  smokes well as a flower.
[01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:13.290]  It's not too larfy like some hash strains from that part of the country.
[01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:17.090]  It's very dense and it's very easy to trim.
[01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:19.210]  Fast finishing.
[01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:25.170]  We'll definitely finish first week of October, second week of October outdoors.
[01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:28.850]  You can see here on the branching, this is totally unaltered.
[01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:30.170]  I didn't top it.
[01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:31.970]  I didn't pinch it or anything like that.
[01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:36.970]  So you can see like the candelabra grow style of the branches.
[01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:38.370]  It's just very sturdy plant.
[01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:41.970]  These had no trellising, no bamboo stakes or anything, and they didn't blow over in
[01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:50.470]  the wind at all.
[01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:54.510]  So it was a pleasure to grow outdoors.
[01:30:54.510 --> 01:31:01.310]  And if you're indoor grower, it's not too hard to cover up because it's not like a chem
[01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:03.790]  dog or GMO or anything like that.
[01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:11.410]  It's reserved.
[01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:16.010]  Very fertile too.
[01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:22.770]  I made so many seeds on so few flowers with those plants.
[01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:27.810]  They just kind of bud that you go to break up to collect the seeds and just like 50 seeds
[01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:28.810]  falls out of one bud.
[01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:29.810]  You're just like, what the hell?
[01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:32.810]  I feel like that's just a trait of land raises.
[01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:34.810]  Yeah.
[01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:36.810]  I mean, typically, sure.
[01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:37.810]  Yeah.
[01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:41.610]  I've noticed that they're more fertile than some of the other hybrids that we've tried
[01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:43.050]  making seeds with.
[01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:44.050]  That's for sure.
[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:49.770]  They're just made to make seeds.
[01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:57.490]  So Alex Hardy, I think this is with XC2 he's talking about.
[01:31:57.490 --> 01:31:59.130]  Yeah.
[01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:06.290]  So he is able to get things out and I highly encourage people to order seeds directly from
[01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:07.290]  him.
[01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:12.330]  I mean, you don't need to order from us, but it's a lot easier to get it from us because
[01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:14.810]  it comes from the United States.
[01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:16.810]  It's right here, ready to go.
[01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:17.810]  There's no customs.
[01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:21.050]  There's no weird transfer money.
[01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:24.730]  It's just all very smooth American style.
[01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:27.850]  So that's the advantage of getting it from us.
[01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:38.230]  It's the same genetics.
[01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:39.230]  What?
[01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:42.990]  The Jalalabad?
[01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:48.270]  That Alex grew from 2018.
[01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:52.980]  Compared to what stock?
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:58.300]  Is very much hash plant, not the dense flower of the Jalalabad star.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.660]  Is he talking about the Kitechol versus the Jalalabad?
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:06.340]  He was saying the Jalalabad versus the Jalalabad.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:17.230]  We'll ask for clarification.
[01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:18.910]  What Kitechol?
[01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:20.630]  You're going to have to go to his website.
[01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:22.750]  Can we pull up his website at all?
[01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:26.270]  Yeah, give me one second.
[01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:29.150]  Let's see if Alex chimes in.
[01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:35.670]  Yeah, give me a second.
[01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:36.670]  What is it?
[01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:37.670]  The XC2 or whatever?
[01:33:37.670 --> 01:33:38.670]  Yeah, XC2.bigcartel.
[01:33:38.670 --> 01:33:52.640]  I don't know if it's a dot com or a dot co.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:59.560]  But the other thing is if you do buy the seeds from us, XC2 gets a percentage.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.760]  We split the sales of the seeds I made.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:09.360]  So it's not like I'm circumventing him by you buying seeds from us.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.400]  It's just expediting you getting the seeds.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.280]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280]  Well we have...
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.280]  Hold on.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280]  Because I put up...
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:26.340]  Are you just looking for the description stuff?
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:30.900]  Yeah, I was just looking for the description stuff.
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.900]  Of which one?
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:32.900]  Kitechol?
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.700]  I think they were asking about the Kitechol.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.700]  Where was it based off of, he said?
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.220]  Well, let's just start with...
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.380]  I think it was based off of the city of Kitechol, but...
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:49.620]  It's our low budget production, but sorry, let me...
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:55.450]  It works, we got that.
[01:34:55.450 --> 01:35:04.970]  Came out of Afghanistan, but I was informed on the last show that Kitechol is from Pakistan.
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:10.650]  So I need to look at a map.
[01:35:10.650 --> 01:35:11.650]  Got it.
[01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:14.610]  Because I'm not up to date on my geography there.
[01:35:14.610 --> 01:35:21.290]  Yeah, we'll do some research on some of the questions coming in, but from...
[01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:28.490]  But as far as what the plants are and what you're going to get, it's a true Afghani Indica.
[01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:35.410]  Smells very earthy, chocolatey, kind of sweet.
[01:35:35.410 --> 01:35:38.490]  Not very dank.
[01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:40.650]  But still packs a punch.
[01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.970]  And it actually cures really nicely over a year.
[01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:45.330]  Yeah.
[01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:48.330]  Develops a very nice tobacco aroma.
[01:35:48.330 --> 01:35:49.330]  I like that.
[01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:50.330]  Pleasant one.
[01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:51.330]  Pleasant one.
[01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:52.330]  Yeah, I got to give you...
[01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:53.330]  I noticed the blunts.
[01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:54.330]  I got to give you some of the nugs there.
[01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:55.330]  What do you use for the outside?
[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:56.330]  Oh, for the...
[01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:57.330]  Like what...
[01:35:57.330 --> 01:35:58.330]  Yeah, what kind of leaf?
[01:35:58.330 --> 01:35:59.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:00.330]  So I get the...
[01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:01.330]  Wait, sorry, I could barely hear you.
[01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:02.330]  Say that again.
[01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:04.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:05.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:06.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:06.330 --> 01:36:07.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:08.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:09.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:10.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:11.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:12.330]  The seeds.
[01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:13.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:16.690]  The strain I get for the tobacco is QB52.
[01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:20.690]  Oh, and then you grow it out?
[01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:25.410]  No, I've tried growing with Evan and we have not had good success drying it.
[01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:29.130]  We grow it pretty well, but just we can't dry it pretty well.
[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:33.570]  So I just buy my wraps by the pound.
[01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:34.570]  It's really cheap.
[01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:38.890]  It's like leafonly.com or something like that.
[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:44.930]  I buy it by the pound and there's like 20 leaves, 30 leaves, and I get eight wraps per...
[01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:51.170]  And I just keep it in a jar and then pull it from the leaf as I go.
[01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:52.170]  It's really nice.
[01:36:52.170 --> 01:36:53.170]  It's nice and smooth.
[01:36:53.170 --> 01:37:01.210]  I used to use backwoods all the time and I just had like chest problems, I guess.
[01:37:01.210 --> 01:37:04.130]  You know, coughing up black stuff.
[01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:06.130]  All the problems you could have.
[01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:07.970]  And switching to this, it's a lot better.
[01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:10.050]  I get the organic one and it's smooth.
[01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:12.050]  You don't have to worry about it.
[01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:15.050]  I got it.
[01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:23.310]  Okay, so just our rapid fire here.
[01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:32.310]  So we have the Chytril and then the Jalalabad Star.
[01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:34.310]  You want to talk about that?
[01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:38.910]  Yeah, the Jalalabad Star is most similar to what you're going to look for in a modern
[01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:40.510]  day cannabis strain.
[01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:45.790]  It's very offensive smelling, very dank, very resinous.
[01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:51.790]  You know, it's not as dense as the Chytril Precious, but definitely dense enough by today's
[01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:58.790]  standards to, you know, not get any eyebrows raised when you pull it out to share with
[01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:59.790]  your friends.
[01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:06.070]  It's one of those plants that I like to smoke the most out of all three.
[01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:12.070]  But it was the strongest for sure.
[01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:18.070]  It was definitely like the most hard hitting, indica dominant smoke.
[01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:23.070]  Yeah, no real issues.
[01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:27.070]  You know, it started to put out some bananas in the end, but that's because I really pushed
[01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:28.070]  it really late.
[01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:32.350]  So it didn't make any seeds from the herm or anything like that.
[01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:34.350]  No full on male flowers or anything weird.
[01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:39.350]  Very consistent expression between all the seeds that I grew.
[01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:48.350]  They almost all were the same height, same bud structure, same yields, more or less the
[01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:49.350]  same smell.
[01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:54.350]  Just some subtle nuances that were different from one pheno to another.
[01:38:54.630 --> 01:39:00.630]  But this is like the kind of building block strain that would be really good for a person
[01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:06.630]  to incorporate into a breeding program because it's not hybridized with anything that you'll
[01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.630]  find on the market.
[01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:12.630]  It's just a true old school Afghani indica.
[01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:25.210]  You can see all the resin in this picture, kind of from the flash.
[01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:27.490]  And strong stems too.
[01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:34.600]  That was a plant that was not being supported up by a trellis or bamboo.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.600]  It was just holding itself up.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.600]  That was all seeded up.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.600]  You can see the swollen pods there.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.600]  So this was the mom or one of the moms because I open pollinated the whole batch.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  I think there were three moms and three dads.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.880]  Yeah, they're great plants to grow.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  Thank you.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  Easy to grow.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:10.080]  No training or topping necessary to get the high yield.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.080]  All good germination rate.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.080]  They were just made last year.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  So they're fresh.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.080]  Just a good seed.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.080]  I think they're a good seed.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.080]  I don't know if I can get a picture of them.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  They were just made last year.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.360]  So they're fresh, strong, fully developed seeds.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  Tiger stripe, nice dark brown.
[01:40:53.010 --> 01:40:55.010]  Leaf only, Greg.
[01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:58.010]  Yeah, I just posted it.
[01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:03.010]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:04.010]  Pretty quick.
[01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.010]  Someone asked how the dads were different.
[01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:11.010]  They weren't really.
[01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:16.290]  I mean, they were all pretty much the same.
[01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:18.290]  There wasn't much difference between them.
[01:41:19.290 --> 01:41:21.290]  I just had them all in the same room.
[01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:25.290]  I smelled them and I looked at them individually.
[01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:27.290]  But there was really no obvious things.
[01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.290]  I didn't smoke them or anything like that.
[01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:33.290]  But they didn't have very much resin or anything like that.
[01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:37.290]  As far as the males we're talking about.
[01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:42.570]  But yeah, just nice strong males.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  People are talking geography.
[01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:57.830]  Okay, so someone asked about this.
[01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:59.830]  Why don't we jump to the...
[01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:02.830]  They said there's not much info on the Pakistan treasure.
[01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:10.830]  Yeah, so this one is more of what you would expect for a hashish cultivar.
[01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:12.830]  Because it's not quite as dense.
[01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:18.830]  You can't really get the resin out from inside the bud more easily.
[01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:24.830]  Very similar smell to the kaitul precious though.
[01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:30.830]  Where it's not very offensive or cushy or dank.
[01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:34.830]  It was just very sweet, kind of earthy.
[01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.830]  Hazy, if you will.
[01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:40.830]  It was...
[01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:49.380]  You know, it grew taller than the kaitul precious.
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:53.380]  And it didn't have as solid of a structure.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:55.380]  It was more lanky.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.380]  So it will definitely get taller.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.380]  And require some staking up.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.380]  I remember I had to stake that one up.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:05.660]  But it was...
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:13.660]  You know, it's just another insight into what people in the old world are growing and smoking.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:16.660]  And have been for hundreds of years.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:18.660]  It's...
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:22.660]  You know, it's not the kind of weed that I smoke every day.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.660]  But it's the kind of thing that it's really interesting to bring out.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.660]  And just talk to people or show.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.660]  And like, this is, you know, what they're growing.
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940]  And this is what they're growing in Afghanistan.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:36.940]  Or Pakistan, rather.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:38.940]  But they're close enough.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:41.940]  I'm sure they go back and forth over the borders.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280]  Thin leaf.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.280]  Not very wide-leaved like the kaitul precious.
[01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:56.740]  But it yielded high on the flowers.
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.740]  It definitely liked to stack.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.740]  It wasn't a wimp by any means.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.020]  Just grew it outdoors, though.
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.420]  I didn't put the girl inside.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.420]  I didn't see that message.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.420]  They just said this channel has lots of great information.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.420]  Yeah, good job, Peter.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.420]  It's a great show you put together.
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.420]  Yeah, it is.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.420]  We got music.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.420]  Alright, that's the last.
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:27.420]  Hold on.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.420]  Let me cut to one of you guys.
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.700]  Good internode stacking.
[01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:37.250]  Yeah, all three of them were.
[01:44:38.250 --> 01:44:42.250]  You know, they're definitely not wimpy, lanky plants.
[01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:47.250]  They're just some were taller than others when I said lanky earlier.
[01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:52.250]  But yeah, they throw down on the yield.
[01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:55.250]  I got quite a bit of flower off a few small testers.
[01:44:57.250 --> 01:45:02.250]  If I had time right now, I would probably do a video on that.
[01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:05.250]  If I had time right now and I knew what time it was in Afghanistan,
[01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:08.250]  I'd pull in Haroon, our Afghani correspondent.
[01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:11.250]  That would be great.
[01:45:14.250 --> 01:45:19.250]  I would love to hear some authentic spokespeople.
[01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:23.250]  You guys are all wrong.
[01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:26.250]  People have been talking regions.
[01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:36.490]  Here's a little knowledge drop in.
[01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:46.730]  Ah, I was always wondering what Exit 2 stood for.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.960]  Yeah, definitely sounds like something he would do based on my conversations I've had with him.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.960]  So yeah, I believe so.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.960]  I think we're going to do some random irrigation conversations
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960]  with a guy who's dealt with a lot of different irrigation systems.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.960]  Most likely around 8 p.m.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.240]  Give or take.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:20.240]  Definitely not before 8, but possibly at 9 Pacific time.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:28.240]  Someone's saying, I don't know if it's 5 a.m. in Afghanistan right now.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.240]  I don't know if that's what you're saying.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.240]  Well, we have another.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.240]  Sorry, tomorrow morning we have James Loud with...
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.520]  Let me see.
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.120]  Tomorrow morning...
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120]  James...
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.120]  It's the reschedule of what was supposed to be last week.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.120]  Land-raised genetics and preservation with Khalifa Genetics and Jamal from Sadu Seed Collective.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:11.760]  So I assume we're going to be touring the world on that.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.040]  We're going to be touring the world on that one.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.880]  So anyway, let me just see.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.880]  Any last questions on the...
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:34.390]  Does the man smoking the blunt have any additional commentary on that?
[01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:38.390]  No, this is all happening for him.
[01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:40.390]  This is his project.
[01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:46.430]  Alright, let me see.
[01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:51.600]  Okay.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  Alright, so basically all this stuff that we've been talking about,
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.600]  you can pick up right there at that website scrolling across the bottom of the screen.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]  Let's get our... hold on.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.600]  Evan's our scrolling ticker model.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:23.880]  And so we went through Kickboxer, Gummy Punch, F2, Oaxacan Thai, Rose Mimosa,
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.880]  I'm getting bad at this. I'm getting cocky.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.880]  Galalabad Star, and Pakistan Treasure.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.880]  So the last three were the relationship with XC2,
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.160]  who, by the way, Alex, shoot me an email.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  Alex Hardy.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.160]  Wait, Alex has more to say.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.160]  It's okay, we do not judge you on the hair.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.160]  Matthew Reed, yes.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160]  Yes.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  And so Alex is just Peter at Future Canopus Project.
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:16.160]  But Alex hit me up as the man who knows a lot about XC2 and other such things.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.160]  Seemed like you know a thing or two.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.160]  Yeah.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160]  Anyway, we'll come back.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  We mostly just wanted to show the plants behind Evan.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.160]  And then we decided to keep going.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.160]  Bring on a musical guest, partner, collaborators.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440]  It's supposed to be a quick thing.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  If I didn't have a hard stop, we'd bring it into all sorts of weird and unexpected directions.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:48.440]  I'm sure it could keep going into who knows what.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  Anyway, everyone.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  No, sorry.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.440]  Tonight would probably be 8 or 9 p.m.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  This is all Pacific time, so Los Angeles.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.440]  Tomorrow, James Louds at 11 a.m.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  And there was something else that I was going to possibly do, but I can't remember.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:23.440]  We may have our Israeli New Orleans jazz band come back.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  He thought I meant 8 a.m. in Israel.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  And he was like, that's early for me.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.440]  And I was like, no, no, I mean, it's like 6 p.m. in Israel.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:40.720]  Okay, he's probably sleeping right now, but I'll know when I wake up.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.720]  We're going to have some music tomorrow.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  Anyway, with that, thank both of you.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:50.720]  Thank everyone for watching.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.720]  And anyone hit me up, let me know if there's a breeder you want to hear from or a grower.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:58.720]  Whatever.
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.720]  I don't have a monopoly on ideas.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  In fact, I would love for other people to help out with the ideas and the emceeing conversations and all that stuff.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  But anyway, guys, thank you very much.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  I had a great time.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.240]  And I look forward to eventually smoking some of what you've been growing.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.240]  Yeah, I look forward to that, too.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.240]  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240]  All good things in all good time.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240]  Exactly. Patience.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.240]  All right.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.520]  All right. See you, everyone.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.520]  All right. I see Swamp Boys.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  Steven sent an email.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.520]  Okay. I'll get that.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  And with that, I will kill the livestream.
