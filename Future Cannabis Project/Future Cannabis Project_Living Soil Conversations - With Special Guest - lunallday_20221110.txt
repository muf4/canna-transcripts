[00:00.640 --> 00:03.620]  Yes, good morning, Living Soil nerds.
[00:03.620 --> 00:05.200]  Happy Thursday to you.
[00:05.200 --> 00:07.160]  We got a big brain on the show today.
[00:07.160 --> 00:09.120]  We were just kind of going over notes.
[00:09.120 --> 00:14.560]  I would imagine, I know I'm speaking for all three here, but we are blown away by how prepared
[00:14.560 --> 00:19.880]  you are for the show, even knowing that this is a very candid discussion.
[00:19.880 --> 00:22.240]  A variety of topics we're going to talk about.
[00:22.240 --> 00:26.240]  I notice anytime, especially on Instagram, when you put in your heading, because it's
[00:26.240 --> 00:29.360]  kind of brave these days to put anything about cannabis education.
[00:29.360 --> 00:34.360]  That was one of the one things that struck out to me when I saw your Instagram account,
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.040]  Luna, was the fact that you're out there.
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.040]  Organic cannabis education.
[00:38.040 --> 00:41.720]  That was something that I like to put up before mine got deleted.
[00:41.720 --> 00:42.840]  You're putting yourself out there.
[00:42.840 --> 00:47.640]  You're putting it up there that not only am I a cannabis farmer, but I'm all about educating
[00:47.640 --> 00:48.640]  others.
[00:48.640 --> 00:52.600]  That's something that is obviously near and dear to the Future Cannabis Project, especially
[00:52.600 --> 00:55.240]  to myself and Leighton.
[00:55.240 --> 00:58.720]  To have you on the show today, it's quite the honor.
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.880]  I think your star in the little community has been shining bright, but is now shining
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.960]  probably a little bit brighter to the larger masses.
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.240]  Then hopefully after today, more individuals will see that there are so many bright-minded
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.120]  people in the Living Soil community that for one person to feel like they've got it all
[01:18.120 --> 01:20.840]  figured out is really just silly.
[01:20.840 --> 01:28.080]  To continue to listen to bright-minded individuals, to have strong, sometimes back and forth conversations,
[01:28.080 --> 01:29.560]  I believe is healthy.
[01:29.560 --> 01:34.480]  We're going to be able to get on such a deeper level with Luna today.
[01:34.480 --> 01:37.440]  She's a writer for Skunk Magazine.
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.640]  We have a few friends of the show that are also writers for Skunk Magazine.
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.240]  If you've been smoking cannabis or in the cannabis scene, Skunk Magazine's probably
[01:46.240 --> 01:49.120]  been on your coffee table at some point.
[01:49.800 --> 01:51.920]  You're creating your own cheese lines.
[01:51.920 --> 01:55.600]  When I was in this, cheese was the one that paid the mortgage there for a while.
[01:55.600 --> 01:58.920]  There's a lot of people that just love that funky.
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.560]  It just had that funk that was really hard to fake.
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.600]  To truly get those expressions coming out, you got to understand the microbial world.
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.360]  You need to understand, from what I understood and from your expertise, we're getting deeper
[02:13.360 --> 02:15.600]  into almost like a soil scientist level.
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.920]  I'm excited to hear the back and forth with Leighton and yourself, Luna.
[02:19.920 --> 02:23.480]  Hopefully I can throw in a few things and we're going to have one hell of a conversation.
[02:23.480 --> 02:24.480]  Leighton?
[02:24.480 --> 02:25.920]  Yeah, welcome Luna.
[02:25.920 --> 02:27.600]  I'm really looking forward to this.
[02:27.600 --> 02:30.040]  You've definitely done your work, girl.
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.840]  The pictures of your plants.
[02:31.840 --> 02:32.840]  Thank you.
[02:32.840 --> 02:37.840]  I'm really passionate about what I do.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  I love soil science.
[02:38.840 --> 02:41.040]  I love growing plants.
[02:41.040 --> 02:42.040]  It's a dream for me.
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.600]  I appreciate you all having me on the show.
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.720]  I'm really excited to discuss some cool concepts with everyone.
[02:47.720 --> 02:50.280]  Well, welcome.
[02:50.280 --> 02:53.800]  Let's dive into how you got involved with Skunk Magazine.
[02:53.800 --> 02:58.560]  Sometimes when people haven't heard of you or finding more about you, it's nice to have
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.440]  something where it's like, well, here I am.
[03:00.440 --> 03:01.720]  I'm working hard on these things.
[03:01.720 --> 03:07.280]  How did you get involved in that and where can people find your articles?
[03:07.280 --> 03:10.960]  I was contacted by the owner of Skunk Magazine.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.320]  I've been doing a lot of cannabis education stuff through Facebook forums.
[03:16.320 --> 03:18.800]  People might know me from the Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
[03:18.800 --> 03:20.280]  I admin for there.
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.400]  I admin in the Organic Cultivators group.
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.480]  I was active in the KNF group for a while and the Subirrigation and Fermentation Farming
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.480]  group.
[03:28.480 --> 03:34.200]  Then I have my own group, Regeneration Earth.
[03:34.200 --> 03:43.240]  I've been active on the online Facebook cannabis education forum groups for a long time.
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.760]  I really dove into all the knowledge there, obsessively studied things for a long time.
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.760]  I just found the information super, super fascinating.
[03:53.760 --> 03:58.480]  I was always trying to help people, trying to share information, trying to explain concepts
[03:58.560 --> 04:07.640]  to them, clear up misinformation and disinformation, concepts that people were confused about.
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.800]  Until I eventually got noticed by Julie at Skunk.
[04:11.800 --> 04:12.800]  She's an awesome lady.
[04:12.800 --> 04:14.600]  Her and I are good friends.
[04:14.600 --> 04:15.600]  She reached out to me.
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.840]  I was like, hey, I love your writing.
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.100]  You're a really solid writer.
[04:20.100 --> 04:21.100]  Write an article for us.
[04:21.100 --> 04:22.920]  I'm like, sure, great.
[04:22.920 --> 04:28.440]  I wrote an article that was introductory to all the concepts that I would be writing
[04:29.400 --> 04:36.200]  and touching on in the future between introducing native biology and using local inputs to do
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.080]  natural farming concepts to diving more into the sciences of phytohormones and how they
[04:41.080 --> 04:49.480]  work and enzymology and things like that, microscopy, the soil food web, using ferments
[04:49.480 --> 04:55.480]  to integrate these concepts.
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.760]  You can find those articles on Skunk Magazine's website.
[04:58.760 --> 05:01.960]  You can also get to those articles through my link tree, which I believe the link is
[05:01.960 --> 05:05.960]  posted somewhere here.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.960]  Do you guys remember where that is?
[05:07.960 --> 05:09.960]  It's in the description.
[05:09.960 --> 05:13.960]  It's in the description and I've also got it up on the screen.
[05:13.960 --> 05:14.960]  Cool, cool.
[05:14.960 --> 05:15.960]  Thank you.
[05:15.960 --> 05:16.960]  So yeah, you can click that.
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.960]  It'll take you to a little section that says Skunk Magazine.
[05:19.960 --> 05:22.440]  And if you click that, my article's up there.
[05:22.440 --> 05:25.480]  I think there's only like five up there right now.
[05:25.480 --> 05:26.480]  Some of them are in print.
[05:26.480 --> 05:34.040]  I've only been writing with them for like a year and a month and every quarter a new
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.040]  one comes out.
[05:36.040 --> 05:41.960]  So not a huge amount of content on the Skunk Magazine website right now.
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.660]  But over time, every quarter I put another article up there.
[05:45.660 --> 05:50.360]  A lot of the content that I create is on my Instagram, the majority of it.
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.640]  Every week I try to make a video.
[05:52.640 --> 05:59.040]  I've been doing this kind of like TikTok style reel where I show how I'm making my mixes
[05:59.040 --> 06:03.600]  to introduce certain compounds for specific purposes and like the reactions that they
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.720]  have in the soil and therefore contributing to the plant.
[06:07.720 --> 06:15.160]  But I focus very much so on the soil and treating the soil a very particular way.
[06:15.200 --> 06:21.040]  I really treat my soil like a stomach, like it's an ecosystem.
[06:21.040 --> 06:22.840]  You know, we have our gut biomes.
[06:22.840 --> 06:26.480]  The soil has its microbiome, right?
[06:26.480 --> 06:29.840]  And so a lot of these concepts, they transfer.
[06:29.840 --> 06:35.080]  I mean, biology is pretty universal in how it behaves.
[06:35.080 --> 06:42.120]  And so I feed my soil in very particular ways with very particular inputs.
[06:42.120 --> 06:43.640]  Most of them are made myself.
[06:43.880 --> 06:46.040]  There's definitely a good handful of them that aren't.
[06:46.920 --> 06:49.560]  Things like powdered soy aminos and stuff like that.
[06:50.560 --> 06:58.480]  But I'm using a custom built soil that my good friend Tim, Tim Hanrahan, he's a badass
[06:58.480 --> 07:00.840]  soil scientist guy, one of my muses.
[07:01.320 --> 07:07.400]  But him and I kind of put our heads together and built the soil.
[07:07.760 --> 07:10.200]  Probably him, he helped a lot.
[07:11.160 --> 07:20.360]  And we built this kind of soil based on having like maximizing soil biology while, you know,
[07:20.360 --> 07:25.320]  having a balance of the inputs so that they are very synergistic with each other and the
[07:25.320 --> 07:31.840]  right ratios kind of using that like Albrecht style, the ideal soil kind of approach, but
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.560]  also integrating other research through like balancing nutrients and stuff to make them
[07:38.560 --> 07:40.280]  readily available chemically.
[07:42.120 --> 07:48.360]  The soil is built with like I think it's like 30 percent earthworm castings.
[07:48.920 --> 07:51.880]  I'm a big fan of vermicomposting and earthworm castings.
[07:53.320 --> 07:58.560]  And we kept the nitrogen levels really down so that we could add a whole bunch of amino
[07:58.560 --> 08:02.360]  acids as we're growing.
[08:02.400 --> 08:07.200]  So this kind of keeps the soil temperatures down, the thermophilic processes down and
[08:07.200 --> 08:11.160]  keeps it like in a mesophilic range, which maximizes soil diversity.
[08:11.880 --> 08:16.880]  And with that diversity allows for other opportunities for organic acids to be fermented
[08:16.880 --> 08:25.080]  into different phytohormones, phyto compounds and different organic acids, which then are
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.600]  turned into different, you know, they signal metabolic pathways and flavonoid pathways
[08:29.880 --> 08:34.920]  and stuff. So I'm really about maximizing diversity in your soil.
[08:35.720 --> 08:40.560]  We're setting the foundation to maximize diversity because, you know, sometimes in a
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.840]  climate having diversity kind of narrows itself down and picks what it wants for the
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.000]  climate that it's in. So I like to set the stage for diversity.
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.240]  Maybe it'll get to that point at one time and then it kind of competes with itself and
[08:55.240 --> 08:57.680]  finds like an equilibrium, like a homeostasis.
[08:58.600 --> 09:05.320]  So I try to nurture diversity, but always, you know, the soil does what it wants.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.560]  So, yeah, there's my very long winded rant here.
[09:10.520 --> 09:11.760]  This is that's what I was saying.
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.600]  These are these are, you know, when you really kind of like taking back that these last
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.320]  three hours, the reason we do that is because there's such candid conversations.
[09:20.320 --> 09:24.680]  There's so many gold bars that are dropped by every single person that comes through.
[09:24.920 --> 09:27.840]  And, you know, I hope people have their pen and paper today.
[09:27.840 --> 09:30.840]  I know I do because it's the vermicompost stuff.
[09:30.840 --> 09:35.520]  It's the stuff where, you know, OK, yes, we're decent at making compost when we first
[09:35.520 --> 09:40.080]  get into it. You know, it's relatively easy, I think, if you're paying attention.
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.480]  But there's a lot of mistakes that can be made.
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.280]  You know, you can kill off everything.
[09:45.280 --> 09:48.960]  You know, a lot of people go out of town and forget that a week in the microbial life,
[09:48.960 --> 09:50.160]  you know, that's a long time.
[09:50.440 --> 09:55.600]  So when when people are newer to this and I try to get them to more to the vermicompost,
[09:55.800 --> 09:59.400]  I see that they find a lot more success with that, you know, pretty hard for mother
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.320]  nature to mess up what she's perfected.
[10:01.560 --> 10:06.720]  So, again, we're moving away from, you know, the compost pile being so dependent on us
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.720]  to we're now using composting worms where, you know, we're managing the system again.
[10:11.720 --> 10:15.200]  And I know that a lot more people are starting to understand that living soil systems,
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.960]  farming, cannabis, all of those things, you got to remove the ego to find true success
[10:19.960 --> 10:21.960]  with that because we're managing those systems.
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.280]  But it's not it's not about us anymore.
[10:24.720 --> 10:28.440]  And I see that also with when you're trying to get to higher levels of, you know,
[10:28.440 --> 10:31.680]  vermicompost. So I was wondering if we could kind of dive a little bit deeper into the
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.720]  vermicompost. Not as many people see as value as I think maybe you and I do and Leighton
[10:37.720 --> 10:42.720]  and a few others of, you know, that the biofilm, the things you can't purchase in the
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.080]  store. So I'm a huge on vermicompost.
[10:47.480 --> 10:48.840]  I love earthworm castings.
[10:49.160 --> 10:56.080]  I love just like composting methods that implement insects, you know, like there's
[10:56.080 --> 10:58.480]  black soldier fly larva, people do mealworms.
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.840]  There's there's a few other ones.
[11:01.800 --> 11:06.120]  But I'm really big into integration of insects as a workforce.
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.280]  There's so much like you said, there's a lot of stuff that can go wrong with like
[11:11.280 --> 11:12.520]  thermophilic composting.
[11:12.720 --> 11:18.480]  And it's very dependent on us and our knowledge and our ability to properly maintain
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.440]  temperatures, keep it going for as long as possible and until it's done.
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.600]  Right. And hopefully you don't have some kind of, you know, colony collapse of bacteria
[11:27.600 --> 11:30.080]  that, you know, that halts your your progress.
[11:30.080 --> 11:35.200]  And there's a whole bunch of times where, like, I see people, hobby growers or, you
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.520]  know, food, food garden growers that are making their own thermophilic compost and then
[11:39.520 --> 11:41.840]  they introduce it to their garden and they get Septoria.
[11:41.960 --> 11:47.680]  Right. Because, you know, they had a fungal pathogen that started multiplying because,
[11:47.680 --> 11:49.440]  you know, they didn't have their conditions cracked.
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.000]  And now your whole garden has Septoria and people are like, what is this?
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.640]  You know, and it's really common.
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.120]  Someone's going to be like, oh, you know, it's a it's a manganese deficiency.
[11:59.120 --> 12:00.520]  Look at the spots, you know.
[12:01.280 --> 12:04.520]  And then they start doing something silly, like, you know, pumping them with manganese
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.160]  and creating all these other problems, throwing off the balance of their soil, which is
[12:09.160 --> 12:11.200]  the importance of correctly diagnosing something.
[12:11.200 --> 12:17.640]  Right. But with with using insects, a lot of those issues are kind of
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.800]  a lot of those variables are limited, not to mention that the CO2 off gassing is
[12:23.800 --> 12:25.000]  significantly lower.
[12:25.480 --> 12:33.200]  So, you know, doing vermicomposting, doing black solar composting, you're able to scale
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.560]  it up like really, really big.
[12:34.560 --> 12:40.400]  Right. So you can have a huge workforce of all these insects composting things at this
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.040]  fantastic rate. And then you get a really consistent product at the end that's really
[12:45.040 --> 12:51.240]  diverse in biology and it stays within the mesophilic range, which I don't know if
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.000]  everyone's familiar with the term mesophilic, but it's like the medium temperature.
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.360]  You know, it's temperatures between I forget what the low end is, but it's up to like
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.040]  ninety five or ninety eight degrees or something like that.
[13:02.840 --> 13:05.240]  And then it comes into thermophilic range.
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.160]  And so there's mesophilic bacteria that, you know, operate in this particular range.
[13:09.160 --> 13:11.040]  There's thermophilic that operate in this particular range.
[13:11.040 --> 13:16.000]  I think there's a tiny bit of overlap, but a lot of bacteria doesn't like to be in the
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.160]  thermophilic range. So like, you know, it just dies off.
[13:19.160 --> 13:22.880]  It literally cooks off. And that's that's how you cook off a lot of pathogens and stuff,
[13:22.880 --> 13:25.560]  too. So I like to.
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.800]  I like to, you know, assuming that there's like conditions and conditions that promote
[13:31.800 --> 13:33.040]  those pathogens in the first place.
[13:33.840 --> 13:39.520]  So I like to keep things in the mesophilic range with these mesophilic inoculants like
[13:39.560 --> 13:41.080]  earthworm castings and insect frost.
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.720]  And I honestly think that it's a huge portion of, you know, helping to.
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.800]  Eliminate a lot of these problems that are we're facing just like in the world and like
[13:53.800 --> 14:00.680]  in agriculture with like these huge amounts of organic matter or, you know, like
[14:00.680 --> 14:05.160]  people doing these like hot rock composting approaches that, you know, people get really
[14:05.160 --> 14:07.160]  sick and like it like staph infections from.
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.880]  And then you can use these insects for a whole bunch of different things.
[14:11.880 --> 14:17.440]  You know, you can grind them up and use them as, you know, some kind of amendment.
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.200]  You can feed them to things like people.
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.800]  People do. They integrate it into like their aquaponics systems.
[14:24.040 --> 14:30.760]  So like they might create like a black soldier and then feed their tilapia or their
[14:30.760 --> 14:32.960]  koi with these insects.
[14:32.960 --> 14:37.440]  And now you've kind of created this like closed loop system where you have your
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.960]  aquaponic fishes being fed the organic matter from your plants that you're feeding to
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.280]  your insects and you're creating more insects and you're feeding the insects to your
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.680]  your fish. And you've created this this like closed loop, right?
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.760]  There's just like really cool opportunities like that or feeding them to chickens or
[14:55.800 --> 14:58.840]  going fishing with them with like the worms, you know.
[14:59.840 --> 15:04.360]  There's just like all these really cool opportunities that come from integrating insects
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.680]  into your processes that I think are really awesome.
[15:09.560 --> 15:13.080]  Yeah, it's getting closer to like old growth forests and all of those things.
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.000]  Sorry. Yeah, you know, it mimics nature and I'm really big into mimicking these concepts
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.920]  of nature and doing what nature has done instead of.
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.640]  Coming in and putting man hours into it and having your hands on it and really
[15:30.640 --> 15:34.960]  controlling it and micromanaging it as like a person and then you got to pay people to
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.640]  do it, right? Or you're doing it or you could outsource it to insects, you know.
[15:40.320 --> 15:43.680]  So like it mimics the forest better.
[15:43.680 --> 15:44.920]  It mimics nature better.
[15:45.840 --> 15:47.640]  This is how these processes function.
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.560]  You know, thermophilic composting will happen in nature to, you know, like a static kind
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.480]  of composting. But, you know, like there's no one out there like turning the forest,
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.360]  right? You know what I mean?
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.200]  Like there's no one going out into the forest with like a pitchfork and like turning the
[16:01.200 --> 16:06.640]  leaves so that they can have compost and nothing against like compost and compost
[16:06.640 --> 16:08.320]  using. I'm all for it.
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.600]  This is just what I prefer. And I like the approach.
[16:13.840 --> 16:15.640]  I like the concepts. It makes sense to me.
[16:16.040 --> 16:17.880]  Yeah, it's all about biomimicry, right?
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.080]  You know, copying nature.
[16:20.080 --> 16:23.200]  She knows what she's doing and letting her manage it for you.
[16:23.360 --> 16:25.880]  Why? Why slave over something if you don't have to?
[16:26.520 --> 16:29.400]  So let's let's reel it back in.
[16:29.400 --> 16:36.040]  And I'm very interested that you use 30 percent worm castings in your soil plants so
[16:36.040 --> 16:40.080]  you don't have you don't have any water logging issues or anaerobic pockets.
[16:41.320 --> 16:43.280]  No, I actually have great breathability.
[16:43.320 --> 16:50.040]  I'm using pumice and cinder and then we used like twice the amount of P that was
[16:50.040 --> 16:57.440]  recommended. But no, like I don't have any any anaerobic pocket issues.
[16:57.440 --> 16:59.240]  It breathes very, very well, actually.
[16:59.760 --> 17:00.880]  Nice. Nice.
[17:00.880 --> 17:05.440]  Yeah. Well, you have, I would imagine, a very healthy worm population building the
[17:05.440 --> 17:07.280]  dissolved oxygen channels for you.
[17:07.280 --> 17:11.120]  So if there is a potential, yeah, they're going to clean all that up.
[17:11.760 --> 17:15.680]  At some point we can go out to the to the greenhouse and I can show you guys, but
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.960]  like when you pull my mulch layer back, you see a worm every time in every spot that
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.360]  you do it on the surface.
[17:21.400 --> 17:22.680]  There's worms everywhere.
[17:23.720 --> 17:27.960]  And like the the feeder roots on the top are all white and like covering everywhere.
[17:27.960 --> 17:30.120]  And you can see like the mycelium from my mulch layer.
[17:30.840 --> 17:32.680]  I use a wood.
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.680]  I went to like a local arborist and they collect all the wood around the area.
[17:39.680 --> 17:45.040]  So I figure it's a great source of indigenous microbes and fungi from the surrounding
[17:45.040 --> 17:47.880]  area. Well, what's happening?
[17:48.120 --> 17:49.200]  Oh, OK, cool. Yeah, yeah.
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.480]  That's Ken doing his magic.
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.280]  I was curious. I thought that maybe like I was dropping.
[17:57.320 --> 17:58.960]  I'm playing in the background.
[17:58.960 --> 17:59.960]  Sorry.
[18:01.200 --> 18:03.880]  It's all good. You know, like I did that.
[18:03.880 --> 18:05.720]  I took that picture because I just loved the worm.
[18:06.720 --> 18:09.480]  But I guess you're not actually supposed to handle worms like that.
[18:09.480 --> 18:12.120]  It's bad for the worms. So try not to handle your worms.
[18:12.600 --> 18:14.840]  But you had nice dirty hands.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.160]  Yeah, I have this kind of.
[18:16.360 --> 18:18.920]  Yeah, there was dirt on the worms, dirt on my hands.
[18:18.920 --> 18:20.880]  You know, I figured it wasn't a big deal.
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.080]  That is actually probably the best way to handle that.
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.520]  It is not just having your skin directly in contact with their skin, but having dirty
[18:28.520 --> 18:29.880]  hands as a buffer.
[18:29.920 --> 18:31.400]  So I think you did the right thing.
[18:32.600 --> 18:33.600]  Yeah, for sure.
[18:34.080 --> 18:39.120]  So, yeah, I introduced a layer of like native, like a diversity
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.120]  of native wood chips, right, as my mulch layer.
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.200]  And then I covered that with alfalfa straw.
[18:46.680 --> 18:48.000]  And it's great. It's been working great.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.120]  It's keeping moisture in and keeps the top layer moist so that, you know, we have like a
[18:51.120 --> 18:56.040]  healthy feeder root level and and, you know, introducing a lot of native
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.960]  biology, native microbes.
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.480]  You know, I don't think enough people understand the value of alfalfa as a
[19:03.840 --> 19:06.240]  cover mulch. I mean, it's high in nitrogen.
[19:06.240 --> 19:07.760]  It's got all kinds of goodies in it.
[19:08.320 --> 19:13.400]  And, you know, definitely when I made compost and scale back in Connecticut, I'd
[19:13.400 --> 19:18.320]  always get third cut because that's when you really get the heavy amount of those
[19:19.120 --> 19:22.080]  other plants that usually will make the horse jiggy.
[19:22.080 --> 19:26.560]  But it's great for compost because you're getting all of the alfalfa and high nitrogen
[19:26.680 --> 19:31.600]  stuff. So kudos for you for mentioning that, because I think more people
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.800]  should know about getting alfalfa instead of some of the other traditional hay mixes.
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.440]  Yeah, you know, alfalfa is great.
[19:39.520 --> 19:44.480]  And there's there's like discussion around the introduction of
[19:44.480 --> 19:47.680]  tricontinol. You familiar with I'm sure you're familiar with tricontinol.
[19:48.480 --> 19:49.520]  The compound, yes.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.640]  Yeah, yeah. So it's it's a phytohormone that increases
[19:56.760 --> 20:01.840]  chlorophyll density in the cell and as well as like the
[20:01.840 --> 20:06.400]  strength of the cell walls, like the thickness of cell walls and also controls some
[20:06.600 --> 20:09.000]  elongation effects within the plant.
[20:11.800 --> 20:17.520]  I'm skeptical kind of of like whether or not that tricontinol is viable
[20:17.600 --> 20:22.080]  in the alfalfa, like once it starts to dry and kind of break down, because
[20:22.080 --> 20:26.320]  tricontinol is a very unstable molecule.
[20:26.440 --> 20:29.680]  You know, it just kind of it oxidizes really fast and just like disappears.
[20:30.560 --> 20:34.960]  But in the event that it does introduce tricontinol, you know, that's like another
[20:34.960 --> 20:36.560]  benefit of alfalfa.
[20:37.760 --> 20:42.520]  I feel like a lot of the time these these concepts, the concepts are very speculative
[20:43.640 --> 20:48.520]  when we're talking about adding certain things to promote certain things
[20:49.840 --> 20:55.240]  as like soil sciences is to me still very much so scratching the surface.
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.920]  Anyway, and because there's so much about soil sciences that are that are not
[21:01.920 --> 21:02.920]  understood still.
[21:03.640 --> 21:07.800]  Well, I think you've got to go back and understand that soil scientists only look at
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.120]  soil in two parts.
[21:09.680 --> 21:12.920]  That's the physical, sand, so clay and organic matter and the chemistry.
[21:12.960 --> 21:15.400]  They do not take biology into the picture.
[21:15.720 --> 21:18.520]  So the best they can only get is a D.
[21:19.080 --> 21:20.920]  They can't get up into the B's and A's.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.680]  So you're spot on with that assessment.
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.640]  And they all test things in controlled environments, not in nature, because they're all
[21:28.640 --> 21:31.960]  about reduction and trying to prove this as a compound.
[21:32.520 --> 21:36.800]  And you're right. That is that is one of the very or what do we call it?
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.760]  Volatile organic compounds.
[21:38.760 --> 21:41.560]  It breaks down very quickly when it's exposed to oxygen.
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.440]  So there's you know, they're in a perfect lab doing this.
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.160]  Then, yeah, they can get these results.
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.720]  But in nature, it's a different friggin animal.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.200]  Yeah, who knows?
[21:51.200 --> 21:56.560]  And I think like the cannabis industry has pushed a lot of these concepts.
[21:58.520 --> 22:00.520]  Everyone's trying to grow like the best flower, right?
[22:00.520 --> 22:02.920]  And everyone's trying to figure out like the best way to grow the best flower.
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.840]  And I feel like that's kind of pushed microbial research a little bit.
[22:10.240 --> 22:16.400]  So so from my understanding, you know, like a lot of these concepts haven't been super
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.560]  researched because they're not really profitable once you know about them.
[22:20.600 --> 22:24.720]  Right. Because people aren't doing them on an agricultural scale and all the money is
[22:24.720 --> 22:29.880]  whatever is being implemented on an agricultural scale, which is, you know, using ionic
[22:29.880 --> 22:32.600]  blends, you know, pumping with with like salts and stuff.
[22:34.200 --> 22:38.400]  That's where the money is. You know, like after World War Two, you know, people you
[22:38.400 --> 22:40.960]  know, there was this abundance of ammonium nitrate.
[22:40.960 --> 22:43.160]  Right. And then they were like, oh, you know, like we can grow plants with all this
[22:43.160 --> 22:45.240]  stuff that we were just using to blow people up with.
[22:45.920 --> 22:47.720]  You know, and like phosphorous and things.
[22:48.240 --> 22:54.200]  And so it made economic sense to to use these use this abundance of material that they
[22:54.200 --> 22:55.600]  had to now grow food.
[22:55.840 --> 23:01.800]  And so all these other things like the interactions of mycorrhizae with, you know,
[23:02.360 --> 23:07.360]  lesser fungi and how they micro transport nutrients and stuff like that and like how
[23:07.360 --> 23:12.720]  fascinating it is. These concepts are irrelevant because they don't urge to agriculture
[23:12.760 --> 23:15.880]  people because they don't make a bunch of money.
[23:15.920 --> 23:21.160]  And like implementing them on this massive scale would require the loss of profit for
[23:21.160 --> 23:22.480]  these massive corporations.
[23:23.120 --> 23:24.680]  And so it's not in people's best interest.
[23:24.680 --> 23:30.720]  But I feel like in a cannabis world, people are trying to get back to these concepts
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.120]  because they notice that they bring out more secondary metabolites in the flower, which
[23:35.120 --> 23:39.160]  is what like are setting flower aside from people.
[23:39.840 --> 23:41.840]  And I love the plant.
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.240]  I'm all about the plant. I respect all growers.
[23:44.480 --> 23:46.120]  I personally do not grow hydroponic.
[23:46.920 --> 23:56.880]  I feel like there isn't any there isn't much room for setting your product aside in the
[23:57.120 --> 23:59.080]  hydroponic growth approach.
[23:59.840 --> 24:05.600]  And what I mean by that is like like in the grape and the tobacco industry, it's very
[24:05.600 --> 24:13.040]  much understood that your climate and your soil composition, your water, you know, the
[24:13.040 --> 24:19.600]  profile of nutrients in your soil and what they are affect the the aroma and affect the
[24:19.600 --> 24:25.880]  flavor, the experience of a grape or of tobacco and the climate and the light spectrum
[24:25.880 --> 24:27.840]  from the sun on different parts of the earth.
[24:28.120 --> 24:32.120]  They all affect these different compounds in this different expression of plants.
[24:32.320 --> 24:35.720]  And this is a universal concept to all plants, right, you know, to everything.
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.560]  And it's super fucking cool.
[24:38.160 --> 24:39.320]  I think it's super fucking cool.
[24:39.920 --> 24:45.800]  But when you're doing one specific approach where everyone is using one particular brand
[24:45.800 --> 24:50.920]  of hydroponic nutrient growing in one specific substrate, I don't want to call people out,
[24:50.920 --> 24:53.520]  right. But I think everyone knows I'm talking about.
[24:54.800 --> 25:00.680]  You get a very baseline product, which is now this industry standard product that doesn't
[25:00.680 --> 25:04.320]  really set itself aside from the next person, in my opinion.
[25:05.720 --> 25:08.880]  And I think that that's kind of a tragedy.
[25:10.320 --> 25:16.920]  And I really, you know, I find a lot of purpose in trying to explain to people why, you
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.920]  know, we don't have to do it that way and how we can do it differently to create a product
[25:21.920 --> 25:29.400]  that's specific to you and your art form and approach to growing and specific to your
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.680]  climate, your topography, your light spectrum in your area and creating something truly
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.400]  unique. And imagine if every grower had a product truly unique compared to the next
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.280]  person, you know, like like with beer, you know, like with craft beer, people grow their
[25:47.280 --> 25:54.360]  hops in a particular way so that they have particular profiles of, you know, particular
[25:54.360 --> 26:01.480]  profiles. And, you know, using that to create an alcohol, a beer that's specifically your
[26:01.480 --> 26:03.520]  own and different from everyone else's.
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.160]  And you go to these breweries and all their IPAs or their ambers, you know, or their
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.840]  lights, you know, like they all, you know, whatever, blondes, they're all different.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.920]  You can taste like a difference between them all.
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.800]  And this is like, I feel like this is where the cannabis industry is going and it needs
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.880]  to go. And I really want it to go there.
[26:25.120 --> 26:26.840]  It's just really special to me.
[26:26.880 --> 26:31.600]  And all of that is based around how you're going to grow, what you're going to introduce
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.520]  into your soil, what your composition of soil is, you know, the biology that you're
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.000]  introducing that's native to your area and the effects that that has and the ability
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.040]  that it has to turn organic acids into other phytohormones and phyto compounds and, you
[26:46.040 --> 26:51.240]  know, just amino acid conjugates in general to create a truly unique product.
[26:51.240 --> 26:56.320]  And like. That's what I'm all about, like that's what I'm really into and what I really
[26:56.320 --> 26:58.680]  want the information to get out there to help people do.
[26:58.800 --> 26:59.320]  You know what I mean?
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.160]  That's beautiful. It is very much all about the diversity and you're never going to get,
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.320]  you know, and what you said is you should state it this way.
[27:09.400 --> 27:10.360]  You're an artist.
[27:11.040 --> 27:17.720]  You're performing an artistic approach to this grow by introducing all of this
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.880]  diversity and understanding what that diversity provides in the end result, which is the
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.080]  expression of cannabinoids and cannabinoids and terpenoids.
[27:26.600 --> 27:31.400]  And yeah, I mean, it's been shown time and time again that the same cultivar grown in a
[27:31.400 --> 27:36.040]  synthetic environment versus a living soil, the expressions are completely different.
[27:36.080 --> 27:41.040]  So, you know, kudos for you for getting that and pounding that home into the audience's
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.360]  head that that's really where it starts is providing that unique diversity in your soil
[27:46.360 --> 27:49.160]  and then letting the plant, letting the plant express itself.
[27:50.040 --> 27:51.560]  Definitely, definitely.
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.360]  And when you say an artist, I would even put on that like there's many hats that a cannabis
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.320]  farmer, especially from a living soil side of things, wears where you're also a chef.
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.360]  You had mentioned that you're going out of your way to build your own soil with your own
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.360]  recipes. I can't harp on that enough.
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.840]  I think when people start out, it's great to have like the formulas you can easily find on
[28:12.840 --> 28:14.640]  your Google searches.
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.680]  But then for you, like when you're going deeper into what you're mentioning, you have to
[28:18.680 --> 28:19.920]  know your own environment.
[28:19.920 --> 28:23.360]  You have to know your own work ethic, you know, and really have a talk with yourself.
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.040]  Like, can I really achieve these kind of styles or do I need to, you know, a hydroponic
[28:28.040 --> 28:33.680]  farm? There's a lot of, in my opinion, a lot of unnecessary work that you have to just
[28:33.680 --> 28:36.280]  put up with to farm cannabis in that manner.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.760]  You know, you have to really understand pH levels and dial all that stuff in.
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.120]  And it's hard to pass it on to someone else where with your style and the style that a lot
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.400]  of individuals find to be, you know, an artistic level.
[28:49.040 --> 28:51.080]  It's again, the microbial life.
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.680]  So you're just taking what you understand and proving on Mother Nature and you're finding
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.000]  your own way. And the beauty of that is that we can all do that.
[28:59.040 --> 29:01.480]  I mean, Mother Nature is for all of us to achieve.
[29:01.480 --> 29:03.320]  And we were talking about this yesterday.
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.480]  Shout out to Kaylee and Marco.
[29:05.480 --> 29:10.520]  And I think that's really important to know is that if something is given to you as open
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.320]  sourced information and then you take that, you maybe improve on that or you find another
[29:15.320 --> 29:19.720]  way on that and then you charge for that, you know, or you charge outrageous money for
[29:19.720 --> 29:21.760]  that information that you got open sourced.
[29:22.720 --> 29:28.240]  It's really, you know, in a way for us, at least, it was almost unforgivable where if
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.600]  it's an open source world, then we need to continue that open source information.
[29:32.720 --> 29:38.440]  Community, especially leaning on people such as yourselves, Leighton and Luna, is trying
[29:38.440 --> 29:43.160]  to understand from a soil scientist aspect what's really going on there.
[29:43.360 --> 29:48.120]  Let's move away all of that bro science, but let's continue to work as a community.
[29:48.160 --> 29:51.320]  Let's not just hoard some information because maybe we figured something out a little bit
[29:51.320 --> 29:52.520]  quicker than the community.
[29:52.840 --> 29:57.000]  Then when the community catches up, you know, we feel a certain way about that towards
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.960]  others because it's like, why are you guys hoarding information when you've, you know,
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.960]  everybody knew about this open source from day one and should continue that way.
[30:08.120 --> 30:10.840]  So I'm all about open source information.
[30:12.200 --> 30:18.360]  I think it's important, I think that it's to better the entire community is to better
[30:18.360 --> 30:23.440]  yourself, you know, and giving like this information.
[30:23.960 --> 30:29.600]  Sure, like you can make a bunch of money off of it, you know, growing cannabis, but you
[30:29.600 --> 30:36.760]  can also grow food and food that is healthful, that promotes like a really energetic
[30:36.760 --> 30:42.120]  effect inside of you and that like really changes your body and how you think.
[30:43.440 --> 30:48.800]  And so like the information has more value than just like, you know, growing better weed
[30:48.800 --> 30:50.280]  than your neighbor, right?
[30:50.360 --> 30:55.520]  Like, but if the two of you collaborate and you, you know, talk about your art forms and
[30:55.520 --> 31:01.160]  you use similar approaches and you, you work together and like, oh, I made an awesome batch
[31:01.160 --> 31:02.840]  of this and an awesome batch of this.
[31:02.840 --> 31:06.320]  And now you're working together, like now your neighbor is growing better stuff.
[31:06.320 --> 31:10.680]  They may not get as many pathogens or any pathogens and you're helping yourself.
[31:10.880 --> 31:15.280]  Like helping your neighbor is helping yourself, like helping the community helps you.
[31:15.880 --> 31:20.560]  And if you think that you have something special that can benefit everyone, once everyone
[31:20.560 --> 31:24.720]  has that information, then that thing that you think is special that no one else has been
[31:24.720 --> 31:26.960]  paying attention to is now recognized.
[31:27.880 --> 31:32.880]  And I think that's big with the secondary metabolite concept of flower is that the whole
[31:32.880 --> 31:40.560]  industry is, is, you know, paying attention to mic or to trichome density and, you know,
[31:40.760 --> 31:45.200]  flashy Instagram weed that a lot of the time tastes like cardboard and not paying
[31:45.200 --> 31:46.840]  attention to the secondary metabolites.
[31:47.080 --> 31:52.480]  But once we get information out to everybody and they understand that like this has a
[31:52.480 --> 31:59.160]  different effect, this has a different aroma, a different experience, then, then this
[31:59.160 --> 32:04.000]  thing that you had that was special that no one was paying attention to, people are now
[32:04.280 --> 32:07.840]  seeing that special and now your thing actually is special because it's being recognized
[32:07.840 --> 32:08.880]  and appreciated. Right.
[32:10.360 --> 32:14.760]  So, yeah, I'm all about open sourcing and getting the information out there to people.
[32:17.520 --> 32:21.080]  And the true people that come that are genuine with it, I've never seen them like
[32:21.080 --> 32:24.960]  struggle monetary wise when they do give from their heart.
[32:25.120 --> 32:29.240]  It's like just more people want to support them or however, you know, we can go deeper
[32:29.240 --> 32:30.640]  into that on a metaphysical.
[32:30.640 --> 32:32.360]  It seems like maybe things open up for them.
[32:32.680 --> 32:37.640]  But the ones that truly give to the community, I see a lot of them finding huge success in
[32:37.640 --> 32:42.960]  cannabis or finding other ways to find success using soil science and, you know, even
[32:42.960 --> 32:44.080]  growing micro greens.
[32:44.120 --> 32:49.280]  I mean, there's so many other things that are popping up that I think, you know, to
[32:49.280 --> 32:55.280]  pigeonhole yourself or to feel a certain way, I definitely felt sad, sadness, I think,
[32:55.280 --> 33:00.920]  because I was never really I never truly felt, Luna, that I was given an opportunity to
[33:00.920 --> 33:03.760]  grow commercial cannabis in a living soil setup.
[33:04.000 --> 33:10.240]  You know, you you either have to be, you know, extremely wealthy to take that off or you
[33:10.240 --> 33:11.280]  have to work with the suits.
[33:11.440 --> 33:15.400]  And I just never I think I spoke my mind a little too much for that.
[33:15.400 --> 33:19.880]  So to to bring that down on a microcosm scale, I think what people are going to learn from
[33:19.880 --> 33:23.920]  you today or go down that rabbit hole is there's so many different skill sets.
[33:23.920 --> 33:26.120]  Like if you want to grow cannabis, the opportunity is there.
[33:26.400 --> 33:29.640]  But if you want to find a different you can grow high end wedding flowers.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.120]  There are people doing that in Colorado.
[33:31.120 --> 33:34.440]  I mean, the possibilities are limitless.
[33:34.440 --> 33:38.440]  So when we're talking each and every week here, I want you guys we want you guys to go
[33:38.440 --> 33:40.480]  out and find something else for yourselves as well.
[33:40.480 --> 33:44.600]  We want all individuals to start to have these little businesses so we can help support.
[33:45.080 --> 33:51.160]  That's the community that is really about is where everybody starts to have a little more
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.320]  free time because we've got a little more money in our pockets.
[33:53.480 --> 33:56.400]  We can start to have these deeper discussions.
[33:56.600 --> 33:58.280]  You know, three hours of your time, Luna.
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.000]  I I can't even probably put that on a price tag.
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.800]  You know, you're you're giving it to the community.
[34:03.800 --> 34:04.920]  You're giving from your heart.
[34:04.960 --> 34:07.680]  It's genuine. And I think that goes such a long way.
[34:07.680 --> 34:13.600]  So with all that said, I know that we need to talk about the secondary metabolites.
[34:13.600 --> 34:14.880]  It's the hot topic right now.
[34:14.880 --> 34:19.320]  When we spoke last night, I mean, that was something that popped up to me is I think
[34:19.320 --> 34:23.880]  that especially for the people that are putting in the time each and every week, how do they
[34:23.880 --> 34:30.160]  start to achieve that better cannabis flavor, the aroma from day one when they start to
[34:30.160 --> 34:32.720]  flower and grow flower in this manner?
[34:33.840 --> 34:40.440]  So there's a huge amount of testing that needs to be done on this on this concept.
[34:41.160 --> 34:46.560]  Secondary metabolites aren't being like in the cannabis industry, they're not really
[34:46.560 --> 34:51.120]  being tested for for like commercial purposes, for like selling your product.
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.960]  You know, when you get a terpene profile and a profile, you're not getting your volatile
[34:57.960 --> 35:03.120]  sulfurs and your esters and your phenol profiles, your flavonoid profiles.
[35:03.120 --> 35:05.040]  You know, you're not getting that information.
[35:05.040 --> 35:10.000]  So when it's not tested, it makes it really difficult to correlate or connect one
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.520]  particular thing to another particular volatile compound.
[35:14.760 --> 35:19.080]  And each genetic will have a different profile volatile compounds.
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.800]  For example, skunk, the smell of skunk isn't a terpene.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.320]  It's a sulfur compound.
[35:27.040 --> 35:29.360]  And those aren't really being tested for.
[35:30.160 --> 35:34.080]  But we're seeing that in these organic compounds, there's a lot of testing that's
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.840]  being done. And we're seeing that in these organic systems, we're getting a fuller
[35:39.840 --> 35:45.640]  expression. There's studies that have connected that to biotic and abiotic stress.
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.440]  And the the introduction of an implementation of phytohormones.
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.240]  Phytohormones are created by the soil in conjunction through fermentation with organic
[35:59.280 --> 36:01.440]  compounds. So these are amino acid conjugates.
[36:01.440 --> 36:03.960]  And I'm sorry if I'm just like blowing over people's heads here.
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.920]  I'm trying not to. So it's all carbon, right?
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.120]  So amino acids, this is going to be I'm trying to I'm trying to stay layman's here.
[36:14.760 --> 36:18.440]  So carbon makes a whole bunch of different stuff.
[36:19.800 --> 36:29.080]  Carbon is pulled from the atmosphere in most cases during these plant interactions by
[36:29.080 --> 36:31.360]  other microbes and by plants.
[36:31.360 --> 36:36.720]  A lot of the carbon in plants is literally carbon dioxide combining with other compounds
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.640]  to create chemical reactions that then will make cells and proteins and such.
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.000]  But down on the molecular level, amino acids are carbon chains.
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.120]  Enzymes are carbon chains.
[36:48.120 --> 36:56.960]  Proteins are made of amino acids through the bonding and processes with enzymes to
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.680]  create these proteins.
[36:59.280 --> 37:01.320]  It's all carbon.
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.400]  And on top of that, the biological aspect and I'm sorry, let me back up and also
[37:07.400 --> 37:08.400]  organic acids.
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.400]  Organic acids, there's a huge, huge, huge range, a huge amount of organic acids.
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.600]  I'm sure there's almost an infinite number and continually making, you know, like
[37:21.600 --> 37:24.360]  continually being formed new compounds that we haven't found.
[37:24.720 --> 37:34.440]  Those interactions with biology create vital hormones, which then are have been shown to
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.120]  trigonal stress responses or trigger certain actions in the cells.
[37:40.320 --> 37:42.840]  Cells are controlled by hormones.
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.960]  So what's going on here is we have biology that is then.
[37:50.960 --> 37:57.240]  Interacting with organic acids that are then fermenting and creating vital hormones,
[37:57.360 --> 38:05.120]  which are then, you know, being integrated by the plant to have specific responses, and
[38:05.120 --> 38:11.640]  these boost metabolic and flavonoid pathways that will then increase the amount of the
[38:11.640 --> 38:19.800]  secondary metabolites in the plant, which which compounds produce specific
[38:20.360 --> 38:21.520]  secondary metabolites.
[38:21.840 --> 38:23.880]  I don't know. I don't think anyone knows.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.240]  I don't I could be wrong.
[38:25.280 --> 38:26.520]  I'm willing to be wrong. I hope I'm wrong.
[38:26.560 --> 38:28.160]  Maybe the information is out there and I just don't know.
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.120]  But from what I understand, that research hasn't been done yet because it's just not.
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.280]  It doesn't it doesn't make people money yet, you know.
[38:40.280 --> 38:47.240]  So like gibberellin, I may have butchered that word gibberellins, they're the byproduct
[38:47.240 --> 38:48.760]  of fungal fermentation.
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.360]  Fungal fermentation with organic acid.
[38:51.720 --> 38:57.760]  Oxins are can be produced by aspergillus with organic acids.
[38:59.960 --> 39:07.360]  Jasmonic acid is created through a literal like crunching of leaf tissues like there's
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.240]  and also is synthesized by certain plants, you know, like like jasmine.
[39:12.920 --> 39:17.400]  And it's volatile and literally communicate with the plants next to it to have a certain
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.280]  effect, you know, through the air.
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.040]  Like it's it's it's fucking mind blowing, like all these different things that can
[39:25.040 --> 39:26.600]  happen and that affect plants.
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.040]  It makes all of this an art, you know, and all these organic compounds, I keep looking
[39:34.040 --> 39:35.920]  outside. They're in our environment.
[39:36.240 --> 39:38.160]  They're in the plants that surround us.
[39:38.640 --> 39:44.840]  We can take them and integrate them through, you know, vermicomposting through
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.920]  thermophilic composting and take their phenols, take their polysaccharides, their energy
[39:49.920 --> 39:56.200]  sources, their their flavonoids, you know, introduce them into our soil, which then have
[39:56.200 --> 40:01.400]  a particular effect on the diversity of microbiology or the diversity of microbes, which
[40:01.400 --> 40:06.800]  will then create a specific expression of vital compounds, which will then create a
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.320]  specific expression in the plant.
[40:08.640 --> 40:16.320]  And it's it's like that concept right there gives you this fucking huge potential for
[40:16.320 --> 40:19.080]  like all these different things that you can be doing.
[40:19.080 --> 40:23.360]  And that's one of the reasons why I hate rigid systems.
[40:23.360 --> 40:24.840]  I hate like.
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.920]  Go get this soil, do this thing at this time, every time, like blah, blah, blah, blah,
[40:30.920 --> 40:37.960]  you know, like fuck that, like go find the growth tips of, you know, some weeds that you
[40:37.960 --> 40:44.480]  have and ferment them and introduce them, you know, go go find the the bark of something
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.640]  and and tincture it and introduce it to to your bed.
[40:48.600 --> 40:54.920]  You know, go do a lactobacillus breakdown of some kind of, you know, carbohydrate source
[40:54.920 --> 40:58.840]  or polysaccharide source or, you know, take you know, take a polysaccharide.
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.360]  This is a cool one. Take a polysaccharide, introduce the enzyme that breaks down that
[41:02.360 --> 41:04.480]  polysaccharide and give it to your plants.
[41:04.600 --> 41:10.000]  And like there's all these, you know, like who knows what it's going to do and is it
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  going to do something huge?
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.520]  You know, like, I don't know, but like they all the science is there like that these things
[41:17.520 --> 41:20.080]  affect our diversity.
[41:20.080 --> 41:24.080]  And I think that that's where the art form really comes from.
[41:24.080 --> 41:28.960]  You know, like sprout a seed, you know, use a sprouted seed tea of of different seeds,
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.240]  find a seed that's local to your environment that's being grown and blend it up and
[41:34.240 --> 41:35.520]  introduce it to your soil.
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.840]  This is what's going to create a topographically unique flower.
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.440]  You know, it's like a topographically unique cannabis and experience.
[41:48.120 --> 41:55.640]  It's like integrating natural farming concepts from your local environment to to make
[41:55.640 --> 41:56.840]  something fucking badass.
[41:56.840 --> 41:57.840]  It's like now you're a chef.
[41:57.840 --> 41:59.720]  Now you're doing this cool fucking shit.
[41:59.720 --> 42:00.880]  Like to me, it's super cool.
[42:00.880 --> 42:03.160]  Like I'm it gets me really excited.
[42:03.160 --> 42:07.160]  And like, I really love that just like my life is like waking up and making some weird
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.680]  fucking concoction and like giving it to my plants.
[42:13.840 --> 42:18.440]  And, you know, a lot of the times, you know, like I'm not doing side by sides and I don't
[42:18.440 --> 42:19.840]  even I don't even really care.
[42:20.640 --> 42:23.920]  But like when I do them, I see the response in my plants.
[42:23.920 --> 42:26.360]  I see what they do after I make them.
[42:27.040 --> 42:29.480]  And that's that's enough for me.
[42:29.720 --> 42:37.520]  Sure, I could do all these documented experiments and, you know, measure the difference
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.600]  between the two and see, you know, if I have a different expression of specific compounds,
[42:42.600 --> 42:44.600]  you know, at the end result through a lot of testing and stuff.
[42:45.200 --> 42:46.640]  And maybe that's really important to people.
[42:47.640 --> 42:49.320]  And go ahead and do it, you know, if you want.
[42:49.320 --> 42:50.920]  Like that's awesome.
[42:51.160 --> 43:00.160]  But I see what these things do to my plants and I experience the expression at the end
[43:00.560 --> 43:01.080]  and.
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.360]  Yeah, well, that one that one photo of Ken can go up, I even reposted that because I
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.360]  just thought it was gorgeous right there in the middle there, all the plants to the left
[43:12.360 --> 43:15.160]  of the worm with the oh, with me checking out my plants.
[43:15.600 --> 43:16.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:17.120 --> 43:19.520]  Knowing how hard that is to achieve.
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.080]  It's like when you're talking about art, you know, artistic, but at the same time, you
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.360]  are a chef, obviously, because you're creating from my experience, there's no bag soil,
[43:30.360 --> 43:35.320]  there's no commercial soil that you could run with that many plants and be able to have
[43:35.320 --> 43:36.320]  it that dialed in.
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.960]  So, you know, when someone else sees that, they realize, OK, not only did you use
[43:40.960 --> 43:44.920]  whatever you probably started with to build that up, but you've continued to improve
[43:44.920 --> 43:46.960]  that. So now it's become a utopia.
[43:46.960 --> 43:49.400]  We love to say like it's alive and thriving.
[43:49.400 --> 43:53.440]  I mean, there's just so much going on there that the plants are look like they're just
[43:53.440 --> 43:54.600]  growing with such ease.
[43:54.600 --> 43:56.400]  They have the praying leaves.
[43:56.400 --> 43:57.400]  They're just gorgeous.
[43:57.640 --> 44:00.200]  You know, the way that the sun's coming in in that photo.
[44:00.200 --> 44:06.200]  I mean, that's kind of what everybody wishes their their stuff would look like.
[44:06.840 --> 44:08.880]  Thank you. Yeah, I thank you.
[44:08.880 --> 44:11.160]  I really appreciate that. I put a lot of love into it.
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.240]  And I really focus on making nutrients available.
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.720]  Like you can set the foundation, but like there's a lot of processes that take time
[44:22.720 --> 44:25.160]  to establish in soil.
[44:25.480 --> 44:27.840]  And I like to kickstart a lot of those processes.
[44:27.840 --> 44:31.480]  So like in the beginning of a soil life, I have like a particular approach to kickstart
[44:31.480 --> 44:34.080]  it. And then as it's going to perpetuate it.
[44:34.880 --> 44:37.160]  And so that was actually my first run in that soil.
[44:37.440 --> 44:42.080]  And I think it looks super fucking healthy, right?
[44:42.080 --> 44:43.800]  Like I loved that run.
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.120]  It was really beautiful.
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.840]  And in the vegetative state, it was just so lush and happy.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.280]  I'd be happy to take you guys out to the greenhouse.
[44:51.280 --> 44:52.640]  I just have to figure out how to.
[44:54.840 --> 44:59.320]  Because I'm on a Wi-Fi network here, I'd have to go to a different one to get out there
[44:59.320 --> 45:00.480]  and be able to talk to you all.
[45:00.480 --> 45:03.880]  But if we could figure something out, I'd love to take you out to the greenhouse and
[45:03.880 --> 45:05.320]  show you what I'm doing right now.
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.920]  Oh, the audience would absolutely love that.
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.040]  Like, you know, it's always the Wizard of Oz taking you behind the curtain.
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.000]  And showing, I mean, it's very hard to achieve what she's doing.
[45:18.000 --> 45:18.520]  So when...
[45:18.520 --> 45:20.120]  Peter, help!
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.200]  I would think that if you wanted to try, Luna, we could we could fill some airtime
[45:27.200 --> 45:31.880]  here and you could run over there if you wanted to and see if you can easily just pop
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.120]  on. And then if not, we could potentially figure out some stuff.
[45:35.680 --> 45:36.560]  How far in are we?
[45:36.760 --> 45:37.400]  What time is it?
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.760]  And if you're going to use your phone, make sure it's...
[45:44.120 --> 45:45.320]  Yeah, it is. It's plugged in right now.
[45:45.360 --> 45:46.840]  It was fully charged when I started.
[45:46.840 --> 45:48.040]  It'll drink.
[45:48.040 --> 45:54.040]  And I also have another device I can figure out.
[45:54.040 --> 45:58.480]  I could connect it to one while I'm still on this one and then switch.
[45:59.720 --> 46:01.480]  But we've only been on for like 45 minutes.
[46:01.680 --> 46:04.640]  Let's go for a little bit longer and then we'll go out there.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  Does that sound good?
[46:06.400 --> 46:11.480]  Yeah. And you know, I'd love to add some of your rants, which I love.
[46:11.520 --> 46:14.120]  Yeah, it's nice to have another ranter on the show.
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.360]  But there has to be some profanity sprinkled in, you know?
[46:19.360 --> 46:20.360]  That's another...
[46:20.360 --> 46:22.520]  Oh, sorry. Should I not?
[46:22.520 --> 46:23.520]  Should I not be saying that?
[46:23.520 --> 46:26.040]  No, I was just saying that's how you know people are authentic.
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.600]  When people are too like prim and proper, it's like that's not how you talk.
[46:30.080 --> 46:30.440]  You know?
[46:30.440 --> 46:32.520]  No, he was trying to be professional.
[46:32.840 --> 46:33.800]  I try to be professional.
[46:34.040 --> 46:35.040]  No, don't worry about it.
[46:35.040 --> 46:36.040]  It's not a big deal.
[46:36.040 --> 46:37.040]  Yeah, just be you.
[46:37.280 --> 46:38.280]  It's not a big deal.
[46:38.800 --> 46:45.720]  So, yeah, there has been a lot of studies on a collegiate and university level
[46:46.160 --> 46:50.200]  on some of these interactions that you were talking about.
[46:50.200 --> 46:55.000]  But unfortunately, they're never done on cannabis because cannabis has been,
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  you know, outlawed.
[46:56.000 --> 47:03.640]  And, you know, and so we're years behind the science on what these expressions
[47:03.640 --> 47:08.280]  are. And the cannabis plant is probably the best plant to be using to study
[47:08.280 --> 47:10.600]  this, these effects because it is so quick.
[47:10.640 --> 47:13.720]  It is. It has a very quick lifespan.
[47:14.040 --> 47:15.160]  It's easy to work with.
[47:15.160 --> 47:16.200]  It's vigorous.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.160]  And a lot of colleges are now beginning to study it.
[47:20.200 --> 47:22.840]  But we're not going to get real good data for a few years.
[47:23.200 --> 47:28.240]  But they're going to be building on the knowledge that came from specific plants
[47:28.280 --> 47:32.280]  like coffee, like grapes, saffron's another good one.
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.800]  That where there was so much money, hops is another one where there was so much money
[47:37.800 --> 47:44.040]  involved in this plant that the colleges did get paid to do these studies.
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.920]  But that has to be transferred over into the cannabis plant.
[47:47.920 --> 47:49.960]  But people like you are already doing it.
[47:50.920 --> 47:58.520]  So what you're the ability that you have to experiment and using your gut instinct is
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.920]  the key to opening up other people's minds to these facts.
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.320]  Like, hey, if you really want to understand more about the interactions of these organic
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.520]  acids. And like you said, there are so many of them.
[48:10.880 --> 48:13.560]  Try just try it on a on a scale.
[48:13.560 --> 48:16.000]  Don't don't do everything because you're not Luna.
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.360]  Just try a little bit on one plant and compare it to the other ones so that you don't make
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.680]  mistakes or end up putting too much on and throwing things out of balance.
[48:27.280 --> 48:27.800]  I know.
[48:27.800 --> 48:29.880]  Super important what you just said.
[48:29.880 --> 48:30.880]  I just want to touch on that real quick.
[48:30.880 --> 48:31.840]  I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[48:33.320 --> 48:36.760]  If you add too many enzymes to your plants, you will cook them.
[48:36.840 --> 48:42.440]  If you add too much of a particular enzyme, you can you can literally melt your worms.
[48:43.240 --> 48:45.640]  So start super, super small.
[48:46.680 --> 48:53.680]  You can definitely mess up your soil biology big time by like a big one that people do.
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.680]  It's like pineapple, pineapple ferments, you know, super high in bromelain.
[49:01.560 --> 49:04.440]  And it's a proteolytic enzyme.
[49:04.480 --> 49:05.800]  It breaks down proteins.
[49:05.880 --> 49:07.000]  You will melt your worms.
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.120]  You will melt your roots.
[49:08.200 --> 49:10.440]  You will kill your whole fucking run.
[49:11.240 --> 49:12.760]  So be careful what you're using.
[49:13.040 --> 49:18.600]  If you're diligent, look up the compound profile of what you're using.
[49:18.920 --> 49:20.840]  There is a resource called Dr.
[49:20.840 --> 49:25.880]  Duke's Phyto Compound Library, I think is what it is.
[49:25.920 --> 49:32.000]  You can input either the seed or the stock or the flower or the fruit of a particular
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.960]  plant into this database and it'll show you the organic compound profile.
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.840]  And if you're really diligent, you can look up each individual one and see what their
[49:42.840 --> 49:45.360]  effects are on plants and on soil.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.400]  I've done this a good handful of times and I've kind of debunked some stuff that the
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.480]  claims that are kind of passed around in the cannabis community about certain things
[49:55.480 --> 49:57.520]  containing certain things, which they don't.
[49:57.720 --> 50:03.320]  They contain the compounds which are then fermented by biology to create those things.
[50:04.400 --> 50:06.520]  So, yeah. So I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[50:06.520 --> 50:07.240]  Please continue.
[50:08.240 --> 50:10.080]  Oh, that's what this show is all about.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.320]  Don't stress about that.
[50:12.840 --> 50:13.360]  Yeah.
[50:14.080 --> 50:15.800]  You know, and that was a great resource.
[50:15.800 --> 50:21.080]  And Ken, if you could try to find that and post it in the chat or pull it up for the
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.120]  audience to see, because those are the kinds of resources that are so fantastic.
[50:25.840 --> 50:29.880]  And when you said that, there was another one that came to my mind and now it popped
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.480]  out of my head. And hopefully it'll come back soon.
[50:33.480 --> 50:43.400]  But yeah, understanding that there are what we call the biogeochemical reactions are what
[50:43.400 --> 50:45.120]  is creating these things.
[50:45.120 --> 50:50.720]  So again, it goes back to the diversity of your inputs, especially if you want to if
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.280]  you want to have a certain enzyme available at a certain time.
[50:54.760 --> 50:59.640]  The key is, like she said, is to put put the plant material in there or ferment.
[50:59.880 --> 51:03.120]  You can get crazy and ferment the plant, but then it's mobile.
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.800]  Now you're dealing with mobile nutrients.
[51:05.040 --> 51:09.800]  Mobile nutrients can cause these imbalances like she's talking about that will cause
[51:09.800 --> 51:14.040]  damage to your microbial population, worms or and or plants.
[51:14.400 --> 51:18.760]  So it's better to use the plant material compost to break it down.
[51:18.760 --> 51:24.840]  But now it's still in a non-mobile form so that the microbes can use it when the plant
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.640]  requests it. I think that's it.
[51:26.640 --> 51:27.800]  That's a safer way.
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.360]  And believe me, Luna, I preach diversity, diversity, diversity.
[51:31.400 --> 51:36.240]  When when I'm making a cold compost, which I loved how you touched on mesophilic versus
[51:36.240 --> 51:43.440]  thermophilic, mesophilic does not break it down and make it a volatile, organic compound.
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.960]  So you're you're not losing it during the thermophilic process, which you do when you
[51:47.960 --> 51:49.080]  do go super hot.
[51:50.320 --> 51:53.800]  So that's and this is the shit I preach about cold composting.
[51:54.080 --> 51:55.320]  But you can't use manures.
[51:55.320 --> 51:57.200]  If you use manures, you're going to get in problems.
[51:57.200 --> 51:58.360]  You're going to you're going to get in trouble.
[51:58.840 --> 52:06.440]  So if you go low and slow and maintain that that sweet spot of about 85 degrees and 70
[52:06.440 --> 52:12.600]  percent moisture, you will start to break stuff down, but not into not into an acid,
[52:12.600 --> 52:13.920]  not into something that's mobile.
[52:14.200 --> 52:15.520]  It'll still be there.
[52:16.200 --> 52:21.280]  It won't be available if the plant feeds microbial communities to break it down and
[52:21.280 --> 52:22.480]  release it back to the plant.
[52:22.960 --> 52:24.640]  So I love what you're talking about.
[52:24.640 --> 52:31.160]  I love how you dived down these rabbit holes amongst the community where they say, hey,
[52:31.160 --> 52:32.760]  if you use this, it does that.
[52:32.760 --> 52:38.720]  And that's something that Brian and I have made a point to with this platform is try to
[52:38.720 --> 52:43.840]  break the bro science out of it and get people real information so they don't make
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.920]  mistakes or they don't get the wrong reactions.
[52:47.200 --> 52:51.560]  But there's nothing worse than having a wrong reaction and then being pissed off and
[52:51.560 --> 52:52.640]  saying this doesn't work.
[52:53.000 --> 52:53.960]  It does work.
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.880]  You put too much on or you didn't put enough on one of the other.
[52:58.280 --> 53:00.080]  But there's there's a lot to this.
[53:00.080 --> 53:05.760]  And so it's great to have a guest like you today that can push the audience to research
[53:05.760 --> 53:10.920]  more stuff themselves, to look into these kinds of things, because it will give you a leg
[53:10.920 --> 53:13.440]  up and it will make you different than everybody else.
[53:13.960 --> 53:18.280]  And the fact you talk about working with your neighbors, man, that is so important at this
[53:18.280 --> 53:21.080]  point in time. People, it's not about making money anymore.
[53:21.080 --> 53:23.600]  It's about changing what's going on.
[53:24.120 --> 53:30.960]  The practices that you're doing, Luna, can be applied to soil anywhere, landscape, vegetable
[53:30.960 --> 53:36.440]  garden. And since the dawn or since I started getting involved with the cannabis
[53:36.440 --> 53:41.680]  community, I'm like this plant will lead a revolution into agriculture because you've
[53:41.800 --> 53:45.400]  proven you don't need NPK over and over and over again.
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.800]  So big ups to you.
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.720]  And here's one.
[53:49.720 --> 53:53.160]  I believe you posted something about sulfates.
[53:53.760 --> 53:55.000]  Was that you that I saw?
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.680]  You didn't have any other options.
[53:57.280 --> 53:59.880]  And so you were shown three bags of sulfates.
[54:00.280 --> 54:01.280]  I forget which one.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.080]  Yes, I did. So there's another.
[54:05.160 --> 54:08.840]  Yeah, there's another form like potassium sulfate.
[54:08.840 --> 54:10.560]  You can use potassium silicate.
[54:10.960 --> 54:15.560]  And now you're going to get an even better reaction because the silicate will help to
[54:15.560 --> 54:21.120]  support cell strength, flavor, texture, a lot of these things.
[54:21.600 --> 54:25.840]  So look into those, look into those and try to get away from sulfates, because like you
[54:25.840 --> 54:28.320]  said, those do cause buildup.
[54:28.320 --> 54:29.480]  They do cause problems.
[54:29.480 --> 54:34.000]  They do stunt growth, whereas the silicate is not going to cause the same kind of
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.160]  problems. I believe there's even a calcium silicate now available.
[54:39.400 --> 54:45.240]  So I mean, I think there's the chat kind of went wild.
[54:45.240 --> 54:49.240]  They want to research when you mentioned there was a website where they could go and
[54:49.240 --> 54:51.320]  find out if they wanted to do their due diligence.
[54:51.320 --> 54:53.600]  Could you restate that, please?
[54:54.640 --> 54:56.440]  Yeah, I just didn't find it.
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.160]  He's having some problems behind the scenes.
[54:59.520 --> 55:02.920]  Let me see if I can find it real quick, because I think I may have gotten the name
[55:02.920 --> 55:04.160]  wrong, but it's Dr.
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.680]  Duke's phytochemical database.
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.520]  And I love it when the audience wants to go down the rabbit hole, Leighton.
[55:14.280 --> 55:17.360]  Yeah, that's great. I'm glad to inspire people.
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.200]  So Dr.
[55:19.200 --> 55:25.760]  Duke's phytochemical and ethnobotanical database at NAL.
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.040]  How can I get that and send it in the private chat?
[55:31.840 --> 55:33.520]  Ken can get it up there for everyone.
[55:33.560 --> 55:34.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.960]  OK, so the yeah, the website is kind of difficult to read to someone because it's
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.200]  phytochem.nal.usda.gov slash phytochem.
[55:45.920 --> 55:49.480]  So, yeah, I got it copied.
[55:49.520 --> 55:51.160]  How can I best send this to you, Ken?
[55:52.400 --> 55:55.080]  Do you see the private? We can talk to each other privately.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.280]  So I have you on my phone.
[55:57.400 --> 55:58.880]  I'm on my laptop right here.
[55:58.880 --> 56:00.680]  Can I send it to your Instagram?
[56:02.320 --> 56:05.880]  You can send it to my Instagram or to my email, either one.
[56:07.080 --> 56:11.440]  OK, it'll be faster for me to send it to your Instagram.
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.360]  And while we're waiting for that, Neverwinter Farms, absolutely.
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.200]  I have a I have a course that's going to go live, hopefully on Saturday, on how to
[56:22.880 --> 56:29.680]  make a very, very diverse biological community through cold composting that then I
[56:29.680 --> 56:32.360]  teach you how to liquefy and apply to soil.
[56:32.360 --> 56:37.640]  The reason why I teach liquefaction, because it's really the best way to deliver
[56:37.640 --> 56:38.960]  microbes into the soil.
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.840]  Traditionally, we used a lot of top dressing techniques.
[56:42.160 --> 56:47.080]  But what we learned is that when you top dress a very biologically rich compost, you're
[56:47.080 --> 56:51.160]  losing 50 percent of your organisms right out of the gate due to oxidization from
[56:51.440 --> 56:57.120]  exposure to air, as well as the UVs that they expose to.
[56:57.120 --> 56:58.600]  And it dries out very quickly.
[56:58.640 --> 57:02.680]  So that's not the best way to deliver microbes into the soil.
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.160]  But keep your eyes open.
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.560]  I'll be doing a post on Instagram when it's up and available so that everybody can
[57:09.560 --> 57:15.960]  have an opportunity to to get through the process of understanding mesophilic or cold
[57:15.960 --> 57:19.880]  composting and then and then extractions, how to extract those microbes.
[57:20.840 --> 57:22.240]  So excited about that.
[57:22.240 --> 57:27.080]  It's been six months in the working and way more work than I anticipated, but it's
[57:27.080 --> 57:28.120]  almost ready to go live.
[57:28.960 --> 57:30.680]  Do you like compost, Keith?
[57:31.600 --> 57:33.480]  That's what I was going to talk about, Luna.
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.360]  Yeah, I the difference in the extracts and all that with compared to doing all the work
[57:39.360 --> 57:40.880]  of the team. Yeah.
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.880]  So I used to do teas, but I learned that that window is just a pain in the ass.
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.280]  So what I'll do is I'll make an extract and then I'll add the foods in right before
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.880]  application. So if if I don't even finish the application that day, I can still come
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.360]  back tomorrow and finish it without having to worry about a crash, a biological crash.
[58:02.360 --> 58:05.200]  So I'm pretty much moved away from teas now.
[58:05.200 --> 58:13.080]  If if if I have a client, a third floor building or in the city somewhere and they only
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.600]  have a little bit of inoculant, then I encourage them.
[58:15.600 --> 58:17.240]  Yeah. Start activated.
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.640]  Just don't add food so you can still bubble the stuff and activate it without adding
[58:22.640 --> 58:24.360]  foods, which caused the crash.
[58:24.840 --> 58:28.160]  But for the most part, I've been extracts for a long time now.
[58:28.480 --> 58:29.520]  I just find them easier.
[58:30.520 --> 58:31.520]  Cool.
[58:31.520 --> 58:34.800]  That's another art form to doing.
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.480]  Yes. It's like a difference of approach and they're going to have different results
[58:39.480 --> 58:44.640]  and everyone does things differently and and some things work better for different people
[58:44.640 --> 58:47.760]  for different reasons. And and I think that's great.
[58:48.880 --> 58:50.360]  I do use compost teas.
[58:51.240 --> 58:52.960]  So do you add foods when you're doing?
[58:53.960 --> 59:00.080]  So that's one of the things that I like to play with is I so I don't use molasses, I
[59:00.080 --> 59:05.080]  don't use monosaccharides, simple carbohydrates, I don't use sugar.
[59:06.840 --> 59:15.200]  In like sugar form or in molasses form, I use fruits or ferments or aloe vera.
[59:15.720 --> 59:21.880]  This one of the one of those reels that I made, it kind of walks through a oat flour
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.960]  and beet juice compost tea that I made.
[59:26.960 --> 59:29.280]  I'm adept with a microscope.
[59:29.480 --> 59:34.040]  I'm definitely not a microscope master, but I know a good amount of microscopy.
[59:35.040 --> 59:41.240]  So one of the videos that I posted, it actually goes through and shows images after
[59:41.240 --> 59:44.320]  24 hours, after 48 hours and after 72 hours.
[59:44.600 --> 59:53.040]  And the change in the the population of microbes in the soil or I'm sorry, in the tea
[59:53.040 --> 59:56.000]  and the tea. And so.
[59:57.560 --> 01:00:04.840]  What I like to do is I'd like to scope the soil, see if there's any lacking organisms
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:12.160]  inside the soil and then tailor a compost tea to to produce those organisms.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:20.840]  And how that works is certain certain microbes, certain either lower bacteria or
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:27.280]  protozoa or lower fungi will show themselves in compost teas.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.200]  You're not going to get like a huge diversity of fungi from a compost tea because a
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.200]  lot of fungi don't grow in water.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.720]  They use carbon sources to grow on.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.440]  But you can get some that will start to grow and some lower things like like zygomycetes
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.640]  and mucors, which which sometimes people are weary about, there's a lot of discussion
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.640]  about whether or not you want those in your soil.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.840]  I'm getting a little off track, but I'll come back to that.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:04.960]  So I will scope my tea and make sure that I have a diversity of lower bacteria,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.760]  protozoa, the range of protozoa from like ciliates to flagellates, rotifers never really
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.080]  show up in compost teas.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.400]  And then.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.960]  Yeah, and fungi like lower fungi that will start to form while trying to make sure that
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.760]  you're not seeing, you know, like a bunch of my cities, but there is a lot of evidence to
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:37.960]  suggest and research now that shows that my cities in combination with specific endophytes
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:44.400]  and bacteria will actually team up with these my cities and make them beneficial for the
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.960]  soil, which is pretty far out there stuff.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.760]  But it's important to acknowledge.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.440]  Anyway, so I'll tailor my teas with different inputs.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.080]  I like to change it up.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.400]  I like to feed them different things, feed them different polysaccharides and polyphenols
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.720]  to to create a different diversity, add like different carbon sources, add like amino acids
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.160]  that will affect what multiplies in there or add humates that will affect what multiplies in
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:19.960]  there. But I feel like what you said, an extract is going to have more diversity.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.280]  I feel like it will have lower microbial density.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:28.200]  With the multiplication, adding a food source and the multiplication, you will see certain
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.800]  organisms outcompete other organisms like for sure with an extract, you will see a
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.200]  maximizing of diversity with a top dress.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.160]  I think you kind of maintain that diversity, but also like you said, when you are oxidizing
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.240]  it, you're losing a lot of that, too.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.800]  So it's just like your trade off of like, what are you trying to do and what do you want to
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.440]  do and why and what is your soil need and how do you want to use it?
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.000]  And how do you get it there?
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.120]  And that's a part of the art form of soil that we were talking about.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.480]  So some things might work for different reasons.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.760]  You know, maybe you don't have the time or whatever and you don't want to put stuff under
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.960]  the microscope. Like that was a super arduous process.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:17.360]  It took me days to make a tea, you know, and I was scoping it every day and I'm taking
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.200]  pictures of it and, you know, adding things at certain points.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.120]  And then, you know, I added aloe vera at the very end of it because it has a really
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:34.200]  awesome profile of organic acids and, you know, amino acids, vitamins and minerals and
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.240]  polysaccharides and stuff.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.560]  And I add that at the end because I don't want to use it as a food source.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.600]  I want to keep it kind of in its original state and then introduce it to the soil and
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.200]  then let the soil biology like do all of its cool stuff with it.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.400]  And then I posted a video also that compares before the tea.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.880]  I think it's part of the same video.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.000]  It's before the tea and then after the tea.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.680]  And like the plants were super stoked before and then after they were just like peaking,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.120]  like praying, you know, like their turgidity went through the roof.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.560]  And that's what I love, you know, that's what I love seeing and that's what kind of
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.600]  validates all these cool little weird things.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.000]  No, that was something that was a huge quick fix.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:19.760]  If you have the knowledge, like I'm not I can't assume that very many people in the chat
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.480]  would have the ability to not only add the right components, brew it out to the right
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:30.520]  time, but then apply it at the appropriate time to get those plant reactions.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.480]  But if you can do that, it's alchemy.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.280]  It's beyond the it takes years of experience.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.280]  That's what I'm trying to say is it you've been doing this for a long time and that's
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.040]  what giving you the ability to do it.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:49.480]  So the audience should follow you, listen to your reels so that they better understand
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.360]  how to do these processes, because it's not something you just read in a book or pull
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.720]  out of your past.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.160]  Oh, I remember the resource.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:04.520]  Ken, there was a book that was given to every farmer back in the end of the century,
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:11.480]  around 1900, that showed all the plants that liked different companion plants, what they
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.280]  were and how to use them.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.840]  And I've been looking for this resource for years.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:21.600]  So maybe with your wizardry, but it was a standard handbook that everybody got.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:27.160]  It was part of the wedding betrothal or whatever you want to call it.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.440]  Everybody got. And that was the most powerful book, because if you could find that book,
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:37.120]  now you can say, I'll add these kinds of cover crops.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.120]  But if I take those cover crops and I actually compost them or make an extract, I can get
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.000]  the kind of reactions that Loon was talking about, because they work together.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.280]  They work synergistically.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.800]  So again, I've been looking for that resource for years and hopefully I'll find it.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:58.200]  OK, there's there's wizard and then there's, you know, next level.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:03.680]  I know if you can't find it, you expect little old me, brother.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.720]  I mean, I love you, but come on.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.560]  I'll keep looking.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.400]  That leads us into a cool conversation that I'd love to get into, which are companion
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.680]  planning and the root exudates of those companions and how they affect diversity and
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:31.320]  nutrient availability and like the the expression of plants themselves.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.880]  And there's some kind of there's some kind of anecdotal information out there about it
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.400]  that I think is kind of cool.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.840]  It's a little speculative, but I think it's kind of fun to just mention.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.640]  But then there's a lot of like solid, solid science behind having companion plants.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.120]  So I the season where I grew all those monsters, if you scroll through my my my profile,
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.800]  you'll see I have these like 15 foot wide, 13 foot tall plants.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.600]  And it was something like 400 gallons of soil.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:16.400]  And one of the things that I did is I introduced a bunch of rye and rye is is
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.720]  fungirion and.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.560]  Sorry, I get distracted easily.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.520]  The the so what's happening, what's going on here is the roots, they.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.120]  They use photosynthesis to then produce root exudates, which are secondary metabolites,
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:42.200]  organic acids, amino acids, their enzymes, their carbohydrates, and those signal different
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.880]  processes in the soil, in the root zone and the rhizosphere.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.920]  And the cannabis plant does it, too.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.360]  It communicates to the soil, you know, hey, I need more potassium.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.600]  I need more of this micronutrient, this macronutrient, this trace element.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.640]  I need more of this.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:07.320]  And so I'm going to release this enzyme or this carbohydrate that creates a covalent
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:14.320]  bonding where it changes the structure of an element or of a molecule to then be readily
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.600]  available and uptaken by the plants.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.800]  And that's not the only way the nutrients are uptaken.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.160]  But that is is one of them.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:30.080]  And when adding all these companion plants, they are also introducing these secondary
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:35.960]  metabolites and these different compounds that will make nutrients more readily available.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.400]  But on top of that, they have this really cool, this really cool characteristic or provides
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:49.840]  a cool characteristics of redox, which is a cool word that that's kind of kind of now
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.120]  being talked about by people.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.800]  But and I'm not you know, this is one of those things I'm not like super, super
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.520]  knowledgeable about.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:05.160]  Understand about redox is it's the availability of free electrons in the soil and
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:11.200]  their ability to then be used during other bonding processes, during other chemical
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.600]  processes to then change one compound into another.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.960]  And so.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.800]  So having this this level of available or free electrons in the soil allows for like a
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.200]  really quick nutrient exchange and ryegrass is one of the best ones doing it.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.960]  Rye and buckwheat.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.720]  And now I think about it, it was the year before that I used rye.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.240]  Last year I used buckwheat and you can do a combination of the two.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:47.720]  And by adding these companion plants also, you can promote the integration of beneficial
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.280]  insects. You can have insects that are coming to these plants also that are living there
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.320]  that are helping you like, you know, lacewing larvae or whatever is in your environment.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.960]  And if you introduce them to your garden, also you introduce these beneficial insects.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.040]  Now they have a place to live.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:09.440]  And there are particular insect blends that you can buy online or you just go find stuff
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.080]  in your native environment if you want to.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.920]  Or if you have a particular effect that you're looking for in a particular plant provides
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.280]  it, you can introduce them as companion plants.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.440]  I did a whole bunch of buckwheat and there's I know there's images on my Instagram that
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.880]  during like early vegetative stage were like my pots are just like full of fucking
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.720]  buckwheat and there's little white flowers everywhere and there's bees flying around
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.560]  and there's butterflies flying around.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.920]  And a lot of people may not want butterflies in their gardens, but early veg is not a big
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:45.800]  deal, I guess. But that's a really cool concept that I think people are lacking on is
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.720]  having companion plants providing root exudates to your soil, increasing the charge
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  through these these electrons allows for really quick nutrient uptake and nutrient
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.600]  exchange. One of the anecdotal, speculative concepts that people are touching on that
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.440]  I've heard people talk about and I've heard people kind of say is fact on the Internet
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:20.000]  quite a bit, which I really feel like isn't, is that a lot of the so we know that like
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:30.240]  flavor comes from the specific biology in combination with organic acids, not entirely,
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.680]  but contributing factor.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:39.880]  These these processes with the plant help bring out these smells and the aromas and
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.000]  these tastes in the plant.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:48.520]  People are speculating that introducing those plants that secrete this particular
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:54.520]  specific root exudates, the secondary metabolites into the soil will then promote those
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:03.440]  specific flavors and aromas in the cannabis plant, which is a really fucking cool idea
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:10.680]  to me, because, you know, like what if you introduce, you know, jasmine or lavender or
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.000]  roses and the root exudates are promoting those expressions into the cannabis plant?
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.520]  It's just like, oh, fucking cool is that, you know, but I don't know if it's real.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.640]  So, you know what?
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.920]  Let me let me touch on that a little bit, because it actually is fact.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.360]  And if you don't believe me, check, try this.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.520]  All right. Grow a tomato plant and plant a very hot pepper plant right next to that tomato
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.600]  plant. Those tomatoes will have a sting to them.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.800]  So we know that you're spot on about the exudate exchange at the root interface between
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.240]  plants. We know that's real.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:53.040]  And we also know that if you plant a very hot pepper plant next to a tomato plant, that you
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.600]  are going to get that expression of the defenses of the pepper plant taken in by the tomato
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.480]  plant. So is it true with all flavonoids?
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.600]  Maybe not. Maybe it's only the defense mechanisms of the two different plants that are
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.800]  going to work together to protect each other.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.240]  But there is definitely something to that.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:19.160]  And also, there was a study I read somewhere about somebody introducing cherry tree
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:28.920]  the blooms, the leaves, the sticks and the chips into a I forget what the name of the it
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.360]  was. It was a type of cherry to enhance the cherry flavors.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.920]  And that did work. Now, that was similar species in similar species.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.280]  So not like a cannabis plant and a hot pepper.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:47.440]  So there's something to it, but we don't have the the true technology or the money.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.520]  I should say money to test and proof it because what you touched on is so important that we
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:14:00.680]  don't so little about these secondary tertiary and maybe beyond metabolic processes that
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.440]  are creating these expressions.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.400]  And the genetic testing to do that is so friggin expensive.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.760]  Nobody can afford to do it unless you're a billionaire and you can play with this shit.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:18.560]  So until the testing comes down or comes to a point where it's more readily available and
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.600]  cost effective, we will probably not know these things in the near future.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.920]  But there is some proof to this stuff.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:33.600]  But again, I can only tell you that we know for sure that the defenses of two different
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.640]  plants can be exchanged and expressed and that the flavor of certain plants or likewise
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.680]  plants can be expressed at a greater level by doing these processes.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.400]  So time for you all to do your own testing and proof it out even further.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.320]  Yeah, look, great.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:49.840]  I love it.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.880]  They should win a great conversation.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.480]  I love this.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.240]  Thanks so much.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.160]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.200]  Cool, man.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.520]  I'm yeah, I'm really enjoying this.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.000]  This is great.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.800]  I love talking about this stuff and I feel like I don't get many opportunities to like
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800]  verbalize them.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.000]  I'm constantly writing.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.040]  I mean, there's very few.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.680]  Yeah, there's very few geeks you can deep dive with.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.680]  Right.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680]  Totally.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680]  So I'm super into it.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]  And this is great.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.200]  I appreciate your knowledge in this conversation.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.080]  I did have one comment for the chat.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080]  Sustainable Hawaii.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.200]  No, she she's a great person.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.040]  No, she she came after that book.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.280]  So I think she built on the work that the original writer did back in the 1800s.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.560]  He's in the chat somewhere.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.760]  He asked about a certain woman.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.040]  But I would highly recommend that you chase her and get her book and read it because
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.080]  there's probably a lot of insights in there.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.920]  Maybe not to the level that the original book was, but it still has something.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.080]  And I I reached out to the guy that showed me that book and see if.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:56.920]  But these kinds of things are so important and your discussion about using buckwheat
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.160]  to bring back indigenous predators, fucking huge, man, huge.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:07.680]  And I don't understand why most Canada's farmers don't have pollinator gardens,
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:13.000]  flower gardens, you know, specific other gardens around to to encourage nature to
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.200]  come back in. And that's one of the.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.000]  Yeah, right. That's one of the reasons why I started that project.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.720]  With Jimmy Perkins, six months ago was because if everybody did this in their yard,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.440]  then they would help affect their neighbor's yard by default because now their yard is
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.120]  so healthy. It's not synthetic.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.560]  These indigenous organisms, as well as insects, can come back and provide added benefit
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.120]  to your space.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.920]  I mean, nobody talks about the fact that, oh, I only eat organic vegetables and I work
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.400]  out in the gym and I do yoga.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.360]  And then you have Camelot come and spray your fucking lawn.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.640]  You know, it's like, dude, if you're so organic in all of your approaches in life, why
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.280]  wouldn't you be organic approaches on your environment, the environment that you live
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.920]  in and work in and play in?
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.200]  Now, I don't know. I get frustrated with that really quickly.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.280]  No, absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.560]  It's super important. And this is bioremediation, right?
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.320]  You implement these concepts on a field and you're going to see the the ecology
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.120]  change. You're going to see your environment adapt and change and become something new.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.160]  You're going to see new plants growing.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:29.400]  You're going to see bugs returning and birds and lizards and all sorts of
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.920]  insects. And I think that that's beautiful.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:40.240]  Like there's such a beautiful power and beautiful aspect and contribution that one can
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.240]  give to the earth by implementing these concepts to a plot of land.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.360]  And sure, we're growing weed, but we don't have to be only growing weed.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.880]  And we can introduce these these seeds that are harboring other insect life, are
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.640]  bringing in different diversities of organisms.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:05.160]  And you're now bioremediating and you can be adding fungal bodies and do
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.440]  micro-remediating.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.800]  And there's a lot of evidence showing Paul Stamets is doing all this stuff, using oyster
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.360]  mushrooms to micro-remediate oil spills.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:20.640]  Like nature does all this beautiful stuff and we can use it to do these things that by
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.960]  ourselves we would never be able to do.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:29.520]  Like you would go out there and till the whole yard with a hoe and do whatever.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.520]  And it's like one person, you're not going to affect much.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.600]  But when you make an alliance with nature, with insects, with the
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:44.080]  microbes, with the fungi and implement them, you can literally change your immediate
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.680]  surroundings. But that impact has an effect on everything else around it.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.840]  You know, like the butterfly effect, right?
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.120]  Like we change a plot and we're affecting a lot of things around us.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.920]  And we affect our plot.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.120]  We affect our neighbors plot.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.560]  Our neighbors plot affects us.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.800]  We need to help everyone so that everything is just improving overall.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.240]  And I think that's the real beauty of applying these concepts.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.200]  It's like, sure, we're growing a great flower that we like to smoke and it feels really
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.880]  good, right? But these concepts can influence the world on a much larger scale.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.360]  Beautiful rant, Luna.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.840]  Oh, we lost her.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.600]  Damn it. That was awesome.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.200]  She got it out at least, you know?
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.680]  Yes, she did. She got it out for sure.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.880]  She might have to leave and come back on.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.840]  Sorry. No, no, no.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.560]  Sorry. My dad just called me and I thought I had all my stuff on Do Not Disturb, but I
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.600]  guess my dad can still call me.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.520]  What was the last thing you heard me say?
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.720]  You were talking about, you just went on a rant about how you can affect positively your
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.200]  neighbor by default if you treat your space, your land, your area in a regenerative
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:08.360]  manner. The old saying, high tide lifts all boats equally.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:15.440]  So why wouldn't you if you had the opportunity to support a greater diversity of insects
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.280]  in your space, in your area?
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]  Why wouldn't you do it?
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.480]  It doesn't take a lot of work.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.000]  It's just a matter of growing plants that they like or that they use as a banker or as a
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.360]  food source. And it's pretty much planting and let them go wild.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.520]  Let nature do its thing.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.080]  So thank you for that rant.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.320]  That was beautiful. Yeah, totally.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:40.240]  Totally. One thing that came to mind that I'd like to mention earlier, we were talking
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.200]  about companion planting and root exudates bringing out certain expressions.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.280]  And this is also anecdotal or speculative and maybe it's not, I don't know.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:56.680]  But I feel like ferments and like tinctures and extractions and stuff, when we harness
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:02.920]  these secondary metabolites of these plant inputs and introduce them to the soil, I feel
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:07.480]  like it's very possible that we're mimicking root exudates that are creating those
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.320]  characteristics of like aroma and stuff in the soil.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:16.920]  And we might actually be harnessing and mimicking root exudates to create different
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:20.000]  expressions through fermentations and tinctures.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.960]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.640]  100%. Spot on.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.520]  Because you've broken it down for the bacteria to easily consume.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.000]  So you're spot on.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]  It's not speculative.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:36.280]  Is it not? I feel like, yeah, I haven't found any research supporting it.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.560]  And I've had this conversation with a few people.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:45.400]  And so I made a ferment of where I was growing this past season.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.720]  There was a bunch of wild blackberries everywhere.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:57.680]  And I fermented the premature blackberry, because from what I understand, premature
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.120]  fruits have higher density of organic compounds.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.840]  So I took like all the premature fruit.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.440]  And I actually have an image of it on my Instagram, too.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.560]  If you scroll down from, it would probably be in like July of 21, around there.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.480]  And I made a ferment.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:21.320]  I made like a K&F style ferment, a fermented plant juice with brown sugar and these
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.560]  premature blackberries.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:30.960]  And I mean, like, I swear that the expression came through on the flower, like the berry
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.720]  expression came through.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.360]  But also I was growing stuff that had the DJ Shorts blueberry as like a parent.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.040]  It was one of my moon cheese crusts.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.560]  But like the berry aroma was, I mean, like, I don't really know.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.560]  But like I feel like it really did.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.200]  It brought out that like berry expression a lot.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.920]  But I definitely saw like an immediate response in the plants.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.000]  Let's suss that out a little bit.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.440]  So when you're saying that the berry came through in expression, was it a terpene?
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.960]  Was it something that you tasted or was it just the smell of the canopy?
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.160]  Both. Both.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.800]  Like the smell, like the.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:21.080]  There was like these notes of blueberry and raspberry in the aroma and in the taste
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.080]  afterwards. I didn't do a side by side, so I don't know if it wouldn't have been there
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.840]  regardless. But I used a berry input and I got a lot of berry expression.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.000]  I also had a genetic that had berry expression in it already.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.200]  So like, you know, maybe I shouldn't have even mentioned it, but I thought it was kind
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.520]  of cool. I really don't know whether or not it made a huge effect, but.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.680]  It was like berry.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:51.120]  Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned it because, again, it's using nature on its own.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.680]  Whether they're coming through in a metabolite or a metabolic process.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:05.000]  And we know for sure fermenting stuff makes it so much more bioavailable.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.880]  And that's the whole purpose of fermenting is to make it more bioavailable, whether it's for
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:15.640]  your own cut, bio, for you as a person or for your plant or for your soil.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.400]  So I definitely think that there is a lot to that.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.080]  And I would encourage any listener to try it and see.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.960]  Fig tree, why does it taste like mint?
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.280]  Here's another interaction.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.880]  And that fig and the mint are totally different species.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.000]  One's a tree, one's a annual, or what do you call them?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.880]  Herb. So there's a crossover.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.960]  And again, you know, the only way we're really going to find this shit out is by doing it.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.960]  And whether you can do it side by side, I mean, that's the best way to prove it or suss it
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.880]  out. But it doesn't matter.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:57.720]  I mean, there's definitely proof enough in the pudding that these interactions are
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.400]  happening. And so try them, you know, go for it.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.160]  Because it can't hurt, especially if it's a similar.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.080]  It's definitely going to add something to it.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.040]  It has to. I mean, that's how nature works.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.600]  But anyway, I went on a rant.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.040]  Sorry, I was paying attention.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:22.400]  I brought up a couple of my notes here because I would love to dive even deeper to this
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:29.360]  concept. A big part of bringing those expressions out
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:38.400]  through adding inputs, through adding organic inputs, is the profile of polysaccharides
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  and polyphenols.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.880]  So we can go out, we can add fruit all day long and it's going to have a specific effect
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:52.160]  on diversity. But I want to mention the importance of all the different main polysaccharide
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.120]  groups. I'm trying to find it in my notes.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:02.400]  But off the top of my head, so we have cellulose from plants, we have beta glucans from
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.000]  mushrooms and there's five main ones.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.600]  Then there's polysaccharides created by microbes.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.040]  Chitin is another one.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.400]  So insects.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.440]  And starches and starches, I think if I'm not wrong, I couldn't find it in my notes, but
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:28.600]  those are some of the five main polysaccharide groups.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.520]  And so I feel like, oh, allergies, that was the cellulose and the starch I think is
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.360]  overlapping, allergies.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.680]  And I really try to implement all five of those main categories to set the
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:50.920]  platform for maximizing diversity, maximizing flavor expression.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:58.360]  And whether or not we're getting all of those, if all of that diversity is able to live in a
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.200]  particular climate, I'm not really sure.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:07.840]  But I really like finding a mushroom source, an insect source, an algae source.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.920]  I like using spirulina.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.000]  I like using kelp.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.480]  I guess kelp isn't an algae, but I like using spirulina, which also integrates some
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.080]  diatoms into your soil.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.560]  And the interactions between spirulina and diatom are super fascinating if anyone ever
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.760]  wants to dive down that hole.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:34.120]  But they feed each other and they both release oxygen.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:40.640]  They're like, I think diatoms are the largest oxygen emitting organism on the planet, like
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.640]  in the ocean, like more so than the forests.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.880]  And they get no credit. I love diatoms.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:52.320]  But there are these silica based organisms that like chain together and elongate and
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.520]  they're technically an algae.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.440]  But they're fricking rad.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.560]  And I love spirulina, too.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.320]  So get away from my food.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.640]  And so on.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.400]  So have you ever tried FishBrew Bold Flow?
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.920]  If you're good with a microscope, it's called FishBrew.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.560]  Go to FishBrew.com and order the product called Bold Flow.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.440]  It's the only product I've ever seen that has diatoms in it.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.400]  And I don't mean a couple.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.840]  I mean, boldly.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  Bold Flow?
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.240]  It's like hitting your whole screen.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.360]  You put one drop on the screen and all you'll see is diatoms.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.120]  So it's called Bold Flow, and it comes specifically from only one of the three fish
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.520]  farms. So if you want the concentrated diatoms, then get it.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.440]  And I love the fact you brought diatoms up.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.240]  I go off on diatoms because they are.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.480]  They're my favorite organism.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.440]  They're the funniest thing ever.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.080]  Right. They should be in a kingdom all themselves.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.240]  They're so unique.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.360]  They can generate food through two different things, photosynthesis or absorption of the
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.520]  nutrients in their aqueous environment.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960]  They are really, really special creature.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.240]  And yes, they're an oxygen pump.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.640]  I mean, you get them into your soils, you're producing more oxygen down in the soil,
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.760]  which is allowing for greater bacterial colonization, which is providing more nutrients
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.280]  for the nutrient cycling system.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.240]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.840]  No one talks about it.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.960]  No one talks about the importance of diatoms and no one talks about introducing diatoms
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.600]  into the soil, which is something that I love about adding spirulina.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.640]  Because if you take spirulina and you look under a microscope, there's a bunch of
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.680]  diatoms in there, too.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.480]  And so that's one of the one of the things and I'm kind of surprised I haven't touched
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.440]  on that before in any of my videos about spirulina.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:45.840]  But yeah, if you can have living spirulina, I'm just now getting into cultivating
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.360]  spirulina that's then emitting oxygen in your soil and you have living diatoms emitting
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:59.000]  oxygen in your soil, your soil is more aerobic and it's more, you know, it just keeps
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.280]  the roots healthier. It does like all these really cool things.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.600]  Yeah, I'm super into the idea.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.000]  Yeah, yeah. Definitely helps the roots.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.560]  It's crazy to think that, you know, the roots are consuming oxygen, the bacteria is
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:17.560]  consuming oxygen, and yet we don't talk about oxygen in the soil.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.080]  We'll talk about CO2 in the environment, in the air for the cannabis plant, but nobody
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:29.360]  gets into, well, how do we increase DO in the aquatic or soil matrix?
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:34.840]  And this is the only thing I've ever found that has, you know, that incredibly high
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.560]  level of diatoms.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.720]  So please, if you need it, I'll have them send you a bottle for free just so that you
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.680]  can microscope it.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.080]  Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.040]  Yeah. So I'll get your mailing address after we finish the show today and I'll get a
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.120]  bottle sent out to you because you're going to, it's going to pop your cork.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.240]  You're going to blow up.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.880]  That's great. I love it.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.720]  I'm all about it.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:56.920]  Yeah, I'm all about it.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:01.240]  And then at some point when I'm growing my own spirulina, I'll introduce these diatoms
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.560]  with the spirulina and let's see what happens.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:07.720]  With spirulina, I've always found it's just too exotic.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.280]  It's got too high of a salt content to grow it out.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.000]  Have you figured out a way to extract the salt after the fact so that you're not
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:14.240]  into-
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.200]  No, no, no.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.200]  I'm just not getting into it.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.480]  I'm like a complete noob.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.520]  Like I don't, I am the wrong person to ask about that kind of stuff.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.560]  So, but maybe I'll know.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.840]  Right. Deal.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.080]  So I've always preferred to use freshwater forms of algae.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.760]  So, you know, filamentous algae, everybody has it in their streams, rivers and creeks.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.360]  And I use that as a ferment.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.200]  So I take it, I'll put it in a bucket of water and let it sit there for five days,
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.200]  seven days, depending on temperature and exposure to sunlight until it gets that
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.480]  white foam on the top.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.360]  But if you microscope that white foam, boom, it's fucking crazy how much biology is
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.440]  in that. And then pour that shit right on top of your plants.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:02.360]  And again, you're getting the secondary tertiary metabolites along with the
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.360]  bioinoculation from all of the algae.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.720]  So from what I understand, so this is just like you're talking about like common pond
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720]  algae?
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:09.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.160]  Aren't you worried about them like suffocating the roots on?
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.520]  Well, no, because what I'm doing is I'm taking the algae and I'm fermenting it.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.040]  So I'm breaking it down.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.440]  But you can still get a lot of biology even during that breakdown process.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.840]  And then I apply it to the plant and I get incredible-
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.840]  Do you strain it?
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.440]  Actually, no, no.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.240]  And you know, another thing, another trick is pour it right on your compost pile
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:42.080]  because then all of that available nutrient is going to be consumed by the biology
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.400]  and therefore taking it out, not allowing it to be mobile.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.560]  So it's not going to travel through.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.800]  It's going to get consumed.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.040]  But that is a great trick.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.240]  Yeah. So I highly recommend you do that.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.600]  Now, where do you live?
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600]  Where is your farm?
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.120]  I'm in Oregon.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.760]  OK, so you've got plenty of clean water up there.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.640]  You've got plenty of clean lawns and rivers and streams.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.680]  So, yeah, try harvesting.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:10.960]  What I usually recommend is go to a place, a safe place where you know the water
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:15.440]  source is clean. Look for every different possible aquatic plant or algae.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:21.120]  Again, wild craft would love to try to bring something in and give what you take
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.720]  away. But yeah, pick as many different diverse types of aquatic plants and algae as
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.040]  you can find. Bring them home, put them in a bucket of water, put something on top to
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.880]  hold them underneath the surface because anything gets above the top will dry out and
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:34.880]  you lose the benefit.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.440]  But then let it sit till you get that foam.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.400]  Don't let it sit too long because that foam will crash.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.840]  But if you catch it when that foam is there, microscope it, it's going to pop your
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.640]  cork, man. You're going to be like, oh my God.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400]  Check it out. That's interesting.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:57.200]  I wonder if like immediately, because I've liked to play with using polysaccharide
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:02.400]  sources and the specific enzymes that break them down, like chitin and chitinase.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.360]  I wonder if we could find the enzyme that breaks down that algae to make it like
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.800]  just to make something different.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.480]  I think that could be a cool idea.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.240]  Yeah, make it more bioavailable.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.040]  I'm sure it shouldn't be that complicated.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:24.720]  Even if you just added a human acid or any kind of organic acid, I've got to believe
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.880]  it's going to break it down even further than water.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.080]  So some kind of protease or something.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.040]  For sure. There gives you everything you need to experiment all winter long.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.520]  So we'll reconnect its bridge.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.200]  Yeah, sounds good. We have a pond right down the street over here.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.920]  You could go over there and steal a couple of buckets.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.360]  There you go. Nice.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.680]  So you just briefly kind of mentioned, I feel like a game changer for people that are
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.560]  getting into higher end plants, regardless of what it is, is understanding chitin and
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.040]  chitinase and how those those things are changing, improving the immune system and all
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.840]  that. Can we dive deeper into that?
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.640]  Because I don't I definitely don't feel like there's enough people talking about that.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.080]  There's almost like a miracle to it to me when you're when you really start to play
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.920]  around with insect frass and just understanding that, again, diversity is there.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.120]  What's going on is on a deeper level is what I guess we would all love to learn more
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.840]  about. So what I understand.
[01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:40.590]  So plants know when they're being eaten by insects and it creates a stress response in
[01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:41.590]  the plant.
[01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:50.670]  There are enzymes in the mouths of the insects that will trigger chemical reactions in
[01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:56.830]  the plant that will then change the structure and expression of the plant and boost
[01:35:57.630 --> 01:35:59.150]  immune system responses.
[01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:09.790]  The polysaccharide, the fibrous polysaccharide chitin is a big part of what insects are
[01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:14.990]  made of. And also what they excrete.
[01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:21.270]  And so that compound comes in contact with the plant and the plant reacts to it.
[01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:22.990]  It is involved to react to it.
[01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:31.030]  And so when we take insect frass, something really high in chitin and we introduce it
[01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:35.790]  to our root zone and to our plant, to our soil, the plant.
[01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:42.070]  This is from what I understand, the plant recognizes those compounds, those
[01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:48.510]  polysaccharides, or that polysaccharide, and it changes the expression of the plant
[01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:54.230]  itself to be more robust, to be fuller as if it was being attacked by plants.
[01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:58.390]  So you're pretty much telling the plant like, hey, you're being attacked by insects.
[01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:02.630]  You should probably be really big and strong because if you don't, you're going to get
[01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:08.750]  eaten. And a similar thing happens when a plant actually gets physically eaten by like
[01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:14.150]  deer or something is it triggers a jasmonic acid response, which is a phytohormone,
[01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.870]  which then causes a boost in growth.
[01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:19.550]  And there's a lot of connection between jasmonic acid and terpene production.
[01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:26.230]  And there's debate between whether or not defoliation creates that same reaction and
[01:37:26.230 --> 01:37:27.550]  terpene expression in a plant.
[01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:29.910]  There's a lot of debate behind that.
[01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:31.430]  I don't want to get into that one.
[01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:36.230]  But so back to the insect frass and the chitin and stuff.
[01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:41.950]  So what I like to do is I always have insect frass in my top dresses.
[01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:47.790]  And whenever I'm reamending or at the end of a cycle or if I want to do some kind of
[01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:55.230]  balloon amending at some point for whatever reason, after I do a soil test, I love to
[01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:58.790]  add insect frass because it wants to get right in contact with the root zone.
[01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:01.230]  It wants to get right into the plant directly.
[01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:07.230]  So I'm always adding earthworm castings, insect frass, bucashi and whatever else I'm
[01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:11.150]  trying to introduce to make things just like really quickly, readily available and
[01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:13.550]  create a response in the plant really quickly.
[01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:17.590]  There is information out there.
[01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:27.430]  There is evidence to show that there's only so much energy that a plant can dedicate to
[01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:28.310]  processes.
[01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:35.590]  And so sometimes constantly triggering a plant defense response isn't what you want
[01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:42.110]  because they might not be focusing energy on like bud production, which is like what
[01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:43.550]  everyone's really big on.
[01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:51.710]  So I like to do that stuff early on in the soil and not add so much insect frass later
[01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:57.910]  on. That's just my that's my art form take on on
[01:38:57.910 --> 01:39:04.590]  cultivating. And I could be wrong, but from what I've read, there's only a particular
[01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:08.150]  amount of energy that a plant can dedicate to certain processes based on its size and
[01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:12.910]  its vigor. And so you don't want to tell it to be doing something when it needs to be
[01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:13.670]  doing something else.
[01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:17.910]  You're so on, you keep stressing that.
[01:39:19.670 --> 01:39:21.630]  Hold on a second, my phone is dying.
[01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:22.430]  Hold on. Sorry.
[01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:25.390]  Keep going, I'm listening.
[01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:26.310]  I just I just have to.
[01:39:26.590 --> 01:39:34.470]  So the energy currency that you're talking about is ADP and ADP controls all of the
[01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:42.710]  function plant functions, whether it's biological or defense response or plant leaf
[01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.510]  production, flower production.
[01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:47.750]  So you're absolutely right about that currency and it's very limited.
[01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:55.950]  So one of the things that you can do to prevent the waste of your energy currency is to
[01:39:55.950 --> 01:40:00.270]  prevent the plant from being nutrient deficient in anything.
[01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:05.630]  And when it is, you apply that nutrient fully so that it goes straight to the plant.
[01:40:05.630 --> 01:40:10.830]  It does not have to the plant does not have to send out exudates to grow the biology to
[01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:14.390]  break down the nutrients that it needs so that it can take it back up.
[01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:16.550]  We've eliminated all of that process.
[01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:22.510]  So that's why it's really important to feed fully in at the end of vegetation, before
[01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:29.110]  flower. And there's a gentleman here that I work with in SoCal who's a insectologist.
[01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:30.830]  So he runs an insectary.
[01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:37.710]  So he grows different insects to fight other insects, predatory specifically.
[01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:41.950]  And he's found over the years that what he knows that there's going to be an
[01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:48.070]  infestation. He will actually use the infested the bug that's going to be a problem.
[01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:54.870]  And he creates a ferment and then he fully applies that to the plants that he does not
[01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:56.310]  want to get affected by it.
[01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:59.270]  And he has incredible plant response like that.
[01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:02.070]  The plants just don't get attacked by this bug.
[01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:06.390]  So you're absolutely right about it, triggering that immune response and producing
[01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:09.590]  things that prevent that insect from from attacking it.
[01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:15.230]  Whether that's energy, whether that's metaphysical, whether that's an excretion of some
[01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.510]  kind of terpene or aroma that prevents the bug from attacking it.
[01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:24.510]  I don't know. But he swears by that trick of, you know, you know, you're going to have
[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:30.230]  high pest pressure, use that pest, ferment it and then apply it to the totally to the
[01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:35.110]  plant. Now, you can't do that in budding, but you can definitely do that in in in
[01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:36.070]  vegetative growth.
[01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:37.350]  That's a really cool idea.
[01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:41.710]  I could see how you could do that with like grasshoppers and like beetles.
[01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:42.950]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:47.910]  Imagine how I just imagine someone like taking like a like a razor blade and like
[01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:50.470]  collecting spider mites off the bottoms of their leaves.
[01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:55.630]  I'm like a threat.
[01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:58.110]  Yeah. Like how difficult that would be.
[01:41:58.110 --> 01:42:00.910]  But yeah, for like the larger pest, like that's a really cool idea.
[01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:05.470]  Yeah. And for the little tent grower, if he gets if he gets infestation in one of these
[01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.990]  things, just collect as many of them as you can.
[01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:11.630]  Squish him out a little water till you dilute it enough that you can put it in a sprayer
[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:14.190]  bottle and just try to get rid of it.
[01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:16.470]  They'll not get in your house.
[01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:21.110]  They'll definitely bail on the plant.
[01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:28.350]  That's awesome. So what do you guys think about going out to the greenhouse?
[01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:30.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it for sure.
[01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:31.710]  We're not 45 in.
[01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:35.750]  So it's perfect timing and definitely want to spend some time out there in the
[01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:37.310]  greenhouse. So sweet.
[01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:42.270]  So I if it's if it's cool, because for some reason my phone is dying, even though it's
[01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:45.070]  plugged in, I guess this app is taking a lot of power.
[01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:48.710]  I warned you. Strips strips energy out of your phone.
[01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:52.990]  Yeah. So I don't know what I'm going to do if I keep this going.
[01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:59.670]  It's going to die. But I have my tablet so I can connect to my router out there with
[01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:01.990]  my tablet. Is it cool if I take a break?
[01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:05.550]  Yeah, I'm going to go to the restroom real quick and then I'm going to go out there
[01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:07.990]  and I'm going to jump on my tablet and then I can jump back on the show.
[01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:09.590]  That's cool. Yeah. Perfect.
[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.470]  Sweet. Sounds good to me.
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:13.270]  Awesome. I'm excited.
[01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:16.070]  I'll be back in a few minutes.
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:23.740]  So, Leighton, I think to dive in deeper with you while we're waiting on that with the
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  chitin to the chitinase, especially when you're newer to this, you know, for me, it
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:34.260]  was the easiest way to start to understand how plants really work, like in a symbiotic
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.540]  relationship with nature.
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:42.460]  And you can see that the plant over just a few weeks, it really starts to grow in with
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:45.580]  with, you know, how they used to call my popcorn mussels.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.820]  But this is growing actually with vigor.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:50.420]  So it's not like you're using PGRs or something like that.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:56.460]  It's just it seems like you're using the insect frass as the as the natural compound
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:00.420]  for these plants to be able to build such a stronger structure.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:04.620]  Do you think that that's almost paramount these days, especially when you're getting
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.180]  more into like a larger grow?
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:09.900]  Maybe you're going from a tent to a basement or now you're you know, you got your
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.540]  skill set where you can handle a basement.
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.140]  But now you're in a commercial grow.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:20.260]  You kind of need some kind of insurance policy, if you will, by adding frass, at least
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.860]  in my opinion. You know, insect frass has traditionally been used in cannabis
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.340]  cultivation for years.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:31.500]  The only problem with it is, is it's where do you get the source?
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.420]  It's very expensive.
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.380]  The insectaries don't want to deal with it.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.900]  It's too much of a pain in the ass.
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.620]  So they usually just dump it.
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:46.340]  And so there have been entrepreneurs out there that have gone to these insectaries and
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:50.300]  so-called clean their garbage cans to get these, you know, these different frasses.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:55.820]  But again, it's just it's an expensive and a labor intensive process.
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:58.260]  But no, I agree with you 100 percent.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:01.460]  These kinds of things are it's like silica.
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.860]  Silica is one of the few things that are one of the few elements we don't talk a lot
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:14.060]  about. And it's so important in really supporting stronger plant cells so that the
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:15.420]  wind is less effective.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.100]  The plant can grow taller without snapping.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:24.580]  Just the legs making the branches themselves stronger so that they can hold more weight.
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:31.580]  So, you know, again, these these kinds of secondary and tertiary metabolites are really
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.580]  important. And I love what she did.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:39.060]  I mean, if you go to her Instagram, she talks about blending up her top dress, which
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:42.860]  she doesn't she doesn't like to put a lot on, but she understands the value and
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:48.220]  importance of it. And it's it's it's again, she's supporting the plant as the plant is
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:55.340]  maturing and giving the plant the ability to pull what it wants and not not feeding it,
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.380]  not force feeding it.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:01.260]  So, you know, again, she's light years ahead of a lot of a lot of growers in the
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:06.620]  essence that, you know, not only did she get into these metabolic processes,
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:15.620]  microscopy, you know, understanding how to set up a soil for success and then getting
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:20.420]  the microbes in there and then letting that interaction between the soil, the plant and
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:25.460]  the microbes to produce what what is the plant actually wants to uptake at that one
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:29.540]  time. So again, and, you know, kudos to her.
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:35.380]  And again, you know, perhaps she's going a lot by gut instinct, but I know so many
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:39.420]  really, really good growers that, you know, are totally fly by.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:43.100]  They're just totally like my the plant's telling me it needs this.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:43.820]  I'm going to give it to it.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:51.220]  And so I don't think that it's ideal for the newer grower to try to touch that inner
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:56.660]  self yet. Like you got to have a bunch of positive flips first and document what you
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:02.700]  did so that you can repeat the same processes or add a little one new element to the
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:08.060]  next one to see if that made a difference or changed the plant reaction.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:14.460]  But no, I think that, you know, and this is NF, it's natural farming or Korean natural
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.980]  farming, whatever you want to call it, is using these ferments to break down these
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:25.780]  compounds into a more bioavailable form so that the plant can uptake it or the bacteria
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:30.380]  biology can uptake it quicker to give the plant a quicker uptake or reaction.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.940]  And again, these ferments are saving ADP.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.460]  They're saving energy currency.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:42.540]  So instead of using that photosynthesis energy to create exudates to mine sand, clay,
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:44.540]  they've saved all that energy.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:50.220]  And therefore that's going to allow the plant to to grow bigger, to produce either more
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.340]  branches or more flowers, whatever.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:48:00.740]  So again, using nature to help support the plant's energy reserves.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:03.340]  That's why NF works.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.900]  That's why natural farming works, man.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.140]  It's because you're doing the same thing.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.100]  You're cutting out the middleman.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.860]  And like so for our audience, like when we're moving more towards the progression,
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:19.300]  towards old growth forest, like when the plants first growing, right, let's say these are
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:24.820]  just examples say she's giving 90 percent to her vigor, her growth in veg and about
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:31.100]  10 percent to the exudates, to the roots, that kind of stuff from the microbial side of
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:36.260]  things. On the flip side of that, when we get deeper, when the the forest is a lot older,
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:42.020]  from my research, it seems like a lot of people are talking about that that begins to
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:47.340]  flip where the whole system realizes that it's the root structure, it's the microbial
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.580]  life that that matters.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:53.780]  Once everybody's kind of alive and healthy and it switches that energy more into the
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.100]  root structure itself.
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:56.980]  Do you co-sign that?
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.300]  And do you think that that's kind of where we as a group need to start to focus as once
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:06.820]  everything's alive and healthy, the system itself is refocusing back on the root system?
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:12.020]  Well, I think you touched on a couple of different things that are important to
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:14.500]  understand. That.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:22.980]  When you get into soil succession, you're talking about biology, specifically fungi,
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.460]  and kudos to Elaine.
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:26.500]  I love her to death.
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:33.740]  And she had to create a ruler, a type of measurement, a way to gauge from early
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.860]  succession to late succession plants.
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:42.900]  So she chose or realized that when she was doing her microscope work, that when she took
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.980]  soil from the redwoods, there was just tons of saprophytic fungi.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:55.460]  And when she took a similar sample from a healthy, say, vegetable garden, she was much
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:02.420]  lower. So it was like a one to one fungi to bacteria in the vegetable garden and
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:09.020]  thousands, like tens of thousands to one in the fungally dominant old growth forest.
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:16.860]  So soil succession shouldn't be confused with inner biological or plant responses.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:23.900]  So, you know, throwing a heavy fungal tea at a plant as it's getting flipped into flower
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:26.340]  probably isn't going to do much for you.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:34.620]  But saving energy so that the plant can use that energy up in other ways that will benefit
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:36.580]  you, that is spot on.
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.180]  That is definitely spot on.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:41.940]  So, again, trying to clarify your question.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:45.380]  So maybe you can reword it now that we've cleaned that slate.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:54.140]  Well, you know, a lot of people were kind of getting at the, you know, maybe adding the
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:56.780]  insect frass, maybe adding a little bit of calcium.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]  Hello, Luna.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.280]  I'll shelf that for later, buddy.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:06.920]  OK.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.480]  All right, can you turn your camera sideways?
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200]  Your phone.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.880]  Oh, let's see if you get landscape.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.600]  There you go.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:17.640]  Bam.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.360]  And then try to flip the camera.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.880]  She popped off.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240]  Yeah, we lost her.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.240]  She probably accidentally hung up when she was trying to flip the camera around.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.720]  I'm sure she'll be back on in a minute.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.680]  So, yeah, she's with Starlink.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.240]  So it might take a second.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.450]  That's not it. How do I put the camera on?
[01:51:48.810 --> 01:51:49.810]  You're good.
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:59.140]  You can you could just hold the camera around physically.
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.140]  If you can't find it.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.380]  Yeah, it would be your settings.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:09.140]  And it'd be face forward.
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.580]  There's a few different settings in the camera option.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.900]  If you get into your settings file.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:21.740]  We've lost your voice as well.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:28.890]  You might just have to turn it around, Luna, and face the camera.
[01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:29.890]  The opposite direction.
[01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:33.890]  All right, she's jumping back off again.
[01:52:35.490 --> 01:52:36.490]  All right.
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:41.680]  Well, what else?
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:47.440]  Hey, what did you think about the Rai aspect to what she was talking about?
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.320]  I haven't really heard people talking about that.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:55.080]  Well, Rai is a wonderful resource for my rising.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:59.320]  So it's a it's a very
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.680]  prolific plant.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:07.960]  It produces both a lot of green biomass as well as provides flowers.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:12.560]  I'm a huge fan of using flowers, especially in composting.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:17.240]  For whatever reason, there's just something that happens when I take a lot of
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.200]  flower, not flowers from the flower store.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.800]  I'm not talking about synthetic flowers or petals.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.720]  I'm talking about natural wildflowers or or wildflowers.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.240]  Or like my garden here, I grew all a lot of my inputs in the garden from my
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.520]  compost making. And the biggest thing was all these wildflowers.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:44.080]  And so for whatever reason, that type of plant would be super beneficial as a
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:50.320]  plant to encourage local indigenous organisms, specifically butterflies,
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:55.480]  birds. Remember, you're you're by putting a plant that's that prolific in your
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.680]  garden or area.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.240]  You bring in insects which are bringing feeder insects, which are bringing in
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.360]  bigger, more macro orthopods.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:08.360]  And then you're getting birds and those birds are eating those insects.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.680]  And guess what they're doing?
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.920]  Providing you macronutrients in the form of bird poop.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:20.640]  So anytime you can encourage an abundant natural ecosystem, you're only you're
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:25.520]  only adding to the benefit of your soil or your surrounding or whatever you're
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:29.080]  trying to grow. And again, it doesn't matter what you grow, whether it's a lemon
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.320]  tree, an avocado tree or cannabis plant or a vegetable garden.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.520]  You know, you know, working with nature is is way more advantageous than than
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.920]  fighting. Luna, we don't have any image from you, young lady.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:48.390]  Can you hear us? Luna?
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.480]  Can you text her, Brian?
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:57.120]  Yeah.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.580]  Hopefully she's not being what you're hearing.
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:07.820]  And what would Thursday be without technical difficulties?
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.420]  It just wouldn't be the same.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.540]  Well, that's for sure. Right.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:22.060]  I'm sure we'll get it figured out in the end, guys, she'll just have to jump back
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:27.260]  off and try to just spin her camera around and point it the other direction.
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:31.140]  As long as she can hear us, you know, we're all golden, right?
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.860]  Well, as long as we can hear her.
[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:37.940]  Yes, and see the image.
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:46.900]  Yeah, right. Well, you know, that's and I would imagine most people realize that, you
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:54.300]  know, when people are growing out in the in the sticks, there's not really too much
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:55.500]  technology that works.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.900]  So she was even prepping me beforehand late and that she uses Starlink.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:04.220]  And I remember that Wendy used that and she was looking pretty crystal clear when she
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:07.140]  was out taking care of her farm that day.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.660]  Yeah, that was that was amazing.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.740]  I've been in that area of Humboldt.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:12.900]  You got no signal.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:17.620]  I mean, there's only like little sections of the highway where you can pull over and
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:23.660]  talk. But if you get up in the Humboldt proper, no, you go back down the road halfway
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:26.180]  between there and you got service.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:28.700]  But it's definitely super spotty up there.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:35.340]  So that was a big, big improvement that Starlink up in that mountain range.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:40.740]  I again, I don't know where Luna said she's in Oregon, but, you know, there's pretty
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:45.700]  pretty sparse area up there or pretty, what do I call it, wilderness, a lot of
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:48.620]  wilderness up there. So not surprised.
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:53.620]  Yes. Yeah. A lot of fantastic cannabis farmers that would never want the spotlight in
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:56.140]  any way live up live up in Oregon.
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:59.100]  So, yeah, it's pretty.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:00.300]  Do you want privacy?
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.700]  Right. No names.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:04.340]  We call it off the land.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.460]  A lot of these guys truly live off the land.
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:08.900]  Yeah. We call it the rifle test.
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:14.140]  So if I can fire a rifle in any one direction without hitting a neighbor, I like it.
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.540]  Two thumbs up for that.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:21.380]  Yeah. It doesn't work well here in SoCal.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:25.980]  I can't I couldn't shoot a fucking BB gun without hitting every house around me.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:34.740]  Or for me, to be honest, watching people with like gut and clean animals and stuff, I
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:37.540]  don't think I could do that on like a weekly basis.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.220]  Well, if you're going to eat it, you get into a different mindset, right?
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:48.260]  Really do. You begin to worship it and thank it for its life and that it's blessing you
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:50.060]  with its meat. So it's a little bit.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:52.500]  There we go. OK, cool.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.620]  I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the front camera around.
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:04.460]  See if you can see if you lay it sideways, if it goes back to landscape.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:11.420]  There you go. OK, now just flip the phone around so you don't have to flip the camera.
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:16.860]  OK, it's going to be difficult for me to show you like specific things.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:25.180]  But this is my what doesn't mirror my camera, Ken, at the bottom where it says camera
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:29.180]  resolution and beautiful, all those happy plants, man.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.580]  How many square feet is that?
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:36.180]  So the greenhouse itself is forty eight hundred square feet.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:41.300]  And then so it's like a like an auto tap inside of a greenhouse.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.740]  We have like these and like fans and stuff.
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:48.780]  So you're using stuff in the winter?
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:50.540]  Yeah, because it's wintertime, you know.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:55.580]  So you can see like the under canopy is a little bit more yellow than up top.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:59:01.860]  Just because. This is like one of two days that we've been able to open the depth
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.700]  because it's been, you know, like below freezing up here.
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:09.820]  But this is my soil.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.220]  Soil porn.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:18.020]  Oh, yeah. This is what everybody loves to see because you can't fake this.
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:19.380]  I mean, this takes so long.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:21.500]  Where's the worms? Where's the worms?
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:26.180]  Where are they? I don't know, you know, so I can't like focus because I can't see the
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:33.000]  screen. And you froze.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.920]  I don't know what you're seeing, or if you can see all the micro arthropods.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.000]  Oh, my God. And it's great.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.000]  I to hold the camera steady for just a minute.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.720]  One spot. There you go.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.520]  Oh, my God. My cat is in my bed now.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.720]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.320]  It's not you're digging in the bed, mom.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.360]  Why can't I?
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.800]  Yeah, she's like, I want to dig in the bed.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:02.640]  Now that's going to be some badass cat piss weed.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.080]  Check this out. Check it out.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.720]  Check it out. Oh, don't run. Oh, I don't want to hurt you.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.080]  Oh, so there's some top feeder roots.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.720]  You see this nice little red wiggler here?
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.800]  Yep. Yeah.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:16.800]  So here's some feeder roots really nice and white and happy.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.920]  And we got a nice red wiggler.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:21.480]  Move your image just a little left.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.280]  Just a hair. There you go.
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.280]  Perfect. Centered.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:25.480]  Look at that.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:28.200]  Where are the roots?
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:32.000]  And you can see I have this different kind of wood chip.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:36.000]  And there's the I don't know if you can see it, but there's biology, some nice
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.680]  fungal bodies growing on the wood chips and stuff.
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:40.960]  And you have little white dots.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:44.520]  Are those are those little insect eggs right next to the feeder root?
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.120]  This right here.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.320]  No, not what you're.
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.960]  Yeah. Yeah. Those.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.680]  Yeah. That's right here. Yeah.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:58.440]  That's. Oh, OK.
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.840]  Yep. I got cinder.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.160]  There's a lot of cinder up here in Oregon.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:07.280]  And then all these worms, this poor little worm, I feel bad.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:08.320]  I'm going to cover back up.
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:09.840]  Oh, come on.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.320]  You're worse than me.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.480]  So you built the you built the beds with with cedar.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.440]  Cinder, cinder, cinder, cinder.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.760]  I meant to say cinder.
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.200]  No, cinder. She added in preparation.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.880]  It's like it's lava rock, right?
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.920]  Yeah. So these are my beautiful babies.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:36.680]  Very well done.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.840]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.000]  So I like to just to fully this just for sake of showing you guys what's going on.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.000]  Real quick.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.880]  So you have two skins.
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.240]  I do like to drop and drop.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.960]  Yeah, so I do.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:57.800]  So this auto-depth here closes
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.000]  and then there's another membrane up high.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.400]  So like it'll get below 30 and I can keep it like 75 degrees in here.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.160]  And I don't have the light penetration that I want all the time,
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.760]  just because when it gets really cold or like, you know, snow will accumulate
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.320]  on the greenhouse and I have to have the the DEs going on.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:20.240]  So like, you know, up top, everything is nice and healthy.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.560]  The bed has recently opened, actually, because it was.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.120]  It's close, I don't have the best rigidity right now, unfortunately, but
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.200]  pretty early flower.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:36.040]  Let's see that we're starting to get like this development and stuff
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.000]  that is looking really good.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.600]  So half is all a lot of forty one.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.640]  And then I'll show you some different genetics down there at the other side.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.240]  But I wanted to show you real quick how I like to train them.
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.960]  I need to I need to lollipop these.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.560]  Don't don't judge me.
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.680]  I'm going to do it here soon.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:58.640]  So I like to I like to do a singular top.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:02.160]  Again, I don't know if you can see what I'm trying to show you,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.920]  but you see here, this is where the original singular top was.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:10.480]  And then it kind of forced everything to, you know, kind of catch up on the outside.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.840]  And then I like to train them out like really aggressively at first.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.920]  So I do one top and then I train and then I just let them go up.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:22.280]  Right. All right.
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.120]  By training, by training, what do you mean for the audience?
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.640]  Like blending or blending, bending like.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:33.600]  Like bending the plants outward.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:34.080]  Watch out.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.840]  Yeah. So LST, low stress training.
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's low stress training.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.680]  Yes. Thank you very much.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:46.640]  So I'll like take this limb and I brought it way out here.
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.560]  Right. And then these other auxiliary limbs, these side limbs and stuff,
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:53.480]  they they then catch up and come up and I get a really nice,
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:57.800]  dense canopy with a lot of, you know, like branching and stuff
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.320]  from a low plant count.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.760]  Yeah. So you're getting more pod sites.
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.560]  There's my kitties all around.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.080]  Little wheeling chair thing here.
[02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:16.290]  So this is my genetic, this is my blood moon.
[02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:17.650]  I really love her.
[02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:22.730]  She has this really cool kind of like purpling vein,
[02:04:22.810 --> 02:04:25.250]  like purpling vascular system thing going on here.
[02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:30.370]  And sometimes, you know, purpling can be like a nutrient absorption problem.
[02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:32.770]  But this is just a characteristic of the genetic.
[02:04:34.890 --> 02:04:38.890]  As you can tell the how green it is, also, this isn't like a.
[02:04:39.650 --> 02:04:41.770]  Yeah, that's not an uptake issue.
[02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:46.050]  No. And then this is a Hawaiian queen that we got going on.
[02:04:47.210 --> 02:04:48.490]  It looks like the humidity is a little low.
[02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:49.770]  We are in the desert here.
[02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:53.250]  So getting the humidity and BPD is pretty difficult,
[02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:54.810]  especially in the wintertime.
[02:04:55.090 --> 02:04:56.770]  She's got these monster stems on her.
[02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:59.970]  So you're out west or out east?
[02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:02.290]  I'm in central Oregon.
[02:05:03.010 --> 02:05:05.410]  OK. Yeah. So I'm like a high desert.
[02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:08.770]  This is another I don't know if we're going to grow this one again,
[02:05:08.770 --> 02:05:10.170]  but this is another Hawaiian genetic.
[02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:12.330]  It's kind of getting all funky. There's only one of these plants.
[02:05:13.730 --> 02:05:15.450]  This is a cool one.
[02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:17.450]  This was called Purple Octopus.
[02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:20.730]  It's also got that kind of like purple stemming characteristics, very magenta.
[02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:26.970]  Are you doing all your own breeding or are you working with any other seed company?
[02:05:27.130 --> 02:05:29.490]  So I'm I am working with someone.
[02:05:29.530 --> 02:05:33.890]  I would have to talk to him about whether or not he wants me to announce
[02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:35.410]  that I'm working with him or not.
[02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:38.050]  But yeah, I am working with another person.
[02:05:38.770 --> 02:05:42.170]  These over here are his and this one is mine.
[02:05:42.490 --> 02:05:43.530]  This is the Blood Moon.
[02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:47.330]  It's a phenotype that I selected.
[02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:52.450]  We have some OG's over here or this is the OG.
[02:05:52.890 --> 02:05:56.410]  These two are kind of these smaller little like stubby plants going on.
[02:05:56.410 --> 02:05:58.370]  I don't know if we're going to keep that going.
[02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:01.850]  And this is a grapefruit kush plant over here in the background
[02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:04.930]  or like some full terms that have been cut and not been paying attention to.
[02:06:05.210 --> 02:06:07.570]  So don't don't judge me by the state of those either.
[02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:13.490]  Yeah, so this is this is my bed.
[02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:17.170]  It's. It's 18 inches deep.
[02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:20.290]  Which is a little bit deeper than most people usually go.
[02:06:22.290 --> 02:06:27.330]  But I feel like having a potential anaerobic layer is a good idea.
[02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:29.370]  You know, kind of mimics
[02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:32.490]  nature a little bit more.
[02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:34.770]  But I definitely have like a lot of.
[02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:38.730]  Or these are these high full knots or high full pins.
[02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:40.850]  Oh, look at that.
[02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:43.890]  I got some some some mycelium going on here.
[02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:47.010]  I might get some fruiting bodies here soon.
[02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:49.170]  That's cool. Nice. Yeah.
[02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:53.570]  But there's a whole bunch of different micro arthropods.
[02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:57.770]  I introduced you know, strata, lay laps and rogue beetles and
[02:06:59.810 --> 02:07:01.770]  lacewing larvae.
[02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:06.010]  But yeah, so trying to have as much
[02:07:07.610 --> 02:07:10.770]  as much biology as possible, keep the soil food web intact as much as possible.
[02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:13.730]  And I just chop and drop whenever I loli or whatever I clean up the bottoms.
[02:07:14.170 --> 02:07:16.290]  I just take the leaves and drop them right on the bed.
[02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:21.130]  And it kind of just helps, you know, with the mulch layer and the biology and stuff.
[02:07:21.130 --> 02:07:23.970]  And so I'm going to be doing companion planning
[02:07:25.050 --> 02:07:27.530]  come spring, and I'm going to introduce a leasum.
[02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:30.410]  I want a whole bunch of the leasum flowers in here.
[02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:32.090]  I think that would be really pretty.
[02:07:32.090 --> 02:07:36.730]  And then bring that floral note and aroma to the to the garden.
[02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:39.650]  And that's a creeper plant, isn't it?
[02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:41.850]  Isn't that a low, low crawler?
[02:07:41.850 --> 02:07:43.210]  Yeah, it is.
[02:07:43.210 --> 02:07:45.690]  So it stays small, right?
[02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:48.410]  It doesn't get very tall.
[02:07:50.290 --> 02:07:53.090]  Yeah, because I don't want to grow up into the.
[02:07:53.090 --> 02:07:54.650]  You had mentioned something I wanted to highlight.
[02:07:54.650 --> 02:07:57.930]  You had said that you chose to use the the
[02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:03.410]  great green lacewing larvae where most people choose to buy the adults.
[02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:07.850]  And myself and I would imagine others have found that the reason why you're going
[02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:10.370]  after the larvae is because they're the ones that are actually effective,
[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:12.650]  kind of like when you find out about ladybugs.
[02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:13.770]  Do you feel that way?
[02:08:13.770 --> 02:08:16.490]  Yeah, they're more they're more voracious, right?
[02:08:17.010 --> 02:08:19.610]  And like they'll turn into the regular ones, too.
[02:08:22.610 --> 02:08:26.330]  But from like an ROI perspective,
[02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:29.210]  it's usually better to get the larvae than the adults.
[02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:33.210]  Yeah, I am not an entomologist.
[02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:38.330]  I have a friend that's an entomologist, and she has pretty much taught me that
[02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:42.170]  that if I don't know what I'm talking about, I should just shut the fuck up
[02:08:42.170 --> 02:08:43.970]  when it comes to that.
[02:08:45.930 --> 02:08:48.730]  And that's a shout out to Suzanne Wainwright.
[02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:51.250]  She's the queen in the industry.
[02:08:52.610 --> 02:08:54.490]  Yeah, Suzanne's a G.
[02:08:54.490 --> 02:08:58.650]  But I'm just going to I'm just going to shut up about that one,
[02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:00.090]  because because honestly, like
[02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:05.250]  from what she's told me, like specific species of predators
[02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:08.570]  need to be introduced to control specific species of pests.
[02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:10.650]  And so like.
[02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:16.930]  Very specific parasitoids are going to attack very specific aphids,
[02:09:17.170 --> 02:09:20.690]  and there's multiple species of cannabis aphids, there's, you know,
[02:09:20.690 --> 02:09:25.010]  even just like leaf dwelling cannabis aphids and there's multiple species of thrips.
[02:09:26.210 --> 02:09:30.090]  And like I tried to send her like a microscope image of a thrip one time
[02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:33.090]  and she's like, no, I need to get the I need to see where the wings are
[02:09:33.090 --> 02:09:37.690]  connecting to the to the thorax and I need to see which way the antennas are working.
[02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:39.290]  And I'm like trying to give her this image.
[02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:40.250]  She's like, no, it's not good enough.
[02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:41.970]  You have to mail me the thrip.
[02:09:41.970 --> 02:09:44.130]  I'm like, oh, my God.
[02:09:44.130 --> 02:09:45.850]  So it's like very specific
[02:09:47.170 --> 02:09:48.490]  when it comes to entomology.
[02:09:48.490 --> 02:09:50.970]  So I'm just going to say that I don't know.
[02:09:51.090 --> 02:09:53.730]  And ask an entomologist.
[02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:57.250]  Well, you know, another thing, too, is that you're getting the added benefit
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:10:03.690]  of the soil or soil stage of life before it goes into lacing.
[02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:09.530]  So, again, it's you're getting multiple uses out of that particular purchase.
[02:10:10.810 --> 02:10:12.890]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:15.490]  But if you want to use predatory insects,
[02:10:16.290 --> 02:10:20.610]  ask ask your local entomologist or Suzanne Wainwright.
[02:10:21.170 --> 02:10:23.130]  She's the one to talk about it.
[02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:27.130]  OK, is there anything else I should show you in here before I get out of here?
[02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:29.530]  Maybe I'll show you my my conical brewer real quick.
[02:10:30.370 --> 02:10:31.690]  I'll show you how I make my teas.
[02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:35.610]  I know when I saw your cone bottom brewer, I'm like, yeah, you go.
[02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:39.530]  Because I guess flat bottom, flat bottom brewers,
[02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:42.330]  they're missing so much of the of the
[02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:46.290]  facts that is caused in that cone bottom.
[02:10:48.610 --> 02:10:50.530]  She's on the ground right now
[02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:52.890]  because I was cleaning her out and it's still kind of a mess in here.
[02:10:52.930 --> 02:10:54.770]  Oh, my God. But this is her.
[02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:56.130]  These 100 gallons.
[02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:58.490]  And I just it's kind of modified it.
[02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:00.730]  So there's a valve here.
[02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:04.690]  And my pump, my pump is right here.
[02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:07.610]  And then our radiant floor heater.
[02:11:08.490 --> 02:11:11.290]  So I just connect the pump to the to the base of the conical brewer.
[02:11:12.690 --> 02:11:14.970]  Oh, I can do this one hand.
[02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:16.450]  Oh, yeah. OK.
[02:11:16.450 --> 02:11:17.730]  Just connect it like that.
[02:11:17.730 --> 02:11:22.370]  And so the whole principle here is that all the organic inputs that you add,
[02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:27.210]  they come to the bottom to a point and then they're agitated down here.
[02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:30.010]  And so that there's no anaerobic pockets,
[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:33.890]  there's no sediment because sediment can create a lot of problems
[02:11:34.730 --> 02:11:38.330]  when doing like aerobic fermentation.
[02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:40.410]  And so, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:45.330]  I mean, it's it's that's all for showing you guys what I got going on here.
[02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:53.130]  Do you do you when you when you're brewing, do you put a what we call a backflow,
[02:11:53.690 --> 02:11:55.410]  a loop in your hose?
[02:11:55.410 --> 02:11:59.930]  So this is something that I talk to people when they call me about brewing.
[02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:04.850]  Is to make sure that the hose is higher than the level of the water
[02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:09.210]  before it goes back down to the pump so you prevent if the pump fails,
[02:12:09.210 --> 02:12:11.650]  it doesn't get flooded with the water coming out of the pump.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.600]  I should have that.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.000]  I should do that. I don't. But I should.
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:21.000]  Well, you can't.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.240]  And that's important.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:24.320]  Thank you for pointing that out to me, because, yeah, I don't want to.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.600]  I mean, I guess if the pump breaks and the pump's broken,
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.240]  but it definitely would break more.
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.480]  Yeah. You're fucked.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.760]  And I had that on that road.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.400]  There was a rolling blackout and I blew up my pump because I didn't have the loop.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:42.160]  So that's a good idea.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.720]  I will. I will definitely look into that.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.160]  All right. I'm going back into the house.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:49.520]  I'm like, your dog's working out.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:52.320]  Well, thank you so much for bringing us out there.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.720]  That was a gorgeous greenhouse.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:56.200]  Hey, thanks so much.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:59.160]  And so you're managing that yourself or do
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.560]  you know the whole it's all it is all me is all me.
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:09.760]  So that's that's quite a friggin greenhouse to manage by yourself.
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:12.880]  So I know, but it shows what's possible.
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.840]  You know, like obviously you don't start out that way,
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.440]  but it shows like once you get that skill set that, you know,
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:21.200]  you can achieve that kind of stuff.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.200]  And Leighton and I've been fortunate enough to interview
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.400]  a variety of different farmers like that.
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:30.360]  And, you know, there's very few of them even even now that that can do it
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.120]  without even just a few people on their team and everything.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.560]  So you are a true hustler.
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:39.760]  And it goes to show, you know, that the living soil systems
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:44.960]  prevent excess labor wasted on other things like chasing nutrient deficiencies,
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.880]  chasing pests.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.120]  So, you know, again, it's just it makes things easier.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.720]  Like I would imagine you're scouting a lot more as the years have gone by, Luna,
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:58.520]  where you don't have to just focus all the time on the soil system.
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:13:59.560]  You know, you're managing it.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.640]  But at the same time, you're consciously probably focused on more of like
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.600]  scouting IPM, protecting the plant instead of just growing the plant.
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:11.080]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.280]  I have to keep an eye out for thrips and aphids out here.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.600]  As we are surrounded by like hemp farms and stuff, too.
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:24.600]  So you get a lot of external pressure.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.640]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:30.440]  And it can be it can be a pain in the ass, but, you know,
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.200]  IPM is just definitely one of those things that you have to stay on top of.
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:36.400]  Oh, yeah, especially in a greenhouse.
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.520]  Catch it early on. It's not a problem.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.240]  But if you miss it, man, I can get out of control so fast.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.080]  Yeah. Yeah, I totally hear that.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.440]  It's not not not good.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.360]  Are there some some breeders that you don't mind
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.720]  shouting out that you've used their work?
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:58.640]  You know, a lot of people start to kind of think about what genetics
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.680]  they're going to buy in 2023.
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.880]  I love to ask these questions at the end of the year.
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:08.320]  So, I mean, there's like the big hype ones and they probably don't need my shout out.
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.520]  But, you know, I love Tony Lava.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:15.960]  He's awesome at Boneyard and.
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:21.040]  Missing link genetics, I've worked with their stuff.
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.120]  I love their stuff.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.360]  They're awesome, too.
[02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:37.670]  Yeah.
[02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:43.030]  I think those two are the ones that I want to I want to give highlight to the most.
[02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:46.470]  You know, they're they're still, you know, they're they're super passionate
[02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:49.990]  about what they do and they're still, you know, like coming up.
[02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:52.710]  And I have a lot of respect for Tony Lava.
[02:15:53.110 --> 02:15:58.310]  And yeah, I definitely love to support him and missing link genetics.
[02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:59.230]  They've they've helped me out.
[02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:01.710]  They've just hooked me up with genetics and I grew them out
[02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:03.830]  and they were monsters and they're beautiful.
[02:16:04.710 --> 02:16:05.670]  And they worked with
[02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:09.190]  Clackamas Coots, the one.
[02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:10.230]  And I grew that out.
[02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:12.150]  Their Empress Cross was legit.
[02:16:12.150 --> 02:16:13.350]  I was super into it.
[02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:17.390]  Then they they work with the Fooberry Cross,
[02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:20.350]  which is something bred by I believe it's like a
[02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:24.910]  professor up at Washington State, something he was working on for like a decade
[02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:26.910]  that they've been that they've been playing with.
[02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:29.230]  And it just creates this awesome expression.
[02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:32.750]  And you can see that in my my big plans, too.
[02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:37.790]  I have some like really magenta looking plants that are their work on my profile.
[02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:42.710]  The Fuma Goo and the Fireberry and.
[02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:48.130]  The Empress.
[02:16:48.890 --> 02:16:51.050]  I forget I forget there's a couple more.
[02:16:53.930 --> 02:16:56.450]  Yeah, yeah, well, I would say, you know,
[02:16:57.410 --> 02:17:00.850]  Mr. Toad is definitely a friend of the show and, you know,
[02:17:00.850 --> 02:17:02.810]  somebody that definitely should be supported.
[02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:05.770]  So I love when we can give that to the audience.
[02:17:05.930 --> 02:17:09.970]  You know, you're genuinely just talking about people that provide quality genetics.
[02:17:10.330 --> 02:17:13.290]  And sometimes the hype isn't there because they're actually behind the scenes
[02:17:13.290 --> 02:17:14.330]  doing the work.
[02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:16.970]  They're not on their social media getting all the hype.
[02:17:16.970 --> 02:17:21.410]  So when you first get into it, you think, oh, man, if they got all these followers,
[02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:23.050]  they must be legit.
[02:17:23.050 --> 02:17:24.530]  Sometimes that's true.
[02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:25.730]  But a lot of times it's not.
[02:17:27.450 --> 02:17:32.250]  Now, guys like Toad have been doing the work for a long, long fucking time.
[02:17:32.250 --> 02:17:36.410]  And yeah, by doing the work, I mean not only breeding,
[02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:41.570]  but supporting people after they've after they've tried to grow it
[02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:47.050]  or helped build their growth, you know, convince or consult them
[02:17:47.050 --> 02:17:50.850]  in ways that are far beyond what normal breeders do.
[02:17:50.850 --> 02:17:53.650]  So, you know, much love to Toad for all the work he's done
[02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:55.650]  and the support for the community that he provides.
[02:17:56.450 --> 02:18:00.090]  He's definitely not he's not getting the money that he deserves.
[02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:02.170]  So, you know, support him.
[02:18:02.170 --> 02:18:03.730]  Boneyard seeds.
[02:18:03.730 --> 02:18:05.610]  Totally. Boneyard for sure.
[02:18:06.090 --> 02:18:08.810]  And I've had a lot of really good conversations with him.
[02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:12.050]  And he's dropped just like huge knowledge bombs on me.
[02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:14.810]  And back like when I was kind of just starting out into,
[02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:19.130]  you know, all these kind of sciences and stuff like he would just share info,
[02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:22.010]  just completely willing and like these huge gold nuggets of info
[02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:23.050]  that he didn't have to do.
[02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:27.370]  And like, yeah, I have tons of tons of respect for him.
[02:18:27.690 --> 02:18:29.770]  He's definitely super inspiring.
[02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:32.730]  He's someone that I look up to and that I still reach out to on
[02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:36.370]  on occasion if I need if I need like insight into something.
[02:18:36.370 --> 02:18:39.290]  And he always has knowledge that I just didn't even know.
[02:18:39.650 --> 02:18:42.330]  Like I need I didn't even know I didn't know. Right.
[02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:43.770]  He'll just drop something on me.
[02:18:43.770 --> 02:18:45.970]  And I'm like, yeah, like awesome.
[02:18:46.770 --> 02:18:52.010]  Just recently, I was talking to him about seed germination.
[02:18:53.170 --> 02:18:56.610]  And we were talking about soaking seeds
[02:18:56.610 --> 02:19:00.250]  like in a shot glass before germinating them, before planting.
[02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:05.130]  And he had mentioned how the process of doing that
[02:19:05.210 --> 02:19:09.250]  isn't for the intention for the seed to crack and to throw the tail,
[02:19:09.250 --> 02:19:10.570]  even though that'll happen.
[02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:14.130]  But it's actually to just trigger enzymatic and carbohydrate
[02:19:14.130 --> 02:19:19.930]  processes inside of the seed to prep it for being planted.
[02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:22.930]  So like even and to only do it for like 24 hours
[02:19:23.890 --> 02:19:26.730]  because it's just to kickstart those processes
[02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:30.010]  and then you put them in the soil, because sometimes leaving them
[02:19:30.010 --> 02:19:33.370]  in that shot glass or whatever container full of water
[02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:37.970]  will waterlog and drop the dissolved oxygen content of the seed
[02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:40.330]  and create problems and actually kill the seed.
[02:19:41.050 --> 02:19:44.130]  And that can happen with like the paper towel effect, too.
[02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:47.210]  Sometimes people, you know, just have like these soaking wet paper towels
[02:19:47.210 --> 02:19:49.650]  and they just put them in a plastic bag and they just so, you know, they
[02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:53.370]  suffocate their seeds and then they don't sprout for whatever reason.
[02:19:53.370 --> 02:19:54.650]  And sometimes, you know, it works.
[02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:56.850]  It works also, you know, like it's a pretty tried and true method.
[02:19:57.330 --> 02:20:00.530]  But that was something just recently I talked to him about where it's like
[02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:04.330]  it's about kickstarting processes in the seed and not so much
[02:20:04.330 --> 02:20:06.370]  cracking the seed itself.
[02:20:06.370 --> 02:20:09.090]  So have you ever tried sucking on your seeds before you plant them?
[02:20:09.690 --> 02:20:11.810]  You know, I've heard of that.
[02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:17.490]  I've heard of that about like giving it your specific body's enzyme profile
[02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:22.530]  and that the plant will then somehow respond to the enzymes
[02:20:22.530 --> 02:20:24.810]  that your body creates to like create like a
[02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:28.210]  it's going to create.
[02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:29.570]  It's going to grow for you.
[02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:32.450]  It's it's basically epigenetics.
[02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:36.250]  You're transferring your RNA onto that seed
[02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:42.210]  and then the seed or the plant will respond to your needs or your desires.
[02:20:42.210 --> 02:20:44.010]  You think that that's you really think that that works?
[02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:45.290]  You really think that's real?
[02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:46.810]  I believe 100 percent is legit.
[02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:51.050]  Got it. OK. All right.
[02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:54.370]  The only kind of moments I love.
[02:20:54.370 --> 02:20:58.170]  So, Luna, do you mind describing why you don't think that's true?
[02:20:59.290 --> 02:21:03.730]  I mean, does your body
[02:21:03.730 --> 02:21:07.290]  have a specific enzymatic profile based on your
[02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:11.290]  on your your ailments?
[02:21:11.530 --> 02:21:13.650]  Anastasia, there you go.
[02:21:13.650 --> 02:21:17.330]  Well, so a lot of people think it's not just ailment.
[02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:22.010]  It's more of what we call horizontal gene transfer.
[02:21:22.570 --> 02:21:25.890]  So look that do some research on horizontal gene transfer.
[02:21:25.930 --> 02:21:27.730]  It is. Oh, no, I'm familiar with it.
[02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:29.730]  Yeah. So it's the same thing.
[02:21:29.730 --> 02:21:31.370]  You're transferring your RNA.
[02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:33.530]  You're inscripting your RNA into that plant.
[02:21:34.890 --> 02:21:37.050]  So what I know about.
[02:21:37.050 --> 02:21:39.130]  So that's awesome. First of all, that's awesome.
[02:21:39.130 --> 02:21:43.570]  I never considered horizontal gene transfer when sucking on a on a seed.
[02:21:43.850 --> 02:21:45.050]  That's very interesting.
[02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:46.250]  And I'm totally down to try it.
[02:21:47.490 --> 02:21:48.250]  Are you familiar?
[02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:50.850]  This leads us into another whole rabbit hole we can go into.
[02:21:51.850 --> 02:21:55.490]  You mentioned it because I want to keep the conversation going.
[02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:58.610]  The solid conversation is going and horizontal gene transfer is
[02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:00.650]  just another huge rabbit hole.
[02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:01.970]  So are you familiar with
[02:22:03.810 --> 02:22:07.810]  lower fungi and horizontal gene transfer
[02:22:08.010 --> 02:22:12.810]  and how lower fungi evolves into new fungi through horizontal gene transfer?
[02:22:13.050 --> 02:22:14.290]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:22:14.290 --> 02:22:15.770]  Oh, yeah. It's it's it.
[02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:17.410]  Think of it as IMO, right?
[02:22:17.410 --> 02:22:22.650]  Everyone thinks IMO is is the master collection of all of the fungi exposed.
[02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:25.170]  It really isn't. It's the precursor.
[02:22:25.530 --> 02:22:28.690]  So a buddy of mine took IMO from three different collections
[02:22:28.690 --> 02:22:30.570]  across the country, sent it to Mr.
[02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:33.970]  DNA to have have it what's called meta bar coding.
[02:22:34.210 --> 02:22:37.410]  So it's not telling you exactly what that species is,
[02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:41.930]  but it's telling you of all the genetics that were present or are present.
[02:22:42.370 --> 02:22:43.810]  So where is the key word?
[02:22:43.810 --> 02:22:48.810]  So a lot of times the the the the existing RNA
[02:22:48.810 --> 02:22:53.730]  coding that was present in that soil gets uptaken by another organism
[02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:59.010]  and it allows that successionary jump to to provide
[02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:04.010]  the perfect successionary environment for those later successionary species,
[02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:05.970]  specifically with fungi.
[02:23:06.730 --> 02:23:08.690]  That that is that is fact.
[02:23:09.570 --> 02:23:13.090]  You will never get sap robes unless you have the right level
[02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:17.090]  of yeast and molds present in the soil for them.
[02:23:17.370 --> 02:23:19.690]  The sap robes to come and play and start doing their.
[02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:21.770]  So there's a lot to that.
[02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:24.890]  And again, we're just scratching the surface on this shit.
[02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:31.290]  But but because of the the demand, the understanding that we're depleted,
[02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:36.210]  our soil so bad that we've really got to stop using synthetics and going back.
[02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:38.290]  And that's driving colleges.
[02:23:38.290 --> 02:23:42.330]  That's driving research on these specific things.
[02:23:42.330 --> 02:23:45.170]  And yeah, some of the papers that have come out in the last two years,
[02:23:45.610 --> 02:23:46.770]  fucking mind bending.
[02:23:46.770 --> 02:23:50.210]  And they just send you down a rabbit hole like you're not coming back.
[02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:55.250]  Yeah, I'm glad that you brought up IMO.
[02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:57.570]  I would love to talk to you about IMO for a second.
[02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:01.810]  And so, you know, we know what we're talking about, IMO
[02:24:02.370 --> 02:24:03.690]  for everyone else that they don't know.
[02:24:03.690 --> 02:24:08.290]  So IMO is an abbreviation for indigenous microorganisms, and it's a K&F
[02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:14.410]  collection where people use rice like undercooked rice
[02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:18.290]  and put them in these wooden boxes that are aerobic
[02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:22.050]  and then leave them outside to go.
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:24.330]  Supposedly indigenous microorganisms.
[02:24:26.330 --> 02:24:29.210]  I am suspicious of how
[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:32.650]  variant microorganisms are from place to place.
[02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:36.570]  When it comes to like.
[02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:41.570]  One particular species not being in one place, but being in another place,
[02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:45.330]  I am of the.
[02:24:45.330 --> 02:24:49.610]  The ideology that our planet is super, super old
[02:24:49.850 --> 02:24:53.690]  and these things that blow around willy nilly in the air all over the place
[02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:56.010]  for millions and millions of years are all over the planet
[02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:02.210]  and that there aren't specific areas that have specific microbes that others don't.
[02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:05.810]  But what is happening is that the indigenous, the collection,
[02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:09.410]  the climate affects what is thriving.
[02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:14.650]  The topography, the the composition of the soil, the polyphenols,
[02:25:14.650 --> 02:25:18.370]  the polysaccharides, all the organic stuff in the surrounding area
[02:25:18.370 --> 02:25:20.570]  that affects what is in that area.
[02:25:21.930 --> 02:25:25.330]  And they're not super different from place to place.
[02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:26.930]  They're pretty minor differences.
[02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:30.930]  But the the climate is what allows other things to dominate
[02:25:31.650 --> 02:25:34.010]  a collection. Right.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:38.330]  So. I think that the I think that's just the way that it's taught
[02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:40.810]  maybe needs to be revised.
[02:25:41.450 --> 02:25:44.330]  But but yeah, it's still a cool concept.
[02:25:44.730 --> 02:25:46.930]  The the so when when people.
[02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:52.850]  Are collecting these things, they see this mycelial map that's formed,
[02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:57.290]  and I'm a part of different mycology groups on Facebook and stuff,
[02:25:57.290 --> 02:26:01.090]  and I just kind of try to educate myself on all the aspects of that surround
[02:26:01.410 --> 02:26:02.570]  cultivation.
[02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:06.530]  And every now and then you find someone, a practitioner that takes their collection
[02:26:06.810 --> 02:26:10.610]  and they post it in a mycology group and they're like, hey, like, what is this?
[02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:11.690]  Like, identify it.
[02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:14.250]  And all these mycologists just start laughing at him and they're like,
[02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:19.050]  it's food mold, you know, it's moocore and zygomycetes.
[02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:21.930]  And all these people are like, no, it's not.
[02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:24.170]  It's indigenous fungi from blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:26.810]  It's the fungi that I collected from the forest.
[02:26:26.810 --> 02:26:29.010]  And these people are just like, you know, no, it's not.
[02:26:29.010 --> 02:26:30.850]  It's it's it's food mold.
[02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.330]  And people are really upset.
[02:26:34.330 --> 02:26:38.930]  They're like, how dare you call our beautiful practice some mundane food mold?
[02:26:39.850 --> 02:26:46.330]  And so I wanted to take a second and and kind of research that that claim
[02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:51.530]  food mold, common food mold is moocore and zygomycetes.
[02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:56.810]  And while researching and discussing with other people,
[02:26:56.810 --> 02:27:00.890]  I learned that through horizontal gene transfer, these things can turn into other
[02:27:00.890 --> 02:27:04.770]  things that the soil needs in different fungal bodies.
[02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:08.330]  But they also have mycotransportation properties.
[02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:13.810]  So this very mundane thing that you see on all the food that drops from the trees
[02:27:13.810 --> 02:27:18.170]  and, you know, all around the place, this mold that people are like,
[02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:21.010]  this thing is common. It's not special. It's not special.
[02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:23.090]  You're not special. And people get all upset about it.
[02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:24.730]  Right. But like what?
[02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:27.570]  But like the thing is, is with moocore and zygomycetes,
[02:27:27.810 --> 02:27:32.290]  they have mycotransportation properties that connect to mycorrhizae
[02:27:32.490 --> 02:27:36.730]  and expand and multiply the surface area
[02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:40.810]  of a root zone in the mycorrhizal reach like massively.
[02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:43.610]  And so like, wow.
[02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:45.770]  You know, and it's everywhere.
[02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:46.850]  Moocore is everywhere.
[02:27:46.850 --> 02:27:49.410]  It's in every soil all across the planet.
[02:27:49.410 --> 02:27:50.650]  That's why it's everywhere.
[02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:53.290]  And that's why it's in your food when you leave it out for too long
[02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:56.290]  and it starts to mold because it's inside of the grain.
[02:27:56.290 --> 02:27:58.650]  It's it's inside of the fruit.
[02:27:58.650 --> 02:28:04.770]  It's a key, crucial, super important part of of the way that soil works
[02:28:04.770 --> 02:28:07.330]  and the way that decomposition functions.
[02:28:07.330 --> 02:28:11.050]  And it has this really cool property where it where it extends the reach
[02:28:11.050 --> 02:28:16.850]  of mycorrhizal networks and root zones to make nutrients available.
[02:28:17.170 --> 02:28:20.290]  So like you see this in like Bukashi and stuff, too,
[02:28:20.610 --> 02:28:24.450]  where it creates this mycelial mat, which is full of yeast
[02:28:24.450 --> 02:28:27.170]  and is full of lactobacillus and it's got actinibacteria in it.
[02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:33.490]  But like these these these mycelia, these lower fungi,
[02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:36.090]  this moocore and this this zygomycetes that can connect.
[02:28:36.090 --> 02:28:39.610]  And so like what you're doing is you're introducing your nutrient.
[02:28:41.010 --> 02:28:43.850]  So it's your top dress, your amendment, and then you have this Bukashi
[02:28:43.850 --> 02:28:44.850]  and it's just like immediately
[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:46.730]  connecting to mycorrhizal networks into the root zone.
[02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:49.410]  And it's like just available, like it's immediately available.
[02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:51.250]  I mean, not like immediately.
[02:28:51.250 --> 02:28:52.690]  It takes a few days, right?
[02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:53.890]  Or like a week or so.
[02:28:53.890 --> 02:28:59.330]  But it's it just drastically improves the functions of soil.
[02:28:59.810 --> 02:29:02.610]  And I believe that that's what IMO is doing.
[02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:07.050]  And so like, yes, like you're you're harnessing
[02:29:07.810 --> 02:29:11.010]  microbes in your environment.
[02:29:11.010 --> 02:29:14.290]  Rice is a starch source.
[02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:19.050]  It has a particular profile that feeds a particular range of bacteria
[02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:25.050]  and fungi, but not every bacteria and fungi wants to eat starch.
[02:29:25.770 --> 02:29:29.290]  It feeds all of that, like a lot of them, but not all of them.
[02:29:29.650 --> 02:29:31.850]  You know, there's definitely specific bacteria that prefers
[02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:34.250]  different polysaccharides, different energy sources.
[02:29:34.890 --> 02:29:37.570]  So you're not getting like a perfect mirror image,
[02:29:37.810 --> 02:29:41.050]  which I think sometimes is a misconception when it comes to IMO.
[02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:45.010]  And you're not getting a huge diversity of fungi,
[02:29:45.690 --> 02:29:49.090]  but you are implementing this very crucial thing that allows
[02:29:49.090 --> 02:29:53.330]  for the adaptation of the soil to create even new species of fungi
[02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:58.410]  and to connect to mycorrhizal networks, potentially new species of fungi,
[02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:04.690]  and to connect to mycorrhizal networks to make your root zone function better.
[02:30:06.130 --> 02:30:09.170]  And I think that's a beautiful, awesome thing, but it's not what
[02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:10.930]  it's not what it's taught.
[02:30:10.930 --> 02:30:13.530]  And so don't you mention me, people.
[02:30:14.130 --> 02:30:15.250]  Luny is spot on.
[02:30:15.250 --> 02:30:19.170]  What what IMO is doing is creating the right
[02:30:19.170 --> 02:30:22.850]  successional environment for the later
[02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:26.810]  successional fungi to come in and interconnect.
[02:30:26.850 --> 02:30:30.010]  And there's there was some recent work done on
[02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:33.970]  mycelium, that white thread that you see.
[02:30:34.290 --> 02:30:38.610]  And the fact that that's not only thousands of different bodies of sap
[02:30:38.610 --> 02:30:42.850]  rose, but there's also endophytic fungi and bacteria
[02:30:42.850 --> 02:30:46.650]  working with inside each one of those individual hyphes
[02:30:47.010 --> 02:30:48.850]  along with mycorrhizae.
[02:30:48.850 --> 02:30:54.050]  So there's these interactions that we don't have the ability to test yet and prove.
[02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:56.130]  But some of the some of the new
[02:30:57.530 --> 02:31:01.810]  microscopy that allows you to view things in situ,
[02:31:01.810 --> 02:31:05.730]  so in place and soil, are showing these interactions that are just
[02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:08.050]  just showing us that we know nothing.
[02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:09.970]  We're so far behind yet.
[02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:15.930]  But no, your your your belief or your your thought process on IMO is spot on.
[02:31:16.170 --> 02:31:18.890]  And to be honest with you, what they really need to teach is that
[02:31:19.290 --> 02:31:23.650]  all you're doing is collecting the foundation and that the real magic
[02:31:23.650 --> 02:31:27.530]  happens when you introduce it with soil, because now you've provided
[02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:31.730]  the right foundation for this, what I want to call jump
[02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:36.010]  in geological time in the soil because you're waking up all the existing
[02:31:36.010 --> 02:31:42.490]  microbes and the potential of that soil to be highly bio bioactive.
[02:31:42.490 --> 02:31:44.730]  So, yeah, it's a really important thing.
[02:31:45.130 --> 02:31:47.570]  But as long as you understand, that's not the end all be all.
[02:31:47.970 --> 02:31:51.930]  And more importantly, you know, and this was something
[02:31:51.930 --> 02:31:56.530]  Elaine brought up very early on was like, why aren't you using a local substrate?
[02:31:56.770 --> 02:32:00.330]  Something that's more traditional grown in your area
[02:32:00.330 --> 02:32:04.330]  that would potentially collect a greater number of these early
[02:32:04.330 --> 02:32:08.410]  successionary microbes that would jumpstart even more
[02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:10.610]  when you introduce it to the soil.
[02:32:10.610 --> 02:32:12.130]  And I think she's friggin right.
[02:32:12.130 --> 02:32:14.890]  And Afrin and I are going to be doing a study on this
[02:32:14.890 --> 02:32:18.250]  over the course of the next year or so where we're going to mix different
[02:32:18.250 --> 02:32:19.930]  substrates.
[02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:24.130]  I'm doing this wildlife bridge project here in SoCal.
[02:32:24.610 --> 02:32:28.410]  And part of that is we're we're collecting both indigenous plants,
[02:32:28.410 --> 02:32:33.930]  but indigenous microbes to rebuild the soils for the animals to cross the bridge.
[02:32:33.970 --> 02:32:35.450]  It's a cool project.
[02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:37.690]  But one of the things that we're going to experiment with,
[02:32:37.690 --> 02:32:40.330]  and I encourage everybody out there to do this,
[02:32:40.810 --> 02:32:44.050]  is get yourself some spent mushroom substrate.
[02:32:44.610 --> 02:32:47.490]  All right. So mushroom block that's being thrown out.
[02:32:47.890 --> 02:32:50.090]  Take it and you got to smash it.
[02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:53.170]  So you don't want to you don't want to expose the whole thing to air,
[02:32:53.570 --> 02:32:59.010]  but you want to burst the bags and let it set it so that all of the biocide
[02:32:59.290 --> 02:33:02.210]  that's being generated in that bag is leaks out.
[02:33:02.730 --> 02:33:06.050]  So by biocide, the fungi naturally releases
[02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:08.890]  all of these different compounds to kill off any competitor
[02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:12.210]  because they want that block and that's their life.
[02:33:12.610 --> 02:33:17.370]  So they excrete these these biocides that kill other types of fungi,
[02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:21.370]  other types of bacteria that could cross contaminate their their space.
[02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:24.090]  So you want to get rid of the biocide.
[02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:28.770]  And then you want to once you've gotten rid of that, open the bag slightly
[02:33:28.770 --> 02:33:32.370]  and let it the wind bring in all of the indigenous organisms
[02:33:32.730 --> 02:33:36.770]  or take that and put it in a wooden box and put it under a tree.
[02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:40.170]  Because now you've got the perfect substrate to collect
[02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:44.050]  everything that's potentially there, not just a specific one
[02:33:44.050 --> 02:33:47.810]  due to the fact you use rice substrate instead of a substrate
[02:33:47.810 --> 02:33:51.450]  that's designed to collect and grow fungi.
[02:33:51.970 --> 02:33:54.410]  I love that. Right.
[02:33:54.410 --> 02:33:57.450]  That is so that's spot on to me.
[02:33:57.690 --> 02:33:59.610]  And you're going to have a whole bunch of people
[02:33:59.610 --> 02:34:01.890]  that are going to be really upset with you.
[02:34:01.890 --> 02:34:05.730]  But Brian knows all about controversy.
[02:34:07.770 --> 02:34:09.250]  Yeah. Well, it's not.
[02:34:09.250 --> 02:34:11.730]  Is it controversy when you're bringing up good points?
[02:34:11.770 --> 02:34:14.130]  I mean, shouldn't we all be trying to find out the truth?
[02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:17.890]  I mean, we're not nobody wants to have the bro science anymore.
[02:34:17.930 --> 02:34:19.770]  Like we all want to find out together.
[02:34:19.770 --> 02:34:21.530]  And there's room for improvement.
[02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:24.050]  That technology is thousands of years old.
[02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:27.210]  They didn't have that mushroom substrate back then.
[02:34:27.690 --> 02:34:29.850]  So, of course, they couldn't use it.
[02:34:29.850 --> 02:34:33.170]  But I'm doing a ton of work with this Luna up in Peach Hill soils.
[02:34:33.170 --> 02:34:36.090]  I'm gearing up to do a whole week up there with a bunch of different
[02:34:36.090 --> 02:34:39.010]  pieces of equipment, different types of
[02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:42.730]  building a bunch of bioreactors, which are just compost,
[02:34:42.810 --> 02:34:45.970]  but a compost upright so I can mix different ingredients together
[02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:46.770]  to see the results.
[02:34:46.770 --> 02:34:47.930]  That's a cool. Yeah.
[02:34:47.930 --> 02:34:50.490]  And I got I got tons of spent mushroom substrate
[02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:53.050]  that I've been getting prepared for this.
[02:34:53.890 --> 02:34:55.570]  Very cool. Yeah, really.
[02:34:55.570 --> 02:34:56.810]  I love that idea.
[02:34:56.810 --> 02:34:58.170]  And, you know, it makes sense to me.
[02:34:58.170 --> 02:34:59.850]  And I think that there's there's some
[02:35:01.010 --> 02:35:03.410]  validity in doing like a couple of different approaches where like
[02:35:03.930 --> 02:35:06.930]  you're using like a pasteurized substrate, you know, potentially,
[02:35:07.130 --> 02:35:10.170]  which might just get infected with trichoderma and aspergillus.
[02:35:10.170 --> 02:35:13.170]  And it will. But yeah, it will.
[02:35:13.770 --> 02:35:17.570]  But it'll get lucky and collect something different to,
[02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:19.690]  you know, some like indigenous stuff.
[02:35:20.970 --> 02:35:24.290]  But what you're saying, like or what you mentioned, Elaine said,
[02:35:24.290 --> 02:35:27.730]  and I'm a big fan of Elaine, too, but I don't
[02:35:27.810 --> 02:35:30.730]  I don't completely subscribe to everybody's specific systems.
[02:35:30.730 --> 02:35:32.810]  I like to pick and choose and do what makes sense to me.
[02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:35.930]  But I'm a big fan of Elaine and microscopy and stuff.
[02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:39.970]  But the whole using a native input
[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:44.090]  makes so much sense to me, because whatever you're using,
[02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:48.090]  like what you eat, what whatever is grown,
[02:35:48.690 --> 02:35:51.410]  a massive amount of of endophytes.
[02:35:51.450 --> 02:35:53.930]  We can get an endophyte, too, if you want.
[02:35:53.930 --> 02:35:56.090]  Are are inside of the plant.
[02:35:56.210 --> 02:36:00.410]  Right. You know, this the native endophytes, the bacteria,
[02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:04.970]  the fungi from your surrounding area, a lot of it is inside
[02:36:05.210 --> 02:36:07.410]  of whatever input you're using.
[02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:12.130]  And so if you go and you buy, you know, rice from
[02:36:13.650 --> 02:36:16.090]  God knows where, whoever, you know, like wherever rice is grown
[02:36:16.090 --> 02:36:17.490]  and it's not grown in your native area
[02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:19.810]  because it's definitely not rice growing in most native areas.
[02:36:19.810 --> 02:36:23.410]  You're not introducing indigenous microbes.
[02:36:23.770 --> 02:36:26.610]  You're introducing a whole bunch of microbes from that area.
[02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:28.570]  And is that a big deal?
[02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:32.130]  Probably not really, but it's just not what it just does.
[02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:34.210]  It's just not what it says it is.
[02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:35.890]  And that bothers me a little bit.
[02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:40.210]  But if you use a substrate that is grown locally, what I prefer to do,
[02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:44.050]  I don't use IMO and it's not that I don't like IMO or, you know,
[02:36:44.050 --> 02:36:46.810]  I just prefer earthworm castings and Bukashi.
[02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:51.610]  I like to make my Bukashi
[02:36:51.610 --> 02:36:56.970]  from a local grain source and then, you know, inoculate my lactobacillus
[02:36:56.970 --> 02:36:59.210]  and I'll actually add KNF inputs to it.
[02:36:59.210 --> 02:37:02.170]  I'll use like OHN and FPJ or beet juice,
[02:37:02.210 --> 02:37:04.250]  which is kind of a tech that I got from Alan Ankinson.
[02:37:04.690 --> 02:37:10.250]  And I like to just kind of create a product
[02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:12.530]  that's really locally based.
[02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:14.490]  And that makes more sense to me for introducing
[02:37:14.490 --> 02:37:18.090]  a local biology that is adapted to your climate.
[02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:21.010]  And I think that that biology that's adapted to your specific climate
[02:37:21.010 --> 02:37:23.010]  is super important.
[02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:25.650]  And you know what I love when you said endophytes.
[02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:31.130]  I speak a lot about diversity in compost building.
[02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:34.810]  And I talk about collecting all the different types of leaves that you can find.
[02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:39.850]  Green for your course, because it's filled with endophytes,
[02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:42.050]  both bacteria and fungi.
[02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:47.010]  And if you slow compost, you never hit more than 120 degrees.
[02:37:47.730 --> 02:37:51.330]  You're going to release all of those endophytes into your compost.
[02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:52.970]  Now you make an extract.
[02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:54.810]  Guess what? You apply it to the soil.
[02:37:54.810 --> 02:37:56.250]  The plant picks them up.
[02:37:56.250 --> 02:38:00.450]  Bam. You got you introduced to the fight into your system.
[02:38:02.170 --> 02:38:06.730]  Absolutely. So, so that's a huge part of, you know, like you said,
[02:38:06.730 --> 02:38:10.890]  using native plants and organic matter
[02:38:11.130 --> 02:38:14.690]  and feeding them to worms or feeding them to black butterfly larvae,
[02:38:14.730 --> 02:38:16.290]  you know, like to, you know,
[02:38:16.290 --> 02:38:19.410]  capture all those things in the form that they're not getting cooked off like you
[02:38:19.410 --> 02:38:22.090]  would in a thermophilic composting process,
[02:38:22.610 --> 02:38:25.130]  which is another reason why I love thermophilic breakdown.
[02:38:25.930 --> 02:38:27.850]  So we're on the same page.
[02:38:28.210 --> 02:38:29.210]  You and I.
[02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:35.770]  And I get to go play in this yard that's like a like a chef or a baker's dream.
[02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:38.490]  I got every different type of material to play with.
[02:38:38.890 --> 02:38:42.210]  I can claw dust. I can have old gum.
[02:38:42.210 --> 02:38:43.570]  I can have new stuff.
[02:38:43.570 --> 02:38:46.370]  I got worm castings, like everything to play with up there.
[02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:49.290]  So I think a lot of really good work is going to come out of there.
[02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:52.090]  And you're going to take video for us, Leighton,
[02:38:52.090 --> 02:38:55.970]  lots and lots of videos so we can see what the hell is going on with your
[02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:56.810]  experiments.
[02:38:58.570 --> 02:39:02.050]  Yes, sir. And another thing is too, we got to give shout out to Tone.
[02:39:02.250 --> 02:39:06.770]  He's on power hour, OG power hour every Monday with Ken and they're dropping
[02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:10.090]  some great gold bars and knowledge along that podcast as well. So.
[02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:12.210]  And you're there all the time too now, Leighton.
[02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:14.250]  So you can throw yourself in there too, you know.
[02:39:14.370 --> 02:39:17.090]  Next week I can't, but I'll try every time I can.
[02:39:17.970 --> 02:39:18.810]  Okay.
[02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:21.530]  So do we want to open it up to questions?
[02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:24.850]  We're two hours and 40 minutes into it already.
[02:39:24.850 --> 02:39:27.050]  And I know I don't know about you Luna,
[02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:29.850]  but I'm busy as a motherfucker right now. And so.
[02:39:31.970 --> 02:39:32.810]  So sure.
[02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:38.650]  Okay. Let's start with questions. And can labs help to avoid
[02:39:42.450 --> 02:39:47.410]  Yes. So, so labs are a
[02:39:49.290 --> 02:39:50.930]  opportunistic microbe. They,
[02:39:50.970 --> 02:39:55.090]  they will competitively exclude pathogens of how
[02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:58.850]  it functions. So you,
[02:39:58.970 --> 02:40:01.570]  I feel like it makes sense that you can prevent
[02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:07.450]  Septoria with lactobacillus. You can try, excuse me,
[02:40:07.450 --> 02:40:10.970]  to outcompete it with lactobacillus. It's going to be easier to prevent it.
[02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:16.450]  Competitive exclusion is the concept of occupying all the
[02:40:16.450 --> 02:40:20.570]  space that a pathogen would occupy with beneficial bacteria
[02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:23.250]  or, or just microbes in general.
[02:40:25.410 --> 02:40:29.530]  And so you can accomplish competitive exclusion with a whole bunch of different
[02:40:29.530 --> 02:40:34.650]  biology. But lactobacillus is a great way to do it too. So,
[02:40:34.930 --> 02:40:38.250]  yeah. So there you go. I think I answered the question.
[02:40:38.770 --> 02:40:40.690]  Anybody else want to stab at that one too?
[02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:44.850]  As always, don't be a moron with that stuff. You know,
[02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:49.850]  a little goes a long way. You can cause problems on both
[02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:52.650]  sides. So it's kind of like a Goldilocks approach with that one.
[02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:55.450]  And again, diversity, diversity, diversity.
[02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:59.530]  If you've got incredible diversity and healthy microbial activity in your soils,
[02:40:59.810 --> 02:41:02.610]  you're not going to have to worry about shit like that. It'll get consumed.
[02:41:02.650 --> 02:41:06.570]  Yeah. Well, it's either a bio-inoculant or a bio-stimulant, right?
[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:10.970]  Next question would be,
[02:41:10.970 --> 02:41:15.970]  I wonder if Luna is using seed sprout teas specific
[02:41:15.970 --> 02:41:18.330]  times for the hormones.
[02:41:20.130 --> 02:41:22.370]  So I do. I do do that. I do a lot of it.
[02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:29.690]  And so my approach with seed sprout teas are that you're building the
[02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:32.330]  foundation for the biology to make the hormones.
[02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:38.330]  I use that Dr. Duke's database to look up the
[02:41:40.330 --> 02:41:44.330]  organic profile of, I think it was alfalfa. Yeah,
[02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:48.530]  it was alfalfa because I was looking for tricontinol and the sprout doesn't have
[02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:49.370]  tricontinol in it.
[02:41:50.850 --> 02:41:55.850]  But when I looked through all the organic compounds and cause I was being
[02:41:55.890 --> 02:41:56.970]  a crazy person apparently,
[02:41:57.010 --> 02:42:00.050]  but I went through and I Google searched every organic compound inside of it
[02:42:00.050 --> 02:42:04.050]  just because I was curious. And I did find that one of them,
[02:42:04.050 --> 02:42:09.050]  I don't remember what it was when in combination with another biology did help
[02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:14.050]  promote tricontinol in the soil. And I'm not so like,
[02:42:14.050 --> 02:42:17.050]  so yeah, to answer your question. Yeah,
[02:42:17.050 --> 02:42:22.050]  I do like to use sprouted seed teas. They have great enzyme profiles.
[02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:27.250]  Specific ones have higher enzymes at specific times they peak and then they
[02:42:27.250 --> 02:42:31.250]  fall off really quickly. So just whatever you're using, look it up.
[02:42:31.250 --> 02:42:36.250]  And hopefully that there's research on the potency of enzymes and at what time
[02:42:36.250 --> 02:42:40.250]  and their, their germination and then try to use them at that time. But yeah,
[02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:41.250]  I like using sprouted seed teas.
[02:42:42.250 --> 02:42:46.250]  Fantastic. We'll jump right into this one.
[02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:50.250]  We just wanted to confirm that we have a question from our audience.
[02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:55.450]  And this one we just wanted to confirm it was missing link genetics and
[02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:59.450]  boneyard seeds that you're using there or that you were giving the shout out to.
[02:42:59.450 --> 02:43:00.450]  Yeah.
[02:43:00.450 --> 02:43:01.450]  Okay.
[02:43:01.450 --> 02:43:02.450]  Okay.
[02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:04.450]  That was an easy one. Quick to answer.
[02:43:04.450 --> 02:43:05.450]  Okay.
[02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:10.450]  We'll go to this one here is gently collecting small pieces of mycelium from
[02:43:10.450 --> 02:43:15.450]  the forest floor and inoculating that into compost piles better.
[02:43:15.450 --> 02:43:16.450]  Okay.
[02:43:16.650 --> 02:43:17.650]  I can speak on this.
[02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:19.650]  Efron's done a lot of work on this.
[02:43:19.650 --> 02:43:26.650]  The only true known propagules are root fragments and spores.
[02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:29.650]  It has never been proven that the hyphae,
[02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:35.650]  the body of the organism when introduced into a new environment will survive,
[02:43:35.650 --> 02:43:37.650]  let alone thrive and grow out.
[02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:40.650]  So the mycelium isn't what you're looking for.
[02:43:40.650 --> 02:43:42.650]  You're looking for the root fragments.
[02:43:42.850 --> 02:43:43.850]  But generally speaking,
[02:43:43.850 --> 02:43:45.850]  if you find mycelial networks,
[02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:47.850]  you're going to get spores with it.
[02:43:47.850 --> 02:43:48.850]  So that's it.
[02:43:48.850 --> 02:43:50.850]  Use it as a hunting tool,
[02:43:50.850 --> 02:43:53.850]  not as a tool to transfer to organisms.
[02:43:53.850 --> 02:43:54.850]  That makes sense.
[02:43:54.850 --> 02:43:55.850]  Anybody else?
[02:43:55.850 --> 02:43:56.850]  Luna?
[02:43:56.850 --> 02:43:57.850]  No,
[02:43:57.850 --> 02:43:58.850]  that was great.
[02:43:58.850 --> 02:43:59.850]  That was great.
[02:43:59.850 --> 02:44:00.850]  I didn't,
[02:44:00.850 --> 02:44:01.850]  I didn't know that.
[02:44:01.850 --> 02:44:02.850]  So yeah,
[02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:03.850]  it's one without the other,
[02:44:03.850 --> 02:44:04.850]  right?
[02:44:04.850 --> 02:44:05.850]  Well,
[02:44:05.850 --> 02:44:06.850]  it's a,
[02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:07.850]  it's a,
[02:44:07.850 --> 02:44:08.850]  it's a,
[02:44:08.850 --> 02:44:09.850]  it's a,
[02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:10.850]  it's a,
[02:44:10.850 --> 02:44:11.850]  it's a,
[02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:13.050]  well,
[02:44:13.050 --> 02:44:15.050]  I think that the problem is in the industry.
[02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:17.050]  It's all about making money.
[02:44:17.050 --> 02:44:19.050]  So they include it as a propagule.
[02:44:19.050 --> 02:44:21.050]  But the bottom line is that just shows,
[02:44:21.050 --> 02:44:22.050]  oh,
[02:44:22.050 --> 02:44:24.050]  we have more propagules than you do.
[02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:25.050]  But again,
[02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:27.050]  there's no evidence that hyphae will grow.
[02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:29.050]  It'll be a bio stimulant for sure.
[02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:31.050]  But we do not know that it will be a bio.
[02:44:33.050 --> 02:44:34.050]  Perfect answer.
[02:44:34.050 --> 02:44:36.050]  So you were talking about,
[02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:38.050]  you were using lava rock,
[02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:39.050]  cinder,
[02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:41.050]  however you want to pronounce it.
[02:44:41.250 --> 02:44:42.250]  In your grows,
[02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:44.250]  they're asking black or red.
[02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:51.250]  And then the other question in the same frame was where do you get pumice and cinder in bulk?
[02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:54.250]  Like where do I source it?
[02:44:55.250 --> 02:44:56.250]  So I'm using red.
[02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:02.250]  I'm in Oregon in like lava country.
[02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:03.250]  So it is,
[02:45:03.250 --> 02:45:04.250]  it's like everywhere.
[02:45:05.250 --> 02:45:07.250]  Like I literally go outside and pick up a piece of cinder,
[02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:10.250]  but I did not collect it from my yard.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:11.450]  It was just that the,
[02:45:12.450 --> 02:45:16.450]  I contacted the soil place and I brought them a bunch of amendments and they just had it there.
[02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:18.450]  I mean,
[02:45:18.450 --> 02:45:19.450]  I don't even remember the place of the soil place,
[02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:20.450]  the name of the soil place.
[02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:21.450]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:22.450 --> 02:45:23.450]  But it's just,
[02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:27.450]  it's a really common input where I live.
[02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:29.450]  So it was just,
[02:45:29.450 --> 02:45:30.450]  it just like fell in my lap.
[02:45:30.450 --> 02:45:31.450]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:31.450 --> 02:45:32.450]  I don't have better information for you,
[02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:34.450]  but just try to find the closest place.
[02:45:34.450 --> 02:45:37.450]  I guess try to get local stuff always in my opinion.
[02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:39.450]  Yeah.
[02:45:39.650 --> 02:45:40.650]  Yeah.
[02:45:40.650 --> 02:45:41.650]  Layton,
[02:45:41.650 --> 02:45:42.650]  any ideas on that one?
[02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:43.650]  Absolutely.
[02:45:43.650 --> 02:45:46.650]  Go to your local soil blenders.
[02:45:46.650 --> 02:45:50.650]  So that would be a golf course,
[02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:52.650]  contractors,
[02:45:52.650 --> 02:45:54.650]  sports field contractors.
[02:45:54.650 --> 02:46:00.650]  They're going to have these mixes specifically because of rooftop gardens became so popular.
[02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:03.650]  So those blenders are also blending the soils,
[02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:05.650]  these lightweight soils for,
[02:46:05.650 --> 02:46:07.650]  for rooftop growers,
[02:46:07.850 --> 02:46:08.850]  container growers.
[02:46:08.850 --> 02:46:10.850]  So there'll be a great resource of local,
[02:46:10.850 --> 02:46:19.850]  generally locally produced sources of aeration like hummus and or what do you call it?
[02:46:19.850 --> 02:46:20.850]  You call it cinder.
[02:46:20.850 --> 02:46:21.850]  I never heard it called cinder,
[02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:23.850]  but it's probably a local term,
[02:46:23.850 --> 02:46:25.850]  but any of these porous,
[02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:29.850]  what we call igneous extrusions.
[02:46:29.850 --> 02:46:36.850]  So that igneous liquid rock that comes to the surface as exposed to air and it starts to pop and gas.
[02:46:37.050 --> 02:46:38.050]  So that's,
[02:46:38.050 --> 02:46:39.050]  that's the short answer.
[02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:40.050]  But yeah,
[02:46:40.050 --> 02:46:42.050]  there's usually some kind of,
[02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:50.050]  and if you can't find a specific soil blender or a golf course or sports turf builder,
[02:46:50.050 --> 02:46:52.050]  just search the area.
[02:46:52.050 --> 02:46:54.050]  Just go a little bit bigger in the search.
[02:46:54.050 --> 02:46:58.050]  You should generally going to find somebody unless you're out in the middle of Oregon.
[02:46:58.050 --> 02:46:59.050]  I don't know.
[02:46:59.050 --> 02:47:04.050]  So lay,
[02:47:04.250 --> 02:47:05.250]  so lay,
[02:47:05.250 --> 02:47:06.250]  what was cinder?
[02:47:06.250 --> 02:47:07.250]  Sorry,
[02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:08.250]  I'd interrupt you.
[02:47:08.250 --> 02:47:09.250]  Cinder pyroclastic mineral.
[02:47:09.250 --> 02:47:10.250]  Yes,
[02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:11.250]  exactly right.
[02:47:11.250 --> 02:47:12.250]  Pyroclastic.
[02:47:12.250 --> 02:47:13.250]  Yeah.
[02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:14.250]  So Layton,
[02:47:14.250 --> 02:47:18.250]  was this the book that you were referring to earlier in the show?
[02:47:18.250 --> 02:47:20.250]  I tried to give him a shout out.
[02:47:20.250 --> 02:47:23.250]  That is not the specific one,
[02:47:23.250 --> 02:47:32.250]  but I guarantee you that was probably built off of the book that was written in the 1800s and very well may be expanded on.
[02:47:32.450 --> 02:47:41.450]  So I would definitely grab that as a resource and check it out and then use those companion plants for your extracts and or planting next to your plants.
[02:47:41.450 --> 02:47:43.450]  Perfect.
[02:47:43.450 --> 02:47:45.450]  So this one is directly to you,
[02:47:45.450 --> 02:47:46.450]  Luna.
[02:47:46.450 --> 02:47:49.450]  Have you played with super labs?
[02:47:49.450 --> 02:47:51.450]  Super labs.
[02:47:51.450 --> 02:47:54.450]  So I was talking to Steve Reznor about this.
[02:47:54.450 --> 02:47:55.450]  Yeah.
[02:47:55.450 --> 02:47:56.450]  No,
[02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:57.450]  transverse.
[02:47:57.450 --> 02:47:58.450]  No,
[02:47:58.450 --> 02:47:59.450]  I haven't.
[02:47:59.450 --> 02:48:00.450]  I'm going to though.
[02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:05.650]  I need to make fresh labs right now because it's not something that I use all the time.
[02:48:05.650 --> 02:48:08.650]  But I would like to.
[02:48:08.650 --> 02:48:09.650]  I'm into the idea.
[02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:11.650]  I've talked about it to other people.
[02:48:11.650 --> 02:48:14.650]  They say that the protease,
[02:48:14.650 --> 02:48:22.650]  the proteolytic enzymes in labs help break down the spirulina to make the phyto,
[02:48:22.650 --> 02:48:24.650]  phytocyanin,
[02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.650]  phytocyanins.
[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:29.650]  Better available.
[02:48:29.850 --> 02:48:32.850]  So I'm not super familiar with it,
[02:48:32.850 --> 02:48:35.850]  but that's what I understand to be the principle behind it.
[02:48:35.850 --> 02:48:36.850]  I have not made it.
[02:48:36.850 --> 02:48:38.850]  I aspire to here soon.
[02:48:40.850 --> 02:48:42.850]  Fantastic.
[02:48:42.850 --> 02:48:43.850]  Yeah.
[02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:44.850]  The more research you do,
[02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:45.850]  the more you learn,
[02:48:45.850 --> 02:48:46.850]  the better grower you're going to be.
[02:48:47.850 --> 02:48:48.850]  Absolutely.
[02:48:49.850 --> 02:48:52.850]  So we were talking about too much acid.
[02:48:52.850 --> 02:48:56.850]  Somebody was asking about pineapple in JLF.
[02:48:56.850 --> 02:48:57.850]  So would we not?
[02:48:58.050 --> 02:48:59.050]  Yeah,
[02:48:59.050 --> 02:49:02.050]  because we were talking to what you were fermenting had too much.
[02:49:02.050 --> 02:49:04.050]  It was too acidic.
[02:49:05.050 --> 02:49:07.050]  So it's the enzyme itself.
[02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:08.050]  The enzyme,
[02:49:08.050 --> 02:49:10.050]  enzymes break down organic matter.
[02:49:10.050 --> 02:49:14.050]  So Jadam liquid fertilizer.
[02:49:14.050 --> 02:49:15.050]  I,
[02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:17.050]  I've never done anything.
[02:49:17.050 --> 02:49:18.050]  Jadam.
[02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:19.050]  A lot of people like it.
[02:49:19.050 --> 02:49:21.050]  A lot of people have success with it.
[02:49:21.050 --> 02:49:25.050]  I was specifically referring to FPJ.
[02:49:25.250 --> 02:49:28.250]  Like the Kena style ferment of pineapple.
[02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:31.250]  And I'm learned that mistake the hard way.
[02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:35.250]  I wish someone would have told me,
[02:49:35.250 --> 02:49:42.250]  but I fermented pineapple in brown sugar and I put it on my crop and I
[02:49:42.250 --> 02:49:44.250]  killed the whole thing.
[02:49:44.250 --> 02:49:45.250]  I killed the whole thing.
[02:49:45.250 --> 02:49:46.250]  The whole thing died.
[02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:50.250]  I had a complete crop failure and I'm very embarrassing.
[02:49:50.250 --> 02:49:51.250]  And sometimes you learn lessons.
[02:49:51.450 --> 02:49:52.450]  Yeah,
[02:49:52.450 --> 02:49:53.450]  that's,
[02:49:53.450 --> 02:49:54.450]  that's what happens.
[02:49:54.450 --> 02:49:56.450]  And in the Kena community,
[02:49:56.450 --> 02:50:01.450]  I've heard people say that you only use pineapple FPJ on pineapple for
[02:50:01.450 --> 02:50:02.450]  whatever reason.
[02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:03.450]  So,
[02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:04.450]  but I don't know.
[02:50:04.450 --> 02:50:05.450]  Yeah,
[02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:06.450]  I just,
[02:50:06.450 --> 02:50:08.450]  maybe I used too much or whatever,
[02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:09.450]  but I killed,
[02:50:09.450 --> 02:50:10.450]  I killed my whole run.
[02:50:10.450 --> 02:50:12.450]  It was a great day.
[02:50:12.450 --> 02:50:13.450]  It was a great day.
[02:50:13.450 --> 02:50:15.450]  So great lesson for everybody out there.
[02:50:15.450 --> 02:50:17.450]  I'm going to go ahead and wrap up.
[02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:18.650]  It was a great day.
[02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:21.650]  So great lesson for everybody out there.
[02:50:21.650 --> 02:50:23.650]  Instead of learning these lessons by doing it yourself,
[02:50:23.650 --> 02:50:25.650]  learn from somebody who tried it.
[02:50:25.650 --> 02:50:26.650]  And again,
[02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:27.650]  don't do it on everything.
[02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:31.650]  Just do it on one plant or two plants to see what the reactions.
[02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:32.650]  Poor Luna.
[02:50:32.650 --> 02:50:33.650]  I'm sorry,
[02:50:33.650 --> 02:50:34.650]  that sucks.
[02:50:34.650 --> 02:50:35.650]  Oh,
[02:50:35.650 --> 02:50:36.650]  it was tragic.
[02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:37.650]  It was a tragic.
[02:50:37.650 --> 02:50:38.650]  But I,
[02:50:38.650 --> 02:50:42.650]  cause like there's this concept that's passed around that roots are good
[02:50:42.650 --> 02:50:44.650]  for roots and fruits are good for fruits.
[02:50:44.650 --> 02:50:45.650]  And the bigger the fruit,
[02:50:45.850 --> 02:50:47.850]  the more hormones it has for,
[02:50:47.850 --> 02:50:50.850]  for the plants or whatever,
[02:50:50.850 --> 02:50:51.850]  which is,
[02:50:51.850 --> 02:50:52.850]  you know,
[02:50:52.850 --> 02:50:53.850]  just not right.
[02:50:53.850 --> 02:50:54.850]  But you know,
[02:50:54.850 --> 02:50:56.850]  the concept is kind of there,
[02:50:56.850 --> 02:50:58.850]  but there's more explanation to be,
[02:50:58.850 --> 02:50:59.850]  to be made.
[02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:00.850]  So what I did was like,
[02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:01.850]  Oh,
[02:51:01.850 --> 02:51:02.850]  big fruit,
[02:51:02.850 --> 02:51:03.850]  pineapple is a big fruit.
[02:51:03.850 --> 02:51:05.850]  I'm going to ferment pineapple.
[02:51:05.850 --> 02:51:07.850]  And then I added it to everything and it all died.
[02:51:07.850 --> 02:51:08.850]  And I was like,
[02:51:08.850 --> 02:51:09.850]  cool.
[02:51:09.850 --> 02:51:10.850]  Great.
[02:51:10.850 --> 02:51:11.850]  Yeah.
[02:51:11.850 --> 02:51:12.850]  Well,
[02:51:12.850 --> 02:51:14.850]  at least it's a mistake that I made.
[02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:17.050]  It's just a mistake that you're willing to share.
[02:51:17.050 --> 02:51:20.050]  And that's where we all learn from your sharing.
[02:51:20.050 --> 02:51:21.050]  Now,
[02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:23.050]  anybody that watches this video is going to go,
[02:51:23.050 --> 02:51:24.050]  Oh,
[02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:25.050]  I don't think I want to try that.
[02:51:25.050 --> 02:51:26.050]  Right?
[02:51:26.050 --> 02:51:27.050]  Yeah.
[02:51:27.050 --> 02:51:28.050]  Don't,
[02:51:28.050 --> 02:51:29.050]  don't,
[02:51:29.050 --> 02:51:30.050]  don't try it.
[02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:31.050]  Be really careful and do research on what you're doing.
[02:51:31.050 --> 02:51:32.050]  You know,
[02:51:32.050 --> 02:51:33.050]  look stuff up before you,
[02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:34.050]  before you,
[02:51:34.050 --> 02:51:35.050]  that's where Layton,
[02:51:35.050 --> 02:51:37.050]  Layton's advice of try it on one or two plants,
[02:51:37.050 --> 02:51:41.050]  not on your whole run really comes in when you're trying something brand
[02:51:41.050 --> 02:51:42.050]  new,
[02:51:42.050 --> 02:51:43.050]  don't do it to everything.
[02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:45.250]  Just do it as a couple and see what the reaction is.
[02:51:45.250 --> 02:51:46.250]  Definitely.
[02:51:46.250 --> 02:51:47.250]  Definitely.
[02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:54.250]  So does molasses brew a more bacteria or fungal tea?
[02:51:54.250 --> 02:52:03.240]  So here's the deal.
[02:52:03.240 --> 02:52:07.240]  I don't like using molasses.
[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:14.240]  I see sharp growth and sharp die off with molasses.
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:22.440]  A lot of the time fungal bodies and protozoa are based on how long you let
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:27.440]  your tea go and the amount of agitation you have in your tea and whether or
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:31.440]  not there are inputs in your tea for fungi to latch onto.
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:37.440]  So I like to use oat flour as my fungal food source,
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:40.440]  because it's a free floating fine powder.
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:48.640]  Flour that gives a good place for fungi to latch onto and to inoculate and
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:50.640]  then kind of start to grow.
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:56.640]  And then I like to use red beet or different polysaccharides as like a
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:58.640]  bacterial food source.
[02:52:58.640 --> 02:52:59.640]  So inulin,
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:01.640]  I like using inulin a lot,
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:05.640]  which is one of the main polysaccharides in red beet.
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:07.640]  It's also in Jerusalem.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:10.840]  I think that there's a higher concentration in Jerusalem artichoke,
[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:11.840]  actually.
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:15.840]  So I use both of those and you can see that in the tea that I made recently.
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:21.840]  I use red beet and oat flour and it turns the tea this wicked color for
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:27.840]  the first like 24 hours and then it just oxidizes or the color changes.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:28.840]  I assume it's oxidizing,
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:29.840]  right?
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:31.840]  So molasses,
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:33.840]  I'm not a fan of molasses.
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:37.040]  You can definitely get fungal bodies with molasses.
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:39.040]  If you want to do that,
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.040]  add some like glacial rock dust.
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.040]  That'll also create huge bacterial blooms too.
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:46.040]  You'll get like biofilms.
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:50.040]  So I guess if you're looking for a fungal dominant brew,
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:52.040]  kelp is really good for that.
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:53.040]  But oat flour,
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:57.040]  I think is a steady growth and not a bad growth.
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.040]  So I'm not a big fan of it.
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:00.240]  But oat flour,
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:05.240]  I think is a steady growth and not like a huge spike.
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:07.240]  You can see huge spikes when using kelp.
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.240]  You can see huge spikes when using molasses to ferment with.
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.240]  And even fish powder,
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:14.240]  or I'm sorry,
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:15.240]  fish hydrosolate,
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:17.240]  which I very,
[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:18.240]  very,
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:19.240]  very rarely use.
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:24.240]  I like using fish in the beginning of like prepping a soil to set a
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:25.240]  foundation.
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:26.440]  In my mind,
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  fish and kelp and molasses are like gasoline and your microbes are fire.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:36.440]  And so you'll see them go whoosh and then they go,
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.440]  and then it disappears.
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:41.440]  And I just don't like that approach.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:44.440]  And I see polysaccharides more as wood.
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:49.440]  You're adding wood and it keeps it burning and it keeps it hot and it
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:50.440]  keeps it going.
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:53.440]  And then you throw these other things on it and,
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:54.440]  you know,
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:55.640]  sure they work,
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:56.640]  you know,
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:58.640]  you burn stuff down with gasoline,
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:54:59.640]  but yeah,
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:01.640]  that's my take on it.
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:02.640]  Layton,
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:06.640]  I think you probably have something to say on that brother.
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:08.640]  Oat flour was a gold bar,
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:10.640]  fucking gold bar.
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:11.640]  Better yet,
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:17.640]  put it in one of those brew bags and that will prevent the hyphae from
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.640]  breaking off.
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:20.640]  So it gives them a chance to,
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:22.640]  to be exposed to the oxygen,
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:25.840]  have the substrate to colonize and grow out on,
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:29.840]  but they're not going to get ripped off by the agitation during the bubble
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:30.840]  bubbling process.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:31.840]  As far as molasses,
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:32.840]  generally speaking,
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:33.840]  yes,
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  molasses is a good bacterial as well as fungal food.
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:38.840]  It doesn't grow protozoa.
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:40.840]  Protozoa only divide when they're eating,
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:43.840]  when they're in a feeding frenzy and there's so much,
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:46.840]  we call it a target rich environment.
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:47.840]  There's so much bacteria around,
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:48.840]  they're eating and eating,
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:49.840]  eating,
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:50.840]  they start dividing.
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.040]  And that's how,
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:56.040]  that's why molasses works is because you're growing out the bacteria to a
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:00.040]  point where there's so much that the protozoa just start dividing as fast as
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.040]  they can.
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:04.040]  That division doesn't start to happen till hour 22 to 12,
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:05.040]  24.
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:09.040]  But if you go over 30 and you don't apply it,
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:11.040]  then you're going to start going the other way.
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:12.040]  Just like she said,
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  it explodes and then it crashes.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:15.040]  So be very,
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:17.040]  very careful with molasses,
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.040]  no more than one ounce per 20 gallons,
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:21.240]  and you're going to ask for more problems,
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:22.240]  bigger fires,
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:23.240]  atomic fires.
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:25.240]  That's my two cents.
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:26.240]  Okay.
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  Well,
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:28.240]  let's jump into frass.
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:32.240]  Are most frasses the same?
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.240]  Not all frasses are created equal.
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:37.240]  No.
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:38.240]  So there's different.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:40.240]  So frass is just the poop,
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:41.240]  right?
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:42.240]  It's insect poop.
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:43.240]  So black soda,
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:44.240]  phylloarva,
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:45.240]  how do you know that?
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:46.440]  It's like poop.
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.440]  So black soda,
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:51.440]  phylloarva have a particular kind of frass mealworms have a
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:53.440]  particular kind of frass.
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:57.440]  Beetles have a particular kind of frass and they are all
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.440]  different.
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.440]  I can't really speak to like which one's better.
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:03.440]  Maybe,
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.440]  maybe you have something to say about that.
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:10.440]  I think that I think that generally speaking,
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:14.440]  soldier flies were considered to be the silver bullet.
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:15.640]  So to say in,
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:19.640]  in feeds and therefore the same with soil because they had a
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:20.640]  really,
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:24.640]  really high protein content and a complex profile of other
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:25.640]  components.
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:26.640]  So say compounds.
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:27.640]  So I,
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:28.640]  you know,
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:29.640]  again,
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:33.640]  I don't have a solid hard answer on that or any proof,
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:36.640]  but at least in the world that I travel,
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:40.640]  soldier flies were considered to be the cream of the crop for
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:42.640]  providing a high value frass.
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:46.840]  Plus they don't stake where if you're using a cricket frass,
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:48.840]  that smells the high heaven.
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:50.840]  So all frasses are not the same.
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:51.840]  And I think the,
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:55.840]  the collective consensus is that paying the extra couple of
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:57:59.840]  dollars for the black soldier fly larvae over the cricket is
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:00.840]  well worth it.
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:01.840]  And,
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:02.840]  you know,
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:04.840]  that brings up a very good point,
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:06.840]  volatile organic compounds.
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:07.840]  So if it smells bad,
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:09.840]  that means you're losing stuff.
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:13.040]  You're gassing off stuff that you don't want to gas off.
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:14.040]  You want to keep it.
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:15.040]  So you,
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.040]  the nose knows,
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:17.040]  listen to the nose.
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:18.040]  Yeah.
[02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:19.040]  Luna,
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:20.040]  you have anything to add?
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:21.040]  Nope.
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:22.040]  Okay.
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:24.040]  We'll jump to the next question then.
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:28.040]  How much diatomaceous earth is really safe per gallon of soil
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:29.040]  approximately?
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:30.040]  Don't use that.
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:31.040]  That's,
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:32.040]  that's an insecticide,
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:33.040]  dude.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:34.040]  That's not good.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.040]  That's going to kill the insect.
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.040]  So don't use the,
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.040]  my time,
[02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:39.040]  diet,
[02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:40.040]  nomist diet to not die.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:41.040]  It's a macious diet.
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:43.040]  Unless you're trying to combat insects.
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:44.040]  Okay.
[02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:45.040]  That's my two cents.
[02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:46.040]  Get the real live.
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:47.040]  Dot.
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:48.040]  Tom's go to fish brew.
[02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:49.040]  Dot.
[02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:50.040]  Com.
[02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:51.040]  Order some bot bold flow and introduce.
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:53.040]  And then when you're done with that,
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:54.040]  you're going to use that.
[02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:55.040]  And I'm not going to use that.
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:56.040]  I'm not going to use that.
[02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:57.040]  I'm going to use the,
[02:58:57.040 --> 02:58:58.040]  the,
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:58:59.040]  the,
[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:00.040]  the,
[02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:01.040]  the,
[02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:02.040]  the,
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:03.040]  the,
[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:04.040]  the,
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:05.040]  the,
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:06.040]  the,
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:07.040]  the,
[02:59:07.040 --> 02:59:08.040]  the,
[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:09.040]  the,
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:10.040]  the,
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:11.040]  the,
[02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:12.040]  the,
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:13.040]  the.
[02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  Life.
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:16.040]  Introduce the life instead of the dad.
[02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:17.040]  Yeah.
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:18.040]  So I don't use diet.
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:19.040]  It's just earth in my soil.
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:20.040]  I have different silica sources.
[02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:21.040]  That I'm using.
[02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:22.040]  So.
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:26.040]  I can't really speak to it.
[02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:27.040]  But yeah,
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:32.040]  I wouldn't use it as a soil and put.
[02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:35.960]  accompanied by like a diverse group of the guanos and stuff.
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:40.080]  And people just don't use they we found better, better sources
[02:59:40.080 --> 02:59:42.600]  than that. So just kind of keep that education moving. Maybe
[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:43.560]  there's a better source.
[02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:49.280]  Yeah. Now, for you, Luna, when you were out in the green heart
[02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:53.240]  house, everybody was noticing just how dense of a canopy you
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:57.080]  had. Are you having any mold problems with it being so thick?
[02:59:57.080 --> 03:00:04.600]  No, I like don't get PM. I'm going to PM in forever. I think
[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:08.240]  maybe it's this, you know, I and this is all speculation, but I
[03:00:08.240 --> 03:00:11.400]  think it's maybe the soil health and the endophytes that are
[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:15.560]  keeping my plants super healthy. But no, I don't. I don't have
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:22.840]  PM. I haven't had PM in years and years and years. Maybe the
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:28.960]  maybe the climate has a lot to do with it, too. But no, I never
[03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:34.120]  get PM. I don't do defoliation. Early on, I'll do defoliation at
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:38.160]  the very end. Because I think that some of the, you know, like
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:41.600]  our, this just kind of pertaining to air circulation,
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:45.440]  you know, to prevent PM. But I don't even do it. You know, like
[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:49.880]  halfway through, I'll do it like the last week, just to get like
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:52.960]  light penetration to the lower buds, because for like
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:56.120]  anthocyanin production and like finishing out like senescence,
[03:00:56.120 --> 03:01:00.600]  right? And if you have a more uniform product, so that there
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:04.480]  isn't a discoloration of variation in color between your
[03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:09.440]  your, your bud. But I feel like those leaves are there for a
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:12.720]  purpose, they serve a function, they are solar panels, and they
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:15.160]  photosynthesize and they communicate with the root zone.
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:18.000]  And that process of being able to communicate with the root
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.400]  zone is imperative in an organic and living soil system.
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:24.520]  I'm sure you can defoliate and ensure your plants will keep
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:30.000]  growing. And, you know, it works, for sure. It's a very
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:34.560]  common practice. But no, I don't do it. But anyway, back to the
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:38.760]  PM thing. No, I don't I don't have PM. And I don't defoliate
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:42.080]  until way late. So yeah.
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:44.760]  Yeah, that's interesting, because I normally do a three
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:49.600]  week trim myself just, you know, to open up for the light to come
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:52.000]  through more. But yeah, I agree with you.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:57.480]  What isn't there a lot of people that also would say Luna that
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:00.920]  the reason for that is you have healthy soil, and you also have
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.680]  excess calcium. So the plant is just she's got all the money,
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:09.760]  all the resources she needs. So she's just out there exercising
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:13.000]  every day eating healthy and her immune system's just on point
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:14.640]  for a variety.
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:18.400]  I'm sure that's a big part of it. You know, like I do soil
[03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  testing, I make sure that everything is in its proper
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:27.280]  ranges. And I'm, you know, I, you know, cannabis is is big on
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:31.080]  calcium, right? Like it loves calcium and calcium synergizes
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:33.280]  with, you know, like, pretty much all the other nutrients,
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:36.520]  all of them, like most of the other nutrients. And so like
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.480]  calcium is so important. And I just like pump my plants with
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:44.320]  calcium all the time. If it if it calls for it. So yeah, I
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:48.920]  So, you know, I could definitely be a reason why, you know,
[03:02:51.040 --> 03:02:52.320]  anything to add, Layton?
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.800]  No, I think that that was very well said. Calcium is one of the
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:04.440]  friendlier elements or minerals in the soil profile and the
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:07.920]  plants if they have excess, they can actually use it and leak it
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:11.440]  out as an exudate to bump things off of cata exchange sites like
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:14.240]  say you want potassium, magnesium, I can use the
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:17.600]  calcium to bump that off and take it back up. So it's a very
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:21.000]  valuable resource and agree, you know, and I think what you said
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.480]  about letting the plant create excess energy by leaving those
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.360]  leaves in play, makes perfect sense to me more exudates in the
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:32.520]  soil, more carbon in the soil, the more the organisms can
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:36.280]  thrive and survive. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I think
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:39.160]  that kind of knocks back the idea you have to all
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:44.680]  Yeah, and that the solar panels and green bringing that energy
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:47.760]  is you're creating more biology both in the plant and in the
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:51.280]  soil. And we all know, it's all about the biology when it comes
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:54.760]  right down to it. Okay, you can't get genetic potential
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:04:01.440]  without biology in the plant and the soil. But we've got over 100
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:05.400]  comments. We got a few questions left, but we I know everybody's
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:08.560]  pretty much rushed for time. Do we have a few more minutes? Or
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:10.280]  you guys want to finish up?
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:14.600]  I'm cool with a rapid fire approach.
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:22.120]  Okay, then we'll try to rapid fire here. What about chelating
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:23.600]  the enzymes?
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:26.880]  The enzymes? What does that mean?
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:30.160]  You don't have to chelate enzymes, you chelate minerals.
[03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:31.080]  Yes.
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:33.040]  So enzymes are already chelated.
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:37.860]  Okay, hold on. My wife's talking. Hold on.
[03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:44.680]  Sorry, I didn't hear some of what you said.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:47.360]  Sorry, my wife was just coming down and saying there's a
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:51.360]  question. John Gillum.
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:56.040]  John Gilligan wants to know from Luna.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.280]  Johnny.
[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:01.840]  Therps versus therps. How do you know?
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:05.000]  Oh, what a motherfucker.
[03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:09.920]  Oh, it's somebody you know, obviously, Luna.
[03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:12.040]  That must be an inside joke.
[03:05:13.960 --> 03:05:15.400]  Yeah, yeah. So
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.000]  what was the question?
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:25.440]  We're always with Johnny's doing a podcast or whatever. We mess
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:29.720]  with each other. We misspelled therp and say therp. And a lot
[03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:32.320]  of the time, we'll just say therp on each other's content on
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:35.440]  the internet just kind of randomly. And we like, maybe you
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:39.640]  should, you know, increase your terps by adding therps or therps
[03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:43.480]  equal terps. And we're talking about therps. It's a joke. It's
[03:05:43.480 --> 03:05:44.240]  an inside joke.
[03:05:44.840 --> 03:05:49.960]  That's kind of like the hops Layton viroid. Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:50.040 --> 03:05:52.280]  Instead of that. Yeah, sorry, Layton. I had to.
[03:05:55.800 --> 03:06:00.160]  All right, rapid fire here. Let's go. What did she say about
[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:01.440]  pumpkin seeds?
[03:06:02.280 --> 03:06:04.840]  Oh, I didn't I didn't say anything about pumpkin seeds. Um,
[03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:08.600]  but that's a great idea. Use pumpkin seeds. You got pumpkins
[03:06:08.600 --> 03:06:10.280]  grown? Use pumpkin seeds.
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:17.800]  Okay, now next one does refining the teas help to populate it?
[03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:20.920]  I don't know what that means.
[03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:25.520]  I'm not sure what that question means. What that question I
[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:26.120]  don't understand.
[03:06:26.840 --> 03:06:30.520]  Yeah, I would say make, make making your teas and then you
[03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:33.440]  take it to a different process altogether is what I would
[03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:33.920]  think.
[03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:38.240]  I don't know if you're refining your teas, I would think where
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:41.720]  Luna was getting to is some of the old science was all saying
[03:06:41.720 --> 03:06:45.160]  you get unsulfured blackstrap molasses and all this kind of
[03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:48.720]  stuff. So if you're refining everything, then she she gave
[03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:49.480]  you that answer.
[03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:54.480]  Okay. Thank you, Brian. Sorry.
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:00.280]  What IPM does she use k nf inputs?
[03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:07.440]  I do not use k nf inputs for IPM. I use predatory mites for
[03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:13.520]  IPM. And if I have to, I will use a white stylet oil.
[03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:19.640]  Okay, late in this one's for you, my friend. I want to know
[03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:23.320]  what Leighton thinks about the research Dr. Christine Jones
[03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:23.960]  has done.
[03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:28.680]  You know, she recently I someone else hit me up about her too. I
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:32.160]  haven't I haven't chased that one yet. I just been so friggin
[03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:34.720]  busy right now. You guys. I have not been able to keep up with
[03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:38.920]  the research that I want to do right now. But I she's crossed
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:42.080]  my desk a couple times now. So I will get get on that.
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:48.440]  Okay, next one is what is the difference between your method
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:53.320]  of building soil and coots? Just basically percentages? Let's
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:54.920]  talk, Natalie.
[03:07:55.920 --> 03:08:02.200]  So I really like coots mix or coots blend. I forget what it's
[03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:05.680]  called. I really like Clackamas coot. I actually was on a
[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:12.480]  podcast with him on the growing with fishes. What is the
[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:18.760]  difference? They're similar. He likes using barley as like an
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:22.960]  enzyme source. My this particular soil that I'm using
[03:08:23.240 --> 03:08:26.800]  was built to be really low in nitrogen. There was like no
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:30.720]  nitrogen inputs at all when it was mixed. And then it's then I
[03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:35.360]  add amino acids as the nitrogen source, because amino acids are
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:41.160]  so like, crucial for the forming of organic acids and vital
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:47.160]  vital hormones, their amino acid conjugates. And so my approach
[03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:52.000]  is low nitrogen keeps your temps down maximizes your diversity,
[03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:56.560]  and then introducing a full profile of amino acids to then
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:59.680]  allow for all these other organic acids and vital
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:04.080]  compounds to be created within the soil. Whether or not that's
[03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:07.240]  actually happening, I would really have to have to have to
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:10.960]  do a lot of like research and testing on the soil. But it
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:14.960]  makes sense to me. And that's, that's kind of the approach that
[03:09:14.960 --> 03:09:19.920]  I'm taking. So I know that he has more nitrogen, and he's
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:24.560]  using barley as a input, but he is a very, it's like very high
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:30.640]  in, I think it is name seed meal and kelp is a little different.
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:35.600]  It's definitely a little different. My soil is is mostly
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:42.040]  ocean byproducts. And that was just kind of that was Tim's idea
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:45.520]  actually, but it's based on the idea that they have low
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:48.640]  footprint on like the environment. So it's a very
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:53.040]  like, ecologically friendly mix that uses a lot of insect stuff
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.200]  and it uses a lot of ocean waste x. So, and no guanos,
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:01.360]  there's no manures or guanos in it at all.
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:08.560]  Okay, Leighton, you have something? No, you just muted
[03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:10.000]  yourself. You were already off mute.
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:15.440]  Go figure. So yeah, what she's doing is would be called a very
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:21.120]  slow release and, and coots is a faster release. And he's got
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:26.080]  more available where hers has to be mine. I think that would be
[03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:28.320]  the difference. Short, short.
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:34.640]  So the last question, Sean Walton's looking at getting into
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:37.600]  doing ferments and he wants to know so I know you're a
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:41.040]  doing ferments and he wants to know so I need to consider using
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:45.040]  an aquarium air pump. If I'm going to begin experimenting
[03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:46.880]  making ferments in my backyard.
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:53.200]  ferments are done in a digestion. They're not brewing.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.040]  So no air pump necessary. You want to say on that?
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:04.960]  Yeah, yeah, for sure. So a ferment is a breakdown with
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:07.840]  biology, a breakdown of something with biology.
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:14.800]  Most ferments are anaerobic. So there's introducing lactobacillus
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.320]  or doing an osmotic ferment with like brown sugar or salt.
[03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:24.240]  There's also enzymatic breakdowns which people call ferments are
[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:28.080]  technically not. But most of the time enzyme sources have biology
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:29.440]  in them and will ferment them.
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:37.280]  So no, you can make a lactobacillus serum and add a food source
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:40.640]  and then introduce your organic matter and if your organic matter
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:43.520]  is rich in a food source and that's just it and you let it go
[03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:47.520]  for like three weeks or so and you pH it and if it's around three
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:50.080]  five then it's ready to use and people usually use it between
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:56.640]  one to 1000 and one to 100 for their their dilution rate
[03:11:56.880 --> 03:11:58.720]  dilution rate their application rate.
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:04.320]  Compostees are so what you're referring to is like do I need an
[03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:10.080]  air pump to make a compostee? You need to figure out how much
[03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:12.560]  water you're aerating and how much air that you need.
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:17.520]  And that information is online. I don't want to get too into that.
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:23.520]  But so an aquarium pump sure you can use an aquarium pump.
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:28.480]  They sell there's I think it's called Ecogen. They have or Eco something
[03:12:28.480 --> 03:12:33.840]  they have they have pumps. Just look into different ways of making
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:36.160]  compostees because I'm pretty sure that's what you're talking about
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:40.960]  is making a compostee which I consider to be aerobic fermentation.
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:48.880]  But yeah so if you would like to make compostees you will need an
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:55.840]  air pump and a way to agitate it effectively and uniformly so that
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:58.960]  there's no sediment sediment. But if you're talking about doing
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:04.320]  anaerobic fermentation then no you don't. You put it in a bucket and you
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:09.360]  seal it and you have a little water valve on it or airlock and it bubbles
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:14.640]  when it off gases because it'll create CO2. And if you don't have that it'll
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:21.520]  explode. So yeah. Yeah you don't want them to explode. They're rather messy.
[03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:24.640]  Yeah especially if you're using like a car boy.
[03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:27.440]  Yeah. What'd you say?
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:31.920]  I said and smelly. Hard to clean up.
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:37.760]  Well it's like a massive worm exodus from your worm bin. It's nasty and
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:39.360]  smelly and you just don't want it to happen.
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:40.420]  No.
[03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:46.480]  Okay there was still a bunch more questions. There was over 120 comments while I was just
[03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:52.160]  stuck on the questions. But I think everybody pretty much is done. I can see Paul is going,
[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:53.600]  Dad I need a walk.
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:14:00.720]  Yeah he's ready. He's ready big time. And I got to boot it back to a job so I got days hardly over
[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:06.880]  yet. So Lorna thank you so much for sharing all your knowledge coming on here for three hours.
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:07.600]  So appreciate it.
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:08.080]  Thank you so much.
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:10.560]  For having me on this was a blast.
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:12.880]  I'm nervous for being a co-host. Thank you guys.
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:17.840]  Yeah. Yeah thank you so much Ken and Brian and Layton.
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:24.560]  Yeah Lorna I wanted to thank you. You know not only did you come on obviously for the three hours
[03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:30.080]  but you're taking the time to break things down so that people understand it. You know
[03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:34.800]  Layton and I have been doing the show almost weekly for two years straight. And not everybody
[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:40.640]  that comes on takes it to where it's like OK I understand the topic and I'm trying to get across
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:46.880]  as best I can so that everybody understands it. And the way that you were able to articulate
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:48.640]  stuff today should be commended.
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:51.600]  Thanks man. I appreciate it.
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:59.680]  Yeah you're absolutely amazing. Thank you so much for your knowledge. You shared stuff that I
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:05.760]  I've thought about but never gotten into and you articulated it so well that I'm going to have to
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:11.520]  meditate for at least an hour just to to ingest everything that you were talking about. I know
[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:16.000]  Layton feels the same way because wow that's all I can say is wow.
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:17.600]  Yeah great job.
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:20.240]  I'm so thank you so much. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it.
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:23.680]  I really appreciate it and I had a great time talking to everybody.
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:25.280]  So thank you so much.
[03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:27.520]  Guys we'll have to spend more time geeking out won't we?
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:30.960]  Yeah I'm into it. I'm into it. Sounds good.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:35.600]  OK guys with that I'm going to end the show so everybody can go pee.
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:38.880]  All right guys. Bye.
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:40.080]  Take care.
