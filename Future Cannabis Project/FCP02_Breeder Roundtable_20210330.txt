top floor genetics is in the house it is yeah I guess like eight hours ahead or
something like that and the British Isles the other way yeah I love no
matter when we go live it's like some people are going to bed some people are
drinking their morning coffee you know oh that reminds me coffee yeah I can't
do coffee at night I'm drinking coffee all the time man I if I don't have
caffeine I can't function this is the only thing the Hawaiian crew sent me
some coffee that I've been drinking for the past week which is delicious oh yeah
they got some bomb coffee over Hawaii yeah yeah zero sleeping schedule so blue
you want to jump on with us no people were awake and Baha Bahman we're just
gonna shoot the shit I can't never seen the chat on my phone that's what sucks
toad are you in the studio yeah if I can pull the chat up but then I can't see
the see what's going on here but that's alright let's see here we go top floor
blue green tech what's up brother how you doing well a blue blue can jump on
for a minute yeah man anytime I'm down to share time with blue Steve just don't
ask me to drop no DJ and the shit cuz then I gotta go I just can't hang yeah
potence I will send you my address 179 so she'll give away a pack of seeds if
they can name the four golden girls the first one give the first name of the
real golden girls come on there's blue oh my god wait are you in this studio oh
yeah oh yeah is that like every not ground full beans there we go how you
doing brother killing toad was good not the much man just sitting here chilling
out man waiting to share some time with somebody so what do you what uh what's
what'd you decide on for this season for the outdoor season who me yeah 25
spooky times SBR or sorry SBR Tom spooky so let me get it correct which is my
cult of our times bluegrass green thumbs it's a can of tonic and Skywalker og and
I think that's one more thing in the mix in there crossing my hazy ass SBR
and after that I the shout to the homie bubble hash he hit me up with some
Zoria which is that's female skunk Mexican female skunk Pedro yeah yeah
yeah he hit me with that skunk and I popped like six of those Kaia sent me
some beans and I didn't have the best luck with the germ but I have a little
bit of coffee cubed and a little bit of Matterhorn and the homie Tyler from
family tree seed sent me some avocado ice cream only got one of those that was
the end of the line man those things didn't want to pop but I got one of them
and then I went back to the drawing board and I threw in some dirty
Starbucks s1 which is Kaia's coffee crossed with chem DD I think that's a
lemon hoco shout out and then beyond that I think the last thing I threw in
was my emerald X which I baked in 2017 and I got 10 for 10 on those so it's on
man we have a good little little stable to rock with that's satisfying yeah it
feels good but I was going on with you guys tonight who knows I got a two-year
old to put to sleep in about ten minutes but actually Tyler I think is gonna jump
on he's putting his kids to sleep and I think Trevor is putting his kids to
sleep all right I assume your kids are already asleep given that it's after
midnight I am emancipated tonight for sure so you you guys go in the studio
every every Monday night yeah I like the the persistence the consistency yeah
consistency that's the word seven nights a week but you know it's life doesn't
allow for that but yeah we get in here as much as we can for sure we're working
on about three projects right now yeah it takes as much of our time as we can
allow there we're having a great time tonight we we knocked out one one full
joint tonight for a project we're working on so we feel good if we get one
thing done even if we get something partially done we feel good I mean it's
kind of like when you're in the garden and you you know you might get half the
work done but half the works done so what uh what like whoever is recording
everything what audio software are they using the pro tools pro tools okay
Pro Tools HD yes indeed absolutely can we hear a beat can we hear a taste of
something sample of what we just did tonight yeah yeah we'll play for you and
by the way rest in peace to MF doom I think that this song undoubtedly was
was influenced by him I mean we never ever bite you only borrow you know hey
can't have hip-hop without some sample son that's how it's done
say again yeah I said you can't have hip-hop without samples man that's how
it's done
I'm a man with a million fortune, something orderly, proportions, no time for feelings of importance
If I got countless millions, it would be the virtual villains
I'll call James, subservient suburban men, ain't got nothing to be sneeze
Just house cats from the victims of the mousetrap
I hit my lights out of that, to count the peas knees
Why you look at me, Lord did I do that? Please freeze
No for hitting the toes, for being out there going back and back, going fast, crack, go
I hate how you're the lost hoe, doing my own thing, going a different path
I've had you for the last five, been a while since I was asked for autographs
On the map, how I continue to call the facts
I said I look, but it's got flash, I'm a crack, a long, long sash
Like a long hash, I call the class, I'm a bastard, you're looking at the wrong traffic
Don't be a flash, ain't nothing on track
I'm a character, but a non-actor, I'm a blaster, a star-crusher, and a stellar, long-cap
There it is
That's what it was
On some spaced out shit tonight man
And what are we smoking in the studio tonight?
Oh man, we aligned that shit perfectly, it's not like we didn't think about that
I thought about that more than I thought about the verse
My man A right now is growing a little bit of the SBR spookies
Don't tell nobody, but he's got a beautiful pheno with that going right now
So I have a little bit of finished flower, I brought that up for us to test out first
And that was a nice
Stegway joint, and then we did the Mac V2
The Mac V2 is freshly cured and that shit is venomously poisonous
It's crazy right now, so yeah
Mac V2 for the second punch, we smoked two J's of that right before we did the verses
And Potenponics pointed out that MF Doom is, I think his dad's from Zimbabwe
I think he's a Zimbabwe Trinidadian cross
Yeah I'm on, I've got some close family from Trinidad
So all respect due to the West Indies, definitely
My best friend from college is from Trinidad
And his dad always grows scotch bonnets
And he's got a really nice beard
His dad always grows scotch bonnets in their backyard
And that is some hot shit
Some potent stuff
Yeah when I lived in Brooklyn we lived in Crown Heights and that's the Trini neighborhood
And the roti was definitely fucking fat
And the asses were fat and the peppers were hot
Yeah, love my fucking West Indian people, definitely
But yeah, Doomail for life
Now the beat just inspired us by the MF Doom Bob
We would love to hear him rom on that type of shit
We don't rom like him, but we'll throw the references in
To make it a peace offering so to speak
So what, since we have Tyler the other
We got two Tylers in the house
But what of his are you testing out?
Pop the avocado ice cream
One strong contender right there
I'm excited to get that line off the ground again
As far as I have a bunch of stuff in the stash
But I just don't even know where to begin, we need to have some more personal conversation
So I can fit it to what I'm looking for
I know I got some bacon grease and some crazy Pam crosses
And some other things that he graciously sent me
Much love man, appreciate all that
There's some serious hidden secrets in there
Especially that grease and that Pam shit
Everybody always gets around to that, but when you get around to it, you get around to it
I hope that avocado ice cream you can pull something special out of there
Like I said, that's a little deadline, but that would be cool
If the avocado man could find some avocado in there
I'll open up the fridge too
I'll send you all the stuff that I got on that one
We'll give that one 100% over
Like I said, I feel like seed popping is all meant to be
If the shit doesn't pop for you, no matter what the cause
The illest collections and the best thing that's ever happened to me in life
Has always been a crap shoot
I'm a full believer, I'm never questioning what pops and what does not
That's just how it's meant to be
What's that?
I'm smoking that
This thing that Josh gave me
It's a Hollywood PK to the
Limevine Testerosa or something
I just harvested that
PK to that and got this hairspray
First night I'm smoking it
Just opened up the jar
I'm tasting it today
Friggin' hairspray and herbs
That's some good shit right there
That's good shit
PK Limevine Testerosa
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And what I'm smoking is I'm smoking some Space Cheese
This is my Space Cheese number four that I'm smoking right now
I've been pulling nugs out of the room and hand trimming them
So this is, I showed this yesterday when I was on my live video
I hand trimmed this bud in front of everybody
So this is one of the nugs from the number four pheno that's
I sent Peter some photos when he comes back
He can show them up there
It was a cross, the blue cheese mom that I used was a cross made here locally
By one of the patients that was in my collective
I used to manage a collective between 08 and 2012
So the last year I was there this guy was moving one of the patients
He asked me to take one of the cuts
I was gonna come pick it back up, he never came back for it
So I used that thing to do some cross
I made Space Cheese out of that, crossing it to my Angel mail
I made that days ago, I made that
08, I believe I made that when he first gave it to me
That cat never came back, so I used that in my Angel back cross
Number two
I'm gonna be cutting it out now again, I'm about to whip out that Space Cheese on everybody once again
She tastes like
She tastes like Parmesan and pepper with a little bit of mint on it
And a fermented grape from the Space Cheese side, she's complex
Grown real white though man, she's on par with the cheesy flavor from that UK cut
Her grandma man, we used to grow her
Me and the Ross homies that were here, I used to rent my house to some Ross
And I used to have a house for me, so I let him grow my cheese here
And they used to have an out for that stuff
And they'd grow this right next to the UK cheese
And they could put it in the same bag and no one would know the difference except for the density of this
This is a lot more dense than the cheese
Just from the Angel side, but on the Terpene profile, it comes across a lot like cheese man
It just, it depends on the input you're gonna get
It just, it depends on the input you're gonna get
On the organic side, she's gonna put a lot more grease on
That funky fermented side of the cheese and the grapes comes through
Instead of pushing some of that backside of the blueberry that might pop through
On synthetics, because people like putting sweeteners on them that'll fuckin' sweeten everything
So like you can make any kind of herb taste like the sweetener you're throwing at it
On the synthetic side, you start just dumping that shit on there too much
And you don't have enough time to just use it up in the system
You end up with them cushy cush tasting buzz and shit that tastes like nasty
And I'm telling you, nothing nice about that
But growing organically, this plant is killer
The last time I shared it with anyone in the public was 2015 when I took it to the Emerald Cup
And people were enjoying it man
They liked it
I got that fuckin' cheese line down here that I used to love
I didn't like it at first, it took me like 2 or 3 times calling the guy
I'm like, hey man, I need a bag, you know
I got the cheese, I forget what they call it, the chili or the cheese
Or the cheddar or some shit like that
But I'm like, no I don't want that cheese shit, and he's like, that's what I got
Like 3 times in a row, we're like little kids, we got work to go
That 4th time I was like, wow I actually kinda like this cheese
And the next phone call I was like, hey you got any more of that cheese
It's got a killer ass high man, this stuff gets me ripped
After that, I really dug it, I grew some
Stuff that we call chili cheese
The chili cheese from Chili Verde
With the F2 Eric H&A
Of the random cheese that he was playing with
I popped some of those
And man, they're tight spears, really good tight super nice
Fucking speared plants, you know
That cheesy chili cheese, and that brought me back
I really enjoyed those
Alright, here we go
Kim D
Triangle
Corey Stardog
Kim D
Space Cheese Pheno 2
What that again?
I said, did that D have the variegation pop through
Is it like always kind of there
It's always there, but the more you pile on the macronutrients
The more it starts to fade away
She's gonna need amino acids
That's what's part of the problem there
It's a raised bed that I put in there, it's got a pond liner
To keep it waterproof, because I don't want it leaking all over the place
And I had to treat it, because I couldn't fucking get redwood at the time
Because either I can't afford it, or they ain't got that shit no where locally for a handicapped cat
That can put it in his fucking car no where, right?
And I can't use my tools no more in my position, right now, not safely
So I just had to buy something that would work
So I take the pond liner and put it in there, it's filled with 2 inches of just pure coconut fiber
And then I take an irrigation pipe that's got about 200 holes, 2 inch holes drilled in that sucker everywhere
And then I take a layer of amino acids
That's a Thrive-In, it's a soybean complex amino acid
Actually Thrive-In is the fish, I ran out of the soybean
I prefer to have something like a Brandon Russ's stuff
The amino acid complexes that he has would have been much better
So I lay that amino acid complex down
With some barley, fermented barley
Barley that they use from like brewers and shit
Brewers barley that's been spent, I got like a 5 gallon bucket of that stuff
And then I take some kashi, put a kashi blend on top of that
And on top of the kashi blend I sprinkle in some macro and micro nutrients
So that I can make my own, it's my own DDA soil mix
But this one's a non-cook version so I don't have to
Actually literally cook it, I just put it in there
So there's no amendments in there that are gonna get hot
That thing can be planted instantly
And then on top of that I put a base soil that I've already got going here
And then I put my plant straight on top of there
So what's happened is as soon as that chem D hit that amino acid layer
It started bouncing right out of that variegation
So if you see her right now in the mother tin I got behind me
I've got more of a variegation to her because she's starting to lose out on the
Amino acid complexes that are in there, I need to add some more
I need to actually put another mom in there is what I need to do
I don't have a big space for my moms at the moment
So on a small scale they burn out quick, when you can put them in a larger scale that plant will come out of it
And she'll look like a completely different cutting, she'll even clone differently
She's just gonna react completely differently, indoor without a good amount of
Like I said iron, magnesium, amino acids
She starts to get weak, her stems don't get as turgid
She doesn't like to pray almost at all, she always looks like she's been over watered
She just starts going through troubles like chem D
Her sisters, the chem 4 and the chem 91, they don't have that problem
They easily can handle going with a little extra water
Or being light on, especially the amino acids, when you get the amino acids going in there
Those ones like to show that, what looks like that burn on the edges
Looks like you get a real fucking hot, like it might have got too hot
Or you overdid the nitrogen, it's actually kind of part of that amino acid
Variegation that they're showing, but the D just shows it all over the plant
It's crazy
that some of the dog walker
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
um
Yeah, well-deserved vacations
What were you guys talking about I got a link and I figured I'd hop on here for a second
You still got the Sun's standing right there out there sitting on the sitting right at sea level
You know, so that's a Sun behind you. So that still got light
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, a little bit well. He's what is it a 730 right?
630 over here. I was three out all right
So mr.. Toad was you were just talking
aminos and
Yeah, amino complexes in the bed that helps that Kim D
Come out of the variegation that she likes to show along with some other micro elements that usually aren't available
immediately when you're in an organic garden unless you're putting something like you know an enzyme in there or especially those
Like I said with Brandon's product the soybean
That amino complex that stuff makes an available nitrogen. That's not gonna burn your plant it starts building cells immediately
It helps with protein synthesis and every part of the plant like it's something
I like putting on my plants when I'm taking cuttings for my mom's like seven days before I'm about to take cuttings
I'll only spray with that
I'll keep it every time I'm on a transplant
I need a layer that just below where the roots are gonna hit so as soon as they put some fresh ones out
It starts building brand new tissue everywhere not just in the top of the foliar area wherever spraying now
it's gonna build it also in the
And everywhere
It's just kill a part of the plant a lot of people kind of skimp out on when they're building organics
They're gonna they figure their cover crops gonna just take care of it by itself or something and it can
But if you're starting with like a bag soil out there and you're relying on like the cover crop you just planted right now
It's not gonna be available when your plants growing. It's a short-term plant right now that we're messing with
Okay, so so here's a really interesting thing
If your soil is deficient in nitrogen the plant will release
potentially up to 15% of its metabolic energy through
photosynthase
as an exudate to sustain a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing either rhizome
Bacteria or free living soil microbes that fix atmospheric nitrogen
So
If you're deficient in nitrogen the plant will
Spend energy and then it still has to convert that said nitrogen into proteins which can take up to another
18% so we're talking about when you're using amino acid nitrogen
amino acid amino
proteins what what's happening is you could be potentially saving up the
Saving up the 33% of that energy because the plant will not have to release
photosynthase to try to sustain
Relationships that aren't needed the plant really only does this when it needs?
Certain things it also does this thing with like iron reductase also with
Foss phosphate a's
so
With the amino acids because L chain aminos are available at the root zone
What happens is it conserves energy because it doesn't have to turn the nitrogen into
Amino acids right? It's already amino acid and the whole purpose of nitrogen
one of the main things is the
proteins and but it takes energy to
One accumulate the nitrogen and then convert that nitrogen through these different biosynthetic pathways
Into the proteins, you know, because that's really what the plant wants. It's building things like lignin cell walls and
It needs those proteins to do so
the amino acids are essentially a biohack and
What it what they offer is they offer those those
Proteins and then what the plant can do is they can catabolize these and they can break these down
When they have them stored up in the leaf tissue themselves and what that also does is it offers a type of energy?
Release it offers a certain amount of ATP adenine triphosphate
Which is the energy exchange currency for all biological cellular mechanics
so
What will happen is the plant can utilize these amino acids really really quickly. They'll absorb them into the roots
They'll store them in the tissue themselves without burning right because it's not it's it's complexed
So it doesn't burn the material right? It's not nitrite. It's not ammonium
Then if your plant gets low it can it can delve into those reserves and not only is it getting the nitrogen
But as it catabolizes those those aminos and those proteins, it's also releasing more more energy
Yes, sir
nice
beautiful information
You know doing it, you know with the you know, so
Kim cuts old as hell man
That Kim cuts 31 years old now, so if she's by now
She's been through so many people's hands and treated like a beast that
She she's feeling to be put into a system that lets her recognize the soil
It's like a person that's been wearing boots for too damn long that finally takes the shoes off and can feel the signals from the
Soil and shit. She's relearning shit that she forgot man
That's kind of how I look at her way when I'm telling you when you put her into a killer organic system
Responds completely different than when she's growing synthetically, and I'm not talking about like the size of the flower or anything
But like the way she clones how fast she
Starts to build brand new tissue
I mean the plant she doesn't look like being stressed to death when you put her into an organic system that that plant right there
Shows it completely that the fire OG does the same thing you put that plant into a killer organic system
And it stops throwing those three fingered leaves all the time on you
It begins the root much easier. It'll start throwing fives and sevens all day long
It looks like a completely different plant it
Start to shorten up its inner nodes because of the fact that the tissues becomes more turgid it's spending less time
Just build an old pithy ass wood and the plant looks completely different
I held that plant for a long ass time and to be able to see that thing go through different
Systems and in different hands with people that grew it
It's crazy you'd go into one person's garden and swear that person had some other shit man
But you'd know they got no other way to get a connect
They don't know shit about nothing and you know, they're growing the plant you gave them and you're like, what did you do man?
What the fuck is going on here, dude? I seen it every time
Years
One of the biggest things I that I see
In organic production is the the lack of potassium
I see that across the board usually even with
Like when I'm taking tests from people doing consulting
it's really hard for
For potassium to become bio it's it doesn't cycle very easily
Biologically, it takes a lot more time than other other mineral nutrients
so one of the things that I see that
greatly greatly greatly
Especially, you know in flower improves a lot of like home growers and across the board commercial cultivators is
Being able to put push the potassium a little bit harder using something like potassium sulfate works. Just amazing
To really help I think mitigate some of those issues especially seeing like purple stems
Yeah, I see a lot of people have the striping stems and a lot of times people say oh, it's genetics and stuff
But I I can take something that's like that and put it in a system
Give it, you know the proper nutritional content and those things just they disappear completely
Treat them more like they're almost being you're breeding out with the plant instead of just pushing flowers because what when you're breeding
You're producing see the seeds of potassium sink in sense
so the fact that you need to maintain the amount of potassium throughout to grow if
People that were farming for
Trichomes instead of just the size of buds because that's all they're seeing is how big a bud is if they start trying to
Produce a plant that's as healthy as possible
There's gonna get a better plant and exactly where you're saying potassium is a much-needed
They start pushing that phosphorus too high the potassium locks out
I think saying you know magnesium calcium starts slipping away and the plant starts doing the nosedive that they're trying to in
Organics what happens is they try to use a tea or a top dress or something else to fix that and it's not available
fast enough
Or they need to start to spray that plant in a foliar to get any kind of reaction out of it once that starts
Nosedive and like that it happens happens quite a bit
And once you start hitting a wall on one of those either too much or too little
You're gonna start getting a problems in the other
in the other
Nutrients that that plant needs and if you're in it with a plant that's extremely finicky with what it needs already
That you're gonna have troubles
And they put that on top of the fact that most of the people out here gardening
When they're not doing it on a commercial level probably got five or six different lines in the in their room growing
So they all need different nutrients
They only have different water levels and they're they got a plant nosedive in there treating them all the same
Then they start spending too much time on this one and the rest of them start nose diving
It comes down not to having enough knowledge base to be able to spread it all the way around
You know and I think one of the biggest
drawbacks with using teas and top dresses is a lot of people use things you
instead of like single mineral
Mineral input you can target what what needs what needs it and if you add something like compost teas
It's not necessarily balanced unless you know that these things these mineral top dresses or whatever you're doing is
Balanced and that's exactly what your soil needs a lot of times
It's just a guessing game, you know, because if let's say let's say you your magnesium is too high
Right and you start making up, you know, but you but you're all but your potassium is low and you're like well
I'm gonna use some compost. I'll make a compost tea, but that compost tea is really high in magnesium
Already. Yeah, it has the you know a good amount of potassium in it
But what ends up happening is you you start pushing those things further out of balance. So you add that magnesium
More magnesium and even though you had an adequate amount of potassium
It's gonna lock that out because you already had too much in the soil to begin with
so there's different things that happen that you have to be aware of that are antagonistic to each other and
Magnesium is really high density
A
Charged molecule and so it can lock out, you know a lot of the other cations
Causing a season
My
My Korean natural farming calcium instead of the old cow mag so that I didn't bring along the magnesium, you know
You didn't want it, you know, so I said yeah, that's pretty
That's pretty cool. I also noticed like the more LEDs and stuff with
with the striping of the of the branches and the stocks and stems and stuff and
Regardless of the temperature something like that with the LED spectrum. I definitely see more purple stems and stuff
You know throughout there, I don't know if they're using more potassium or yeah
I think yeah, I've noticed that
Yeah, that's that's something that I hear from a lot of people who switch from
HID lighting to LED and again, I think that's due to the plants
That you know the plant will
Lighting, you know, you you know, if you take a plant and grow
Different than if you grow it out in the full Sun
Again it's about pushing that potassium but also, you know having balanced balanced nutrition is really the key
not just oil but
health in general
You guys soon when I get back to the mainland
Sounds good. Enjoy the Hawaiian life. So up he just left. It's just the two of us
Mr. Toad one MIA. Oh there is back look who's back and everybody's muted. Let me unmute you are I can't unmute. Mr
Toad he's muted himself. He's back
It's funny so Charles Freeman pointed out
Is that one of the by the way the I my orange hookup is Tyler
We got these are the Washington ables that are just coming on I'm just starting to
Pack up boxes of this stuff. So toes getting one you're gonna get one
My boy, my boy Nick's gonna get one and you know, maybe if they can go far enough
Maybe Josh will get one up there
This is the time this is the time where they're coming off. They're coming off sweet. They're coming off ready to roll
You know navels and if you got a tree you don't know what it was or whatever
you always flip that I don't have it now I cut this one to shit, but
At the bottom of the orange, you'll have that opening that little that little you know
Depression or the little thing like the navel the belly button. Yeah. Yeah
So if you flip up an orange, you don't know what kind of orange it is and it's got one of those little
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
The belly button, yeah, yeah
So if you flip up an orange, you don't know what kind of orange it is and it's got one of those things
You got a navel you got there's pink navel. There's Lane late navels watch
There's a thousand different types of navels, you know out there
but at least you know
you have a navel orange and if it doesn't have one of those then you're looking at a Valencia or a
Blood orange or you know some sort of a sour Asian orange or something along those lines
They don't have the navel so you tell a lot just by kind of looking at the fruit on the tree
Tell you
So it's between the two of you purple stems so Charles Freeman who's in the chat
Last week we had someone on who said, you know, if you have purple stems
You need more hummus and now and then he heard Brandon saying you need more potassium
So when you when you guys see purple stems like what's the the caught in the prescript the cause and the prescription
First I step back and look at the whole plant and see what's really going on
Just because it has a purple stem doesn't mean it's lacking in one thing in particular 100%
It's gonna steer you in a direction
But if I start looking at a plant and the plants got purple stems and the top of the plants got bright yellow new growth
There's it's lacking in more than just magnesium. The plant needs iron. It needs magnesium
Now I start looking at the bottom and I start seeing trouble with the edges of the leaves looking like there's spotting
It's got some calcium issues down there. So now what I need to do is look at the pH in the soil
I mean, there's multiple reasons. I need to know if it's a
Synthetic organic I need to know what the base system of the soil was. Did you mix up your own soil?
Is it just a bag so that you bought there's many issues I didn't go there
Then you go to genetics find out what's really in there. There are some lines that do have
dark purple stems, but not striping like I've seen
Jamaican lines that'll show
Like Kool-Aid red stems the whole stem
I've seen mean gene post some of his Afghani lines that have
Straight almost black stems their self and the rest of the plant grows almost yellow and green color
There's but when you got a plant that's usually a real dark green plant and you start seeing that
Issue with the purple stems. There's probably an issue with magnesium. You could have too much or too little
There could be an issue with potassium and one of those two could be locking the other one out
So those are the two places I start going but I start to diagnose that by also looking at the other issues on lower leaves
Middle of the plant or top of the plant. I need to see if I'm seeing
Like white areas between the veins to see if there's a magnesium issue going on
Is that on the lower part of the plant only to know that I have some potassium issues being carried out along with the stem?
Issue and my pile driving too much nitrogen that's causing some of the other
Nitro the other macro and micro elements to lock out for some reason because I'm using a in particular type of nitrogen
Like we were talking about there earlier with the amino based nitrogen
It's not going to burn your plan. It's a complex nitrogen
So you're not getting just one element at a time when you give one element that can off gas
That's when you start getting those burning issues
pH drifts you can start burning out
Populations in the rhizosphere, so you're gonna have trouble with having to repopulate
Where that's what people start using too much teas
waterlogging the soil
When they bring up using humates the humates are gonna work killer because the humates are nature's way of making
enzymes also along with the bacteria
So that's a old organic matter bacteria chew on that shit, and you got yourself a pure
Organic way to create nutrients, so that's why you want to use a humates in there most soils
You're buying a bag don't have any humates
So that's why they're gonna tell you to add some humates in there because I guarantee
Almost any so that someone just put in a pot that they just went to the store and bought is lacking a hundred percent in
humates and clays
Particularly both of those there's gonna be almost none of that shit
even if you've got a
Organic soil that they say on the bag living or otherwise and especially if you're using a soilless medium those things are just coming as an
inert medium
That's basically just giving you a way to hold and store nutrients and moisture for a moment
So you're gonna need to add specific things to that if you're gonna grow in a specific style if you're relying on
Bacteria and fungi to feed your plant instead of just pile driving
Created nutrients then you need to have humates in the soil and available types of organic matter
Just have an organic matter in there isn't gonna make that shit available
Pile driving
Well, that's what
Banging in there your pile driving that shit right in the plant and there's a style you you can grow that way
There's no problem with it, but it's not farming
It's it's a way to produce a product and in a means but you don't understand soil science unless you went to learn that
You don't learn how to grow something else
So you've given a recipe to grow that cultivar that you had so you can produce as a big as much as possible
So you can make the money in the end
That's what old commercial growing was about if you weren't trying to do that with your commercial system
You weren't being efficient with your system and you were cheating yourself or you were cheating the system
actually, not the system but the
The business that you were in be it just yourself or with other people if you're not trying to put out the most back in
The day you weren't getting paid
That's what you were doing it for no one back in the day that was feeding their family and keeping the whole
Damn city alive was doing it based on the smallest more
Tiniest little plant in the corner that had the killer smell and shit
They kept that for their self, but that's why you got big bud and all that other shit out there. That's everywhere
They had to have something that could produce and that's what commercials all about and now we've learned that
We need to produce certain terpenes and cannabinoids efficiently
So that's why we're breeding in those directions to plants that will produce particular amounts of CBD CBG
You know see whatever one of the cannabinoids were after instead of trying to pull it out of
Whatever's out there
We're trying to breed a plant that gives us those ratios in a higher percentage to start with so that we're not just fucking around
With a one-fingered brush and we got every size brush to paint the house
You know for just out there with that little fine brush
We'll be painting a mansion for a muck and year and a half ten fucking way too long way too long
You gotta be efficient my my pam 15 is a you know
I swear like I've been tracing like Pam origins, you know over the years and everything
I swear that she's some sort of a Indian cultivar and the 15 and the f3 and the f4
There's all a lot of those black stem phenotypes that are in there
But if it's just like when when I'm looking and I see a plant that has purple stems
I'm like, oh fuck you're not doing something. You're not doing something for some reason because it's probably fucking cold or
You know, you're wet or you know, some something along those lines
You're it cannot adorb any everything
You can't do what it's supposed to you'll see those purple stands or if a fucking
It's an old mom or a plant has been in a pot for too long
All of a sudden the stems will go woody and turn more purple
You know stop pushing out that nice healthy green or low on fuel, you know a lot of those cases
So man purple stems can can take you down all kinds of different fucking rabbit holes through the gecko, you know
But 90 90 percent of the time you got a problem and it's not genetics
You know what? I mean? And and you can usually eliminate, you know that right out of the gate, you know
stage is build up in
All those things
There's no green if there's you know, it's you got a look at those things transplanting is cold
Wet, you know and you're like those are all leads you right to right the purple stem syndrome, you know
And I mean then you can be no then you can go down all those rabbit holes start fucking, you know
So speaking of genetics
Matthew who's in the chat a while ago. He said he's growing out SF vo G
And he has a lot of Herme issues and wanted to know if that's like to be expected or
Well first I'd ask him on this
Is it the clone or is it from seed because if it's from seed it's from seed
Yeah, then here's what I can say depending on the generation. He got him
There's gonna be issues different issues with those seeds. They could either be what they said. They are they could be
Homophrodite accidents, there was a lot of issues with seeds coming out named SF vo G
I don't want to put no breeders on blast or nothing, but a lot of breeders out here know that
fucking what's like
The place he probably bought those from my buddy was asked to breed for them and he turned him down like he's like now fuck
That find someone else
From Cali connection. Yeah
That plant like if you're are they films or they regs cuz when he you can go on his own website and see this
That he'll tell you that if they're regulars they're bred with to you know, they got a different male for the parent
It's a whole different line then the films which will have something else used as the pollen donor
And then if you if you pay attention on the social media sites, you'll see that people were passing around some of his
His text messages where he was buying seed stock and reselling them with people with the name
So that's why I said you never know what you might be in any case. I mean any case, you know the you know, yo G
Get the that's a hermaphroditic, you know, you know
Genius accident plan of its own, you know what I mean?
So like under stress or under you know
Weird conditions or a little bit too much food a little lightly little funky things
Maybe you get a little you know a little nut or something that to happen
Here there which which is how you know, we got you know, all those all the great stuff
but if it's from seed then
You know that it a SFV o G
It's not it's not that that's not what it is. It's it's a it's a it's a relative of you know
One of those things in whatever
Hermaphroditic trait
There's no bueno and should be you know should be eliminated and should be taken
You know not taking you know, unless it's the best
Friggin smoke you've ever had and it cures your pain like nothing else or
Reason you want to keep it around, you know what I mean? That's you know
It isn't it isn't way, you know, it is, you know in a weird way and it you got a from seed
It's it's a selective herme. So
Either a you you can try to run it again. Sometimes I run things twice
It's like you know is kind of crappy and throws up, you know
A few balls or whatever and I really love it all I'll try to fix everything up perfectly and make sure that you know
I don't have any light leaks. I'm not feeding it to too strongly, you know, there's no no
It's not root bound root bound plants plants that are in too small of a container are like
Almost guaranteed like if you have that in the in the line or it's somewhere, you know anywhere close
You got some sort of a just a flux wish you can you can tip a plant to throw some throw some, you know
Intersect traits with with too small the root zone, you know stressing out at the root zone
So give it an extra space make sure you don't have light leaks, you know, not feeding it with too stuff. It's too strong
Run it you can run it twice if you love it. Love it, but I wouldn't
The root stress exactly is one thing that does it a lot of times on the plant what happens is they get a imbalance of
either
Gerbilic acid or auxins at the root tip which can cause a an issue in the epidural
tissue up in the foliar layer of the plant because you have
Hormones being passed through the phloem and the xylem of the plant along with the exudates that in the system of the plant
So what happened like we've all seen cultivars out there that shown buds right on the leaf
that's called epithelial growth and this is coming from a imbalance of
Oxen and GA3 at the root tips
So that's another thing that happens when you put them in too small of a pot or you let a plant get too old
And it starts getting those real pithy stems where they have too much xylem building up in the center of the plant
It looks all woody and shit. You're getting too much obsessic acid, which is a hormone being
Let me interrupt you real quick like I have a I had an orchard lady
Selection that I made years ago one of my it was a amazing plant man
One of my favorite plants in the world and it was it was in the ground the first time that I ever grew it
You know, I grew up from seed and it was like it was a female
It was put out to the workers and it was it was it was one of those select, you know plants
you know for my smoke that season and I
Was gonna really run it outside to test it to do the stuff and I eventually did some back cross work with with that plant
But that plant was what was throwing those fucking nugs all on the all on the leaf, you know
Pedio and stuff like that
But it was it was in the ground in the most beautiful
Environment possible. It was a praying bitch ass
It was like nothing could be wrong and like I attributed that thing to be like it was just it had no it was going
So hard and so bitching that it had nowhere to put all of its energy
So it just started stacking it in places where it didn't have so I mean
Possibly putting
There was a possibility of you might have been using or in the soil or somewhere available
too much
synthetic oxen's I 3 and shit I be a
3
but what can happen is just
there's a there's too much of a hormone being produced at the root tip at a specific point of flower and
There's a there's a few cultivars out there that I have seen do it more than others, but it's called epithelial growth
I've shown a post on my Instagram about what about like
I've also heard and done some tests also on on different fruit trees and different plants like that of like using excess fucking kelp and
Seaweed and stuff like that
That's the same thing
Kelp is a that's a possibly
Especially if you're just about to go into flower
Flip doing that or you had been building up a lot of kelp up to that like in the early days of organic gardening
everyone was using kelp like with every goddamn watering and
Kelp is a more of a cumulative plant than cannabis is right that thing's gonna suck up
Like if you smoke some cigarettes next to that motherfucking ocean, there's nicotine in that shit, right?
I think sucking up your dirty ass feet when you're in the ocean
Help is kelp is sucking up everything it can get its hands on right so and it's also
Building up every damn plant hormone and copious amounts compared to other plants
And it's doing this because of the speed of which it grows
Right, you can kind of you can kind of judge how much hormones a plant is gonna
Have in its system kind of based on the speed or metabolism of the system of that plant, right?
It's kind of like us if we were bodybuilders
I
Was on a roll
There's a glitch in the matrix
You gotta start from the top
From the top
Hormones
Kelp especially being foliar sprayed is gonna build up too much hormone. So now there's no way with kelp for you to decide how much
Androgynous hormones that you're gonna change up in the plant. So in cannabis androgynous hormones are producing everything we see on that plant
It's producing a twist in the leaf. It's producing the speed of growth that we see it's producing the shape of the plant
It's not all my plants right so I've done some testing things, you know over the years and I've used lots of fucking kelp and
Not kelp and branches and then it so but now that like, you know, like that particular one
You know what? I mean was sensitive to the tipping point, right?
You know, I wonder like, you know
Can I can you push every plant to really start throwing them on on the pet eels like that, you know, I mean
No stone plants are bulletproof, man
Yeah, it comes down to the androgynous hormone levels on which a plant produces naturally so it comes down to let's just pretend like
those plants are
Like triplets or quadruplets, right? We're gonna they all came from the same egg from the same parents and they're identical
But even as identical they they all have some
Allele in that system that's different their glitch in their matrix that we just had here, right?
One of them's got a mold that the other ones don't have one of them's two inches shorter, right?
One of them might have a fucking crooked lip and that's it. That's what's different
But you can tell it no matter what and that's what's coming down to plants, right?
And I'm not saying that it reacting to that trait makes it bad
This is where people that are growing cannabis start thinking of it in a different state like the plants bad because it showed this
Trait in my environment like maybe your environment was bad, right?
Well, I'm just saying this on general like even in my garden
I see a trait that I think's bad from a breeder and then all of a sudden I realize well fuck man
I've seen bad shit in my own stuff. Let me grow this a little longer. Let me clone it. Let me acclimate it
Let me see if it's really happening if it happens and I say the the count of three it has to happen twice
Indoors and once for sure outdoor for that plant to be
Specifically throwing that trait that's happening in the system that you see
So if I see it once indoor
I need to either put it in someone else's garden or set up another one that has a different light
maybe a different fucking by a specific tent just to run that cultivar in one time and
Especially outside because many plants outside aren't going to produce the same hormone levels on an androgynous level, which is the amount they make
Like like what we produce straight out of our mother right without us going to go lift weights without us
Steering our diet in the direction what our body would have naturally produced without us deciding
Well, I'm gonna be a vegetarian or I'm only gonna eat beef
Right those things steer our hormone drive what we produce naturally and that's what's happening
when you start spraying kelp on a plant and now that plant makes a specific ratio of
Either abscisic acid or auctions or ga3 or
Ethylene right especially with ethylene and ga3 is where you're gonna start seeing hormones that affect sexual expression of the plant and where you're gonna
Get homophobites where people say it's the breeder
He didn't stabilize nothing and we're like, did you run it three times and make sure that's what it was
Here's a free pack anyway, but did you do that?
I just want to know you start asking questions and then they don't understand what you're talking to him about and then
You're like well that plant is a phenotype of a genotype
And it's giving a different chemotype and every one of those
Environments so like have you tried it in different places to see what's going to happen?
And what you've got going on is you were probably
Spraying a lot of your plants with kelp or using it in the whole garden a lot of them weren't sensitive to it
And then you get a line that is highly sensitive to either
ga3 or
auctions in that case and it more likely was auctions because it didn't morphodite if it was just throwing the
Epithelial growth
Then it was probably auctions because if it was ga3 or ethylene
Then you would have either seen stamina or pistol it flower on those plants. That's what are gonna sway in cannabis
It was sexual expression. So when you start seeing some of that
Going I was like I was like I was like when I when it got going it was like in the beginning
I was you know, you always take your phone
You know in the midsummer and you was from seed grown stuff
You never know and sometimes you don't take them because you know, you're just you're just running across
I was like I was I was I ran back back to the
Little nursery plot where we had stuff and I was looking for the tag for that one when I was like saw that I was
Like yeah, I want this one. I want to work with this one and I'm like, please
Did I take a cut of this one, you know?
So it was like it was it was great and we but I could never get it to do it again
You know under there and it was and that's and it's probably
That's it. That's gotta be why it was and I I attributed to was it was hormonally driven through something something was going on
You know what? I mean, but back then I was using a lot more kelp. I don't use a lot of that as much anymore
But it was it's funny, you know, that's funny
What would this be like the the plant equivalent of if you gave a woman tons of testosterone?
Or a guy a ton of estrogen
That's what happens when you start using ethylene or silver on males or females
What I'm talking about is what you start getting a bud formation on the actual middle of the planet
It's called the phileas growth. It's external growth and the epithelial layer of the plant
It can show up on the stem
it can show up on the center that it usually shows up right on the center of the leaf where all the fingers hit the
Can't think of the damn word of the fucking name of the fucking leaf right there the part that connects to the
Damn stem the petiole the petiole is on there so that where the petiole I'm trying to find a picture of it right now
On my Instagram
The plant looks hella healthy, you know
Healthy and the only thing that I ever seen that would happen just before that would show up on the cultivars that it did
Was right before it it almost looked like the pant got
like the
Environment got extra
Arid like the humidity dropped there and edges of the leaf almost kind of curled like a mini taco and the next thing you know
You'd start being that epithelial growth
Showing up on the leaves and everyone's like, oh I got the bomb plant and what you really have is a plant
That's hyper sensitive the two different hormones
Which means now when you breed with it and you cross it to say a plant that could show homo for diet traits now
You have two recessive traits that are both hormone
recessive driven traits that are gonna drive a whole wide range of
different androgynous hormones and different traits that that plants gonna create
If you start breeding them
You might all of a sudden pop that out of a line that you do have no intention of doing
Because it's kind of like if you bred freak show to ABC
I don't get this real weird new feet different expression of a mutation in the leaf because they both carry a extremely recessive
Heterozygous trait for it. So it's that's what's happening there
But it's not every plant but every time I seen it when I researched it it all comes back to epithelial growth with different
ratios happening between the auctions and
Dribbling acids in the plant. So and those are two that have to do with
the way the plant branches and
The structure of the plant so, you know, it's kind of where the opposite of shade avoidance is what I think what's happening there
So and it doesn't I've only seen it once
Show up where it was a male on where it showed up on that leaf where it showed male clusters that were morphed
I don't know female. I've only seen that once it was always where it showed
Just a extra bud on the leaf never showed intersex traits on it
So I'm thinking that it could be tied to the also to jabraic acid side and not just oxen
So that means it's removing auctions
it removes auctions ethylene and
Obsessic acid out of it to maybe those other two hormones being what are
What's causing that to happen at a specific stage in the plants growth? I'm trying to find my post here
I could fucking tell
A lot of back cross work to that, you know
In the old cooler and I went through some of them and we you know did but yeah, man
That's that's that's something that I wanted to search through and see how
You know if I could get that to pop out at all or if that was something that you know
I could get to be as a trait, you know in itself, but you know over the years
I learned more about those hormonal, you know expressions and things and how I was driving
But just just tonight you talking about that in the orchard. I was like, you know, I bet you
The light bulb moment and the kelp depend on where it was sourced from
It could have added a load of synthetic hormones in it depending on where that kill was actually grown at you know what I mean?
It had just been normal
I
Know and that's the ABC by the way, I'm doing the I'm doing the ABC line
ABC 91
so I got the I got the last little bit of
What Caleb over at CSI did with his ABC?
he took he took that the the site for which was the inbred line of
The badass one and he crossed everything in his stable
And he went through and grew a bunch of the cookies and the triangle push and some other stuff and I got this some of
The 91 so I'm gonna I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the 91st, you know ABC so
So someone from Australia told me
They're gonna set hopefully send me a bunch of ABC seeds that they've been growing for a long time
So yeah, I'll hand some over to you
That'd be great, that'd be great. Yeah, man get some freak show ABC mix
Yeah, I'm gonna dedicate I might dedicate some time to a cool one of those one of those leaf shapes
You know and and face it with that with that 91 all the stuff that out of the F2 because their first generation
They're not they don't express at all. You won't you won't see the trait. Yeah
Very you might find one in a hundred or more even like supremely rare you won't see it in the first generation at all
so you just got a bunch of regular plants and then cross all those plants together and then that second generation will unlock that trait and
you can pick out the that that leaf shape and then
Cold the rest and then you can breed those leaf shapes together and then that third generation
You'll be you'll be pretty well set at that leaf as that leaf shape set of set in stone, you know right there close to it
And then you can kind of work from there and do selections and start and start really refining the line, you know after that
So that's part of the journey that I'm gonna that I'm going on with that
I want to I want to do that. I'm gonna do that, you know some chem
With that leaf and you can't tell it's a really cool thing
Especially here in the desert having a smaller leaf would be really cool and useful very similar to Australia in places, you know, so
That's a SoCal plan if I've ever seen one and that's something cool. I want to as a personal little thing that I've been thinking
Yeah
The 91 will be nice on there the 91 or the D or the 4 on that with that plan
Bring that terpene profile over to it. Yeah, or even that dog walker. You're messing with the dog walker
Oh gee on that. Yeah, we got I got all kinds of stuff that we can, you know, make nasty it up with you know
And I mean make her make her cute, you know, I love all those plants man. I'm rocking the same ones
I got a beer too, man there
I just pulled my seed run down with those in there and they're nice man the all those
MDs the dog walker the
I mean the first time I ran it like this is the best lesson anybody could ever learn
You know, like I got that dog walker from Jodhuri years for the grow off competition
like 2017 2018 something like that and
Nobody knew what it was for that competition
So it's a complete mystery plant, right and you gotta grow it and see who grows the best
They tested or whatever and when or whatever the first time I drew it. I got I didn't
Didn't get me cam. I didn't get any gas. I fucked it up somehow
I had no idea like and I didn't know what it was. So I didn't know I fucked it up
You know what? I mean, but I'm like this is this is not this is this isn't I don't like it
You know
Like I was I would have thrown it away any other day on the week like when you're going through stuff you go to I don't
Like it's gone. It's gone. It's gone. I don't like it. I don't like it, but because it was a competition
I grew it three different ways. I had three different ways
I'd cloned it up and three different kind of situations and so I could see it's different different expressions
I had the best representation to turn in for my entry and
The second plant, you know that I did it man fucking nailed it, dude
It was just it was some of the best fucking weed that I have ever smoked and when I took that was my entry plant
And when I took that one in
Like everybody at the place like oh man, this is fucking this is the shit
It's like fucking popped off the fucking nasty like those some of the best fucking weed ever grew at that point
You know, it's like just fucking awesome. You know, I mean and I did I did pretty well in the competition, but
That after that I was like man, that's that's a plan I'm gonna keep because you know
I placed in the competition and then wait I was spacing out. Are you talking about the grow off? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Did you did you enter the graph SoCal?
Yeah
Fuck yeah
That's right, you're like I'm the dude I call your hat the
The the man in the yellow
Yeah, the man in the yellow hat I
Totally forgot about that. Yeah, you're on the stage a bunch
Yeah, yeah, we were all we were all blazing before nobody knew who won, you know and all that stuff and like people like all
You're sure shit one dude. You got people are taking pictures. I'm
Check out stuff. You gotta check out stuff. You can stuff. He man
That guy's competition right there, you know, I was worried about old stuffy, you know, I want to I want to bring him and
Do you remember Jerome?
Yeah, no, I don't remember Jerome no, I think he had one to grow off the year before okay. Oh, yeah
But he was at that event
Like the big black beard
Yeah, yeah, I know you're talking about. Oh, yeah. No, that's cool. That was good days
You know good times with that dog walker. I had sentimental value to me after that, but it was like man
so
You you just you know, you have a hunch you should grow it again
It's always good both things twice man always chrome twice. That's why I say the rules of three
The first time you fucked it up the second time the breeder fucked it up and third time
I'm telling everyone about this fuck up. Well, this is your dog Walker
Yeah, all right on there you go. That's it is bomb. I just
Just pulled the sneeze out of the dog Walker I just smoked bacon grease nice
Yeah, I got you. I got you some I got the dog Beach
I just we just brought brought in so I'll give you a nice little care package of some indoor and you can see the out
You are having outdoor right now. You'll get some my indoor
Totally random question and I can't remember if I asked
One or both of you but in terms of aeration
like if you went from pumice to pearlite to
I guess clay balls are like
What what's your preferred aeration I
Would prefer pumice or lava rock if I could get it still
It's too hard for me to carry that shit around in my wheelchair and most of it
There's the place I used to get it from shut down like during Kovac
They closed in that shit
So I had to go to a new place and they don't stock shit that a handicap didn't fucking fine
You got a acid to the counter for everything and they runs in the back. We don't have that
I'm like, whoa, do you got this and he takes off running like dude?
Let me give you a list and quit running like fucking
Dumbass
Trying to be a national cuz I can't run myself like why don't you just slow down for a second?
Write it all down and go see if you got this shit
Cuz if you do I'm buying it all if you don't fuck off like what the fuck bro
I mean the dude does it every time we're there and shit these fucking off like he's helping
They're waiting like a dummy
So but I would use pumice
There's also what are they called those grow stones? What's the name of those fuckers?
Which will work also
God damn, I don't even know if they still make them anymore. I
Use I use I use like I use pumice or lava rock for beds or things that I'm not moving
So if it's big enough to where I'm not planning on moving it
Then I'll use the heavier stone and the more mineralized stuff, you know for for good stuff
But if it's pots and small stuff, I always have a big bag of perlite and I always I'll open up like a bag
Like I was just helping my buddy set up his little pro tent for the first time, you know
and he bought a bunch of the
Recipe 420 and I opened it up and I'm like dude. There's great. We need more stuff in here. So
So I put you know, I always
Almost anything, you know any ocean forest any?
420 any SF I'm always adding at least 20 more percent 25 percent more
Perlite or pumice or something just to just to aerate that stuff up a little bit
But yeah, the heads allow rock or heavy stuff for fed
pumice and lava rock works are awesome if I don't have to drag around or move it, but
Little pots or little things
And then for water retention like
Do you ever use vermiculite or?
Cocoa sphagnum
Cocoa sphagnum vermiculite whatever you really have on hand if you're an organic gardener
You want to try to source whatever is the closest to you?
But in my mix I like to use a mix of either peat
Or cocoa or both that I want to have in there because with the coconut coconut has a better air
Holding capabilities like even underwater coconut still hold an air where peat moss will will bog out
That's why it's a bargain shit. You don't hear coconut bogs and shit. So I try to use
No, it's for real. There's a reason there's a coconut can travel from fucking one island
That's 2,000 miles over to another island and the coconut didn't fucking rot where peat moss which is great and all but in the short run
But over at the time it becomes humic matter and turns into either soup or the shit
We're looking for and the soupy shit sucks ass. It becomes crap that we really can't use in our garden
That's why the peat bogs preserve shit for so fucking long we're not trying to preserve our roots
So I try not to use as much peat as possible because even though it works great now and this grow and maybe the next
Grow when I do got to get rid of it where I'm putting shit that I've deemed not good enough to grow my plant in
Somewhere that I've decided is good enough for me to dump this junk at where I could use my coconut outdoor for days
For a long time. It's just gonna break down to a little bit smaller
But it's still not gonna by the time Pete turns into the soupy mess coconut still has ability to hold some air
So if I'm gonna use Pete
I always try to mix a little bit of my coconut in it unless I can only get Pete and then then I'd be using
Pete
And then if you can source it like pit moss like Layton talks about that'll work great too in my area
I can't get it
I have to do special order it
Which means my crippled ass has to make three or four fucking drives down to the place to make sure they got it
They forgot to order it. I got a reorder it some always happens when I got to order shit down here
It's a brand new place. They don't recognize me
So they don't think I'm coming there to buy this like I've been dude
You know how much money I spent at the last place and shut down. I'm gonna come in here to spend money
I'm just cuz my left legs missing don't mean my pockets missing what I need to come to the store and buy my shit
I'm gonna buy the best shit that I need to buy
Instead of buying just whatever the hell I can afford because that's where the failure breaks in when you go by the cheapest
All you can like you go to Home Depot and go buy patio plus and the next thing
You know your fucking soils full of grubs and shit and you're like what happened like well
You put in some fucking sewage with a bunch of grub larvae and the next thing you know
You're you're breeding fucking bugs up in this shit homie
You've got to know what your inputs are. You got to know everything worm castings aren't always worm castings
You need to know what you're putting on the plant when you're putting it on the plant
You need to know where it's getting source from people start getting locked in as a GMO or not
I'm like, well, even if it is maybe that GMOs produced better than this jackass over here. That's growing in the patio plus
Like what he's offering you may not be the greatest input just because it says organic on the back
It just doesn't man you got to start looking at people like I got a guy here that likes to sell
Worm castings at the like the the local gross
Vegetable fucking thing that's here. I can't farmers market go to the farmers market
He sells five gallon buckets of worm castings and you open them up and it looks like he let newspapers
Soak and slop for a fucking week and then throw him in there with them handfuls of worms of shit
You're like, what is this shit? There's no castings in here, man
Right, and when you try to open it, he doesn't want nobody opening them. He's like, it'll kill the worms
I'm like dude, it's 120 out here. They're dead bro. I want to see what's in the fucking thing
You're tripping bro. And one day finally make them pop it open and literally in front of everyone
He he fucking had to go find another farmers market to go to like you can't sell that shit to people dude
He's getting certification to the city
Vermiculite vermiculite
But it ain't great it ain't my number one for sure, you know
In addition large chunk coconut croutons is awesome
For real
Speaking of worm castings. I this is my worm bin from this morning. So
Hold on. Ah
Fuck you. It won't let me play the video
Oh
There we go
The good shit
Where's the sloppy newspaper at dude it's in one of the upper
I'm just
Yeah, you got large burn perlite in there it works fine in pots the problem with perlite is
My question here is this like saprophytic fungi or is this like I'm just straight up mold
Okay
That's the good shit that's not mold
Like brown blues like nasty green stuff like
Greens and black shit
Red white white is good
You know, why is usually good?
You know, not always but white stuff
Are you adding Kashi to that or EM one at all a little bit?
So
So basically I have a lot yeah, and I I have like that worm and and then I have a
Like a compost tumbler
and
so like that one gets like if I could find the pictures I have like
Just these fungi blooms in there which are amazing
Santa's beard
Yeah
That's the take that stuff and you can start using that for IMOs one twos and threes extend them on through
That stuff's killer when you're transplanting your plants take some of that and stick it underneath the transplant hole
Put a layer of soil over the bloom and drop your plan in there
It'll help with making a symbiotic relationship with the plant way faster than buying a bag of dry micas or something like that
Not that I'm gonna knock knock my cause what if you have that available
When you're gonna transplant use that up, it's that shit is awesome for transplanting
Killer here we go. Check it out. Oh, wait
You can make a poor man's version with some steel oats and some EM one
And at the top of your refrigerator
So
Someone said pictures they want you guys to look at so I'm trying to
I
Was just wondering if maybe you've had any experience with that
I never threw any kind of citrus in with my worm bins or nothing like that either
Yeah, no, that's bad. It's bad for you know, the worm development
So
So just quickly
These pictures were sent in and if you can tell me what the comment or question is in the chat
That was let me go back
Where are you TN 101?
So if you can tell it I totally space you know and what your comment or question was
It says or the question can't be or TN 1 or TN the leaf stem is growing a branch
The leaf stem
the leaf
Leaf the stem is growing double
Auxiliary shoots. Oh
I see what he's talking about. They're
Coming on like in the middle of the plant there. There's a branch going straight up there off of
on both sides
That's very odd double. Yeah double auxiliary one
From here would be one two three nodes up
Yeah shooting straight up. That is odd
I've not seen that expression on plants. I've seen them. I've seen them stay small and never get that large
Not grow that way. That's that almost looks like someone
Like super cropped them into that position. Yeah, no they didn't I mean it really does
Those are on get some spider-man shit going on there. What what strain are we looking at here? What cultivar genetics wise?
That is very odd, it's not doing that on every node either
It's just that one node or is it doing on multiple plants?
Looks like it's just that one node
You seen that brother
Yeah, man
I've seen that I've seen that once or twice before and that's usually like I've seen it in a couple of cookies and cookies crosses
I don't know what that is. But you know
Mandarin cookie
But yeah, I always chop that up to a hormone hormones like from you know what we were talking about earlier
You know some sort of a system that was just kind of over driving and it didn't have anywhere else to throw it like using
a lot of kelp
Or you know
Alphas or other some something in high high doses like that, you know
were they super cropping on this plant or did they top it a lot and possibly because
But I don't know I don't honestly know what caused that but I always noticed I've seen it three or four times and it's
it always is with the cookies cross or into the options being redistributed into the
Into to the foliage area but not coming from the root system
So it's not something that's affected by the soil or the rhizosphere. It's just something that's affected by what's being produced
Actually in the storage of those hormones in the system or how they're being produced through photo the photo hormones
I'm
Cookies will do some serious shit on you. It's weird. Yeah, I always wanted to know like
What you know why would go from you know
and if that particular plant like I always wanted to know if it carried through to like the
The butt on the patio with the cookies with the with the cookies throws throws, you know
The stem out of the stem instead. I wanted to know if that was gonna you know
Be all kind of one inclusive type thing, you know, it didn't it never transferred through for me
No, I have a buddy though. He'd know he was actually he was in that and that will grow off competition
He had he had the cookie plant. He was but SF SF V or S SF be grown
I'll put I'll put it, you know, I'll post them up and show you I get a couple pictures of that happening
You know what is his cookie recently, you know, he was talking to me about that, too
You know, so that's kind of a that's funny how it's been popping up a lot lately, you know
That's interesting. I know it pops up people start seeing it and then they're like what the fuck is this?
I did something special or got a special cultivar here and I guess you could look at it one way that it's special
but then like if you don't know what to do with it or how to breed it true like you were talking about taking a
plant that has a
recessive trait breeding it to a
homozygous line that in the f2s doesn't give you or the f1s doesn't give you any of the
Heterozygous traits until you go to the f2 and then you randomly see it take it to an f3 and now you replicate the mutation
Turn it into a homozygous trait instead of a heterozygous
So you end up with a recessive homozygous trait?
Which means it's gonna breed true for a recessive trait that the plant carried naturally
Right and people they're like my plan has it I see it like breed it something that doesn't have it what happens
Right, and that's when people have started getting confused and like well that well, it's you know that it's breeding
Yeah, we're simply just do it again. Like, you know, like yeah with my orchard lady, you know like that back cross it
I couldn't get it to happen again, you know what I mean?
Replicated. Yeah, if it's going to happen again and again, then that's something we you know, definitely gotta take note
I don't know. I don't know what caused I always talk that up to extra hormonal
Drive, you know
Healthy ass plants usually are doing that
plants there
Synthetically fed, you know or heavily driven, you know, I've usually noticed they're not like they're not like like real like
Super like no-till organic types are usually either like, you know, lots of organic stuff in liquid form or
It's got you know, synthetic type nutrient driving, you know like that, you know
I've never used the other way, but I'm not sure because both of those are being
Reliant on the fact that you're gonna like I said earlier pile drives and nutrients into the system of the plant
Even through an organics that's using too many teas or that has too many created
Enzymes action going on to where you're forcing a nutrient through the root tip that the plant doesn't need right now
Right in a no-till system
The plant uses exudates to talk to different types of bacteria or fungi that are in the soil
So that that particular species can break down phosphorus or nitrogen or whatever
It's after right and then let's that microorganism do the work that it cannot do
Which then passes that off as an enzyme through its body as
Its excrement now that the plant can use and that passes through in the system of the plant
So that's why I brought up with the IV a3 now. You could have been dumping too much
Kelp through the soil or spraying it on like because because those are also
Mobile hormones, they're gonna move around in the system in the plant. They're gonna
You're gonna be able to pour down the root system and it's gonna affect
I I was gonna leave you by yourself
Here he comes he's back
Yeah, so you can affect different parts of the plant through the soil system or through the leaf
It's we we learn this when we start to breed with fin plants
It starts to teach growers a little bit more shit, right?
so when you can take silver and spray it on a female and affect the amount of ethylene she produces at the top of the
Plant because you only sprayed the top and then the bottom still produces on
Adulterated buds and shit. We we start seeing that we can use hormones to drive the expression of that plant
That's what we're doing there with those. So
Your plant could be sensitive to all kinds of shit at different times
Also, so plants gonna make more oxen's during early growth as opposed to later in its growth
When it's gonna start to try to produce more ethylene
So you start swaying the oxen or the ga3 and now that ratio goes higher than the ethylene supposed to have it and you end
up making a
Plant turn homophodite in your garden that never was this because of the way you're feeding it you start giving it too much available
Nitrogen too fast in a single form and then you start seeing homophodites on the bottom of the plant
You could even have been your cover crop that was producing too much nitrogen. That's off gassing on the mulch layer
That's hitting the bottom layer of your plants that you didn't thin out enough. That's trapping ethylene. That's coming up off the system
All right. This is what happens when you're using products like ethyl fun. They off gas ethylene. You use that on a male plant
That's how you reverse a male
But you can see this through different phenotype
Expressions when you use different hormones on a plant to drive its expression in the garden that you have so your friends got a female
It's always a male female and you bring it to your house and start spraying it with shit
And you don't even know what it contains some of these chemicals and next thing
You know, you got a plant that's expressing shit that never did anywhere else
Do you do you have a you have a ratio like how much how much you use of the ethanol?
That's all gonna be with different plants I use that
I was using I use two ounces, you know, I mean, which was a lot
You know what?
I mean to try to do a couple of things, you know, and that's it that's that's pissed off
That's pissed off one of my males this point where I was like, okay
I'm gonna have to do I'm gonna have to do it different a little next time
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna start I'm gonna start real small, but I'm gonna I don't know how small I
Need to go or how little it can be used or how much you know?
What what the ratio would be or what so I've been I've been doing that test myself
I'm trying to remember off the top of my head how much
But I believe it's 90
species
I have it. I have it in my notes here. I just it's in my it's in my drive. I have it
There's a guy named HY and Mohan Ram that's done all that information on reversal of males using ethafine and cobalt
I've shared it multiple times. I just can't remember the numbers off the top of my head
I believe he used
90
milligrams of
Or not milligrams milliliters of
Ethafine, but I'm not sure if he's using ethafine or if he's using the active ingredient the active ingredient
I can't remember the name of it
But it's not when you buy it in pure it comes in a higher percentage than ethafine at the phones
I could cut down version. So it's only got like at the fall. I think at the phone some it's Laurel
Yeah, there's the floral and at the phone the active ingredient in floral is at the phone
So you can buy at the phone in a bottle by itself and that also comes in two different strengths
So when people ask me what how strong to spray it it depends on which one you're using really and the cultivar
So I always say start as low as you can
So with a PPM meter you you want it to show about 90 to 100 parts per million is where I would want to start at
With my mail because that's also gonna show me if my mail has a tendency to switch its hormones
Extremely easily when I start low if I start high, I know I can sway the hormones
I might kill the fucker
But I know that's gonna sway the hormones because it's so artificially high
if I start low and I have a mail that I think stable and I all of a sudden put ethylene on him and he
Instantly starts to throw fucking pistol at formation like within three days
I may have a male that isn't very stable for me to use in the feminization process of that male
so
That shows me now that I would want to introduce another male and spray it at the same rate to see if that things gonna
Flower over at the same rate and see if what I'm doing is actually
Conductive to the breeding projects I'm at but don't never start high with the aethyphon even with silver
You want to start as low as you can and use them the lowest amount that you can to get that plant to sway over
When you're going
But you don't want it solo that like just like just the presence of it in the gardens making that plant show stamina or pistil
It flowers where she's actually a homo for that. I use that I use that for different types
Oh, I used to use that all more more time. I don't use it anymore for anything, but
Back in the day nursery business. We used to use it all the time
There's all the trees, you know, so they yeah, they wouldn't flower and drop the fruit and do all that stuff
You know, we spray it with that and it would be it'd be good to go and he's like depends on your dilution
It was like two ounces per gallon or you know
Depending on you know something like that. And so like I said, I started I started with just you know, bang
That's the that's the mixture. That's what I we've always used
That's what's going on and that fucking did that and it's like, you know, that's way too fucking strong for you, you know
I
Believe there's something in the lines that I sent you Peter on reversals that might show the ethylfine usages in the
I'm pretty sure it should say respects reversals or reversals on there
Reversals like you know, you know reverse like traditional reversals for fence, you know
I'm gonna I'm gonna start, you know, putting out a lot more fancy, you know work with the elite stuff, but
I've also found like with the dog walker, you know when you get them reversed and
The Royal Kush now I reverse the Royal Kush
done, you know several different plants of my own but the Pam and different ones that I found it like when I
Use an STS and I spray it and I spray and everything's going good and I'm like, oh, we're good and I stopped
I just stopped cold turkey after a little while and just just let it kind of do its thing that that shit
Sometimes wears off, you know
Yeah, and the plant will will not not finish out and produce the pollen that you need, you know, so if you
Like you need to spray until she produces
Afterwards forever like every 10 days like in addition to whatever you know, whatever you've got it to flip
You know, you don't just ever stop
I've I've learned that you spray it, you know
And actually, you know every other every week now and just just to make sure that he stays he you know
I mean and drops that drops enough pollen, you know that works because I've gotten all the way to where they're beautiful
Everything's perfect and it's totally male
There's no pistols and then nothing comes out and you're literally are you get hardly any pollen that comes out and you're like fuck
You know, so it's not you know
And you can crush it up and you try to manipulate it and try to save whatever you can
but the amount that I've gotten from dog walkers like
You know just kind of doing it the old way that I was doing it was very little pollen and then now the new way
I'm doing I'm getting way more pollen to come out which is great. So that's like are you making your own STS or what's up?
Do you are you getting some?
Because I've used I make my own and I've used I've used riot spray and I want to try
Elite X elites here. I want to put them all next to each other and see what's up
The shout-out to Mendocino 2020, yeah, I've been to seen also I was gonna say there's also
After using a couple different ones and that one was that one was one that I like, you know the best but I wanted to
Try that actually to leave
Yeah, hybrid tech. They're the ones that dropped the original one online that I know of the first person that ever dropped it online
Would have been him. That's where the one I use comes from the old recipe that he used
I use a nine-to-one STS that I make on mine
and what I found is I spray once a day and
I try to do more nodal spraying instead of full plant spraying and I try to use something like soap nut or
Something like that as a spreader so that it sticks to the nodes extremely
Well, you wanted to absorb into the tissue and off gas into the tissue and have it absorbed into that epidural layer
So some of it makes its way into the xylem and the floam tissue
You really don't need to spray the leaves because the leaves aren't gonna carry as many of it
It doesn't have as much ability to pass that floam and xylem fluid back to the plant
So that's why you want to spray those nodes. Yeah, it burns a shit out of them
Because they can't photosynthesize
You end up with a plant that doesn't produce anything at all. But what I do is I do it every day
Until it goes into flower ten days before
Sometimes it's only five depending on the cultivar and then I spray up until the day
I see one of those stamina flowers begin to want to open it doesn't have to drop pollen and then I'll stop at that point
and
Because if it does drop pollen you're spraying any kind of moisture on it that shit's dead
So it's not gonna work
And I also like to pull those stamina flowers off before they even have any
Pollen coming out of them and I'll put them in jars and do them like a drying technique with the with these crude
coffee cup containers filled with a
desiccant without the pods being able to touch that so
Able just wick the moisture out of there as fast as possible and you can dry those stamina flowers
as long as the stamina flowers weigh less than the
the
The damn where's it at here the desiccant that goes in there?
I do large bead food grade desiccant and I use that for
Drying all my pollen and that stuff will dry fast
And then what you do is you can take a tweezers and just open those stamina flowers that don't open on their own
I can't use tweezers and do that shit anymore
You know dry them out really fucking good
Man, I can get him to work if they don't open and there's nothing that I can get in
but really the best thing is just do it right and I found I just keep spraying I get the dump and
You know cool thing
I always do and I put on my Instagram
But if you got a male and you got a bunch of nice branches that are coming off of it
You can you know, right when it's getting ready to open up
You snip a couple of those branches off and just throw it in the water and bend them over onto some parchment paper
Something put them in a little cardboard box, you know
So that they all the flowers open up and drop that shit down onto a cardboard
You know on a little parchment paper and you can kind of clean that up and that's the bomb dude
You can kind of isolate it out and it's just quick and easy and the cardboard box is dry and suck them shit away
It's nice
But yeah, but before I you know, I give up too early after she was slipped and she's pretty and I would get I'd get
So that's something that I learned it maybe will help somebody in the future that don't have to almost screw that up
Keep spraying it, you know, like every 10 days
Yeah, so you didn't shit, you know close to it, you know
The reason I do every day is so I can keep that androgynous production of hormone levels at the production
I want the more ethylene I would but you put on a male the more he's gonna try to produce in a system naturally
But when you stop he automatically goes back to trying to produce his natural level
That's why you're seeing sometimes they back off when you do your films
Same thing happens when you're spraying with silver. It's cutting down
So what happens you're spraying silver on a plan or STS people use collodial silver or silver thiosulfate or you can?
Take ga3 and it'll have an a masculine effect on the plan also
but when you're using silver what happens is ethylene is a
Hormone that's produced by the plant that
Shows as a female and the hormone is passed with the copper when it's passed with copper in the system
The plant naturally shows a pistol at formation
We take silver and start spraying it on the plant prior to it beginning to produce higher amounts of ethylene and copper in its system
We replace the copper with the silver and now the ethylene doesn't have a way to bind to the other pathways in the system and be
produced
Androgynous Lee in the system. So this is what cutting the
Ethylene level in the plant so you slowly reduce how much ethylene that female produces while the ga3 level
Starts to slowly increase and once it hits a breaking thresh point
That's where you end up getting that reversal on that plant some are gonna show sooner some are gonna show easier
Some are gonna produce more or less that you can use a ga3 when you're doing that
That's why I was asking you if you make your own
I was about to start trying to add some ga3 at different levels to different cultivars to help extend that flower. So when
When you
I've been dabbling with that adding the da3 in there to
Make it a little bit better. So they're not all stacked up on top of each other
Stretching out to all the cells ga3 makes the cells get longer in there when you increase too much of it
So you do a little bit at a time and it starts to make it
Almost look like it's gonna foxtail out on the plant and it starts to string out and almost looks like it's bolting. It's weird
Now has the ability to open because on a female or on a regular male you have a filament that's attached to the bract that
Releases that's why when a male
Flowers always standing up like this and as it gets older
It starts to fall over and the filament attached out comes out and lets all the sepals open up
When we're doing a fem a fem bract doesn't have that filament
that's why I wind up with an issue with the
The sepals never opening and giving us a pollen like we want because they never fall over
Because they don't have that fucking that ability to do that. It's not there
You're just sitting there with a bract that's attached to the fucking node that just keeps stacking on top of another one
And they don't have the ability to pop out of the bud and drop the pollen on anything at all
That's what's that's the whole difference between those plants. That's why ga3 has
Ability to help extend those cells in there
Send out the the actual node so it extends out and the node will almost act like the filament now
So now you get bracts the male bracts that produce those stamina flowers on the female
We're gonna be able to fall to the side now slightly. They're never gonna be able to dangle over. They don't have a filament
They can't do it
Filament that that's the problem that we're all dealing with when we do reversal and like my like my Pam line
You know, she she's a bitch and that's what it took was adding the the the jubilee in there with it
You know, it's really kind of give her the extra she needed to really flip
You know the rest of the way really be good at it, but what I've also noticed like with with those really stretchy
You know sativa fucking varieties when you flip them the man
Those flowers aren't stacked on top of each other like those nasty squat indica
You know what? I mean?
I know they're way easier to collect pollen from way more fun right less buffing an issue ain't crushing them
No, when you get the royal or you get the dog walker, it's just like just fucking dense
Years of just mail hours, you know
Yeah, they make beautiful male flowers
They're they're beautiful, but they just don't produce the pollen because literally the Bract has nowhere to open that's the same reason that
those equatorial
That's why hanging over those branches, you know what I mean?
And like like doing that what I did I found success doing that you cut off my brain and really hang them over
So that you know what's over there will drop easier and it's on top of itself, you know
What I mean sitting there so it's a lot easier to collect, you know
a little bit of
That way you don't need a lot to do you see so a little bit here and a little bit this way a little bit that
Way if you're trying to you know, that's that's definitely how I found success buying stuff, you know, so but
300,000 grains of pollen in a male stamina flower
Up to up to 300 for every stamina male flower on the plant up to 300,000 grains of pollen inside that
That one male flower man the power of that one plant and the reason you're have to you tip them over and get better results
Is we're indoor so we don't produce the amount of wind that can be outdoor
We don't have the pollinators in there either like if you've ever put a male cannabis plant outside and watch the bees swarm to it
Bees love male cannabis man. It's it's like fucking honey to them
They will fly to that thing and swarm all over it. It's crazy
They love that and it has to do with the amount of available amino acids from the pollen and bees bee pollen
They'd love that shit. It helps them build brand new cells. They can make new babies, man
They're always thought about that, you know, like that, you know Paul Stamets watching and watching the bees with the mushroom
You know what?
I mean for health benefits and different things like that and having that correlation for the you know
The colony collapse and like the idea to try to you know
Do some mushroom enough and then like bees at the at the at the pollen of the of the cannabis plants for me
Like a like a crazy person, you know, I know there's crazy working on on different supplements and things for pollen and different
That's out there pretty soon. The next great superfood. I bet you know, what I was saying, too
Oh, it's killer food for you. And it's probably good
Killer for the plant like information on like the nutritional and like what I
Posted a bee pollen is fucking killer. I've posted it before bee pollen has a serious amount of
amino-acids
Stuff like using it as like a nutrient supplement or like things like that like
You know for any beneficial things and I'm sure there's some sort of science coming out
That's something that definitely needs to be kind of thought about you know, just like as like, you know
Like the mushroom is like a good supplement for those maybe that you know, it's like those different chords
But yeah, the bee pollen eating the honey from fucking shit like that is key
You know, I mean you're getting all the same things, you know, I mean
But that's fucking cool shit the circle
Do you sometimes feel like you're cheating on Pam with dog walker
I know I think that we have an arrangement, you know, everybody
Like if I keep you and you are you're in the family you're part of the hair you've made it
Have a dog or something anyway, it wasn't she out walking her dog once in a while, man
Yeah, she had to have a pet and you got to be special and and then you're introduced to the
to the herd or to the you know, I don't know if
The guy that dog walkers nice man, but man, yeah
Yeah, there's a few that I you know, I just I couldn't see letting go, you know
And then every time that I have like I have a plant and I wonder if I
Should I just let this one go, you know and like I always regret it, you know what I mean?
I always regret doing it. I'm at that spot right now, man. I always do it, you know
So god damn it, you know, so if you always yeah, you're thinking about if you should let something go you shouldn't let it go
You know, keep it around again. Keep it going. You'll want it back in another way, you know, so
Wow shit, you know, are you thinking of letting Pam go or what are you thinking of letting go?
Who me?
No, Tyler. No
Yeah, I let the hot sister go man, oh man that was that one hurts me still to this day so
It's a Pam s1
the very first time that I reversed
Pam I reversed one branch on her and she kind of half-ass didn't put very much pollen out and I got just a kind
of a few seeds
to pollinate and I
I'd pop one or two seeds out of there just to kind of see what would happen
Years ago and then I'll pop this plant and it was fucking dude
Man, she was sexy and she was tall and skinny just like Pam and she had all these different hair
But she was froth and you can see pictures of the hot sister on my Instagram. She is fucking beautiful and
She tasted just like she was really on the grape side. She really had this
Thing about her and for some dumb
reason I bred with her a few times and then like, you know, like
other things came in and you know
I mean, I couldn't get rid of Pam number Pam one and I didn't when I had the hot sister
I didn't have Pam 15 yet, you know Pam 15 kind of filled the hot sister
You know it's void like I was looking for the hot sister when I found Pam 15, you know
This one's not the hot sister, but it's something completely different that I'm not gonna let go away either, you know what I mean?
So I every day though. I still think about it. I'll flip through pictures sometimes
I should have it, you know, and so yeah, I don't know how we got there. But yeah, I regret that one. That's what I regret
You know, but every plant has to have a purpose, you know, the dog walker doesn't step on Pam's toes are completely different
You know completely different smokes completely different flavors completely different plants that you know having that one and this one makes sense
Because you can't you know, you know, they're totally different, you know
So that's one thing that I found you can't keep plants
They're the same like you got like three of the same basically the same thing
Unless they're like you're a historical preserver or there's like some sort of significance to the replication of this plant
But if you're just picking plants and keeping plants, you shouldn't just fucking you know
They shouldn't all make you feel the same way or do the same thing
You should I try to have a toolbox and this plant this, you know, this one has you know
Mold and mildew this one's very medical. This one is fucking kicks my ass this one, you know takes me through my day
You know all that stuff. So if I keep you and
You have a job
That's how my mother mother room works, how would you describe bacon grease which is what I've been smoking tonight
Kind of like breakfast
The f2 generation reminds me like breakfast turps. It's not like that. It's like kind of funny
Kind of just kind of just weird
This rear musty turps the the first generation
The the tall spear, you know number I think it's number 13 that that one that you got that one's got a little bit more
of a a little bit more of a brightness to it. It's got more of a
More more pan 15 like more citrus or you know, woody tones to it
But it still has that breakfast thing like like like like waffles without syrup
Like maybe a little faint cinnamon or nutmeg or like some, you know bacon and eggs with the syrup bacon
It's very like salty. It's very breakfast. That's my wife
Described it as when she tasted
But it's kind of it's not it's not a send you this sleep strain by any means
that's a you could go through your day and smoke a bunch of bacon grease, but it's not something that
You're gonna not know that you're consuming, you know
You're gonna lose your thought. I find it to be kind of like
Like what I'm feeling doing right now kind of jumpy, you know final thought thought loss time lost type weed, you know
Shit like that. We're goddamn. I'm hot. No, you're like you think you're not high but you stop for a second
It's kind of like that type of weed and it carries a lot of those
15 trades of the sativa side on that effect where you're kind of euphoric and
You know energy pleasing but not you're not running, you know, you're you're you're alert but wasted, you know
I guess it's a good way alert and wasted
I'm definitely not running anytime soon
No, no, it doesn't make you but you don't you know
You don't you could actually do some shit like I can I can smoke bacon grease and fill the greenhouse or you know
Play guitar or whatever, you know, you kind of get
Excited to do something or play on the phone or do whatever, you know, it's a good it's a good it's a good smoke
I'm going through the I've went I've been going through the the f2s. I'm gonna go through the another bathroom
You know this season
And do some selections and look at look at a couple more of them to see where where we're standing. But man they are
The f2 it's extremely dense like leaning towards that dosey look inside you get way more than dosy dosy dough
Nug shape on like a Pam, you know body frame. So they're really cool
tall branchy plants stack these
triangular dense
Golf ball rock hard nugs, you know
That
All the way up in that fucking killer fucking spear, you know, I mean so you can weave on you can do stuff
but they're not full they're not full spears and they're you know, it's
The second the the f2s are way more on the dense flower structure side
ten ten to one, you know the
Morphological characteristics of the actual flower is way more
Dosey doe esque compared to that first generation where they were more pan 15 a little bit more more squishy a little more open
But I enjoy the shit out of the f2
Smoke wise turps are really cool because
They hide that they're there it's like week three week four they're starting to sugar up but you're like
These are these not smelling and then you you reach underneath of them and you touch that
I usually reach up underneath some of those lower flowers and I touch underneath of the flowers and I smell I smell like, you know
And the grease factor is extreme and the
The turps are we you know what? I mean? Like, you know, it's like whoa, you know you make them
You do this thing where holy shit you you really get you really get kicked in the face
But you gotta get up you guys you gotta get it. You gotta get close to them to notice, you know
Which is kind of cool, you know
The the Pam line doesn't do that. She's a she's a she's a stinky bitch from down the street
So she'll light you up. You got a whole bunch outside
So like you have this way this one as soon as you cut them and I noticed that with the gelato
The gelato crosses to like they're they're low on the low low on like the I
don't know the
Grow turps, I guess like during their growth period and then once you cut them
The flavor and the turps kind of zoomed out of the motherfuckers and like holy shit
I should have taken more clones of this, you know, that's happened to me more with with the F2s than ever before
You know, so but that's what's kept me through what I've been blazing a lot of you know lately is that
Those types of selections, so I look forward to you know playing with those this evening. That's something I'm definitely continue
Fucking I love smoking it some of it. I keep it, you know
There's a couple different ones a couple different jars and they were some of the first ones to go away, you know
So every time I have it it goes away quick and that that's something
I look I got shit that's been sitting in there for
You know months that I'm like, yeah, I don't know
you know, but
Greece doesn't happen that yeah, not one batch that I had tasted yet. So I'm happy with that
By the way, can you guys can you guys hear my crickets?
Can you hear that though because they're going nuts in my garage right now
Cricket in Times Square
Yeah, they like my house
So there there was a question about
Why I'm gonna get off on a totally different topic so get your last comment in
No, I was gonna say there are a limited number of
No, I'm gonna get off on a totally different topic
So get your last comment in
No, I was gonna say there are a limited number of
Number of camel toes and cool ranch
Aka pine web gold
up on Daga
Quick history badass motherfucking plants
I had to at least get some out and every time I keep getting email even to this today
I even got two emails about the
pint across
I like that your wife approves of these names, by the way
That's
Camel so camel so
Yeah, you send me some of those camel toes that one that one. That's why it's limited time
I'm not doing that anymore. I'm by that one. That one's gonna be I can't work that one to
So
The plant itself are fucking out of this world
which is why I'm like, I want to bring it up because I'm not allowed to do it and
They are coming out killer. Basically
camel toes is
Pam one and
Dosey doe resin stud so it is one of those points. So my Pam one
Got crossed to a dosey doe resin stud, which is also the father to baking grease
Often the father to a couple other things that I said you selected stud that I pulled out of a good population. But anyway
He pollinated Pam one out of those seeds
I selected a killer, you know plant purple squat. You can see her on the Instagram beautiful like
Really durable to cold and late season storms
Mold all that good stuff with killer turps and great cookie type bud structure
Really really cool plants. I cross that to a fuel mill that I found out of a batch of seeds that Josh
Gave me dropped breath bird at the region conference the last region conference that there was
before coded like back in
2019
We all got together everybody had a good time was one of the greatest times ever and you know
they do the seed swap there and
Josh gave me a bunch of seeds that you know
He had been working on with this f2 line that he had selected a load of plants, you know
Several hundred plants he pulled out a winner and he lives up north where there's not good
You know not a good season for outdoor
Rain, it's a moist place
Hell so he plants that make it through there have to have this durability factor to them and
He was working the test for Rosa black lime reserve line and
He ended up finding a fucking killer plan out of a bunch this last year. He called it, you know
What's a black walk gold or something killer and it's fucking it is, you know, it's the bees needs
shit
But I also was going through that same population the seeds that have two generation seeds
And I found a killer male out of their fuel mail greasy
fucking stinkies earthy
Really? I mean like true earthy fuel like smell on the mail like rub pull down
leaves off I mean
It's a rarity to have like that true
Earthy fuel you type smell, you know that I've seen, you know with the mail usually like dill pickle or you know
Some other type of turf. It's something kind of funky that kind of signals fuel to me
But this one was truly like a fuel mail
And I selected him out of a you know, good good good bit of seeds
He pollinated a fuckload of cool things
everything that I had going the Pam one
pam 15
fucking bitching at doc walk dog walker back cross he did
all kinds of shit in the pine tar kush
And all kinds and I started passing out those seeds to all my friends and my little fruit tree
characters for the for the winter test and
They've been he's killing he's he's sending he's sending flavor he's sending frost he's sending durability all the plants
There's got killer branches where the bottom branches are like reaching up towards the you know
I've worked the top walk of great branching features
In in the lines even in the in the pine tar and cool ranch which I have up there
There's like nothing not very many at all
That's the pine tar kush in bread line
killer menthol
pine funk
whole nother story I got a killer
killer plan out of that a while back and
I pollinated it with that to get that fuel pine
classic fucking
And because the pine tar is an inbred line, it's gonna do a lot of dominating really heavy indica
It's gonna be you know, it was used as a female
It's gonna do that that domination factor on it because of that the genetic character of it
But that that test Rosa and black line reserve. It's got all of those fucking goodies in there that
contribute, you know and
The shit that's been coming out is fire
I'm really excited. We're gonna cut down a big pine car
Black line test Rosa crop here pretty quick at my buddy's place. I'm really excited about that
I'm also excited about that. I
Seriously, that is the Pam one. Del C. Del resin stud to that fuel mill test Rosa black line reserve and
That I
Did a quick drop myself out of that one and those were like that as soon as it was dry
It was so tasty. It was lip smackingly delicious
It was really very very dosy dough very very cookie kind of structure and bud kind of qualities into it
But it had lots of killer branching
some funky extra
um and
Enter qualities, they're kind of kind of hard to explain but I can't say that it was it fucking disappeared
Like I wish I had it today. I'm really kind of bummed out. I didn't grow more of it. So
There's only a few my wife won't let me keep that one around so I can't advertise that one like with confidence
You know, so that's a limited one. Somebody take it and roll with it. It's a great one
But the pine car cool ranch and the camel toes
They're killer and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna work with that line and do anything crazy, you know
It's I'm gonna let Josh have his have his thing with it
Those limited things and have fun
Back a little bit, you know
Keep the keep the ball rolling my direction there
So there is
That there is a question a long time ago and it's kind of come up again
so Matthew is
paralyzed and
He wanted something for good like ghosting and nerve damage
Up you're muted
I'm not paralyzed, but I am missing a limb and I have a lot of ghost pain nerve damage
Extremes amount so I understand what he's talking about Matthew. Um, what I would steer you to is
A
Deep chunk or something like organ Afghani or something like my mud bone. I just sent Peter a picture of it
It's in the lines right now. I was gonna ask if I could give away a pack here tonight myself
It says mud bone. It's a it's one picture. I just sent but I
Myself I use my space cush line because that's what I have at the moment
Last year. I did have the deep chunk that I should have never let go like we were talking about letting plants go
I let it go and was gonna pop some more
And I just should have kept that one instead of waiting to pop some more because some of my older seeds didn't pop
So now I'm sifting through some more to get it going and I've only got one to pop up
So who knows if I'm gonna get a male or female to the one that came out of them?
So I would be looking for something that's
More on the narcotic style high that and those for me come through the pure Afghani something in the master
Hindu
Bubba
deep chunk or the organ Afghani
royal kush
All those lines will work great for nerve pain nerve damage. That's what I use specifically myself
Did you say I'm looking for mud bone?
Yeah, mud bone. It should be in I just sent it over. Yeah
Mud bone is the pre-nightly bubble across the angel
I made that line when I was working at my club and I ran it through a bunch of my MS patients
The reason it's named a mud bone is Richard Pryor suffered from MS himself
That's what he died from and the man was one of the without that dude. I wouldn't be me
I used to sit in my basement when I was eight smoking joints listening to his albums on my record player, man
I used to practice how to say the word motherfucker, right? So this I used to I learned it from him man
It's for real Richard Pryor was my best friend when I had no friends at all, man
And when all I wanted to do was destroy the world because of the way I felt I was being treated in it when I
Was little and shit. I just couldn't I couldn't cope man until I found weed
I did not know of a way to control myself
And then I found cannabis and Richard Pryor for real and sat in my basement listening to fucking Richard Pryor albums
smoking weed for years and
One of the first lines I dedicated to somebody else one of my original drops mud bone was in it
That's a line that's dedicated to Richard Pryor's
Character named mud bone. I've dedicated a few lines to him. So there's mud bone. There's grease lightning
there's Jojo dancer and there's now the
And it's deep to aka little feets. All these were dedicated to Richard Pryor all of them have to do with
some form of pain and reducing it and
Trying to help people cope with fucking the shit life can throw at you because if any of y'all know anything about Richard Pryor's life
That man went through some shit man that dude
He seemed shit a lot of us never
Have to see
With it in ways that none of us wish we would deal with it
And if you listen to the stories that he passed or anyone like him you end up you can see perspective from a spot that
You might have never gotten into that. So I made that mud bone line to help folks with MS
I ran it through 40 different MS patients that all reported positive
Feedback off of that line. So I end up naming it and dedicating it to Richard Pryor
I just popped a whole shitload of them just to do a test on it because somebody
Hit me up with a pack from seven years ago because I dropped those originally in 2012
so I've been making those from 2012 to 2000 and well 2011 till
2018 is how long I was doing mud bone. Well, he tells me his seeds won't pop
So I asked him when did he get him and he tells me what year?
2014 and I'm like, well, where did you store him? He's like they've been in my drawer. I'm like, well fuck man
I I'll send you something else
So I sent him some more mud bones and some other seeds
And then in the process I threw 20 of them in soil to see or in
Water to imbibe and then threw him in soil and I got 16 out of 20 to pop up
So I'm gonna start searching through those again to try to find a male because the males in there for me
Is what I want to use to breed across on some other lines
Try to induce some of the medicinal qualities from both of the parents in that line
So that's what I'll be working on maybe next year after I've sift through these seeds this year
Yeah, the pre 98 bubble clone I held that cut for 15 years I picked it up in
2003 I had the fire OG the pre 98 Bubba the Romulan my grape Rick
And blue dream or the lines that I picked up all at the right like within three months of each other
I got all those and ended up holding the Romulan over that period from 2003 till
2018 she came back to me off and on but the fire the Bob and the blue dream I held non-stop for 15 years
I just recently got that fire OG back. I'm gonna be working with her
along with the Skywalker the actual Skywalker cut not the
The one from Dutch passion, but the the OG cut that was known as a sativa OG back in the day
She's almost all fucking like cush you could uh
yeah, you could get her you she grows a lot like for the fire and triangle like in structure and
The terpene profile that'll come off of that Skywalker is very similar to that shit, too
I just I just got her back in the house to from a partner
He said it's the guy that sent me the Kim D. My buddy. Uh, I smell 420. He's the homie
He that dudes legit. He's home. He's with a Kevin Chaudhry
Also, that's the last person that I got to hang out with before I had my health issues with Eric and Kevin
But yeah that partner he sent me that cut that Skywalker
I'm gonna start showing her next to some of these other ogs cuz that's what that's what I'm doing now
That's what I was trying to do before I got sick. I wanted to grow a bunch of these ogs next to each other
So I've got triangle
Original cut I've got triangle s1. I've got SMV. I've got ghost. Oh gee. I've got fire. Oh gee
I've got fucking Skywalker. Oh gee, I got the panga cut
I've got all those cuts that I can grow next to each other to show the resemblance that they all have
To say the Kim 91 the Kim D and the Kim for that some people attribute them to coming from you know
So there's a way to show some of those
Just show the plants next to each other. Yeah, man
Yeah that dream for me man, I'd like that that would that would you know, that's something that would like
That that knocked out the rename game that that shows you which one is which and and why and I mean, you know
You're good people to have that, you know
It's hard to hard to do that or have hard hard to say that people have those cuts, you know what I mean?
You know
So just quickly with with Matthew so Cal
Look between you guys and and some other breeders I want to
Understand from him what?
Specifically he like like I don't know if he wants to grow something for nerve pain or something else
But I want to get something in his hands
What I was gonna ask you Peters if I send you a pack of the mud bones
If he's see in the US I can get him to him myself
He's in SoCal, okay, then just tell him to send me a DM on
Instagram if you can or my I'll connect you guys on email and I'll get him a pack of mud bones or something
We can talk he don't have to pay for a man. I got likes he likes femmes
You
Femmes man
You know, mr. Toad got them you got them, you know
But like you've got like the purple indica
Yeah
Hit up Caleb at CSI and get either that purple indica the purple Oracle his Bubba
Any of the bubble crosses that are in there?
All those are pure medicinal stuff that I'm talking yeah for sure
Yeah, if you want to buy seeds from someone besides me if you want something
Matthew and you're dealing with what I'm dealing with. That's what I'm talking about
I can't do this for everybody, but he came up on here. So I'll offer to him
I'll send him some of the mud bones or some other stuff here that I have that I believe will help him with that exact
Issue that I know I know what he's dealing with. I deal with it since
Since 2017 when they chopped the half of my body off of me. I understand what the nerve pain is
He's dealing with what's happening
It's his body is sending out a signal to either a dead nerve or a missing nerve
And what's trying to do is get a signal back and when it doesn't get a signal back
It keeps sending another signal and it keeps doing it more and more to try to get that signal to come back to tell everything's
Okay, and if it's missing or damaged it cannot do that and it registers it back in the brain is pain
There's no way we can get around that I've seen some people use mirror
Training where they sit in front of a mirror for a long time and train their body into realizing that the pains not really there
But it's kind of hard to do some people it works some people it doesn't for myself when I tried it
It did not help me. I know other people that has helped 100%
but that nerve pain is something that just is is so fucking devastating on you sometimes that
Like I have to be smoking herb all the time, that's why I'm always dabbing that's why I'm always smoking
That's why I was like
You have any TV like one-to-one cultivars or anything that you need to use
I mean, yeah, I do but I don't have them in stock anymore. I've made three of them using the AC DC
So I've got grease lightning heaven can wait and cancer battling dank. They're all three
CBD cultivars that come back at around 20 to 25 percent
All three of those find it did you find it that help
Did you find that you helped did it help you with anything or have you used them recently?
That's the kind of
Stuff. I mean, I have a bunch of one-to-one stuff and two to one stuff and I have all kinds of weird rabbit
Hole stuff that I've gone down that nobody ever wants because you know on me
The CBD needs to be really low for me for it to work
If I get it a close to one-to-one what happens to me is I get to I get extremely edgy
And I can't sleep at all. And then what happens is I end up with more pain because my body doesn't rest
Yeah, that happens when I'm on CBD on too high of a level
My mission is to like, you know, like like the Martha's Orchard and there's a couple other ones that I've been you know, like
really diving into lately and trying to find us the hubble a couple things because I
Wanted to be like, you know, I would rather it be like three times the THC
That's like the perfect thing that I found for me and a couple of my buddies, you know that thing
But I don't have fucking real pain, dude
You know, so I was asking you like if like you ever use any of those or what what direction?
You know is good or what was help you?
So it means to help in in my breathing and maybe him maybe maybe a CBD cultivar or something might help out
For me like I'd be in the three or four to one is where I'm at with the THC
I prefer more THC a lot more THC, but it doesn't have to be a high THC strain
Like if we're looking at it, I really want something that's got more terpene profile than pure cannabinoid profile
So if I could find something that's testing at like 12% THC and one or two percent CBD
And then it's also hitting five or six percent terpene profile. It actually works better for me than say something
That's just 27% THC like I can dab with this shit all fucking day and my pain don't go away, right?
This is a pure distillate made from outdoor. I can smoke the same herb and
My pain goes away. I mean it literally is gone to where I don't remember it until
All of a sudden I get a cramp four hours later and like oh shit. I better go smoke some more herb, right?
I can I can actually lay off smoking the bud, but I can never lay off smoking distillate
Hash does the same thing I can smoke acid very small amounts bubble hash and
It'll take the pain away and I believe it has something to do with the synergistic effect of the terpenes being carried over in the product
So the more unadulterated that the pure terpene profile is that's carrying those cannabinoids the better
That's working for me with particular cultivars
That's why I was bringing up those ones that I did those all have a very similar profile
Some of them aren't as loud as others like the bubble so the bubble would probably be the last by itself
But like my mud bone, it's got a higher terpene profile than bubble alone when I crossed it over to the space
It increased some of the grapey
Kush side of it and it got stronger so that works better for me deep chunk is a plant not known to be extremely terpene
Rich, but that plant has a wide cannabinoid profile that can
Hold a little bit of CBD in there
So that'll bring it across and then those are something I would actually would want to breed across to
Say a one-to-one their self to bring that ratio closer to a three to one or four to one or five to one
Or even something that's got CBG also in it or even a THC V the more you can increase that cannabinoid profile
to where they're all closer to a ratio that works for your
One of my goals started interrupt that what by your boy
Yeah, one of my goals is like that was like 2% 2% 2% 2% 2%
Like all the way across the door like all the kind of major cannabinoids I can get
You know what? I mean? Yeah, right everything at 2% just like the ultimate balance like, you know
You know, I started down that journey and maybe I'll get there one day, but I think that's funny
Well, I I know like
It would be really useful. I
Remember talking to Wade louder
Yeah with the can you know?
About basically, you know when he makes medicine he's trying to get the widest range
He's like, I don't know what works and I'm not gonna pretend like I do
I'd rather give someone a little of everything
like
Do you for different scenarios have that kind of broad strategy?
versus other scenarios where you're like
I know exactly what works or generally and like I'm gonna be really tight in my
mix of
terpenes and cannabinoids and other things we were like
I don't know what works but like I'm gonna give you the broadest spectrum of things and
Some of the words we don't quite know what it kind of comes down to the experience of the person that's offering that medicine
Myself when I worked at my club and I had that large base of
extremely medical driven breeding and
Learning from that system on what helps and what works me being the guy that was trying to key in on that
specifically other than
The weed works, you know, cuz that at that time that's what everyone thought we did this it's gonna fix everything
So people just came in and heard a name and picked that shit
But what I was doing was trying to correlate what people were picking and repeatedly picking for the same
Ailments, so what came down to was it wasn't the cultivar that wasn't the cannabinoid
But to me it came down to the terpene profile that carried the cannabinoid that was being passed on
to people that worked the most efficiently
But you can give people a full spectrum of everything and it will help them and that's because we all
Have most of us that are coming into the cannabis scene
Medicinally have a cannabinoid deficiency in their body at some way or another
You don't know which one it is and I can't tell you without a chemical test on your body to let you know
What you could be
Deficient in and what could help you but by giving someone all of them
you're going to be able to raise up the level that they need without ever affecting them by giving them too much of another one because
We're not we don't die from cannabis that shit doesn't fuck us up
We just kind of absorb what was too much of and it starts to not affect us after a while
That's why we build up a tolerance to it. But like I have my
Adopted brother. He's not really adopted
But his family has kind of adopted me through my cannabis work and the information that I shared with him with CBD strains
He's a he's the oldest person that I know of documented that has Dravet syndrome
He's about 24 years old now most of his life he
Wasn't able to vocalize. He wasn't he couldn't do anything
But be put in a wheelchair and driven around and we had a motorized chair. He's went from
Not being able to lift his head up or anything
Not even be able to recognize that he was coherent to what was happening to be able to ride a horse
He's he's been able to eat food
he used to be fed through a feeding tube and it all came down to the use of CBD and
Then they started to steer that shit through terpene profiles that were blended into the CBD's that started helping him to get completely off all
Of his medication for seizures and shit. He was having like 300 seizures a day at a time
So to go from 300 seizures a time to go like he went a whole month with only seven seizures
After he went to CBD like he almost rid his whole life of seizures
First the days
He'll be back
He's back
So you can drive you can do it by giving them
As much like an even baseline of as many cannabinoids and terpenes as you can or you can start steering it for
Patients, so if you're gonna be a true
Medicinal healer and you're gonna use this plant instead of trying to treat as many peaceful as possible
Why not try to steer it to the people that are around you and teach other people to do the same the more people that
Understand how to use this plant to steer it towards the sick people around them
Instead of trying to reach every single person that has that ailment
You're never gonna hit everybody you can only affect the people that are around you
So if you can teach the grandma that's around you that using CBD isn't going to get her high and she can stop her
her arthritis by adding
CBD by her smoking in at first
But then giving her a THC cultivar that's gonna help when she rubs that shit on when she makes a lotion
When she goes from eating an edible that didn't get her high but increase the cannabinoid percentages in her body
You start to teach these people how to drive the actual processes of this plant through the body more efficiently
So is it being passed through the epidural is it going through the blood system?
How are we using it? Even just being in the garden is going to be a benefit to people
There's all kinds of different ways
We can use this plant and instead of trying to reach everyone with it
If we like in my town at a time, there was this little boy named Spencer
Spencer had brain cancer and my partner had bred a line called
ambiguous purple
Appy it was called the appy. It was the ambiguous purple indica and he had this line that tested
Extremely high on CBD. I believe it was at 15% and at one and this was years back before anybody was breeding CBD
He got it tested and it just randomly popped up out of one of his lines
So he kept this line going didn't know why he was gonna do this
And then one day he finds out through a guy that did business through my collective
That this child needed to have CBD access and there was nobody in town fucking with CBD and he knew his plant had it
So they started to give that kids parents
Access to tinctures made from the CBD his brain cancer started to swell
He started our to to go away started to get better
the tumor started to shrink the little kid was fucking getting better and then my town went and
busted the dude and his family that we had given the clone to
So that they could produce it on a larger level because this guy in my area was really loud about growing cannabis
Legally and it being in a medicine
So at my time we were able to grow 99 plants in our area if you had a script
So he literally had a garden with 99 plants in it out here and he was having sections grown for true
Medicine that he was taken to multiple different collectives mine and others so that that child and others could access it
Based on the location they lived in our area because we had 27 collectives here. So a person that lived in one area
Didn't have to drive an hour and a half to a place to get medicine for their child
He would drop it off at the closest place to him
So if you were sick here and there was a shop within a like 10 mile radius
He made sure there was some of the medicine that that spot for you to get and he was doing that on the clone that
My buddy provided to him. So it came down to that child was getting a better life
And then one day when they bust that guy they cut down all 99 of his plants
They're all got all the weed and fucking processing so they can bust him
It's was still there until just recently when he won the case and I'm talking like six years
He's been going in fighting these people over the same case and in that time period Spencer died
Because he could not have access to a high CBD strain
because no one here was producing it because the only thing that was hot at that time was cookies and
Fucking like white widow like it was club weed like whatever was hot
They were reading about the club had to produce so they could make money to stay open
Because they weren't really here to help the sick people
They were just here to pretend like they were part of a system to get weed legalizers
We've all found out is true to all of us that were sick and doing this for medicinal purposes
So they all found out the hard way that you're gonna lose your best friend. You're gonna lose your grandma
You're gonna lose the kid around the street. Oh
so you could have a shiny brand and
Because you wouldn't produce the medicine that would help the people around you. So you should always ask the person
I can't have you used anything already
But what what are you looking for?
What are you trying to treat you should try to break this thing down like an old-school doctor from the West man that did that
Fucking gave he came and delivered your mom
He delivered you and he knew your grandma since she was a little girl, right?
He knew that you guys were all allergic to fucking strawberries and you couldn't be out in the Sun a long time, right?
He knew what was going on because he was an actual medicine man
He cared about the people that he was helping because he can't make money without anybody, you know, if you're all dead
He's broke as well. Yeah, so
It's just the way I think it's the way instead of giving people a fish
which is what we're all doing with Instagram and just passion a pack of seeds without
Responding to the person when they talk to you or finding out what they're looking for in their garden
Like not just does it need to finish early and make THC?
But like are you really gonna help your grandma with this plant or are you using this herb to help your son?
Like why did you decide to hit me up for this plant?
Why I will help you
And if it's because you truly are sick or you're dying or something I can help you I give it to you
Or I send it to you or one of the people like I say on dog of love all the people that came before me
Like there might be a breeder on there that carries a line
That's cost more than mine or it's cheaper than mine or whatever like hit him up
Get the seeds from him and then show me you did it and I'll send you some of mine too if it breaks down like
Whatever it's gonna help you is better for me. I've done that so many times
Yeah, I've sent people to go buy my buddy's gear and then just tell them send me the receipt
Just show me you did it and I'll send you some shit back man
Like just just support the people that are actually out here trying to help you
Better your life for someone else's besides just getting paid because getting paid is easy, man
You could grow anything big and fat and fucking sell it if you know how to hype yourself up
But to truly help someone that's done I every year every year like I look at you know
I look at my CVD stuff or my you know, my CVD stuff or my multi-candid only thing whatever I'm gonna do
You know and I every year I like, you know
Pick it up and I'll put it down and and I'll come back and I'll pick it up
You know, I'm not having it because it's always you know, it's not the funnest thing to
To grow to smoke to you know, everybody wants to go Ken's and fucking cool shit, right?
You know, you know this shiny runs or whatever, you know what?
I mean you got stuff but you know
I always I always take a step back and I always like now I gotta do I gotta do this cuz if I don't do
It then I won't be able to find it and you know, yeah, I always
randomly I'll need it and I always just just to
Make sure that I continue those types of lines and I work those things so that somebody can have it
Happens all the time. Oh shit. I got to here you go. It's like it's like the best thing in their life, you know
And it takes work to breed always it's work and it's like yeah
Like it's gonna take up space, you know what I mean? It's like
Breeding that CVD and CVG over is gonna be a recessive trade
So it takes work to put that on to aligned and carry over the terpene profile
Because you don't know what the fuck it is, what is the level I mean how much
I mean you can't you can't quantify that by smoking it or looking at it or
Tasting it or any of that shit, you know, so like it takes it takes a lot more work. It takes a lot more money
Actually
I'm sorry, you know and they open it up and it's this fucking brown just like it's like
you're like
Man, you know and it's literally that is how it is. It's not
Well, let me ask this question all three of us are in California
What was your favorite year?
Just for the weed industry in California like
Because for me it's certainly not this year it's not last year it was like 2015 2016
When it was just like
Right when the emerald when like when
when Jackson fucking won the Emerald Cup and
It was like the scene there was fucking cool as fuck man
Like everybody was brothers and sister a couple years later as you start seeing chick start turning to brands like big-time branding on
Everything not that people had brands but like everyone showing up with a hoodie
That's got everything plastered on it and like they're pushing theirself from the moment. They they pass through the gate
It turned different a few years later
But it wasn't that way
But even stuff like dispensaries could have like the big jars of bud you you could be a home grower
And bring flour into a shop and like they'd be like we want your weed
That happened here for me, but it's happened slightly earlier than that in the Bay Area probably around
2005 six it started hopping
Down there when like harborside and stuff started hitting hard
I'm trying to remember when I was going down to uh
Like when Kenny from tricones dropped a fucking purple cush on them down at the Bulldog sr-71
Here, that's where
car
Colorado or Washington the year before
Washington went like legal like the big like shit like Colorado or Washington. They're like going legal, right?
That was like the year Washington it was like the year before that was like the magical time like for me and like
Defense breeze were open there you could go in there and smoke in there and like you could just bring shit
Backpack like everybody was cool, and there was no like no it was just like everything was flowing
But it was like it was right then because all all the people that I knew
Like around here as soon as Washington, you know was getting ready to tip over
You know something like that right here like right then all my friends left and now it's fucking Washington everybody
Everybody's migrating for legal cannabis what they believes coming and then it always changes once they get
Cali to Oklahoma now
Left Cali
It's around 2012 Cali said fuck it because everybody started like everyone in their grandma had a plant in the backyard and was trying to
Sell it for 3200 a pound to every fucking club in town like literally my town had
200,000 people in the whole area we had 27 clubs, right?
There's no way 27 clubs can be supported by the laws at that time which were 215 just before they switched out 215
That's when the Golden Age fucking died when people could just come in
You could be driving around with all the weed you wanted in the back of your truck and show up at any place that had
A fucking fucking Golden Cross or a Green Cross on it and fucking be like hey, I got 25 pounds in the back, man
I'll take two thousand a pound for all of it, right and people are giving you cash money right out the back door
And they couldn't do shit about it. It was crazy as hell. What was going on there?
We were moving a hundred clones every day to fucking multiple people some days
We were moving a thousand cuts out the back door and we would run out of clones and couldn't sell no more
Like would there be a line of people and then they'd want to know where they could go get a hundred more cuts
Because the city was letting them buy 99 plants a day like they weren't tracking it
We tried to tell them let's put a system in where we can track every patient through a number
That way they can like for the season you want them to have 99 plants once they've bought 99
They can't buy no more right this will be a way for you to track them
We won't give you their name or their address, but their their patient number will be tagged to a system
We can tell you how much herb they buy in a day
Like we tried to buy a police officer in town and not buy one but offer
To pay the salary for two different police officers, so there would be someone to patrol our areas and
So the collectives wouldn't get robbed and shit. They wouldn't do nothing with us
We tried so many different things because of the way the system was set up like now
Everything's regulated to the ninth degree and during the 215 days
The only thing was regulated was you buying a fucking business license, right?
You go down to the city with $100
They gave you a business license
And if you could pay the rent the lights
You were fucking golden right and everyone thought there was a secret to this and all you had to know was some business skills
How people skills and how to fucking make sure you don't have that jar of dust blowing off there when somebody needed some CBD
Right if you could figure out a way to market anything
Through the system you were golden no matter what it was
So who cares if ten people came to you with Bubba as long as you?
Understood that everybody needed this kind of weed for this particular ailment
You could have called it platinum Bubba golden Bubba Bubba's dream
Whatever the fuck you wanted and just tell your patients what it was like you guys all brought us 10 fucking pounds of Bubba
How do I offer it all back to you is just Bubba?
So we gave you all a different name and we tell everyone what the fuck it is and you guys can decide based on the
Way, it looks which one you're gonna buy so now when we run out of the dudes top-shelf Bubba
We go call him back
but we don't call the dude on the bottom back cuz that motherfucker was growing and fucking some well man and
Fucking phosphorus on it 24-7 and ended up with some fucking crispy ass. Hey, right?
That's how you found out who could grow like who was really doing it with this only because someone that was sick
Did not just fucking grow the worst fucking herb in the world
They were trying to make sure what they grew happened efficiently so they didn't have to buy club prices for herb no more, right?
Nobody can afford fifty dollars an eighth when they're smoking an eighth of fucking day
You're gonna grow broke fucking spending all your fucking money on weed and not have a home by the end of the month
I mean you fuck your kitty cat will have a house, but you won't you'll be shitting in the cat box
It fucking tripping when cannabis prices were crazy man
People were paying fucking twenty five dollars a gram plus taxes in the 215 days for the best herb
So when you had a shop that was able to set up growers with clones and tell them here
We need people to grow we need a hundred pounds of bubble for the year, right?
We don't care if it's the best bubble or the bottom bubble because someone wants bubble
So as long as I got some eighths of over that I can sell for 15
I don't have to sell a bunch of bubble for 50 or 60 dollars an eighth, right?
Because the people are gonna come in and pay whatever they can afford on that day
Which is usually not enough to cover your medicinal habits or even if you just want to get fucking high
Right $15 of some booty-ass weed means you got to go back and spend $15 for some more booty-ass weed when you
Know whatever cause my weed crispy ass. Hey
Hey
Pretendo for a reason there is a reason they call that shit that I mean people were showing up with the nastiest looking herb
Thinking they had the best shit in the world just because it had a name on it
Like I bought the clone from you
Why won't you pay 3200 a pound right because you used fucking miracle growing cement to grow it in the fuck is wrong with you
I got people that are dying and you want me to sell them poison, right and people didn't understand that shit
They just thought it's weed weed fixes everything
Yeah, until people started getting sick from fucking with weed
Like I did did people start to believe that the practices that we put on the plant affect what comes from the plant
People just thought it's weed. It's gonna do what we does and yeah, it does
But like we could spray paraquat on it and fuck hippies up too. That's what they used to do
And now we just got new paraquat that's called Eagle 20 and shit right and have it same shit
You're spraying some shit. You shouldn't smoke on some weed and passing it to your dad and granny
Yeah, and that's fucked up and there's a way to change that and make it easier
We all know we can grow better weed in living soil
Then anybody can porn a recipe of synthetic salts on the plant and trying to repeat this process month after month after month
when you could have just spent a few months building some soil and
Growing that shit for a long time by just doing some soil tests and adding what you need back to it
Learning how to like Brandon said earlier biohack the system
There's products you can put in an organic system to make what's in there available
Just quit trying to pile drive that shit because all you end up doing is fucking somebody up
It's that's what it is. Don't be the hacksaw Jim Duggan of the cannabis industry out there
You carry the fucking two by four that you grew
It is reference there's no fucking weed on this stick that you're carrying around which
When I drink some bids to you
You're gonna smoke these 22s. That's like Tommy get the fuck out of here. What the fuck are you bringing to me?
I know mean gene and he don't grow no from tumbleweed son
He grows root beer, but he ain't growing on the board you got over there son the fuck is wrong with you
I done met mean gene. He says you're out of here motherfucker
This is ridiculous
and if nobody shares that like it's like the guy that
Grew giant pumpkins right and he ends up giving seeds to his neighbors who were growing giant pumpkins
But his pumpkins were the best pumpkins in the area. So instead of hoarding them and risking the
Pollination of his pumpkins with some inferior pumpkins from his neighbor
He gives his neighbor some of the pumpkins and he knows they're good pumpkins. So when they pollinate his pumpkins
To worry about shit
He knows they're not gonna grow him as good because they're just relying on what's on the back of the pack and not the informational
That's grounded in the soil. That's what a farmer does once he understands how to talk back to the plant in the soil
Does the seed that he holding his hand produce a champion genetic, right?
You can bring it out of any plant if you understand what to do bring his potential out
Just just quit pile driving that shit. Hacks off
Yeah, I always love doing that man, I told I told I told when B plants or
Finicky plants or plants are just fucking just are pissy, you know, it's like the plant is just pissy
I'm like, all right, I'll fucking kill you and I'll steal your genetics
Yeah, I will I will breed it back into something strong, you know, I mean, you know, you see it
I tell you know, hey, you know shape it up and I don't
And
Sometimes it's not the Jeanette
Sometimes it's just that one fucking phenotype like if anybody's been watching the build a soil videos that have been on YouTube Jeremy from build
The soil he's been doing some videos and he's got a plant in his garden in there that he's been treating like all the rest
But one of them said fuck you. I don't like this amount of water and has turned into a finicky ass
Yellow purple stemmed fucking plant and it's not deficient. It's just having issues with
The right and in that system most people would say fuck this plant chop it down
They cuss it out instead of using some positive vibes to try to reverse
Perspective and go what what did I do wrong?
Because in nature that plant might have been cold by nature, but we're farming
So why don't we take it as a challenge and go? What did I do?
What can I fix in this situation to make it better right now and or do like you're saying?
Breed it into something that I know works. Maybe I cross it to this thing. There you go. There's the giant pumpkin
This is Ron Wallace who's actually in Rhode Island
So if you're gonna grow a pumpkin that big and everyone else next to you got jack-o'-lantern sized shit
What would you do?
Would you just hope that your fence line keeps them little jack-o'-lantern sized mother fucking pollen grains off your property?
Or would you go pass some giant pumpkin seeds to your friends make some new neighbors?
And in a few years just continue to outgrow them until they finally come and say what the fuck are you doing that?
I'm not and he's like I'm farming. You're just buying seeds homie. Here's some more buy another pack
right learn to do something with what you got instead of just
Relying on what the guy says in them because we can all say that the plants gonna do something
But it doesn't mean it's gonna do it in your situation
If you're running green lights in your garden with a temperature of 102 degrees and you only water on Tuesdays
Your shits gonna die right? That's just what the fuck's gonna happen. And that's phenotypical expression
That's just what's going on
Some people do that shit man
The guys that I worked for my fucking club
The first day that I went to the garden that they had set up they had rented this house because the way our city was
That you had to rent in this certain area. There was only certain buildings. So they rented a house that was available
They had went and cut out
The kitchen and the garage and put a wall in and then put a fucking giant air
Conditioning unit in the wall that they built right there and had it in the house
They didn't build it on an exterior wall
They put the air conditioner on the wall that was over the linoleum thinking they could just mop the linoleum up
Right, and when I get over to the house, I'm like, what the fuck is this and they're like, that's the air conditioner
I'm like the air conditioner goes on the outside. What the fuck are you guys talking about?
I walk in there and they got 72 cups 16 ounce cups with plants dried to a bone crispy as fuck
They look like toothpicks that someone had put that green shit on the end like comes on your sandwich and shit
I'm green and orange toothpicks and shit. That's what all these plants look like in the cups dead as a motherfucker
These guys couldn't grow a beard if they needed to let alone some cannabis plants there
They fucked the whole place up dude. That house had to be completely gutted and remodeled when they left. It was insane
I couldn't believe what these guys had done just from trying to take information that they had seen
Off of either internet posts or shit
They heard at parties because they told the boss that they'd grown before all because their friend had grown
So they tried to pass off information bro style to the fucking dude and he listened to him thinking I'm gonna sell weed, right?
It's easy to sell weed and the next thing you know
These dudes were fucking selling $400 worth of weed a week in a club in California
I'm like, what did you can make more than that shit with your eyes closed at the park, son?
The fuck is wrong with you $400 and a club in the state of California and it's legal. What are you doing?
Right. I made a call next thing, you know, I'm selling quarter pounds a day out of the place and they're like
What in the fuck are you doing? I'm like, I'm just telling the potheads. We got weed
What are you guys doing?
Like they were going around with flyers putting it on cars at fucking
Motels and shit hoping people would show up to buy weed at the shop. I'm like, dude, they think you're crackheads
What the fuck is wrong with you? You guys suck pull your pants up put something on the window
The fucking advertise on the radio or something the fuck is wrong with you guys, man
Like at least put the word out with the right people
There's certain cats in this in this fucking this town that you can tell that there's some weed out here and they're gonna show up
And tell their friends like you just say purple of the right dude and we can sell a pound in two days, right?
There they couldn't believe it right they came from Vallejo and show up to this little
They start whispering everybody
The wind blows it out. See you know and fast whisper, you know, but good
I
Mean it was fast either. We used to carry at least 25 different
strains or
different tiers of strain
So one of them might have 12 or 14 selections and then the next one had a 5 or 10
And then the bottom one have three or four
So anyone that could come in could get something off of that
fucking shelf and be able to afford it man or even get something for free like if you were dying you could come in and
We had shit set aside for you like literally didn't matter
If you were if you had cancer and dying
We had ounces of bubba that you could come pick and it wasn't no bottom shelf shit
We were like here you go
The vendor had to give us this amount because he was vending this amount through us and since he could produce this large amount
With the only way we'll take it and pay him is if he brings us some for free because at that time we were paying
3,200 a pound and he you would get half your money when you drop the herb off and
With it as soon as we sold a quarter pound you got the rest of your money and then the rest was on us
What we paid our farmers up front and then people started getting mad like how come you can't pay all of it
I'm like, dude, I just bought 22 pounds a day
Where am I supposed to come up with $32,000 today to pay you a fucking an extra $200, homie?
Like you could come in on Tuesday next week and I'll pay you the rest of your money
100% like they just didn't get it at the time because they weren't looking at it as business. They were looking at it as like
Fucking this is my income. I have to make this one. It's like dude. I didn't hire you homie. That's not how this worked
This is just not how 215 was set up
Well that gets back to my question about kind of the the best years
Back in the day. Yes
2003 2006 2008 those are all good years man. It's all good years
For me, you know, I don't know about anybody else. Those are some good years
for for we
Limonsol and bull riders and p91
Fuckin og came through at that point. I fucking
Now
Nice but we got weird
Where's my damn joint there it is fucking lose my joint every time I set it down
Growing years for me my best growing years would have been 87 88 just before we got busted the first time
Because the weed I was growing then I would trade every cultivar
I've had since then for those plants at that time all of them
No, even for just one of them like the one I call eggplant
I would trade everything I've ever came in contact with for that plant back
everything I
Mean that that thing was
magnificent
We got all these p91 teeth my my one of my best friends and we're kid is older sister
One of the dudes were tied into the p91 or whatever
It's a San Diego, you know killer strange table fucking badass fucking
But anyway that power
Yeah, it's fucking. Yeah, it's the real deal
We used to get wet ashes of it and it was like some of the best shit ever just because we were tied in with
with his sister and
all of her other older friends were tied in with the same people and then we
We actually got some seeds at one time and my buddy, you know, he grew some out that window and
Fuck man. I mean they all were like the same plant
They all look like the same fucking plan like five or six months, but they're all like through the same
All like smell pretty damn. I mean from my memory of being a kid they all like really looked
Identical and we used to talk about that and man. I wish we had I wish I had that back
That would just make me make me happy camper again
But it is what it is man. We can wish all day. We got making the cool, you know, that's what's fun
And talk talk about the g13
Because that's what Tyler or Travis included
Yeah, that's what's in my my cookie crumbs I'm doing some test germinations on that I use the 88 g13 hash plant to make
milk and cookies
Which is the Girl Scout Forum crossed a DG 13 hash plant and then I recrossed that to my angel which gives me cookie crumbs
I'm doing some tests on those right now that that that 88 g13 hash plant for me
is
She's killer for breeding a lot of what Tyler said comes across
She can allow some of that the female side to show and structure and stuff, but it brings this powerful
high and terpene profile that's
Unmistakably 88 g13 hash plant it comes out of there
It adds so much girth to plants and you don't think it would because the plant itself
doesn't grow in that
Scene offer
He'll be back
Are you still here?
Are you back we we missed everything you just said
She was the 88 g13 hash plant was the male I used when I made cookie crumbs cookie crumbs is a
Forum Girl Scout crossed the 88 g13 hash plant
I took a phenol from that cross and made what I call cookie crumbs by crossing it to angel male
So that plant grows very dense
The terpene profiles come across as what I call like meaty like beef jerky and stew kind of shit in tobacco
It's crazy the terpene profile that comes off that 88 g13 hash plant. She's
A more of an open structure. She looks like she has more of a leaf to calyx ratio than you'd think when she's growner
but when she breeds out some
extremely beautiful plants
That have to send you a picture of my milk and cookies, but I don't know if I have it on my laptop
That plant grows use that thing. That's a
Plant is that the same plan? Is that all a clone or those different?
No, it's a seed line that comes through from Indian guy that
People extended he passed that line so that it would be given away for free and not used as a profit and some people have
Made f2 sold them and some people like Tyler's offering those for free and some of his crosses
It's a killer plant. It's old-school stuff the 88 g13 has got g33
G13 cross the hash plant done in 1988. So it's a very old line
Bodies using what he calls the gash mail out of there. So it's a real gassy and hashy
That's what comes out of that's what I get out of almost all of that shit more
Hashy and earthy then kerosene and gas for me like an OG gas
Those are more gassy than say the g13 hash plant. It has a real serrated blade
It's more of a instead of extremely broad leaf. It's a more of a thin
Serrated leaf then didn't say like my mud bone that I showed on here earlier. That's a real wide
Leaf to cultivar like the deep chunk. She's she's got a smaller bud set more looking like a
Let's see closer to the bubble than my mud bone so the bud set stays on her smaller and rounder
thinner leaf
But my cross of the
What is it milk and cookies is the exact same cross Bodhi did with his more cowbell. It's the
Girl Scout crossed a DG 13 hash, but that's why I never released that line
I only gave out 10 packs of mine because Bodhi had already dropped it and mine was in testing
So I I didn't want to step on this shoes, you know bodies. I 100% respect boat is breeding this shit ain't no way
I want to try to fucking challenge him for any kind of seed sales on the line when you know
So I he dropped more cowbell and I just put my shit on the shelf. I
Used it to make cookie crumbs instead
So, do you see that
Yeah, space cheese at number 2 f2
That's the testing I did on the f2s myself right now
Testing seven of the new space cheese crosses or I've got them out in testing I finished the
Cherry pie space cheese and the space cheese number 2 f2 myself
So that's the mail from the space cheese when he's outside
When it's cold
he produces a stream as amount of resin and a lot of anthocyanin that was a left him outside between
November and
February I pulled him out at the end of February
I wanted to see how long I could keep him outside to see if he tried to read beds
Or is he's just gonna mold up and die. I had to literally kill this fucking plant
He would not die for nothing stayed stable all the way through
And just showing that res production they can come from
Space cheese number two that number two was in the video. I show there's the number two
It was also in the video on the right side
When I was on there earlier the one we showed
Yeah, that's the number for the number four slightly larger
She grows a taller structure on the plant, but they produce the same amount of herb
like almost
Identical on the weight that's gonna come from each plant
Even the two is gonna be a shorter structure for people that are trying to have a more stealth grow
They're both gonna finish in between eight to nine weeks. I
Would take them 60 to 60
66 maximum on those
They handle cold extremely well
They don't mold very easily it's a attributed to both the
Chi the blue cheese side and to my angel angel
Was a plant that did not
The plant on the right is the number two right there and the one on the left the number four
So that's the mother to the plant you just saw
The one on the very left one more that one's the space cheese number four right here
They're both large leaf
shorter squatty plants
In the back. I got OG's going
Sfe triangle Kim for and Congo Roberts Creek Congo
in the front there space cheese
Kim for
court space cheese
Star dog Kim D and space cheese. There's a Kim D
How close is that cam for to the to the dog walker?
Cuz then I know that the dog walker was made with the cam for I mean, yeah, they're very close to the structure man
They're real close to the structure and smell is all is all Kim for but that dog walker has this weird
What I call poly log water funk in the back that comes from that Walker side
But
She's real hard on the Kim side the way she comes through
It's like depending on your grow
You might get all Kim to come through on her just like you said you had grown her in three different locations
Like you might just get that weird funk and not get none of the Kim to come through depending on you grower
For me I get a lot of that hard Kim
Cushy OG what everyone thinks of when they're smoking that shit almost decently mix in there and then she's nice
But she she's got that funky ass fucking like I said poly walk water in the back that it's almost like the
GMO has like that halitosis shit. There's a funk in the back of her when she's grown, right?
That you it's like almost unmistakable. You're like, whoa
Most sharp that GMO sharper, you know that the dog walker for sure like darker
It's like a dark like it really is
Some funky
Yeah, you know but it's like it's in a good like rich oh
We're looking for poly walkway, you know, yeah, it's weird. Yeah, it's weird to say that but we are
100%
Looking a man. It's it's
I think yeah
Yeah, the GMO I put her in there the GMO stretches more
She has more of the spaced out nugs on her on the GMO like the bud
They're spaced out on the nodes farther apart
It's more of a round base to the bud with a point where the dog walker will make more of a full spear. It's hard
Without seeing them next to each other. It's hard for people to probably understand that the
the Kim side
Like I said, once they start getting that micro deficiency
They'll show on the edges would almost look like windburn or
Like almost over fertilization
Which for me didn't really show as hard in the dog walker as it does in the Kim for?
The Kim for will show that a lot more kind of like the Kim D will start to variegate depending on the micronutrient levels
The dog walker just doesn't show that same
That exact same thing
Yeah
She's less finicky too I would say she's gonna hold herself up better
She doesn't vine like the growth isn't as viney up. She almost has a that's Christmas tree structure that you can
She's got good frame to her. She holds herself up. I don't have to cater very, you know, very much
I mean a little support is always
Even when I get her going big like out in the orchard outside full term
I mean, she's a good strong sturdy stout fucking plant
She takes you on the route, you know, she's like one of my longest friggin rooters of all the
Once you root fast, but everything everything really really really really good
Fucking wait till you try to root the ghost. Oh gee
Take you like a few fucking months to get that thing to drop roots. Do ghost. Oh gee
Bubba and what else is a fire? Oh gee all three of those are gonna fucking give you they'll make you think you don't know
How to clone any?
Same with deep chunk those those four plants I would put into anyone's hands that
If once you can get those to clone you should be able to clone your grandma, you know what I'm saying?
Like
No joke that that the fire OG cut like it takes it forever
The only thing that I've seen take as long as that was the ghost like when I got the ghost it took me
Six weeks to get it to set roots and shit. It was sent to me
It's just a slip with no roots
It took six weeks to get that thing to root and then I had to get her mothered up
It took a year before I could get her to start dropping roots
All the time on the cuttings. I mean, you know, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I mean, I'm not gonna lie
I'm on the cuttings. I mean she she takes stress so fucking hard
It's insane like and she's gonna show it in either
three-fingered leaves or she's gonna not fucking root for you or she's gonna all of a sudden start dumping obsessive acid and the
Branches are literally gonna snap the fuck off in the middle of flower
Like if you try to breed with her and don't have your micronutrients right on that ghost. Oh gee
You're gonna waste half the fucking round
Picking branches up off the ground cussing yourself out because you didn't fucking brace her or you fucking you just relied on top dressing with
Her ass and shit. It's like dude that girl right there and she's a fucking
She's gonna point you in a direction in your room to teach you about what you're fucking up on certain plants
Like the purple stems on some plants that girl all of a sudden like she'll she'll start spitting three fingers
And one of them is gonna have a split in the middle and she and then the fucking the branches on the bottom all fall
You're like, oh fuck my pH is jacked and nitrogen is too high and I'm fucking locking up magnesium in this girl. I'm screwed
I need a transplant like three weeks ago
What the fuck I was doing slipping
Real man and in organic they're chasing that shit
Once you that one of that that og does that you are chasing it so hard that
Like people will transplant and give her one week and go into flower and now you're fucked and now you got to plant
That's fighting everything. She's got too much nitrogen her system
She starts to throw her morphidites because the fucking amount of nitrogen that you did leave in her
I mean you fucked her up people are like well
You gave me a shitty ass cut
Dude, let me see the plants are going like just send me some pictures real quick
You start breaking down what you're seeing and they don't believe you. You're like, ah, motherfucker. I know this plant
I know what she's doing. I know something's going wrong
And then they come clean with you and you're like, how'd you know that?
Just like you said you knew that was some kind of cookies in that
Brantley plant that was branching weirder with experience
You'll recognize certain shit because you just don't have any option
The plant talks to you so hard that you have no option but to listen right and when that shit happens
It's you didn't master anything besides not failing, you know, you quit failing on something now
You don't have to practice that that shit anymore because it comes second nature to you
Every woman wants is a man who will listen to her
Mary Jane man, she's gonna teach you what you need to know. I tell everybody that shit. She'll teach you what you need to know
Man Mary Jane, she's my main thing fucking a Rick James saying the song correctly
I
Fucking don't try to ask me to sing it cuz you guys will tune out real fast
Well, wait Tyler. Did you allude earlier to the fact that you play the guitar?
Yeah
Yeah, I play all kinds of shit with strings bro, that's one of my
That's one of my things, you know, I think I think you need to strum
Yeah, I would I will one of these days I mean I can't I can't this moment I wish I had my
You know the wall yeah, but I if I go in there then I am locked in like locked in there's no way to go
But we can set some up I'll play something man you can so what kind of do you I mean
What have you been playing on more recently like?
Acoustic guitar electric guitar
Classical
Guitar
My
most of my young
Like 20 which spent like touring and like doing rock and roll
You know around like the Southwest and like random stuff like that
Climate crisis is one of my bands Kings only Kings and King only a couple of things that we used to do where we used
to do stuff it was like a rock band with King
Kings only was a rock band with the trumpet playing like
Guitar lines, so it was like a unique thing with this. Could we reunite the band?
I was last time you talked to all the other people in the band. Well couple of them can't reunite
They're down under you know what I mean, but a couple of them are
There's there's been talk of a new band
Remarking a re-emerging so out of those bands climate crisis and Kings only the one constant was my guitar player
My one of my one of my best friends Michael is a really exactly he's actually a professional like guitar player for me
He's a teacher. He does stuff sponsored by Mad Hatter
They have like different types of pickups and things that he sells and does stuff so check out Mike Ruggiero guitar
Cool, dude, badass one of the greatest guitar players I've ever seen like no doubt
Hands down
But yeah, so like basically yeah, I mean
We did that and then me and him did acoustic this is acoustic duet
We did this acoustic duet called shotline drive we did all kinds of shit and and
There's some climate crisis stuff deep on
YouTube with some live shows that like house of blues and there's some shotline drive random things here there, but
We're talking about my kids get a little older I am going to start playing again
Between plants and kids and life
So
What one of my friends I just found out is the chairman of Gibson guitars
No way, so I want to be like dude. You need to you need to give us like a monthly
$1,000 $2,000 budget to have bands play on a weed YouTube show and I guarantee you it'll be good for Gibson
so that that's
I'm gonna reach out to him and then and then I have a friend from
Growing up who do you know the band dispatch?
You heard of them at all
They're an East Coast band, but my friend Chad from like
Kindergarten through sixth grade is basically the lead singer and I had no idea he was in a band
And then I remember when I was living in New York
This was like 2000 2001
Now probably a little later than that
But I I like bought a random DVD and it was a concert of this band dispatch in the Boston Commons
And there were like a hundred thousand people at the concert
And then I was like, holy shit, that's Chad
The lead singer in front of a hundred thousand people and I had no idea he was in a band
And here comes mr. Again
Yeah, so music man, it's like just like me and you it goes it goes deep, you know
So one of these days I'll break something out
So we're either gonna get you solo or we're gonna get the band back together
Yeah, I mean, you know I can do some ABC songs some dinosaur rhymes
Itsy bitsy spider went up the water spat down came the rain and washes
You know, yeah, I
Know all the two-year-old hits
We make up stuff all the time it's fun
Yeah, that's what I do a Gemma
and to hear like a
Six-year-old like freestyle just making shit up and she's listening to like
You know like a Rolling Stones song in the car or something I'm like fuck yeah
My my my three-year-old a while back he used to do the
Stupidest thing he's the we are farmers from that I don't think that
You feel like you feel like stutter, you know
I mean, he's not he's super he was super young two or three and like it was but that was it
That was what he was doing. It was hilarious
Couple times. Oh my god, it's that commercial or something
Hearing a freestyle hilarious
And look he didn't break out for the three loco song we are farmers dude
I
Are farmers did and it sounds it starts off almost exactly like that
For real
Riff-raff, that's who it is riff-raff dirt nasty and Andy Melanoc is dude three loco. We are farmers
So I
Yeah, I'm gonna try to get some music going I have
Yeah, and I'm psyched of it if certain things
Go ahead. Oh, I was just thinking about fucking hitting up my boy Danny and then when seeing if they want to do any kind
Of reggae on here. I know a whole bunch of reggae artists, man
They're all from the Virgin Islands Danny. I pressure army fucking let's get so Clinton
Fearon just got back to me
Who's awesome and I
Want to be like
Because it's basically like do you want to come and just play music in front of a bunch of super high people who are super
appreciative
But there will be a lot of them
So what you just try to tell anybody that's doing any kind of
Like an event or someone any artists that you guys know that are already doing something to see if they'll stream it on
The show here instead of just setting something up if they're already doing something
It would be easy for him to set up a fucking tripod and just have it going during the
Actual live event because a lot of people are doing live event streaming, but so they're at their home set up doing that shit. So
There's nothing to put in another extra camera right there point it there. Oh, no
I mean that that's that's what I say to all these people. I'm like I
watched your
amazing
musical whatever and you had like
It's like three weeks after and you've had like a hundred and fifty people watch it and
like we have a lot more than that and
They'd be totally psyched to hear you play
Okay, man
If they go from 100 to 8,000 people because if you start seeing you get from like twelve hundred
Ten thousand people watching some of the videos here. That's a lot of new people that may have never heard
That's my whole point it's it's an easy pitch it's just I
Don't think people are really paying attention. I'm like just look at the channel
Look at any super boring video and it has like 10,000 people who have watched it. Imagine you're like
our lungs like reggae set Clinton fear on
so
That's what I'm worried, but then I get distracted by other shit and I forget about it and then I'm like, oh wait
I wanted music like let me go back and like reach out to those people
But we'll get some good music
Music's awesome people fucking especially during all this Kovach it if they can't be doing live events like
This is a way for them to get out there. Like they got a practice. I'd like my boy Danny
I know I used to go to the band practices with him
we'd go down to Grass Valley and like all the band members would meet up at one of the Ross the house and
They just get down and groove and shit like even the live feed from a practice is better than nothing
Like that's people seeing how you get down that your groove your your your whole fucking thing, right?
And someone might pick up on you just from that. It doesn't have to be you
I've been like look even when you guys just get together to rehearse like we'll take that like we're not picky
Yeah, because it's like the people like deadheads and shit man. They're not just there because of the music
They're there because of the whole scene and shit. They're there because they like the vibe of those people and shit, man
So when people can see how you guys get down
People are gonna be more attracted to you than just hearing like your first fucking your first track off your album every time
I mean
If you went to a dead show and you got to like hang out
Backstage with them while they rehearse a couple of songs with like 30 other people
You'd be much more psyched than if you watch the actual concert
You'd be in Birkenstocks and swim shorts in no time dude fucking getting burnt and skin and shit dreadlocks and chillin, homie
Be faster than fuck. That's that's how they got. That's how they got all of them. They catch that and good weed
Fuck I mean
like you can only hear the same song a thousand times, but the rest of the scene is what you keep coming back for and
Then eventually you're part of the scene and that's what you're there for
Like that's what that's why fucking you get fans and shit that like for any kind of thing
You want to be part of the action and shit?
That's why people get into fucking NASCAR too far someone's in it like us. We're breeding cannabis way too fucking hard
We shouldn't be sitting there like look at this
We're in a room with a light schedule for a fucking rain like we're not the only ones right now the lights turned out on
Them motherfuckers. It's crazy
so a lot of people turn that shit out at 9 and went to bed because they got to get up with fucking 7 and
Like our shits turning off when the plants had turned off
Then like we all have a specialization that we want to get into our hobby becomes too much of a hobby
And it either becomes healthy and you share it with others or become something that has you fucking stuck in a corner
Reading shit on the internet that may or may not be true that you never like throw it another motherfucker to see what's up
Like did I swear this shit up and down then your buddies like no, dude. I made that shit. What are you talking about?
I've had this shit before you were born. No, no, no
Like my buddy was at the dead show that brought this fucking weed in 2007. He was there
I'll show you got the story fucked up stories fucked up, brother
He was right next to Bob Snodgrass
My uncle when he when the story starts my uncle just punch him in the fucking face and tell him to quit smoking your weed
You fucking you too high dude. You fucking your uncle had better weed than me, huh? Where's your fucking uncle?
Let me talk to this fucking drunk. I bet your uncle drinks too much weed, huh? Or too much alcohol
He don't even smoke weed, but he was there, huh? You fucking jackass. Come here
Let me introduce you to hacksaw Jim Duggan he's over here
He's gonna pile some facts into you real quick
like
Wrestlers who had like two moves and there were totally non athlete like Hulk Hogan did not have an athletic move in his arsenal
Except for the fucking point at the sky and the ear shit. That's it. Once that happened
I don't he had some kind of death wish with the devil cuz that dude was not the best wrestler out there man for real
He was dressed like a mustard can do what the fuck?
Like a bright yellow not even Dijon
You had the ultimate warrior even had hacksaw Jim Duggan you got all these other fuckers and they're pushing it fucking
Hulk Hogan on us and shit. Fuck that shit, dude
Macho, man was so much better than
Coco beware
Coco beware all the motherfuckers do but we're getting pushed on fucking Hulk Hogan Terry
We got a dude named Terry getting pushed on us with his hairs receding so far
What the fuck's going on? They're the Dias beard cuz they had no hair to die on this motherfucker
They're passing off this mustard can honest dude. Fuck that shit Brutus the barber beefcake
Fucking a dude Brutus the dude you're going way back now 80s 80s
shit
Fucking dusty roads
The one of the ultimate warriors since there was like 37 of them but most of them were awesome miss Elizabeth
Well, that's why macho man was better because he had a woman with him and shit
All the other wrestlers had like a dog or a bird or a chain or a snake
Macho man showed up with a human. That's why he was better than
The heart Brett now it wasn't heart to heart that was a TV show right it was the heart brothers the heart
It was Brett the Anvil night heart and fucking
Great. No, no, let's see
Hit man heart and read that and uh, what the fuck was his name dude the anvil
They were the heart
They had what's his name the mouth from the South Jimmy Hart was their manager and shit
He had a white. So I just mentioned Bobby the brain he known he was a manager, right? Yeah, Bobby the brain he knew the weasel
Fucking a the British chic the iron chic. Yeah. Yeah the camel clutch on a motherfucker. Yeah
He climb up behind you and stick his dick in your neck and grab me super fly
Super he jump up the top rope and kick in the neck. So like contrast his like athletic ability to
One dudes doing like quadruple flips off the top rope and like
And the other dude shaking his leg like a dog in the middle
It looks like he's gonna either peer shit
Or he's angry that his wig fell off one of the two. It's like what's going on?
Hulk Hogan, I don't know
the day is
The glitch is back
Yeah, this is a what you gonna do brother yeah ratty ratty
What's gonna do
Yeah, fucking motto man, he's got fucking Oakley's on with more fucking stripes on them than the road and shit
He was like cracked out
He was on so many steroids
He could not see his fucking veins in his eyes was about to pop the fucking retinas right out of his eyes
He he needed some CBG cuz I should have fucking calm down glaucoma shit
If he'd had some CBG he'd went from macho man to fucking I'm chilling out right now, man
He'd be Tommy Chong
He took the tight pants off and got some glasses he could see out of
That's what I attribute most of the deaths of
Wrestlers of our heyday to was those fucking the way to tight pants, man
You gotta take them pants off do some shit that fits
Telling you
When the blood starts pumping and shit and you cut it off with the waist like that you it's it's the years you're cutting off
your life
Years, not just fat
Man the rough the rough game to play
The tighter the spandex and the more body parts it covered the earlier the wrestler died
That's why Hulk Hogan still alive because he only had a pair of fucking tidy
Why is that he dipped in fucking Ronald McDonald red and most of his body was bold as fuck
So he he's living off the heydays, but someone like fucking
Let's see. Mr. Perfect or some shit like that. He got that shit all over his body
He's wearing a fucking three-piece and two sets of that shit. He died early
Rarely or dusty roads he was wearing shit all over his body. He died early
I'm telling you
Andre the giant he were a big and that shit was so big
Like that shit was massive. He did early
Had
It had to be the leotards that were to type man
Yeah, the correlation with the tight leotards
early death
You gotta be like 85%
All the wrestlers of our lifetime passed away from fucking wearing one size too small leotards and shit
So they could show off their tight ass muscles to eight-year-old boys and shit
Tight ass muscles to eight-year-old boys and shit. It's fucked up way to die
There's a better way than that shit
Like little Timmy check me out Timmy and fuck now you did at 53 and shit
Timmy don't even remember your real name and shit. You like you remember Scarface killer that wasn't in his name, Timmy
Yeah
Scarface kill I remember him dude
If Timmy don't even get that shit right and now you're dead because you've been fucking wearing too tight of clothes for way too long
And shit lifting weights. That was way too heavy. So you could fucking show off the eight-year-old boys
When as I think about it like in the in the 80s where like those guys would pack, you know
the Providence Civic Center and the Boston Garden and it's like
I'm in a weenie bikini in front of like
30,000
Eight-year-old boys to like 40 year old screaming men
They're selling them fucking ice cream that has a picture of them in their underwear on it
They're eating a picture of Hulk Hogan and fucking under bruising shit while while he's wrestling him with a finger of him on his hand
Man you guys got it calm the fuck down. This is going too far
They took it way too far
I
Wouldn't bet money that that shit would have kept on going like when they started having the cartoon and ice cream and like once
Hulk Hogan hit a hundred and eight back in 83 you figured they'd like retired his ass, but he's still fucking wrestling
like same thing with
And
Still screaming whoo out in the middle of a fucking ring wrestling dudes that are 27 and kids are still believing it is winning shit
It's like what?
This is insane doing a three count
It's crazy. They're still selling. I had a buddy in high school that used to have fucking nwo parties
He was fucking 17 until he was like 23 every weekend
He would invite as many of his friends over that would dress up like they were in nwo
They were either one of the foreheads for horsemen or fucking they were Hulk Hogan or one of the dudes of Eric Nash and shit
They're gonna be one of them and they dress up like it every weekend and they come over the first it was playing video games
They dress up and play
WWE on the fucking PlayStation and shit
And then as they got older they would have fucking keggers dressed up as these dudes
And I one day I show up over there cuz he just said they were having a party and when I get there
There's a dude that's dressed up looking like he thinks he's Hulk Hogan another guy. I think she's fucking macho man
I'm like, what the fuck you motherfuckers is like 24, dude
You guys are dressing up like this shit like this is crazy. You guys are taking it way too far, man
Like none you got kids and none you got girlfriends and like only two you got cable. So how are you watching this shit?
Here you guys are having parties to watch other dudes dress up like other dudes
It's you guys got to go outside and do some shit
These motherfuckers were taking it way too far
And then they end up having kids and now the kids walking around wearing fucking whatever the new wrestler shit is
They're like, oh fuck. This is how it keeps going dude. I think it's a f2 generation of these motherfuckers
F2 f2 fucking Dax our Jim Duggan is gonna be fucked up dude
He gonna have no teeth
His 2x4 is gonna be bamboo or some shit
Fucked up dude all fucked up. Don't have to Hulk Hogan cuz you don't know what the fuck kind of mustards coming out of that shit
Dijon great coupon with all kind of seating hairline
That's the only trait that's homogenous is the receding hairline
For real dude
Every time you cross the f2 fucking Hulk Hogan male than anything else
You just get a plant that just starts fucking fading at the top. It looks like it
Look it's got some kind of byroids and shit. What the fuck's going on here?
It started shaking at the end of flower
Falls over on its side tells you it's done
Just got you walk in the room like whoo. It's the WWE cut right there
Fucking found it in Cleveland
That's how it's got its name right there man
We the top got bleached out because it was underneath the center of the fucking grill. That's so
Tall bleached out the plant fell over and shit
shaking on the ground
That's the Hulk Hogan cut right there
Instead of calling it bleach and we got to call it the fucking the Terry effect
That's what happens to shit. You have to put I like
I like totally low budget
He's wearing that leotard before he's got the two by four and that's what took his life right there
Maybe should have fucking released some of the pressure and just carry the two by four and he'd have been good to go
Well that extra nylon and leotard look King Kong Bundy same shit
You know, it's been since then since I really looked at this, you know
Do you understand how many?
ounces of
Testosterone and steroids you're looking at just in those pictures right there
So like look at the bottom right look at the bottom right ain't nobody ever seen that many abs in one picture in their life
With the fucking ultimate warrior and fucking mr. Perfect down there or what is that fucking?
