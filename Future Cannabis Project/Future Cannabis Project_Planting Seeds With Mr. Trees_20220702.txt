[00:00.120 --> 00:06.420]  we're live anyway hi everybody I don't know if we can do that joke anymore it
[00:06.420 --> 00:12.240]  might be it might be past some hashtag movement anyways how is everybody do
[00:12.240 --> 00:16.400]  today we are here with planting seeds with mr. trees it should be an exciting
[00:16.400 --> 00:21.680]  I got some plants to train Nick's got some stuff in flower mr. trees got a
[00:21.680 --> 00:27.720]  cowboy hat on and Cory is is smashing some nugs so we're all having a good
[00:27.720 --> 00:34.040]  fucking time already I'm gonna take I'm gonna smoke some some rosin and I got
[00:34.040 --> 00:37.800]  some plants here these are all your kinder heart reds bro and I have I might
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.840]  be able to dick some out of the the tent at some point I have some at week two
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.960]  and some at week no week three in flower that have been Schwartz and week two in
[00:48.960 --> 00:55.160]  flower that are doing well I got three out of five ladies and there's some like
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.920]  it's it's very different like NBC here mr. trees we have a lot of gear that's
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.600]  very sativa dominant very you know based out of a couple couple main things is
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.760]  like BC blueberry was like DJ Schwartz blueberry kind of did it did a lot of
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.400]  work with some of the BC stuff like crosses of our lemon cello and a lot of
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.120]  sativa oriented plants and it's just like these are very different from a lot
[01:22.120 --> 01:25.520]  of things that I've worked or had up here because they're just these they've
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.680]  got these beautiful fat short little leaves and they've also have such a
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.080]  different profile to them and their shape is just like the stems on I'll
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.320]  bring a couple of these out or like like two three thumbs I don't have three
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.160]  thumbs but if I had three thumbs if I could pull a toe out it would be like
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.400]  that thick of a stem and just go straight up into a top and I've trained
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.640]  those plants up really nights it's they're doing really really well and like
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.240]  not only that but they're strong so get this these mediums that are in front of
[01:53.240 --> 01:58.880]  me are no till three gallon pots that you know you put hay and cover crop and
[01:58.880 --> 02:02.720]  I didn't even turn them they don't come out of the pot so the last round I
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.640]  literally cut the stem and cut the stem and they went so you can actually see
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.440]  the stem of the dead flowered plant right here and then you have I just cut
[02:13.440 --> 02:17.560]  cut a hole in it cut it pushed it aside and planted yours in and they're just
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.320]  looking just absolutely gorgeous and happy and just killing it and and I yeah
[02:22.320 --> 02:28.520]  so I'm I'm pumped how are you doing mr. trees how are you doing Cory and Nick
[02:30.520 --> 02:37.040]  I'm doing good I'll take a I'll take a walk out there in a few minutes and I'll
[02:37.040 --> 02:44.040]  show you guys an SFP panda heart that I got out there in the ground so you kind
[02:44.040 --> 02:47.440]  of see that it's looking really friggin awesome and strong and stout and happy
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.400]  and you know ready to rock and roll so I've been working my butt off shucking
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.880]  seeds and doing last-minute planting and you know all kinds of stuff I'm getting
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.720]  ready to change over to the gardens and yeah man it's been really busy and
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.640]  really busy it's been really nice weather's been hot we've been in like
[03:07.640 --> 03:19.040]  you know you know damn near close to 100 degrees so it's been warm same yeah
[03:19.040 --> 03:27.800]  it's been a hot 100 here yeah man I got some taco in on some leaves I've been
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.760]  trying to help that taco and come back down and you know I do the boogie brew
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.000]  thing it's easy I think it's one of the best teas on the market you know I don't
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.080]  have a vermiculite compost set up or anything yeah I mean I'm working on it
[03:44.080 --> 03:51.800]  like I said I started some bucket some shit under trees but I mean yeah just
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.040]  the boogie brews uh it's a good bang for the buck you know it's great as a foliar
[03:56.040 --> 04:02.280]  you can add that fish protein in there and veg you know and it really brings
[04:02.280 --> 04:06.960]  out that micro life it's it's a nice little tea 24 hours to brew it or
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.720]  whatever though but I'm promoting anybody but I like to use that I've used
[04:11.720 --> 04:18.440]  the extreme gardening and a few other teas you know like the biodynamic by the
[04:18.440 --> 04:25.080]  blues and I I just I like the boogie brew it's nice it's a soft you know all
[04:25.080 --> 04:30.960]  organic which is veganic actually which is I guess it's that further or whatever
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.760]  but it's nice it's been helping with the taco in a little bit it's too hot to
[04:36.760 --> 04:41.040]  spray neem or anything now if you ought to spray sulfur you know unless you
[04:41.040 --> 04:47.240]  catch it in the evening and yes rough time of the year
[04:47.240 --> 05:05.320]  mr. tree you got a sombrero I got a big one like a couple of those sombrero
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.520]  things I got those hats that like with the drapes like the curtains on them the
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.720]  whole deal you know what I mean I definitely gear gear the hell up when
[05:13.720 --> 05:18.720]  I'm outside no matter what you know it's nighttime it's daytime I put on
[05:18.720 --> 05:40.510]  the gear we just finally started getting some idea the past couple of days it's
[05:40.510 --> 05:46.830]  been you know we've had a few nice days and then lots of rain cold and now it's
[05:46.830 --> 05:50.270]  starting to get warm again done actually the same thing last year we
[05:50.270 --> 05:56.210]  didn't have a summer till 4th of July
[06:16.800 --> 06:20.480]  so how about yourself Corey while everybody's doing other stuff but what
[06:20.480 --> 06:25.120]  are you up to what how's your garden growing like what's going on with your
[06:25.120 --> 06:45.410]  brother you got it right here flip you around so I ended up with that's
[06:45.410 --> 06:54.370]  beautiful a thank you I ended up with four out of the six female oh where'd he
[06:54.370 --> 07:00.090]  go lost him would you lose me no no no we got you we got you you're great you
[07:00.090 --> 07:03.530]  this is wonderful and your lights actually like not to yeah yeah no I
[07:03.530 --> 07:07.770]  flipped everything backwards so that we could I got nighttime light so that we
[07:07.770 --> 07:10.850]  could do this and it's plus it's warm in the summer so I figured it better have
[07:10.850 --> 07:16.410]  it lit up at night so yeah I've got like I say I've got four out of the six I got
[07:16.410 --> 07:26.330]  two tall girls and two shorties and I ended up with I ended up with I cracked
[07:26.330 --> 07:32.810]  three seeds of the broil by Kenda higher and I got zero on those but no
[07:32.810 --> 07:39.610]  I'm happy as heck with these they're really really nice plants rugged we are
[07:39.610 --> 07:51.970]  I guess almost into week two so what gallon pots here with what's going on in
[07:51.970 --> 07:57.130]  these three gallon pots okay so a beautiful beautiful healthy plants I'm
[07:57.130 --> 08:08.130]  running 20 gallons on these and yeah I mean you know they're kind of kind of a
[08:08.130 --> 08:14.570]  mix of a bunch of old soils a lot of it was coast to Maine I like the coast to
[08:14.570 --> 08:22.490]  soil some of it was you know peat moss and stuff that I kind of mixed myself
[08:22.490 --> 08:33.730]  with worm castings and been running coast to Maine amendments I did a I did
[08:33.730 --> 08:49.090]  a tea last week with some kelp okay so I did help a little bit of mean some
[08:49.090 --> 08:59.290]  barley I used some of Brandon rusts micro plus give that a try and prior to
[08:59.290 --> 09:05.930]  that I would been just using some FPJ that I had made really nothing in worm
[09:05.930 --> 09:12.490]  castings I make tea with my worm castings always and yeah that's about it
[09:12.490 --> 09:17.210]  but now these plants I'm so happy because I get it looks to me like two of
[09:17.210 --> 09:22.170]  each variation or hopefully that you know with the two short the two tall but
[09:22.170 --> 09:28.850]  yeah no I'm super happy with them and just as a bonus over here I've got that
[09:29.850 --> 09:47.330]  this is the cool range that's mr. trees also and that's a beautiful plant really
[09:47.330 --> 09:51.810]  really happy with this one you can get mr. trees gears at Daggadoc garden you
[09:51.810 --> 09:55.290]  can find the link in the description for all of this amazing all of it's here
[09:55.790 --> 10:01.310]  plug plug plug plug yeah no it's it's yeah no it's self-explanatory stuff's
[10:01.310 --> 10:05.470]  by
[10:05.470 --> 10:24.030]  got he's out there what do we got here mr. trees right there hey hey mr. trees so
[10:24.030 --> 10:29.710]  So I think you're kind of in a zone where you're both either internet or cell phone.
[10:29.710 --> 10:44.060]  And I think because of that you're skipping in between.
[10:44.060 --> 10:50.060]  Try turning off your Wi-Fi or turning off your cell phone so it stays on one specific
[10:50.060 --> 10:53.460]  audio.
[10:53.460 --> 10:54.460]  One specific format.
[10:54.460 --> 10:58.980]  And it should help with the whole glitching in and out presentation thing that's going
[10:58.980 --> 11:01.980]  on right now.
[11:01.980 --> 11:12.670]  That's the theorem anyways.
[11:12.670 --> 11:13.670]  Go for it, Nick.
[11:13.670 --> 11:18.310]  I was just going to ask Corey, how big is your tent?
[11:18.310 --> 11:19.310]  8x12?
[11:19.310 --> 11:22.090]  Those are 8x8.
[11:22.090 --> 11:30.590]  So I've got two 4x4 beds and then I have two free quadrants for free pots and demo implants
[11:30.590 --> 11:31.870]  and stuff like that.
[11:31.870 --> 11:39.470]  And unfortunately I have to stuff a DU in there right now, which works well in the winter
[11:39.470 --> 11:42.470]  as a heat source.
[11:42.470 --> 11:47.590]  But yeah, so two 4x4 beds and two spare quadrants.
[11:47.590 --> 11:51.230]  Do you dump your humidity towards the end?
[11:51.230 --> 11:56.030]  Like for me, I've noticed a lot.
[11:56.030 --> 12:00.230]  I always start out about 60 and then work my way up to 55.
[12:00.230 --> 12:03.550]  I only stay 60 when I'm vegging.
[12:03.550 --> 12:05.590]  And then they go into flowering at 55.
[12:05.590 --> 12:07.990]  And then every other week they're coming down.
[12:07.990 --> 12:11.030]  And then the last three or four weeks they're at 40.
[12:11.030 --> 12:13.590]  I mean they're just drawing the moisture off of it.
[12:13.590 --> 12:19.230]  And I really seem to get bigger, better, healthier buds, tighter.
[12:19.230 --> 12:20.710]  You really get that tightness.
[12:20.710 --> 12:25.230]  And they really crystal up because that's its bio layer protectant.
[12:25.230 --> 12:29.590]  Agreed, 100%.
[12:29.590 --> 12:33.950]  If I could have full control and get whatever I want, yes, I want to do exactly what you
[12:33.950 --> 12:34.950]  said.
[12:34.950 --> 12:36.230]  And I try to achieve that.
[12:36.230 --> 12:42.870]  But I really, I've got a couple of the quests.
[12:42.870 --> 12:43.870]  I missed you.
[12:43.870 --> 12:49.910]  I was just going to say right there at the end, I shut the lights off.
[12:50.110 --> 12:56.430]  If I shut them off for like a day, the THC seems to be a little higher.
[12:56.430 --> 13:01.230]  If I shut them off for like two days, the terps are a little higher.
[13:01.230 --> 13:07.310]  I've even had them off because we just didn't get to it for like three, three and a half
[13:07.310 --> 13:08.310]  days.
[13:08.310 --> 13:11.430]  And I mean at that point I was kind of like, dude, if we don't get these out of here, they
[13:11.430 --> 13:12.430]  might harm.
[13:12.430 --> 13:17.110]  But like, I mean everything, the Marix were great.
[13:17.110 --> 13:21.990]  But that's just kind of, I've been playing around with the humidity and the lights.
[13:21.990 --> 13:26.590]  Just seeing how you do it.
[13:26.590 --> 13:29.710]  Yeah, I pretty much trying exactly what you've got going on.
[13:29.710 --> 13:34.550]  And like I say, I've got a new quest, the humidifier, I got to get hook up.
[13:34.550 --> 13:40.470]  And I think if I can be in full control, that's what I want to achieve is down to about 35
[13:40.470 --> 13:42.150]  at the end.
[13:43.150 --> 13:50.430]  I think ultimately that helps clean them out or finish them or however you want to say
[13:50.430 --> 13:52.110]  it.
[13:52.110 --> 14:01.200]  Make them color up or I don't know, they just finish, it seems like.
[14:01.200 --> 14:04.720]  Right, instead of like foxtail.
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.920]  Sometimes you don't get enough light or too much humidity to it.
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.640]  They want to foxtail right there at the end or try to re-veg.
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.000]  They don't ever really finish properly.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.840]  That last push just doesn't turn out 100%.
[14:20.840 --> 14:24.000]  You know, like sometimes they get all stressy and shitty.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.320]  But I hear that.
[14:27.320 --> 14:32.800]  I got, because I've always got tent plants from week one all the way through nine in
[14:32.800 --> 14:33.800]  the same tent.
[14:33.800 --> 14:39.360]  It's always running at the same level all the time, max.
[14:39.560 --> 14:44.280]  Whatever my best VPD that I can average out both the time, but it depends on which end
[14:44.280 --> 14:45.880]  of the tent that it goes to.
[14:45.880 --> 14:54.760]  But it's, I can't really do any of those end of flower drops or turn them off for a couple
[14:54.760 --> 14:59.120]  days or anything like that in my space at this point in time.
[14:59.120 --> 15:05.160]  I was thinking about plugging a whole bunch of extra in and letting them finish off outside
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.960]  and letting the nature do its thing once the timescale gets there and then just emptying
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.960]  out and filling it right back up again so that it's as full as possible.
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.480]  You know, like second it hits like 13 hours of daylight, just put everything outside and
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.560]  then fill it right back up again so that you have a round of stuff that's fresh into flower.
[15:25.560 --> 15:26.560]  You know what I mean?
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.560]  Try and double up.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.560]  Yeah.
[15:29.560 --> 15:30.560]  Yeah.
[15:30.560 --> 15:35.960]  Your plants look beautiful, London.
[15:35.960 --> 15:36.960]  They're pretty.
[15:36.960 --> 15:39.240]  Did you get, is that the ice cream?
[15:39.240 --> 15:41.960]  Did you get the ice cream or Corey, did you get that?
[15:41.960 --> 15:43.680]  You got the SFV, right?
[15:43.680 --> 15:44.680]  SFV, yep.
[15:44.680 --> 15:45.680]  Okay.
[15:45.680 --> 15:54.200]  Yeah, I got the Pam Cross and it's really got this, there's a few funky ones, man.
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.800]  It's kind of like a burnt cinnamon or orangey flavor.
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.160]  And then there's a trash can smelling one too, like straight, straight out the funk,
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.160]  man.
[16:04.160 --> 16:06.280]  Like it's, it's pretty nice.
[16:06.280 --> 16:08.520]  And some of them are really starting to spark up.
[16:08.520 --> 16:12.400]  Like how long did you say they run for Mr. Trees?
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.000]  It's like 11 weeks, right?
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  12.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.040]  Wait, what was that?
[16:18.040 --> 16:19.040]  You cut out right there.
[16:19.040 --> 16:20.240]  What was your question?
[16:20.240 --> 16:24.080]  How long did they, how long is the flowering time for the Pam?
[16:24.960 --> 16:26.960]  I ran some of mine about 10 weeks.
[16:26.960 --> 16:28.400]  10 weeks, okay.
[16:28.400 --> 16:30.240]  You could probably pull it down earlier.
[16:30.240 --> 16:31.240]  You know what I mean?
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.280]  I just, sometimes I get stuff out there and it sits there for a while and I just don't
[16:35.280 --> 16:36.280]  get to it.
[16:36.280 --> 16:40.720]  And then, you know, and sometimes, sometimes I, you know, sometimes I got a clock on it.
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.360]  Sometimes I don't have a clock, but it was a little bit longer when I actually pulled
[16:44.360 --> 16:50.320]  those ones down, probably closer to 10 weeks, nine and a half, 10 weeks.
[16:50.320 --> 16:56.560]  But they're so like, I like, I like seeing, I like seeing things start to cannibalize
[16:56.560 --> 16:57.680]  pretty good, you know?
[16:57.680 --> 17:03.840]  So I want it to, I want it to eat itself up, you know, and flower a little bit in inside.
[17:03.840 --> 17:08.800]  Outside, you know, I, they don't, they don't eat themselves up the way they should, but
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.520]  inside in like the pots and stuff, I want to, I want to see them eat themselves up a
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.120]  little bit before I start cutting them, cutting them down.
[17:15.120 --> 17:16.280]  You know what I mean?
[17:16.280 --> 17:24.320]  So the SFVs, the ice cream cakes all went about 10, nine and a half, 10 weeks.
[17:24.320 --> 17:30.000]  And then the PAM 15 and the PAM 1, I didn't grow those.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.500]  Everybody else has been growing those ones.
[17:31.500 --> 17:33.040]  So I haven't popped any of those yet.
[17:33.040 --> 17:41.080]  So I haven't ran those exact ones, but most of them, PAMs, PAM in general is about a 10,
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.080]  11 weeker when you take it, right?
[17:44.080 --> 17:47.840]  And most of her crosses or any of those, any of those side things are always right
[17:47.840 --> 17:51.320]  or right in that realm, you know, about nine and a half weeks, something like that.
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.000]  So we got, we got Nick's, Nick's photos up.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.960]  This is photo number one, and we'll go through and order there.
[17:56.960 --> 18:00.320]  Nick, do you want to talk a little bit and tell me what this is, what stage it's at and
[18:00.320 --> 18:02.120]  what she's smelling like?
[18:02.120 --> 18:03.120]  Yeah.
[18:03.120 --> 18:08.800]  So, you know, I only had eight seeds popped.
[18:08.800 --> 18:12.640]  Two were males and six were females.
[18:12.640 --> 18:16.640]  One of them just kind of did this weird thing.
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.200]  It was really sativa-leaning, got ate up with mites when I put it through the mite factor
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.200]  test.
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.480]  You know, I always put everything through, I mean, I have a dog, so I mean, it's hard
[18:27.480 --> 18:28.920]  to just keep mites away.
[18:28.920 --> 18:36.000]  But you know, when I spray things with neem and I do my ritual, it's like three sprays
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  in one week.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.720]  And normally you eradicate pretty much everything with neem and conja or sulfur, you know.
[18:42.720 --> 18:47.040]  And so I gifted these to my partner and this is in his tent.
[18:47.040 --> 18:48.780]  That's number two.
[18:48.780 --> 18:53.200]  So number two is, it's really sparkly, really greasy.
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.200]  Okay.
[18:54.200 --> 18:57.280]  So you want me to switch to number two now?
[18:57.280 --> 19:03.740]  No, that's no, that's, I have that one labeled as number two, but that's the first picture.
[19:03.740 --> 19:06.280]  And so, cause number one, I threw away.
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.040]  So number two was that one.
[19:10.040 --> 19:11.040]  This one is, okay.
[19:11.040 --> 19:12.040]  Yeah.
[19:12.040 --> 19:13.040]  That's number, yeah.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.040]  And now we're at number two.
[19:14.040 --> 19:15.040]  No, no, no, no.
[19:15.040 --> 19:16.040]  The first picture.
[19:16.040 --> 19:17.040]  Yeah.
[19:17.040 --> 19:18.040]  You had it right.
[19:18.040 --> 19:19.040]  Yeah.
[19:19.040 --> 19:20.040]  That one.
[19:20.040 --> 19:26.240]  So that's number two in my tent and it's, it's really greasy, oily.
[19:26.240 --> 19:33.360]  I feel like, it doesn't have a really big nose on it yet.
[19:33.440 --> 19:40.760]  And it's kind of the most pointy, you know, I wouldn't say that's a, it's a little foxtail-y,
[19:40.760 --> 19:42.160]  but it's cool in that tent.
[19:42.160 --> 19:51.640]  I'm running like a 73 in there right now with the lights on at a like 40% humidity.
[19:51.640 --> 19:55.480]  Cause I'm down that I'm going into week nine tomorrow.
[19:55.480 --> 19:58.520]  So today's day 62.
[19:58.520 --> 20:04.520]  That's a today's picture that I took right before we got online.
[20:04.520 --> 20:07.840]  It doesn't really have a nose, but it's really greasy looking.
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.880]  You can see the leaves are just oily.
[20:09.880 --> 20:10.880]  All right.
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.120]  Next up, what do we got here?
[20:14.120 --> 20:16.000]  That's number three.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.880]  It's a chunky monkey, man.
[20:17.880 --> 20:24.520]  It's really, it's got that, it's got that nose and it's, it's honestly like, dude, I
[20:24.520 --> 20:30.960]  have so much bamboo to this plant because all the limbs just want to break over.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.800]  It's just so heavy.
[20:32.800 --> 20:33.800]  It's tight.
[20:33.800 --> 20:35.320]  It's, it's dense, dude.
[20:35.320 --> 20:39.680]  That's a solid nug, like straight up solid.
[20:39.680 --> 20:47.040]  And it's got this, it's the one that's got that little burnt orange taste smell, like
[20:47.040 --> 20:49.520]  with the cinnamon.
[20:49.520 --> 20:52.800]  It's like a little cinnamon note in the background, maybe nutmeg.
[20:52.800 --> 20:53.800]  I don't know.
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.840]  It's kind of a sweet orange, but it's burnt and it's, it's a nice one.
[20:58.840 --> 20:59.840]  I really like that plant.
[20:59.840 --> 21:06.120]  What's the San Vernelli, I'm stumbling over my word.
[21:06.120 --> 21:08.520]  What's the background on that side of the plant genetics?
[21:08.520 --> 21:13.320]  What, where does that come from?
[21:13.320 --> 21:19.920]  He's got the, which one, the SFV or the, the SFV, the SFV side.
[21:19.920 --> 21:22.080]  The SFV is a pure OG.
[21:22.080 --> 21:25.800]  It's the old, old school OG that changed the game.
[21:25.800 --> 21:26.800]  You know what I mean?
[21:26.800 --> 21:34.360]  It's, it's that, that one from LA that, you know, you know, that like put the stamp and
[21:34.360 --> 21:35.800]  put all the OGs out there.
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.640]  Like the, you know, everything came after that, you know, everything started being renamed
[21:39.640 --> 21:45.440]  OG and all the OG stuff started being born when the OG craze started.
[21:45.440 --> 21:51.040]  That San Fernando Valley, that's the one that Mando brought, brought back from LA up to
[21:51.040 --> 21:53.280]  humble brought OG into humble.
[21:53.280 --> 21:57.160]  So that's the OG that made it into humble from Mandelbrot.
[21:57.160 --> 21:59.240]  That's that same plant.
[21:59.240 --> 22:01.880]  The Pam, I think that's what those are.
[22:01.880 --> 22:10.400]  That's you know, that's more of your sativa, more land racy type, type, you know, plants
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.240]  depending on the 15 or the one you got, you got a lot of different characteristics there.
[22:15.240 --> 22:20.560]  He's got, I think that looks like the Pam one more, more than the, than the Pam 15 Kandahar.
[22:21.080 --> 22:24.080]  But I would imagine it's the one.
[22:24.080 --> 22:25.080]  Yeah.
[22:25.080 --> 22:26.080]  It's the one.
[22:26.080 --> 22:27.080]  Yeah.
[22:27.080 --> 22:28.080]  Pam one.
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.280]  So you're going to have more of those dense, dense buds, like modern bud structure type
[22:32.280 --> 22:33.280]  stuff.
[22:33.280 --> 22:37.920]  You know, with the one she has really, really dense pine cone type nugs that stack up onto
[22:37.920 --> 22:40.400]  the stack up to the branches.
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.920]  You get some Tootsie Roll, you get some great, you know, you know, bubble gums, you get weird
[22:46.920 --> 22:52.520]  skunky, you know, funky, you know, body odor, you know, turps out of there.
[22:52.520 --> 22:56.320]  That number one, that really pointy one that really, you know, kind of that Fox Hilly pointy
[22:56.320 --> 22:57.320]  one.
[22:57.320 --> 22:58.320]  That one's a strange one.
[22:58.320 --> 22:59.320]  That's that's that's uncharacteristic.
[22:59.320 --> 23:00.320]  You know what I mean?
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.320]  Yeah.
[23:01.320 --> 23:02.320]  It's kind of different.
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.600]  The vigor on it's fine.
[23:05.600 --> 23:10.240]  But I but I see the, you know, I see that bud structure on that on that second picture
[23:10.240 --> 23:15.760]  and that's that's Pam one type bud structure on there, you know, right there.
[23:15.760 --> 23:21.360]  But that SFV, that's like I said, that is the real the real deal that that particular
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.360]  plant.
[23:22.360 --> 23:27.120]  I think, you know, what would Kevin say that took like 13th or 11th or, you know, out of
[23:27.120 --> 23:31.800]  like 1200 interviews at one of the first ammo cups, you know what I mean?
[23:31.800 --> 23:36.320]  So when the ammo cup was cool and really, you know, on point, you know what I mean?
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.600]  Back in the day when it was all started.
[23:40.600 --> 23:44.880]  That's where, you know, that's that that plant shined, you know, among all.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.920]  It was the highest testing pure OG ever.
[23:49.920 --> 23:51.240]  It's one of my favorite plants there is.
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.800]  I mean, there's not a lot of smoke that I prefer or I reach for.
[23:54.800 --> 23:57.160]  It comes from the pre 98, right?
[23:57.160 --> 23:59.440]  Like that's part of one of the nine.
[23:59.440 --> 24:01.440]  No, no, no, not that.
[24:01.440 --> 24:02.440]  Not that SFV.
[24:02.440 --> 24:03.440]  Yeah, not that.
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.440]  Not that one.
[24:04.440 --> 24:05.760]  That one is that one.
[24:05.760 --> 24:06.760]  I don't know.
[24:06.760 --> 24:08.400]  I don't know that.
[24:08.400 --> 24:09.400]  I don't know.
[24:09.400 --> 24:11.720]  I don't think anybody really knows where that is.
[24:11.720 --> 24:15.600]  But you got like, you know, the Josh D stuff.
[24:15.600 --> 24:17.720]  That's the same plants that he's playing with.
[24:17.720 --> 24:19.520]  Those OG that the real OG.
[24:19.520 --> 24:20.520]  Right.
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.520]  The real ocean ground.
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.520]  Mike, the what was that?
[24:23.520 --> 24:24.520]  Big Sur.
[24:24.520 --> 24:26.480]  He's got, you know, stuff like that.
[24:26.480 --> 24:30.320]  That's the that's you can see it in all of their plants when they go.
[24:30.320 --> 24:31.720]  Yeah, that's that's the plant.
[24:31.720 --> 24:33.960]  You know, and then everything else.
[24:33.960 --> 24:39.840]  There's weird stories and handshakes that are made and things that are changed or whatnot.
[24:40.320 --> 24:43.320]  That particular plan is that one came directly from Mandelbrot.
[24:43.320 --> 24:45.320]  And that's when he brought up from LA.
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.080]  You know, that's that's the one that changed the game for us down here.
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.000]  I've been sifting through some of Mandel's stuff.
[24:52.000 --> 25:00.280]  You know, I got some of Russ Brandon's lime, Marilla and some GG4 with the lime that Jackson
[25:00.280 --> 25:01.960]  gave him.
[25:01.960 --> 25:08.600]  And I've been taking some of Mandel's lime and and just seeing the variations of lime.
[25:08.600 --> 25:15.240]  I had a buddy cross that to the TKTKLB.
[25:15.240 --> 25:16.240]  And it was cool.
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.520]  There's a lot of triangle cush, you know, on Hayes cross.
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.560]  It was, I don't know, just kind of I kind of want to bring it up.
[25:24.560 --> 25:27.740]  Like so how far you got to go back to get potency?
[25:27.740 --> 25:31.020]  You know, like I don't give a fuck about bag of pill.
[25:31.020 --> 25:36.040]  You know, I'm saying like, I really hope that these are just that knock your socks off.
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.360]  weed, man, because like it's been a really long time since I had weed that just like
[25:40.360 --> 25:42.900]  resined up at it.
[25:42.900 --> 25:46.760]  And it was like you couldn't even finish the joint because the joint so resined up.
[25:46.760 --> 25:48.560]  It's all running all over your lips.
[25:48.560 --> 25:53.400]  It's that sticky, sticky shit like that's just packed full of resin.
[25:53.400 --> 25:55.240]  It's just like solid resin balls.
[25:55.240 --> 26:00.160]  When you break it up, you can't cut it all the way up because, you know, it's not soft
[26:00.160 --> 26:01.160]  when you roll it.
[26:01.160 --> 26:03.160]  It's a nice wet feeling.
[26:03.280 --> 26:07.240]  Yeah, I had some Martin Mean Green, you know, that was like that.
[26:07.240 --> 26:09.320]  And I think that's what it was.
[26:09.320 --> 26:16.680]  But anyway, it's been a long time since I've had some like this killer fucking weed, man.
[26:16.680 --> 26:18.040]  Like it's all good.
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.040]  Don't get me wrong.
[26:19.040 --> 26:21.160]  But like, you know what I'm saying?
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.280]  Like, I don't know.
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.500]  Anyway, so the last one you showed London was number five.
[26:28.500 --> 26:31.240]  It was my prettiest plant.
[26:31.240 --> 26:32.240]  The third picture.
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.240]  Yeah, it was the prettiest one at the start.
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.160]  It's not anymore.
[26:40.160 --> 26:43.160]  That plant got ugly, motherfucker.
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.840]  Yeah, but you know, that's that's number five.
[26:47.840 --> 26:55.680]  Yeah, it's but it's got a it's got that garbage can turps like that straight out of the garbage.
[26:55.680 --> 26:56.680]  That's kind of funky.
[26:56.680 --> 26:57.680]  That's interesting.
[26:57.680 --> 27:03.200]  Like, are you talking like wet garbage or like garbage?
[27:03.200 --> 27:05.080]  There's like regions of garbage.
[27:05.080 --> 27:10.360]  There's like garbage that's out front of a sushi place on a hot, sunny day.
[27:10.360 --> 27:15.240]  There's like, there's like, hey, that lady has too many cats garbage.
[27:15.240 --> 27:18.760]  And then there's like, hey, hey, there's wet garbage.
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.480]  And then there's Hey, that's like not proper compost garbage.
[27:22.480 --> 27:24.880]  Like what kind of garbage are we talking about?
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.680]  Like the kind you leave in the back of your truck for a week, and it's someone else's
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.560]  trash and you just promised them that you would like dump it and you left it in the
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.840]  back of your truck for like a week on like a hundred degree week kind of trash.
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.560]  And then like, you're gonna dump it and you're like, I better put some gloves on.
[27:45.560 --> 27:48.600]  Like the kind that still got a cheeseburger in there for McDonald's.
[27:48.600 --> 27:49.600]  It's still totally.
[27:49.600 --> 27:58.560]  Or like a cantaloupe that's like half decaying and you're like, what is that?
[27:58.560 --> 28:00.200]  Yeah, that kind of garbage.
[28:00.200 --> 28:01.720]  We're really selling it.
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.160]  We're really selling this.
[28:04.160 --> 28:05.160]  They're really gross.
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.200]  And really, really selling this right now.
[28:08.200 --> 28:09.440]  Okay, next one.
[28:09.440 --> 28:10.440]  Next slide.
[28:10.440 --> 28:11.440]  Next slide, brother.
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.000]  We were on this one next.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  So it's number seven.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.480]  It's funky shapes, man.
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.920]  I'm running it under a single ended HPS.
[28:23.920 --> 28:24.920]  Okay.
[28:24.920 --> 28:25.920]  Okay.
[28:25.920 --> 28:28.760]  But that's, that's number seven.
[28:28.760 --> 28:30.880]  It's the sparkliest one.
[28:30.880 --> 28:34.520]  And it's got a really like citrusy smell.
[28:34.520 --> 28:41.480]  It's it's, um, it's got some funk, some gas behind it, like, kind of like some fuel notes
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.760]  with that citrus.
[28:42.760 --> 28:45.400]  It's it's a nice one.
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.800]  It is.
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.040]  It doesn't chunk on chunk like the third one, though.
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.280]  And then that's number eight.
[28:53.280 --> 28:55.720]  And that one's just straight fuel.
[28:55.720 --> 28:58.720]  Like that's, it's like a fuel smell.
[28:58.720 --> 29:04.580]  Those are raw, man.
[29:04.580 --> 29:05.580]  It's like that.
[29:05.580 --> 29:11.900]  A lot of the the pure candahar stuff that I was looking at, like their flowers, they
[29:11.900 --> 29:17.980]  get really, really strange looking really, you know, really kind of horrible, raw, like,
[29:17.980 --> 29:20.060]  tough looking, you know what I mean?
[29:20.060 --> 29:25.020]  With these weird, you know, I'm excited to see them outside, you know, and see what the
[29:25.020 --> 29:29.260]  see what the pure stock looks like outside, you know, under a full full sun.
[29:29.260 --> 29:30.740]  I was trying to get it up there.
[29:30.740 --> 29:34.180]  But the Wi Fi got me in freeze mode, dude, caught me in a loop.
[29:34.180 --> 29:35.180]  So I can't.
[29:36.180 --> 29:42.020]  I'm going to put out some small ones outside and and rerun them outside and see if they
[29:42.020 --> 29:47.220]  throw different variations, you know, because I feel like sometimes like and it really depends
[29:47.220 --> 29:51.900]  on how it's bred, you know, like it was bred under LEDs or in salts or whatever, how it
[29:51.900 --> 29:52.900]  was bred.
[29:52.900 --> 29:59.300]  And then the next person that picks it up, I feel like limited to until it maybe adapts
[29:59.460 --> 30:05.580]  or, you know, like it starts to variate from what it originally was.
[30:05.580 --> 30:06.580]  It doesn't matter.
[30:06.580 --> 30:12.740]  Yeah, no matter what it is, it's the environment's gonna gonna tweak it, you know what I mean?
[30:12.740 --> 30:15.380]  So they'll be completely different outside than they are inside.
[30:15.380 --> 30:19.620]  That's what I'm noticing, too, with that one that I was up there showing this one SFE
[30:19.620 --> 30:25.060]  Candahar, like inside its leaf shape was completely, completely different.
[30:25.060 --> 30:32.340]  It's, you know, it's it's like overall, like scent profile that's on it right now is like
[30:32.340 --> 30:34.900]  way more powerful, way different, you know what I mean?
[30:34.900 --> 30:40.820]  As it is outside, you know, so it was like it's a night and day difference on on what
[30:40.820 --> 30:42.220]  they're like inside and outside.
[30:42.220 --> 30:46.860]  And it was just completely different, you know, so I'm excited to see them outside.
[30:46.860 --> 30:51.580]  Really, really see what what they're doing, you know, look at that.
[30:52.540 --> 30:56.900]  So I do have a little bit of a limit in time, but these are at like just under week, just
[30:56.900 --> 31:02.810]  about week three here.
[31:02.810 --> 31:07.210]  And I've taken and given them a really like I took them and gave them a hard clean at
[31:07.210 --> 31:08.890]  the start and pretty much clean them to here.
[31:08.890 --> 31:14.010]  I actually cleaned them to here at the start and left it to here and then kind of cleaned
[31:14.010 --> 31:17.770]  it up to there when it came down to it.
[31:17.770 --> 31:24.430]  And then we'll keep them pretty flat.
[31:24.430 --> 31:26.910]  And these will fill fill up pretty hard.
[31:27.110 --> 31:32.230]  And they'll be packed in with 12 others in a two by four per square foot.
[31:32.230 --> 31:36.990]  There's one at least one point two five to one point five plants, depending on how many
[31:36.990 --> 31:38.070]  gallon pots I have them in.
[31:38.070 --> 31:45.590]  These are in two gallons, so it'd be like one point five gallons, man.
[31:45.590 --> 31:49.710]  And you see how they have how they've got the round, all those are rounded, rounded
[31:49.710 --> 31:56.430]  type, but, you know, but tops compared to the to the other sharp ones, you know.
[31:56.430 --> 31:57.430]  So that's interesting, too.
[31:57.430 --> 31:58.430]  It's cool.
[31:58.430 --> 32:02.070]  Is that more like the ice cream, you think?
[32:02.070 --> 32:03.070]  That round?
[32:03.070 --> 32:04.070]  Very round.
[32:04.070 --> 32:05.070]  Yeah, it's more round.
[32:05.070 --> 32:06.470]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[32:06.470 --> 32:09.110]  Like I don't have a shape that's close to those other ones.
[32:09.110 --> 32:12.310]  I mean, if you look at these and then so this is number nine.
[32:12.310 --> 32:16.070]  Like, let me see right here.
[32:16.070 --> 32:24.180]  That those are number nines and that that's number nine in veg.
[32:24.180 --> 32:25.180]  That's my favorite.
[32:25.180 --> 32:26.180]  I like the leaves.
[32:26.820 --> 32:27.820]  Nice.
[32:27.820 --> 32:33.020]  Yeah, they got a really kind of banging thick shape.
[32:33.020 --> 32:36.620]  I thin them pretty hard because they pack so much into one little tiny space.
[32:36.620 --> 32:43.620]  What are those smelling like, you say?
[32:43.620 --> 32:46.540]  Funk, man, like like a little bit.
[32:46.540 --> 32:49.020]  Give me a second.
[32:49.020 --> 32:50.220]  And let me let me load them in.
[32:50.220 --> 32:52.580]  OK, I got I got one more one more glory shot.
[32:52.580 --> 32:53.580]  I'm going to have a whiff.
[32:53.580 --> 33:03.910]  I'm going to load them in and we'll go through that.
[33:03.910 --> 33:11.580]  So for scent wise, I don't know, number nine isn't kicking as hard.
[33:11.580 --> 33:12.580]  Hmm.
[33:12.580 --> 33:19.260]  I don't want to be too rough with them because they're just a little bit.
[33:19.260 --> 33:28.340]  They have like a deep kind of incenti like wood.
[33:28.340 --> 33:29.340]  Hmm.
[33:29.340 --> 33:43.180]  Not like terpenelein, but like skunky and funky, deep, woody, kind of like a.
[33:43.180 --> 33:49.180]  I want to say almost like a pencil, which is kind of fun, like like like like an old
[33:49.180 --> 33:52.500]  school HP pen pencil.
[33:52.500 --> 33:56.260]  Like when you're when you when you you remember when you're going up to the like the one that
[33:56.260 --> 34:02.260]  was like next to the door at the school classroom, you like giving it a little like.
[34:02.260 --> 34:03.660]  That looks so terrible.
[34:03.660 --> 34:06.700]  Just my hand popping out of nowhere going like this is just terrible screenshot.
[34:06.700 --> 34:09.000]  But yeah, you know what I'm talking about, right?
[34:09.000 --> 34:16.380]  So yeah, that that that kind of that kind of odor and the other ones.
[34:16.380 --> 34:20.100]  Pretty relative, a little bit more fresh.
[34:20.100 --> 34:26.500]  I get oh, I get more like citrusy notes like definitely.
[34:26.500 --> 34:30.140]  A little bit more terpenelein.
[34:30.140 --> 34:32.620]  Like skunky and deeper.
[34:32.620 --> 34:36.580]  The bud sizes are a little bit smaller on the five than the nine.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.580]  The nine is jacking a little bit heavier.
[34:38.580 --> 34:54.350]  That's for sure.
[34:54.350 --> 34:58.990]  They're pretty plants for two gallons like dang, dude.
[34:58.990 --> 34:59.990]  That's nice.
[34:59.990 --> 35:00.990]  Good job.
[35:00.990 --> 35:03.990]  How's the worm thing going for you?
[35:03.990 --> 35:07.990]  Is that that working out?
[35:07.990 --> 35:08.990]  No, no.
[35:08.990 --> 35:10.990]  No, it is not.
[35:10.990 --> 35:16.270]  OK, so in the two guys like it's so here's the challenge, right?
[35:16.270 --> 35:19.670]  Like you need to have layered biological life.
[35:19.670 --> 35:26.510]  And when you every time you mix the pot and you stir it, you you fucking destroy the ecosystem
[35:26.510 --> 35:28.750]  or anything left going on there.
[35:28.750 --> 35:29.750]  Right.
[35:29.750 --> 35:32.830]  And you don't like there are still rodents around.
[35:32.830 --> 35:40.550]  There are still like larger pests and and and, you know, bears and things like that.
[35:40.550 --> 35:44.990]  So I can't be putting out like banana peels and a bunch of rotten things and stuff like
[35:44.990 --> 35:45.990]  that.
[35:45.990 --> 35:51.150]  Like I got to be a little bit like green matter is what I can put around and and some and
[35:51.150 --> 35:52.150]  some basics.
[35:52.150 --> 35:53.150]  Right.
[35:53.150 --> 35:56.110]  Like I can get away with a few things here and there, but I have to be very light with
[35:56.110 --> 35:57.110]  it.
[35:57.110 --> 36:00.870]  So that's why I'm trying to push to this new method where it's like I don't even churn it.
[36:00.910 --> 36:06.710]  I just layer on and kill the crop, cover crop and put it put it fresh down and just cut
[36:06.710 --> 36:11.230]  and cut and put a fresh one in and just kind of do it offset in the pot and let the old
[36:11.230 --> 36:15.510]  one just die away and let the bacteria and everything kill it.
[36:15.510 --> 36:20.870]  And I'm finding that this in a three gallon I'm seeing I'm seeing something I'm seeing
[36:20.870 --> 36:26.030]  a little bit more, you know, like little tiny ones at the very end, like like a little bit
[36:26.030 --> 36:29.990]  more poop showing up about three quarters of the way through flower.
[36:30.110 --> 36:34.350]  But they don't get quite to the end because I find if I get them too big and they dry
[36:34.350 --> 36:40.830]  completely like they won't get fucked, but they will fucking kill that.
[36:40.830 --> 36:43.470]  A lot of the bacterial life will dwindle off.
[36:43.470 --> 36:48.870]  So you're you'll have an imbalance and you'll get like a big flush out of like something
[36:48.870 --> 36:49.870]  else.
[36:49.870 --> 36:52.790]  I haven't like put another bug down in a while.
[36:52.790 --> 36:54.350]  I've seen aphids in there.
[36:54.350 --> 36:56.670]  I've seen lacewings by the dozens.
[36:56.670 --> 36:58.590]  I've seen predatory mites.
[36:58.590 --> 37:00.630]  I've seen regular mites.
[37:00.630 --> 37:02.550]  I've seen a lot of fucking weird stuff.
[37:02.550 --> 37:05.750]  Here, I'll show you guys to see if I could actually get in the tent right now.
[37:05.750 --> 37:19.830]  Just I got to be quick because I'm like fucking around with the lighting system at this point
[37:19.830 --> 37:20.830]  in time.
[37:20.830 --> 37:22.830]  But it's there's a lot of light.
[37:22.830 --> 37:23.830]  Don't fuck with the lights.
[37:23.830 --> 37:24.830]  Yeah, I know.
[37:24.830 --> 37:26.790]  But it just went off.
[37:26.790 --> 37:28.230]  They just went off.
[37:28.230 --> 37:30.870]  And so I'm not overly concerned about it.
[37:30.870 --> 37:35.710]  So you can see like, there's a there's a lot going on with my oh wait, I gotta fucking
[37:35.710 --> 37:38.110]  turn that on, don't I?
[37:38.110 --> 37:40.430]  That would probably fucking help there.
[37:40.430 --> 37:49.760]  Yeah, rule number one, week three, don't have to put the lights too much.
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.920]  So you can see that they're layered all the way to the back.
[37:52.920 --> 37:54.920]  And then you have the larger flower one.
[37:54.920 --> 37:58.520]  But look at the cover crop.
[37:58.520 --> 37:59.520]  Boom.
[37:59.520 --> 38:12.250]  Like there's so much so much life in there.
[38:12.250 --> 38:13.250]  That's pretty killer.
[38:13.250 --> 38:16.050]  Actually, you know, impressive.
[38:16.050 --> 38:22.050]  I like to do a lot of my Fino runs and two gallon pots and just stress them out, you
[38:22.050 --> 38:30.530]  know, like, just get them rebound and like one or two gallon pots and you know, always
[38:30.530 --> 38:42.200]  the light leak and you know, a few other things.
[38:42.200 --> 38:46.240]  I've been finding like if you can manage the takeover at the right time and it's the point
[38:46.240 --> 38:52.520]  in which like you get that dry back that the plant is completely in control of like the
[38:52.520 --> 38:54.240]  second you get to there.
[38:54.240 --> 39:01.060]  I've been trying to debate on whether or not it's like better to hit way more regularly.
[39:01.060 --> 39:02.060]  You know what I mean?
[39:02.060 --> 39:06.140]  Is God enough stand like the plants are never like dwindling with water.
[39:06.140 --> 39:07.860]  They're never stiff or anything like that.
[39:07.860 --> 39:08.860]  We're just debate.
[39:08.860 --> 39:11.860]  Do I like hit them more regularly?
[39:11.860 --> 39:14.220]  Yeah, I try and do patterns.
[39:14.220 --> 39:17.460]  But do I do every day and do a little bit less?
[39:17.460 --> 39:18.780]  You know what I mean?
[39:18.780 --> 39:24.540]  And that way I have a more even moisture profile for the plants all the way through because
[39:24.540 --> 39:30.240]  I find if I if I go every other day watering, which is totally fine, or even every three
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.760]  day watering the cover crop will die off because the plant will take over the medium
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.520]  because it's always always just that much more established than everything else.
[39:39.520 --> 39:44.280]  So if there's if there's a point where there's a battle or a struggle for something, the
[39:44.280 --> 39:45.940]  cannabis always wins.
[39:45.940 --> 39:48.920]  So it's like you'll get a hard die pack and things go a little bit shitty.
[39:48.920 --> 39:53.280]  So I'm trying to debate on like, of course, the best way is to keep the life as much as
[39:53.280 --> 39:54.280]  possible.
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.680]  But when you get back when you get to that end point, is it kind of a funner thing to
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.440]  let that dry back and die off happen and let all these kind of weird funky things happen?
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.040]  Or do I want to keep the moisture content there and just cut chop go into another round
[40:10.040 --> 40:12.100]  right away?
[40:12.100 --> 40:16.480]  And it's like what what's going to result in the best product and what's what's what's
[40:16.480 --> 40:17.560]  going to end up with that.
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.560]  So I mean, like, fun.
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  I'm baked.
[40:19.560 --> 40:21.560]  I'd like to talk about I'm gonna have another day.
[40:21.560 --> 40:25.920]  I almost feel like there's going to be different diversity if you let if you let it dry a little
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  bit, you might get something to happen that doesn't normally thrive.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  I don't mean dry, dry, but a little dry.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.280]  And then, you know, and I don't know.
[40:35.280 --> 40:36.280]  It's fun to play with.
[40:36.280 --> 40:38.400]  I do it every so often myself.
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.000]  And I don't know, I haven't found anything that works any better than others.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.480]  But it's fun.
[40:48.480 --> 40:58.120]  You know, like the main thing for mulch is like just to keep the moisture in and the
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.440]  ground temperature cool.
[41:01.440 --> 41:07.360]  And this year, I don't know, I just had some watermelons pop up in my where I was planting
[41:07.360 --> 41:08.360]  my pot.
[41:08.360 --> 41:16.440]  So I'm I'm seeing how that works, just as like keeping the moisture in and like covering
[41:16.440 --> 41:21.200]  the soil because I mean, I got to kind of pick them off my my plant because you know,
[41:21.200 --> 41:24.480]  they're buying and they like the tendrils like to grow up things.
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.800]  But I mean, so so far so well, it's working pretty good.
[41:28.800 --> 41:32.560]  I mean, I just it randomly happened.
[41:32.560 --> 41:35.840]  And I was like, well, I kind of want these watermelons.
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.280]  These were kind of like some really good ones that came out of the garden and I'm not digging
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.280]  them up.
[41:41.280 --> 41:43.000]  They're just too pretty to dig up at this point.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.080]  So we're trying that out.
[41:45.080 --> 41:46.080]  I don't know.
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.520]  The little the little things, it's the little thing.
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.360]  Yeah, I've done that with watermelons and cantaloupe and pumpkins and all kinds of funny
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.680]  stuff and they just end up crawling into the into the ganja area.
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.680]  You know what I mean?
[42:00.680 --> 42:02.400]  And it you know, it is what it is.
[42:02.400 --> 42:03.400]  You know, it's pretty cool.
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.960]  You can shade the ground a little bit and get an extra crop down low and you can plant
[42:08.960 --> 42:11.440]  potatoes and carrots.
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.480]  I do lots of carrots in my beds.
[42:13.640 --> 42:18.280]  My ganja carrots, I do lots of I mean, they're just easy because they fill in the gaps of
[42:18.280 --> 42:19.280]  all kinds of stuff.
[42:19.280 --> 42:22.440]  So you can just do carrots and different stuff and they'll hang out in there.
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.520]  It gets so on the next episode, I'm going to harvest a carrot out of one of these pots
[42:28.520 --> 42:29.520]  and eat it.
[42:29.520 --> 42:30.520]  Nice.
[42:30.520 --> 42:31.520]  Nice.
[42:31.520 --> 42:32.520]  I'll go out and harvest the carrot too.
[42:32.520 --> 42:33.520]  I'll do it too.
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.400]  Like I got one right here in the Kandahar Reds.
[42:35.400 --> 42:41.480]  It's like it's probably it's this thing is this finger thick and it when it's this
[42:41.480 --> 42:44.040]  finger thick, we'll pull it out and eat it.
[42:44.040 --> 42:45.040]  Nice.
[42:45.040 --> 42:46.040]  I love that.
[42:46.040 --> 42:47.880]  I've grown some black ones, man.
[42:47.880 --> 42:48.880]  That's pretty cool.
[42:48.880 --> 42:51.320]  Some really black, like a black juicing carrot.
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.320]  So I'm excited.
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.320]  Really?
[42:53.320 --> 42:54.320]  Really?
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.840]  Are they like almost do they change in flavor at all or are they like they like good?
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.840]  So this is my first year growing them.
[43:00.840 --> 43:01.840]  Yeah.
[43:01.840 --> 43:07.400]  This is an heirloom black juicing carrot and it's like so black that it stains your teeth
[43:07.400 --> 43:09.240]  and your clothes and stuff like that.
[43:09.240 --> 43:11.480]  And it's really, really got a lot of liquid to it.
[43:11.480 --> 43:13.920]  Kind of like it's got more liquid than usual.
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.440]  So it's like, I don't know where I'm in for it.
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.240]  You know, we're going to I'm going to I'm growing other carrots to, you know, like the
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.880]  rainbow colors and the fingerlings and the bombs and all kinds of other carrots I always
[43:24.880 --> 43:25.880]  grow.
[43:25.880 --> 43:29.680]  But those are the ones I'm like kind of like, yeah, those are going to be kind of interesting,
[43:29.680 --> 43:30.680]  you know.
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.720]  So a juicing carrot, black tooth, you know, be pretty cool.
[43:34.720 --> 43:35.720]  That's funky.
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.800]  I've done like all sorts of different type of purple and there's like some good purple
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.240]  and there's like three main varieties of purple carrots that I've found that are like purchasable
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.600]  on the on the food market anyways as a chef.
[43:47.600 --> 43:52.800]  And there's like two that suck, one that tastes terrible and is kind of purple, one that's
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.920]  purple, tastes delicious, but loses its purple right away and goes orange or this weird chocolatey
[43:57.920 --> 43:58.920]  color.
[43:58.920 --> 44:02.080]  And there's one that's like purple all the way through and it's like nice and deep color.
[44:02.080 --> 44:05.880]  So I found those and that's what I put in my mix mix round.
[44:05.960 --> 44:11.920]  I find like they're really good to like break up the soil and throwing them down and radishes
[44:11.920 --> 44:18.800]  with a nice hard tape root like and you have some compaction can really like make life
[44:18.800 --> 44:20.440]  a little bit easy for you.
[44:20.440 --> 44:25.840]  Yeah, I just had to cut down all my radishes because they were getting too tall and throwing
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.400]  flowers and getting all over the place.
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.760]  My radical radishes are like this wild group of things that some will be long, tapered
[44:34.760 --> 44:40.040]  bouches and beat the shit out of the ground and some will be some will be more like small
[44:40.040 --> 44:44.320]  rounded torpedo shape that really got a lot of good aroma and are better for eating and
[44:44.320 --> 44:49.040]  like there's like a there's a plethora of like different kind of throws that come out
[44:49.040 --> 44:52.120]  of out of those those seeds, but I planted a whole bunch of them.
[44:52.120 --> 44:53.120]  And then they just boom.
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.600]  And I was like, man, I was taking a pic to some of those pulling these these monsters
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.720]  out man there's some pretty bitchin fuckin things that were coming out of there.
[45:01.720 --> 45:04.040]  Yeah, radishes are great for breaking that stuff up.
[45:04.040 --> 45:06.600]  You know, that's a no grow with cannabis pretty good.
[45:06.600 --> 45:09.440]  You know, that's a good call on those.
[45:15.970 --> 45:17.450]  So what are you smoking on, Corey?
[45:18.850 --> 45:21.250]  Corey's doing dabs, so he's all quiet now.
[45:21.250 --> 45:21.850]  You got to fucking.
[45:21.850 --> 45:25.330]  I like to get a gold now.
[45:25.330 --> 45:29.650]  I haven't I got to figure out how to function under the influence of cannabis again.
[45:29.650 --> 45:32.570]  Fuck. We were just talking about that till early.
[45:33.050 --> 45:36.450]  Yeah, I I I've been there.
[45:36.450 --> 45:43.810]  I've been there. I smooshed some Bickett OG and I yeah, that
[45:45.250 --> 45:48.970]  nice. Nice.
[45:51.170 --> 45:53.050]  So you have smoking Pam one today.
[45:54.410 --> 45:58.970]  Boring old fun old school Pam one, you know, so.
[45:59.010 --> 46:00.490]  Yeah. Yeah. OK.
[46:00.730 --> 46:02.450]  Sure. Sure. Like Mr.
[46:02.450 --> 46:03.170]  Tree. Oh yeah.
[46:03.170 --> 46:06.730]  My needs boring because she's like she's been around.
[46:06.730 --> 46:07.970]  She's like my oldest plant.
[46:07.970 --> 46:08.690]  You know what I mean?
[46:08.690 --> 46:12.290]  Like I've been smoking this this weed for a long fucking time.
[46:12.290 --> 46:14.090]  You know, a lot of years, you know.
[46:14.090 --> 46:16.090]  So it's yeah.
[46:16.090 --> 46:20.370]  Right now, this this month has been Pam one month, you know.
[46:20.410 --> 46:25.450]  So you know how many people in the world would love to like just just like have a nugget
[46:25.450 --> 46:29.650]  that like I would I would just love to have a nugget that just throw.
[46:29.810 --> 46:31.330]  Can you throw it over here?
[46:31.330 --> 46:33.730]  Is there a way to skip the screen somehow?
[46:34.250 --> 46:38.490]  If you like throw it really hard at your computer, like pop out the other end.
[46:38.810 --> 46:40.650]  They got to get there.
[46:42.330 --> 46:44.730]  They can do it, but it loses its turf profile.
[46:44.770 --> 46:45.690]  Oh, what do we got here?
[46:45.690 --> 46:47.650]  You got to make it.
[46:52.570 --> 46:54.330]  What is it, Nick? You're on mute.
[46:56.290 --> 46:58.770]  And it's not running out of weed.
[46:58.810 --> 47:01.090]  I can smell that from here, though.
[47:01.090 --> 47:07.010]  So this is a there's a guy named the Nature Farm Genetic.
[47:08.610 --> 47:12.210]  This was his skunk 18 cross with you.
[47:14.490 --> 47:17.610]  And we ran this outdoor.
[47:17.610 --> 47:21.530]  It's actually it's it had a little double branching issue.
[47:21.730 --> 47:23.770]  You guys ever seen double branching?
[47:23.770 --> 47:25.250]  It's a bitch.
[47:25.250 --> 47:27.730]  But it's it's pretty decent.
[47:27.770 --> 47:28.890]  It's untrimmed.
[47:28.890 --> 47:30.650]  You know, just about that mean twice.
[47:32.090 --> 47:32.850]  Oh, yeah.
[47:32.850 --> 47:35.370]  They came out of each node, like each way.
[47:35.570 --> 47:39.330]  Like instead of just one new node
[47:39.570 --> 47:44.810]  or off every node, like a stem growing, there was one going each way.
[47:46.410 --> 47:50.010]  So there was like two going out of every node.
[47:51.250 --> 47:55.490]  And I had a weird variation with a banana cross that he had.
[47:55.970 --> 48:02.730]  And it was it had a it had a stem growing off a leaf on one of them.
[48:03.090 --> 48:04.930]  It's the craziest thing I ever saw.
[48:04.930 --> 48:07.570]  But that's what we're smoking on right now.
[48:07.570 --> 48:11.570]  Untrimmed, you know, it's it's pretty decent.
[48:15.690 --> 48:17.890]  I feel I feel like we need to.
[48:17.890 --> 48:21.450]  Somebody needs to send you guys some lighting for your house.
[48:23.610 --> 48:26.450]  I guess I love and appreciate you a great deal.
[48:26.490 --> 48:28.490]  Nick was like, turn on the lights in your house.
[48:28.890 --> 48:31.050]  There you go. We can see you now.
[48:31.050 --> 48:32.810]  I know it's hard to look at people.
[48:32.810 --> 48:33.530]  I know it's hard.
[48:33.530 --> 48:35.530]  You got to have the ugly lights off all day long.
[48:35.930 --> 48:38.450]  That's what I tell my wife is what I why I keep everything dim
[48:38.450 --> 48:40.930]  just because I'm ugly and then otherwise you'll see my face.
[48:43.130 --> 48:45.450]  Those are those are pretty beautiful.
[48:45.450 --> 48:48.980]  It's really nice.
[48:49.700 --> 48:51.900]  But yeah, I had some double branching.
[48:54.540 --> 48:57.300]  I don't know if you've ever seen it.
[48:57.380 --> 49:01.260]  It's actually I guess it came with his male skunk 18 cross.
[49:01.260 --> 49:04.180]  It was a 1964 skunk.
[49:04.420 --> 49:08.260]  We were trying to go back and I felt like we kind of went too far back.
[49:09.220 --> 49:11.540]  It was like a 70s kind of weed,
[49:12.140 --> 49:16.060]  which isn't really like a commercial thing, you know, but it's a
[49:16.060 --> 49:18.020]  it's pretty stony weed, man.
[49:18.660 --> 49:20.940]  I'm dense, like.
[49:20.940 --> 49:23.220]  Dance, you know.
[49:24.580 --> 49:26.700]  But yeah, we're looking for strength, you know.
[49:26.700 --> 49:29.460]  I was asking that question earlier, like how far are you guys?
[49:29.580 --> 49:31.100]  How far are you going to go back?
[49:31.100 --> 49:34.420]  Like I know like the SFV is a good one.
[49:35.020 --> 49:38.580]  The you know, the sour D, the Kim,
[49:38.660 --> 49:40.900]  if you like to deal with the harm thing.
[49:43.620 --> 49:44.500]  But yeah.
[49:46.380 --> 49:50.580]  Now, when we were kids, we had this stuff that my buddy used to snatch
[49:50.580 --> 49:55.940]  from his dad and his dad was an old an old school head man, like like real,
[49:56.060 --> 50:00.500]  you know, like in the game old school head and all the all the hookups,
[50:00.500 --> 50:01.540]  you know what I mean?
[50:01.540 --> 50:03.260]  And he's just not just one stuff.
[50:03.260 --> 50:05.460]  You'd always ask him, like, wait, when you get the hippie,
[50:05.460 --> 50:07.900]  but because we call it the hippie, but or whatever.
[50:08.100 --> 50:13.020]  When we were little kids, we're like, I don't know, like 14, 15, 16,
[50:13.020 --> 50:14.020]  something like that.
[50:14.020 --> 50:16.300]  We probably like, yeah, probably more like 15, you know.
[50:16.780 --> 50:21.100]  And we're always man was that hippie, but and he'd sometimes you'd have some other.
[50:21.180 --> 50:22.460]  It was it was always good.
[50:22.460 --> 50:23.980]  And he kept it in his freezer.
[50:23.980 --> 50:27.740]  And that's where I, you know, when I learned you can keep leading the freezer,
[50:28.060 --> 50:30.140]  which is weird, but you can do it.
[50:31.540 --> 50:33.220]  But he kept this shit in his freezer.
[50:33.220 --> 50:35.020]  It was the ugliest weed you've ever seen in your life.
[50:35.420 --> 50:36.260]  Like it was ugly.
[50:36.260 --> 50:41.420]  Like we used to get like the really pretty and we used to call green bud or gal,
[50:41.420 --> 50:43.580]  or, you know, drow or whatever.
[50:43.580 --> 50:46.020]  Back in the day, none of them really had too many names.
[50:46.300 --> 50:48.460]  And we used to name them ourselves, you know, when we'd see them,
[50:48.460 --> 50:49.940]  you know, whatever it smelled like kind of.
[50:50.180 --> 50:53.540]  And we call this one the hippie bud, because, man, it just it just knocked it
[50:53.540 --> 50:57.340]  back. The old man, but the hippie bud used to call it the old man, but the hippie bud.
[50:57.540 --> 51:01.340]  And it was some of the ugliest fucking weed you've ever seen in your life.
[51:01.340 --> 51:04.980]  And it was like stringy and just like it just wasn't good.
[51:05.020 --> 51:08.820]  It was it was it would never make it today on any aspect.
[51:08.820 --> 51:13.380]  But I mean, years, years later, asked him about that.
[51:13.740 --> 51:18.500]  And he he said it was some it was a it was a it was a crazy
[51:19.100 --> 51:22.500]  something haze that that his buddy used to grow.
[51:22.500 --> 51:26.100]  And I forget what it was, but it was like it was awesome stuff.
[51:26.220 --> 51:29.380]  But some of that some of the ugly my point is some of the ugliest weed
[51:29.820 --> 51:32.300]  has some of the most power like you'll ever find.
[51:32.300 --> 51:35.260]  You know what I mean? And in the world, it's and it's strange that,
[51:36.460 --> 51:39.540]  you know, sometimes that's how it works out.
[51:39.580 --> 51:40.260]  You know what I mean?
[51:40.260 --> 51:44.300]  And you breathe the prettiness and other things and you get taste and flavors
[51:44.300 --> 51:48.980]  that are cool, but sometimes power comes, you know, looking a little differently.
[51:48.980 --> 51:51.300]  You know what I mean? So it's cool.
[51:51.380 --> 51:53.140]  Sometimes it comes looking good, too.
[51:53.140 --> 51:55.140]  But that's why I remember that.
[51:55.140 --> 51:56.660]  You don't forget that stuff, man.
[51:56.660 --> 51:58.620]  It always stood out every single time we got.
[51:58.620 --> 51:59.820]  We were always blown away.
[51:59.820 --> 52:01.180]  You know, it was it was crazy.
[52:01.180 --> 52:05.180]  You know, we were we were youngsters, but we could we knew the difference,
[52:05.180 --> 52:08.540]  you know, because we you know, we had we had old schoolers that had
[52:09.140 --> 52:12.180]  had fucking good bud when there wasn't real good, but when everybody else
[52:12.180 --> 52:15.380]  was smoking, you know, brick, we and other stuff, you know, so it was cool.
[52:16.060 --> 52:16.820]  It was cool stuff.
[52:17.580 --> 52:22.980]  Ah, sorry, big gap, big gap.
[52:25.420 --> 52:26.980]  Nothing wrong with some brick weed, though.
[52:26.980 --> 52:30.300]  I mean, if it's good, brick weed, it doesn't matter.
[52:30.940 --> 52:31.980]  I grew up on all that.
[52:31.980 --> 52:34.020]  And, you know, I'm right next to Mexico.
[52:34.020 --> 52:36.180]  That's that was my best friend, dude.
[52:36.180 --> 52:38.700]  Brick weed when I was a kid, you know.
[52:38.700 --> 52:41.860]  Dude, I tried to get some brick weed the other day.
[52:42.260 --> 52:44.380]  I shit you not.
[52:44.380 --> 52:48.260]  And and my buddy was like, yeah, dude, I can get you some brick weed.
[52:48.580 --> 52:50.740]  I was like, how much for a pound?
[52:50.820 --> 52:52.340]  He was like 40 bucks.
[52:52.340 --> 52:56.740]  Like, you know, like, dang, man, you just.
[52:57.740 --> 53:02.740]  And it it didn't look any different than the brick weed we used to get.
[53:02.780 --> 53:03.740]  It was just crazy.
[53:03.740 --> 53:05.580]  It was like a throwback in time.
[53:05.580 --> 53:06.460]  But, you know, like
[53:08.900 --> 53:10.980]  I still couldn't believe that you could get it.
[53:11.220 --> 53:16.100]  The CD holder, the where the old VHS tape fucking, you know,
[53:16.220 --> 53:19.740]  thing we used to break shit up on on the old like blockbuster video.
[53:19.740 --> 53:22.140]  And I remember blockbuster video, videotapes.
[53:22.140 --> 53:23.460]  And shit used to do that.
[53:23.460 --> 53:28.020]  Every every generation has a tool except for the newest one.
[53:28.020 --> 53:29.460]  And I think they use iPhones.
[53:29.460 --> 53:31.180]  They're starting to use iPhones.
[53:31.180 --> 53:34.340]  And you know, because it was like because my parents were talking about,
[53:34.340 --> 53:37.660]  yeah, we used to take the bricks of weed and we used to take it.
[53:37.660 --> 53:40.420]  We bust it out and put it on on a record player.
[53:40.420 --> 53:44.260]  And then it would like all the seeds would fall out to the sides.
[53:44.700 --> 53:48.540]  You're like, oh, yeah, you put it on in a cassette on a cassette.
[53:48.540 --> 53:53.780]  And I'm just thinking like, fuck, I remember putting so much weed on top of CD cases.
[53:54.220 --> 53:58.780]  And and then I'm just being like, what the fuck do people use now?
[54:00.740 --> 54:05.020]  Yeah, they they made the MP3 player just to fuck with people who smoke weed.
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.100]  They're like, God damn it.
[54:06.100 --> 54:08.900]  You know, that's why I never caught on, you know, with CD.
[54:08.940 --> 54:12.500]  It was CD size was like the last size where you could like,
[54:12.740 --> 54:16.140]  you know, infuse the music and the rolling really easily.
[54:16.140 --> 54:18.580]  Beautifully. You know, it was really nice.
[54:18.580 --> 54:21.460]  As far as sorting seeds, they don't have to anymore.
[54:21.460 --> 54:24.140]  They just get it off of us and it's all seedless, right?
[54:26.660 --> 54:30.880]  Yeah. In theory.
[54:33.320 --> 54:38.440]  Those little seeds, man, I probably got some old Mexican seeds somewhere that that I can break out.
[54:38.440 --> 54:42.720]  I got some stuff we used to call SD Funk Skunk and it was just a Mexican brick.
[54:43.040 --> 54:49.160]  It was just some Mexican brick stuff that was just skunky and just just ugly.
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.800]  And but good that some, you know, it was it was nice when you grew it.
[54:52.800 --> 54:53.560]  You know what I mean?
[54:53.560 --> 54:58.120]  But it was it came out of some fucking gross ass stuff, you know,
[54:58.520 --> 55:00.000]  and that was an old strain when we were kids.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.520]  We used to we used to have lots of seeds that, you know, we used to plant those all the time,
[55:03.520 --> 55:05.640]  you know, called the Funk Skunk, you know.
[55:07.880 --> 55:08.800]  Stupid stuff.
[55:09.800 --> 55:23.200]  It's always interesting to be able to, like, play with those old things like but they're fucking challenging to grow.
[55:23.560 --> 55:29.480]  They're not like, hey, you know, like let's throw them in a hydro ton thing and throw some salts at it.
[55:29.480 --> 55:30.960]  And boom, there they grow.
[55:30.960 --> 55:32.200]  You know what I mean?
[55:32.200 --> 55:34.600]  Like it's it's it's not a super easy thing.
[55:35.080 --> 55:43.840]  Last night I checked on I was popping some seeds and there was one group of seeds, this fresh group of seeds that, you know, was popping.
[55:43.840 --> 55:44.880]  We're going to test some seeds.
[55:45.280 --> 55:52.680]  And so, you know, so we have pop seeds that I throw a handful of seeds in some water and I let it soak there for, you know, the night.
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.440]  And the next day I plant them.
[55:54.440 --> 55:55.160]  You know what I mean?
[55:55.160 --> 55:57.040]  I just I don't let them pop or anything.
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.440]  If they do great, whatever.
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.600]  So when I threw those ones in the in the water the next day, when I went to check on them, they were all dead.
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.360]  The next day when I went to check on them, most of those had already popped open up through a tail out.
[56:07.800 --> 56:16.760]  But I also wanted to pot up some of these old or try to germ some of these old bull rider bag seeds that I have from my youth.
[56:16.760 --> 56:18.200]  And I've had been holding on to them.
[56:18.200 --> 56:26.240]  And every couple of years I pull them out and I take a couple and I try to get them to germinate and do all that other stuff.
[56:26.240 --> 56:28.000]  So I did the same thing with those.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.320]  And I put them in next to the next to the new ones.
[56:30.560 --> 56:32.560]  The next day, the new ones were popped up.
[56:32.880 --> 56:33.600]  Bull rider.
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.840]  I was like, I peeked in there.
[56:34.840 --> 56:36.160]  I was like, ah, nothing.
[56:36.240 --> 56:36.840]  You know what I mean?
[56:36.840 --> 56:37.640]  They didn't pop out.
[56:37.640 --> 56:41.720]  So then I, you know, I went to the next process.
[56:41.720 --> 56:55.440]  So I'm hoping that I can get some of those old, old seeds there from like 2003, you know, 2006 to somewhere right now, 2003, 2006, somewhere in that realm.
[56:55.480 --> 56:56.120]  You know what I mean?
[56:56.160 --> 56:57.600]  Those those seeds somewhere in there.
[56:58.200 --> 57:05.920]  So yeah, I'm hoping that those ones, those ones will pop out and we can look at some of that old frigging fire.
[57:06.640 --> 57:07.560]  Maybe I can get some out.
[57:07.560 --> 57:08.400]  You let them go.
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.880]  Like you, how long do you leave them in there until you finally say the hell with it?
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.480]  I mean, like if they don't pop back to how long?
[57:16.840 --> 57:21.040]  Dude, I've had seeds pop up 33 days after planting them.
[57:21.640 --> 57:22.320]  Holy shit.
[57:22.320 --> 57:22.800]  Okay.
[57:23.120 --> 57:27.400]  And I had to go back and do the math and be like, fuck, that was like 33 days.
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.840]  I've had weird shit like that happen.
[57:29.840 --> 57:35.360]  Yeah, I've like planted them and they showed up like, oh, I'll throw some borage in there.
[57:35.560 --> 57:37.080]  Clearly the weed isn't going to pop.
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.800]  Just scrape the top, throw some borage.
[57:38.800 --> 57:42.280]  Like months later, I got a four inch, five inch borage plant.
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.880]  And it's like there all of a sudden is a weed plant growing.
[57:44.880 --> 57:46.000]  It's like, what the fuck?
[57:46.400 --> 57:48.000]  How does that happen?
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.080]  Is that just a random one or is that a whole batch?
[57:51.600 --> 57:58.160]  I've had certain batches that took more than 10 days, 12 days to pop to pop ground.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.240]  And it was like on average, but every single one would pop.
[58:00.240 --> 58:01.800]  But not a batch of 30?
[58:02.400 --> 58:02.920]  30 days?
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.680]  Not a batch of 30.
[58:04.680 --> 58:10.200]  But I've had more than I can count come up, come up like more than two weeks.
[58:10.320 --> 58:10.960]  You know what I mean?
[58:10.960 --> 58:12.280]  After planting, you know what I mean?
[58:12.280 --> 58:13.480]  So I leave them, man.
[58:13.480 --> 58:18.160]  I usually try to just leave them in the corner and make sure they don't go completely dry.
[58:18.160 --> 58:18.880]  You know what I mean?
[58:18.920 --> 58:23.560]  And like sometimes they pop up and it's not like they pop up and they're stunted and shitty.
[58:23.560 --> 58:24.120]  You know what I mean?
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.960]  Usually if they make it up there, you know, by then they're doing just fine, you know?
[58:29.320 --> 58:32.440]  So yeah, definitely.
[58:32.960 --> 58:35.400]  I'm waiting for a long time.
[58:35.400 --> 58:38.280]  You know, I'll give them a couple of months to sit in the corner somewhere.
[58:38.280 --> 58:40.760]  And if they don't pop up, they don't pop up.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.640]  I expect you to be up within three to five days.
[58:43.640 --> 58:45.320]  You know, that first week you should be up.
[58:45.520 --> 58:46.960]  You know, you should be up in a week.
[58:47.240 --> 58:49.520]  On average, most things should be up in a week.
[58:50.520 --> 58:51.200]  You know, that is.
[58:51.200 --> 58:53.040]  But then there are exceptions.
[58:53.040 --> 58:58.120]  There are seeds that can be made in like colder temperatures, different temperatures, different nutrient uptake environment.
[58:58.120 --> 59:01.440]  It can affect the seed coating, the shell, the density.
[59:01.440 --> 59:06.320]  There are different strains that come from different places that need more cold.
[59:06.320 --> 59:07.760]  Some are ready to go right away.
[59:07.760 --> 59:10.800]  Some, you know, some need a little bit of a rest time.
[59:10.800 --> 59:14.040]  There's a lot of those little variables that come into that seed game.
[59:14.040 --> 59:18.480]  But I want you up in like seven days, you know, initially.
[59:18.920 --> 59:22.400]  But these ones, man, I've tried a few times and I still got some more.
[59:22.680 --> 59:27.000]  And I'm going to wait for somebody with a lab or something that wants to work for me and try to crack them open.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.760]  Because I know there's life in there.
[59:28.760 --> 59:31.400]  You know, there's some good seeds still left, you know.
[59:31.960 --> 59:34.040]  But I can never get them to go.
[59:34.040 --> 59:42.920]  And I tried everything under the moon, aside from a scientist putting them in friggin, you know, in the culture and
[59:43.480 --> 59:47.200]  feeding them and making sure that they can get them, get them past that first stage.
[59:47.200 --> 59:52.920]  I've had them pop a couple pop and then peter out because I can't, you know, you can't feed them.
[59:52.920 --> 59:54.960]  They just don't have enough energy left after that.
[59:54.960 --> 59:56.840]  You know what I mean? With that little assistance, you know.
[59:56.840 --> 59:59.680]  So I hope I'm hoping that.
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.120]  So I'm putting it out there.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.640]  I hope I hope that I can get those ones to pop up.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.320]  That would be cool.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.160]  I want to try popping some of them.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.200]  How many seeds do you have?
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.640]  We can find hundreds.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.280]  We'll find somebody to pop them.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.800]  I bet you I know someone that pops them.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.640]  Maybe I could find you somebody that'd be down to do it.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.640]  Next, I could I could figure it out.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.400]  I've had a few seeds gifted to me from like the early 90s or late 90s and early 2000s, man.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.520]  And I tried my luck.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.640]  I had a few pop and, you know, peter out.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:58.440]  And then I've tried I tried every method and it just seemed that, you know, even it doesn't matter how well you clean the seed at some point, that seed just kind of doesn't it molds or rots or, you know, and it just doesn't ever pop.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:11.480]  It's it's I've tried the sandpaper, the peroxide, the URB natural, all that are natural, you know, all that.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.600]  The I just I can't I haven't been able to do it.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:21.160]  I've even tried the sparkling soda, you know, putting it in sparkling soda.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.160]  And that just I've never I haven't had any luck, man.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:34.400]  I would, yeah, like you said, take them to a lab because they obviously know a little more about it than what we do.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.400]  That have a right.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.960]  Or about like, like if you they're not stored right, like we all kept them in our drawers, right?
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.720]  We keep our seeds in our drawer or whatever, you know, and not under cold storage or it gets hot, it gets cold, whatever.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.000]  Then all of a sudden, you know, the lifespan of that seed goes because they only have so many carbohydrates.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.520]  They only have so many hormones.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.760]  They only have so many things locked up inside that seed.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.720]  And if they're kept in a in a warmer environment, it's it's consuming those things and using those things.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.880]  Those things are fading away.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.600]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.360]  Quicker than they would if they were under a cold storage.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.760]  So like that's like a 90 seed and a 2000 seed like mine and yours or whatever.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  I mean, those aren't really old.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.200]  They should they should pop, you know, realistically, you know, if they were stored correctly.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.000]  But we threw them in the drawer and we kept them that way or, you know, they weren't under cold storage.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.480]  Then our chances have dramatically dropped a lot.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.200]  And it's not it doesn't even matter.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.720]  Like I said, they can crack open.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.080]  But all the energy that they actually have left in their soul is all that that's left in it.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.480]  And they can't do anything else.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.280]  So that's why their souls are gone.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.720]  Yeah. The carbohydrates and the sugars and they need to be kind of nursed along in that fashion.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:53.520]  It's just hard to do for, you know, in the normal, normal capacity, you know, so doing enough, man, be able to get those get them rolling, you know, just
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.040]  partnership or something, you know.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.900]  On that point, I'd love to know, like, what's your what's your thought on media for planting seeds there, Mr.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:14.500]  Because I've I've like I've always been torn between two thought processes and I'm kind of at the point where I'm just like, fuck it.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.540]  I want to just put it in dirt.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.340]  I want it to be the medium that it's going to end up in.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.700]  And I want to plant the seed and I want to fucking plant to grow.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:31.580]  Right. And and and and and at this point, like if I'm going to if if a plant's not going to do that, I don't want it anyways.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.820]  You know what I mean? Because then it's just going to breed a lot of G on that's going to behave in the same way.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:47.260]  But it's like you find all this cool stuff and it's just like, well, you got to plant like 12 of them and you get like five out because it's like, well, there's bacteria and shit.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.820]  There's stuff in the soil.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.460]  They compete out.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.340]  But it's like, what's your thought on that?
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:04:01.460]  Do you think it's like, OK, well, maybe I should sacrifice that moment and put them in a really sterile medium and and start really cleanly.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.380]  And and and start there.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.220]  Or do I do that practical work?
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:20.980]  Because I mean, there's not a lot of other foods or seed product in the world that we look at that we go, hey, it's OK that we have under 98 percent germination rate just throwing it on a fucking top of soil.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.060]  Like there's not like you go by, look at all of your dirt.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.940]  And if they're not there, they're probably like some weird random thing and they give you a big warning.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.900]  And, you know, it's like stevia for some reason is a bitch.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.380]  But, you know, like it's just a few odd things like that.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.100]  So I wonder about like cannabis seeds.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.340]  Like, should we keep should we keep this delicate?
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.180]  Oh, I'm going to put them on my calendar and put them in a fucking paper towel and and do all this crap to them.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.740]  Or should we just jam them in dirt?
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.020]  And if they don't live as a community, just decide, hey, guys, let's just jam this shit in dirt.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.780]  And if it doesn't live, we don't use it.
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.620]  Right. Like what's your thoughts?
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.180]  What do you guys what do you what do you think about it, too?
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.620]  So like I put a lot of thought into this.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.700]  This is a big deal for me.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:13.700]  You know what I mean? And there is a on lots of seeds, not all seeds, but on a lot of seeds, especially the size of cannabis seeds.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:20.300]  The coating, the actual shell of the seed has a coating on it and it's got a hydrophobic coating on it already.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.020]  It's like built in safety device.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.700]  So it's like, you know, it gets squirt.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:31.100]  It knows when to grow instead of growing at the wrong time when just a tiny little bit of moisture may get on it.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.060]  Right. But it's not the right time for it to grow.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:42.700]  It needs to become more saturated to to break down that that kind of that coating that's over the shell and tell the seed it's time.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.580]  We have enough of what we need here.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.140]  The coating has been broken down.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.140]  It's time to it's time to go.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.580]  So that's the reason behind me.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:06:00.460]  Like, I don't waste my time with a paper towel or anything like that because I don't want the seed to open in the paper towel and send its little feeder fiber sensitive roots into the paper towel.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.980]  And I got to peel it off of the thing.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.140]  And it's like, you know, it hasn't oriented properly.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:06.300]  It's like, oh, I don't like that.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.580]  You know what I mean? That's not what I like.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:16.780]  But I do like soaking the seeds for 12 to 24 hours just to tell the seed it's time to go.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.060]  Instead of just sticking it in dirt, maybe it doesn't get moist enough and it takes takes too long to wear that shell off.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.900]  And then you get 50 percent come up, 50 percent don't.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:32.700]  When when I soak the seed and I make sure that they're good to go and ready to rock, they're told.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:38.580]  Then you plug them directly into soil, you know, and they, you know, in one one day, most of them don't pop in one day.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.620]  Some of them will open up.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:44.700]  But most of the time, that 12 hours or whatever, 24 hours, they just perfect for planting.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:50.940]  The coating's been eaten, time to throw them in dirt and your and your and your stats go up.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.580]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.500]  They're there. You know, things start rolling a lot better, a lot faster in my experience.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:06.620]  So things like that are really, really small seeds like carrots and poppies and, you know, dragon fruits, things that you scatter on the surface of the soil.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:10.220]  I don't bother soaking those in water or doing anything like that.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.540]  Their coating is very minimal, if any.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.460]  And if you get those wet, you can't properly scatter them and plant them properly.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.060]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.460]  And I feel they're too small to handle individually.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:28.380]  But once they reach that, like I'm handling this seed individually and the small scale, boom, I'm going to I'm going to soak those those first.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:36.500]  And then as soon as they start getting up bigger, like like avocado, you know, mango, things like that, where the seeds are really gigantic, I don't bother.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.020]  So those go directly in dirt.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.020]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:45.260]  And maybe they get washed off first and those go directly in dirt, you know, away it goes, plant the way they're supposed to and then they go.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:55.700]  But for like those little seeds that are like cannabis size, pumpkin size, you know, zucchini size, stuff like that, where you're going to handle them individually.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.220]  I think that giving them a soak for a few hours is not a bad idea.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.940]  It kind of tells them it's time to go and will improve their chances, you know.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:11.940]  But if you're doing thousands of seeds at a time, it's not practical to be soaking them and handling them in that manner.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:21.020]  You might as well just put them in the dirt and make good seeds so that they, you know, in the mass majority, make sure your soil is moist and they should come up old fashioned farmer style like you're growing corn or something.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.660]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.540]  So I see both sides to it.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:34.500]  But if I really want my seeds to do good, if I paid some good money for them or it's something that's kind of important to me in some aspect and it's on a smaller number standpoint, you know,
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.300]  I'm soaking them for a few just to tell them what's up, you know, so I hadn't opened.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:46.860]  But, you know, I'm open to information and all kinds of stuff as it goes along, but that's where I've settled over the years.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:59.220]  I went from just putting them in dirt to paper towel stuff to, you know, cleaning them and doing weird shit and all kinds of stuff, you know, soaking them in seed solutions and weird probiotic stuff and like aloe.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.300]  Fucking I don't do any of that stuff anymore.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:08.340]  They get put in clean water for 12 hours, maybe, you know, it's usually 12 because I do it at night.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.780]  You know, I'm at home night.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.780]  Kids go to sleep.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.740]  I start fiddling around with my stuff.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.340]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.380]  What I need to get done.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.300]  I'm playing with seeds.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:22.580]  And then I throw them in in little cups like that night at like 10 and then that next night, you know, like eight or nine or 10.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.260]  Sometimes I'll come back around and we'll start planting those things out.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.380]  So sometimes like 12, sometimes it's 24.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.300]  But really, that's it.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.260]  I don't want to spend any more time with them than that.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.540]  That's just, it's just a tough, but yeah.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.540]  Long explanation, but that's it.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.260]  What's up, Nick?
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.340]  Even it's simple.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.660]  It's simple.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.540]  Simplicity is bliss.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.020]  It's just a weed, you know.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.700]  People make it so complicated.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.660]  It's just a weed.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.980]  It'll grow anywhere.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.180]  Anywhere.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:13.340]  Like Alaskan Thunderfuck, that's just grown in like harvested in like 32 degrees and shit.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.060]  You know, it's so impressive.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:24.140]  It's such a diverse plant, you know, high altitude, low altitude, dry, wet, hot, cold.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:35.980]  You know, even the way the different like spectrums of light that are put off across the world, you know, different seasons.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.460]  And it's just, I don't know.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.060]  It intrigues me.
[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.870]  I find it all consuming sometimes myself.
[01:10:54.710 --> 01:11:00.110]  I have tried everything that we've just talked about.
[01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:11.870]  And then some, I feel as though these seeds are important to me and they're, it's not just the cost of them.
[01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:15.470]  They're important to me, the time, the effort, the whole everything.
[01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:20.470]  So I want them to germinate.
[01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:29.710]  I try, I probably try too much on some of it, but you know, I think the thing that I like most is I like the, I like the little plugs.
[01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:34.470]  And I like planting them in those plugs and I like seeing when the root comes out of them and then I put them right into the dirt.
[01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:39.710]  Once I see a tap root and you know, Nick, I agree with you a million percent too.
[01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:43.790]  It's like they should just be able to go throw them right in the dirt and grow.
[01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:46.110]  And you know, like Mr.
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:52.670]  Trees in London pointed out, you know, they, they should grow in dirt directly.
[01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:59.670]  And if they don't, I definitely don't want them because if I was going to breed with them and move forward, I certainly don't want something
[01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:05.590]  to be, you know, not started in the environment that it was going to continue in.
[01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:10.190]  So like, could you imagine that troubleshoot conversation like every day?
[01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:21.710]  Like, because, because like if you look at like some of these sites, like, like these, these, these, these, these corporate branded, like I got every strain in the world apparently.
[01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.430]  And you can order every strain off of me as my single brand.
[01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.670]  And I'm the best, I don't know, whatever.
[01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:28.670]  You're saying troubleshoot?
[01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:29.670]  Like, but think about that.
[01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:30.790]  You're that's your troubleshoot.
[01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:33.670]  That's every single day, every single day.
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:37.630]  You got to tell him you got to take it, hold it in a fucking paper towel and do all this shit.
[01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:47.630]  Like the amount of hours that you'll have to spend as a person, if you're going to breed seeds, fucking telling people how to put seeds to grow them.
[01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:52.230]  It's just not only that, it's like you have to tell them that for them to even be viable.
[01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:53.310]  Yeah, that would be horrible.
[01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:54.030]  And they don't care.
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.470]  I don't think they do troubleshoot it.
[01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:02.670]  I wonder, I wonder if seeds are just going to take a big dive in price in the next few years.
[01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:06.670]  I don't know.
[01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:14.670]  I just think that, you know, once you get to a big corporate level, it's, it's a lot of times people aren't concerned with anything more than money.
[01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:15.670]  I hate to say it.
[01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:17.670]  In my opinion.
[01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.670]  Well, I mean, like, okay, so Mr. Trees, here's, here's a great question for you.
[01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:35.670]  So of plants in general, like, like, because you've probably purchased, you worked at a nursery, so you probably understand what the seed market looks like as a price per unit and stuff like that and what it would be like to be like in that area.
[01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:42.670]  When you look at cannabis seeds and the yield per square foot of the amount of seed that you get per plant.
[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:51.670]  Is there another, like, what would be the average cost per seed of a plant like that in every, any other market?
[01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:52.670]  Like, is there a comparable plant?
[01:13:52.670 --> 01:14:01.670]  Like, I think I imagine like definitely not quinoa, but like something close to some of those plants might relatively close yield to it.
[01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.670]  Like, what would the cost of those seeds be?
[01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:08.670]  Probably you get a few hundred per $3.50, right?
[01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.670]  Like you get, you get a lot.
[01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.670]  You do get a lot.
[01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:19.670]  If you were like comparing like one tomato seed to one cannabis seed, you know what I mean?
[01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:20.670]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:22.670]  You get a good big plant, right?
[01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:28.670]  You know, you get, you know, if you do your job, you should get a bunch of good fruit on it, you know, and, you know.
[01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:34.670]  But man, there's no tomato in the world that makes me feel like cannabis makes me feel, you know what I mean?
[01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:37.670]  And it's not 100% the same, you know, when it comes down to like.
[01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:43.670]  I don't know if you come over for a tomato cheese salad sometime and you might think otherwise.
[01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:47.670]  I mean, a tomato or a mango, you know what I mean?
[01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:53.670]  Like the value of that to me is completely different, you know, on that, you know, and then like mango to cannabis.
[01:14:53.670 --> 01:15:02.670]  So, I honestly think that like seeds in general are too cheap when it comes to like what you can get things out of like on the commercial standpoint.
[01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:06.670]  You know, I think that they've cut everybody off at the knees and you know what I mean?
[01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:07.670]  They're just making some cool stuff.
[01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:17.670]  That's why you got to make like the coolest stuff you can and make the best types of seeds you can and try to, you know, do something a little bit different.
[01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:24.670]  But when everybody's got the same seed, everybody's got the champion tomato or everybody's got the, you know, the same seed.
[01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.670]  It's the same, you know, stuff.
[01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:30.670]  It's like you can't, you know, the value is definitely changed.
[01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:35.670]  So, cannabis has that uniqueness to where everybody can have their own seed, you know what I mean?
[01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:38.670]  And you can only get this type of stuff in the same way.
[01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:45.670]  So, I think that's kind of interesting to think about when like how much you can yield.
[01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:54.670]  But like on a tomato plant versus a cannabis plant, one seed like I can get a cannabis plant grown outside next to a tomato plant, you know, rocking and rolling.
[01:15:54.670 --> 01:16:06.670]  If I grew a cherry tomato plant, I would probably really put myself running for my money because cherries can put on a shitload of fruit for a lot of months and keep coming and keep swinging at you, you know what I mean?
[01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:19.670]  Right. And what you get a 20, like even if you get some of the really unique and expensive cultivars of tomatoes and peppers and stuff, like you're never running more than like $6 per pack of 25 seeds.
[01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:22.670]  Like never ever running that price.
[01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:34.670]  I mean, like you be hard. There's very few. There's not a lot of people on the market that are selling packs of seeds for fucking, you know, $25 or less at that volume.
[01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:42.670]  Right. Like it's an interesting thought when you look at when the market's going to go legal and things are going to go process and move forward.
[01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:51.670]  And now there's so many people doing breeding and not all of them are like you, Mr. Trees, you know, like spent their entire lives doing it.
[01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:59.670]  There's a lot of pollen chuckers out there, myself included. You know, like it's, it's, it's, there's nothing and there's nothing wrong with doing that at home.
[01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:05.670]  We're already there. Unlike, unlike the seed prices, you know what I mean? Like there's, it's, we're, we're, we're already there.
[01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:12.670]  Like that's there. You could go anywhere and get a free pack of seeds or a $5 pack of seeds or whatever. You know what I mean?
[01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:24.670]  A dozen different seed companies have a dozen different things, but it's just, that's, that's where you got to find a way in vegetables and fruits and, and different things is to find what you can kind of bring to the table.
[01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:34.670]  And, you know, if everybody can charge five bucks for it, maybe you can charge 10. But I can tell you that if I run out of ganja, I'm going to go get some ganja. You know what I mean?
[01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:41.670]  If I run out of tomatoes, I might not go to the store for a little while and get some tomatoes. You know what I mean? It's, it's totally different, you know?
[01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:54.670]  So it's like that, that ganja value is, is high. You know what I mean? When it comes to like, you know, especially if you're using it like medicinally or you need it, you know, for, you know, for whatever purposes, you know what I mean?
[01:17:54.670 --> 01:18:05.670]  But, you know, it's, it, it's a, it's an important thing to have. So there's, I put, I put lots of value on those. I put lots of value on like mangoes and mango seeds and stuff like that.
[01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:13.670]  You know, I put lots of value on things that take a long time to grow, you know, like different fruits and stuff that take a lot of effort.
[01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:27.670]  And then like to see that fruit that took like seven or 10 years to like find a cultivar that was good and taste, taste amazing and was like mind blowing. Then it like takes like a whole year to grow a crop of these things.
[01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:35.670]  And then you put them in the market and you sell them for a dollar fifty each. You know what I mean? It's like, God damn, that's just like, that's, that's crazy.
[01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:47.670]  It took so much, so many years and effort to do all this work and then the farmers always get screwed. And like, that's just the way that it is in the world. Farmers get screwed. I mean, it's like, it's like, we want it cheaper.
[01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:59.670]  You know, it's like, fuck, it is hard to farm, dude. It's hard to, it's hard to get these plants to get to the end to, to do it right. It's hard to, to battle the bugs and the issues.
[01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:11.670]  It's fucking hard to get them, you know, it's hard to farm, you know. And I don't, that's just the bummer of the farming world. You know, if you're gonna be a farmer, you're probably gonna be, you know, on the poor side, you know.
[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:21.670]  But, you know, you can, if you can set yourself apart and have something interesting and really do something that's kind of different, I think that there's always a place for that.
[01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:31.670]  And people always want to pay for that, you know, and that's, that's, that's how you stay alive, you know. And it's not like they have to pay more. It's like you, you are more in a lot of different ways, you know what I mean?
[01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:42.670]  So it's like there, there's, there's always a value for that high tier stuff that's good. It's why I go to farmers markets and pay more money for certain fruits that I can't get or I can't grow.
[01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:53.670]  Or I want to try because it's interesting and different, you know what I mean? Or something, you know, I'll drive a long ways to do weird stuff like that so that I can learn or gather some seed or whatever, you know.
[01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:57.670]  So genetics are key, man. Which is really cool.
[01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:12.670]  We got to get the masses to not be disconnected with their farmer and understand where food comes from again and not just think that it's from the grocery store and maybe they'll have a little bit more respect and it will matter more, I think.
[01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:22.670]  You know, I got a, I got a precursor to that one for you is we got to get people to cook again because people have stopped fucking cooking and teaching their children how to cook.
[01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:32.670]  They like, like we, they grew up in generations where everything came out of a fucking box or bag. Nobody knows how to make like it's total disconnect.
[01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:33.670]  Total disconnect.
[01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:39.670]  Yeah, like what they learned how to, they learned how to cut a cucumber from Kendall fucking Jenner.
[01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:40.670]  Like what the fuck?
[01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.670]  Like how do you make gravy?
[01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:46.670]  How do you make gravy?
[01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:55.670]  You know what I'm saying? Like how do you make gravy? I'll just start there. Like I've made gravy for some people and they're so mind blown. I'm like dude, it's just gravy.
[01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:57.670]  Oh shit.
[01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:07.670]  Okay, Mr. Trees, we're a plant show. We got to get back into the plant stuff. We'll have a bitch about the food system later. Well, let's continue on. What do you got there for plants, brother?
[01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:16.670]  Just check this out. Like this, this is a mango tree, right? This is a mango seed. You can still see the seed in the ground right there. You know where it came out of, right?
[01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:29.670]  This is a different type. This one, this one came from a Florida tropical one. This one is a, this one is a Mexican type mango. A little bit different than a tofu or manila. It's a different variety, but it's from Mexico.
[01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:46.670]  The seed wasn't in there, the fruit was. So like some, like I won't know for at least six years what the hell this is like. You know what I mean? There's no way to know. You know, so it's like six years from now, maybe 10. Could be 10 years.
[01:21:46.670 --> 01:22:02.670]  I bet you we can get it. I'm hoping for six, you know, I'm shooting for six, but I won't know. I've got hundreds of these things that have all different shapes, colors, and sizes. And with the trees, it's like, fuck, you plant that seed and you're like checking in for 10 years.
[01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:26.670]  You're laying roots for the rest of your life, right? You're laying roots for the rest of your fucking life because you can't go anywhere, right? Like I, I, I like started dragon fruit a year ago and it's that fucking tall. And you know, they take like seven years to grow. I'm like, fuck it. I'm moving to Italy in January. I don't need this. I'm going to carry this fucking dragon fruit plant with me to Italy. No, fuck that.
[01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:44.670]  You know, my asparagus is three years old. It's taller than I am now. And it's just like, well, fuck, that sucks. I planted wormwood. Never going to be able to get high off that. Damn it. But I mean, like, so you got to be when you start them, you got to be able to set down some roots, right?
[01:22:44.670 --> 01:23:15.030]  It takes a while. They're your babies, you know? Cool thing about mangoes is I, you know, when I, when they're small like this and they just pop out, I do a, I break their, I break one of the leaves, one of the leaves in half and I smell them, you know, and some of them, well, most of them have some sort of an aroma, but some of them have a really nice kind of interesting different aroma. And the ones that are like, oh, wow, that's really cool. Those ones get slid to the side, you know, and those ones are like, oh, that's really cool.
[01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:36.030]  Those ones get slid to the side, you know, and those ones are the ones that I'm going to, I'll plant those out one day and see what they do in the long term. And then the other ones that don't really like do anything different or special, those get slid to the other side and then those are used to be grafted onto. So I'll cut their heads off and we'll put on, you know, ice cream, mangoes or, you know, coconut cream or whatever we got, you know, that we're doing.
[01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:58.030]  But the cool thing about them is they're a lot like cannabis in the way, depending on how you grow them, where they're growing, how they're doing, you get different flavors, depending on when you, when you eat them, could be completely different from the next day, you know, whether the tree ripened or pulled off, it's like the coolest fucking thing in the world, but they take forever if you're going to do it that way, you know, so.
[01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:27.030]  So, so, hey, so, hey, I got some fun for you, Mr. Trees. And I think you'll really enjoy this because we were talking about seeds and talking about the seed market and stuff like that. I messaged a friend of mine who was speaking at the conference of throw up and his name is called Rob, sorry, Rob Harrington. And he is a tomato breeder. He's got eight registered tomato cultivars on the market, but he's been breeding cannabis up here in Canada for like 50 years.
[01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:35.030]  So I thought it'd be fun to add his perspective and he come up on stage and join us for a little bit of conversation. If you'd be interested, you down, you cool?
[01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:36.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:38.030]  Okay, cool. I'll send him the link right now.
[01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:39.030]  He's totally down.
[01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:40.030]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:41.030]  Okay, okay, okay.
[01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:45.030]  I mean, I gotta go get a damn charger.
[01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:56.030]  I'm gonna die. This is cool because I got a right now I got 23 different varieties of tomatoes out there all by Baker.
[01:24:57.030 --> 01:25:06.030]  And they're, they're really cool. All the different a lot of them are carry varieties, but 23 different varieties of tomatoes.
[01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:08.030]  That's cool.
[01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:10.030]  Heck yeah.
[01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:19.030]  Like my favorite one that I tried so far is called tropical sun sunrise. It's a little yellow one. It's really good.
[01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:29.030]  The atomic grape cherries were good, but the Rosalettos, those were really good. They're really small and Auburn.
[01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:37.030]  That's cool. Because I got a, there's a guy known as a tomato king here in Oklahoma. He's from Bixby, Oklahoma.
[01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:44.030]  He's got the record for producing the most, the most pounds per tomato plant.
[01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:52.030]  Like, and he uses a variety called the Rio Grande. And it's the Arkansas traveler.
[01:25:53.030 --> 01:26:04.030]  And, and he grows some pretty big ones. He actually passed away like six months ago and his daughter was selling the cuts at a farmer's market in Bixby.
[01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:10.030]  And so I picked up a few and then I picked up some Baker seeds earlier last fall.
[01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:16.030]  I don't know. I'm into the tomatoes and peppers, dude. So I'm interested. What's up, man?
[01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.030]  Hi, Ron.
[01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:19.030]  Welcome.
[01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:21.030]  How you doing?
[01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.030]  Good.
[01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:33.030]  We were just shooting this shit and then we were chatting and Mr. Trees is a breeder of trees and all things in California.
[01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:36.030]  And we're having a good conversation about kind of where the seed market was going.
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:41.030]  Do you want to just like introduce yourself to everybody so that they don't know you?
[01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:48.030]  Yeah, sure. My name is Ron Harrington. I do some breeding. I work at a LP up here in Alberta, Canada.
[01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:55.030]  And I used to breed trees and different flowers for probably almost 40 years.
[01:26:55.030 --> 01:27:05.030]  And so that's what I've done. A lot of grafting, had crews grafting and, you know, a lot of trees.
[01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:11.030]  And now it's weed, you know, I don't graft it now. I just breed it.
[01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:19.030]  Which is awesome. We have some Kandahar Marupa Reds that we're playing with of Mr. Trees here. Do you want to say hello?
[01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:22.030]  What kind of trees?
[01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:33.800]  I do all kinds of different types of trees, but they're growing some cannabis. They're growing the Kandahar Marupa Red.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]  Oh, nice.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  Yeah, from Afghanistan. And it's been crossed to, you know, some of the some of the elite clones, you know, like the SFV.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.800]  My Pam one cut the ice cream cakes and all those funny things.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.800]  So we're doing a little seed planting thing where everybody's going along and kind of along their own way.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.800]  And everybody's going the same or different strains with the with the same daddies.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.800]  Because it's multiple male, multiple male pollination.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:03.800]  So the same dads pollinated a bunch of different plants and everybody were comparing,
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.800]  comparing notes and seeing what the daddies brought to the table because everybody has different plants.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.800]  And we'll see what what the dad contributes most like most often.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.800]  So that's kind of what this shows about what we're doing here.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  But yeah, but yeah, we're talking about different germination techniques and all different types of things.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  And I was playing with mango seedlings here, talking about selecting different mango seedlings and stuff and stuff like that.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.800]  So you can graph those two.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.800]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Check it out.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:49.180]  There's a right. This is what is this one? This is a peach cobbler peach cobbler mango.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:55.180]  I just unwrapped it because it was the new growth was pushing up against the pair of film too much.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:58.180]  So I gave him a little bit of a breather there.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.180]  Yeah, I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:01.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.180]  I did a lot of chip.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.180]  Or there.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:17.180]  Yeah, I did a lot of chip budding Guatemala and we got a lot of avocados and then some citrus.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.180]  Sweet, sweet.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:19.180]  Yeah.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.180]  Yeah.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.180]  I've been doing a
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.180]  I've got some citrus out there.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.180]  We got some cool.
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.180]  Sharável Coana's.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.180]  We do.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:30.180]  I do all, you know, depending on what the plan is, determines how we're, you know, how I'm going to graph them.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:36.180]  Sometimes I got to cut big trees up and, you know bar graphs and, you know, do some side patch graphs.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.180]  The patchs.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:40.420]  some patch grafting on citrus and stuff. They take a little longer but I do some
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:44.460]  patch grafts that way which is cool. But all kinds of funny stuff. But I like
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:49.860]  doing the young mangoes just some straight up wedge graft, chip graft, you
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:54.620]  know, stuff like that. Right on the top of those a lot of the time for the
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.580]  youngsters and then the old ones I'll do a I'll do a little side veneer graft on
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:03.260]  those underneath the fresh growth. Well you wouldn't do that if you're up in
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:09.460]  Edmonton. No way. You can't even get crab apples to grow up here. It's like
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:28.150]  living on freaking Jupiter. Totally man. The cold is a whole... Go ahead. Is it me
[01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:34.670]  glitching? No no you're good. Go ahead Ron. Go ahead. Oh I just I heard you I heard
[01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:39.630]  Mr. Tree's talking and he went out. Yeah it's like living on Jupiter up here in
[01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:44.670]  Alberta but it's really nice because it cleans the nematodes out the really
[01:30:44.670 --> 01:31:03.980]  cold fruit. You're a little bit glitched in and out there Ron. Is that me that's glitching? A little bit. Are you are you on your phone? Maybe a bunch of...
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:13.700]  Yep yep. If you're on your phone Ron, try what usually happens if you have your
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:20.500]  internet and your phone cell phone reception on at the same time. Oh it's dropped out. If you
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:25.100]  have both of those on at the same time usually it goes back and forth between
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.940]  and gets glitchy and that's what I see there. So if you like turn off your
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:33.820]  cell phone or turn off your internet on your little pull down on your iPhone
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:40.420]  you like top scroll top scroll top scroll and then you just turn off one or
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:44.980]  the other so it doesn't bounce in between the both. It usually levels out a
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:53.620]  little bit. All right well I'll just close a bunch of a bunch of crap. I got a whole
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:32:01.820]  bunch of stuff open. Maybe that's it. There you go. You're coming through. There you go.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:08.940]  Yeah you're clear now. Yeah clear it up. Yep. No the neem tree gets cold so it kills everything. You get lucky you get to put
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.620]  everything to the slumber you know. I'm always battling the last year's problem
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:21.140]  you know. Lucky you say Mr. Tree is lucky eh? Lucky lucky lucky there's enough snow to
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:26.780]  kill everything in sight. Grass is always greener you know. It's funny though.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.660]  Really cold up here a lot of times I do a lot of seeds and I just drop them on
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.020]  the ground they get covered with a couple feet of snow and then in the
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.020]  springtime when it when it thaws out they just come up and they're good to
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:44.700]  like minus 8 minus 9 centigrade and or Celsius whatever the heck it is you know.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.940]  It's like damn cold and they still live so there's something about breeding up
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:57.540]  here for cold stuff that gets really really I don't know acclimated that
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:03.660]  I'm seeing some of the stuff. If I grow stuff from down south I grew some Mendo
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:08.900]  Blue Dream and stuff and if it gets minus 3 it's done and some other stuff
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:17.410]  those good to really cold. It's funny the hazes I've got hazes that are that are
[01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:21.930]  good to really really cold. It'll get so all the leaves and everything else will
[01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:25.930]  wilt but the amnesia haze and a different you know couple of haze
[01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:32.410]  varieties really stay on the cold and you wouldn't think that.
[01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:38.050]  How about moisture towards the end? Oh it's it's a lot of moisture up here.
[01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:43.010]  We're 90% humidity it's been raining for about the last week. I got all kinds of
[01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:47.570]  autos I wish they could flip the camera over and walk outside and show you what
[01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:53.130]  we got but there's all kinds of plants growing outside in the rain wet. Pretty
[01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:57.330]  much all my stuff won't rot. I spray river water on them to try to make them
[01:33:57.330 --> 01:34:01.930]  rot because if they rot you don't want to breed with them right. I only got 81
[01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:10.090]  plants that I mess with in 22 in any one year varieties and so you know you just
[01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:16.370]  you work with stuff that you know that's gonna be good good pyrogeny. I only breed
[01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:22.210]  females so I'm always reversing the ones that I have and then using those on
[01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:26.490]  other people's stuff they say I'll try this try that so I'll try it out I'll
[01:34:26.490 --> 01:34:31.170]  reverse it against it and then grow out you know maybe 50 or 150 and see what
[01:34:31.170 --> 01:34:34.770]  they how they come out and then I'll know what's under the hood in that
[01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:40.250]  particular genetic. And sometimes they just grow pin or buds or big just
[01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:44.370]  larfy crap or whatever it's no good but other times you know I find I'm
[01:34:44.370 --> 01:34:47.930]  unscrambling omelets or something like that. People have made all these
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:55.290]  polyhybrids that are so mixed up and I'm and I'm working hard to get one and then
[01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:59.330]  scramble it to find out what in there and then cross it with other stuff that
[01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:03.770]  I know that'll work well. And so I've gotten a lot of CBG coming out of a
[01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:07.290]  cherry pie that I had from Amsterdam and it almost comes out in anything that I
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:12.090]  cross it to between 2 and 4 percent. So I'm messing around with that a lot and
[01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:18.410]  strains that work on neuropathy because I have neuropathy so pain is a big deal
[01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:26.250]  for me. What strains do you work with I'm curious. I've got a lot of the old ones
[01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:35.330]  I've got haze I've got blue dream I've got some cuts of valley OG I've got ones
[01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:38.850]  that you wouldn't wouldn't be familiar with because I've been breeding them for
[01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:44.370]  about 40 or 50 years going back to Orange County California where I came
[01:35:44.370 --> 01:35:50.690]  and then I moved to I moved up to the Emerald Triangle in outside of Arcata
[01:35:50.690 --> 01:35:56.130]  and we grew up there for a while and then I had kids and so I tapped the
[01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:01.610]  brakes and loved on my kids for a little bit and didn't do that but I kept
[01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:09.610]  resetting my genetic so I have stuff that goes way back that I've kept
[01:36:09.610 --> 01:36:13.610]  breeding with the lines and didn't let them get scrambled up with other stuff
[01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:19.330]  so they're what whatever they were bred for way back then I still have it and so
[01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:27.370]  I'm messing with those too. I've got a bunch of hazes oh I don't know what my
[01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:30.970]  favorite are probably the cherry pie that I have that's an Amsterdam seed
[01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:39.730]  I've got white widow that's original blue gelato 41 I just picked up and I'm
[01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:46.690]  having a ball with that Barney's farm cut or seed but it was from a sift
[01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:53.890]  that somebody did. I'm messing with a bunch. But I get a breed all the time at
[01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:59.330]  work that's what I do and I get actually paid for having fun so you know who
[01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:06.610]  could want any more than that. So on that point I wanted to ask this because I
[01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:10.810]  think this is a fun where we're kind of chatting about earlier was what was
[01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:15.850]  what's your thought on the direction of where you know seed prices are gonna go
[01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:19.970]  because if you look at every other genetic or plant on the market from
[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:26.490]  tomato to apples you know like seeds are not well I mean maybe apples is a poor
[01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:31.450]  example but seeds are not that expensive you know you get 25 pack if
[01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:35.930]  you get like you're you're really cool unique tomatoes you're like 10 maybe 10
[01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:41.810]  bucks max for a pack of 25 you know we're not paying you know 100 to 300
[01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:45.530]  dollars for a pack of 10 what's your opinion on where that's gonna go?
[01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:54.210]  Well I think people could make money on a six pack or 10 pack of feminized seeds
[01:37:54.290 --> 01:38:01.210]  with decent genetics and probably well up here there's a lot of taxes so you
[01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:07.330]  know if the the grower who's bred it and they did their homework it could go for
[01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:12.490]  as long as you make 20 bucks you're golden you know even if you were making
[01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:20.050]  a buck a seed really because you cost about 30 cents or so to make a seed so
[01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:25.010]  you know a good one but but if you you know I'm talking feminized you got a
[01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:29.290]  reverse you've got to follow the process it's got to be done just right at the
[01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:34.050]  right time you don't want little nasty seeds that won't germinate or don't have
[01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:38.850]  enough carbohydrate to make a good plant so it but I don't think it'll go that
[01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:43.770]  low honestly I think it'll probably stick to a couple bucks a seed in the
[01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:53.810]  farmers pocket I hope. Yeah reversing is fun man it's no joke though you your
[01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:59.250]  outcome isn't is always substantially less amount of effort and work in there
[01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:05.130]  it's just it's it's definitely a it's definitely an art to it you know what I
[01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:08.850]  mean it's a fun it's a fun way to do it though I like I like reversing a lot of
[01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:13.130]  stuff I just reversed the SFV again and I put it on all the all the stuff that's
[01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:17.650]  cooking but you know you can sometimes you can you can reverse a couple of
[01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:21.090]  those plants and one of them doesn't really want to drop the pollen and the
[01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:25.050]  other one does all the work for you you know what I mean you kind of you got to
[01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:27.850]  find them just right you got to find those those sweet spots where they
[01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:31.530]  would actually drop pollen you don't have to do a lot of collecting and
[01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:37.690]  smashing and trying and all that other jazz you get it get it to just fully be
[01:39:37.690 --> 01:39:40.730]  able to drop a little bit of that pollen a little easier you know what I mean so
[01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:46.290]  when you've done it a zillion times and that's what I do at work I've made like
[01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:53.410]  five million feeds in the last year so I know the schedule how much early to
[01:39:53.410 --> 01:39:58.930]  start how how hot to mix the STS if I'm reversing like something that's got OG
[01:39:58.930 --> 01:40:03.410]  roots or if it's something it's like a cherry pie or a wedding cake reverses
[01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:08.850]  easier and so you know you just know what you're gonna do I got 28 different
[01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:13.930]  plants reversing right now 12 of them are autos so the way because I got a
[01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:19.330]  sift my that what I want for an auto so I got to take 12 and reverse them so I
[01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:22.970]  can check them for turps and then I'll find out which ones I want and of those
[01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:27.210]  12 I'll keep one or two and then I've got another 20 autos that I'm gonna
[01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:32.090]  pollinate with that so at least that's then I'll do the sift from those 20
[01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:35.490]  which ones look good when that all finishes up and then that's the auto
[01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:41.370]  I'll use to go forward so it's it's a job and when you have to have so many
[01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:46.290]  done at the proper time you know and sometimes like you're right the the
[01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:51.570]  OG's don't nut up really nice or the the ruts but but other ones will just nut
[01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:55.330]  right up and you just tap the tap it and it just would pollinate the whole block
[01:40:55.330 --> 01:41:00.690]  I got six independent houses so I do it in a bunch of different houses so
[01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:04.930]  everything's all separated and those six houses they might have 15 or 18
[01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:05.770]  strains.
[01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:09.970]  That's bitchin' dude that's that's way cool that's way cool.
[01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:14.930]  There's a few plants I've run into like my dog walker it's like I've
[01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:20.130]  I've tried to reverse that thing at least at least 10 or 12 times you know
[01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:26.810]  what I mean and every time the result is always low or or no pollen or other
[01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:32.290]  stuff either with the SPS and and other different ratios there's you know all
[01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:35.130]  different types of things that I that I do and I've tried and I've used you know
[01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:38.810]  to get that thing that actually did nut up and do what it needs to do like the
[01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:43.330]  other ones but most of the time you know if you can you can do it you know there's
[01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:46.170]  there's a method to it you know you can get it to do it just fine but there's
[01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:49.450]  like yeah there's a couple of those and I got mad respect for you for doing the
[01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:52.730]  autos because you can't keep those around you gotta you gotta do them you
[01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:55.570]  gotta do them in numbers you gotta you gotta get you gotta get through them you
[01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:58.410]  got to grow them all out you got you know I mean you got a time you got a
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:02.570]  time capsule on those you can't just like put those ones on hold as easily
[01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:09.050]  you know what I mean so that's a whole nother Andre yeah whole nother ballgame
[01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:13.690]  I don't play with autos very often so you guys I got a question for more even
[01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:18.650]  more than we do you know in general we would use them or deploy them but autos
[01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:25.730]  up north are definitely the you know a good a good way to go right you said
[01:42:25.730 --> 01:42:31.530]  that the dog walker was doesn't like to reverse does that like have anything to
[01:42:31.530 --> 01:42:37.650]  do with how stable the genetics are in that what I mean is the stability in its
[01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:43.890]  sex yeah where it is no it was that has no body it will it will fully reverse it
[01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:48.050]  will be perfect it will be beautiful it'll have a complete a complete
[01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:52.090]  reversal and just look sexy and everything if I use the SDS if I use if
[01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:56.770]  I use a little stronger mixture or I try to play with like a lead excelle or
[01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:59.970]  something like that that like hide makes and stuff that that always will burn up
[01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:03.690]  those plants like really bad but I can I can get that thing to look beautiful
[01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:08.690]  fully reverse but then the pollen it doesn't want it doesn't drop pollen or
[01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:13.170]  if it has pollen it's so little comparison you know compared to you know
[01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:16.650]  compared to the pan or compared to the SFV or compared to those other ones it's
[01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:21.930]  just it's definitely it's it's odd and I don't know if that's like I don't know
[01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:27.090]  if that's common in some plants or not and I'm just it's kind of that's kind of
[01:43:27.090 --> 01:43:35.250]  my my open question there you know I've had you don't want to make pollen yeah
[01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:41.570]  like there's no app it you won't see crap yeah I have the same thing with a
[01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:53.630]  strawberry glue cookies but yeah do you want to go into that Ron look like you're
[01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:58.230]  gonna want to say a little bit more I guess that some of some stranger like
[01:43:58.230 --> 01:44:02.470]  that you know there but that's why I work with only about 22 different ones
[01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:07.070]  that I'm real familiar with so I know my donors inside and out you know I know
[01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:12.230]  what traits they throw I know if there's going to be like a mercine dominant or
[01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:20.590]  little all I got some that I give like a more certain terpenes just go across and
[01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:24.910]  other ones just leave it clean so if I'm like I'm messing around with some
[01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:29.550]  that are really crazy turp it smells like a Japanese a cheap vinyl shower
[01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:33.710]  curtain it's ridiculous and I'm messing with that but I'm throwing it against a
[01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:37.950]  bunch of stuff that I know okay okay okay hold up hold up right I can get
[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:44.670]  wait like like are we talking fresh out of the package like like shower curtain
[01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:49.150]  or are we talking like like the shower curtain that sticks on your leg in the
[01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:53.270]  old hotel you know like the one that's got a little bit of fun to it new car
[01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:59.430]  kind of like fresh out of the package plastic burnt rubber you know just
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:07.470]  ridiculous forever chemical smell yeah yeah like a real chemical smell I'm
[01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:11.390]  breeding with that to see to see if I can fix that because ain't nobody gonna
[01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:18.430]  want to smoke your shower curtains but I think it's got okay okay I'll smoke it
[01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:25.670]  once I'll smoke at least one time everybody's one time right yeah no but
[01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:29.870]  is it like is it that far off because you're a pretty passionate consumer so
[01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:34.230]  you probably like a wide array of stuff is it like does it set you off Ron yeah
[01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:41.070]  yeah it's it's it's kind of bad I mean if you love GMO this might be your thing
[01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:50.310]  but I'm not mr. GMO I'm you know other things so I'm okay with GMO but I don't
[01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:54.710]  the shower curtains just too much it actually makes sure you can't you cough
[01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:59.190]  you'd sneeze you know it blows out your ears it's just it's not right
[01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:14.900]  yes does it get you ripped though oh yeah it's the THC V that I'm messing
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:18.860]  around with it's got an interesting chemotype it gets you ripped in a
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:23.380]  different way it's you kind of feel like okay I'm kind of medicated I'm kind of
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:28.500]  dizzy I went well you know this is it's not your normal thing and so I thought
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:34.260]  well maybe it's gonna be you know the next Charlotte's Web or who knows if
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.260]  there's if there's a group of people that are down to smoke it there's about
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:42.580]  132 of them watching at this point in time of people that are like that sounds
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:52.540]  awesome okay well that see if you could see this right here can you see that
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:57.300]  yeah yeah we can see that pretty clearly that's a that's just a small bowl this
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:24.070]  is a little bowl yeah yeah it's all hash I messed it up oh well just showing off
[01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:29.070]  my hash I had I had some seeds that I cleaned out and I had to get those
[01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:40.110]  washed up good bowl of hash man I love those that's good is that that is that
[01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:47.830]  the THC V stuff or the no no that's just from just different seed a bunch of seed
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:53.510]  runs I take all everything and throw it in a box I pick box just over there and
[01:47:53.510 --> 01:48:02.430]  and then I wash it nice so I got I got to do this because there's there's one
[01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:05.510]  of my fellow producers which are on right now I don't know who's clicky
[01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:09.630]  clicky yeah it's you mr. trees but one of the fellow producers of future
[01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:14.310]  cannabis product is on Ken Somerville now you stop fucking lurking there come
[01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:19.430]  up say hi cuz yes this this fellow is from Edmonton and yes he does outdoor

[01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:37.950]  a damn good day awesome yeah Ronnie when I heard the word
[01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:42.550]  Edmonton it was like hold on here brother yeah pretty close to me cuz I'm
[01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:48.070]  just outside of the Duke oh really yeah LaDuke you're close over by the airport
[01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:54.230]  yeah yeah just a half hour out I'm working on some 105 day autos that you
[01:48:54.230 --> 01:48:59.350]  probably would like there is that potential we'll have to get together
[01:48:59.350 --> 01:49:07.390]  since we're so close yeah pretty real close we will get together okay well I
[01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:12.990]  didn't want to come on I was just I wanted to talk to you afterwards so I'll
[01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:17.310]  jump back off no no no you stay up here you come chill out you're you're you're
[01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:22.910]  you're part of you you're stuck now you're part of the tribe you're like
[01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:26.990]  you've shown your face you don't get to go anywhere you're stuck to the end
[01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:31.550]  there's a couple good questions like first of all I would really love to I'm
[01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:36.590]  gonna nail some of these questions down is like is cuz like you do outdoor
[01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:41.790]  breeding in Alberta which is just a mindfuck and it's just like I just don't
[01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:46.830]  even get it and and and even like so you you mentioned you do the auto flowers
[01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:52.750]  was that your focus and did you always do auto flowers or do you start with
[01:49:56.190 --> 01:50:02.910]  and so I I just I just realized okay I'm smarter than this plant the plant does
[01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:07.270]  what it's supposed to do and I and I had a couple out of flowers that I that I
[01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:13.630]  found that I really liked so okay this is not hey right and and so I thought
[01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:17.350]  okay I'll just if I'll start messing with them because these people aren't
[01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:20.430]  sifting and they're not doing it the right way and I think I can make a
[01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:25.230]  longer I could sift for the instead of for the first one that flowers I'm gonna
[01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:30.670]  I'm gonna sift for the last one that flowers and I'm gonna plant for the one
[01:50:30.670 --> 01:50:36.990]  that I want and and so I said I can shift on both both sides so I figured
[01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:41.710]  well if anybody can do an auto I can do an auto so I'm just gonna I'm gonna do
[01:50:41.710 --> 01:50:45.230]  some autos it's only the last couple of years that I did it because I hate
[01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:53.630]  pulling tarps and so I pulled pulled so many tarps and it's up here in Edmonton
[01:50:53.630 --> 01:50:58.030]  it's it's like living on Jupiter it's either too damn cold and raining or it's
[01:50:58.030 --> 01:51:02.910]  raining and you're pulling tarps or the winds blowing the tarps off or you know
[01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:07.390]  it's always something I have this group on Facebook called artisan cannabis
[01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:12.990]  cultivators that that I that I read and there's this Canadian guy every year
[01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:18.830]  that shows his crop at the you know in the fall time and he's like this is this
[01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:24.230]  northern Canadian dude and he's got like it's no and it snowed overnight and
[01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:29.070]  there's a foot of snow fucking everywhere but for the plants that he's
[01:51:29.070 --> 01:51:32.750]  tarped every night overnight has pulled out every single day and all I'm thinking
[01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:37.550]  is that guy is going out there at fucking god-awful times like just the
[01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:42.710]  cold and the suffering but man like I wonder you there must have been some
[01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:47.190]  special because I've always wondered this like especially when you you play
[01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:50.990]  with temperatures and these these different variables that come on like
[01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:55.110]  you don't you get expressions out of plants that aren't usually typical right
[01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:59.230]  like I got the the fortune chance to try some of your fire and it was it was
[01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:04.310]  badass like it got me intensely high like I was I had to go to the ferry and
[01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:10.910]  I was like I need 20 minutes to drive to the show that Barry White delicious
[01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:16.270]  absolutely delicious so it's like you do you see any much of that like yeah just
[01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:21.830]  like what the fuck's with the cold it's kind of my question it's it's bullshit
[01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:25.870]  but you know we just got to do with it you've seen my those pictures that I sent
[01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:30.910]  in that file I mean that stuff's fire and it's coming from right here and I'm
[01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:36.070]  breathing it up here in the cold and you I you can grow great great great
[01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:39.750]  cannabis up here but you have no choice but to start it early indoors and then
[01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:45.270]  do some depth and you can you can do the good stuff
[01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:54.470]  those little situations London is what makes the cannabis in Alberta the
[01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:58.470]  cannabis that comes from Alberta because it's those stresses that bring
[01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:03.830]  out that extra little bit that you love so much no you know what tell you what
[01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:08.030]  I've never gone to my friends and gone like oh yeah that cannabis from Alberta
[01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:14.550]  a like it's fucking amazing it's never happened in BC I'm sorry I I can say
[01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:22.190]  that now that I've had some but like I think I gotta send you some of my SD I
[01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:36.630]  think reality brother yeah oh well I I'll try anything what but so we were
[01:53:36.630 --> 01:53:41.150]  chat we also asking a little bit earlier what was um oh shit plant directly in
[01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:46.510]  soil or do you do finicky stuff with your plants and and should you like
[01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:50.470]  what's your thought process on that because we got Nick's and Corey's
[01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:54.830]  opinion I love Ken and Ron's opinion on this as well like do you think that we
[01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:59.150]  should as people just just plant seeds and dirt and the ones that pop and we
[01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:02.790]  just that way we only get plants that pop or do you think we should be
[01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:07.750]  finicky paper towel people that put stuff on tables and things like that oh
[01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:13.710]  mr. trees ran out of power for sure I think of both I think both I think that
[01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:19.070]  there's room for for planting them direct outside I got I got probably
[01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:23.510]  5,000 plants growing outside it just grew by themselves I have to weed eat
[01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:28.070]  them you know so they do grow outside really well and I've had some growth
[01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:32.830]  where I haven't done anything to it and it had to be cut down with a chainsaw it
[01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:37.310]  was so big didn't finish because it because I didn't do depth on it but it
[01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:43.030]  was a monster but I grow right into the ground here I just modified the the clay
[01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:52.350]  that I have here with tons of organics and man I any problem no mold no nothing
[01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:57.190]  and my plants they like it you know the organ I got it I'm on a quarter section
[01:54:57.190 --> 01:55:02.230]  so I use I ferment alfalfa and big compost piles and use that for my
[01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:06.150]  fertilizer and and there's natural bug killers here there's these Hornets that
[01:55:06.150 --> 01:55:10.990]  are just ferocious and you know you can get one all full of spider mites in the
[01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:14.590]  house and you can throw it outside and these there's this a buzz of these
[01:55:14.590 --> 01:55:18.510]  little bees and they go around it and just pick all the spider mites off
[01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:25.470]  there's just no way a spider might can survive right here outside yeah I have
[01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:31.350]  I suppose there's a way those damn things but but those bugs are brutal
[01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:37.030]  yeah I have to agree like I know I haven't done cannabis outside but I do a
[01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:41.470]  lot of fruits and vegetables and you know I've been planting just in the dirt
[01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:48.070]  for decades you know the cannabis I've only grown it indoors but I just popped
[01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:51.630]  a bunch of beans that I don't know how old they are they were from a buddy and
[01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:56.990]  I just put them in and whatever came up I figured okay that's what's going to be
[01:55:56.990 --> 01:56:00.710]  the strongest plant and that's what I want I don't want anything weak so why
[01:56:00.710 --> 01:56:04.270]  would I bother with the weak genetics that's that's my personal opinion on it
[01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:13.500]  anyway yeah well I I think that you definitely should baby the plants a
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:18.140]  little bit I start mine in little cups and then you know so I can start them
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:22.820]  early in the house and then like right when it's I don't really acclimatize
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:26.860]  them at all I just take them out out there and plant them in one gallon so I
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:31.340]  go from the solo cups up to a gallon and then that means they're about a month
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:38.300]  old and then that's about it's not the first of June it's like two weeks before
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.540]  the first of June something like that I plant them out and it seems like they
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:47.300]  always get frosted and a few bent leaves but they come out of it and man I'll
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:51.820]  have to send London some pictures of these things I got stumps as big as
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:57:02.320]  silver dollar right now or a toonie if you're up here in Canada what are you
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:09.760]  smoking on mr. cheese jar of Pam one that's what I've been smoking on that
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:17.960]  last couple weeks I've been smoking Pam one through waiting for some waiting for
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:25.040]  some dog walker it's one of my favorites that's coming up some funny
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:31.840]  ones some some of the candahar stuff coming up and but yeah I'm getting I got
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  down and finally I needed a some Pam one refresher so I pulled out a jar of Pam
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.280]  one that's I've been smoking on for less last little while they're waiting for
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.240]  something else to come up so it's a bitch because all my best stuff gets
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.760]  made in the seed so I don't I don't plan my plan my grows properly then you know
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:58.360]  you can be you can be behind in one aspect you know what I mean so you know
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:05.760]  but seeds always more important so everything always gets made to see plenty
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.080]  of seeds if you know you don't have a prime bud there's nothing left okay well
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.280]  I have this little bag of dust that fell off of the seeds when I was shucking them
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.480]  oh yeah nothing for you now you count that as trash that goes in my compost
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:22.920]  that's my mold my my orchard floor yeah people would shit like I would I would
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:28.240]  freak out at my my past self knowing what I do with like you know old buds
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.480]  or stuff that I don't like you know just it's just like man it just becomes mulch
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:38.600]  or you know goes in the compost in different ways and so but it's good it's
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:44.480]  better there it's good there's by the time you're done with seed stuff man
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:50.440]  there's nothing to it that's one thing that I do not like doing this trying to
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:58.200]  sift seed by hand you know like that's painful it's fun it's it's it's there's
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:03.320]  only one thing not as that's that closely compares but is slightly easier
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:08.480]  is trimming no matter what no matter what like you can have machines and
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.760]  stuff you still got to do a lot of stuff by hand you know what I mean like I you
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:22.080]  know it's like you know maybe not you I'll take a hundred thousand seeds and
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.760]  though we'll shuck them shuck them by hand and and I'll use a blow-dryer I get
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:33.480]  a blow-dryer and I blow the chaff out I do it the old-fashioned way but when I'm
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:39.320]  done they're clean they're just dead yeah you got to break it down you got to
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:44.040]  break it down that's always you know it's like yeah and in commercial
[01:59:44.040 --> 02:00:01.600]  cannabis you got to be wearing gloves what a pain huh yeah yeah I'm not
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:09.600]  wearing gloves anymore I'm turning different colors today yeah we can
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:15.360]  always wash our hands and the scissors at the same time what the hell right
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:20.640]  you got mr. trees he's got those those fancy shears that he's got where it's
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.640]  just you know powered on his back and he just walks around pushes a button all
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:33.760]  day oh I think mr. tree he froze but it's a delightful boy moment in time
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:37.360]  for him to freeze usually oh usually they freeze a lot more a lot more like
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:44.640]  that one right there it was like oh look mr. trees is charmingly smiling there
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:53.560]  he's stuck frozen the regular form of mr. trees where it's like just shit I was
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:01:02.520]  I was mid-thought well we were rounding out to the two-hour point usually we we
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.800]  kind of kind of start to dwindle down there so I'll just remind everybody that
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.560]  I know the conversations going well so well we'll cut it all together but like
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:17.080]  I just I just don't even the whole thing baffles me the whole thing the outdoor
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:23.040]  season in general has been kind of meh for me here I wonder how everybody else
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.080]  has been doing with their outdoor if they're doing outdoor or even if they
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.880]  have some other vegetables or but I mean Nick is an outdoor guy so I'd love to
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.360]  know what's going on there too and Ron and as well and the whole the whole
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:40.920]  group anyways it's been shit here wet fucking bullshit but you know what it
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:44.000]  would know it's been great felt it's filtering out plants that get powdery
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.640]  mildew really really easy to tell when they're in veg just be like hey look
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:56.760]  you're gone I don't I don't need you you're gone but maybe we go Nick first
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:07.760]  because I haven't heard from your yourself in a while so yeah I run quite
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:13.880]  a few outdoors you know I got my house my dad's just a whole bunch of friends
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.620]  houses kind of I supply the neighborhood with freaking clones I mean I just give
[02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:21.700]  them away for free so I can run them and see what they are they're all
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:27.300]  females I've already done ran through all the regular seeds and I just I get a
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:31.900]  check out a bunch of different variations I try to keep strains
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:38.300]  specific to people that way I don't have too many like two of these that are these
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:43.940]  strange here you know I try to give people all one strain in particular that
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:51.780]  we've talked over time you know about what they're looking for in type of
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:56.700]  properties healing properties you know some people just don't like to get too
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:02.940]  high I'm the type of person like I want the potency I want to knock your dick
[02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:09.500]  in the dirt weed you know just absolute you can't you can't smoke most people
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:14.660]  can't hang with me and my partner man we just smoke a lot of weed I mean
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:22.100]  literally a lot of weed probably five six pounds a year a lot of weed you
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:28.940]  know and and that's and it's good weed it's not like most people can't finish
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:36.920]  smoking a joint with us kind of weed but uh I right now um you know we it's super
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:46.880]  hot here the humidity is super high like London was saying the powdery mildew I
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.600]  have a few plants out there with powdery mildew that we're gonna have to call or
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:58.600]  whereabouts are you located Nick just just a good people in the in the chat are
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.080]  asking and I guess I should lead with that too
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:08.800]  Northeast Oklahoma Missouri Arkansas Oklahoma line so it's the tri-state area
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:16.200]  it's kind of centrally located here in the US um it don't I'm about a well they
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.840]  the center of the universe what they call it is in Tulsa and that's about 80
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:33.440]  miles from here so yeah it's we have the same altitude as Afghanistan right
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:43.560]  here where we're at and Humboldt so um I'm not sure you know how far off the
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:51.520]  coast that would be because I think we're what 2,000 feet above sea level
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:58.120]  but um that's it's really humid hot here right now we're up into the hundred
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:08.840]  degree days it's about 70 at night and we're spiking 85% humidity most days and
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:13.720]  it's dry as a bone here dry as a freaking bone like there's no water I
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:19.920]  water with a well and we're running dry like and that's not normal for us we
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:24.240]  have underground caverns full of water and they're running kind of dry this
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:32.760]  year it's uh it's gonna be a remarkably dry year and it's gonna be interesting
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:39.800]  to see the strains that actually work well with the drought we use yucca and
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:48.840]  keyaha for to try to help make this you know fixate the water make it wetter and
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:57.600]  try to prolong the water in days because we'll have to split it up and uh you
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:05.000]  know only get this row well I can do two or three rows at a time so but uh
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:12.280]  we're running a few different strains and particularly I like the strains that
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:20.400]  are high in CBD I like the strawberry strains the strawberry cough the old
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:27.240]  hazes I got some some sharks breath I'm running through which is a Jamaican
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:36.960]  heirloom with lambs bread it's a 60 seed I like the 60s weed it seems to be the
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:50.940]  tari weed that gets you stoned you know yeah how about you miss you to work
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:56.940]  outdoors you know that the indica stuff here like the hybrid stuff doesn't I
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:02.940]  don't I don't make it into past the second week of October here it's wet
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:08.860]  super wet and rainy and I don't run greenhouses so you know I'm hard
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:16.700]  everything's got to be up by the 20th through the 15th of October so 7th of
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:26.820]  September all right or it's gone to mold if I'm lucky otherwise Wow that's you got
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:35.860]  very like I'm frozen by September 7th he's like I'm actually in ice October
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:42.020]  we got a foot or two of snow and it's like minus 20 yeah we would be in like
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:52.220]  the 30s and 40s at night and maybe the 60 65 it's in the day about that time
[02:07:52.220 --> 02:08:00.300]  and it just gets cold and wet and rainy and everything would mold and rot on you
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:07.580]  it just be so wet and rainy you need some Colombian strains I think probably
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:11.860]  would probably rock out there in the heat and the funky humidity and all that
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:19.100]  yeah yeah we like to run a bunch of those hash strains indica ones especially
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:27.020]  because we like the the body high or body high kind of people but uh this
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:34.940]  year we're running to quits and to quits OG it's blue dream and Bubba Bubba Kush
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:43.900]  it won a flower award last year for 2021 blue cookies so blue dream and cookies
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:49.660]  are just high yielders you know because you're gonna have that loss we have a
[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:58.420]  really bad moth problem here moth and caterpillar problem and it we thought
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:05.220]  about running those nets mr. trees but they just the amount of rain I think
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:10.580]  would just totally if if there was any rain at all I would just smash the whole
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:18.100]  canopy you know so we kind of opted out of that but we did think it through and
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:29.030]  we got LA confidential that works really well here nice what about what about
[02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:35.430]  let's go to the other side of the world Nick what about you mr. trees it's your
[02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:44.340]  weather like how have your season been it's a wonderful side photo of you and I
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:51.140]  can't hear you at all anybody else not hear him yeah I can't hear either but he
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:10:01.900]  sure has a good grin yeah he sure is I don't I been still not fixing your mic
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:08.540]  there that's the problem try it you're gonna have to come in and out man you're
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:16.340]  gonna have to leave and come back in I'm sorry the sharpie does not work you
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:24.940]  can't write connected just because it's just a lot more fun you can't write
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:33.060]  connected on the cell phone with the sharpie to get it to work nope okay we're
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:41.540]  done we'll come back to them how about you Corey are you doing outdoor are you
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:47.260]  doing vegetables I know you have pretty crappy crappy weather too I have crappy
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:54.380]  weather I do have a few plants outside I I have a day job so a couple of them got
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:59.020]  smoked with the sunlight I didn't get them acclimated but they're coming along
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:06.140]  they'll be okay is that my brother sounds like so packed full now it's
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:16.780]  because you you put a bunch of stuff out there yeah but it worked out okay cuz
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:20.580]  there was a lot of males and Cullen and you know what I mean so it's it's okay
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:27.180]  and the stress that helped out quite a bit showing sex so but generally my
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:33.740]  weather sounds like I'm right in between Nick and Ron you know short but not as
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:39.980]  short as Ron shorter than Nick but the same you know horrible weather and
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:46.460]  humidity at the end so but anything that I put outside I kind of look at it if I
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:51.460]  get anything off of it it's a bonus because I'm not really buying or have
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:57.460]  any seeds from someone who bred for this climate or even you know close to it so
[02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:02.780]  you know I'm trying to collect things that are you know gonna work I'd like to
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:08.500]  run that that that Royal Kenderhag cross outside some point because I think that
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:12.580]  would work you know but no I don't have anything that I can say yeah I've got
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:16.100]  that outside and I'm real excited about it because I think it's gonna do well I
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:26.800]  don't unfortunately my weather is it's it's Southern California man so it's
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:35.960]  it's good it's good here fuck you weird weather that's gonna like change day to
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.920]  day it's it's you know it's it's pretty nice towards the end and as soon as we
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:45.000]  get into September where I'm at I'll have the fog start rolling in at night
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.160]  early morning and that and that you know that it causes some problems in
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:55.920]  some in some cases most of the time not my biggest my biggest issue are like you
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:01.080]  know like too hot you get it'll get you know in the hundreds and if things
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:06.360]  aren't properly you know properly hydrated or or mulched or happy then you
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.920]  can you can piss off your plants really quick out there like that you know so
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:15.120]  they have to be durable to the heat I don't get any rain or very much rain at
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.840]  all until you know sometimes it starts coming in later September you know mid
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.040]  late September but usually it's it's later on and I'll start get rain until
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.360]  January February March usually when rain actually shows up here you know what I
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:36.040]  mean so my biggest issue is the the the worms the you know the ear the ear worms
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:41.400]  they get you know for the outside stuff there it's nothing's off limits you know
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:46.640]  they'll get in everything so early spring I deploy the the dynatrap
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.760]  electric traps around all the all the zones that we're at they start killing
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:54.080]  the the young early you know what I mean so there's less of them floating around
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:14:00.720]  later on years ago I used to I used to try to like let go let let the mob the
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.040]  the wasp out and all that other like beneficial stuff but I don't bother with
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.440]  that anymore I grow them up to the size they need and then I'll build an
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.800]  artificial hoop PVC or or other other types of stuff and I'll put up a
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.800]  structure I'll throw a mosquito netting over the hoop and I'll keep them in
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.880]  there so I don't have to spray them with any BTs or anything they're unsprayed
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:26.880]  unmessed with beautiful and I'll get all my crop no no questions asked
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:30.680]  worst part about that is like I said as soon as late September starts rolling in
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:34.960]  the fog starts coming in they'll clog up the pores of that of that fabric so if
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.560]  you don't make an adequate you know cover then and your plants are too close
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:42.840]  to the edges of that fabric you can get some you can get some problems that way
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:47.440]  but I find that by the time you make a proper a proper structure with plenty of
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.960]  room everything's looking good it's dry enough where I'm at to where by the time
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.200]  that Sun comes up it's dryer and it dries it right out no problem everything's
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.160]  perfect and ever since I started deploying all out that that tech man
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.120]  it's it's it's a game changer you can't do it you can't do it by the acre you
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:08.920]  know what I mean you can do it you can do it on a good you can set up a good
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.440]  thing you know you mean get a lot of work done that way I mean don't don't
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.680]  shake a stick at sure but you're not gonna do heck here's that way that's for
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.960]  sure you're gonna have to break out the BT and the other stuff like that but
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:28.760]  yeah the the heat is really humidity is always like you know it's it's it's good
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:33.440]  where I'm at it's it's all it's always it's always pretty good I can't I don't
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:40.760]  get a lot of Sun so I mean I'll get 15 hours you know Sun 15 and a half hours
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.720]  of Sun so if I put plants out too early they don't have problems my crop I'm
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:48.320]  doing clones and other stuff like that I'll have problems with the crop but
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:54.040]  not too early so things will go in go get all wonky and confused and you know
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.040]  that stuff so over the years I've learned put things out late we put
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.680]  things out late June first week or two of July the old clones get it finally
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:07.440]  come outside and play but all my shit is durable I take my pan one out not too
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:12.000]  long ago and took some of those out and I don't even have to harden them off I
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.720]  basically just took her out fucking stuck her outside and the next day she
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  was praying like a goddamn super star you know what I mean so there's a few
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.640]  plants that just they miss the orchard they know it there it's like their home
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:29.320]  you know they're ready to go back and all my old clones all the old 20 year
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:35.360]  olds all the like the royal cushions and the PAMs and all the the SFE's and all
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:39.200]  those ones get to go outside they get to get plugged into the ground get a
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:43.120]  rejuvenate those bad boys and you take some fresh clones off those those
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.040]  healthy ass outdoor grown you know clones and then you can bring those
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:56.080]  inside and they over winter healthy and rocket I'm thankful man I'm thankful I
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:00.440]  got the weather because I can I can pretty much have stuff out all year I
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:05.880]  could run long flowering friggin you know Colombians and equatorial site type
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:10.400]  stuff or I could run short stuff quick I can do a little bit of both I can start
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:14.280]  stuff inside and flower and then kick them outside and let them finish out
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.800]  outside in a lot of cases I can do weird things where like you know it's
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.440]  it's cool it's cool to play around you know start stuff in the middle of winter
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:24.360]  run it in the greenhouse and just keep the greenhouse hot with different
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.320]  compost piles and stuff you know what I mean like just mr. trees you see what
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:36.640]  London's doing now my wife was sitting here she's going tell him he's number
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:47.440]  one you know what it costs in propane a year you a little greenhouse you know
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.000]  what it costs me in propane a year to heat a greenhouse fucking pain in the
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  ass man it's like a tank every five days and then you get in the middle of winter
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.560]  and it starts snowing I'm I'm in the one place in Canada where you could heat a
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:09.160]  greenhouse with that with a propane heater probably there's not another
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:13.880]  place in Canada where you could pull that off but in in this little corner of
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.440]  Vancouver there's enough taste temperate enough that you could that you could
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.000]  pull it off so you can do like I can start stuff anytime of the year I can
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.280]  have stuff going because I have that have the light out here and everything
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:34.520]  like that I do I do do the light depth I started that at July 1st so today so
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:39.320]  that is harvested by September by mid-september latest you know and and
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.280]  that'll be you know as hard as I'll go for the outdoor otherwise it's like hey
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:47.840]  hopefully something pollinates a group of my favorite stuff and I got a few
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:52.120]  pollinators out and I just want to collect some seeds see what happens but
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:57.160]  other than that it's just like kind of smeh you know no high expectations as
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.080]  long as I get some good vegetables and carrots and other things out of the out
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:06.000]  of the yard I'm happy I don't need I don't need a lot of weed what I need is
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.440]  some snacks for my kids and if they if they're able to run over and pull a
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:15.480]  carrot out or a tomato off and take a bite then that that makes me makes me
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.960]  happy I can keep the weed in the tent and on the side part but that being said
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:24.680]  it would be really nice to have I got some like s1's of limoncello and like
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:34.000]  the Sweet Island skunk award winner like from what's his name Jason why am I
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:42.680]  having yeah you know I'm talking yeah so I generation yeah and and so I got they
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:49.240]  took the s1 that Ryan Lee got the s1 of it and generated it myself from the
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:53.320]  cutting so I've got that one that I planted and I've got a few of those and
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:58.560]  they got a really beautiful aroma to them so they're very nice and very
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:02.440]  delicious so I can't wait to see how they generate I've got a couple I've got
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:06.760]  so that I've got one outdoor bed that has been like the I don't give a fuck
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.480]  bed from last year where it's like I literally have taken all the green
[02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:16.160]  matter and just throws hey green matter and maybe like some old root balls and
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:22.720]  stuff like that and it's one corner and the plant is like like grown up to fence
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.880]  height it's getting huge and it's doing really really really well and I've given
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:33.760]  it nothing I have like my aqua poco gold mum it's like a Barney farms like like
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:37.480]  is a beautiful plant but it's not like a traditional aqua poco gold like land
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:43.120]  like like hardcore land race at Eva but it's like it's it's nice but holy crap
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:46.800]  it's doing fucking well and it was like kind of one of those moments it's like
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:53.440]  well if that does so well there why am I doing all this shit over here and like
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:59.440]  why don't I take a break with this or readjust my mental escape with that kind
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.160]  of kind of figure out where to go you know what I mean
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:08.240]  well finding that micro climate in your own yard is is a wonderful thing I've
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:13.160]  got a couple of them in mine where you know one plant is gonna do sit that
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:19.360]  where the next one beside it it just doesn't like that microclimate but in
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:24.480]  Alberta like myself I've never tried cannabis outside since the 80s and then
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:29.040]  it was never we never got it to finish because well the cops were happy to be
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:33.200]  chasing us through the fields when we were trying to harvest it but you know
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:38.160]  it was still it wasn't quite ready to be harvested in any way but here if we're
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:43.000]  not you know starting our seedlings indoors for a garden you know and we
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:52.550]  expect it to finish on time there's just no way it isn't gonna happen yeah
[02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:57.710]  yeah I hate pulling tarps man I don't even have any like weather issues to
[02:21:57.710 --> 02:22:01.310]  deal with it's just time it always falls in the wrong time of day and it's like
[02:22:01.310 --> 02:22:05.830]  you got to be on time and stuff but you guys man stuff that don't finish those
[02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:09.310]  tarps are a lifesaver you know what I mean to get things you know finished off
[02:22:09.310 --> 02:22:13.350]  quick and rushed out of that rushed out of the of harm's way you know what I
[02:22:13.350 --> 02:22:18.910]  mean that's that's like so crucial man I don't I don't envy the struggle I mean
[02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:24.230]  I don't envy have what you have to deal with but I respect your struggle because
[02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:29.130]  it's like fuck man to pull in some some ganja and that in the northerly climate
[02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:33.510]  like that outside I mean that's you can get growing stuff I mean you are you can
[02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:39.430]  grow you can grow some stuff you know so that's mass respect you know so no doubt
[02:22:39.430 --> 02:22:44.070]  about that well that's for Ron because I haven't tried cannabis outdoors I
[02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:48.110]  think if I was gonna try to be strictly an auto flower because I wouldn't have
[02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:52.830]  to worry about it but indoors yeah like I'm running six harvests a year when I
[02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:57.550]  had my trailer going because everything was climate controlled the heating the
[02:22:57.550 --> 02:23:04.440]  cooling everything was done I didn't have to worry about it yeah well we all
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.560]  six of my houses are all light depth so there's just no other way I go out there
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:15.160]  about a couple weeks before June starts and sometimes I have to use a sled to
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:19.760]  shuttle the plants from my grow indoors to over there where they go in the
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:25.560]  greenhouses I got got a wood stove up there and sometimes I got to go out at
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:28.920]  3 in the morning and throw some more wood in the stove if it's a real cold
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:34.840]  one so I know it's not possible but I also imagine you ice fishing at the same
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:40.120]  time yeah I know you're not planting trees on a lake but I feel like those
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:45.560]  two things like you should be out there doing that yeah I've ice fished I like
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:52.120]  eating a good jackfish but but it's it's cannabis for me as you know you get that
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:57.080]  about three months of summer here and it's so it's always it's like always
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:01.960]  winter it's like winter or you've got four months to prepare for winter so you
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:06.880]  know it's it's kind of a bullshit place to live and to grow you know but you
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:10.840]  know I married a Canadian fell in love with somebody from here beautiful
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:16.160]  grandchildren from up here so you know I can live on Jupiter if I have to for a
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:25.160]  while I always find a way that's right that's right that's cool that's why I
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:29.400]  moved to the Okanogan for a couple of years it was a lot warmer there than in
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.680]  Alberta but then the wife had me come back to Edmonton because that's where
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:39.560]  her parents were so I'm stuck here for a while yeah the family sure sticks you in there but
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:45.160]  London he's over there fully baked in in the same area and he was just complaining
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:49.360]  about the weather it's like I'd take that in a second I'm like I'm like I'm
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:55.760]  going I got an acre in southern Italy like I'm going to where it never freezes
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:04.760]  again I am done I am NOT built for this I am NOT built for this
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  I gotta cut out it says my battery's gonna cut out
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:12.360]  anyways thank you so much Ron for for stepping in and we'll call it at the end
