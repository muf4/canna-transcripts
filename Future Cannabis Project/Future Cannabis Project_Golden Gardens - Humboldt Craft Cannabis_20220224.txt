[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  Okay, I'm here with Jill from Golden Gardens Farm and we're gonna be talking about her farm a bit and checking out her flower.
[00:07.080 --> 00:12.100]  So, hi Jill. Hello. How's it going? Good. Good. Glad to be here today. Me too.
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.680]  So tell us a little bit about your background with cannabis and you know, how you got started. Well,
[00:18.560 --> 00:26.120]  my husband has a degree in horticulture and landscape design from Michigan State University and he started growing in college. Cool. And we met in
[00:26.960 --> 00:28.960]  2011 in San Francisco.
[00:29.440 --> 00:33.600]  My background is in construction management and together we realized
[00:34.240 --> 00:37.600]  we wanted to get out of the rat race and the corporate jobs that we're in.
[00:38.080 --> 00:45.800]  And we together had the experience to start cultivating cannabis. Nice. We started indoors in San Francisco and the East Bay.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.440]  Okay. And had the opportunity to move up to Humboldt when legalization came around, which was great.
[00:52.440 --> 00:59.280]  We were a bit more interested in or we were excited about being outdoors and
[01:00.920 --> 01:02.920]  gardening a plant is
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.380]  awesome, but we were walking into a concrete building every day still under
[01:07.840 --> 01:16.080]  fake lights with de-hues and CO2 emitters and air conditioning. And so we ourselves wanted to be
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.820]  gardening outside in the garden and how much more would the plants like that too?
[01:21.980 --> 01:28.100]  So we jumped on the opportunity to come up here and have been here since. Amazing. That's awesome.
[01:29.540 --> 01:30.940]  Why do you,
[01:30.940 --> 01:37.220]  what draws you to farming? Like what is it just the freedom of not being attached to the corporate jobs? Because I get that.
[01:37.380 --> 01:40.380]  Yeah. But is there something else you like about it?
[01:40.380 --> 01:46.060]  There's also farming not only cannabis, but having the ability up here to grow our own food,
[01:47.060 --> 01:52.580]  farm vegetables, work with the soil. You're really a soil farmer if you're a farmer or a gardener. Yeah.
[01:53.860 --> 01:57.020]  But working outside and in nature and with nature,
[01:58.220 --> 02:02.940]  having hands in the soil, touching the plants, being active and in it is
[02:03.740 --> 02:10.380]  hard to explain, but it's very, can be very stressful owning your own business, but it can also be very meditative.
[02:11.220 --> 02:13.900]  Just putting on a podcast or music and just
[02:14.820 --> 02:20.980]  connecting with the plants and figuring out what they need, what they want. Yeah, for sure. I hear it. I know it. So
[02:22.260 --> 02:27.580]  anything unique about your farm? Like is it an interesting microclimate, challenges? Like what's...
[02:28.220 --> 02:35.180]  We're at about 1,800 feet. Okay, so relatively high. Yeah, we were up there. We have a very small farm
[02:36.100 --> 02:40.540]  and my husband and I and we have one employee out there full-time,
[02:41.420 --> 02:42.940]  which
[02:42.940 --> 02:48.740]  allows us to be very hands-on. We go through and touch every plant multiple times through its life.
[02:49.380 --> 02:52.980]  We have beds, but we have fabric side beds.
[02:53.580 --> 02:58.300]  So we actually do three runs a year. We do a spring, a summer and a fall run.
[02:58.300 --> 03:05.700]  Oh, yeah. Having the fabric beds allows the beds to breathe when it's not necessarily hot outside and then you can still water.
[03:05.980 --> 03:11.300]  Yeah, water. Consistently. Better drying. And it dries out. Exactly. Yeah, it makes sense.
[03:11.300 --> 03:17.740]  Yeah, the springtime, I used to do some springtime runs too, like March, April. Yep, and they're very challenging. Yeah.
[03:18.860 --> 03:26.580]  Temperature and moisture levels. Yeah, in April when the daylight is about 12-12, that's when we start our first run.
[03:27.140 --> 03:33.980]  Typically. Yeah. Some cultivars do better than others in the spring, we have found for sure. Some are a bit more robust and
[03:34.700 --> 03:36.260]  tend to
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.980]  not necessarily
[03:37.980 --> 03:44.300]  notice the cold at the beginning of their life. And then by the time that they're harvested in June,
[03:44.860 --> 03:46.860]  it's warm and dry outside.
[03:48.220 --> 03:52.820]  You feel like, I mean intuitively when I just, when you say that, I think about like more, you know,
[03:53.100 --> 03:56.740]  for lack of a better word, Indica dominant or broadleaf, you know, like Afghan
[03:58.100 --> 04:02.740]  varieties that are just used to the cold. I don't, do you feel like that's true or not?
[04:02.740 --> 04:04.580]  Um, I
[04:04.580 --> 04:08.980]  haven't noticed that in particular. We don't go through a lot of varieties because of our size.
[04:09.140 --> 04:12.500]  We can't have many cultivars or we don't have enough material of each.
[04:12.500 --> 04:17.260]  Ah, yeah, of course. So we can only have a few. Yeah, so that's a unique challenge for you guys. That's true.
[04:17.260 --> 04:22.140]  That is a unique challenge and just keeping up with the industry. Right now, we still have to grow something high
[04:22.740 --> 04:29.060]  in THC to have it move. Yeah. So your options are kind of limited. What we have found the best
[04:29.580 --> 04:33.940]  is the longer the flower cycle, the better it does in the spring.
[04:34.580 --> 04:40.980]  Probably because it has more of its life. Oh sure, like the later. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. It's like the later,
[04:41.660 --> 04:45.420]  by the time it's flowering week five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[04:45.660 --> 04:48.100]  it's, you know, the development of those flowers can
[04:48.820 --> 04:54.300]  rapidly expand and if it's already warmer out, then that's the right time for that. Exactly. That's interesting.
[04:54.300 --> 04:58.940]  A shorter strain in the spring is not good. Although we do pick a shorter week strain for our fall run.
[04:59.460 --> 05:05.500]  Six to seven weeks strain because now it's finishing when it's getting cold and the lights decreasing outside more and more.
[05:06.020 --> 05:12.820]  Do you feel like there's any other, like do you have any interesting management practices just regarding, you know,
[05:14.020 --> 05:16.980]  methodologies you use, like in terms of inputs or?
[05:18.220 --> 05:22.340]  We get our... Say that again? Been working on any?
[05:23.340 --> 05:28.580]  My husband has the horticulture major, so he kind of, he understands the science of it and that's where I've learned most of
[05:28.940 --> 05:30.940]  the science of cultivation.
[05:32.060 --> 05:36.460]  We do get our soil tested and have amendments made to the soil. Cool.
[05:37.020 --> 05:42.580]  And we fight a lot, you know, as a farmer, like I said before, you're a soil farmer.
[05:42.580 --> 05:45.700]  So we, it all starts in the soil. We fight a lot of
[05:46.700 --> 05:51.780]  molds, mildews, bugs, a lot of that stuff can be fought if you treat your soil correctly and they don't have a place to
[05:51.980 --> 05:53.980]  breed and develop.
[05:54.500 --> 06:00.620]  So, let's see. So speaking of your farm and flowers, let's check out some of these flowers.
[06:00.620 --> 06:05.380]  You brought two samples for us today. Yep. I got an apple fritter. Oh, an apple fritter. Yeah.
[06:06.380 --> 06:10.220]  This is, you'd think I'd see more of these strains
[06:10.740 --> 06:15.420]  as I go around. So these, funny, funnily enough, some of these are first for me. So that's great.
[06:15.420 --> 06:19.540]  So let's see. Apple fritter is a good one. It grows on our property really well.
[06:19.660 --> 06:23.020]  Oh, it smells good. Yeah.
[06:23.580 --> 06:27.420]  We used to grow sherbert and those sweet strains and this
[06:27.940 --> 06:34.980]  grows very similar to that. Oh, it's just sticky to the touch. Like it's already like tacky, like sticky, sticky.
[06:35.380 --> 06:41.300]  This one came out of our fall run actually. So we harvested it. Oh man, it's all, it's got some nice purple hues to it.
[06:41.900 --> 06:44.220]  It really almost has that apple-y.
[06:45.520 --> 06:47.100]  Oh wow.
[06:47.100 --> 06:53.420]  It almost smells like my wife's making like green apples into a pie or something. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting.
[06:53.500 --> 06:58.740]  Yeah, it's amazing. And this was, was this DEP? Yep. Yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah, DEP.
[06:58.740 --> 07:06.140]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we have a full DEP farm. Amazing. And then we have the P-U-C.
[07:06.660 --> 07:11.980]  Pineapple upside down cake. That one I know. That's a shorter life cycle.
[07:12.580 --> 07:16.860]  It does good for us in the fall and the cold at the end of the
[07:17.620 --> 07:23.340]  flowers life. Yeah. Wow. Makes colors come out. Hmm. It's got that pineapple smell.
[07:23.340 --> 07:30.100]  Oh, it's so loud. The chirps are so loud. Yeah, that one is. Did they ever do any concentrate processing with this one?
[07:30.100 --> 07:34.200]  And you guys just sell flowers. We just sell flowers. Okay. I'm not sure.
[07:34.660 --> 07:35.740]  Hmm.
[07:35.740 --> 07:38.900]  Wow. Right now. Yeah, that's amazing. Right now. You never know. Yeah.
[07:39.820 --> 07:41.820]  There's another year ahead.
[07:42.500 --> 07:44.500]  Wow. And then
[07:45.300 --> 07:48.300]  do you guys sell locally or do you have products around the state?
[07:48.980 --> 07:50.700]  Right now we wholesale.
[07:50.700 --> 07:57.380]  One of the questions we've been asking everyone, if you could change one thing in the industry, whether it's like through education or regulation,
[07:58.180 --> 08:00.180]  what would that, what would that be?
[08:02.100 --> 08:04.100]  I think
[08:04.780 --> 08:09.700]  the biggest thing for me right now would probably be consumer education and
[08:10.580 --> 08:17.380]  understanding. I mean, I don't think any of us really understand what this plant fully can do, but just to understand,
[08:18.020 --> 08:23.460]  right now it's so much about THC. Yeah. And, and personally coming from indoor and now moving to outdoor,
[08:23.460 --> 08:26.260]  you see how much more the terpene profile
[08:28.500 --> 08:33.100]  gives the plant its full, full potential, full expression and
[08:34.100 --> 08:40.700]  how much more important that can be. Yeah. And how you can have a very low THC plant that has the terpene profile that speaks to
[08:40.700 --> 08:45.460]  what you need or what you're feeling and it can be the best strain you've ever smelled.
[08:45.460 --> 08:49.860]  And even minor cannabinoids like other minor cannabinoids. For sure. Yeah, exactly.
[08:50.660 --> 08:56.740]  Yeah, I agree. I think there's a lot of research that's, that's going into that. I think there's a podcast, Kiss Organics.
[08:56.740 --> 08:58.740]  I don't know if you know this guy. Yeah.
[08:58.820 --> 09:02.100]  A while back had an episode. I wish I could remember which one it was, but it was a
[09:02.580 --> 09:08.580]  scientist lady and I think they were out in Colorado. I'm probably wrong. But basically the study was they did a blind study
[09:09.100 --> 09:15.580]  where people smoked weed and they were doing high THC weed and basically, you know,
[09:15.580 --> 09:22.220]  15, like a 30% THC versus a 15% with minor cannabinoids and higher terpene levels. And they showed that
[09:22.820 --> 09:30.500]  consistently people chose the lower THC weed because it just made them feel better. Right. It was better body high. Absolutely. Just in general
[09:30.940 --> 09:36.100]  well-being, better feeling of well-being overall. Right. So I think we got a lot of ways to go with that,
[09:36.100 --> 09:41.220]  but hopefully we can get there. And education's key. We should talk more about it because I'd be interested in helping with.
[09:41.300 --> 09:45.220]  For sure. I think a big way to do that is what many people have say is
[09:46.100 --> 09:48.100]  farmer to consumer sales.
[09:48.620 --> 09:55.580]  Because if you think about the vegetable industry and how you go to farmers markets and you can talk to the person that grew what
[09:55.580 --> 09:58.940]  you're buying and you're about to consume, you know, if we could have
[09:59.820 --> 10:05.420]  cannabis farmers markets, that's the best way to, maybe not the best, but it's a great way to educate the customer.
[10:05.420 --> 10:12.180]  I think they can now talk to the farmer, the gardener who grew it. That's a great goal to strive for. Yeah, absolutely.
[10:12.780 --> 10:15.460]  Let me think. There's one more thing. I don't know if you want to talk about it,
[10:15.460 --> 10:20.900]  but do you have anything that makes you'd like to, you know, single out your product against like a corporate model?
[10:20.900 --> 10:24.720]  Like what what do you think makes your product better than, you know, just like mass-produced weed?
[10:25.560 --> 10:32.600]  I would think the biggest thing is the love and care we put out there. It's me and my husband. We're in our front yard.
[10:33.120 --> 10:40.360]  We have one worker and we're all out there across from each other looking at the plants, caring about what the plants need.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.560]  Individual needs. Yeah, I'll go out there to our employee and I'll be like I may be the owner,
[10:45.560 --> 10:48.560]  but these ladies are the boss. What they need goes.
[10:49.040 --> 10:54.600]  You know, if they have a different schedule, we cater to that. Absolutely. And it shows in the flower. So, thank you. Awesome.
[10:54.600 --> 10:58.360]  Thanks for that. I appreciate it. Thanks for your time today. Yeah, thank you. All right. Have a good one.
