[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  Damn it.
[00:14.230 --> 00:17.110]  Oh, big ups everybody.
[00:17.110 --> 00:22.110]  We're back with another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show
[00:22.150 --> 00:24.050]  and we've been chatting for a couple of minutes
[00:24.050 --> 00:25.270]  behind the scenes and I already know
[00:25.270 --> 00:27.350]  that this is going to be a really fun one.
[00:28.310 --> 00:30.350]  One love, how are you doing this evening?
[00:30.350 --> 00:32.750]  I'm doing very well, thank you Chad.
[00:32.750 --> 00:33.590]  How are you doing?
[00:33.590 --> 00:35.510]  Good, I'm doing great.
[00:35.510 --> 00:38.390]  And this is actually for, you know, the people tuning in
[00:38.390 --> 00:40.790]  and all the people that watch this on replay
[00:40.790 --> 00:43.210]  get a lot of replays, that's very awesome.
[00:44.070 --> 00:45.750]  This is the first time we've met,
[00:45.750 --> 00:48.990]  but this was something that Peter has been asking
[00:48.990 --> 00:50.110]  for a long time, he's like,
[00:50.110 --> 00:51.910]  dude, you need to talk to this guy.
[00:51.910 --> 00:53.270]  You should really set this up.
[00:53.270 --> 00:56.950]  I think you guys will, you know, have a good conversation.
[00:56.950 --> 00:58.110]  Fricking absolutely dude.
[00:58.110 --> 01:01.830]  So many commonalities that we have.
[01:01.830 --> 01:05.690]  Like I'm pretty stoked to do this.
[01:06.530 --> 01:09.530]  Welcome everybody joining in chat again.
[01:09.530 --> 01:13.530]  So, I mean, there's a lot of places we could go.
[01:13.530 --> 01:15.970]  We've kind of talked in the emails behind the scenes
[01:15.970 --> 01:17.890]  and we do actually have a lot in common,
[01:17.890 --> 01:20.210]  which I'm not surprised why Peter set this up.
[01:20.210 --> 01:21.810]  Thank you, Peter.
[01:21.810 --> 01:22.970]  I'm stoked.
[01:22.970 --> 01:25.090]  Thanks Peter, for sure.
[01:25.090 --> 01:27.010]  And I'll say, I don't know if you remember Peter,
[01:27.010 --> 01:31.890]  we met back in the day in Oregon at one of the cups
[01:31.890 --> 01:34.650]  when I was working for a girl out there in Oregon.
[01:34.650 --> 01:36.810]  So hello again and thank you.
[01:38.210 --> 01:40.670]  Yeah, and he's, you know, big, big thank you to him.
[01:40.670 --> 01:42.610]  He's introduced me to some cool people
[01:42.610 --> 01:44.890]  along the way, along this journey.
[01:44.890 --> 01:46.730]  And I'm stoked to meet another person.
[01:46.730 --> 01:50.170]  Cause again, we're a big community and you know,
[01:50.170 --> 01:52.490]  some people are a little bit more, you know,
[01:52.490 --> 01:53.530]  shy than others.
[01:53.530 --> 01:56.650]  Some people you can't, whoa, can't get enough of.
[01:56.650 --> 01:58.490]  Other people you're just like, man,
[01:58.490 --> 02:00.290]  wish that person would come out.
[02:00.290 --> 02:02.810]  And it's cool to meet new people
[02:02.810 --> 02:04.210]  cause we all have a passion, dude.
[02:04.770 --> 02:05.610]  We all got a passion for it.
[02:05.610 --> 02:07.970]  The plant, you know, this plant's a magical plant.
[02:07.970 --> 02:11.210]  And I think this platform really provides
[02:11.210 --> 02:14.610]  a really cool network with, you know,
[02:14.610 --> 02:16.650]  people like-minded people linking up
[02:16.650 --> 02:18.530]  all kind of surrounded around the plant
[02:18.530 --> 02:20.970]  and the spiderweb effect that, you know,
[02:20.970 --> 02:23.570]  she has on my life for sure.
[02:24.430 --> 02:27.370]  Yeah, she definitely does have a spiderweb effect.
[02:27.370 --> 02:30.450]  We were just talking about making a connection I made
[02:30.450 --> 02:34.850]  like 20, 30 odd years later, almost 25 years later
[02:34.850 --> 02:37.610]  of two people that we had met.
[02:37.610 --> 02:41.290]  So it's been kind of a long journey and for me,
[02:41.290 --> 02:43.090]  and you know, I guess, you know,
[02:43.090 --> 02:47.090]  I'd love to hear about kind of your journey with cannabis.
[02:47.090 --> 02:50.090]  You know, I started young, but how about yourself?
[02:50.090 --> 02:52.090]  When did you kind of come across it?
[02:52.090 --> 02:53.810]  Do you remember how you came across it?
[02:53.810 --> 02:55.370]  Was it peer pressure?
[02:55.370 --> 02:58.650]  Oh, it was, I wouldn't say it was peer pressure at all.
[02:58.650 --> 03:03.650]  I mean, I was, I think 11 or 12, sorry, mom.
[03:04.970 --> 03:07.610]  I remember it was at my best friend, Brandon's house.
[03:07.610 --> 03:11.490]  What up, if you see this, we were just playing video games.
[03:11.490 --> 03:15.330]  I think it was like Madden or NHL or something.
[03:15.330 --> 03:16.570]  And I just kind of looked around
[03:16.570 --> 03:18.490]  and nobody was in the room.
[03:18.490 --> 03:20.450]  And I was like, huh, I wonder where everyone's at.
[03:20.450 --> 03:21.850]  And I kind of go check around
[03:21.850 --> 03:25.010]  and there I'm his sister's balcony
[03:25.010 --> 03:27.050]  smoking out of this cool glass pipe.
[03:27.050 --> 03:28.250]  And I'm like, what's that?
[03:28.890 --> 03:29.730]  And they're like, it's weed.
[03:29.730 --> 03:30.930]  I'm like, that's weed?
[03:30.930 --> 03:32.570]  You know, that looks interesting.
[03:32.570 --> 03:35.010]  And they're like, you don't have to try it.
[03:35.010 --> 03:36.010]  Like, it's all good.
[03:36.010 --> 03:38.610]  Like, you know, it's, you know,
[03:38.610 --> 03:39.690]  and I was like, no, I'll try it.
[03:39.690 --> 03:40.570]  Yeah, I'll try it.
[03:40.570 --> 03:43.010]  And so I remember taking a hit
[03:43.010 --> 03:44.650]  and just coughing my lungs out
[03:44.650 --> 03:47.490]  and not really feeling anything.
[03:47.490 --> 03:49.850]  You know, the bowl went around a few times, I was coughing.
[03:49.850 --> 03:52.010]  And then I took another hit and that's like,
[03:52.010 --> 03:53.330]  that's the one that kind of rocked me.
[03:53.330 --> 03:56.530]  And then I remember going back into the room
[03:56.530 --> 03:57.730]  and just kind of laying there
[03:58.250 --> 04:01.250]  and just kind of like having this weird energy fit,
[04:01.250 --> 04:02.810]  you know, just kind of just sitting there,
[04:02.810 --> 04:05.810]  but just being like, what's this is,
[04:05.810 --> 04:07.490]  you know, just kind of turned on, you know,
[04:07.490 --> 04:09.930]  as some people say, it was just really interesting.
[04:09.930 --> 04:13.410]  So that was the spark that ignited my journey.
[04:13.410 --> 04:16.170]  And it was very enjoyable, memorable,
[04:16.170 --> 04:18.690]  because it was just so interesting and new.
[04:20.050 --> 04:23.730]  And I wasn't really a daily user for a while.
[04:23.730 --> 04:26.970]  I mean, I would say probably a daily user too young,
[04:27.490 --> 04:28.610]  I started using,
[04:31.090 --> 04:32.490]  you know, I was just young and dumb,
[04:32.490 --> 04:34.970]  misguided youth drinking and smoking
[04:34.970 --> 04:36.570]  and probably way too young.
[04:36.570 --> 04:39.250]  And, you know, my parents,
[04:39.250 --> 04:41.050]  God bless them, did everything they could,
[04:41.050 --> 04:44.530]  but I got kicked out as a teenager
[04:44.530 --> 04:49.530]  and just kind of finished high school and moved to Tahoe.
[04:51.610 --> 04:56.330]  And it was funny because I moved to Squaw.
[04:56.330 --> 05:01.330]  And it says in their employee handbook that they drug test.
[05:04.330 --> 05:06.290]  And I was like, well, shit, you know,
[05:06.290 --> 05:08.730]  I might either be homeless with no job
[05:08.730 --> 05:10.890]  or get, you know, move into employee housing
[05:10.890 --> 05:13.690]  and snowboard, you know?
[05:13.690 --> 05:15.650]  So I mean, like that was, might as well,
[05:15.650 --> 05:17.010]  I'll be sober for a while, you know?
[05:17.010 --> 05:19.970]  And so I moved into this employee housing
[05:19.970 --> 05:24.570]  and everybody there was burning tough.
[05:24.570 --> 05:25.410]  So I was like.
[05:26.290 --> 05:27.370]  Yeah, wait a minute.
[05:27.370 --> 05:29.490]  Was this like pre-employment testing?
[05:29.490 --> 05:32.770]  I was like, fuck, do they not care that they have a secret?
[05:32.770 --> 05:35.170]  And then like, they, everyone thought it was a square.
[05:35.170 --> 05:37.370]  Cause I was just, you know, in my area,
[05:37.370 --> 05:38.930]  just reading or something, you know,
[05:38.930 --> 05:41.130]  just waiting for the snow to fall and work to go.
[05:41.130 --> 05:43.170]  And then, you know, everyone's like,
[05:43.170 --> 05:44.130]  oh, this guy's a square.
[05:44.130 --> 05:45.050]  What's up, you don't burn?
[05:45.050 --> 05:46.250]  I was like, don't they drug test?
[05:46.250 --> 05:47.650]  And they're like, no, dude,
[05:47.650 --> 05:49.610]  they just say that to kind of ward off people.
[05:49.610 --> 05:50.890]  You know, if you, if you fuck up,
[05:50.890 --> 05:52.650]  they'll drug test you, but not.
[05:52.650 --> 05:53.490]  There you go.
[05:53.490 --> 05:54.330]  And so I was like, I'm done, you know?
[05:54.330 --> 05:56.170]  So it was definitely a very heavy user
[05:56.170 --> 05:57.930]  all throughout high school.
[05:57.930 --> 06:01.690]  I actually, in high school had a scoliosis
[06:01.690 --> 06:06.490]  and a very bad scoliosis to where they wanted to operate.
[06:06.490 --> 06:07.330]  Wow.
[06:08.210 --> 06:10.810]  I didn't want to, my mom was a nurse.
[06:10.810 --> 06:13.050]  She was kind of like, that's the gnarly surgery.
[06:13.050 --> 06:13.970]  Is there anything else?
[06:13.970 --> 06:16.050]  You know, she was really looking out for me
[06:16.050 --> 06:19.690]  and I had to wear like a doctor prescribed back brace.
[06:19.690 --> 06:21.730]  Like, you know, like, yep.
[06:22.290 --> 06:23.130]  Yeah.
[06:23.130 --> 06:24.130]  Keep the chest back.
[06:24.130 --> 06:26.170]  Yeah. My, my posture is not the best, but.
[06:26.170 --> 06:27.810]  You know, like, I mean, I was bad.
[06:27.810 --> 06:29.810]  I was like noticeably, you know, bad.
[06:29.810 --> 06:33.050]  It was in like, cry, you know, pain, you know, very bad.
[06:33.050 --> 06:33.890]  Yeah.
[06:33.890 --> 06:38.730]  You know, I, I got, was given like opiates to help
[06:38.730 --> 06:41.770]  as a youth and definitely misuse those, you know?
[06:41.770 --> 06:45.570]  So like in anybody in those opiates, be careful,
[06:45.570 --> 06:47.650]  be very careful.
[06:47.650 --> 06:48.490]  Yeah.
[06:48.490 --> 06:51.210]  So yeah, you know, just definitely, and that, you know,
[06:51.730 --> 06:53.570]  I used cannabis to get me out of that hole, you know,
[06:53.570 --> 06:55.850]  there was a, there was a definitely dark time in my life
[06:55.850 --> 07:00.050]  and I just leaning on cannabis to get me out of that gnarly,
[07:00.050 --> 07:00.890]  you know.
[07:00.890 --> 07:02.610]  Did your, did your parents know?
[07:02.610 --> 07:05.250]  Were you open with like the cannabis use at that point?
[07:05.250 --> 07:06.490]  And how it helped?
[07:06.490 --> 07:07.330]  They hated it.
[07:07.330 --> 07:10.570]  They, I mean, I was grounded all the time.
[07:10.570 --> 07:11.490]  I would sneak out.
[07:11.490 --> 07:13.730]  I was a wild youth, you know, like,
[07:13.730 --> 07:16.130]  I'm grateful for my journey, but you know, my,
[07:16.130 --> 07:18.050]  I definitely gave my parents a hard time.
[07:18.050 --> 07:22.330]  Like it was, it was, I was, I was a lucky kid and,
[07:22.330 --> 07:26.930]  you know, barely graduated and it wasn't,
[07:26.930 --> 07:29.730]  I just didn't want to be there, you know, it was just like.
[07:29.730 --> 07:30.730]  Yeah, I get it, man.
[07:30.730 --> 07:31.570]  I was.
[07:31.570 --> 07:33.770]  You know, you were talking about how, you know,
[07:33.770 --> 07:35.850]  my, it was a little bit of rough road, you know.
[07:35.850 --> 07:38.250]  Yeah. I got kicked out, you know, I was 16.
[07:38.250 --> 07:39.090]  I was on my own.
[07:39.090 --> 07:40.650]  I, you know, I got kicked out of school.
[07:40.650 --> 07:43.250]  So I like went to a couple of different alternative schools,
[07:43.250 --> 07:44.370]  got kicked out.
[07:44.370 --> 07:47.170]  And then finally I landed at this, this school.
[07:47.170 --> 07:49.970]  And, you know, you had to have like a B average
[07:49.970 --> 07:53.810]  to stay there, but they had got a grant the year before
[07:53.810 --> 07:55.570]  to build a music studio.
[07:55.570 --> 07:56.810]  That kept my interest.
[07:56.810 --> 07:59.810]  And the history teacher let me write reports about like,
[07:59.810 --> 08:02.050]  ACLU, like your rights and the cops.
[08:02.050 --> 08:03.770]  Like I got credit for that shit.
[08:03.770 --> 08:04.610]  So.
[08:04.610 --> 08:05.450]  Yeah. So that's badass.
[08:05.450 --> 08:07.530]  You know, like, you know, the struggles.
[08:07.530 --> 08:09.330]  I was like, I mean, you were,
[08:09.330 --> 08:11.210]  were you consuming at that age?
[08:11.210 --> 08:12.050]  Yeah, definitely.
[08:12.050 --> 08:13.850]  I was, you know, I was consuming
[08:13.850 --> 08:15.890]  and I was trying to think of it before we started.
[08:15.890 --> 08:19.330]  I was either like 13 or 14 is when I probably started.
[08:19.330 --> 08:22.170]  Like I wasn't open about it with my parents.
[08:22.170 --> 08:26.010]  Like, I honestly don't think they knew, but you know,
[08:26.010 --> 08:28.290]  I was kind of a handful in many other ways anyways,
[08:28.290 --> 08:31.290]  punk rock skateboarder in like a suburbia.
[08:31.290 --> 08:33.130]  So that didn't go too well.
[08:33.130 --> 08:34.090]  And yeah, I can relate.
[08:34.090 --> 08:35.530]  You know, I was a hip hop head
[08:35.530 --> 08:38.010]  and I kind of low frequency music at the time
[08:38.010 --> 08:42.650]  and like low frequency media, you know, all of it.
[08:42.650 --> 08:45.330]  Just kind of, I'm grateful, you know,
[08:45.770 --> 08:47.570]  I'm grateful I dealt with that as a youth, you know,
[08:47.570 --> 08:50.210]  cause like I do have a family that was like looking
[08:50.210 --> 08:52.090]  out for me as much as they could, you know,
[08:52.090 --> 08:55.810]  and it was just like, I, yeah, I'm just grateful, you know.
[08:55.810 --> 08:58.330]  Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you had it around
[08:58.330 --> 08:59.530]  or at least that you found it
[08:59.530 --> 09:00.850]  and maybe voiced your opinion too.
[09:00.850 --> 09:02.570]  Cause opiates at a young age, man.
[09:02.570 --> 09:05.570]  Yeah. I mean, I was the age where they were giving Ritalin
[09:05.570 --> 09:07.730]  to every kid and you know, they'd be crushing it up
[09:07.730 --> 09:10.130]  and snorting it as basically prescription speed.
[09:10.130 --> 09:13.650]  So there's so many things that they just pushed
[09:13.650 --> 09:17.010]  onto kids that I don't, maybe they don't know
[09:17.010 --> 09:18.970]  or they don't care about the consequences
[09:18.970 --> 09:23.610]  but cannabis has helped a lot of people make that move away
[09:23.610 --> 09:24.450]  from opioids.
[09:24.450 --> 09:26.290]  So, yeah.
[09:26.290 --> 09:27.110]  I'll be real.
[09:27.110 --> 09:29.610]  Like my, you know, my mom was just worried about me.
[09:29.610 --> 09:32.090]  So I was just like in and out of the doctors all the time
[09:32.090 --> 09:35.130]  just because she was concerned and they were like,
[09:35.130 --> 09:37.610]  give them Adderall, you know, give them opiates.
[09:37.610 --> 09:39.610]  So he's depressed, give him antidepressants.
[09:39.610 --> 09:42.970]  I was in high school being forced to take opiates,
[09:42.970 --> 09:45.250]  antidepressants and Adderall with it.
[09:45.250 --> 09:46.490]  You know what the fuck that is?
[09:46.490 --> 09:47.330]  That's so.
[09:47.330 --> 09:48.150]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[09:48.150 --> 09:51.210]  So I mean like my chemistry was all,
[09:51.210 --> 09:52.490]  all over the place, you know?
[09:52.490 --> 09:56.050]  So it was just, cannabis was the only thing to help.
[09:56.050 --> 09:59.210]  Like cannabis was the only thing that was like,
[09:59.210 --> 10:01.890]  all right, like I can finally chill.
[10:01.890 --> 10:05.530]  Like, and yeah, I mean, it was kind of cool
[10:05.530 --> 10:08.210]  that I kind of got out on my own at young
[10:08.210 --> 10:10.290]  because I mean, cannabis was all I leaned on.
[10:10.290 --> 10:12.690]  It's kind of what put food in my pocket.
[10:13.410 --> 10:14.490]  Cause being a lift op.
[10:16.530 --> 10:18.250]  You do it for the love.
[10:18.250 --> 10:19.330]  I mean, yeah, exactly.
[10:19.330 --> 10:22.450]  You do it for pre powder runs that you couldn't pay for.
[10:22.450 --> 10:24.610]  I mean, I'll get paid pennies and, you know,
[10:24.610 --> 10:28.530]  hustle on the side and get powder runs every day.
[10:28.530 --> 10:29.370]  You know what I mean?
[10:29.370 --> 10:30.190]  I used to get.
[10:30.190 --> 10:31.030]  Yeah, it's worth it.
[10:31.030 --> 10:34.290]  150 days a season on the mountain.
[10:34.290 --> 10:36.010]  And like, it was worth it.
[10:36.010 --> 10:37.410]  It was definitely worth it at the time.
[10:37.410 --> 10:40.210]  If you're young and you have nothing to do
[10:40.210 --> 10:42.610]  and you're really confused and not sure what's up,
[10:43.490 --> 10:44.330]  go shred.
[10:44.330 --> 10:45.570]  Like if you want, if you're a beach dude, go surf,
[10:45.570 --> 10:47.370]  you know, like go figure it out.
[10:47.370 --> 10:49.770]  Go be in nature, you know, like go bike ride,
[10:49.770 --> 10:51.770]  you know, go do something until you figure it out.
[10:51.770 --> 10:52.610]  Cause that's what I did.
[10:52.610 --> 10:57.170]  Like I just, you know, snowboarded and grew herb,
[10:57.170 --> 11:00.410]  you know, moving on the side and just got by until like,
[11:01.770 --> 11:03.250]  I kind of figured it was my passion
[11:03.250 --> 11:06.010]  and it was my, it was the direction that I was going.
[11:06.010 --> 11:09.130]  Cause snowboarding just beats you up as fun as it is.
[11:09.130 --> 11:11.070]  And like broken bones.
[11:11.070 --> 11:13.870]  I've had five major concussions where you wake up
[11:13.870 --> 11:15.910]  with people surrounding you, like you okay?
[11:15.910 --> 11:17.690]  And I'm like, I mean, one of my,
[11:17.690 --> 11:21.110]  I woke up to being gurneyed on a helicopter
[11:21.110 --> 11:22.150]  and got all combative.
[11:23.070 --> 11:23.910]  Oh yeah, man.
[11:23.910 --> 11:27.110]  I've been, I used to go hard when I was a kid.
[11:27.110 --> 11:28.310]  I was a junkie.
[11:28.310 --> 11:32.470]  I was like, you know, like let's go big.
[11:32.470 --> 11:34.430]  Never took a helicopter ride though.
[11:34.430 --> 11:36.190]  Never took a helicopter, knock on wood, man.
[11:36.190 --> 11:37.490]  I'm not done yet, but.
[11:38.830 --> 11:40.350]  Yeah, I mean, I just pushed it.
[11:40.790 --> 11:44.550]  I hit the big 60, 80 foot jumps at Swall Valley Park
[11:44.550 --> 11:45.710]  where they used to film.
[11:45.710 --> 11:47.790]  I mean like, I wouldn't be doing huge,
[11:47.790 --> 11:49.630]  like McTwists and shit on them,
[11:49.630 --> 11:52.670]  but I'd at least, you know, sack up and try and hit them.
[11:52.670 --> 11:54.950]  And it was definitely big boy shit.
[11:54.950 --> 11:56.750]  Just, yeah, just going off it, man.
[11:56.750 --> 12:00.510]  Committing like the whole, the physics behind snowboarding,
[12:00.510 --> 12:02.830]  like how everything is mapped out these days
[12:02.830 --> 12:03.650]  and they're getting, you know,
[12:03.650 --> 12:08.650]  like 250 foot like launches is just insane.
[12:08.690 --> 12:10.690]  Respect, like, yeah.
[12:10.690 --> 12:12.370]  Yeah, the physics of it.
[12:12.370 --> 12:15.210]  Humans aren't meant to do these things and yet they do it.
[12:15.210 --> 12:18.130]  But there was an era where it's like,
[12:18.130 --> 12:20.730]  that looks steep, think I can make it.
[12:20.730 --> 12:22.010]  Just go fast.
[12:22.010 --> 12:23.410]  That's how it was.
[12:23.410 --> 12:24.530]  I mean, that was my era.
[12:24.530 --> 12:26.810]  Squalor, I mean, before it got bought out,
[12:26.810 --> 12:29.010]  I mean, back when it was privately,
[12:29.010 --> 12:31.650]  it was one of the last privately owned resorts in Tahoe
[12:31.650 --> 12:33.970]  when I was there and it was a bad-ass mountain.
[12:33.970 --> 12:36.130]  I mean, if you know, you know, it's big boy shit.
[12:36.130 --> 12:41.130]  And I mean, I went 100 plus feet to my back
[12:41.730 --> 12:44.210]  and bruised both my kidneys
[12:44.210 --> 12:45.930]  and was peeing blood for a week.
[12:45.930 --> 12:46.770]  You know what I mean?
[12:46.770 --> 12:48.450]  Like, I just, that was just like,
[12:48.450 --> 12:51.050]  hey, have you hit that?
[12:51.050 --> 12:51.890]  No?
[12:51.890 --> 12:54.410]  All right, I'll point it, you know, like go for it.
[12:54.410 --> 12:55.250]  You know what I mean?
[12:55.250 --> 12:58.370]  Most of the time it was good, but nine out of, you know,
[12:58.370 --> 13:01.490]  that one time is the one time and I'm grateful, you know?
[13:01.490 --> 13:05.570]  I mean, I've woken up in tree wells and yeah, it's scary.
[13:05.570 --> 13:08.810]  I mean, the passion that, you know, even with cannabis,
[13:08.810 --> 13:10.490]  I mean, cannabis back in the day can get you
[13:10.490 --> 13:13.450]  into some scary situations, but that passion drove you,
[13:13.450 --> 13:14.290]  you know what I mean?
[13:14.290 --> 13:16.610]  That's that passion that makes you do some weird shit
[13:16.610 --> 13:18.010]  sometimes, you know?
[13:18.010 --> 13:19.610]  Send it, send it.
[13:19.610 --> 13:23.530]  Yes, now I look before I leap, but yeah, no, I've never,
[13:23.530 --> 13:25.690]  I mean, in all honesty, I've never gone that big at all,
[13:25.690 --> 13:27.410]  but I've been around the people.
[13:27.410 --> 13:31.530]  I'm the one at the bottom being like, all right, go, send it.
[13:31.530 --> 13:34.290]  So the town I'm talking about, if you know Squaw Valley,
[13:34.330 --> 13:37.890]  it was the Far East chairlift on a powder day.
[13:37.890 --> 13:40.610]  If you send the Far East chairlift, Lookers Right,
[13:40.610 --> 13:44.090]  directly to Red Dog, under chair and send it,
[13:44.090 --> 13:45.850]  you can go far.
[13:45.850 --> 13:46.690]  Like, send it.
[13:46.690 --> 13:48.530]  You can go far.
[13:49.330 --> 13:50.770]  As well said.
[13:51.850 --> 13:55.490]  So with the cannabis, when you were young, you know,
[13:55.490 --> 13:59.410]  did you, you know, I was just, I didn't know anybody
[13:59.410 --> 14:01.290]  who grew for like the longest time.
[14:01.290 --> 14:03.410]  It was always just scoring off of somebody
[14:03.410 --> 14:05.770]  and then buying the big sacks and breaking that up.
[14:05.770 --> 14:09.490]  But it was a long time before I knew anybody that grew.
[14:09.490 --> 14:11.730]  I mean, I was always a third party,
[14:11.730 --> 14:13.330]  really when I was younger.
[14:13.330 --> 14:16.010]  I was, I gotta say, I was pretty lucky
[14:16.010 --> 14:17.930]  with the quality I had back in the day.
[14:17.930 --> 14:20.850]  I mean, hearing some of the stories on, you know,
[14:20.850 --> 14:22.410]  this platform, I feel blessed.
[14:22.410 --> 14:24.890]  I mean, I grew up smoking really good herb.
[14:24.890 --> 14:27.370]  I grew up in the Sacramento area.
[14:27.370 --> 14:31.050]  And I feel like with all the high grade outdoor coming down
[14:31.050 --> 14:34.210]  from Northtown and all the high grade indoor
[14:34.210 --> 14:38.130]  all over California, I mean, I remember just good,
[14:38.130 --> 14:40.410]  good herb, like good, sticky high grade.
[14:40.410 --> 14:42.130]  And I was just lucky.
[14:42.130 --> 14:45.090]  And I definitely always had more than enough around.
[14:45.090 --> 14:47.290]  And, you know, it was just kind of a thing.
[14:47.290 --> 14:50.210]  And it was, I never knew growers until I was probably,
[14:50.210 --> 14:54.210]  growers until I was out of high school.
[14:54.210 --> 14:58.010]  And my first year out of Squaw Valley,
[14:58.050 --> 15:01.530]  like my first summer out of working at Squaw Valley,
[15:01.530 --> 15:04.130]  I was dating a chick and she knew a crew
[15:04.130 --> 15:06.810]  out on the coast in NorCal and we went out and trimmed.
[15:06.810 --> 15:08.730]  And that was the scene.
[15:08.730 --> 15:10.810]  That was where I first was like,
[15:10.810 --> 15:13.810]  and they were growing perpy manca balls.
[15:13.810 --> 15:15.570]  And it was beautiful.
[15:15.570 --> 15:19.130]  It was like my first time seeing over a hundred plants
[15:19.130 --> 15:21.890]  and really high grade, high grade.
[15:21.890 --> 15:23.250]  They had, you know, they were doing it.
[15:23.250 --> 15:25.490]  They had greenhouse, they had gorilla patches.
[15:25.490 --> 15:30.130]  They, I was, they were feeding, they were old time.
[15:30.130 --> 15:33.250]  You know, they had organic outdoor garden,
[15:33.250 --> 15:34.770]  food garden that they ate from.
[15:34.770 --> 15:38.770]  They only went to town like every other week,
[15:38.770 --> 15:40.650]  maybe once a month, you know, they were,
[15:40.650 --> 15:41.730]  we were out of cuts.
[15:41.730 --> 15:46.050]  It was a beautiful, beautiful introduction to the scene.
[15:46.050 --> 15:48.170]  I mean, that crew, that crew, I think,
[15:48.170 --> 15:50.090]  pick up and left when it got legal.
[15:50.090 --> 15:52.530]  I think they were there because they were just old timer.
[15:52.530 --> 15:55.450]  I mean, like they were gray and old when I met them.
[15:56.290 --> 16:00.370]  And they were respect to them, like big ups, like, yeah.
[16:00.370 --> 16:04.490]  And so that was my first time seeing herb was big time.
[16:04.490 --> 16:06.970]  And, you know, I've always, when I was younger,
[16:06.970 --> 16:08.170]  I saw a lot of dried herb.
[16:08.170 --> 16:09.610]  I just never seen it growing.
[16:10.450 --> 16:11.530]  Me, yeah, me too.
[16:11.530 --> 16:13.730]  The first, the first time you walk into a room,
[16:13.730 --> 16:17.850]  especially a room or, you know, a facility of that size,
[16:17.850 --> 16:19.410]  I still remember it, dude.
[16:19.410 --> 16:22.250]  I still remember like the feeling, my eyes going like this,
[16:22.290 --> 16:25.490]  I've been smoking for a long time.
[16:25.490 --> 16:27.210]  And then, oh God, yeah.
[16:28.210 --> 16:31.530]  In high school, I'd seen garbage bags or, you know, like,
[16:31.530 --> 16:35.810]  I move, I, yeah, we were young and dumb, you know,
[16:35.810 --> 16:38.570]  like I seen a lot and like, when I,
[16:38.570 --> 16:40.410]  but when I saw the plants,
[16:40.410 --> 16:42.490]  when I saw plants the size of me,
[16:42.490 --> 16:44.690]  like a few hundred plants the size of me,
[16:44.690 --> 16:48.130]  and I'm like, oh wow.
[16:48.130 --> 16:49.290]  I love you.
[16:49.290 --> 16:51.210]  Yeah, like, and it was funny
[16:51.210 --> 16:53.930]  because it was my first time trimming and I was just like.
[16:53.930 --> 16:55.410]  Yep, me too.
[16:55.410 --> 16:56.890]  That was my first experience.
[16:56.890 --> 16:59.690]  A friend of a friend was like, we need help.
[16:59.690 --> 17:01.170]  We need help trimming.
[17:01.170 --> 17:02.850]  Like, it was funny, you know,
[17:02.850 --> 17:04.210]  because I was just in awe, you know,
[17:04.210 --> 17:05.810]  they were like, yo, speed it up, kid.
[17:05.810 --> 17:06.650]  Like.
[17:06.650 --> 17:11.650]  Yes, I, dude, I seriously probably took two hours
[17:11.770 --> 17:12.850]  on one plant.
[17:12.850 --> 17:15.490]  Like, they just let me do it.
[17:15.490 --> 17:17.890]  And every now and then I'd cut off like a big nugget,
[17:17.890 --> 17:19.250]  oh, I'm sorry, what did I do with this?
[17:19.250 --> 17:20.210]  Toss it over there.
[17:21.090 --> 17:23.330]  They humored me, but yeah.
[17:23.330 --> 17:26.090]  Yeah, so yeah, that was my first time seeing a lot of herb,
[17:26.090 --> 17:28.730]  you know, it was 18, yeah.
[17:28.730 --> 17:30.770]  And I mean, that was kind of my thing though.
[17:30.770 --> 17:34.330]  Every summer hit the festival tour, you know,
[17:34.330 --> 17:38.570]  dig some holes for a friend, get some product, move around,
[17:38.570 --> 17:43.130]  come trim time, go trim, winter time, go shred,
[17:43.130 --> 17:45.290]  get repeat, you know, I did that for years,
[17:45.290 --> 17:46.930]  like many, many years, 10 years.
[17:46.930 --> 17:51.930]  So like I've hit 14 festivals
[17:52.210 --> 17:54.170]  with a lot of music shows in between, you know,
[17:54.170 --> 17:57.570]  hip hop shows, reggae shows, Northwest string fest,
[17:57.570 --> 18:01.970]  Northwest reggae fest, like reggae rising.
[18:03.330 --> 18:05.010]  Did you ever go to reggae on the river?
[18:05.010 --> 18:06.610]  Yeah, reggae on the river.
[18:06.610 --> 18:08.330]  My favorite, I did that a lot,
[18:08.330 --> 18:11.050]  but my favorite was the Northwest.
[18:11.050 --> 18:11.970]  String summit?
[18:11.970 --> 18:13.530]  No, yeah, that was dope.
[18:13.530 --> 18:16.250]  And that was actually the first time I found Chemdog
[18:16.290 --> 18:19.290]  when I was like 20, I was like, that was some high grade.
[18:19.290 --> 18:20.970]  Yes, that was memorable.
[18:20.970 --> 18:22.890]  I love that, that just ended the other year,
[18:22.890 --> 18:23.730]  but sorry, go on.
[18:23.730 --> 18:28.650]  High Sierra world music festival in right in Boonville,
[18:28.650 --> 18:30.810]  big ups back to that whole crew.
[18:31.890 --> 18:34.330]  That was magical, those years were magical, you know,
[18:34.330 --> 18:36.610]  like, yeah, that was my thing.
[18:36.610 --> 18:37.890]  It was just really rootsy, you know,
[18:37.890 --> 18:41.490]  reggae on the river was kind of a little different vibe,
[18:41.490 --> 18:42.850]  really fun, really fun,
[18:42.850 --> 18:45.250]  but the other one was a little bit more rootsy.
[18:45.250 --> 18:46.970]  I love reggae, big up.
[18:46.970 --> 18:48.290]  I mean, that's how I got my name
[18:48.290 --> 18:49.530]  is because on the mountain,
[18:49.530 --> 18:51.530]  I just bumped reggae all the time.
[18:51.530 --> 18:54.010]  Just reggae, reggae, reggae,
[18:54.010 --> 18:56.490]  just super positive, showing love.
[18:56.490 --> 18:58.090]  I mean, it'd be a rainy day out there.
[18:58.090 --> 18:59.690]  I'd just be playing reggae like,
[18:59.690 --> 19:02.370]  hey, what's up, how are you?
[19:02.370 --> 19:03.650]  Yeah, exactly, you know,
[19:03.650 --> 19:06.490]  like my boss actually gave me the name One Love.
[19:06.490 --> 19:08.410]  Like, and I was just kind of like,
[19:08.410 --> 19:10.050]  why do you keep calling me One Love?
[19:10.050 --> 19:12.130]  And he was like, because that's who you are, man.
[19:12.170 --> 19:15.250]  Like, play reggae all the time.
[19:15.250 --> 19:17.890]  You're obviously lit 24 seven.
[19:18.810 --> 19:21.850]  Oh no, he's like, oh, he knows, he knows.
[19:21.850 --> 19:23.890]  Exactly, I mean, he was my boss.
[19:23.890 --> 19:25.330]  He's like, you're super positive.
[19:25.330 --> 19:26.810]  He's like, you're one of the most positive people
[19:26.810 --> 19:27.650]  I've ever met.
[19:27.650 --> 19:29.250]  I mean, like, yeah, I mean,
[19:29.250 --> 19:31.970]  we'd have radios on the mountain, you know,
[19:31.970 --> 19:33.450]  I was a supervisor and he'd be like,
[19:33.450 --> 19:34.610]  you know, One Love, One Love.
[19:34.610 --> 19:36.530]  And so like, I mean,
[19:36.530 --> 19:38.810]  this was a whole crew of people calling me One Love
[19:38.810 --> 19:40.810]  and before I even embodied the name.
[19:40.850 --> 19:43.050]  And so like when the social media stuff,
[19:43.050 --> 19:45.930]  or like even, you know, in the trim scene back in the day,
[19:45.930 --> 19:48.210]  before it was a thing, you know,
[19:48.210 --> 19:51.250]  you couldn't write your name on anything, you know?
[19:51.250 --> 19:53.890]  So we always had our symbols.
[19:53.890 --> 19:57.130]  And so that One Love symbol was one of my symbols
[19:57.130 --> 20:01.210]  that I'd have on my, you know, my trim log or whatever.
[20:01.210 --> 20:03.770]  So yeah, I mean, blah, blah, blah.
[20:03.770 --> 20:04.610]  Sorry, I'm rambling.
[20:04.610 --> 20:06.410]  I just smoked a lot of herb.
[20:07.330 --> 20:08.290]  No, and it's okay.
[20:08.290 --> 20:09.410]  I'm gonna smoke with you too.
[20:09.450 --> 20:10.970]  You were not rambling at all.
[20:10.970 --> 20:12.730]  And I was, I was gonna ask you, you know,
[20:12.730 --> 20:14.210]  how you did get the name One Love
[20:14.210 --> 20:15.650]  because immediately when I saw it
[20:15.650 --> 20:17.770]  and then I saw your logo and the colors, I'm like,
[20:17.770 --> 20:20.370]  oh, you know, it's kind of like reggae head, I'm guessing.
[20:20.370 --> 20:21.210]  Oh yeah.
[20:21.210 --> 20:22.490]  Look at me stereotyping, but.
[20:22.490 --> 20:23.330]  Yeah.
[20:23.330 --> 20:26.610]  I'm glad you said you liked reggae and all this stuff.
[20:26.610 --> 20:30.090]  I mean, I was a grind ball shredder back in the day,
[20:30.090 --> 20:32.210]  like beard down to here.
[20:32.210 --> 20:34.490]  And I'm not saying people with long beards are grind ball.
[20:34.490 --> 20:38.210]  I'm just saying like dirty, not clean, dirty beard.
[20:39.210 --> 20:41.010]  I only had dreads cause it was nappy.
[20:41.010 --> 20:42.050]  It was a beaver tail.
[20:42.050 --> 20:43.730]  It wasn't like nice.
[20:43.730 --> 20:48.210]  I was a grind ball snowboarder, like shredded by.
[20:48.210 --> 20:51.210]  The original Wookiee, the original Wookiee.
[20:51.210 --> 20:53.370]  Yeah, like, yeah, just didn't care.
[20:53.370 --> 20:56.770]  I was like, wake up, shred, go to sleep, shred, party,
[20:56.770 --> 21:01.770]  shred, you know, like it was the lifestyle, you know.
[21:01.770 --> 21:02.610]  Definitely.
[21:02.610 --> 21:05.090]  They did scare me away from doing the,
[21:05.090 --> 21:08.170]  applying for that position because of the drug testing,
[21:09.130 --> 21:12.170]  so I didn't make it, but I did have a friend who did.
[21:12.170 --> 21:15.210]  And I did go and stay up at the lodging there.
[21:15.210 --> 21:17.490]  And that was a party, man.
[21:17.490 --> 21:19.730]  You ride during the day and then you party at night
[21:19.730 --> 21:22.850]  and you build weird shit to ride off of and picnic tables.
[21:22.850 --> 21:25.210]  And then you go and do it all again the next day.
[21:25.210 --> 21:26.050]  Exactly.
[21:26.050 --> 21:28.890]  And I fell in love with that culture, man.
[21:28.890 --> 21:31.370]  Like, you know, coming from the suburbs
[21:31.370 --> 21:34.330]  and just being kind of like a misguided youth
[21:34.330 --> 21:36.690]  and just kind of like not really sure what's up.
[21:37.650 --> 21:40.650]  The snowboarding scene was what, I loved it, you know,
[21:40.650 --> 21:43.690]  like I got sponsored eventually, so I got free decks,
[21:43.690 --> 21:47.610]  you know, like snowboard boots and like just,
[21:47.610 --> 21:51.010]  I mean, it was, I was good, but I wasn't like professional.
[21:51.010 --> 21:54.330]  Like I've entered a few contests and won some money
[21:54.330 --> 21:56.970]  and I was just like, but I'm not, I'm no one special
[21:56.970 --> 21:58.170]  when it comes to snowboarding.
[21:58.170 --> 22:00.930]  I like, I've beat myself up and I walked away
[22:00.930 --> 22:04.090]  from that life because of massive head drama.
[22:04.090 --> 22:07.770]  So like, I just, I love it, I live it.
[22:07.770 --> 22:11.450]  I moved to Colorado to be closer to it, you know what I mean?
[22:11.450 --> 22:12.890]  Like.
[22:12.890 --> 22:13.810]  Dedicated.
[22:13.810 --> 22:15.650]  It is a lifestyle though, man.
[22:15.650 --> 22:16.530]  It really is.
[22:16.530 --> 22:18.090]  Like you mentioned earlier, you know,
[22:18.090 --> 22:21.410]  go to the mountains or go surf, you know,
[22:21.410 --> 22:24.410]  they're still, but they're humbling.
[22:24.410 --> 22:27.930]  They give, they teach a certain perspective to people
[22:27.930 --> 22:31.890]  that you have to carry when you're in their environment.
[22:31.930 --> 22:34.250]  And I think that does carry over to a lot
[22:34.250 --> 22:36.570]  of like cannabis philosophy, because it's really humbling,
[22:36.570 --> 22:39.250]  man, I mean, one avalanche, one wrong jump,
[22:39.250 --> 22:42.930]  one, you know, ice patch, you could be just over.
[22:42.930 --> 22:46.210]  I've, I should have died a few times on the mountain.
[22:46.210 --> 22:47.890]  Knock on wood, I haven't.
[22:47.890 --> 22:49.690]  And I'm more humble for it.
[22:49.690 --> 22:53.730]  Same man, I mean, like, you just gave me goosebumps.
[22:53.730 --> 22:56.210]  I mean, I'm like, that's the only thing that scares me.
[22:56.210 --> 22:57.690]  I'm like, I don't fear much.
[22:57.690 --> 22:59.810]  I fear like the loss of my freedom
[22:59.810 --> 23:02.010]  and dying in an avalanche, you know, like,
[23:03.250 --> 23:04.970]  and then I was in Hawaii eating,
[23:04.970 --> 23:06.970]  you're getting eaten by a tiger shark.
[23:06.970 --> 23:09.130]  Yeah, that'd be the,
[23:09.130 --> 23:10.650]  that'd probably be the worst of the three.
[23:10.650 --> 23:12.010]  I don't know, but yeah.
[23:12.010 --> 23:13.810]  No man, those avalanches are scary.
[23:13.810 --> 23:16.490]  I've been in it and you're swimming for your life
[23:16.490 --> 23:17.970]  and praying just stops.
[23:17.970 --> 23:21.210]  And I mean, I'm grateful I'm still here and no,
[23:21.210 --> 23:23.250]  you know, nothing too serious, you know,
[23:23.250 --> 23:25.370]  like snowboarding and skateboarding,
[23:25.370 --> 23:26.570]  all those extreme sports,
[23:26.570 --> 23:29.490]  they call extreme sports for a reason.
[23:29.490 --> 23:31.250]  Like it's no joke.
[23:31.250 --> 23:34.610]  I mean, I used to skateboard, not break ankles,
[23:34.610 --> 23:36.690]  you know, like I've shattered stuff, you know,
[23:36.690 --> 23:39.130]  like, you know what's up.
[23:39.130 --> 23:40.090]  And that's the, you know,
[23:40.090 --> 23:43.650]  that's the craziness of where it is today.
[23:43.650 --> 23:46.010]  Like I, dude, I've got skateboarding.
[23:46.010 --> 23:48.970]  So I was more sponsored for skateboarding than snowboarding.
[23:48.970 --> 23:50.610]  Had the clothes, had the hookups.
[23:50.610 --> 23:52.530]  I've got my own boards here,
[23:52.530 --> 23:56.410]  but my best trick would not hold a fricking candle
[23:57.250 --> 23:59.730]  to like a flow person these days, you know?
[24:00.930 --> 24:04.570]  Like, so there's all the time in a place, but.
[24:04.570 --> 24:09.570]  My prime was like a 900 or a Cork 720,
[24:10.370 --> 24:14.290]  stale fish Cork 720, like something like to these days
[24:14.290 --> 24:16.650]  is standard, like super standard.
[24:16.650 --> 24:18.530]  Right, what the fuck?
[24:18.530 --> 24:20.330]  I mean, seriously, like what the,
[24:21.770 --> 24:24.450]  you know, give me a fucking painted red curb
[24:24.450 --> 24:26.770]  and I could have like hours of fun.
[24:26.770 --> 24:29.410]  Yeah, these days it's just like,
[24:29.410 --> 24:31.330]  the progression is skateboarding though.
[24:31.330 --> 24:33.850]  I've actually been really encouraged by, you know,
[24:33.850 --> 24:35.610]  at least the last five, 10 years,
[24:35.610 --> 24:37.290]  people have gotten creative.
[24:37.290 --> 24:40.450]  Like that's one thing I love about showing up to a park.
[24:40.450 --> 24:42.650]  And I'm like, I find the lines and I'm like, okay,
[24:42.650 --> 24:45.370]  how can I abuse the structure here?
[24:45.370 --> 24:46.290]  How can I skate it?
[24:46.290 --> 24:48.810]  How it's not meant to, but works like.
[24:48.810 --> 24:51.050]  Yeah, it's like Rodney Mullen offshoots, you know,
[24:51.050 --> 24:53.610]  like all respect to everybody's creativity,
[24:53.610 --> 24:55.370]  but the Godfather Rodney Mullen,
[24:55.370 --> 24:58.570]  like just like individuality, you know,
[24:58.570 --> 25:02.690]  like unique style, like not low.
[25:02.690 --> 25:05.090]  And then I'm like, yeah, that's an art,
[25:05.090 --> 25:06.410]  you know, it's a real art.
[25:07.330 --> 25:09.410]  It is, it is.
[25:09.410 --> 25:13.410]  And you know, cannabis definitely came through skateboarding
[25:13.410 --> 25:15.650]  for me and it came through snowboarding later.
[25:15.650 --> 25:18.210]  I was skating a lot more before snowboarding
[25:18.210 --> 25:21.050]  because I didn't have access terribly easy.
[25:21.050 --> 25:23.170]  I was about 45 minutes from the mountain.
[25:24.170 --> 25:25.690]  I remember sometimes, you know,
[25:25.690 --> 25:28.130]  my buddies went to like the nice school
[25:28.130 --> 25:29.290]  and they were on the ski bus.
[25:29.290 --> 25:31.850]  And if they couldn't go, we try to pull the switcheroo
[25:31.850 --> 25:34.730]  and I get up there on the ski bus to ride for a day.
[25:34.730 --> 25:36.050]  Oh, yeah.
[25:36.050 --> 25:38.570]  I'm Jesse, I'm Jesse.
[25:38.570 --> 25:40.610]  That's bad ass, see my school didn't have that.
[25:40.610 --> 25:42.210]  We just had to ditch like.
[25:43.850 --> 25:45.530]  He just said, yeah.
[25:45.530 --> 25:46.770]  And then I started knowing, you know,
[25:46.770 --> 25:48.290]  people that would drive up there
[25:48.290 --> 25:50.690]  because I didn't have a car that got up there, but.
[25:50.690 --> 25:52.170]  Yeah, I mean, that's pretty fun days.
[25:52.170 --> 25:55.290]  Like my closest mountain was Boreal
[25:55.290 --> 25:56.770]  and they had night skiing.
[25:56.770 --> 25:59.690]  And it was just a fun party, you know, wow.
[25:59.690 --> 26:02.410]  Yeah, it wasn't until later when I was adult
[26:02.410 --> 26:06.410]  and I had a decent job working for the audio company
[26:06.410 --> 26:08.570]  that I had mentioned earlier.
[26:08.570 --> 26:11.050]  They absolutely did not care.
[26:11.050 --> 26:13.490]  They knew if it was a powder day, I was gonna be gone.
[26:13.490 --> 26:16.170]  They're like, have I done what needs to be done?
[26:16.170 --> 26:18.530]  Yep, dude, see you in a couple of days if you want,
[26:18.530 --> 26:20.490]  just, you know, get the job done.
[26:20.490 --> 26:21.970]  That's where it's at.
[26:21.970 --> 26:23.650]  You're like, fuck it, I'm gonna go shred.
[26:23.650 --> 26:26.410]  Yeah, yeah, and then I had a friend,
[26:26.410 --> 26:28.010]  you know, best man at my wedding.
[26:28.010 --> 26:29.610]  He kind of had the same schedule too.
[26:29.610 --> 26:30.490]  He was an accountant.
[26:30.490 --> 26:34.050]  So as long as his, you know, stuff was on top, cool.
[26:34.050 --> 26:36.090]  We go and take off for a couple of days and just shred.
[26:36.090 --> 26:39.570]  Stevens Pass is where we did most of our writing, but.
[26:39.570 --> 26:42.210]  Yeah, that's, it's a fun spot.
[26:42.210 --> 26:43.970]  Just powder.
[26:43.970 --> 26:45.610]  Yeah, that's where I, yeah.
[26:45.610 --> 26:49.530]  That's where I almost died a few times, but good stuff.
[26:49.530 --> 26:51.290]  Yeah, man, it's fun.
[26:51.290 --> 26:56.130]  Yeah, so when did you decide to kind of grow cannabis
[26:56.130 --> 26:57.130]  or why did you decide?
[26:57.130 --> 26:58.810]  Was it just more or less for your personal
[26:58.810 --> 27:01.210]  or were you like, man, I need a summertime hobby
[27:01.210 --> 27:03.970]  to fuel my travel?
[27:03.970 --> 27:06.930]  I honestly never had to grow cannabis
[27:06.930 --> 27:11.250]  because I was always kind of moving and grooving.
[27:11.250 --> 27:13.410]  Like I was, you know, I was busy, you know,
[27:13.410 --> 27:16.610]  I've gotten plenty of like offers when I was young.
[27:16.610 --> 27:19.250]  They're like, hey man, wanna sit on my spot?
[27:19.930 --> 27:22.170]  And like just post up and see a guard dog.
[27:22.170 --> 27:24.890]  And I'm like, nah, like I'm gonna go party.
[27:24.890 --> 27:29.770]  You know, like I was young, I was in my 20s.
[27:29.770 --> 27:34.450]  I mean, I was 18 every summer from my teens to 20s,
[27:34.450 --> 27:38.770]  like early 20s, I was just kind of music festivals,
[27:38.770 --> 27:42.890]  parties, music shows, like girls, like all just partying,
[27:42.890 --> 27:46.170]  you know, like I was just young and having a good time.
[27:46.170 --> 27:47.490]  As you should.
[27:47.530 --> 27:52.530]  Yeah, it was fun, you know, like, and I loved it.
[27:53.250 --> 27:55.410]  I was learning, you know, like just,
[27:55.410 --> 28:00.410]  and as I was just like, you know, it was cool
[28:01.730 --> 28:04.170]  because all the old timers would work for trade
[28:04.170 --> 28:05.010]  back in the day.
[28:05.010 --> 28:05.850]  I would be like, hey, you know,
[28:05.850 --> 28:07.810]  like you made that fence painted, you know,
[28:07.810 --> 28:10.290]  I'd go dig a bunch of like holes for some old people
[28:10.290 --> 28:11.770]  who were like, yo, I need some holes dig,
[28:11.770 --> 28:15.650]  some fur mix and, you know, dig those holes,
[28:15.650 --> 28:17.050]  paint that fence.
[28:17.570 --> 28:18.410]  Here's a five pack.
[28:18.410 --> 28:21.930]  And I'm like, bet that I will happily help you out,
[28:21.930 --> 28:26.130]  you know, like, so I just never really had the need
[28:26.130 --> 28:28.810]  or drive to, you know, cause it was always high grade
[28:28.810 --> 28:32.930]  and I never complained, but I gotta say like the more,
[28:32.930 --> 28:35.930]  I guess the Cali scene blew up, the less,
[28:35.930 --> 28:38.770]  I mean, quality drops, you know, it's just eventually,
[28:38.770 --> 28:40.890]  I think that's what a lot of people are seeing these days
[28:40.890 --> 28:45.890]  is with saturation of market, the quality may drop,
[28:46.050 --> 28:48.090]  but, you know, so that's kind of what got me
[28:48.090 --> 28:48.930]  to start growing.
[28:48.930 --> 28:51.810]  It was like seeing how it was harder and harder
[28:51.810 --> 28:53.410]  to find just top notch, you know,
[28:53.410 --> 28:56.090]  and how I was just kind of used to it.
[28:56.090 --> 28:59.130]  I was just kind of, that's what I wanted.
[28:59.130 --> 28:59.970]  Excuse me.
[28:59.970 --> 29:02.810]  And that's what made me want to start growing.
[29:02.810 --> 29:06.690]  So my first plant was a clone AK 47.
[29:06.690 --> 29:09.650]  I got from, I forget what dispensary,
[29:09.650 --> 29:11.810]  cause I got my medical, I was working for a guy
[29:11.810 --> 29:14.610]  who was just like, yo, I feel a lot more comfortable
[29:14.610 --> 29:16.850]  if you had your medical card when you're on my property.
[29:16.850 --> 29:19.210]  And I'm like, okay, can you pay for it?
[29:19.210 --> 29:20.890]  And he's like, yeah, I'll pay for it.
[29:20.890 --> 29:22.010]  So it's all it takes.
[29:22.010 --> 29:23.890]  Yeah. So I was like, I, yeah.
[29:23.890 --> 29:28.370]  So got my card, I forget maybe when I was 20, 21,
[29:28.370 --> 29:32.530]  but so I was like, fuck it.
[29:32.530 --> 29:33.730]  I was in Tahoe.
[29:33.730 --> 29:35.770]  It was my first or second year.
[29:35.770 --> 29:37.850]  I think it was the second year I had my own spot
[29:37.850 --> 29:40.010]  with maybe one or two roommates where I was just like,
[29:40.010 --> 29:41.650]  fuck it, I'm gonna grow a plant in my closet.
[29:41.650 --> 29:46.650]  So I got one little T5 light, AK 47 plant,
[29:48.690 --> 29:52.290]  earth juice nutrients, and it was fire.
[29:52.290 --> 29:54.010]  I was like, this is easy.
[29:54.010 --> 29:57.410]  Like, this is easy, like no bugs, nothing.
[29:57.410 --> 30:00.130]  I mean, like how one plant, I mean, one plant,
[30:00.130 --> 30:02.770]  like I literally go snowboard all day,
[30:02.770 --> 30:04.370]  come home, take care of a plant, you know?
[30:04.370 --> 30:07.610]  So I was like, it was a fun little hobby at first,
[30:07.890 --> 30:11.730]  and then one plant turned to one less roommate,
[30:11.730 --> 30:13.650]  me getting the master bedroom,
[30:13.650 --> 30:16.130]  and then growing a lot more plants
[30:16.130 --> 30:18.810]  and tarping off half my master bedroom and sleeping,
[30:18.810 --> 30:19.690]  you know, like that, you know,
[30:19.690 --> 30:21.050]  just kind of growing more and more.
[30:21.050 --> 30:23.170]  Like hobbies become addictive.
[30:23.170 --> 30:25.730]  One train turns into a basement of train sets, you know?
[30:25.730 --> 30:28.930]  So I mean, that's how it started for me at one point.
[30:28.930 --> 30:29.770]  Well said.
[30:29.770 --> 30:34.770]  And then I went to a few 650 watt lighters
[30:35.690 --> 30:40.010]  and my master, I think there was like four lights
[30:40.010 --> 30:41.690]  and just a handful of plants.
[30:41.690 --> 30:44.970]  I was young, I wasn't really utilizing my space well at all,
[30:44.970 --> 30:46.530]  but the herb was good, you know?
[30:46.530 --> 30:50.090]  I had like really good, I had, you know,
[30:50.090 --> 30:51.610]  Tahoe's full of high grade.
[30:51.610 --> 30:53.370]  I don't even know how you guys know.
[30:53.370 --> 30:57.650]  Tahoe, Lake Tahoe, high grade all over, you know?
[30:57.650 --> 31:01.810]  So I mean, I had a really nice bubble gum cut access to,
[31:02.450 --> 31:07.050]  that AK-47 access to, I had a purple Cadillac.
[31:07.050 --> 31:10.010]  I don't know even what that was, but it was amazing.
[31:10.010 --> 31:11.970]  Really sleepy Indica vibe.
[31:13.090 --> 31:15.770]  Yeah, I just get random cuts from the dispensary.
[31:15.770 --> 31:16.770]  You know, I didn't really care.
[31:16.770 --> 31:17.610]  I didn't know.
[31:17.610 --> 31:20.530]  I just was like, I'll grow it out and smoke it.
[31:20.530 --> 31:21.370]  Like I'm just learning, you know?
[31:21.370 --> 31:22.970]  It was all like a learning lesson.
[31:22.970 --> 31:23.890]  Like you can't go to,
[31:23.890 --> 31:25.970]  you couldn't go to college for that shit back in the day.
[31:25.970 --> 31:28.250]  You can now, give thanks for where the movement,
[31:28.250 --> 31:29.970]  but you know, like, so yeah.
[31:29.970 --> 31:30.810]  What about you?
[31:30.810 --> 31:31.850]  When did you start growing herb?
[31:31.850 --> 31:33.010]  Yep.
[31:33.010 --> 31:35.530]  You know, I usually tie that to when it went,
[31:35.530 --> 31:39.010]  or when I got a medical card here in Washington.
[31:39.930 --> 31:44.930]  That was 2011 and had access to cuts, which was nice.
[31:46.370 --> 31:49.290]  You know, I kind of had collected some bag seeds in,
[31:49.290 --> 31:51.810]  in between, but yeah,
[31:51.810 --> 31:55.050]  that's how I kind of got my start with that on a,
[31:55.050 --> 31:56.050]  on a larger scale.
[31:56.050 --> 31:58.350]  It was definitely the HPS days.
[31:59.310 --> 32:01.590]  Is that what you were kind of using as well?
[32:01.590 --> 32:06.590]  Yeah, I mean, all those girls that dated me back in the day,
[32:07.470 --> 32:09.750]  who came and slept over with that ballast going on,
[32:09.750 --> 32:10.670]  God bless you.
[32:10.670 --> 32:13.030]  Like, gosh, yeah.
[32:13.030 --> 32:14.990]  That was embarrassing, you know, like, Hey, you know,
[32:14.990 --> 32:17.710]  I'm just young and dumb trying to have fun, but like,
[32:17.710 --> 32:19.910]  yeah, I got a little medical situation going, you know,
[32:19.910 --> 32:22.350]  I was young and dumb, you know, I was like.
[32:22.350 --> 32:25.350]  But that's, you know, at that age for, you know,
[32:25.350 --> 32:27.310]  the kind of girls that I was meeting is they liked
[32:27.310 --> 32:28.510]  the bad boys.
[32:28.510 --> 32:31.270]  I didn't really ever consider myself that I was just doing
[32:31.270 --> 32:34.070]  my thing, being a skater and being into music and doing,
[32:34.070 --> 32:38.030]  you know, adrenaline junkie, as you said, but you know.
[32:38.030 --> 32:39.830]  I mean, I remember in high school,
[32:39.830 --> 32:44.710]  I dated a girl and her mom was like, look,
[32:44.710 --> 32:47.070]  I know you sell weed, but you're good to my dog.
[32:47.070 --> 32:48.710]  I'm like, what?
[32:48.710 --> 32:50.550]  Wow. Just came out with it.
[32:50.550 --> 32:52.750]  Takes one to know one lady, takes one to know one.
[32:52.750 --> 32:56.150]  I was like second or third time meeting her and I'm in high
[32:56.190 --> 33:00.190]  school and I'm like, shit, like maybe I need to keep this
[33:00.190 --> 33:01.150]  shit under wraps.
[33:01.150 --> 33:02.590]  Like that's crazy.
[33:02.590 --> 33:03.430]  Like, I don't know.
[33:03.430 --> 33:06.150]  And like, she was like, I didn't tell her like, so yeah,
[33:06.150 --> 33:09.710]  word gets around, you know, like, you know, it's.
[33:09.710 --> 33:10.550]  Yeah.
[33:10.550 --> 33:14.750]  Be smart if you're young, be mind your P's and Q's,
[33:14.750 --> 33:18.470]  don't do anything dumb, but like be smart out there kids.
[33:18.470 --> 33:19.630]  Parents know what's up.
[33:20.710 --> 33:21.550]  Yeah, for real.
[33:21.550 --> 33:23.550]  And like I said, it takes one to know one, that lady,
[33:23.550 --> 33:25.150]  she, she probably smoked.
[33:25.230 --> 33:27.990]  She probably had some of that high grade from you too.
[33:27.990 --> 33:29.430]  I just, yeah, I probably just said,
[33:29.430 --> 33:30.950]  that's probably why I got grounded all the time.
[33:30.950 --> 33:34.430]  I come in and just, even though vising was a thing,
[33:34.430 --> 33:36.590]  I mean, you can't, I have a,
[33:36.590 --> 33:38.710]  I, when I got out of my eyes, I get like closed.
[33:38.710 --> 33:40.950]  I don't care if they're red or not.
[33:40.950 --> 33:44.350]  You just, I can see, but people are like, are you sleeping?
[33:44.350 --> 33:48.990]  I'm like, no, I'm just high.
[33:48.990 --> 33:50.470]  It looks good to me.
[33:50.470 --> 33:53.070]  Yeah. There was, there's a period me and my buddy, Eric,
[33:53.070 --> 33:56.750]  he was, we, you know, we were both younger
[33:56.750 --> 33:58.230]  than we should be out on our own.
[33:58.230 --> 34:01.870]  And he had like, you know, all the, like heart space,
[34:01.870 --> 34:04.270]  diamonds clubs, and the spider webs over here
[34:04.270 --> 34:05.110]  on his knuckles.
[34:05.110 --> 34:06.470]  And we'd be going to job interviews
[34:06.470 --> 34:08.230]  because we needed to try to get money.
[34:08.230 --> 34:10.670]  You put like cover up on them.
[34:10.670 --> 34:12.430]  And so, you know, they, whatever,
[34:12.430 --> 34:14.030]  we thought they looked covered up.
[34:14.030 --> 34:15.350]  But every interview we had,
[34:15.350 --> 34:17.030]  we were doing telemarketing at this time
[34:17.030 --> 34:17.870]  because you could pretty much
[34:17.870 --> 34:19.790]  always get a telemarketing job.
[34:19.790 --> 34:21.510]  But every interview we would go into,
[34:21.510 --> 34:23.150]  the person interviewing us would make
[34:23.150 --> 34:25.870]  some kind of weed reference or some weed joke.
[34:25.870 --> 34:29.190]  And it took us a long time before we figured out
[34:29.190 --> 34:30.990]  we probably shouldn't smoke out in the car
[34:30.990 --> 34:32.350]  before our interviews.
[34:35.030 --> 34:36.590]  We just thought they were cool.
[34:38.830 --> 34:41.550]  Hey, that's the journey, right?
[34:41.550 --> 34:42.390]  Yes. Yeah.
[34:42.390 --> 34:44.750]  Yeah. You think you're being slick sometimes
[34:44.750 --> 34:46.430]  when you're young, but you're not.
[34:46.430 --> 34:47.910]  Cause we know the trick.
[34:47.910 --> 34:49.470]  One of the neighbor kids at the park,
[34:49.470 --> 34:50.790]  they had something, you know,
[34:51.070 --> 34:52.230]  it looked like a little vape pen in the hand,
[34:52.230 --> 34:54.550]  but you know that like where you walk around the corner
[34:54.550 --> 34:56.750]  and then you see somebody and you try to like palm it
[34:56.750 --> 34:59.350]  and then put it in your pocket real slick.
[34:59.350 --> 35:00.430]  Totally saw him do that.
[35:00.430 --> 35:01.270]  And I called him out.
[35:01.270 --> 35:02.870]  I'm like, I don't know what that was,
[35:02.870 --> 35:05.070]  but that wasn't the best move I've seen.
[35:09.950 --> 35:13.310]  That reminds me, like, you know,
[35:13.310 --> 35:14.270]  I just spaced on it.
[35:14.270 --> 35:15.390]  Nevermind. I'm ripped.
[35:15.390 --> 35:16.230]  My bad.
[35:17.590 --> 35:18.510]  I do that too.
[35:18.750 --> 35:20.790]  I'm good for at least a few of those.
[35:20.790 --> 35:22.870]  It's been actually not,
[35:22.870 --> 35:25.350]  it has been a lot of episodes since I started talking
[35:25.350 --> 35:26.350]  when I've been on mute.
[35:26.350 --> 35:28.710]  So hopefully that won't happen too.
[35:28.710 --> 35:31.870]  Yeah. I used to have a tendency to do that, but no.
[35:31.870 --> 35:34.310]  I just, yeah, I've just been puffing on some herbs.
[35:34.310 --> 35:35.470]  So I'm really high.
[35:37.190 --> 35:39.230]  I was listening to you and I forgot what I was going to say.
[35:39.230 --> 35:40.510]  So I apologize.
[35:41.350 --> 35:42.590]  I do that, dude.
[35:42.590 --> 35:43.510]  I get excited.
[35:43.510 --> 35:44.750]  I'm like, oh, oh shit.
[35:44.750 --> 35:46.110]  What was I going to say?
[35:46.110 --> 35:47.950]  But I know we were talking about weed
[35:48.390 --> 35:49.230]  and we're talking about the AK.
[35:49.230 --> 35:51.590]  Well, AK-47 was one of the first ones
[35:51.590 --> 35:52.790]  that you grew as a clone.
[35:52.790 --> 35:55.550]  That was one of the first names that I remember.
[35:55.550 --> 35:57.030]  I was like an AK-47.
[35:57.030 --> 35:58.670]  It was a Northern Lights.
[35:58.670 --> 36:01.270]  Like, you know, I would joke,
[36:01.270 --> 36:05.110]  it was always either called Gossam or Don't Gossam before.
[36:05.110 --> 36:08.110]  And growing up in the Pacific Northwest, it was nice.
[36:08.110 --> 36:09.390]  I never had to smoke brick weed.
[36:09.390 --> 36:11.150]  Somebody always had really good stuff.
[36:11.150 --> 36:14.310]  But when, you know,
[36:14.310 --> 36:16.510]  when was it that you really started paying attention
[36:16.510 --> 36:17.350]  to names?
[36:17.790 --> 36:19.470]  Was it when you were picking up clones
[36:19.470 --> 36:21.830]  or was there just like a market demand?
[36:21.830 --> 36:25.830]  Like I've got to find, you know, the new Nakatomi Plaza.
[36:25.830 --> 36:27.990]  You know, when you're moving things around,
[36:27.990 --> 36:30.310]  like before you start growing, you know,
[36:32.190 --> 36:33.590]  I always went for quality.
[36:33.590 --> 36:36.550]  Like what, for me, quality was like no's.
[36:36.550 --> 36:37.670]  And, you know, back in the day,
[36:37.670 --> 36:40.190]  you could go open turkey bags, pop them open,
[36:40.190 --> 36:42.030]  crumble up a joint, you know, like, yo,
[36:42.030 --> 36:43.670]  I'm gonna try this one, I'm gonna try that one.
[36:43.670 --> 36:46.350]  And I just always went off of what I liked.
[36:47.310 --> 36:49.350]  And I just felt like I had a good taste.
[36:49.350 --> 36:53.070]  So quality was smell, taste,
[36:53.070 --> 36:55.270]  and the bag appearance for me was always last.
[36:55.270 --> 36:57.670]  And so, and you know,
[36:57.670 --> 37:01.670]  names were how we were just differentiating stuff.
[37:01.670 --> 37:04.710]  And like, it wasn't until like,
[37:04.710 --> 37:06.630]  I was actually moving a little bit bigger
[37:06.630 --> 37:09.270]  than a few, you know, sacks here and there
[37:09.270 --> 37:10.270]  as a high school kid.
[37:10.270 --> 37:12.070]  But like, and that's when like names, you know,
[37:12.070 --> 37:17.070]  I was like, granddaddy purple, and you know, green crack,
[37:17.670 --> 37:21.110]  and a pink champagne was big.
[37:21.110 --> 37:23.190]  And then I was like, getting out of high school,
[37:23.190 --> 37:28.190]  like Cinderella 99, like there's this stuff called Cali O.
[37:28.710 --> 37:31.670]  And it was just, you know, I mean like,
[37:31.670 --> 37:32.510]  orange peel.
[37:32.510 --> 37:34.390]  You put orange peel in there, it sounds like,
[37:34.390 --> 37:35.230]  no, I didn't.
[37:35.230 --> 37:39.110]  I used to think that, you know, but like,
[37:39.110 --> 37:40.310]  you know, skunk, you know,
[37:40.310 --> 37:41.870]  and I didn't know what like,
[37:41.870 --> 37:43.590]  it wasn't roadkill, it wasn't anything,
[37:43.590 --> 37:45.230]  just people like, I had, you know,
[37:45.230 --> 37:47.870]  I did stuff from all different types of people,
[37:47.870 --> 37:49.150]  you know, it was just,
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.990]  names are just how you differentiate it.
[37:50.990 --> 37:55.990]  And so like, I definitely put like, note, my nose to names.
[37:55.990 --> 37:58.950]  And there was definitely like, different perps, you know,
[37:58.950 --> 38:01.110]  if it wasn't that granddaddy, very like,
[38:01.110 --> 38:03.550]  what we now know as like, little, or like,
[38:03.550 --> 38:06.590]  like a grapey kind of hint.
[38:07.470 --> 38:09.070]  But like back in the day, that was just perps.
[38:09.070 --> 38:12.310]  Like, that was like, so if it wasn't granddaddy,
[38:12.310 --> 38:13.750]  but it smelled like perps,
[38:13.750 --> 38:15.670]  and it just wasn't like, purple or black,
[38:15.670 --> 38:17.670]  it was just kind of green with some dark hues,
[38:17.670 --> 38:18.590]  you know, it was just perps.
[38:18.590 --> 38:20.150]  It wasn't granddaddy, or it was Urkel.
[38:20.150 --> 38:22.270]  Like, I mean, Urkel back in the day for me,
[38:22.270 --> 38:24.230]  I felt was a little more skunky,
[38:24.230 --> 38:26.150]  than granddaddy was more like,
[38:26.150 --> 38:27.030]  sweeter.
[38:27.030 --> 38:28.990]  Yeah, like, definitely sweeter.
[38:28.990 --> 38:30.830]  Like that sweet lavender.
[38:30.830 --> 38:35.390]  Urkel was like, more sweet skunk, like gas skunk sweet.
[38:35.390 --> 38:37.470]  I don't know, you know, but,
[38:37.470 --> 38:38.710]  yeah, that's what I remember,
[38:38.710 --> 38:40.990]  because I was just kind of what was popular, OG Kush,
[38:40.990 --> 38:41.830]  you know.
[38:41.830 --> 38:42.670]  Yeah.
[38:42.670 --> 38:44.710]  All those, like, OG was one of the hardest things
[38:44.710 --> 38:46.990]  to get always, like, always super hard,
[38:46.990 --> 38:48.510]  super high ticket, like,
[38:49.470 --> 38:51.470]  but when you got it, it was gold, you know?
[38:51.470 --> 38:53.350]  And that's like, when I was talking about Chemdog
[38:53.350 --> 38:55.470]  back in the day, that was definitely one,
[38:55.470 --> 38:58.350]  that stood out to me, on tour,
[38:58.350 --> 39:00.550]  where I was like, what'd you do to that?
[39:00.550 --> 39:01.790]  Like.
[39:01.790 --> 39:05.430]  We, yeah, we had a lot of that up in this area,
[39:05.430 --> 39:06.270]  and I love it.
[39:06.270 --> 39:10.430]  91 Chem is something that I'm still searching for,
[39:10.430 --> 39:12.950]  through a lot of people's 91 Chems,
[39:12.950 --> 39:13.950]  I'm still searching for it.
[39:13.950 --> 39:16.590]  And I've got, I have this much left,
[39:16.590 --> 39:19.030]  this much left, and this is a wreck buy.
[39:19.030 --> 39:22.390]  There is one company that grows the best Chem 91
[39:22.390 --> 39:25.190]  I've had since, like, that era.
[39:25.190 --> 39:26.790]  And it's weird, it's the one.
[39:28.070 --> 39:29.950]  They went out of business, dude.
[39:29.950 --> 39:33.710]  It was Elevate, it was Elevate, E-love-8.
[39:33.710 --> 39:35.230]  They went out of freaking business.
[39:35.230 --> 39:36.910]  This is the last that I have.
[39:36.910 --> 39:38.390]  I'm not happy about it.
[39:38.390 --> 39:40.910]  The industry's tough right now, man, sorry.
[39:40.910 --> 39:44.390]  Yeah, yeah, I didn't know, I looked into it.
[39:44.390 --> 39:47.510]  Like, I didn't know anybody who were the growers,
[39:47.510 --> 39:50.430]  or the owners of it, because I want a cut of that.
[39:50.430 --> 39:53.870]  That is exactly what I'm looking for, dude.
[39:53.870 --> 39:58.830]  Yeah, so I saw it my first time at Northwest Stream Summit,
[39:58.830 --> 40:00.230]  at Hornings Hideout.
[40:00.230 --> 40:01.710]  Yes, exactly.
[40:01.710 --> 40:04.310]  I don't know who it was, I just remember my buddy
[40:04.310 --> 40:07.310]  hollering, he's like, yo, come check this out.
[40:07.310 --> 40:11.310]  And boy, I had a backpack of some of the loudest smelling
[40:11.310 --> 40:13.670]  herb I had ever, ever smelled.
[40:13.670 --> 40:15.110]  And I was like, yo, can I pack a bowl of that?
[40:15.110 --> 40:15.950]  Just to make sure.
[40:15.950 --> 40:18.390]  Like, yeah, if you buy some.
[40:18.390 --> 40:21.150]  And I was just like, yeah, for sure, I will buy you out.
[40:21.150 --> 40:22.990]  Like, that's some of the best.
[40:22.990 --> 40:25.470]  But it was like, he was doing 400 a ticket back,
[40:25.470 --> 40:28.550]  and I was like, damn, that's 400 an ounce?
[40:28.550 --> 40:31.550]  Yeah, okay, I'll buy three or four of them, sounds good.
[40:31.550 --> 40:34.190]  Like, that's my head stash for the rest of the summer.
[40:35.070 --> 40:37.150]  A head thumper, you know, like that was my,
[40:37.150 --> 40:41.870]  like, I don't know, maybe, I wanna say 06, maybe?
[40:41.870 --> 40:42.710]  Okay.
[40:42.710 --> 40:45.830]  07, something around there.
[40:45.830 --> 40:47.510]  Yeah, what was I doing?
[40:47.510 --> 40:48.950]  And then that was the first time I was like,
[40:48.950 --> 40:51.190]  that's one of the strongest herbs I've ever had.
[40:51.190 --> 40:55.630]  And I personally found chemdog before I saw sour diesel.
[40:56.470 --> 41:00.470]  But I definitely have seen a lot of sour diesel grow
[41:00.470 --> 41:01.510]  compared to chemdog.
[41:01.710 --> 41:05.270]  I mean, I've seen like chemsis, chem4, chemd.
[41:06.190 --> 41:07.630]  I've never seen that 91.
[41:07.630 --> 41:09.470]  Personally, I've never seen the 91.
[41:09.470 --> 41:12.510]  I've smoked it, but I've never seen it grow.
[41:12.510 --> 41:14.790]  Like, yeah, but that's definitely, she's special.
[41:14.790 --> 41:17.030]  Shout out to all those people.
[41:17.030 --> 41:18.910]  That's definitely one of my faves.
[41:18.910 --> 41:20.750]  I'm sure a lot of people can relate.
[41:20.750 --> 41:22.670]  Yeah, and then this was the 90s
[41:22.670 --> 41:24.310]  that I was smoking on this stuff.
[41:24.310 --> 41:28.950]  And the sour diesel, like, it did come a little bit later.
[41:29.510 --> 41:31.710]  I know I've smoked it,
[41:31.710 --> 41:34.750]  but probably not when it had a name to it.
[41:34.750 --> 41:37.990]  Like, there was a lot of counterfeit that came out
[41:37.990 --> 41:40.110]  just to kind of sell a bag.
[41:40.110 --> 41:43.870]  But yeah, the 90s, man, like that chem was awesome.
[41:43.870 --> 41:45.790]  And days from the garden in there,
[41:45.790 --> 41:49.710]  he's saying that the 91 is a bitch to grow.
[41:49.710 --> 41:52.070]  Just cut her down, because it wasn't cutting it.
[41:52.070 --> 41:53.470]  And I've kind of heard that,
[41:53.470 --> 41:56.190]  but I've got a bunch of seeds to go through.
[41:56.190 --> 41:58.830]  And you said, you know, like chemd, chem4,
[41:59.710 --> 42:00.670]  I'm looking in those too, man.
[42:00.670 --> 42:02.070]  I'm convinced it's the 91,
[42:02.070 --> 42:03.630]  because again, this is 91 chem
[42:03.630 --> 42:05.550]  that from this company was just fucking,
[42:05.550 --> 42:07.270]  I'm like, that's it?
[42:07.270 --> 42:09.830]  That's what I'm searching for.
[42:09.830 --> 42:12.550]  And you mentioned skunk too, you know,
[42:12.550 --> 42:15.030]  the elusive roadkill skunk,
[42:15.030 --> 42:16.990]  that was in the 90s when I was smoking it.
[42:16.990 --> 42:19.110]  But the last time I smelled it
[42:19.110 --> 42:21.790]  was in the parking lot of a snowboarding.
[42:21.790 --> 42:23.270]  Yeah, of a mountain.
[42:23.270 --> 42:26.710]  Like so many genetics have moved
[42:27.390 --> 42:29.870]  through the winter rain.
[42:29.870 --> 42:31.470]  It had nothing to do, like, I mean,
[42:31.470 --> 42:32.550]  especially if you're growing,
[42:32.550 --> 42:33.870]  you're not going out and partying.
[42:33.870 --> 42:36.190]  Like I didn't start growing
[42:36.190 --> 42:38.150]  until I was pretty much done partying.
[42:38.150 --> 42:41.310]  I mean, great hobby, you know what I mean?
[42:41.310 --> 42:43.710]  Being snowboard all day, check on your plants,
[42:43.710 --> 42:47.430]  you know, you're good, go to sleep, life's good.
[42:47.430 --> 42:48.350]  Yeah, you're on the road
[42:48.350 --> 42:50.550]  and it's a place to meet up with people.
[42:50.550 --> 42:53.950]  But did you ever, you know, kind of like trade genetics
[42:53.950 --> 42:55.870]  or meet people from just like different areas
[42:55.870 --> 42:58.510]  of the country through your riding
[42:58.510 --> 43:00.470]  and, you know, kind of build
[43:00.470 --> 43:02.550]  separate relationships that way?
[43:02.550 --> 43:05.110]  I mean, you know, I stuck pretty close
[43:05.110 --> 43:07.670]  just because, you know, I was,
[43:07.670 --> 43:09.990]  I kind of felt like a big fish in a small pond for a while.
[43:09.990 --> 43:11.070]  I mean, Tahoe's pretty small
[43:11.070 --> 43:12.550]  and I'm not saying I'm a big boy at all.
[43:12.550 --> 43:16.550]  I was just like, I mean, I had, you know,
[43:16.550 --> 43:17.910]  there was some medical days
[43:17.910 --> 43:21.270]  and there was no dispensaries in the North Lake.
[43:21.270 --> 43:22.870]  I was a North Lake person, you know,
[43:22.870 --> 43:25.590]  there was one in Southern, South Lake Tahoe
[43:26.430 --> 43:31.430]  and so, I mean, I had edibles, I had like hash, you know,
[43:32.350 --> 43:35.430]  I had things you would get at a dispensary
[43:35.430 --> 43:36.470]  and there was no dispensary.
[43:36.470 --> 43:37.750]  So, you know, I was just,
[43:39.630 --> 43:42.030]  you have Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows,
[43:42.030 --> 43:44.510]  like all these other different, you know,
[43:44.510 --> 43:46.390]  people who are all in to having a good time
[43:46.390 --> 43:48.870]  and you have the product, it just kind of-
[43:48.870 --> 43:49.830]  Tourists too.
[43:49.830 --> 43:51.750]  Yeah, so I mean, yeah, tourists are awesome.
[43:51.750 --> 43:54.150]  Like respect to the tourists who got the hot pockets,
[43:54.150 --> 43:54.990]  like for real.
[43:55.190 --> 43:56.030]  Yep.
[43:57.190 --> 43:58.630]  But, you know, and even like, you know,
[43:58.630 --> 44:02.230]  cause Tahoe, they have like work exchange programs,
[44:02.230 --> 44:04.270]  like respect to all those people coming up
[44:04.270 --> 44:07.390]  from out of country, South America, Australia,
[44:07.390 --> 44:11.470]  New Zealand, South Africa, like all over the world, Spain.
[44:11.470 --> 44:12.470]  It's beautiful, you know?
[44:12.470 --> 44:16.430]  So, I mean, I got to meet a lot of cultured people.
[44:16.430 --> 44:17.350]  I was very grateful.
[44:17.350 --> 44:19.430]  I just didn't, I mean, I didn't have to go anywhere.
[44:19.430 --> 44:21.510]  Tahoe is a vortex, you know,
[44:21.510 --> 44:24.710]  Tahoe is a vortex of high vibration, you know,
[44:25.430 --> 44:27.790]  a lot of stints, you know, a lot of vibration, you know,
[44:27.790 --> 44:29.750]  people from all over the world meeting each other.
[44:29.750 --> 44:30.750]  And it was beautiful.
[44:30.750 --> 44:33.630]  Like, you know, it was really, it was really cool.
[44:33.630 --> 44:35.350]  I'm sure it's still that same way, you know,
[44:35.350 --> 44:38.150]  like I had to tap out after one of my last concussions.
[44:38.150 --> 44:40.470]  It was just kind of a heavy one, you know?
[44:40.470 --> 44:42.030]  So I just had to step away,
[44:42.030 --> 44:44.190]  but Tahoe is a very special place.
[44:44.190 --> 44:45.550]  What up to the Tahoe crew?
[44:45.550 --> 44:46.550]  One love in the house.
[44:46.550 --> 44:49.270]  Hope you shredding, like this season looks dope.
[44:49.270 --> 44:52.190]  Like have a great time, be safe.
[44:52.190 --> 44:53.910]  But yeah, Tahoe is special.
[44:53.950 --> 44:54.870]  I mean, I think, you know,
[44:54.870 --> 44:58.030]  what Squaw Valley is Palisades, Tahoe now,
[44:58.030 --> 44:59.190]  something like that.
[44:59.190 --> 45:01.270]  You know, things change when, you know,
[45:01.270 --> 45:04.470]  they get bought out by corporations and it was special.
[45:04.470 --> 45:07.190]  I mean, Squaw's still special, but there's, you know,
[45:07.190 --> 45:08.030]  it was special.
[45:08.030 --> 45:10.870]  Like the hostel, you know,
[45:10.870 --> 45:14.190]  the hostel employee housing hostel, you know,
[45:14.190 --> 45:17.750]  people from all over the world, like, man, it was like,
[45:17.750 --> 45:18.630]  it was a party.
[45:18.630 --> 45:20.750]  Like you said, I'm sure you know, like.
[45:21.550 --> 45:23.630]  And there is, there's nothing else to do.
[45:23.630 --> 45:27.350]  So you do kind of have to like be around people
[45:27.350 --> 45:28.270]  and get along.
[45:28.270 --> 45:30.030]  That's so rad that they had, you know,
[45:30.030 --> 45:32.270]  like that world exposure because dude,
[45:32.270 --> 45:35.070]  that's so priceless to learn from like other people's
[45:35.070 --> 45:36.550]  cultures and other people's ways.
[45:36.550 --> 45:38.190]  And to get to like share in that,
[45:38.190 --> 45:42.390]  you've learned a lot of cool little things that who knew.
[45:42.590 --> 45:45.270]  Yo entiendo muy poquito espanol.
[45:47.710 --> 45:51.670]  I just went to Mexico and I did not pick that much up.
[45:52.830 --> 45:53.950]  It's a beautiful language.
[45:53.950 --> 45:55.430]  It's a beautiful language.
[45:55.430 --> 45:58.590]  Australians party harder than anybody I've ever met
[45:58.590 --> 45:59.430]  in my life.
[45:59.430 --> 46:02.230]  They are a wild bunch, respect to all you guys.
[46:02.230 --> 46:04.030]  I love the whole culture.
[46:04.030 --> 46:05.510]  You know, people from all over the world,
[46:05.510 --> 46:06.430]  they're just beautiful.
[46:06.430 --> 46:08.950]  Like we're all just one blood, you know,
[46:08.950 --> 46:11.830]  like we're all the same race, one race, human race,
[46:12.270 --> 46:13.950]  one race, that's all we are.
[46:13.950 --> 46:15.590]  We're all trying to have a good time.
[46:15.590 --> 46:17.910]  You know, we're all here to shred, send it,
[46:17.910 --> 46:20.350]  you know, whether you're shredding the garden
[46:20.350 --> 46:23.070]  or you're shredding the oceans
[46:23.070 --> 46:24.630]  or you're shredding the parks, you know,
[46:24.630 --> 46:26.750]  like skate parks, like we're all just trying
[46:26.750 --> 46:27.710]  to have a good time, you know,
[46:27.710 --> 46:29.550]  like trying to find your happiness, you know,
[46:29.550 --> 46:32.030]  however it is, as long as you're not hurting anybody,
[46:32.030 --> 46:33.870]  hopefully you're not hurting yourself too much,
[46:33.870 --> 46:36.270]  you know, like, right.
[46:36.270 --> 46:37.830]  And you know, there's,
[46:39.710 --> 46:41.590]  and I'm sure you've felt this too,
[46:42.350 --> 46:43.950]  but you know, there's a time when you just kind of like bend
[46:43.950 --> 46:45.110]  and you bounce back up.
[46:45.110 --> 46:47.750]  And then there's a time in life where you just start breaking
[46:47.750 --> 46:50.350]  and not getting back up so quickly.
[46:50.350 --> 46:52.590]  And the brain wants to fucking jump it,
[46:52.590 --> 46:54.550]  but the body is like, no.
[46:54.550 --> 46:57.910]  And there is a point where the body can overtake the brain
[46:57.910 --> 46:58.950]  in decision-making.
[46:58.950 --> 47:00.550]  I think I've reached that point,
[47:00.550 --> 47:04.990]  but I still love to look at things and just be like,
[47:04.990 --> 47:07.150]  you could do it, you can make it.
[47:07.150 --> 47:09.750]  That's like all my Instagram feed is,
[47:09.790 --> 47:11.390]  is snowboarding and weed.
[47:11.390 --> 47:13.070]  Like that's-
[47:13.070 --> 47:13.910]  Beautiful.
[47:13.910 --> 47:14.870]  Daydreaming.
[47:16.270 --> 47:17.470]  Beautiful.
[47:17.470 --> 47:21.430]  We had a question here from Daisy.
[47:21.430 --> 47:25.350]  I was just mentioning him with the chem 91.
[47:26.870 --> 47:29.470]  Can you ask him about Tahoe OG?
[47:29.470 --> 47:31.630]  I never got to, I've never grown it.
[47:31.630 --> 47:33.470]  I've smoked and moved.
[47:33.470 --> 47:36.230]  I smoked it and I've had it around, you know,
[47:36.230 --> 47:37.190]  I've definitely had it around.
[47:37.190 --> 47:38.310]  It's around Tahoe.
[47:39.310 --> 47:42.350]  But tight and at the time that I had it,
[47:42.350 --> 47:43.710]  it was definitely a high ticket,
[47:43.710 --> 47:46.990]  but it moved around Tahoe and it was top notch,
[47:46.990 --> 47:50.790]  you know, more of a piney OG, but potent, you know,
[47:50.790 --> 47:51.790]  great OG.
[47:51.790 --> 47:53.390]  And, you know, like I said, OGs were rare.
[47:53.390 --> 47:56.990]  So anytime you could get like a Tahoe OG or LA OG
[47:56.990 --> 47:59.350]  or any OG that actually had that nose
[47:59.350 --> 48:01.790]  and that like, that punch, you know?
[48:01.790 --> 48:03.950]  So, I mean, like I said, back in the day,
[48:03.950 --> 48:07.630]  before you buy, you know, a nice amount,
[48:07.710 --> 48:09.230]  you could at least sample it, you know?
[48:09.230 --> 48:12.070]  You could, I used to be like, that's not OG.
[48:12.070 --> 48:13.110]  I'm not buying that.
[48:14.390 --> 48:15.350]  Sorry.
[48:15.350 --> 48:16.390]  Yeah.
[48:16.390 --> 48:17.350]  You're like, no, it's OG.
[48:17.350 --> 48:19.750]  I was like, no, it's not, you know?
[48:19.750 --> 48:20.910]  Yeah.
[48:20.910 --> 48:23.870]  Yeah, there's a few, there's a few,
[48:23.870 --> 48:26.670]  a few strains like that where it's just like, yeah, no,
[48:26.670 --> 48:29.590]  I'm gonna confidently just gonna say absolutely not.
[48:29.590 --> 48:30.590]  That's one of them.
[48:31.470 --> 48:35.150]  You had mentioned some OGs earlier.
[48:35.150 --> 48:39.030]  Well, I mean, older growers, not the strain.
[48:39.030 --> 48:42.070]  Earlier showing you kind of like some organic methods
[48:42.070 --> 48:44.310]  and they lived out, you know, out in the cut,
[48:44.310 --> 48:48.070]  doing their vegetables, doing everything to self-sustain.
[48:48.070 --> 48:50.150]  And then you also mentioned too, when you started out,
[48:50.150 --> 48:52.230]  you know, just like slamming it with bottles.
[48:52.230 --> 48:54.990]  Where, what are you doing now?
[48:54.990 --> 48:57.510]  Or where is, was there kind of a transition?
[48:58.710 --> 49:00.790]  Well, I mean, like I started going and like,
[49:00.790 --> 49:04.150]  even though bottles, like, I'll be like real bottles
[49:04.150 --> 49:06.910]  is a really sensitive subject because I like to put out
[49:06.910 --> 49:09.750]  on shit and I'm like, well, even if you're KNF,
[49:09.750 --> 49:12.070]  like what do you put your liquid into?
[49:14.310 --> 49:16.750]  Thank you, because people still call it a mixed tape
[49:16.750 --> 49:20.110]  and I'm perplexed by that as somebody who made that forever.
[49:20.110 --> 49:22.390]  And be like, oh, like, oh, he's a custody
[49:22.390 --> 49:25.190]  or like a dude runs bottles or like, like, cool.
[49:25.190 --> 49:27.110]  You got a big ego, that shows like,
[49:27.110 --> 49:28.670]  you should probably smoke some more of your weed.
[49:28.670 --> 49:32.590]  Like, I mean, I, bottles, yeah, I started with bottles.
[49:32.590 --> 49:34.230]  I definitely, I didn't know what I was doing.
[49:34.230 --> 49:36.430]  You know, the grow Bible is what I started,
[49:36.430 --> 49:38.390]  you know, shout out for, hey, you know, I mean,
[49:38.390 --> 49:40.950]  like I'm definitely, that's not what I do anymore,
[49:40.950 --> 49:42.750]  but that's definitely what I started on.
[49:42.750 --> 49:43.750]  Sitting right there.
[49:44.830 --> 49:47.110]  I mean, we have, we have our elders and our teachers
[49:47.110 --> 49:50.550]  and we can rely on, you know, like, you know, hopefully,
[49:50.550 --> 49:53.870]  you know, like us, the youth can rise up, right?
[49:53.870 --> 49:56.110]  So like, not on like any like anarchist way,
[49:56.110 --> 49:58.950]  but like, that's like what an elder wants to do
[49:58.950 --> 49:59.990]  is rise the youth up.
[49:59.990 --> 50:01.950]  Like you won't want to surpass, you know, I mean,
[50:02.510 --> 50:03.750]  in my opinion, so it's like,
[50:04.710 --> 50:06.550]  I've had a lot of elders help me out, you know,
[50:06.550 --> 50:08.990]  like a lot of people who taught me the way we're old
[50:08.990 --> 50:10.950]  and OG and they were growing organic.
[50:10.950 --> 50:13.670]  I mean, like, and I going back to bottles,
[50:13.670 --> 50:16.230]  like myself, like I had buddies who were reps
[50:16.230 --> 50:18.790]  of Roots Organic who were just giving me,
[50:18.790 --> 50:19.630]  they're like here.
[50:19.630 --> 50:20.870]  I'd use their stuff, yeah.
[50:20.870 --> 50:22.230]  Yeah, they're like, hey, you want to,
[50:22.230 --> 50:24.150]  you want like two, four or five runs here?
[50:24.150 --> 50:24.990]  Boom, like.
[50:24.990 --> 50:25.910]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[50:25.910 --> 50:27.830]  You know, it was just, they were friends.
[50:27.830 --> 50:30.350]  They were, you know, that's what friends do.
[50:30.350 --> 50:33.670]  So, I mean, I started with Roots Organic bottles
[50:33.670 --> 50:37.150]  after like doing Earth Juice for a while,
[50:37.150 --> 50:39.630]  but just like soil, Earth Juice.
[50:39.630 --> 50:41.470]  And then I did the Roots Organics.
[50:41.470 --> 50:43.950]  And then like, he gave me this product that had like,
[50:43.950 --> 50:45.390]  he was like, yeah, you just top dress it.
[50:45.390 --> 50:47.550]  And I'm like, what do you mean?
[50:47.550 --> 50:50.430]  You know, like I'm like young, I'm like,
[50:50.430 --> 50:51.390]  but what about the bottle?
[50:51.390 --> 50:52.950]  Like, what do you mean top dress it?
[50:52.950 --> 50:54.590]  And then he goes, you just like mix it in,
[50:54.590 --> 50:56.350]  you massage it in the top and water it in.
[50:56.350 --> 50:58.870]  I'm like, huh, okay.
[50:58.870 --> 51:01.150]  Well, let's look at like, let's look into this, you know?
[51:01.150 --> 51:03.150]  And so I was still in Tahoe growing,
[51:03.150 --> 51:04.510]  growing my little medical thing.
[51:04.510 --> 51:09.510]  And when I moved to Hawaii,
[51:09.510 --> 51:11.590]  when I left Tahoe,
[51:11.590 --> 51:14.390]  because my last concussion was very heavy.
[51:14.390 --> 51:16.830]  I had like, it kind of got a small stutter.
[51:16.830 --> 51:19.110]  I kind of got gnarly migraines.
[51:19.110 --> 51:20.830]  It was my fifth major concussion.
[51:20.830 --> 51:22.510]  And it was scary.
[51:22.510 --> 51:23.950]  Like, so head trauma's real,
[51:23.950 --> 51:25.390]  be safe out there, wear a helmet.
[51:25.390 --> 51:28.310]  I've exploded three helmets.
[51:29.630 --> 51:31.630]  If I exploded, I just mean like cracked open,
[51:31.630 --> 51:33.430]  you know, like better that than my head.
[51:33.430 --> 51:34.750]  But you know, it's a-
[51:34.750 --> 51:36.310]  It takes a lot.
[51:36.310 --> 51:37.150]  Yeah.
[51:37.150 --> 51:38.350]  And it's scary, you know?
[51:38.350 --> 51:40.630]  So when you wake up and you're like,
[51:40.630 --> 51:41.790]  how long have I been out?
[51:41.790 --> 51:42.750]  You know, it's just scary.
[51:42.750 --> 51:44.950]  And you can go into, you know,
[51:45.830 --> 51:47.710]  you know, like they make movies
[51:47.710 --> 51:49.910]  about those football players that have concussions.
[51:49.910 --> 51:50.750]  You know, like-
[51:50.750 --> 51:55.190]  CTE. Yeah, that's a real, real concern of mine too.
[51:55.190 --> 51:56.350]  A depression.
[51:56.350 --> 51:59.030]  And like, I definitely changed as a person.
[51:59.030 --> 52:01.590]  It was really a dark time for me after that concussion.
[52:01.590 --> 52:04.350]  I was just really in a weird head space,
[52:04.350 --> 52:06.590]  literally, like a weird mental spot.
[52:06.590 --> 52:10.230]  I felt I just pushed it too hard snowboarding.
[52:10.230 --> 52:12.310]  And if I keep doing it, I'm going to kill myself.
[52:12.310 --> 52:14.350]  And I enjoy life.
[52:14.350 --> 52:15.190]  I like life.
[52:15.190 --> 52:16.750]  Life is a fun thing to do.
[52:16.750 --> 52:19.590]  I'd rather do life than not doing life.
[52:19.590 --> 52:22.670]  So I moved to Hawaii because Hawaii is fucking cool.
[52:22.670 --> 52:24.470]  Like I've traveled there.
[52:24.470 --> 52:26.270]  You know, you do good on a run
[52:27.030 --> 52:29.070]  or you save up some money on a couple moves.
[52:29.070 --> 52:33.830]  And you're like, hey, I'm done festival hopping.
[52:33.830 --> 52:35.750]  Snow hasn't really hit yet.
[52:35.750 --> 52:37.310]  I'm going to go to Hawaii later.
[52:37.310 --> 52:39.150]  You know, so you go to Hawaii and check it out.
[52:39.150 --> 52:39.990]  I fell in love.
[52:39.990 --> 52:43.670]  Like I spent a month on Oahu one time.
[52:43.670 --> 52:46.310]  I spent a month in Maui one time.
[52:46.310 --> 52:49.830]  And I spent like my first time on the big island.
[52:49.830 --> 52:51.390]  It was only like three weeks.
[52:51.390 --> 52:54.150]  And as soon as I put my foot on that ground,
[52:54.150 --> 52:55.710]  I felt Mama Pele.
[52:55.710 --> 52:59.750]  And I was like, wow, this is a vibration.
[52:59.750 --> 53:01.990]  Like as soon as you touch down, if you're in the vibe,
[53:01.990 --> 53:02.830]  like you feel it.
[53:02.830 --> 53:04.310]  There's a vibration on that island.
[53:04.310 --> 53:06.910]  I'm no disrespect to the all islands.
[53:06.910 --> 53:08.870]  All those islands are magical and beautiful.
[53:08.870 --> 53:11.630]  And I highly recommend people go
[53:11.630 --> 53:13.070]  and show them respect and love
[53:13.070 --> 53:15.030]  because Hawaiians are a beautiful culture,
[53:15.030 --> 53:17.350]  a beautiful place, big ups and respect.
[53:18.270 --> 53:21.030]  But when I felt Hawaii, I just touched down.
[53:21.030 --> 53:22.470]  I was like, this is where I'm going to be.
[53:22.510 --> 53:24.670]  And so when I was like over Tahoe,
[53:24.670 --> 53:26.470]  I picked up and moved to Hawaii.
[53:26.470 --> 53:30.790]  I was like, just kind of been a lucky situation.
[53:31.670 --> 53:34.190]  I had a little bit left over,
[53:34.190 --> 53:37.150]  got a job at the local deli and live in Hawaii
[53:37.150 --> 53:38.630]  and just try to start figuring it out.
[53:38.630 --> 53:41.670]  I was like, here's a whole new chapter in my life.
[53:42.830 --> 53:43.670]  Yeah.
[53:43.670 --> 53:45.230]  Extended, you know, so.
[53:45.230 --> 53:46.830]  It's a 180.
[53:46.830 --> 53:48.350]  It was really magical.
[53:48.350 --> 53:49.190]  I'm very blessed.
[53:49.190 --> 53:51.550]  It was a really, like I said, gnarly time,
[53:51.790 --> 53:53.150]  mentally and emotionally
[53:53.150 --> 53:55.510]  because of what I was going through.
[53:55.510 --> 53:56.990]  I just didn't feel like myself
[53:56.990 --> 53:59.390]  because of all the head trauma I had
[53:59.390 --> 54:01.110]  or maybe whatever, I don't know.
[54:01.110 --> 54:04.910]  So I was just kind of like figuring my shit out
[54:04.910 --> 54:09.830]  and I was lucky enough to just like meet some crews
[54:09.830 --> 54:11.910]  who were like super organic,
[54:11.910 --> 54:15.270]  like did it like all the elders who I was trimming for,
[54:15.270 --> 54:16.310]  who I was digging holes for,
[54:16.310 --> 54:18.350]  all the elders who taught me like,
[54:18.350 --> 54:19.670]  you do, this is how you do it.
[54:19.670 --> 54:21.230]  You dig holes, you mix bird,
[54:21.910 --> 54:23.590]  like organic fertilizer and you water
[54:23.590 --> 54:24.710]  and you maybe make a tea.
[54:24.710 --> 54:27.190]  Like, that's just how I was.
[54:27.190 --> 54:28.510]  That's just how I saw it done.
[54:28.510 --> 54:30.310]  Not how I wasn't like taught, you know,
[54:30.310 --> 54:32.630]  like until I kind of got to Hawaii
[54:32.630 --> 54:36.390]  and like shot out fresh farms, crew, big ups,
[54:36.390 --> 54:38.670]  shot out Conscious Rhythms crew, big ups.
[54:38.670 --> 54:41.990]  Like they're just beautiful residents,
[54:41.990 --> 54:44.590]  beautiful crew family that, you know,
[54:44.590 --> 54:45.710]  took me under their wing.
[54:45.710 --> 54:47.510]  Cause I love the plant, you know,
[54:47.510 --> 54:50.150]  like we were talking earlier, this plant spider webs,
[54:50.470 --> 54:53.430]  and like, as long as you come with an open heart,
[54:53.430 --> 54:55.870]  a humble mind and a hard work ethic,
[54:55.870 --> 54:58.230]  I feel like you can make it anywhere really.
[54:58.230 --> 55:01.910]  That's just, my family was work for hours,
[55:01.910 --> 55:04.710]  like my pops smoked a time or two,
[55:04.710 --> 55:07.990]  but like it wasn't a thing in my family.
[55:07.990 --> 55:08.830]  You trust that?
[55:08.830 --> 55:09.670]  You know, it's both.
[55:09.670 --> 55:11.510]  You know, it's fair.
[55:11.510 --> 55:14.910]  Led in by crews who are like, just like by word of mouth
[55:14.910 --> 55:19.590]  or by just, you know, your work ethic and your heart.
[55:20.350 --> 55:22.110]  They opened up and I'm, you know,
[55:22.110 --> 55:24.830]  like I'm grateful for everything I've learned from them.
[55:24.830 --> 55:26.390]  You know, we've had our ups and downs,
[55:26.390 --> 55:29.670]  but I'm sure like, you know,
[55:29.670 --> 55:31.710]  I just actually reached out to Rusty yesterday,
[55:31.710 --> 55:33.110]  like big ups, fresh farms, you know,
[55:33.110 --> 55:36.730]  like I got so much love for the Hawaiian experience.
[55:37.710 --> 55:41.310]  Everybody there has a extreme diverse amount
[55:41.310 --> 55:42.870]  of growing tactics, you know,
[55:42.870 --> 55:47.870]  from the chemical grow and some gnarly spray
[55:47.990 --> 55:51.350]  they get from a friend to KNF,
[55:51.350 --> 55:54.470]  like, you know, Master Cho, respect Master Cho,
[55:54.470 --> 55:55.870]  you know, KNF family.
[55:55.870 --> 55:57.710]  You know, that's where he kind of spearheaded.
[55:57.710 --> 55:59.150]  That's where I first heard of him.
[55:59.150 --> 56:01.990]  Yeah. The University of Hawaii, I think.
[56:01.990 --> 56:02.810]  Yeah.
[56:02.810 --> 56:04.750]  Did a lot of studies or work, field trials,
[56:04.750 --> 56:07.070]  as they call them officially.
[56:07.070 --> 56:09.150]  Well, I actually had a friend, you know,
[56:09.150 --> 56:11.870]  who had a coffee farm who I ended up working on
[56:11.870 --> 56:15.150]  with my lady who I'm with now.
[56:15.150 --> 56:16.930]  We met in Hawaii.
[56:16.930 --> 56:21.290]  She was on a yoga retreat and we caught each other's spark
[56:21.290 --> 56:23.050]  and she ended up staying a lot longer.
[56:23.050 --> 56:26.150]  And just we're nine years later, still together.
[56:27.170 --> 56:28.490]  But yeah, very special.
[56:28.490 --> 56:30.910]  And we worked on a coffee farm together.
[56:30.910 --> 56:32.770]  That was an organic coffee farm.
[56:32.770 --> 56:35.210]  So we got to kind of meet the,
[56:35.210 --> 56:37.170]  and it was like very close friends, you know,
[56:37.170 --> 56:38.930]  Hawaii, you know, it's a big island,
[56:38.930 --> 56:40.170]  but it's a small island too.
[56:40.170 --> 56:43.570]  You know, it's like everybody knows each other, right?
[56:44.290 --> 56:47.450]  We got to meet the USDA certified organic people
[56:47.450 --> 56:50.690]  who actually go around and like pass people
[56:50.690 --> 56:51.630]  for certifications.
[56:51.630 --> 56:54.090]  And we kind of learned that like,
[56:54.090 --> 56:57.170]  organics may not be what you think it means, you know?
[56:57.170 --> 56:58.010]  So at least-
[56:58.010 --> 57:00.090]  100% these days, dude.
[57:00.090 --> 57:01.210]  Yeah. USDA scale.
[57:01.210 --> 57:03.090]  So it's just,
[57:03.090 --> 57:07.010]  and I'm sure everybody has a different opinion
[57:07.010 --> 57:08.550]  on what organics is, but you know,
[57:08.550 --> 57:10.770]  like the Hawaiian crew that I work with,
[57:10.770 --> 57:12.170]  that kind of took me under their wing.
[57:12.210 --> 57:15.050]  It's just, you know, dry amendments and microbes,
[57:15.050 --> 57:16.450]  you know, dry amendments and microbes,
[57:16.450 --> 57:18.450]  a foyer here and there, you know, it's like,
[57:18.450 --> 57:21.650]  and then, you know, one of my friend's ladies
[57:21.650 --> 57:25.450]  was going to the, you know, the university there
[57:25.450 --> 57:27.610]  just for some classes, you know,
[57:27.610 --> 57:30.430]  she was already a very accoladed, you know,
[57:30.430 --> 57:33.250]  Cecilia, you're a rockstar, Celia, big ups.
[57:33.250 --> 57:35.850]  Like she's a horticulturalist, you know,
[57:35.850 --> 57:40.250]  she's into roses and she just heard about this KMF stuff
[57:40.250 --> 57:41.170]  through the school.
[57:41.170 --> 57:43.450]  And I remember kind of me and my buddy were like,
[57:43.450 --> 57:44.450]  you do what?
[57:44.450 --> 57:45.290]  You like-
[57:45.290 --> 57:46.130]  Yeah, me too.
[57:46.130 --> 57:46.950]  What?
[57:46.950 --> 57:49.970]  You ferment sugar and what?
[57:49.970 --> 57:51.650]  Like, that seems like a lot of sugar.
[57:51.650 --> 57:53.670]  Like, I mean, you know, just kind of like,
[57:53.670 --> 57:55.970]  not talking shit, but definitely like-
[57:55.970 --> 57:58.370]  You don't believe it till you believe it.
[57:58.370 --> 58:02.730]  Yeah. And you know, so I didn't really get into KMF
[58:02.730 --> 58:03.910]  in Hawaii.
[58:03.910 --> 58:07.310]  We were just, you know, pumping dry amendments
[58:07.310 --> 58:09.690]  and, you know, compost teas, you know,
[58:10.130 --> 58:12.010]  maybe like a fish spray and veg or something,
[58:12.010 --> 58:15.210]  but like rocking, you know, a few different greenhouses.
[58:15.210 --> 58:17.970]  I was just, you know, working, you know, I was a worker.
[58:17.970 --> 58:20.050]  I was ready to be a work dog, you know,
[58:20.050 --> 58:22.970]  a hound dog just sitting on a property.
[58:22.970 --> 58:24.490]  Most valuable person.
[58:24.490 --> 58:28.570]  Watching plants grow, smoking herbs, smoking hash,
[58:28.570 --> 58:32.130]  watching plants grow, pruning plants, loving it.
[58:32.130 --> 58:32.970]  I loved it.
[58:32.970 --> 58:33.810]  Like I learned a lot.
[58:33.810 --> 58:36.690]  Like I was in a really, you know,
[58:36.690 --> 58:39.210]  I don't want to say dark, but it was definitely not,
[58:39.730 --> 58:40.570]  because it was Hawaii.
[58:40.570 --> 58:42.250]  Like how dark of a time could I have
[58:42.250 --> 58:45.130]  figuring out how to get in a jungle growing weed in Hawaii?
[58:45.130 --> 58:49.450]  So I was just, you know, like I was mentally recuperating.
[58:49.450 --> 58:52.890]  You know, I turned, I was a vegan at a time.
[58:52.890 --> 58:54.570]  I'm not anymore.
[58:54.570 --> 58:56.530]  Respect to everybody and their wishes,
[58:56.530 --> 58:58.930]  but I personally, I'm a, you know,
[58:58.930 --> 59:00.530]  I'm a vegetarian that eats meat
[59:00.530 --> 59:02.810]  probably once or twice a year, you know,
[59:02.810 --> 59:05.730]  but I don't call myself any,
[59:05.730 --> 59:08.170]  I don't like to put myself in a box, you know.
[59:08.210 --> 59:09.890]  I can probably eat anything at any time I want to
[59:09.890 --> 59:11.170]  if I'm feeling like it, you know,
[59:11.170 --> 59:13.090]  but back in Hawaii,
[59:13.090 --> 59:16.890]  when you have super delicious food at your fingertips,
[59:16.890 --> 59:18.770]  like apple bananas.
[59:18.770 --> 59:19.850]  Fresh fruits.
[59:19.850 --> 59:20.690]  Guava.
[59:20.690 --> 59:21.530]  Yeah.
[59:21.530 --> 59:24.170]  Kaya, mangoes, lillacoy,
[59:24.170 --> 59:26.690]  literally on the property, like everywhere.
[59:26.690 --> 59:30.210]  So I mean, like I was, I was in recoup mode.
[59:30.210 --> 59:33.690]  I was recuperating from like just head trauma,
[59:33.690 --> 59:35.490]  heart trauma, you know, just like,
[59:36.330 --> 59:38.250]  just recuperating, finding myself, you know,
[59:38.250 --> 59:40.690]  like after finding myself in Tahoe
[59:40.690 --> 59:42.570]  and it's like beating myself up,
[59:42.570 --> 59:45.770]  like Mama Pele took care of me, you know.
[59:45.770 --> 59:48.050]  She's like, if you open your heart, work hard,
[59:48.050 --> 59:49.370]  you know, she took care of me.
[59:49.370 --> 59:53.170]  And I have a lot of love and respect for that island,
[59:53.170 --> 59:54.930]  for the crew that took care of me,
[59:54.930 --> 59:57.410]  for the crew that was there for me in my hard times,
[59:57.410 --> 59:58.930]  like big ups and respect.
[59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.050]  Like, I hope you all well.
[01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.490]  If you ever want to get some really high grade CBD,
[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.690]  go check out Sheen of Hawaii,
[01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.010]  that they got some really good CBD genetics,
[01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.850]  really amazing crew.
[01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.530]  S-H-E-E-N.
[01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.370]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.770]  And that's a whole nother thing I'd love to get into,
[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.490]  maybe shout out some Hawaiian crew.
[01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.450]  That to me is some of the best weed I've ever smoked.
[01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:25.050]  It's called the Sheen.
[01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:29.050]  They've won an award with it, with their hash.
[01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.650]  Yeah, it's, I mean, Hawaii's got greater,
[01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.810]  that's Hawaii, you know what I mean?
[01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.930]  The hardest part about growing weed in Hawaii
[01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:37.450]  is drying it, you know?
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:39.530]  The humidity.
[01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:40.930]  Yeah, you know, I was going to ask you
[01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:41.890]  about some of those things,
[01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.170]  but a comment here from 71DPO,
[01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:46.970]  he does a show here, Saturday's Mental Breakdown,
[01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.490]  where he does, he talks a lot about, you know,
[01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.210]  mental health, a lot of stigmatisms associated with that.
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:55.610]  But, you know, he says he's feeling that a deeper connection
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.690]  when he started making his own inputs.
[01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.410]  And yeah, I absolutely, I give him shit about it,
[01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.890]  but that's just to bust his balls.
[01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:05.170]  But yeah, you know, you really,
[01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:06.570]  you feel more connected to it.
[01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:09.330]  And that's a lot of the reason why a lot of us,
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:11.970]  or at least myself, wanted to start growing,
[01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.010]  because I wanted it to be clean.
[01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.450]  I wanted to know what was going into it.
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.690]  But it, you know, it captivates you
[01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.810]  when you start growing it.
[01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.770]  There's, you know, everybody says is, you know,
[01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.650]  who's the master and who's the, you know, the servant?
[01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:26.450]  Oh, I'm a plant servant.
[01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.610]  I'm a servant to the plant.
[01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:31.130]  I do what she says, you know, like,
[01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.890]  and I get respect, bro.
[01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.850]  Like, KNF and Jodam is a beautiful,
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:37.170]  of a beautiful practice.
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.370]  I don't talk shit on it.
[01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.650]  This is just a part of my story.
[01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.490]  We'll get into my whole Jodam, KNF practice.
[01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.890]  That's what I use in my backyard currently.
[01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.050]  It's different KNF and Jodam
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.650]  and other African natural farming techniques.
[01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:53.450]  And I've just, you know, natural farming,
[01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.970]  like natural farming, regenerative,
[01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:58.250]  because everybody trying to do that, you know,
[01:01:58.930 --> 01:01:59.770]  this is just a little part.
[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:01.370]  That's what I was doing at the time.
[01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:02.730]  It's what I knew at the time, you know,
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.970]  as we grow, we grow, hopefully, you know,
[01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.610]  that's what we want to do.
[01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.890]  Like whether we're growing humans,
[01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:12.090]  we're growing plants or, you know,
[01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:15.490]  we're growing whatever, you know,
[01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:16.490]  if you're paying attention,
[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:18.290]  you're hopefully growing and learning, you know.
[01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:19.130]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:20.970]  The never, never ending battle.
[01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.570]  And that's something that you want to do.
[01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.810]  And it real quick, I had wrote this down
[01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.050]  because you had mentioned the girl that you had met
[01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:29.690]  and you were talking about,
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.090]  I was doing yoga out there on the big island
[01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.490]  and we were talking about a small world.
[01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.890]  Did it happen to be in the Puna area at all?
[01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:35.170]  Kalani.
[01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:39.090]  My wife graduated from Kalani's.
[01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.410]  So did my wife.
[01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.850]  200 hours certification for yoga.
[01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:44.970]  Holy shit.
[01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:49.490]  She's a huge Hornings hideout, like a string summit person.
[01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.810]  She would go every year.
[01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.770]  She was heartbroken.
[01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:55.890]  This was the last year for it after COVID.
[01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.330]  So we have a lot in common, Chad.
[01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.330]  Fuck, dude.
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.410]  That's so crazy.
[01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:05.170]  Man, I tell you, man, it's the connection.
[01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.050]  One connection, one love.
[01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.210]  We're all connected, man.
[01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:09.770]  It's a beautiful thing.
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.770]  And this plant brought us together today.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:13.690]  Look at this, dude.
[01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.330]  That's beautiful.
[01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:17.610]  I was like, yo, I got some herbs.
[01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.450]  You want to smoke?
[01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:21.090]  Like that was my pickup line.
[01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.250]  And they're like, oh, what's this?
[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.090]  I was like, I grew that.
[01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.610]  And yeah, you know, like, and so this is,
[01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:29.290]  it's embarrassing.
[01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:30.890]  My mind's blown right now.
[01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.690]  Like, and I'm trying to think back.
[01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:34.210]  So it was probably, you said nine years.
[01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:37.010]  I think it was maybe six or seven years ago
[01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:40.410]  that she was there, but holy shit.
[01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.250]  That's.
[01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:44.050]  I think I could be misspeaking,
[01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:46.490]  but I think it got buried by lava.
[01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.130]  Yeah, it was close.
[01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:51.170]  Like it, the last time that it went,
[01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:52.530]  it was heading for it.
[01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.490]  But then like at the last minute,
[01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:57.170]  I think she had said it kind of diverted and went around.
[01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:00.090]  And now it's not the same retreat.
[01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.130]  I think it's more of a like a vacation spot,
[01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.370]  but she still knows a few of the people that cook there.
[01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:06.650]  So.
[01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:11.650]  Yeah, I was on the Kona side and the Eden Rocks big up,
[01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:17.890]  you know, all the, all the fucking whole Hawaii big up,
[01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:21.090]  like real talk, Hawaii special, really special.
[01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:23.530]  For real.
[01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.690]  And you mentioned too, that, you know, the USDA,
[01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:28.010]  you know, organics,
[01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:32.050]  when I was doing school for sustainable agriculture,
[01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.010]  that's when a lot of the labeling,
[01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:37.290]  that's when organics on a product became marketing.
[01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.450]  Once these little labels and things that, you know,
[01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:43.650]  make you want to buy it and pay like $3 more,
[01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:44.930]  they became marketing.
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.650]  The standards progressively dropped.
[01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:52.050]  Like you could get into, you know, the grass fed beef,
[01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:55.010]  but is it grass finished or is it finished?
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:57.810]  These are not things that were taught as consumers
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.970]  that you see the little sticker and you're like,
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:02.410]  feel good logo, buy it.
[01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.250]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.970]  And I've definitely come victim
[01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:06.810]  of all of the marketing ploys, you know.
[01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:07.650]  Me too.
[01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:09.610]  Everybody has really, I mean, we're humans.
[01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:12.730]  That's, I think they've studied this to manipulate us
[01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:14.570]  and I could be wrong, but.
[01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:15.570]  I think you're right.
[01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:18.970]  But yeah, it's real talk.
[01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:23.690]  You know, it's, I've worked with lots of different crews.
[01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:27.010]  I'm grateful to say that, no talking shit on anybody,
[01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.690]  but like, you know, I've worked for people
[01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:32.770]  who are blowing up houses, who are sleeping on couches.
[01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:33.730]  And those are the people that are like,
[01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.930]  yo, I got enough money to buy another house.
[01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.290]  You want to sleep on the couch and grow four more rooms?
[01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.490]  And I'm like, not really.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.010]  But, you know, respect to you.
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.130]  Like you're fucking killing it.
[01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.410]  I'll keep trimming for you and moving things around.
[01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.250]  But like.
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:48.010]  Hard time.
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:48.850]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:52.650]  And also like, and they were using general hydroponics
[01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:53.650]  or botanic air.
[01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:56.890]  And like, at the time I didn't know, you know,
[01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.130]  like it looked good, smoked good, you know,
[01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.650]  but I could definitely tell a difference than my home.
[01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.850]  My like the outdoor herb I'd get in fall.
[01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.730]  You know, the outdoor, I mean, back in the day,
[01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.450]  those like little hoop house outdoors,
[01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:13.890]  the gorilla shade grown outdoors, those were good.
[01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.130]  That was good herb.
[01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.370]  Like, I'm not to say it's not anymore.
[01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:21.330]  But you know, it was, I just, fuck, I feel old.
[01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.290]  Like, it's just different.
[01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:23.970]  I'm not even old, but you know, it was just different.
[01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:28.970]  And it's like, as things change, things change.
[01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:31.370]  They, you know, they do.
[01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:33.490]  And, you know, you're kind of talking about
[01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.930]  or like hinting at, you know,
[01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.650]  there's a lot of people who get opinionated
[01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:38.770]  about grow styles out there.
[01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:42.610]  You know, I personally, I usually try to encourage
[01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:45.170]  a lot of people to start growing or get growing.
[01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:48.570]  And so they haven't necessarily experimented yet.
[01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:50.570]  So I'm like, you know what, just do
[01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:53.930]  whatever makes you do it, get good at it.
[01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.050]  And then if you want to explore and try different things,
[01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:57.090]  absolutely do that.
[01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:59.370]  I like doing it this way, give it a shot.
[01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:04.130]  But I'm all for any, anybody who wants to grow the plant
[01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.770]  and dedicate their time to this plant, hats off.
[01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:08.610]  You know?
[01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.010]  Respect, big ups, keep growing the plant.
[01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:11.810]  Like don't let anybody hate or hate on you.
[01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.050]  Like for real, I got friends who grow
[01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.770]  all types of big ag salts and they're crushing it
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.010]  and they're doing a great job.
[01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.050]  The product looks great and they flush it well.
[01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.610]  And it's top notch and people pay top dollar for it.
[01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:26.850]  Not to say that's the same exact with organic outdoor
[01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:29.970]  or outdoor, whatever, like good weed sells.
[01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.370]  Like however it's grown, good weed sells.
[01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.570]  Like quality is quality.
[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:35.090]  Like I don't care what you say.
[01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:36.890]  Like, yeah, there's bad organic.
[01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.290]  Like, yeah, there's organic weed
[01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.730]  that make that taste like fish or compost.
[01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:44.610]  And then yeah, there's GH, general hydroponics herb
[01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:46.770]  that tastes like algae and gross,
[01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.010]  like kind of burns your throat.
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.170]  You know, like, but that's not all of it.
[01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.570]  That's just like we were talking about earlier
[01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:53.850]  with saturation of a market,
[01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:55.850]  you're gonna get the drop in quality, you know?
[01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:57.770]  But you gotta be those like Rolls Royces.
[01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:59.050]  You gotta be those Rolexes.
[01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:02.050]  You gotta be those, you know, whatever's popular,
[01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.450]  you know, and really quality.
[01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:04.890]  Like whether it's popular or not,
[01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.370]  it stands the test of time.
[01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:08.610]  You know, everyone's talking for the best OG.
[01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:10.410]  Everyone's talking for the best herbs still.
[01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:12.890]  Everyone's talking for like purple candy gas.
[01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:14.730]  Everyone's over here wanting something special,
[01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.210]  like unique one-to-one, you know?
[01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.370]  Like everybody's talking for something special.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.450]  Everyone's like, we're all the same, you know?
[01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:23.410]  Like respect to that.
[01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:27.450]  Like own you, own, find what you like and chase that.
[01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.170]  Don't let anybody get in your way.
[01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.370]  You know, a lot of people have talked about
[01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:35.890]  strains that we have lost due to time or to, you know,
[01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.930]  the industrialization of cannabis, you know,
[01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.810]  market consumer driven.
[01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:43.250]  We forget about some things chasing the new hype.
[01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:45.330]  And that's definitely real.
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.290]  That's definitely happened.
[01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:50.250]  And I think we're almost, as a flower loving smoker,
[01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.610]  I think we're honestly on another cusp of that.
[01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:54.730]  I don't hear anybody talking about it,
[01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:58.530]  but a lot of people are selecting for concentrates
[01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:01.010]  over the last many years and moving forward
[01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.010]  because concentrates really is where the market's at.
[01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.250]  Now you want kind of like a sandy head,
[01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:09.730]  these greasy plants, which are some of my favorites,
[01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:11.490]  they're not good for washing.
[01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:16.210]  So there's slowly but surely going to be whittled out
[01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:18.970]  as we've, you know, we're at kind of the cusp
[01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:22.490]  of maybe losing some more strains that were great
[01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.930]  just because the market said,
[01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:27.210]  oh, we need the sandy heads because they wash better.
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.490]  Well, here's some free game, you know,
[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.490]  like fuck washing them, throw them in some free rolls.
[01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.570]  Those are like the number one selling product
[01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:33.530]  in a dispensary.
[01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:36.010]  Like, so yeah, have your washers and have some free rolls.
[01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.570]  Throw some free game at it.
[01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:42.210]  Like people maybe, you know, focus on things that sell
[01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:43.770]  because this is a tight industry.
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.650]  I'm in the industry right now.
[01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:48.050]  Try and keep my personal Instagram separate
[01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:50.010]  than my, you know, business moves.
[01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:53.730]  And like, I'm in the industry and things are tight.
[01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:55.770]  Things are rough, especially in organics.
[01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.570]  Like you think, I mean, look, like look at McDonald's.
[01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.010]  The line of McDonald's is long.
[01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:02.050]  I drive past McDonald's every day.
[01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.450]  It's long as fuck.
[01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:04.290]  Yeah, dude.
[01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:06.850]  When I go to the organic food store, I don't wait in line.
[01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.330]  Like there's no, there's like, no, I'm, you know,
[01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.690]  the town I moved to, it's not a big, it's not big.
[01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.210]  And it's like, and to each his own, all respect,
[01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.730]  but like the parallels with cannabis, like,
[01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:23.450]  yeah, you could have the best smelling organic, whatever.
[01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:24.530]  Do people care?
[01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.370]  Is it good?
[01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:26.210]  How much is it?
[01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.850]  You know, like that's what people care about.
[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:30.450]  You know, so it's like, as a business, it's like,
[01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:33.090]  it has to make sense or it doesn't, you know?
[01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.410]  And a lot of conventional organics is pretty expensive.
[01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:41.010]  And that's why I've used K&F in my backyard.
[01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:42.970]  That's why I use Jodan in my backyard.
[01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.170]  That's why I use different African natural farming
[01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.010]  in my backyard.
[01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:49.850]  Like natural farming, isn't just K&F or Jodan,
[01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:52.330]  like big ups and respect to those crew.
[01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:53.290]  I've met them both.
[01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.690]  I've taken their classes.
[01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:55.610]  I've learned a lot.
[01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:58.090]  I'm very grateful, but it's, you know,
[01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:01.250]  there's all different types of Asian natural farming
[01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.810]  and African natural farming and South American
[01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:05.690]  and Central American natural farming.
[01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:07.570]  And go tap into with some of these people
[01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:09.290]  who've been growing corn and, you know,
[01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:12.290]  Central and like, you know, what, like Mexico.
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.770]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.490]  For hundreds of years with little water,
[01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:18.250]  like go tap in and see how they've been doing it.
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.050]  Like, you know, there's lots of ways to do it
[01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:23.210]  that aren't considered conventional,
[01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.610]  but they're age old practices that work, you know?
[01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:26.890]  So it's all about tapping in.
[01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.450]  And that's one thing I love to do.
[01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.130]  You know, I went to the Living Soil Symposium,
[01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:35.130]  I've taken Master Cho classes and, you know,
[01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:37.210]  weekend, you know, lessons with him.
[01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:41.170]  I've taken Jodan classes and multiple day lessons with him,
[01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:44.650]  you know, and like, I'm grateful enough to have worked
[01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:48.490]  on a Dragonflyers Medicine certified farm, big ups,
[01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:49.890]  you know, that whole entire crew.
[01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.450]  Like I've learned a lot.
[01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.050]  I've learned a lot and everything I learned,
[01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:57.010]  I put to my own backyard or my own tent.
[01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.570]  You know, if I, I'll be real,
[01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:03.570]  like right now I'm not using KNF in my tent just for access,
[01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.170]  but I use all natural farming in my backyard
[01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.290]  and mostly from seed.
[01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:10.690]  You know, when I'm doing like a,
[01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:12.690]  if I'm doing a pollination or something,
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.290]  I'll bring some cuts into the mix,
[01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:18.410]  but outside it's as regenerative as possible.
[01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:21.850]  No money should be spent, like things grow naturally.
[01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:24.130]  I just moved to the Western slopes of Colorado
[01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:25.650]  and I had a pretty cool backyard
[01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:28.530]  and I, it was kind of a shitty backyard.
[01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:30.290]  And I turned it into a cool little spot
[01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.610]  and I'm grateful.
[01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.970]  And I grew a shit ton of seeds from seed,
[01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:37.490]  of plants from seed and they grew amazingly well
[01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:40.010]  in this super heavy clay mineralized soil.
[01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:43.050]  And I was like, well, this'll be fun.
[01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.610]  So next year it's even, even more on, you know,
[01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.690]  like I just popped some, you know,
[01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:50.250]  a lot of things that were kind of what is.
[01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.450]  And then I also popped my air horn that I knew was fire
[01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:55.650]  and I wanted to kind of see what was in there.
[01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:56.890]  So I popped a lot of them.
[01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:00.290]  And yeah, it was, it was fun, you know,
[01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:03.170]  like the regenerative side of things,
[01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.930]  like the more you learn and put to use,
[01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:09.530]  like the more you learn, you know, it was real fun.
[01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:14.130]  I'm sure like everybody, in my opinion, I could be wrong.
[01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:18.050]  That's why the, everybody in the damn crew always throws,
[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:20.810]  you know, like get togethers.
[01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.330]  They all try and learn from each other.
[01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:25.210]  They all try and share the vibes, you know, like respect.
[01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:27.090]  That's what we should be doing as a whole community
[01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:28.970]  is just trying to, you know,
[01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:30.930]  we're not through the woods yet, you know,
[01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.130]  we're still, you know,
[01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.770]  little stepchild in the industry game.
[01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:38.690]  You know, we can't roll our, you know,
[01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:39.770]  we need to stick together.
[01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:41.530]  It's tight right now.
[01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:45.210]  I see, you know, organic people leading the way in that.
[01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.930]  I see a lot of all base people pointing fingers
[01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:51.210]  and hiding SOPs and saying this is proprietary.
[01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.610]  And I'm like, okay.
[01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:56.850]  Yeah.
[01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.010]  Yeah.
[01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:59.610]  I'm just tangenting sometimes.
[01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:02.090]  No, you're good because you're absolutely right.
[01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:03.770]  The margins are super thin
[01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.090]  and it's hard to be competitive.
[01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.610]  That's why, you know, I hope that one day
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.770]  it becomes as easy as like home brewing or craft brewing.
[01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:13.770]  It's legal.
[01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:14.970]  Everybody can do it.
[01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:18.810]  You don't have to build fucking walls around your facility
[01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:20.690]  and hide them and have cameras and, you know,
[01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.050]  fill out all these paperwork and have these inspections.
[01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:25.810]  I'd love just to be able to do that
[01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.410]  because I think at that point,
[01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:29.730]  that is where the craft, which, you know,
[01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:32.970]  I typically place organic in will thrive
[01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:37.450]  because there is a market for high end, good quality stuff,
[01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.290]  but it's really the regulation
[01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:42.330]  and the framework of the business model
[01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:44.410]  that is killing it and making it
[01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.450]  so we're losing these things to, you know,
[01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.490]  the booth machine.
[01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:51.730]  I mean, in my opinion, Colorado screwed the booths.
[01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:54.530]  I mean, we can't even bring genetics in.
[01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:56.410]  They're like on a genetic.
[01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.770]  I'm in Washington, man.
[01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:01.290]  I do not feel bad for anybody other than, no.
[01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:02.770]  Us too, you know exactly why.
[01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:03.610]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.170]  Washington's laws are not the best.
[01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:06.610]  I feel bad for you, man.
[01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.250]  I was gonna like you, oh, legalization.
[01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:10.410]  And then you start reading shit
[01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:11.690]  and you're like, fuck that.
[01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.970]  Like this, like, you know.
[01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:14.450]  You were the first, yeah, we were,
[01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:17.210]  I mean, both of us, we were the first to do it.
[01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:19.730]  I think we actually voted a day sooner than Colorado.
[01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.050]  Colorado gets all the glory
[01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:22.210]  because you guys did it right.
[01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:25.530]  But yeah, no, we were one of the first.
[01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:28.610]  So we have probably some of the worst,
[01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:32.450]  but still laws on the books compared to states
[01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.050]  where you can still go to jail for a joint.
[01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.130]  So it's weird complaining about that
[01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:40.090]  because that still happens, but I'm still complaining.
[01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:41.130]  You know, I hear you.
[01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:43.250]  I mean, like we can complain,
[01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:45.810]  but we can also give thanks to how far we've come for sure.
[01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:46.650]  Yes.
[01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.690]  We're both sides of the coin.
[01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:50.330]  You know, like people say, oh, one love, one love this.
[01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:52.650]  It's like, yeah, but you know, when you get in a fight
[01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.050]  or like you have to defend something,
[01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.170]  you have to love something a lot to be able to defend it.
[01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.210]  And sometimes you got to fight for something
[01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:01.250]  and it may not be pretty, but you love,
[01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:03.410]  that comes from love, you know, that comes from a passion.
[01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:04.730]  That comes from deep down.
[01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:07.730]  Like that's not, you know, this type of fight,
[01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.770]  you know, the cannabis fight, like this is a plant.
[01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:10.610]  We're just growing a plant.
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:11.450]  Like what's up?
[01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:14.410]  Like we want to be, we want to be
[01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:18.890]  just as fair as every industry, you know?
[01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:20.490]  And until then.
[01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:21.330]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:24.570]  You know, just level the playing field.
[01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:26.610]  Give me, you know, that American dream
[01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:28.810]  of the free market or open market.
[01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:30.770]  Let me sink or swim on my own merit.
[01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:31.930]  That's all I'm asking,
[01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.930]  but that's not possible at the moment.
[01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:41.370]  You were mentioning different, that's a tangent.
[01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:43.170]  I will go down for a different hour.
[01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:45.510]  So I'll go back to, you know,
[01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:47.370]  you're talking about the different methods
[01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:50.090]  of natural farming and, you know,
[01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:53.610]  as somebody who's new to it over the last few years,
[01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.770]  I'm not as well versed.
[01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.410]  So when you're talking about, you know,
[01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:59.370]  like African natural farming,
[01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.130]  you had mentioned other ways too,
[01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.730]  and shout out to Alex Hardy here.
[01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:06.010]  He does the paradigm shift on the sister channel.
[01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.090]  I've learned a lot about dry farming from him
[01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.090]  and his crops and seeing him do that.
[01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:14.010]  And I'm like, well, that's fascinating
[01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:16.210]  because cannabis is so water intensive,
[01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:19.530]  but what are maybe some of the other differences?
[01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.490]  I'm guessing that they all revolve around
[01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:25.450]  like the same tenant of like regenerative and closing loops.
[01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:29.490]  But, you know, trying to use as minimal things as you can,
[01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:31.750]  doing your best, obviously not to bring things in
[01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.170]  from outsourcing, you know,
[01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:37.350]  as well as your time is precious.
[01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:41.490]  So, you know, the little you can do in a farm, the better,
[01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.970]  you know, the farmer, like a real,
[01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.450]  a really good farmer doesn't really,
[01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:48.090]  I mean, he does a lot, don't get me wrong,
[01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:48.930]  but you know what I mean?
[01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.810]  Like he's just tending to a lot of things,
[01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.410]  but like, it's all about preparation,
[01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:56.250]  all about preparation, hard work, but like,
[01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:59.090]  I find it easy, you know, I find it really easy.
[01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:01.290]  As long as you're tuned in and like, you know, the steps,
[01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:02.730]  you know, the, what you need to prep,
[01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:05.730]  you're like eyes open, like still learning, you know,
[01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:10.490]  like it's, you know, dry farming, I think it's special.
[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.290]  I personally have never done it, but you know, it's,
[01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.810]  again, I think that all goes back to like the preparation
[01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:17.770]  of the soil and using seeds, like a little,
[01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:19.530]  a lot more robust than clones.
[01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:21.370]  You know, I was having this conversation
[01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:23.050]  with somebody the other day, I was like,
[01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:25.210]  my dream is to just grow from seed
[01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:27.410]  to direct hash or pre-rolls.
[01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:30.650]  Like, please, anybody, you know, just,
[01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.530]  I was like, I mean, the market's not there.
[01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:35.250]  Everybody wants certain strains
[01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.230]  and it has to meet certain numbers.
[01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:41.290]  But you know, like when I think of commercial,
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:44.210]  I mean, I think how it's been done for centuries.
[01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:47.170]  I mean, like maybe I'm just too optimistic,
[01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:50.930]  but I'd love to just sprout a couple thousand seeds
[01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:54.530]  and grow even indoors, not indoors, but you know,
[01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:59.250]  like greenhouse or, you know, hoop house, just from seed,
[01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:02.410]  find stuff that washes, you know,
[01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:04.250]  there's ways to tell before you even harvest
[01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:06.410]  whether it's gonna wash, is it greasy, is it tacky?
[01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:10.410]  You do a little water hash extraction and see what's up.
[01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:12.210]  And then you, you know, diversify,
[01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:13.330]  all right, these are going to pre-rolls,
[01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.930]  those are going to hash, you know, and then just,
[01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.810]  you know, we all love our trimmers, don't get me wrong.
[01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:20.930]  I've trimmed a lot of weed, I trim my own weed,
[01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:24.570]  like respect, but you know, that's just a cost
[01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:26.770]  that's expensive in industry right now.
[01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:29.490]  And like any way you can mitigate that, that'd be awesome.
[01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.250]  But to be able to just be like, all right,
[01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:32.970]  well, you need processors, don't get me wrong,
[01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:35.010]  you know, hand processors.
[01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:38.410]  Another thing you're saying, like the things that don't wash
[01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:42.410]  I find that are amazing in sieve, like a dry sieve.
[01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:46.450]  And I find that not abundant enough in the market.
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:49.770]  So if you guys are looking for other outlets
[01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:52.530]  and for your things that don't wash,
[01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:54.890]  try just finding a tumbler or a sieve
[01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.930]  and get the nicest screens you can do and sell some sieve,
[01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:59.930]  man, old heads love sieve.
[01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:03.450]  I've got a big old jar right next to me.
[01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:06.250]  Like, bigger than a joint, sieve on a bowl,
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:10.370]  like I love some good dry sieve, I love good dry sieve.
[01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:13.130]  Like, I need to, I wanna see more good dry sieve.
[01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.970]  It's funny, people are always like,
[01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:15.170]  oh, the market doesn't want it.
[01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:16.530]  I'm like, I'm the market.
[01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.570]  Like I smoke a lot of products.
[01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:21.610]  Like I grow my own weed, I work in the industry,
[01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:23.610]  I buy product at dispensaries.
[01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.050]  I am the market, I'm telling you,
[01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:29.170]  more people want dry sieve, you know, it's like.
[01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:32.610]  Get the pollinator from Mila, Mila Jansen,
[01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:35.170]  that the tumbler there, that's a shout out to her.
[01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.450]  She just had a birthday.
[01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:39.850]  Texas, like, elderly, yeah.
[01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:43.050]  Yeah, when I was working at the dispensary,
[01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:47.210]  there was a company that did have some dry sieve
[01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:51.410]  and this guy came in and he bought it and he came back,
[01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:53.650]  just pissed as hell because he tried dabbing it
[01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.930]  and it didn't work and it just like inhaled
[01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:58.370]  and it was bad.
[01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:00.010]  So to the point we had to put a sign
[01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:01.810]  that this is not for dabbing.
[01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:02.770]  Do not dab.
[01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:04.530]  Yeah, right next to it.
[01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:06.290]  Maybe it was a nectar collector, but yeah,
[01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:09.110]  that was the only time I saw it and it was shitty.
[01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:12.490]  Like I wouldn't really even touch it, but it didn't move.
[01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:16.210]  I go to Amsterdam fairly frequently and I love, you know,
[01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:17.370]  like the temple ball hash.
[01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:18.770]  That's something that I don't see here.
[01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:21.530]  There's only one company I could think of in the state
[01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:23.150]  and I know there are more,
[01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:27.010]  but that makes anything that's even close
[01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:29.070]  to like a temple ball or that type of hash,
[01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:32.210]  it's concentrates, you know, diamonds and sauce,
[01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:36.330]  cake batter, wax, shatter, all of this stuff, popular.
[01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:38.170]  That's why it sells.
[01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:39.850]  And it looks cool and it's fun to eat.
[01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:40.690]  I mean, it's cool.
[01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:41.510]  I love it.
[01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:42.350]  I'm a solid, I love hash.
[01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:44.890]  I'm a hash head, but it's weird to say I'm a hash head.
[01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:48.690]  I smoke way more flour than I do hash, but I love hash.
[01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.530]  You know, like I love it all.
[01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:51.850]  I'm a stoner straight up.
[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:53.850]  I don't discriminate.
[01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.090]  I'll take it any way I can.
[01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:58.610]  Four or five dabs and like five bowls before I came on.
[01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:59.490]  I just puffed up.
[01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:00.730]  Like that's what we do, right?
[01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:05.010]  Like, I love a good sieve on a bowl,
[01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:07.130]  but I mean, I love nice solidness in a dab.
[01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.290]  I mean, I love it.
[01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:09.250]  The plant's magical.
[01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.250]  She saved my life.
[01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:12.330]  Definitely.
[01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.530]  Well, you know, maybe we talk about that real quick too.
[01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:16.970]  You know, we've kind of touched on it,
[01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.970]  how it has worked for you as, you know, medicinal
[01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:22.570]  and in the comment, one of the comments from earlier too,
[01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.970]  says, you know, Stoney Creek says,
[01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:26.250]  once he found out about his head trauma,
[01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:30.390]  cause, you know, actually anger and lack of control,
[01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:35.210]  it wasn't me that somehow, or it helped him.
[01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:36.810]  And same thing here, man.
[01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:39.330]  Like the impulsiveness, some of the mood swings,
[01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.890]  like the more I learned about CTE
[01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:43.690]  and the stuff that came out
[01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:46.170]  and how it does a lot of times develop, you know,
[01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:51.170]  in your forties or like show symptoms, you know,
[01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:53.290]  that's real and it's close to home
[01:22:53.290 --> 01:22:56.330]  cause depression is a motherfucker, but.
[01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:57.170]  It's real, man.
[01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:58.010]  It's real.
[01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:00.570]  And I'm no doctor.
[01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:04.370]  For me, antidepressants are not an option.
[01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:07.130]  I've been pharmaceutical free for over 10 years.
[01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:09.810]  And I, you know, I'm very grateful.
[01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.330]  Everybody's got their own path.
[01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.730]  Go your own way, do what works for you.
[01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:16.410]  I was forced on a pharmaceutical path when I was young
[01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:19.210]  and I've gotten the complete opposite as an adult.
[01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:23.150]  I, you know, I eat lots of medicinal mushrooms.
[01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:26.330]  I eat psychedelic mushrooms, medicinal mushrooms.
[01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:29.890]  I do fruit smoothies all the time, vegetable smoothies.
[01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:31.490]  I eat cannabis leaves.
[01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.090]  I eat cannabis seed.
[01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:37.130]  I do my best to like, you know, brain food, you know,
[01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:39.090]  as much brain food as I can.
[01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:41.210]  Luckily brain food helps me be healthy.
[01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:43.250]  So like health is wealth, you know,
[01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.850]  and like, you know, going back to depression, you know,
[01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:48.330]  if you focus on your health, that might help.
[01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:50.450]  I have found it to help me.
[01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:55.050]  My brain, I was so depressed and so was like not healthy.
[01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:58.810]  You know, I just, I figured the first thing I can focus on
[01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:01.170]  is like health, like diet.
[01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.170]  What's a healthy diet?
[01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.010]  I didn't know.
[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:03.830]  I grew up-
[01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:04.670]  Lifestyle, you know?
[01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:07.170]  Yeah, like I grew up eating fast food
[01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.350]  and sodas all the time.
[01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:10.450]  I was unhealthy, you know,
[01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:12.090]  like on top of a lot of head trauma.
[01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.970]  So when I was in Hawaii, I just like smoked a lot of herb.
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.970]  I actually was given an ACDC cut in Hawaii because, you know,
[01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:24.650]  I was talking about my head trauma with some old lady there.
[01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.130]  And she was like, well,
[01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:28.090]  I just went to California and brought back an ACDC.
[01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:30.210]  That's the CBD, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:31.730]  And I'd heard CBD before.
[01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:35.650]  I went to one of the old Emerald Cups back in,
[01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:41.610]  I want to say 08 or 09, back at area 101.
[01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:45.770]  And they had a CBD booth and they were juicing CBD plants.
[01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:48.490]  And I was like, and I got the whole CBD download.
[01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:50.190]  And I was like, oh, plants that don't get you high?
[01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:51.090]  Sure. Boom.
[01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:53.210]  You know, like it gave me a bunch of energy.
[01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:54.050]  It was fun.
[01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:55.330]  It wasn't to get me high, but you know,
[01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:56.610]  I was like, I kind of got, I was like,
[01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:57.450]  oh, it's a health thing.
[01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:58.290]  Cool.
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:00.490]  But, and then when I lived in Hawaii, I was like,
[01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:01.650]  oh, here's a CBD plant.
[01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:03.130]  I'll try growing it.
[01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:05.290]  So I grew it and I was just like, you know,
[01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:07.370]  I could extract it, but I'll try smoking it.
[01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:08.210]  Smoked it.
[01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:10.090]  I was like, yeah, doesn't get me high.
[01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:11.530]  But I felt different.
[01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.450]  You know, I felt good.
[01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:14.530]  Like I didn't feel tense.
[01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:15.610]  I didn't feel anxious.
[01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:19.570]  I didn't have random migraines that put me down for hours.
[01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:22.330]  You know, like, I mean, head trauma is gnarly.
[01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:24.250]  For me, at least I have migraines,
[01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:27.370]  like bad migraines that put me down.
[01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:29.410]  Like I would tear up.
[01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:30.250]  I wouldn't be crying.
[01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:31.770]  It would just be so much pressure.
[01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:35.290]  Like I would just be like so much, you know,
[01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:36.730]  like it was bad.
[01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:40.450]  And it was just like head swelling from head trauma.
[01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:42.410]  CBD helped me, you know, CBD.
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:46.010]  I started taking CBD tincture every day.
[01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:48.770]  You know, smoking CBD with my THC.
[01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:49.850]  Cause I didn't have the time.
[01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:51.170]  Didn't have any one-to-ones,
[01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:54.690]  but I was just like, this makes me feel better,
[01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:55.650]  but not high.
[01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.850]  You know, like it just made me feel better.
[01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:03.370]  You know, like it was hard to explain other than better.
[01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:06.770]  You know, and I just kind of leaned on that for a while
[01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:09.810]  in Hawaii and didn't really think anything of it.
[01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:12.290]  But then, you know, Oregon legalized.
[01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.450]  And when I was in Hawaii, Oregon legalized and I jumped on.
[01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:18.090]  I was like, well, I'm sick of people flying.
[01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.530]  You know, even though Hawaii has,
[01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:24.570]  at the time they had the most medical patients
[01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.170]  than any other state.
[01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:27.010]  Yeah.
[01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:27.930]  Wow.
[01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:28.850]  Yeah. Everybody grew weak.
[01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:32.690]  So I mean, the helicopter flying all over, you know,
[01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:35.250]  like counting, you know, making sure you're okay.
[01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.810]  You know, so like that's stressful, you know, like,
[01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:41.050]  so I was just like legal state, you know,
[01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:44.730]  so I would start putting, you know,
[01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:45.970]  I'm putting a resume together.
[01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:48.450]  Fuck, if you guys have been in the black market
[01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:50.770]  and putting a resume together for the large market,
[01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:53.770]  you're like, this is the weirdest shit ever.
[01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:54.610]  Do I?
[01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:55.450]  Nope.
[01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:57.810]  Yeah, so, you know, so, you know,
[01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:59.810]  I put a bunch of resumes out.
[01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.890]  I was like, fuck it.
[01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:03.490]  Like I'm trying to get into the industry, you know,
[01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:06.690]  like I'm sick of being stressed on chicken,
[01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:08.050]  robbed by cops, like.
[01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:12.410]  Shakedown, man.
[01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:14.610]  Even if you're legal, they're like, take your shit.
[01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:15.450]  Yeah.
[01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:16.290]  The fuck with you.
[01:27:16.290 --> 01:27:17.490]  You're like, they're like, oh, don't be cutting
[01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:19.810]  all your shit while you're go getting your paperwork.
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:21.370]  And then they'll look at your paperwork and be like,
[01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:26.250]  oh, you were legal, my bad, and just leave, you know?
[01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:28.090]  And you're like, oh, well, there goes that harvest,
[01:27:28.090 --> 01:27:31.330]  you know, and luckily that's never happened to me,
[01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:33.530]  but it's happened to a lot of my friends there.
[01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:37.290]  And you know, that's, I trimmed a lot.
[01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:38.650]  So that was my livelihood.
[01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:40.370]  I was like, well, that was a job that I lost.
[01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.450]  That was a job that I lost.
[01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:43.610]  But like, it affects, it has a trickle down
[01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:46.130]  from the farmer to the other culture, to the trimmer,
[01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:48.130]  to the market, really, you know?
[01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:50.610]  So it's like, I wanted to be in the legal.
[01:27:50.610 --> 01:27:53.130]  I was like, so I got a job at a dispensary.
[01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:54.650]  Someone gave me a chance, you know?
[01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:58.010]  Respect to Amazon Organics, South Eugene.
[01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:59.050]  I don't know if they're still around.
[01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:00.170]  I'm sure they are.
[01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:03.130]  Great dispensary, you know, gave me a shot.
[01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:06.370]  And I moved to Hawaii with, or I'm sorry,
[01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:09.530]  I moved to Oregon in Eugene with my wife.
[01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:10.850]  It's a fun area.
[01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:12.370]  Oh, super fun.
[01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:15.370]  Super, you know, Ken Kesey vibes, bros.
[01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:17.490]  That's where we used to drive to get vials, you know?
[01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:20.330]  Like when, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:23.090]  When we were in festival days,
[01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:27.370]  Eugene was where you get your vials and get your prints
[01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:31.490]  and you get all your super high grade indoor
[01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:32.730]  in the off season, you know?
[01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.490]  Like springtime, summertime, you know?
[01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.650]  It's like, that's, at least for me, like,
[01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.850]  I know it's around, but Eugene was, it was around,
[01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:42.530]  you know, it was around.
[01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:44.490]  And like, it was fun.
[01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:46.730]  It was really fun, you know, working at a dispensary,
[01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:48.730]  moved my way up to floor manager
[01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:50.530]  just because of my passion and my knowledge.
[01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:53.170]  And I, you know, taught all the bud tenders
[01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.170]  that were there at the time.
[01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:56.690]  I'm sure they got, you know, still great bud tenders.
[01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:58.410]  Amazon Organics is a great spot.
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:00.930]  They have many alkalates, like great products.
[01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:01.770]  It's hard.
[01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:02.850]  Oregon grows fire.
[01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:04.330]  There's, you know.
[01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:05.330]  It does, dude.
[01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.690]  Was this when it was medical
[01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.250]  or when it went like fully wrecked?
[01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.930]  Cause like for a while, dude,
[01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:12.130]  I would go to Oregon to get shit.
[01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:13.410]  Like Washington was whack.
[01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.890]  Washington was, had the lock on concentrates,
[01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:19.970]  but for flour, Oregon was growing the better flour,
[01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:20.810]  in my opinion.
[01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:22.530]  Yeah, cause Oregon, well like, you know, Eugene,
[01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:25.570]  especially everyone has a basement in Eugene.
[01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:27.410]  So it was like, that's just what's up.
[01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:29.290]  And garage.
[01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:32.690]  But when I was younger, it was not legal.
[01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:36.290]  And that was, it was like, you drive up to Eugene,
[01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:38.050]  see a music show, drive back.
[01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:40.410]  You know, you're definitely picking something up,
[01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:41.250]  you know, you know,
[01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.570]  especially there's really smart chemists out there
[01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:46.050]  and there's just some vibes, you know,
[01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:48.650]  like Ken Kesey or sorry, Ken Kesey
[01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:50.010]  and the whole prankster crew, you know,
[01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.650]  like that's their spot.
[01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:55.410]  There's statues of them reading books in the town square.
[01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:58.570]  Like that's prankster Oregon country fair.
[01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:00.010]  Yeah, it looks like, you know,
[01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:01.650]  I got to go to the Oregon country fair
[01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:02.570]  with Josh and Kelly.
[01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:04.010]  It was a magical experience.
[01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:05.530]  Like Oregon was special.
[01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:07.210]  Oregon was super special.
[01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:10.490]  But yeah, so like when it legalized,
[01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:13.210]  I moved from Hawaii to Oregon.
[01:30:13.210 --> 01:30:14.050]  Okay.
[01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:16.210]  I, yeah, I mean, I was running around the whole West coast.
[01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:19.130]  I used to go to the Hemp Fest every year.
[01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:21.810]  From pretty much from Washington to SoCal
[01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:23.690]  was my neck of the woods, you know, like.
[01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:25.090]  Nice, very nice.
[01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:27.610]  That's, I knew a few dudes who,
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:29.450]  yeah, that was just kind of their jam
[01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:32.090]  is they were never really tied down to a location.
[01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.930]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:35.610]  I mean, I had a home base, you know,
[01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:36.730]  I had a home base in Chico.
[01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:38.410]  You always have a home base in College Town.
[01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:40.370]  College Town, there's kids who like to party.
[01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:42.730]  So, yeah, product.
[01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:44.330]  Teaching you guys some game, kids.
[01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:45.770]  Listen up.
[01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:47.490]  If you don't have, in College Towns,
[01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.410]  if you need a home base
[01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:50.330]  and you're moving and grooving, College Towns.
[01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:54.610]  Chico, Santa Cruz, Eugene, San Diego,
[01:30:54.610 --> 01:30:56.290]  Missoula, Montana was epic.
[01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:57.210]  You're like, Montana.
[01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:59.610]  Oh, dude, cause there's nothing else out there.
[01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:00.810]  I spent a summer.
[01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:05.170]  So when Montana, this was back when I was a kid.
[01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:07.610]  When Montana first went medical,
[01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:12.490]  they're like, if you have a medical card in another state,
[01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:15.290]  come ahead, show us how to do it, kind of, you know?
[01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:18.370]  And so like, my buddy went out there and set up a spot
[01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:19.530]  and he's like, yo, I need help.
[01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.450]  And so I was like, I'm on my way, you know?
[01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:23.010]  And I went to Missoula.
[01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.090]  I love Montana.
[01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:27.530]  It's one of the best, most beautiful states I've been to.
[01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:29.450]  Beautiful, beautiful area.
[01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.090]  Montana's beautiful people.
[01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:32.650]  Like, love it.
[01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:34.490]  But yeah, so, you know, you just move and groove
[01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.130]  where the wind takes you when you're younger.
[01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:40.010]  I lived in Eugene once it legalized.
[01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.050]  So I moved there, I think a week
[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.410]  before it technically legalized.
[01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:48.010]  They were just hiring bud tenders
[01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:51.730]  in expectation of overflow, and it was.
[01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:56.450]  I kept up with the flow and I did it before it was legal.
[01:31:56.450 --> 01:32:00.130]  So it was just, I could do it on a street,
[01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.610]  I could do it over a counter with a register
[01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:04.210]  on my backpack.
[01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:05.410]  It's a trip.
[01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:06.450]  It was a trip.
[01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:07.490]  It was cool though.
[01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:08.330]  I loved it.
[01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:10.810]  Like, don't get me wrong, it was fun when you were a kid,
[01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:14.250]  but like, as many times as you may get detained
[01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.210]  or you may or may not have to get people to protect you,
[01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:19.650]  it's like, it's nice being behind the counter.
[01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:22.970]  It's nice being a facility with cameras that's legal.
[01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.090]  You know, it's nice.
[01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:26.290]  It's way less stressful.
[01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:27.770]  Trust me, it's a lot less stressful.
[01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:30.410]  So, you know, worked in a dispensary.
[01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:32.370]  Then, you know, I realized it was more retail.
[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:34.850]  You know, like for me, like my package,
[01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:38.370]  at that time, after living in Hawaii and growing
[01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:40.850]  and being in all these different greenhouses
[01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:42.850]  and popping, you know, like popping seeds,
[01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:44.690]  like that's, you know, you have your clones,
[01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:47.330]  but like pop some seeds, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:50.370]  You know, like just learning and breeding.
[01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:52.490]  You know, they do a lot of breeding out there in Hawaii
[01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:55.290]  just because it's just, I mean, you throw some seeds away,
[01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:58.970]  you got a patch of weed in your compost, you know?
[01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:00.690]  It's like, things just grow.
[01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:01.850]  So it's just really easy.
[01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:03.970]  And, you know, at the time, you know,
[01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.330]  vacant land in Hawaii was relatively inexpensive.
[01:33:10.330 --> 01:33:12.490]  And so, you know, I know some,
[01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:14.450]  there were some people who just had spots
[01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:16.010]  and we could do some gorilla things.
[01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:17.610]  And there was just some cool things.
[01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:19.490]  There's a lot of cool things going on in Hawaii.
[01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:21.410]  If you, you know, put your ear to the pulse.
[01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:22.810]  And I learned a lot.
[01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:25.010]  And so after working behind the counter,
[01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:27.650]  as cool as that was for me and learning that,
[01:33:27.650 --> 01:33:31.090]  like the Eugene Glass scene, going to like the DFO,
[01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.450]  eating Bob's Snodgrass and all that cool stuff.
[01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:35.290]  I've only heard about it, but yeah.
[01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:37.050]  It was fun, like it was fun.
[01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:39.250]  Like, I mean, come on, you really,
[01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.450]  you watch the DFO Netflix documentary, you know,
[01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.730]  the degenerative flame off documentary, you know.
[01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:49.330]  You see all these things and like getting to experience it
[01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:51.330]  in Eugene, it was cool, it was cool.
[01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:54.570]  But I wanted to grow, I wanted to grow weed.
[01:33:54.570 --> 01:33:56.690]  I was, you know, I was growing where I was living.
[01:33:56.690 --> 01:33:58.090]  It was legal now, fuck it.
[01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:00.930]  I was growing and breeding in my backyard immediately.
[01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:05.370]  You know, so just off pure self-reliance, you know,
[01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:09.610]  like self-reliance is, Hawaii taught me self-reliance
[01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:10.930]  and I'm very grateful for that.
[01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:13.130]  And it's a beautiful thing.
[01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:14.890]  I hope everybody finds it, you know.
[01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:16.970]  And I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent self-reliant,
[01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:18.210]  but that's the goal.
[01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:23.210]  So yeah, you know, I had dreads back in the day.
[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.410]  I just, sorry, I just read a comment.
[01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:27.850]  I had dreads back in the day.
[01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.690]  Respect everybody with dreads.
[01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:33.410]  But you know, you don't want,
[01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:35.850]  I realized you don't have to be dread to be Rasta,
[01:34:35.850 --> 01:34:38.090]  but it's divine conception of the heart.
[01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:43.370]  I just, you know, it's just more like respect to everybody.
[01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:44.570]  You know, it just didn't fit me.
[01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:46.410]  You know, like I do me, everybody do you.
[01:34:46.410 --> 01:34:47.730]  Like it's just, you know.
[01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:52.210]  There's a good line that just reminded me of,
[01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:55.690]  I do another show, Dope History,
[01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:59.210]  and we have an interview with OG at Elap
[01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:02.010]  who did the, you know, the church Rastafari.
[01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:04.970]  And somebody was talking about him.
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:06.970]  And, you know, he said he had like,
[01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:09.810]  kind of always felt that in his heart and his whole life.
[01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:12.530]  And someone made a comment about dreads and like, you know,
[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.250]  the old Rasta looked at him and says, you know,
[01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:16.450]  it's not the length of the hair,
[01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:18.490]  it's the depth of the roots.
[01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:20.530]  So I like that.
[01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:21.690]  Yeah.
[01:35:21.690 --> 01:35:22.530]  There's a song.
[01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:23.770]  That's what I just said.
[01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.130]  There's a song by Morgan Heritage.
[01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:26.570]  And it's like, you don't have to dread to be Rasta.
[01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:29.050]  You know, it's like, it is divine conception of the heart.
[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:30.170]  And when you find that,
[01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:31.890]  like whether you want to believe it or not,
[01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:32.730]  you're Rasta, bro.
[01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:33.970]  Like, straight up, straight up.
[01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:37.210]  Like your actions will speak, you know, straight up.
[01:35:37.210 --> 01:35:39.770]  Like, so, and I, it's just, you know,
[01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:41.410]  Selassie has taught me a lot.
[01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:44.530]  Like if you want to read up on that individual,
[01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:45.690]  hopefully you can learn a lot.
[01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:47.770]  I have, you know, like big ups and respect
[01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:48.650]  to the whole culture.
[01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:49.490]  I learned a lot.
[01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:50.330]  I love it.
[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:53.370]  Big ups, real talk, you know.
[01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:54.890]  Research, go read a book.
[01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:59.890]  Yeah, read a, yeah, that's one of my favorite songs.
[01:35:59.890 --> 01:36:01.970]  Me and my wife that like play songs.
[01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:03.850]  It's like, read a book, motherfucker.
[01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:07.090]  Read a book, read a book, motherfucker.
[01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:08.050]  Read a book.
[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:08.890]  Yeah, seriously.
[01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:10.930]  I'm in the other room just reading a book.
[01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:12.810]  But I must read every book.
[01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:13.650]  I like to read.
[01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:15.090]  I geek out, you know, like.
[01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:17.050]  I can go grab a book and show it to you.
[01:36:17.050 --> 01:36:18.850]  It's what I've been geeking out on.
[01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:22.610]  My co-worker is, who went to Louisiana Tech.
[01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.570]  He's a very smart individual with like horticulture.
[01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:28.770]  And he has this book, it has like a breakdown,
[01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:32.490]  a scientific breakdown of every like nutrient element
[01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:34.770]  and its functions and what combats it.
[01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:37.770]  And so I'm just like, damn, this is like, you learn,
[01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:38.810]  you know, go read a book.
[01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:39.810]  You know, it's like, it's cool.
[01:36:39.810 --> 01:36:42.730]  Like, cause experience teaches you, but you, you know,
[01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.610]  like respect it.
[01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:47.570]  Everybody going to college and knowing what they're doing
[01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:48.650]  and not just wasting time.
[01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:50.370]  You know, go read a book, go learn.
[01:36:50.370 --> 01:36:52.050]  Education's beautiful.
[01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:53.810]  You know, knowledge is power.
[01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:54.650]  Real talk.
[01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:56.650]  Knowledge is power, 100%.
[01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:58.970]  And I'm the type of person, like I learned early
[01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:02.290]  and it was actually through my audio education
[01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.850]  that I learned, I'm a visual learner.
[01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:08.770]  Like if you show me and I do it,
[01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:11.170]  it'll take like once, maybe twice.
[01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:14.330]  If I read it, I have to read it three or four times.
[01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:15.170]  And that's okay.
[01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:16.010]  That's fine.
[01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:17.610]  I know that that's just me and that's how I work.
[01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:21.250]  But, you know, you said you had some experience
[01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:23.250]  out there too, being kind of shown.
[01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.650]  And like, one of the questions that I'd written down
[01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:27.850]  that I wanted to ask is, you know,
[01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:30.130]  a lot of this does come from experience,
[01:37:30.130 --> 01:37:32.170]  especially with the regenerative stuff.
[01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:33.850]  You have to anticipate.
[01:37:33.850 --> 01:37:36.090]  You can't be reactionary in any of this.
[01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:38.850]  You have to anticipate and you only learn through time.
[01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:42.850]  So do you have maybe like any advice or any tips
[01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:45.410]  on how people could be observant,
[01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:49.010]  but maybe also save a couple headaches
[01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:51.330]  based from your experience?
[01:37:52.570 --> 01:37:55.930]  Be proactive instead of reactive.
[01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:59.610]  As well as, you know, I'm sure everybody's heard,
[01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:02.450]  keep it simple, but you know, just your shadow's great.
[01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:05.490]  I think farmers who like to hang out in the garden,
[01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:09.370]  you know, and you know, the shadow of the farmer
[01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:10.730]  is the best thing for the plant.
[01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:12.370]  I'm sure that's not the right quote,
[01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:14.010]  but something along that line, you know,
[01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:18.530]  I've worked for many people who don't,
[01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:22.050]  like directors and like master growers or whatever,
[01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:23.810]  who just sit in your office, sit in the office
[01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:27.290]  and they're like, and you're trying to save
[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:29.130]  their fucking grow and they're just like,
[01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:30.330]  oh, I've been doing this for a long time.
[01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:31.450]  It's just, it's all good.
[01:38:31.450 --> 01:38:33.130]  And you're like, what's up?
[01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:34.330]  Does it make cost sense?
[01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:35.930]  Yeah. Is it cost effective?
[01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:37.250]  How much is your crop worth?
[01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.370]  Well, you know, like I've worked also, you know,
[01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:43.370]  like Shane at CanEssentials has taught me a lot.
[01:38:43.730 --> 01:38:46.810]  That guy works harder than almost anybody I've met.
[01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:49.810]  You know, he, I worked for him and he,
[01:38:49.810 --> 01:38:54.530]  he's sunup to sundown farmer, like real respect to you, man.
[01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:56.730]  Like that's what you need.
[01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:58.970]  Like you need to be sunup, sundown.
[01:38:58.970 --> 01:39:01.330]  You need to be there before your kids wake up.
[01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:03.370]  You need to go to bed after you put them to sleep.
[01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:04.930]  You need to, you have to love it.
[01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:06.570]  You know, this has to be your passion.
[01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:07.930]  If you're like, oh, I'm a farmer.
[01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:09.450]  I work for blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:11.370]  And you're like not working
[01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:13.370]  or you're just like on your phone
[01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:14.730]  and everybody else is pruning.
[01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:17.370]  And you're like, what the fuck dude?
[01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:20.730]  Like, come on, like either get out or step in.
[01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:23.730]  You know, I mean, like that's all I can say is tune in.
[01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:26.690]  If you, if you're curious, if you were like,
[01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:27.730]  like, I don't know.
[01:39:27.730 --> 01:39:31.610]  I think I've been around a lot of people who grow weed,
[01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:34.570]  but kind of just follow recipes or like.
[01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:37.530]  You can paint by numbers.
[01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:41.410]  A dying plant, you can still smoke and get high.
[01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:43.450]  You know, like an unhealthy plant,
[01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:44.690]  it's still gonna do its thing.
[01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:47.730]  You know, like, so we're just stewards of this entity,
[01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.530]  this plant entity that's gonna do what it does.
[01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:53.290]  And you can either help it do what it does
[01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:55.930]  or not help it do what it does.
[01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:58.930]  You know, and it's, that's kind of all I gotta say
[01:39:58.930 --> 01:40:01.450]  is like, make sure you're being, you know,
[01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:02.850]  you're treating the plant right.
[01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:03.970]  Like however you're treating it,
[01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:05.290]  but there's just not abusing it.
[01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:07.130]  You know, it's like you can prune
[01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:08.850]  and do all this cool production stuff,
[01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:09.810]  but just making sure, you know,
[01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:11.090]  make sure you're tapping the plant.
[01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:12.930]  And they're like, you're listening to her
[01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:14.730]  and you're like there, you're at least, you're,
[01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:17.530]  you know, show up, you know, be a good parent, show up.
[01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:18.730]  Like that's all I'm saying.
[01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:21.730]  Like, don't just be like, oh, you know, I set my grow,
[01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:23.690]  go back to it next week.
[01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:26.250]  You know, like I know I've worked for a lot of people
[01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.530]  back in the day to where it was just like,
[01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:29.810]  yo, I got this grow over at this house.
[01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:30.810]  We're gonna go check on it.
[01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:32.610]  I haven't been here a while.
[01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:33.610]  Shit might be fucked.
[01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:35.490]  You know, like we might have to clean up a flood.
[01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:36.690]  You know, like, and you're like,
[01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:38.010]  you haven't been here in a while.
[01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:39.410]  And they're like, no, man, I got,
[01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:40.450]  I got too much shit to do.
[01:40:40.450 --> 01:40:42.650]  And you're like, you know, as a worker,
[01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:43.850]  you're like, damn, that's crazy.
[01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:45.810]  But you know, the bigger picture, they got,
[01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:48.010]  oh, you know, it's, it's not legal.
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:49.850]  You know, you got four or five houses
[01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:51.410]  in a few different towns and you're moving
[01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:52.330]  and grooming and doing your thing.
[01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:53.450]  I understand it, man.
[01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:54.530]  I get it.
[01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:55.970]  But now that we're legal
[01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:57.770]  and we don't have to do shit like that,
[01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:59.090]  you know, and it is your passion,
[01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:01.050]  like step up and be involved, you know,
[01:41:01.050 --> 01:41:03.250]  like the plants want to see you,
[01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.810]  your workers want to see you, you know,
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:08.210]  like whatever role you're at, tap in really,
[01:41:08.210 --> 01:41:09.850]  you know, like be present.
[01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:13.090]  Get some dirt under your nails, basically.
[01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:16.290]  You know, you talked to you about, you know,
[01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:18.290]  popping seeds and doing a lot of seeds
[01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:20.010]  and maybe pheno hunting.
[01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:22.730]  And I also know you do some work on your own.
[01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:25.570]  So I want to get to that here in a second too,
[01:41:25.570 --> 01:41:26.530]  the air horn.
[01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:30.930]  But maybe what are some of the things that you've seen
[01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:33.890]  and do you see like different expressions
[01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:37.410]  from the same lines in the different areas you're at?
[01:41:37.410 --> 01:41:39.930]  You know, Hawaii is different than Colorado
[01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:41.770]  is different than Oregon.
[01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:42.970]  I mean, Hawaii,
[01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:48.290]  white widow or the dirty widow is so big in Hawaii.
[01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:51.050]  I mean, it was so popular, you know, like Kona gold.
[01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:54.570]  I had an old timer buddy who just grew Kona gold seeds
[01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.570]  and it was Kona, I mean like, yeah,
[01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:58.890]  some of them were shorter, some of them were taller,
[01:41:58.890 --> 01:42:02.570]  but they were all super like tropical islands to Tito,
[01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:03.570]  super identical.
[01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:07.130]  He grew from seed old timer, like South Kona, you know?
[01:42:07.130 --> 01:42:07.970]  And I was just like,
[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:11.130]  he was like, oh, this is just old Colombian gold seed.
[01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.970]  I've been growing since the eighties, you know,
[01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:15.290]  like it's all the same shit.
[01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:17.570]  And he's just in breeds it and breeds it and breeds it.
[01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:19.210]  And it's all, and it's fine.
[01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:21.850]  You like that type of super tropical sativa.
[01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:23.530]  I want to just put a head spin
[01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:26.570]  and like go for a bike ride or something like that.
[01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:28.770]  I mean, so like, I don't know, that's Hawaii.
[01:42:28.770 --> 01:42:30.450]  And you know, there's lots of,
[01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:32.930]  lots of people breeding and doing stuff in Hawaii now.
[01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:35.730]  So it's hard to really say, but like, from my experience,
[01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:38.010]  that was things that were moving and grooving.
[01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:40.730]  Like sour diesel was big in Hawaii.
[01:42:40.730 --> 01:42:43.410]  White widow was big in Hawaii.
[01:42:43.410 --> 01:42:46.170]  You know, Island Sweet Stump was big in Hawaii.
[01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:48.450]  More sativas than indica base.
[01:42:48.450 --> 01:42:52.410]  I would guess probably just because it's easier to grow
[01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:54.010]  or better to grow.
[01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:55.570]  Everything will grow in Hawaii.
[01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:58.850]  Everything, anything, but you got the humidity,
[01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:01.570]  even in the dry side, like Kona, you got the heat
[01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:04.250]  and it's not as humid as like the Hilo side,
[01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:06.210]  but it's still humid and it's hot.
[01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:10.930]  And so you get mud rot at PM, the temperature fluctuations,
[01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.450]  but sativas in my experience grow a lot better
[01:43:15.450 --> 01:43:19.690]  because of that feathery kind of, not larfy,
[01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:23.410]  but you know, kind of spongy and as opposed to-
[01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:24.250]  Bud structure.
[01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.250]  A broad leaf, you know, a broad leaf type
[01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:29.130]  that's got that just big Coca-Cola bottle
[01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:31.370]  that's gonna just try this out, you know?
[01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:33.850]  Yeah, the sativas do great.
[01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:37.930]  And what's the other, ghost train haze, super lemon haze.
[01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:40.970]  Those were huge in the big island, you know?
[01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:43.330]  Yeah, a lot of ghost train haze, super lemon haze,
[01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:46.370]  sour diesel, white widow, Kona gold.
[01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:50.490]  As I was leaving, Girl Scout cookies, cuts,
[01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.530]  like random cuts.
[01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:52.730]  I don't think they were the real deal,
[01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:55.410]  but they were cookies, you know?
[01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:58.130]  Yeah, so many imposters on that one.
[01:43:58.130 --> 01:43:59.730]  Oregon, Oregon's just fire.
[01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:01.730]  Like they got everything.
[01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:04.450]  When I moved to Eugene, it was legal, everything.
[01:44:04.450 --> 01:44:05.410]  You name it.
[01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:09.210]  I mean, that's when Gorilla Glue was becoming popular.
[01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:11.450]  You know, it was all about the test,
[01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:13.210]  the high testing numbers, all that bullshit.
[01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:14.050]  You know, it's like-
[01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:15.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:16.850]  Eugene was hot everywhere.
[01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:17.890]  And you know, like back in,
[01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:19.690]  like when I was moving and grooving,
[01:44:19.690 --> 01:44:22.210]  it was, you know, things, you know,
[01:44:22.210 --> 01:44:24.690]  herbs, cushes, sours, you know,
[01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:27.050]  I've worked on farms called Diesel Acres.
[01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:28.730]  Big up, Terry, you're the man.
[01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:29.770]  Like, you see this, you know,
[01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:31.330]  like that's just what they grew.
[01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:33.650]  And it was a cut that help me got from New York
[01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:35.770]  that none of the, nobody got.
[01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:37.770]  Like, you know, you trim for somebody,
[01:44:37.770 --> 01:44:39.050]  they're like, yeah, here's some weed.
[01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:42.970]  They're like, nope, this is all getting moved at four.
[01:44:42.970 --> 01:44:45.530]  And they're like, you know,
[01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.170]  they're like, you can pay four for it.
[01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:49.290]  And you're like, no, I'm good.
[01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:52.330]  You know, so it's like, that's how it was.
[01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:53.170]  Like back in, like-
[01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:54.010]  Damn.
[01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:54.850]  And it was-
[01:44:54.850 --> 01:44:55.690]  That, that to me-
[01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:57.090]  Spirock, I worked on Spirock,
[01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:58.930]  respect to everybody out there,
[01:44:58.930 --> 01:44:59.850]  be doing your thing.
[01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:02.730]  I learned a lot, you know, like where else the,
[01:45:04.610 --> 01:45:07.330]  you know, Honeydew crew out there in the coast,
[01:45:07.330 --> 01:45:10.770]  you know, all over Willets, you know,
[01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:12.210]  it was really good time.
[01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:13.050]  Yeah.
[01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:14.730]  And just different types of high grade.
[01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:16.090]  You know, that was back when like,
[01:45:16.090 --> 01:45:17.530]  you could just pop a bunch of seeds
[01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:21.370]  and grow a 20 pound plant and send it, you know, like-
[01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:22.210]  Man.
[01:45:22.210 --> 01:45:24.050]  It all self, go drive down to the bay.
[01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.890]  Right, right.
[01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:26.770]  All the bag is split, you know, it's all good.
[01:45:26.770 --> 01:45:28.490]  You know, it's different now.
[01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:29.490]  It's a lot different now.
[01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:30.890]  People can't, you know,
[01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:33.770]  only people I know who are popping a lot of seeds
[01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:36.330]  are backyard growers or Medi growers.
[01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:37.290]  You know, I don't know.
[01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:38.730]  I mean, I shouldn't say that.
[01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:40.570]  I should, I totally take that back.
[01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:43.930]  It's not commercially viable to have to pheno hunt.
[01:45:43.930 --> 01:45:45.250]  Yeah, it's definitely not,
[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:46.570]  but there are people who are,
[01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:49.210]  and the people who are respect to you.
[01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:51.890]  Thanks for keeping up with the culture.
[01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:54.330]  Pop those seeds, breed those seeds.
[01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:55.170]  Love it.
[01:45:55.170 --> 01:45:57.090]  Like that's what's up, you know.
[01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:59.770]  When I was working for Cannes Essentials,
[01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:02.890]  I was there, they called me their genetic specialist.
[01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:07.010]  When I was there, I don't know what they're doing now.
[01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:08.850]  So I don't want to speak on it.
[01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:13.850]  I left in, I personally left for personal reasons,
[01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:17.690]  just stuff for in 2019.
[01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:21.450]  But we were popping like a thousand beans a season
[01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:22.810]  and pheno hunting.
[01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:25.570]  And I was, you know, right behind Shane,
[01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:28.410]  like out there early morning doing all our garden duties.
[01:46:28.410 --> 01:46:30.130]  But then at the same time,
[01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:32.370]  I'd go and walk out to our pheno hunt
[01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:36.810]  and, you know, have my pen and paper and track everything.
[01:46:36.810 --> 01:46:40.010]  You know, we all know that the smoke is the final test,
[01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:41.290]  but like, you got a whole crop,
[01:46:41.290 --> 01:46:42.690]  let's study these plants, you know,
[01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:45.010]  what's the expression, how are they growing?
[01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:46.170]  How are they propagating?
[01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.650]  Like, go talk to your veg manager,
[01:46:47.650 --> 01:46:49.450]  which what's the percentage on this?
[01:46:49.450 --> 01:46:51.650]  Like what sisters are rooting faster?
[01:46:51.650 --> 01:46:53.650]  What sisters aren't rooting faster?
[01:46:53.650 --> 01:46:56.850]  You know, like what's the bounce back time
[01:46:56.850 --> 01:46:58.250]  after a major prune?
[01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:59.930]  When you're pruning, is it super sticky?
[01:46:59.930 --> 01:47:00.770]  Does it smell?
[01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:02.290]  You know, like you're doing all,
[01:47:02.290 --> 01:47:04.010]  like I was doing all these things personally
[01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:05.170]  with all these seed hunts.
[01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:06.010]  I loved it.
[01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:09.010]  I'm very grateful that like being able to pop all the seeds,
[01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:10.770]  like I've never been able to pop that much.
[01:47:11.290 --> 01:47:13.930]  You know, now I'm only, I don't do that,
[01:47:13.930 --> 01:47:15.490]  but I mean, like when we were in Hawaii,
[01:47:15.490 --> 01:47:16.930]  we weren't popping thousands,
[01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:20.410]  we were, you know, what we could at the time, you know?
[01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:21.530]  But yeah, like Canna Essentials,
[01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:22.690]  they got, they just hunt, you know,
[01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:23.810]  they were just hunting seeds.
[01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:26.290]  We were just hunting seeds, finding heaters.
[01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:27.370]  You know, we were finding heaters
[01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:31.850]  that we couldn't really validate commercial growing
[01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:34.730]  because they were just such small producers,
[01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:38.490]  but man, you pull your wig back like, wow.
[01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.530]  The head stash, they're for the head stash.
[01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:45.250]  Yeah, like straight up, like it's not commercially viable
[01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:49.010]  at all, it's like, and I'm not gonna say any strains at all
[01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:50.050]  because I don't want to talk bad
[01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:51.690]  about any breeder or anybody,
[01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.490]  but like, you know, we popped very,
[01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:57.250]  lots and lots of stuff, you know?
[01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:59.250]  And there's only a few things that they kept,
[01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:03.930]  that we kept, and the reasons being like,
[01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:06.250]  A, is it good, you know?
[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:07.730]  B, is it commercially viable?
[01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:10.050]  You know, like, they, I don't want to speak for them
[01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:10.890]  because I don't work for them,
[01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:13.370]  but like, they're only focused on what's good.
[01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:15.370]  Like, and that's why I love working for them
[01:48:15.370 --> 01:48:17.490]  because it's like, if it ain't good, get it out of here.
[01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:20.370]  Like, and they were always wanting to find new stuff
[01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:22.050]  that is top notch, you know?
[01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:24.650]  And then after it's top notch, is it commercially viable?
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:26.210]  And those are like, you know,
[01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:27.890]  they still probably pump out stuff
[01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:29.570]  that's not really commercially viable,
[01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:31.250]  but if you get your hands on it,
[01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:34.530]  you're like, wow, that's some dank, you know?
[01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:36.490]  Like, I know they're holding on
[01:48:36.490 --> 01:48:38.050]  to a lot of special stuff over there.
[01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:40.490]  So respect to you guys for keeping it up.
[01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:43.930]  I know we've had our ups and downs, but like, keep it up.
[01:48:43.930 --> 01:48:45.770]  Y'all are killing it out there.
[01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:47.770]  And that's a good long play though,
[01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:52.290]  is when you do kind of go with quality first,
[01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:55.410]  because there are a lot of people in it for the short term.
[01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:57.810]  And, you know, it's almost a pump and dump,
[01:48:57.810 --> 01:49:00.090]  build the business to sell the business.
[01:49:00.090 --> 01:49:02.410]  But, you know, the long play,
[01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:06.370]  and keeping that not exclusivity, like, you know,
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:08.090]  well, yeah, to a certain extent,
[01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:10.970]  but when you have something special,
[01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:11.850]  see, that's my whole thing.
[01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:13.850]  And that's why I kind of like looking through things
[01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:16.370]  and I like, you know, playing around with crosses
[01:49:16.370 --> 01:49:19.490]  is it's all about that something special
[01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:22.050]  because there's a lot of great canvas out there these days.
[01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:26.170]  And it's easier than ever before to access the seeds to it.
[01:49:26.170 --> 01:49:29.330]  So if you don't have something that's just like,
[01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:32.490]  I'm gonna drive five miles further too,
[01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:33.970]  then what are you really doing?
[01:49:33.970 --> 01:49:38.730]  So, yeah, those are the things that I kind of look for, but.
[01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:41.170]  Always quality, quality over everything, always,
[01:49:41.170 --> 01:49:43.370]  you know, like always.
[01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:45.170]  Yep, so hopefully, you know,
[01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:47.450]  and if you do find something and it's not, you know,
[01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:50.450]  as we're saying commercially viable, then work with it.
[01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:54.050]  Start playing with something to try to add a little bit
[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:55.210]  of what you want to it.
[01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:57.450]  And I personally like always going back
[01:49:57.450 --> 01:50:01.010]  to some older genetics, just because there's less in them,
[01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:04.330]  makes my job a little bit easier at the time, faster.
[01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:09.450]  I'll bookend that with by no means,
[01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:11.130]  am I like a breeder or an expert
[01:50:11.130 --> 01:50:13.730]  or a very knowledgeable person in the subject?
[01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:15.850]  I'm just on a hunt.
[01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:18.530]  You're shucking seeds, you've bred a plant.
[01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:21.410]  Just because you're not like doing some CRISPR shade
[01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:22.970]  or tapping into every single,
[01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:25.290]  you have millions of dollars to throw down
[01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:28.730]  at like a scientific lab to do some breeding, real talk.
[01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:31.690]  Like, bro, like humans have been breeding plants
[01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:34.290]  and shucking seeds for thousands of years, man.
[01:50:34.290 --> 01:50:35.770]  Give yourself some credit, Chad.
[01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:36.610]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:37.650]  Thank you, man.
[01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:40.050]  And, you know, I'm on a mission and this is something,
[01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:43.170]  you know, back in the medical days when I first,
[01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:46.290]  you know, one of my first like pro clones, as I say,
[01:50:46.290 --> 01:50:49.010]  was a Jax Cleaner II, it was from TGA.
[01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:52.930]  And they were looking for specific characteristics
[01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:53.850]  to help people.
[01:50:53.850 --> 01:50:58.170]  And that being a medical user myself became my mission.
[01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:03.170]  And so, yeah, that's an important aspect to me.
[01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:05.810]  And that's why, you know, that's why I play around
[01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:07.850]  because if I find something that works for me,
[01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:08.690]  it's gonna help others too.
[01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:10.250]  Yeah, and you wanna keep it, right?
[01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:12.210]  And you're like, work with it and see like,
[01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:13.050]  it'll pass on.
[01:51:13.050 --> 01:51:16.450]  Like, see if you can have that effect with that trait
[01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:19.210]  or whatever, you know, like, it's really special.
[01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:21.810]  And like, what may be commercially viable to one person
[01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:23.550]  may not be commercially viable to another.
[01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:25.330]  Like back in the day, like I said,
[01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:28.970]  you had plants that would grow tall as a house, you know,
[01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:33.130]  like you're a triple tier indoor system
[01:51:33.130 --> 01:51:34.930]  that might not be the plant for you.
[01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:36.450]  You know what I mean?
[01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:40.130]  So, you know, commercially viable varies just as much
[01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:41.850]  as the next thing in my opinion.
[01:51:41.850 --> 01:51:43.810]  But you know, we all want something good always,
[01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:44.930]  quality always, you know?
[01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:48.410]  So it's like, we say commercially viable,
[01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:49.610]  but that may be different.
[01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:51.670]  And like, it's just not commercially viable.
[01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:52.610]  I think it's special.
[01:51:52.610 --> 01:51:55.170]  Like you're growing out like pop, like 50, 60,
[01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:57.170]  whatever seeds, like,
[01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:59.930]  and you're the only one that gets to smoke that.
[01:51:59.930 --> 01:52:01.610]  And you get to share with your friends.
[01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:03.730]  And you're like, I did not take any clones of this,
[01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:05.130]  but damn, this is special.
[01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:07.210]  Really special.
[01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:08.890]  It makes it even more special.
[01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:10.050]  And it makes it unique.
[01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:12.650]  And you're like doing your homies and your family
[01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:14.050]  get to try something special
[01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:16.170]  and get to experience something nobody else
[01:52:16.170 --> 01:52:17.010]  gets to experience.
[01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:17.850]  And that's for you.
[01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:20.550]  And that's, you produce, like you grew that product.
[01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:22.930]  And it's, there's nothing like it in the world.
[01:52:22.930 --> 01:52:24.730]  Like there's something special about that.
[01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:28.690]  Like, I think there is, you know, even if like, yeah,
[01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:30.530]  we all want to find something special and keep cuts.
[01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:32.570]  And like, sometimes you might not have room for that,
[01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:33.890]  or that's not your MO,
[01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:36.490]  but like, I want to give respect to the person
[01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:39.290]  who's just popping seeds and smoking the high grade
[01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:41.450]  and giving praise to the goddess plant
[01:52:41.450 --> 01:52:45.010]  and knowing like whatever it's called,
[01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:46.910]  as long as it's good to my nose
[01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:48.890]  and effective in my mind and body,
[01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:50.930]  like that's what we're all looking for, you know?
[01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.530]  And it might, every plant's kind of different
[01:52:52.530 --> 01:52:53.450]  for everybody, you know?
[01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:55.530]  Like, and at different times of the day.
[01:52:55.530 --> 01:52:58.170]  So it's all.
[01:52:58.170 --> 01:53:01.330]  Yeah. At the end of the day, the name is secondary.
[01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:03.690]  And I get asked that question sometimes
[01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:04.930]  when people are talking about like,
[01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:06.930]  well, do you think these seeds are legit?
[01:53:06.930 --> 01:53:09.430]  Or, you know, do you think this is real?
[01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:11.270]  And that's usually an answer I go with,
[01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.090]  because, you know, I've had
[01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:15.450]  from different seed banks overseas, I'm like,
[01:53:15.450 --> 01:53:17.730]  I know this isn't what they're saying it is,
[01:53:17.730 --> 01:53:19.250]  but whether it's good or not,
[01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:21.650]  that's what's going to make me happy at the end of the day.
[01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.650]  And there's one, God, it's actually, it's right here.
[01:53:27.130 --> 01:53:32.130]  Cannabisia was the company.
[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:34.470]  And I'm not calling them out.
[01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:35.690]  Damn, it doesn't have the strand on here,
[01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:39.890]  but it was something like Gorilla Glue, something, whatever.
[01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:42.770]  It absolutely was not a Gorilla Glue,
[01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:47.170]  but it was the most like amazing Sherbert-like tasting.
[01:53:47.170 --> 01:53:49.190]  It was one of those ones I didn't clone
[01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:51.710]  because I didn't think of it.
[01:53:51.710 --> 01:53:52.910]  And it turned out just to be
[01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:56.950]  just like the most magical tasting plant, like, fuck.
[01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:59.510]  Yeah, so like, yeah, we've had those, you know,
[01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:03.270]  like to where like, even like while it's growing,
[01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:05.670]  you're like, eh, eh.
[01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:10.390]  Like, you're pretty, definitely not what I was expecting.
[01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:12.390]  But then you harvest it and you smoke it
[01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:15.670]  and you're like, damn, I'm sorry I just chewed.
[01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:18.470]  Like, you just, you got me ripped.
[01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:20.150]  Yeah.
[01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:22.110]  Sorry, like, damn, you know?
[01:54:22.110 --> 01:54:23.030]  So I mean, that happens.
[01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:24.510]  And that's what I think is special.
[01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:26.030]  It's like, you know,
[01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:28.350]  reminds you don't judge a book by its cover, you know?
[01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:32.310]  Like, don't judge a plant by its look.
[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:33.470]  Bag of peel ain't shit.
[01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:35.030]  Like.
[01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:37.150]  Yeah, by, you know, where you're,
[01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:38.870]  oh God, you were saying earlier, you know,
[01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:40.510]  nobody like, Rick turns it down.
[01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:42.950]  There was a, I remember one time I was going
[01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:46.030]  to buy something larger than I had bought at that time.
[01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:48.030]  So I kind of, you know, was maybe thinking
[01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:50.390]  I was a little bit of a boss at the moment.
[01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:53.230]  And they, you know, gave me a little bit to like smoke.
[01:54:53.230 --> 01:54:57.230]  And I looked at it and I like took my money off the table.
[01:54:57.230 --> 01:54:59.910]  I'm like, hell no.
[01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:02.550]  And they're just like, smoke it, bro.
[01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:06.470]  And I was fucking so ripped at the end of that.
[01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:08.150]  My money went back on the table.
[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:09.670]  And I learned that lesson to the day.
[01:55:09.670 --> 01:55:12.630]  I still see that bud sitting on the table
[01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:13.790]  when they throw it to me.
[01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:15.430]  I'm like, no.
[01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:17.950]  That's honestly like no disrespect.
[01:55:18.710 --> 01:55:20.750]  But I just learned, and it's like,
[01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:23.310]  you get this bag, you know, and you're like,
[01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:26.190]  thanks, you know.
[01:55:27.190 --> 01:55:30.070]  And then you go roll up and you're like paranoid.
[01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:31.410]  Like you're in high school and you're like,
[01:55:31.410 --> 01:55:32.590]  what the fuck was that?
[01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:34.990]  Like blown away, you know?
[01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:37.390]  So it's like some of that old school stuff
[01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:40.190]  that looks like shit is quality, you know,
[01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:42.470]  really top-notch stuff and special.
[01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:44.230]  And maybe that's why it messes you up
[01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:45.910]  because you're not, we're not used to that
[01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:47.110]  as a smoking culture,
[01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:49.030]  because it's just kind of all in my way.
[01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:50.290]  Speaking of that,
[01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:53.510]  shout out to like anybody growing and breeding sativas.
[01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:54.630]  Like I grew some
[01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:59.010]  diesel cartels, Kembargo,
[01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:00.490]  a bunch of this stuff.
[01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:04.970]  Man, shout out, J-Tree family that like, dude,
[01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:07.470]  quality, Kembargo, all is like,
[01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:09.030]  is NL5 Hayes crosses.
[01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.850]  That's what it was.
[01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:11.630]  Like all is NL5 Hayes crosses,
[01:56:11.630 --> 01:56:14.310]  you know, took like 100, 110 days,
[01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:18.090]  but it was definitely some like psychedelic,
[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:21.990]  strong, strong wheat, you know, very strong wheat.
[01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:24.350]  And like, I honestly wasn't expecting that.
[01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:27.110]  It was just for being just,
[01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:30.830]  I personally had never grown many Hayes's or,
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:32.830]  I've grown ghost train Hayes,
[01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:34.950]  but I don't really consider that true Hayes.
[01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:37.110]  But you know, like I haven't grown anything
[01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:39.810]  a hundred plus days I should have said since,
[01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:42.750]  like I've grown a Cambodian that I harvested in January,
[01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:43.710]  but like, you know,
[01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.510]  that's a long time to grow something indoors, you know?
[01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:48.590]  And it just pulled me back.
[01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:52.830]  I was like, this is strong green weed, like.
[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:53.910]  Green weed.
[01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:58.270]  Yeah, me too.
[01:56:58.270 --> 01:57:00.110]  Being the indoor person
[01:57:00.110 --> 01:57:02.110]  on the Western side of the mountains here,
[01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:03.830]  I don't really have an outdoor season,
[01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:05.990]  let alone one that would last that long.
[01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:07.230]  I love smoking them again.
[01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:10.110]  That's another thing when I go to Amsterdam that we love,
[01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:12.870]  like we want the White Widow and we want the Hayes's,
[01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:15.410]  which are the cheapest things on the menu, oddly,
[01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:16.750]  because they're tired of it.
[01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:18.910]  They're the most expensive thing on the menu
[01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:21.070]  is gelato and cookies and ruts.
[01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:26.070]  Like ridiculous prices, like 20 plus per gram for that shit.
[01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:28.950]  And I bet it doesn't need, I've never even seen it,
[01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:30.430]  so I'm not even gonna ask.
[01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:31.710]  I'm like, no.
[01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.830]  That's funny.
[01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:35.430]  And you're like, I'll suck up all that Hayes,
[01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:36.270]  give it to me.
[01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:37.110]  Yep, yep.
[01:57:37.110 --> 01:57:39.230]  The Hayes, the White Widow and the bubble gums,
[01:57:39.230 --> 01:57:42.070]  like those are, the favorite that I've had there
[01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:44.430]  was a Big Buddha's blue cheese.
[01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:47.750]  Like that, I would love to find.
[01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:48.590]  But-
[01:57:48.590 --> 01:57:53.590]  I think the Big Buddha cheese crossed to a diesel
[01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:57.390]  is this thing called chisel.
[01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:59.670]  And then, woo!
[01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:02.950]  I used to, I would get that very randomly in Tahoe
[01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:06.030]  from a buddy and that was potent.
[01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:08.070]  That was really, really potent.
[01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:11.030]  I think that's JJ Top Dog Seeds.
[01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:14.150]  I don't know if Days from the Garden is still watching,
[01:58:14.150 --> 01:58:14.990]  but he'd let me know.
[01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:16.550]  He'll let me know if that is.
[01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:19.790]  He's a big Top Dog fan, but Top Dog makes some strong stuff.
[01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:21.310]  Top Dog's legit, yeah, for sure.
[01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:24.590]  Like my buddy just grew out a bunch of his back cross,
[01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:25.910]  sour diesel back crosses
[01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:28.710]  and did a big open pollination of them.
[01:58:28.710 --> 01:58:30.270]  Where, you know, like diesel's hot, you know?
[01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:32.470]  Like I'm about to run two different diesel cuts
[01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:34.310]  that I've had throughout, you know,
[01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:36.270]  some friends through the years.
[01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:37.990]  I'm excited, grew up two different diesels.
[01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:41.110]  Side by side, see how, see what it looks like.
[01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:43.470]  Cause I've definitely grown and harvested
[01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:45.190]  and smoked a lot of diesel.
[01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:48.870]  Well, you should get a feel for, you know,
[01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:51.150]  what it's gonna be, what it's gonna grow like.
[01:58:51.150 --> 01:58:54.510]  And again, that's the thing, I haven't grown it for,
[01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:56.150]  or haven't been around it growing.
[01:58:56.150 --> 01:58:58.190]  I mean, Pan Essentials had a cut.
[01:58:58.190 --> 01:59:00.390]  It was just different than what I was used to,
[01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:01.950]  but it's still a great cut.
[01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:05.750]  And yeah, you know how it is.
[01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:07.550]  It's just like, it's not the same.
[01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:12.190]  And there's, I mean, there's, you know, a lot of,
[01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:15.470]  we love talking, you know, like breeding and, you know,
[01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:18.710]  phenotypes and like ecosystem expressions
[01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:21.110]  and just all these different things.
[01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:22.750]  And I mean, it is real.
[01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:26.430]  So there is variation from the same cut.
[01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:31.430]  And anybody who's had that magic, like plant
[01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:34.710]  and then lost it, but still had a whole bunch of seeds
[01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:38.750]  and tried to find it again, you'll get 99% of the way there
[01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:41.630]  but I have never gotten a hundred percent of the way back
[01:59:41.630 --> 01:59:42.870]  to the one that I lost.
[01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:47.310]  Yeah, but homie, yeah, Days From the Garden, the J trees.
[01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:50.710]  Yeah, that crew, yeah, Skunk Tech, fire.
[01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:52.430]  J trees, fire, J trees.
[01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:54.350]  Oh yeah, okay, I see.
[01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:56.430]  Legit, super legit.
[01:59:56.430 --> 02:00:01.430]  Yeah, I grew up, I got a bunch of the High Screen 27,
[02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:05.150]  the horchata release that Skunk Tech did.
[02:00:05.150 --> 02:00:08.790]  Yeah, we're talking about passion earlier
[02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:12.670]  and like how that just like, you know, motivates you
[02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:14.910]  and like inspires you and you wanna see,
[02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:18.190]  you wanna give like an old or a younger generation
[02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:20.390]  your knowledge because it took you this long
[02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:21.430]  to accumulate it.
[02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:24.950]  And if they can start from where you're leaving off,
[02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:27.350]  they're gonna be teaching you, you know,
[02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:29.670]  because those people with those passion
[02:00:29.670 --> 02:00:32.790]  and to throw it up there, you know, Days From the Garden,
[02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:36.230]  he's one of those people we met, I don't know, a year ago,
[02:00:36.230 --> 02:00:38.750]  a couple of years ago, just online, way younger,
[02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:40.670]  almost half my age.
[02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:43.910]  Cool, I almost called him a kid, that'd be disrespectful.
[02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:46.550]  No, no offense, no disrespect there.
[02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:51.910]  Super passionate about just like collecting plants
[02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:54.790]  and collecting some of these things that were like important
[02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:57.990]  to me like in the nineties and he knows the breeders
[02:00:58.030 --> 02:01:00.190]  and he goes and like, we'll meet these people
[02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:03.750]  and like kind of try to get cuts and like do all this shit
[02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:06.910]  I wish I had time for, but yeah.
[02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:10.710]  I can relate, like respect man, like I watch your shows.
[02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:18.590]  Real talk man, like I'm the same way I got to meet J Trees.
[02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:22.870]  So there's a story, check this out, real talk.
[02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:26.670]  I used to buy the sour apple and the chisel
[02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:28.150]  from this cat in Taub.
[02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:31.830]  He used to work instructor at Squaw,
[02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:33.870]  I was a lift off supervisor at Squaw.
[02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:37.270]  This is the vibe, everybody's got high grade, you know,
[02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:40.590]  so I used to pick up from him, he'd pick up from me,
[02:01:40.590 --> 02:01:43.790]  vibes, vibes, you know, but sour apple,
[02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:46.870]  which was I believe a pineapple sour diesel cross.
[02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:49.550]  And then it was fucking amazing.
[02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:53.670]  And then the chisel, which was the cheese diesel cross.
[02:01:53.670 --> 02:01:57.430]  So very hard to pick up, small batch,
[02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:59.710]  you know, blah, blah, blah, loved it.
[02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:06.270]  Years pass, I ended up at the 2017 Emerald Cup.
[02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:09.590]  Who's behind me?
[02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:15.470]  The creator of chisel and sour apple, homie J Trees,
[02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:21.310]  his crew just smoking a J and they handed it to me
[02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:23.070]  and it was fucking strong.
[02:02:24.630 --> 02:02:27.310]  Homies, puffs, tough, respect, like,
[02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:29.390]  I was like, what's this?
[02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:30.310]  This shit smells like-
[02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:32.470]  That's your daily driver?
[02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:34.230]  And he's like, oh yeah, that's some chisel.
[02:02:34.230 --> 02:02:35.710]  I was like, chisel?
[02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:38.910]  Like, like, like cheese, sour diesel?
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:40.110]  He's like, yeah, you heard of it before?
[02:02:40.110 --> 02:02:42.430]  I was like, yeah, man, I used to pick this up
[02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:43.990]  from a cat in Tahoe.
[02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:45.310]  And he goes, what was his name?
[02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:47.910]  And I told him his name and he goes, what?
[02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:49.510]  No, he's like, I agree with that.
[02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:50.910]  I was like, what?
[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:53.750]  Well, we were smoking a joint,
[02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:55.670]  I think we were at the Bodie seed, yeah,
[02:02:55.670 --> 02:02:57.030]  the web, bro, the web.
[02:02:58.710 --> 02:03:01.070]  We were in the seed line, the Bodie seed line
[02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:05.310]  and we were just bullshit, like exchange vibes,
[02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:07.270]  like he gave me a bunch of seeds
[02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:12.270]  and we ended up linking up, I think last year again
[02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:16.550]  and just, he's a good dude, he's a really good dude.
[02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:19.230]  And when you're tapped in and you hear the pulse
[02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:22.270]  and you start proving, things happen.
[02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:27.070]  So like, yeah, I got the, I have his chem diesel OG,
[02:03:27.070 --> 02:03:29.870]  which is extremely potent, I love it.
[02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:34.870]  It's like OG, but with like a chemi influence, really nice.
[02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:37.830]  Yeah, so that one's special for sure.
[02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:40.550]  Thank you, J Trees, that one's really nice.
[02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:44.950]  I've grown his apple blacks.
[02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:48.630]  That was one of the most unique turps I've ever had.
[02:03:49.150 --> 02:03:54.150]  It was like Tootsie Roll, berry, chocolate.
[02:03:55.710 --> 02:03:58.830]  It was just so exotic and it was like purple,
[02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:00.550]  it was like black purple.
[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:04.830]  Yeah, the Diesel Cartel, J Trees, that crew is awesome.
[02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:06.950]  Skunk Tech, I'm growing, I just grew out a bunch
[02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:09.430]  of his stuff, I'm gonna be growing out again.
[02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:13.750]  It's just good stuff, I like people that do good work.
[02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:16.670]  They obviously put in good work, they show their work.
[02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:21.630]  They're hunters and it's always good to check them out.
[02:04:23.230 --> 02:04:26.830]  I put a bunch of air horn pollen on all that stuff.
[02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:29.790]  I was doing an open pollination of my air horn
[02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:32.710]  and I just threw all the cuts that I had out, which.
[02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:37.830]  Yeah, let's see here, I actually got that pulled up
[02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:40.310]  on the, I pulled that up here on the other screen.
[02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:41.150]  Let's see here.
[02:04:41.150 --> 02:04:42.870]  Yeah, I'm not releasing everything just
[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:47.910]  because for whatever reason, but the things I'm releasing
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:51.510]  are things that I'm excited for.
[02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:56.230]  Yeah, so that, yeah, Cam Diesel OG from J Trees,
[02:04:56.230 --> 02:04:58.910]  he's top notch.
[02:04:58.910 --> 02:05:02.790]  That GMO root beer, I believe that's Mean Gene.
[02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:05.190]  I know, I think J Trees had a Bowman.
[02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:07.110]  I really, I don't wanna speak on that too much,
[02:05:07.110 --> 02:05:08.890]  I don't know, but that's really unique.
[02:05:08.890 --> 02:05:13.890]  That GMO root beer has got like this onion Thai food smell.
[02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.850]  I don't know.
[02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:19.570]  Okay, it's a weird smell, but when you smell it,
[02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:20.390]  you know it.
[02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:21.410]  I haven't smelled that one,
[02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:23.210]  but there's some weird smells in Cambodia.
[02:05:23.210 --> 02:05:27.930]  I've only smelled it smells like animal fries
[02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:28.810]  from In-N-Out.
[02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:31.290]  And I'm like, oh yeah, I can kind of see that.
[02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:33.010]  I can kind of see that.
[02:05:33.010 --> 02:05:36.010]  I don't eat In-N-Out, so I don't relate to that,
[02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:38.770]  but I do eat a lot of like spicy Thai food and stuff.
[02:05:39.650 --> 02:05:42.570]  And it's got like this greasy Thai food onion thing
[02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:43.390]  going on.
[02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:44.750]  That was really nice.
[02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:48.050]  Really stony, really, the high is just really nice
[02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:49.650]  on that one.
[02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:54.130]  The Mean Mug is the, I suck,
[02:05:54.130 --> 02:05:57.590]  I think that's Mean Gene or Skunk Tech or a collab of them.
[02:05:57.590 --> 02:05:59.490]  I'm not a hundred percent on that, but.
[02:05:59.490 --> 02:06:01.650]  I know they've been collabing lately.
[02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:03.050]  Yeah.
[02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:06.250]  I just know my buddy bought, I think a couple of packs
[02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:07.090]  of those.
[02:06:07.090 --> 02:06:08.650]  Went really fast, but he's a,
[02:06:08.650 --> 02:06:10.290]  Yes, anything.
[02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:11.810]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:13.850]  He does this thing up in NorCal
[02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:15.810]  and still in the old school market.
[02:06:15.810 --> 02:06:17.850]  And he picked up those because those are,
[02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:20.690]  that's what brokers are asking for is root beer,
[02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:22.210]  soda turps.
[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:23.610]  So he picked up a bunch of those,
[02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:25.330]  did a big open pollination of those.
[02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:27.130]  And he gave me a few of the cuts
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:31.850]  and one was a really tall one, stretchy,
[02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:36.810]  really had these really trippy red leaf expressions.
[02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:41.090]  And then another one was really stout and short and veg,
[02:06:41.090 --> 02:06:43.650]  but then ended up really shooting up tall and flower
[02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:46.730]  and having like, actually I have some right here,
[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:50.930]  having like a dark expression that had more of like a cream,
[02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:52.770]  like a vanilla cream soda.
[02:06:54.170 --> 02:06:55.250]  Oh, let's see here.
[02:06:59.530 --> 02:07:00.890]  I know you're doing the right trick.
[02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:01.970]  You got the hand back there.
[02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:04.890]  I'm far from a master at getting those.
[02:07:04.890 --> 02:07:06.210]  That looks good though.
[02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:08.410]  That's actually, that's like,
[02:07:08.410 --> 02:07:11.450]  I do my breeding outdoors in my greenhouses
[02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:14.610]  and situations where I'm not gonna piss anybody off.
[02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:16.930]  Hey, take, thank you.
[02:07:16.930 --> 02:07:19.490]  I'm so, you know, that's one thing that comes up
[02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:20.930]  in conversation, sorry to interject here,
[02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:23.770]  but there's a lot of times I'm in conversation with people
[02:07:23.770 --> 02:07:25.850]  and they'd be like, yeah, so I live in this neighborhood
[02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:27.370]  and I've been working on these projects.
[02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:29.570]  And, you know, so I've been flinging pollen
[02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:33.250]  and I'm just like, oh, I'm just, I mean, they do great work
[02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:34.650]  so I can't really complain too much,
[02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:36.210]  but I'm just like, in my head, I'm just like,
[02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:38.050]  oh, your neighbors.
[02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:40.610]  I feel bad for anybody that grows near you, man.
[02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:41.810]  Well, now we're good.
[02:07:41.810 --> 02:07:42.850]  Now we're all good.
[02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:46.650]  Yeah, those little green greenhouses are nice, you know,
[02:07:46.650 --> 02:07:48.650]  if you're doing breeding work as well as like
[02:07:48.650 --> 02:07:53.090]  having an indoor area to keep males a little secluded
[02:07:53.090 --> 02:07:55.130]  for when you do wanna select, you know,
[02:07:55.130 --> 02:07:58.810]  or like you do wanna actually let that pollen fly.
[02:07:58.810 --> 02:08:01.830]  Everybody's got their own methods, you know.
[02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:04.410]  I'll get into that if you want to,
[02:08:05.170 --> 02:08:06.890]  but the mean mugs were nice.
[02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:10.370]  So one had like, kind of like the GMO root beer,
[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:15.130]  just like a weird kind of greasy onion kind of muskiness.
[02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:18.090]  And then the other one had like a vanilla cream soda,
[02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:22.090]  really interesting, not root beer, but like soda,
[02:08:22.090 --> 02:08:25.130]  like vanilla cream soda, it was really impressive.
[02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:27.330]  The GDP, that was a selection I did
[02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:30.050]  in fact with CanEssentials.
[02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:33.730]  And they, that was from an original,
[02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:36.250]  I wanna say they did two, we did two packs that year,
[02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:41.250]  but an original Kansas State, CanEss's GDP pack,
[02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:44.130]  like the seed pack.
[02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:45.930]  So it wasn't like a clone only,
[02:08:45.930 --> 02:08:50.170]  but through my research and talking to the breeder
[02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:54.170]  for Ken at that time, he said it was a GDP female clone
[02:08:54.170 --> 02:08:57.730]  only cross to a GDP male bag seed.
[02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:02.730]  So we selected that GDP for what I personally remember
[02:09:03.970 --> 02:09:08.970]  as GDP, sweet lavender turps that just put you down,
[02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:10.130]  you know, like make you hungry
[02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:12.010]  and make you wanna fall asleep.
[02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:13.690]  That's what that cut does in my opinion.
[02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:15.250]  Like I love that cut.
[02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:16.930]  It's true medicine.
[02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:18.690]  It's like for the people who can't sleep,
[02:09:18.690 --> 02:09:20.290]  for the people who have problem eating,
[02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:21.930]  smoke some granddaddy purple
[02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:23.970]  and I don't have a problem with it.
[02:09:23.970 --> 02:09:26.450]  Like I've always had a problem sleeping
[02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:28.250]  and the GDP works great.
[02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:29.890]  And I'm like, I'll try it again.
[02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:30.730]  I mean, it's-
[02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:32.250]  It's personal for my wife, the GDP.
[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:34.890]  That's why I look for things with it.
[02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:37.730]  It's all right.
[02:09:37.730 --> 02:09:38.570]  It's all super-
[02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:40.010]  Still good flour though.
[02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:43.050]  Yeah, I posted some of my story the other day.
[02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:45.450]  I'll post more, but yeah, it's just frost.
[02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:47.690]  You know, GDP is just a frost monster.
[02:09:48.690 --> 02:09:52.330]  The Sour 91 pie was kind of,
[02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:54.610]  I think it's popular here in Colorado.
[02:09:54.610 --> 02:09:57.770]  I got it from a friend who got it from a company
[02:09:57.810 --> 02:10:01.410]  called Clone with a K out of Colorado.
[02:10:01.410 --> 02:10:06.410]  I have no idea other than it's like the JJ Top Dogs
[02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:09.850]  Sour 91 crossed to a cherry pie.
[02:10:09.850 --> 02:10:11.250]  I don't know who did it.
[02:10:11.250 --> 02:10:12.610]  I don't know where it comes from
[02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:15.250]  other than the Clone company in Colorado,
[02:10:15.250 --> 02:10:16.450]  but that's just fire.
[02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:20.050]  Like that is a cold, knock you out weed,
[02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:21.610]  like the head thumper.
[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:23.810]  So I, you know, I got that from a cut
[02:10:23.810 --> 02:10:25.330]  or I got that cut from a friend
[02:10:25.330 --> 02:10:26.690]  as soon as I kind of moved here.
[02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:30.330]  I moved to Colorado like six or seven months ago.
[02:10:30.330 --> 02:10:34.010]  And that, yeah, that's been a thumper for me.
[02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.850]  I like that.
[02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:36.090]  So I didn't keep the cut
[02:10:36.090 --> 02:10:38.450]  cause I know my buddy still has it.
[02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:41.010]  And I just bred with it
[02:10:41.010 --> 02:10:42.690]  cause I'm looking forward to see what's in there.
[02:10:42.690 --> 02:10:47.610]  You know, sour, fire, chem, fire, you know, like cherry pie.
[02:10:47.610 --> 02:10:49.970]  Yeah, you play it with fire.
[02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:53.370]  And it was a cross with the air horn, right?
[02:10:53.370 --> 02:10:55.050]  Is this the air horn?
[02:10:55.050 --> 02:10:56.010]  Yeah, that's the air horn.
[02:10:56.770 --> 02:11:00.570]  I created that a couple of years ago with,
[02:11:00.570 --> 02:11:05.570]  so Bodhi's ass, the American skunk selection.
[02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:07.010]  Yeah.
[02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.850]  Bodhi's ass.
[02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:09.610]  Yeah, Bodhi's ass.
[02:11:09.610 --> 02:11:12.890]  It's a, it was his cut that his selection
[02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:14.530]  that I got from Radio Ridge,
[02:11:14.530 --> 02:11:17.210]  big ups and respect to the Radio Ridge crew.
[02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:20.490]  Y'all are amazing at what you do, you know.
[02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:25.930]  Yeah, so I got that ass from Radio Ridge,
[02:11:27.570 --> 02:11:31.850]  unbelievably stinky, like stinky, just stinky.
[02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:32.970]  You know, it was really potent.
[02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:34.050]  In a foul way?
[02:11:34.050 --> 02:11:35.250]  Yeah, foul way.
[02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:37.210]  Not smelling like roses?
[02:11:37.210 --> 02:11:39.810]  No, it was, when it wasn't really,
[02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:43.330]  it wasn't skunky, but it was stinky.
[02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:47.330]  Like foul, stinky, stinky, stinky.
[02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:48.930]  Like it was skunky.
[02:11:48.930 --> 02:11:49.890]  It wasn't roadkill.
[02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:52.570]  I'm not gonna say that, but it was like skunk,
[02:11:52.570 --> 02:11:53.770]  you know, it was stinky.
[02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:57.930]  And so that was crossed to a male
[02:11:57.930 --> 02:12:01.850]  that I actually selected while I was with,
[02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:04.930]  when we were doing one of those big thousand seed hunts.
[02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:07.450]  It's a Dominion Seed Company.
[02:12:07.450 --> 02:12:09.570]  It was a gift that I got from him
[02:12:11.170 --> 02:12:13.530]  at the 2017 Emerald Cup.
[02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:16.530]  I just, I bought a bunch of packs with his release
[02:12:16.530 --> 02:12:18.890]  and he just kicked out a bunch of stuff.
[02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:21.650]  And I always pop the freebies first for whatever reason.
[02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:25.210]  I'm like, hey, these aren't as available.
[02:12:25.210 --> 02:12:27.090]  They might be more unique.
[02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:27.930]  Let's see what's up.
[02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:29.970]  Like, so yeah, I popped the freebies
[02:12:29.970 --> 02:12:33.330]  before I popped the packs that I still have
[02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:35.290]  burning a hole in my stash.
[02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:37.450]  But yeah.
[02:12:37.450 --> 02:12:38.450]  Those are hot packs though, man.
[02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:40.530]  The old Dominion Seed Code, Duke Diamond stuff.
[02:12:40.530 --> 02:12:41.970]  Those are hot packs.
[02:12:41.970 --> 02:12:45.130]  And those are usually heavy hitters too, in my experience.
[02:12:45.130 --> 02:12:46.970]  Like they'll pack a bunch.
[02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:47.810]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:12:48.330 --> 02:12:50.650]  He's doing respect, respect Duke.
[02:12:50.650 --> 02:12:53.610]  You know what's up, like big ups to the man.
[02:12:53.610 --> 02:12:55.530]  It was really nice meeting you and chatting you up.
[02:12:55.530 --> 02:12:58.050]  I bullshitted with him at the Indel Expo a few times
[02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:00.930]  and Emerald Cup, really cool cat.
[02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:04.730]  But yeah, so that's Skush is a Master Kush
[02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:07.650]  cross to his basic skunk male.
[02:13:07.650 --> 02:13:12.650]  And it's the male that stood out in a thousand seed hunt.
[02:13:13.130 --> 02:13:16.570]  Like I think we had a 400-ish males
[02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:19.090]  and that male was sturdy.
[02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:21.130]  I like to take cuts of all my males.
[02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:24.690]  I mean, I make sure that it's gonna veg.
[02:13:24.690 --> 02:13:25.930]  Like I want a male to veg.
[02:13:25.930 --> 02:13:28.890]  I don't want any auto flower tendencies.
[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:31.450]  So I want to make sure that it propagates.
[02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:35.010]  I want to make sure that it's a healthy plant, you know?
[02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:37.690]  So like if a male's not really cloning well
[02:13:37.690 --> 02:13:40.610]  or triggers into flower and veg, I don't want it.
[02:13:40.610 --> 02:13:42.410]  So I cull all of those.
[02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:44.450]  So like when I'm hunting males, I'll cull all the,
[02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:48.530]  take clones, cull all the ones that are just weak,
[02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:50.770]  starting to fucking trigger all those stuff.
[02:13:50.770 --> 02:13:52.290]  And then you have all those, you know?
[02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.890]  And then you start your other selections.
[02:13:53.890 --> 02:13:57.690]  Like I was talking about, you know, like how does it grow?
[02:13:57.690 --> 02:13:59.250]  You know, prune it up.
[02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:01.210]  How's it bounce back from pruning?
[02:14:01.210 --> 02:14:02.330]  How resilient is it?
[02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:04.410]  You know, is it super sticky and stinky?
[02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:06.010]  You know, I'm not talking about stem rubs,
[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:07.170]  the only thing that matters,
[02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:10.250]  but it's definitely like almost every plant
[02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:13.210]  that I know is super really fire,
[02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:15.530]  is sticky when I'm trimming it in veg.
[02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:18.090]  When I'm pruning up a mall and it's in veg
[02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:21.130]  and it's just like, this is in veg and my hands are sticky,
[02:14:21.130 --> 02:14:22.530]  like it's gonna be good.
[02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:24.650]  So if you have a male that's doing,
[02:14:24.650 --> 02:14:27.050]  like tap into your males, like get in there
[02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.930]  and see what's up.
[02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:31.050]  I'm not saying it's gotta be like, oh, this is skunk,
[02:14:31.050 --> 02:14:34.250]  you know, but does it have a smell?
[02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:36.010]  Does it have volatile in there?
[02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:37.330]  Does it, is it sticky?
[02:14:37.330 --> 02:14:39.370]  Does it have certain traits that you want to pass on
[02:14:39.370 --> 02:14:40.210]  to the progeny?
[02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:41.770]  Like there's certain criteria.
[02:14:41.770 --> 02:14:43.650]  Everybody's criteria is gonna be different.
[02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:46.290]  Obviously we talked about earlier, quality is king.
[02:14:46.290 --> 02:14:49.490]  So qualities, but like, we're not really smoking males.
[02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:51.530]  I'll be honest, I don't smoke my males,
[02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:54.410]  but I do hunt them.
[02:14:54.410 --> 02:14:58.650]  I have my own hunting process, you know,
[02:14:58.650 --> 02:15:02.050]  check the roots when they're vegging, you know,
[02:15:02.050 --> 02:15:03.490]  when they're about to flip, check those roots.
[02:15:03.490 --> 02:15:04.370]  How vigorous are they?
[02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:06.550]  There's a lot to do, you know, like,
[02:15:08.210 --> 02:15:10.010]  lots to ways to check the males.
[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:11.850]  And there's just stuff that I do.
[02:15:11.850 --> 02:15:16.850]  And I also don't like, like males that pop too early
[02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:19.090]  cause you want them, you want seeds, right?
[02:15:19.090 --> 02:15:20.050]  You want plenty of seeds.
[02:15:20.050 --> 02:15:22.290]  So like, I'll bring a male out
[02:15:24.130 --> 02:15:27.250]  at a certain time of the flowering, you know.
[02:15:28.770 --> 02:15:30.810]  Give the girls a headstart or.
[02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:31.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:31.650 --> 02:15:33.770]  Big headstart, you know, a couple of weeks headstart
[02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:36.210]  so they can get some seed production.
[02:15:36.210 --> 02:15:38.010]  And, but then I'll, you know,
[02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:39.850]  I'll collect little bits of pollen
[02:15:40.690 --> 02:15:44.250]  from the males that I find worthy.
[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.250]  And I'll go dust them on top of things
[02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:50.310]  that I want to see what's up.
[02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:52.570]  And I started breeding for self-reliance.
[02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:56.090]  Like I just, I'm a collector.
[02:15:56.090 --> 02:15:57.730]  I got a bucket full of seeds
[02:15:57.730 --> 02:16:00.050]  and I will continue buying seeds.
[02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:02.170]  Don't tell my wife, you know.
[02:16:02.170 --> 02:16:06.050]  And yeah, it's like, it's my passion.
[02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.890]  I love it.
[02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:08.210]  I'm going to keep breeding.
[02:16:08.210 --> 02:16:10.330]  This is my first public release, but like
[02:16:11.290 --> 02:16:14.210]  when I was with that farm up in Oregon, Ken Essentials,
[02:16:14.210 --> 02:16:16.610]  you know, we popped a bunch of seeds that I made
[02:16:16.610 --> 02:16:18.290]  and we selected something.
[02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:19.130]  A Mist Funk.
[02:16:19.130 --> 02:16:22.930]  Like if you've ever had Mist Funk in Oregon from that crew,
[02:16:22.930 --> 02:16:24.730]  that's something that I created.
[02:16:24.730 --> 02:16:25.570]  Nice.
[02:16:25.570 --> 02:16:26.410]  It's really potent.
[02:16:26.410 --> 02:16:27.810]  I still have it in my veg tent.
[02:16:27.810 --> 02:16:32.290]  It's a really, really slow veg, really slow veg.
[02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:33.970]  Like if you've grown Bubble Kush
[02:16:33.970 --> 02:16:36.410]  or a Blerkle and you think that's slow,
[02:16:37.850 --> 02:16:39.450]  be prepared.
[02:16:39.450 --> 02:16:41.890]  Mist Funk is slow, like really slow.
[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:43.930]  But my buddies have hashed her
[02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:46.850]  and they got a 5.6 hash return,
[02:16:46.850 --> 02:16:48.690]  which I know isn't the best, but it doesn't suck.
[02:16:48.690 --> 02:16:49.690]  So she's a good hasher.
[02:16:49.690 --> 02:16:51.370]  She's great medicine.
[02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:52.330]  I love her.
[02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:54.770]  You know, so I'm stoked with my work.
[02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:56.850]  You know, I'm definitely compared, you know,
[02:16:56.850 --> 02:16:58.090]  I don't only pop my seeds.
[02:16:58.090 --> 02:16:59.090]  I pop a lot of seeds.
[02:16:59.090 --> 02:17:00.610]  This is a passion.
[02:17:00.610 --> 02:17:04.170]  And I've popped seeds that I've paid a lot of money for
[02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:06.130]  that I haven't been stoked on, you know.
[02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:07.810]  And not to say that's all the time,
[02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:10.330]  but you know, like it's always a gamble
[02:17:10.330 --> 02:17:12.090]  for seeds you've been given
[02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:14.410]  or seeds you paid $200 for.
[02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:15.250]  It's a gamble.
[02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:16.690]  It's always a gamble.
[02:17:16.690 --> 02:17:17.890]  You never know what you're in for.
[02:17:17.890 --> 02:17:19.370]  I didn't know I was a gambling man
[02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:22.210]  until I started popping seeds, you know.
[02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:25.090]  Well, you know, a lot of people at like the, you know,
[02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:27.210]  the home and the hobby level, they can do that.
[02:17:27.210 --> 02:17:31.890]  Cause again, it's, you don't have to do monocropping
[02:17:31.890 --> 02:17:32.730]  in those sense.
[02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:34.770]  And you are, you're kind of looking for the unicorns.
[02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:35.930]  You know, I enjoy that.
[02:17:36.690 --> 02:17:37.530]  I like doing that.
[02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:39.890]  And I do a show called seed collectors here
[02:17:39.890 --> 02:17:41.010]  on the channel as well.
[02:17:41.010 --> 02:17:43.250]  And I watch it, big fan.
[02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:45.010]  Hey, thank you, man.
[02:17:45.010 --> 02:17:47.370]  We were the, we're the last time we were talking about,
[02:17:47.370 --> 02:17:49.650]  you know, some breeders that, you know,
[02:17:49.650 --> 02:17:51.410]  people might not have heard of.
[02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:55.250]  And it's awesome that we're able to, as a community,
[02:17:55.250 --> 02:17:58.650]  like make those connections and find some fire from,
[02:17:58.650 --> 02:17:59.970]  you know, someone who doesn't have
[02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:02.930]  a hundred thousand Instagram followers, which is awesome.
[02:18:02.930 --> 02:18:04.570]  And I encourage that.
[02:18:04.810 --> 02:18:06.170]  Are there anybody, you know,
[02:18:06.170 --> 02:18:08.490]  that maybe kind of comes to your mind
[02:18:08.490 --> 02:18:11.890]  that you've mentioned already or haven't mentioned?
[02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:15.370]  Cause I love turning people on to new fire, man.
[02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:18.170]  People who impress me and who I've seen,
[02:18:18.170 --> 02:18:21.490]  who I've seen their work stand out, you know, real talk.
[02:18:21.490 --> 02:18:25.210]  And somebody who may not get a lot of attention
[02:18:25.210 --> 02:18:27.970]  is a gentleman with the Instagram handle,
[02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:30.650]  Mr. Spliff of Cannabis.
[02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:33.150]  He's a Washington individual, I believe.
[02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:37.070]  I popped some seeds while we were with,
[02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:40.950]  I was with Cannes Essentials and damn near every girl
[02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:42.430]  that came out of there was a keeper.
[02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:45.610]  Like they're still running stuff from him.
[02:18:45.610 --> 02:18:48.750]  I don't know if they call, I don't know if he named it.
[02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:50.550]  He was just like, it was like a gift, you know,
[02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:52.350]  it was a gift of a gift of a gift
[02:18:52.350 --> 02:18:54.270]  that ended up in our hands and we pop it.
[02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:55.950]  And I was like, yo, who are you, bro?
[02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:57.870]  Like, this is fucking amazing.
[02:18:57.870 --> 02:19:00.510]  Like Mr. Spliff of Cannabis.
[02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:02.710]  And I also got to kick it with him
[02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:05.870]  at the Oregon Country Fair one year.
[02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.230]  He's a really good gentleman.
[02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:09.110]  Him and his wife are great crew.
[02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:11.070]  I don't think they get enough attention.
[02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:14.590]  I know he's just a person who loves the plant,
[02:19:14.590 --> 02:19:15.870]  does his own breeding things.
[02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:20.330]  And what I've popped from him was very impressive.
[02:19:21.350 --> 02:19:24.990]  Let's see, you know, Duke, Duke's, no,
[02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:26.230]  I'll always shout out Duke.
[02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:28.550]  I know everybody does, he's got amazing work.
[02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:32.270]  What I've popped from him, even his freebies are amazing.
[02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:34.270]  Even the things that he's just,
[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:36.390]  he even was like, yeah, I'm not too stoked on this.
[02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:39.070]  I'm like, that's fire, I found fire.
[02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:42.430]  So another thing he gave me is called the Blissful Wizard
[02:19:42.430 --> 02:19:45.190]  across his, I think, Basic Skunk again.
[02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:47.670]  And he's just like, yeah, it's like a Blissful Wizard,
[02:19:47.670 --> 02:19:51.670]  I think is a cookie cross that got some reputation
[02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:55.070]  for being a high tester, a high THC tester.
[02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:57.350]  I don't know much about it,
[02:19:57.350 --> 02:20:01.110]  but what we hunted was one of the skunkiest plants
[02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:05.270]  I've ever smelled and it knocks you down.
[02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:06.950]  But, you know, it's not super viable.
[02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:09.350]  It's not a good clone, it doesn't clone well.
[02:20:09.350 --> 02:20:11.830]  You know, it's not the best commercial plant,
[02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:14.070]  but you keep around and throw it in the corner
[02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:16.710]  and you've got a head stash to show off for your crew.
[02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:19.150]  And everybody I've ever smoked that with is like,
[02:20:19.150 --> 02:20:20.190]  what the, what's that?
[02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:21.750]  That's strong, you know?
[02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:23.590]  So yeah, Duke's always got good work.
[02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:25.350]  Bodhi, man, respect to Bodhi.
[02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:28.110]  That guy's a legend in the breeding game, in my opinion.
[02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:29.630]  That guy's put a lot of good work out.
[02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:31.350]  Popped some good things for him.
[02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:34.510]  I got a lot of his stuff in my little stash, seed stash.
[02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:38.990]  You know, J Trees, you know, popped some seeds from him.
[02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:41.030]  Lots of good stuff, you know.
[02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:42.830]  Canna Essentials grows some great stuff.
[02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:45.590]  The Furious, no, no, what's it?
[02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:52.510]  Man, it's the Freddie Jackson, I believe it's called.
[02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:57.390]  Royal Kush crossed to his sour diesel.
[02:20:57.430 --> 02:20:58.990]  It was just amazing.
[02:20:58.990 --> 02:21:03.430]  Amazing, like floral rose propane turps, you know.
[02:21:03.430 --> 02:21:04.750]  It was like, so good.
[02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:06.670]  Signed me up, yeah.
[02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:08.550]  And potent, you know, really good.
[02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:10.070]  And so yeah, everything I've popped
[02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:12.830]  from the J Trees crew is great, you know.
[02:21:14.670 --> 02:21:17.030]  Man, who else, who else, who else?
[02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:19.270]  You mentioned Bodhi,
[02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:22.670]  and then you were talking Eugene earlier.
[02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:26.750]  And for many years I had confused Bodhi and Green Bodhi,
[02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.950]  just kind of in conversation.
[02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:31.390]  But Green Bodhi was from Eugene, or still is.
[02:21:31.390 --> 02:21:34.110]  In the medical scene, he was like,
[02:21:35.230 --> 02:21:37.950]  when I was in Eugene, I'd smoke stuff
[02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:41.350]  that came from his crew, and it was top notch.
[02:21:41.350 --> 02:21:44.790]  Like some of that stuff came from the dispensaries
[02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:46.030]  I was working at.
[02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.710]  It was definitely on my radar.
[02:21:47.710 --> 02:21:49.750]  Like it was, yeah, Green Bodhi's,
[02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:51.670]  I've never popped any of his seeds.
[02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:56.670]  I do have some Bodhi, Green Bodhi collabs.
[02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:58.510]  Okay, that's cool.
[02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:59.950]  I don't even know if they're released.
[02:21:59.950 --> 02:22:03.990]  I got those from a friend of Bodhi's that I just was lucky.
[02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:05.750]  You know, when you're in the scene, I love seed.
[02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:09.590]  I collect, people know me, they collect, I get seeds.
[02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:12.070]  I got seeds from an old head when I was in,
[02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:13.790]  when I was living in Southern California
[02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:16.070]  through the COVID time.
[02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:19.510]  My mother-in-law, because she was in a wheelchair,
[02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:21.670]  and her caregiver just kind of was like,
[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:24.670]  peace, I'm collecting unemployment, I don't have to work.
[02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:26.790]  And so me and my wife came down
[02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:28.350]  right after working for Cannes Essentials
[02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:31.590]  and helped her out during the whole COVID fiasco.
[02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:34.030]  And, you know, I'm getting where I fit in,
[02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:36.790]  and I found my crew, my cannabis vibe,
[02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:40.710]  and met this cat that's been growing indoor
[02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:43.310]  in Southern California with his dad for a long time.
[02:22:43.310 --> 02:22:45.510]  And he kicked down some skunk seeds,
[02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:48.150]  some original skunk lung seeds.
[02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:50.790]  Like, so I technically, I think they're like F2s,
[02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:52.910]  and then he gave me some F4s.
[02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:55.150]  They've just been inbreeding,
[02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:57.270]  just popping and selling skunk.
[02:22:57.270 --> 02:23:00.590]  And it's definitely loud, and it's definitely skunky.
[02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:04.750]  I think that emphasis, roadkill turps,
[02:23:04.750 --> 02:23:07.630]  that air horn has a lot of skunk in it,
[02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:09.230]  but it's not roadkill.
[02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:11.910]  It's just skunk, it smells like fresh,
[02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:13.510]  more fresh skunk spray.
[02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:15.870]  Yep, yep.
[02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:16.910]  More-
[02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:18.790]  Dingy, but not roadkill.
[02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:20.350]  Not that dead accurate.
[02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:21.590]  Yeah.
[02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:23.830]  And when I was younger, up at Diesel Acres,
[02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:26.950]  respect here, you know what's up, Casey Jones.
[02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:28.950]  If you grew the Casey Jones that was floating
[02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:33.350]  around NorCal, that smelled like rotten meat, like dead.
[02:23:34.430 --> 02:23:35.670]  Never grew it myself.
[02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:37.150]  Trainwreck sour diesel.
[02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:41.350]  It smelled loud, like it smelled like dead.
[02:23:41.350 --> 02:23:44.430]  And so, it wasn't like that.
[02:23:46.470 --> 02:23:50.070]  It was more, air horn has a skunky,
[02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:55.470]  I pop a lot, a lot for a backyard, I should say.
[02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:58.630]  I don't wanna say, I mean, 80, 90 seeds.
[02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:01.710]  More than a 10-pack.
[02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:06.710]  Yeah, I literally took my hand in my bag of air horn seeds,
[02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:09.750]  threw them in a cup of water,
[02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:12.070]  and started selecting, really.
[02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:17.870]  But mostly what's in there is just OG and skunk.
[02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:21.110]  There's a little bit of grape.
[02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:25.350]  I'm guessing it might be an NL5 influence
[02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:29.510]  from Duke's basic skunk.
[02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:31.990]  And please, Duke, no disrespect,
[02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:33.830]  please correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:37.030]  I think that basic skunk is an NL5 skunk.
[02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:42.030]  So, that's that NL5 skunk master kush crossed to the ass.
[02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:47.550]  So, it's just mostly skunk and kush, really.
[02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:51.190]  You do get these, so some of those purple ones
[02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:55.630]  that pop up are just like a fruity grape,
[02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:57.430]  fruity berry grape, and they're good.
[02:24:57.430 --> 02:24:58.710]  They're good, it's just,
[02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:00.270]  it's not what I'm going for in the line.
[02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:02.030]  So, I did a big open pollination,
[02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:04.430]  selected three different males
[02:25:04.430 --> 02:25:06.390]  that stood out to me immensely,
[02:25:06.390 --> 02:25:09.070]  like obvious standouts for my criteria,
[02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:14.070]  and opened those to a bunch of different females.
[02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:18.710]  And I'm gonna open up the ones on the females that,
[02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:23.390]  so I took like the 72 and the 27,
[02:25:23.390 --> 02:25:25.310]  which I thought that was pretty funny.
[02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:28.310]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[02:25:28.310 --> 02:25:29.310]  Bookends, yeah.
[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:34.310]  Okay, so yeah, I'm gonna be running those out next.
[02:25:34.310 --> 02:25:39.070]  And yeah, the Airhorn and Sour,
[02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:41.070]  yeah, so the Airhorn and Sour Diesel
[02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:43.910]  and Chem Diesel OG is what I'm running out next.
[02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:47.790]  And my indoor tent, so I do like a big outdoor selection
[02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:50.310]  and find what's like just standing out to me,
[02:25:50.310 --> 02:25:52.470]  you know, smoke it, like,
[02:25:52.470 --> 02:25:56.070]  and then because I took all those clones in the summertime,
[02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:59.230]  I just kill all the moms that aren't special.
[02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:02.390]  And I have everything in seed form for the Airhorn,
[02:26:02.390 --> 02:26:04.030]  so I, you know, open pollination,
[02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:05.590]  you get a lot of good stuff,
[02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.270]  in my opinion, my selections,
[02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:10.430]  but I'm gonna open up the ones that stand out to me
[02:26:10.430 --> 02:26:12.510]  from the keeper cuts that I like.
[02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:15.670]  So I'm just gonna keep hunting through the Airhorn,
[02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:16.790]  definitely gonna pop open,
[02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:18.630]  like a lot of the things that I made,
[02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:23.230]  you know, like that GDP Airhorn,
[02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:24.830]  a lot of people have been buying that one
[02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:27.630]  and that's the one I have my eye on too.
[02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:31.270]  And I'm not gonna be releasing a bunch,
[02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:33.390]  I think I'm, you know, just,
[02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:34.630]  cause I breed for me, you know,
[02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:36.790]  I breed for myself, I breed for my son,
[02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:39.390]  I have a son, I'm about to have another child
[02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:40.870]  and I wanna get-
[02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:41.710]  Congratulations.
[02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:42.910]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:45.510]  I wanna give them things that I was never given,
[02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:46.350]  you know, like,
[02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:49.190]  if they're not passionate with it,
[02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:50.590]  oh well, you know, like,
[02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:53.590]  but I would love to be able for them to
[02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:55.990]  be able to experience that, you know?
[02:26:57.470 --> 02:27:00.510]  Absolutely, man, that's the right,
[02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:03.670]  it's the right goal and I think you'll find a way
[02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:07.350]  because I think inside that, you know,
[02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:11.150]  it's not material things that necessarily make that
[02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:12.590]  and they're great, but you know,
[02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:16.150]  there's a lot of time and expression
[02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:18.910]  and knowledge and wisdom that can be passed on
[02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:20.470]  that is more enriching.
[02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:23.470]  I mean, like my parents,
[02:27:23.470 --> 02:27:24.870]  just because I didn't grow weed,
[02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:27.270]  like doesn't mean they didn't teach me work ethic,
[02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:29.590]  they didn't teach me everything you need to know
[02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:30.510]  how to grow weed, you know,
[02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:33.230]  you need to know how to get up off your ass
[02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:35.310]  and work hard, you have to know,
[02:27:35.310 --> 02:27:37.030]  like putting work if you're tired,
[02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:38.190]  you have to know like,
[02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:40.670]  it's not all fun and games,
[02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:42.030]  you gotta put in work,
[02:27:42.030 --> 02:27:43.190]  but you know, after you put in work,
[02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:44.230]  you got some fun, you know,
[02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:45.950]  and that's just, I love my parents
[02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:46.790]  because they were hard on me
[02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:48.230]  and like, you know, like I said,
[02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:49.390]  I grew up kind of wild,
[02:27:49.390 --> 02:27:51.390]  but they instilled in me respect,
[02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:54.190]  respect your elders, work hard,
[02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:56.390]  you know, like that'll take you far in life,
[02:27:56.390 --> 02:28:01.150]  and like, any industry, anything you're doing,
[02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:02.670]  love what you're doing, work hard,
[02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:03.950]  don't half ass shit, you know,
[02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:07.590]  like don't listen to people bullshit
[02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:08.750]  and negative talk you, you know,
[02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:10.590]  like that's-
[02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:12.510]  Don't sell yourself short.
[02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:14.550]  Yeah, exactly, have faith in yourself,
[02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:15.830]  you know, like I'm my biggest,
[02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:17.070]  I'm my own biggest critic,
[02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:18.870]  you know, there's things that I've made
[02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:19.990]  that I don't wanna release
[02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:21.830]  because of, you know,
[02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:23.150]  I don't wanna hear about, you know,
[02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.990]  like I have things-
[02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:25.710]  Same.
[02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:27.390]  But there's things to where I'm like,
[02:28:27.390 --> 02:28:29.710]  I'm like, I'm proud of these,
[02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:31.110]  I know these are gonna be bangers,
[02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:35.270]  and this is what I offer to the public.
[02:28:36.270 --> 02:28:37.110]  It's that-
[02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:39.390]  With my purchase, I got freebie,
[02:28:39.390 --> 02:28:41.230]  I got freebie packs with everything
[02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:42.230]  you want in their support,
[02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:43.430]  you know, I'm about to have a kid,
[02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:45.470]  so, you know, bring on a support.
[02:28:45.470 --> 02:28:47.150]  I mean, a second kid, you know how that is,
[02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:49.270]  but yeah, you know,
[02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:51.550]  I hook up a free pack if you wanna support me,
[02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:54.990]  I got stickers, I got things that aren't available
[02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:56.710]  that I think you might be stoked with,
[02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:59.030]  you know, like that pie scream,
[02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:00.270]  I crossed the air horn,
[02:29:00.270 --> 02:29:02.390]  not gonna release that,
[02:29:02.390 --> 02:29:05.190]  the pie scream is not a big yielder for me,
[02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:07.430]  and I didn't get a lot of seeds off that,
[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:10.190]  so I want to hunt for those,
[02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:15.190]  and I might throw in one of those as a freebie
[02:29:15.310 --> 02:29:16.150]  from time to time,
[02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:17.350]  I know, you know, like,
[02:29:17.350 --> 02:29:21.110]  I also grew out a bunch of Magic Melon,
[02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:23.150]  that's actually kind of what I'm smoking on now,
[02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.990]  it's really nice,
[02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:26.750]  because it's like, it's effective,
[02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:28.630]  but it's not too potent,
[02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:29.950]  it doesn't confuse me,
[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:33.390]  it doesn't like, I'm not all like spaced out,
[02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:34.670]  you know, it's really,
[02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:37.070]  it's, my wife and I call it,
[02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:38.190]  it's pedestrian, you know,
[02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:39.230]  it's like, it's effective,
[02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:41.710]  but it's good, you know,
[02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:42.910]  it was great, I'll be honest,
[02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:44.150]  like respect to that guy,
[02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:45.830]  I think it's Humboldt Seed Company,
[02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:47.030]  the Magic Melon,
[02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:48.710]  it tastes like melon,
[02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:50.110]  like it tastes like,
[02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.950]  can't help it.
[02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:51.790]  They have great tastes, yes.
[02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:53.150]  I love you too, you know,
[02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:54.630]  it's really impressive,
[02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:56.310]  and so this was like,
[02:29:56.310 --> 02:29:58.110]  I was working at an indoor facility
[02:29:58.110 --> 02:30:02.430]  that was growing rooms of Magic Melon,
[02:30:02.470 --> 02:30:03.310]  and I was like, you know,
[02:30:03.310 --> 02:30:04.870]  a couple hundred cuts of Magic Melon,
[02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:07.390]  and they were just overfeeding nitrogen,
[02:30:07.390 --> 02:30:08.630]  and it hermed out, you know,
[02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:10.070]  a couple plants turned out,
[02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:11.070]  and some of the trimmers
[02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:13.990]  literally had like a bag of seeds in me,
[02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.830]  and they knew me,
[02:30:14.830 --> 02:30:15.670]  and they're like,
[02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:17.670]  here Alex, here's a bunch of Magic Melon seeds.
[02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:20.150]  And I'm like,
[02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:23.310]  well, these are a bunch of fucking herming bag seeds,
[02:30:23.310 --> 02:30:24.150]  and then, you know,
[02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:26.550]  that's always gonna be my initial reaction,
[02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:27.390]  but you know, like,
[02:30:27.390 --> 02:30:28.230]  I think about it,
[02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:30.310]  and I'm like, the herb was pretty good,
[02:30:30.310 --> 02:30:32.310]  and it was a very fast finisher,
[02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:34.990]  like there were 8 weeks on the dock,
[02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.830]  and it was finished,
[02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:36.670]  it was good,
[02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:38.790]  and it was unique,
[02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:43.030]  it had like a really nice cantaloupe melon gas
[02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:44.110]  kind of thing going on,
[02:30:44.110 --> 02:30:45.990]  it was really, it was unique.
[02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.910]  They've selected,
[02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:49.270]  they've put a lot of time into the selecting,
[02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:50.110]  and that finishing,
[02:30:50.110 --> 02:30:52.350]  that blueberry muffin from them,
[02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:55.150]  will finish in like 45 days.
[02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.990]  What?
[02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.830]  That's like, yeah,
[02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:58.110]  that's mind blowing,
[02:30:58.110 --> 02:30:59.950]  especially to like an indoor person
[02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:01.270]  who tries to run perpetual,
[02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:02.710]  you're like, you know,
[02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:04.710]  you can almost sneak in another harvest.
[02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:05.630]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:07.350]  See, the industry needs more of that,
[02:31:07.350 --> 02:31:08.550]  you know, like,
[02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:09.390]  like I said,
[02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:10.230]  it wasn't the most potent,
[02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:11.990]  but like, my mom smokes,
[02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.910]  and she can't, you know,
[02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:15.190]  like not everybody can hang with the Ken dogs,
[02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:16.350]  and Southern easels,
[02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:18.310]  and you know, everybody needs a,
[02:31:18.310 --> 02:31:19.870]  I think everybody should puff on herb,
[02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:22.190]  I know not everybody feels that way,
[02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:23.790]  but I feel like there's a little bit of something
[02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:24.630]  for everybody,
[02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:25.590]  you know, whether you're eating it,
[02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:26.750]  smoking it, drinking it,
[02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:28.510]  like consume,
[02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:30.190]  you know, it's a good thing,
[02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:32.990]  but yeah.
[02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.830]  It, you know,
[02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:34.670]  it can help mental,
[02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:35.510]  and you know,
[02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:37.270]  I like to kind of puff throughout the day,
[02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:38.430]  and just kind of like smoke,
[02:31:38.430 --> 02:31:39.630]  so sometimes, yeah,
[02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:43.350]  I'm not looking for the knock you downs right away.
[02:31:43.350 --> 02:31:44.550]  I like something that may have
[02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:46.190]  a little bit of flavor to it,
[02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:48.030]  so you can go throughout the day,
[02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.990]  and you know,
[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:50.150]  it varies for me,
[02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:51.030]  I go up and down,
[02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:52.230]  I used to, you know,
[02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:53.750]  say I'm either ahead of the times,
[02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:54.590]  or behind,
[02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:55.430]  I'm behind the times,
[02:31:55.430 --> 02:31:56.950]  because when like OG,
[02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:59.390]  and Kush were super popular,
[02:31:59.390 --> 02:32:01.110]  I always try to go for something different,
[02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:02.750]  so I was really into the fruity stuff,
[02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:03.750]  and I was playing with that,
[02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:04.590]  and I was looking at that,
[02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:05.430]  and again,
[02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:07.910]  that's partly due to TGA,
[02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:09.910]  and their influence on me.
[02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:12.230]  Yeah, I popped a lot of TGA.
[02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:13.070]  So it's like,
[02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:15.470]  I felt I was kind of ahead of it at that time,
[02:32:15.470 --> 02:32:17.550]  but then as that rose to popularity,
[02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:18.390]  I'm like,
[02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:19.230]  you know,
[02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:20.070]  these OG,
[02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.910]  these Kush's aren't that bad.
[02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:21.750]  And see,
[02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:22.590]  that's the thing,
[02:32:22.590 --> 02:32:23.790]  like I was always after them,
[02:32:23.790 --> 02:32:24.630]  you know,
[02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:26.150]  those were like,
[02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:27.390]  the cuts of the Kush,
[02:32:27.390 --> 02:32:28.550]  and the cuts of the Cam,
[02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:29.630]  and the cuts of the Sour,
[02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:30.790]  were back in the day,
[02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:31.630]  hella hard to get,
[02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:32.470]  I'll be honest.
[02:32:32.470 --> 02:32:33.310]  You know,
[02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:34.150]  they might be hard to get now,
[02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:36.470]  just maybe a little bit more tapped in,
[02:32:36.470 --> 02:32:37.310]  or whatever,
[02:32:37.310 --> 02:32:38.590]  but like you said,
[02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:40.470]  I feel like if you're tapped in,
[02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:43.510]  you can pretty much find almost anything these days,
[02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:45.030]  if you really want to,
[02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.870]  in my opinion,
[02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:49.630]  I feel like everything that I've really hunted for,
[02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:50.470]  or wanted,
[02:32:50.470 --> 02:32:51.310]  I've been able to get,
[02:32:51.310 --> 02:32:52.150]  you know,
[02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.990]  it's,
[02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.830]  I'm grateful,
[02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:54.670]  you know,
[02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:55.510]  I'm,
[02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:56.350]  yeah,
[02:32:56.350 --> 02:32:57.190]  it's,
[02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:58.030]  yeah.
[02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:59.630]  I'm grateful for the plants that you remember too,
[02:32:59.630 --> 02:33:00.590]  cause there's a lot of,
[02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:01.430]  dude,
[02:33:01.430 --> 02:33:03.070]  there's a lot of Cam 91s out there,
[02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:03.910]  trust me,
[02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:04.830]  I've tried many of them,
[02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:05.870]  and they're not,
[02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:06.710]  you know,
[02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:08.030]  they're not what's in that damn jar,
[02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:09.470]  that I've only got about,
[02:33:09.470 --> 02:33:10.310]  oh,
[02:33:10.310 --> 02:33:11.150]  a hundred left.
[02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:12.590]  I love this Cam Diesel OG man,
[02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:14.630]  it's like J-Tree's got it down,
[02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:15.550]  like he is,
[02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:16.390]  so that,
[02:33:16.390 --> 02:33:18.070]  I believe from what he told me,
[02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:20.150]  it's a Cam 91,
[02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:21.710]  Sour Diesel,
[02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:23.790]  crossed to Josh DOG.
[02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:24.950]  So it's got,
[02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:25.790]  you know,
[02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:26.630]  some of my favorite stuff,
[02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:27.470]  you know.
[02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.830]  It's,
[02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:30.670]  it doesn't much have a sour note to it,
[02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:32.510]  it definitely stretches like a sour,
[02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:34.110]  but it's more to me,
[02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.950]  OG Cam,
[02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:35.790]  like it's,
[02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:36.630]  which is great,
[02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:37.750]  like I love it,
[02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:39.070]  it's really powerful,
[02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:40.230]  it's a great high,
[02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:42.270]  I'm excited to pop into those seeds,
[02:33:42.270 --> 02:33:43.710]  and see what the Air Horn,
[02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:45.790]  Cam Diesel OGs find.
[02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:46.630]  I'm just,
[02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:48.670]  I'm just guessing good OG types,
[02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:49.510]  you know,
[02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:51.150]  I'm excited to see what's in there.
[02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.990]  Yeah,
[02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.830]  there's a company,
[02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:53.750]  cause I've had,
[02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:54.950]  I won't name the breeder,
[02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:55.950]  cause they're,
[02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:58.110]  they do great work,
[02:33:58.110 --> 02:34:00.150]  a lot of amazing strains,
[02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:02.070]  but I've got an OG Cam from them,
[02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:03.030]  and it hermed on me,
[02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:05.110]  like not even a questionable Cam,
[02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.950]  and I'm like,
[02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:06.790]  oh,
[02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:07.750]  that's a Herm,
[02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:09.590]  a couple of them,
[02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:12.590]  but there is one company in Washington,
[02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:14.590]  Fat Panda,
[02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:15.790]  who has an OG Cam,
[02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:17.310]  which I really liked,
[02:34:17.310 --> 02:34:18.670]  but I want to bring them up too,
[02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:20.470]  cause they have this strain,
[02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:23.110]  that is on my like bucket list to find,
[02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:24.350]  and I think they named it themselves,
[02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:26.510]  but it's called Hawaiian Golden Pineapple,
[02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:29.070]  but basically it's across a Puna Butter,
[02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:31.030]  and the Golden Pineapple.
[02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.870]  Nice,
[02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:32.710]  yeah,
[02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:33.550]  that sounds fire.
[02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:34.390]  It's,
[02:34:34.390 --> 02:34:35.230]  dude,
[02:34:35.230 --> 02:34:36.070]  that's,
[02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.910]  that's again,
[02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:37.750]  that's another one that I will buy a rack,
[02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:39.790]  it's been probably over a year since I bought it,
[02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:41.710]  but I don't see it that often,
[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:44.230]  cause I don't go to the store I used to work at,
[02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:48.550]  but I've had the Golden Pineapple many times,
[02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:51.750]  and it's not what makes that strain a stand out to me,
[02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:53.590]  so I've assumed this whole time,
[02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:55.350]  that it's been the Puna Butter,
[02:34:55.350 --> 02:34:56.190]  yeah,
[02:34:56.190 --> 02:34:58.070]  the THC's version of Puna Butter,
[02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.910]  oh,
[02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:59.750]  okay,
[02:34:59.750 --> 02:35:00.590]  all right,
[02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:01.430]  cool,
[02:35:01.430 --> 02:35:02.270]  I still can't find it,
[02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:03.110]  it's this old one,
[02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:05.430]  I feel like I got to try it,
[02:35:05.430 --> 02:35:07.910]  when I was on Hawaii,
[02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:09.670]  but they didn't call it Puna Butter,
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:11.190]  they just called it the Butter,
[02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:13.150]  like they just called it the Butter,
[02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:15.190]  and so I was like the Butter,
[02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:16.910]  and I got to smoke it with some heads,
[02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:19.070]  that were over on the Hilo side,
[02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.990]  and it was really good,
[02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:21.990]  it was like very potent,
[02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:24.590]  but I've never seen it grow,
[02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:26.430]  I've never really worked with it.
[02:35:26.430 --> 02:35:27.270]  Yeah,
[02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:29.750]  cause there is a preservation company,
[02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:32.830]  guy or person in Hawaii,
[02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:35.110]  and they have a Puna Butter,
[02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:37.510]  but I haven't gone that route,
[02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:39.270]  cause they're kind of pricey,
[02:35:39.270 --> 02:35:40.110]  but again,
[02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:40.950]  I'm like,
[02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:43.270]  I'm pretty sure it was the THC's one,
[02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:44.390]  that they made it with,
[02:35:44.390 --> 02:35:45.230]  so.
[02:35:46.310 --> 02:35:47.150]  That's the thing,
[02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:49.110]  those different varieties and their sisters,
[02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.950]  you know,
[02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:50.790]  it's always,
[02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:51.670]  it's always the right one,
[02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:52.510]  you know.
[02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:53.350]  Yeah,
[02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:55.470]  there's a lot of the same crosses,
[02:35:55.470 --> 02:35:57.590]  just cause you cross two of the same plants,
[02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:58.670]  even though they're different,
[02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:59.510]  you know,
[02:35:59.510 --> 02:36:00.350]  same name,
[02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:01.670]  but different plants.
[02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:05.030]  My version is going to be different than your version.
[02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.870]  Yeah,
[02:36:05.870 --> 02:36:07.590]  I think that's also cool,
[02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:08.430]  like,
[02:36:08.430 --> 02:36:09.270]  well I'm kind of stoked,
[02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:10.590]  I'm not really releasing too much,
[02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:12.030]  like,
[02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:15.270]  I think it's cool having like really unique varieties,
[02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:16.230]  that you know,
[02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:17.110]  people don't have,
[02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.950]  you know,
[02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:18.790]  like,
[02:36:19.790 --> 02:36:20.630]  like,
[02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:22.430]  I love supporting small time breeders,
[02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:24.390]  or people that don't get a lot of alkalates,
[02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:25.790]  because I just,
[02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:26.630]  I mean,
[02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:27.470]  this day,
[02:36:27.470 --> 02:36:28.750]  I feel like it's just getting easier and easier,
[02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:29.710]  to find good stuff,
[02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:30.990]  because like,
[02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.830]  good,
[02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:32.670]  I mean like,
[02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:33.510]  yeah,
[02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:35.510]  obviously we are probably getting bottlenecked,
[02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:37.350]  in certain gene pools,
[02:36:37.350 --> 02:36:38.190]  but like,
[02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:39.150]  Cookies.
[02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.990]  Yeah,
[02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.830]  definitely,
[02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:41.670]  definitely.
[02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:42.510]  I always give cookies,
[02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:44.070]  if you've seen any of the seed collectors,
[02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.910]  you know.
[02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:45.750]  I love OG,
[02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:46.590]  but like,
[02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:47.430]  I think,
[02:36:47.430 --> 02:36:48.270]  you know,
[02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:49.510]  I think it's more OG now,
[02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:51.110]  than it was when in like 2004,
[02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.950]  you know,
[02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:52.950]  like,
[02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:53.870]  it's just different,
[02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:54.710]  you know,
[02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:55.550]  so I mean like,
[02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:56.510]  I love a one to one,
[02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:58.190]  I think one to ones are hard to find,
[02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:59.030]  you know,
[02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.870]  like people are like,
[02:36:59.870 --> 02:37:00.710]  oh,
[02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:01.550]  nobody wants a one to one,
[02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:02.390]  I love one to one.
[02:37:02.390 --> 02:37:03.670]  So,
[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:05.510]  Ethiopian banana,
[02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:07.670]  that I got from Radio Ridge,
[02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:10.670]  is probably one of my favorite smokes ever,
[02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:11.510]  like,
[02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:14.230]  I can't smoke it at night,
[02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:15.070]  because it,
[02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:16.470]  it doesn't really put me down,
[02:37:16.470 --> 02:37:17.310]  like I need,
[02:37:17.310 --> 02:37:19.750]  but like I could smoke the Ethiopian banana,
[02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:20.830]  from morning,
[02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:21.670]  till I'm,
[02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:24.110]  sorry about that.
[02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:24.950]  That's all right,
[02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:26.470]  my phone's rang once already too.
[02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:30.150]  It's my sister in Japan.
[02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.990]  If you,
[02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.830]  you could definitely take that,
[02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:32.670]  if you need to.
[02:37:32.670 --> 02:37:33.510]  No,
[02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:34.350]  it's all good,
[02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:35.190]  I'm just,
[02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:36.550]  it's funny because,
[02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:37.710]  The time difference too,
[02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:38.550]  I know it's called.
[02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:40.030]  What time is it in Japan?
[02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.870]  You know,
[02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:42.190]  it's all love,
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:43.030]  I'll hit her up,
[02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.870]  it's all good,
[02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:45.070]  but,
[02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:46.870]  I forget what I was saying.
[02:37:47.430 --> 02:37:48.910]  We were talking about the Ethiopian banana,
[02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:50.390]  it doesn't really put you down,
[02:37:50.390 --> 02:37:51.230]  but,
[02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:52.070]  It's the best,
[02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.910]  it's like,
[02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:53.870]  if you,
[02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:56.230]  like I'll be social anxious sometimes,
[02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:57.070]  I get,
[02:37:57.070 --> 02:37:58.590]  you know,
[02:37:58.590 --> 02:38:00.190]  I might get worked up really easily,
[02:38:00.190 --> 02:38:01.350]  but like this one,
[02:38:01.350 --> 02:38:02.510]  like,
[02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:03.350]  this,
[02:38:03.350 --> 02:38:04.630]  this variety is special,
[02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:05.990]  like it's a one to one,
[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:07.030]  I believe,
[02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:10.350]  last time I saw it tested was 10% THC,
[02:38:10.350 --> 02:38:12.110]  9% CBD.
[02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:13.190]  Perfect.
[02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:15.190]  It tastes like bananas and scum,
[02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:16.030]  man,
[02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:17.390]  dude,
[02:38:17.390 --> 02:38:18.230]  Ethiopia,
[02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:19.070]  I'm writing this one down,
[02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.910]  because,
[02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:20.750]  If y'all haven't heard of it,
[02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:21.590]  go check it out,
[02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:22.430]  like,
[02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:23.270]  it's a beautiful one,
[02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:24.110]  and the,
[02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.950]  I don't know,
[02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:25.790]  Ethiopia,
[02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:28.310]  I'm just phonetically spelling this one out right now,
[02:38:28.310 --> 02:38:29.230]  It's a special one,
[02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:30.390]  so the story,
[02:38:30.390 --> 02:38:31.230]  and,
[02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:32.070]  That's horrible.
[02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:33.550]  Please go check it out,
[02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:35.630]  I know Bodhi had his hand in it,
[02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:38.870]  I believe the story goes,
[02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:40.350]  Empress Mennon,
[02:38:40.350 --> 02:38:41.990]  which was Empress Selassie,
[02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:43.390]  his queen and wife,
[02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:49.310]  got those from land race,
[02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:51.190]  highland Rastas,
[02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:52.030]  you know,
[02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:52.870]  like old school,
[02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:54.150]  you know,
[02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:57.990]  tribal people that were growing weed in Ethiopia,
[02:38:57.990 --> 02:39:01.550]  and that was handed on to somebody,
[02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:03.070]  and then that was handed to somebody,
[02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.910]  and then Bodhi,
[02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:04.750]  I think got it,
[02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:05.590]  and popped it,
[02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:07.230]  and found the one to one,
[02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:10.790]  that story might not be 100% accurate,
[02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:12.270]  but it's something along the lines of that,
[02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:14.310]  it has ties to the,
[02:39:14.310 --> 02:39:15.150]  you know,
[02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:15.990]  the royal family,
[02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:17.830]  it's definitely a special plant,
[02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:19.830]  it's very special.
[02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:23.710]  Now the first thing that I automatically thought,
[02:39:23.710 --> 02:39:24.590]  and you know,
[02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:25.710]  the question in my head,
[02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:27.750]  we were talking about long flowering stings earlier,
[02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:29.070]  I heard the word Ethiopia,
[02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:30.030]  and I'm like,
[02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:32.150]  is it a 14 weeker?
[02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.990]  Damn,
[02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.830]  see that breaks my heart,
[02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:34.670]  love smoking them,
[02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:35.510]  but,
[02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:36.470]  it's so worth it,
[02:39:36.470 --> 02:39:37.310]  and so like,
[02:39:37.310 --> 02:39:38.150]  I've crossed the,
[02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:39.470]  thanks to that,
[02:39:39.470 --> 02:39:42.270]  like I've crossed that Swedish male that I kept,
[02:39:42.270 --> 02:39:44.310]  to the Ethiopian banana,
[02:39:44.310 --> 02:39:45.470]  I just,
[02:39:45.790 --> 02:39:47.150]  I'm timid on popping them,
[02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:48.510]  until I can get,
[02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:49.430]  I can afford,
[02:39:49.430 --> 02:39:52.070]  or get them in a facility that can afford,
[02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:54.550]  to hunt like an actual do analytical test,
[02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:55.870]  because I'll pop them,
[02:39:55.870 --> 02:39:56.710]  and I'll be like,
[02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:57.550]  oh yeah,
[02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:58.390]  this one smoked,
[02:39:58.390 --> 02:39:59.230]  oh that one's,
[02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:00.070]  you know,
[02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.910]  but like,
[02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:01.910]  if I can see analytical data that tells me,
[02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:03.790]  oh there's that much CBD in it,
[02:40:03.790 --> 02:40:07.710]  that's when I'd want to pursue a breeding project with that,
[02:40:07.710 --> 02:40:08.990]  but I have it in the back burner,
[02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:10.630]  I've made a lot of stuff,
[02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:11.990]  that I just have on the back burner,
[02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:13.590]  for certain occasions,
[02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:16.150]  or things to pass on to my,
[02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.990]  to the youth,
[02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:18.510]  or things that I don't want to pop,
[02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:21.390]  until I can get them analytically tested,
[02:40:21.390 --> 02:40:23.030]  on what varieties are in there,
[02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.870]  you know,
[02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:25.070]  you know,
[02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:26.910]  I have some old Colombian crosses,
[02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:27.750]  that are old,
[02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:30.030]  like a friend of an old medical head,
[02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:31.150]  from Eugene,
[02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:33.670]  like who's just been growing sativas,
[02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:35.190]  like Colombians and sativas,
[02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:36.030]  and like,
[02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:37.510]  I would love to grow those,
[02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:38.430]  but I know like,
[02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:39.990]  I'm going to need a different climate,
[02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:41.510]  than I'm in right now.
[02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:42.350]  Taller ceiling.
[02:40:42.350 --> 02:40:43.190]  Yeah.
[02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:44.030]  Yeah.
[02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:44.870]  I love it.
[02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:46.270]  I love it.
[02:40:46.270 --> 02:40:47.550]  I love the variety.
[02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:48.470]  I love it.
[02:40:48.470 --> 02:40:51.070]  That analytical stuff is real though,
[02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:53.070]  like I've done some Harlequin crosses,
[02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:55.070]  but I stopped there,
[02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:59.230]  because even as a medical patient in Washington,
[02:40:59.230 --> 02:41:01.190]  unless I have a license,
[02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:03.350]  I can't get anything tested.
[02:41:03.350 --> 02:41:04.630]  So,
[02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:05.470]  I,
[02:41:05.470 --> 02:41:06.310]  you know,
[02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:08.470]  I started the project with grand intentions,
[02:41:08.470 --> 02:41:10.710]  but I really can't fricking do anything,
[02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:12.350]  with confidence with it.
[02:41:12.350 --> 02:41:14.750]  So it just kind of is at that stage.
[02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:15.590]  Yeah.
[02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:16.430]  It's like,
[02:41:16.430 --> 02:41:17.250]  it's in the back burner,
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:18.090]  and that's what's beautiful about seeds,
[02:41:18.090 --> 02:41:19.470]  as long as you store them properly,
[02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:20.990]  like they're stored,
[02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.830]  they're good.
[02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:22.670]  They're on the back burner,
[02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:25.030]  until life gives you the opportunity to pop them,
[02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.870]  you know,
[02:41:25.870 --> 02:41:27.110]  like I'm back in the day,
[02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:28.590]  when I'm like in medical scene,
[02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:30.150]  tests used to be so cheap,
[02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:31.830]  like you used to do shit,
[02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:32.750]  and hunch it,
[02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:33.590]  and test them,
[02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:36.230]  and get the turps back,
[02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:37.830]  and get your tests back,
[02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:39.710]  and hunt for potency,
[02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:41.590]  and now it's so expensive,
[02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:43.350]  because it's just,
[02:41:43.350 --> 02:41:44.870]  it's ridiculous.
[02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:45.710]  Hopefully,
[02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:47.710]  hopefully that opens up,
[02:41:47.710 --> 02:41:48.550]  you know,
[02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:49.390]  it just,
[02:41:49.390 --> 02:41:50.210]  A,
[02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:51.910]  we need to decide,
[02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:53.830]  and agree on a fricking standard,
[02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:56.110]  as all other elements,
[02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:57.710]  that scientists look for,
[02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:58.530]  and measure,
[02:41:58.530 --> 02:41:59.490]  and calculate,
[02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:00.550]  they have a standard,
[02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:03.790]  so there's no disparity between the tests.
[02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:05.710]  So first we need to agree on the standard,
[02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:07.150]  then we need to calibrate everything,
[02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:08.710]  then we need to get on it,
[02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:09.550]  but yeah,
[02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:10.390]  you know,
[02:42:10.390 --> 02:42:11.210]  there's,
[02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:12.050]  that's a great point Chad,
[02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:12.890]  I need to stop you right there,
[02:42:12.890 --> 02:42:13.710]  that's a great point,
[02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:15.270]  I think people need to really focus on this,
[02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:16.590]  if there's some lobbyists,
[02:42:16.590 --> 02:42:17.790]  because this is a huge thing,
[02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:18.630]  if we're just,
[02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:20.990]  if we have to in the industry test our product,
[02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:22.610]  but there's no checks and balances,
[02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:23.750]  there's no calibrations,
[02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:25.030]  there's no spike,
[02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:26.070]  industry standards,
[02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.910]  like so what the,
[02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:27.730]  like this is,
[02:42:27.730 --> 02:42:28.570]  it's a joke really,
[02:42:28.570 --> 02:42:29.630]  like people are looking at us,
[02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:30.670]  and looking and laughing,
[02:42:30.670 --> 02:42:31.790]  because that's a joke.
[02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:33.150]  Where is the standard?
[02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:34.630]  Where is the calibration?
[02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:35.470]  Like,
[02:42:35.470 --> 02:42:36.310]  yeah,
[02:42:36.310 --> 02:42:37.130]  people who know,
[02:42:37.130 --> 02:42:37.970]  and do this,
[02:42:37.970 --> 02:42:38.810]  and have done this for,
[02:42:38.810 --> 02:42:39.630]  you know,
[02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:41.950]  decades and hundreds of years,
[02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:43.550]  we're very amateur,
[02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:46.150]  but the people writing the laws don't know better,
[02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:48.030]  and at least in Washington,
[02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:50.990]  they take guidance from people with vested interests,
[02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:53.090]  so you know that it's biased,
[02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:57.750]  and not consumer focused information that they get,
[02:42:57.750 --> 02:43:00.230]  hence the legislation that they passed.
[02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:01.070]  Yeah.
[02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.910]  You're right,
[02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:02.730]  the lobbying groups,
[02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:03.670]  we need to get in there.
[02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:04.510]  Yeah,
[02:43:04.510 --> 02:43:05.330]  and it's just that,
[02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:06.170]  you know,
[02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:07.850]  this is the wheels,
[02:43:07.850 --> 02:43:08.670]  and I'm sure there's no money,
[02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:09.510]  and people being like,
[02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:11.170]  we need to standardize testing,
[02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:12.750]  and people are like,
[02:43:12.750 --> 02:43:15.050]  I paid this guy extra money to get me higher tests,
[02:43:15.050 --> 02:43:15.890]  let's,
[02:43:15.890 --> 02:43:16.730]  I don't really care about that,
[02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:17.550]  you know,
[02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:18.390]  it's like stuff like that,
[02:43:18.390 --> 02:43:19.330]  and I know it's,
[02:43:19.330 --> 02:43:21.050]  it doesn't happen as much as it used to,
[02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:22.330]  but it still happens.
[02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:24.290]  Yeah.
[02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:26.090]  I'm just,
[02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:26.910]  I'm just sorry,
[02:43:26.910 --> 02:43:29.010]  I'm typing a response into the chat.
[02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:32.090]  So if somebody had teased me here,
[02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:33.450]  I'm just gonna put it up now,
[02:43:33.450 --> 02:43:34.890]  because I'm responding to it,
[02:43:34.890 --> 02:43:35.730]  but it says,
[02:43:35.730 --> 02:43:39.330]  License to Drive is one of Chad's all time favorite movies,
[02:43:39.330 --> 02:43:40.850]  which is not a lie,
[02:43:40.850 --> 02:43:41.690]  I was typing,
[02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:42.730]  and I'll put it in here now,
[02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:43.550]  my unfinished job,
[02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:44.390]  but it's like,
[02:43:44.390 --> 02:43:45.210]  Cory on Cory,
[02:43:45.210 --> 02:43:48.030]  how could you go wrong with Cory on Cory action,
[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:49.770]  like Lost Boys,
[02:43:49.770 --> 02:43:51.010]  License to Drive,
[02:43:51.010 --> 02:43:51.970]  I had a teenage,
[02:43:51.970 --> 02:43:52.810]  well,
[02:43:52.810 --> 02:43:53.950]  my sister was two years older than me,
[02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:55.970]  and this was during the heyday of the Corys,
[02:43:55.970 --> 02:43:57.050]  and New Kids on the Block,
[02:43:57.050 --> 02:43:57.890]  so dude,
[02:43:57.890 --> 02:43:58.710]  I know all about them,
[02:43:58.710 --> 02:44:00.430]  and License to Drive bro,
[02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:01.270]  good movie,
[02:44:01.270 --> 02:44:02.090]  best line,
[02:44:02.090 --> 02:44:04.890]  you mustn't fuck with the DMV.
[02:44:04.890 --> 02:44:05.730]  Yeah,
[02:44:05.730 --> 02:44:07.210]  I love that movie,
[02:44:07.210 --> 02:44:08.050]  the whole,
[02:44:08.050 --> 02:44:09.850]  the coffee on the dashboard,
[02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:10.690]  yes,
[02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:11.510]  on the hill,
[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:12.350]  no,
[02:44:12.350 --> 02:44:13.190]  I love that,
[02:44:13.190 --> 02:44:14.010]  oh,
[02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:14.850]  that is so great,
[02:44:14.850 --> 02:44:15.810]  yes,
[02:44:15.810 --> 02:44:19.090]  I wound up taking my driver's test stone,
[02:44:19.090 --> 02:44:19.910]  this is,
[02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:20.750]  okay,
[02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:21.570]  so this is the teenage,
[02:44:21.570 --> 02:44:22.410]  you know me,
[02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:23.250]  I'm like,
[02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:24.070]  but if,
[02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.910]  you got it,
[02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:25.750]  I'm not encouraging this,
[02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:26.570]  everybody,
[02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:28.530]  this is a story from like a 16 year old me,
[02:44:28.530 --> 02:44:31.130]  which do not fucking take life advice from,
[02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:32.050]  I'll just put it that way,
[02:44:32.890 --> 02:44:33.730]  but I'm like,
[02:44:33.730 --> 02:44:34.550]  dude,
[02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:35.390]  if I could pass the test high,
[02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:36.650]  then I could drive high,
[02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:37.490]  and yeah,
[02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:38.490]  it was one of those like,
[02:44:38.490 --> 02:44:39.730]  the three point turn,
[02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:42.410]  I was like a little bit too wide from,
[02:44:42.410 --> 02:44:44.250]  or from the back around the corner,
[02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:45.090]  that's what it was,
[02:44:45.090 --> 02:44:47.010]  I was a little bit wide from the curb,
[02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:47.850]  it didn't,
[02:44:47.850 --> 02:44:48.670]  pass.
[02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:49.510]  Yeah,
[02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:50.350]  you know like,
[02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:51.170]  if you keep your picture high,
[02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:52.010]  and your license,
[02:44:52.010 --> 02:44:52.850]  and you look high on your license,
[02:44:52.850 --> 02:44:53.670]  yes,
[02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:54.510]  yes,
[02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:56.010]  I was sitting high,
[02:44:56.010 --> 02:44:57.010]  logic dude,
[02:44:57.010 --> 02:44:57.850]  oh,
[02:44:57.850 --> 02:45:01.570]  I'm not gonna even say stone or logic,
[02:45:01.570 --> 02:45:02.970]  I'm just gonna say,
[02:45:02.970 --> 02:45:04.490]  young logic,
[02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:05.450]  oh man,
[02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:06.290]  that was fun.
[02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:09.410]  Yeah man,
[02:45:09.410 --> 02:45:11.370]  it's been a really lovely chat with you,
[02:45:11.370 --> 02:45:12.210]  it's nice,
[02:45:12.210 --> 02:45:13.050]  you know like,
[02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:13.890]  I love it,
[02:45:13.890 --> 02:45:14.770]  like my lady just,
[02:45:14.770 --> 02:45:16.530]  all I do is talk,
[02:45:16.530 --> 02:45:17.910]  weed with her,
[02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:19.850]  I get to work at a lovely spot,
[02:45:19.850 --> 02:45:21.850]  like hello to everybody at work,
[02:45:21.850 --> 02:45:23.090]  if you're watching this,
[02:45:24.030 --> 02:45:24.870]  yeah,
[02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:26.930]  really appreciate working with everybody,
[02:45:26.930 --> 02:45:27.770]  I love it,
[02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:28.850]  like it's,
[02:45:28.850 --> 02:45:29.730]  I love cannabis,
[02:45:29.770 --> 02:45:31.730]  I'm grateful to be able to just chat,
[02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:32.890]  you know,
[02:45:32.890 --> 02:45:34.210]  it's really fun.
[02:45:34.210 --> 02:45:35.050]  Well,
[02:45:35.050 --> 02:45:35.890]  that's cool man,
[02:45:35.890 --> 02:45:36.710]  it takes the right attitude,
[02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:37.570]  the right attitude,
[02:45:37.570 --> 02:45:39.570]  attracts the right people,
[02:45:39.570 --> 02:45:40.450]  I think,
[02:45:40.450 --> 02:45:41.810]  you know the language you use,
[02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:43.330]  says a lot about a person,
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:44.410]  and,
[02:45:44.410 --> 02:45:45.650]  that's really important to me,
[02:45:45.650 --> 02:45:47.850]  cause I like to try to fill myself,
[02:45:47.850 --> 02:45:49.410]  you know with like positive people,
[02:45:49.410 --> 02:45:50.250]  or things,
[02:45:50.250 --> 02:45:52.130]  you know life does suck sometimes,
[02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.950]  but you know,
[02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:54.030]  you try to be positive,
[02:45:54.030 --> 02:45:56.530]  and just these words that people can say,
[02:45:56.530 --> 02:45:57.930]  and use and choose,
[02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:00.210]  it helps lift me up,
[02:46:00.210 --> 02:46:01.050]  so you know,
[02:46:01.050 --> 02:46:03.050]  I appreciate the conversation.
[02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:05.330]  I love listening to the future cannabis project,
[02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:06.410]  you know it's like,
[02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:07.230]  it's really cool,
[02:46:07.230 --> 02:46:08.970]  cause there's been a lot of different,
[02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:11.530]  people doing different things I should say,
[02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:12.370]  but like,
[02:46:12.370 --> 02:46:15.050]  I've definitely gravitated towards this channel,
[02:46:15.050 --> 02:46:16.010]  FCP2,
[02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:17.270]  and the original one,
[02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:18.610]  like respects to Peter,

[02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.690]  I got,
[02:46:30.690 --> 02:46:31.530]  keep it simple,
[02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:32.370]  you know,
[02:46:32.370 --> 02:46:33.290]  cannabis scientist,
[02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:34.130]  or science,

[02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:41.170]  I love it,
[02:46:41.170 --> 02:46:42.010]  it's a great platform,
[02:46:42.010 --> 02:46:43.210]  this has been a lovely night,
[02:46:43.210 --> 02:46:44.050]  you know,
[02:46:44.050 --> 02:46:46.290]  I'm sure we've gone a lot longer than you expected,
[02:46:46.290 --> 02:46:48.290]  and I've had a great time,
[02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:49.570]  this has been lovely.
[02:46:49.570 --> 02:46:50.410]  Well thank you,
[02:46:50.410 --> 02:46:51.230]  yeah you know me too,
[02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:52.130]  I you know,
[02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:54.290]  usually like an hour,
[02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:55.210]  two hours,
[02:46:55.210 --> 02:46:56.930]  is as long as the,
[02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:58.610]  you know I usually try to go,
[02:46:58.610 --> 02:47:01.450]  we're approaching three hours right now,
[02:47:01.450 --> 02:47:02.290]  so yeah.
[02:47:02.290 --> 02:47:03.130]  You're right.
[02:47:03.130 --> 02:47:03.970]  I know,
[02:47:03.970 --> 02:47:05.850]  it is getting late for you,
[02:47:05.850 --> 02:47:08.010]  but I freaking have enjoyed this.
[02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:10.570]  I look forward to maybe future conversations,
[02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:13.810]  like maybe in the future when things get,
[02:47:13.810 --> 02:47:14.930]  you know a little bit better,
[02:47:14.930 --> 02:47:15.770]  where we're working,
[02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:16.770]  we can maybe go through that,
[02:47:16.770 --> 02:47:18.250]  cause that's a pretty special place,
[02:47:18.250 --> 02:47:19.490]  I won't mention too much of it,
[02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:21.170]  but yeah I mean,
[02:47:21.170 --> 02:47:23.630]  I think the future's bright for this channel,
[02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:24.870]  for this platform,
[02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:26.910]  and just for life in general,
[02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:29.630]  don't get caught up in the BS,
[02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:31.070]  you know a lot of,
[02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:34.150]  there's a lot of negativity thrown at us humans,
[02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:35.870]  you know just remember,
[02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:37.790]  we're all just humans,
[02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:38.910]  we're part of the human race,
[02:47:38.910 --> 02:47:40.310]  we're all one blood,
[02:47:40.310 --> 02:47:41.890]  you know we're all just trying to get through the day,
[02:47:41.890 --> 02:47:42.790]  positivity,
[02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:43.790]  like Chad said,
[02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:46.350]  be around positivity is a good thing,
[02:47:46.350 --> 02:47:48.510]  where life is full of ups and downs,
[02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:49.350]  hills and valleys,
[02:47:49.350 --> 02:47:50.270]  highs and lows,
[02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:51.430]  you know but it's,
[02:47:51.430 --> 02:47:54.230]  you know it's the lows that make the highs so high,
[02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:56.390]  and you know hold on to those highs as long as you can,
[02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:58.830]  you know be positive,
[02:47:58.830 --> 02:47:59.830]  don't stress,
[02:47:59.830 --> 02:48:01.430]  you know puff tough.
[02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:02.270]  Exactly,
[02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:05.030]  and thanks everybody and Chad for being here this evening,
[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:06.190]  and enjoying yourselves,
[02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:07.470]  and having a good time,
[02:48:07.470 --> 02:48:09.190]  and yeah just being.
[02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:10.030]  Well,
[02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.870]  all right hold up,
[02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:12.790]  you wanna give away a pack or something?
[02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:14.350]  Well,
[02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:15.510]  yeah sure,
[02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:16.350]  definitely,
[02:48:16.350 --> 02:48:19.150]  the chat definitely loves these types of things.
[02:48:19.150 --> 02:48:22.070]  I'll give away the Chem Diesel OG Airborne,
[02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:25.190]  cause that's the one I'm most excited for really,
[02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:27.030]  that one and the GDP,
[02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:28.350]  but I'll just do the Airborne,
[02:48:28.350 --> 02:48:31.630]  so let's say,
[02:48:31.630 --> 02:48:33.470]  I don't know however you wanna do it,
[02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:34.830]  I don't see giveaways.
[02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:35.670]  I know,
[02:48:35.670 --> 02:48:38.110]  so they do have this like new handy giveaway tool,
[02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:39.950]  for StreamYard that I haven't used,
[02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:40.950]  and don't know how to use,
[02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:42.610]  and I don't have a tutorial pulled up,
[02:48:42.610 --> 02:48:44.550]  so we could go old school with it,
[02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:48.750]  do you see on the right hand side of your screen,
[02:48:48.750 --> 02:48:50.590]  next to the chat you should see a box,
[02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:52.230]  that'll say like private chat?
[02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:53.070]  Yeah.
[02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:53.890]  Okay,
[02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:54.730]  if you want to,
[02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:58.210]  there's 125 people watching at the moment,
[02:48:58.210 --> 02:49:02.450]  if you wanna put a number between one to 400,
[02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:04.730]  in that private chat,
[02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:07.770]  we'll go ahead and then we can use that.
[02:49:07.770 --> 02:49:09.650]  So now stipulations,
[02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:11.770]  I don't,
[02:49:11.770 --> 02:49:13.690]  it's hard to ship everywhere,
[02:49:13.690 --> 02:49:15.810]  is this US only?
[02:49:15.810 --> 02:49:16.650]  Yes,
[02:49:16.650 --> 02:49:17.470]  only sorry,
[02:49:17.470 --> 02:49:20.210]  I love and respect everybody throughout the world,
[02:49:20.210 --> 02:49:23.290]  it's just not as easy to do that,
[02:49:23.290 --> 02:49:25.490]  so only US only please.
[02:49:25.490 --> 02:49:26.330]  Yes,
[02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:28.490]  and that's how I have to do mine as well,
[02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:30.530]  so I completely understand that,
[02:49:30.530 --> 02:49:33.450]  and we have,
[02:49:33.450 --> 02:49:34.890]  My favorite.
[02:49:34.890 --> 02:49:35.730]  Awesome,
[02:49:35.730 --> 02:49:37.490]  we've got a good number in there right now,
[02:49:37.490 --> 02:49:38.690]  and what we'll do again guys,
[02:49:38.690 --> 02:49:40.130]  this is one to 400,
[02:49:40.130 --> 02:49:42.770]  wait until I say start,
[02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:44.370]  I used to try to do,
[02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:46.570]  and maybe one love you can help me watch the chat,
[02:49:46.570 --> 02:49:47.890]  Roblox is gonna go fast,
[02:49:47.890 --> 02:49:51.690]  I used to say just one number per person,
[02:49:51.690 --> 02:49:52.970]  that never works out,
[02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.650]  there's always somebody that has to like ruin it,
[02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:58.370]  and you'd be amazed at how often that person wins,
[02:49:58.370 --> 02:49:59.850]  so now,
[02:49:59.850 --> 02:50:02.090]  because I don't know how to use that tool,
[02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:04.830]  that would have eliminated all of this,
[02:50:06.370 --> 02:50:08.810]  you can type as many numbers as you want,
[02:50:08.810 --> 02:50:10.450]  we'll just wait until we see it,
[02:50:10.450 --> 02:50:11.650]  and then we'll call it out again,
[02:50:11.650 --> 02:50:13.490]  so US only,
[02:50:13.490 --> 02:50:15.270]  I do appreciate this,
[02:50:15.270 --> 02:50:16.130]  and I've almost like,
[02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:18.490]  well shit I'm gonna hop out,
[02:50:18.490 --> 02:50:21.930]  and try to toss a number in the chat,
[02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:22.930]  this is a good one,
[02:50:25.930 --> 02:50:26.770]  thank you,
[02:50:26.770 --> 02:50:29.530]  we'll have to get you on a seed collectors episode,
[02:50:29.530 --> 02:50:32.730]  because I think you're probably in on that,
[02:50:32.730 --> 02:50:33.770]  so this is the top one,
[02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:35.570]  the chem diesel OG,
[02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:38.450]  yeah that's the J trees chem diesel OG,
[02:50:38.450 --> 02:50:40.970]  cross to my air horn open pollination,
[02:50:44.290 --> 02:50:46.730]  okay I'm gonna go ahead,
[02:50:46.730 --> 02:50:49.790]  and I will hit start into the chat,
[02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:50.870]  once everybody sees it,
[02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:52.350]  put in your number,
[02:50:52.350 --> 02:50:55.510]  and one love we're just gonna watch them roll by,
[02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:56.950]  all right so,
[02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:58.990]  there's usually a little bit of a delay,
[02:50:58.990 --> 02:51:00.570]  but I've popped start into there,
[02:51:00.570 --> 02:51:01.630]  we've got the number,
[02:51:01.630 --> 02:51:03.950]  I've already seen the number,
[02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:04.870]  so we'll do that,
[02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:06.830]  but while we're doing this,
[02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:08.870]  maybe can you tell us,
[02:51:10.590 --> 02:51:13.210]  you know what was your favorite part about it,
[02:51:13.210 --> 02:51:15.510]  or something maybe about the growth,
[02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:17.750]  that people could benefit from knowing?
[02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:19.470]  The air horn throws spears,
[02:51:19.470 --> 02:51:22.390]  like the phenos I selected,
[02:51:22.390 --> 02:51:25.510]  and the phenos that I've seen a lot of in there,
[02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:27.870]  they throw this like really nice,
[02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:30.350]  you know how like the OGs have those top colas,
[02:51:30.350 --> 02:51:32.990]  with those like just the popcorn running up it,
[02:51:32.990 --> 02:51:36.670]  the air horn seems to have just stretched into a spear,
[02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:39.350]  so that's what I'm really liking with the phenos,
[02:51:39.350 --> 02:51:40.910]  that I'm selecting and keeping,
[02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:44.270]  they seem to be really loud,
[02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:45.910]  and the most stinkiest ones,
[02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:48.430]  are the ones that are just throwing the spears,
[02:51:48.430 --> 02:51:51.950]  really nice tight internal structure,
[02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:55.990]  but has that really like OG structure,
[02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:57.430]  I should say,
[02:51:57.430 --> 02:51:59.430]  like kind of stretchy,
[02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:02.110]  branchy,
[02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:04.350]  but the nugs are like spears,
[02:52:04.350 --> 02:52:05.390]  I'm a big,
[02:52:05.390 --> 02:52:06.230]  I love it,
[02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:07.950]  like it's great to trim,
[02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:09.590]  the nub to leaf ratio,
[02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:11.430]  you know you have those nice big leaves,
[02:52:11.430 --> 02:52:12.670]  but then we get like,
[02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:16.030]  not a lot of those little itty bitty leaves,
[02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:18.630]  so the trim is actually pretty nice on it,
[02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:20.150]  but yeah I just like it's potent,
[02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:21.670]  it's the air horns definitely potent,
[02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:22.990]  that's what stood out to me,
[02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:24.470]  when I selected the air horn,
[02:52:24.470 --> 02:52:27.150]  it's just potent always quality,
[02:52:27.150 --> 02:52:27.990]  you know.
[02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.830]  And the air horn was pretty,
[02:52:28.830 --> 02:52:30.470]  that's the air horn right there.
[02:52:30.470 --> 02:52:31.310]  One of the keeper,
[02:52:31.310 --> 02:52:32.910]  yeah that was one of the keepers for sure,
[02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:34.390]  she's special,
[02:52:34.390 --> 02:52:35.230]  she was good,
[02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:38.470]  that one had like skunk OG,
[02:52:38.470 --> 02:52:40.190]  like definitely skunk OG,
[02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:44.230]  I'd love to see somebody who hashes,
[02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:46.110]  maybe I could give one of my selected cuts,
[02:52:46.110 --> 02:52:48.350]  to somebody around here in Colorado who hashes,
[02:52:48.350 --> 02:52:50.310]  but I'm curious to see how it hashes,
[02:52:50.310 --> 02:52:51.510]  cause the hashes like,
[02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:53.590]  it's really got that tackiness,
[02:52:55.430 --> 02:52:56.270]  yeah,
[02:52:56.270 --> 02:52:57.110]  it's very cool.
[02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:58.310]  That's something that,
[02:52:58.310 --> 02:52:59.750]  you know I was thinking of,
[02:52:59.750 --> 02:53:01.910]  playing around with this next year,
[02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:03.750]  cause you know again I mentioned earlier,
[02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:05.590]  I'm a flower person,
[02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:09.310]  and so I don't really make many,
[02:53:09.350 --> 02:53:10.230]  concentrates,
[02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:12.430]  but that's what a lot of people like,
[02:53:12.430 --> 02:53:14.750]  and I think if I'm working on some strains,
[02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:16.070]  I kind of want to know that stuff,
[02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:18.590]  so I am looking at getting like a little,
[02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:21.070]  just like press or something to play around,
[02:53:21.070 --> 02:53:24.230]  to try to find these answers.
[02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:25.070]  Yeah I mean,
[02:53:25.070 --> 02:53:26.950]  I did all that like in Hawaii,
[02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:27.990]  with the slope,
[02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:29.470]  you know we,
[02:53:29.470 --> 02:53:30.990]  we grew a lot of stuff,
[02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:32.110]  mainly for hash,
[02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:34.230]  you know like we all obviously like our flower,
[02:53:34.230 --> 02:53:35.430]  but you know,
[02:53:35.430 --> 02:53:37.630]  did a lot of fresh trimming,
[02:53:37.630 --> 02:53:40.230]  and did fresh frozen hash extraction,
[02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:43.350]  and eventually moved to rosin,
[02:53:43.350 --> 02:53:45.550]  and this was really geeking out on the solvent list,
[02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:46.430]  and I love,
[02:53:46.430 --> 02:53:47.270]  I love it,
[02:53:47.270 --> 02:53:48.190]  it's just time consuming,
[02:53:48.190 --> 02:53:49.030]  and with a kid,
[02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:50.390]  and a full time job,
[02:53:50.390 --> 02:53:52.470]  and a personal little grow hobby,
[02:53:52.470 --> 02:53:54.670]  I have stuff in my freezer,
[02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:56.670]  that I'm asking people,
[02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:57.830]  if they just want to wash it,
[02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:58.950]  just to see what happens,
[02:53:58.950 --> 02:54:00.110]  like and I'm like,
[02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:01.470]  I don't have the time,
[02:54:01.470 --> 02:54:03.190]  my equipment's all boxed up,
[02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:06.150]  it's,
[02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:07.750]  I just like growing and smoking flour,
[02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:10.470]  and if I could get some hash from some homies,
[02:54:10.470 --> 02:54:12.350]  or some like some good quality,
[02:54:12.350 --> 02:54:13.350]  you know shout out,
[02:54:13.350 --> 02:54:14.190]  Octa,
[02:54:14.190 --> 02:54:16.710]  I've bought some really good Octa hash,
[02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:18.990]  in Colorado,
[02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:21.030]  really good solventless rosin,
[02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:24.230]  but yeah I'm sure there's a lot of it out here in Colorado,
[02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:25.870]  I'm just new to the area,
[02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:26.990]  I don't know a lot of people,
[02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:29.430]  I have to go to dispensaries like a newbie,
[02:54:29.430 --> 02:54:31.550]  cause I'm just a,
[02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:32.630]  I'm a West Coast kid,
[02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:34.590]  who found his way to Cali,
[02:54:34.590 --> 02:54:35.590]  you know I mean sorry,
[02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:36.950]  but I found his way to Colorado,
[02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:38.470]  I'm loving it,
[02:54:38.470 --> 02:54:39.470]  me and my wife love it,
[02:54:39.470 --> 02:54:41.630]  we're excited to grow our kids here,
[02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:42.750]  and have you know,
[02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:45.670]  nice little Colorado time.
[02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:47.870]  Well so the biggest thing that I've heard,
[02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:49.030]  about growing over there,
[02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:50.390]  cause again I'm in Washington,
[02:54:50.390 --> 02:54:51.790]  I'm on the West side of the mountains,
[02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:53.590]  we you know we deal with moisture,
[02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:55.550]  I can hang dry my stuff for a month,
[02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:56.590]  because it hangs,
[02:54:56.590 --> 02:55:00.350]  or it's like 60% humidity,
[02:55:00.350 --> 02:55:01.190]  where I dry it,
[02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:02.470]  so I could leave it in there all I want,
[02:55:02.470 --> 02:55:04.470]  the one thing I hear about Colorado though,
[02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:06.510]  is the Colorado crunch,
[02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:07.870]  and let's see here,
[02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:09.830]  I think I just saw the number.
[02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:10.670]  I have seen it,
[02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:12.430]  I mean they have my numbers,
[02:55:12.430 --> 02:55:13.990]  I love that number.
[02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:16.790]  Yep so I do see two people,
[02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:18.030]  right next to each other,
[02:55:18.030 --> 02:55:18.870]  typed it,
[02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:20.190]  but I'm looking for one more,
[02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:23.190]  did it come in first or last?
[02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:24.950]  So okay so.
[02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:26.470]  I got both you guys.
[02:55:28.390 --> 02:55:30.430]  I think there might have been there,
[02:55:30.430 --> 02:55:31.270]  here we go,
[02:55:31.270 --> 02:55:34.110]  here's the first instance that I see,
[02:55:34.510 --> 02:55:37.390]  the number for showing up,
[02:55:37.390 --> 02:55:40.990]  is Elite GP,
[02:55:40.990 --> 02:55:44.830]  I'm assuming the X's are just there for show?
[02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:46.030]  I see,
[02:55:46.030 --> 02:55:47.070]  no is that it?
[02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:48.030]  Yeah I see him,
[02:55:48.030 --> 02:55:50.030]  and then David and Johnny,
[02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:52.310]  just because there's just so many guesses,
[02:55:52.310 --> 02:55:54.790]  I'll hook all three of you guys up with some facts.
[02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:55.630]  Get out,
[02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:56.630]  let's get to it,
[02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:57.470]  thank you.
[02:55:57.470 --> 02:55:58.310]  Yeah.
[02:55:58.310 --> 02:56:00.150]  So I mean thank you on behalf of these guys too,
[02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:01.830]  lucky night for you guys.
[02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:03.190]  I'll expect I think 100 people to show up,
[02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:04.790]  and hear me blabber about my life.
[02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:05.750]  I'm grateful,
[02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:07.030]  I love my life,
[02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:10.630]  I'm grateful that you guys are part of the cannabis community
[02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:13.110]  and tapped in and wanna pop some seeds
[02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:14.430]  that are cool and new.
[02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:15.750]  Happy to spread the love,
[02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:16.590]  you know,
[02:56:16.590 --> 02:56:17.910]  so that's what it's about.
[02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:19.070]  That's cool man,
[02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:20.150]  that is very awesome,
[02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:21.190]  and I'm writing this down.
[02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:22.510]  So we got Lee XP,
[02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:24.950]  we got David Bryden,
[02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:27.990]  and we've got Johnny HB.
[02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:29.990]  Now what would be the best way,
[02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:32.150]  do you want them to DM you?
[02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:36.150]  DM, you don't need to talk about payment or anything
[02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:37.350]  because it's free.
[02:56:37.350 --> 02:56:40.310]  So just go ahead and just be like, you know.
[02:56:40.310 --> 02:56:42.390]  FCP winner from…
[02:56:42.390 --> 02:56:44.390]  Give me some proof please.
[02:56:44.390 --> 02:56:47.990]  And we'll just go from there with addresses and whatnot.
[02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:49.430]  I'll get them to you as soon as I can.
[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:50.710]  Yep, yep.
[02:56:50.710 --> 02:56:53.750]  And you guys can do the same with me if you want.
[02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:57.830]  I'm just writing down the info here.
[02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:59.190]  You guys all know my IG.
[02:56:59.590 --> 02:57:03.870]  OneLove IG is down in the show notes.
[02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:06.750]  So people can go and find him,
[02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:07.750]  follow them there.
[02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:08.910]  And again, look at the list
[02:57:08.910 --> 02:57:10.870]  that I was showing up here tonight.
[02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:11.710]  That'll show you the list
[02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:14.230]  and that will show you some of the flowers
[02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:16.630]  that he has and has been working on as well.
[02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:20.150]  So that's a great way to freaking wrap up the night.
[02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:21.630]  We're trying to give away one pack
[02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:22.790]  and you give away three.
[02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:23.910]  Yeah, spread the love.
[02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:25.750]  You know, pop those seeds,
[02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:26.870]  find something special,
[02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:28.830]  smoke weed.
[02:57:29.430 --> 02:57:31.310]  And hey guys, when you get these,
[02:57:31.310 --> 02:57:33.270]  you pop these, send them some pictures.
[02:57:33.270 --> 02:57:34.550]  That's always appreciated.
[02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:36.150]  That's always love feedback
[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:38.510]  from people growing them out.
[02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:41.230]  That's priceless for somebody making seeds.
[02:57:41.230 --> 02:57:43.390]  Not only from the informational standpoint
[02:57:43.390 --> 02:57:45.750]  to help others in the future,
[02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:47.670]  but from a pride standpoint, man.
[02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:52.590]  Like that is a humbling thing to see.
[02:57:52.590 --> 02:57:55.470]  Yeah, I love seeing pictures of everybody's work.
[02:57:55.470 --> 02:57:56.470]  My work, everybody.
[02:57:56.470 --> 02:57:58.470]  I mean, we all geek out on that,
[02:57:59.110 --> 02:57:59.950]  but porn all the time.
[02:57:59.950 --> 02:58:00.790]  I love to see it.
[02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:05.590]  I'll be popping a lot more of my own personal
[02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:08.110]  open pollination air horn cross,
[02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:10.950]  but I'm gonna be doing germ tests
[02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:13.670]  and doing my own hunts through all that stuff.
[02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:17.430]  So I'm only gonna be hunting through some of it.
[02:58:17.430 --> 02:58:18.470]  Most of it, like I said,
[02:58:18.470 --> 02:58:20.790]  it's for my kids or for future things.
[02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:22.830]  I'm still kind of excited about the air horn.
[02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:25.710]  I'm gonna be really digging into that next year.
[02:58:25.710 --> 02:58:28.670]  So I'm happy to release this to the public
[02:58:28.670 --> 02:58:30.750]  and get people turned on to weed,
[02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:33.270]  like new varieties, new little expressions,
[02:58:33.270 --> 02:58:36.910]  like the stuff like, I like potent weed.
[02:58:36.910 --> 02:58:38.710]  So potent weed usually passes on.
[02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:41.670]  So I hope you guys find something potent that you like.
[02:58:41.670 --> 02:58:42.510]  Nice, nice.
[02:58:42.510 --> 02:58:45.070]  And Johnny, I know the feeling.
[02:58:45.070 --> 02:58:50.070]  If you want, yes, I have one I could give out publicly.
[02:58:50.270 --> 02:58:52.310]  If you, do you have one that you wanna give out?
[02:58:52.310 --> 02:58:54.270]  Okay, just chat.
[02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:55.630]  No, dude, trust me.
[02:58:56.470 --> 02:58:59.750]  I know the feeling, chad.westport, gmail.com.
[02:58:59.750 --> 02:59:01.990]  So chat, you'll hook him up with mine?
[02:59:03.350 --> 02:59:05.990]  Yes, well, he can email me
[02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:08.830]  and then I'll be able to give you the information there
[02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:09.670]  through your social.
[02:59:09.670 --> 02:59:12.790]  So yeah, Johnny HB, I've got you written down.
[02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:16.950]  Just hit me up on the email, chad.westport at gmail.com.
[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:18.990]  And then like Inspector Gadget,
[02:59:18.990 --> 02:59:20.430]  destroy this message.
[02:59:20.430 --> 02:59:23.470]  It will self-destruct in 15 seconds.
[02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:24.630]  Yeah.
[02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:25.710]  Another reference.
[02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:29.110]  See, dude, are you starting to get the 90s, Chad, now?
[02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.950]  I love it.
[02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:31.190]  Okay, good.
[02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:34.470]  I mean, I was young, but I grew up in the 90s.
[02:59:34.470 --> 02:59:36.030]  I'm an 80s, 90s kid.
[02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:37.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:59:37.350 --> 02:59:39.350]  Well, I'm thankful for that
[02:59:39.350 --> 02:59:42.790]  because I probably made a whole lot more sense this evening.
[02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:43.630]  But we're-
[02:59:43.630 --> 02:59:48.030]  Yo, I was listening to your talk at the PM talk
[02:59:48.030 --> 02:59:49.950]  and you dropped a Molarap reference.
[02:59:49.950 --> 02:59:52.070]  Yeah, it's a scooter.
[02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:54.590]  Exactly what you're talking about.
[02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:56.430]  Easter bunny doesn't exist.
[02:59:56.430 --> 02:59:58.670]  Ah, thank you, dude.
[02:59:58.670 --> 03:00:00.150]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:00:00.150 --> 03:00:02.430]  Because Matthew Gates gave me the look of,
[03:00:02.430 --> 03:00:04.550]  I have no idea what you're talking about, bro.
[03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:05.750]  And I'm gonna let you know.
[03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:06.870]  Kevin Smith, bro.
[03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:08.550]  Kevin Smith, bro.
[03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:09.870]  That's awesome.
[03:00:09.870 --> 03:00:11.390]  Old school.
[03:00:11.390 --> 03:00:12.790]  Hell yeah.
[03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:14.670]  Well, shit, dude, this has been a fun night.
[03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.510]  We will wrap it up.
[03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:19.350]  Definitely love to have you come back again.
[03:00:19.350 --> 03:00:20.310]  Yeah, man, it's been great.
[03:00:20.310 --> 03:00:21.150]  Thank you so much.
[03:00:21.150 --> 03:00:22.110]  Thanks to the crew.
[03:00:22.110 --> 03:00:22.950]  Thanks, Peter.
[03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:24.230]  Lots of love to everybody.
[03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:25.790]  It's been really fun.
[03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:27.470]  Hope you all enjoyed it.
[03:00:27.470 --> 03:00:28.750]  Word, much love, chat.
[03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:31.070]  We will catch you again soon.
[03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:33.710]  Let's see, when are we gonna be back?
[03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:35.510]  When are we gonna be back?
[03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:39.310]  Ooh, we might have a seed collectors episode on Tuesday.
[03:00:39.310 --> 03:00:40.550]  I need to check with Dave
[03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:45.070]  to see if his special guest is still on schedule.
[03:00:45.070 --> 03:00:48.630]  So tune in, find out, suspenseful music.
[03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:49.990]  Do, do, do, do, do.
[03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:52.390]  With that, I'll wrap it up.
[03:00:52.390 --> 03:00:53.430]  Drop out.
[03:00:53.430 --> 03:00:55.750]  Yes, let me hit the end broadcast button.
[03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:56.590]  Peace out.
