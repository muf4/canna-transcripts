Kevin Jodry, can you talk to us about how you think the emergency regulations are
going to impact the climate of cannabis for the farmers of the Emerald Triangle
and California in general? What's your perspective? Well I had a perspective
that I thought was right because I'm trying to study the regulations on a
really current basis and it looked like it was exceptionally stringent on mold
levels, yeast levels, just active culture in general. It was very stringent in
pesticide usages and fungicide usages. The level of contaminants allowed
visibly on a product was exceptionally limited and so to me the
regulations were difficult to get product to the store because it was
going to be very difficult to find cultivars that could handle the fungal
pressure without using adulterants. It was going to be difficult to be able to
do certain situations because of just pathogenic pressure or pest pressure and
so I was up late last night I couldn't sleep and I started doing some research
and I dug up some weird stuff and it was really from Project CBD and it was an
article called Bugs, Mold and Excrement and what it was was it was on
November 16th they said they released this new set of rules and when I
went online into the California site I can't find this information but this
basically is a change in how California is going to deal with pesticide usage. I
think they went from 42 band down to 21 band. Some of the ones that you can use
now is Ivermectin which is avid. You can use Bifenthrin which is a termite
killer and use that typically for root aphids and so in some of the
testing we've seen over the course of the years that Bifenthrin was in maybe
65% of the Bay Area cannabis because of the hydroponic root aphid situation so
in a lot of these large cultural type media where they share things a root
aphid is just a savage predator to all of us and so typically we use funguses
and we inoculate and it kills it from a fungal point of view where actually
infects the plant I mean affects the the body of the creature itself and breaks
them down but Bifenthrin is a termite killer but it's a heavy carcinogen and
they're allowing some form of like a mosquito side and then that's a
pyrethrin based and then they're allowing something else for so the
promethium based the insecticide used for killer mosquitoes Bifenthrin was the
one that really caught my eye and Avid and now these things are things that we
like have been sifting out of the lab and excluding from dispensaries for the
whole time I've been in cannabis ever since I got into cannabis and we started
having lab tested cannabis these are some of the main things that were
disqualifying you from selling your product at the store and so now those
things are allowed in production for not consumption in smoke form but in edible
form and so if the cannabis is destined to be turned into a product made for
edibles any of those products are allowed to be found in trace amounts in
it which means that really you could probably use it on anything and if the
levels don't appear in it because if it was used by Bifenthrin all these things
typically using like nursery operations too so it changes the the way these
plants hold these toxins and residuals and it was just so weird to me because I
couldn't find substantiation in the California regs but this is all stating
other regulations through and Project CBD is usually pretty accurate and so
the the next one that caught my eye was where they were only going to check for
three major bacterial groups was E. coli, Aspergillus and Salmonella nothing else
nothing else they were going to look for in any way shape or form it didn't matter
what the yeast counts were it didn't matter what any other counts were you
could have up to 25% of the flower with visible mold and it was still sellable
and it was just kind of shocking because we just went through this
incredible purge on what could enter the system this year and what couldn't enter
the system so many of us are getting beat up at the events on fungal
levels and we're trying to learn how to comply with these fungal regulations and
now basically it's 25% of the product it it it was 25% of the product could have
fungal problems or any kind of coverage dirt contamination and you were allowed
to have on a gram was it maybe 3.5 within an eighth one drop of
incent mammalian excrement which means rat shit so if you had a chocolate bar
that was an ounce and he broke it up into 16 pieces four of them could be
covered in dirt four could be covered in mold and all of them had a single drop of
rat shit on it that's legal and it freaked me out so like it freaked me out
so much again this is just for edibles this is yeah this is a feeling that our
digestive system exactly break anything down and what they're using for cannabis
is tobacco and so what they did is they backed up so they took all these
different pesticides out of the program but they basically copied cannabis
treatment for pathogenic pressure for pest pressure using these chemical
families same as you can use in tobacco so they're marrying that but they pulled
aside all these others because you gotta remember avid is a great miticide
but it's designed for menthols and by finthrin is a termite killer that
toxifies the ground it's in and it makes it to where there's a residual that
stays in the plants it's one of those problems like my
commuter now where it's a it's a chemical family that lives in the tissue
of the planet a cellular level for a really long time and and so you have
these things that are known problems and it just tripped me out that we've been
preparing for this incredibly stringent regulated system and I'm worried that
we're not gonna see any cultivars make it into the system because the
regulations are gonna be so honest and lo and behold I go home last night and I
find out that everything that I'm preparing for is actually not even in
existence and no one I know has even seen any of this paperwork and so it's
on the net and it's current so it's just a question of you know what what
regulations are we following because I would like to know because if if you're
gonna have this type of situation occur it radically changes you know how you
approach all of it because if you're an organic farmer and they allow you to use
these tools and you have to compete at a price point do you use the tools or what
do you switch into growing because you're either toxifying the ground you
use them with some of this stuff and for a lot of individuals you know that's a
really that's the biggest market is the distillate market and so the distillate
market is the one that's really going to be the the most burgeoning as we go
forward and so it's one of the more crucial ones to have access into as it
grows and there it's almost too big right now to satisfy completely or you
wouldn't see so many people trying to grab the products that they grab and so
the ability to enter that market would be fantastic but the product that we
pass through because then it lets us use cultivars that are bulky and weighty and
come in on a good time frame and we're not worrying about the quality of the
flower appearance we just need to organically produce product or what we
believe to be California regulated product but now you can use stuff that
you have never been able to use in cannabis production in all the years
we've been selling cannabis and they started having lab tests avid was the
number one ingredient they went after first avid and then the other families
flora mites all these different chemical families that they've used to attack
bugs for time because once they get a resistance you got to switch to a new
family and so people have been rotating through this forbid pylon avid flora
mite and whatever other products they're using and so those were all these
families and now you're able to get back into some of this stuff and so it
changes a lot for us because for us that are organically minded where we ethically
want to grow clean pot but we're also trying to work under this situation
where I'm fighting spider mites with neem and you're fighting spider mites
with it with an over side it's a it's hard to kind of compete and so that's
the part that's tripping me out yesterday I figured we were all gonna
have a hard time because it was gonna be a very difficult situation to get
into now you have a hard time because you're gonna get to compete against
people who are using tools that you wouldn't use at your house you wouldn't
use at your home farm you know you can go you want to spray this in the
greenhouse that's great is that greenhouse in your yard because one of
the products when I looked up what it what it was connected to it was the
mosquito killer we use for Zika virus and it's allowed I'm not I couldn't
cross-reference what they were using a foreign egg so I couldn't find really
what were they using this for in what we do but they're allowed to use it and
it's connected to childhood development of the mental stuff so you're having
brain development issues and it was directly I could find that that link
popped right up but what it was used for outside of killing Zika virus it didn't
have an applicability so I couldn't I couldn't I have to get all the chemists
and say hey how do you what is this transfer and and I wonder if that's
coming from one department that of regulations like public health so it's
looking at what's legal to consume but then if you look at outdoor cultivation
regulations is that going to conflict in terms of what you're allowed to put in
the environment well so maybe that's only for indoor no it talked about it
it talked about it specifically saying that they couldn't believe they allowed
these things in the article they couldn't believe that these things were
allowed to pass through not because of the toxins to the people be because of
watershed damage so they it had it's fully known that the that the problems
that you have with these type of contaminants move downstream and then
migrate through the ecosystem and so that it's fully known I mean the article
revealing so if it's if it's the the full awareness of these products and
what they do and so I the financial concerns had to have affected this to
make that possible because it makes it so simple to grow fields because you
with a that you don't have might problems with a bit yeah you don't have
them you don't have root aphid problems with by finthrin it's termite killer
it'll kill termites if you can kill the termite you can kill a root aphid and so
when you have these tools and then you have high like synthetic pyrethium
creations to use as other bombs to utilize but they're also problematic in
there and what they do but those are incredible tools as pest control it's
just not for what we're allowed to use traditionally and then I'm not sure why
you use the mosquito killer because it didn't it just didn't tie in it I didn't
find a cross-reference on what are the pests that it killed other than you know
controlling mosquito populations and maybe maybe the areas around the place
they want to work with I'm not sure and I believe that the fungal sifting was
going to knock the living daylights out of the the totals but now when I read
this article last night I realized like wait a minute and I went back and look
through all the California stuff and I couldn't find the reconciliation but the
bottom line is if the laws are changing so fast that when I looked at the San
Francisco headline and it said one acre cap installed no commercial takeover
cannabis we all lauded the incredible victory by the time I got home it was in
Garbage I looked at the newspaper and got home and went on the internet and it
said cap completely wiped out so it it happened after it happened I mean first
they told us it it was good and we all celebrate for about 17 minutes and then
we read the news on another news service and it tells us no that's not real at
all and you don't have a cap at all and so when I read this I realized it must
be the same thing it's just too much velocity in what's taking place for any
one site to have all the information accurately because the California site
should be the most accurate when you go through I went through all the web
process I'm going through all these things like in as if I wasn't doing it
in real life and and I don't have people working with me so I'm just going
through it myself to see all the little pieces and understand this and and it's
a very it's a very complex system to get into the registry but all the
regulations you know it must be so complex that when you have in stuff like
this happen how do you update it this quick and change it because they're
still working off of I can use mean I can use my control I can use before see
barbaric I can use fungal controllers I think I can use some sulfur I can use
some potassium bicarbonate I'm talking a really restrictive organic regimen and
still what's up on the regulatory controls for the state and I couldn't
find these to reconcile but you know once you start to have the ability to do
this I mean you start to have an ability to you know we go through the whole list
and find out what else but these are incredible tools to change your
efficiency and effectiveness of growing cannabis on a large level so do you
think that it's something that you'd like to see stay in place or you know
would you like to see I mean the mold counts for one thing this seems like
it's only for edibles so you've got the whole anybody doing flour or even for
vape pens well we probably have to stay away from all of this soon so edibles is
not that large it's a good percentage of the market but edibles is still you know
a fraction of the whole pie so you know it's it'll be interesting to see but I
don't think it's the direction that people wanted to see that want to make
sure that the environment still being improved better than it has under the
black market yeah you know you'll have we'll you'll have a lot more control of
what they're saying but you you have if you're allowing this stuff it's a
progression that's how I see these things so yes edible production is maybe
say let's call it 20% of the pie here of what's what's going into because it's
gonna it's gonna be big because it's the delivery system people prefer that new
people that aren't smokers and consumption is clean it is no no stigma
to eating it and the quality of the edible products is incredible right now
and it's diversity and complexity so you know it's gonna it's gonna be big
and so the thing is that you you start to get people used to consuming products
that were never meant to be ingested period so so does that mean that the
nurseries that produce the clones that go to the farms that produce this do they
are they allowed to use that product to like is it if you can use it but is
there no we don't catch you with the residual it's okay meaning that we don't
mind if it's in your spray cabinet and it's in your spray logs it's just that
they can't come up hot on the product or we dequeue it you know so it starts
like a slippery slope of accountability on how you're growing agriculturally and
this whole thing with cannabis was basically this clean revolution of
people trying to say let's not destroy the watersheds in Humboldt let's not
destroy the watersheds in Mendocino let's not do all these things that are
traditionally done with industrial logging practices industrial mining
practices and so we were kind of held to that incredible stringency no sediment
runoff from your property so I mean everything must be contained that's
expensive and now all of a sudden if I decide that I want to produce distillate
which I recommend people to do because it's it allows you to get a simpler
product line into market then all of a sudden you're now spraying all over your
property all these chemicals and it's totally cool I'm so my neighbor next to
me above me on the watershed is now dumping this crap into his ground and
now we're gonna we're gonna toxify all the stuff that we just did all this work
on I'm not I don't want to do with the guy below me and so I think it's a
horrible thing because I think that they need to work on mold differentiation
better versus just saying look if your if your flower was covered with 25% of
dirt it's still allowed that's just that's just commercial that's treating
it like it's it's it's produce and the problem is is that it's it allows there
to be almost no handwork whatsoever because how can you compete at a price
point when you can when you can just basically cover your cannabis in mud
cover it in dirt because they're saying this is for edible pieces but it begins
25% of the market can be contaminated and we're not going to assume it's going
to change as it goes forward and and it's hard for us you know and we've been
we've been saying this is important as craft produces to have differentiation
and I still believe it is it's just that it is is is it possible to compete with
them if they can chemically get the cost so low because once we start to get this
into these lower basements all of a sudden it becomes a very difficult
situation to have craft cannabis if there's no pricing point and so I don't
know if they have the ability right now to drive this market so deep because the
infrastructure isn't fully established and then if all these added pesticides
are allowed in the marketplace and on farms you're gonna have a farm
inevitably that's working to be all organic and their neighbors using all
these things like avid and so you're gonna get drift so it causes a lot of
problems whereas before we thought that we really thought that cannabis was
gonna be held to a much higher standard than other agriculture and it sounds
like big AG and all its dirty practices are coming into cannabis really fast
yeah and if they had said to us you know a long time ago hey we're gonna do it
this way then then it would have influenced the entire regulation of the
call the codes and there's all this everything would have been the beginning
of like look look there's gonna be toxins everywhere and it didn't go like
that so what you have is you have the ability to grow for whatever market you
want and if you if you're medical you can go medical wrecking go wreck but if
you go and wreck you can go edible and if you're medical you can go edible and
so if you have a four acre you four APNs with four acres sitting next to each
other on it and you're using these products you at a level now you have to
follow protocol and it's gonna be spray logs and you're gonna have to go and get
a spray license like Pedro has and that'll that'll force you to do which is
everything that goes on the plant has been logged and sent to the the
regulatory control on the AG level over in Eureka now it'll go through the
cannabis board in addition so there'll be multiple people who are looking at
what you're doing but we've been doing it for a long time just because it
starts a protocol so you understand how to comply because it's complicated
everything in the zones and what was done and how much was used and then the
control practices and the time you have to wait to re-enter and all these
components go with it but when you start to be able to use chemical lag and in
products that were I don't mind it I wouldn't be so so tripped out on it if
it was chemicals that were meant for human consumption that were meant for
human consumption where even though I'm not a chemical guy it was at least
tested for people on health when they ate it but that's not what these
products are for these products are for non-ingestible and so when you're taking
killer and you're taking a miticide and other side that is ornamental based
horticultural based and is in these things are known toxins and you're just
saying it's okay it just kind of makes you wonder like what are what laws am I
preparing for and that's what I said yesterday I think that the small-scale
black market person who is able to just keep themselves alive in the interim
they'll probably survive more than anyone else will because everyone else
is is financially gonna have to compete and for all of us that are trying to do
an organic operation these kind of things make it difficult I like to
change in in molds but I don't like to change in 25% of the total product
could be covered in mold because now we're not looking at poverty mildew
which is lung irritant and we don't want that we would like to have levels of it
that are acceptable and fair and and those things can be worked out but when
it's just all right just cover it with dirt or any kind of foreign contaminant
so it could be covered in leaf material could be covered in this it doesn't make
a difference 25% of the flower so if you have a 1 gram flour 0.25 of it could be
dipped in in mud or you dip it in anything else you want and that's called
totally okay or molding with mold yeah 25% of the total so these are like that's
a lot you wouldn't buy that now if you bought a pound and 25% of it four ounces
were moldy you would be like whoa that's legal and so when it's trippy because I
think a lot of it is because of the penalties and so I started to take a
look I went back from here and so I looked at this thing and I went
into the penalty phases if you make a mistake with your permits and so you
have a level one a level two and a level three only a couple things give you a
level one which is the least punitive and there's a couple to give you a level
two but there is an ocean of them that give you a level three and a level three
was if you have pathogenic material on nursery plants meaning root aphids or
mites and so my thing is like well those are the two things that are the
most dominant pervasively used chemicals to control those two problems and when
you look at Bay Area cannabis traditionally you just like when you
look at you know outdoor Cush pot and then indoor Cush pot you see maybe up to
80% microbutyrenol contamination through lab tests if you're looking at Bay Area
hydro cannabis primarily you're looking at almost like 65% by fentanyl
you know over like the last couple years and so it's just so used because it's
just very effective and it's cheap and if you're trying to do with the way we're
doing it with with with fungal additives so that you can let the plants back it
off themselves in this form it doesn't ever really work you're in a perpetual
never-ending cycle of it and it's just what it is but that is a tool that
allows you to have an incredible efficiency so you never get a violation
you never any kind of issue and we've wondered all of us have wanted in all
the nursery guys we're all wondering how you're gonna pull this off because
everybody is judgmental on their their nursery operation but most people have a
couple trades of clones and a mom in the closet and they're like I can do a great
job but when you produce in 365 days a year and you're in any situation where
there's inclusion you end up having a very different situation occur and it's
tough to keep these things moving on this level and
the the ability to be able to protect yourself chemically from any kind of
violations and so we wondered how we were going to be able to work with some
of this and now I haven't had a chance to talk to any of the other nursery
operators I know yet just because when I read this but I'm like what we change is
everything because suddenly you know it's 25% of your nursery now for sale
only to food because can we back the whole chain up if it if we can use it on
producing the product then why wouldn't we be able to use it on producing the
clones that produce the product what's the difference it's all the same product
it's a track system so when can I apply the toxins where do they get applied in
this chain because they might as well get applied early if you're going to use
them late there's no difference and so you know a lot of this stuff is it's
competitive in different ways than you believe because it allows you to
efficiently control problems they're not don't bring your bottom line down but
keep you out of punitive financial punishments and regulatory and they can
go back seven years on this so with you know that's a good point that in terms
of records of your cultivation practices or even manufacturing any of
the licenses you have it's seven years of records and they have that seven
years to so you could get fined for something they're looking at that
happened seven years ago mm-hmm if your records aren't kept properly and then
you face fines that they come after you for and assess you fines and so you know
so much of this is important not to make these mistakes and it's just that
you know we we've all been under the same exact premise that we're gonna work
off of this extremely regulated I just spoke on a panel at the America about
microbial contamination and I was talking to a very intelligent lab
operator from one of the labs she was a speaker in the panel and we never we
never talked about they still talked about basically identifying mold levels
and working on score counts we understood that aspergillus had a
higher level of tolerance if it was to go to the edible market but they didn't
talk about 25% of the flower covenant and mold so I mean I'm not sure it's
hard to keep track if and I don't think that I'm so so good at pulling info off
the web I just happened to be up late last night at 4 in the morning and I
couldn't sleep and I pulled up this information and but it seems like it's
pretty accurate it makes sense and so it causes problems for all of us it it just
creates a situation where it absolutely favors a very specific production
methodology and we saw that with the unlimited canopy but we figured hey
they'd have to at least work off of some of the same operating standards and now
what you do is you get to use all these Salinas operations and all these Monterey
operations that are historically covered in these these things and so if they
can't get cannabis to pass because the soils by Fenthrin saturated well it
don't can and if they can't get things to remember these are all residuals and
so stuff that they've used for years and all these facilities and all these
places toxins just like a lot of the girl buildings in so hum that that had
equal 20 applied continuously that stuff is still active in the room and when
cannabis is grown in it pieces of it fall off the ceiling and literally land
on your flowers and it comes up hot as people go I'm not using it I don't know
why it's testing hot because the building had it sprayed in it prior if
you don't have UV it might take five years for that to break down and so we
don't see the same amount of it anymore because people sealed up their spaces
and you don't see the applications as much but the bottom line is we're all
working off of this incredible control system to do quality work and now we
just have to understand where we go
