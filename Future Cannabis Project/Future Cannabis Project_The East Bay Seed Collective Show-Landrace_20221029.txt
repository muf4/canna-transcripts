[00:01.470 --> 00:11.150]  All right, good morning, everybody. We are live with the East Bay Seed Collective show.
[00:11.150 --> 00:20.110]  Saturday morning, nine o'clock. And yeah, I'm a little tired. But we have a pretty sweet
[00:20.110 --> 00:28.830]  show. We have Party Gear coming in. Alex, he's somebody that's in the chat often. And
[00:28.910 --> 00:36.990]  I've been keeping, I follow him on Instagram. He has some really interesting techniques,
[00:37.630 --> 00:47.470]  some interesting breeding that he's doing. And he also has been doing some dry farming. And so
[00:47.470 --> 00:50.910]  I think that that is something that would be really interesting to talk about today.
[00:50.910 --> 01:03.570]  So my question is, what's everybody smoking on this morning? I'm smoking on some Flow.
[01:07.630 --> 01:20.710]  It's absolutely beautiful. Super frosty. Super frosty. I really like the high.
[01:23.190 --> 01:29.190]  Very motivational. You can get stuff done. Ah, John's smoking some Blue Dream. Nice.
[01:30.390 --> 01:38.550]  Um, yeah, I kind of like a love hate relationship with Blue Dream. Feel like at certain time,
[01:39.270 --> 01:45.750]  people were just pumping in so much Blue Dream that it made me really dreamy and tired. It
[01:45.750 --> 01:51.670]  could definitely be I guess, because it was done, overdone. But I mean, Blue Dream is fire.
[01:52.630 --> 01:57.190]  Blueberry Diesel. That sounds interesting. Sounds kind of like a Blue Dream.
[01:57.910 --> 02:04.310]  Um, but I mean, shoot, all those are all you know, at least half is DJ's work.
[02:05.830 --> 02:16.470]  Um, Dreadnought. I've never heard of that one. Um, I've never heard of that. Um, Pineapple.
[02:16.470 --> 02:21.990]  That sounds good. Nice and sativa-y. I notice often like the pineapple buds,
[02:22.390 --> 02:27.430]  yeah, Mad Dog. I'm curious, does the pineapple have like these really kind of like big, like airy,
[02:27.430 --> 02:32.390]  kind of like a pineapple type buds, like really big? I'm curious about that.
[02:34.710 --> 02:39.590]  Great Pie is fire. I don't know if I would smoke that in the morning. But I know it's potent.
[02:41.510 --> 02:47.190]  I've had Blue City Diesel before. That was interesting. Ocean Seeds, Dreadnought.
[02:47.990 --> 02:52.630]  Never heard of that one. I'm curious what's in the what's in the Dreadnought.
[02:55.670 --> 02:58.550]  Yeah, it looks like a lot of people are smoking some blueberry hybrids.
[02:59.430 --> 03:03.030]  Do I know the parents of Blue Dream are? Yeah, it's blueberry and haze.
[03:04.150 --> 03:13.830]  I believe it's a blueberry male and a haze female. I could be totally it could be it could
[03:13.830 --> 03:19.030]  be mixed up but it's definitely blueberry and haze. That's what Blue Dream is. Blue Dream is
[03:19.030 --> 03:27.510]  cool. It's just that a lot of times people will flower it past its ripe, its its peak date. And
[03:27.510 --> 03:32.870]  to me it makes it sleepy. But it probably I mean, I'm sure also makes it yield more and you know,
[03:32.870 --> 03:40.230]  the buds look even denser. But yeah, that's the thing with Blue Dream. Bubba's Dream.
[03:40.870 --> 03:47.910]  Never had Bubba's Dream, but sounds kind of sleepy to me. But you know, everybody has a different
[03:49.750 --> 03:56.470]  oh, yeah, yeah, haze blueberries, super silver haze blueberry. I don't recall which haze it is.
[03:56.470 --> 04:01.670]  It could be super silver haze. I gotta be honest. I just woke up. I'm kind of tired.
[04:02.470 --> 04:08.550]  But yeah, definitely haze and blueberry. I don't know, I think maybe Blue Dream will be making a
[04:08.550 --> 04:14.710]  comeback. I know for sure Sour is making a comeback. I grew a bunch of Sour outdoors this
[04:14.710 --> 04:23.430]  year. It came out killer. It looks great. It has the nose, it has the flavor, it has the effect,
[04:24.230 --> 04:32.950]  it has the yield. You know, I don't really know. Most people took yeah,
[04:32.950 --> 04:38.790]  Girl for Production took Blue Dream to 10 weeks. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's just it makes me so
[04:38.790 --> 04:42.950]  sleepy when it's when it's like that. I don't like I don't like to be really sleepy off of
[04:42.950 --> 04:49.110]  weed because like for me, when I would smoke Blue Dream, I would get super high and I would get
[04:49.110 --> 04:57.190]  super hungry. I would get super tired. Then I'd be have a headache. And then it would be gone.
[04:57.190 --> 05:04.390]  And that was within like two hours. And for my chemistry, that's just not it didn't work right.
[05:04.390 --> 05:10.150]  I like things like flow where it's like you're high for a while and then all of a sudden you're
[05:10.150 --> 05:14.390]  just not high anymore. You just notice that you're just not high instead of stuff that like makes you
[05:14.390 --> 05:20.390]  tired or, you know, super hungry or whatever. The stuff that makes you super hungry.
[05:24.870 --> 05:31.510]  Yeah, I mean, this is this is what I do. So I'm I mean, I'm on the bigger side. So like for me,
[05:31.510 --> 05:35.350]  weed that makes me super hungry is probably not the best thing. I mean, I don't need to
[05:35.350 --> 05:42.550]  be eating extra meals on the super late night. Also, strains that if I smoke them late at night,
[05:45.350 --> 05:50.070]  that like when I wake up the next day and I still feel high and like not rested, I don't like those
[05:50.070 --> 05:55.350]  kind of strains because I mean, I'll smoke all the time. So like for me, sour diesel is a really
[05:55.350 --> 06:01.590]  nice one. I can smoke at night. And when I wake up the next day, I don't feel really tired. I
[06:01.590 --> 06:07.830]  don't have these really weird high dreams or anything like that. I'm curious if other people
[06:07.910 --> 06:17.990]  have a similar experience with sour. Oh, grease monkeys fire for sure. What is that like a GG4
[06:19.990 --> 06:25.430]  exotic Mike something? But I know that, you know, I'm curious.
[06:27.350 --> 06:32.070]  Ex hippie is that was that outdoor that went 10 weeks or is that indoor?
[06:32.950 --> 06:39.030]  Um, yeah. Luckily, Mike, yeah, you love sour smoke smoking sour all day. I mean,
[06:39.910 --> 06:46.790]  another thing that's really nice about sour is that it it seems like it's hard to get a strong
[06:46.790 --> 06:52.950]  tolerance to sour so you can just smoke it all day. You can smoke sour it's cool. Actually,
[06:52.950 --> 06:57.830]  I may have even taken my sour a little too long because the weather was was too nice. I just
[06:57.830 --> 07:06.470]  couldn't help myself because like my sour is extremely potent. And I would almost argue a
[07:06.470 --> 07:12.390]  little too potent than what I really need. Like I smoke it and I'm just like, like my body feels
[07:12.390 --> 07:18.310]  like there's a lot of THC in my system. Oh, this bingo you're smoking headbanger by tangerine dream.
[07:18.310 --> 07:25.270]  I'm really curious about the headbanger. That's a what is that like a karma sour hybrid?
[07:27.830 --> 07:32.230]  I've done some I've grown some headbanger hybrids and they were it was pretty cool.
[07:33.350 --> 07:40.390]  Definitely had like the sour bud structure to it. That was cool. Yeah, big buds on her and
[07:40.390 --> 07:46.390]  outdoor living soil. Yeah, that was with the grease monkey. Yeah, no exotic Mike stuff is
[07:46.390 --> 07:53.510]  all the stuff I've seen from him has been really good has looked killer. Okay, so the headbanger
[07:53.510 --> 08:01.350]  is yeah, biker og by sat by sour D. My I've heard that biker og or what hell's angel og or whatever
[08:01.350 --> 08:13.770]  is like one of the original OGs. Interesting. Yeah, headbangers fire for sure. I have sour
[08:13.770 --> 08:22.970]  skunk sour diesel and Cam on deck. Yeah. I mean, as I get older, I it's I really do find myself
[08:23.290 --> 08:31.290]  going back to og cam dog sour. I really like them especially the og and the sour they they come out
[08:31.290 --> 08:38.810]  really nice outdoors. It gets you high you know every single time it has a good flavor. You know
[08:38.810 --> 08:44.010]  there's a reason why they've been around for so long. Which sour clone would you recommend? There's
[08:44.970 --> 08:54.550]  so many. That's a really good question. Um, personally, I don't see much difference in
[08:54.550 --> 09:02.390]  difference in the different sour clones. There could be smaller intricacies that I'm just not
[09:02.390 --> 09:14.950]  able to pick up on. But personally, excuse me. Personally, I'll run any sour cut. You know,
[09:14.950 --> 09:19.910]  I don't know, it might sound ignorant that I'm saying that but I just I don't see that much
[09:19.910 --> 09:26.390]  difference in the various sour cuts. The last kind of sour I got was from a cloner, you know,
[09:26.390 --> 09:33.750]  like a black market or traditional market cloner. And it was great. A couple years before I got a
[09:33.750 --> 09:41.910]  different cut of sour from some other person. It was equally it was good. Um, so I don't know. I
[09:41.910 --> 09:47.670]  mean, you know, in my seed collective, we have debates over the various sour cuts and you know,
[09:47.670 --> 09:53.430]  other people do see differences in the sour cuts. Personally, I don't see that much of a difference.
[09:53.430 --> 09:59.910]  For me, it's all about environment. It's just really about environment and just dialing in your
[09:59.910 --> 10:03.590]  environment. If the environment's not good, the sour is not going to come out good. If the
[10:03.590 --> 10:09.830]  environment's good, the sour is going to come out great. And also to be aware that sour is a difficult
[10:09.830 --> 10:14.630]  strain to grow. It's not a beginner strain. So like very, very often, if it's the first time
[10:14.630 --> 10:21.270]  you're growing sour, you're not going to crush it. Very often, it takes a few times to learn
[10:21.270 --> 10:28.550]  how to grow sour properly. It's not the same as a lot of other plants. If you're you know,
[10:28.550 --> 10:34.230]  into growing sativa hybrids, it's probably not that difficult to grow. But if you know,
[10:34.230 --> 10:39.350]  if you're used to growing like cookies or mostly indoor stuff, and then you start getting into
[10:39.350 --> 10:44.790]  growing sour, it's just a different, it's a different beast. And I'll describe how it's a
[10:44.790 --> 10:48.230]  different beast. So the first thing is how it's a different beast is when it's a sativa. So like it
[10:48.230 --> 10:52.550]  stretches a lot, it'll usually stretch three times. What that means is like when it goes into flower,
[10:53.350 --> 10:58.630]  it's going to be three times as large as it was before. Where it's going to be three times as
[10:58.630 --> 11:05.270]  large when it goes into flower. When it goes into flower, when it finishes flower, it will be three
[11:05.270 --> 11:10.870]  times as big as when it started. And you need to make sure that you have the right spacing for
[11:10.870 --> 11:17.910]  indoor. Also for sour, it likes and this is my take on other you know, there are definitely people
[11:17.910 --> 11:23.190]  who do it in different ways. But sour likes a bigger pot, you want to put sour diesel in a
[11:23.190 --> 11:28.390]  fairly large pot because even though it is a sativa at certain times, like it's going to get
[11:28.390 --> 11:33.830]  big and the buds will get big and they're going to get denser than most sativas. There's also
[11:33.910 --> 11:40.790]  certain times in the sour's life when you really can feed it a lot and it can take a fair amount
[11:40.790 --> 11:48.790]  of food. And what I would argue is less than, it's less about giving it like large amounts of food,
[11:48.790 --> 11:56.710]  but more about a slow consistent amount of food. And as the plant ramps up into its
[11:57.350 --> 12:03.750]  sixth, seventh, eighth week of flowering is when you really can start boosting the feeding and the
[12:04.310 --> 12:10.630]  phosphorus and potassium for sour diesel. When you have it dialed in,
[12:13.030 --> 12:17.910]  you can give it bloom boosters at, I like giving him bloom boosters at like week,
[12:17.990 --> 12:24.790]  gosh, seven, eight, nine, I'm thinking nine, eight, nine, 10, 11, seven, eight, nine or so.
[12:25.830 --> 12:33.910]  And you'll be very pleased with the growth that comes out of those sour plants and like the lower
[12:33.910 --> 12:40.950]  buds get really, really big, the bigger buds get huge. But I mean, the main thing of why sour is
[12:40.950 --> 12:45.430]  so awesome and you get such a nice yield is because the lowest buds, what I call the lowest
[12:45.430 --> 12:49.910]  yield is because the lowest buds, what I call like the larf, like the littles,
[12:49.910 --> 12:57.110]  those can go in a pound bag. The littlest, tiniest buds have bag appeal to them.
[12:57.110 --> 13:01.830]  Are we saying, yeah, week seven feed like crazy. Yeah. Like there's a certain time those plants,
[13:01.830 --> 13:06.230]  they really get big. And once the momentum comes, once the momentum builds, they,
[13:06.230 --> 13:12.150]  their metabolism can consume a lot of phosphorus and potassium. What I would argue is that
[13:12.790 --> 13:19.190]  initially they don't want as much food. So when the plant is small, it's not going to be as hungry,
[13:19.190 --> 13:26.950]  but as the plant literally gets bigger and the tissue mass, the mass of plant material gets
[13:26.950 --> 13:32.550]  bigger and bigger and bigger with plants like sour, it can get pretty big when they really go
[13:32.550 --> 13:39.270]  in the flower, you can push them and really get some nice buds that are really fat and still have
[13:39.350 --> 13:44.230]  that have a good flavor to it. Cause you know, often when people push their buds,
[13:44.230 --> 13:49.190]  it, the phosphorus and potassium leaves a flavor. That's, that's not something that
[13:50.070 --> 13:53.430]  is desirable, but with sour usually can metabolize by the plant.
[13:53.990 --> 14:00.070]  So this person talking about sour BX2 from karma put in the ground, not sure about putting
[14:01.030 --> 14:05.270]  out the plant looks so bad. Yeah. I mean, like I said, like sour, it's a finicky plant. Like
[14:05.990 --> 14:14.150]  with sours, I would often grow maybe 20% more than I needed, especially with indoor,
[14:14.150 --> 14:19.830]  I would do 20% more plants than I needed. And then like the weakest 20% you would kind of call,
[14:19.830 --> 14:23.910]  especially like if you're growing indoors, because what's going to happen is as the sour starts to
[14:23.910 --> 14:30.070]  stretch, any of the weaker plants are going to get totally overshadowed by the, by the bigger ones.
[14:30.710 --> 14:37.190]  So it's you know, so any plant that's not able to really hold its own
[14:37.750 --> 14:44.310]  gets kind of pushed out of the scene. Swap living soul for earth boxes. Yeah. You know,
[14:44.310 --> 14:51.910]  I really, I've used earth boxes before. I like them. I'm definitely an organic guy. I don't
[14:51.910 --> 14:56.550]  really use bloom boosters or anything like that. I mean, I liked to sometimes, but
[14:56.950 --> 15:04.150]  I don't generally use those kinds of things. Yeah. I mean, if you're using, if you're using
[15:04.790 --> 15:09.110]  living soil, I like that. I feel like the buds came out, come out really good.
[15:09.990 --> 15:13.750]  One, my only, there's a couple of beefs that I have with living soil.
[15:14.310 --> 15:20.310]  One of them is most of the recipes are designed for indoor growing and indoor grow and indoor
[15:21.270 --> 15:27.510]  growing. You're using lights, outdoor using the sun and the sun is so much more powerful. So
[15:27.510 --> 15:33.110]  I feel like you need to adjust your living soil recipes for outdoor gardening and they need to be
[15:33.750 --> 15:41.190]  more concentrated or more potent to get the plant from all the way to harvest. Now there's,
[15:41.190 --> 15:46.470]  there's a million different living soil recipes. So like, I'm not going to say like, Oh, like this
[15:46.470 --> 15:53.350]  one or whatever. I've just noticed that if you're using one of those recipes, you really do need to
[15:53.350 --> 15:59.110]  do it on the, the, the hotter side or the stronger side. So for example, I've used the, what do they
[15:59.110 --> 16:05.110]  call it? Vic high or sub cool super soil recipe. I really liked that one. It's, I call it like a
[16:05.110 --> 16:12.470]  meat and potatoes kind of recipe uses the blood meal, bone meal, bat guano, Epson salt. It's
[16:12.470 --> 16:18.630]  pretty hot, pretty salty. You want to compost it, but when you compost it, everything breaks down
[16:18.630 --> 16:26.390]  is very available. I've taken the sub cools mix and I put that on top for flowering time
[16:27.430 --> 16:34.310]  for outdoor. It worked great. Usually with that super soil recipe, you, you might put in like the
[16:34.310 --> 16:42.870]  bottom one, you know, fourth of the container, but you know, for outdoor, we would just top dress
[16:42.870 --> 16:52.950]  with pretty much a hundred percent super soil. It worked great. The one thing about that one is you
[16:52.950 --> 16:59.110]  want, you need to time it properly and put in the right amount of blood, blood meal, because the
[16:59.110 --> 17:04.150]  blood meal keeps the plant very green and you want it to fade out at the right time. Cause if
[17:04.150 --> 17:08.710]  you fade it out at the proper time, then your plants have this beautiful color. If you don't,
[17:09.430 --> 17:15.190]  then your plants are green the whole time and there's no way to really bleach out the blood
[17:15.190 --> 17:21.270]  meal. Yeah. But harders do have a bad taste to me as well. I can, I can taste it instantly. It's,
[17:21.270 --> 17:28.390]  it's extremely disappointing tasting, but hardness for sure. This person talking about Koots mix,
[17:28.390 --> 17:32.870]  Koots mix is also a great recipe. I mean, that's basically, it's like, I call that like the ocean
[17:32.870 --> 17:41.830]  recipe where it's like crab meal and shrimp, lots of calcium, neem seed, kelp. That's a really killer
[17:41.830 --> 17:52.790]  mix as well. My beef with that mix is I feel like it's not the right mix for veg personally. And
[17:53.110 --> 17:57.590]  people, this one person that I used to work with that used that mix, we would use that mix for
[17:57.590 --> 18:02.550]  veg and we would use that mix for flour. And I felt that during veg, there was really an excess
[18:02.550 --> 18:07.990]  amount of nitrogen in the mix that we were using. And, you know, of course we could like, you know,
[18:07.990 --> 18:13.030]  I would recommend cutting that mix in half. So, you know, when we veg, we would just do,
[18:13.670 --> 18:19.990]  you know, 50% Koots mix, 50% soil. But you know, some people, they just run it the whole time. So
[18:20.070 --> 18:23.910]  like my friend and, you know, my, the person I worked for, he was like, no, the plants can handle
[18:23.910 --> 18:29.030]  it. And they totally could. During veg, they were really dark green and I felt like they grew
[18:30.870 --> 18:38.550]  slower. But you know, once they got bigger, once they got big enough to take the amount of food
[18:38.550 --> 18:45.190]  that was in the soil, I mean, at that point they really took off. They grew very well. They were
[18:46.150 --> 18:50.390]  extremely healthy. They were, but you know, they're pest resistant. And what I thought was
[18:50.390 --> 18:55.350]  the coolest was that it had a very particular taste to it. So at this point I was living in
[18:55.350 --> 19:01.030]  Washington and Seattle, and I would argue that those buds had like this oceany type of flavor
[19:01.030 --> 19:09.430]  to it. And they were also extremely, extremely potent, extremely potent. So yeah, I mean,
[19:09.430 --> 19:14.390]  that's kind of my take on the Koots mix. I'm still old school. And you know, people say like,
[19:14.390 --> 19:20.710]  you can use the mix for multiple years. Like you don't need to like re-amend it. And
[19:23.910 --> 19:29.030]  I'm still like, you know, a farmer that believes in, you know, putting NPK in the soil and that
[19:29.030 --> 19:35.830]  it needs that. I could be totally wrong. You know, I'm not a soil scientist. You know,
[19:35.830 --> 19:39.910]  I'm just, it's just a conversation, you know, like, like this person saying, it's really just
[19:39.910 --> 19:49.750]  a conversation. There's another mix. So yeah, the Koots mix is good. You know, like the Rev has a
[19:49.750 --> 19:58.230]  mix, which is interesting. Oh, okay. One second. So if I'm this here, okay, here's the other thing
[19:58.230 --> 20:06.630]  I was going to say. So I used to work here, Berklander Garden. And you know, we would give
[20:06.630 --> 20:11.750]  people advice on what to grow their plants in. You know what I mean? Like people would come in
[20:11.750 --> 20:15.670]  the shop and be like, okay, I have these plants for this year. What fertilizer should I use?
[20:16.310 --> 20:23.510]  And you know, for me, the easiest one was BioLive. It's from down to earth. It's a 5-4-2.
[20:23.510 --> 20:28.710]  It's great for veg. I've used it for 20 years. I don't just use it for cannabis. I use it for
[20:28.710 --> 20:33.110]  everything in the garden. Once, I've probably said this a million times. Once I see a yellow
[20:33.110 --> 20:38.070]  leaf on a plant, I just take a handful of BioLive and throw it on the soil. It's really that easy.
[20:38.070 --> 20:46.070]  It's very, very, very simple. And what we noticed is that there are often people who
[20:49.430 --> 20:54.950]  who would use just BioLive the whole time. Very, very often. They would not use a bloom,
[20:54.950 --> 20:59.110]  but they wouldn't use like any kind of flowering formula. It would just be
[20:59.670 --> 21:09.350]  BioLive. And there are actually some very legit breeders who argue that all you really need to
[21:09.350 --> 21:13.590]  use is BioLive the whole time. And the plants don't need that much phosphorus. They don't need
[21:13.590 --> 21:18.630]  that much potassium. And particularly for outdoors, you know, as long as they have enough nitrogen,
[21:18.630 --> 21:22.390]  they stay green until they need to. They have, you know, the minimal amount of phosphorus and
[21:22.630 --> 21:28.150]  potassium, they'll do just fine. I observed that from experience for sure. You know,
[21:28.150 --> 21:32.310]  like sometimes I'll put plants out early. Sometimes we'll have breeding plants, whatever.
[21:32.310 --> 21:37.750]  There are many plants that you can, you know, that I'll just put on BioLive and don't put any,
[21:37.750 --> 21:41.910]  you know, flowering formula and they still come out just fine. They still have, you know,
[21:42.470 --> 21:48.630]  solid buds. They still have, you know, they still look fine. So,
[21:48.870 --> 21:54.630]  you know, there is always that, that, you know, maybe a lot of these things are unnecessary.
[21:57.990 --> 22:01.990]  You know, that's always something to keep in mind. And especially like if you are doing
[22:01.990 --> 22:05.910]  something on a really large scale, like imagine, you know, if you're saving
[22:07.030 --> 22:10.950]  tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars on phosphorus and potassium,
[22:12.470 --> 22:14.390]  that, you know, that could be the difference.
[22:14.790 --> 22:22.230]  So, yeah, let's see what people are saying. Mammoth and insect frass. Yeah, I mean, I've
[22:22.230 --> 22:29.030]  used mammoth before. I can't say I know for sure if it works or doesn't work. I think insect frass
[22:29.030 --> 22:37.910]  is a, you know, is a good product. It's definitely expensive. Yeah, I mean, insect frass is a good
[22:38.070 --> 22:46.310]  product. It's definitely expensive. Yeah, I mean, insect frass is expensive. So, like, that's not
[22:46.310 --> 22:51.670]  awesome about it, but it does have a lot of chitin in it and it's very available and it's like super
[22:51.670 --> 22:59.430]  fine. So, that's really cool. There, I know for sure the, like, kutzmix has a lot of chitin in it.
[22:59.430 --> 23:05.270]  You know, if you have like the shrimp meal and the crab meal, you know, those shells are nice
[23:05.270 --> 23:11.190]  and the plant really likes that. It also breaks down slowly, which is good for your soil. It also
[23:11.190 --> 23:15.510]  has a lot of calcium and, you know, plants love, love, love calcium. Cannabis loves calcium.
[23:18.070 --> 23:30.190]  What's it saying? Fenoflander. Mammoth works, but not as good value for what you get in return.
[23:31.070 --> 23:44.910]  Oh, so on, who's, what is that? Tad? Is it Tad? Gosh, there's a soil company and I'm forgetting
[23:44.910 --> 23:56.110]  the name of the company, but this guy did, he looked at mammoth under a microscope
[23:57.070 --> 24:06.190]  and to see how active it was. And then he also took some mammoth and he fed the mammoth some
[24:06.190 --> 24:13.310]  sort of microbes. And after he fed the mammoth microbes, he found that it was more active,
[24:14.030 --> 24:18.750]  that there were more, that there were more of the microorganisms that you're looking for
[24:19.630 --> 24:26.990]  around. And I thought that that was really, really interesting. You know, that kind of the
[24:26.990 --> 24:31.790]  microbes are sleeping or there's not as many of them and that you can kind of wake them up and
[24:32.350 --> 24:36.990]  get them to be more active. And then once they're more active, it would then, you know,
[24:36.990 --> 24:44.670]  then add that to your soil. So, so yeah, I mean, I think there's something to be said about that.
[24:44.670 --> 24:52.910]  Cause I mean, my belief is that to get those microbes to be very active, you usually need to
[24:55.630 --> 25:01.470]  add something to them, make it nice and fresh. You need to make it fresh to get them alive
[25:01.470 --> 25:05.390]  and get them going and get them voracious and all of those sorts of things. And when it's sitting
[25:05.390 --> 25:11.790]  in a little bottle, it's not, it's not meant to do that. It's meant to be living in soil and eating
[25:11.790 --> 25:18.430]  and pooping and dying and procreating and all of those things. So, you know, I think there could be
[25:18.430 --> 25:24.190]  something to taking your mammoth pea and kind of waking it up to then feeding it to your plants.
[25:24.990 --> 25:28.750]  There's definitely similar things that people will do with their compost tea. So for example,
[25:28.750 --> 25:35.230]  with the compost tea, especially for like a veg, often what I will do is I'll have like my compost,
[25:35.230 --> 25:42.510]  my worm castings and whatever, and you know, you bubble that for a day or two days. And then
[25:43.870 --> 25:48.830]  right before you're going to add it to your soil, sometimes I'll add some like fish meal to it.
[25:48.830 --> 25:53.950]  What the fish meal will do is like explode the biological population.
[25:56.270 --> 26:01.550]  In about 10, 15 minutes, that biological population is going to explode. If you add
[26:01.950 --> 26:09.390]  right at that time, it, you know, adds the peak amount of those microbes to your soil. If you
[26:12.510 --> 26:20.110]  peak and then you leave it, it will then, the population will go back down.
[26:23.310 --> 26:27.390]  Hey, I'm sorry, I guess I'm missing whatever the fight is in the chat.
[26:27.950 --> 26:32.110]  Um, but, you know, let's, let's be
[26:34.990 --> 26:39.630]  respectful to each other. And, you know, we're here to learn. I mean, that's really what this
[26:39.630 --> 26:45.950]  is about. Yeah, that's, that's what this is about. And yeah, you know, in the chat,
[26:45.950 --> 26:49.950]  if you guys have a question for me, you know, shoot it out. I thought we were gonna have
[26:50.270 --> 26:56.910]  um, um, hard to gear coming on. Maybe there was a miscommunication, but, um, you know,
[26:56.910 --> 27:00.510]  I'm still hopeful that, that he's coming on. Maybe he'll come on at 10 o'clock today.
[27:01.310 --> 27:10.190]  Um, but yeah, I mean, that's, you know, that's just my take on that. Um, I have taken a plant,
[27:10.190 --> 27:17.550]  plant, what is that? Oh my God, my brain is not working today. I've taken a plant nutrition class
[27:17.550 --> 27:21.070]  and I would highly recommend everybody take one who's really into this stuff.
[27:21.070 --> 27:24.670]  I'd also say those plant nutrition classes are difficult and it's a lot of chemistry.
[27:25.390 --> 27:38.420]  Um, hello. Hey, let's see. Let me see if I can shut that off. Sorry. I was sitting there in the
[27:38.420 --> 27:44.900]  backstage and I haven't been on a freaking stream yard in over a year and missed a little, enter the
[27:44.900 --> 27:49.060]  studio, put your name in here, tabs. I'm like, when's he bringing me on? I heard you asking,
[27:49.060 --> 27:54.660]  I wouldn't be showing up. I'm like, I did something wrong. Yeah, no, no worries. I'm
[27:54.660 --> 28:00.340]  glad to have you on. Um, I just want to say thank you for coming on. I appreciate you taking the
[28:00.340 --> 28:07.780]  time. Um, I guess a quick background. I got some seeds from, Oh my God, I'm forgetting the person's
[28:07.780 --> 28:15.060]  name. And there was a sample pack of yours in there. And so then I contacted you and asked you
[28:15.060 --> 28:18.580]  about it. I don't know if you remember this was a while back and you were super nice and explained
[28:18.580 --> 28:25.700]  to, you know what it was about is the heart of gear, hardcore, the hardcore. Yeah. Yeah. That's,
[28:25.700 --> 28:31.460]  um, that's a dedication strain for, for, um, a best friend who went hiking one day and never
[28:31.460 --> 28:36.500]  came back. And, uh, I decided that that would be one of my first real dedication strains to
[28:36.500 --> 28:41.860]  somebody. And, uh, I wanted to be able to grow something that grew on the side of the mountain,
[28:41.860 --> 28:49.780]  where he went missing and kind of have a ritual, you can call it a ritual, cannibalistic, uh,
[28:49.780 --> 28:54.820]  spiritual experience when going commune with them. Right. So I wanted to be able to broadcast the
[28:54.820 --> 28:58.900]  seed out on the side of the mountain and it would take up the nutrients is that since that we still
[28:58.900 --> 29:04.980]  never recovered his body, um, years later. Right. And so that that's, that's what that strain was.
[29:04.980 --> 29:12.420]  And his name was hardcore. That was his, um, his nickname that everybody knew him as, and, uh,
[29:12.420 --> 29:18.820]  Corey Ehlers is his real name, but yeah, so I worked at for three years, get to the fifth
[29:18.820 --> 29:24.420]  generation and went to write down the moniker for the seed name. The N an abbreviation is THC,
[29:24.420 --> 29:30.420]  the hardcore, like this is like, so meant to be, but it's a land, it's a land race back,
[29:30.420 --> 29:36.980]  cross into a poly hybrid, which is kind of one of the things that I'd like to come on here and
[29:36.980 --> 29:43.860]  talk to folks about. Definitely. Let's, I mean, that's, um, yeah, I mean, I think that you're
[29:43.860 --> 29:48.820]  known for making land race poly hybrids. I'm really curious what land races do you like to
[29:48.820 --> 29:55.140]  work with? You know, there's a whole bunch of them and, you know, we can start with like, like, um,
[29:56.100 --> 30:01.060]  we can start with defining land race, right? And that's something that, um, a lot of people,
[30:01.860 --> 30:06.900]  there's last week I heard you saying with Khalifa, you're talking about how, how, you know,
[30:06.900 --> 30:16.420]  there's this, there's this, uh, uh, illusion or fantasy of, of the lost land race and the missing
[30:16.420 --> 30:22.420]  or the, these, these strains from the far off lands. And they, that we're going to find some
[30:22.420 --> 30:28.820]  magical plants in a wild population. Right. And, and so when we use this term land race,
[30:28.820 --> 30:35.860]  there's a whole bunch of different positions in genetic refinement that that could be referring
[30:35.860 --> 30:41.780]  to. And I like to classify starting off with what I like to call a true land race, which would be
[30:41.780 --> 30:49.060]  the wild original, um, plants that have adapted to their location over long periods of time.
[30:49.060 --> 30:54.500]  And so these would, you know, and we're talking thousands and thousands of years, we have,
[30:54.500 --> 30:59.620]  we have feral populations that have adapted, right. And that could be hundreds of years, right.
[31:00.180 --> 31:05.780]  Um, we've got, um, the term land race originated from,
[31:08.740 --> 31:12.820]  it was about, I can't remember the exact name, uh, year, but there was, there was a conference of,
[31:12.820 --> 31:17.540]  uh, horticulturists in Germany and they used it because they would go around the world in,
[31:17.540 --> 31:23.220]  in 1700s and creating these herbariums and greenhouses for, uh, national societies or
[31:23.220 --> 31:26.100]  whatever they were, they were collecting all the plants around the world. And then
[31:26.100 --> 31:29.940]  people society were having these gardens and, and, but they started realizing like,
[31:29.940 --> 31:32.740]  we're going to have interbreeding of plants around the world. We're going to have,
[31:32.740 --> 31:36.900]  we're hybridizing stuff. And at that point they were realizing whatever the plants were,
[31:36.900 --> 31:42.020]  we need to preserve the land. They used the word land race or the plants that originated on the
[31:42.020 --> 31:49.780]  landscape. And that was originally referring to both wild plants and their native populations,
[31:49.780 --> 31:57.940]  as well as what the main usage, which is the next step is, um, is agricultural
[31:59.780 --> 32:06.260]  seed stocks that had been worked on the land for time in memoriam, right. And as far as my
[32:06.260 --> 32:10.020]  grandfather's grandfather knows, this plant has been grown here and this was our agricultural
[32:10.020 --> 32:15.060]  stock. So that was come from a wild come into, and we now have these, these,
[32:17.220 --> 32:20.900]  they can be a regional heirloom at that time. Right. And you still have, you have these wild
[32:20.900 --> 32:25.620]  stocks that can, um, feral lands that can interbreed back into that. Right. And so they're
[32:25.620 --> 32:32.260]  selecting a male maybe. And, um, we, we move forward into these more refined regional heirlooms
[32:32.260 --> 32:38.260]  that, um, have a lot more refinement and might be moved away from, from feral wild stocks and,
[32:38.260 --> 32:43.380]  and become very distinct in their regions. Um, and, and then we have what we have,
[32:44.020 --> 32:50.180]  we'd like to be buying as seed purchasers and growers at home with someone taking those wild
[32:50.180 --> 32:55.540]  regional or those, those fairly loose shaggy regional heirlooms are still pretty rough stocks
[32:55.540 --> 33:00.500]  are only made for making field hash, right? They're not a refined smoking plant. And somebody
[33:00.500 --> 33:06.900]  goes in and selects some seed stock from that and refines that into an IVL presentation. It could
[33:06.900 --> 33:12.100]  even be an open pollinated, but it's concentrated and bottlenecked into something that we refer to
[33:12.100 --> 33:17.540]  as a smoking stock as opposed to a hash plant. Right. So we've got these different, and someone
[33:17.540 --> 33:22.420]  can take that even further and I bill it in even further, right. There's these different levels of
[33:22.420 --> 33:28.180]  what actually constitutes what we're talking about as a, um, um, a land race. And I've grown
[33:28.180 --> 33:33.700]  all of these from completely wild feral been growing there for 600 years. And I'm trying to
[33:34.260 --> 33:40.740]  beast to stuff that's gone through a couple of breeders hands and refined. And like you were
[33:40.740 --> 33:44.260]  saying last week, that's the stuff you're leaning towards, right. And your work. And that is,
[33:44.820 --> 33:48.900]  that is the stuff that's more preferable for people for smoking and growing and utilizing
[33:48.900 --> 33:54.820]  and breeding projects. And, um, so yeah, that's, that kind of leans towards where I like is like
[33:54.820 --> 34:01.700]  things like the PCK that have been inbred 12, 13 generations from the field. Um,
[34:02.900 --> 34:08.500]  that, um, right now I have, uh, Belvia stock. Let me see if I can,
[34:11.220 --> 34:16.100]  right. This is, this is Moroccan Highlands and I grew this as a completely different thing. And I,
[34:16.100 --> 34:19.700]  right. So this is, um, I got some hybrid, hybrid here in Freeman.
[34:19.860 --> 34:24.180]  This stuff right here, again, the Belvia we showed it last week. Um, and I'm going to be probably
[34:24.180 --> 34:29.620]  processing it tomorrow or earliest week. Um, I do some tests on it to see whether I do it live on,
[34:29.620 --> 34:37.140]  on my paradigm shift tomorrow. Um, but, um, I grew this as a cancer medicine for my daughter's
[34:37.140 --> 34:44.420]  mother, but I wanted to show people also that we can direct seed into decent soil without any water
[34:44.580 --> 34:50.740]  without any water at all. This was grown. Um, I watered the seed in cause we didn't get a snow,
[34:50.740 --> 34:58.820]  a rainstorm. And, um, I watered most of the crop once in, in, in the last week of August
[34:58.820 --> 35:07.060]  and then harvested mid September. And, um, you can see some pretty nice, let's see, here's
[35:08.020 --> 35:12.820]  some, some pretty nice colas coming off of this stuff. And some of it was quite frosty bean. First
[35:12.820 --> 35:20.260]  time I've really grown this one to full term. Uh, and I'm only my second run of selection. I might
[35:20.260 --> 35:27.060]  not have had the very best across the board. Uh, but, uh, yeah, it's a nice three to one. There's
[35:27.060 --> 35:34.740]  probably 12% nice mild, there's piney, there's, there's some lemon scents coming off of it.
[35:35.060 --> 35:39.220]  Again, this traditionally is a hash plant or like Khalifa was saying, they, they would,
[35:39.220 --> 35:44.660]  um, roll it up and smoke it. This is a low grade plant. And that's something I found
[35:45.620 --> 35:51.220]  that three to one, two to one, three to one is what a lot of these native plants were. Um,
[35:54.260 --> 36:00.180]  I've got about 40 different land race in my repertoire or in my, in my, uh, I had not gotten
[36:01.140 --> 36:11.940]  all of them run through and definitely again, the closer to wild or native, you know, just field
[36:11.940 --> 36:19.780]  plants or et cetera, there are tougher to find something worth working with as far as just
[36:19.780 --> 36:25.620]  growing that plant and getting yourself something to smoke. But if you're a true breeder or somebody
[36:25.620 --> 36:30.020]  who really, really, really wants to understand the cannabis plant, I encourage everybody to do
[36:30.020 --> 36:34.980]  that and find the most wild seed they can at least once. So they gain a better understanding
[36:34.980 --> 36:44.820]  of the plant in general. Um, yeah, I would do it. I would completely agree. Um, you know,
[36:45.540 --> 36:50.180]  growing. So for example, I grew the whaling Valley shoot. That was maybe three years ago.
[36:51.140 --> 36:59.380]  And, um, you know, the bud was, it was all right, but the plant was really enjoyable to grow.
[36:59.380 --> 37:05.300]  It was really fun. And it was actually a great learning experience to see the very, the variation
[37:05.300 --> 37:12.100]  in vigor and pest resistance and non pest resistance compared to the, the commercial
[37:12.100 --> 37:18.740]  varieties or like the farm polyhybrids basically. And what I found the most interesting was that
[37:19.060 --> 37:22.420]  they were, they did not, they didn't need to be fertilized that much at all. They didn't
[37:22.420 --> 37:28.580]  need to be watered that much. They didn't need to be staked up. Um, but there were some
[37:30.020 --> 37:36.980]  other viruses or pests that I felt like they were susceptible to that the polyhybrids weren't
[37:36.980 --> 37:41.780]  and kind of vice versa. So like the land race varieties didn't get any powder mildew,
[37:42.740 --> 37:50.740]  but I noticed they did get some weird, like bull tritis on the stem sometimes. Right. Right. Right.
[37:50.740 --> 37:56.100]  Like some like weird, like rust every once in a while, like these really weird things that most
[37:56.100 --> 38:00.980]  of the plans didn't get, but they would get them. Like they almost had like a different immune
[38:00.980 --> 38:07.220]  system. Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. And look, so you're growing them in a very different location
[38:07.860 --> 38:14.420]  from where the high Himalayas, where they, the whaling Valley's at. Right. And then we're mostly
[38:14.420 --> 38:19.300]  looking for smoking flowers. And sometimes we're looking for something we can wash out. Right.
[38:19.300 --> 38:23.220]  And that particular plant is neither of those that's designed for there being thousands of
[38:23.220 --> 38:27.300]  them. They're taking little, the little flowers and sitting in the shade and rubbing the chatter
[38:27.300 --> 38:32.420]  Ross off of them. Right. And so understanding that's what that one is particularly, but then
[38:32.980 --> 38:39.140]  looking at those good traits that you said you found, and then sometimes we've taken these
[38:39.140 --> 38:45.860]  polyhybrids and we've bred out that PM resistance. We've bred out that SIM strength. We've bred out
[38:46.500 --> 38:50.900]  those other things, right. That you mentioned aren't there that they show.
[38:50.900 --> 38:56.660]  And that's one of the things where I talk about breeding the wolf back into the, the, the
[38:57.220 --> 39:04.100]  show dog. Right. And you're going to try and get those traits back in when you're selecting for
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.860]  your location, your environment, and trying to get the tail water to come out,
[39:10.740 --> 39:16.340]  express the benefits. And of course we select, you got to grow big enough populations. And,
[39:16.340 --> 39:21.220]  and so we tend to create, we tend to create heirlooms more than actually do breeding
[39:21.220 --> 39:25.220]  what we're doing. Right. Without having the science and the large numbers of them.
[39:25.780 --> 39:30.980]  But that's, that's what, so any, any land race, that's why I tell people, like, if you're a
[39:30.980 --> 39:35.380]  breeder, you can utilize these things as a toolkit. Right. And there's, there's things
[39:35.380 --> 39:43.140]  that you can use that aren't going to be part of our modern dispensary. You're not going to grow
[39:43.140 --> 39:46.580]  that old, that, that wild land racing and put it in a dispensary, no matter how much of it you
[39:46.580 --> 39:50.900]  produce and stuff. And people are just going to look at it and go, what? Right. And even you
[39:51.860 --> 39:57.780]  couldn't afford to produce enough of it to create a charas and sell a talent of it. Right. It's,
[39:57.780 --> 40:02.180]  which is a day's production. Usually a couple of grams is what they do in the field. We can
[40:02.180 --> 40:08.340]  proper high grade cream. No, for sure. But I mean, like, as far as like breeding with them,
[40:08.340 --> 40:14.260]  like what you're saying, like the Wailing Valley breeds extremely recessive, you know, like it
[40:14.340 --> 40:20.500]  really lets whatever else pass through it. It does have a few like interesting kind of wild
[40:20.500 --> 40:25.460]  traits that will pop in here or there, which are cool, but it really does let whatever else that,
[40:25.460 --> 40:30.420]  whatever else you're working with really pass through, which is a great trait. And also, you
[40:30.420 --> 40:38.900]  know, I, I would argue people who do like corn breeding, they've, you know, they've worked so
[40:38.900 --> 40:44.660]  far ahead that now what they're doing is literally taking the oldest maize varieties that
[40:44.660 --> 40:51.220]  they can find, saving those and then trying to work that back into what we call now as corn to
[40:51.220 --> 40:57.460]  make it productive. Right. So that doesn't have all these crazy things that are happening to it.
[40:58.020 --> 41:05.380]  Also, I really believe in staggering my outdoor harvest. And one of the things that I've done
[41:05.380 --> 41:10.980]  really believe in staggering my outdoor harvest. And one of the best ways to do that is to grow
[41:11.540 --> 41:19.300]  landrace heirloom, different things than cookies and og and all those things, because for me,
[41:19.300 --> 41:23.540]  they all those ones came in within a week or two of each other, they were all finished,
[41:23.540 --> 41:29.700]  and I don't have enough space to dry everything all at once, it really has to be staggered
[41:29.700 --> 41:36.260]  two weeks at a time. Right. You know, growing those kind of more wild, more interesting things,
[41:36.260 --> 41:38.980]  because it's something else that's really interesting. I mean, I'm sure you know this,
[41:38.980 --> 41:43.140]  but people in the chat may not know this is most of the wild stuff from what I've observed goes a
[41:43.140 --> 41:48.740]  lot longer than nine, 10, you know, it goes a lot longer, like I'm sure there are a few
[41:48.740 --> 41:55.380]  exceptions, but most of them in general are not eight weekers. Eight weeks is a product of
[41:55.380 --> 42:01.860]  prohibition, straight up, that was breeding in for indoors. That's where that came from. And
[42:01.860 --> 42:08.260]  nothing else. There is that's such an outlier and seed populations, even when you breed into short
[42:08.260 --> 42:14.020]  breeding stuff, that's a super recessive. And I find stuff that goes 45 and 50 days, it's not
[42:14.020 --> 42:17.700]  necessarily something we're going to use commercially. But you know, you can breed towards that.
[42:17.700 --> 42:21.860]  But that's something I've left in the way desk a long time ago, when I started realizing it's like,
[42:22.500 --> 42:27.700]  you know, as legalization comes forward, less and less and less HID is going to be getting used. And
[42:28.580 --> 42:33.700]  there's so many other aspects than just pumping out, because now we have warehouses the last
[42:33.700 --> 42:38.580]  years and the years before, just sitting there waiting for what, right? I'm at the point now,
[42:38.580 --> 42:42.420]  it's like, I'm going to practice more hash technique, and I'm starting to compost everything.
[42:43.540 --> 42:50.980]  And this is so freaking much, everyone's got more than they need. And what's the point?
[42:51.060 --> 42:56.580]  You know, yeah, so something a little bit different, something that's going to meet your
[42:56.580 --> 43:02.020]  local localities, weather and things and still come out wonderful, and be a local presentation.
[43:04.340 --> 43:07.460]  There's always good, you know, the mammoth companies are going to do their thing, but
[43:08.900 --> 43:13.460]  it took it took how many years for the beer companies here in Nevada to come back out
[43:13.460 --> 43:19.300]  and dispel the myth of the American Pilsner's being good beer. Right now we have how many
[43:19.780 --> 43:24.340]  hundreds of thousands of microbreweries. And so it's, we hang in there, that stuff will,
[43:24.340 --> 43:28.980]  it's a process to breed it, right? You're not just making an F1 and creating the,
[43:30.340 --> 43:36.420]  you'll find some in there. It depends on how refined your land race is, if it's a, you know,
[43:36.420 --> 43:40.580]  an IBL regional heirloom that you bought packs from someone who's been doing it for 30 years,
[43:41.540 --> 43:47.380]  or if it's a while. And that's, depending on who you are, you need to find out what that is when
[43:47.380 --> 43:51.620]  you're buying it, how inbred it is, if you want to grow something that's super wild or
[43:52.260 --> 43:55.540]  something's been refined. Right? I've got,
[43:58.660 --> 44:02.980]  here in North America, there isn't really a whole lot there. Start hearing people talk about hemp
[44:02.980 --> 44:10.580]  that went wild, being a land race. And it's my understanding of North American hemp, primarily
[44:11.140 --> 44:18.180]  it was eradicated completely with the new chemical, you know, sprays and stuff in the 30s.
[44:18.180 --> 44:25.140]  And they, by the 40s, they needed war effort and came back in with
[44:26.980 --> 44:31.620]  police, you know, stuff that was developed in college universities that originated from Chinese
[44:32.420 --> 44:37.380]  commercial stock. And so all the ditch weed in the U.S. is my understanding. And that's what that
[44:37.380 --> 44:43.380]  is. And so without doing some genetic testing to prove otherwise, I have a hard time calling that
[44:43.380 --> 44:53.860]  a land race. But when I ran the, I'm sorry, the Land Race Traders Club on Facebook, we did that,
[44:53.860 --> 44:59.460]  I think about three years. It was a spinoff from the Probiotic Farmers Alliance, and which I was
[44:59.460 --> 45:03.540]  one of the, for several years, one of their top educators in there teaching people organic. And
[45:03.540 --> 45:12.500]  so if folks don't know me, I actually started in 85, doing, treating people with medical cannabis
[45:12.500 --> 45:19.380]  and started planting seeds, 85, 86. And my first cancer patient was 86. And I got a degree in
[45:19.380 --> 45:25.700]  agriculture from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. And I started working out how to do dry farm stuff way
[45:25.700 --> 45:30.100]  the fuck back then. I've been arrested by all three North American governments for personal cannabis.
[45:30.100 --> 45:36.820]  I've never been a major, huge player or mover, but I believe in the medicine, the freedom to plant
[45:36.820 --> 45:42.580]  for everybody. And I've been working on that for a long time and advocating for a long time. And
[45:42.580 --> 45:50.740]  so a lot of this stuff is like old, deep knowledge and experimentation. And like I learned organic,
[45:50.740 --> 45:56.580]  my brother was a grower. He was Snoop Dogg's first production grower, and he hooked up a bunch of
[45:56.580 --> 46:01.220]  other musicians. And we went over to meet the, meet the Rottafaris one day, and they took me out
[46:01.220 --> 46:06.740]  to the garden and taught me about organics. And I was studying agriculture. And so everything, like
[46:06.740 --> 46:12.740]  I've been doing organic, and it's a lot harder organic to breed and find those, those producers
[46:12.740 --> 46:19.940]  and figure it all out. Right. And that's all we had in the 80s is a couple of city kids without
[46:19.940 --> 46:26.020]  connections to the triangle was just some, some land race that come in bag seed from the imports
[46:26.020 --> 46:32.340]  that were coming. And that's a whole nother thing that I tell people is like, figure it out,
[46:32.340 --> 46:39.860]  guy, find some of that low bag seed and grow it and see what it does and learn the plant that way
[46:39.860 --> 46:45.140]  by how you feel it out. You don't know what it is. I let us still grow volunteers and let them do
[46:45.140 --> 46:49.940]  their thing so I can understand and figure it and feel it as it grows and not have all this
[46:49.940 --> 46:53.780]  background information from all these growers, because that's how you really understand your
[46:53.780 --> 47:04.020]  nutrient deficiencies or excesses and etc. 100% I would completely agree that, you know,
[47:04.020 --> 47:09.780]  you can definitely get to know a strain and or like a line. And you know, you grow it out and
[47:09.780 --> 47:14.820]  you see what it likes and what it doesn't like and how it grows and you know, the various little
[47:14.820 --> 47:20.180]  quirks that it has kind of like a person. I mean, to me, that's kind of what it's like, it's like
[47:20.180 --> 47:25.780]  you meet somebody and you're like, polite to them and you kind of cover all the bases, but you don't
[47:25.780 --> 47:30.180]  really know them. You know what I mean? You just kind of are like feeling it out. And as you kind
[47:30.180 --> 47:34.740]  of see it, you're like, okay, I like this person or I don't like this person. They're a hassle.
[47:35.780 --> 47:41.540]  I'm just not going to deal with that. And you know what I mean? Like that's to me what it's like with
[47:41.540 --> 47:47.540]  learning various varieties for sure. Right, right. Yeah, yeah. Not that's a great analogy, really.
[47:47.540 --> 47:56.420]  And I like to push things and see how, and I don't do this with people. I just had to deal
[47:56.420 --> 48:00.660]  with the kid at work. I had to take a job because things just don't pay the way they do. Seeds don't
[48:00.660 --> 48:07.300]  sell like they did and et cetera. And everyone's got grass, but we had Oktoberfest selling a thousand
[48:07.300 --> 48:12.420]  meat sandwiches a day. And this kid blew up and got violent on me a couple of times. And it's like,
[48:12.420 --> 48:17.220]  whoa, man, have a better day. And yeah, I don't want to work with that guy anymore.
[48:18.340 --> 48:23.700]  But with the plants, I'll push their buttons. Right. And here's the neat one. Part of what we
[48:23.700 --> 48:26.900]  were going to talk about today, I'm going to unplug and take a little walk around here
[48:28.100 --> 48:34.020]  because this happened by accident. I've always heard they're happy down to 26 and
[48:34.020 --> 48:40.580]  sun is coming out. But this is this I got pretty psyched as we dropped down to
[48:41.140 --> 48:45.940]  26 and I forgot to bring these in the other night. And
[48:48.500 --> 48:51.620]  I don't know. I haven't used it forever. Is there a way to turn around my camera?
[48:52.500 --> 49:00.020]  Are you on a phone? I'm on my phone. Cam, let me try that.
[49:00.740 --> 49:09.770]  Now it just turns me off. All right. Let's see more. And no. All right. Let me do this.
[49:11.210 --> 49:15.370]  Oh, your cactus. It looks good. These are a couple of them. But these have been sitting
[49:15.370 --> 49:21.610]  out here and it's it's hard the last two nights and they're still firm and solid as soon as the
[49:21.610 --> 49:26.810]  sun hits them. Right. They didn't die. They didn't have any flesh kill off. And I always
[49:27.770 --> 49:33.770]  I always thought these San Pedro's were not quite that hardy. Those come from
[49:36.010 --> 49:41.210]  the mecula, I think, originally. I mean, I'll be honest. I live in
[49:41.210 --> 49:46.010]  Northern California. Our weather is not very extreme.
[49:49.130 --> 49:53.690]  We're pretty spoiled when it comes to that. Like it might freeze three days of the year.
[49:53.690 --> 49:59.130]  I think you got over a hundred three days of the year. Right. Where exactly are you up there?
[49:59.850 --> 50:05.370]  So I'm in the Bay Area. I'm kind of I'm right. Like Richmond. So like basically like the Bay
[50:05.370 --> 50:15.210]  Area hills. Yeah. Up on the top of a hill. Yeah. I mean, everybody I talk to, I'm I'm very
[50:15.210 --> 50:21.290]  thankful that our weather is pretty mild out here. The real the real reason there's homeless
[50:21.290 --> 50:29.370]  problem in California is the weather. My my dad showed me when I was a kid, we drove up to Santa
[50:29.370 --> 50:34.650]  Barbara. I was 10 years old and he showed me where everyone across the nation got off the train
[50:34.650 --> 50:41.210]  and lived under a big ass ficus tree in Santa Barbara because that's the warm spot. And hobos,
[50:41.210 --> 50:47.690]  what's the point in staying anywhere else when you could be 70, 68 degrees, 72 degrees all freaking
[50:48.570 --> 50:53.930]  all winter long. Right. And there's a Catholic mission right there. And that's that's the real
[50:53.930 --> 50:59.050]  reason is it's fucking nice. There was tomatoes in my backyard all but one month of the year
[50:59.050 --> 51:07.930]  growing up in Arcadia, not Arcadia. Right. So next to Pasadena. OK. But, you know, you're asking
[51:07.930 --> 51:13.450]  really about what are some of the favorite land races? And there's there's a fellow farmer, Phil,
[51:14.410 --> 51:23.290]  Phil Opien. And he he got ahold of my Nigerian Yoruba Bantu seed. And again, a thousand
[51:23.290 --> 51:31.290]  generations of stewards before me. And I got a little bag of seed that said pure Nigerian Yoruba
[51:31.290 --> 51:37.290]  Bantu pure African land race on it. And I did a seed expansion. And people say some some people
[51:37.290 --> 51:42.250]  say it's the best, strongest thing they've ever grown. But Phil Opien grew one up that was and
[51:42.250 --> 51:50.090]  he's there in the Bay Area at the time, San Jose. And it was. He got on like a steam footstep ladder
[51:50.090 --> 51:56.970]  to reach up to take a picture and he's reaching up to grab the the coal and bend it over and it
[51:56.970 --> 52:02.970]  looked like it was two fingers. But when you really look at it, you realize it's too cold is the size
[52:02.970 --> 52:10.170]  of my thigh and leg. Right. So it was like a 20 foot plant, 26 foot plant that he grew there just
[52:10.170 --> 52:16.650]  in his backyard with that Nigerian seed with massive, massive frost covered coal. It's a
[52:17.370 --> 52:25.530]  pretty nice when you can do that kind of thing. Right. He's got the serious organic soil on the
[52:25.530 --> 52:30.410]  ground and everything there. And I'm just I'm kind of opening up one of my greenhouses right now.
[52:30.410 --> 52:39.210]  There's a couple of Nigerian right here. So let's talk let's talk African varieties.
[52:39.770 --> 52:46.970]  Sure. I've noticed that I don't have a lot of it. I mean, I don't feel like I really have
[52:46.970 --> 52:50.410]  a lot of experience with land race varieties because there's so many.
[52:51.210 --> 52:57.210]  There is. But you know, what I've observed is it seems like a lot of the African stuff
[52:58.170 --> 53:04.010]  seems and this may be overgeneralization, but seems somewhat worked. Like it doesn't
[53:04.010 --> 53:09.530]  seem as straight wild. Like most of it seems like it has been bred for flower production.
[53:10.410 --> 53:15.530]  I think from what I've seen, what little I've seen, there's not a whole lot of
[53:16.410 --> 53:23.050]  wild fields there like there might be in North Afghanistan or in Himalayas. Right.
[53:24.010 --> 53:33.050]  I think that stuff is all like private field, go in and throw the seed out type of thing more than
[53:34.090 --> 53:41.130]  right. Traditionally. Yeah. Try, you know, tribal areas. There's but they're something I just heard
[53:41.130 --> 53:48.410]  with in Malawi. They're finding. Yes. It was Khalifa's thing that or was someone called in on
[53:48.410 --> 53:55.050]  a. A comment where they were saying they're finding so many variations of the Malawi gold
[53:55.050 --> 53:59.450]  at different elevation, that's a pretty small country relatively right, but there's a huge
[53:59.450 --> 54:06.490]  geographic variation from the lake up to the mountaintops. And for instance, the one I have,
[54:07.610 --> 54:13.370]  it's more of a wider leaf when it starts the Malawi gold. And so there's a lot of people
[54:13.370 --> 54:17.210]  freaked out when they first saw it and stuff. And it's like every plant is something I try
[54:17.210 --> 54:21.130]  and show people. Every plant starts with a wider leaf and as it flowers and moves up,
[54:21.130 --> 54:26.970]  it gets a much smaller, narrower leaf. Right. And so I show people next to the Afghanica stuff,
[54:26.970 --> 54:31.690]  how even though it's widest leaves are way narrower than the narrowest leaves of the Afghanica.
[54:33.290 --> 54:36.490]  And I find out that a lot of people never grew any of these things that they're telling me I'm
[54:36.490 --> 54:39.610]  doing the wrong thing and it looks like something else, et cetera. It's kind of.
[54:40.570 --> 54:46.330]  Kind of an interesting reality when you get into the internet world of experts.
[54:47.050 --> 54:51.050]  Yeah. I mean, you know, you got to take it with a grain of salt. That's, you know,
[54:51.050 --> 54:54.010]  great information and terrible information at the same time.
[54:54.010 --> 55:00.410]  Right. Right. And you know, when we had, we had a particular group, the Landrace Traders
[55:01.210 --> 55:05.450]  Club, that was pretty awesome. And then when people saw that we weren't making money off of
[55:05.690 --> 55:10.410]  it, and so they did what they could to destroy it and recreate another group that had a similar name
[55:10.410 --> 55:16.010]  that they could make money through. And I stopped participating with all of that. And it's kind of a
[55:16.010 --> 55:20.970]  bummer. And I got so many Landrace seeds sent to me that I realized I'm like, I'm never gonna be
[55:20.970 --> 55:25.850]  able to grow these in my entire life. I needed to like stop having people consider me the steward
[55:25.850 --> 55:35.290]  until I get a laboratory and capital to work with, to do this on a large scale. And it's hard. And
[55:35.290 --> 55:38.730]  that's one of the reasons why it's like one at a time, everyone should just do a little bit,
[55:38.730 --> 55:43.770]  right? Because nobody's ever going to invest in it, because there's no money in it until
[55:44.570 --> 55:51.850]  all of that work of the breeding comes back around to produce a plant that it's a very specialized
[55:51.850 --> 55:55.690]  plant for a specialized location. It's not something that's huge capital investment's
[55:55.690 --> 56:00.730]  going to get a return on investment on. Right? Yeah. I mean, it's basically, it's like making
[56:00.730 --> 56:07.130]  a tool. It's like you're, it's like if you were like a jeweler, and you're making the tools for
[56:07.130 --> 56:11.770]  your jewelry, like you're making the tools to then eventually make something in the future.
[56:12.570 --> 56:20.490]  Right? Which, so this New Mexico land grant that I have, okay, and we're saying we're talking
[56:20.490 --> 56:25.370]  African, and this is in a rod, I've been trying to figure out where this genetic originated. And,
[56:25.370 --> 56:30.730]  and so the Spaniards brought it, I believe, and the Spaniards got theirs from North Africans,
[56:30.730 --> 56:36.730]  right? And, but we have different, there's two different groupings of African genetics.
[56:37.370 --> 56:45.370]  And some in the Southern African stuff came over from India. Right? And the North African stuff
[56:45.370 --> 56:54.010]  came in with the Sufis from after from the Middle East. All right. And, and so we can, we can
[56:54.010 --> 57:02.010]  separate our North African genetics, like I just showed the Belvia from the Nigerian Aruba Bantu,
[57:02.010 --> 57:09.770]  or the Senegal, or the South African, right, which we're getting further away from the equator.
[57:10.410 --> 57:15.450]  So there's, there's some different. Now the stuff in South Africa, this is something I understand
[57:15.450 --> 57:22.490]  that it had a wild population. And it grew out in the hills. And the stuff we call Durban poison,
[57:23.450 --> 57:27.370]  right, it's a single select. And I haven't actually personally found the one I'm looking
[57:27.370 --> 57:34.650]  for that tastes like black licorice. So if anyone out there has, oh, my breeding partner, grasshopper.
[57:35.850 --> 57:41.290]  He's all about the Durban. And yeah, he does have the licorice for sure. Well, I would be
[57:42.090 --> 57:48.010]  beyond grateful and willing to trade my left arm to acquire the black licorice and seed form.
[57:48.650 --> 57:55.050]  That's the one my mentor told me to look for. I've actually been looking for for quite some time to
[57:55.050 --> 58:05.290]  find. And so you have a faggot room inside Tifuga Ferry. And shucks, something hills I can't remember.
[58:05.930 --> 58:11.290]  But so so they call it Durban poison, because all these, these tribal areas and villages would bring
[58:11.290 --> 58:16.810]  it into the port city, right. And people traveling around would, you know, the sailors would get a
[58:16.810 --> 58:21.770]  bail of it or whatever they needed. Traditionally on the boats, and this is when I first personally
[58:21.770 --> 58:27.210]  administered cannabis as medicine, smoking the rope is what they called it. Okay. And
[58:28.730 --> 58:33.690]  yeah, they literally, this is my first experiences with cannabis and dealing with
[58:33.690 --> 58:37.210]  back in the late 80s, everything was pretty close to land race. And there was very little
[58:37.210 --> 58:42.650]  polyhybrid. There was like one or two hybridized and inbreds, right. And so they'd be
[58:43.210 --> 58:46.650]  working on the fishing boat. You get these seasick land lovers coming out and I was 14 and I was the
[58:46.650 --> 58:51.610]  lowest lines on the deck. So they gave me a stick, stick of rope to get them to burn on the bows
[58:51.610 --> 58:56.410]  and one or two hits after I get a lit form and they'd be like, Oh wow, I feel great. Let me take
[58:56.410 --> 59:00.970]  one more hit just to be sure. Like guys who had never smoked weed before never probably did again,
[59:00.970 --> 59:07.930]  or maybe they did after that experience. But if all we had on the boat was some NorCal green bud
[59:08.010 --> 59:13.690]  in a pipe, right. That got them sicker, different chemistries, different plants,
[59:13.690 --> 59:18.490]  different things going on differently. Right. There's, there's so the press weed from South
[59:18.490 --> 59:24.410]  America that we get, we always call it Mexican brick. That shit cured the seasickness instantly.
[59:24.410 --> 59:31.850]  Right. And, and so that, that was my introduction to, to medical marijuana, but it also is the
[59:31.850 --> 59:36.890]  basis of my understanding of the difference between marijuana and weed. And so I was
[59:36.890 --> 59:42.250]  my understanding of the differences and why I like to still use Indica and Sativa as words
[59:42.810 --> 59:53.690]  in context. Right. There are wide leaf, Malawi gold, right. And there is narrow leaf,
[59:53.690 --> 01:00:00.010]  Pakistani, Chisholm Kush. And so those, those descriptions I have a hard time with, but I,
[01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:04.090]  I get it when we get into the polyhybrids stuff that's commercialized and everyone's just going
[01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:14.010]  for THC numbers. Sativa and Indica completely lose context. And. And even like, like I would
[01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.650]  back up and even to what you were saying before regarding there are plants that during veg will
[01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:23.770]  have wide leaves and then the leaves thin out during flower. Yeah. Yeah. You know,
[01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:30.010]  it's some that do that more so than others. And also a plant that's from seed will have
[01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:36.570]  even thicker leaves than a plant that's from clone. Sure. The leaves then also get thinner
[01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:42.970]  as well. So it is hard to use these various things. It's helpful, but it's like, there's
[01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:47.530]  multiple levels of classification of these plants and description of them. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:53.130]  There, there are medicine, there's form there. And then how much polyhybridization occurs in,
[01:00:53.130 --> 01:01:01.850]  in the gymnosperm affects the plasticity of the epigenetic expression and whether what soil,
[01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:06.490]  what temperatures, what, what light angle, what color of light, if you're indoor,
[01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:11.130]  all those things, that's not, I, I, I start that one took a while for me to really grasp.
[01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:16.730]  But reading some stuff that DJ short wrote about moving plants around and where they were from a
[01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:23.130]  single cut with a light angle attack of a mixed HID back in the nineties, when all we had was,
[01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:28.090]  was blue and red, right? We had, we had metal halide and we had high pressure sodium
[01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:33.930]  and he saw a different epigenetic expressions depending on, and one, depending on how much
[01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:40.570]  blue or red it expressed more like a sativa or an indica. Right. For sure. And even like
[01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:48.730]  the light cycle, you know, whether it's a 12, 12 or 11, 13. Yeah. For sure. Pulling tarps,
[01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:55.130]  pulling tarps mid summer versus you can see I got, I got very low quality of light here right now.
[01:01:55.130 --> 01:02:02.650]  Right. We were talking sunshine. But that's kind of, and that all adds into different kinds of
[01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:07.210]  stresses. I like to apply to my different kinds of breeding and selection and seeing how things
[01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:13.450]  respond. It's, it's it's kind of neat to, to test all those different things and grow,
[01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.730]  put plants out and see how they respond in these different, different
[01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:25.290]  lighting categories, temperatures and things like that. Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you definitely
[01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:32.250]  still like your plants definitely have like a print of, you know, your stressors that you put
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:38.410]  on them. And the one actually I'm the most curious about is the drought stress and water stress and
[01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:44.330]  like how you're able to, cause I mean, I'm sure there, I mean, are there varieties that handle
[01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:51.370]  dry farming better than there is? And let me, I'm going to do real quick. And so, so you might not
[01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:55.690]  know this. I do breed corn and I have been breeding corn and that's, you know, part of why I went to
[01:02:55.690 --> 01:03:02.730]  college was to get a better understanding of the life. My main course was forestry fire or science.
[01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:13.130]  Okay. Okay. So we'll, I'll stay close to the house. Sorry. Here's,
[01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:20.650]  this is all corn bred from, let's see here if I can,
[01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:28.580]  this is, this is bred from Native American and this is like in the perfect eating stage right
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:35.620]  now. Let's see if I can get some proper light. There we go. So it's a multicolored sweet blue corn.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:45.020]  So I got purples, blues, whites, right? And then this is like at the eating stage when it's all,
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:52.860]  and it's perfect milky. And I've been breeding that for over 20 years now from,
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.500]  all what would we call land race, Native American varieties. And then I threw in some
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.780]  sweet masa corn from Mexico. Right. Okay. So I was going to show you was,
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.740]  I was testing some other stuff this year. People keep asking me, it's like, dude,
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.980]  can you dry farm that corn still? And so this year we had
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:25.500]  25 days at 107 with RHs dropping down to single digits. Right. And so here's,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:31.020]  here's some of the corn, this variety that was new when I was testing that did not,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:36.460]  it didn't do so well. Right. And these are just in plain sand. Didn't do,
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:42.780]  I'm using the Hopi technique where I deep drill and drop six or seven kernels in,
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.380]  and then you thin them down to three or four. And I might, I might cut out again here
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:51.260]  because I want to show you the one that was my own. It's kind of fallen over,
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:58.700]  but I actually got an ear off of it. So this one here, you see, actually got an ear.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.780]  So what I'm showing here is the genetic makes a huge difference. If we have, you were talking
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:10.220]  about the corn breeders breeding back ends, the land race corns, because the new stuff just doesn't
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.860]  have the tolerance, the drought tolerance, et cetera. And the same thing happens with these
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:22.060]  cannabis strains. We bred out. This is another example that R22 Monterey pine
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:34.460]  was bred for speed of rotation, rotation 22 years. Okay. So this is, became an international
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.020]  lumber, timber species planted all over. And we see it in the Lord of the Ring movies
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:48.460]  in all the dead forests, Fangorn, et cetera. Those plants got to seven, 10 years. They had bred out
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.580]  all disease resistance and bugs and funguses came in and wiped out this forest. Right.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:06:00.540]  So the same thing happens with, we've been breeding for indoor or greenhouses, et cetera,
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:09.500]  water addiction. And the whole process of horticulture is moved away from what those
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:14.140]  wild plants can do. So, you know, they're in the whaling Valley that when you grew
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:24.380]  that stuff doesn't get water, it's broadcast seed and the snow melt and the, whatever rains
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:30.460]  come through that region, I think it's a monsoonal region. That's their rain. That's
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:37.820]  their watering. They don't have any means of irrigating that. Right. So this one I have from
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:45.420]  New Mexico, I've been trying to put it all together. I'd say sometime around 1600 was when
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:55.260]  that area got originally farmed and there was priests and miners in the area. And so seed
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:00.860]  probably came with the priests and there were the farmers and eventually it went wild. And then, so
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:09.500]  the story I was told about it was by the fellow I got the seed from who's the current Don or Lord
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.860]  of the land grant. And these land grants became valid still in the United States, but it was the
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:21.260]  King of Spain in 1700 and granted this property to his ancestor and all his inheritance therefore.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.420]  And so when Nixon came along and said, Hey, we're going to eradicate this stuff
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.140]  all across the nation. And the word drugs, you got to kill off all the ditchweed. You got to kill
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:35.260]  off everything that's gone feral. This guy's grandfather, who's saying, this has been here
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.900]  for time immortal. It's been, it's part of the land. It's part of my heritage and I'm not going
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:47.900]  to do that. And so he left it, but the grandfather in 1970 knew of it as being there as long as his
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:53.420]  family's knowledge. Right. So this wasn't something that showed up later on or whatever. It's something
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.540]  that had spread across multiple hundreds of thousands of acres and the other landowners all
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:03.580]  did eradicate. And so it remained on this one piece of property, mountainous Southern
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:15.900]  arm of the Rockies, the, on the Eastern side of, of New Mexico. Right. And it naturalized over time.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.780]  And the way he described it as an unwet years, it grows all over the mountain and on dry years,
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:27.980]  it's only in the Arroyos and the, and the gullies, right. And sparse. So when we go and we find a
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.380]  genetic like that, which I'm been spending some time on, but again, it's like, there's not a lot
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:37.100]  of turn. A lot of people say I want that, but when it comes time and I offer the seat up, I haven't
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:43.420]  heard a lot of people come and say, dude, yeah, throw here's my a hundred bucks. I'm right now at
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:52.300]  a moving into F3 from wild trying to tame out the intersex issues with it. And I've got some
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:56.460]  feminized that I've ever been. I've got several polyhybrid or hybrids back to polyhybrids,
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:02.380]  hybrids, other land races squared back into itself. Shit. Skunky is all fucking get out.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.420]  I'm completely drought tolerant. That's the stuff that I use for the hardcore.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:13.340]  I've grew a seed and a bunch of seeds to clone and put it up at 9,000 feet to see how it dealt with
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.100]  being in the cold, put it near a spring. So it didn't have water issues. Found the best cold
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:26.060]  tolerant one, the moose ate them all and bred that, that pollen from the hardcore or I'm sorry,
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:35.260]  the land grant, the wild stuff into it. And that stuff will grow trees. I had one that was bigger
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:39.660]  than a Coke bottle bottom growing off the side of the mountain where I found there had been a
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:46.780]  landslide and I broadcast the seed. So again, that's the, it brings back in that hardiness,
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:54.620]  that wolf, you get that invigoration, the ability to drop a tap root, right? So depending on which
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.180]  ones you're looking at and what you want to do and where your own environment is, disease
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:06.460]  resistance issues and things like that. Any of the Afganica stuff has mold issues because it's super
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:12.620]  dry there and they're not the best thing necessarily unless you've spent some time finding those ones
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:21.420]  that don't have it to breed in for moist areas. Right. And you know, a trait that I would,
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:27.900]  I would add, so I worked with some Lolab Valley lemon Kashmiri and a really interesting trait
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:36.780]  was that the seeds were extremely difficult to sprout and they sprouted almost like wildflower
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.860]  seeds. Did you, did you get those? Were they something that, that Azarian had reproduced or
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:48.380]  was that straight from a farmer over there? You know, if they'd been collected. This was actually,
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:56.300]  this may have been a reproduction in Maine. I think it was the guy downtown.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:05.180]  So I think they had, they had even been made here. In the States already. Yeah, no,
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:11.820]  that can make a huge difference whether it's direct wild and then I have no idea at that point
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:18.060]  whether, you know, he did a proper job or not. Or was that like, he gave me a lot of
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:23.740]  seeds and you know, I, I did like a small germination traditionally, you know, like
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:29.740]  popped them in some water, you know, 10 days, usually three days they go, you know, like nothing
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:35.580]  really happened. Tried another batch, nothing happened. Then I was like, Hmm, I tried to crack
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:40.300]  some with my teeth and I noticed they were really, it was a really, really thick shell. So I started
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:46.060]  cracking them with my teeth and then I got like a few to come up and I was like, I'm going to put
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.540]  all of these outside in one little patch because I have a feeling that they're going to sprout.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:58.940]  And lo and behold, like two, three weeks later, started getting all of these plants just popping
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:04.700]  up, popping up, popping up. That's one that you could probably get them wet, soak them and then
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:09.740]  throw them in the freezer and pull them out and they pop, pop, pop like crazy. Right? I mean,
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.740]  just doing it like a traditional wildflower and just planting it and being prepared for like,
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:21.900]  yep, a few weeks to a month before they popped and they finally did pop and I had a completely
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:28.140]  normal germination. I made, you know, I did my open pollination. I found that same
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.500]  line, you know what I mean? Like I found that same plant that had those same kind of seeds
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:41.500]  and everything and, you know, tried, you know, same thing, thick shell. Interesting, very interesting,
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:48.300]  close to wild type of variety where like, I kind of, you know what I mean? Like I ignored it,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.740]  didn't really do anything and it was fine. It grew, it didn't really need
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.740]  anything, you know, like it just did its thing basically.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:02.620]  Right. And so that's, that's ICS future for anybody who you take those
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:08.540]  genetics and try and find those traits and bleed them into, if you like cookie,
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:15.580]  read that to a cookie or whatever it is. Right. And, you know, I've done it with the sours,
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:21.820]  done it with VOGs, do it with, and that's just, and then you can take it and see, hey, this,
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:27.100]  this works in my environment. I can drop this seed to not spend my entire freaking life worrying about
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:34.700]  whether I have medicine for my loved ones or, or we can do fields of it direct seeded. Right.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:41.660]  Here in Utah, the first year they had hemp, there was massive failures because all these people
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:49.580]  tried to use hemp seed from Northern Canada and plant it at the same time they do.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.580]  It was already mid-summer here and freaking, you know, the seed, nothing got more than a foot or
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:03.740]  two tall. It was hot and dry drought seasons and the irrigation doesn't, it just, it hits the
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:08.460]  surface and evaporates out. And when, if you don't have the vegetation to block the sun, right.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.860]  Yeah. I mean, I've heard they'd get a lot of boltritis because there's not
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:19.820]  enough THC that, that causes the, that helps fight against that since it's such a low THC.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:27.900]  You know, I've never had with that. I've never seen, I have some pretty high THC stuff catch
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:35.980]  boitris and I, temperature changes, moisture content, density of flower. Those tend to be
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:42.620]  the biggest things that I find to be more than anything. But there's definitely, when you have
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:51.980]  tropical or leaning genetics into the system, there tends, yeah, the Afghan stuff has a lot of
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:58.700]  THC quite often, but it doesn't necessarily have any resistance to that because it's so dry air.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:04.780]  Right. I have another question for you. This is really important. This is like,
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:11.020]  so is there a correlation between root mass and like dry farming
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:18.940]  potential in crops? Like, is that one of the traits or is it more? This is an interesting
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:24.220]  question that I was really hoping to do some more answering to this year. I think more,
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:31.820]  I think more taproot and fine hair root is, is really, really where it's at. But there's,
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.860]  like, for instance, you see all these,
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:46.940]  there, there it's a hybridized, I've grown, I've grown some modern and beautiful inbred flowers.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:54.220]  They're sunflowers, right? And so, is the, trying to think of the proper name, I pray, the prairie
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:16:00.140]  sunflower, I think it is, is the Native American small blacks, black-eyed Susan sunflower that
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:05.980]  grows by the roadside everywhere, right? These grow 13 feet tall in my native sand here in the backyard
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.940]  and we can, I don't water these things. They just grow like crazy. But let's go ahead right now and
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:22.860]  look at the root mass of this. The ground's half frozen. I don't think it's anywhere near
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:31.820]  with that 13 foot. Of course, half of it breaks off, right? Maybe two thirds. It's, it's not like
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:37.740]  what we think of and I kind of have the feeling it's more efficiencies, more than anything, right?
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:43.340]  And I was really hoping to do film. This is where I grew all that beldia, right? You can see stems
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:49.980]  here. And one of the things I did notice, it just got so wet that I, the experiment of digging it
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:57.180]  out the stem of the root, there's a lot of fine, fine roots all over the place in here. And it's
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:03.100]  going up. I had a lot of compost I put on top of it and a lot of mulch, right? And so, but again,
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.580]  it rained so much. I was really, I might, it's time to put the garlic in. So, let's put garlic
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.780]  in today before we get hard freeze up again. I think it's efficiencies more than anything,
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:19.660]  right? I think it, it spreads out, right? So, this is already breaking down, but that's,
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:27.340]  there's not a whole lot of stem, right? And literally that, that,
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.660]  the one that was bigger than like three pineapples stacked together, one cola,
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:39.980]  it was the size of one of those large school blue kitty pencils was the stem, right? So,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:47.580]  in general with plants, you tend to have a one-to-one ratio of root mass to crown or
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:53.180]  vegetative matter. Something I have noticed though, across the board with more herbaceous plants,
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:59.420]  there tends to be less root than with trees. Trees tend to have more on that equal
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:07.820]  mass above and below ground. And again, it tends to be, you don't see it so much. It's that super
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:16.540]  fine, fine root hair structure, I think. So, and on that same topic, when I studied soil science,
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:21.020]  I almost left all of my forestry and fire stuff because I love soil science so fucking much.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:27.500]  I almost left my degree right before finishing and moving into just going straight soil science
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.060]  from base up and getting it. Then I'm like, I don't want to be an academic forever. I want to
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:38.300]  go out and fight fire and live life and have a good time. But the guys I studied under were the
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:43.900]  scientists that developed hydroponics for NASA. The original two-part formula that we know as
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:55.580]  general hydroponics is the green and red. And so, these guys were pretty impressive scientists and
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:02.620]  they knew when we were asking subtle questions, what we were asking. And then they tell us pretty
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.660]  directly, oh, you guys want to grow weed. Okay. So, this is what you need to know.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:11.900]  But one of the biggest things I took away from those guys, the way they were able to
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:18.140]  do it, the biggest things I took away from those guys, there's soil structure and densities and all
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:25.100]  that stuff. But when it came to growing for hydro was the proper hydro system has an extremely small
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:36.540]  root mass to it. You're feeding the nutrients coming right to the root surface. And if
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:41.660]  everything's in perfect balance, it's taking it up and perfect as it needs it. And you're
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.660]  constantly flushing that root system right past. And you have those beautiful white roots, but it
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:52.700]  only needs to be this teeny little space for a massive top because it's getting that constant
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:59.500]  flow of nutrient right past it. And so, you can have when we see people showing off these massive,
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.980]  massive root stocks that are three times the size of their plant, there's something really wrong in
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:08.780]  their system. They're starving. They're reaching for that nutrient. Okay. There's something missing
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:14.940]  and they're not getting it in proper balance. And when we have soil and we're dumping nutrients
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.540]  onto it, it's kind of the same thing as a hydroponic system. We're force feeding that through
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.820]  there. But when we have, for instance, a living soil, you know, you got to give it extra vegetative
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.700]  time to allow the roots another extra 10 days or whatever to allow the roots to fill out the system
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:35.340]  and get those root hairs and microbe interactions occurring. So, with the dry farm stuff,
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.460]  you have a lot of, you're going to have a living soil, hopefully,
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.860]  because you're not going to be injecting any fertilizers and you're not going to have
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:50.220]  salt fertilizers being carried by water that's getting flushed in and salts get
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.140]  brought back up to the surface as the soil evaporates. The roots
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:04.620]  are building those relationships, the ability of the environment around it. It's in total
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:11.180]  homostasis and harmony. It's not overgrowing. Right. And one of the things I like to show people
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.300]  in the shows I've done was how the plants self-strip down the bottoms. Right. We talk about
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:22.220]  lollipopping and the plant naturally will lollipop itself to adjust to how much moisture
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:28.860]  and nutrient is available as it dries down for the year. Yeah. So, I think it's important to
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:34.220]  note that you can't just go drop a seed into mid-summer dry soil and hope that it's going to
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:40.060]  do this. Okay. This is, this has something to do. You have to understand your entire climate and
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:45.500]  rainfall cycles. You have to understand your soil structure and stuff like that. Right.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:51.660]  Cannabis loves a looser soil, but it also works in clay. But there's, again, moisture issues,
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.540]  timing, that stuff comes into play. And you find the right ones that work in the right stuff.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:04.220]  It's going to be magical. So, do these plants need full sun or is it more of like finding the right
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:09.340]  kind of, I think it depends on where you're at. And again, like where you're at, you get a couple
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:15.020]  days, a hundred degrees, they're not hurting so bad. But here where we have these literally
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:22.140]  searing days where the UV at 4,500 feet is breaking up the carbon in the soil and literally
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:27.420]  vaporizing soil carbon. Right. And it's scorched plants and stuff like that. And it lingers into
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:36.620]  the evening. I like utilizing windrows for shade, for instance, or I've suggested to people who
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:42.220]  don't have side shade that you might. One of the things that in my experimentation in my youth and
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:48.860]  just out of necessity to hide from camp. And I've got one, I'm doing it right now in a tub. I'll show
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:56.540]  you the same concept. Is if you're at the edge of trees, mid-summer, they get shade midday,
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:04.780]  but in the winter, they're totally in the sun. And so right here, and I can't see what you guys
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:09.900]  are seeing. So I'm hopefully I'm showing this. I've got a tree and then I've got this, this earth
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.660]  box with some testers in it. Right. And we've been, we've been hard freezing in the last two nights
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:21.420]  and it gets shade from the hardest of the frost from that tree with the low angle sun comes out
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:25.660]  and hits it and warms it in the morning. Right. And so there's these different strategies like that
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:37.020]  you can use and, and, or you can erect a partial shade cloth, a gazebo type, you know, they got
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:44.700]  those triangular sales of 30% shade cloth. Right. Yeah. That kind of stuff makes a difference.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:55.420]  So technically the dry farm by definition is, is, is agriculture produced with less than 20 inches
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:02.700]  of rain. Okay. A precipitation in total. So these folks in Northern California where it rains 70
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:12.760]  inches, there's literally, they're just growing without, without irrigation. It's the same as
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:19.240]  it is back East. It's, it's, it's not technically a dry farm, like for instance, on Hopi where
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:28.440]  they're growing their livelihood and corn with 13 inches of rain on average. Right. And so there's,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.920]  there's different things going on there, but, but part of me showing and doing these things,
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.360]  I really, really want people to understand that it's like you got 20 inches of rain. You don't
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:44.440]  need to water a thing. You don't, you plant your seed, you have a microbial rich soil and it's
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.600]  you know, I think it happened in pots, right? It's not going to happen in a raised bed.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.200]  There's, there's physics that go on. There's, there's the good that precludes you with capillary
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.160]  action and pore space and stuff that, that are going to drain that and, and, and dry it out.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.960]  But you can do it on a compost pile that, that, that works. It's got a tap where it can go right
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.400]  down into the ground and, and work on in. But if you know, you look around, you can see
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.920]  plants are growing without anyone's irrigation, wherever you live,
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.600]  even the driest of the desert, there's greasewood growing out in California. Right.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.040]  I don't see, I don't have chat ups. I don't even, let's see, maybe there it is.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.280]  Just, that's just our chat. I have no idea what people are saying or asking questions or anything.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.920]  I mean, I've just been listening to, to, to what you've been saying. I mean, there's,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  are there any questions? I don't, I don't see any main questions. I mean, it seems like people are
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.200]  having other conversations. I'm really enjoying it. I think this is super fascinating. And I mean,
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:57.320]  shoot, like from like where I live, for us, water is the biggest limiting factor.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:58.680]  Yeah.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:05.880]  And, you know, I, I'm at least starting to like be aware of how much water that we are using.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.160]  And then, you know, the next step is starting to take steps, you know, past that, but like, yeah,
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.560]  you know, I have plants grown in pots, some are grown in the ground, but a lot are sitting in
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:25.080]  pots and it, it takes a lot of water, especially with like smart pots. And yeah, I mean, putting
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:30.040]  things in the ground is, you know, does seem to make more sense on a lot of different levels.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.840]  Well, it brings you true to a law as well. When you start, you start accessing your actual local
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.680]  soils, microcosm and mineral content, right? That stuff it's, it's developed in place for a long,
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.560]  long, long time. The, I get blown away seeing people like building beds in their backyard or
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.680]  pots in their backyard in Southern California. And it's like, most of the soil, Southern
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.040]  California is some of the richest soil in the world. It's like, scrape that grass off of the
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.960]  scrape that grass off and drop your seed down. It's a, yeah.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.520]  And like, when you were just saying like, you can grow in a compost bin, like I have a compost pile
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:15.400]  and I'm like, that's brilliant. You could put tons of plants in there and put your compost veggies on
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:20.600]  top. And I mean, that sounds super heady and terpy to me. Like.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:26.920]  That's literally the experience I had with the Ross safarians was they took one of the guys took
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.760]  me outside. My brother was doing business and he's like, Hey, let me show you the garden.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.680]  And so I walk out to see the garden and he's like, we've got this and this and this, we got
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.960]  this. We need some more squash, blah, blah, blah. And we walk over the compost pile and there's
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.480]  squash plants growing. He's like, job provide. And I'm like, there's like something way beyond
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.560]  to all of this. Right. Cause you know, I'd grown up working around grandparents on organic,
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:55.080]  but we're getting taught. I was in college getting taught chemical farming or agriculture.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.920]  And it's like, Oh, totally relearn me. And my brother started using
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:06.280]  miracle grow for our plants and it produced amazing plants. But there was six years later
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.360]  relearn and all of a sudden and watching is like, Oh, pumpkins growing out of the compost.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:18.120]  This works. Yeah. Yeah, it really is that easy. And we actually noticed that like the compost bin
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:25.320]  is one of my favorite places to sprout seeds in general. I feel like maybe it's like the heat.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.280]  Microbes too. The heat in the microbes.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.040]  Shell is getting nibbled on by like, you know, little bugs and stuff just to like get it going.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:40.600]  There's, there's so much life force in the compost bin and like seed cells has dropped
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.640]  off considerably and I haven't done this, but one of the things I was thinking about
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:49.000]  for the future is especially, you know, you want to have maybe in a two year cycle at most, but
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:55.880]  putting seeds in storage in worm castings, just so they have all that life force,
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.240]  beneficial bacteria and microbes ready to go when they get planted. Right.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.000]  So it's basically all frozen together and just like in home homeostasis.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:13.560]  Kind of. Yeah. I mean, it's dry in a cat and a little vial. Right. And normally I put a piece
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:19.320]  of corn in there to keep the sussicated, but dried out worm castings is pretty dry,
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:25.560]  especially here in the desert. But. Interesting. You hear a lot of people saying drying things out.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.120]  This is one I have a hard time with and I'd like to get a lot more into. I know
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:35.160]  some stuff really requires moisture. Other things don't. And just goes dormant and then
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.720]  re activates with moisture. We literally have something here in Utah called cryptobiotic soil
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:47.480]  and it's living death soil. And you look at it, it's a crust. And, you know, you're in the desert
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:53.160]  and in southern Utah where it gets even higher, you're in the hundred teens and it's in the
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:30:00.440]  single digit R.H. all the freaking time. And it rains. A little bit, you know, and large torrents
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:06.040]  usually. And it's, it's flood for a few days and then it's over. And so, but this bacteria
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:10.600]  microbe complex that they call cryptobiotic soil just comes right to life and it grows and it does
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:15.880]  its thing. And then it goes dormant again. And I've kind of noticed the same thing here with
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:21.000]  my soils. It gets so dry. It freeze dries through the winter. And then as soon as I can get water
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.680]  in the stuff, it's warm enough to start growing things and I'm wasting it. And you have that,
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:31.640]  the humilene smell comes out and that's, that's all those bacteria and microbes doing their thing
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:38.920]  and putting off their exhibit is that, that wetter smell. So that's, that's definitely,
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.000]  there's definitely different things going on in the dry dry than with the wet wet.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:53.960]  Failure density, terpene production defenses, right? You're stimulating a whole different
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:58.600]  section of the plant and the plant think about, we talk about don't feed the squirrels in the
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.440]  park because winter comes and they can't survive for themselves. Well, it's the exact same thing.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.760]  Like it's pretty tough to irrigate a plant and have it all on water addiction with this flood of
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.960]  everything coming to it. And then you shut that water off and try and transition it to dry on its
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:20.280]  own. It's like, Oh, my cells, they don't, and it'll defoliate and they'll have to start over.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.520]  Right. If it even can, because it's got to die back its roots and then it'll get root rot and
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.520]  you know, it really needs those fine hairs, which it never developed.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:34.280]  So another question, do you find that there's a different characteristic of maybe the root
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:40.440]  mass of a dry farm plant as opposed to like, you know, like a smart pot plant? And then as
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.800]  opposed to like, Oh, totally. Totally. And that's kind of like what we've been trying to describe
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:52.600]  here is, is like, you know, in, in any sort of pot, the roots are going to fill up the space.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.880]  You know, as long as it's got time to do that in vegetation and even some during flower,
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.640]  it's going to fill up the space and occupy as much as it possibly can. And then it's going to
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:11.240]  maximize its returns in those spaces at its least cost of energy to do so. So when there's lots of
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:16.840]  moisture, there's lots of oxygen, there's a lot of return for a little bit of energy, right? It's
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.480]  easier for those plants to do that. But, and again, it's easier for those to have those big fat,
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:30.200]  juicy cells and less density of other things in those cells. So when it's got to look for and
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:39.000]  strive for and put more energy into finding that stuff, right. Again, you're going to have in the
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.440]  same space, I think you're going to have more fine root because there's less osmosis going on
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:50.760]  bringing that stuff to that fine root. You're going to have a higher incidence of symbiotic
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:33:00.760]  relationship through microbes, whether it's a root fungus or bacteria or other microbes in the soil.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.960]  Right. And so the signaling that's going to go on between those in the finer root hairs, right,
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:10.840]  is going to be a lot more tense because it's got to work through a more of an electron
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:21.160]  transfer in a drier environment than an osmotic transfer, right? So when you have more moisture,
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.720]  you've got osmotic pressure and all of the nutrients and all the elements are going to
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:31.160]  break in and even out throughout that water mass imbalance. But when it's dry, it can't do that.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.080]  And so the roots got to work in a completely different way. So, I mean, the basic answer is,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:43.080]  yes, very, very different root structure from a dry farm from any other thing that's going on.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:53.080]  You know, the same difference from the billionaire who doesn't have to work a day from the guy who
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:59.880]  puts a roof on for a living, right? That guy putting the roof on doesn't got a belly, you know?
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:12.280]  Yeah. And then my other question would be, do you also grow other plants with, like, in that area,
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:17.800]  which I'm assuming you would. But like, I mean, it wouldn't just be like a clear area dry farm with
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.200]  just cannabis, right? There would be like other plants around or?
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:28.520]  There's, we can talk about a couple of different things here then. If you're doing it as a crop,
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:39.240]  it's probably going to be a monocrop with cover crop at the same time. Okay, bottom and understory.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:48.040]  You definitely, though, on a small scale crop size, you can be doing this with, you got to use
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:53.000]  mulches and stuff too. It's huge. Depending on how dry you are, right? I'm talking, I'm working in
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.160]  the most extreme thing you can possibly talk about. We had extraordinary drought. We had this year, I had,
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.680]  I never saw final. I think it was a total of eight inches of precipitation from January 1st
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:12.840]  until I cut this stuff, right? And then much of that was later monsoons and light rains that
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.760]  two inches of that would never even penetrated the mulches on the ground. So it just changed my
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:24.040]  humidity structure. But without those mulches, the sun here is so intense, it would suck up
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:29.640]  so much more moisture, so much deeper in my sandy soil because of osmotic pressure,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:36.120]  poor space and those things that come into play, right? So a clay that cracks off the surface,
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.960]  right? Dries out and the bottom stays wet. It's going to be very different than my sand.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.240]  Shit. So
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:55.880]  natural crafting and wild crafting dry farm is a different thing where you're broadcasting
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.200]  on a mountainside and it's interacting with the native plants. It's got to make it up through
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.120]  whatever forbs and herbs are growing there in the early season. But once it's up, it has dominance.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:12.760]  And so clearing out small patches in the forest, right? For instance, if you want a natural craft
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:21.080]  and broadcasting a few seeds into a small patch and you've got the other stuff around,
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.040]  you can have, there's so many ways about going about this. And I'm thinking it's going to be
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:32.920]  a book that describes the differences from dry farm, natural craft and wild crafting
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.240]  that are all very similar, but slightly different.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.400]  Like for example, is there like a three sisters type of thing you would recommend?
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.480]  That's like a cannabis type of.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:46.920]  You know, that would totally, if you have a squash plant that runs like that,
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:54.280]  you know, I use sin flowers just for cover for, while I have a first amendment right to be a
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.320]  medicine man here, I have some really cool neighbors and I don't want to upset anybody's
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:04.280]  little kids or whatever. So I try and keep things small and out of sight. So I definitely use
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:13.880]  sunflower and corn and various things to inter plant and keep a very green space.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:21.080]  But at the same time, that's it's competition, right? So if you're not, those ones are,
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:27.640]  they're not in the same spot. So if you've got enough moisture to let a squash grow on a dry
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.120]  farms type of thing, go for it and let that cover your ground, right? That's what the squashes and
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.680]  the three sisters is all about. Is it, it will, it covers the ground and keeps the moisture in,
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.280]  but it also keeps like the raccoons from coming in and eating your corn.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.240]  And so there's different, one of my favorite ground covers is, is,
[01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:58.170]  oh, shit. Let me see. Persilane, right? It's a very low growing. It's a, it's a deep root
[01:37:58.730 --> 01:38:03.050]  and it takes very little moisture, but it holds in tons of ground moisture.
[01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:09.450]  Okay. So if you get persilane mixed in, I think that would be awesome. A clover or any of those,
[01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:13.690]  any of those shallow grasses, right. That aren't going to be going penetrating deep.
[01:38:15.610 --> 01:38:24.490]  I haven't experimented with enough to know if some, you know, again, I'm an extreme,
[01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:28.810]  if you got 30 inches of rain, you could be growing wheat, right. Mixed in with your stuff
[01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:32.730]  and coming in and intercropping and doing different stuff, even growing your beets in there.
[01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:37.930]  But yeah, it's about any place. Some of the, one of the trends people have been talking about
[01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:41.930]  lately, and I want to, I'm going to show this right now. I showed this last week on a show, but
[01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:48.730]  I had in this container here, this plant sprouted and I had potatoes growing in there. It's living
[01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:56.410]  soil. And you can see how this roots totally fill up all that beautiful soil, right. And people
[01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:59.850]  talking about growing potatoes in there and then digging them out to give you a root space. Well,
[01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:05.210]  what you're doing is you're tearing apart all of your roots. You're not giving poor spaces.
[01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:12.170]  You've destroyed your structure of your roots to get these potatoes out. Okay. And I literally
[01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:15.610]  grew those as a demonstration. I hope you can see what I just did there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:22.650]  So you want to put plant potatoes next to your cannabis for sure. Not necessarily. Unless you're
[01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:27.530]  going to do what I just did there was dig it up afterwards. But on top of that, they use the exact
[01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:35.850]  same nutrient profile. I see. Yeah. So, so while that container had plenty enough for the cannabis
[01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:42.570]  plant to grow flowers, I had to feed it because the potatoes ate all of nitrogen primarily, but
[01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:48.570]  it's a huge phosphorus eater also. And like I just scratched my head when I see people promoting that
[01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:53.690]  concept. It's like, no, you're, you're destroying your root zone and you're creating massive
[01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:58.410]  competition for the nutrients that the plants need. So you got to think those kinds of things
[01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:03.450]  through as to what makes a good companion plant. And that takes years of trial and error
[01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:08.650]  and observation. So that might be something we would look to some of the traditional
[01:40:09.610 --> 01:40:15.050]  people. I don't really see that happening in the traditional fields. Right. It tends to be a monocrop.
[01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:23.210]  So that's really interesting. I mean, I think the whole thing with like squash,
[01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:28.490]  you know, using something like that as like a ground cover sounds, sounds like it could really
[01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:35.690]  work. I mean, my only hesitation is just like a lot of our squash gets powder mildew, but you know.
[01:40:35.770 --> 01:40:42.970]  Okay. Straight up on that one. I was tripping out on Zantanol was bringing this up and, and I know
[01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:47.050]  that the guy's a straight academic and is learning the stuff and presenting a lot of information.
[01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:53.770]  And this is one that I get is a big question is, but he was talking about having trough contamination.
[01:40:53.770 --> 01:41:02.570]  And I have for 20 something years had tomato and squash, Cucumber at severe PM. This sets in at
[01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:07.690]  the end of August here. And they're literally touching my cannabis plants. And I have never
[01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:15.050]  once had a crop. I've never seen PM on my cannabis. And it's a different strain. It's a very different
[01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:20.490]  genetic strain. I've never again. Yeah. And there's this year I had an observation of,
[01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:26.410]  I've been trying to get the Cinderella pumpkin to grow here and it likes cold weather. So it won't
[01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:30.650]  flower. It won't fruit in the mid summer heat. And then it just takes off running in the fall,
[01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:36.410]  but it never, it never gets anything bigger than that big as a fruit because it freezes as soon
[01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:40.810]  as it starts to, it gets happy enough to do its thing. But that one it's, you know,
[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:46.010]  it was developed in France and really moist, cool weather. I've never seen PM on it at all.
[01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:54.170]  All right. So we have genetic resistance and we have different specific pathogen
[01:41:54.170 --> 01:42:01.690]  target plant host relationships with PM. Right. So yeah, that's definitely,
[01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:08.810]  I don't remember ever seeing it in California. So it's when I was a kid in Southern Cal,
[01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:16.170]  but you know, and I left, I lived in central California until 97 growing every year. And
[01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:21.370]  that was never, never anything I had any recollection of until I got back into the
[01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:30.010]  internet community here and teaching on, and Probiotic Farmers Alliance started hearing about
[01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:36.730]  PM. But again, also I've never brought clones in from anywhere. Right. So I've never introduced
[01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:44.490]  that stuff to me and it obviously doesn't come through seed. So yeah.
[01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:52.410]  Tons of it in the Bay Area. I would argue that clone trading, but also like small tents
[01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:58.810]  and people growing in tents. You know what I mean? Cause like a tent is a difficult environment to
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:04.010]  have a plant be happy to have the right air circulation, to have everything the plant
[01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:10.010]  really needs to be. It really is small spaces. They're really hard to homogenize.
[01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:13.290]  The bigger your space, the easier it is for sure.
[01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:19.770]  Yeah. I mean, that's what I would say is in my opinion, I mean, I'm fighting powder mildew,
[01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:22.970]  you know, when my grow room is not peak condition.
[01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:30.570]  So I have several varieties of hops that grow here. Right. I've never had it on the hops.
[01:43:31.530 --> 01:43:34.970]  Yeah, I definitely, I definitely have a boy.
[01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:47.700]  Cutting out a little bit. You have a couple of tracks issues.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:52.420]  I just walk a little far away from the house there.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.540]  I just walk a little far away from the house there.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:04.580]  Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Let's see.
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:13.380]  Honestly, like botrytis issues to me means at least that your buds are fat.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:18.020]  That's primarily, that's the biggest, the biggest.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.700]  You know, with a lot of varieties, you just kind of have to start harvesting once you get,
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.740]  like for me, it's like once I get three big pieces of botrytis, at that point, I know I
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:31.140]  need to start cutting things down or else it's gonna, you know, start going really quickly.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:36.180]  Right. Right. There's different strategies for sure. I like just cutting it out,
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:38.980]  removing the large piece and letting the lower.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:44.740]  I can't remember the fellow's name, but guy in central, or northern Cal was saying how it's,
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.300]  generally it's, if your tops are gone, the rest of it's like two weeks
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:54.900]  before you're really at peak ripeness. If you're in those situations and whatnot.
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:45:03.140]  You know, I was hoping to be in that, in that space, like, like I cut out all my tops and like
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:08.420]  waiting for the lowers to come out, but it's, I'm just, everything is ready at the same time.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:10.580]  Cause the weather is so nice.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.060]  Some, I had great weather this fall too and got things out. And then we had,
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:19.540]  they said, deep freeze coming and it never really came hard. Like they said, and I'm like, gosh,
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:24.500]  I could have let a few things go, but now I'm dry trimming. I'm like, no, they're perfect.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:29.460]  This is all just fine. So exactly. I mean, it seems like, you know,
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:35.060]  This might sound kind of conspiratorial or it seems like the seasons are flowering earlier and
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:43.060]  earlier every year. Slightly. I, I, I had some pretty early stuff that I was expected mid August
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:48.020]  this year. And it started, it was like dropping pollen and August 1st this year. I won't,
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:54.740]  I'm not gonna, there's, but on a whole nother note, we seem to like have our
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:00.980]  frosts later and later here. Right. And we, but we also had like this year that
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:06.340]  Beldiacrop, we had a freeze in May, which is like a month late. We usually are,
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:13.700]  everyone's planting tomatoes on Mother's Day and mid, mid May, we had a hard freeze this year,
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.540]  which is just like, Ooh, that's kind of.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:22.020]  David, I think you're going to have to go back to the, to the, to the,
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:30.900]  to the, to the crop. I got scared with the Beldi because it's so tender, but
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.980]  I didn't lose a single plant. It did just fine.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.540]  That's awesome.
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:42.660]  Yeah, no, the plants are adapted to also, I, it's something that surprised me. Like
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:48.180]  the Nigerian Aruba Bantu has been like, I cold froze tested several times, several years ago,
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:52.500]  and it handles deep freeze just as fine as it does the 105 degrees.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.660]  Did you find that yours also had smaller trichomes?
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:02.660]  For which one?
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:03.860]  The Baldia?
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:10.340]  Baldia has extremely teeny weeny, itsy bitsy trichomes. The stock, the stock is like thicker
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:16.900]  than the trichome itself, which is kind of crazy. There's like, they're like teeny little pinheads.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:28.260]  And it's interesting like that. There's something from, have you, I'm sorry.
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.300]  Oh no, keep going, please.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:37.140]  Oh, sorry. A lot of them weren't really even turning amber at all. They were getting a
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:41.540]  little bit of milky to them. And I staggered the harvest a little bit to try and capture that,
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:47.140]  but it was reminding me somewhat of, there's other old land-raised hash plants I've grown,
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:55.380]  for instance, Tajikistan, that has an open feathery foxtail, long bran, long cola type
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:03.540]  of structure. And that thing would never go milky even. It was, the heads stayed, they were small,
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:11.780]  and they stayed clear forever. I pushed it out to pass the three month flower one time under tarps
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:14.900]  and never got amber, never got milk.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.820]  Did the bud start changing its structure though?
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:24.820]  I think I ended up starting to, it started to open up even more, right? Where they get to that
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:32.260]  point where it's like, I'm totally done and I'm starting to eutoliate again, right? And I've had
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:35.860]  other people who have grown some of the seed I've made from that who experienced similar, right? And
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:42.900]  so there's definitely some of that stuff. It's, you know, you see the different colors of hash,
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:48.180]  right? And Khalif was talking about how in Afghanistan, I think he was saying,
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.500]  as you said it, in Afghanistan, some people they'll leave it until it freezes, but that's just
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:58.180]  some, that's the red hash you see, was the stuff that's left to freeze on the stem. And then they
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:03.300]  cut it after it's froze dried. And then that's got a high CBN content. And then there's these
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:08.580]  others that again, they'll pick it when it's green and live because it's never gonna amber up.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.780]  And that's, you know, but those are, those are some of those regional differences I talk about
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:19.540]  where it doesn't necessarily have wild populations. They keep selecting for what works for
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:24.500]  them in that particular area. And that becomes that, that inbred regional heirloom.
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.100]  Yeah, it's kind of like a cheat. It's like a cheat past the land race level,
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:31.940]  you know, a couple.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:40.180]  Well, and so the modern definition for land race tends in most accepted academic structure is
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:49.380]  a prime, a primal agricultural plant that's been worked by the hand of man and has been there for
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:57.620]  long periods of time, multi-generation, multiple, they use the term time immemorial. Okay. And so
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:06.500]  that is like the academic usage is this is a crop, right? So we can talk about Ethiopian barley
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:13.540]  or these native American corns, right? They definitely are far from wild, but I can
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:20.580]  produce to socially aspects, growing these native American corns and you'll end up getting
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:27.300]  male parts coming out of the year, or you'll get kernels up on the top tassels. Okay. And so
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:34.900]  those are some of those ancient aspects of that, but it's nowhere been grown near a wild population
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:42.340]  for a thousand years. Okay. So yeah, with, again, with, with those different separations and land
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:48.100]  race, and I like to separate out what I'm talking about. So people know, well, that, that word
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:53.140]  encompasses so much when we say land race and it's like, well, is it this refined regional heirloom
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:51:00.660]  or is it, and yeah, those regional heirlooms can still be pretty squirrelly and wild and have
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:12.500]  intersex traits. And even if they're far from wild populations, it's just not something's.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:21.780]  Now we get into what's happening today, right? In the last 20, 30 years. And those, those plants
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:32.580]  have become a whole nother agricultural product with the anthropogenic translocative
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:40.900]  anthropomorphic translocative genetic pollution. Okay. And that's people moving seeds around,
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:44.980]  right. And bringing in the polyhybridized stuff into the fields and that stuff getting
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:55.060]  intermixed. Right. And, and so like, we look at traditional imagery of old Afghanistan,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:52:06.160]  black and white, pre pre Soviet occupation. We do not see a whole lot of plants that are head high.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:13.520]  Right. But today, the majority of plants that we see grown in Afghanistan that we might refer to
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:23.120]  as a land race in these fields, most of them are 10, 12 foot tall plants. All right. And even some,
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:28.080]  some of the stuff that I've gotten that I've thought was older and I'm growing these, it's
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:35.040]  like, wow, that's a huge, huge, huge plant for being Afghanica traditional genetics. And there's
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:40.080]  also the truth of the matter is like, again, the diversity of this wild populations do allow for
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:49.120]  some of that to happen as well. Here's a, you're sitting next to your cacti. There's my mothership.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:57.840]  So you got the sun behind it. Yeah. I, I, we don't have too much time. I, I'd love to dive into cactus
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:07.680]  just for a little bit. I'm actually kind of new to cactus, but I don't know. I mean, I have a
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:13.760]  fair amount, I guess, which would variety is this? So this is, this is this,
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:24.880]  it came from Temecula San Pedro cactus, the Peruvian flame. And I've never seen it flower out,
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:33.360]  but this is extremely prolific. And the original piece I got was this, this 18 inch base with three
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:42.240]  tops on it. And I've in four years produced probably over 300 feet and utilizing the same
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:49.840]  living soil we use for cannabis. Usually I've run it two or three cycles and then pop a cutting into
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.440]  it and let it go. I've got stuff in the ground as well in the greenhouse. It survives year round.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:04.400]  And, but I also collect like native wild cactus. I'm out hiking around and I see something I've
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.080]  never seen before. I'll grab a little piece of it and bring it back and have no idea what any
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.680]  of them are, but they're freaking awesome. Cause they survive. Right. Do you have any
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:24.240]  Bolivian torches? So again, yeah, that's what I'm sorry. I have that, that one is,
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:31.040]  I'm sorry. Not the Burke. I have the Pedro, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I have
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:41.280]  the park. That one's the pack fucking oil. This is the Bertrand C I've got that one too.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.560]  And so the, the Burgen see cut comes from
[01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:55.570]  just North of San Luis Obispo and old Spanish mission grounds.
[01:54:56.290 --> 01:55:00.450]  That's kind of fallen into the grant and into the, and it was like inside the wall there. And
[01:55:00.450 --> 01:55:06.850]  there's a, there's a cat. It's I've been interacting with over there for some time and
[01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:10.450]  might get a little loud. I got fans going. I'm going to step in the greenhouse here.
[01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:11.010]  So
[01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:20.610]  we've got a whole bunch in the ground. Oh, cool. You can see the humidity in here. That
[01:55:20.610 --> 01:55:25.490]  one's got some spots on it. I don't like it to be super humid.
[01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:34.610]  So you're mostly a San Pedro guy. Primarily as far as, but I also like, here's a
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:40.690]  Mexican fence posts. I've had this one and then down there is one of the little natives. I don't
[01:55:40.690 --> 01:55:45.010]  know if you can see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I saw it for a second. I guess move your camera over.
[01:55:45.010 --> 01:55:49.090]  Oh, that's cool. Is that like, looks kind of like an apple cactus.
[01:55:50.770 --> 01:55:57.330]  You know, it's got these long fingers, right? Yeah. And then it does have, I think it does
[01:55:57.410 --> 01:56:02.290]  And then it does have, I think it does fruit a very small little pair,
[01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:09.410]  little pair, right? A little, little, little fruit. What else is nothing else in here?
[01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:16.930]  Just a bunch of real. Some of these chilies are going on four years. Keep them in the greenhouse
[01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:27.480]  and keep them warm. Way too much. Just other stuff in here to get into. Here is the,
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:33.240]  this is the chocolate tie, the happy day chocolate tie, Acapulco gold hybrid.
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.480]  Let's see where am I at on the screen? There we go. Yeah. That looks interesting.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:45.400]  How much longer do you think that has to go? You know, so I had pulled tarp on it for a minute.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.240]  You can see on here, there's two different flower structure and I definitely have might
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:56.520]  issues this year. And I just applied mites again after defoliation. So some of it's like super
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:05.000]  developed and some of it's not. This one has got the worst response. A lot of times these long-run
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.640]  sativas will hold flower if you flip them and then just kind of let them go in an odd time.
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:18.120]  And out of all the freaking plants I had with early tarp pull and I stopped pulling tarps
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:24.200]  like September 1st instead of 15th this year, those fuckers reverted back into full veg.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:34.360]  And so they had 60 days already and then they're probably like 30 days back into flower again. So
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.640]  I'm going to let them go to like Thanksgiving probably and whack them. And then I'll have
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:43.080]  some super, super mature product and some stuff that's just like freshly finished on it. And
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:51.240]  I, I've not actually had those come through properly from start to finish on a tarp pull or
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:56.600]  they just stretch too much indoor and I don't really do a whole lot indoor anymore, period.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:06.600]  Freaking, I washed out the last stuff I had though. And it's like, it's like a tootsie pop.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:11.880]  I got a little, little roll of chocolate tie hash. It's just amazing.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.800]  That sounds really nice.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.320]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:22.520]  That sounds super nice. I wanted to do like just a quick educational thing on cactus.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:26.600]  Cause I know that, you know, a little bit, I know a lot, I know a little bit,
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.840]  but I'm just going to, just cause I know that, well, yeah, I just wanted to,
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:37.880]  cause I'm newly getting into it and didn't know that. So I'm just going to go in and then you can,
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:42.840]  you know, correct me if I'm wrong. So have at it. So my understanding is that, you know,
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:51.480]  these are sacred cactus and there are three main type of sacred cactus, four main type.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:56.360]  So the first one is the Pachinoi, which is what they call like a San Pedro. So this is
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:01.880]  what Hardy Gear was showing was a San Pedro. Here's an example of a San Pedro. This is like
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:08.760]  a super Pedro. They generally have short spines. Then the next variety is the Peruvianus.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:15.000]  Peruvianus are from Peru. They usually are like very big and robust and they have
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:21.880]  usually longer spines. I don't have one in front of me, but.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:27.400]  They get thick. They're like four to six inches across as opposed to two to four inches that these
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:27.960]  others are.
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:30.840]  And they kind of look like a star when you cut it. You know what I mean? Like the
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:34.200]  ridge pushing out like that.
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.920]  Do I got it? Let's see. There we go.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:37.420]  Yeah.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:47.160]  Yeah. So yeah, that'd be a Peruvianus. And then the last one would be a, excuse me. Then there's
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:54.680]  for Jesse, which is from Bolivia. And that one has usually the longest spines and usually like
[01:59:54.680 --> 02:00:02.200]  the craziest looking spines in general. And then the next one is the San Pedro.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:12.760]  In general. And then the last category would be the Lephora. Is that what it's called?
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.280]  Lophe. We just call them Lophe.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:20.840]  Lophe. And that would be like of the peyote button family. And in general,
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:30.120]  people encourage you to not use peyote buttons because it's endangered and to rather
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:38.920]  use cactus, which are a much more renewable resource. They're much more easier to grow.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.920]  But there are people who also grow peyote buttons and those types of cactus
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  that they get seeds from. So you can buy seeds of all of these things and grow them yourself.
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:56.280]  And there's some really interesting cultures in like Asia where people have these like crazy
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.480]  peyote buttons. It looks like a head of broccoli. And they're, I don't know,
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.160]  are they like hundreds of years old or like.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:03.480]  Jesse Hawkins
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.200]  There were tens of thousands of dollars they're purchased and sold as living art. They're
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:14.280]  not consumed whatsoever in those cultures. And it's pretty amazing. Some of the granddaddies
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:19.240]  they have is they'll have these ancient, yeah, hundreds and hundreds of years old. And then
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.800]  the, they sprout pups off the sides. And so it's just like this compressed, but they'll have
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:34.440]  different contorted, you know, cactus can get these variations where they're spinning and
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:39.720]  folded into each other and stuff. And I'm right off the top. I'm not remembering the name of that
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:46.360]  distortion or mutation, but definitely as surprised as the sacred beauty of them alone,
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.920]  right in those cultures. It's pretty impressive to see.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.680]  Jesse Hawkins
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.760]  Yeah. I mean, you know, they also, you can also consume them, but like not even getting into that,
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:03.240]  like the beauty in them. I mean, like here, I'm sharing this one with you guys is like
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:08.920]  my favorite cactus. And I just love how like the tip of it kind of comes out like that.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.080]  Jesse Hawkins
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.960]  And sacred geometry. And they express sacred geometry. And you get a bunch of them growing
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:21.240]  together or you have them pots arranged and the light hitting them and stuff. They're definitely
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:27.000]  a beautiful plant to have around. And you know, like, it was really interesting. I was,
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:36.040]  one day I was, how do I say this? I think I was, I think I had some mushrooms and I looked at my
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:44.600]  cactus and all of a sudden, I felt like they were looking at me. And I like acknowledge them as like,
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.480]  and you know, as like my friends and like, like they had their own like energy and I was just
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.920]  like looking at them and they were like, giving me this vibe. And I'm like, am I giving myself
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.760]  this vibe? Or is it these cactus that are giving me this vibe? And I'm like, whoa, these are my
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:07.800]  homies. Like they're gonna be with me for years. And also like just a totally geeky aspect of this
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:14.360]  is like, I love collecting cannabis strains. And it's very difficult to keep all the various
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.400]  strains that you want and to have them growing. And we have plant counts and all of these different
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:25.560]  things like that. Yes, there's also scapula cola. I'm sorry to not mention that one. And,
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:30.280]  you know, with cactus, it's cool because you can have many different varieties. You can keep them
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:36.360]  alive forever. And you can kind of keep that itch of always wanting the new whatever, the old
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:41.480]  whatever. There's no cactus plant counts. You can have as many as you like.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:46.040]  Well, technically the loft unless you have a card like I do that says you're
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:52.440]  the first amendment medicine man. You're not supposed to have the loft with the peyote buttons,
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.760]  but there yeah, there ain't no peyote police coming around ripping your doors down because
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.440]  you have a plant cactus drawn. And I you know, I don't have any peyote isn't for now I'm okay with
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:07.640]  just having you know, tricosteros cactus, you know, I really hard to grow actually,
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:13.160]  the peyote people have been given seed several times and, and the next time I know it's got to
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:19.800]  any sort of insect will eat that thing. And it's been it's when they're in the pinky,
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.840]  pinky finger size stage, right? Yeah, like you got this beautiful little garden of cactus growing
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:29.720]  and also then just disappear and it's like, what the fuck is it is the I finally found it. It's
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.440]  like it could be a pill bug or any any little thing in your organic garden and those things
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  are just they're tasty little morsels. So, so the only my only beef with cactusing is it's very
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:50.120]  difficult to grow seedlings. Yep, it's difficult to grow seedlings. And, and then the other thing
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:54.760]  is just like avocado everything will every single seedlings an individual and you don't know what,
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:59.880]  you know, if it's going to be anything representing the parent or some total offshoot,
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:08.600]  you know, as far as the, the, the phytochemistry goes, right? So, the one I've got, both the ones
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.920]  I've got were searched out by people in California who spent a lot of time going through a lot of
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:28.440]  cactus to find particular qualities, so to speak, the sacred cactus and the, the, the traditions in
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:32.360]  South America. So, my first wife actually went down and lived down in the Yakama Desert and
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:37.240]  studied with, lived with medicine men for quite some time and I'm, we've just reconnected in the
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:42.600]  last couple of years. So, I'm still learning from her about what she learned and due to heart
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:49.480]  conditions and stuff, she can no longer take the sacred plants into her system and stuff. But,
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:57.880]  things I have learned since reconnecting with her is that the tobacco taught the human about the
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:04.600]  cactus that taught the human about all the other plants. So, the, the, the original grandfather
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:14.680]  teacher was the tobacco and tobacco told human to, to make the cactus and then, like, the vine,
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:19.640]  the vine and the herbs, the ayahuasca came after the cactus as well. The cactus taught about the,
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:25.960]  the other spirits and the different plants. So, it's, you know, we talk about it being sacred and,
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:31.240]  and that's, it's not just because we, as Westerners, like to get high. These things come from a long
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:38.840]  tradition, thousands of years of, of human beings in the forest interacting with, being one with,
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:45.240]  and all the, you know, it's said by these shaman in the jungles that all the knowledge and all
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:49.560]  of the understanding of what it is to be a human being and how they interact and all the food and
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:55.000]  all the structures and everything they have come from the teachings that originated from the tobacco
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:01.160]  and the cactus and the vines. And we're so detached in Western civilization that,
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:05.400]  you know, we make, we make knowledge illegal.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:14.680]  Yeah, I mean, I will say, like, the first time I experienced cactus, the first thing I really did
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:20.520]  was start laughing because I was like, this is nothing like what the media made it seem to be like.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:27.320]  I was, you know, I just thought this was hilarious. I was like, I totally drank the Kool-Aid. I thought,
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:33.000]  you know, and like, as soon as I was like, oh my God, I see now. Okay, like, you know, and it's
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:41.960]  true. It's like the knowledge and the information that you, it's like, if you're, it's only going to
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:46.600]  work with the knowledge that's there. But, you know, like, if there are some things that you
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:53.560]  needed to tell yourself, you know, you can have those important conversations with yourself.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:04.920]  And yeah, I mean, it's, it's like, it's, it's, it's hilarious how like the things that you need
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:09.880]  can be like, so right in front of you type of thing where it's like, really, this is what,
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:14.200]  it's this powerful, and it's this easy to grow. And it's, you know, it's this easy to get. And
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:19.400]  it's just like a plant that I can have in my life. Like, really, it's, you know, it's that simple.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:29.240]  Um, let's see. I'm trying to get this. There it is. All right. That's an image. My first
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:37.560]  wife took the photographs of me when I met the shaman in the Grand Canyon.
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:43.460]  And 30 varieties of cacti is made from an ear to go sprouting.
[02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:48.590]  I'm sorry, say that again, please.
[02:08:49.710 --> 02:08:52.910]  So that picture I'm showing, I was just reading that out loud. And we'll get to that sprouting.
[02:08:53.950 --> 02:09:02.830]  So, so I'm in the Grand Canyon. And I had actually just consumed about a quarter ounce of mushrooms
[02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:08.830]  and walk down to the waterfall and end up seeing this guy sitting there and I go over and try to
[02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:17.070]  talk to him. And we, we didn't speak words, but we had a conversation. But he was, he consumed peyote.
[02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:26.910]  So the title of that is Little Smoke and Mescalito. And the later on when we talked about
[02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:33.070]  what he was doing was, we had a major flood in the canyon and it wiped out the village. People
[02:09:33.070 --> 02:09:36.910]  had died. It wiped out their, what was the main attraction to the village for the tourists and
[02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:42.510]  how they had their income was these deep pools of sky blue green water. And it filled in,
[02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:46.830]  it filled in the pools with the debris. And so he was praying to the
[02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:55.470]  spiritual embodiment of God, the spirit of the waterfall through peyote ceremony to try and find
[02:09:55.470 --> 02:10:00.910]  answers as to how they're supposed to stay economically viable still. Right. And that's
[02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:07.790]  literally what he was in deep knowledge and thought process of when I approached him. And
[02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:15.310]  kind of crazy how our interactions move forward from there. But yeah, that's, that's what, you
[02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:21.710]  know, he was out using the plant as a tool to communicate with the higher power to find real
[02:10:21.710 --> 02:10:29.630]  answers in today's world of economic, you know, requirements and stuff. And that was, that's 20,
[02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:38.190]  30 years ago. That was a bit of a 92, I think when that went down and they ended up asking me
[02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:42.350]  into the sweat lodge with them and teach them about it. They came by the camp and ate some
[02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:48.910]  of the green butter and mystical experience from, from green. We tried to get them to not take so
[02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:58.110]  much, but like we can handle it. And they disappeared for a few days and yeah.
[02:10:58.270 --> 02:11:05.950]  That's awesome. Hey, I am is work with many rangers
[02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:15.550]  my forest service badge. Wow. You're saying you're, you're a firefighter. Oh, I did. I did 10
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:20.270]  years. That's what my degree in forestry. And like I came to Utah to run the inmate fire crew
[02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:26.110]  for the state is the state's forester firefighter crew. I was the crew boss for that. And I had left
[02:11:26.110 --> 02:11:34.350]  my job in Los Angeles, the Angeles national forest is a I was the law enforcement for, for the
[02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:39.630]  forest service right on the district. I grew up playing on as a kid, grew up in Arcadia.
[02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:47.630]  But yeah, that's, that was my career path primarily. And, you know, it was 96 when we
[02:11:47.630 --> 02:11:52.510]  passed medical in California and I came out here using medical. I didn't know I'd already
[02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:56.270]  broken my neck and stuff. And cannabis is the only thing that made me feel like a human being
[02:11:57.070 --> 02:12:03.070]  and I lost job, right. You know, two years later for it. And, but you couldn't,
[02:12:04.670 --> 02:12:09.950]  I only place I could get it was driving back to California. And so right off the bat, I had to
[02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:15.550]  start into figuring out how to get it to grow out here when, you know, and up until recently it's
[02:12:15.550 --> 02:12:22.430]  all been in hidden in a closet, right. But the whole world has changed. And, and, and, and, and
[02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:29.710]  is listening up and, you know, I got an active Congress that backs me up now that,
[02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:35.550]  so that's a, you might not know this. People might know that I had
[02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:42.430]  a guy I refer to as my mentor. He's passed on now, but Rob Raleigh was blessed to be
[02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:45.310]  what we would call a trust to Fari and both of his parents were
[02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:53.030]  Nobel prize winning cancer researchers. And so he was blessed to live on this piece of
[02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:59.030]  property in Vermont. It was like a family farm from the 15 hand hewn buildings when they had 1500,
[02:12:59.030 --> 02:13:07.190]  late 1600s. And he traveled the world, 26 countries collecting land race and situ
[02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:13.030]  back in the day on the hippie trail, starting in what he collected,
[02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:17.670]  land race in situ. He traveled the world to the places on the hippie trail where
[02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:26.950]  the plant, the sweet spots were from about 1968 till about, about 95 or something in there.
[02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:34.310]  And he was interbreeding these things on this property and, and, you know, he had mashed up
[02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:39.030]  26 different land races that he collected around the world and the feds came and bought it.
[02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:45.990]  He had the blessings that come to him as far as the finances. So he never like considered
[02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:50.870]  him own his own or greedy. So he helped a lot of people out. And one of the things he did was he
[02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:57.110]  had adopted the young fellow who grew up in third generation white person on reservation,
[02:13:57.110 --> 02:14:02.390]  participating in sweat lodge and way house ceremonies with coyote. And he was able to
[02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:08.150]  white person on reservation, participating in sweat lodge and way house ceremonies with coyote.
[02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:13.750]  And he was incarcerated here at the state when I was running the inmate fire crew.
[02:14:14.710 --> 02:14:21.110]  And there was several inmates who were native Americans who worked for me. And they all were in
[02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:26.790]  a lawsuit against the state to allow them their first amendment rights to sweat lodge while in
[02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:31.910]  prison. And having been sweat lodged at that point for eight years myself, since my first,
[02:14:32.710 --> 02:14:37.830]  I almost became a Catholic priest coming out of Jesuit school and went into sweat lodge at the
[02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:42.790]  age of 18 and had more spiritual and mystic experience in four hours than I had in four
[02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:49.270]  years of going to all boys Catholic school, right. And church several times a week and actually going
[02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:56.550]  out and I took acid with priests and shit, had some pretty crazy experiences, but this was like
[02:14:56.550 --> 02:15:01.190]  whole nother level stuff. And so I was supplying firewood to the inmates who wanted to sweat.
[02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:09.510]  And that ended up becoming a lawsuit that went to the federal level and first amendment rights. And
[02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:17.190]  in the year 2000, the act of Congress was passed that extrapolates and delineates people's
[02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:22.470]  first amendment rights to plant medicine, sacred earth, sacred plants. And it's not like,
[02:15:23.110 --> 02:15:28.790]  you may have heard like rip, Eddie left and he tried to jump on the bandwagon. There's different
[02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:33.670]  people in California who were like opening up pseudo dispensaries or false dispensaries saying
[02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:39.190]  they were part of the member of the church and they would get shut down because it wasn't really
[02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:51.190]  true of heart or whatnot. They were illegal dispensaries, but cactus, mushroom, cannabis all,
[02:15:51.190 --> 02:15:53.910]  and this has gone to the Supreme, gone to the federal court a couple of times after
[02:15:56.870 --> 02:16:04.070]  plant matter was confiscated by the post office and destroyed and shipped out to Hawaii. My mentor
[02:16:04.070 --> 02:16:07.590]  sued the federal government again and again, because they said, oh yeah, you're right. We
[02:16:07.590 --> 02:16:11.990]  screwed up. We shouldn't have destroyed that. It says US money and like, oh, we can't pay you.
[02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:14.470]  And it's like, well, I'm suing you again to make sure you never do this again. And
[02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:19.590]  so like I can heal people. I can help people out. I can do, you know, and now seeds are legal and
[02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:25.670]  stuff like that. It's way looser. And all my neighbors, I supplied the Norman, the Mormon
[02:16:25.670 --> 02:16:29.830]  neighbor, the devout Mormon, he was telling me he had tendonitis of the elbow. And I'm like,
[02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:34.470]  well, here's some plant medicine. And here it is in the scripture of the old testament where God
[02:16:34.470 --> 02:16:39.910]  said, this is what we, you know, this is a good plant. And there's, so it's, things are different
[02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:46.790]  now than they were before. You know, I've been in cages and arrested by all three federal
[02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:49.830]  governments, agents of all three federal governments in North America for personal
[02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:56.790]  plant medicine. This is a small group of people in the world that can say that, but anymore,
[02:16:56.790 --> 02:17:02.630]  and it ain't going to happen as again, we're progressing and moving forward and making the
[02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:07.190]  world a better place for everybody. And so I'm like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[02:17:07.350 --> 02:17:16.040]  Making the world a better place for everybody. I think you got muted.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.400]  Oh, I was going to say, I agree. I mean, that's one of the good things about legalization is it
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:28.040]  is becoming more normalized and, you know, we can have these conversations freely about these
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:34.440]  things. Then also it kind of chips away at these other taboo subjects that before, you know, we
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:39.320]  would never be able to touch on. And now we can just kind of start to scratch the surface. You
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:45.240]  know, I mean, now like mushrooms are not really a big deal anymore. You know, and now there are
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.480]  these other things that people are like, oh, there are these other things. And if you take them,
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:56.120]  you're not necessarily going to go insane for three days. Or the rest of your life. Or the
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:01.960]  rest of your life and all kinds of weird stuff. You do put the glasses on though, and you can
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:07.720]  never take the glasses off. And that's where it's like people who never put the glasses on think
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:13.000]  you're insane because you see reality for what it is, not what it's presented to sell you something
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:20.040]  as. And not everybody should drink and not everybody should do, you know, do certain drugs.
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:24.760]  Like it's not for everybody. And I mean, what I always tell people is like, you're going to learn
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:30.280]  something, but it may not be what you wanted. Right now. I agree there. And something else is
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:37.800]  just like we all react a little different to any given cannabis plant. Yeah. Not everybody's
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.520]  chemistry and mental state reacts the same to any of these other chemistries. We're just, you know,
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:49.320]  we're touching on those things are all some people can take a huge hit of LSD and only see a light
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:54.680]  show. And someone else takes that exact same hit at the same time next to him and walks in another
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:00.520]  direction and solves the mysteries of the universe. Never sees a color fly before their eyes.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:12.760]  Right. It's yeah. Yeah. You definitely don't want to be in a bad place. That's step number. No.
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:22.360]  You want my poor daughter was given it. She was 14 or I think she was 14 and somebody gave her a
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:27.560]  hit of acid at a social party without any context or knowledge of what was about to happen.
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:37.160]  No guidance, no babysitter, no nothing. And three years of her dealing with that experience.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:45.880]  Right. And so it's like, no, she's not going to go in another acid. But compare that to I was 15
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.840]  years old and was given four four way window panes at a Grateful Dead concert.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.960]  Yeah, that's a very, very, very different experience. Very different context.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:05.640]  Very different place for a state of mind. And right. Yeah. And one thing I always would
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:09.640]  encourage people is, you know, you can eat edibles if you have that itch. You're like,
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:13.880]  I kind of want to get fucked up. But you're not sure how fucked up you want to get. You can always
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:20.360]  have an edible. You'll go to sleep that night. It's very safe. And even if you overdo it a little
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:25.320]  bit, you'll just be like, I'm cool on edibles for a little bit. Like I can honestly say that kept me
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:32.200]  out of a lot of trouble as a 20 something year old because, you know, it's nice to experiment
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:39.160]  with things. But it's also nice to not learn the hard way. Like I've had edibles and been like,
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:43.400]  shit, well, I'm glad I didn't do anything else last night because that would have just been
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.200]  you know, trouble.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:53.240]  Daughter's mother is going through cancer right now and she's on the back end of it, right? One
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:58.680]  of the hardest things I had was getting her to utilize plant medicine because she had bad
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:03.480]  experiences with edible. Leaving here, going to Portland where it's legal, hanging out with
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:07.240]  cousins and they're not regular users, didn't know. They're like, oh, let's take you to the
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:12.360]  pot shop. And she went and bought a candy bar. Like, oh, yummy chocolate. Nom, nom, nom, nom,
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:16.920]  and instead of going to the Space Needle, she occupied the couch for a day and a half,
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:21.480]  right? Like, I hate that feeling. And then somebody else is like, oh, you just like had
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:25.800]  the wrong stuff. You need to, and they give them some modern day weed and she's like,
[02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:31.880]  fuck that. I'm not touching it again. And it's like, how do I explain to you? I don't even
[02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:38.200]  activate it. I'm working with THCA, right? And like, that's a whole other thing that I was
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:43.400]  starting to pop onto there was you're talking about TCA. If you got issues besides if you want
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:50.840]  to get high, TCA is way more strong medicine. Non-activated, slow, cool extraction processes,
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:22:02.600]  dry sift and ice hash, raw, is way better medicine on so many levels. You can take 10 times more
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:10.920]  into your system without having to go to sleep or even sit down effects and deal with your
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:18.040]  inflammation, deal with craving, other addictions, okay? And various other things that is going to
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:27.000]  come in and occupy those receptor sites and deal with stress, anxiety. All of those functions can
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  be dealt with better with THCA than the Delta 9. And I really, really, really, really wish more
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:44.600]  people could understand that. And yet I wish there was more consumables available in the
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:52.200]  dispensaries and stuff for folks. But that's something I encourage people to experiment with
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:59.560]  to figure it out as well. I would argue if you're not like a pod head like us,
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.120]  start low. You know what I mean? You can start low and you'll get a tolerance and then you can
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:11.400]  keep building up more and more in your system and your body doesn't have that high feeling if you
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:22.440]  don't want that. So yeah. I would be shocked. I mean, my last vacation and I spent 46 days in the
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:29.080]  county and I came back out and went right back to my normal. I understand how people OD heroin.
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:36.360]  It was like I took two hits of my favorite medicine that I normally would take. And I have
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:42.440]  I've been without anything for my, I have seven discs on my spine. I have no cupping left in my
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:46.520]  vertebrae. Every one of my discs has been compressed. I've broken my neck twice. I have
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:51.480]  extreme severe arthritic issues that I deal with day to day. I don't have an ACL on the right side.
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:55.880]  I don't have an NCL PCL or cartilage on the left side. Right. If you're like, how the fuck do you
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:00.680]  walk? How do you stand up? How do you, my mom says like, you're in pain all the time, Alex. And when
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:04.840]  you say that stuff helps, it's like, mom, what part of I broke my neck twice and never even knew
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:12.280]  it. Don't you understand? But it's that THCA that allows me to actually function as a human being.
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:19.240]  But again, I wanted to medicate and I wanted to fucking feel good. And the first thing I did was
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:25.000]  hit that bong and I was hallucinating. I was fucking out of it. I'm like, holy shit. My heart
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:31.240]  was racing. Right. I couldn't fucking breathe because I totally OD'd on some super potent weed
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:38.200]  that was my norm for dealing with day to day issues when I was beat up on the front lot and
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:47.400]  handcuffed and hauled off. For misdemeanor. Whole different set of stories there. But
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:54.760]  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's start small. Like I couldn't, it was hard for me to titrate back down
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:25:00.280]  and get that. And before I built tolerance back up, which was, it took almost a month to where I could
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:09.800]  consume those normal levels again. Another one is CBD. You don't want to get high off your
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:16.760]  fucking ass. The first time I experienced the CBD and I was sent some dabs that had CBD dabs
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:25.640]  mixes and across the board and full strength THC. And I equated it to
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:32.680]  the Romans at a food orgy purging, right. And putting their finger down their throat. It's like,
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:39.400]  wait a second. I can take a bigger hit of THC if I take a little dab of CBD first.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.920]  And what's going on is they go in and occupy those receptor sites that make you high.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:47.880]  The CBD does. And even if it's a mix, it gets in there faster than the Delta nine does.
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.200]  And so if you do need Delta nine for whatever your ailment is and you don't like getting that
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:58.680]  high, you can do a one-to-one or two-to-one CBD to THC or whatever it is that works for you
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:07.560]  and figure that one out. And you know, what strains have that right ratio are Landry strains.
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:12.760]  Those are the ones that really have that really more dependable than anything.
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:19.000]  So many times when somebody is like, dude, I tested that, whatever it was, and it was a three to one.
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:25.240]  Whatever it was, and it was a three to one, right? That seems to be what the ancients were
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:30.840]  hitting as the perfect medicine and their selection or whatever, however it came out to be.
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:38.840]  But that was what, maybe that's just what it came out to naturally over time in mixed
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:45.080]  open pollination. But that does tend to be a good observation.
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:51.320]  Interesting. Yeah, that's awesome. Super awesome. Well, hey man, is there anything else you wanted
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:54.440]  to touch on? I was thinking we could wrap her up.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:27:01.240]  Oh man, yeah, I know. It goes on forever and ever. Definitely. I got garden work to do myself and
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:07.000]  appreciate letting me come on and say hi to folks and play reindeer games and teach a little bit
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:15.320]  about land race and the way I see things and shout out people come on over tomorrow. I'm doing
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  something not exactly sure what it is tomorrow morning. Hatch a wean. I trip out on there ain't
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.120]  no such thing as hatch a wean. We got cropped over and it gets cold for Halloween is the perfect
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:33.080]  time to start making hash. So maybe I'm just going to break out all the old scary black monster hash.
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:35.000]  The hash graveyard.
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:45.080]  Awesome. Well, man, I appreciate it. I hope that we can do some future collaborations and
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:55.640]  yeah, man, I definitely exceeded my expectations. Yeah, I think we have some future conversations
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.200]  that would be really good. Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. I think the first time I
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:05.560]  Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. I think the first time I actually caught Future Cannabis Project live
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:13.400]  was one of your first interviews with Peter, if I'm not mistaken, and about two years ago.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.440]  Was it with James Loud?
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:18.760]  It might well have been. And I was like super stoked. I'm like, fuck, I caught one of these
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:28.280]  Future Cannabis Lives, blah, blah, blah. And you guys were talking about the, oh gosh,
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.520]  XSIT2. We worked with XSIT2's work?
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.040]  That must have been somebody else.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:37.480]  Okay, okay. Nope. And then straighten that one out. Yeah, a couple of years ago.
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:45.160]  Yeah, yeah, no, it's a, so that was somebody I've worked with and, and like Deepak, I've done a lot
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:51.640]  of interaction with Deepak and I've heard you mentioned Red Scare. If I ever were to just like
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:56.360]  roll over and say, I can't do this anymore, Red Scare is where I'd send my entire Landrace
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:57.080]  collection to him.
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.640]  That's what I got some Balochistan from him because he's like the,
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:04.280]  The hub?
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:08.840]  Well, yeah, he's the, the rep for Indian Landrace Exchange.
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:09.400]  Right, right.
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:18.600]  Yeah. Yeah, no, he's, he's awesome guy. I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's really cool that,
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:23.960]  you know, there's people who, there always have been people who are collecting Landrace. I think
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.360]  it's cool that it's becoming the cooler thing to do. I think that that's awesome.
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:34.680]  Yeah, yeah. No, even if it's just a, a genetic in my collection, because people like to collect
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:39.880]  things, have it there, right? And support the people who are, who are doing the work because
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:45.640]  it is, it is a thankless job to run these scraggly strains and reproduce the seed just for
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:52.520]  reproducing that for some future. And this is, let me hit this on the nail. Like I was talking
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:58.600]  with Mowgli and almost went to work with him. I almost sold him my seed collection, my seed bank.
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:05.560]  I have one of the larger collections of like pre-prohibition hemp gymnosperm that came out of
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:13.240]  some of the seed banks that closed down out of Europe. Okay. And so, but he's, I'm all about
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:17.960]  this preservation and expansion because we have science. We're still just starting scratching on,
[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:22.440]  right? And this breeding and understanding this plant and looking at its various potentials.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:30.280]  And he wanted to just find the PM resistance genetic. And if he couldn't find it in the
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:35.480]  gymnosperm as a little seedling, when he, you know, took, took the freaking cotyledon and ran
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:40.920]  it through his genetic testing, he was going to destroy the entire plant. And it's like, no, no,
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:45.800]  no, no, no, no, no. There's only like six of these seeds in the world that needs to be reproduced.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:52.280]  You can't do that. You got to reproduce these seeds. You can't, right. I mean, I got stuff
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:56.680]  from New Zealand right now. It's only males. And then I got other stuff that's only females.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:01.960]  And I I'm the only person in the world that have these seeds as far as I know. And, and like one
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:07.560]  of them, the guy was killed in the raid, right. And there's totally thankless to reproduce a low
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:14.360]  grade and hemp plant. Yeah. Other than we don't actually know what that plant that grew in New
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:21.000]  Zealand forever, how long has it been? It's like, it's thankless until it's not, you know,
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:26.760]  like I have a plant that's sterile. And so like, I'm kind of like, okay, well, am I going to grow
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:33.880]  this for the bud? No. You know, but maybe could I reverse it onto something and make a sterile line?
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:44.280]  Possibly. Yeah. You know, collect. That's what I'm saying is collect and support the crazy people
[02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:50.360]  like me who do this stuff. The, the, like the, the deep rabbit hole day, I ain't making millions
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:53.880]  of dollars in a production facility. I know how to do that. I went to college and studied that
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:58.760]  shit. I can do it just fine, but I have a completely different passion to find the
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:05.000]  medicines that are lost in these hidden strains that are. It's like, if you don't support people,
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.080]  if you don't buy stuff, then breeders aren't going to make it. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:12.840]  And I'm not the only one right now. My vault's kind of closed down a little bit. I'm going to
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:20.520]  try and open up and make more available, get more to Peter at the, the dog, etc. And stuff. And
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:25.960]  that I've been going through things financially, mentally, I'm not making enough money at all to
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:30.280]  pay for it anymore. And I had to go get a job and taking a job takes up a shit ton of time from
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:37.320]  doing that kind of work. So yeah, I'll be honest, if I was working in the cannabis industry,
[02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:40.440]  I would not be doing this podcast. I wouldn't have the time.
[02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:43.640]  You don't have time because you got to work. You got to grind it so hard because you're
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:48.360]  going against that capital. You're going against Budweiser to produce a micro brew,
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:55.320]  you know, or you've got a job as a wage earner. Yeah. That's where it's at right now.
[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:56.840]  Well, I appreciate you taking the time.
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.800]  Appreciate you too. Yep.
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:06.520]  And yeah, thanks everybody in the chat for the show. Again, you can get Hardy Gear at
[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:10.760]  dogga and you can probably send him a DM as well, probably.
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:16.760]  Yeah. Go direct, find me on Instagram and then I'll send you an email. And right now I'm kind
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:21.640]  of like, I'm trying to like nurse it along some folks and I need to build a new brochure. And then
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:24.680]  the next thing is I'm going to put together a website that really has all the information of
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:31.160]  all these different genetics I got, man, race and hybrids. Thank you so much.
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:33.160]  No, very cool. Support the local people.
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:34.760]  We'll trade for silver.
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:37.400]  Later.
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:41.890]  See you.
