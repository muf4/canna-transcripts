Hey, another African sativa field notes here.
This is Gambia.
So we'll need to, we'll pull up a map and show you where Gambia is.
So, but it's October 23rd and this one is actually very close to being finished.
This has more of the traditional African sativa, really sort of fluffy little spears going
on but the hairs are all starting to brown up quite a bit.
We only grew one of these plants this year.
We had, they were tougher to germinate.
We do have seeds though to back it up.
And this one just kind of has a sort of fabric softener kind of smell.
Really like old school bubble gum, like bazooka bubble gum, sort of that spice bubble gum
smell and kind of like a fabric softener, like the old pink fabric softener from like
the 70s and 80s that was liquid.
I don't like that substance in a bottle but when it's coming from a cannabis plant, it
smells interesting.
So anyway, Gambia, very, very cool and we'll be harvesting this before Halloween.
So right now it's October 23rd but cool plant, very primitive, primal, almost bush, bush
plant.
Okay.
