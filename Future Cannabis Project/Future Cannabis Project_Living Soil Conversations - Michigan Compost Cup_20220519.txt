[00:00.000 --> 00:01.500]  I'm like, I don't want to use EM1.
[00:01.500 --> 00:05.840]  So can I, can, and I guess Ken, Ken brought us live
[00:05.840 --> 00:08.000]  as I was in the middle of that.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.240]  But that's my curiosity is, you know,
[00:11.240 --> 00:15.760]  can you make Bokashi without reaching
[00:15.760 --> 00:19.240]  for that product called EM1?
[00:19.240 --> 00:21.040]  Because people have been making,
[00:21.040 --> 00:23.680]  maybe what is probably called Bokashi,
[00:23.680 --> 00:26.880]  but something along those lines for thousands of years
[00:26.880 --> 00:29.120]  before this Japanese scientist came up
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.120]  with his proprietary consortium and ratio of microbes, right?
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.560]  So since we are live, Brian, why don't you?
[00:41.540 --> 00:43.920]  Well, yeah, good morning to you living soil nerds.
[00:43.920 --> 00:46.080]  Behind the scenes, we've been already popping it up,
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.480]  picking organic Alexa's brain.
[00:48.480 --> 00:50.680]  Again, I'm just excited to have you on the show.
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.860]  There's a lot of people that are following you
[00:52.860 --> 00:54.580]  for a variety of reasons.
[00:54.620 --> 00:57.220]  One of those reasons, all of the educational content
[00:57.220 --> 00:59.140]  that you've been putting out on Instagram,
[00:59.140 --> 01:00.500]  and that's what Peter was actually talking about
[01:00.500 --> 01:03.300]  before we came live here on the show,
[01:03.300 --> 01:07.720]  is trying to understand things as things are progressing.
[01:08.820 --> 01:10.700]  Peter brought up Dr. Lane Ingham's belief,
[01:10.700 --> 01:13.660]  especially, you know, I would say maybe five years,
[01:13.660 --> 01:16.420]  six years ago, her belief systems on anaerobics
[01:16.420 --> 01:20.500]  and anaerobic microbes and her thought philosophy on that.
[01:20.500 --> 01:21.980]  When you're talking EM1,
[01:21.980 --> 01:25.060]  we briefly mentioned this yesterday with Marco.
[01:25.060 --> 01:26.300]  From what I understand, Peter,
[01:26.300 --> 01:29.420]  EM1 is just one gentleman's recipe
[01:29.420 --> 01:32.460]  that's kind of, you know, his own little formula there.
[01:32.460 --> 01:34.940]  He was able to patent it and it's EM1.
[01:34.940 --> 01:36.740]  If you wanted to create your own EM1,
[01:36.740 --> 01:38.460]  for lack of a better term,
[01:38.460 --> 01:41.460]  that's now called IMO or indigenous microorganisms.
[01:41.460 --> 01:43.820]  So Alexa, if you kind of wanted to get more
[01:43.820 --> 01:45.940]  into that aspect, I'm gonna have a lot of things
[01:45.940 --> 01:49.340]  and a lot of questions to chop your brain up with.
[01:49.340 --> 01:50.900]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:50.900 --> 01:53.940]  So I'm no expert on EM.
[01:54.820 --> 01:59.820]  I started Bokashi composting after I kind of went
[02:01.900 --> 02:06.900]  through this whole process, I guess, with Elaine's class
[02:09.500 --> 02:14.500]  and kind of her philosophy on anaerobic versus aerobic.
[02:15.660 --> 02:20.660]  I was hesitant to do any fermenting for a long time.
[02:21.180 --> 02:24.940]  And I was actually reading the Jadam book,
[02:24.940 --> 02:29.180]  or I had gotten the Jadam book shortly after I took,
[02:29.180 --> 02:30.820]  started taking Elaine's class.
[02:30.820 --> 02:34.300]  And this kind of, I started reading it
[02:34.300 --> 02:35.340]  and it was talking about fermenting.
[02:35.340 --> 02:37.060]  And I was like, oh, this is rubbish.
[02:37.060 --> 02:40.580]  You know, this is just silliness.
[02:40.580 --> 02:44.180]  Like I, you know, how could this even work?
[02:44.180 --> 02:47.540]  And, you know, just knowing, just taking, you know,
[02:47.540 --> 02:50.740]  what Elaine says on the anaerobic versus aerobic,
[02:51.580 --> 02:52.420]  like, you know, what are these people doing?
[02:52.420 --> 02:56.500]  But then I saw it actually work in real life.
[02:56.500 --> 02:58.740]  And I've, you know, seen so many people,
[02:58.740 --> 03:01.460]  successful farmers using fermentation.
[03:01.460 --> 03:05.660]  And I'm like, wow, you know, there's something
[03:05.660 --> 03:07.980]  to these anaerobic microbes.
[03:07.980 --> 03:12.980]  And so what really kind of made me start digging deeper
[03:13.980 --> 03:16.500]  into it is actually at the compost cup,
[03:16.500 --> 03:19.620]  one of the panelists named Drew told this story
[03:19.660 --> 03:22.900]  about how he had these sick cannabis plants
[03:22.900 --> 03:27.100]  and he put them in his like a swampy area
[03:27.100 --> 03:28.100]  that was anaerobic.
[03:28.100 --> 03:32.940]  And this actually made the plant healthier.
[03:32.940 --> 03:37.940]  And then I was reading in this book here,
[03:39.940 --> 03:43.820]  lovely book, shortly after that experience,
[03:44.660 --> 03:49.420]  that basically it's a common practice for,
[03:49.420 --> 03:52.660]  in agriculture to flood fields out
[03:52.660 --> 03:57.260]  and to get rid of aerobic pathogens.
[03:57.260 --> 04:00.260]  And then I saw aerobic pathogens and I'm like, whoa,
[04:00.260 --> 04:01.940]  like, what is this?
[04:01.940 --> 04:03.060]  You know what I mean?
[04:05.140 --> 04:09.660]  So then I started like digging into it and, you know,
[04:09.660 --> 04:12.460]  Chandler and Jethouse Gardens like really helped me
[04:12.500 --> 04:15.660]  kind of overcome this, you know,
[04:15.660 --> 04:19.500]  stigma towards anaerobic organisms.
[04:19.500 --> 04:23.540]  And I kind of realized how important they are
[04:23.540 --> 04:28.540]  for building soil and for not only like our soil,
[04:30.580 --> 04:32.620]  but, you know, you can also use them
[04:32.620 --> 04:37.620]  to increase decomposition in compost piles.
[04:38.620 --> 04:42.540]  You know, you can use ferments for your body
[04:42.540 --> 04:45.020]  and how helpful that is for you.
[04:45.020 --> 04:48.460]  So basically like these anaerobic organisms
[04:48.460 --> 04:53.460]  are just helping to like pre-compost that material
[04:54.100 --> 04:59.100]  and get it broken down much more quickly
[04:59.660 --> 05:01.580]  than it would if you just let it sit there.
[05:01.580 --> 05:03.700]  So what I do with Bokashi now
[05:03.700 --> 05:06.140]  is I ferment all of my food scraps
[05:06.180 --> 05:09.740]  and then those EM microbes start the process
[05:09.740 --> 05:14.740]  of decomposing and making minerals and nutrients available.
[05:16.140 --> 05:20.740]  And they decompose, then I put those into my other compost.
[05:20.740 --> 05:23.060]  Then I put the Bokashi compost
[05:23.060 --> 05:25.140]  into my other composting systems.
[05:25.140 --> 05:28.740]  So you can put it into a static pile and just like,
[05:28.740 --> 05:32.180]  let it sit and that's gonna turn into like your humus,
[05:32.180 --> 05:35.340]  your usable compost so much faster
[05:35.340 --> 05:39.300]  than if you just kind of put raw food
[05:39.300 --> 05:42.020]  into a static pile outside.
[05:42.020 --> 05:43.500]  You can also use Bokashi.
[05:43.500 --> 05:45.700]  I also use them in hot compost piles
[05:45.700 --> 05:48.460]  and that kind of works as like a high nitrogen source
[05:48.460 --> 05:49.300]  as well.
[05:49.300 --> 05:52.260]  So it actually helps to heat up the pile,
[05:52.260 --> 05:55.980]  all those Bokashi, all the organisms in there.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.740]  So, yeah.
[06:01.240 --> 06:02.900]  Well, we have a lot to talk up.
[06:02.900 --> 06:04.420]  I wanted to let everybody know
[06:04.420 --> 06:05.740]  that Leighton isn't feeling well.
[06:05.740 --> 06:07.580]  I forgot to mention that at the beginning of this,
[06:07.580 --> 06:11.900]  but didn't wanna interrupt that awesome rant.
[06:11.900 --> 06:14.940]  So Leighton, his back is hurting him, unfortunately.
[06:14.940 --> 06:18.540]  And Alexa, this was something that I know
[06:18.540 --> 06:19.660]  all of us were looking forward
[06:19.660 --> 06:21.020]  that you could chop it up with Leighton.
[06:21.020 --> 06:23.060]  So we're gonna have to have you come back on
[06:23.060 --> 06:23.940]  when he's feeling better
[06:23.940 --> 06:26.580]  so that you guys can really dive deep in it.
[06:26.580 --> 06:28.900]  Cause if you're studying Dr. Lane's work now,
[06:28.900 --> 06:31.300]  it'd be interesting to see how Leighton felt.
[06:31.300 --> 06:33.140]  And he was lucky enough to work with her
[06:33.140 --> 06:35.140]  for I think over a year or so.
[06:35.140 --> 06:37.620]  So just a lot of information
[06:37.620 --> 06:40.380]  that will obviously probably be missed on this episode,
[06:40.380 --> 06:43.940]  but there's a lot of other things we can dive deeper into.
[06:43.940 --> 06:46.740]  I've been starting to mess around with the Bokashi.
[06:46.740 --> 06:48.100]  Just sticking on that though,
[06:48.100 --> 06:50.580]  what are some of the questions you,
[06:50.580 --> 06:52.140]  cause before we went live,
[06:52.140 --> 06:53.500]  you were talking about some of the things
[06:53.500 --> 06:54.860]  you wanted to talk to Leighton about.
[06:54.860 --> 06:56.540]  So what are some of those things?
[06:57.980 --> 07:00.380]  Yeah, I just wanna like know his opinion
[07:00.380 --> 07:03.020]  on the anaerobic aerobic philosophy,
[07:04.020 --> 07:07.220]  if he is using like fermentation,
[07:07.220 --> 07:09.900]  I know he's into the aquatic microorganisms
[07:09.900 --> 07:13.060]  and those are typically more so
[07:13.060 --> 07:15.300]  anaerobic metabolic pathways.
[07:15.300 --> 07:18.340]  And I just don't like looking at things
[07:18.340 --> 07:20.100]  so black and white in nature.
[07:20.100 --> 07:25.100]  And I think that recently
[07:25.100 --> 07:27.340]  everything has just been coming to like,
[07:27.340 --> 07:29.820]  everything's in like a balance
[07:29.860 --> 07:33.220]  rather than things being so black and white.
[07:33.220 --> 07:34.580]  I think it's kind of dangerous
[07:34.580 --> 07:39.580]  to discriminate against certain organisms in a way.
[07:41.180 --> 07:42.820]  So, yeah.
[07:42.820 --> 07:45.380]  And then I also just wanted to ask him about
[07:45.380 --> 07:50.380]  the Elaine's method of quantifying organisms in the soil
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.860]  and kind of what he thinks about that
[07:54.860 --> 07:55.820]  because I'm going through
[07:55.820 --> 07:59.340]  the Elaine's consulting program right now.
[07:59.860 --> 08:01.700]  And I just see some like discrepancies
[08:01.700 --> 08:05.780]  and honestly, for the compost cup,
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.540]  we're not gonna actually be doing
[08:07.540 --> 08:10.700]  a cup competition this year.
[08:10.700 --> 08:14.100]  And that's mostly because we are having a hard time
[08:16.100 --> 08:19.900]  kind of determining what is a good compost.
[08:19.900 --> 08:22.420]  So that's just something I really wanted
[08:22.420 --> 08:23.620]  to pick his brain about.
[08:23.620 --> 08:28.260]  And yeah, and I know you can get
[08:28.260 --> 08:31.740]  a really good understanding of what is a good compost
[08:31.740 --> 08:33.580]  by using the microscope because I do.
[08:33.580 --> 08:36.300]  And it's an awesome tool,
[08:36.300 --> 08:39.420]  but I just wanted to ask more in detail
[08:39.420 --> 08:42.820]  about her method of quantifying organisms.
[08:47.690 --> 08:49.050]  I don't know, Brian just did a dab
[08:49.050 --> 08:51.050]  or that's just a cough.
[08:51.050 --> 08:51.890]  Huge dab.
[08:52.810 --> 08:54.370]  Shout out to the new buff coat.
[08:55.410 --> 08:57.170]  Ripping like a new dab should.
[08:58.090 --> 09:01.210]  I wanted to get more into the compost cup
[09:01.210 --> 09:02.730]  because as a co-founder,
[09:04.410 --> 09:06.010]  my buddy Sticky Lungs,
[09:06.010 --> 09:07.370]  I feel like there's been individuals
[09:07.370 --> 09:10.130]  that have really shined when they put cups on
[09:10.130 --> 09:12.010]  because of the integrity of it.
[09:12.010 --> 09:16.530]  I was just out in DC with Marco and they had a cup
[09:16.530 --> 09:19.130]  but the integrity of it felt skewed.
[09:19.130 --> 09:20.650]  It felt like all of a sudden
[09:20.650 --> 09:23.570]  all the big brands were winning those.
[09:23.570 --> 09:25.570]  In fairness, those sometimes do happen,
[09:26.490 --> 09:27.770]  maybe I'm a little bit biased
[09:27.770 --> 09:30.130]  but I've been smoking Marco's cannabis all weekend
[09:30.130 --> 09:32.410]  and for him not to even make the top five
[09:32.410 --> 09:36.010]  just seemed kind of suspect.
[09:36.010 --> 09:37.650]  And I know he would never say anything on that.
[09:37.650 --> 09:39.210]  So that's why I'm bringing it up a little bit.
[09:39.210 --> 09:42.450]  So to have also something with a compost thing
[09:42.450 --> 09:44.490]  in reality here in Denver,
[09:44.490 --> 09:46.250]  I've also seen the same thing with that
[09:46.250 --> 09:48.490]  where it's like, okay, the friend of the friend
[09:48.490 --> 09:50.090]  somehow wins all these cups
[09:50.090 --> 09:53.050]  and now they get to put that on their compost.
[09:53.050 --> 09:55.970]  So kind of break down what made you guys
[09:55.970 --> 09:59.050]  wanna create your own cup and the integrity of it.
[09:59.050 --> 10:01.890]  Cause from, I'm definitely on the outside looking in
[10:01.890 --> 10:04.930]  but everybody is a cheerleader for what you guys are doing.
[10:04.930 --> 10:07.450]  So I'd love to bring some light to that.
[10:07.450 --> 10:09.010]  Yeah, thank you.
[10:09.010 --> 10:12.730]  So that's kind of why we're moving away
[10:12.730 --> 10:17.250]  from the whole cup competition of it anyways
[10:17.250 --> 10:22.250]  and we're kind of just having it be a community
[10:22.410 --> 10:25.850]  building soil building event.
[10:25.850 --> 10:29.770]  We're gonna be doing lots of hands-on workshops this year.
[10:29.770 --> 10:32.490]  Like last year we did like more so like speaking panels.
[10:32.490 --> 10:34.210]  We had a few hands-on demos
[10:34.210 --> 10:38.090]  but we had more like speaking panels planned
[10:38.090 --> 10:41.610]  and people just enjoyed the hands-on so much more
[10:41.610 --> 10:42.690]  for obvious reasons.
[10:42.690 --> 10:46.050]  Like, you learn by doing things
[10:46.050 --> 10:49.050]  and we just really want people to get their hands
[10:49.050 --> 10:52.490]  in the soil and connect with the microorganisms.
[10:52.490 --> 10:57.490]  And there's just something about getting your hands
[10:58.170 --> 11:02.010]  in the soil that really just like changes you.
[11:02.010 --> 11:05.370]  And especially when you can take a little plant medicine
[11:05.370 --> 11:07.130]  with that.
[11:07.130 --> 11:12.130]  So we're also gonna be doing a Hugelkultur bed.
[11:12.530 --> 11:16.090]  We're gonna build like a Hugelkultur bed as like a community.
[11:16.130 --> 11:20.170]  And it's just inspiring to see how quickly things
[11:20.170 --> 11:22.090]  can get done when you work together.
[11:22.090 --> 11:25.330]  So that's kind of what we're focusing on this year.
[11:27.730 --> 11:28.570]  Yeah, I like that.
[11:28.570 --> 11:31.050]  And what made you guys wanna kind of just,
[11:31.050 --> 11:34.050]  you just create the cup, I guess, to create awareness
[11:34.050 --> 11:38.650]  to that there's obviously all composts aren't the same.
[11:38.650 --> 11:42.010]  Like from a waste management company here in Colorado,
[11:42.010 --> 11:43.450]  they sell compost.
[11:43.490 --> 11:45.410]  I purchased that just to see what it was like
[11:45.410 --> 11:47.210]  a few years ago.
[11:47.210 --> 11:50.250]  Smell had like a funky smell to it.
[11:50.250 --> 11:53.690]  So I want people to realize that in a way the best compost,
[11:53.690 --> 11:55.090]  especially if you're newer to this,
[11:55.090 --> 11:56.090]  still at the end of the day,
[11:56.090 --> 11:57.610]  cause you're trying to improve,
[11:57.610 --> 12:00.370]  is the compost that you're gonna make yourself.
[12:01.530 --> 12:03.390]  So I wanted to kind of pick your brain
[12:03.390 --> 12:05.510]  on what you guys have noticed through that,
[12:05.510 --> 12:06.890]  seeing different samples.
[12:06.890 --> 12:09.170]  Are there current things like,
[12:09.170 --> 12:11.090]  Marco and I love to talk about leaf litter.
[12:11.090 --> 12:12.490]  We think that is just paramount
[12:12.490 --> 12:14.450]  to almost any soil build system.
[12:14.450 --> 12:15.850]  Are there other things that you've found
[12:15.850 --> 12:17.410]  that are tried and true?
[12:17.410 --> 12:18.730]  Doesn't matter your skillset,
[12:18.730 --> 12:22.170]  but adding that amendment or adding something
[12:22.170 --> 12:25.370]  is going to noticeably build that compost
[12:25.370 --> 12:26.650]  either on a quicker manner
[12:26.650 --> 12:29.010]  or maybe with diversity aspects to it.
[12:31.690 --> 12:33.230]  Wow, yeah, a lot of things there.
[12:33.230 --> 12:35.970]  So first, like, yeah,
[12:35.970 --> 12:38.730]  definitely with the commercial compost,
[12:39.570 --> 12:42.810]  it's still organic, good organic matter.
[12:42.810 --> 12:47.810]  Like I'm, I still like buy commercial compost,
[12:48.010 --> 12:49.610]  even though it's not as good as quality.
[12:49.610 --> 12:50.930]  And when we're talking about quality,
[12:50.930 --> 12:54.010]  I'm always looking at like the diversity of organisms
[12:54.010 --> 12:54.830]  that are in there.
[12:54.830 --> 12:58.430]  So like the quality of compost is completely determined,
[12:58.430 --> 12:59.610]  but for me anyways,
[12:59.610 --> 13:04.610]  by the diversity of microorganisms in there.
[13:05.090 --> 13:07.610]  And, you know, when you look at a,
[13:07.610 --> 13:10.450]  cause I just bought some commercial compost
[13:10.450 --> 13:12.210]  for our garden outside, just, you know,
[13:12.210 --> 13:16.570]  cause it's cheap and it's good organic matter either way.
[13:16.570 --> 13:18.430]  And it was pasteurized.
[13:19.510 --> 13:23.530]  So, you know, all you need to do really
[13:23.530 --> 13:27.770]  is inoculate that with a compost extract,
[13:27.770 --> 13:30.690]  a high quality compost extract or tea.
[13:30.690 --> 13:33.690]  And then, you know, boom, the organisms take off in there
[13:33.690 --> 13:36.570]  and you got yourself some good compost.
[13:36.610 --> 13:38.450]  And that's kind of the same thing that I do
[13:38.450 --> 13:40.290]  with thermophilic composting,
[13:40.290 --> 13:43.650]  because it is kind of a pasteurization process
[13:43.650 --> 13:45.410]  in those hot temperatures.
[13:45.410 --> 13:48.370]  You're killing off so much biodiversity.
[13:48.370 --> 13:51.970]  And so what I do with my thermophilic piles
[13:51.970 --> 13:54.690]  is after they go through the thermophilic phase,
[13:54.690 --> 13:58.350]  which usually takes about 10 days to two weeks,
[14:00.130 --> 14:01.950]  after they start cooling down
[14:01.950 --> 14:03.890]  and getting into the mesophilic phase,
[14:03.890 --> 14:06.090]  then I'll re-inoculate them
[14:06.090 --> 14:08.870]  with a high quality compost extract
[14:08.870 --> 14:11.790]  from like a mother culture or something like that.
[14:11.790 --> 14:13.930]  And also add worms.
[14:15.210 --> 14:17.710]  Worms are paramount to that process as well.
[14:17.710 --> 14:21.570]  They really decompose everything
[14:21.570 --> 14:25.910]  that was not fully decomposed in the thermophilic process.
[14:25.910 --> 14:28.770]  So they go through there and shred all that up.
[14:28.770 --> 14:33.570]  And yeah, that's huge for adding the most
[14:34.570 --> 14:35.890]  microorganisms in there as well,
[14:35.890 --> 14:40.890]  because their digestive tracts are just amazing
[14:41.050 --> 14:46.050]  at adding diversity to whatever soil they're in.
[14:49.210 --> 14:53.730]  So yeah, worms are huge
[14:53.730 --> 14:58.490]  for carrying out the thermophilic compost.
[15:00.530 --> 15:01.890]  And like you had mentioned,
[15:01.890 --> 15:03.770]  I want newer audience to realize
[15:04.610 --> 15:05.450]  that they're the ones in my opinion
[15:05.450 --> 15:07.330]  that are rebuilding all of that.
[15:07.330 --> 15:09.530]  With the biofilm that's on them themselves,
[15:09.530 --> 15:12.170]  they're building all that dissolved oxygen channels.
[15:12.170 --> 15:17.170]  I've noticed when springtail populations are healthy enough
[15:17.170 --> 15:20.850]  that they just seem to hitch a ride on the composting worms.
[15:20.850 --> 15:24.790]  So then things are just improving and spreading around.
[15:24.790 --> 15:28.090]  And again, that allows you as the farmer to be the manager
[15:28.090 --> 15:30.530]  instead of the plant being so dependent on you.
[15:30.530 --> 15:33.370]  There's an actual subway system
[15:33.370 --> 15:35.210]  or whatever analogy you wanna use
[15:35.210 --> 15:37.290]  that's continuing to be built.
[15:37.290 --> 15:38.290]  And once that's built,
[15:38.290 --> 15:39.810]  and then we're taking it to the next level
[15:39.810 --> 15:41.330]  with the mycorrhizal fungi,
[15:41.330 --> 15:43.770]  that's where that network is also being built.
[15:43.770 --> 15:46.570]  And that's where I like to use the alive and thriving.
[15:46.570 --> 15:50.290]  I mean, these are starting to become little soil utopias.
[15:51.410 --> 15:53.130]  Yeah, absolutely.
[15:53.130 --> 15:56.390]  So that's kind of my thing with the thermophilic compost.
[15:56.390 --> 15:59.930]  I know you will get better diversity
[16:00.290 --> 16:02.010]  if you're not cooking your compost,
[16:02.010 --> 16:04.130]  if you're just doing a cold compost pile
[16:04.130 --> 16:05.470]  and just letting it sit there.
[16:05.470 --> 16:09.410]  And if you have time for that, that's fucking awesome.
[16:09.410 --> 16:10.810]  And you should definitely do that.
[16:10.810 --> 16:15.070]  But if you need to get compost faster,
[16:15.070 --> 16:18.630]  the thermophilic is what I do.
[16:18.630 --> 16:20.930]  That's the process that we use at HIFA.
[16:22.330 --> 16:25.730]  And then just allowing that to cure out
[16:25.730 --> 16:29.610]  and gain back the organisms that were lost.
[16:30.930 --> 16:35.930]  It creates a really nice compost after the curing.
[16:39.010 --> 16:44.010]  Yeah, and when I'm newer to this kind of stuff,
[16:44.290 --> 16:47.090]  is that, do you guys hear the background?
[16:47.090 --> 16:47.930]  Yes.
[16:50.650 --> 16:52.810]  I don't know why that's happening.
[16:52.810 --> 16:53.930]  I don't hear anything.
[16:55.810 --> 16:57.930]  Brian, it's all in your head from that dab.
[16:58.370 --> 17:00.490]  It's all in your head from that dab.
[17:00.490 --> 17:04.490]  In other words, Peter's standing in the background.
[17:04.490 --> 17:07.530]  Now, all right, so let me mute.
[17:07.530 --> 17:08.850]  All right, I'm talking.
[17:08.850 --> 17:10.410]  I'm talking.
[17:10.410 --> 17:11.530]  All right, let me.
[17:11.530 --> 17:13.490]  All right, let me.
[17:13.490 --> 17:14.770]  Now I'm talking again.
[17:14.770 --> 17:16.250]  I think it's from Alexa.
[17:16.250 --> 17:19.150]  So do you have any ear, like,
[17:20.890 --> 17:22.190]  do you have any of these?
[17:24.690 --> 17:25.770]  Okay, hold on.
[17:26.770 --> 17:31.770]  That's weird that that just started happening.
[17:37.930 --> 17:41.010]  Fucking IT issues, man.
[17:41.010 --> 17:46.010]  So Alexa, you're on a computer, right?
[17:48.170 --> 17:50.330]  Here, let me just mute you while I say this.
[17:50.330 --> 17:54.170]  Try to just refresh the browser window and come back in.
[17:57.340 --> 18:00.620]  Oh my God, there's Ken in all his glory.
[18:00.620 --> 18:03.820]  So no, what's weird is it wasn't happening,
[18:03.820 --> 18:06.860]  and then out of nowhere it started happening.
[18:06.860 --> 18:08.980]  Well, I appreciate it while we're killing time here.
[18:08.980 --> 18:10.300]  I appreciate you coming on yesterday
[18:10.300 --> 18:13.940]  because it's frustrating to get this to work.
[18:13.940 --> 18:17.380]  I do not hear myself in my own head.
[18:17.380 --> 18:18.380]  Are we good?
[18:18.380 --> 18:20.020]  Yeah, I think we're good.
[18:20.020 --> 18:21.420]  Sounds good now.
[18:21.420 --> 18:24.180]  Amazing, this is my advice to my parents
[18:24.180 --> 18:26.540]  with every technical problem they throw my way,
[18:26.700 --> 18:29.620]  I say either quit the app and come back in,
[18:29.620 --> 18:31.420]  restart the computer.
[18:32.380 --> 18:33.220]  It usually does the trick.
[18:33.220 --> 18:34.620]  It's the only thing that do one.
[18:34.620 --> 18:39.620]  Cool, well, I'm glad that's fixed now.
[18:41.900 --> 18:43.380]  Do you guys remember what question I asked?
[18:43.380 --> 18:44.220]  Because I don't think they do.
[18:44.220 --> 18:45.100]  I do not.
[18:45.100 --> 18:46.300]  All right, so I'm gonna move on.
[18:46.300 --> 18:47.660]  Do you remember, Alexa?
[18:47.660 --> 18:49.780]  Yeah, so we were talking about things
[18:49.780 --> 18:53.100]  that you can do to improve the compost pile.
[18:53.100 --> 18:54.980]  So that would be one of the things,
[18:55.300 --> 18:56.980]  if you're doing the thermophilics,
[18:57.820 --> 19:02.460]  you can also, I've been getting into adding JLF
[19:02.460 --> 19:07.100]  and different fermented lab and things like that.
[19:07.100 --> 19:12.060]  And those are also going to improve the decomposition
[19:12.060 --> 19:13.580]  of your compost piles.
[19:13.580 --> 19:18.580]  So if you spray some JLF or something like that
[19:18.780 --> 19:22.060]  on your static pile at home,
[19:22.060 --> 19:25.140]  that's gonna help things break down a lot more quickly.
[19:25.140 --> 19:29.420]  So you're getting into that humus compost
[19:29.420 --> 19:32.900]  that you can use on your garden a lot quicker.
[19:35.740 --> 19:38.100]  So those are kind of the things that I like to do.
[19:38.100 --> 19:40.700]  And again, with the Bokashi composting,
[19:40.700 --> 19:42.820]  I'm literally obsessed with it right now
[19:42.820 --> 19:44.020]  with my food scraps.
[19:44.020 --> 19:48.380]  It's just so cool how quickly they can turn into soil
[19:48.380 --> 19:52.740]  and how much that actually improves the soil too.
[19:52.740 --> 19:56.740]  So I've actually been dumping that Bokashi compost
[19:56.740 --> 20:01.580]  on this garden that I'm making this summer.
[20:01.580 --> 20:04.340]  It's basically, we're starting with a dirt field
[20:04.340 --> 20:08.340]  that's been farmed conventionally in the past.
[20:08.340 --> 20:13.020]  So there's no organic matter, any life in there at all,
[20:13.020 --> 20:14.580]  just a bunch of bacteria.
[20:14.580 --> 20:17.020]  So that's kind of one of the ways
[20:17.020 --> 20:19.740]  that we're starting to build that soil
[20:19.740 --> 20:23.100]  is adding that organic matter back
[20:23.100 --> 20:26.240]  with the Bokashi compost scraps.
[20:29.700 --> 20:34.140]  Just quickly, I forgot if we answered this question.
[20:34.140 --> 20:38.180]  Are you making your own Bokashi or are you buying Bokashi?
[20:38.180 --> 20:42.700]  And if you're making it, it gets back to my question
[20:43.220 --> 20:47.140]  are you reaching for that bottle of Terragenics EM1
[20:47.140 --> 20:50.580]  or are you doing something that you don't have to buy
[20:50.580 --> 20:53.220]  a bottle of something to make your Bokashi?
[20:53.220 --> 20:58.220]  Yeah, so as far as I know, you do need the EM organisms
[20:58.980 --> 21:02.460]  for a successful Bokashi ferment.
[21:02.460 --> 21:07.460]  I want to experiment doing it with just lab.
[21:08.460 --> 21:12.460]  So if anyone wants to try that and let me know,
[21:12.460 --> 21:14.460]  I want to try it as well.
[21:14.460 --> 21:19.460]  But I kind of think that you need the EM organisms.
[21:19.460 --> 21:24.460]  I don't know too much about the EM organisms.
[21:25.060 --> 21:30.060]  I know that they all kind of eat each other
[21:30.220 --> 21:33.380]  in their own little ecosystem.
[21:33.380 --> 21:38.380]  And that's really cool because it decomposes things
[21:38.660 --> 21:41.420]  really quickly and makes minerals available.
[21:41.420 --> 21:45.100]  And that is ultimately what's build soil
[21:45.100 --> 21:49.940]  and will be the food resource for when you add
[21:50.780 --> 21:55.780]  your higher successional organisms in, if that makes sense.
[21:57.060 --> 22:01.220]  And there is a way if you have the mother in the EM1
[22:01.260 --> 22:04.020]  that you have, you can feed that mother
[22:04.020 --> 22:05.800]  and you can make your own.
[22:05.800 --> 22:08.980]  So you only actually have to buy the bottle once
[22:08.980 --> 22:10.820]  as long as you're getting the mother.
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.140]  Okay, yeah.
[22:15.420 --> 22:16.340]  But I've never bought it.
[22:16.340 --> 22:21.180]  I have a really awesome local company Bokashi brand
[22:21.180 --> 22:24.640]  that makes it so I like to buy it from them.
[22:26.700 --> 22:28.980]  I've been getting some samples from Johnny,
[22:28.980 --> 22:31.540]  mindfully rooted using that Bokashi
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.420]  to build my reptile tanks.
[22:33.420 --> 22:37.060]  And after they defecate, I'm able to throw that on there.
[22:37.060 --> 22:40.020]  And I would say within probably 30 minutes,
[22:40.020 --> 22:43.660]  if it's really bad, the smell is gone.
[22:43.660 --> 22:45.460]  And now that I'm using a cover crop
[22:45.460 --> 22:47.060]  and things are starting to take hold,
[22:47.060 --> 22:49.060]  if he does that now a little bit of sprinkle,
[22:49.060 --> 22:50.860]  maybe now it's only taking 10 minutes.
[22:50.860 --> 22:53.060]  So it's starting to really notice
[22:53.060 --> 22:55.880]  that microbial life is kicking in.
[22:55.880 --> 22:59.080]  And I don't know if this is accurate,
[22:59.080 --> 23:00.920]  but it feels like they are starting to recognize,
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.960]  oh, here's more defecation.
[23:02.960 --> 23:06.400]  And however they've realized that the springtails
[23:06.400 --> 23:09.080]  start to take hold, the isopods come in afterwards.
[23:09.080 --> 23:12.720]  And then drizzling the Bokashi, adding some cover crop,
[23:12.720 --> 23:16.440]  it seems like just a healthier alternative to some things.
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.800]  So Bokashi, I feel is another things just like compost
[23:20.800 --> 23:25.040]  that we don't really know yet how many uses we can have
[23:25.120 --> 23:27.520]  for this to improve our lives.
[23:27.520 --> 23:29.480]  Totally, yeah.
[23:29.480 --> 23:34.480]  And yeah, using that yam stuff to clean,
[23:35.920 --> 23:39.960]  and I've been getting into like using lab to clean as well,
[23:39.960 --> 23:44.960]  because we just sterilizing this paradigm of sterility
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.560]  that we're in right now that somehow we think
[23:50.560 --> 23:52.940]  that sterile is better.
[23:52.940 --> 23:55.060]  It's actually extremely dangerous.
[23:55.060 --> 23:58.460]  And we're really just human cells
[23:58.460 --> 24:01.180]  living in this microbial matrix.
[24:01.180 --> 24:03.700]  And it's not really in our best interest
[24:03.700 --> 24:06.260]  to escape that at all.
[24:07.580 --> 24:12.220]  We really are a symbiotic fusion of many organisms.
[24:13.340 --> 24:18.340]  So using those microbes in our bodies as well,
[24:19.180 --> 24:24.180]  I've been really getting into fermenting like sauerkraut,
[24:25.540 --> 24:30.540]  making sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, and kombucha.
[24:31.940 --> 24:36.940]  And that has been a huge realization for me as well,
[24:39.300 --> 24:43.740]  because it's basically like you're eating
[24:43.740 --> 24:45.500]  your compost inoculant.
[24:45.500 --> 24:47.940]  So you're gonna eat your sauerkraut with your food
[24:48.580 --> 24:50.340]  and that's gonna help break your food down
[24:50.340 --> 24:51.700]  and help you digest it.
[24:51.700 --> 24:53.500]  Because really in reality,
[24:53.500 --> 24:57.260]  like humans aren't doing any digesting like at all.
[24:57.260 --> 24:59.380]  It's really all the microorganisms.
[24:59.380 --> 25:04.300]  And I've been listening to Zach Bush a lot lately.
[25:04.300 --> 25:07.180]  And he says that humans are supposed
[25:07.180 --> 25:09.380]  to have abundant protozoa in our stool.
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.420]  So that's like leads me to be like,
[25:12.420 --> 25:17.420]  okay, wow, we have a soil food web in our gut as well.
[25:17.860 --> 25:19.460]  Like it's not just in the soil,
[25:19.460 --> 25:21.300]  like of course it's in the gut.
[25:21.300 --> 25:23.500]  Like that's what nature does, she repeats herself.
[25:23.500 --> 25:28.500]  So yeah, it's like these bacteria are just like in the soil
[25:29.340 --> 25:31.660]  breaking down the organic matter
[25:31.660 --> 25:33.180]  that we're putting into our bodies.
[25:33.180 --> 25:36.340]  And that's what really makes these vitamins
[25:36.340 --> 25:39.660]  and minerals available for our cells
[25:39.660 --> 25:42.040]  to then assimilate and use.
[25:44.420 --> 25:46.420]  And without those microorganisms,
[25:46.420 --> 25:48.540]  like we can't do that.
[25:48.540 --> 25:51.900]  So, and then there's the other layer to it as well.
[25:51.900 --> 25:53.780]  We're supposed to have these protozoa
[25:53.780 --> 25:57.020]  that are then eating the bacteria
[25:57.020 --> 26:01.260]  and then releasing the nutrients.
[26:02.740 --> 26:03.580]  More nutrients.
[26:03.580 --> 26:07.980]  I feel like the soil food web is in everything
[26:07.980 --> 26:10.580]  and every form of life on this planet.
[26:10.580 --> 26:12.300]  It's all about the biology.
[26:12.300 --> 26:14.620]  That's why I always say that.
[26:14.660 --> 26:18.700]  If we have it in us, we break down the nutrients.
[26:18.700 --> 26:21.540]  If it's in our soil, we give it to the plants
[26:21.540 --> 26:23.700]  and it comes into us that way.
[26:23.700 --> 26:26.020]  But with the ferments, I love what you're doing.
[26:26.020 --> 26:27.740]  You're talking my language.
[26:27.740 --> 26:29.540]  I'm sitting here nodding and nodding
[26:29.540 --> 26:33.540]  because you're talking exactly what I say as well.
[26:33.540 --> 26:34.920]  I love it, keep going.
[26:35.940 --> 26:37.340]  Yeah.
[26:37.340 --> 26:39.540]  Well, and a farmer can notice this,
[26:39.540 --> 26:42.060]  even if they, we kind of talked about this several times.
[26:42.060 --> 26:43.540]  If they just drizzle a little kefir
[26:43.540 --> 26:45.380]  around their living soil grow
[26:45.380 --> 26:48.100]  and they see how that expands,
[26:48.100 --> 26:49.940]  then I've always challenged people,
[26:49.940 --> 26:52.660]  give that 90 days where you're starting to take that
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.860]  and then taking it to the next level like you are,
[26:54.860 --> 26:57.260]  like making your own fermented foods.
[26:57.260 --> 26:58.780]  It's going to be a food source
[26:58.780 --> 27:00.940]  for the good bacteria in your gut.
[27:00.940 --> 27:03.300]  Because when you are eating Doritos and candy
[27:03.300 --> 27:04.980]  and all that stuff, it's more of those yeast
[27:04.980 --> 27:06.460]  that you're building up.
[27:06.460 --> 27:09.300]  That's why some people even call that the second brain
[27:09.300 --> 27:11.980]  because your body is craving that stuff
[27:11.980 --> 27:15.140]  and makes you, especially at night, crave sweets
[27:15.140 --> 27:16.780]  because you got to feed that beast.
[27:16.780 --> 27:19.260]  And fermented foods is what kills
[27:19.260 --> 27:20.460]  and breaks that down for you.
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.860]  So anything in life needs balance.
[27:23.860 --> 27:27.860]  And that's, we're finding out that through farming,
[27:27.860 --> 27:31.060]  that I feel like a lot of us farmers
[27:31.060 --> 27:32.420]  weren't taking care of ourselves.
[27:32.420 --> 27:34.700]  It was plants first the entire time.
[27:34.700 --> 27:36.260]  And now that we're starting to notice
[27:36.260 --> 27:40.260]  that the gut replicates that soil system, focused on that.
[27:40.260 --> 27:41.940]  I see a lot more living soil farmers
[27:42.780 --> 27:44.580]  in private and confidence.
[27:44.580 --> 27:47.060]  Oh man, I appreciate what you said about gut health.
[27:47.060 --> 27:49.340]  I've tried, I'm drinking kombuchas now.
[27:49.340 --> 27:51.500]  Or even some people just start off simple
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.140]  by having like pickles and stuff.
[27:53.140 --> 27:54.300]  Maybe they don't like sauerkraut,
[27:54.300 --> 27:57.740]  but there's gotta be something that you can build up
[27:57.740 --> 28:01.860]  that ecosystem within that gut relatively easy.
[28:03.940 --> 28:07.820]  Yeah, and I was watching the Humor Man Lab
[28:07.820 --> 28:11.220]  and they were talking about a study done out of Stanford.
[28:11.260 --> 28:14.220]  And they found that for eating fermented foods
[28:14.220 --> 28:17.860]  is the best way to improve on biodiversity
[28:17.860 --> 28:19.700]  in your microbiome.
[28:19.700 --> 28:22.260]  So that's kind of what inspired me
[28:22.260 --> 28:26.460]  to be looking at that a lot more.
[28:26.460 --> 28:31.460]  And that's why I really like Layton's idea
[28:32.340 --> 28:35.340]  of medical grade compost,
[28:35.340 --> 28:39.060]  because like, man, I've been thinking about that for a while
[28:39.060 --> 28:44.060]  like I've drank compost extract before, only one time,
[28:45.140 --> 28:47.300]  but man, I would love to do it again.
[28:47.300 --> 28:50.780]  I'm nervous to do it, but I think there's something there.
[28:50.780 --> 28:51.740]  I really do.
[28:51.740 --> 28:55.620]  There is, there definitely is.
[28:55.620 --> 28:57.540]  And have you made the correlation
[28:57.540 --> 29:02.500]  that your ferments are an anaerobic process
[29:02.500 --> 29:05.940]  and you need that anaerobic biology?
[29:05.940 --> 29:07.980]  That's where Layton talks about,
[29:07.980 --> 29:10.820]  sometimes you have to go back in the biology
[29:10.820 --> 29:13.580]  to bring your biology forward.
[29:13.580 --> 29:15.260]  You're doing that in your compost
[29:15.260 --> 29:19.700]  when you're inoculating it with whatever you have,
[29:19.700 --> 29:22.660]  old compost, new compost, leaf mold.
[29:22.660 --> 29:25.180]  Anytime you add biology,
[29:25.180 --> 29:28.980]  it, that biodiversity, the more, the more, the more,
[29:28.980 --> 29:31.300]  and pretty soon you have it all.
[29:31.300 --> 29:33.660]  And that's when health is actually there.
[29:33.980 --> 29:36.740]  Mm-hmm, definitely.
[29:36.740 --> 29:39.100]  It seems like there's, you know,
[29:39.100 --> 29:42.300]  we think about the succession of,
[29:44.020 --> 29:46.380]  like ecological succession of like plants,
[29:46.380 --> 29:51.380]  but you know, that also goes for the microbiome as well.
[29:51.980 --> 29:55.380]  So we got to think about those organisms that are there
[29:55.380 --> 29:58.140]  after an extreme disturbance,
[29:58.140 --> 30:00.740]  like we have been disturbing the soil like crazy.
[30:00.780 --> 30:03.100]  So we have all these, you know,
[30:03.980 --> 30:08.980]  all this land that's in lower successional state.
[30:11.100 --> 30:13.620]  And, you know,
[30:15.620 --> 30:20.220]  those microbes definitely have a purpose as well.
[30:20.220 --> 30:22.420]  And it's all coming,
[30:22.420 --> 30:27.420]  it all comes back down to the state of the environment.
[30:27.900 --> 30:32.830]  Getting back to, since you're a student of Dr. Lane,
[30:32.830 --> 30:35.630]  you know, there's a lot of buzzwords going about.
[30:35.630 --> 30:37.870]  Right now, I kind of wanted to hear
[30:37.870 --> 30:39.790]  how you would define what, you know,
[30:39.790 --> 30:41.830]  what is a biocomplete compost?
[30:41.830 --> 30:44.350]  Like what is that to you and how do you define that?
[30:46.390 --> 30:51.390]  Yeah, so again, when I'm just looking at a compost,
[30:53.630 --> 30:57.350]  I just make sure there's a diversity
[30:58.030 --> 30:59.510]  of microorganisms in there.
[30:59.510 --> 31:03.510]  So as long as I'm seeing the full soil food web,
[31:04.870 --> 31:08.350]  then, you know, I know I'm looking at a good compost.
[31:08.350 --> 31:10.510]  And I mean, at this point,
[31:10.510 --> 31:15.030]  like I can kind of look at a soil sample
[31:15.030 --> 31:18.830]  and I know if it's, I'm looking at like a compost
[31:18.830 --> 31:21.470]  or like what stage in the composting process
[31:21.470 --> 31:24.150]  is this like a fresh thermophilic pile
[31:24.310 --> 31:27.310]  or is this like a, you know, matured, ready to use pile?
[31:27.310 --> 31:29.150]  You know, is this from a compost?
[31:29.150 --> 31:31.630]  Is this a forest soil?
[31:31.630 --> 31:36.630]  So you kind of just get a feel for how certain things look.
[31:37.230 --> 31:40.030]  And from there, you know,
[31:40.030 --> 31:42.270]  you get your own personal definition
[31:42.270 --> 31:47.270]  of like what is a good quality based off,
[31:47.270 --> 31:49.830]  you know, just experience.
[31:49.830 --> 31:51.750]  And when it comes to a good quality,
[31:51.790 --> 31:52.990]  have you ever looked under a microscope
[31:52.990 --> 31:54.350]  of like a high-end compost
[31:54.350 --> 31:56.190]  compared to a high-end vermicompost?
[31:56.190 --> 31:58.230]  And do you see different things
[31:58.230 --> 32:00.550]  because of the composting worms
[32:00.550 --> 32:02.710]  from a scientific side of things?
[32:02.710 --> 32:05.070]  Mm-hmm, yeah.
[32:05.070 --> 32:10.070]  I've seen, so when before you, like for example,
[32:11.430 --> 32:13.590]  like with our thermophilic piles,
[32:13.590 --> 32:16.550]  like before we add the composting worms,
[32:16.550 --> 32:18.190]  when you just look at that,
[32:18.230 --> 32:19.070]  let's say, you know,
[32:19.070 --> 32:21.270]  you've added a high quality extract to it,
[32:21.270 --> 32:22.110]  it's starting to cure,
[32:22.110 --> 32:25.270]  but you haven't added your worms yet.
[32:25.270 --> 32:28.110]  That's gonna be completely different biology
[32:28.110 --> 32:29.950]  than after you add the worms.
[32:29.950 --> 32:32.710]  And after you add the worms, it's so much better,
[32:32.710 --> 32:34.390]  let me tell you.
[32:34.390 --> 32:37.350]  They just bring this whole another layer of diversity
[32:37.350 --> 32:39.350]  that's just like, wow, you know?
[32:40.430 --> 32:43.870]  So what would you be your response if someone was saying,
[32:43.870 --> 32:44.950]  well, I have a lot of worms,
[32:44.950 --> 32:46.110]  I'm gonna add a lot of worms,
[32:46.110 --> 32:48.030]  be your response if someone was saying,
[32:48.030 --> 32:49.590]  well, I'm using worm castings,
[32:49.590 --> 32:51.430]  so I just don't want a bunch of worms
[32:51.430 --> 32:53.630]  because I feel like some people think for whatever reason
[32:53.630 --> 32:56.150]  that they are crawling around in your basement
[32:56.150 --> 32:57.830]  or in your tent.
[32:57.830 --> 33:00.470]  But you know, the reality is that they're in there
[33:00.470 --> 33:02.270]  unless you're using the Canadian ones
[33:02.270 --> 33:05.630]  because they come up for whatever reason.
[33:05.630 --> 33:09.470]  So what are your thoughts on that aspect?
[33:10.310 --> 33:11.950]  Using worms?
[33:11.950 --> 33:14.510]  Well, yeah, using compost worms,
[33:15.110 --> 33:16.670]  if I was newer to this,
[33:16.670 --> 33:21.670]  and I can make a lot of mistakes making compost,
[33:21.750 --> 33:24.830]  but from my personal experience,
[33:24.830 --> 33:27.270]  it never really messed up a vermicompost bin
[33:27.270 --> 33:30.070]  other than if I was trying to make it in a tub
[33:30.070 --> 33:32.430]  back in the day, like a plastic tub.
[33:32.430 --> 33:33.910]  But as long as there's enough,
[33:33.910 --> 33:35.710]  now I like to do it with fabric pots and stuff.
[33:35.710 --> 33:38.230]  So as long as there's enough dissolved oxygen,
[33:38.230 --> 33:40.710]  things are healthy, it's pretty hard to mess that up
[33:40.710 --> 33:43.630]  other than maybe not feeding them enough
[33:43.670 --> 33:45.710]  to really build up those populations.
[33:48.110 --> 33:52.150]  Yeah, it's kind of hard to mess up a compost.
[33:52.150 --> 33:55.350]  Like really all you have to do is put organic matter
[33:55.350 --> 34:00.350]  in a pile and everything else is just kind of technical,
[34:00.430 --> 34:03.070]  but you will get good compost
[34:03.070 --> 34:07.670]  if you just decide to pile organic matter out in your yard.
[34:08.390 --> 34:13.390]  You can pay attention to the C to N ratio
[34:13.910 --> 34:14.830]  and mixing your browns,
[34:14.830 --> 34:17.150]  like obviously that's gonna increase the quality
[34:17.150 --> 34:19.590]  and all these other things that we're doing
[34:19.590 --> 34:23.550]  are just really to increase the quality of the compost.
[34:23.550 --> 34:28.550]  So adding worms is awesome.
[34:29.230 --> 34:32.350]  If you just put the compost in contact with the soil,
[34:32.350 --> 34:35.470]  the worms are gonna naturally just come in there
[34:35.470 --> 34:39.950]  along with all the other amazing composters,
[34:39.950 --> 34:44.950]  like the isopods and centipedes and rove beetles and mites.
[34:45.190 --> 34:50.190]  So yeah, I've honestly messed up
[34:51.510 --> 34:54.110]  a few, more than a few worm bins.
[34:54.110 --> 34:57.850]  And what I'm actually finding in my worm bins right now
[34:57.850 --> 35:02.850]  is like adding, especially isopods like pill bugs
[35:02.850 --> 35:06.610]  is extremely beneficial to get the material
[35:06.610 --> 35:07.690]  to break down quicker.
[35:07.690 --> 35:09.450]  Because if you just have worms in there,
[35:09.450 --> 35:11.410]  it's gonna take a really long time
[35:11.410 --> 35:14.170]  and you can't really process food as quickly.
[35:14.170 --> 35:16.210]  So that's what I always recommend for people
[35:16.210 --> 35:18.610]  who just have like an at-home worm bin
[35:18.610 --> 35:21.730]  is to add like diversity to it.
[35:21.730 --> 35:23.650]  So add like the shredders,
[35:23.650 --> 35:27.030]  especially the isopods and pill bugs.
[35:29.200 --> 35:31.200]  Hell yeah, appreciate that.
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.120]  You're talking Brian's language now.
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.120]  Yeah, but it's nice to just keep improving on things.
[35:39.720 --> 35:42.000]  You know, at the beginning of this, our peer group,
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.720]  we were just ecstatic when we would get ladybugs.
[35:44.720 --> 35:47.160]  You know, we thought we were like changing the world
[35:47.160 --> 35:49.060]  because we were using ladybugs.
[35:49.060 --> 35:50.560]  And now as things have progressed,
[35:50.560 --> 35:52.720]  obviously now it's, you know, green lace wings,
[35:52.720 --> 35:54.480]  you know, those are obviously more effective.
[35:54.480 --> 35:56.000]  And there's a variety of reasons
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.720]  why we don't use ladybugs anymore.
[35:57.760 --> 36:00.000]  From your experience from the compost stuff,
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.380]  I know you're working with Jethouse.
[36:01.380 --> 36:03.480]  I personally even spent my own hard earned money
[36:03.480 --> 36:07.520]  on his compost for that reason, just to get the diversity.
[36:07.520 --> 36:10.040]  Are there other things that I do notice in his stuff?
[36:10.040 --> 36:11.320]  He has rove beetles in there.
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.920]  Are there any other kind of beneficials
[36:14.920 --> 36:17.360]  that maybe the community hasn't heard of?
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.720]  Example, Marco was talking about the pseudo scorpion
[36:19.720 --> 36:20.560]  the other day.
[36:20.560 --> 36:23.520]  Any little things like that that you guys have noticed?
[36:23.520 --> 36:26.840]  Yeah, they have the pseudo scorpions in there as well,
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.880]  but gosh, anything unique, man, Chandler's gonna probably.
[36:32.000 --> 36:32.840]  Oh gosh.
[36:34.960 --> 36:37.400]  Well it is live and you're on the spot obviously.
[36:37.400 --> 36:39.360]  It's not like I have all these questions.
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.080]  But as far as like microbiology,
[36:43.080 --> 36:44.880]  macrobiology I'm not sure.
[36:44.880 --> 36:47.040]  I mean, they do a lot of stuff with mushrooms,
[36:47.040 --> 36:49.920]  mushroom blocks, which is absolutely just fascinating.
[36:49.920 --> 36:53.840]  Like they have a fungal dominant Burma compost.
[36:53.840 --> 36:55.160]  Like what?
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.320]  It's crazy the amount of fungi that I see in there.
[36:59.320 --> 37:02.360]  Like, you just don't expect that.
[37:02.360 --> 37:06.360]  And I really don't typically see like huge,
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.800]  like long, long intact threads of hyphae,
[37:11.800 --> 37:13.920]  like big wefts in samples.
[37:13.920 --> 37:16.640]  Like usually they're very broken up and very small.
[37:16.640 --> 37:18.960]  And always in Wormy's compost,
[37:18.960 --> 37:21.640]  there's just like these huge wefts of hyphae.
[37:21.640 --> 37:24.400]  And I'm like, am I looking at a forest soil right now?
[37:24.400 --> 37:25.240]  Like what?
[37:25.240 --> 37:26.120]  You know?
[37:26.120 --> 37:29.120]  So from a microbiology perspective,
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.360]  like there is so much fungi in there
[37:31.360 --> 37:36.360]  and they are just at the, you know,
[37:37.040 --> 37:40.760]  forefront of making high quality compost.
[37:40.760 --> 37:43.720]  I mean, the whole process of, you know,
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.520]  getting things pre-composted and then adding the worms
[37:47.520 --> 37:50.920]  and, you know, having the free range worms,
[37:51.960 --> 37:53.760]  as you guys say too.
[37:54.640 --> 37:57.280]  Connected with the soil, just again,
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.800]  brings a whole nother level of indigenous biology there.
[38:01.800 --> 38:04.400]  And, you know, when I was looking at
[38:04.400 --> 38:07.680]  Wormy's compost yesterday, like, you know,
[38:07.680 --> 38:09.920]  you could be in one field of view
[38:09.920 --> 38:12.320]  and you could have the whole soil food web
[38:12.320 --> 38:13.440]  in one field of view.
[38:13.440 --> 38:15.480]  And that just rarely ever happens
[38:15.480 --> 38:18.520]  where you have a nematode, like a ciliate,
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.720]  a flagellate, a fungal hyphae, you know,
[38:22.720 --> 38:24.120]  all in one field of view.
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.000]  It's pretty incredible.
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.760]  And for me, I guess that's more where I kind of view
[38:30.760 --> 38:33.520]  as a bio-complete compost is more,
[38:33.520 --> 38:36.320]  it's gonna be more towards the old growth forest.
[38:37.160 --> 38:42.160]  From my, you know, I took Dr. Elaine Ingham's courses.
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.680]  I think she had a falling out with the lady or whatever,
[38:44.680 --> 38:46.440]  but they were online courses.
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.280]  And that was the main thing
[38:47.280 --> 38:49.160]  that they were really pushing back then
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.680]  was like old growth forest, old growth forest.
[38:51.680 --> 38:54.200]  And we were, you know, really approaching that
[38:54.200 --> 38:55.600]  with the cannabis aspect.
[38:55.600 --> 38:58.600]  And once our mindset shifted towards that,
[38:58.600 --> 38:59.680]  because some of the other mentors
[38:59.680 --> 39:01.800]  would only really talk about bacteria back,
[39:01.800 --> 39:03.040]  you know, in those days.
[39:03.040 --> 39:05.840]  So once we started to focus on more of the fungal growth,
[39:05.840 --> 39:07.960]  realizing that mushrooms in your soil
[39:07.960 --> 39:09.980]  was actually a good thing,
[39:09.980 --> 39:12.760]  that's when we started to notice, shout out to Bog.
[39:12.760 --> 39:14.160]  He passed away, I think last year,
[39:14.160 --> 39:16.720]  but, you know, certain genetics you could buy,
[39:16.720 --> 39:18.720]  you would actually start to see those colors
[39:18.720 --> 39:21.040]  really come out, the purples and the blues.
[39:21.960 --> 39:24.160]  No one else, at least in our little network,
[39:24.160 --> 39:25.760]  was able to achieve that.
[39:25.760 --> 39:27.520]  And that's when our group really took off
[39:27.520 --> 39:30.200]  with the fungal aspects have to be something important here.
[39:30.200 --> 39:32.300]  So were there some other ways
[39:32.300 --> 39:35.120]  that those guys are building up the fungal aspects
[39:35.120 --> 39:37.360]  or is it just the spent mushroom blocks
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.520]  and healthy worms and time and all that?
[39:40.520 --> 39:43.400]  And they don't like disturb the pile
[39:43.400 --> 39:45.680]  for like a good like eight months to a year.
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.640]  So that's really, really beneficial for the fungal growth
[39:49.640 --> 39:52.600]  because as soon as you start to lean things up
[39:52.600 --> 39:55.800]  or mixing things, then it's gonna break up
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.200]  all that hyphae and that's how they get
[39:58.200 --> 40:00.040]  those long strands, you know?
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.720]  Yeah, but so, you know, when you're building soil,
[40:08.120 --> 40:11.820]  you start with those lower successional
[40:11.820 --> 40:16.820]  like bacteria organisms like the EM and the lab
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.960]  and those get things broken down.
[40:19.160 --> 40:22.760]  They also break down like toxins and stuff.
[40:23.760 --> 40:26.400]  That's also why I spray them on my compost piles
[40:26.400 --> 40:29.640]  because it's like, you can't really get away
[40:29.640 --> 40:34.040]  from the pesticides that have been used on the food scrap
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.520]  or let's say the horses have been eating hay
[40:37.520 --> 40:39.280]  that's sprayed with stuff.
[40:39.280 --> 40:43.440]  And it's just hard to get rid of toxins in this day and age.
[40:43.440 --> 40:48.440]  So utilizing those fermented organisms
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.760]  to do that is really beneficial as well.
[40:53.760 --> 40:57.160]  And then, you know, coming in and adding
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.640]  your higher successional organisms like, you know,
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.000]  the soil food web or the biocomplete compost
[41:08.440 --> 41:10.060]  to build soil.
[41:12.320 --> 41:14.720]  And then I kinda wanna now talk more about,
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.400]  and at least in Colorado, again, from my experience,
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.520]  it's very hard to find success growing
[41:21.520 --> 41:25.840]  with a living soil system in a vertical grow.
[41:25.840 --> 41:27.640]  And that seems like something that you guys
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.280]  have really started to comprehend and are thriving with.
[41:31.280 --> 41:33.160]  So I was wanting to pick your brain
[41:33.160 --> 41:34.800]  on how is that grow set up?
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.360]  And, you know, I would imagine you guys
[41:37.360 --> 41:39.660]  have thought things down to like obviously airflow
[41:39.660 --> 41:42.200]  and how things are changing, you know,
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.200]  climbing up the ladder there.
[41:44.200 --> 41:47.040]  How are you able to, you know, also give it
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.080]  the same attention as the floor one,
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.560]  as you do for like three, you know, three, four floors up?
[41:52.560 --> 41:54.960]  Because that was actually how we kind of made our money
[41:54.960 --> 41:57.780]  back in the day is that the higher it seemed to go up,
[41:57.780 --> 42:00.480]  the less the team was focused on that.
[42:00.480 --> 42:02.280]  And then it would cause a lot of issues.
[42:02.280 --> 42:03.120]  Yeah.
[42:04.280 --> 42:09.280]  So yeah, Haifa, we'll have to do an episode with everyone
[42:11.840 --> 42:14.920]  because the building aspect of it,
[42:14.920 --> 42:17.380]  I was not really too involved with.
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.800]  So I'm really like more of just like,
[42:21.800 --> 42:23.960]  I brought the idea of like living soil
[42:23.960 --> 42:25.600]  and I do like ecosystem,
[42:25.600 --> 42:28.080]  I call myself like ecosystem management.
[42:28.940 --> 42:33.940]  So as far as like the building and the vertical,
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.300]  that's a really great question for the guys.
[42:42.300 --> 42:46.020]  And maybe we can do another back to back or something.
[42:46.020 --> 42:48.180]  We can see if they're available next week.
[42:50.380 --> 42:51.220]  And-
[42:51.220 --> 42:53.260]  Yeah, I got the background all queued up for that.
[42:53.260 --> 42:54.460]  I know.
[42:54.460 --> 42:56.020]  Confused Peter and everything.
[42:56.020 --> 42:56.860]  Yeah.
[42:59.100 --> 43:00.580]  So let's get into the nitty gritty then,
[43:00.580 --> 43:02.700]  because that's more of what I'm after, I guess anyway,
[43:02.700 --> 43:05.340]  is how are you keeping things healthier?
[43:05.340 --> 43:06.940]  I've asked late in this even,
[43:06.940 --> 43:08.300]  and sometimes maybe, you know,
[43:08.300 --> 43:11.040]  this is more maybe on a metaphysical side of things,
[43:11.780 --> 43:12.600]  but it seems like when you're having
[43:12.600 --> 43:14.400]  all of these raised beds or pots,
[43:14.400 --> 43:16.280]  the higher things go up,
[43:16.280 --> 43:18.240]  the harder it is to keep them healthy.
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.280]  And, you know, when I talked to some of my hippie friends,
[43:21.280 --> 43:23.480]  you know, in Boulder and stuff,
[43:23.480 --> 43:24.520]  they would talk about how,
[43:24.520 --> 43:26.480]  oh man, it's cause it's not grounded.
[43:26.480 --> 43:27.920]  There's no way the plant could.
[43:27.920 --> 43:30.080]  So let's kind of dive into that
[43:30.080 --> 43:32.520]  if you want to put your tinfoil hat on for me for a second,
[43:32.520 --> 43:33.960]  and maybe kind of understand
[43:33.960 --> 43:37.160]  how you guys are achieving such success with that.
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.480]  Yeah, so I've definitely heard that too,
[43:40.920 --> 43:43.120]  but honestly, I don't really see it.
[43:43.120 --> 43:43.960]  I don't really see it.
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.360]  We only have two tiers.
[43:46.360 --> 43:48.560]  We only have like a bottom and a top.
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.560]  So I just, it's not that like the top performs any worse.
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.320]  Like honestly, sometimes it performs better.
[43:58.320 --> 44:00.080]  The biology on top,
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.880]  like as far as like the microbiology and the soil,
[44:02.880 --> 44:05.560]  there's not really much of a difference.
[44:05.560 --> 44:06.400]  I don't, you know,
[44:06.400 --> 44:08.800]  I don't really notice too much of a difference,
[44:08.800 --> 44:13.040]  but I mean, I see it as far as like, you know,
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.120]  maybe, I don't know, I guess I haven't noticed.
[44:17.120 --> 44:19.320]  But I've heard that before.
[44:19.320 --> 44:20.560]  These girls were more like, yeah,
[44:20.560 --> 44:22.560]  like four or five tiers up.
[44:22.560 --> 44:24.840]  You would have to get on one of those like construction
[44:24.840 --> 44:26.080]  or painter things, you know,
[44:26.080 --> 44:28.400]  and hoist yourself up to get to it.
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.240]  Yeah.
[44:29.240 --> 44:31.560]  So I guess that design probably makes a little more sense
[44:31.560 --> 44:33.920]  than some of these that people felt like
[44:33.920 --> 44:36.640]  they could just build up and find success that way.
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.920]  Maybe because it's like in soil that maybe helps a lot
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.600]  as compared to like maybe these other girls
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.600]  are not using soil.
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.560]  They're in like a hydroponic setup or something.
[44:49.400 --> 44:51.320]  No, a lot of these were in soil,
[44:51.320 --> 44:54.320]  but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a living,
[44:54.320 --> 44:56.000]  thriving soil system.
[44:56.960 --> 44:58.960]  And the humidity that always seemed off, you know,
[44:58.960 --> 45:01.480]  it's hard to really dial in humidity in Colorado.
[45:01.480 --> 45:02.880]  We don't have any.
[45:02.880 --> 45:04.720]  So people always pump too much.
[45:04.760 --> 45:07.080]  And, you know, it's a Goldilocks approach
[45:07.080 --> 45:08.400]  with that as well.
[45:08.400 --> 45:10.320]  So it's, you know, when the team's here,
[45:10.320 --> 45:12.840]  I guess we can obviously pick the brain on that.
[45:12.840 --> 45:14.520]  But what are you, you know,
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.240]  how are you amending your soils?
[45:17.240 --> 45:19.760]  And when things are taking off there,
[45:19.760 --> 45:22.000]  are you kind of like putting gas to the fire?
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.080]  Are you pumping the brakes
[45:23.080 --> 45:25.760]  and allowing the diversity to build?
[45:25.760 --> 45:27.800]  What are your thought processes?
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.120]  I know a lot of people like this when you're, you know,
[45:30.120 --> 45:32.120]  yeah, you have a successful grow,
[45:32.120 --> 45:33.760]  but I know you're still thinking three months,
[45:33.760 --> 45:35.400]  six months, nine months of,
[45:35.400 --> 45:37.680]  on a perpetual side of things.
[45:37.680 --> 45:39.240]  So we wanted to pick your brain on that.
[45:39.240 --> 45:41.280]  And especially from a female perspective,
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.600]  I felt like I've learned the most from female farmers
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.320]  and trying to understand more of ways to improve.
[45:48.320 --> 45:50.080]  Shout out to Jessica, you know,
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.480]  hopefully she comes on the show as well.
[45:51.480 --> 45:53.480]  I think there's a lot to learn from,
[45:53.480 --> 45:57.120]  from especially just female philosophy
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  and thinking and stuff.
[45:59.120 --> 46:01.560]  You guys just seem to have a better way to nurture,
[46:01.560 --> 46:02.760]  nurture things than men.
[46:03.920 --> 46:06.440]  Oh gosh, well, thank you.
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.000]  But, so I'll just kind of tell you like my story
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.960]  and how I like got into growing living soil
[46:17.960 --> 46:20.360]  and how HIFA got started
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.440]  and kind of what's been happening there.
[46:24.280 --> 46:29.280]  So I started in Colorado growing
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.920]  and I actually met Colin from Ethos
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.280]  and I was growing weed when I met him, but not well.
[46:40.280 --> 46:44.680]  And he kind of took me under his wing
[46:44.680 --> 46:46.560]  and showed me how to grow.
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.720]  And I ended up working for his company for a while,
[46:49.720 --> 46:52.480]  doing a pheno hunts out there.
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.040]  But all the while I was, you know,
[46:55.080 --> 46:59.560]  I knew about the corruption and the government
[46:59.560 --> 47:02.840]  and Monsanto and how, you know,
[47:02.840 --> 47:05.320]  detrimental the agriculture industry is.
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.080]  So I knew that like the only way to like truly,
[47:09.080 --> 47:12.120]  you know, have healthy food would be to like
[47:12.120 --> 47:14.000]  grow it yourself organically.
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.600]  So I started like big time researching into organics
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.600]  and how to be self-sustainable.
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.040]  And then my partner who I met in Colorado
[47:30.960 --> 47:32.680]  ended up moving out to Michigan
[47:32.680 --> 47:35.360]  to be a part of a caregiver grow.
[47:35.360 --> 47:38.720]  And then I ended up moving out here
[47:38.720 --> 47:41.880]  and they let me set up some living soil pots.
[47:41.880 --> 47:44.360]  And I was just like so excited
[47:44.360 --> 47:47.560]  because I had been planning this out for like years.
[47:48.760 --> 47:51.960]  So all the different things that I, you know,
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.960]  wanted to try with the living soil system.
[47:55.960 --> 48:00.960]  So they ended up being able to get a license.
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.480]  So, and you know, we had been growing the living soil pots
[48:05.480 --> 48:08.200]  in the caregiver grow and they're going pretty well.
[48:08.200 --> 48:09.880]  And you know, no one wanted to,
[48:09.880 --> 48:11.760]  everyone wanted to smoke the organic stuff.
[48:11.760 --> 48:14.800]  So when they got the license, it was like, you know,
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.560]  this is the organics is the only way that, you know,
[48:18.560 --> 48:20.240]  we wanna do this.
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.240]  So they let me, they let me, you know,
[48:26.120 --> 48:30.240]  design the soil recipe and kind of the ecosystem there.
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.240]  And the first couple of harvests were okay,
[48:36.040 --> 48:41.040]  but you know, things definitely were looking pretty funky.
[48:42.920 --> 48:45.040]  Like the plants were just weak.
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.240]  We were seeing like major deficiencies and weak stocks
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.960]  and like dropping leaves and pest pressure.
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.800]  And like, I knew, you know, something was missing.
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.800]  So, you know, I stumbled upon Elaine's work
[49:02.600 --> 49:07.240]  and started taking her classes and, you know,
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.240]  right away started applying those to the grow at HIFA
[49:12.440 --> 49:15.120]  and things turned around immediately.
[49:16.120 --> 49:20.560]  Once we got the biology that we needed in the soil,
[49:20.560 --> 49:25.560]  because before that we were not using any biology at all.
[49:26.040 --> 49:30.160]  And it was just more so of looking at it
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.160]  from like a conventional organic perspective, perhaps,
[49:35.480 --> 49:38.960]  just like focusing on like amending and minerals
[49:38.960 --> 49:40.200]  and things like that.
[49:40.200 --> 49:45.200]  And not having any idea of what the biology is doing at all.
[49:46.200 --> 49:51.000]  So, you know, we took that soil, you know,
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.900]  we added biology and, you know, now the plants are thriving.
[49:54.900 --> 49:59.900]  So we just really, we haven't had to reamend the beds
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.240]  at all in the past two years.
[50:04.240 --> 50:08.960]  I don't, I do do soil testing on the beds
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.320]  and I just, you know, make sure that all the nutrient levels
[50:12.320 --> 50:14.160]  are where they need to be.
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.080]  But, you know, we have not had to reamend at all.
[50:19.080 --> 50:23.120]  And I don't really anticipate maybe ever having to,
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.040]  as long as we keep applying compost, applying biology,
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.320]  chop and drop and cycling nutrients in there.
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.200]  Yeah, so people aren't confused.
[50:35.200 --> 50:37.200]  I mean, technically you're reamending,
[50:37.200 --> 50:39.280]  you're just doing it the way mother nature does it
[50:39.280 --> 50:40.520]  with the chop and drop.
[50:40.520 --> 50:42.880]  Yeah, that's a good point, thank you.
[50:42.880 --> 50:43.720]  Yeah.
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.440]  I mean, you know, this show is obviously geared
[50:45.440 --> 50:47.600]  to individuals that are wanting to more get
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.280]  into this kind of stuff.
[50:49.280 --> 50:51.700]  And, you know, that's why you're, you know,
[50:51.700 --> 50:52.960]  I asked you to be on the show.
[50:52.960 --> 50:54.320]  Unfortunately you got sick last time.
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.000]  So excited to have you and pick your brain here
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.340]  because, you know, building these soil systems
[50:59.340 --> 51:02.640]  in a commercial setting is a drastically different thing.
[51:02.640 --> 51:05.080]  And you have, you know, all these different cracks
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.400]  and stuff, you know, a lot of the times
[51:07.400 --> 51:10.480]  they put the cannabis people in these kind of, you know,
[51:10.480 --> 51:14.280]  far off in the shittier parts of town.
[51:14.280 --> 51:16.880]  So the warehouses aren't built the way, you know,
[51:16.880 --> 51:18.680]  to the way that, you know,
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.200]  indoor cannabis farmer is probably used to.
[51:21.200 --> 51:22.960]  I mean, even in the basement and stuff, you know,
[51:22.960 --> 51:25.400]  you're going around fixing little things like that
[51:25.400 --> 51:27.200]  where on a commercial side of things,
[51:27.200 --> 51:29.760]  it's really hard to achieve that.
[51:29.760 --> 51:33.080]  So when you're talking about like pest pressures and stuff,
[51:33.080 --> 51:36.080]  from day one, did you start using more of like
[51:36.080 --> 51:39.640]  the natural IPM approach or like,
[51:39.640 --> 51:42.760]  what was more of your protocols when setting that up
[51:42.760 --> 51:44.720]  and being proactive?
[51:45.760 --> 51:49.080]  Yeah, so in the beginning,
[51:50.720 --> 51:52.880]  I guess we didn't have the biology.
[51:52.880 --> 51:56.600]  So at the beginning we just did,
[51:56.600 --> 51:58.160]  I didn't know what I was doing anyways.
[51:58.160 --> 52:01.880]  I'll speak for myself looking back.
[52:01.880 --> 52:06.160]  But once we started doing like the biology and the teas,
[52:06.160 --> 52:10.440]  like the compost teas are the number one IPM,
[52:12.840 --> 52:15.000]  I guess, thing that we add.
[52:16.440 --> 52:21.440]  It's just so beneficial for keeping, you know,
[52:22.280 --> 52:24.440]  pests and disease off the plant
[52:24.440 --> 52:29.000]  and just making the microbiome of the phyllosphere healthy
[52:29.000 --> 52:29.840]  in general.
[52:29.840 --> 52:34.200]  It's so important to have that microbe skin
[52:34.200 --> 52:36.040]  over all over everything.
[52:36.040 --> 52:41.040]  And, you know, we've seen that this helps prevent,
[52:41.520 --> 52:44.520]  you know, pest pressure and just overall
[52:44.520 --> 52:46.080]  makes the plant healthier.
[52:46.080 --> 52:51.080]  So, and also with, you know, testing and stuff as well,
[52:52.240 --> 52:57.240]  it's really important to get good biodiversity on your leaf
[52:58.240 --> 53:02.240]  so that, you know, when things do get tested,
[53:02.240 --> 53:05.120]  like in a lab, you know, they can only culture
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.120]  like 1% of the biology that is out there.
[53:10.240 --> 53:15.200]  So by adding a tea that has like all this biodiversity
[53:15.200 --> 53:17.160]  in there to the leaf surface,
[53:17.160 --> 53:20.640]  you're decreasing the chance that anything
[53:20.640 --> 53:24.320]  is gonna come up on your like yeast and mold test.
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.360]  So that's something that, you know, we've seen
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.720]  is that adding that diversity to the leaf surface
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.840]  is really important for that as well,
[53:38.840 --> 53:41.120]  because nothing's ever gonna be sterile.
[53:41.120 --> 53:44.520]  Like this idea of sterile is just like, you know,
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.480]  completely ridiculous.
[53:46.480 --> 53:48.440]  It's like a fantasy really.
[53:48.440 --> 53:53.440]  So like, I'm not a fan of yeast and mold testing.
[53:54.200 --> 53:57.880]  Or is sterile what we would actually call dead
[53:57.880 --> 53:59.360]  because there's no life.
[53:59.360 --> 54:01.200]  It's so sterile.
[54:01.200 --> 54:02.200]  I don't wanna be dead.
[54:02.200 --> 54:04.120]  I'd rather be alive, thanks.
[54:04.120 --> 54:04.960]  Just my idea.
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.960]  Thank you, yes.
[54:07.960 --> 54:09.560]  I completely agree.
[54:09.560 --> 54:10.600]  Hell yeah.
[54:10.600 --> 54:12.360]  It's pretty, I don't know if you know,
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.280]  I'm about to have a child, Alexa,
[54:14.280 --> 54:16.280]  and just starting to understand
[54:16.280 --> 54:17.760]  and asking the doctors their questions
[54:17.760 --> 54:20.920]  and realizing that I guess if you are born,
[54:20.920 --> 54:23.160]  that you're the sperm that won the race
[54:23.840 --> 54:26.200]  is pretty a mind blowing thing to think about.
[54:26.200 --> 54:28.360]  You know, it's like, wow.
[54:28.360 --> 54:30.800]  Out of the billions that could happen,
[54:30.800 --> 54:31.720]  you were there first.
[54:31.720 --> 54:33.400]  And then once you were there first,
[54:33.400 --> 54:35.920]  there is a calcium burst from what I understand
[54:36.960 --> 54:39.920]  when the sperm, you know, penetrates the egg.
[54:39.920 --> 54:43.000]  And then once that like almost like electricity thing
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.760]  is shown, it's a spark that you can, you know,
[54:45.760 --> 54:49.760]  see I think with a fancy microscope.
[54:49.760 --> 54:51.720]  Thank you so much, brains goddess.
[54:51.720 --> 54:53.640]  But I always thought that was pretty interesting too.
[54:53.640 --> 54:55.000]  Like no matter what's going on,
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.800]  calcium seems to be the catalyst,
[54:57.800 --> 55:00.560]  the spark for really building life.
[55:00.560 --> 55:03.800]  And I know from a lot of the heartaches
[55:03.800 --> 55:04.760]  and stuff back in the day,
[55:04.760 --> 55:07.120]  when it was coming to a commercial system,
[55:07.120 --> 55:08.720]  they weren't getting enough calcium.
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.440]  So there wasn't a, you know,
[55:10.440 --> 55:13.360]  compaction things would start to build up
[55:13.360 --> 55:14.280]  because of the calcium.
[55:14.280 --> 55:15.880]  They weren't using composting worms.
[55:15.880 --> 55:17.960]  So how are you guys able to continue
[55:17.960 --> 55:20.840]  to use your soil systems without that compaction
[55:21.080 --> 55:22.400]  and without re-amending?
[55:25.360 --> 55:26.880]  Yeah, I think,
[55:29.240 --> 55:33.640]  so we do transplant into the beds.
[55:33.640 --> 55:35.600]  Like I know Green Life Productions,
[55:35.600 --> 55:37.840]  you know how they have like their,
[55:37.840 --> 55:40.440]  they put the pots on the soil.
[55:41.720 --> 55:43.880]  You know, I think that would be beneficial,
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.520]  but we can't do that because of our height restrictions,
[55:47.520 --> 55:52.520]  because we have the, sorry, vertical setup.
[55:52.680 --> 55:56.080]  And so we're disturbing the soil.
[55:56.080 --> 55:57.560]  We have to disturb the soil.
[55:57.560 --> 56:01.080]  So it's, you know, really, really important that,
[56:01.080 --> 56:03.040]  you know, you come in right away
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.040]  with a really nice compost extract
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.240]  and you get those organisms back in there,
[56:10.240 --> 56:11.880]  you know, right away.
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.880]  And also what I've seen is having a,
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.000]  really nice mulch layer is also very important,
[56:23.080 --> 56:24.560]  you know, for a while.
[56:25.800 --> 56:30.600]  Yes, for a while, we're actually having massive
[56:30.600 --> 56:34.160]  like pill bug issues,
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.360]  just crawling up the plants, eating the stocks
[56:37.360 --> 56:40.480]  and, you know, causing pathogens to get in there
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.200]  and just causing all kinds of problems.
[56:44.200 --> 56:45.040]  And-
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.000]  I wanna be clear.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.960]  These were the basic grays
[56:47.960 --> 56:50.240]  that were causing all these issues?
[56:50.240 --> 56:53.080]  I would say basic grays, I'm no pill bug expert, but-
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.000]  Well, those are the, I just,
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.080]  those are like the baloney of-
[56:56.080 --> 56:58.920]  Brian has to defend his dog.
[56:58.920 --> 57:00.560]  This story ends very nicely.
[57:00.560 --> 57:02.560]  Don't use baloney, say it like this.
[57:02.560 --> 57:03.920]  Nicely, so,
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.360]  pill bugs are friends, trust me, we love them.
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.840]  So, but there was no mulch layer
[57:12.960 --> 57:14.400]  when we were having these problems.
[57:14.400 --> 57:15.240]  So,
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.560]  I, you know, we get the mulch layer on there
[57:19.560 --> 57:21.240]  and get a really nice mulch layer on there.
[57:21.240 --> 57:23.000]  And then all of a sudden you have
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.600]  all these other organisms come back,
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.200]  like centipedes, rogue beetles, mites, springtails.
[57:29.200 --> 57:32.840]  And then all of a sudden the pill bugs have competition.
[57:32.840 --> 57:34.760]  So they're not like,
[57:35.800 --> 57:39.360]  you know, taking over the entire bed like they were.
[57:39.360 --> 57:42.720]  Now they're just in this perfect balance
[57:42.720 --> 57:44.360]  with everything else.
[57:44.360 --> 57:47.320]  And, you know, they're obviously very helpful
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.600]  for decomposing and making nutrients available.
[57:51.600 --> 57:54.680]  And, you know, their poop is very, you know,
[57:54.680 --> 57:56.080]  beneficial for the soil.
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.120]  So we want them in there just at balanced amounts.
[57:59.120 --> 58:01.840]  And that, you know, really goes for everything.
[58:01.840 --> 58:05.680]  I think even like, you know, to a certain extent,
[58:05.680 --> 58:08.560]  things that we may consider like pests or pathogens,
[58:08.560 --> 58:12.120]  because, you know, those are what really makes the plant,
[58:13.080 --> 58:16.160]  express its fullest terpene profile also,
[58:16.160 --> 58:19.200]  because if it has a little bit of pest pressure,
[58:19.200 --> 58:21.720]  you know, it's gonna be making more so
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.760]  of more of those terpenes
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.360]  versus if it doesn't have any pest pressure, you know,
[58:27.360 --> 58:32.360]  it doesn't have really any reason to produce those.
[58:33.840 --> 58:37.440]  Yeah, and the manure from the decomposers as a whole,
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.560]  is it, you know, again, in my opinion,
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.840]  a part of that secret sauce,
[58:42.560 --> 58:44.440]  because it feeds the next generation.
[58:44.440 --> 58:47.040]  And then if you do have an issue with something,
[58:47.040 --> 58:50.800]  I mean, again, you can use, like I have a bearded dragon.
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.200]  So if, you know, unfortunately I don't have any issues
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.160]  with isopods getting over, you know, breeding them.
[58:58.160 --> 59:00.640]  I wish they would breed quicker, to be honest.
[59:00.640 --> 59:02.680]  But if you did, I mean, there's natural ways
[59:02.680 --> 59:04.920]  to break those things down and use them.
[59:04.920 --> 59:06.760]  I mean, if I was outdoors, I would use chickens,
[59:06.760 --> 59:09.000]  you know, indoors, bearded dragon.
[59:09.040 --> 59:12.240]  So there's just a variety of ways to solve those issues.
[59:12.240 --> 59:14.800]  And especially when you're farming cannabis
[59:14.800 --> 59:16.640]  on a commercial level indoors,
[59:16.640 --> 59:18.560]  everything has to be in balance, you know?
[59:18.560 --> 59:20.800]  And I believe it was Dr. Elaine Ingham
[59:20.800 --> 59:22.920]  that was even saying, you need a little bit
[59:22.920 --> 59:25.400]  of pockets of non-beneficials
[59:25.400 --> 59:27.920]  so that everybody's still kind of like on guard
[59:27.920 --> 59:28.760]  and making sure.
[59:28.760 --> 59:32.680]  So mother nature kind of still allows that in a way as well
[59:32.680 --> 59:35.200]  where everybody's staying on board,
[59:35.200 --> 59:37.120]  getting back to where you're sterile.
[59:37.120 --> 59:39.480]  Like mother nature is obviously clean,
[59:39.480 --> 59:40.600]  everybody's working together,
[59:40.600 --> 59:44.160]  but she's still in a way allows a little bit of bullshit
[59:44.160 --> 59:46.360]  just to make sure that everybody, I guess,
[59:46.360 --> 59:48.760]  knows their place and keeps in line
[59:48.760 --> 59:50.640]  and continues to work together.
[59:52.200 --> 59:54.600]  Yeah, it seems like you were saying before,
[59:54.600 --> 59:56.960]  like there's this like perfect,
[59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.720]  like Goldilocks type environment
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.520]  to which like all biodiversity like thrives
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.040]  and lives in harmony.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.360]  So like, you know, if we look at-
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.360]  The Garden of Eden it is called, my love,
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.400]  the Garden of Eden.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.440]  Yeah, so like we are like really only as healthy
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.400]  as our environment.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.440]  So like the environment contains the threshold
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.720]  for how like healthy we can be.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.800]  So like, you know, if we look at soil,
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.000]  we know like soil health,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  we say soil health equals human health.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.800]  Well, what determines soil health?
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.360]  It's the microbes.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.160]  Okay, so microbe health equals human health,
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.360]  but take it deeper than that.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.360]  What determines the health of the microbes
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.640]  and it's the health of the environment around.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.480]  So yeah, like I was saying,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.720]  it just seems to be like there's this perfect balance
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.160]  or environment where all that biodiversity thrives
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.920]  and is working together in harmony,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.960]  kind of like the example with the pill bugs
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.480]  I just told you.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.240]  And then whenever we shift
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.600]  toward these environmental extremes,
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.040]  like we're seeing now today with, you know,
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.680]  everything that we're doing to cause harm to the environment.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.960]  So whenever we shift to these extremes,
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.720]  that's when we see like these problems
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.200]  and infestations of organisms taking over
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.240]  and, you know, causing problems.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.040]  Yeah, I think that's just in anything in life.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.520]  I even learned from Dr. Lane Hingham about, you know,
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.640]  back in the day when you're brewing your compost teas
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.240]  to bring it into the actual place
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.200]  where you're going to spray your teas
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.760]  so that you're building the microbial life
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.720]  at the same temperature
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.160]  that you're gonna be spraying on the plants.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.520]  I remember an example she was using
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.560]  is when the Bellagio Hotel at first
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.040]  was listening to what she was saying
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.800]  and then they didn't wanna brew the tea inside.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.720]  So they started brewing it outside
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.480]  and it affected the whole biology
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.560]  and the whole system crashed.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.920]  So there's just so many things
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.240]  that you really gotta understand
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.680]  kind of the laws of nature
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.960]  and kind of respect that in a way,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.520]  like play around with things, of course,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.040]  but realize that, especially when it comes to compost teas,
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.360]  we were adding so much sugar that I would imagine that,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.920]  we were brewing these things,
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.160]  letting them 24 hours, 48 hours.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.200]  Reality, adding the sugar at the beginning,
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.840]  now I've learned is,
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.400]  we were creating non-diverse compost teas
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.680]  because we were just allowing those alphas to emerge
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.320]  by giving them the extra sugars.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.040]  So that's something else I want the newer audience
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.040]  to realize is keep it super simple
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.360]  when you're brewing these compost teas,
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.960]  especially when you're first getting into it.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.400]  Cause I know my group, man, we were like,
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.960]  oh, we learned about, now we gotta add alfalfa meal.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.320]  So now we got it, it was almost,
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.920]  we went from one ingredient to now we have 12 ingredients
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.160]  thinking that we were brewing something that,
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.560]  and the reality was it kind of stunk back then,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.720]  and we thought that was, can't fake the funk.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.680]  That's how it's done.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.960]  But the reality is it really should smell
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.440]  almost like I have a sweetness to it.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.120]  And there's a shelf life.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.880]  You can't go five days brewing a compost tea,
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880]  that kind of thing.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.560]  Yeah, I don't know, maybe,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.560]  like it just depends like what your goals are
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.440]  and what you're trying to do.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.480]  Like for, if you're just trying to do an air,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.480]  so what I do is, you can make a longer brews, let's say,
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.160]  and at that point it's just gonna be kind of
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.280]  like a ferment almost.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.280]  So I guess what I like to do is,
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.320]  you know, if I'm making an aerated compost tea,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.960]  it's because I'm brewing,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.760]  I need the most biodiversity as possible.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.200]  Like that's my goal with the aerobic compost teas.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.320]  And then for me, like the fermented compost tea.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.360]  Real quick, that means you're adding air.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.200]  Yes, aerating.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.600]  You're actively aerating the compost tea.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.960]  Yes, actively aerating.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.360]  And then like for ferments,
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.760]  they're just like different application purposes.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.760]  So like that's for decomposing compost or building soil,
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.920]  making things available, breaking down toxins and stuff.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.080]  And then, so for the aerated compost tea,
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.800]  I'll come in with that after, you know,
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.680]  those lower successional organisms have,
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.240]  fermenting organisms have been added.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.400]  Then you come in with the aerated compost tea.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.440]  And again, the goal with the aerated compost tea
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.440]  is just to have the most biology possible.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.480]  And I honestly only use aerated compost teas
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.760]  for spraying, like foliar sprays,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  because, you know, I think it does have something to do
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.000]  with how Hulane says the microbes become more sticky
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.040]  when they're brewed.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.200]  So that's kind of just what I've stuck with and it works.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.200]  So I tend to use the aerated compost tea for foliar.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.040]  And then to get actual like maximum diversity
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.000]  out of a compost, you just make a compost extract.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.120]  So that's just, you know, massaging the compost
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.240]  in some water and then watering it in right away
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.480]  and not brewing it, not using any air at all.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.160]  So that's really how you're gonna get
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.320]  the maximum amount of diversity is from a compost extract.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.840]  And then once you add those food resources,
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.720]  like you're saying, you're kind of limiting
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.640]  the amount of diversity that's gonna be there
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.680]  because only the organisms who can take in that food
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.400]  or source will be growing in that compost tea.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.000]  They'll kind of be able to take over.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.840]  So-
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.400]  Yeah, they're gonna snatch your chain.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.800]  You don't be afraid of them.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.080]  That's, yeah, it's the exact opposite
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.800]  of what you're trying to get at.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.320]  And moving forward, you know, time is money.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.680]  Everybody, you know, especially if you're
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.880]  at a larger facility, I want my labor force
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.760]  on point the entire time.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.240]  So now more individuals are moving away
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.000]  from the compost teas and doing more of like an extract.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.600]  You kind of want to talk about that
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.440]  and maybe the pros and cons of using that
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.920]  compared to brewing a compost tea.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.520]  Yeah, so the, I guess the biggest pro
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.120]  of using a compost extract is, you know,
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.720]  it's easier and you're gonna get more diversity.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.720]  I literally only use the compost,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.000]  the brewed aerated compost tea
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.720]  for a foliar spray for IPM.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:19.680]  And that seems to work really well with it brewed.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.120]  So, you know, I will continue to do that.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.320]  You know, maybe in the future mess around
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.600]  with just using compost extracts for foilers,
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.200]  but the tea's working for now.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.200]  And my recipe for that is I use,
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.880]  kind of my secret ingredient is a ganja leaf.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.800]  So I'll rip up the leaves and throw that in there.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.480]  And that seems to really provide a nice,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.040]  the most diversity that I've seen from any food resource.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.120]  So just using the plant, yes,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.640]  using the plant that you're trying to grow
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.080]  as your fertilizer, basically.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.560]  Thank you.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.560]  And then also I do really love making protozoa infusions.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.640]  And this is kind of similar to a compost tea,
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.640]  except we're really focusing on the growth
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.560]  of protozoa in it.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.640]  So basically when you're making a compost tea
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.160]  or a protozoan infusion,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.120]  you're first gonna start by making a compost extract.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.840]  So you'll make a compost extract
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.960]  and then add your food resources
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.280]  and then brew it for the compost teas
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.700]  and protozoan infusion.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.600]  The only difference for me between the compost tea
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.000]  and the protozoan infusion is the food resource.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.920]  So in my compost teas, I use fish hydrosolate
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.200]  and this stuff, this like fermented grain extract.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.960]  And then I also use the cannabis leaf.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.600]  And then I brew that for 24 hours.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.280]  And for my protozoan infusions,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.040]  I use molasses and cannabis leaf.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.560]  And then those are brewed for 24 hours.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.940]  And I usually, or sorry, 48 hours.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:34.200]  So protozoan infusions are brewed for 48 hours typically.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.760]  And I do kind of monitor it with the microscope
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.560]  and kind of see when it's ready.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.560]  You'll just see a large diversity of protozoan
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.320]  in those protozoan infusions.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.240]  And the idea is just to grow the bacteria
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.360]  and through growing the bacteria,
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.400]  you'll also grow the protozoan in there
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.960]  since that is their food source.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.960]  And I like to use that around like week three to five.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.120]  I usually do it a couple of times a cycle
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.720]  from week three to five, the protozoan infusions
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.220]  to kind of just like increase nutrient cycling in there,
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:22.220]  give them a little boost during their heavier eating period
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  and I use compost teas as foiler
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.500]  up until week three of flower.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.480]  Now, some individuals,
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.520]  now there's more of like the natural farming side
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.600]  than on like a living soil, Dr. Elaine side,
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.800]  but some individuals like using the limo
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.840]  all the way through flower.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.320]  I've never had the balls to try that.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.640]  Have you ever seen anybody with success
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.400]  spraying anything later into flower
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.840]  other than some individuals have found success
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.880]  with like more of like the limo style?
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.720]  I'm gonna sound so silly.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.920]  What's limo?
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.360]  Oh, liquid IMOs.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.200]  Oh.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.800]  Kind of the idea behind what you're talking about
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.560]  and we've always kind of explained it as,
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.260]  you gotta put the microbes on the skin of the girls as well.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.360]  You need them to be healthy when they're,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.120]  you send them off to college.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.880]  Yeah, so I really do wanna start experimenting
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.480]  with doing like fermented,
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.980]  spraying like fermented inputs.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.980]  We haven't yet just because like the testing thing.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.280]  So I'm just like a little nervous to mess around with it,
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.400]  but I really do want to.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.640]  Again, I think like our biggest thing
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.680]  with passing those tests
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.080]  is having like maximum amount of biodiversity.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.120]  And then I noticed in ferments,
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.000]  like when I put them under the microscope,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.280]  there's really not much diversity in there,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.960]  usually only bacteria.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.840]  So just to like increase our,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.200]  or decrease our chances of failing,
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.680]  we try to have maximum diversity covering the leaf surface,
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.800]  but there's definitely a huge benefit
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.600]  in spraying those things.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.600]  Like if you can like fermented things,
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.380]  like I'm going to experiment with that,
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.600]  like in our garden.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.720]  And right now we're like fermenting some nettles
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.440]  and we're gonna kind of use that for like IPM.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.560]  Cisco and Ebert over here, man.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.560]  I think you're gonna have to reset your browser again,
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.120]  young lady, you're starting to break up.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.840]  Thank you.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.680]  You bet.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.920]  How does that happen?
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.000]  Dude, does anybody know?
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:57.840]  Like why?
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.680]  Magic.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.600]  Stay with Marco.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.920]  He's talking crystal clear, boom, stops working.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.400]  There we go.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.200]  Okay, am I good now?
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.680]  4K, looking good.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.520]  Yep.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.480]  So, sorry, what was I saying?
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.600]  I get weird.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.920]  Just really could finish
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.200]  and talking about the compost and stuff.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.960]  I kind of wanted to switch more to again,
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.680]  like protecting the plant, like you're saying,
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.760]  like spraying the leaves, you know,
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.240]  from a beginner standpoint,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.560]  I don't think people really understood that.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.000]  I was more just spraying maybe some humic acids
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.400]  with some yucca extract, some Epsom salts,
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.600]  you'd see the difference,
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.120]  but actually spraying the life and protecting the plant,
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.080]  maybe starting to understand, obviously,
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.920]  that the plant can't move.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.880]  So how is it going to be able to improve?
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.760]  Well, the healthier, the more nutrients it has,
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.200]  just the overall improvement of health.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.600]  That's when we started to understand,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.600]  or maybe thought that we understood more
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.680]  about bricks levels and ways that we could improve things.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.960]  And it did seem like the healthier the plant,
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960]  the less pest pressures.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.760]  So have you started to notice that, you know,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.160]  as the weeks and months go by,
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.480]  when you're improving things, putting things down,
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.160]  that because the overall health of that system,
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.400]  since you've improved it more
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.740]  with like a soil food web philosophy,
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.520]  the pest pressures have gone down for you
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.800]  in a commercial setting?
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.960]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.960]  We still, you know, use like predator bugs
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.480]  and things like that,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.640]  but really it's all about finding a balance
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.240]  in the ecosystem.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.260]  And I saw you're using one of my favorite,
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.940]  the praying mantis.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.500]  Do you kind of want to go into, you know, why you're using,
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.380]  I'm sure people have heard me talk about that.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.780]  Why are you using them
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.500]  and why is your team using those guys?
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.660]  And what are you noticing with that?
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.540]  Oh my gosh, that was just like a silly, fun thing
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.940]  that we just decided to bring in
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.300]  and didn't even know if it was going to work or not.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.780]  And it was funny because I was literally saying like one day
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.580]  like, you know, like, oh, you know, I didn't,
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.380]  I haven't seen any like praying mantises.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.940]  And then like a few like minutes later, like we find one
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.500]  and then we've just been finding them all over now.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.420]  And it's so funny,
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.220]  cause like we just had these cocoons just like sitting there
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:25.380]  like neglecting for a while before we even put them out.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.460]  And I was like, oh, these things are not going to pop.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:30.500]  And then they did, but yeah, they're really cool.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:35.260]  And I think just adding in diversity wherever we can
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.660]  is kind of key to our system.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.140]  And, you know, like we've even,
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:45.140]  when we were having the pill bug issue,
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.860]  we were even thinking about like bringing in like chickens
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.300]  and lizards and I was looking at to buy him
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.220]  like a bearded dragon.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.460]  Now you're talking Brian's language.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.300]  Right?
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.260]  I mean, I still really want to do it
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.820]  just because I think it would be a lot of fun, but.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.620]  They are more intelligent than you'll give them credit for
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.860]  when you first get them.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.020]  And then you realize like they want to hang out with you.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.580]  And then after you've bonded, man, they're, I don't know.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:20.020]  They're just cool.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.260]  You know, it's like when I first time I had a lion head
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.740]  bunny compared to just a dwarf bunny, you know, I mean,
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.020]  yeah, it's cool to have a dwarf bunny,
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:30.020]  but a lion head is on a whole nother level of experience.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.340]  Having something you can potty train and let it run around
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.140]  and, you know, you don't have to worry about, you know,
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.460]  a bunny's not going to really bite you
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.860]  unless you're scaring it.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.860]  So yeah, it was just a fun experience
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.060]  and now taking it to the reptile side.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.740]  Look at that smile on that boy's face.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.380]  He just loves his babies.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:52.780]  I do, I love, enjoy taking care of my family.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.580]  Part of my family for sure.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.500]  Do you ever like let them run around
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.140]  in like the soil or like the grow room and just like,
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.900]  cause that's what we were kind of going to do
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.820]  is just like let these lizards just like run around
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.460]  in the grow room and I don't know, just kind of like live.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.700]  Would that be a bad idea?
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.100]  Live, I don't think they would be as happy
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.420]  cause they're like I said, they want the companion
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.020]  and you can't put them together or they're going to,
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.060]  they're going to alpha it up.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.300]  Kind of like the praying mantises that, you know,
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.620]  in a way they need to have their space.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.980]  Otherwise they're just going to beat the shit
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:25.820]  out of each other.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.740]  But using a bearded dragon,
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.740]  you can put them down as kind of like maintenance.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.140]  Like if you're in there for a couple of hours,
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.380]  put them down there, he'll run around
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.060]  and he'll eat everything.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.620]  Like if there's flies flying around,
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.180]  he'll snatch that like a praying mantis.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.220]  It's extremely beneficial.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.260]  And then kind of taking it to the next level,
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.580]  you know, they defecate as well.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.780]  And I'm starting to see that there's some,
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.980]  there's some benefit to that
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.860]  just in his little bioactive setup.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.400]  So a lot to learn.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.300]  And if you're outdoors, I know the chickens are tried
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.420]  and true for kind of, if something's out of order,
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.380]  you know, even just a couple of chickens
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.180]  kind of get the job done there.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.380]  Yeah.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.220]  We'll see.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.460]  It would be a fun little thing to try.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:16.460]  And, but yeah, just always adding biodiversity is important.
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.620]  Well, the more diverse that your soil system is,
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.540]  your farm is, your body, your plant's body,
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.660]  the more, the better.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.700]  It will find its own balance.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.420]  And if you're giving it more of the good side,
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.540]  then it's going to weigh to the good balance.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.020]  If you're eating too much sugar,
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:41.100]  like I won't say anything more, you know,
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.660]  it's not that good.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.500]  Okay.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.940]  Oh, Brian's back.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.420]  Oh, what a, oh, look at that baby.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.340]  Well, I just want to,
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.060]  I just want to point out that it's not like you need
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.900]  a huge cage or anything if you take them out.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.580]  And this is something, you know,
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.780]  I feel like I've really always kind of talked about
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.620]  the lion head bunny and what you can use for the,
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.660]  it's a cold manure.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.740]  So if you're indoors, obviously that,
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.420]  if you're outdoors and you're lucky enough to have
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.940]  the ranch, you know, alpaca manure is the end goal for me.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.180]  On the indoor side of things,
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.300]  when you're trying to have more of an IPM perspective,
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.860]  this little guy right here,
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.220]  and you don't have to buy like the orange and red ones
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.140]  or the exotic ones.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:24.380]  And those can get pretty pricey, but you know,
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.940]  the basic green ones and stuff and gray,
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:29.260]  those are, some of those are like 50 bucks at an expo.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.620]  And now you have 50 bucks, in my opinion,
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.620]  well spent that for the,
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.580]  I don't want to compare them to a praying mantis,
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.700]  but this little guy is an apex hunter,
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.660]  at least in that little world.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.980]  And he's obviously going to eat the praying mantis stuff too.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.900]  So, you know, there's just a full circle that you can create
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.720]  by learning more about mother nature.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.100]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:57.940]  So cool.
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:01.660]  I'm definitely really interested in getting one.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.860]  They're so cute.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.700]  Wow.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.300]  He only eats isopods.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.100]  You know, I give him hornworms every now and then,
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.780]  but yeah, so you don't have to spend money
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.820]  on the crickets and stuff.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.340]  Like they'll tell you if you buy one from like a breeder.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.980]  Yeah, you can create a closed loop system for them
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:20.420]  and then have an IPM little machine when you need it.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:22.940]  Yeah.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:28.340]  So a lot of like what I do at the Grow Too for like IPM
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:31.940]  is just like creating the correct environment
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.860]  for biodiversity to thrive.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.540]  Because like I was saying before, you know,
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.760]  there's like this Goldilocks, you know,
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:47.100]  ecosystem that biodiversity will, you know, thrive at.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:50.460]  So a lot of that is just managing the environment
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.180]  and keeping a healthy, balanced environment.
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:58.620]  And that's the key verbiage, managing.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.260]  A lot of people don't realize, you know,
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.420]  we used to think by, you know, week by week,
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.100]  need to feed nitrogen at this level,
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.660]  week two, week three, as things go on.
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.620]  With this style of farming, it's just,
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:10.140]  we're always thinking of the future,
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.860]  always planning for the future,
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.820]  trusting the process and knowing that things
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.340]  are gonna continue to improve.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:20.660]  So I had noticed, have you kind of played around?
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.820]  You said you were doing more of like a chop and drop.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:27.820]  I've noticed just an incredible amount of uptick in life
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:30.500]  when you're using the fan leaves,
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.780]  your cannabis is improving,
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.240]  and now it has the sugar leaves aspect to it.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.220]  From a breakdown standpoint,
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.460]  is there a specific thing within the soil food web
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:44.140]  that is loving trichomes the same way that we are?
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:48.500]  Because it seems like there's an explosion of growth
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.820]  when you kind of do a little, small little forest flora,
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.580]  families with sugar leaves on them.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.580]  You know, we're not composting a lot,
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.420]  or chopping, dropping, or composting much of anything
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.080]  that has too much like resin on it.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.860]  So I'm not really sure,
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.820]  but that's a very, very interesting thought.
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:15.820]  A lot of what I think that's happening
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:21.180]  when I'm seeing more diversity in the teas
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:26.180]  by adding ganja leaf is just the diversity
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.020]  of nutrients within the leaf.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.380]  So I'll be different like amino acids,
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.580]  and sugars, and vitamins, and minerals
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.900]  that are in that leaf that will release into the compost tea
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:41.740]  and then that will provide a diversity
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.580]  of microorganisms to grow.
[01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:50.530]  You know, we interview each and every week.
[01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.930]  And we interview like, hopefully,
[01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:55.290]  at least in our little Rolodex of our group,
[01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:57.730]  some of the brightest people that we can reach out to.
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:59.290]  And the main thing that I love about it
[01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:02.930]  is every single person talks about diversity.
[01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:05.570]  You know, where there's really,
[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:07.810]  I guess in life there's sometimes truths,
[01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:10.850]  and people find their own truth and stuff.
[01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:14.410]  But there's also, my belief is absolute truths.
[01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:16.170]  And when it comes to mother nature and stuff,
[01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:18.410]  she's dialed this in so well
[01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.930]  that it's almost kind of comical
[01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:22.730]  that the cannabis industry started out
[01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:26.530]  by believing that we had to spend the most money possible
[01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.610]  on the fanciest labels of cranberry juice
[01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.530]  and yucca extract for a lot of that stuff,
[01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:35.370]  and think that we were actually doing something
[01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:37.090]  and growing medicine.
[01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:39.050]  Because looking back on that,
[01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:43.370]  we were barely, I should speak for myself,
[01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:45.930]  our group was barely growing,
[01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:47.970]  probably mid-grade at that point.
[01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:49.730]  And then of course it becomes price point
[01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:51.130]  and everybody wants to lowball you
[01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:54.530]  because there's no real quality behind it.
[01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.290]  So why would they, whatever number you throw out,
[01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:59.890]  why would they pay that at the first jump?
[01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:02.250]  Where once the group started to understand
[01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:03.810]  a living soil system,
[01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:06.010]  things started to improve, people wanted that.
[01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:07.170]  Now all of a sudden we had people
[01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.130]  that were willing to prepay for our stuff,
[01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:10.730]  which was mind blowing for us
[01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:12.690]  because now we felt like,
[01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.970]  we're the coolest dudes in the room.
[01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:16.970]  It was a paradigm shift for us
[01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:18.930]  because it was disheartening
[01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:20.570]  to try to compete with individuals
[01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.370]  where my brain and my setup,
[01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:25.490]  I just wasn't at that level at that time
[01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:28.410]  to be able to compete with people that were botanists
[01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:29.770]  because they were kind of controlling
[01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:32.610]  the underground market here in Colorado for a while.
[01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:37.090]  I was just pumping out three pounds of light weed,
[01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:41.370]  didn't necessarily have to have real smell to it
[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:43.330]  as long as it just kind of looked pretty.
[01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:46.290]  And then when you're going to the living soil standpoint,
[01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:50.210]  that's when you crack the jar and you set it down
[01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:52.370]  and people can smell it from across the room.
[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:55.530]  I've personally only ever been able to achieve that
[01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:58.290]  by using a microbial world, mother nature,
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:59.850]  where it's not me doing it,
[01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:01.770]  it's just me managing the system.
[01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.010]  And that's why I want all of you to know that
[01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:06.290]  is because it's not like you have to have
[01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:09.490]  an awesome skill set of cannabis farming to achieve this.
[01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:11.170]  If you just kind of trust the process,
[01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:13.450]  understand where to get quality nutrients
[01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:15.850]  and then continue to educate yourself,
[01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.530]  you're gonna be able to build these systems
[01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.450]  while you're learning
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.250]  compared to where if you're more doing
[01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:23.090]  like a hydroponic setup,
[01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:26.370]  you already need to understand a lot about how
[01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:29.490]  cannabis is farmed to even be able to pull that off
[01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:31.770]  or you're just gonna have so much deficiencies
[01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:34.770]  and issues and pest pressures that you're gonna give up.
[01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.610]  And that's why you see, at least back in the day,
[01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:40.370]  you saw so many hydroponic setups for the home grower
[01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:42.410]  because on Craigslist and stuff,
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.170]  because they just, it was really hard
[01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:45.450]  to find success that way.
[01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:48.650]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:54.970]  I think a lot of what my work is in compost education
[01:25:55.810 --> 01:26:00.810]  is kind of eliminating this stigma that we have
[01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:04.250]  against microorganisms.
[01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:09.250]  And like you said, we kind of have to think about
[01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:13.930]  feeding the soil instead of the plant
[01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:17.050]  and that kind of goes in our own bodies as well.
[01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:22.050]  We kind of have to think about feeding our inner soil,
[01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:28.050]  so the microbes and not really as much focus on feeding,
[01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:35.850]  our bodies really focusing on our inner soil.
[01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:40.290]  And like I said, I've been watching a lot of Zach Bush
[01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:45.290]  lately and he says that the human cell is not actually
[01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:48.850]  at the center of human health.
[01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:53.370]  Our human health is completely determined
[01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:55.930]  by the microbes around it.
[01:26:56.770 --> 01:27:01.210]  So, and this only makes sense because our bodies
[01:27:01.210 --> 01:27:04.250]  are mostly bacteria cells.
[01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:07.170]  Like we have more bacteria cells than human cells.
[01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:10.890]  We have more bacteria DNA than human DNA.
[01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:13.930]  And kind of like how I like to picture it
[01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:17.250]  on like a cellular microscopic level
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:20.930]  is like this human cell that's kind of just like
[01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:24.130]  orbiting around in this like matrix
[01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:27.090]  or like universe of microbes.
[01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:31.610]  So basically like our human cells are just like living
[01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:35.770]  within the microbiome, which is like this complex ecosystem
[01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:38.490]  of biodiversity.
[01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.770]  And another thing that Zach Bush says is that
[01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:46.370]  we exacerbate human disease when we undermine
[01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:48.490]  the work of the microbiome.
[01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:52.650]  And there's a quote that I really like
[01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:57.370]  by my friend, Plant Master P calls himself.
[01:27:57.370 --> 01:28:02.370]  And he says that sin is superseding the intent,
[01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:08.770]  like sin stands for superseding the intentions of nature.
[01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:14.450]  So, like, so we are replacing the intentions of nature
[01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:19.330]  so with artificial instead of organic
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:23.250]  or fertilizers instead of organic matter
[01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.450]  or pills instead of herbs
[01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:29.890]  and sterile instead of biodiverse.
[01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:34.330]  And that's why this like paradigm of sterility
[01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:39.330]  and sterile is better is so detrimental to our existence.
[01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:43.530]  And I think the chemical industry
[01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:47.010]  like exploits our fear of microbes
[01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:50.130]  and the past story and view,
[01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:54.730]  teaches that microbes are dangerous and detrimental.
[01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:59.290]  And like our bodies are just like these defenseless
[01:28:59.290 --> 01:29:02.010]  organisms just like waiting to be attacked
[01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.730]  by like these invisible things.
[01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:09.490]  And when it's like, really,
[01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:13.810]  it's like, it's the reality weakens us
[01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:17.210]  and biodiversity strengthens us.
[01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:19.970]  And, you know, we have to stop sanitizing
[01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.290]  and start inoculating.
[01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:26.050]  And another thing that Zach Bush says is that,
[01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:29.130]  you know, what we're seeing here is
[01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:35.370]  of people who are disconnected from nature
[01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.850]  and that nature being the microbiome.
[01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:39.890]  Alexa.
[01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.890]  Thank you.
[01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:45.490]  Thank you.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:47.770]  Absolutely, my pleasure.
[01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:53.410]  So yeah, that's what I'm really about is,
[01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:57.050]  you know, educating on the microbiome
[01:29:57.050 --> 01:30:00.810]  and kind of just getting people to understand
[01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:05.250]  that like we're just so much more than like this human
[01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:10.250]  we're like, you know, this complex ecosystem of organisms.
[01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.250]  We are our biology.
[01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.090]  Yes.
[01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:22.170]  So that is honestly that realization, you know,
[01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:25.330]  cause honestly I used to be like,
[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:28.970]  I have not always been into soil or dirt or anything.
[01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:31.130]  Like I grew up a very,
[01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:34.570]  what I call kind of like a sterile life, you know,
[01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:39.810]  just typical girl stuff, like makeup, shopping,
[01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:43.770]  like definitely not into soil or anything like that.
[01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:48.890]  So it's just funny, like, you know,
[01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:50.410]  getting your hands in the dirt,
[01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:55.170]  like really changed my life as far as like understanding,
[01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.130]  like my place in this world and my purpose
[01:30:58.130 --> 01:31:02.890]  and like my Dharma and my connection here.
[01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:08.490]  Yeah. And it's nice to have a, like a hobby or something,
[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.850]  whatever interest in where you're starting to notice
[01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:11.930]  that things are improving.
[01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:14.050]  So it's like, wow, I learned how to make this input
[01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:18.370]  or amendment or new to use that at the right time.
[01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:21.050]  And, you know, my plants look fantastic.
[01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:24.650]  And that's why I personally, you know,
[01:31:24.650 --> 01:31:26.810]  my crusade has always kind of been with living soil
[01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:30.290]  is I think when people drink the Kool-Aid, if you will,
[01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:33.410]  it's really hard not to sip on it anymore
[01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:34.810]  because it is so much easier.
[01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:37.530]  And when things improve, I don't know,
[01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.010]  it's hard not to tell somebody else,
[01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:40.050]  especially if they're farming
[01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:43.410]  and they're farming in a different fashion.
[01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:45.290]  There's a, awesome.
[01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:50.290]  Yeah. There's just so many different ways to farm cannabis,
[01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:52.970]  but at the beginning of things,
[01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:54.650]  if you can kind of go down this road,
[01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:58.370]  that's what I try to push individuals a little bit on that.
[01:31:58.370 --> 01:32:01.610]  Cause I think they're going to find more success that way,
[01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:05.210]  potentially not even have flips that aren't successful,
[01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:07.650]  which I don't know if you,
[01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:09.530]  I don't know if you tried that in Colorado or something,
[01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:10.370]  but, you know,
[01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:14.050]  happen to pay the Excel bill when things didn't work out,
[01:32:14.050 --> 01:32:15.370]  that's a kick in the gut, you know,
[01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:17.250]  especially if you're first starting out with things
[01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.490]  and not having successful flips alone.
[01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:22.210]  Nobody, I don't think there's ever been a cannabis farmer
[01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:24.530]  starting out that thought that they were going to,
[01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:27.410]  you know, really have trouble at the beginning,
[01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:29.610]  or maybe I was just naive at the beginning.
[01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:32.330]  We thought that, Hey, we're smart enough.
[01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:33.370]  We can figure this out.
[01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:36.770]  And we were smart enough to, to grow mids, you know,
[01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:39.250]  and that's, that wasn't cutting it.
[01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:42.770]  So living soil, understanding the microbial life.
[01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:44.550]  Again, you could take this,
[01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.850]  if you were growing flowers for weddings and stuff,
[01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:49.170]  just have more vibrant colors.
[01:32:49.170 --> 01:32:51.150]  This soil system doesn't necessarily have to be
[01:32:51.150 --> 01:32:52.690]  about cannabis.
[01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.770]  It just seems like the people that are in our circle
[01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:59.370]  and the ones that really love growing plants to me
[01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.970]  have always kind of been the cannabis individuals,
[01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:04.450]  always turning me on to,
[01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:05.810]  that's how I heard about like the,
[01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:08.090]  the sundews and the pitcher plants and things.
[01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:09.330]  You know, we talked about that yesterday.
[01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:12.570]  I've just now, instead of buying the sticky traps,
[01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:15.610]  let's use carnivorous plants to really take it
[01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:19.170]  to another level of as best we can in an indoor environment,
[01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:22.210]  tent environment to try to grow and replicate things
[01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:23.110]  in mother nature.
[01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:25.130]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:25.130 --> 01:33:28.810]  Like cannabis plant, it's crazy because
[01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:32.290]  it's been the catalyst for me learning
[01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.450]  about regenerative farming.
[01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:38.770]  And it just seems like that cannabis is kind of
[01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:42.770]  in the regenerative community here in Michigan anyways.
[01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:44.690]  It's like part of, you know,
[01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:48.490]  the fabric that kind of like weaves us all together.
[01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:52.330]  We all, you know, very much enjoy, you know,
[01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:55.250]  growing cannabis and that has kind of like
[01:33:56.010 --> 01:34:01.210]  led us to getting our hands in the dirt
[01:34:01.210 --> 01:34:04.650]  and, you know, improving cultivation.
[01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:08.890]  And yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:12.610]  No, we're definitely all improving cultivation as a group.
[01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:15.650]  Instead of somebody passing out a pamphlet
[01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.130]  where it's like, all right, week by week,
[01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:19.470]  use, you know, here's our company logo.
[01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:21.170]  This is what we say.
[01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:22.010]  Sure.
[01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:23.290]  Another brand's like, no, no, no.
[01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.930]  You need more potassium.
[01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:27.370]  You need a bloom bomb and all that.
[01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.810]  Now it's more just, all right,
[01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:30.730]  if you're focused on growing good cannabis,
[01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:33.010]  then you need to kind of, you know,
[01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:35.450]  at least have an understanding of the soil food web
[01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:38.290]  that direction and then taking it to another level,
[01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:40.450]  I think is then learning more about
[01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:42.890]  natural farming techniques and Chidam.
[01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:44.210]  So there's always something to learn
[01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:46.470]  and then learning more about aquatics.
[01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:49.290]  You know, just taking samples from that.
[01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:51.890]  And then I think, you know, our goal,
[01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:53.250]  I know Leighton and I,
[01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:55.570]  we like to interview a variety of different people
[01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:58.650]  so that individuals can kind of take from
[01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:01.530]  so many different people instead of there's almost,
[01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:02.450]  at least for a while there,
[01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:04.610]  it felt like there was a very cultish view
[01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.410]  with some points where it was like,
[01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:07.530]  all right, if you believe that,
[01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:12.090]  then you're not a diehard Dr. Laningham disciple.
[01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:14.530]  Or if you believe this system,
[01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:16.610]  then, you know, Chris Trump would yell at you, you know?
[01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:19.810]  So yeah, there's just a lot of things.
[01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:23.050]  And again, diversity in your education is paramount
[01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:24.970]  because I don't think anybody should believe
[01:35:24.970 --> 01:35:26.810]  just one person's viewpoint.
[01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:29.210]  Yeah.
[01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:30.090]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:30.090 --> 01:35:32.050]  That's what I always, you know,
[01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:33.290]  that's what I've come to too,
[01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:38.290]  especially after kind of overcoming the notion of
[01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:40.970]  anaerobic bad, aerobic good,
[01:35:41.890 --> 01:35:45.390]  overcoming that and seeing the benefits of,
[01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:49.210]  you know, anaerobic organisms in soil systems.
[01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:54.210]  And yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:58.450]  And there's still, I mean, there's still-
[01:35:58.450 --> 01:36:01.570]  There's still lots there.
[01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:03.090]  I appreciate that.
[01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.170]  Yeah.
[01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:09.130]  I mean, you know, life is passing by pretty quick,
[01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.970]  you know, I mean, especially doing these shows
[01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:13.290]  is like week by week by week.
[01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:14.970]  But as these things have gone by,
[01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:16.930]  it's more and more individuals are trying things.
[01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:19.490]  More and more individuals are now getting into IMO.
[01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:21.490]  And for me, it's like the last little hurrah,
[01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.250]  I feel like where I can have an impact
[01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:24.410]  and kind of give an extra like,
[01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:27.130]  fuck you to the Monsanto world.
[01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:29.130]  I was like, well, you can't stop individuals
[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:30.610]  that want to continue to learn.
[01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:32.410]  And once you understand this stuff,
[01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:37.650]  it almost seems comical that the way that our view,
[01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.890]  the world has grown, the way that food has grown,
[01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:44.130]  where that, you know, the entity has taken hold
[01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.510]  and you need this and these are our recipes
[01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:49.670]  compared to just the way natural farming is,
[01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.510]  living soil is,
[01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:53.310]  we're just kind of really focused on mother nature.
[01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:54.550]  It's a drastic difference.
[01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:55.630]  The minerals are there.
[01:36:55.630 --> 01:36:59.310]  You know, you're seeing it on a microscopic level.
[01:36:59.310 --> 01:37:02.510]  And, you know, you don't even need all those skill sets
[01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:05.110]  to notice that after a little bit, you know,
[01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:09.390]  you start to see praying leaves with cannabis plants,
[01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:13.070]  you know, in a hydroponic setup, at least at the time,
[01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.230]  only the elite farmers were achieving that
[01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.350]  on a hydroponic setup.
[01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:18.870]  I mean, that was extremely hard to do
[01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:20.630]  where with a living soil system,
[01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:22.270]  people were achieving that, you know,
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:23.470]  it might be their first year,
[01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:26.150]  but they were just dialing in the system,
[01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:27.710]  spraying Epsom salts and stuff
[01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:30.190]  that really helped to improve uptake,
[01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:32.410]  calcium uptake, magnesium.
[01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:33.630]  So little things like that.
[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:35.150]  And now here we are, you know,
[01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:37.230]  there's a variety of different podcasts.
[01:37:37.230 --> 01:37:41.710]  People are, I think, just so excited to talk about cannabis
[01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:42.870]  and soil.
[01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:46.330]  And I saw that you guys call yourself compost soil nerds.
[01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:48.610]  It's just people that are really into it.
[01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:50.530]  And that's kind of been the goal.
[01:37:50.530 --> 01:37:52.490]  I know when Leighton and I were discussing this
[01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:56.090]  before, you know, officially doing it and everything is,
[01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:59.250]  how can we get individuals that would want to continue
[01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.370]  to go down this road?
[01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:03.650]  And I think just the fulfillment of improving things
[01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:06.330]  is really what gets people, you know, the bug,
[01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:08.450]  where they just can't stop learning after that,
[01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:10.610]  because, well, now I have this skill set,
[01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:12.490]  especially if you're farming for, you know,
[01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:13.930]  to take care of your family.
[01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:15.850]  A few skill sets and now all of a sudden,
[01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:18.650]  my product is dramatically improved.
[01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:20.650]  Again, people are, you know,
[01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:23.370]  more than willing to prepay you for something.
[01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.890]  That's when you obviously know like,
[01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:28.190]  hey, whatever route it took me to finally get to this road,
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:30.690]  this road is going to take me to success.
[01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:33.250]  And again, it all comes down to the microbial world.
[01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:36.810]  And I hope more individuals also see that just life success
[01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:39.930]  and being healthy also comes from the microbiome
[01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:41.170]  in your gut.
[01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:44.350]  So focus on those two things and life is pretty sweet.
[01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:47.310]  Yeah, pretty simple after that.
[01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:51.150]  Yeah, composting, I always like to say,
[01:38:51.150 --> 01:38:54.830]  composting is empowerment, you know?
[01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:57.670]  It seems as if, you know,
[01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:02.670]  the reason I got into composting is because, you know,
[01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:04.310]  when you fix the soil,
[01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:08.270]  it kind of seems like every other aspect of life
[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:11.530]  kind of just falls into place as well.
[01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:14.370]  So like when we improve soil health,
[01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:19.370]  we're also improving plant health and thus human health,
[01:39:19.730 --> 01:39:22.810]  because when the plants that we're eating are healthy
[01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:25.210]  and nutrient dense, then, you know,
[01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:28.610]  we are getting those nutrients and we are healthy as well.
[01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:33.610]  So yeah, that's definitely why I kind of came into
[01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:40.570]  composting because it just seemed like the best way
[01:39:41.170 --> 01:39:46.170]  to help all these different facets of society
[01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:51.810]  that, you know, are experiencing problems right now
[01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.890]  from human activities.
[01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:58.890]  And one thing I wanted to say too is that, yeah,
[01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:05.170]  like we, you know, I kind of now,
[01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:06.530]  this is what I was gonna say earlier
[01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.090]  about the anaerobic aerobic thing.
[01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:09.930]  Like after that experience,
[01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:12.490]  I kind of take everything with, you know,
[01:40:12.490 --> 01:40:15.210]  a grain of salt and, you know,
[01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:17.210]  take in that information definitely,
[01:40:17.210 --> 01:40:20.730]  but just see how it works for you
[01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:24.810]  in your specific situation and, you know,
[01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:27.170]  take these ideas, take these recipes
[01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:29.050]  and always make them your own,
[01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:32.010]  because, you know, nature's always changing.
[01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:35.090]  Nature's always different and adapting.
[01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:39.250]  So it's always gonna be based off your unique situation
[01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:42.370]  and goals, like what you're doing.
[01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:46.690]  So these recipes that are out there, they're very important,
[01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:50.890]  but to follow the recipe exactly how it says,
[01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:52.770]  I don't ever do that.
[01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:53.890]  Let's put it that way.
[01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:57.690]  Well, and to be fair, I mean, you could follow it to a T.
[01:40:57.690 --> 01:40:58.690]  You got recipes made,
[01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.810]  you got all your raised beds dialed in
[01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:04.650]  and still each one of those is its own little utopia
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:06.810]  and you're not going to see the same success
[01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:08.010]  in each one of those.
[01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:11.530]  That's why understanding living soil from A to Z
[01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:13.130]  is recommended from us,
[01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:16.130]  because it's more of being able to understand
[01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:17.690]  what things or potentials are coming.
[01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:20.770]  You know, IPM to me is how a cannabis farmer
[01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.730]  really earns their income at the end of the day.
[01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:25.610]  It's because you're protecting the investment that,
[01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:29.850]  you know, a lot of money goes into farming cannabis.
[01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.770]  And we always like to say like the suits
[01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:33.810]  just don't really understand a lot of that stuff.
[01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:35.690]  So they'll put money into things
[01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:36.890]  that they feel is important,
[01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:37.730]  but at the end of the day,
[01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:40.530]  they don't want to buy beneficials to protect the product,
[01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:43.650]  you know, or they're asking to do things
[01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:46.130]  that the company was saying was immoral
[01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:48.930]  because, you know, they want to make things easier
[01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:50.050]  for the team.
[01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:53.130]  And like you had said, I think getting into this,
[01:41:53.130 --> 01:41:55.250]  you got to realize that it's kind of a bucking horse
[01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:56.170]  at first.
[01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.410]  Yes, if you have the ultimate utopia
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:00.570]  when you first start out, you know,
[01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:02.010]  I'm not saying that can't be achieved,
[01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:04.010]  but you know, you're an outlier in that moment.
[01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:06.450]  A lot of us have issues and problems
[01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:09.850]  and sometimes even deficiencies first getting into this,
[01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:14.010]  but know that those issues are small learning curve.
[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:15.770]  And once you're over that hump,
[01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:17.890]  a lot of stuff is going to get easier for you.
[01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:21.770]  You're going to see potential deficiencies beforehand.
[01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:23.210]  You're going to realize that, okay,
[01:42:23.210 --> 01:42:26.050]  I just need to continue to add diversity
[01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:28.210]  and sit back and kind of, again,
[01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:31.690]  just manage that system instead of being overbearing,
[01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:34.170]  be a chilled, laid back parent
[01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:36.810]  and your plants are going to grow up healthier
[01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:39.490]  than you smothering them all the time.
[01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:42.790]  Yeah, I mean, that's what all these regenerative approaches
[01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:43.890]  are about, right?
[01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:46.370]  It's just kind of how can we take a step back
[01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:48.350]  and let nature take over?
[01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:51.890]  Yeah, and then when we're indoors, you know,
[01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:55.050]  we find ways to improve on mother nature or things
[01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:57.490]  because we all would love to farm outdoors,
[01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.250]  but you know, especially with cannabis,
[01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.130]  how do you protect that other than getting
[01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:04.170]  into ridiculousness, you know,
[01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:06.610]  walking around with AK-47s and stuff, you know?
[01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:09.050]  I mean, that's, I mean, how realistic is that?
[01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:10.210]  Especially as a company, I mean,
[01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:11.890]  is that what you want your image to be?
[01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:15.010]  So that's why most individuals here in Colorado
[01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:18.970]  either do that down in Pueblo or grow indoors,
[01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:21.250]  you know, here in Denver.
[01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:22.850]  There's really no option to that.
[01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:25.410]  And I think at the end of the day,
[01:43:25.410 --> 01:43:28.810]  I'd rather see people be able to farm cannabis than not.
[01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:32.730]  So I know the regenerative side hates the fact that,
[01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:35.330]  you know, still most of us are growing indoors,
[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:39.050]  but I mean, that's, what are you gonna do, man?
[01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:41.330]  I mean, that's where they're letting it happen.
[01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:43.450]  So that's, I think that's way better
[01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.330]  than everything being illegal.
[01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:46.730]  Totally, 100%.
[01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:49.010]  Like we would not be able to,
[01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:50.890]  we live in Northern Michigan, you know,
[01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:53.850]  so we would not be able to grow here.
[01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:56.130]  The season's just simply not long enough.
[01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:58.010]  I mean, some people do and they make it work,
[01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:01.410]  but it seems hard.
[01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:03.130]  And to get that quality flour,
[01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:05.090]  like we wanna actually be able to, you know,
[01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:07.890]  sell the flour and not just make like a distillate
[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:09.090]  or something out of it.
[01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:14.090]  So, but yeah, as far as like just getting into living soil,
[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:20.850]  like advice for people is just like 100%,
[01:44:20.850 --> 01:44:23.370]  like look into the soil food web.
[01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:28.370]  Like I came in with no understanding of the soil food web
[01:44:29.050 --> 01:44:34.050]  and just a completely like amendment chemistry mindset
[01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:35.250]  of things.
[01:44:35.250 --> 01:44:40.250]  And ultimately once we had a balance
[01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:43.570]  of both biology and chemistry,
[01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:46.530]  that's when things started to actually work.
[01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:48.930]  So, you know, what we're doing at HIFA
[01:44:48.930 --> 01:44:53.170]  is just recreating outdoors, indoors.
[01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:56.170]  As best as we can.
[01:44:57.690 --> 01:44:59.570]  Yeah, that's really where it's at.
[01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:01.890]  And you know, some people feel certain ways about it,
[01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:04.530]  but you know, at least you're farming that way.
[01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:07.970]  You know, I mean, if you got to farm indoors,
[01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:12.970]  I think indoor regenerative farming, if that's a thing,
[01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.490]  is the way to go.
[01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:18.770]  And again, you're gonna pick from the mentors
[01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.050]  that you've learned from.
[01:45:20.050 --> 01:45:21.930]  And as long as you continue to improve
[01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:23.650]  and don't pigeonhole yourself and feel like,
[01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.570]  oh, I understand everything.
[01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:29.090]  Cause I do see that from farmers time to time.
[01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:30.850]  But what is cool is the younger ones
[01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:33.610]  seem to not be in the dogma of,
[01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:34.850]  I've done this for 20 years
[01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:37.770]  and this is how I'm gonna continue to do things
[01:45:37.770 --> 01:45:41.130]  because their cannabis just doesn't look as good anymore.
[01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:42.890]  I have to interrupt just for a second.
[01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:45.250]  My internet keeps cutting out guys.
[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:48.410]  So I'm gonna probably end up being gone
[01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:50.330]  cause I'm in a really bad storm.
[01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:52.930]  So I just, Alexa, I wanted to say thank you so much.
[01:45:52.930 --> 01:45:54.250]  It's been a real pleasure.
[01:45:54.250 --> 01:45:55.890]  If I cut out all of a sudden,
[01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:00.090]  but I just wanted to say thank you very much.
[01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:01.930]  Thank you, much love.
[01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:05.490]  Yeah, it's kind of crazy to sit, you know,
[01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:07.210]  I'm in my office right here, you know,
[01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:10.010]  and you're obviously in your home and he's in Canada
[01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:13.410]  and we're sitting here having a conversation about cannabis.
[01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:17.690]  I guess it's doing so much, it's not a big of a deal,
[01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:19.450]  but now it's, I don't know, man.
[01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:22.210]  It's just cool to see that, especially last week,
[01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:23.770]  interviewing somebody from the UK
[01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:26.050]  and them discussing living soil
[01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:27.290]  and having a different viewpoint
[01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:29.370]  than some of us here in the States.
[01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:32.130]  That's what I'm open to is dialogue.
[01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:34.610]  Like I don't necessarily want my friends
[01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:37.010]  to have the same belief system I have.
[01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:38.250]  And that's pretty weird.
[01:46:38.250 --> 01:46:40.970]  I think they call that yes, man, yes, women, you know,
[01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:42.050]  nobody wants that around you
[01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:44.370]  where everything you say, everybody agrees with.
[01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:47.210]  And for a while there, it felt like that was parts
[01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.410]  of the soil food web and the living soil
[01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.410]  and natural farming where,
[01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:53.330]  well, that's not what this individual said.
[01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:56.250]  So why are you even experimenting with that?
[01:46:56.250 --> 01:47:00.170]  And now it seems like the masses are just kind of past that
[01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:03.370]  and everybody's experimenting with a variety of things.
[01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:05.330]  It's really cool to see.
[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:07.450]  Yeah, I definitely agree.
[01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:10.210]  Like the show, like, you know,
[01:47:10.210 --> 01:47:12.730]  I've been a huge fan of this show for a while
[01:47:12.730 --> 01:47:15.210]  and it's definitely been, you know,
[01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:18.130]  a huge benefit on my living soil journey.
[01:47:18.130 --> 01:47:20.410]  So, I mean, thank you so much.
[01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:25.130]  Like it's had a huge impact, you know, on my growth.
[01:47:25.130 --> 01:47:29.010]  And I know for sure the growth and the progress
[01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:31.730]  of the living soil community as well,
[01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:33.010]  because, you know, like you said,
[01:47:33.010 --> 01:47:35.810]  when we're all able to share all of the different things
[01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:38.250]  that we're working on, then it,
[01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:43.730]  our knowledge just grows exponentially.
[01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:48.170]  Yeah, and it's, I feel like a gift that, you know,
[01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:50.530]  the suits can't steal from the community,
[01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:52.570]  you know, education.
[01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:54.890]  So the more individuals that have that education,
[01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:57.930]  the more they're just gonna have to listen to the hoodies
[01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:01.010]  because they're the ones growing the really good weed.
[01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:04.250]  And, you know, shout out to like Green Life and Josh
[01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:07.130]  and the people that I've admired.
[01:48:07.130 --> 01:48:09.570]  I mean, they're taking care of their families,
[01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:12.290]  but at the same time, just being real to who they are,
[01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:14.250]  continuing to improve things.
[01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:15.610]  Like you had mentioned, you know,
[01:48:15.610 --> 01:48:18.610]  Steve's view on not even disturbing the soil
[01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:20.570]  from a raised bed, where we went from just
[01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:22.090]  kind of like a no-till approach,
[01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:25.090]  just continuing to understand that soil system
[01:48:25.090 --> 01:48:27.810]  and realize that less is more with this.
[01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:29.770]  And once things are churning, it's like,
[01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:32.610]  why even disturb the soil at all?
[01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:34.130]  Let's just plant the shit on top,
[01:48:34.130 --> 01:48:35.890]  the roots come through, you know?
[01:48:35.890 --> 01:48:38.210]  It's just, I love to see the progression.
[01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:40.130]  I love to see younger individuals
[01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:42.690]  that can grow the cannabis themselves,
[01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:45.570]  but also wash the cannabis themselves,
[01:48:45.570 --> 01:48:47.010]  squish the cannabis themselves.
[01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:49.450]  I just really admire that,
[01:48:49.450 --> 01:48:51.450]  because that is a skillset that,
[01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:53.410]  I mean, you could live anywhere and be able to do that.
[01:48:53.410 --> 01:48:55.810]  And, you know, it's a cool thing.
[01:48:55.810 --> 01:49:00.450]  And I know that this show is now allowing more individuals
[01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:04.450]  to do that and achieve that by using less money
[01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:08.090]  out of their family's pocket to achieve better results,
[01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:11.130]  which at the beginning sounded too good to be true.
[01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:12.930]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:15.450]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:18.930]  And something you said earlier too,
[01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:23.930]  is not getting stuck in thinking that we know everything
[01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:28.410]  and just continuing to learn.
[01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:33.410]  And something that Socrates said is that wisdom
[01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:39.370]  is knowing how little you know.
[01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:41.410]  So I think at the end of the day,
[01:49:41.410 --> 01:49:44.450]  it's important for all of us to realize
[01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:47.450]  that we don't really know shit
[01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:51.610]  about the microbial universe or the soil.
[01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:53.170]  You know, in the Jadam book,
[01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:56.410]  it says that, you know, you can only culture
[01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:59.490]  like 1% of microbes in a lab setting.
[01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:04.530]  So that's why I always like question,
[01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:08.130]  like these decisions that we're making
[01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:11.770]  on our biological health from studies
[01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:16.410]  that are based on like in vitro experiments,
[01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:20.490]  because, you know, we know nature's like ever adapting
[01:50:20.490 --> 01:50:23.250]  and changing and-
[01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:24.690]  That's why we need Layton today,
[01:50:24.690 --> 01:50:27.890]  because we would have a nice little rant on that.
[01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:29.130]  I know, my gosh.
[01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:31.450]  And I wanted to talk about viruses too.
[01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:34.610]  I got some stuff on viruses I wanted to get on.
[01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:38.730]  Well, you know, again, buddy,
[01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:39.970]  shout out to you Layton.
[01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:41.370]  I know that you're hurting obviously,
[01:50:41.370 --> 01:50:43.010]  because you haven't missed one of these yet.
[01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:45.490]  So it's gotta be something.
[01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:47.970]  We hope that you heal as quick as you said
[01:50:47.970 --> 01:50:49.090]  that you probably can.
[01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:56.530]  And also for Jet House has confirmed
[01:50:57.530 --> 01:51:01.250]  ready to go anytime, like next week.
[01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:04.410]  As far as what?
[01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:05.250]  Like with you.
[01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:06.090]  Oh, for the show?
[01:51:06.090 --> 01:51:07.010]  The crew.
[01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:13.290]  I think he's saying to have you and Jet House on it.
[01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:14.450]  Oh!
[01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:15.730]  A back to back episode.
[01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:17.450]  That would be fantastic.
[01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:18.570]  I would love that.
[01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:21.890]  Hell yeah.
[01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:24.850]  The composting crew.
[01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:27.170]  Yes, I love that.
[01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:29.850]  Oh yeah, Chandler has just been, gosh,
[01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:31.370]  so huge on my journey.
[01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:34.770]  Like he has helped me connect so many dots
[01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:38.450]  and wow, like just so grateful for him.
[01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:40.970]  And that's what I mean.
[01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:44.170]  Like that's a gift that no one can ever take from you.
[01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:47.050]  You are the person that decides who you continue to.
[01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:49.370]  And I hope that individuals pass that on.
[01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:51.050]  And we kind of joke on the show, Alexa,
[01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:54.290]  that I hope that you give it to the community for free.
[01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:56.290]  And I hope you charge the shit out of the suits
[01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:57.610]  for the same information.
[01:51:58.610 --> 01:52:02.490]  Because it's kind of the, I don't know,
[01:52:02.490 --> 01:52:04.970]  without this community and without Living Soil
[01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:05.810]  and without this stuff,
[01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:07.450]  I think that a lot of this information
[01:52:07.450 --> 01:52:10.610]  would continue to be suppressed.
[01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:12.730]  Who the hell wants to understand
[01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:14.850]  to farm cannabis for less?
[01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:20.850]  Again, it was hard to convince the decision makers
[01:52:20.850 --> 01:52:23.650]  because it really does sound too good to be true
[01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:26.530]  when they're buying soil, bagged soil.
[01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:28.810]  You know, we weren't even buying it at like a wholesale price
[01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:30.770]  we were paying for bagged soil,
[01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:32.610]  dumping it in and filling up the things
[01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:35.770]  and dumping everything out, paying to have it disposed.
[01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:38.610]  Yeah, Jethouse rocks, man.
[01:52:38.610 --> 01:52:41.210]  I really, like I said, I spent my own money.
[01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:45.050]  I think it says something about, you know,
[01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:48.250]  people when they use their money almost as a vote as well,
[01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:49.490]  you know, kind of going out of there
[01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:51.290]  and supporting individuals.
[01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:53.570]  And that's what I always like to do as well
[01:52:54.450 --> 01:52:55.450]  is to try to support the community.
[01:52:55.450 --> 01:52:57.730]  There's probably somebody within our cannabis community
[01:52:57.730 --> 01:53:00.290]  that you can buy most of those amendments from,
[01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:02.610]  or, you know, seems like everybody's getting
[01:53:02.610 --> 01:53:04.250]  into the K and F stuff.
[01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:06.010]  So, you know, pick your favorite.
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:08.290]  It's almost like pick your favorite character for battle.
[01:53:08.290 --> 01:53:10.370]  You know, they all have different attributes.
[01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.970]  They all have strengths that are unique to them.
[01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:15.850]  So yeah, just kind of do your research.
[01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:19.170]  Oh God, that's a good way to put it.
[01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:20.130]  And it's all different.
[01:53:20.130 --> 01:53:21.690]  I mean, all their products, you know,
[01:53:21.690 --> 01:53:24.730]  it's all kind of, you know, if it's a cake, you know,
[01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:26.690]  everybody's cooking the cake just a little bit different.
[01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:30.570]  So, you know, try them all if budget allows,
[01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.610]  or, you know, try one and see what you think.
[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:34.690]  But as Leighton always kind of talks about too,
[01:53:34.690 --> 01:53:37.730]  when you're trying to improve your soil systems,
[01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:39.050]  that's a slow process.
[01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:41.090]  You want to know what really made a difference.
[01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:43.530]  And that was something that our group never understood.
[01:53:43.530 --> 01:53:45.890]  You know, we would add four or five different things
[01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:47.850]  and then some things would be success.
[01:53:47.850 --> 01:53:49.850]  And we'd have no idea what the hell, you know,
[01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:51.130]  we did to improve it.
[01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:53.930]  Looking back now, it's foiler feeding
[01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:55.690]  with Epsom salts and yucca extract.
[01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:57.490]  I mean, how cheap is that?
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:59.410]  You know, putting it in a mister
[01:53:59.410 --> 01:54:01.370]  and kind of spraying the room.
[01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:03.490]  So there's a lot of tips and tricks and stuff,
[01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:06.330]  but focusing on the soil system,
[01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:08.450]  yes, it's great to spray your plants,
[01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:10.690]  but a healthy soil system
[01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:13.650]  with a nice foiler feed every now and then
[01:54:13.650 --> 01:54:17.330]  seem to be the ticket to success for us as well.
[01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:18.610]  Hmm.
[01:54:19.570 --> 01:54:20.850]  Totally.
[01:54:20.850 --> 01:54:22.570]  So I kind of want to talk more, you know,
[01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:23.650]  you'd mentioned Colin,
[01:54:23.650 --> 01:54:26.490]  he's definitely a stable here in Colorado.
[01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:28.410]  People grow his genetics.
[01:54:28.410 --> 01:54:30.770]  So he has a reputation too.
[01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:33.930]  So the fact that you were under his wing kind of says a lot,
[01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:36.250]  you know, he must've seen something in you.
[01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:38.450]  And I was kind of wanting to pick your brain on that.
[01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:41.130]  Like you said, you were pheno hunting for him.
[01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:42.890]  He's definitely known, you know,
[01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:44.010]  one of the guys that's known
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.530]  for just pumping out a variety of genetics.
[01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:49.210]  I was wondering how he's able to achieve that
[01:54:49.210 --> 01:54:51.210]  and how, you know, what were some of the things
[01:54:51.210 --> 01:54:53.330]  that you took away from that experience?
[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:54.170]  Wow. Yeah.
[01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:56.170]  I mean, fricking Colin,
[01:54:56.170 --> 01:54:59.370]  he really helped me out of a bad situation.
[01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:00.690]  That's for sure.
[01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:05.690]  And yeah, took me under his wing and taught me how to grow.
[01:55:06.170 --> 01:55:11.170]  And, you know, he hadn't even,
[01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:12.810]  when I met him,
[01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:17.810]  Ethos was still kind of like in like the very birthing
[01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:21.650]  stages of the company.
[01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:25.850]  And it wasn't even Ethos genetics yet, you know,
[01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:28.850]  I would help him with like consulting for other,
[01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:32.970]  you know, grows and, you know,
[01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:35.930]  got to see a lot from doing that as well.
[01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:40.930]  And then I started, and then, yeah,
[01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:45.970]  we started doing a pheno hunts and he came out with the,
[01:55:45.970 --> 01:55:50.370]  the Ethos genetics and he had been collecting genetics
[01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:53.250]  for a very long time.
[01:55:53.250 --> 01:55:58.050]  And, you know, everything that he was,
[01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:00.810]  I was growing was like the most incredible thing
[01:56:00.810 --> 01:56:01.650]  I'd ever seen.
[01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:02.490]  You know what I mean?
[01:56:02.490 --> 01:56:05.170]  Like I was growing cannabis before I met Colin
[01:56:05.170 --> 01:56:07.410]  and like all of his genetics and everything
[01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:09.330]  was just like completely next level,
[01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:11.930]  like out of this world, things that I've never seen before.
[01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:13.410]  So I was like, wow, you know,
[01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:16.450]  he's really onto something here, you know?
[01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:21.450]  And yeah, just really the company just like grew
[01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:25.170]  and exploded like very quickly.
[01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:30.170]  And I started also, I would do like sales for them as well.
[01:56:31.090 --> 01:56:33.290]  So like go to different like cannabis cops
[01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:35.730]  and sell seed packs.
[01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:38.610]  And I might be doing that again this year,
[01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:41.370]  which is super exciting too actually.
[01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:46.370]  So doing some shows for Ethos at future events around.
[01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:52.210]  But yeah, I don't know, I guess,
[01:56:52.210 --> 01:56:53.930]  man, I just got really lucky.
[01:56:55.570 --> 01:56:59.290]  Now he kind of also pioneered something called
[01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:00.570]  alpha feminized.
[01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:03.010]  I hope I'm saying that correctly.
[01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:04.810]  Are you familiar with what that is?
[01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:06.210]  I always was kind of wondering.
[01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:07.490]  What made that different?
[01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:10.170]  I honestly don't know if I'm supposed to talk about it.
[01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:11.010]  Oh, okay.
[01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:12.250]  I honestly don't know.
[01:57:15.170 --> 01:57:18.010]  We just recently connected again after like years
[01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:23.010]  of not being in communication.
[01:57:23.090 --> 01:57:27.290]  So I just don't wanna say anything
[01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:29.490]  that I'm not supposed to.
[01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:30.610]  Yeah, fair enough.
[01:57:31.450 --> 01:57:33.490]  So for the viewers, like if you wanna kind of,
[01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:36.370]  I'm sure he's talked about it on somebody's podcast
[01:57:36.370 --> 01:57:37.210]  or something, but yeah,
[01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:42.090]  he's kind of pioneered something called alpha feminized
[01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:44.250]  and something that was kind of unique.
[01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:47.530]  I was fortunate enough to hear him speak on it briefly.
[01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:50.890]  He used to help Denver Normal when that was around
[01:57:50.890 --> 01:57:53.290]  and kind of help with like their events and stuff
[01:57:53.290 --> 01:57:55.530]  and talk about cool things,
[01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:59.370]  even like de-degradation and things that,
[01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:00.930]  especially at that time,
[01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:02.810]  Colin was breaking down for the community,
[01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:03.930]  which I thought was pretty cool.
[01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.890]  And his response to that was,
[01:58:05.890 --> 01:58:08.250]  you're growing a plant that should die
[01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:09.730]  and you're keeping that shit alive.
[01:58:09.730 --> 01:58:14.730]  Like, why don't you think that thing is having issues?
[01:58:15.970 --> 01:58:17.290]  And it always kind of made sense
[01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:20.850]  because maybe just even a couple of years before that,
[01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.690]  everybody was still really big on keeping their moms
[01:58:23.690 --> 01:58:24.890]  and almost like bragging,
[01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:27.450]  like, yeah, I've had this mom for five years.
[01:58:27.450 --> 01:58:30.210]  And then when we grow the clones out and stuff,
[01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:32.450]  it just didn't have that vigor
[01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:36.130]  that it seemed to the hype probably should have warranted.
[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:40.690]  And so, yeah, he's definitely pioneered a lot of that stuff
[01:58:40.690 --> 01:58:43.210]  and hats off to him for getting,
[01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:45.530]  I think like his community grows.
[01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:48.570]  That's how he's able to put all those different phenos out.
[01:58:48.570 --> 01:58:50.090]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:53.410]  You know, honestly,
[01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:57.210]  just some interesting things that I've noticed
[01:58:57.250 --> 01:59:02.250]  about cannabis genetics from now having to test
[01:59:02.610 --> 01:59:07.330]  all the different phenos that, you know,
[01:59:07.330 --> 01:59:10.170]  we're pheno hunting at the grow
[01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:15.170]  and finding those strains that hit all the boxes
[01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:18.850]  is like pretty much like impossible.
[01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:23.850]  Like I'm honestly shocked on how few and far between
[01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:29.090]  like high testing THC strains, you know, there are.
[01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:31.650]  Like, it almost seems like there's,
[01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:33.930]  it's like a genetic mutation or something.
[01:59:33.930 --> 01:59:35.570]  Like, it's really just not common.
[01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:38.970]  Like, I don't know if anyone else has like seen that as well,
[01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:41.090]  but like you can pop a hundred seeds
[01:59:41.090 --> 01:59:46.090]  and maybe like two of them will have like THC above 20%.
[01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:51.130]  I don't like, so it's just really interesting to me.
[01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:52.450]  Like, and it's funny too,
[01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:55.890]  because like the things that some of the strains
[01:59:55.890 --> 01:59:59.010]  like that smell like incredible
[01:59:59.010 --> 02:00:01.930]  will test really low on terpenes too.
[02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:03.690]  And then it just like blows your mind.
[02:00:03.690 --> 02:00:05.930]  You're like, how is this even possible?
[02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:07.850]  This smells so good.
[02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:10.930]  So, you know, that's something that I, at HIFA,
[02:00:10.930 --> 02:00:14.650]  you know, we're still figuring things out as far as that,
[02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:16.290]  but it's just really interesting.
[02:00:16.290 --> 02:00:18.690]  And I'd like to talk to someone else maybe who has,
[02:00:18.690 --> 02:00:21.970]  you know, more experience with that
[02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:24.570]  because it just seems like,
[02:00:24.570 --> 02:00:27.490]  and like in the past, for example,
[02:00:27.490 --> 02:00:31.930]  I used to, you know, judge like if a strain is good or not
[02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:34.610]  by like the amount of like trichomes or resin,
[02:00:34.610 --> 02:00:35.810]  you know, that it has like,
[02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:37.690]  ooh, this one's like super sticky.
[02:00:37.690 --> 02:00:38.530]  You know what I mean?
[02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:40.130]  Like, this is gonna be a good one.
[02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:42.090]  And then, you know, you test that one
[02:00:42.090 --> 02:00:45.530]  and it's super low in THC and terpenes
[02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:47.090]  and you know, there's nothing in there.
[02:00:47.090 --> 02:00:49.090]  And you're like, what?
[02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:51.370]  It like literally doesn't make any sense.
[02:00:51.810 --> 02:00:53.530]  So I don't know, just throwing it out there,
[02:00:53.530 --> 02:00:55.010]  some of the things that, you know,
[02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:59.170]  we've seen from testing those genetics
[02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:00.650]  and doing, you know, hunts.
[02:01:01.890 --> 02:01:04.050]  Yeah, like the pre-98 Bubba Kush
[02:01:04.050 --> 02:01:06.290]  was the first one that I learned where, you know,
[02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:09.610]  it has 12 to 15% THC,
[02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:11.090]  but has other cannabinoids,
[02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:14.690]  well, you know, it like, it'll couch lock you like crazy.
[02:01:14.690 --> 02:01:17.890]  But learning that when I was growing for a dispensary,
[02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:20.930]  you know, it was really hard for the customer
[02:01:21.490 --> 02:01:22.970]  to even try it because they looked at that number
[02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:27.250]  and they're like, oh, fuck that, you know, 15%.
[02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:28.970]  Especially at that time, you know,
[02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:31.930]  it was anything over 20 was flying off the shelves.
[02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:33.490]  Like that was the only way.
[02:01:33.490 --> 02:01:36.330]  And you're trying to educate the bud tenders
[02:01:36.330 --> 02:01:38.050]  because they're the ones that are in the end
[02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:39.770]  actually selling the product
[02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:41.810]  and they're selling it the same way
[02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:43.290]  that the customer is seeing it as like,
[02:01:43.290 --> 02:01:45.850]  all right, well, this one's 20%, this one's fire.
[02:01:45.850 --> 02:01:48.490]  This one's 15%, even though that one would get you
[02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:51.010]  even higher in couch lock,
[02:01:51.010 --> 02:01:52.210]  it was still being sold as like,
[02:01:52.210 --> 02:01:54.610]  this one's more of like a nighttime stone,
[02:01:54.610 --> 02:01:57.050]  which obviously it was, but almost pitched
[02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:59.290]  as like it wasn't going to be as effective.
[02:01:59.290 --> 02:02:01.570]  Like saying a Jaeger shot is gonna be easier for you
[02:02:01.570 --> 02:02:03.690]  than sipping on a beer.
[02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:05.730]  So a lot of people were kind of coming back to the dispensary
[02:02:05.730 --> 02:02:09.130]  that we were at, upset with the bud tenders.
[02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:10.850]  So the, you know, management was trying to bring
[02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:12.210]  the growers in to educate.
[02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:14.170]  It was just a lot of disinformation back then,
[02:02:14.170 --> 02:02:17.090]  or selling somebody a hundred gram edible
[02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:19.010]  that's never done cannabis before.
[02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:21.810]  You know, looking back that I bet a lot of people
[02:02:21.810 --> 02:02:23.810]  had a nightmare situation with that.
[02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.210]  You've never done cannabis before
[02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:28.410]  and you have a hundred milligram candy bar.
[02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:31.690]  You're gonna be gripping the couch, you know,
[02:02:31.690 --> 02:02:34.210]  and it's gonna be fucking intense.
[02:02:34.210 --> 02:02:37.010]  Yeah, you'll definitely trip out, that's for sure.
[02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:39.490]  I think that's what New York Times reporters do.
[02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:42.930]  Well, yeah, that's kind of what I was gonna say.
[02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:45.170]  What was her name?
[02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:47.010]  I don't remember, but she was upset.
[02:02:47.010 --> 02:02:49.650]  She was just marined out or something.
[02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:53.810]  Yeah, and she should have, I guess, really understood that.
[02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:55.410]  You know, we always joked about that.
[02:02:55.410 --> 02:02:57.730]  That's like saying, I've never done alcohol before.
[02:02:57.730 --> 02:03:00.650]  And I'm, you know, again, chugging Jaeger and I got sick
[02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:02.170]  and it was a horrible experience.
[02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:03.610]  It's like, yeah, well, you went,
[02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:06.450]  you like dove in the super deep end on that.
[02:03:06.450 --> 02:03:07.290]  No wonder.
[02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:10.410]  All right, you know, when things first opened up,
[02:03:10.410 --> 02:03:12.050]  they were selling a thousand milligrams.
[02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:13.690]  And I tried that with a friend,
[02:03:13.690 --> 02:03:15.850]  went to this place called Beta Nightclub
[02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:18.010]  and I was sitting in the corner drooling on myself.
[02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:19.850]  And I felt like I have a pretty good tolerance,
[02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.610]  but you know, a thousand milligrams
[02:03:21.610 --> 02:03:24.770]  is too much for anybody.
[02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:27.250]  Oh yeah, that'll put you out for a few days.
[02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:31.970]  Yeah, to be at like a decent nightclub
[02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:34.290]  and to be sitting down and in the corner,
[02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:36.130]  I mean, that's not my personality.
[02:03:36.130 --> 02:03:40.090]  So yeah, it was a unique experience.
[02:03:40.090 --> 02:03:41.410]  Obviously now they don't do that.
[02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:43.330]  I think it's 10 milligrams, you know,
[02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:45.010]  it's a hundred milligrams max,
[02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:46.610]  which makes sense because it's,
[02:03:46.610 --> 02:03:48.530]  if it's being sold recreational,
[02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:49.970]  how is it where you guys are at?
[02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:51.530]  I mean, are there things like that
[02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:53.770]  or is somebody able to walk in
[02:03:53.770 --> 02:03:57.050]  and buy a thousand milligram edible?
[02:03:57.050 --> 02:04:00.570]  No, I think it's the same in Colorado,
[02:04:00.570 --> 02:04:05.570]  but that is something we do struggle with though,
[02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:07.090]  I will say is like,
[02:04:07.090 --> 02:04:11.890]  what genetics is finding things that we can sell
[02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:14.370]  because we can really only sell, you know,
[02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:17.610]  strains that test above 20%,
[02:04:17.610 --> 02:04:20.090]  like more like 25% now,
[02:04:20.090 --> 02:04:21.490]  like it keeps going up.
[02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:23.330]  Like it really does.
[02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:28.330]  Like, so yeah, that's been like a struggle.
[02:04:28.570 --> 02:04:30.930]  And then like finding things that,
[02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:33.970]  like finding genetics that check all the boxes,
[02:04:33.970 --> 02:04:37.170]  like, okay, so high THC,
[02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:40.650]  like high terpene smells good,
[02:04:40.690 --> 02:04:42.610]  like looks good,
[02:04:42.610 --> 02:04:44.170]  like grows well,
[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:45.370]  roots well,
[02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:47.290]  resistant to disease.
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:51.770]  Like we don't have a strain that checks all those boxes,
[02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:54.610]  you know, and we've been like, you know,
[02:04:54.610 --> 02:04:57.010]  phenol hunting, like all these different strains
[02:04:57.010 --> 02:04:59.650]  for like, you know, two years now.
[02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:02.410]  So it's just crazy.
[02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:05.090]  Like we have a few good strains that, you know,
[02:05:05.090 --> 02:05:07.450]  we keep around and, you know,
[02:05:07.450 --> 02:05:08.530]  people really like,
[02:05:08.530 --> 02:05:11.490]  like the tropical runs that we have is fricking
[02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:14.170]  the best thing I've ever smoked for sure.
[02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:20.770]  So it's like, we do have like good stuff,
[02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:21.970]  but it's just like, you know,
[02:05:21.970 --> 02:05:23.730]  the tropical runs is really good.
[02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:26.690]  It checks all the boxes, high THC, great smell,
[02:05:26.690 --> 02:05:29.890]  like, but it doesn't root well
[02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:33.330]  and it yields like not very well at all.
[02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:35.490]  So it's just like the small runty plant
[02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:38.130]  that just like produces this like crazy,
[02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:41.050]  like terpy fucking experience.
[02:05:42.650 --> 02:05:45.450]  Yeah, I don't think a lot of people think of
[02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:48.290]  cultivating cannabis on your level where it's like,
[02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:50.490]  okay, yeah, but if my, you know,
[02:05:50.490 --> 02:05:53.450]  if my team's not able to clone very well yet
[02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:55.170]  or if it's a new facility,
[02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:57.490]  then some of these genetics are going to be a nightmare.
[02:05:57.490 --> 02:06:00.010]  You know, you're going to have to clone 4X, 2X,
[02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:01.010]  whatever it is.
[02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:03.610]  Yeah, so there's just a lot to think about
[02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:05.130]  and that's why we always like to, you know,
[02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:07.810]  pick people's brains that are in the trenches is,
[02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:10.810]  you know, there's just so many moving parts,
[02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:13.850]  but once you kind of understand how the machine works,
[02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:15.210]  you know, you're able to maintain.
[02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:16.530]  And then, you know,
[02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:19.450]  I hope that you're teaching your team
[02:06:19.450 --> 02:06:21.730]  so that they level up, you know,
[02:06:21.730 --> 02:06:23.010]  cause in my opinion,
[02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:26.050]  the best bang for buck when you're paying labor
[02:06:26.050 --> 02:06:29.450]  is for them to be scoping IPM, looking for issues,
[02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:32.650]  you know, making sure that we're all protecting the plant
[02:06:32.690 --> 02:06:35.970]  as best as possible instead of, you know,
[02:06:35.970 --> 02:06:37.210]  brewing the teas and stuff.
[02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:40.170]  I feel like that's more of, if it's necessary, yes,
[02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:42.290]  you know, let's have the team do it.
[02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:44.610]  But for the most part, let's get into the extracts.
[02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:47.490]  Let's get them eyeing the plants, touching the plant,
[02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:49.810]  you know, well, I really like touching the flowers
[02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:51.850]  or anything, but you know, working the plants,
[02:06:51.850 --> 02:06:54.810]  you know, shaving the legs as some people would kind of say,
[02:06:54.810 --> 02:06:57.690]  you know, just finding ways to improve
[02:06:57.690 --> 02:07:00.650]  the overall health of that plant is when your team,
[02:07:00.650 --> 02:07:03.250]  and I feel like that whoever that head cultivator
[02:07:03.250 --> 02:07:05.170]  or multiple head cultivators,
[02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:07.650]  that's where you guys really shine as a group
[02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:10.650]  when everybody is basically able to focus
[02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:13.010]  on just protecting the plant instead of trying to figure out
[02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:14.770]  what all these deficiencies are going on
[02:07:14.770 --> 02:07:19.770]  and why, you know, this pocket of the room won't pop off.
[02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:23.490]  Or, you know, there's so many deficiencies within this bed.
[02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:25.370]  It's like, what are we doing differently here?
[02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:27.770]  And then you find out, hey, maybe there's a few cracks
[02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:30.410]  we didn't notice that were just making the room
[02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:33.290]  a little bit colder than we, you know, we had.
[02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:36.050]  Way too many variables at first.
[02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:38.090]  So if you're newer to this, to try to think
[02:07:38.090 --> 02:07:40.610]  that you're gonna just grow a living soil system
[02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:44.970]  in a 10,000 square foot facility is comical at best.
[02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:47.850]  I mean, there's levels to this aspect
[02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:50.090]  and that's why we encourage Leighton and I, Peter,
[02:07:50.090 --> 02:07:52.370]  and everybody that's a part of Future Cannabis Project,
[02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:55.290]  just start farming now, just do at least a worm bin
[02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:56.810]  so you have that skillset, you know,
[02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:59.370]  and then when you wanna grow in a tent, boom,
[02:07:59.370 --> 02:08:02.530]  now you understand worm farming for a little bit
[02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:03.970]  and now you can farm in the tent.
[02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:06.570]  Now you understand cannabis farming, at least in the tent.
[02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:09.530]  Maybe soon you have a, bought a little house for yourself.
[02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:12.570]  And now, you know, basement farming is to me
[02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:14.850]  like the secret sauce to life.
[02:08:14.850 --> 02:08:16.730]  I mean, if you can have something that you live in
[02:08:16.730 --> 02:08:20.290]  pay for itself with a skillset, boom, you know?
[02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:24.010]  That's being an entrepreneur, maybe on a different,
[02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:26.370]  you know, a little different level, but still,
[02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:29.330]  that's where those kinds of mindsets thrive
[02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:32.610]  is being able to make money for yourself with a skillset.
[02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:34.330]  And cannabis farming has always been that
[02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:36.370]  for a lot of people in my life.
[02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:38.650]  I mean, that's how a lot of people still to this day
[02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:39.730]  take care of themselves.
[02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:42.490]  And I wish you guys would come on the show,
[02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:43.850]  but I realize why you don't.
[02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:47.450]  Yeah, totally.
[02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:51.870]  That's, you know, something like I really,
[02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:54.090]  that's really awesome at HIFA is that, you know,
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:57.130]  we have a great team and everyone kind of has their
[02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:01.330]  specialty or thing that they're good at.
[02:09:01.330 --> 02:09:04.010]  And we just like work together really well.
[02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:07.970]  So everyone kind of has their own like piece of the puzzle
[02:09:07.970 --> 02:09:12.050]  that they focus on and that they're really good at, so.
[02:09:13.770 --> 02:09:15.550]  Now, when it's coming to genetics,
[02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:17.070]  you guys said you were pheno hunting.
[02:09:17.070 --> 02:09:20.250]  Do you mind kind of sharing some of the breeders
[02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:23.210]  that you guys like running at the commercial level?
[02:09:23.210 --> 02:09:27.670]  Oh gosh, we're like trying a little bit of everything.
[02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:32.890]  You know, obviously we ran through a lot of ethos.
[02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:37.890]  We ran through a lot of humble, like exotic genetics.
[02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:42.890]  And right now we're doing a lot of local breeders.
[02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:48.610]  So we have like Terp Wizard and Rising Moon Medicinals.
[02:09:48.610 --> 02:09:51.130]  And, oh gosh.
[02:09:51.130 --> 02:09:53.130]  Oh, we have some Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[02:09:53.970 --> 02:09:54.810]  We have some other stuff coming up.
[02:09:54.810 --> 02:09:59.810]  And just kind of seeing how those seeds that were bred
[02:10:01.410 --> 02:10:05.130]  also in living soil compared to, you know,
[02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:10.130]  seeds that maybe were not bred in living soil
[02:10:10.730 --> 02:10:15.730]  and kind of seeing how much of a difference there is there.
[02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:19.330]  Yeah, some people swear by it.
[02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:22.610]  Some people even swear before even the living soil thing,
[02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:24.730]  Bodhi seeds, are you familiar with that?
[02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:27.130]  He has like that teal bag with the gold sticker.
[02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:30.130]  People swore by his genetics
[02:10:30.130 --> 02:10:31.450]  that there was just something different
[02:10:31.450 --> 02:10:33.410]  because of the way he viewed life
[02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:35.810]  and maybe the way he did his stuff.
[02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:38.690]  But yeah, there's always been, yep.
[02:10:39.810 --> 02:10:42.410]  He kind of changes stuff up a little bit.
[02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:44.390]  It used to just be the teal bag with the gold sticker.
[02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:47.430]  And that was like, to me, the Tiffany ring, you know?
[02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:51.850]  The Go-G-O-G, I remember that was the one that we found.
[02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:54.810]  That really stood out.
[02:10:54.810 --> 02:10:55.730]  Nice.
[02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:56.570]  Yeah.
[02:10:57.610 --> 02:11:00.970]  So I wanted to, you know, we've had TerpWizard on the show
[02:11:00.970 --> 02:11:03.730]  and I was kind of hoping why you could kind of explain
[02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:05.210]  why you were running his genetics.
[02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:07.050]  Because, you know, there's obviously,
[02:11:08.190 --> 02:11:09.770]  I don't even know how to keep up anymore.
[02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:12.050]  There's probably thousands of decent breeders,
[02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:16.290]  hundreds of quality breeders, you know, great breeders,
[02:11:16.290 --> 02:11:18.010]  you know, elite breeders.
[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:20.710]  I still feel like there's probably maybe 50 or less,
[02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:23.090]  but it's continuing to grow.
[02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:26.390]  So out of that, what made TerpWizard's genetics
[02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:28.710]  stick out to you guys and your team?
[02:11:28.710 --> 02:11:31.550]  Yeah, he's a really good friend of ours.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:36.550]  And we do want to grow things that were bred by,
[02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:42.590]  you know, people in the local living soil
[02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:45.110]  regenerative community that we have here,
[02:11:45.630 --> 02:11:50.630]  you know, to feature them in dispensaries as well,
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:55.670]  and in the, I guess, recreational, legal, whatever market.
[02:11:57.630 --> 02:12:02.630]  And also, you know, because we wanted to experiment
[02:12:03.190 --> 02:12:08.190]  with breeders who were also breeding in living soil
[02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:11.530]  to see if that works better for our system.
[02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:16.290]  Yeah, because, I mean, you mentioned some of the ethos
[02:12:16.290 --> 02:12:19.730]  and exotic mic and all, I mean, those are,
[02:12:19.730 --> 02:12:22.150]  to me, that's a international brand.
[02:12:23.090 --> 02:12:24.970]  But then there's guys that, like for me,
[02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:27.050]  is like, I've mentioned Genome Alchemy,
[02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:29.010]  where someone just has the talent.
[02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:31.450]  I almost feel like enough people need to hear their song,
[02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:34.170]  if you will, and then it's catchy.
[02:12:34.170 --> 02:12:36.270]  The genetics are something that you want to rock with.
[02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:39.650]  So it's cool to see you supporting a guy like TerpWizard.
[02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:41.730]  You know, I admire that guy as well.
[02:12:41.730 --> 02:12:43.250]  I mean, there's just so many individuals
[02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:46.930]  that are bright-minded and, for the most part,
[02:12:46.930 --> 02:12:48.970]  young and determined and stuff.
[02:12:48.970 --> 02:12:50.290]  So it was just cool to see.
[02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:52.450]  I mean, I'm gonna turn 40 this year,
[02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:54.570]  so I feel like I'm an older man
[02:12:54.570 --> 02:12:57.170]  when it's seeing the way things are churning.
[02:12:57.170 --> 02:13:00.970]  But just within a decade, I mean, we've gone from blasting,
[02:13:00.970 --> 02:13:02.890]  disgusting BHO in the backyard
[02:13:02.890 --> 02:13:06.650]  to creating an art form of cannabis.
[02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:09.130]  And now it's really become an art form
[02:13:09.610 --> 02:13:12.570]  with a medicinal viewpoint and outlook.
[02:13:13.450 --> 02:13:18.450]  Yeah, I love TerpWizard's hash talk,
[02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:21.930]  because I'm not like a extract person at all.
[02:13:21.930 --> 02:13:24.090]  Like, I don't know the first thing about it.
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.890]  So I loved hearing it from him.
[02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:28.330]  Like, it was just so cool.
[02:13:28.330 --> 02:13:31.450]  I like smoking it, but I just don't know.
[02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:33.530]  Hell yeah, we all like smoking it.
[02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:36.370]  So now, yeah, I just thought it was really cool.
[02:13:37.210 --> 02:13:39.050]  And I like bringing those guys on.
[02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:41.850]  Also, shout out to TerpFountain Genetics,
[02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:45.090]  Land of Stank, people that I've admired for a long time
[02:13:45.090 --> 02:13:48.130]  that are young, that were just putting out quality stuff
[02:13:48.130 --> 02:13:49.250]  that you remember.
[02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:52.370]  Because it's, I mean, obviously traveling and stuff,
[02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:53.810]  you're smoking with a lot of people,
[02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:57.010]  but there are nights where I remember smoking people's stuff
[02:13:57.010 --> 02:14:00.010]  where it's like, man, when Land of Stank was here,
[02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:03.730]  I mean, his stuff was just different.
[02:14:03.730 --> 02:14:05.890]  And I think, especially back then,
[02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:09.010]  he understood living soil and that's what really made it.
[02:14:09.010 --> 02:14:12.370]  Because he was an A to Z farmer is kind of how I view it.
[02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:14.690]  That should be the goal for anyone
[02:14:14.690 --> 02:14:15.850]  that's in their early twenties.
[02:14:15.850 --> 02:14:18.210]  You should be an A to Z farmer.
[02:14:18.210 --> 02:14:19.610]  If you're starting off today,
[02:14:19.610 --> 02:14:21.090]  you should be an A to Z farmer
[02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:23.410]  probably within four or five years.
[02:14:23.410 --> 02:14:26.250]  And you can change your outlook and life and stars
[02:14:26.250 --> 02:14:30.450]  and the whole gamut of working for someone
[02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:33.130]  and then finding a way to make money for yourself
[02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:34.850]  and be an entrepreneur.
[02:14:35.170 --> 02:14:37.930]  There's a dramatic difference in lifestyle to that.
[02:14:37.930 --> 02:14:39.930]  Yes, you still work your ass off,
[02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.890]  but you get to pick and choose.
[02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:44.410]  And that's something that I wish I would have understood
[02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:48.130]  earlier in life is if you can find your own way
[02:14:48.130 --> 02:14:52.730]  and be your own boss, as long as you are on top of things.
[02:14:52.730 --> 02:14:55.610]  Because some of my buddies to this day, man,
[02:14:55.610 --> 02:14:57.090]  they could probably do anything
[02:14:57.090 --> 02:14:59.530]  and they just hustle weed and play Madden all day.
[02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:03.370]  They'd have people running through, you know?
[02:15:03.370 --> 02:15:04.570]  I mean, they don't even have to leave their house
[02:15:05.530 --> 02:15:06.850]  doing their thing.
[02:15:06.850 --> 02:15:08.690]  Yeah, totally.
[02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:14.690]  Yeah, I definitely struggled with my purpose in life
[02:15:15.170 --> 02:15:16.330]  for a long time.
[02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:20.530]  And I got into drugs and all that stuff
[02:15:20.530 --> 02:15:22.050]  for a little bit too long.
[02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:27.050]  And I always like to say that getting my hands in the soil
[02:15:27.130 --> 02:15:29.370]  helped me to clean up my act.
[02:15:29.370 --> 02:15:34.370]  So really just feeling that connection and that purpose,
[02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:38.690]  like I was talking about is what made me realize
[02:15:38.690 --> 02:15:42.730]  that my life and what I'm putting in my body matters.
[02:15:42.730 --> 02:15:47.730]  And I just truly think that the best thing
[02:15:48.850 --> 02:15:53.850]  that we can do for other people is to better ourselves.
[02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:56.690]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:15:56.690 --> 02:15:58.810]  And to give them the tools that they choose
[02:15:58.810 --> 02:16:01.450]  to better themselves and continue that process.
[02:16:01.450 --> 02:16:04.250]  And I think that's really what this whole platform is about
[02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:07.330]  is having a variety of people with experience
[02:16:07.330 --> 02:16:08.370]  to talk about things.
[02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:10.570]  Because yeah, we can all watch videos and books,
[02:16:10.570 --> 02:16:12.850]  but sometimes just hearing it from somebody
[02:16:13.930 --> 02:16:16.890]  doing it for so long for me is, I mean,
[02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:17.730]  what did that say to you?
[02:16:17.730 --> 02:16:18.730]  Maybe a decade?
[02:16:18.730 --> 02:16:19.850]  Because they're talking about things,
[02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:21.610]  you know, they've been farming for 30 years.
[02:16:21.610 --> 02:16:24.490]  And these are the things I've noticed in the last 10 years
[02:16:24.490 --> 02:16:26.250]  that have really made a difference.
[02:16:28.690 --> 02:16:33.130]  Yeah, so it's just like when you are bettering yourself
[02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:35.010]  and you're working on yourself,
[02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:38.850]  then that kind of just like that energy reverberates
[02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:41.970]  into the collective and other people see that
[02:16:41.970 --> 02:16:45.730]  and it rubs off on them as well,
[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.410]  whether they like know it or not,
[02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:50.490]  just like that energy being out there
[02:16:51.330 --> 02:16:54.450]  is helpful to the entire collective.
[02:16:54.450 --> 02:16:57.810]  So just continuing to like work on yourself
[02:16:57.810 --> 02:17:01.370]  and like shed the layers and, you know,
[02:17:01.890 --> 02:17:04.930]  Chandler let me borrow this book,
[02:17:06.090 --> 02:17:09.690]  Fermentation as a Metaphor by Sandor Katz,
[02:17:09.690 --> 02:17:11.770]  which I'm really getting into his-
[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.130]  Hold that up again.
[02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:21.250]  Can you see it?
[02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:25.010]  Yeah, it's Fermentation as Metaphor.
[02:17:25.010 --> 02:17:26.930]  Yeah, by Sandor Katz.
[02:17:26.930 --> 02:17:29.730]  And then he also gave me this one,
[02:17:29.730 --> 02:17:34.210]  The Art of Fermentation to borrow.
[02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:39.170]  So that one's, I'm super interested to get into fermenting,
[02:17:39.170 --> 02:17:40.730]  but anyways, in this book,
[02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:43.730]  he talks about fermenting as a metaphor
[02:17:46.410 --> 02:17:50.890]  for just kind of like change in general
[02:17:50.890 --> 02:17:55.890]  and just kind of how fermentation can be
[02:17:59.530 --> 02:18:03.290]  also like change within like us
[02:18:03.330 --> 02:18:08.330]  as far as like transforming like our beliefs and ideas
[02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:10.250]  and paradigms,
[02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:15.250]  like those old systems and beliefs kind of break down
[02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:20.490]  or ferment and give rise to new forms.
[02:18:20.490 --> 02:18:23.210]  So kind of like, you know-
[02:18:23.210 --> 02:18:24.450]  Yeah, new eyes.
[02:18:24.450 --> 02:18:27.810]  Ego that, you know, we experience
[02:18:27.810 --> 02:18:30.530]  and like I experience them all the time.
[02:18:30.530 --> 02:18:32.970]  Like I'm like always shedding layers.
[02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:36.290]  Where did all these layers come from?
[02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:37.130]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:40.210]  Like always like realizing things about myself,
[02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:44.050]  like, whoa, I didn't know I did that
[02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:46.210]  or wow, I didn't realize this belief
[02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:48.410]  was like holding me back so much.
[02:18:48.410 --> 02:18:51.330]  So it's just like, you know,
[02:18:51.330 --> 02:18:55.250]  one of those things that I think is cool.
[02:18:55.250 --> 02:19:00.250]  Fermentation as a metaphor for changing your beliefs.
[02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:04.450]  Interesting perspective there.
[02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:07.610]  Well, yeah, like with the yeast and stuff
[02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:09.450]  when we were talking from beforehand,
[02:19:09.450 --> 02:19:12.010]  there's some doctors that believe
[02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:15.210]  that they can actually kind of control you in a way
[02:19:15.210 --> 02:19:17.610]  because it has such an urge that you're, you know,
[02:19:17.610 --> 02:19:20.250]  you're craving sweets and all that.
[02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:21.930]  So that part was interesting to me
[02:19:21.930 --> 02:19:25.210]  when I started to realize that it is kind of a second brain
[02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:29.770]  and if you don't nourish it the same way
[02:19:29.770 --> 02:19:34.490]  as you would, you know, your brain and that kind of stuff.
[02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:36.210]  Like, I feel like I drink water constantly,
[02:19:36.210 --> 02:19:39.450]  but when I was younger, it was like soda and milk.
[02:19:39.450 --> 02:19:44.450]  And, you know, that was just how the family was, you know,
[02:19:44.610 --> 02:19:45.970]  that was just how I felt like, you know,
[02:19:45.970 --> 02:19:47.250]  when you're out at the pool,
[02:19:47.250 --> 02:19:49.130]  you have a soda instead of water and stuff.
[02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:50.930]  So just those little things,
[02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:53.970]  I feel like really make a difference over the years
[02:19:53.970 --> 02:19:55.050]  to your gut biome.
[02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:57.570]  And maybe I was growing up in the South
[02:19:57.570 --> 02:19:59.690]  where vegetables is, you know,
[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:02.530]  lard and mixed with that kind of stuff.
[02:20:02.530 --> 02:20:03.970]  But yeah, the nutritional level,
[02:20:03.970 --> 02:20:08.290]  when I started to really focus on that fasting, stop eating,
[02:20:08.290 --> 02:20:09.970]  there's a noticeable difference in your life.
[02:20:09.970 --> 02:20:12.410]  And I hope more people experience that for themselves
[02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:15.450]  because we do kind of get your own thoughts back in a way,
[02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:17.410]  especially at night where it's like, you know,
[02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:18.890]  you just don't crave that anymore
[02:20:18.890 --> 02:20:20.530]  if you're really sticking to
[02:20:21.930 --> 02:20:23.610]  like an intermittent fasting.
[02:20:23.650 --> 02:20:25.210]  So.
[02:20:25.210 --> 02:20:29.650]  Yeah, I'm into fasting.
[02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:33.730]  I've done multiple fasts now.
[02:20:33.730 --> 02:20:34.570]  I started with,
[02:20:34.570 --> 02:20:37.210]  because Dragonfly does those cleanses and stuff.
[02:20:37.210 --> 02:20:41.210]  So that's kind of what like sparked me into fasting,
[02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:43.410]  but fasting for me, like, you know,
[02:20:43.410 --> 02:20:46.530]  cause I, you know, I was like a drug addict for a while.
[02:20:46.530 --> 02:20:50.010]  So like I didn't really have like much self control.
[02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:51.410]  So I feel like,
[02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:54.610]  and I always felt like I needed to be consuming something
[02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:57.730]  to like be, you know, whatever,
[02:20:57.730 --> 02:21:02.130]  just normal or like, whatever, just like be happy.
[02:21:02.130 --> 02:21:06.250]  So fasting for me was like taking a pause
[02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:09.730]  and like not, and knowing that like,
[02:21:09.730 --> 02:21:11.250]  I am everything I need.
[02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:13.370]  I have everything I need inside of myself
[02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:15.810]  and just really, you know,
[02:21:15.810 --> 02:21:17.850]  kind of having that self discipline
[02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:20.130]  and not needing to consume everything
[02:21:20.170 --> 02:21:22.090]  and just like sitting with myself.
[02:21:22.090 --> 02:21:24.970]  And so that was like a very like big part
[02:21:24.970 --> 02:21:29.650]  of like my healing experience from that as well.
[02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:33.850]  And yeah, fasting does like reset your microbiome.
[02:21:33.850 --> 02:21:35.610]  So, you know, if you are having
[02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:38.170]  like massive overgrowth problems,
[02:21:38.170 --> 02:21:40.450]  like it's good to do like a cleanse
[02:21:40.450 --> 02:21:43.810]  and then come in with your like fermented foods
[02:21:43.810 --> 02:21:47.010]  and re-inoculate everything, you know,
[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:48.810]  just like kind of in the soil.
[02:21:48.850 --> 02:21:51.490]  If, you know, the soil has a pathogen, you know,
[02:21:51.490 --> 02:21:56.170]  you'll kind of do a similar thing there, but yeah.
[02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:57.370]  And do it with food.
[02:21:57.370 --> 02:22:00.370]  Don't do it with expensive probiotics.
[02:22:00.370 --> 02:22:01.210]  Oh yeah.
[02:22:01.210 --> 02:22:02.530]  Especially ones that aren't refrigerated.
[02:22:02.530 --> 02:22:03.770]  I mean, that's not even.
[02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:05.810]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:22:05.810 --> 02:22:07.290]  I don't know if you've ever seen the price tag
[02:22:07.290 --> 02:22:08.850]  on that stuff, but it's ridiculous
[02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:10.250]  when you could just, you know,
[02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:11.890]  buy some fermented foods and-
[02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.850]  Totally, like making your own sauerkraut
[02:22:14.850 --> 02:22:17.130]  is like you can do it for pennies on the dollar,
[02:22:17.130 --> 02:22:18.010]  you know what I mean?
[02:22:18.970 --> 02:22:19.930]  And that's what I do.
[02:22:19.930 --> 02:22:22.090]  And I make, you know, I buy three cabbages
[02:22:22.090 --> 02:22:25.130]  and I make, you know, six jars of sauerkraut.
[02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:28.410]  And I seriously put it on everything that I eat,
[02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:30.050]  like everything.
[02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:32.490]  And it's just, it's so good for you.
[02:22:32.490 --> 02:22:36.410]  Like I personally have been seeing the benefits,
[02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:38.810]  especially like I have always struggled
[02:22:38.810 --> 02:22:41.450]  with kind of like brain fog and stuff.
[02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:45.170]  So I've definitely seen a benefit with like,
[02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:49.410]  you know, just thinking more clearly
[02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:53.610]  and just being able to like regulate my emotions easier
[02:22:53.610 --> 02:22:57.210]  and like less anxiety, like less stress.
[02:22:57.210 --> 02:23:01.450]  And so, yeah, I mean, it hasn't been long enough
[02:23:01.450 --> 02:23:03.770]  of me like doing this to really say anything
[02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:07.890]  like conclusive about it, but I'm a believer.
[02:23:09.250 --> 02:23:10.970]  Well, I like how you mentioned like you're,
[02:23:10.970 --> 02:23:14.410]  it does feel like everything's firing on a faster level.
[02:23:14.410 --> 02:23:16.690]  Like you're running on a high octane fuel
[02:23:16.690 --> 02:23:20.090]  instead of, you know, chips and soda and all that.
[02:23:21.330 --> 02:23:22.170]  Yeah.
[02:23:22.170 --> 02:23:23.250]  It's really unique.
[02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:26.130]  And then you don't necessarily have to eat as much,
[02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.890]  which allows, I don't know,
[02:23:27.890 --> 02:23:31.090]  I feel like I'm getting more shit done during the day.
[02:23:31.090 --> 02:23:33.170]  I haven't eaten anything still, you know,
[02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:34.370]  and I feel fantastic.
[02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:38.370]  And I think that obviously you need to build up to that.
[02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:41.650]  But if you can go 12 hours, like 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.,
[02:23:41.650 --> 02:23:44.210]  you're automatically changing your life
[02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:45.810]  just from that little thing.
[02:23:45.810 --> 02:23:48.570]  I feel like most people can do that.
[02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:49.410]  Yeah.
[02:23:49.410 --> 02:23:50.850]  It's just hard late at night if you're with friends
[02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:52.570]  to say like, oh, I'm not eating.
[02:23:54.290 --> 02:23:56.730]  Drinking alcohol obviously is,
[02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:58.050]  that's gonna kill your fast too.
[02:23:58.050 --> 02:24:00.730]  Like some people say that it's just liquid.
[02:24:00.730 --> 02:24:03.170]  It's like, well, it's liquid poison, brother.
[02:24:03.170 --> 02:24:05.930]  You know, that's not really, you're missing the point.
[02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:08.250]  For sure, for sure.
[02:24:08.250 --> 02:24:13.250]  Yeah, fasting, it allows the body to go into like autophagies
[02:24:14.210 --> 02:24:18.490]  so like healing and just cellular.
[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:20.370]  That's my favorite word and I always talk about it,
[02:24:20.370 --> 02:24:21.210]  no one else does.
[02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:22.650]  So do you mind saying what that is
[02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:24.290]  just so someone else can hear it?
[02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:29.450]  And before you do, as soon as you mentioned the word fasting
[02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:32.530]  I was gonna say Brian's cork is tingling.
[02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:33.370]  Is what?
[02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:37.090]  That's an inside joke, Brian can explain it.
[02:24:37.090 --> 02:24:38.570]  All right, yeah, I wasn't kidding.
[02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:40.530]  It doesn't make us feel awkward online.
[02:24:42.450 --> 02:24:43.930]  But really, you know, there's certain things
[02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:45.730]  where you can tell Layton gets excited.
[02:24:45.730 --> 02:24:48.530]  Fasting autophagy is one of those things
[02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:49.850]  that I just love to talk about
[02:24:49.850 --> 02:24:52.930]  because most people don't, actually to be honest
[02:24:52.930 --> 02:24:54.930]  I don't think most people even know what autophagy is.
[02:24:54.930 --> 02:24:57.370]  So I was hoping maybe you could kind of just talk about it
[02:24:57.370 --> 02:24:58.650]  from your point of view.
[02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:02.290]  For sure, so as far as I know, you know,
[02:25:02.290 --> 02:25:07.290]  when your body has these natural detoxification pathways
[02:25:07.930 --> 02:25:10.850]  and when you're constantly digesting things
[02:25:10.850 --> 02:25:13.610]  your body doesn't, it's still detoxifying
[02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:17.290]  but it doesn't have as much energy to put towards that.
[02:25:17.290 --> 02:25:22.290]  So fasting like activates autophagy
[02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:26.410]  which basically is cellular regeneration.
[02:25:26.410 --> 02:25:31.410]  So it will basically like go through like cellular apoptosis
[02:25:33.490 --> 02:25:38.490]  of cells that are just weak or dying, dead,
[02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:44.010]  misprinted or something.
[02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:49.330]  So yeah, so it will basically like get rid of those
[02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:55.890]  dead cells and renew with new cells.
[02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:58.970]  Is that on par with what you know?
[02:25:58.970 --> 02:25:59.810]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:02.730]  Like I think you're a little more educated than I am.
[02:26:02.730 --> 02:26:06.370]  So we would say it as when you're building a shed
[02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:08.050]  and then you mess up on the shed
[02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:12.090]  and then those are like folded proteins or something.
[02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:14.150]  If you allow those to continue to build up
[02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:16.490]  that's where you're gonna find disease and illness.
[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:19.570]  Where if you stop that, the autophagy kicks in,
[02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:20.810]  it breaks that down.
[02:26:20.810 --> 02:26:23.050]  So all those nails, all that wood
[02:26:23.050 --> 02:26:25.030]  that would have necessarily been a hindrance
[02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:28.090]  is recycled and made into a brand new cabinet,
[02:26:28.090 --> 02:26:29.970]  brand new bathroom for your house
[02:26:29.970 --> 02:26:32.010]  so that you're looking shiny and new.
[02:26:32.010 --> 02:26:35.010]  And that happens within the eyes and with the skin.
[02:26:35.010 --> 02:26:38.250]  So it's again, it's something noticeable that you can see.
[02:26:38.250 --> 02:26:40.050]  It doesn't happen quickly.
[02:26:40.050 --> 02:26:43.250]  And I think anything in life seems to take some time.
[02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:47.050]  So if you've been eating poorly your whole life,
[02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:49.690]  don't think that just because you committed 30 days
[02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:51.690]  that there's gonna be some dramatic improvement.
[02:26:51.690 --> 02:26:52.730]  I mean, you gotta kinda,
[02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:55.370]  I think 90 days is the minimum there.
[02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:58.370]  But you'll start to notice things if you stick to this.
[02:26:58.370 --> 02:27:02.410]  And autophagy is, I believe the gentleman
[02:27:02.610 --> 02:27:07.610]  that found that won a Nobel Peace Prize for that even,
[02:27:07.850 --> 02:27:10.690]  because it was just an unbelievable discovery
[02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:12.170]  and no one talks about it.
[02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:14.150]  And I'm so glad that, Alexa,
[02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:15.410]  that we were able to talk about it
[02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:18.650]  because it's a life-changing thing that costs $0.
[02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:20.070]  I mean, you literally just stop eating.
[02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:22.870]  And then of course, if you're addicted to sugary things,
[02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:24.050]  that sounds like crazy.
[02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:25.650]  I'm gonna get all these headaches
[02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:29.490]  and maybe the first day or two that might be true for you.
[02:27:29.490 --> 02:27:31.110]  But if you focus on your electrolytes,
[02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:33.590]  you're not gonna experience that to the same level
[02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:36.270]  that people that don't focus on their electrolytes.
[02:27:36.270 --> 02:27:38.830]  And realize that you're going through some changes.
[02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:41.030]  And in a way, that's a good thing
[02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:42.750]  because the headaches go away.
[02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:44.390]  And then all of a sudden you just feel
[02:27:44.390 --> 02:27:46.510]  like you're running on a higher octane.
[02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:50.070]  And everybody that I know that's moving towards this
[02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:53.870]  can't thank me or whoever's told them about it enough
[02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:55.750]  where it's like, it's their experience.
[02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:56.870]  They're doing it how some people
[02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:58.790]  that can achieve it through just keto.
[02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:02.870]  I like more of like the time restrictive thing
[02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:04.230]  because then it doesn't really matter
[02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:06.230]  what you're eating within moderation.
[02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:07.710]  You know, and I can just enjoy life
[02:28:07.710 --> 02:28:11.190]  and not talk about always having to eat salad or something.
[02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:13.230]  You know, that was the only way in the South
[02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:14.590]  that you would learn how to lose weight
[02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:17.010]  is supposedly you just eat salad all day.
[02:28:18.330 --> 02:28:19.870]  Nobody talked about the ranch dressing
[02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:23.150]  have more calories than the hamburger and all that.
[02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.990]  Yeah.
[02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:25.710]  Yeah.
[02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:30.550]  I've done a few like longer fasts
[02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:35.550]  and by far the hardest thing I've ever done.
[02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:40.630]  I've done multiple like four day, like water fasts.
[02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:46.110]  I've done multiple like five day fast.
[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:50.670]  Like, so my longest one was a week long dry fast.
[02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:52.230]  So no water either.
[02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:55.670]  And that was the most profound experience
[02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:58.390]  I've ever had in my life.
[02:28:58.390 --> 02:29:03.390]  Just of, I guess, connection
[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:07.430]  to just like everything and all that is
[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:09.390]  and getting into those deeper,
[02:29:09.390 --> 02:29:14.390]  like it's a very spiritual experience, you know?
[02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:17.510]  So yeah, but-
[02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:18.830]  Do you mind sharing what,
[02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:21.550]  so what is the benefit of not drinking water?
[02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:27.830]  So water, I'm not really an expert on this,
[02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:31.830]  but it just water slows down like the healing process still.
[02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:35.950]  So anyone who's like interested in dry fasting,
[02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:39.110]  I really recommend looking up fasting
[02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:41.390]  with Trevor on Instagram.
[02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:46.390]  And he is like a dry fasting, like just God.
[02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:51.310]  He has done multiple 20 day dry fast,
[02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:52.790]  no food, no water.
[02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:56.870]  And it's really incredible.
[02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:59.190]  So, you know, at the end of the day,
[02:29:59.190 --> 02:30:00.830]  I'm not really sure like,
[02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:03.670]  and he does this to like heal, you know, from-
[02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:04.670]  You're blowing my mind right now.
[02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:07.870]  So is he like living life with no water?
[02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:10.150]  Like say he's running errands, living his life.
[02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:13.510]  Yeah, he's on Instagram and he like posts all of it,
[02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:15.910]  like on Instagram too, definitely look him up.
[02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:17.470]  Like he has so much-
[02:30:17.470 --> 02:30:19.310]  What was it, fasting with Trevor?
[02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:20.430]  Fasting with Trevor, yeah.
[02:30:20.430 --> 02:30:24.750]  He is like incredible, amazing information out there
[02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:26.390]  about dry fasting.
[02:30:26.390 --> 02:30:28.870]  And he hosts a lot of dry fast as well.
[02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:30.710]  Like he'll do community dry fast.
[02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:34.470]  And I like to do those as well when he does that.
[02:30:34.470 --> 02:30:35.630]  And he'll do live.
[02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:38.550]  So he'll explain the entire process
[02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:41.670]  and what's going on in the body while you're dry fasting
[02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:44.190]  and just the different things that are happening
[02:30:44.190 --> 02:30:47.270]  and different things you can heal from dry fasting,
[02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:48.510]  which is pretty much everything.
[02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:51.190]  You can pretty much heal everything except from dry fasting.
[02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:54.870]  So, you know, on my dry fast,
[02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:58.430]  I specifically did that to heal from a chronic
[02:30:58.430 --> 02:31:02.150]  bladder infection that I was experiencing.
[02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:07.150]  And the first few days of the dry fast,
[02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:11.550]  I was experiencing like the worst bladder pain ever.
[02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:15.710]  And then I got past a certain point and it went away.
[02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:17.630]  And, you know, as far as I know,
[02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:19.950]  I haven't had it back since this happened.
[02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:22.830]  So I'm hoping that I was able to heal it
[02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:25.190]  through that dry fasting process.
[02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:28.230]  This is blowing my mind.
[02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:32.630]  So how are you able to stay functional?
[02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:35.630]  Because, you know, after a week of no water, I mean,
[02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:37.990]  I would say a lot of people believe
[02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:40.910]  that you're starting to get in the danger zone.
[02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:43.710]  Yeah, I mean, definitely like listen to your body.
[02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:44.910]  Like everyone is different.
[02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:49.550]  I have done multiple fasts leading up to this,
[02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:53.190]  like water fasts and juice fasts, like leading up to this.
[02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:55.310]  So you have to prepare your body as well.
[02:31:55.310 --> 02:31:56.630]  You can't really just like,
[02:31:56.630 --> 02:32:00.030]  that's it's just not something that you can just jump into.
[02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:03.950]  You kind of have to like prepare your body for this as well.
[02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:07.910]  So that's a very important piece to it.
[02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:11.830]  And just, you know, always do it with the intention of like,
[02:32:12.190 --> 02:32:15.110]  healing something or, you know,
[02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:19.470]  cause I just, I don't know how necessary like fasting is
[02:32:19.470 --> 02:32:21.470]  unless you have like, you know,
[02:32:21.470 --> 02:32:25.310]  something that you're specifically trying to heal
[02:32:25.310 --> 02:32:28.110]  or doing these longer dry fasts anyways.
[02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:30.310]  Like I don't really know why you would do them
[02:32:30.310 --> 02:32:33.910]  unless you have like something that,
[02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:35.950]  something kind of serious that's bugging you
[02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:38.430]  that you really want to try and heal from.
[02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:44.270]  Because I truly think you can still be healthy and,
[02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:49.790]  you know, detox with proper diet as well.
[02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:55.990]  You don't necessarily like need to fast to detox,
[02:32:57.790 --> 02:33:01.510]  but doing these longer dry fasts just helps you,
[02:33:03.310 --> 02:33:05.110]  helps progress the healing process.
[02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:10.110]  So it just helps you achieve health quicker.
[02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:14.430]  If you're in a place where you're not healthy.
[02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:16.150]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:17.830]  And for those out there, I mean,
[02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:19.430]  the human body heals pretty quick.
[02:33:19.430 --> 02:33:22.710]  So autophagy, some people say between 16,
[02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:27.110]  I've always kind of just kicked it more to 18 hours for sure.
[02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:29.990]  So, you know, that autophagy is kicking in at 18 hours.
[02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:32.630]  So just even a 24 hour fast,
[02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:35.190]  you're going to see improvements.
[02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:37.830]  So building up to that aspect,
[02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:40.070]  I've never gotten longer than four days to be honest.
[02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:44.150]  That's 20 days without water to me just,
[02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:51.150]  sounds like it would be almost a DMT trip or something.
[02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:54.270]  That you would start probably hallucinating.
[02:33:54.270 --> 02:33:55.910]  That's what he talks about too.
[02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:59.830]  It is like a very spiritual experience.
[02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:02.870]  You pretty much leave this world.
[02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:05.950]  And yeah, I mean, if you're doing a longer dry fast
[02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:10.470]  like that, you can't really move.
[02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:12.070]  You're not going to be moving around much.
[02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:13.590]  You're not going to be doing much.
[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:15.630]  You just kind of have to literally sit there.
[02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:17.430]  Oh, okay, I misunderstood what you were saying.
[02:34:17.430 --> 02:34:20.190]  Literally don't run for, what?
[02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:21.750]  I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying.
[02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:24.510]  So when you're deeper into these fasts,
[02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:27.230]  you can't be running errands and all that kind of stuff.
[02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:28.070]  Okay, I misunderstood.
[02:34:28.390 --> 02:34:29.870]  You gotta take the time off.
[02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:32.390]  You were blowing my mind
[02:34:32.390 --> 02:34:34.830]  because I was like, well, how in the hell?
[02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:36.550]  I mean, you could, it's good to go.
[02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:39.030]  Like you shouldn't just lay there.
[02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:42.030]  You should try and go for a while.
[02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:43.790]  You're healing yourself at this point.
[02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:44.630]  Yeah.
[02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:45.910]  You're not living your life.
[02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:49.390]  Exactly, you want to take the time off and be resting.
[02:34:49.390 --> 02:34:52.350]  You don't want to be thinking about a million things.
[02:34:52.350 --> 02:34:55.230]  And part of the healing experience
[02:34:55.230 --> 02:34:57.470]  is having nothing to do
[02:34:57.870 --> 02:35:00.670]  because as humans, we just get so caught up
[02:35:00.670 --> 02:35:03.150]  and I need to do this next, I need to do this next.
[02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:06.230]  And it's like part of that is slowing down
[02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:09.990]  and being okay with just being here now.
[02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:13.830]  Yeah, I mean, that's, I don't know,
[02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:16.590]  the older I get, the more I really just cherish being here.
[02:35:16.590 --> 02:35:18.150]  It's a pretty cool place.
[02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:19.190]  Yeah.
[02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:20.790]  Especially at night, looking up
[02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:23.790]  through my 20s and 30s, pretty much.
[02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:25.870]  I don't think I really focused on anything
[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:30.350]  other than material things, it felt like.
[02:35:30.350 --> 02:35:33.270]  As I'm getting older, it's like, who gives a shit, really?
[02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:34.430]  There's a lot to learn.
[02:35:35.390 --> 02:35:40.390]  So fasting and DMT, cool simon.
[02:35:40.390 --> 02:35:43.830]  I mean, if you're really trying to change your viewpoint
[02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:46.670]  and look at life in a different way,
[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:49.670]  strap in, buddy, and check it out.
[02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:53.590]  I wish everybody would try DMT
[02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:55.830]  from the blast off point of view.
[02:35:55.830 --> 02:36:00.190]  Here in Denver, people are doing it in the clubs.
[02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:02.430]  I don't really consider that a DMT trip
[02:36:02.430 --> 02:36:05.690]  because you're just standing there talking to everybody.
[02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:08.030]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:36:09.390 --> 02:36:12.350]  They're hitting it from the pens, they claim it's DMT.
[02:36:12.350 --> 02:36:14.550]  Whatever that is, I don't feel like it's the same thing.
[02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:17.670]  But if you're able to have a real experience
[02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:19.670]  where you can blast off and see,
[02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:22.950]  there's a variety of, from what I understand,
[02:36:23.390 --> 02:36:24.310]  a variety of different entities
[02:36:24.310 --> 02:36:26.150]  that you can potentially see.
[02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:29.230]  The weird thing to me is that everybody
[02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:31.750]  kind of sees some of the same stuff.
[02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:33.910]  That's why it's always intrigued me,
[02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:35.510]  because it's like, well,
[02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:38.550]  if we're kind of all going to the same place,
[02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:41.270]  what place is this?
[02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:44.830]  And I've only been able to do it one time.
[02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:46.870]  Have you been able to experience anything like that?
[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:49.790]  Or have you done like a heroic dose of mushrooms
[02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:52.910]  where you kind of saw life in a new way?
[02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:58.150]  Yeah, I've had my experiences with DMT back in Colorado.
[02:36:58.150 --> 02:37:03.150]  And yeah, I mean, I feel like I wish I would have done it
[02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:07.270]  in like the first time I did it,
[02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:12.190]  like we did like yoga and meditation beforehand.
[02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:14.150]  But like the other times that I did it,
[02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:17.150]  it was just like the intention
[02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:18.950]  really wasn't there behind it.
[02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:22.270]  And I had a profound experience still,
[02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:26.750]  but yeah, I just think they should be used
[02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:28.910]  with like a lot of intention,
[02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:30.790]  like moving forward in my life.
[02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:35.110]  Like that's how I choose to like use those
[02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:36.990]  certain like plant medicines.
[02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.830]  So.
[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:41.510]  Yeah, I like to read online and stuff.
[02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:45.390]  And people have even said they started to abuse DMT
[02:37:45.390 --> 02:37:47.590]  and the entities, if you will,
[02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:50.190]  called them like, yo, you're not allowed in here anymore
[02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:51.470]  until you, you know.
[02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:53.030]  So that stuff's always intrigued me
[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:55.510]  because 10 years ago that everybody had been like,
[02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:57.830]  well, you know, whatever.
[02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:58.670]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:37:58.670 --> 02:38:02.510]  It's kind of like impossible to abuse it, I would know.
[02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:07.350]  Because like once you like smoke DMT like one time,
[02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:09.790]  like the next, if you smoke it in the same night,
[02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:12.710]  the next time you smoke it, you won't blast off.
[02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:14.670]  Like if you can pretty much only blast off
[02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:16.790]  like one time a night, you know,
[02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:18.990]  or within a certain period of time,
[02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:20.630]  I don't know what that period of time would be.
[02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:22.030]  I mean, it probably varies for everyone,
[02:38:22.030 --> 02:38:25.670]  but that's just my personal experience with it.
[02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:29.390]  So you've blasted off like five times in one week?
[02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:31.350]  Probably.
[02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:35.110]  So are you, I'd love to pick your brain
[02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.990]  on this kind of stuff.
[02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:38.470]  So when you're doing that that often,
[02:38:38.470 --> 02:38:39.910]  are you seeing the same things?
[02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:42.350]  Are you like, are the clock elves like,
[02:38:42.350 --> 02:38:44.470]  hey, look at this Alexa, look at this shit.
[02:38:44.470 --> 02:38:46.150]  How about this?
[02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:51.150]  Yeah, so I guess not every like trip
[02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:54.750]  is like necessarily like the same.
[02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:58.150]  Like I didn't see like the little elves
[02:38:58.990 --> 02:39:01.150]  in during each experience,
[02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:05.350]  like kind of it would change a lot.
[02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:09.230]  You know, I've had like, you know,
[02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:11.710]  angels come to me before and just like tell me
[02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:13.590]  like everything's gonna be okay.
[02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:16.870]  And like, you're good and like, you're on the right path
[02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:18.950]  and like things like that.
[02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:22.270]  I've also had them come and say, you're on the wrong path
[02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:24.350]  and like get your shit together.
[02:39:24.350 --> 02:39:29.350]  So it's like, yeah, but honestly I really wasn't,
[02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:31.150]  you know, when I was doing this,
[02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:33.190]  I was just like trying to get fucked up.
[02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:36.990]  I really was not like into the whole like spiritual side.
[02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:41.470]  I would love to do it now, like knowing more so about,
[02:39:41.470 --> 02:39:44.870]  you know, the spiritual realms and really like connecting
[02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:49.550]  with like those other, you know, entities or beings.
[02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:54.550]  So yeah, so I don't really have like too much about it.
[02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:59.550]  I'm just, my experience one time,
[02:39:59.550 --> 02:40:02.430]  I can't imagine doing that shit five times in one week.
[02:40:03.790 --> 02:40:06.790]  It'd be really hard to probably, I don't know.
[02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:08.910]  Maybe it wasn't as strong, I don't know.
[02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:09.750]  But like, you know.
[02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:11.430]  How many grams, well, how did you do it then?
[02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:13.550]  Yeah, cause I don't know enough about this to.
[02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:15.830]  So I don't know, you just like have this, you know,
[02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:17.270]  you put it in like a bowl
[02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:20.070]  and it's just like this white powdery stuff.
[02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:23.430]  And then, God, I can't remember.
[02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:25.110]  I think you laid it with a lighter.
[02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:27.910]  God, this fucking four or five years ago now.
[02:40:29.350 --> 02:40:30.630]  Yeah, I think you just like light it
[02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:32.790]  with a lighter and smoke it.
[02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:35.910]  You know how many grams you were consuming?
[02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:40.030]  I know that like I had like three grams of like powder.
[02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:43.190]  So a little bit goes a long way.
[02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:49.350]  Yeah, I had like this, it was a weird individual.
[02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:51.750]  It's the way that, not individual,
[02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:55.430]  just the way, weird how it's kind of came to fruition.
[02:40:55.430 --> 02:40:56.630]  And the gentleman that guided me, I said,
[02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:58.030]  I wanna blast off.
[02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:59.590]  And he was like, for real?
[02:40:59.590 --> 02:41:02.870]  Yeah, so he had me do five grams.
[02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:05.410]  Each time that I was hitting it was one gram.
[02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:11.190]  And I lost for words to what even,
[02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:16.870]  you know, you blast it off in somebody's house basically.
[02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:20.150]  And you are seeing things that you can't even comprehend
[02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:21.470]  because it's going too fast.
[02:41:21.470 --> 02:41:25.070]  This was at least how I was doing, experienced that.
[02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:26.470]  And then when you come back,
[02:41:26.470 --> 02:41:28.270]  you're not the same person at least.
[02:41:28.270 --> 02:41:29.990]  I mean, you've definitely like,
[02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:34.030]  things are different now from that point of view.
[02:41:34.030 --> 02:41:36.950]  Yeah, so I'm like starting to remember now, okay.
[02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:41.950]  So like, basically like what I feel from DMT anyways,
[02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:44.870]  from like doing those trips and, you know,
[02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:47.470]  not really every time I would like see entities,
[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:49.970]  but like you still like get visuals,
[02:41:49.970 --> 02:41:54.390]  but you just like melt into this like pool of like love
[02:41:54.390 --> 02:41:58.750]  and bliss and like eternal light, I guess.
[02:41:58.750 --> 02:42:00.590]  And that's just kind of like what it feels like,
[02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:05.790]  you're just like melting into this like pool of like love
[02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:07.910]  and eternal bliss.
[02:42:10.390 --> 02:42:14.030]  So, you know, actually I can tell you,
[02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:19.030]  I think I had like a natural DMT release during a dream
[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:24.510]  before, pretty recently actually.
[02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:29.070]  So what had happened was it was, I get weird dreams.
[02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:31.430]  I won't even tell you, cause you'll judge me.
[02:42:31.430 --> 02:42:35.150]  So I was having this like crazy weird dream.
[02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:38.430]  And then all of a sudden I hear this voice
[02:42:38.430 --> 02:42:42.790]  and it's like, look into the face of God.
[02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:45.910]  And so I like look up into this light.
[02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:49.810]  And then all of a sudden I like feel just like,
[02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:53.430]  like I'm on DMT, like I'm melting into this puddle
[02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:58.230]  of just like love and bliss and just like, I don't know,
[02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:00.030]  like pure existence.
[02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:03.950]  It's a hard thing to describe because it's like,
[02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:06.190]  just like out of this world,
[02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:09.450]  like amazing pleasurable experience.
[02:43:09.450 --> 02:43:12.270]  And so this was happening while I was dreaming.
[02:43:12.270 --> 02:43:16.430]  So I'm like melting into this like light of pool of bliss.
[02:43:16.430 --> 02:43:20.430]  And then I thought I died or something.
[02:43:20.430 --> 02:43:21.790]  I was like, well, this is it.
[02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:23.230]  I just looked into the light.
[02:43:23.230 --> 02:43:24.050]  You know what I mean?
[02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:28.030]  I'm in like whatever, you know, this eternal light now.
[02:43:28.830 --> 02:43:29.670]  And then I woke up and I was like,
[02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:32.070]  whoa, what the fuck just happened?
[02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:36.870]  Like, you know, I must've just had a DMT release in my dream
[02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:40.390]  so it was just kind of a funny, weird experience.
[02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:42.550]  Like we make this shit naturally.
[02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:47.550]  So, and you know, certain practices of like yoga,
[02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:50.230]  like Kundalini yoga and stuff,
[02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:55.230]  you like do certain movements to like get these,
[02:43:55.510 --> 02:44:00.230]  get your body to produce these like natural chemicals,
[02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:05.230]  like DMT and like morphine and all the good chemicals,
[02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:08.970]  you know, just naturally.
[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:12.790]  I appreciate you sharing this.
[02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:15.770]  Cause you know, if you've never experienced this stuff,
[02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:18.030]  I mean, it probably sounds, I guess however,
[02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:22.070]  but I encourage you to keep an open mind because
[02:44:22.390 --> 02:44:26.150]  I know a lot of people see the same stuff,
[02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:29.430]  have the same experience, you know,
[02:44:29.430 --> 02:44:31.990]  it's definitely a benevolent feeling,
[02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:33.310]  not a malevolent feeling.
[02:44:33.310 --> 02:44:37.730]  And I think if you understand that going into it,
[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:41.630]  then you'd probably maybe be more open-minded to it.
[02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:45.230]  Where if you're doing like heavy hits of strong acid
[02:44:45.230 --> 02:44:47.190]  and your mindset isn't ready,
[02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:49.390]  I've seen people lose their shit on that.
[02:44:49.390 --> 02:44:54.350]  Where, you know, I don't see that with DMT,
[02:44:54.350 --> 02:44:57.070]  but granted the only time I've ever,
[02:44:57.070 --> 02:44:59.170]  I've done it one time and then seen other people do it.
[02:44:59.170 --> 02:45:01.830]  And they always seem like they, you know,
[02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:03.930]  had a life changing experience.
[02:45:03.930 --> 02:45:07.030]  That's why I finally felt like I manned up and tried it.
[02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:10.030]  Cause when everybody's doing it in the room
[02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:11.830]  and I went second to last, I mean,
[02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:14.790]  it's you're kind of sitting there like, where the fuck?
[02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:16.470]  Yeah.
[02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:21.970]  So gosh, what was I gonna say?
[02:45:23.430 --> 02:45:26.470]  Well, have you done a like heavier doses of psilocybin?
[02:45:26.470 --> 02:45:27.310]  Was that help?
[02:45:27.310 --> 02:45:30.310]  Has that helped you with like other addictions?
[02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:31.630]  And.
[02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:35.430]  So I don't know,
[02:45:35.430 --> 02:45:38.870]  but I've definitely had bad trips before.
[02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:39.830]  Oh, you know what?
[02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:43.430]  I will say, when I quit booze,
[02:45:43.430 --> 02:45:48.430]  I actually used weed to stop drinking.
[02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:53.230]  So like, I just started eating a bunch of edibles
[02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:55.710]  instead of drinking.
[02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:58.070]  And then, you know, for a few months I was doing that.
[02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:59.830]  And then I realized I was like, all right,
[02:45:59.830 --> 02:46:02.430]  this is like not as, you know,
[02:46:02.430 --> 02:46:04.630]  this is like basically the same as drinking.
[02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:05.470]  You know what I mean?
[02:46:05.470 --> 02:46:07.730]  I'm still like getting fucked up and, you know,
[02:46:07.730 --> 02:46:12.730]  not like fully just like being my, you know, self, I guess.
[02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:17.190]  I'm always like masking with some like substance
[02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:18.030]  or something.
[02:46:18.030 --> 02:46:20.430]  So I'm like, okay, I need to stop doing this too.
[02:46:20.430 --> 02:46:22.910]  So, you know, eventually like quit doing that.
[02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:27.910]  And I used kombucha as well for that process as well.
[02:46:28.390 --> 02:46:31.750]  So those are like the two things that, you know,
[02:46:31.750 --> 02:46:34.350]  I guess I would recommend for people
[02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:36.310]  if they're trying to quit drinking.
[02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:39.190]  Like if that's a problem for someone,
[02:46:39.190 --> 02:46:41.830]  it was definitely a problem for me for a while.
[02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:45.230]  So, yeah.
[02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:48.310]  Yeah, many people have done that and kudos to them.
[02:46:48.310 --> 02:46:50.910]  Yeah, I think, you know, at some point,
[02:46:50.910 --> 02:46:54.590]  hopefully you learn in life that your body starts to hurt
[02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:56.350]  if you're abusing it all the time.
[02:46:57.470 --> 02:46:59.590]  The cool thing I learned as you're getting older too,
[02:46:59.590 --> 02:47:02.150]  is it kind of regenerates every seven years.
[02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:06.990]  So if you focus on a new path, you'll feel it.
[02:47:06.990 --> 02:47:10.430]  And autophagy to get back to kind of that last aspect,
[02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:13.870]  when you're doing that and then fasting
[02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:16.510]  and kind of focused on maybe just having
[02:47:16.510 --> 02:47:20.390]  a healthier lifestyle, it is a noticeable change.
[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:23.550]  You almost kind of forget how good you can feel.
[02:47:24.510 --> 02:47:26.630]  Maybe when you're probably like 10 years old or something,
[02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:28.190]  you know how like nothing hurt.
[02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:31.710]  With autophagy, I'm starting to experience that.
[02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:32.790]  Yes, things still hurt.
[02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:34.950]  You have inflammation and stuff.
[02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:37.870]  But I used to even have like a cyst on my,
[02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:39.910]  on this hand right here.
[02:47:40.390 --> 02:47:41.230]  It's still kind of right there.
[02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:42.550]  It's like a little bubble,
[02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:44.870]  but it used to be pretty predominant.
[02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:47.950]  And through autophagy, I've noticed that that's gone down,
[02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:51.750]  which is, I mean, I sometimes have to just visually
[02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:54.190]  see something and then you got me hook, line and sinker.
[02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:56.310]  And you're like, I'm into it.
[02:47:56.310 --> 02:47:58.310]  Which is what happened for me for living soil.
[02:47:58.310 --> 02:48:02.070]  Because, you know, it was really hard to pay the bills
[02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:03.910]  when everybody wants to lowball you
[02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:05.870]  when you're trying to grow weed,
[02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:08.390]  especially in Colorado at that, you know, everybody,
[02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:10.510]  fuck, everybody had like a friend or somebody
[02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:13.150]  that was now, you know, how long they've been growing?
[02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:14.910]  Oh man, three months, five months.
[02:48:14.910 --> 02:48:17.030]  You know, it is because everybody had just started
[02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:18.190]  when things went real.
[02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:23.470]  But the real ones that have made it last,
[02:48:23.470 --> 02:48:25.990]  in my opinion, were the ones that always seemed humble
[02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:28.390]  and continued to educate themselves.
[02:48:28.390 --> 02:48:29.510]  Totally.
[02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:30.910]  Yeah, and I will add this too,
[02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:34.510]  because I think this is like a big piece to my story
[02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:37.190]  lately as well in my health journey
[02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:40.990]  is that I was like vegan and plant-based.
[02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:43.430]  Well, I was plant-based for a long time.
[02:48:43.430 --> 02:48:47.470]  And then I went vegan for about a year
[02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:52.470]  and my hair started falling out like crazy, massive less.
[02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:55.190]  Like I have never seen before.
[02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:57.230]  Like I lost pretty much all my hair.
[02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:59.870]  And I started seeking advice from others.
[02:48:59.870 --> 02:49:03.750]  Cause I was like, you know, I'm a fucking vegan.
[02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:06.830]  Like it's mostly raw vegan, like just fruit.
[02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:08.310]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:10.510]  And I was like, how could, you know,
[02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:14.270]  how could I be, you know, losing all this hair?
[02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:17.950]  Like I'm literally eating the most nutritious diet I could.
[02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:23.870]  And then I was talking to my friend, Biodynamic Ben.
[02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:25.230]  His name is Ben.
[02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:30.150]  And he is just like a wealth of knowledge about health.
[02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:33.670]  And, you know, he's also a cannabis advocate.
[02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:37.750]  He's one who really helped me
[02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:39.950]  with the understanding I have today
[02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:43.270]  about our diet and stuff.
[02:49:43.270 --> 02:49:46.750]  So he told me that, you know,
[02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:50.550]  he introduced me to more so like the Weston Price
[02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:54.110]  philosophies of, you know, eating animal products
[02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:57.390]  and nutrient dense foods.
[02:49:57.390 --> 02:50:00.630]  And so I started eating animal products again
[02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:05.070]  and almost right away, my hair started, stopped falling out.
[02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:06.870]  And I was like, wow, okay.
[02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:10.910]  Like there's, you know, obviously something to this.
[02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:14.230]  And you know, what I realized is that,
[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:18.110]  and I knew this too while I was on like the vegan fruit diet.
[02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:23.110]  And I realized that a lot of the food that, you know,
[02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:27.030]  I was buying was getting picked on ripe
[02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:30.350]  and shipped, you know, across the world.
[02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:34.630]  And that's seriously decreasing, you know,
[02:50:34.630 --> 02:50:37.070]  the amount of nutrients that could be in there.
[02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:39.710]  And not to mention, you know, our soils are depleted.
[02:50:39.710 --> 02:50:43.550]  So there's just so many factors working against, you know,
[02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:46.470]  me getting any sort of nutrient density
[02:50:46.470 --> 02:50:49.390]  out of like the fruit and produce that I'm buying.
[02:50:49.390 --> 02:50:54.390]  So, you know, and I also realized that this diet,
[02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:58.270]  you know, they kind of say that, you know,
[02:50:58.270 --> 02:51:00.910]  the vegan diet is like the least harmful diet,
[02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:04.750]  but like in our systems in society, like, you know,
[02:51:04.750 --> 02:51:09.750]  we have to think about who is like producing this fruit
[02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:14.070]  and produce and, you know, most likely it's,
[02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:17.710]  there are people, you know, on slave wages who, you know,
[02:51:17.710 --> 02:51:20.270]  in third world countries who are like, you know,
[02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:21.110]  picking this fruit.
[02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:24.550]  So it's not, I would say like, it's not,
[02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:28.950]  veganism isn't necessarily like a harm free option.
[02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:35.070]  And so lately I've just been focusing on supporting,
[02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:40.270]  or, you know, just nutrient density and buying local
[02:51:41.230 --> 02:51:45.550]  and supporting the local community and buying like
[02:51:45.550 --> 02:51:48.070]  fresh compost grown local produce,
[02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:52.510]  as long as like, as well as regenerative grass fed meats
[02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:57.550]  and dairy and fermented foods as well.
[02:51:58.430 --> 02:52:02.630]  So, yeah, I just wanted to kind of share that piece
[02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:03.910]  in my journey.
[02:52:03.910 --> 02:52:06.950]  Maybe it will be helpful for others as well,
[02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:09.310]  but that's what I'm saying about, you know,
[02:52:09.310 --> 02:52:12.470]  fermenting and shedding these layers and paradigms
[02:52:12.470 --> 02:52:17.470]  and beliefs and not, never stopping the learning process
[02:52:18.390 --> 02:52:20.270]  and evolving.
[02:52:21.270 --> 02:52:22.910]  Yeah, I really appreciate you sharing that.
[02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:25.550]  Cause that's not, that's not usually the headlines,
[02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:26.750]  but behind the scenes,
[02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:29.470]  a lot of people kind of feel that way
[02:52:29.470 --> 02:52:31.110]  and have felt it in themselves.
[02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:34.750]  Some of my friends that went vegan,
[02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:37.230]  they just kind of had a, I don't know,
[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:40.710]  their attitude and things changed and looking that,
[02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:42.390]  you know, they felt like it was because they started
[02:52:42.390 --> 02:52:44.550]  taking in like more soy.
[02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:47.030]  So they started to actually kind of change the chemistry
[02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:49.910]  of who they were as a person.
[02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:53.710]  So, you know, again, like it's your life,
[02:52:53.710 --> 02:52:58.590]  but if you're a man, I would really second guess
[02:52:58.590 --> 02:53:02.310]  taking in a lot of soy other than like miso soup
[02:53:02.310 --> 02:53:04.950]  or something that's like a fermented tofu.
[02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:06.510]  What I understand if it's fermented again,
[02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:07.910]  hey, it's still a good thing,
[02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:10.510]  but if you're just eating like raw soy or soy milk
[02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:13.190]  and all that, you're going to get a bunch of estrogen
[02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:16.510]  build up and just research it for yourself.
[02:53:16.510 --> 02:53:19.750]  Obviously, you know, no one here is a doctor or anything,
[02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:23.030]  but there's a lot of evidence to prove
[02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:25.030]  that you should research that at least.
[02:53:26.270 --> 02:53:27.790]  And veganism is the same way.
[02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:30.510]  I think it's, you know, and then, you know,
[02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:33.270]  this whole carnivore diet where some people
[02:53:33.270 --> 02:53:35.350]  have had success with that, some people haven't.
[02:53:35.350 --> 02:53:38.550]  I think it's just interesting to see that the human body
[02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:41.110]  can kind of adapt to a lot of things.
[02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:42.950]  There's even supposedly now the human body
[02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:46.030]  that's kind of adapting to people that eat
[02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:48.750]  like McDonald's and stuff every single day.
[02:53:48.750 --> 02:53:51.310]  Like their body's finding ways to break that down
[02:53:51.310 --> 02:53:53.990]  into nutrition because otherwise,
[02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:56.990]  probably like your hair's falling out and stuff.
[02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:58.790]  When you're missing your macros, same thing,
[02:53:58.790 --> 02:54:00.430]  you're having deficiencies.
[02:54:00.430 --> 02:54:02.270]  And that's probably what you were missing out on
[02:54:02.270 --> 02:54:07.270]  is all of the extras that come from eating meat.
[02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:11.590]  Yeah, and like adapting to our environment,
[02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:13.910]  that's like a very like interesting piece
[02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:15.270]  that you brought up there.
[02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:18.390]  And something I really wanted to talk to Leighton
[02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:21.870]  about is like viruses and how, you know,
[02:54:21.870 --> 02:54:26.870]  our understanding of viruses is completely flawed.
[02:54:29.470 --> 02:54:34.470]  And, you know, viruses are kind of like this,
[02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:40.830]  they're needed for our continued adaptation on earth.
[02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:45.190]  And they're like the mechanism to which we're able
[02:54:45.230 --> 02:54:50.030]  to continue to adapt to our ever-increasing
[02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:51.510]  toxic environment.
[02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:54.590]  So yeah, I don't know.
[02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:57.310]  I know we can't really get into that too much,
[02:54:57.310 --> 02:55:01.110]  but yeah, it's just like really important.
[02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:03.310]  It's just like really interesting how,
[02:55:03.310 --> 02:55:05.390]  and Zach Bush talks about this too,
[02:55:05.390 --> 02:55:08.950]  and he has a really good talk on viruses,
[02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:13.950]  but just how they are a mechanism of communication
[02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:16.750]  between, you know, microbes.
[02:55:16.750 --> 02:55:19.470]  And, you know, when we get sick,
[02:55:19.470 --> 02:55:23.790]  it's just like, we have to think of it like a viral update.
[02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:25.790]  So, you know, when we get sick,
[02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:30.790]  it's just like we're getting sick to adjust or adapt
[02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:37.950]  to something that has changed in our environment.
[02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:42.750]  To help our bodies deal with the extreme
[02:55:42.750 --> 02:55:47.430]  environmental conditions that we're creating.
[02:55:50.470 --> 02:55:51.310]  So yeah.
[02:55:51.310 --> 02:55:52.750]  Yeah, well said.
[02:55:52.750 --> 02:55:54.110]  And if you're getting sick all the time,
[02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:57.270]  usually you have low zinc levels and low vitamin D.
[02:55:57.270 --> 02:55:59.790]  So it's an easy fix that you might be wondering
[02:55:59.790 --> 02:56:01.310]  what the hell's going on.
[02:56:01.310 --> 02:56:04.070]  I experienced that when I was playing online poker
[02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:06.350]  for a living and never went outside
[02:56:06.350 --> 02:56:09.190]  and experienced the worst health of my life.
[02:56:10.510 --> 02:56:11.630]  So just little things.
[02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:14.990]  I mean, that one little element and then boom, sunlight.
[02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:17.670]  Who would have thought, feel dramatically different.
[02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:20.110]  Well, I wanted to maybe throw up
[02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:23.270]  with a few quick questions for the audience.
[02:56:23.270 --> 02:56:24.590]  And I do want to respect your time.
[02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:26.790]  We usually try to keep it at three hours.
[02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:30.150]  So, and I guess I'll hold you to the fire here.
[02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:32.390]  If you're willing to come back next week,
[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:34.470]  then we can do another back to back.
[02:56:34.470 --> 02:56:36.870]  And I would imagine Leighton's there.
[02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:40.710]  I'll reach out to Leighton to make sure he's there
[02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:44.030]  There's a whole soy tofu conversation
[02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:46.590]  going on in the YouTube chat right now.
[02:56:46.590 --> 02:56:47.670]  Excellent.
[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:49.510]  People should talk about that research it.
[02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:51.190]  And you know, I mean, of course
[02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:53.070]  you're entitled to your viewpoint,
[02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:55.470]  but there's a lot of also research out there
[02:56:55.470 --> 02:56:58.990]  that if you're a grown man and you're consuming that,
[02:56:58.990 --> 02:57:02.190]  you're fucking up your chemistry as a man.
[02:57:02.190 --> 02:57:04.070]  Well, like me and my farts,
[02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:08.790]  Blue thinks his own tofu is amazing.
[02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:13.910]  But I would imagine Blue Green is fermenting that.
[02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:18.190]  Yeah, I just think like, it all comes back to like balance.
[02:57:18.190 --> 02:57:20.750]  I'm not saying like anything's like bad or good
[02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:24.510]  because you know, it's just like what they say in Jidam.
[02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:25.350]  You know what I mean?
[02:57:25.350 --> 02:57:27.390]  The good and the bad are one.
[02:57:27.390 --> 02:57:30.990]  So it's just like too much of a good thing is bad.
[02:57:30.990 --> 02:57:35.350]  And I just always strive for balance with things.
[02:57:35.350 --> 02:57:37.870]  You know, too much fasting is bad.
[02:57:38.470 --> 02:57:42.230]  Eating too much of anything is bad.
[02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:45.030]  So it's just all about balance.
[02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:47.990]  And I'm, you know, I don't, yeah,
[02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:49.630]  I don't like to demonize anything.
[02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:53.790]  I'm not a strict, rigid against anything.
[02:57:53.790 --> 02:57:55.750]  I'm all for a little bit of everything.
[02:57:59.470 --> 02:58:01.310]  Good grow your own soybeans.
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:06.620]  Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, it's up to you.
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:08.980]  It's up to you how you want to take in your protein and stuff.
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:11.140]  But yeah, I would ferment that stuff.
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:15.580]  People want some more fermenting knowledge drops.
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:17.420]  Huh, fermenting.
[02:58:19.180 --> 02:58:20.740]  Gosh, so like I said,
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:23.620]  I'm still really getting into this myself.
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:28.860]  Again, Chandler let me borrow this.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:31.500]  Sandor Katz.
[02:58:35.140 --> 02:58:37.020]  The art of fermentation.
[02:58:37.020 --> 02:58:40.740]  And that's like the fermentation Bible.
[02:58:40.740 --> 02:58:42.660]  I'm just, you know, as I flipped through it,
[02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:45.860]  it's just like, wow, so much information there.
[02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:50.500]  And if you want to know like my process
[02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:55.500]  for like fermenting like sauerkraut in general,
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:02.700]  I, you know, I just chop up cabbages.
[02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:05.380]  You can get really fancy with your recipe
[02:59:05.420 --> 02:59:07.540]  and like the things that you're doing,
[02:59:07.540 --> 02:59:10.660]  but I keep it super basic typically.
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:15.060]  So just like, you know, you could just do it with cabbage
[02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:18.700]  and, you know, you put a good amount of salt on there.
[02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:23.620]  Like I'd say for one cabbage,
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:28.620]  I'm using probably like three to four tablespoons of salt
[02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:30.140]  to make the brine.
[02:59:31.100 --> 02:59:35.900]  And I use pink Himalayan sea salt to do this.
[02:59:35.900 --> 02:59:40.900]  And so you just like massage the cabbage with the salt
[02:59:42.540 --> 02:59:46.460]  and all the water from the cabbage
[02:59:46.460 --> 02:59:50.020]  is kind of extracted from there
[02:59:50.020 --> 02:59:53.740]  because of the salt present,
[02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:55.900]  pulling it out of the cabbage.
[02:59:55.900 --> 02:59:58.860]  And that's what creates the brine.
[02:59:58.860 --> 03:00:02.580]  So then you'll just stuff that into your jars.
[03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:07.580]  And I cover mine with a piece of leaf.
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:10.420]  So, you know, you have your Mason jar
[03:00:10.420 --> 03:00:12.220]  and you pack it to like right here
[03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:14.820]  and then you cover it with like a cabbage leaf
[03:00:15.740 --> 03:00:19.980]  and that'll kind of protect it and keep it under the brine.
[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:24.580]  And then I just let that sit with a coffee filter
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:28.780]  over the top of the Mason jar for, you know,
[03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:31.500]  it depends on your weather,
[03:00:31.500 --> 03:00:33.620]  but I usually do mine for about a week
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:35.180]  cause I'm up here in the North.
[03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:40.300]  But if you're somewhere warmer, it might take less time.
[03:00:40.300 --> 03:00:44.460]  And yeah, I mean, it's absolutely delicious
[03:00:44.460 --> 03:00:46.980]  and just one of the healthiest things
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:48.100]  you can put in your body.
[03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:53.100]  Like the microbes in there predigest everything for you.
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:58.760]  So there's a lot of like minerals and nutrients
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:02.360]  in there as well that wouldn't necessarily be available
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:06.160]  right away for you if you didn't ferment it.
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:11.160]  So like fermenting is very nutrient rich as well.
[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:17.700]  You know, in a weird way, I've noticed that even
[03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:21.060]  from just feeding my bunny more cabbage
[03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:24.780]  that the life alone from the probably that is coming out
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:26.060]  through his manure.
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:28.740]  So I can't imagine what the human body
[03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:30.420]  is probably able to achieve.
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:32.380]  Yeah, like microbe rich foods.
[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:34.800]  We have to think about like eating microbes
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:37.000]  instead of like eating food, like seriously,
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.940]  because like the bacteria,
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:42.740]  they're the most nutrient dense thing on the earth, right?
[03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:45.980]  Like they have the highest feed ratio,
[03:01:45.980 --> 03:01:47.640]  so our lowest, whatever.
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:52.460]  So, you know, they're just packed with nutrients
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:57.460]  and yeah, we'll have to get into this medical grade
[03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:00.780]  compost next week with Leighton.
[03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:04.460]  I'm so excited to see what he has to say about,
[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:07.620]  you know, then the protozoa come in and eat these,
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:12.060]  you know, bacteria and make them available for you.
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:15.300]  So yeah, gosh, I'd love to, you know,
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:20.220]  do some more research on that and scope some stool samples
[03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:21.600]  with my microscope.
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:22.440]  Yeah.
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:27.400]  This chick is about it.
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:29.320]  We're gonna stool samples.
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:31.520]  Oh my gosh, Jay, who would have thought?
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:34.960]  Like my girly girl ass one day would be looking
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:37.960]  at stool samples, but you know, here we are.
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.240]  Well that cabbage recipe that you just, I mean,
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:43.680]  if people really focus on that, that can change your life.
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:45.160]  Like seriously.
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:46.000]  Yes.
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:50.040]  We interviewed a guy that had like IBS problems and stuff
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:51.840]  and he was talking about, you know,
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.200]  when he would go to a party,
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:55.200]  he would have to understand where the bathroom was
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:57.160]  and he could never be too far away from it.
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:02:58.000]  Yeah.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Sounds like a horrible existence.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  So to know that you can retrain your body, if you will,
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:07.360]  to kind of run on a whole different system
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:11.080]  just by eating cheap foods compared to spending, you know,
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:15.440]  $80 on probiotics that say like, you know, 50 billion.
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:16.720]  This one's a hundred billion.
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:19.800]  This one's 250 billion where the reality is
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:21.560]  it's probably a lot lower than that.
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:24.560]  And you can achieve relatively the same success
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:29.000]  by just buying a little bit of cabbage and some time.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:29.840]  Totally.
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:32.280]  And another thing too, like I was noticing
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:37.280]  when I was on the vegan diet, I was always bloated
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:40.280]  and always having digestive issues.
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:42.960]  And I'm like, you know, why, how could this be?
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:46.440]  But like our bodies cannot digest like plant fiber.
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:47.940]  You know, they just can't.
[03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:51.980]  It depends, it completely depends on the microbes to do that
[03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:55.760]  and if you don't have like a good microbiome,
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:58.220]  then you know, you're going to have problems.
[03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:01.860]  So that's why like fermenting just helps
[03:04:01.860 --> 03:04:06.380]  like break all that down and makes it so much easier
[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:09.960]  for you to digest also, you know.
[03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:13.580]  Yeah, which is again, it changes your life
[03:04:13.580 --> 03:04:15.220]  because who the hell wants to live
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:17.780]  with their upset stomach though the entire time.
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:22.820]  Have I worked with koji?
[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:23.660]  No.
[03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:25.580]  Like koji berries?
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:26.500]  Is that what it is?
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:28.020]  I think that's goji.
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:30.060]  Oh, goji, right, right.
[03:04:30.060 --> 03:04:35.060]  Koji is a cooked rice, soya bean that have been inoculated
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:40.900]  with a fermentation culture, aspergillus orise.
[03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:42.300]  This naturally occurring culture
[03:04:42.300 --> 03:04:44.020]  is particularly prevalent in Japan
[03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:46.820]  where it is known as koji-ken,
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:48.820]  which explains why so many Japanese foods
[03:04:48.820 --> 03:04:51.220]  have been developed over the centuries using it.
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:56.020]  No, I don't think you're in.
[03:04:57.420 --> 03:04:59.620]  That's an honest answer, we'll move on.
[03:05:01.260 --> 03:05:05.540]  Oh no, no, I'm gonna need a refresh or something.
[03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:06.540]  Okay, wait.
[03:05:06.540 --> 03:05:07.380]  Okay.
[03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:08.620]  Okay, no, I'm good.
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:12.420]  Sorry, I was like hearing myself.
[03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:15.540]  But you know, something cool someone told me
[03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:20.420]  is that you can make lab from like fruit juice and not milk.
[03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:25.100]  So if anyone knows how to do that, please let me know.
[03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:30.020]  I'm super interested in making lab out of fruit juice.
[03:05:31.180 --> 03:05:33.100]  Have you guys heard of that at all?
[03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:35.140]  No.
[03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:41.460]  Sorry, I just had to restart my browser.
[03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:43.260]  Sounds like something we could obviously
[03:05:43.260 --> 03:05:45.140]  kind of go down a rabbit hole on.
[03:05:45.140 --> 03:05:46.740]  Yeah, for real.
[03:05:48.260 --> 03:05:50.420]  Yeah, but I honestly, I'm just getting
[03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:53.620]  into fermenting myself.
[03:05:57.540 --> 03:06:01.020]  So I haven't really experimented,
[03:06:01.020 --> 03:06:04.660]  gotten into anything much deeper
[03:06:04.660 --> 03:06:07.620]  than like sauerkraut and kimchi.
[03:06:08.900 --> 03:06:10.700]  I do kombucha.
[03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:13.660]  I've been making kombucha for a long time.
[03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:17.820]  And I just started getting into water kefir.
[03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:21.460]  So, you know, some people are concerned
[03:06:21.460 --> 03:06:24.980]  about like the sugar and stuff in kombucha.
[03:06:24.980 --> 03:06:29.980]  So the water kefir is kind of a way to avoid the sugar.
[03:06:32.260 --> 03:06:33.620]  Did you see that question?
[03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:35.780]  No, sorry.
[03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:38.220]  Well, I think she was just answering it, right?
[03:06:39.060 --> 03:06:42.020]  It's basically what has she been fermenting, right?
[03:06:42.020 --> 03:06:43.820]  Oh, okay, so I did.
[03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:48.820]  Yeah, sauerkraut, kimchi, I mean, basically the same thing.
[03:06:49.380 --> 03:06:50.860]  And you can get so creative
[03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:52.820]  with your sauerkraut recipes too.
[03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:55.740]  Like you can make like pineapple,
[03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:57.620]  ginger, jalapeno sauerkraut.
[03:06:57.620 --> 03:06:59.500]  Like that's what I'm gonna make next.
[03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:03.500]  But like you can get super creative with it too.
[03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:07.380]  And you know, once you get down the basic cabbage,
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:10.100]  kind of ferment,
[03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:13.740]  then you can really play around with different things.
[03:07:13.740 --> 03:07:14.580]  What was that question?
[03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:15.420]  Sorry.
[03:07:15.420 --> 03:07:17.740]  No, it was just a comment that you could use kombucha
[03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:21.420]  instead of like brown rice vinegar
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:23.860]  or whatever vinegar people use in WCA.
[03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:25.500]  Oh, okay.
[03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:27.500]  I haven't tried that, but.
[03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:29.380]  I could see that working.
[03:07:29.380 --> 03:07:30.220]  Awesome.
[03:07:30.220 --> 03:07:33.580]  So you have a SCOBY at home?
[03:07:33.580 --> 03:07:36.060]  Mm-hmm, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:07:36.100 --> 03:07:39.660]  Yeah, I remember my last kombucha experience
[03:07:39.660 --> 03:07:42.020]  was when I was living in this tiny New York apartment
[03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:44.460]  and my SCOBY just kept getting bigger and bigger.
[03:07:45.740 --> 03:07:46.580]  Yeah.
[03:07:47.860 --> 03:07:50.380]  I do a method called like a continuous brew.
[03:07:50.380 --> 03:07:55.380]  So I have like a big jar
[03:07:55.660 --> 03:08:00.660]  with a siphon on the bottom of it.
[03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:02.860]  And I just keep the SCOBY in there
[03:08:02.860 --> 03:08:06.140]  and I'll just, you know, whenever it's ready,
[03:08:06.140 --> 03:08:09.980]  I'll just make the second ferment.
[03:08:09.980 --> 03:08:11.780]  So I'll just drain from the siphon,
[03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:15.980]  the kombucha into the bottle for the second ferment.
[03:08:15.980 --> 03:08:19.200]  And then I'll just add more cooled down tea to it.
[03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:21.920]  So, you know, you don't have to,
[03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:25.820]  like, I don't know.
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:28.580]  It's just a little bit easier to do it like that
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:33.060]  rather than having like a home for your SCOBYs
[03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:35.380]  and then having another jar
[03:08:35.380 --> 03:08:38.840]  for your actual kombucha tea making.
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:40.180]  So it's kind of just all in one.
[03:08:40.180 --> 03:08:41.860]  And when the SCOBY gets too big,
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:44.380]  I just put it in my compost piles.
[03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:49.380]  Sometimes I'll like blend it up and like just dilute it.
[03:08:51.140 --> 03:08:54.340]  So I kind of like spread it across the whole pile
[03:08:55.060 --> 03:08:59.020]  just to help improve decomposition and stuff.
[03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:03.720]  Did I see another question?
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:07.120]  Yeah, I was looking for,
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:09.200]  I think someone asked about like ferments
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:13.260]  for like applying ferments to plants.
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:18.680]  Yeah, I mean, I think you totally can.
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:22.240]  Just like dilute, I think just like diluting them.
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:27.240]  But honestly, like I, again, with the fermenting,
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.320]  like it's great for like soil building,
[03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:34.680]  but I just don't have a ton of experience
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:38.980]  like feeding like ferments to plants directly.
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:42.200]  Like I'm more into feeding compost extract
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:46.000]  to where there's that full soil food web of diversity
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:48.880]  in there in what I'm feeding the plants.
[03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:52.000]  Whereas like the ferments might,
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:56.180]  they just don't have the full soil food web diversity.
[03:09:57.400 --> 03:10:01.080]  But like maybe adding that to a compost extract
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:02.520]  would be really beneficial.
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:04.300]  I've just never done it.
[03:10:04.300 --> 03:10:07.320]  I think that is something I will do in the future though.
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:12.320]  And that people should definitely try adding those ferments
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:16.760]  to get just another level of biodiversity there
[03:10:16.760 --> 03:10:21.760]  because I'm all for like using these like store-bought
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:30.560]  inoculants of beneficial microbes in small amounts.
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:33.440]  Like you wouldn't use them every time
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:35.840]  because you don't want one species to take over.
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:39.960]  But if you add a little pinch of them to your extract
[03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:44.240]  or your tea, then you're just bringing another layer
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:45.760]  of diversity.
[03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  And I guess it's important to kind of like have like microbes
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:55.960]  that we know have been beneficial in there
[03:10:55.960 --> 03:10:59.720]  and to kind of, because the bacteria do
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:01.940]  like horizontal gene transfer.
[03:11:01.940 --> 03:11:04.920]  So it's like not only inoculum of bacteria,
[03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:08.400]  it's also like an inoculum of DNA.
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:11.740]  So like different intelligence and adaptation potential.
[03:11:14.530 --> 03:11:17.890]  Bars, I'm having you on next week.
[03:11:17.890 --> 03:11:22.890]  I'm so excited, yay.
[03:11:24.530 --> 03:11:26.010]  Yeah, this will be awesome.
[03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:30.410]  Have you played with Jadam herbal solutions?
[03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:32.130]  If so, what's your favorite?
[03:11:35.810 --> 03:11:37.090]  To use as pesticide.
[03:11:37.090 --> 03:11:42.090]  No, I have not done any Jadam herbal solutions
[03:11:44.530 --> 03:11:49.530]  I haven't gotten into fermenting plants yet again
[03:11:51.930 --> 03:11:55.050]  because I was stalled by the anaerobic
[03:11:55.050 --> 03:11:59.370]  versus aerobic Elaine stigma or whatever,
[03:11:59.370 --> 03:12:00.930]  her philosophy there.
[03:12:00.930 --> 03:12:04.650]  So I was kind of hindered by that for a while.
[03:12:04.650 --> 03:12:08.890]  And I didn't necessarily like get into trying
[03:12:08.890 --> 03:12:12.890]  these different ferments, but I used to think
[03:12:13.250 --> 03:12:15.010]  they were like so detrimental.
[03:12:16.290 --> 03:12:20.410]  So now I'm understanding that they are extremely beneficial
[03:12:20.410 --> 03:12:23.710]  and can be used in different ways.
[03:12:24.610 --> 03:12:27.970]  I will say that I have been reading a lot
[03:12:27.970 --> 03:12:32.970]  about how nettle is really good for preventing pests
[03:12:35.250 --> 03:12:37.570]  and just like a million other things also.
[03:12:37.570 --> 03:12:42.570]  So we're doing like a nettle ferment to use for IPM
[03:12:43.010 --> 03:12:46.610]  right now and I think that's gonna be the first ferment
[03:12:46.610 --> 03:12:49.610]  that we'll be spraying on the plants at HIFA.
[03:12:49.610 --> 03:12:52.530]  So that'll be a fun little experiment
[03:12:52.530 --> 03:12:54.890]  and we'll keep you updated on that
[03:12:54.890 --> 03:12:58.670]  and how that goes with testing and stuff.
[03:12:58.670 --> 03:13:03.670]  But yeah, there's a huge benefit to using those,
[03:13:07.050 --> 03:13:10.410]  natural plant terpenes that the plants use
[03:13:10.450 --> 03:13:13.370]  to defend themselves and utilizing plants
[03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:18.230]  like in the grow as well as like companion plants
[03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:20.030]  to do that as well.
[03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:24.490]  So like I've got some lemongrass going in there
[03:13:24.490 --> 03:13:29.450]  and parsley, cilantro, and then using those things
[03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:34.090]  and like making, not necessarily like fermenting it,
[03:13:34.090 --> 03:13:37.290]  but just kind of like letting it sit overnight
[03:13:37.290 --> 03:13:39.530]  and making like a tonic out of it
[03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:41.610]  and then spraying that on the plants.
[03:13:41.610 --> 03:13:43.810]  So you're kind of just like making like a tea,
[03:13:43.810 --> 03:13:46.370]  like a, yeah, I guess like a tea
[03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:53.070]  and just like infusing those terpenes into the water
[03:13:54.810 --> 03:13:57.290]  and then spraying it on the plants.
[03:13:57.290 --> 03:14:00.970]  That's something that's beneficial as well.
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:08.020]  So my mind is blown because I didn't even realize
[03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:13.020]  that you're doing some serious vertical farming
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:15.620]  with raised beds.
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:16.980]  That's insane.
[03:14:16.980 --> 03:14:18.820]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:20.900]  Yeah, that was one of the reasons I reached out
[03:14:20.900 --> 03:14:23.500]  is because we talked about that, I guess,
[03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:25.260]  at the beginning, Peter.
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:30.100]  But yeah, very few people find success doing it like this.
[03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:36.460]  Yeah, so when we get the rest of the crew to come on
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:38.660]  whenever that will be,
[03:14:40.420 --> 03:14:43.740]  we can talk about like the setup and the design
[03:14:43.740 --> 03:14:45.460]  and how that all came together.
[03:14:45.460 --> 03:14:49.820]  I didn't necessarily have much to do
[03:14:49.820 --> 03:14:54.420]  with the actual design of the beds.
[03:14:54.420 --> 03:14:58.980]  I designed like the soil recipe and that,
[03:14:58.980 --> 03:15:01.240]  but it came together.
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:06.240]  Like at first we didn't have those walkways on the,
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:08.020]  on the upper layer.
[03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:11.980]  So that was actually my dad's idea to put those in.
[03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:14.220]  So you'd have to like jump from one to the,
[03:15:14.220 --> 03:15:16.980]  or people would be tempted to jump, right?
[03:15:16.980 --> 03:15:19.740]  Luckily this was before like we had plants in there.
[03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:22.980]  This was like just still when we were like filling the beds.
[03:15:22.980 --> 03:15:26.900]  So we only had to like fill, filling the beds up there.
[03:15:26.900 --> 03:15:29.240]  It was very difficult, let's put it that way.
[03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:33.020]  But luckily we got those in before we were like
[03:15:33.020 --> 03:15:35.780]  officially up and running those like walkways.
[03:15:35.860 --> 03:15:37.820]  And those are really just like life saving.
[03:15:37.820 --> 03:15:40.100]  And we, they are graded,
[03:15:40.100 --> 03:15:42.100]  but we have like those mats on there.
[03:15:42.100 --> 03:15:44.860]  So like, you know, anything that's like on our shoes
[03:15:44.860 --> 03:15:47.780]  or whatever, it won't go down to the plants
[03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:50.420]  on the bottom level.
[03:15:50.420 --> 03:15:51.260]  So.
[03:15:54.450 --> 03:15:55.290]  Damn.
[03:15:56.450 --> 03:15:57.290]  Yeah.
[03:15:57.290 --> 03:16:01.090]  What was the rationale behind the vertical farming?
[03:16:01.090 --> 03:16:02.410]  Is it that you only have a square,
[03:16:02.410 --> 03:16:04.610]  you have a square footage cap and you were like,
[03:16:04.610 --> 03:16:06.170]  well, let's just go up.
[03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:09.290]  Well, you know, the guys like they,
[03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:12.410]  we don't have any like investors and, you know,
[03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:17.410]  it's, you know, kind of a small time, you know,
[03:16:19.410 --> 03:16:22.210]  farmers and we just wanted to like make the most
[03:16:22.210 --> 03:16:26.650]  out of the space as efficiently as possible.
[03:16:26.650 --> 03:16:28.890]  So, yeah.
[03:16:28.890 --> 03:16:30.770]  And we had the tall ceilings too.
[03:16:30.770 --> 03:16:34.370]  So it was like, yeah.
[03:16:34.370 --> 03:16:39.130]  And my partner, he was like the one who like
[03:16:39.130 --> 03:16:42.650]  really designed the building and like put everything
[03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:43.490]  together.
[03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:48.490]  So he'll be the one to talk to about how that
[03:16:49.290 --> 03:16:50.610]  all came together.
[03:16:55.840 --> 03:16:58.040]  No, I think the community is definitely going to be
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:16:59.000]  all ears for that.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:02.920]  Cause nobody's plants on the top tier
[03:17:02.920 --> 03:17:04.240]  I've ever seen look like that.
[03:17:04.240 --> 03:17:05.840]  I mean, there's always deficiencies.
[03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:08.240]  There's some kind of infestation of spider mites
[03:17:08.240 --> 03:17:09.680]  or russet mites.
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:12.040]  And you know, that's why we're there is to trying
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:14.080]  to figure that stuff out.
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:15.880]  But, you know, kudos to your team.
[03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:17.080]  Cause at the end of the day,
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:18.360]  I think a lot of that comes down to,
[03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:20.880]  they just weren't up at the top level as much as they were
[03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:24.440]  at the bottom and things naturally progressed.
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:25.440]  There was issues.
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:27.120]  Yeah.
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:29.120]  I'd love to pick your brain more, you know,
[03:17:29.120 --> 03:17:30.880]  especially with your team.
[03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:33.960]  Cause it does seem like you guys have got it dialed in.
[03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:36.240]  Is there one person who's like the tree monkey
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:39.280]  who spends the bulk of their day just like
[03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:41.360]  on that upper level?
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:42.480]  Yeah.
[03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:44.000]  That's so funny.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:45.240]  Yes, totally.
[03:17:46.440 --> 03:17:48.480]  I mean, it's like they live their life, right?
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:51.360]  Like there's one, there's probably one person who like.
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:52.200]  Yeah.
[03:17:52.200 --> 03:17:53.280]  It's totally my partner.
[03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:56.400]  He's like, he's always like jumping around in there
[03:17:56.400 --> 03:17:58.720]  and like, we can't get them to stop working.
[03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:01.000]  Like we have to like literally like drag him
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  out of the building.
[03:18:02.120 --> 03:18:05.280]  Like, you know, there's always something to do there.
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:09.040]  So he's always like working on projects and fixing stuff
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:10.640]  and trying new things.
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:11.880]  So it's pretty funny.
[03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:17.090]  Cool.
[03:18:17.090 --> 03:18:18.730]  Yeah, it's beautiful and well done.
[03:18:18.730 --> 03:18:21.730]  And I hope more people realize how hard
[03:18:21.730 --> 03:18:23.130]  that is actually to achieve.
[03:18:24.210 --> 03:18:25.050]  Yeah.
[03:18:25.050 --> 03:18:27.930]  And I guess another cool thing I'll just throw out there.
[03:18:27.930 --> 03:18:32.170]  We do reuse all of our water as well.
[03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:38.170]  We, it's all recaptured through the HVAC condensate.
[03:18:40.010 --> 03:18:41.290]  So we just filter that
[03:18:41.290 --> 03:18:44.450]  and that's what goes through the irrigation.
[03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:49.450]  And again, my partner, he's like a HVAC technician as well.
[03:18:50.010 --> 03:18:53.490]  And he installed all the HVAC in there
[03:18:53.490 --> 03:18:55.250]  and installed that system.
[03:18:55.250 --> 03:18:59.650]  So one of the ways we try and be regenerative
[03:18:59.690 --> 03:19:03.290]  is on an indoor, in an indoor space.
[03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:10.240]  Yeah, I mean, when you're putting out a nice size facility,
[03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:13.360]  the AC is the one of the most expensive things.
[03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:16.840]  So to save that and know when you're getting bullshitted
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:18.920]  by those guys, I'm sure, you know,
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:21.600]  he obviously knows the best brand
[03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:23.360]  and the best way to set everything up.
[03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:24.560]  Oh yeah, totally.
[03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:27.280]  So that was like very helpful for them, I know.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:30.360]  Where's the farm at?
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:31.200]  Oh, it's in-
[03:19:31.200 --> 03:19:33.640]  I think he was asking what the idea,
[03:19:33.640 --> 03:19:36.040]  but yeah, where in Michigan is it?
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:41.040]  Kalkaska, up near Traverse City.
[03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:45.680]  That's kind of like the biggest town that's by,
[03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:49.560]  and Traverse City is like the cherry capital of the world.
[03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:51.800]  But we're really lucky because Kalkaska
[03:19:51.800 --> 03:19:54.880]  is like super like cannabis friendly.
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:58.120]  Like they are, they were in a cul-de-sac
[03:19:58.120 --> 03:20:00.760]  of an industrial park that's just filled
[03:20:00.760 --> 03:20:02.400]  with like all these different girls.
[03:20:02.400 --> 03:20:05.360]  So they're really, it's been awesome working
[03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:06.840]  with the township there.
[03:20:06.840 --> 03:20:08.920]  They're, you know, all about, you know,
[03:20:08.920 --> 03:20:12.520]  bringing cannabis in to the community, so.
[03:20:15.880 --> 03:20:18.520]  And you guys weren't just going for degree of difficulty,
[03:20:18.520 --> 03:20:21.160]  like you saw Steve Cantwell and you were like,
[03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:24.520]  we could, let's add a second level to that.
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:29.400]  Oh gosh, no.
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:34.000]  I think, you know, we found Green Life after we,
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.320]  you know, like opened and stuff.
[03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:39.600]  Like again, like I really wasn't like very connected
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:41.480]  with the living soil community at all
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:43.560]  when we were first setting this up.
[03:20:43.560 --> 03:20:46.800]  I kind of got into it as, you know,
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:51.080]  I started growing and things weren't necessarily
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:52.480]  going as planned.
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:56.800]  So I, you know, started like looking and reaching out
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:01.280]  to people and being like, you know, what's going on, so.
[03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:06.600]  You have to tell whoever this is to slow down that camera.
[03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:08.200]  I'm getting dizzy watching this.
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:11.520]  I think we sped it up.
[03:21:15.480 --> 03:21:16.680]  Or is that the monkey man
[03:21:16.680 --> 03:21:20.200]  and that's just his base energy level each day?
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:23.560]  Pretty much, pretty much.
[03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:29.840]  Well, Alexa, I appreciate you coming on the show
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:33.000]  and I guess you get the honor of coming back to back.
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  There's only one other person that's done that, so.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:36.440]  I know, it's perfect.
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:41.080]  Connor, so yeah, I was watching that
[03:21:41.080 --> 03:21:43.120]  and I was laughing at the back to back
[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:48.120]  and I was like, I'm glad I get to do it too.
[03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:49.840]  This is exciting.
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:53.760]  Wow, what an honor to be on here
[03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:57.480]  and to, you know, share what I've learned
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:22:01.680]  because like I said, two years ago, like I, you know,
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:06.680]  I was watching this show to try and learn more
[03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:08.320]  about living in soil.
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:12.000]  So, you know, thank you guys
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.240]  for putting this information out there.
[03:22:14.240 --> 03:22:18.880]  It's just been such a huge part of my journey.
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:23.360]  And yeah, I'm super looking forward to next week now.
[03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:26.680]  Well, it's nice to see too when you're, you know,
[03:22:26.680 --> 03:22:28.560]  now you have a skill set
[03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:30.120]  where you're providing for yourself.
[03:22:30.120 --> 03:22:32.840]  And I think people always kind of excuse like,
[03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:34.800]  oh, we're a small farm.
[03:22:34.800 --> 03:22:36.320]  We don't have any investors.
[03:22:36.320 --> 03:22:37.920]  To me, that's music to my ears.
[03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:40.000]  And then you should obviously wear that with pride.
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.040]  And yeah, that's all I,
[03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:44.520]  that's the only people I wanna talk to.
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:47.000]  Yeah.
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.320]  Same, so thank you for coming on the show
[03:22:49.320 --> 03:22:51.920]  and I look forward to creating a whole new list
[03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:53.720]  of questions for you guys for next week.
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:56.800]  Awesome, excellent, looking forward to it.
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:22:57.920]  Thank you guys.
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:04.640]  And all right, so we'll see you next week
[03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:07.000]  with a crew, with a posse.
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:07.840]  Yeah.
[03:23:08.680 --> 03:23:12.960]  Yeah, so just DM me or Peter who you want part of that
[03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:15.600]  and we'll get it all set up behind the scenes.
[03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:17.680]  Excellent, right on guys.
[03:23:17.680 --> 03:23:19.880]  Well, thank you again.
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:23.760]  Yeah, so much love and blessings to everyone.
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.400]  Thank you all for listening.
[03:23:26.480 --> 03:23:30.640]  Follow me on Instagram, follow Hypha Grown,
[03:23:30.640 --> 03:23:33.520]  follow the Michigan Compost Cup,
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:35.280]  definitely check that out.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:38.720]  It's just an incredible festival,
[03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:41.720]  again, building soil and community.
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:45.240]  We're doing it September 9th through 11th this year
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:47.680]  and the harvest full moon is that weekend.
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:51.200]  So it's just gonna be really fantastic.
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:54.280]  So yeah.
[03:23:54.280 --> 03:23:57.800]  Oh, and if you wanna sponsor the event too,
[03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:02.120]  we're using the sponsorship money
[03:24:02.120 --> 03:24:04.680]  to pay for like a videographer.
[03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:09.120]  So we're able to put all the information online
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:10.240]  so everyone can hear it.
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:12.920]  So even if you're not coming to the festival,
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:16.600]  you can definitely still sponsor us
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:21.600]  and that'll pay for everyone
[03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:23.480]  to be able to see it virtually.
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:28.740]  How much money do you need for that?
[03:24:28.740 --> 03:24:29.740]  It's 120.
[03:24:31.420 --> 03:24:32.700]  I'll be the sponsor.
[03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:33.540]  Cool.
[03:24:35.180 --> 03:24:37.420]  Awesome, yeah, thank you so much.
[03:24:37.420 --> 03:24:40.620]  I would say that I would also sponsor that for 120 bucks.
[03:24:40.620 --> 03:24:43.060]  Wonderful, oh, thank you.
[03:24:43.060 --> 03:24:44.300]  Yes, excellent.
[03:24:44.340 --> 03:24:45.660]  Oh, I thought you were gonna write me.
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:48.420]  So just send us a little invoice with that or whatever
[03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:50.820]  and if we can send it to PayPal or whatever,
[03:24:50.820 --> 03:24:51.740]  that'd be great.
[03:24:51.740 --> 03:24:52.900]  Thank you so much.
[03:24:52.900 --> 03:24:54.580]  Wow, that's incredible, guys.
[03:24:54.580 --> 03:24:55.980]  Really appreciate it.
[03:24:57.380 --> 03:24:59.380]  Awesome, I will.
[03:24:59.380 --> 03:25:00.220]  All right.
[03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:04.980]  So tonight we have Hoat's Herb
[03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:09.980]  at 9 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. Pacific.
[03:25:10.980 --> 03:25:15.980]  Before then, we might have a grow off breeder conversation,
[03:25:18.980 --> 03:25:22.700]  but I need to get super motivated to make that happen.
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:25.180]  That may happen at a later time.
[03:25:25.180 --> 03:25:29.660]  But that could happen at 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific.
[03:25:31.420 --> 03:25:32.820]  That's my email, Stephen.
[03:25:34.340 --> 03:25:36.700]  Oh, yeah, keep the info coming.
[03:25:36.700 --> 03:25:37.860]  I love it.
[03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:42.860]  Yeah, you guys just generously put out all this information
[03:25:42.860 --> 03:25:47.620]  and it's just a wealth of knowledge for everyone.
[03:25:47.620 --> 03:25:49.620]  So thank you again.
[03:25:50.500 --> 03:25:51.340]  Thank you.
[03:25:51.340 --> 03:25:55.820]  I'm so glad that I had something to contribute to this now.
[03:25:55.820 --> 03:25:59.460]  And yeah, again, looking forward to next week.
[03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:04.140]  Another contribution could be nominating another,
[03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:07.420]  we are acutely aware that this is a male
[03:26:07.420 --> 03:26:09.180]  and white male dominated.
[03:26:10.100 --> 03:26:11.980]  It's not intentional,
[03:26:13.660 --> 03:26:16.500]  but if you wanna tell some other women
[03:26:16.500 --> 03:26:20.620]  that you came on and it wasn't so bad,
[03:26:21.860 --> 03:26:23.660]  it wasn't terrible.
[03:26:23.660 --> 03:26:26.020]  Yeah, I mean, hopefully, yeah,
[03:26:26.020 --> 03:26:29.580]  hopefully maybe the women who are hesitant,
[03:26:29.900 --> 03:26:34.380]  seeing me on here that will inspire them
[03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:37.340]  to come on the show as well.
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:38.620]  Moon Mother Hemp.
[03:26:38.620 --> 03:26:43.620]  She has her own podcast and she's like,
[03:26:44.100 --> 03:26:46.820]  oh, I don't want anybody to hear what I have to say.
[03:26:46.820 --> 03:26:48.340]  Why not?
[03:26:48.340 --> 03:26:49.860]  She crushes it, so yeah.
[03:26:49.860 --> 03:26:51.220]  Awesome.
[03:26:51.220 --> 03:26:52.860]  Keep saying that until she comes on the show.
[03:26:52.860 --> 03:26:56.460]  You too, Katie, with Plant Buddies.
[03:26:56.460 --> 03:26:58.500]  We can talk about, it's for the children.
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:03.020]  Future cannabis projects for the children.
[03:27:03.020 --> 03:27:05.740]  But Plant Buddies is another fantastic organization
[03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:07.260]  teaching children how to grow.
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:10.260]  I'd love to have, it's a female owned company.
[03:27:10.260 --> 03:27:12.740]  So I'd love to have you on the show.
[03:27:13.940 --> 03:27:15.980]  That's awesome, yeah.
[03:27:15.980 --> 03:27:19.340]  Teaching the kids, that's what we need to be doing.
[03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:21.340]  That's what I wanna get into too,
[03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:23.380]  with my compost education and stuff
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:26.860]  is getting into going to schools
[03:27:26.860 --> 03:27:31.300]  and doing composting demonstrations for kids.
[03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:34.860]  And yeah, super important.
[03:27:36.380 --> 03:27:38.140]  Yeah, okay.
[03:27:39.900 --> 03:27:41.500]  Three hours is a long time, right?
[03:27:41.500 --> 03:27:43.460]  I don't wanna get into anything else.
[03:27:44.540 --> 03:27:47.660]  Yeah, we lost Ken somewhere on the way.
[03:27:47.660 --> 03:27:49.620]  Yeah, I'm sure I could keep talking.
[03:27:49.620 --> 03:27:54.180]  Evidently bad weather defeats his internet, so.
[03:27:54.180 --> 03:27:55.860]  Hey, shout out to everybody in Denver.
[03:27:55.900 --> 03:27:58.980]  85 degrees today, blizzard tomorrow.
[03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:00.500]  Who would have thought, huh?
[03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:01.460]  Woo.
[03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:02.300]  Yeah.
[03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:03.140]  Snowing tomorrow in Denver.
[03:28:03.140 --> 03:28:04.660]  No blizzards in LA.
[03:28:04.660 --> 03:28:07.820]  Yeah, well, one day.
[03:28:07.820 --> 03:28:09.660]  One day I can move there.
[03:28:09.660 --> 03:28:10.500]  All right.
[03:28:10.500 --> 03:28:11.340]  All right.
[03:28:11.340 --> 03:28:12.180]  See you guys next week.
[03:28:12.180 --> 03:28:13.020]  See you everyone.
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:13.860]  Bye.
