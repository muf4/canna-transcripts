[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  No, I got rigged up a little holder to keep it out of my way.
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.440]  I like, you're always full of little surprises on the bed.
[00:07.440 --> 00:08.440]  Oh, we're live here.
[00:08.440 --> 00:09.440]  Totally live.
[00:09.440 --> 00:10.440]  All right.
[00:10.440 --> 00:11.440]  Totally live.
[00:11.440 --> 00:12.840]  It's the good stuff.
[00:12.840 --> 00:17.320]  I bring order to the chaos or something like that.
[00:17.320 --> 00:18.320]  Welcome back everybody.
[00:18.320 --> 00:20.280]  Another wonderful Wednesday.
[00:20.280 --> 00:23.000]  You know what you're here for, so let me turn it over to the hosts.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.240]  Yeah, good morning Living Soil Nerds.
[00:26.240 --> 00:30.560]  Every Wednesday afternoon, evening, wherever you guys are checking us out from, we're
[00:30.560 --> 00:34.120]  excited that this show has obviously gone worldwide.
[00:34.120 --> 00:36.640]  So many things have obviously happened in just a week.
[00:36.640 --> 00:40.480]  You know, last week, unfortunately, for the first time ever, I wasn't able to make a show.
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.760]  I always wanted to kind of keep that streak alive.
[00:42.760 --> 00:44.960]  I like getting those little W's every day.
[00:44.960 --> 00:49.800]  I truly do believe in that kind of stuff, showing up to work and putting in work and
[00:49.800 --> 00:52.920]  just kind of making things happen for yourself.
[00:52.920 --> 00:54.480]  So unfortunately, I wasn't able to do that.
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.080]  So last week, we had to reach out to Mr. Sticky District and bring him back this week.
[01:00.080 --> 01:03.040]  And we just had a lot of things obviously behind the scenes going on.
[01:03.040 --> 01:08.400]  I did have my daughter, so just blessed to have that and family and everything.
[01:08.400 --> 01:09.840]  Appreciate everybody that reached out to me.
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.480]  I hope to, you know, after the show and things calm down and get back to everybody in the
[01:13.480 --> 01:14.480]  DMs and stuff.
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.040]  But I really appreciate everybody that reached out and text messages and all that stuff.
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.560]  It just means the world when, you know, you want something in life and then you make it
[01:22.600 --> 01:23.600]  happen for yourself.
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.640]  Also, Marco, you know, from the back end of things, man, you continuing to pump out a
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.280]  lot of fantastic information.
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.280]  Shout out to Katie.
[01:34.400 --> 01:37.320]  A lot of information on the back end of a lot of stuff.
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.040]  And you're also going to kind of, you know, a little teaser, I guess, is we're going to
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.200]  talk a little more about Kashi with you as well, sir.
[01:43.760 --> 01:46.880]  So I wanted to let you have the mic and kind of talk why, Mr.
[01:46.880 --> 01:51.800]  District, this is your pick, obviously, for this week and why he exemplifies what we're
[01:51.800 --> 01:52.800]  after here on the show.
[01:53.680 --> 01:56.480]  Yeah, man, this is I'm excited about this show.
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.240]  I was just saying beforehand that usually I'm a little nervous before each show.
[02:00.240 --> 02:04.040]  But this show, I felt like a little bit more comfortable for some reason.
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.360]  I know last week it was, you know, guys, it seems like it's only every Wednesday, but
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.800]  it was nice to have a Wednesday off last week when, you know, Brian wasn't feeling up to
[02:13.800 --> 02:14.840]  to to speed.
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.720]  You know, I went ahead and said, yeah, man, I kind of feel a little down.
[02:17.720 --> 02:18.880]  Let's take this one off.
[02:18.880 --> 02:20.200]  Regroup, bounce back.
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.480]  And so, yeah, I wanted to have a brother sticky district on here.
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.040]  You know, he's someone that I met, I think it was last October.
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.200]  I had a workshop out of my property in Petersburg and and he came on out and we've just
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.560]  been kicking it ever since.
[02:36.560 --> 02:41.960]  And if you guys are following his Instagram, you'll see that things are very sticky over
[02:41.960 --> 02:47.840]  there. He's very good with his work and there's always something, some nice, fresh
[02:48.160 --> 02:50.880]  goodies being pressed and and whatnot over there.
[02:50.880 --> 02:57.960]  So I know Nick has a lot of different techniques he does and just kind of want to get
[02:57.960 --> 02:59.800]  into it. Man, I thank you for coming on.
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.280]  I know you grow the natural way, which is what we're all about, that living soil, you
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.040]  know, microbes. And yeah, just that's just kind of a testament of some of your product
[03:09.040 --> 03:13.560]  right there. So, yeah, just give a little folks a little bit about yourself, man.
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.840]  And I'm stumbling over my words, but I'll take it from here.
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.160]  And next, you help me out, brother.
[03:18.320 --> 03:19.920]  No, I appreciate it, man.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.000]  I mean, I really I think you guys have the opportunity to be here.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.360]  I mean, it's pretty cool.
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.240]  And I watch you guys show every week and learned lots.
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.880]  And so, you know, hopefully I can share some some stuff and give some new information.
[03:34.360 --> 03:38.960]  But yeah, so, you know, I grow do grow naturally living soil.
[03:38.960 --> 03:41.040]  I started off a super soil back in the day.
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.720]  But over the last four or five years, I guess I've been more into the living soil stuff
[03:47.720 --> 03:56.000]  and really just using some of the JADAM and KNF techniques and getting good results.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.480]  And I also, you know, I make my own hash rosin, hash rosin and temple balls.
[04:04.240 --> 04:06.880]  So, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[04:06.880 --> 04:08.280]  I'm doing that in Washington, D.C.
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.400]  So that's where I'm at.
[04:10.320 --> 04:11.120]  All right.
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.040]  Well, just real quick, I always like to break it down for the people that don't know much.
[04:16.040 --> 04:16.760]  So break it down.
[04:16.760 --> 04:19.720]  What's the difference between that hash rosin and temple ball?
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.160]  Just kind of give us a little bit of a rundown so everybody's on the same page.
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.320]  Yeah, sure. So so in order to make rosin, what you're doing, I actually wash.
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.840]  So I use I make ice water hash, which gives you loose resin.
[04:32.920 --> 04:40.640]  And so once you take the loose resin and you wash it, you go through the filter, through the screens,
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.880]  you put it through a freeze dryer, you dry it, then you have your loose resin.
[04:44.880 --> 04:53.240]  Once you get your loose resin, you put it in bags and you press it on a press with heated plates and pressure,
[04:54.520 --> 04:59.880]  which squeezes out all the good stuff and, you know, like pressing grapes into wine.
[05:00.880 --> 05:02.560]  And then you just take that natural resin.
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.680]  Now, if you want to do something more than that, you know, you can do some post processing with heat,
[05:08.120 --> 05:17.040]  you know, heat, heat pads or ovens, you know, over a couple hours to days, depending on what consistency and what you're trying to do.
[05:17.560 --> 05:24.040]  And and yeah, and then you got your rosin, you know, usually I call it live rosin.
[05:24.280 --> 05:33.440]  And then the difference between that and a temple ball would be once I take the you have loose resin, you don't process it any further.
[05:34.560 --> 05:41.480]  You take it, you take the loose resin and you use a I do the Frenchie cannoli style.
[05:41.480 --> 05:52.960]  So I take a hot water in a wine bottle or water bottle and roll it over top, continually roll it over top of the resin, which busts the heads, melts it down.
[05:53.800 --> 06:00.720]  Squishes together, so it's more like a putty instead of instead of loose grains of salt.
[06:00.760 --> 06:08.320]  And then you put it into a plastic wrap, like a cellulose or cellophane and you wrap it really tight.
[06:08.320 --> 06:15.320]  So it's into a nice ball and then you just let it sit in a dark, cool spot for three months, at least three months.
[06:15.320 --> 06:18.080]  And then hopefully it's a matured enough.
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.880]  And that's when you get that hashish and hash smell, you know, that that hash turf.
[06:24.200 --> 06:25.920]  And that's how you get it, you know.
[06:27.040 --> 06:30.080]  So so just keep on that right quick.
[06:30.360 --> 06:35.000]  So when you wash now, you have all that all those trichrome heads.
[06:35.160 --> 06:41.120]  Now, from there, you can choose to either go to press or to Temple Ball.
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.440]  Is that where it is or did I miss something in the snow?
[06:43.520 --> 06:46.880]  Yeah, yeah. You can either smoke smoke the live resin.
[06:46.880 --> 06:48.400]  I mean, that's hashish.
[06:50.240 --> 06:59.680]  So you can either smoke it, you can press it in the resin or you can roll it and then cure it as a temple ball, which then allows all the terpenes and everything.
[06:59.680 --> 07:08.160]  Whatever process that curing process does just opens it up and makes it better than what it was because you cured it.
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.840]  So and I mean, there's people, you know, they're smoking 20 year old temple balls.
[07:13.840 --> 07:16.920]  I mean, once you get it, you put it in a cool, nice, dry space.
[07:17.240 --> 07:18.320]  It would just last forever.
[07:19.640 --> 07:23.880]  And it gets better with age and the TAC doesn't degrade like like flour.
[07:24.920 --> 07:28.280]  I haven't I have not tested a temple ball.
[07:28.280 --> 07:31.560]  I've tested my rosen before and flower, but not a temple ball.
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.480]  But I do know, you know, when it's a totally different high.
[07:36.480 --> 07:49.320]  I mean, it's it's incredible when you have the same loose resin and then between the loose resin, the rosen, a processed rosin and to, you know, jam or something.
[07:49.320 --> 07:55.280]  And then even in temple ball, they all taste different, you know, and it's pretty incredible.
[07:55.280 --> 07:58.760]  I mean, I can't wait to get to a point that I can actually get that tested.
[07:58.840 --> 08:01.480]  And they don't have really a test facility in D.C. anymore.
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.800]  So I just not really had the opportunity.
[08:07.480 --> 08:14.520]  Yeah, I think temple balls are a little miss, maybe not known as well, and then maybe misunderstood.
[08:14.520 --> 08:20.960]  You know, a lot of individuals used to think that if you would cure it for three months, that you're going to lose all of the flavor and everything.
[08:20.960 --> 08:28.120]  So it's nice when individuals like Frenchy come on and started to really just create this whole education culture.
[08:28.680 --> 08:32.920]  He's definitely one of the first ones where I felt like I saw and a few other people on YouTube.
[08:32.920 --> 08:35.000]  But Frenchy was out there at the forefront.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.720]  Every expo, you know, for a time there, I was kind of traveling all over the country.
[08:39.920 --> 08:43.720]  And if I was at that expo, he was there or one of his representatives were there.
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.680]  So it's really cool to see him just kind of take the forefront.
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.280]  And then, of course, the younger generation kind of makes fun of some of the color that comes out of that.
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.200]  Do you mind maybe even talking a little bit on that and why color, I guess, in a way does matter.
[08:59.200 --> 09:03.920]  But at the same time, you got to understand your source and what material you're working with.
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.600]  And that's not explained enough, I think, from the way that Frenchy kind of looks at things.
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.960]  Yeah. Yeah. So honestly, Color Man, it doesn't even matter to me one difference.
[09:17.080 --> 09:24.200]  You know, all the old days when you were pressing rods and people didn't know the heat and they were using hair straighteners.
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.000]  I mean, we burn the shit out of that stuff.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.640]  I mean, and that's why, you know, you get that.
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.800]  It's just weird. You know, you couldn't control it.
[09:32.800 --> 09:36.760]  You know, we didn't have any idea, you know, really what was going on with it.
[09:36.760 --> 09:38.480]  And that's where it all comes from.
[09:38.480 --> 09:41.200]  But today, you know, people know what they're doing.
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.480]  I mean, if you're new, you're going to burn your stuff.
[09:43.520 --> 09:45.080]  I mean, you're going to screw it up for sure.
[09:45.080 --> 09:55.280]  But, you know, colors now, it has everything to do with the tricone head look like when I washed it, you know, or when the grower decided they were done with it.
[09:55.560 --> 09:58.880]  You know, if it has lots of amber in it, you've gone longer.
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.360]  It's going to be darker than if you pull it early and it's white and it hasn't turned all those amber heads.
[10:04.360 --> 10:05.680]  You know, you're dealing with a lot of clear heads.
[10:05.680 --> 10:06.800]  It's going to turn into a white.
[10:07.280 --> 10:16.480]  You know, the big difference with using the temple balls is that it does go through that oxygenation aging process longer.
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.640]  So it does darken some, but it doesn't darken into like it looks bad.
[10:21.680 --> 10:26.840]  I mean, you can almost you tell that it's oxidized in a better way.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.680]  Because it's hard to even say it's oxidized because there's no oxygen in it.
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.680]  And like earlier, I was saying, you take that ball and you wrap it in cellophane and you twist it really tight.
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.920]  And so that there's no air getting in there at all.
[10:39.960 --> 10:42.800]  I mean, when you look at it and I think I'm a picture on I.G.
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.040]  at one point is that you can actually squish it.
[10:45.040 --> 10:50.200]  And the terpenes are moving around the outside of the ball in the cellophane.
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.720]  And so, I mean, there's no way it's getting oxygenated.
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.400]  That is a true aging process of the trichome head.
[10:58.680 --> 11:00.240]  But you know what happens with that?
[11:00.240 --> 11:02.920]  Those temple balls is man, it gets so much smoother.
[11:02.960 --> 11:05.080]  You know, I mean, it's just a smooth hit.
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.720]  Doesn't hurt your lungs.
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.240]  You know, it's just and it tastes like hash.
[11:10.240 --> 11:14.000]  I mean, like the old school hash that you would think you always thought of.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.520]  That is what how it's made.
[11:15.520 --> 11:16.120]  I mean, that's it.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.520]  You know, old school brick ash or something.
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.720]  Yeah, it's almost like it has its inner beauty comes out or something like that,
[11:23.720 --> 11:26.800]  like there's a shine and shimmer to it when she starts to cure out.
[11:27.600 --> 11:30.800]  And that's something that I don't think a lot of people take the time to,
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.000]  you know, really smoke on and the bird with, you know, that bird.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.760]  I think I think he kind of exemplifies a lot of the stuff that Frenchie kind of was to,
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.360]  you know, I don't know him as well as like Marco or something like that.
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.760]  But it seems like from the outside that his goal is obviously he's taking care of his family,
[11:49.760 --> 11:55.040]  but his education at the end of the day and continues to really pump out quality stuff.
[11:55.720 --> 11:58.800]  So he would share with us how to make a temple ball.
[11:58.800 --> 12:00.000]  I think that's been time stamped.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.360]  If you guys want to go check that out.
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.360]  So, again, these guys are dropping knowledge that you can kind of take and play around with for yourself
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.320]  and know for a fact that the three month cure actually does mean something, because for a while
[12:12.320 --> 12:18.080]  there, our peer group, you know, there's a there's almost a strong argument against going that long
[12:18.080 --> 12:20.360]  because how it would degrade.
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.160]  There's a lot of misinformation, especially back then.
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.360]  So moving forward, it sounds like, you know, Sticky, you're a A to Z farmer and a lot of individuals,
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.280]  especially when they're getting into this, they really want to know what washes so that they don't waste their time.
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.040]  You know, I think especially our community and some other podcast communities out there seems like
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.480]  the jig is up with some of this stuff where it's like, OK, I bought these genetics, but they weren't what I was after.
[12:47.480 --> 12:50.000]  I was I was sold X and I got Y.
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.520]  And it's like, man, I don't want to waste another five, six months, maybe a year, you know, or maybe you sat on the seeds.
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.000]  That's what happens to a lot of individuals, too.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.680]  They sit on the seats for a couple of years, run them now that everybody's talking about it.
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.840]  And now by the time they're producing the product, everybody's on to something else.
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.880]  So when it comes to genetics, how do you kind of stay at the forefront of knowing what to wash?
[13:11.400 --> 13:13.880]  What are you looking out for and just quality?
[13:13.880 --> 13:21.840]  And if you want to shout out, we also like when you kind of shout out breeders, maybe that aren't necessarily known so that more individuals might check out their work.
[13:22.800 --> 13:30.440]  You know, that's a lot. Well, first of all, man, I've gone through so many seeds, dude, I have no idea what's a good what makes a good and what doesn't until after it's grown.
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.720]  So, you know, I've gone into growing stuff thinking, oh, this is going to be perfect.
[13:35.720 --> 13:45.560]  And dude, I didn't find not one that wash worth a damn, you know, I mean, beautiful flower smelled great, you know, great bag appeal, but then squirt squish were shit.
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.800]  And it's been I mean, and just be dude, I've put.
[13:52.800 --> 14:18.320]  Over over many years, dude, hundreds and hundreds of seeds, and I have now down to two that produce something, I have a 20 year old chem dog sour diesel that we've been growing for over since 2002 and cookies and cream from exotic genetics, the F1s that I literally had bought a 10 pack, I popped five of them and one was a winner.
[14:18.440 --> 14:30.360]  I still got five from that pack, you know, but you know, all the hundreds of other great breeders, I mean, amazing stuff that you thought was going to give you something didn't give me anything.
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.400]  And, you know, my criteria is if it squishes less than 3%, I'm not going to keep it.
[14:36.480 --> 14:45.440]  It doesn't it's not even a consideration and anything over three to four, I'll consider, but it has to be at least four before it's a keeper.
[14:45.600 --> 15:00.280]  And the two things actually have three now I had a buddy shout out who found a blueberry and GMO cross that do we just found it and it kicked out 5% return on our wash.
[15:00.320 --> 15:03.800]  And so I mean, it's basically that's a unicorn.
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.480]  So you have to go through, you know, listen to belief when you guys have interviewed that dude.
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.480]  His process is actually I really like how his pheno hunting processes.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.680]  I like how he shortened it down.
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.120]  I'm probably going to move in that direction here real quick to try to go through things more often.
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.520]  And I did buy I'm waiting for Humphrey hash.
[15:27.520 --> 15:30.760]  I got one of those resin dials purchased.
[15:30.760 --> 15:32.160]  I'm waiting for that to get shipped in.
[15:32.160 --> 15:39.560]  So while these things are growing at the end, I can just do a quick wash in that little contraption that he's invented.
[15:39.840 --> 15:46.520]  And instead of having to go through the whole rigmarole of washing and with all the big bags and going through that process.
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.200]  So, you know, you know, I'm going to ask you about more about that.
[15:51.200 --> 15:53.280]  Now, what's that little machine or contraption?
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.360]  Is that like is that speeding up the process by entire that kind of what that's all about?
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.280]  Well, what it is, it's basically a little wash bucket.
[16:01.280 --> 16:09.680]  You know, you basically when you wash you have five gallon buckets, you have different microns, you know, 45 to 190 micron bags.
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.280]  And, you know, it's in a 55 gallon or, you know, like a 20 gallon thing.
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.560]  And this is in a little little like coffee mug.
[16:19.320 --> 16:22.960]  And it screws on the top of a ball jar.
[16:22.960 --> 16:32.160]  And basically I could just take a bud and freeze it, then wash it in ice and shake it up like a, you know, like a cocktail.
[16:32.680 --> 16:40.080]  And then you pour it through the filter bags and then the water gets into the ball jar and then all your resin is all in the bags.
[16:40.240 --> 16:49.120]  So then at least during all of your micron sizes, you see exactly what sizes are kicking out and then you determine if it's worth it or not.
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.480]  Wow. So you can just weigh, you know, 10 grams, do the math and you know what you got.
[16:55.240 --> 16:56.720]  That's it right there, man, dude.
[16:56.760 --> 17:00.760]  I'm telling you, he put in the work and this bitch is bad ass.
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.320]  Like whoever said game changer before, dude, this is the game changer.
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.720]  I guarantee every single one of us who make cash have been thought of this thing.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.680]  And he's the first one to put it out.
[17:12.680 --> 17:15.360]  And it's it's a game changer for sure.
[17:15.360 --> 17:22.280]  Because I see a lot of the times I just see a ball jar guys are taking the flour, putting in a ball jar, doing something and looking at it.
[17:22.280 --> 17:24.880]  And this thing now separates into your micron.
[17:24.920 --> 17:25.760]  Man, that's dope.
[17:26.240 --> 17:37.280]  Yeah, because before, you know, you could take it in a ball jar, freeze it, shake it, pour it through a regular filter bag that I would use to press resin.
[17:37.760 --> 17:46.200]  And, you know, you would just comport through there and then at least take it and dry it and then freeze, dry it and then press it, squish it.
[17:46.480 --> 18:05.720]  But this sort of takes out that all a lot of that, because oftentimes, depending on where the heads lie, you know, if you're at your 45, you're 70, you're 90 or 160 or whatever, that's where you're going to see, you know, your larger heads are going to have more juice in them, you know, and those are going to be in the
[18:06.400 --> 18:08.360]  the larger micron sizes.
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.280]  And if you have a lot of that, you already know instantly that you got a good run.
[18:13.600 --> 18:18.440]  You know, if you got a lot running in the 45, they're just puny little heads and they're probably not going to give a lot.
[18:18.680 --> 18:20.800]  That might not be something that you're going after.
[18:21.680 --> 18:32.720]  But at least it's something it allows you to go through and pick out winners better based on what your, you know, my criteria is it needs to squish at least 4%.
[18:33.360 --> 18:40.080]  So at least I can see my, you know, I use return on wash, ROW, return on squish.
[18:40.080 --> 18:41.960]  Those are my little notations I always use.
[18:41.960 --> 18:53.960]  So like a return on wash, when you wash something, when you get loose resin, that is needs to be, I'm losing my train of thought.
[18:54.320 --> 18:57.880]  That has to be a high enough percentage that is worth your time.
[18:58.360 --> 18:59.720]  You know, if you're talking.
[18:59.920 --> 19:01.040]  So there's a couple of things.
[19:01.080 --> 19:02.480]  I'm always talking about percentages.
[19:02.840 --> 19:14.840]  And if I'm talking about loose resin, I am looking for something that's going to kick out more than, I'm losing my train of thought.
[19:15.800 --> 19:18.560]  Basically more than 22%, that's not right.
[19:18.840 --> 19:21.120]  More than 3% is what I'm going to kick out.
[19:21.280 --> 19:28.440]  My turn on squish is after I press my ROS and that's usually going to give me anywhere from 65 to 80%.
[19:29.240 --> 19:43.400]  And so even though this resin dial is not going to be able to give me what my squish percentages or my ROS and percentage out of hash, it gives me, it'll let me know if I'm over that three or four or 5% mark, or if it's under 2%.
[19:43.680 --> 19:46.080]  And if it's under 2%, it's not even worth keeping.
[19:46.480 --> 19:47.360]  You'll never improve it.
[19:47.680 --> 19:55.720]  So it gives you at least that one parameter that you can be 100 on, you know, for sure it'll wash, you know, so at least you're starting out the right way.
[19:55.840 --> 19:56.480]  That's pretty dope.
[19:56.560 --> 19:59.040]  And you know what, you know, what sizes it washes at.
[19:59.320 --> 20:00.120]  Exactly.
[20:00.200 --> 20:00.800]  Exactly.
[20:00.800 --> 20:11.640]  Cause you know, everybody talks about how greasy stuff is and you know, if it washes grease or the trichomes have thin heads or it's a, or thin, thin walls.
[20:11.640 --> 20:13.440]  So they're going to rupture really quickly.
[20:13.760 --> 20:16.000]  That's how you get greasy stuff.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.960]  And that's when you start ruining your bags, cause you start breaking everything.
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.440]  You wouldn't know that even though you may, I haven't, it'll be interesting to see when I get this thing.
[20:26.160 --> 20:34.960]  You may not know that part of it, but generally what happens when you're washing, if they're thin heads, you start smelling your weed in the water.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.200]  Significantly more than you would otherwise.
[20:38.240 --> 20:41.160]  And once you start losing all that, it's just done.
[20:41.200 --> 20:53.040]  And I don't know if that's because, you know, genetically it has thinner heads or thinner walls, or it has a higher terpene content for like citrusy stuff,
[20:53.040 --> 21:15.600]  liming or, um, um, um, pinean that are, uh, far more, um, um, are more solvent like than, uh, cultivars that aren't as high in lining, you know, and like eating away at the head on the inside or something like that.
[21:16.760 --> 21:16.920]  Yeah.
[21:16.920 --> 21:17.280]  That makes sense.
[21:17.560 --> 21:20.640]  You kind of casual mentioned a bar to me.
[21:20.640 --> 21:23.160]  You were saying like a 2% will never improve.
[21:23.640 --> 21:32.840]  Um, so when you're running those through you, you know, Hey, even if I put some 10 more tender loving care into this, uh, uh, plant, she's not going to be worth it.
[21:32.840 --> 21:36.160]  It, you know, is there a point where it's like, all right, I'm at 3%.
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.800]  So now, uh, she stays in the stable a little bit more in the 2% are being kicked out.
[21:41.120 --> 21:42.280]  Kind of go through your, yeah.
[21:42.280 --> 21:51.000]  I'd love to know your, your thought process on, on how, how you're continuing to keep things knowing like for the future, building your stock, that kind of language.
[21:51.480 --> 21:51.880]  Yeah.
[21:51.880 --> 22:00.520]  So, um, uh, yeah, the, the interesting thing and I, and I say that, that I can't improve 2% is man.
[22:00.520 --> 22:09.560]  I have tried, I mean, I've had some things that just the terpene profile, the bud structure, like everything is just spot on man.
[22:09.920 --> 22:11.680]  And it doesn't give me anything.
[22:11.880 --> 22:24.200]  I mean, dude, I've had huge trees give me like 0.9% and I'm like, how, like a lot of hat or a lot of loose resin and it didn't squish shit.
[22:24.680 --> 22:29.640]  So I mean, it's like, it's little grains of rice or little grains of salt or something.
[22:29.640 --> 22:31.240]  I mean, it was just, it was strange.
[22:31.240 --> 22:33.600]  So that's really where I've settled on that.
[22:33.600 --> 22:36.320]  If it's less than 2%, you're not going to squeeze much out of it.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.880]  I mean, you may not squeeze another quarter, maybe half percent out of it.
[22:40.040 --> 22:50.920]  You know, if you can tweak some stuff, but you know, I just don't think it's worth the time and effort, you know, maybe it's something that you want to use to breed with, you know, if it's just kicking out a beautiful terpene profile or structures, great.
[22:51.280 --> 23:02.320]  You know, take that and then cross it with something that's known like a chem dog or OG that, or a sour diesel or OG that actually presses notoriously presses more.
[23:02.640 --> 23:09.440]  So, you know, crossing with that, maybe pull that profile over or something, but, um, so it's, uh, it's
[23:09.440 --> 23:17.360]  incredible on how, certainly how the most seed that I've produced have all been below 2%.
[23:18.080 --> 23:20.240]  And it's been a rare day that I've had.
[23:20.240 --> 23:27.440]  I've had a couple of 3% and the, these five, 6% are just, are unicorns.
[23:27.640 --> 23:32.680]  And, uh, it's just a matter of going through seeds and really just trying to find that part of it.
[23:32.680 --> 23:38.160]  I mean, thank God, Belief and a lot of other breeders out there are breeding specifically for squishing.
[23:38.480 --> 23:41.040]  Um, for Rosin production.
[23:41.080 --> 23:46.720]  And, uh, so there should be a lot more out there that are available to get.
[23:46.960 --> 23:50.720]  Um, and I'm one of those people have been sitting on seeds forever, man.
[23:50.720 --> 23:52.480]  I got ridiculous amount of seeds.
[23:52.800 --> 23:54.000]  Like I, that's my collection.
[23:54.120 --> 23:57.720]  And, uh, I don't even know if I'll ever have enough time to ever go through it all.
[23:57.760 --> 24:00.320]  So, and there's some spectacular things in there.
[24:00.400 --> 24:08.000]  Um, but it's one of those things you could gun shy, you know, I put a lot of times in some seeds and really, I mean, like, I know this is
[24:08.040 --> 24:11.200]  going to work out perfect and dude, it just falls flat.
[24:11.240 --> 24:13.680]  And I'm like, dude, I just spent all these months doing it.
[24:13.680 --> 24:20.480]  And the way I go at the, you know, what Brian was saying is I grow everything three times before I finally say, screw it.
[24:20.480 --> 24:27.240]  So the first run I go through and if it's not producing much, you know, I do go through my washes.
[24:27.240 --> 24:36.240]  If it didn't give me, I just toss it out, you know, and then, um, I'll try to, the second time is to really make sure it's giving me what I'm really getting at.
[24:36.520 --> 24:45.280]  And then that third run, you know, if I, and this is where ones that I've been at like two and a half, almost at 3% going, well, maybe I can squeeze, squeeze more out of it.
[24:45.920 --> 24:47.600]  And, uh, I just really can't.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.120]  And then, you know, you get frustrated.
[24:50.120 --> 25:05.560]  Cause I'm like, I just spent this space on a 2% or a 3% or when I could have been getting a five or 6% or out of it, you know, and you know, when we have, we can only grow so many, um, plants, you know, you just have to stay within that, that realm.
[25:05.560 --> 25:06.520]  And it just takes forever.
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.720]  I mean, being in Oklahoma and have like a field of thousands of seeds, man, that'd be beautiful.
[25:10.840 --> 25:13.040]  And, uh, how much you can go through so quick.
[25:13.720 --> 25:18.040]  Um, but that restraint here in DC and elsewhere is just a little bit tougher.
[25:18.040 --> 25:21.880]  So, um, uh, I think I, yeah, definitely.
[25:21.880 --> 25:23.800]  So Nick, so, so sticky.
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.840]  So like a few things you said, like when you're at a two, you know, you need to think, okay, I'm gonna run again, see if I can push and get a little bit more.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.920]  Now those are techniques you're doing in the growth process.
[25:33.920 --> 25:34.320]  Correct.
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.760]  That's all about maybe changing temperature, maybe trying different little feed regimen, things like that.
[25:39.760 --> 25:40.080]  Okay.
[25:40.080 --> 25:40.560]  I got you.
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.120]  It's all the farmer and you've heard everybody say it's all about what the farmer does.
[25:44.120 --> 25:52.600]  And you know, if I'm not producing good trichomes, then, you know, and that's what you have to invest in the time.
[25:53.400 --> 25:53.960]  Definitely.
[25:54.640 --> 25:56.760]  No, I love how you're calling this stuff unicorns.
[25:56.760 --> 25:58.000]  Cause that's really what it is.
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.960]  And a lot of individuals are now talking about, um, I don't know, you know, maybe a golden unicorn where we're at like seven, 8%.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.440]  Have you personally seen that kind of stuff and where, where do you think it's going to go?
[26:11.800 --> 26:17.320]  Man, I, um, I mean, it's pretty, it's sad actually about that.
[26:17.320 --> 26:22.600]  I've only, I've personally found two out of easily a thousand seeds.
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.120]  I'll just leave it at that easily.
[26:24.120 --> 26:26.040]  A thousand seeds, I'm sure a lot more than that.
[26:26.520 --> 26:27.720]  To only find two.
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.800]  And one of them is the chem dog sour diesel.
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.880]  We've been growing since 2002.
[26:34.440 --> 26:36.840]  I mean, that was, nobody was squishing nothing back then.
[26:36.840 --> 26:42.200]  So it remarkable on how the genetics have always produced that.
[26:42.480 --> 26:49.800]  And when we found that one genetic 20 years ago, man, that was that unicorn.
[26:49.800 --> 26:55.400]  We knew the first day she was growing, that she was going to be spectacular, you know, and made.
[26:55.760 --> 27:03.360]  Um, great dry, SIF, great weed, great bag appeal, you know, everything you threw at it, it just produced, you know?
[27:03.400 --> 27:12.120]  And so I was lucky, very fortunate that that just came around because I'm sure if I was only getting two percenters all time, I would have been a lot more frustrated earlier on.
[27:12.560 --> 27:13.520]  Um, yeah.
[27:13.560 --> 27:22.240]  So when, so when you found that 20 years ago, roughly, so obviously you weren't doing the same processes with this question, you know, obviously none of that was going down.
[27:22.240 --> 27:23.920]  So was that just an awesome plan?
[27:23.920 --> 27:26.200]  Excellent bag appeal, loud as hell.
[27:26.440 --> 27:33.640]  And then as you progressed with how to process it, you kind of just brought her along the way and trying different techniques with her.
[27:34.160 --> 27:34.440]  Yeah.
[27:34.440 --> 27:37.240]  So a buddy of mine down in Richmond actually found it.
[27:39.040 --> 27:49.160]  You know, he actually got the seeds from chem dog and, uh, you know, pop them with some, uh, Cinderella 99, which is my favorite and wish I still had that cut.
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.080]  But, um, uh, I'm sorry, Marco, I totally lost.
[27:54.080 --> 27:54.920]  What the hell you just said?
[27:55.000 --> 27:55.280]  No.
[27:55.280 --> 28:04.320]  So we're just talking about like kind of how you found her back then, taking your mind back to 20 years ago, y'all were just like, man, this is just a loud night, you know, bad ass beast here.
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.840]  And then obviously as you, over the years, you know, now you're impressing things.
[28:08.840 --> 28:11.400]  And so that you just kind of carried her up with you along the way.
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.640]  And then at what point did you discover this as a 5%?
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.440]  Like, obviously you didn't know that right away, but you knew it was loud and you knew she was a nice plant.
[28:20.000 --> 28:20.440]  Yeah.
[28:20.480 --> 28:32.840]  Um, man, I mean, she was just so given early on, but you know, the crazy part about the chem dog sour diesel, this particular one is that she started in.
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.440]  And how I always started, I use botanic care, botanic care, bottle nukes, you know what I'm saying?
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.600]  One and two or whatever.
[28:39.600 --> 28:44.200]  And, you know, and use those and it produced amazing, gorgeous weed, you know?
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.360]  And, you know, using buckets or, um, so, I mean, it was loud from the beginning.
[28:50.360 --> 28:51.520]  It always was.
[28:51.560 --> 29:04.280]  And, but it had been grown in botanic care specifically from 2002 until I switched to, um, sub cool super soil and like 2016.
[29:04.680 --> 29:06.160]  I didn't know how it was going to react.
[29:06.160 --> 29:09.320]  I thought it was going to go a different direction.
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.120]  And my flip to soil was, it was the same.
[29:15.440 --> 29:17.760]  I mean, the bud structure was a little smaller.
[29:17.760 --> 29:22.680]  It wasn't, the weight was, it wasn't there, but it clearly the trichomes were all over this thing.
[29:22.680 --> 29:25.080]  So I wasn't worried about the bag weight.
[29:25.760 --> 29:29.000]  Um, I was just amazed on what I was getting just out of that super soil.
[29:29.400 --> 29:37.800]  And, um, and then, so it allowed me to get rid of the ebb and flow system that I was working on that the damn controller was flooded my fricking room all the time anyway.
[29:37.840 --> 29:49.800]  So, um, going to soil was a perfect switch and what remarkable has happened since going from that to super soil to a coots mix to where I'm at today.
[29:50.320 --> 29:53.440]  Um, the terpene profiles have completely changed.
[29:53.920 --> 30:05.160]  The, the, the plant in the last three years is a totally different plant than it was 20 years ago, even six, seven years ago, totally different plant, different terpenes.
[30:05.480 --> 30:11.760]  Um, you know, it was one of those things that you would smoke and it'd give me couch a lot, you know, I'd just, it was like a nighttime med.
[30:11.760 --> 30:13.000]  You'd be out, you'd be out.
[30:13.440 --> 30:17.200]  And now it is a full day high.
[30:17.640 --> 30:19.240]  Like you're not going to go sleep on it.
[30:19.320 --> 30:22.480]  It's the terpene profile, the cannabinoids.
[30:22.520 --> 30:25.320]  I had those tested, so I know it was low cannabinoids.
[30:25.320 --> 30:30.320]  It was 19% or 16%, which people would like laugh at.
[30:30.800 --> 30:32.360]  Um, but it got you high as hell.
[30:32.400 --> 30:38.760]  And clearly the terpenes is what was modulating you to get to a point that you were just so damn stone.
[30:39.240 --> 30:43.200]  And now you get that stone, but it's an up high.
[30:43.200 --> 30:44.240]  You're not going to sleep.
[30:44.360 --> 30:52.960]  And I can only attribute that to the living soil, allowing the microbes, allowing that plant to express itself fully.
[30:53.320 --> 30:55.560]  And there is no other explanation.
[30:55.720 --> 31:08.000]  I mean, if it wasn't for this thing growing as long as it has and dip pretty much every possible way to grow weed, um, to be able to tell it wasn't until just a few years ago that it's noticeably different.
[31:08.680 --> 31:09.360]  Oh man.
[31:09.360 --> 31:11.600]  These are the kinds of things that I love, man.
[31:11.600 --> 31:13.360]  Like these, that's chill bumps right there.
[31:13.360 --> 31:20.520]  Because when you live through growing man, like if you think 20 years, a man had the same plant growing it.
[31:20.520 --> 31:25.360]  He knows how that plant grows, what it does, what it smells like, what it tastes like.
[31:25.360 --> 31:29.640]  And that's amazing to hear the kind of over the progression of time with living soil.
[31:30.040 --> 31:31.200]  I think that's what it is.
[31:31.200 --> 31:45.880]  It brings out that full expression, you know, baby back with the botanic care days, you know, you're sure it was fire, but it was missing something, obviously, you know, in that last component probably was the microbes and the soil biology, man.
[31:45.880 --> 31:48.040]  So I love hearing that real life stuff.
[31:48.040 --> 31:52.080]  I hate when people say, man, this happens, but they didn't really live it.
[31:52.120 --> 31:55.520]  And then to hear somebody say it and live it, I think that's a lot of respect.
[31:55.520 --> 31:57.120]  And that's a gold bar, man.
[31:57.120 --> 32:01.160]  That's big because I want people to think, look at your plants that same way.
[32:01.160 --> 32:02.520]  People, you're starting out growing.
[32:02.520 --> 32:06.960]  If you're keeping things long term, watch your plants, see how they change, see if they change.
[32:07.920 --> 32:12.160]  See if when you go to that living soil that brings out that full expression, I'd be very interested.
[32:12.160 --> 32:12.960]  I know the answer.
[32:12.960 --> 32:17.280]  And Nick just kind of reiterated that, which a lot of people do when they come on here.
[32:17.280 --> 32:17.800]  So let's go.
[32:18.720 --> 32:37.800]  Speaking of keeping things long term, do you have some gold bars for how you've been able to keep those genetics for 20 years without de-degradation or a lot of issues with like always having russets somehow with that cut or something like that, that seems to rear its ugly head after a few years?
[32:38.560 --> 32:39.080]  Yeah.
[32:40.720 --> 32:49.280]  Well, I can tell you, man, when in 2015, when I went legal in D.C., man, I just moved my, you know, started using botanic care with Edmund Flo.
[32:49.840 --> 32:51.760]  You know, those first two years are beautiful, man.
[32:51.840 --> 32:54.280]  I didn't have no bugs and everything was perfect.
[32:54.280 --> 32:55.440]  It was like ding, ding, ding.
[32:55.440 --> 32:57.480]  You know, she's been growing for so long.
[32:57.480 --> 32:58.600]  It was sleeping.
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.520]  But I don't know at that two year mark, dude, I don't know if all of a sudden.
[33:04.520 --> 33:12.400]  I don't even know, man, like the smell lingers or the pheromones or whatever is lingering in the air, man, all of a sudden they just started coming.
[33:12.400 --> 33:16.040]  Things started coming in that I never experienced before.
[33:16.840 --> 33:21.920]  So I was really nervous for a long time on if I'm ever going to be able to keep this cut around.
[33:22.800 --> 33:24.160]  I was the only one that still had it.
[33:24.280 --> 33:32.720]  And, you know, it was it was one of those things you you do a million cuts and just make sure that you're going to get keep that clone.
[33:33.640 --> 33:36.280]  So and I was never like a mother's guy.
[33:36.840 --> 33:42.840]  I I grow I clone the clones go in and I just grow and I flip the others.
[33:43.040 --> 33:44.280]  I think it's crazy.
[33:44.280 --> 33:47.000]  I have no idea why people would keep mothers around.
[33:47.440 --> 33:48.680]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.920]  And I think keeping mothers is where you're going to get your russets.
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.120]  And that's when you start having problems.
[33:55.120 --> 33:58.440]  You know, these plants are made to be grown for a year and that's it.
[33:58.640 --> 33:59.360]  And they make seed.
[33:59.360 --> 34:00.360]  They die to grow again.
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.920]  You know, it's like a dandelion or something.
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.720]  Maybe not like a dandelion, but, you know, they want to be rejuvenated.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.160]  And since I'd always cut from.
[34:11.520 --> 34:20.520]  You know, I was getting ready to flip them, so I'm cloning the top of the plant, so it's all new growth, it's all fresh, it's, you know, it's the greenness of the leaves.
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.920]  You're taking the best part of it and you and you go and you move it and you clone it.
[34:25.080 --> 34:28.160]  And, you know, you get enough of those.
[34:28.160 --> 34:30.080]  I've never had any degradation.
[34:31.040 --> 34:42.920]  The chain, the only change is that I just described is the only change I've ever seen when, you know, all the bro science and all the boards back in the day are always claiming on they, you know, they lose something.
[34:43.360 --> 34:45.000]  I knew it was bullshit.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  And that's how you could tell when people knew what they're talking about, because they kept saying that stupid shit.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.200]  They had no idea what they're talking about because they were just saying things other people said because they clearly weren't living it is my assumption.
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.040]  And it's all based on this just one cut, you know.
[34:59.680 --> 35:10.320]  And the forums back in the day, too, I feel like a lot of that stuff was based off of the mothers, so they would have their experience when they're talking about this and anything perpetual is all based off mothers in the form of days.
[35:11.080 --> 35:22.400]  And I would imagine you've seen a lot of those two, man, where they get like really woody and it's like, all right, talk about how to take a thousand thousand cuts to get just two or three to actually root.
[35:23.080 --> 35:32.080]  It's just kind of silly and keeping things perpetual, keeping things moving has always seen more of a thinking person's process towards this.
[35:32.680 --> 35:43.600]  So, you know, I commend you for kind of bringing that kind of stuff up because when people hear 20 years, I would imagine they would have thought when new individuals hear this, they probably think you had a plant growing for 20 years.
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.800]  Right. Yeah, really.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.560]  And, you know, like, man, I'm not a mother's guy either because, you know, you keep them.
[35:50.560 --> 35:52.320]  And then, I mean, I love plants.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.840]  And I can grow a mother plant just like a house plant.
[35:54.880 --> 36:04.960]  It's not a problem. The problem is you lose a lot of those vigorous tips and then you get to where you can't really get large clones off some of those mothers.
[36:05.240 --> 36:06.680]  You know, that's been my experience.
[36:07.600 --> 36:15.520]  Like you said, man, you keep a pot hanging around the corner, not really tended to that often, you know, somewhat neglected.
[36:15.840 --> 36:18.400]  You know, it is a haven for possibly for pests.
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.520]  You know, I mean, some people are very attentive to their mothers.
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.000]  You're on top of your game.
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.560]  You're you're up, potting them.
[36:24.560 --> 36:29.040]  You're cutting the roots off, cutting the foliage off, repotting, kind of getting that bigger.
[36:29.040 --> 36:30.360]  You know, you can do that as well.
[36:30.360 --> 36:31.880]  But to me, that's a lot more time.
[36:33.080 --> 36:35.000]  I have good success like you, Nick.
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.440]  I haven't kept anything 20 years, but I have some things that I've always been like, damn, I wish I still had that.
[36:41.400 --> 36:48.400]  But, you know, I keep things for some years and over and over, recloning and recloning, and that works out fine.
[36:48.400 --> 36:51.160]  You know, I haven't seen any degradation, degradation.
[36:51.160 --> 36:58.680]  And you look at a guy like Belief comes on here and he says he's been doing that for 20 years, almost with some plants and no degradation.
[36:58.680 --> 37:02.600]  You know what I mean? So, you know, those are things that hold a lot of truth.
[37:02.600 --> 37:05.280]  Like you said, Brian, you hear all these things in the forums.
[37:05.280 --> 37:08.880]  And like for me back in the day, all I could do was read the forums.
[37:08.880 --> 37:10.680]  I couldn't, I would never comment.
[37:10.680 --> 37:12.240]  I would never dare comment.
[37:12.240 --> 37:18.520]  I was actually like almost scared to have the account name, but I'd go in there and just lurk and try to read all I could.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.960]  And I'd just be in there like, man, this motherfucker don't know what he's talking about.
[37:23.200 --> 37:24.400]  So many times.
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.720]  And it'd be like someone with clout, you know, like the guy that everyone kind of, you know, bosses everybody on the forum around.
[37:31.520 --> 37:34.000]  But yeah, forums, man, you got to take them with a grain of salt.
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.640]  They were kind of good little learning experiences, you know, kind of cutting your way up through the game.
[37:39.640 --> 37:42.880]  There's some good there, too, but you got to definitely choose.
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.520]  So one of the main ones back in the day was this thing called Overgrow.
[37:47.520 --> 37:57.200]  It was a forum, at least for the ones that I knew about that I went to, was for more of the advanced or maybe wanting to hopefully become advanced farmer.
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.640]  That's where I first noticed Super Soil, learning how to do that kind of stuff.
[38:02.160 --> 38:15.240]  When you were mixing all this stuff, sticky and working with the recipes, were you putting it in the kiddie pool pond and covering it with the tarp and then uncovering it, not realizing that the white stuff was good and freaking out?
[38:15.240 --> 38:21.480]  I mean, there was just so much, you know, you're making something like almost like a Frankenstein soil, especially back then.
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.400]  And you don't really know what to do when it starts to come alive.
[38:24.400 --> 38:30.160]  And I kind of wanted to go through that process because Super Soil is definitely on the right track.
[38:30.840 --> 38:33.240]  But I've always felt like it was missing something.
[38:33.240 --> 38:41.800]  And I remember I gave a talk once where I made like the step ladder and I felt like it was like the spike strips.
[38:41.800 --> 38:46.360]  I'm spacing the gentleman's name, but like it kind of went from that process.
[38:46.360 --> 39:08.600]  So it went from like the spike strip feeding, feeding the soil system to then the building and kind of creating your own Super Soil system to then a living soil system, which I define that as having the soil food web, having diversity, having it actually be a soil system, not just like a soil is medium with microbial accents.
[39:08.720 --> 39:15.000]  Even though I understand from some people's that, you know, or at least the way that they're farming, they're trying that aspect first.
[39:15.600 --> 39:23.120]  But like you had mentioned, if you're really trying to get the full genetic profile of your plants, the soil, the microbial world is what's going to bring that out.
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.880]  And I've never heard anybody say that basically, you know, the genetics kind of flipped on you.
[39:28.120 --> 39:37.880]  You know, you knew it as one way, probably sold it to the homies as one way, started to farm it and then realize that, hey, wow, now this is the morning smoke to get things going.
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.120]  Which is a drastic difference, obviously, for what you're trying to achieve.
[39:42.120 --> 39:48.880]  And it makes a lot of sense, man, with just getting real genetics, having the microbes break it down.
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.760]  And if you're new to this stuff, again, Sticky's saving you a lot of time and a lot of experience.
[39:53.760 --> 39:56.720]  You don't have to sit there on the forums, read through all the bullshit.
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.320]  I always like to joke, Sticky, that with that stuff, man, you'd ask somebody a question on the Super Soil.
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.240]  If it was like a Thursday or Friday, you might not get an answer till Monday or Tuesday.
[40:07.480 --> 40:09.080]  Now this shit is instant, boy.
[40:09.080 --> 40:15.400]  So please, if you're new to this, take advantage of that stuff, because that didn't exist back then.
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.040]  You would ask a question and hopefully the right individual would give you the correct information.
[40:21.360 --> 40:25.040]  Yeah, you keep checking back, check back tomorrow, check back the next day.
[40:25.040 --> 40:27.280]  I was on a Roll It Up.org.
[40:27.280 --> 40:28.000]  Roll it up.
[40:28.040 --> 40:31.400]  Yeah, it was a lot of OK stuff on there.
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.120]  But yeah, man, what it was, Brian, like you said, that Super Soil, the only thing it was missing was
[40:37.280 --> 40:40.280]  he could have took it and talked more about the biology.
[40:40.440 --> 40:46.040]  He would have added that biology to that, you know, because for the most part, the amendments were fine.
[40:46.040 --> 40:46.720]  You know what I mean?
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.880]  And even the, you know, using the soil, it would heat up and that was that microbiology cooking.
[40:51.880 --> 40:58.360]  But it wasn't the kind of step that was missing, was just talking about the nutrient cycling and the importance of that like we do.
[40:58.640 --> 41:06.160]  You know, but definitely, man, there's so many natural farmers and people that do the living soils that really started with the
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.120]  with Super Soil because it was somewhat of a progression.
[41:10.120 --> 41:11.960]  You know, it was better than just soil.
[41:11.960 --> 41:14.320]  You take a soil and now you're adding to it.
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.120]  So shout out to Rest In Peace Up Cool on that.
[41:19.680 --> 41:21.680]  But yeah, man, well named, right?
[41:21.840 --> 41:25.000]  I mean, when you're talking with the homies and like, yo, you heard of Super Soil.
[41:25.240 --> 41:27.000]  I don't care where you were back in the day.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.920]  You'd at least sit down and listen to that gentleman.
[41:29.280 --> 41:30.760]  Yeah, you want to hear about that?
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.880]  Yeah. Super Soil.
[41:32.920 --> 41:33.480]  All right.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.200]  I made I did the biggest new thing with like probably my first batch of Super Soil.
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.920]  So I make it in one of the totes or bins and, you know, it's amended.
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.240]  I'm good. Put it in there.
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.600]  Well, I start looking in on the top of the soil looks dry.
[41:49.640 --> 41:55.600]  Well, let me add a little water, you know, so I'm slowly I just kind of adding water throughout this cooking process.
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.760]  And when it came time to use it, man, the fucking bottomless thing smells so ammonia.
[42:00.760 --> 42:11.440]  It was so, you know, so anaerobic that I pretty much had to just toss it outside and in my in my yard, you know, but just, you know, living and learning, man.
[42:11.440 --> 42:17.160]  You know, those microbes got to have that certain environment and definitely can't over water them and saw them out like that.
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.960]  We had the same problem with the little kiddie pools, man.
[42:20.960 --> 42:24.600]  That's why we started to study about the composting worms and stuff.
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.920]  Yeah. Like, man, there's got to be a way to fix this problem because the super soil made sense.
[42:29.920 --> 42:37.280]  But a lot of self inflicted wounds, you know, if you didn't mix it correctly, you know, you're you're talking to somebody.
[42:37.280 --> 42:38.840]  So you kind of like putting everything in there.
[42:39.360 --> 42:45.320]  Let's face it. You know, if you're really being honest with yourself back then, nobody was really focused this on the way that they should have been.
[42:45.600 --> 42:52.640]  The you know, just even with the inputs that you were spending, like there was just it was very poorly managed.
[42:52.720 --> 43:05.440]  And so now you're able to take this information, know what inputs you need to buy, forget all that other bullshit and kind of start slow and go and build things up and have progressive and successful flips.
[43:05.960 --> 43:07.280]  So you have a little money in your pocket.
[43:07.280 --> 43:17.800]  So this doesn't become discouraging because one of the first worst things that ever happened and that that is kudos to the forums for getting you through certain things is when you would have a flip that would get hit with Russet.
[43:17.800 --> 43:19.280]  And you never experienced that before.
[43:19.800 --> 43:20.960]  So you lost everything.
[43:20.960 --> 43:22.480]  You still had to pay all those bills.
[43:23.040 --> 43:32.440]  I hope that no one ever has to experience that because they are taking their time listening to these shows and other podcasts and people kind of explaining why.
[43:32.600 --> 43:40.680]  Like you had mentioned, the pheromones where certain pests are showing up potentially because maybe you've you know, sometimes it's really got to gut check yourself.
[43:40.720 --> 43:43.120]  You know, you, your team might have slipped up somehow.
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.880]  There's something going on here where it's not as healthy as it was.
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.320]  And that's why I've always been a huge proponent of once your team is up and thriving, nothing.
[43:51.800 --> 44:03.720]  There's nothing better than money, you know, money well spent than having your team go out there and just look for issues, especially when you're in the larger commercials, because you can solve so many problems when you just have a solid team like that.
[44:04.240 --> 44:05.640]  Definitely, definitely.
[44:05.640 --> 44:08.560]  One thing I want to add to that, too, man, is like genetics.
[44:08.560 --> 44:15.800]  Like I remember back in the day, I remember searching a lot like and I was searching in like, you know, inputs.
[44:15.880 --> 44:19.600]  You know, thinking that the answer was like in some bottle somewhere.
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.040]  You know, and I see a lot of people that do that when you're young, when you don't know.
[44:24.400 --> 44:34.840]  And if you really focus on now that we know, focus on your soil and good genetics, everything and lighting environment, everything's just going to take care of itself.
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.560]  Like it used to be, you know, when a new bottle because, you know, everybody read magazines.
[44:39.560 --> 44:41.880]  It wasn't all this Internet as it is today.
[44:42.160 --> 44:48.440]  I would actually go to the bookstore and buy, you know, high times by magazines by the different.
[44:48.480 --> 44:50.800]  So you can be up to speed on what's going on.
[44:51.360 --> 44:55.840]  And, you know, and it was like you'd see the new ad for the new the new bottle.
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.480]  And you're like, oh, this must be good.
[44:57.480 --> 45:00.120]  It's from the Netherlands or Dutch or wherever.
[45:00.120 --> 45:00.880]  You know what I mean?
[45:01.280 --> 45:04.160]  And, you know, searching for those different inputs.
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.280]  I wish I could have had some of that time back because I just didn't you know, wasn't up to speed on it.
[45:09.280 --> 45:13.800]  So now that you guys, if anybody's listening to us talk, man, we're telling you this shit from experience.
[45:13.800 --> 45:14.920]  Like this is the way to go.
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.040]  Like get on in this living soil, natural farming.
[45:19.080 --> 45:24.640]  You don't have to go. You don't have to go to as hard, go as deep as you want to go, but definitely get yourself a living.
[45:24.640 --> 45:32.720]  So start focusing on your microbes, start making your inputs and your cannabis and your everything's just going to be so much better.
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.080]  So it really is terpene wise.
[45:36.080 --> 45:37.520]  All the big dogs come on here.
[45:37.520 --> 45:43.320]  They say it. They say, hey, maybe yield isn't as high, but quality is always going to be better.
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.040]  You know, so, you know, this is my little two cents.
[45:47.040 --> 45:50.400]  If you guys haven't heard it yet, we like living soil around here.
[45:52.520 --> 46:05.960]  Now, with what you said about the I think it's a matter you may initially get less yield when you're doing living soil, but that means you just have to get your soil to a more mature state.
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.400]  And then and wait to groom it to get to that point.
[46:10.640 --> 46:12.960]  And it's going to be it's going to be very different.
[46:13.920 --> 46:19.160]  When I had the super soil and coots mixed, I had them in two three by threes.
[46:19.160 --> 46:27.360]  And and so the super soil ended up going through 12 cycles and the coots went through 11 before.
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.120]  I just recently ripped everything out and started all over again because I just couldn't.
[46:33.120 --> 46:37.040]  So the way I had my beds built is there was a lot of sodium built up in them.
[46:37.080 --> 46:43.080]  And that's one of the problems with the especially with subcools mix is that you end up creating a lot of sodium.
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.360]  And I don't know if it's just from the the bat guano or the bird.
[46:47.400 --> 46:49.120]  Nina, that's probably where it's all coming from.
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.560]  But it was interesting that it didn't appear that it was given causing any problems.
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.320]  I could just you just know from that level that it has to be doing something.
[46:58.720 --> 47:11.280]  But I think the microbes were really hooking it up because it was because I got into the point that my yield was almost as much as it was when I was using using salts.
[47:11.960 --> 47:21.120]  And then it really dawned on me when I made this big switch three, four cycles ago that and I started all with brand new stuff.
[47:21.160 --> 47:24.760]  And did I realize the yield cut down in half?
[47:25.280 --> 47:29.520]  So I was like, wow, it just reminded me that how much I've been missing.
[47:31.120 --> 47:41.680]  I need that mature soil and how much I was actually getting out of a 12 cycle soil, even if it had a high sodium content and wasn't really mixed the way I would mix it today.
[47:43.600 --> 47:45.320]  And now I'm actually starting.
[47:45.360 --> 47:46.560]  I just finished my third cycle.
[47:46.560 --> 47:47.640]  And that's what you guys are seeing.
[47:47.640 --> 47:50.360]  My numbers are starting to come back after the third cycle.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.800]  So it's pretty remarkable.
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.480]  I'm still not where it was at a 12 cycle, but it's getting there.
[47:56.520 --> 47:59.040]  And so that's pretty cool.
[47:59.240 --> 48:00.080]  That's bars.
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.240]  That's bars right there, because I mean, that's that's you started a new set, new set up.
[48:05.600 --> 48:07.920]  You went down by half on a third cycle.
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.040]  You're already starting to pick back up now.
[48:10.400 --> 48:14.040]  Why? I ask people a lot like I never test my soil.
[48:14.040 --> 48:15.920]  I probably need to, but I don't.
[48:15.960 --> 48:20.680]  Is it because you one day had a wild hair and you said, let me test this or nothing's really going on.
[48:20.680 --> 48:22.040]  But let me see what's happening.
[48:22.040 --> 48:24.400]  You saw those high numbers and that kind of triggered it.
[48:24.400 --> 48:27.240]  Or was it did you see some other deficiency or issues?
[48:27.680 --> 48:30.800]  So I just didn't know what was going on, man.
[48:30.800 --> 48:32.320]  I didn't know what was going on.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.200]  I just didn't know what was going on.
[48:34.240 --> 48:36.360]  I wanted to know what was happening in the soil.
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.880]  You know, by mixing bottles, you have to think about anything other than pH.
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.560]  Right. So, you know, going I just need to know what was going on.
[48:43.560 --> 48:44.720]  What do I need to add?
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.640]  You know. So anyway, I mean, that's just where I went.
[48:48.640 --> 48:56.480]  So actually, who who tests my stuff is and I'm like, I get into the weeds on things, do a lot of reading.
[48:56.480 --> 48:58.520]  I mean, I have notebooks of notes.
[48:58.880 --> 49:05.720]  So, you know, if I can, I can always easily go back, figure out what I was doing and why and, you know, what my results were.
[49:06.320 --> 49:08.400]  So I'm very diligent in my notes.
[49:08.400 --> 49:09.800]  And I wish I could still be better.
[49:09.800 --> 49:18.600]  But. Oh, so I actually use Logan Labs and two and I've been using them for.
[49:18.640 --> 49:20.000]  I don't know, about four years now.
[49:20.000 --> 49:29.000]  And and I get the soil doctor to do the reading for me and tell me what's up.
[49:29.720 --> 49:32.400]  And you guys had had him on before.
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.280]  Brian. Brian.
[49:35.120 --> 49:36.880]  Yeah. Yeah.
[49:36.920 --> 49:39.360]  Shout out, Brian. And I'm waiting for I just said it.
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.840]  So Logan Lab just got my soil sample today.
[49:41.840 --> 49:45.360]  So I can't wait to see where I am at at this point in time.
[49:45.800 --> 49:48.080]  Would you? What kind of mix did you do?
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.640]  What was your basis for your recipe or what do you use?
[49:52.200 --> 49:57.440]  This new soil. So I went it's a mixture of.
[49:59.360 --> 50:08.440]  Pete and Cocoa Core and hummus and perlite and.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.600]  I can't believe I can't think of anything with all the crap that I put in there.
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.800]  And then just amended, though, but that's kind of correct.
[50:16.960 --> 50:18.760]  That was my base. Exactly.
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.120]  That was my base. And then and then I was just the many stuff from there.
[50:22.360 --> 50:25.560]  You know, I threw some wall wall last night in which gives you your calcium
[50:25.560 --> 50:29.840]  and sulfur, which is I mean, I got that from from Brian.
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.200]  I mean, that's a remarkable rock to put in substituting your soil.
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.960]  So I did that to make sure I had some of those things and then had him test it.
[50:38.960 --> 50:40.640]  He told me what to put into it.
[50:40.640 --> 50:42.280]  And so I just went from there.
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.680]  And, you know, there's always some sulfates you have to add into it and
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.720]  different meals. And, you know, I'm at the point now that I'm three cycles in
[50:53.720 --> 50:55.560]  and I did better on this third cycle.
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.920]  I can't wait to get the results back to see where I'm at, because being able to
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.960]  compare cycle to cycle like that, I'm able to really know exactly what I used.
[51:05.160 --> 51:08.640]  Now, I may want to add more to it at some point, but you want to keep things in
[51:08.640 --> 51:11.600]  balance. And so if
[51:13.560 --> 51:16.600]  you know, I don't he just does he just does a really good job at it.
[51:16.680 --> 51:20.360]  And he's actually pretty conservative with what he suggests to people as well.
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.240]  So you do have wiggle room if you want to add a little bit more of this or that to
[51:24.240 --> 51:26.560]  it without getting it thrown out of whack, you know.
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.400]  But, you know, some days you're adding you add a little bit of gypsum, a little bit
[51:29.400 --> 51:33.440]  of wasp tonight, a little bit of phosphate, sulfate, phosphorus sulfate and a little
[51:33.440 --> 51:36.640]  bit of manganese sulfate, you know, all these things.
[51:37.640 --> 51:40.080]  And you just get your stuff dialed in.
[51:40.120 --> 51:45.480]  And during that entire process, you're working the hell out of those microbes and,
[51:45.480 --> 51:52.400]  you know, add in jail after, you know, any of the stuff into it to at certain points
[51:52.400 --> 51:54.160]  in time to keep it growing.
[51:54.200 --> 51:59.680]  And, you know, we just it improves year or cycle after cycle.
[51:59.680 --> 52:00.760]  It just improves.
[52:02.040 --> 52:03.960]  That's interesting. Shout out, big worm.
[52:03.960 --> 52:05.760]  I see you out there. Interesting comments.
[52:05.760 --> 52:09.600]  So a doctor hated our salt levels, too, but we see no issues.
[52:09.600 --> 52:12.560]  OK. Hey, man, that's all about interpretation.
[52:13.400 --> 52:18.440]  Like I imagine if I tested my old soil, I probably salt levels are probably somewhere
[52:18.440 --> 52:19.680]  out of somebody's range.
[52:19.720 --> 52:22.240]  But right now, plants are freaking kicking it.
[52:22.240 --> 52:23.920]  So we're just still rocking with it.
[52:24.080 --> 52:25.680]  And I'm going to get you on here soon.
[52:25.680 --> 52:27.320]  Big worms in the schools over home.
[52:28.480 --> 52:33.400]  So sticky when you did this new flip, when you're, you know, guess guess doing your
[52:33.520 --> 52:38.000]  living soil 2.0, did you still reach for the guanos in that mix?
[52:38.280 --> 52:42.280]  Oh, no, no. There's no there's no manures, no, none of that stuff in that.
[52:42.680 --> 52:45.160]  So it does seem like the community's moved on from that.
[52:45.160 --> 52:47.560]  Like that's more of like the CD player aspect.
[52:47.560 --> 52:48.920]  We're on to MP3s.
[52:50.080 --> 52:59.440]  We've had MP3, but it's the yeah, I mean, it's one of those things like I just don't
[52:59.440 --> 53:01.160]  think you need it. I mean, I think.
[53:03.920 --> 53:07.200]  Adding the natural mineral.
[53:08.240 --> 53:13.840]  And specifically targeting targeting what you're looking for makes more sense to me,
[53:13.840 --> 53:18.600]  it's not it's not like chemically derived stuff, I mean, a lot of this stuff, some of
[53:18.600 --> 53:26.120]  it is, but you can find a lot of this enzyme based specific nutrient, not nutrient,
[53:26.120 --> 53:29.240]  let me try and think of, you know, all it elements.
[53:30.080 --> 53:32.160]  There's a minerals, minerals, yeah.
[53:32.160 --> 53:36.160]  So you can just get the specific mineral to do what you need to do because, you know,
[53:36.160 --> 53:39.600]  you want to keep adding gypsum to stuff because that's going to jack up your system
[53:39.600 --> 53:46.360]  over time. So having multiple calcium sources within your system allows those microbes to
[53:46.360 --> 53:48.240]  convert those things over in different ways.
[53:48.240 --> 53:51.600]  And that's why I have so much sulfates, you know, all that just gets converted sulfur
[53:51.600 --> 53:54.040]  and, you know, that's going to make our stinky, stinky plant stinky.
[53:54.280 --> 53:57.520]  And so, I mean, it makes a lot of sense to me that way.
[53:57.520 --> 54:04.080]  And then using the JLS and, you know, blooms and veg stuff that I got going on
[54:06.600 --> 54:12.880]  just accentuates, I think just adds that little extra, even doing like a limo liquid
[54:12.880 --> 54:17.640]  IMO, you know, spraying that on the leaves and all that adds that little extra layer
[54:18.120 --> 54:24.360]  that I think all the soil mixes sort of that's what they they've been missing.
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.160]  You know, that gives you that extra last 10 percent is like limo, you know, and or that
[54:29.160 --> 54:35.560]  last twenty five, 30 percent is adding these K&F amendments and some of the compost,
[54:35.560 --> 54:38.160]  you know, that you've been working on or something adds that little extra.
[54:39.440 --> 54:43.360]  A lot of individuals are talking about limo, so I was hoping maybe we could talk about
[54:43.360 --> 54:47.000]  that. They're saying that's their secrets, part of the secret sauce, especially laid
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.040]  into flour. Some individuals are talking about that they spray it routinely like they
[54:52.040 --> 54:55.400]  don't stop spraying it even, you know, the last week or two into flour.
[54:55.920 --> 54:57.320]  What are your thoughts on that aspect?
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.040]  Because some people from from the peer group that I've had have tried that and it's
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.920]  they gave themselves powdery mildew.
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.080]  Well, I it's I have never had powdery mildew, man.
[55:09.080 --> 55:11.960]  Like I don't even I I live in D.C.
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.920]  It gets humid in the summertime, but it clearly doesn't get humid enough.
[55:15.200 --> 55:21.760]  And I got red clover out in my front yard and some other perennials that get powdery
[55:21.760 --> 55:22.920]  mildew like crazy.
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.520]  So I know it's everywhere around here and I've never had it in my room.
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.000]  So I don't even know how anybody.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.240]  So my assumption is a lot of these guys are probably living in just more humid
[55:34.240 --> 55:35.240]  environments anyway.
[55:35.920 --> 55:42.360]  From my standpoint, I haven't gotten ballsy enough to go spray limo far in the flour.
[55:42.360 --> 55:45.280]  You know, I'm still at that maybe a three week point.
[55:45.280 --> 55:53.640]  Maybe I was at in January, went out to the region conference out in Humboldt and Chris
[55:53.640 --> 55:56.440]  Trump was there talking about limo.
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.560]  And he was talking about exactly what you just said.
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.160]  Some people go far into it.
[56:01.160 --> 56:01.880]  And.
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.600]  It was I know he was fine with it, it's just something that bugs me out about spraying
[56:09.600 --> 56:12.760]  brown stuff on my on my trichome heads.
[56:13.280 --> 56:16.320]  So I just haven't gotten there yet.
[56:16.320 --> 56:20.640]  But I think I'll probably get to that point.
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.800]  I mean, of all these guys are doing it, I should probably at least spray it on a couple
[56:24.800 --> 56:30.760]  of them and see how that goes over time just to see what that extra result is going to
[56:30.760 --> 56:34.720]  be. Because I mean, if you're there outside, they're going to get sprayed with shit on
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.160]  birds and bees and everything else is shitting on the plants and the.
[56:39.760 --> 56:40.880]  Nobody wants to smoke.
[56:43.280 --> 56:45.720]  Think about it. That's true.
[56:47.520 --> 56:53.240]  I like that. I go to a third week and then once I start seeing pistols forming, I said
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.000]  I'm not spraying anymore because I feel like what is what are you going to really gain
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.120]  from going three weeks?
[56:59.120 --> 57:00.520]  OK, so you're in week three.
[57:01.280 --> 57:02.840]  How far are you going to spray?
[57:03.080 --> 57:08.400]  And then what do you I don't know what you really gain, you know, when with liquid ammo
[57:08.400 --> 57:14.760]  being a liquid indigenous microorganism, it is just that it's not a secret fertilizer
[57:14.760 --> 57:16.240]  sauce. You know, it's not like that.
[57:16.240 --> 57:19.920]  It's like it's going to build that microbiology is going to keep recharging it.
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.760]  So instead of spraying it, if you want to keep using it, I keep soil drenching it all
[57:24.760 --> 57:26.400]  the way. It's not going to hurt you.
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.440]  You know what I mean? If you want to brew on, brew it up and soil drench, I do the same
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.240]  thing. Just going to help feed that microbiology, give you that diversity.
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.480]  But I don't know, feeding, you know, spraying things like that late in flower, because,
[57:39.480 --> 57:43.320]  you know, even if you guys didn't realize that if you were to take your flowers, even
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.320]  grown indoor and wash them with just a mild diluted white vinegar and water solution,
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.640]  you'll be surprised how much dirt and particles and pieces are even on your indoor
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.960]  cannabis. So, you know, to me, I'm trying to keep those flowers really clean towards
[57:58.960 --> 58:00.640]  the end because that's going in my lungs.
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.920]  You know what I mean? So I don't necessarily need everything in my lungs to
[58:05.360 --> 58:06.840]  be beneficial that way.
[58:06.840 --> 58:10.400]  So just my perspective on spraying later flower.
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.600]  Well, I mean, you know, and that's one of the and that's why I wash everything.
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.480]  I mean, I don't keep anything for flower anymore.
[58:19.520 --> 58:24.040]  I wash everything now and so it's clean and that's how I know it's going to be clean.
[58:24.040 --> 58:29.520]  But one of the things I also do pretty much for shits and giggles really is I spray
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.440]  hypochloric acid on my plants, which is I don't know.
[58:34.800 --> 58:37.400]  I got one of those fancy.
[58:39.280 --> 58:41.440]  Bogger. No, no, no.
[58:41.440 --> 58:45.000]  It's at a what the hell that thing called?
[58:45.360 --> 58:49.200]  It's the. What the hell is it called?
[58:49.240 --> 58:50.640]  It's that magic.
[58:51.840 --> 58:57.160]  No, fuck it basically is like that, that that really expensive pH adjuster thing so
[58:57.160 --> 58:59.480]  you can get, you know, 11.
[58:59.480 --> 59:01.320]  Oh, dosage, not dosage.
[59:01.360 --> 59:03.080]  I mean, in water. There you go.
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.000]  So I have a king and king and machine.
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.160]  I know I see Brian's.
[59:07.360 --> 59:14.800]  So I got caught up in that bullshit and it's I appreciate it, but I don't appreciate how
[59:14.800 --> 59:17.680]  much the fucking thing costs and it's not worth the money.
[59:17.960 --> 59:19.720]  But structured water.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.720]  No, it's not structured water.
[59:21.720 --> 59:23.880]  It's I don't know, Brian, go on.
[59:23.880 --> 59:24.840]  You want to say something? I see.
[59:25.240 --> 59:30.320]  No, I just there's a lot of people out there that were that were really pitching it there
[59:30.320 --> 59:35.880]  for a second. And I think I think if, you know, there's an incentive for somebody to
[59:35.880 --> 59:39.280]  tell you about it because that's how the marketing thing was pitched, then you should
[59:39.280 --> 59:40.960]  definitely second guess things like that.
[59:41.640 --> 59:46.280]  Because when I was kind of traveling the country there for a minute, it seemed like
[59:46.280 --> 59:49.800]  every stop there was somebody trying to sell you one and let you know, like, hey, you
[59:49.800 --> 59:51.200]  can make money selling these two.
[59:52.040 --> 59:57.440]  But from what I understand, you can dial in the pH and basically pick your magic wand.
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:04.360]  And then from that point on, you can have it at X, Y, Z, pH, and it'll do magic things at
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.760]  that level. And then you can dial it in for different things.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.520]  One of the people that were like kind of pitching it to us in Oklahoma one time, I
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.960]  remember the entire time he was telling me this, all I could see were russet mites
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.200]  throughout his room. So, again, kind of kind of realize what you're up against.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:31.360]  If you're just thinking that pH water is going to take hold of a russet mite issue that
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.800]  they didn't even know about, by the way.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.680]  So you got to kind of you kind of got to know where your priorities are at.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.520]  Don't get caught up in the latest technology.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.640]  The best technology, again, is to put it into your people, spend time with your people,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.800]  build your team up because they're the ones that are going to be like, hey, room three
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.120]  over there just doesn't look right.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.400]  And then everybody let's have everybody walk in there.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.200]  What do you guys see?
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.240]  All right. I've noticed this.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.560]  Oh, these deficient. Oh, it doesn't seem like there's enough air movement over here.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.640]  That's that's really at the end of the day, the technology that's going to allow you to
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.160]  succeed in the commercial side of things.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040]  And then it's on you on the personal.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.160]  Right. So it's up to you every day to check on that stuff.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.680]  And if you're growing with a living soil system, I think you should I would say at least
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.600]  24 hours, maybe every 48 hours or if you're going on vacation, like have a friend.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.680]  But that never seems to work out either.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.080]  But, you know, the goal for farming with a living soil system, in my opinion, should not
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.440]  be that the pitch is that there's you know, it's less time with your plants.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.960]  It's more time with your plants.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.120]  You're setting things up. And then that allows you the freedom to kind of do whatever you
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.200]  want in your life and then just kind of take care of the plants as needed.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.280]  So, you know, God forbid, like, you know, my my daughter came.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.240]  Right. So if I was farming at that moment, I would have had to split.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.920]  I probably wouldn't have been able to come back.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.760]  But if I'm farming in a living soil system, I'm allowed to have those few extra days to
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.000]  the golden ball and chain, where if I was farming with a different method, I probably
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.560]  would have had all kinds of issues just with the way that, you know, kind of those setups
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.400]  are. Especially flooding rooms sometimes.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.160]  The dreaded flood.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.880]  And just to clarify on the spray and laid in flower, it's more I wouldn't even want
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:22.040]  pure the purest angel piss water sprayed on my flowers because I'm growing out through
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.200]  flower. I don't want a chance getting any kind of mold or bud issue.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.080]  So it ain't about the biology and you can eat worm castings, but you don't want to
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.280]  stuff on your bus. Plants are loaded with biology, but I'm not going to deliberately
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.360]  spray any kind of liquid moisture on my plants because, first of all, it's humid as
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.720]  hell in Virginia. So I'm constantly fighting to keep the humidity down in my spaces
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.320]  anyway. So I'm damn sure I wouldn't want to add to that by, you know, spraying late.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.360]  So that's more for the youngins out there.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.640]  The experienced folks, y'all know what y'all are doing.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.160]  Spray your shit, do your thing.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.920]  But I wouldn't want the youngins out there just spraying and all the way through flower
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.200]  and getting issues that they could have maybe avoided.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.760]  Yeah, you you need successful flips before you start doing like more of these kind of
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.200]  like advanced tips and tricks and stuff.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.280]  I wouldn't even suggest doing like LS low stress training and that kind of thing, like
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.120]  just grow plants, grow healthy plants.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.360]  And then the second flip.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.360]  All right. Now that I know how to grow healthy plants, then start to manipulate and try to
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.280]  improve things. But just having healthy plants alone for a lot for a lot of us,
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.040]  especially at the beginning, that was the biggest obstacle.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.640]  It was almost like you were used to seeing deficiencies.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.760]  Hey, man, this style doesn't seem like it has as many deficiencies as this style or,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.160]  you know, being attentive to certain things also.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.720]  It's like, yeah, if you really break down how often you're in your grow room mixing
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.440]  things so focused on pH like sticky stock about especially with a lot of those old
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.680]  school like Amsterdam type formulas, it definitely mattered.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.400]  You had to buy a blue lab pH pen because you couldn't be off with that kind of stuff
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.760]  where now this is just a game changer system.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.840]  And again, it's you know, we're all just kind of believing in Mother Nature and finding
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.040]  ways to improve on that.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:13.040]  And how do you not buy into that system because it's out there doing its thing time and
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.400]  time again? I mean, you walk outside, walk a little bit away from like a golf course,
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.280]  whatever, and see nature for itself when it's out there and it's it's lush.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.080]  There's always something covering it.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.120]  You know, there's there's just a different aspect to what they would consider healthy
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.280]  lawns like in a golf course compared to what I can.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.600]  You know, we consider healthy plants where there's such diversity that everything's
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:41.320]  taking hold. And when you can really manage that in a microcosm system indoors, that's
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.240]  when you're going to really grow the medicine that you want for yourself.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.600]  Or I know a lot of individuals that watch the show, they want to eventually become a
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.600]  commercial farmer. And that's that's really where it's at.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.040]  I mean, you get you get your skill set and then you find ways to to kind of break
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.680]  through. And then once you're on the commercial level, you know, that that's your
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.280]  opportunity to kind of really dial things in because it makes such a difference, man,
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.080]  when you're talking about like just a couple of percentages.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.720]  So if you know, Sticky, that you're going to run just these two genetics because it's a
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.520]  brand new company and you want to kick off and you don't want to lose all of that.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.280]  That's what a lot of individuals have.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280]  They just start to run out.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.880]  They, you know, hunt. They're starting a new company, new brand.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:27.240]  And the backbone of anything, even when you're hustling back in the days, you needed some
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.880]  kind of stable. We always called it like the mortgage payer.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.080]  You needed at least one plug that was putting things in.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.360]  And then you're always kind of moving.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.600]  And, you know, there's there's certain people that come throughout your life in and out,
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.920]  but you always needed that one ride or die plug.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.800]  And it's obviously the same thing when you're doing these genetics.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.920]  You need to find those.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.200]  And it makes sense why you only found two.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.160]  There's very few ride or dies out there.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.680]  So the fact that you found two and they want to ride with you is, hey, at least you got
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.680]  those two girls.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.840]  You know what, man? I'm just so stoked that I even got those two.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:03.320]  I mean, and literally I just watched my boy, Ev's stuff just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.920]  And he even described he knew he's a Virginia guy.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.240]  So he just started growing.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:15.320]  Right. And he just got these seeds that were just in a bag that were just like label
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.760]  blueberry by GMO.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.840]  And that's it. And he just threw him in.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.880]  And he immediately identified that this plant was bad ass from the beginning.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.280]  And he was really he made some dry sift and I tasted it and it was beautiful.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.080]  And then when I finally washed it, that was going to be really a deciding factor, man.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.840]  And I was just blown away.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.240]  I mean, it was immediate.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.520]  I could tell that this thing was a unicorn.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.360]  And I mean, I haven't found a unicorn in five years, you know, and I mean, find this
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.720]  one. So this now have like three things that are kicking out.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.040]  Five percent is just amazing to me.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.240]  And, you know, I don't know if people have better luck than I do.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.800]  You know, I don't know what other people do.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.680]  But, you know, I you know, the big commercial players are they're buying cuts that
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.520]  people have already gone through and looked, you know, they're not all necessarily going
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.440]  through their own pheno hunts themselves.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.320]  And then so, you know, they just had more opportunity to find stuff.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.520]  I just don't think there's that many out there unless it's a belief or somebody or, you
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.200]  know, several other breeders out there.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.840]  I just don't think you're going to be lucky.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.280]  And everybody says, well, you're always going to find one in a pack.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.280]  You're always going to find this.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.200]  You're always going to find that.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:37.320]  And I mean, I appreciate that, you know, but yeah, you're going to easily find something
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  great out of a pack if you're looking for flower.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.400]  I don't think you're ever going to you aren't always going to find something in a pack.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.600]  She does. I know if you're looking for large trichomes that make rosen.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.480]  OK, boom.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.840]  That's the key. That's the difference right there is because you can find flower.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:00.280]  You can find those winners and flower because flower is more of a looks, smell, taste
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.360]  effect, whereas the the hash process is more of like a physical process.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.520]  It's more of a physically how much is coming off of the plan.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.760]  That's not something that you can, you know, alter.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.040]  Right. I mean, so if you don't if just because that plant smokes well and it doesn't give
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:23.080]  you that for washed and yeah, I can totally agree that in your way of thinking for hash
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:28.560]  purposes, I bet it is a lot farther apart to get those three, four percent of them,
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.280]  especially the fives, obviously.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.160]  But yeah, definitely like flowers.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.280]  And I think that's more of the claim is you'll find a winner in a pack, you know, but not
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.520]  necessarily a winner that's going to squish, you know, high percent.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.920]  That would be awesome now if they can get that kind of guarantee.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.120]  And that's where I go with the I'm sorry, Brian, I go with the, you know, if you find a
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.120]  winner, it's a unicorns, because like I said, I mean, that chem dog was 20 years ago.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.480]  Cookies out of five seeds.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.080]  I found one that was five years ago.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.360]  My boy found, you know, one of the blueberry.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.600]  You have no idea until you wash and you squish these things, process them, you know, so
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.680]  it's well past the three months you've been growing the damn thing.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.600]  And you're like, oh, yeah, this is going to turn out great.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.040]  You know, you're smelling it.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.720]  It doesn't matter what it looks like, what it smells like.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.920]  You cannot look at your growing plant to know that it's going to actually produce
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.760]  something at the end for Raja.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.840]  Yeah, that was something I wish people would have told me back in the days, the amount of
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.000]  time that would be wasted, even just growing like clones from your buddy instead of just
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.200]  growing out your own seeds.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.120]  I mean, it was just, you know, none of the genetics were what they claimed to be.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.360]  You know, you just knew it as whatever, tried to grow it better than your, you know,
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.920]  your little network there and try to sell things.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.480]  It's a whole different game now.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.320]  I mean, you're you're kind of an old school guy that has obviously continued to merge
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.800]  his skill set so that you can manage the entire process.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.520]  I was hoping to I don't think I got a direct answer to this question, so I was hoping to
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.000]  ask, do you do you think unicorns are truly at seven, eight percent?
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.240]  Do you do you think some of the individuals that are on Instagram that say 10 percent
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.200]  exists? Have you ever personally seen that?
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.240]  I mean, how high do you think this stuff's going to go?
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.640]  Are these all fish stories?
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.680]  You know, I think generally.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.440]  You know, a lot of the guys are going to the more trichome heads that's covered over top
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.200]  of your buds, that's how you're going to be able to identify that you're going to be able
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.880]  to get your seven, eight, 10 percenters.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.520]  So when you're looking at these just large heads, buds that people are taking pictures
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.240]  of that, you know, you can't even see the green of the plant anymore because it's so
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.360]  covered in trichomes.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.400]  That's where you're going to get your additional percentages out of because you have
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.800]  more trichomes, you know, the old chem dog and even the cookie, the cookies and cream
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.200]  that I have. It's not completely covered in trichomes, you know, and that's why I'm
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.720]  getting five percent. But if I doubled my trichome coverage, which I can, you know,
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.400]  genetically see how that can that can occur.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.960]  Plus all the pictures you see, I should be able to go from five to 10 percent easy if
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.880]  I'm double the number of trichomes, I should be able to get to 10 percent.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.960]  Now, I think you can push that, though, real quick.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.360]  I think it's all genetic.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.440]  So so, you know, you look at like.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.840]  Like Mac one or something like that, that, you know, every time it's just completely
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.120]  covered, you know, you can't see the weed.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.560]  You only see trichome heads.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.760]  You know, that's where you're going to start seeing that.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.920]  That's just where that Dublin's going to be.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:44.440]  And then you have other people like trying to think, I think Shwell measures his
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.400]  trichomes all the time, you know, between that and his.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.480]  Yeah, he measures all his trichome heads.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.160]  I mean, that's beautiful science right there, you know, and that's real science.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.240]  Like if you're not paying attention to that shit and wanting to go out and buy his
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:05.400]  stuff, you know, that's how you're going to make good trichome or good, good rosin
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.400]  is because this dude's putting in the work and it seems like it's legitimate.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.000]  And that's how you're going to identify these things.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.480]  But I can see you getting 10 percent.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.360]  I don't know if it's going to ever get, you know, it's not going to be like a, you
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.120]  know, breast implant like triple D's or something like that hanging off these
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.200]  flowers. But I think 10 percent is doable because you're doubling the number.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:35.320]  And if you can double the number and get a pheno that produces large trichome heads
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.080]  that are filled with all kind of good juice, then I think 10 percent, 12 percent
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.120]  could even be possible.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.400]  I just don't think you could go over 15 percent because there's not enough room on
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.520]  the plant. And those trichomes are only going to get so large and they'll just fall
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.800]  off themselves or something.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.760]  You know what I'm saying? Like you'll get to a point that it's just not you're not
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.320]  going to you're out diminishing returns.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.960]  Damn boy, if you're if you're growing these plants and your trichomes are falling off,
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.720]  that would be next level.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.440]  Yes, it would. But you'll notice, man, when you clip when you clip them, you clip clip.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.360]  You'll see some you'll see a little trichome, especially on belief.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.480]  Shit stuff like this.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.200]  Chad showing. Yeah, you'll see covered.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.760]  Covered. Which plan was that right there?
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.800]  That's not mine. That must have been Kool-Aid man.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.960]  Beliefs. That was the Kool-Aid man from.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.040]  Yeah. So the Kool-Aid man ought to be cured up real nice by now.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.800]  We're working on trimming. It's the last one to go.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.160]  But I got I got another 10 ahead of it.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.840]  So I've been doing since I got back.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.960]  But yeah, you mentioned frosty and well, the snowman has to come and play.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.000]  You probably got a few heads in the bottom of that tray.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.040]  I imagine. Oh, yeah.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.440]  Hey, what I wanted to ask you, Chad, real quickly,
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.960]  what kind of stuff were you smoking when you were flying out there on your
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.440]  on your journey?
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.080]  I mean, was it is it worldwide?
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.400]  Everyone seems to keep elevating their game.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.320]  No, a lot of a lot of just kind of basic generic stuff out there.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.560]  As far as the flower goes, there was only a couple of areas where I was like,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.240]  this is grown like, hmm, you know, kudos.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.680]  It was more so about the hash, which, Marco, when you go to grab your stuff,
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.120]  I definitely can get into that with Sticky District because I fell in love with it.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.880]  And, you know, picked up another book here.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.680]  I'll try to get it to focus later.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.640]  But yeah, that that that dark black hash, man.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.880]  Well, why don't you just go and go get into it, man?
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.640]  And I'll hustle back because I don't want to miss much of it.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.720]  If you want to now, Chad, we can catch it later.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.000]  Word. Yeah. Let's see.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.400]  Let's see if I can get the let me let me I'll turn my blur off here.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.280]  But yeah, you know, they're they don't have concentrates there.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.200]  So it's flower or this hash.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.200]  And there are a lot of people who don't smoke the flower.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.360]  So there are just a lot of pure hash smokers there.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.840]  But again, it's weird them not having concentrates.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.800]  I kind of figured they they would
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.880]  doing two things at once here.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.880]  OK, so yes, hashish, the joy of making and curing.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.200]  And it's all about, you know, the the temple balls and the dark stuff.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.240]  And it's it's a lot of, you know, what you mentioned,
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.400]  just kind of like sifting and making the temple balls out of it.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.640]  Oh, there's a bunch of good stuff in here, like, you know, lovely pictures.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.040]  But I've started to started to make some here.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.080]  I had a whole bunch of dry sift that I had ready to go.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.880]  And that's actually kind of one of the questions
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120]  that Cheddar Bob had thrown in here at you.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.760]  Do you ever use dry sift
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.520]  other than your wash or how does dry sift play into it for you?
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.040]  I've never done dry sift.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.160]  The driest stuff I've ever run was I just had like a old bag
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.320]  in the bottom of a freezer that accumulated a bunch of shit over time.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.400]  And, you know, ultimately it turned in like a gallon bag of just
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.440]  stuff. And I decided to press that one time.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.400]  And I think there's probably in my IG way back, you know,
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:21.440]  it was like totally different colors of stuff, but it was all dry.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.680]  And I pressed I I I squashed it and I was pretty impressed.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.520]  I mean, it gave me this crazy, gnarly ball of stuff
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.720]  at the time, you know, but it's not I don't do dry sift, you know.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.760]  OK, because that's that's kind of what I had just to play around here is,
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.080]  you know, a bunch of extra from as as I trim.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080]  I've got, you know, the trim bin and stuff.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.960]  But yeah, see, those are some lovely, lovely looking nice balls.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.800]  Nice balls. Nice balls.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.080]  But so, yeah, I'm pressing some I'm getting ready to go into the cellophane
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.200]  and let it dry and cure for a while.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.840]  Just again, that's what we enjoyed most about the smoke there, Brian,
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.960]  was was just the accessibility of the different hashes.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.240]  And the hash is actually cheaper than the flower.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.920]  Go figure, man.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.520]  Yes, that's cool.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.640]  And have you also run do you ever grow outdoor at all or is it indoor primarily?
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.800]  It's all indoor. It's been a long it's been a long time since it was outside.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.000]  So, you know, I've tried I've thought about rolling the dice
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.680]  and growing some hemp out out front or something, but I don't even know.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.680]  I don't feel like you're drawing that attention.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.240]  Yeah. Well, we leave.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:37.800]  Same here.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.520]  I thought about just growing hemp to see what would be a good cultivar
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.040]  to work on the coast and, you know, kind of start that aspect.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.720]  But then again, I was like,
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.400]  yeah, not not worth the explanations that I would have to repeatedly do.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.720]  Right. OK. I was thinking about putting having to put a sign out there and say,
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.280]  this is really hemp underneath the farm bill is totally illegal.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:56.880]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.640]  Like, like, don't don't fuck with it.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.920]  But that'd be the probably the only way I could do it.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.960]  And yet some teenagers still got to run in there and snip it.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.120]  Of course they are.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.240]  Right. And the day before I would go out there, it's going to be gone.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.400]  You know, they know, they know.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.280]  All right. So that that negates the question of getting the same return
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.280]  or if you've had anybody that you've known or worked with,
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.960]  if they've run the same cultivar indoor and outdoors,
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.360]  if there was a difference in return between the two.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.480]  Yeah. None of none of us.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.520]  It's always been indoor for all of the everything that I've been growing.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.760]  I think
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.960]  we may try to start growing something outside here soon.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040]  And not here, but in Virginia where you can grow outside
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.480]  and just see how this this goes.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.720]  I mean, I'm curious.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.920]  I can't wait to see what Sun does.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.920]  I mean, I've the closest I came to Sun was having a plasma.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.200]  So. Oh, wow. OK.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.760]  So, you know, but besides that, you know, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.360]  I can't wait.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.280]  Cool. Virginia will end up being I'm going to be that dude on a farm
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.040]  in Virginia at some point, and that's what I'm going to be growing.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.640]  My growing outside then.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.720]  Nice. And I see Marcos getting ready there in the background.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.520]  Did the plasma live up to the to the height?
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.200]  Because at one time there was only like one or two companies
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.560]  and they wouldn't let you buy it. You could only rent it.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.800]  So, you know, I've wanted to talk to you about this for a long time, Brian,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.320]  because it's pretty funny.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.360]  So I had a soil on demand plasma,
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.440]  which is in the United States.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.160]  You know, it's a.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.240]  That's the one that was mostly in the States is basically,
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.240]  I think, a Swedish or company that created it.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.320]  They licensed it here in the state.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.440]  The company who created it in in Europe,
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.680]  they're starting now to sell you in the United States.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.160]  But I can tell you that I was highly impressed
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.520]  with that damn plasma from the soil on demand.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:02.320]  Now, I say that because it fully was the sun.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.920]  I mean, I was in I was growing that thing in the wintertime, dude,
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.600]  and had like a full on tan like I was living at the beach.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.040]  You know, I mean, it was full on 100 lumen sun full on, dude.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:19.200]  Like it came with sunglasses and tanning lotion.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:27.120]  And sunscreen like 50 SPF 50, dude.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:27.920]  It was crazy.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.040]  And I could tell because, dude, I was so tan.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.120]  It was just beautiful, man.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.240]  And and but the plants loved it.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.160]  Everything loved it.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.760]  The problem is, is it heated up my room higher than a thousand watt HPS?
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.000]  And the the the the part they sell you on is that the light,
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.480]  you know, they give you the conversion that the plasma light converts
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.880]  more light than heat, which is different than HPS and everything else.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:21:00.560]  However, the fixture, not the light, dude, puts out so much freaking heat, dude.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.480]  It was the it actually required me to have more condition
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.360]  air conditioning than it was with the HPS because it was so hot.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.000]  And it sounded like a freaking like Learjet flying,
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.560]  land and it was so goddamn loud, dude.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.280]  You know, it's like it should have came with earplugs, too.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.800]  What that thing cost at the time?
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.760]  Too damn much. Yeah.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.120]  Top of the line. Top of the line.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.320]  Shit. And that shit was like deer spotted bright, though.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.120]  Dude, like I mean, like burn your retinas out bright.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.800]  I mean, because it's full on
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.240]  ultraviolet light shining in your eyes, dude.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.000]  Like literally. I mean, honestly, I really love the thing.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.800]  I mean, the ball, it's like it makes this noise and it almost it turns.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.680]  You can see it like building up and then it does like this nuclear explosion.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.200]  Boom. You know I'm saying?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.080]  And it turns into this gorgeous violet light, which is ultraviolet.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.640]  Right. Just gorgeous.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.680]  You're just burning your retinas out as you're staring at this thing.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.920]  And the beauty of it.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.000]  And then it ramps up over two minutes to three minutes to get to
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.400]  as bright as the fucking sun.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.560]  I mean, like you can't stare at this thing, dude, without burning your eyeballs out.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.640]  And what I'm telling you, man, the plants loved it.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:25.840]  The that's when I started noticing the terpene changes in my chem dog.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.400]  And that's really what set it off.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.760]  Now I went through two grows with it, but I fucked up, man.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.560]  I was spraying some shit and they got all up in the fan
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.120]  and then fried the fucking thing.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.160]  And and then all of a sudden I pissed away like five grand or whatever.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.160]  Fucking thing. Yeah.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.680]  So but my back story with that is is Brian is
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.320]  the chick who I was talking to cat.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.000]  Do she brought your name up?
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.080]  And it was funny because I just heard about you at the time.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.880]  And I was like, she goes, you know, Brian, whatever your last name is.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.440]  And I was like, the deal with the bunnies.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.800]  She's like, well, he does a lot more than that.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.680]  And I was like, I know he probably does more than that.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.920]  But I just know about the bunny.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.360]  So she brought her.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.480]  I will wear that badge.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.320]  Oh, yeah. The guy with the bunnies.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.200]  It's all about the bunnies.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.200]  But it was Lionhead, baby.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.480]  Lionhead bunny for sure.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.760]  It was just interesting because you've always asked about it,
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.880]  but they knew who you are and, you know, their name dropping.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.640]  So it was just interesting.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.280]  And I appreciate what they're doing.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.080]  You know, I'm on board with what they're trying to do.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.600]  I saw great results with mine.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.000]  And if I was in a large facility with 20 foot ceilings
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.360]  and it was all about conditioning, that would be something
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.280]  that I would highly think about
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.520]  because I do believe it was better than the
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.960]  because I have a faux LED now.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.560]  And I would say I was growing better underneath that than this faux LED.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.480]  But with my LED now, dude, I have no air conditioning.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.840]  I have no issues whatsoever.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.920]  You know, my electric bills less than half of what it was
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.200]  when I was running air conditioning, HPSs or that plasma.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.040]  I mean, you can't I mean, I'll deal with the lower returns
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:12.800]  or a little smaller, fewer turps or whatever for the save all that money.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.520]  And on your vision.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.320]  Yeah.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.360]  One more thing before I bounce back out, guys.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.560]  Nico D made a comment.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.400]  I think I said Keefe here says Keefe's traditionally makes it to flowers
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.640]  while tobacco use the proper terminology.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.760]  Yes, that's absolutely right.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.800]  Keefe really isn't the proper terminology.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.880]  I recently did an interview, worked on an interview with Madam Canoli,
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.840]  where she kind of explained the difference and related
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.240]  how she was kind of irritated with Robert Carnell Clark and those guys
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.040]  for popularizing that as Keefe, because that's what we all say now.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.600]  But that segues into something you guys were talking about earlier.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.600]  How does it get potent after over time?
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.160]  And this was something that I know Frenchie was working on
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.560]  as his trichome research initiative.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.920]  They sent in samples of hash to a lab in Canada,
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.200]  and they're continually testing it as time goes by.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.600]  And this site is this is the six month study, but it gives you some of the
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.240]  cannabinoid changes and percentages as well as terpene results.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.440]  So if anybody was interested in following up.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.920]  No, that's great, man. Further.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.200]  Yes. Just let me scroll back.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.520]  It's his trichome research initiative.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.600]  Frenchie Canoli.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.800]  That'll take you right to it.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.280]  But that's on his website. OK. Yeah.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.200]  Just wanted to pop that one in there, but let's go.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.640]  The old heads would talk about that with the temple balls and be like, no, no,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.080]  it really does work.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.320]  And then I felt like on the forums and stuff, everybody would shit on it.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.560]  It's like, look at the color. It's bullshit.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.360]  Why would you waste your time?
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.280]  So it's really cool to see man science and just experience
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.920]  kind of shining through, obviously, with the with the data coming through
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.680]  on that kind of stuff.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.080]  So, yeah.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.360]  And being so fresh from it and not a normal concentrates person.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:06.200]  It was awesome to hear you guys open up talking about the sticky, icky that I love.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.280]  So I'll turn it back to you guys.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.240]  Thanks for letting me interject there.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.800]  All good.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.440]  I, Marco, you take it, you're set up, sir.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.600]  All right. Yeah, we can do that.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.720]  I wanted to just do a quick Bokashi.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.240]  A lot of people.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.240]  I'll go back. A lot of people
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.280]  hear what Bokashi, you know, what Bokashi is, is basically taking
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.240]  fermentation bacteria and inoculating grains
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.760]  and then now using those grains to inoculate other things
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.280]  such as a bucket full of food scraps.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.000]  And what will happen is these microbes is bacteria, mostly bacillus.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.760]  If you think L.A.B.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.320]  what they'll do is they'll kind of pre compost this food
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.760]  so that when it's broken down, it starts breaking down
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.640]  the kind of the tough fibers of the food and then biology gets in it into it.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.000]  And then what happens is when you take that food scrap
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.120]  that's been inoculated with Bokashi, it breaks down really fast in your soil.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.760]  And a good example of a piece of broccoli or an apple,
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.400]  if you just throw that into the soil, it's going to take a fair amount of time
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.160]  to break down.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.320]  If I pre compost it using the Bokashi method,
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.360]  that time is cut way down.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.800]  Like if you take that piece of broccoli out of a Bokashi bucket,
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.680]  now you can easily squeeze it with your hand.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.040]  It'll break up and kind of mash out.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.200]  Whereas if you notice kind of how a stalk of broccoli is before you cook it,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.120]  it's really tough and hard.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.640]  So Bokashi is really easy.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.560]  And I'll go ahead and switch over to the other camera quick.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.200]  And it doesn't take a lot of ingredients.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.760]  Can you still hear me fine?
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280]  Yeah.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:57.880]  So what I want to do is I've got here, I've got wheat bran.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.480]  Are you able to tilt your phone sideways, though?
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.440]  We can hear you fine.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.200]  But yeah, let me see.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.920]  Perfect. Give everybody the full full meal part.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.240]  Boom. Thank you, man.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.080]  All right. Got you.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:16.530]  Locked in there.
[01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:18.490]  All right, Ricky. Ricky mistake here.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.640]  So while he's setting up here,
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.080]  I've been kind of playing around with Bokashi's
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.360]  and it obviously is breaking down like a reptile manure quicker.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.840]  And then the springtails are taking hold.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.960]  And then the isopods are breaking down things quicker.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.200]  It also seems like when I sprinkle like a cover crop,
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.080]  the mounds are building when you're adding more of this
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.240]  so that the soil system kind of continues to grow a little bit.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.440]  So it's going to be really unique for me kind of trying to grow.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.080]  I don't even know what I guess I'm trying to grow in a reptile
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.640]  for a bearded dragon.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.440]  But one side is obviously like extremely hot, beachy, 110 usually.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.360]  And then the right side is where he gets his water
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.560]  and hunts and that kind of stuff.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:12.080]  So Bokashi to me is kind of a game changer when it's when you
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.680]  I guess beforehand, the traditional sense was you put them on a
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.920]  like a putt putt mat, like that kind of carpeting that you'd like
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.600]  practice golf indoors on.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.080]  And then when the animal defecate on that, you would throw it away
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.760]  and get a new piece.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.800]  So things are obviously kind of changing with using Bokashi.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.320]  Exactly. So I got the camera turned a little bit, guys.
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.040]  All right. So, yeah, Bokashi, man, like like Brown was saying,
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.160]  I think it's very key.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.280]  It's just it's pretty much grains inoculated with lactic acid bacteria
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.920]  or different types of fermentation bacteria.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.040]  So what I do is I have wheat bran here
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:54.120]  and you can use anything for not anything, but you here you can use oatmeal.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:00.440]  Um, people have used sawdust, like use the right kind, like hardwood sawdust.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.360]  Don't use anything treated, obviously.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.640]  So along with the wheat bran, that's that's what we're going to inoculate.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.680]  And then I need a food for the microbes.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.240]  And that's what I'm going to use this sugar for unrefined sugar.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.840]  That'll be my micro food.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.360]  And so we need our microbes.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.760]  If you guys make L.A.B., that's fine.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.280]  This is my own one of my own concoctions, one of my versions of fermented beetroot.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.760]  And so this is an FPE loaded with the same fermentation bacteria
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.000]  that we want to inoculate this Bokashi with.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.800]  So I'm going to use that.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:45.080]  And then I'm also going to use just regular rainwater, uncoordinated water.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.920]  And what I want to do, I'm going to go ahead and mix the
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.920]  um, I'm going to mix my liquids together.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:00.160]  And I hate that I don't have my camera set up perfect, but you guys can see it.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.040]  So I'm going to go and pour that beetroot in.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.280]  Remember, this is my this is my microbiology here.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:10.000]  This is my you know, this is my L.A.B.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.880]  This is what's going to be inoculating those brains.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:19.560]  And now what I have to do is put a sugar source and that's going to be my unrefined sugar.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.560]  I use raw sugar like demerara or jaggery.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.800]  I actually had this sitting since last Wednesday.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.240]  We're going to do this last Wednesday.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.000]  So it's taking sugar set up a little bit.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.640]  But all you want to do is you're going to take your liquid ingredients, mix them together.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.160]  And then I'm going to just basically pour those into my.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.400]  Um.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:56.350]  Brains, do you have to worry about mixing up that sugar after you pour it in?
[01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:58.470]  Yeah, I should have.
[01:31:59.190 --> 01:32:09.230]  Yeah. You know, Chad, if we weren't doing like trying to do this right now, I would have went ahead and stirred in my sugar really good and got it diluted into the liquid before I poured it here.
[01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:13.910]  But like they say, with the magic of TV.
[01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:18.830]  And I'm just a curious George to sell exactly.
[01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:25.630]  So what you'll do is you'll just basically pour in enough water to fill to cover your brains.
[01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:43.830]  If I had a stirrer, I'd go ahead and stir this up once your brains are covered, the key to the process is an airlock, because when we close this up, if you didn't have an airlock, the microbes are going to be in here growing and multiplying and populating.
[01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:49.870]  And you get a pressure build up and they probably blow your blow your jar.
[01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:53.790]  So key thing is label it as well.
[01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:57.670]  Put your date, your what you got in there.
[01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:02.350]  I know what I got. And in about two weeks, this will finish fermentation.
[01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:06.430]  And what I do is I go by the bubbles like tomorrow morning.
[01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:07.790]  This is going to start bubbling.
[01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:12.270]  And so that's telling me now microbes are growing because the bubbles.
[01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:16.990]  So once the bubble stop, that tells me the microbes have used up all the sugar.
[01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:18.750]  They're no longer growing.
[01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:32.150]  And then what I'll do is I'll take this brand, which is now going to be a wet, mushy brand, spread it out on a piece of cardboard or tarp and you could just let it sun dry, air dry in the shade.
[01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:34.590]  Turn it air dry.
[01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:40.790]  And then what you'll get is basically a dry grain, which is now inoculated with the L.A.B.
[01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:42.870]  And then that could be a great input.
[01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:46.630]  It can go right on top of your soil and mulch over top of it.
[01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:48.110]  You can put it into teas.
[01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:51.830]  You can use it to inoculate your your Bokashi bucket.
[01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:55.030]  So a lot of people, I don't mind, you know, buy things.
[01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:59.150]  But if you really want to get self-sufficient, you can make a lot of these things.
[01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:04.230]  You know what I mean? And now I'm going to have about five or six pounds of Bokashi.
[01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:05.670]  That I can easily use.
[01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:07.190]  And it's costing me very little.
[01:34:07.190 --> 01:34:17.910]  You know, if I used oatmeal, this would have been three or four dollars worth of oatmeal, what, 50 cents or a dollar worth of sugar and then some lactic acid bacteria.
[01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:23.830]  And then you can pretty much make your own Bokashi for, you know, less than pennies per pound.
[01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:28.070]  You know what I mean? So it holds that beet color, Marco.
[01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:32.550]  Yeah, it'll keep some of that red because I use the beetroot ferment.
[01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:35.310]  So when it dries up, it'll be kind of pinkish.
[01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:38.510]  I mean, it looks fire, dude.
[01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:44.550]  Yeah, so it's just another, you know, like, guys, I'm always trying to just try to do one thing further.
[01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:45.710]  You know, we do L.A.B.
[01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:47.710]  Well, why don't we add the beetroot?
[01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:55.510]  You know, now I got the component of the beetroot that earth root, all those, you know, plant extracts that came out of that.
[01:34:55.990 --> 01:35:02.190]  And then now, OK, so the beetroot, the beetroots and FPE fermented plant extract.
[01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:10.590]  I take fresh beets, I take equal weight sugar and I mix them together just like we do in FPJ.
[01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:21.790]  And then I let that from I call it ferment, but I let that sugar kind of pull out that liquid out of the beets for a day, like overnight.
[01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:26.230]  And then the next day you'll have that beet sugar mix, which will be in your jar.
[01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:32.190]  And now I want to fill the rest of that up with water and then add in my lactic acid bacteria, my L.A.B.
[01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:34.950]  Now that would be my fermented beet.
[01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:41.910]  Same process. I'll go until the bubbling stops and then that tells me the beets are fermented.
[01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:43.750]  So that's an FPE. I strain that off.
[01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:46.670]  And now that you know, I just keep that for its own input.
[01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.830]  Yeah, alcohol is definitely part of the fermentation.
[01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.590]  It's a step in fermentation.
[01:35:53.950 --> 01:36:00.790]  But remember, we're going for we're just going to grow these microbes until the bubbling stops.
[01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:06.070]  You know what I mean? If you left this for long, a long time, sure, it would end up going to alcohol.
[01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:08.790]  But we want that L.A.B. that's growing in here.
[01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:15.510]  Once they start stop bubbling that airlock, then I know that they're they're done growing.
[01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:17.590]  And that's as far that's as much as they're going to grow.
[01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:20.270]  So, yeah, you could make alcohol, but not this way.
[01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:29.830]  Hey, why why do you have to what doesn't have to be have enough sugar in it, do you have to add more sugar to it or you did you reduce the amount of sugar because you eat?
[01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:37.030]  No, so, you know, I wanted to get beats to have some sugar, but it's a very low concentration.
[01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:41.430]  It's it's not enough to ferment itself.
[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:42.910]  I guess it probably could.
[01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:47.430]  But I wanted to add that lactic acid bacteria to speed this whole thing up.
[01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:50.510]  It might take a lot longer trying to work it that way.
[01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:55.030]  I love that beast you see as a man.
[01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:57.430]  Yeah, that is good stuff.
[01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.190]  That's actually that's some tasty stuff, too, man.
[01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:03.630]  It tastes really good. It's good for, you know, beats, beats, good for your blood.
[01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:04.870]  It's got a lot of iron in it.
[01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:05.590]  Very good.
[01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:06.670]  Let's do the beats.
[01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:10.790]  I know it's like nobody likes beats.
[01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:13.070]  But if you make a F.P.E.
[01:37:13.110 --> 01:37:15.990]  taking a shot of beat, you know, F.P.E.
[01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:19.550]  would be very beneficial for your body.
[01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:22.190]  And you're going to see that dirt flavor to it.
[01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:23.390]  You know, exactly.
[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:24.190]  And they don't like it.
[01:37:24.190 --> 01:37:27.270]  But I'm like, you just got to love it because that's the best part.
[01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:28.950]  Actually, exactly.
[01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:32.470]  And that's what I feel like happens with your plants, like you using that root plant.
[01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.670]  And I like that. I got these locally grown.
[01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:37.110]  They just started sprouting on the tops.
[01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:39.270]  You know, the tops are wanting to grow out on the beach.
[01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:43.190]  So I'll use them right then when they were kind of really good, ready to get vigorous.
[01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:45.750]  And I feel like that just really puts a lot of,
[01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:49.030]  you know, just gives you that strength of root,
[01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:51.790]  you know, adding into your soil and into your plants.
[01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:54.390]  And I just think that's key, man.
[01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:58.100]  A certain times.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.580]  I was wondering if
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:04.580]  if if we could bring up some of Sticky's work and you could kind of talk about
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:09.100]  how you're getting the consistency that you are and kind of the artwork,
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.540]  because there is a bit of artwork and aspect to this that
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.740]  I think a lot of people get frustrated.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.180]  They see you putting up stuff like this
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:21.740]  and then they try it and they don't they don't achieve that same result.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.700]  So let's kind of go through how you especially kind of kind of consistency.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:32.340]  You know, it's it's all trial and error and it doesn't matter.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.540]  It all depends on the cultivar, but it's how it's grown.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:39.100]  It's the cultivar, how it's grown.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:43.860]  I mean, I mean, I get different consistency's different each round, honestly,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.420]  because I mean, all like those last four updates,
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:49.500]  I think they were all cookies and cream.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.740]  They all came from the same wash, the same batch. But
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.180]  and I made them all in the same rosin.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.100]  But then all the post processing was different.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:03.860]  Like this particular one actually was on a heat pad
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.740]  for 24 hours, which resulted in what you're seeing there.
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.420]  The one prior to that was on the heat pad for 12 hours
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.060]  and made it like a little crust on top of it.
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.100]  Yeah, this one right here.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:18.460]  I mean, this is the first time I've actually seen this happen.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:22.420]  And it's because I don't think I either went usually go short
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:25.540]  a few hours or I go like 12, 24.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  And this is the first time I'd actually seen it crust over like that.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:32.700]  And with so much turps underneath of it,
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:36.620]  because I wanted to show some Marcos kind of teaching you guys
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:40.060]  what's kicking off, what's giving you the spark to start that soil system.
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.380]  And then obviously the end result is, you know, if you trust the process,
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.500]  this is what you're eventually going to get to if you put in the time
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.100]  and effort to get where you're at.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:53.700]  And this was not achievable, in my opinion, five years ago.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:57.060]  You know, very few people would have been able to achieve this.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.700]  And now it's basically if you if you want to go and get it.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.820]  So Marco's giving you the tools at the beginning.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:06.220]  And then I love having you on here, Sticky, to kind of show us,
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.860]  you know, how you're kind of moving through that.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:12.500]  And then it all you know, every product comes from flour.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.820]  So flour is where it starts.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.620]  But to really take it to this level is artwork.
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.900]  I love that gold color, too, man.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.980]  Your color, that orange is gold is an amazing color.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.540]  Now, we chatted the other day
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.020]  and going about about going 70 days.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:31.500]  And I think that was key that I took away from that is that you actually run
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.620]  all your all your flowers, 70 at the minimum, don't you?
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.180]  Yeah, dude, this one's 77 days.
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:41.180]  OK, so anytime somebody tells you if you pull early,
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.340]  it's all if you don't pull early, it's brown or whatever, dude.
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.340]  That's a beautiful gold color.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.020]  Seventy seven days.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.700]  And you can see the white underneath of it.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.620]  So what happened is the terpenes float to the top
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.900]  and give you that nice solid layer, which you can literally just keep like this.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.900]  And it will never oxidize underneath that liquid layer.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:05.900]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.940]  So it'll stay like that, you know, forever.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.620]  Not a long time, I should say so.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:14.820]  But that is the whiteness that some people say they look at.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.380]  But to me, you just missed all the terpenes out of it.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.940]  You didn't get the terpenes because a lot of that terpene stuff is
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.460]  is those last few weeks.
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.540]  And those heads are just getting larger and larger and filling with terpenes
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:31.100]  and cannabinoids, but certainly the terpenes, especially if you go back
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.260]  and put a little bit more blue light on and stuff,
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:36.300]  you end up getting something.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.300]  But this is 77 days.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.660]  This is the longest that I have gone with any of my cultivars.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.860]  It was 73 days before that.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:46.460]  But I have been running 70 for a long time.
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500]  I got tired of running 63 days.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.420]  I didn't even understand what the hell I mean.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:54.420]  Understand why they just said, you know, 63 days.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:58.780]  So what I'm finding with all the genetics, even cookies and cream,
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:04.060]  which is all indoor stuff is is gives me better results
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.420]  at 11 weeks than I would be getting at eight to nine weeks.
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:12.140]  That's a little bit of a bar on that, because I go 70 as well.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:17.660]  I feel I think that last few days after 63 is really when a lot happens.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:21.980]  Yeah. And to achieve that, that at least here, Debra,
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:25.060]  that's called like more like a creme brulee, like you're creating your.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:26.980]  Is that what that's called out there?
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.060]  Well, I mean, I don't honestly do the names of things I can't keep track, bro.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:33.260]  Like everybody calls it different.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:36.380]  You know, they say cold cure and ain't no cold nothing about cold cure.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.460]  So, I mean, I mean, when you think cold, you think like 40 degrees.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:41.180]  I ain't putting this shit in 40 degrees.
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:43.380]  In fact, you don't even want to put it in the refrigerator
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.780]  unless you want to keep fresh press, you know.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:49.660]  So, I mean, if you're going to pull after you prep, you want to make fresh press.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:53.380]  Well, you know, within an hour, some people say like 20 minutes or so of pressing.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:55.260]  You got to get that right into the in the
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.980]  freezer and stop any processes at that point in time.
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:04.380]  But besides that, you want to keep heat on it.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:07.700]  I mean, generally what people are saying is it's buttered, it's aged.
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:11.700]  You know, if you leave your if you leave a grandma rosen out,
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.900]  it's going to butter up, it's going to age.
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:18.860]  Well, all this post-processing does is just hurries that process up.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.380]  That's it. And, you know, I've always liked
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:27.140]  I like the consistency of, you know, from that,
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.100]  which is like a pull and strut, like a taffy
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.140]  all the way up to the wet stuff you were just looking at.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.500]  That's what I like.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.820]  You know, I don't like soupy stuff.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.220]  You know, I don't like things that the turps stay in the bottom.
[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:44.860]  You know, I like it more homogenized so that every every dab is the same dab
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:47.220]  all the way through the product, you know.
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:51.700]  I mean, that one is like an orange creamsicle.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.860]  I mean that I mean that is wow.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.980]  That's some nice looking stuff, man.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.420]  No, thanks, man.
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.500]  I mean, the way the way that crust with that white up under there.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.140]  I like that creme brulee, Brian.
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:04.260]  That's that's what that is. That's creme brulee.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.500]  And that's the difference, dude.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.900]  So that was three hours on a heat pad and I pulled
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:13.100]  and then the other one was 12 hours.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:16.420]  And then the next one was 24 hours.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.740]  And that's sort of just on the heat pad.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.780]  But cultivate what temperature?
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:22.580]  Sorry.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:26.140]  Oh, it's I mean, honestly, it's just it's like a 90,
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:29.180]  like 100 degree feed starting mat type thing.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.620]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.940]  Gotcha. So it's like 90 degrees, 80, 90 degrees somewhere around there.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.740]  If you have a hot plate that you can dial it in to that point,
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:40.260]  that's what you would want to do, too.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:44.980]  And other people put it in, do oven tech and put them in jars
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.900]  and, you know, heat it up, you know, using 220 degrees
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.420]  and then it sort of crashes out, which is basically the that's how you make
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:56.100]  your diamonds, is that, you know, over time, that pressure builds up.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:01.060]  It forms the THC diamonds and you sort of see it cloudy inside.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.220]  And then at that point is when you want to pull it all out of the heat
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:06.580]  and then you, you know, let it crack.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:10.620]  So so part of the diamonds is you got to have the right machinery
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.180]  to make the diamonds.
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:15.020]  That's another thing that makes it so elusive in a way.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.620]  Well, it's an oven. I mean, I have an oven.
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:18.980]  It's not a pressure.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:19.940]  No, no, no.
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:22.900]  The pressure is built because you put it in a jar, a sealed jar.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:26.340]  So pressurizes itself with that heat.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.620]  And then that's something you have to pay attention to.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:33.020]  I mean, if that that reaction can happen is 20 minutes.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.140]  So, you know, you really have to pay attention.
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:39.780]  And then if you go too long, then it just turns it.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:44.180]  It stays sort of homogenized as the crystals go away.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:48.380]  And then you basically it's better to make carts out of it at that point.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.900]  You just keep going. Let it stay soupy.
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:52.060]  It stays liquid.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.780]  Then it stays in that permanent state.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.940]  And then you fill carts and smoke out of that.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.300]  And the carts don't get clogged because that was the biggest.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.780]  Well, no, not if you go to this.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.940]  You know, if you get it all the way to that point,
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:10.980]  it's not thick enough and it's the same viscosity or as you would
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.300]  any other cart that you're going to smoke.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:18.940]  If if they put weird stuff in it, I don't know what they put in carts. So.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.580]  I think it's usually like vitamin E oil and shit, and they mix it
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.740]  with acetate or something like that.
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:30.060]  Yeah, there's some and some people put terpenes into it
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.180]  to make it, you know, more juicy like
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:37.980]  I if I'm making rising carts, I would I would go all the way to the point
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:40.780]  that I just said and then and then go from there.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.860]  But it shouldn't clog up.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:46.500]  I mean, because you're using the new technology with the ceramic
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.300]  thing on the inside, whatever that one
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.940]  is, the element, the heating element.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:53.940]  Yeah, so it should be fine.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:57.980]  Yeah. And I don't I honestly I don't make it because it's not something I want.
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.900]  So, you know, I know how to make it.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.860]  And I've I've fucked up to get to the point.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.860]  And I didn't make carts because I didn't feel like going through all that heartache.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:10.100]  I just sort of drizzled that juice on other shit.
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.700]  Oh, I'm going to waste it.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.020]  That's crazy. Yeah, definitely.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.820]  Yeah. So you so so you basically you grow all your flour
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.900]  and you press all your work, man.
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.980]  That's pretty fucking amazing.
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.900]  Well, that's how I know when I fuck up, I'm going to grow inside.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.660]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:34.260]  I'm a I'm a tap in on you and bring a big bag up there.
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.380]  We're going to learn some stuff.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:38.620]  It's it's it's it's interesting, man.
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:42.220]  It's a lot of work. I mean, I don't it's it's to wash.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.780]  And I mean, Washington's hard work, dude, like a joke.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.860]  And, you know, unless you have a big ass machine that is automatic
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.340]  and you're not killing your back and stuff, I mean, just doing it at home.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:59.260]  And even if you're running five gallon bags, that's a lot of effort, man.
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.100]  I mean, that and I mean, most people go to get the little, you know,
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.860]  five gallon washing machine and.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.100]  Yeah, the little blue, the little blue and white boy.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.620]  That's what I got. Yeah, man.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.260]  I mean, that works.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.740]  I've used that for several years until I just got my stainless steel
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.820]  Brutalist that I got.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:17.620]  And and the only reason I really went that is
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.460]  I got tired of cleaning the plastic.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.540]  And then, you know, you don't want plastic touching this stuff.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.740]  You want stainless steel.
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.500]  You can clean it.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:28.620]  You know, you don't have to worry about any micro biology crap,
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.620]  you know, growing on it, no nooks and crannies deal with, you know,
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:36.500]  the cleanliness of how I'm doing it now with the stainless steel is just
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:37.420]  remarkable, man.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:40.420]  And, you know, but it's just a lot of work.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:43.060]  I mean, it's a lot of lifting and pouring.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:46.740]  I mean, your five gallon buckets, you know, you can always get set up
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.140]  that you can have a, you know, water transfer pump
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:53.860]  that's going to bring it back in and, you know, have it all circulated.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.620]  But, you know, it comes down to time and money and,
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:59.700]  you know, all the efforts that you got to put into it.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:04.620]  So but generally, it's a it's a long weekend for me.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:07.820]  You know, I basically harvest on a Thursday.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.220]  I put it in the fridge overnight.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.740]  I wash on Friday.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:18.140]  It goes into the freeze dryer for, you know, 24 hours or 20, whatever.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.220]  And then I'm pressing usually on Sunday.
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.500]  So, you know, and now what about that?
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.980]  Was that is that that same process you were telling me about
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.460]  where you didn't freeze?
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:34.100]  And is that, you know, it's crazy, man.
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:38.660]  Everybody talks about fresh frozen and I do fresh chill, man.
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:40.060]  I think this might be a first.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:42.140]  You're saying a fresh unfrozen, right?
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500]  Yeah, it's it's chilled.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:49.900]  I mean, I so it all started because I had too much damn ice in my freezer
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.860]  because I'm washing right.
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.460]  So I am in my freezer.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.420]  So I'm like, what am I going to do with my weed?
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.620]  So I was like, you know what? Screw it.
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.500]  I lowered the temperature in my refrigerator down to 33 degrees
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:03.260]  and it got down to 33 degrees and I put it in there.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.500]  Knowing full well that tricone heads
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:09.300]  get really brittle at 39 degrees.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.380]  So I knew I didn't need everything frozen at that point.
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:17.420]  And I knew once I threw it into the freezing cold water, it was going to freeze.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:20.540]  You know, I don't need the I don't want the flour frozen.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:23.060]  I want the tricones to fall off of it.
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:26.420]  And now you got to go bargain.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.220]  What you want?
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:31.340]  No, I guess I'm Tim listening because you don't want to try.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.300]  You know, you don't need the bud to freeze.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.700]  You need to try to come back. Correct.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.460]  So anytime you're going to freeze, freeze flour, you know, the crystals
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:41.740]  are going to pop through the cell membranes and you're going to have
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:43.260]  chlorophyll leaking out.
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.700]  I mean, there's no doubt we all know that that's what's going to happen.
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:50.820]  And so I started just doing this fresh chill, really just out of necessity
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.460]  to find out that my results were exactly the same.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:56.620]  I have not had any I no reduction.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:58.940]  You know, I scope as I'm washing.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.660]  I scope the weed.
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:03.980]  So I know that the tricones are all gone.
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:05.580]  They're not in the weed anymore.
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:07.420]  So I must have washed them all out.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.260]  So I know I'm getting through it.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.500]  You know, I'm not popping them.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.380]  They're not busted because they're still frozen.
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.980]  They're in 33 degree frozen water.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:19.540]  So with ice and stuff, so it goes comes out of 33 degree refrigerator,
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:22.060]  goes into an ice bath, ice water bath.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:26.860]  It doesn't get a chance to be unfreeze, I guess.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.500]  And I don't get any of that chlorophyll into it.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.460]  It's just less waste.
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:37.260]  And the results speak for themselves, like someone was asked me earlier.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.620]  What do you think about horizontal soil?
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.300]  Well, I don't have to think about it.
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:44.580]  I run it and my plants show me what they think about.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:45.660]  Like, that's the result.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:49.340]  So kind of your process is secondary.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:50.860]  Well, I see your results.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:53.820]  So how you get there really is people should be writing that down.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:57.100]  That could be very helpful, especially if you have limited space.
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:00.140]  You know, don't have two freezers.
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.340]  Don't have room for all the ice.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.860]  I mean, this could be a little gold bar right here.
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:09.100]  Well, and I've told people about it, you know, Brett Bird and what's his name?
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.460]  Botanic chemist, I think he goes by or, you know, botanic chemist.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.220]  He won like hash porn or something a couple of times.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.500]  But, you know, they've had never heard of it.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.380]  You know, it's always ever been fresh frozen.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:26.940]  I understand from their perspective, you know, they're dealing with lots, large quantities.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:31.020]  And if I'm coming out with a hundred pounds of weed, I ain't washing a hundred pounds in a day.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:34.460]  You know, and if I'm growing it and send it to somebody else, well, you got to freeze it.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.980]  You're not going to keep it in the refrigerator.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:40.980]  I wouldn't keep it in the refrigerator more than a few days, you know, because it's still going to age because it's not frozen.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:45.540]  So, you know, I think that 12 hour mark is key.
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:49.580]  And if you're going to have to go over a couple of days, well, you should freeze it.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.780]  You know, it's just not saying fresh frozen.
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:57.020]  I just don't think that's the it's not necessary to say I'm watching fresh frozen.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:02.660]  Yeah. So, yeah, I'm totally feeling you in a way.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:10.940]  In a way, we went to fresh frozen because most of the time it needed to be frozen for the reason you just
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:12.540]  mentioned, it's got to go to your buddies.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:13.940]  It's got to sit for a while.
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:15.540]  It's got to wait for something else to come.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.660]  So, yeah.
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:21.060]  So, you know, for you to kind of take that, that's called having an open mind, man.
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.820]  That's pretty damn slick right there.
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:29.500]  You know, that's pretty smart when you can kind of, you know, your results speak for themselves, but you're cutting a different process of doing it a little bit different.
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:35.820]  And it's interesting the tried and true, you know, you know, the big guys that do it, you know, it's interesting.
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:40.940]  They kind of didn't kind of want to listen more into it or think about it more.
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:43.460]  Maybe they have and feel threatened.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:48.140]  Who knows? You know, it's just, you know, they were both interested.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:54.060]  I mean, Brett had just not heard of it before, you know, and and Jonathan, who's botanic chemist.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:59.140]  I mean, he said he would run it because he thought it was intriguing, you know, and he's just, you know, some of those dudes just going to here's it.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.700]  Let's try and see if it works. But unless you're a home grower doing this.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:07.180]  Yeah, I it doesn't necessitate it.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:12.820]  So, yeah. But in fairness, man, that's most of our audience is newer to this.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:14.660]  I mean, as you try to break this stuff down.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:21.740]  So, yeah, I definitely gave him a gold bar for that, for saving time, whether trying to figure all this stuff out for sure.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:32.180]  And if you can be a to Z farmer, I mean, know how to grow your own genetics and then continue to educate yourself to the level that stickies that and create your own
[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:37.300]  creme brulee. I mean, this is again, I mean, it's like, where is this going to go?
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.420]  Because this stuff just keeps getting better and better.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:44.220]  Bright minded individuals teach a few and then all of a sudden a few years go go by.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:46.860]  And now, you know, the masses seems to know how to make this stuff.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.900]  And if you're definitely making creme brulee, you know, hats off to you because you're you're an elite.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:54.140]  You know, you're one of the elite.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820]  Yeah. I mean, sticky.
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.820]  You're one of the elite.
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:02.260]  You know, I mean, there's so many people that wish they could farm that manner.
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:16.460]  And I think you're lifting up the veil a little bit for a lot of people today, especially, again, the small time individual that just wants to keep quiet to themselves, not have to deal with anybody else and then knows that they're going to improve year after year doing this.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:21.780]  Boom. And Olivia Oliver Gross said, go borrow scoping during the wash.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:23.180]  I wanted to comment on that, too.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.180]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:28.660]  So a lot of people just say, you know, for washes, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.460]  I mean, to me, it makes sense.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:33.820]  Wash scope, wash scope, stop washing.
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:35.580]  Once the scope tells you you're done.
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:36.580]  Right. Yep.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:38.500]  OK. Seems pretty simple.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:42.340]  Yeah, man, it's it's pretty remarkable.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:46.140]  I mean, people say keep looking at it, but I don't think people talk about that enough.
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:49.740]  And, you know, and it goes back to the fresh frozen part.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:56:00.660]  You know, when you're washing and you're washing fresh frozen, you're going to end up washing a ton more times because the material is frozen and you have to loosen up the bud structure.
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:06.180]  So all the trichomes that keep getting stuck up inside the nooks and crannies get a chance to flow out of it.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:16.620]  So, you know, when oftentimes when it's not often when you're doing fresh frozen, you need to soak that weed in your water bath for a while.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:23.140]  I mean, you're talking like 30 minutes and because you want it to basically reabsorb itself into it.
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:27.820]  So for my so you want that bud structure to loosen up.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:33.900]  So if I'm already starting in a loose bud structure because it's not frozen, I don't have to wash as many times.
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.100]  And this is my opinion.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.660]  I don't have to wash as many time because there's not as many nooks and crannies for this stuff to flow through.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:48.660]  And it's falling off and dropping through to the bottom of the through the filters more quickly.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:53.660]  You know, I've not had to run more than like six times, really.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.380]  And then you just start getting diminishing returns.
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:00.580]  That's at that point in time, because you just start getting a lot more plant material.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.940]  I mean, at that point, you're beating the shit out of your weed.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:05.460]  So, you know, you're going to get a lot more plant material.
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:11.420]  You're going to get a lot more foam if you're reusing your water, which is generally what I do.
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.020]  I reuse my water through each run.
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:23.540]  And yeah, so actually the question about recycling water, I do not recycle my water I use.
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:27.300]  So if I'm running Chemdog, I'll wash everything under Chemdog.
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:35.820]  And then I'll after I get through, I'll toss that water and then I'll put a whole new with the cookies or whatever.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.140]  I'll start with a whole new run with clean water and everything.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:47.100]  I do paddle in my Bruteless, which is a big change because I used to have to push the button and the washing machine spun.
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:50.460]  And so now it's actually more work.
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:54.820]  But what I found is that you don't have to beat the shit out of it.
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:58:02.540]  I mean, you got some of these dudes, you know, you've seen them like paddling and it looks like they're trying to paddle themselves up a waterfall and shit.
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.220]  And I'm like, it just doesn't make any sense.
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.380]  And I don't beat it up like that.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:11.500]  I'm just stirring and making sure you manipulate and that the buds are rotating in the water.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:16.980]  So, you know, again, you're tossing and turn and let the trichomes fall out naturally and flow in the water.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:18.580]  You don't want to be beating it up.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:24.060]  So I found that I'm not like going crazy and like being into death.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:28.260]  It's just you do your spins and just keep going through.
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:45.100]  But also one of the things that I do is I'll actually I freeze the shit out of my hand because I'll actually go and massage the weed with my hand with a rubber glove and like massage the buds enough to sort of get things loosened out of it.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.780]  So I don't have to beat it so much.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.620]  So I'm so much more gentler, gentler way.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:59:01.100]  You know, some some hash makers, they use a big whisk, and I think that's how similarly they're doing what I do with my fingers is they'll whisk it.
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:06.540]  So it's not really it's not as much you're beating at the death and it gives the night slur.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:11.820]  I mean, I don't even know how to describe it, but, you know, that would work so it doesn't get too crazy.
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:16.420]  A little bit more vortex action, probably a little lighter on the touch.
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:18.500]  Lighter on the touch, I think, is key.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.020]  You know, I don't want to squish stuff.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:23.940]  I want to keep the buds loosened so everything just falls out of it.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:25.940]  And some buds are really tight.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:32.980]  I mean, there's been times that it's frozen and I'm having like squeeze the bud to break the bud up, knowing it's frozen.
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.300]  I'm not squishing trichomes, but I'm squishing a shit out of that bud.
[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:40.940]  And, you know, and just and then you then when you can really tell.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:46.820]  And then after the you know, that third or fourth wash, third wash, you start scoping it to really see if all the heads are off of it.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:54.140]  And generally, you know, after that third wash, if you haven't like massaged or beat the hell out of it, you're going to have trichomes still stuck on the inside.
[01:59:54.500 --> 02:00:03.820]  So that's where you either need to paddle it harder or you need to do what I do with or, you know, massage the buds enough to get all that stuff out of it.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:07.660]  OK, give me your opinion on.
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:11.540]  Dang, I don't lost my train of thought.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:15.100]  Um. So going back to.
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:18.740]  OK, here's what I was going to do that.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:33.740]  So what's what's your opinion on like drying for a day or two or three, because you know how when you harvest, sometimes your flowers are very sticky, obviously, on that first day as a trichome dry, they get a little bit more sandy.
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:40.780]  Now, can that fit into your process or, you know, pre drying is that is that something that's valid or what you think?
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:45.620]  I think it's valid when you have greasy trichomes.
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:49.140]  So if you have something that's a little bit thinner, you know, you want to dry it out.
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.820]  You want to let it harden up a little bit.
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:54.500]  So when you wash it, that you're not just breaking them all over the place.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.540]  That's the only way that I see really the value in that.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:04.820]  And that makes sense. And some people like and I understand some people like drying it.
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:08.620]  Some people like going 14 days, like full on dry and then and then washing it.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:16.540]  You know, they want to get rid of the the monoterpenes so that you're getting rid of that and getting more into sesquiterpenes.
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:19.900]  And I mean, I understand that if that's what your goal is, that's great.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:23.380]  It's just not something that I've needed.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:27.100]  And it's not I'm not looking for genetics that are like that.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:31.980]  So it's just not something that I would I feel that I want to do.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:36.060]  I mean, I'm trying to produce what the flower is when I'm smelling it.
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:38.500]  And that's what I want it to come out as.
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:42.900]  OK, you're trying to capture that that fresh bouquet essence.
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:44.540]  Boom. Putting that in that jar.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:48.540]  I got you. Yeah, because because the temple balls is my cured stuff.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:55.500]  I mean, if I want to age it, then I'll separate my trichome heads from the leaf and age it that way,
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:01.140]  which is way better because now it's in a closed environment with no oxygen.
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:07.780]  It's able to actually cure appropriately that they've been doing for thousands of years and getting that hasheen
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:11.780]  terpene, you know, in it, which is what we all love as hash.
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:19.100]  And, you know, I'm sure that the medicinal value of hasheen is significant.
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:28.220]  And thank God Frenchies and Madam Cannoli are putting that research in because that's going to show that's where the medicine is.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:31.700]  And to get to that point, you know, you need to let it cure out.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:33.300]  You're not going to get that in the rosin.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:34.580]  You're going to get it's going to be different.
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:42.300]  You know, you're going to capture those terpenes like the limine and things that would get burned out that you're not keeping limine
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.700]  after three months of doing a temple ball.
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.220]  I mean, that's all going to sort of get converted out.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:51.020]  It's going to get whatever it's going to turn into.
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:52.580]  But that stuff just goes away.
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:56.020]  But that has value in itself as as medication.
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:01.220]  And, you know, that gives you more of your up high, you know, and especially if you talk about limine.
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:05.300]  So it all depends on what you're looking for your meds to be.
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:10.580]  That's nice because just looking, thinking about the chart, Chad showed what something that jumped out at me.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:15.820]  It looked like freaking some of the THC just appeared at month three.
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:18.380]  I just looked at it briefly and I'm going to study it more.
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.540]  But it looked like there was like zero zero.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:25.100]  Then after the third month, some some different THC components jumped out.
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:28.300]  Let's see that again. It's like on that first chart.
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:29.740]  But that's amazing.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.020]  So that's telling you that the cure.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:33.500]  Yeah, this chart right here.
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:40.260]  Sample CTCV.
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:54.020]  Yeah, you know, like that jumped up from nothing to something, even even going up to CBD, a went from one point seven nine to three point two after months.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.620]  So that's well, so the THC is converting itself into THC.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:01.260]  I mean, that's what it seems to me.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:03.980]  So that is that's deep.
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:11.700]  So now just think this this research is that valuable because now you can see over time how it converts, man.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:12.940]  It's pretty it's pretty wild.
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.340]  Man, this industry is really going in the right direction.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.060]  Man, I love it.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:26.460]  I think it also shows that having an OG, having a mentor, somebody that has experience because they were the ones that were saying, no, no, you're not listening.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:29.980]  And everyone's like, no, we're blasting the shit in our backyard.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.140]  Fuck Temple balls.
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:32.340]  I know. Right.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:42.420]  We're burning, we're risking life and body for the you know, where you could just be, you know, doing that, you know, it's crazy.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.020]  Somebody had a question.
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:47.900]  I have loads of cuttlefish bones at the beach.
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:50.620]  Could I use that for liquid cow?
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:51.540]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:52.460]  That'd be pretty cool.
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:53.060]  Mm hmm.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:56.980]  Cuttlefish, WCA, WCA.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:00.900]  Yeah. And the decomposers will break that down quick.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.660]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely use that.
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.500]  And I'd send me some of the bones.
[02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.540]  Just kidding. Not really, though.
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:11.980]  Good one. Hit me on IG.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:21.220]  Oh, man. Yeah, there really is something to calcium and protein when you're kind of building up some of these systems.
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:23.420]  And again, then it comes to diversity.
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:27.900]  So once you get that aspect, like you mentioned, using diverse forms of calcium.
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:32.620]  I think that was a moment for me when I was first discovering that kind of stuff.
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:39.540]  And another reason why I started to play around with the kefir and kefir, all that is trying to find different ways to add calcium.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:44.060]  And then all of a sudden you find out that that's, again, just a fancy word for lab.
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:50.180]  You know, when you start to really break this stuff down, it's like, man, you can really grow some high end stuff.
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:51.980]  You're obviously at that level, sir.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:57.340]  And you can do it for relatively pennies on the dollar compared to like the old conventional ways.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:00.460]  And let's think about that, guys.
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:03.580]  So now he's growing his plant cheap.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.900]  He's making his product excellent.
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:11.500]  So, you know, return on investment like that shit all adds up.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:16.180]  If you only spent 50 bucks to grow it, you know, it's very little you got to take off the top.
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:22.100]  If you go into the growth store every month, spend it to 300 and now you're going to take off a lot more off the top.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:23.380]  So it's just numbers, guys.
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.300]  It's just math. And we're proving it.
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:29.340]  I mean, you can do this. I mean, that creme brulee is ridiculous.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:45.820]  I mean, it comes down. I mean, it really is that if you take the amount of money you spend on paying somebody else to grow your weed or you're getting it through your plug or something, you know that for most people, that's thousands of dollars a year.
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:48.700]  I mean, if you smoke weed, you smoke weed.
[02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:49.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:57.540]  So, I mean, you're kicking out several grand, if not like over five grand in quality cannabis every single year.
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:01.740]  So just going into this, you're not going to spend five grand.
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.700]  You're going to spend, I don't know, a thousand.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:08.660]  You're going to spend money on your light and you're going to spend money on whatever else you're going to put it in.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:10.420]  But it's not going to get five grand.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:11.500]  And you did it one time.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:13.860]  It's not five grand every single year.
[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:16.100]  A thousand bucks will get you in the game.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:21.340]  A thousand bucks will get you in the game and you're on.
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:23.460]  You're not buying any more cannabis.
[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:24.780]  Yep, exactly.
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.740]  So now all of a sudden, now you're four grand ahead.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:32.220]  And then, you know, and then it's just it just pays itself over and over and over again.
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:39.060]  I mean, I can go out and buy these stupid ass expensive lights because that's exactly what I was doing.
[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:42.260]  I mean, this is sort of self paying itself.
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.780]  It's not like I'm like putting using my credit cards and any of that.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:51.060]  I mean, I get money out of it and then I put it right back into it.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:56.660]  And it annoys me spending six grand on a stupid light and then it breaks after six months.
[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:59.740]  But, you know, shit happens and life goes on.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:00.860]  And it was my fault.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:01.820]  It was my stupidity.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.580]  So you can't be mad at anybody but myself.
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:12.020]  So but unfortunately, you know, the weed scene, you get wrapped into some of these things and, you know, listen to what Marco and Brian are
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:15.380]  saying. You guys say, I mean, it comes down to being cheap.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.660]  And that is this is the way to go.
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:21.100]  And it may not be look perfect.
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:27.300]  You may not have the best bud structure ever that you're going to see on Instagram, but you're going to get there because it's
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:34.500]  overnight. Even if you're using bottles, you're never overnight going to grow the best frickin weed without having somebody that
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:38.940]  can guide you along and tell you exactly, you know, what you should be doing to improve it.
[02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:43.260]  And so I guess go low and slow.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:50.660]  You can literally go and buy a bag of crappy dirt at Home Depot, put it in a pot and put a seed in it and you're going to grow good
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:56.380]  cannabis. So, I mean, you know, and if you think you aren't, then I am I feel bad for you.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:00.100]  You know, you can grow a little something.
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.940]  Something you grow a little bird.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:05.820]  You ain't grow no crème brûlée, boy.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.100]  No, you're not.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:13.340]  You see that question about like branding for bags and you know, do you think that that kind of stuff matters?
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:15.460]  Yeah, I'm yeah.
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.420]  Spending the money on the on the good bags.
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.180]  Is that what it was?
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.780]  I've I would be honest.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:23.220]  I have bubble man bags.
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:25.420]  I got both do bags and I got bolt bags.
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:27.100]  Those are the three ones I've used.
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:29.940]  I can tell you I like bubble mans a lot.
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:34.300]  I think bubble dudes is a rip off and I didn't like the material as much.
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:39.820]  But the bolt bags that I got, B.O.L.D.T. for Humboldt, them bitches are badass.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.780]  I mean, they are they are quality.
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:49.300]  And unfortunately, you're spending several hundred dollars to get to get, you know, those bags.
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.700]  But it's well worth it.
[02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:57.780]  And as long as you're cleaning them appropriately and, you know, it's like anything.
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:01.100]  If you take care of your tools, your tools will last a long time.
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:05.620]  And I like what you really said when it comes down to like you're not using a credit card for this stuff.
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:07.180]  It should be that way.
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:09.580]  So you should have obviously some form of income.
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:18.100]  And then if you're going to go this route or you want to scale up and just scale out time, you know, hey, I can I can put a little extra money from that.
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:28.220]  I definitely don't think when you're moving into this stuff, you should go out and just put a bunch of shit on a credit card because it's just going to cause a lot of issues.
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.220]  It's just going to cause a lot of issues.
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:38.260]  You're going to you're going to think that I just throw money at things and I'm going to solve the problems where if you really dial it in, you're thinking this through.
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:47.180]  I promise you it's going to be comical of how much money you're spending compared to when you realize what some individuals spend to grow mid mid grade cannabis.
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:51.860]  It really just comes down to your you get that it's mother nature.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:58.940]  And if you can dial in whatever environment that you personally have and everybody's environment and their personal grow at home is going to be different.
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:00.460]  That's just the way the house is.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:04.180]  How does your you know, how does your family like the heat when it's run during the day?
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:09.340]  There's too many variables to kind of set like some kind of set in stone blueprint.
[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:17.660]  But this show hopefully gives you guys the tools to to obviously not only start with where Michael Marco is showing you the Bokashi and stuff.
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:28.380]  And then we have, you know, kind of moving into the I feel like the elite tier of making the creme brulee and the consistency of that is really hard to achieve.
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:31.660]  And so I would think you are still pheno hunting.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:43.020]  But at the same time, you know, when you have your two ladies that are out there doing their thing, are you are you have you know, is most of your focus still on that and just kind of continuing to grow and have a perpetual harvest?
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:52.700]  Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm always pretty much always pheno hunting, and that's what I'm saying, I'm going through bazillions of seeds and I've settled on what I got.
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:12:00.540]  And, you know, a lot of that stuff has been disappointing, you know, but I've also gotten rid of stuff that, you know, that guy let that unicorn go.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:03.340]  I mean, I had a lemon meringue, which is exotic genetics thing.
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:08.700]  And, you know, what I thought were the keepers were great.
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.300]  But there was one I didn't even I cloned it.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.340]  And then the clone died.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:13.180]  And I was like, oh, fuck it.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.580]  That's not the one I'm going to keep anyway.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:26.900]  And after I ran everything, that lady grew the biggest, the largest, the most trichomes, gave me the most gorgeous lemon meringue smelling.
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:29.020]  I mean, it was fucking incredible.
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:33.100]  And it gave it kicked out at four percent and it was gone.
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:36.900]  And I'd grown, you know, several others and they wouldn't even come close to it.
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:42.060]  I mean, I was getting one one and a half percent, two percent, actually, of the one that I was keeping.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:46.060]  But I let the four percenter go because I wasn't testing throughout.
[02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:49.340]  And, you know, we all make we all lost those unicorns.
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.780]  And over the years.
[02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:54.980]  I almost just did it.
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:06.140]  I got some B leafy, I got some of those dipping sticks stuff, and I had two of them that I like the best, you know, but the one of the two ended up kind of
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:08.060]  it floundered a little while.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:12.220]  So the other one got bigger and I thought, yeah, that big one's going to be the one.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.980]  So I went in and took clones of both.
[02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:18.740]  But, yeah, I could have easily made that mistake, you know, at a younger age.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:21.140]  Just go ahead and say, I don't need that one.
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:26.500]  Then now it ends up being that one that was floundering at first is just the one, you know.
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:28.300]  So it happens, man.
[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:30.060]  It's like that fish story.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:31.980]  If you go fishing, it's that one that got away.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:34.700]  Yeah, I had lots to go away.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:37.460]  And right now, you know, I'm all about I'm still hunting.
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:43.340]  So what I got running now, I'm sprouting, I'm trying to sprout something is.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:14:02.380]  Orange turbo, and that is because Madam Canoli is doing something that Frenchy wanted to do for a long time, and it's basically have people around the world grow the same cultivar over through 2022.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.780]  And then press that flower to make rods and temple balls or whatever.
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:12.060]  And in February 2023 is when there'll be like a contest sort of.
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.060]  It's mostly it's not even a contest.
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:19.100]  We're just sort of explaining what our culture, what our growing style is.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:29.540]  Some people are an outdoor, indoor greenhouse, you know, and to see what styles can change or enhance or, you know, maybe they're all the damn same.
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:31.100]  And based on what we find.
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:35.060]  So there's lots of people doing it, and so it's pretty cool.
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:35.980]  So I'm going to try it now.
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.060]  So that's my next run.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:47.180]  And then I'm waiting for some other seats come from Joshua.
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:55.340]  Stanslow, no, not Stanslow, Dutch Blooms, Rutherford, Rutherford.
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Joshua Rutherford.
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:08.820]  Because I went to the region conference in Humboldt, everybody that went there getting these root beer by Chemdog Special Reserve that he did, he and Gene from Menacino did.
[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:11.100]  So I'm waiting for those seeds.
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:12.180]  I'm going to pop those two.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:18.900]  If I can get some soda flavored, you know, root beer, Chemdog stuff, you know, that.
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:21.020]  Which is well, I mean, looking at that.
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:23.420]  So, you know, that's what I'm doing now.
[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:25.700]  But, you know, I've used Bodie before.
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:32.860]  You know, I had a lavender or that I grew from Bodie, which I mean, I loved the plants were beautiful.
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.900]  They smell fantastic, but they only gave me one percent.
[02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:39.940]  So, you know, it was one of those things.
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:43.580]  I mean, you know, he puts lots of love in his crosses and everything.
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:46.900]  And I mean, and granted, I only grew the one.
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:49.260]  So, I mean, it has nothing to do with Bodie at all.
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:55.900]  It's just this particular cultivar just didn't produce what I needed to produce, even though they're spelled beautiful.
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:58.180]  I mean, I had one that was full on lavender, man.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.980]  Like I love lavender.
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:01.980]  I got a whole front yard of lavender plants.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.220]  You know, it's just freaking phenomenal.
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:07.180]  But it just didn't produce what I needed to produce.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:08.220]  So you got to move on.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:13.180]  It kind of makes sense, though, because his genetics were never really known for its yield.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:16.100]  It's more you're going out there trying to find something really unique.
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:20.340]  Yeah. And it was always the Tiffany teal bag with the gold sticker.
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:23.860]  Not everybody, especially at the expos had those genetics.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:25.860]  So when you saw it, you're like, wow, how much are those?
[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:28.780]  Yeah, I mean, that's that bag appeal.
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.460]  Great flower just doesn't press for me.
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:33.700]  That's all. But you mentioned something earlier.
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:39.540]  You know, a lot of guys now are growing for the pressers, you know, I mean, for their for the rousing.
[02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:45.780]  And so, you know, a lot of, you know, kind of older cats, we, you know, we grow for that bag, that that that flower,
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.340]  you know, and that's what a lot of people kind of grow for.
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:54.820]  So you got to figure if he you know, if you're growing kind of for that frost, you know, I mean, you're going to get more of that.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:17:01.540]  Sometimes you're just sticking more to just that loud, you know, baggy funk is what it is.
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:07.500]  So you kind of mentioned, you know, so Capulet seemed like, you know, he's taken off with the market for a little bit.
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:09.380]  Almost seems like a long time now, you know.
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:14.540]  Yeah. But he, you know, he discovered the the miracle alien cookies, the Mac.
[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:19.420]  And then kind of like, you know, was very good at branding and marketing and created it.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:27.300]  And then, you know, exotic Mike kind of did the same thing, whereas it seems like, you know, he had more of like the grease, grease monkey stuff and
[02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:31.300]  grease through it against everything and was coming out with all kinds of stuff.
[02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:38.260]  So it's interesting to see when we interview a variety of people on the show, you know, they say all these things.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.380]  There's different brands.
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:45.020]  But at the end of the day, there's that top tier sometimes really does hold true with the genetics.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:56.300]  And then most, you know, I guess on it, on the flip side, devil's advocate side, outside of the little like high end inner circle, you know, that's been around for a long time.
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:00.100]  It seems like a lot of that shit is bullshit behind the scenes.
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:07.820]  And people are quietly, you know, kind of reverting back to like, all right, I really need to dial in my genetics because I don't want to waste a year here.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:10.420]  You know, you'd mentioned that you go pretty long for your genetics.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:17.060]  So when you're talking three flips, you're actually talking a year there where, you know, some individuals might be able to get another flip or so.
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:20.540]  So, again, this is all into your environment, your genetics.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:22.380]  It's going to be your blueprint.
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:28.980]  But we just appreciate you, you know, sticky kind of letting us know behind the scenes how you're achieving some of this stuff.
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:31.300]  And it seems like you keep dialing in with less work.
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:38.260]  And from my experience, it seems like those are the elites that can just continue to push themselves and say, yes, that may work.
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:45.260]  But I found that I'm getting equal results without having to put in that much effort, like making the compost teas.
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:49.980]  You know, I guess that was an example, easy example for me to just kind of pull off the cuff there.
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.220]  But, you know, for for a long time, people were like, well, why are you putting the effort and time to do the compost?
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:55.980]  These are the extracts now.
[02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:57.300]  Why don't you do the compost?
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:19:00.220]  These I mean, yeah, it works and everything, but so do the extracts.
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:01.860]  So just do the extracts and I move on.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:07.100]  Yeah. So I would imagine that's kind of where you're at from the from the homegrown and the homegrower perspective.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:19.980]  And I appreciate you kind of showing like, well, yeah, you know, again, it's your environment where you're at, what you're doing with it, because if it's on the commercial side of things, fresh frozen is probably where you'd have to be just to make sure that nobody fucks up your work.
[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:23.620]  Because it's not just you, you know, it's teammates and stuff.
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:28.820]  So there's a it's almost like you need that extra barrier to make sure nobody gets fired.
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:37.980]  Oh, yeah. Right. I mean, it's it's you got to go through a lot of genetics and you have to have a process that you have to know what you're looking for.
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:42.820]  And I think belief is perfect when he's talked about his twenty seven hundred point system, wherever the fuck that is.
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:48.860]  I mean, it doesn't matter what it is and he's not telling everybody what it is, but we can all pretty much say what it is.
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:58.340]  Probably smell him, you know, all all the twenty seven things, you know, and I respect that because you have to put controls around these things.
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:02.500]  Otherwise, you're just pissing in the wind, dude, and you don't know what's doing what or why.
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:07.380]  And you're just like, I mean, this is a this is a process.
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:10.620]  And like what Brian said, you're talking three, four flips.
[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:13.460]  I go three flips with it's once a year.
[02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:16.140]  You're not unless you're going through thousands of seeds.
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:22.820]  It's going to take you many lifetimes to to go through and phenol hunt everything.
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:29.980]  So you have to you have to, you know, narrow your view down, narrow your criteria down to what you're really looking for.
[02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:36.900]  And if you want to grow a beautiful flower that has great bag appeal and, you know, rolls in a blunt perfect and that's what you want, well, fuck, go for it.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:52.220]  You know what I'm saying? But, you know, it's it's it's cannabis is going to be is not going to be like some flowers you put out in the front yard that, you know, a rhododendron that been going grown forever.
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:56.020]  And every time rhododendron, you're going to it's going to be the same fucking looking rhododendron.
[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:57.900]  You're never going to have that with cannabis.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:01.500]  I mean, people are trying, but I think there's still going to be enough variation.
[02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:03.380]  And that variation is what we're looking for.
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:04.380]  But you got to narrow it down.
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:16.740]  I wish there was a better way, an easier way to measure trichome sizes for us to go through this process faster.
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:27.340]  And that's why I got that resin dial, because that resin dial is going to shorten up my time frame, even though I'm going to go three runs before I make a final decision to keep it or not.
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:34.220]  Over that three runs, I went from 10, 12, 20 seeds down to one or two plants.
[02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:36.700]  You know, I'm not keeping six plants around.
[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:42.500]  You have to narrow it down because, you know, you just can't keep growing six, you know, over and over.
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:45.020]  It just or it's just sort of a waste of time.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:48.660]  And if you have limited space, it goes back to what I said earlier.
[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:53.940]  If I'm running six plants and they're kicking me only one percent, I'm wasting money.
[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:57.420]  I need to put six plants that are going to kick me five percent.
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:22:06.260]  I mean, and honestly, even if the terpenes aren't there, you want if you're making rosin, you want your percentages to work out.
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:11.580]  And having a room full of one percenters is not what you want.
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:14.740]  You need a room full of five, six percenters and you're going to make your money.
[02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:16.540]  You know, you're going to have enough to grow.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:18.860]  You're still growing for three, four months.
[02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:28.700]  I mean, if you're not hardcore and you're only doing a couple of runs a year indoor, you know, you need to make sure you're going to get enough material that you can smoke over that time frame.
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:33.260]  You know, you want to have six months worth of coming out of a crop and getting six months worth of rosin.
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:34.540]  I mean, that's what you're looking for.
[02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:39.700]  I mean, the worst thing to do is go into this and all of a sudden, you know, you love that one percent.
[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:44.820]  You smoke the shit out of that that first month and now all of a sudden you're out buying going out for another.
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:52.100]  Exactly. You were on top of the mountain for about a month on that one percent.
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:55.540]  Yeah, good points, man.
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:56.940]  It's all the numbers, guys.
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:58.420]  You know, numbers don't lie.
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:22:59.820]  It's just just numbers.
[02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:03.620]  You know, if you're not making that number, you're not making that number.
[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:06.340]  You're losing money. It's not worth it to you.
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:09.900]  So I think key genetics, I say that a lot now.
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:15.900]  Get get with those guys that are growing for the right the reasons that you want, you know, for the rise and those things.
[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.460]  I love those flowers.
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:18.860]  I love the trichome.
[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:24.620]  I just haven't got to the point where I'm comfortable, you know, and I'm the man at pressing and doing all that.
[02:23:24.620 --> 02:23:25.980]  I suck. I'm no good.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:30.380]  So I'm linking up with folks like you, Nick, and learning that shit.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:37.500]  But, you know, like that's the thing, man, is like, you know, I grow wonderful flower, cure it well.
[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:39.500]  But this thing's a different beast.
[02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:40.660]  You know, I grew one plant.
[02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:42.820]  It was a blueberry that I got from Big Worm.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:45.540]  I think I pretty much just kind of abused it.
[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:50.420]  It grew in a whole four by four, just one big old block, you know, and I just kind of let her go.
[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:57.980]  And that thing is it was a stinkiest, terpious smelling loudest, one of the loudest things I've ever grown.
[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:03.380]  And so I had been lazy with it the whole time and never really kept it up.
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:06.780]  But if flower shitload of buzz, a lot of weight to it.
[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:12.420]  So I just kind of took those kind of took it down and chopped them up a little bit, froze them up.
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:13.740]  And I was like, well, fuck it.
[02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:16.060]  I just this will be my first one I wash.
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:21.940]  And a lot of things you said, man, ring true, because I feel like this plant was very greasy.
[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:27.060]  When you look at the flowers, it very, very stinky, very loud.
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:29.620]  But the trichomes you can see there were kind of small.
[02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:31.980]  You know how you have that like light, dusty kind of.
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.860]  But you can tell they're not really big, which I'm sure is fine.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:42.140]  I know that's not necessarily an indicator, but I feel like they were to kind of bust it open because I was really smelling it.
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:44.740]  When I did my first wash, I wasn't rough.
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:46.500]  I had it in a little wash machine.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:50.140]  And then I noticed that my bags were really like sticky.
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:53.220]  And I feel like I didn't realize it at the time.
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:25:00.220]  But now after hearing what you said, I think that they had really soft heads and I think they were just kind of mashing open on me during the wash.
[02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:01.740]  And I got very little.
[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:03.380]  I mean, I got the littlest amount.
[02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:05.140]  So I got a little bit, though.
[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:13.460]  Real quickly, when you mentioned the bags and stuff, I think when that question came, you know, is it worth spending the money on quality?
[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:16.220]  That's where I think, yes, the answer comes.
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:22.940]  It should be true is because if you are in there and you're really putting in the work, those those cheaper bags rip pretty easily.
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:27.220]  And now you got a whole fucking mess, wasted time if you're ripping the bag.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:33.500]  So, again, I just say, well, you know, if it's something where you'd have to put it on a credit card, then, you know, that's the next month.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.060]  Maybe kick it down the road, you know, wherever your finance are at.
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:39.340]  But, yeah, don't don't go into debt figuring this shit out.
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:45.620]  Just realize that you got time on your hands, because I think all of us could say we've wasted a shit ton of money.
[02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:49.660]  What we were just waited probably a few months and learned a few more things.
[02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:51.700]  We wouldn't have squandered so much.
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:57.580]  Yeah. Yeah, dude, that's like that's crazy.
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:02.820]  True. It just goes to, you know, Marcos in the construction industry, man.
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:06.340]  I mean, you buy good tools and good tools last your lifetime.
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.820]  And these are tools.
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:12.300]  And it doesn't matter if it's freeze dryer or wash bucket or these bags.
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:14.340]  Basic for us is bags.
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:17.220]  Spend the money. I mean, it's not like a thousand dollars.
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:23.500]  I mean, you're spending several hundred, you know, three, four or five hundred bucks and don't get all of the micron sizes.
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:27.060]  I mean, start off with, you know, the basic five or something.
[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:29.100]  You know, you don't have to go and get eight.
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:31.180]  You know, I don't even wash through all of them.
[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:36.300]  I mean, realistically, I use I try to use the least amount of possible.
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:44.300]  You know, I use a one ninety, a one sixty, one ninety, one sixty, a ninety.
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.620]  Seventy three and forty five.
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:53.100]  And the one ninety is really just catching whatever debris that didn't get caught in the two twenty, which is going to be coming out of your
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:58.500]  your is either your wash bag or or the your work bag is going to be two twenty.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:01.380]  I like getting the one ninety because it catches that little extra bit.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:05.700]  But you know what's also in that one ninety big fucking heads and.
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:13.180]  Those big fat, juicy heads, you're not going to separate from any of the plant material, but that's the stuff that goes in your temple ball
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:15.460]  because you don't that's that's what you want.
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:23.140]  So even the one sixty and up, those are beautiful fat heads that make the best temple balls.
[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:26.420]  And those but that's not like sellable.
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:27.620]  Nobody wants that stuff.
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:33.540]  I mean, you could make it into food, but I'd rather make it into a into a fresh temple ball.
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:36.100]  Is there a market for temple balls?
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:39.140]  I mean, obviously the purist.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:40.020]  I mean, yes.
[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:42.060]  But are the regular folks that they love them?
[02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:44.300]  Are they all about that white and creme brulee?
[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:47.300]  You know, I mean, I everybody likes that white man.
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:50.860]  I mean, I think like the creme brulee and all that sugar and stuff.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:52.300]  I mean, people like that.
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:53.740]  It's all about eye candy.
[02:27:55.260 --> 02:28:03.300]  You know, it's the the temple ball is you bust that out at the party, you know, because, you know, you're you're smoking hash, you know.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:10.100]  So I mean, you're it's hash under glass or you're smoking out of a hash pipe or, you know, these are this is real hash.
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:14.900]  This is old school fucking hash that you are making with new a new technique.
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:19.140]  You know, I'm not hand rubbing fucking weed and getting on my hands and doing that.
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:29.220]  But I am taking I actually in my thing, I think this is way better than that, you know, because you're not you're literally getting what has the good stuff in it.
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.580]  The trichome heads, you're separating them.
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:32.620]  They're nice and clean.
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:34.940]  And then that's all that's going into it.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:40.980]  And I just think you can't get better than than than this type of temple ball, this type of hash each.
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:46.260]  And but I think people are going to go because some of the stuff is special tools.
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:52.380]  I mean, back in the day, you smoked, you know, brick hash under hash under glass because you couldn't figure out how to smoke the fucking thing.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:57.500]  I mean, you put it on top on a bowl on top of weed or something, but it just wasn't the same, you know.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:03.060]  And then you have like these three hold hash pipes now that Frenchie was all about.
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:08.180]  And there's several glass blowers out there that are making these things now that that's exactly what this is.
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:15.660]  I mean, you're it's it's one of those things you like put hash in it in the morning and you smoke on that bitch all day long, you know.
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:21.740]  And, you know, and, you know, every once in a while you might have a lint ball in it because you put it in your pocket.
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:35.300]  But but but I mean, you're getting you're smoking hash all day and you have that just beautiful, mellow, chill hash high that the Europeans been doing,
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:38.380]  Moroccans and Indians and everybody's been doing for a long time.
[02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:41.100]  And we're just finally getting to that point.
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:45.140]  And I think eventually, you know, no one wants to smoke flour.
[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:46.900]  I mean, cigarettes, flour.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:56.420]  I mean, I think it just ultimately once you start getting the concentrates and the rosin and the hashish, I think that's when you start realizing, you know, like, why am I smoking chlorophyll?
[02:29:57.540 --> 02:30:00.700]  Why am I smoking anything about other than what is actually I want?
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:04.820]  Yeah, that's that's that's kind of where kind of where I'm going.
[02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:13.700]  You know what I mean? I love that flour, but definitely that cleanliness over the long term, I think probably is the way to go, especially when you're on your own.
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:15.500]  You might as well take it to that next step.
[02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.740]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:20.300]  Damn, this has been great, man.
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:21.740]  What kind of questions we got?
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:23.820]  Anything pop in chat or Brian?
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:27.980]  Well, real quick, I wanted to know why you chose the orange turbo.
[02:30:28.220 --> 02:30:32.580]  Just your thought process on that, because I've never heard of it and kind of wanted to know why.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.060]  So the orange to turbo is French's favorite.
[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:40.940]  So I think it's MTG seeds is who sells it.
[02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:43.460]  But that was his favorite cultivar.
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:51.620]  So that's why that's why Kim, Madam Canoli wanted to do that, something that Frenchie always wanted to do.
[02:30:52.060 --> 02:30:54.220]  So that's why she's going to do that now.
[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:57.580]  And it seems like a lot of people are doing, you know, trying to do it.
[02:30:57.580 --> 02:30:59.940]  And that's all I want to try it and see what it looks like.
[02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:06.780]  I mean, it's a it's a I forgot who the orange came from, but it's orange crossed by a chem dog.
[02:31:06.940 --> 02:31:10.700]  And so the chem dog, obviously the sour diesel is going to.
[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:16.300]  I know that there's going to be should be some good tricone sizes coming out of it.
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:26.540]  And then if it can keep that nice orange terpenes and I can squish it without it getting greasy or something like that, that's really what we're looking for.
[02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:31.940]  I had never heard of it either until Madam Canoli picked it out there that that's what they were going to do.
[02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:36.300]  And then I looked at it and you can tell it's going to squish good.
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:37.900]  I mean, but it's a chem dog leaning.
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:38.980]  So sour diesel leaning.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:39.980]  So it should.
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:42.500]  It's nice.
[02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:48.620]  That's awesome. Again, I'm so glad that you're talking about this kind of style of hash.
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:58.820]  It's what I enjoy and that's what I'm going to make dry sit or bubble hash and then turn it into some temple balls and let it cure and do that stuff.
[02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:02.860]  Is that kind of something where you get a similar return?
[02:32:02.900 --> 02:32:15.700]  Like, is it cost effective for a company to say, OK, well, we want to shift maybe to providing this form of hash if there was a way more cost effective because you're not processing that much.
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:19.420]  I mean, once you get once you dry your loose resin, you're done.
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:23.900]  I mean, you just wrap it up and cellophane, wrap it in a ball and put it in the fridge for three months.
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:32.780]  You're done. So, I mean, to me, the way the cannabis industry is going to go, it's going to go the same route.
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:41.540]  As, you know, microbreweries, I mean, you're going to have or vineyards or anything like that.
[02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:43.460]  You're going to have everybody's going to have their terroir.
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:47.620]  You know, you're going to start having these aged products and fresh products.
[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:54.340]  You know, you have your your your whites that you got to drink within a year and then you have your expensive Chateau, whatever the hell it is.
[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:57.540]  That's going to you want twenty five, thirty years out of it.
[02:32:57.540 --> 02:33:02.900]  And people have 20, 30 year old hash balls.
[02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:05.620]  I mean, this isn't this is a real thing.
[02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:07.740]  And we're just finally catching up to it.
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:12.060]  I mean, Europe's been smoking that shit forever coming up out of Spain and Morocco.
[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:16.220]  So, I mean, we're well behind the rest of the world.
[02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:23.220]  And to think this it's new techniques, but we're trying to get to the how the old style was.
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:30.020]  And I think it's in this situation, it actually builds a little bit better than I think how the old style was.
[02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:34.020]  Yeah, and I'm still good.
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:35.660]  Hashes was always my thing, man.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:39.380]  I mean, I've always liked hash well before anybody else got hash.
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:42.940]  And I was in Europe and I loved hash.
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:44.940]  I mean, that's all I was able to find.
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:50.300]  And I was in heaven, you know, and so, you know, and people are like giving it to you.
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.580]  It wasn't even like you had to spend a lot of money.
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:54.420]  They were just like, oh, yeah, here's a grant here.
[02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:55.980]  You know, like, wait, what?
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:57.660]  It walked over there.
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:59.180]  There was no water to cross.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:02.380]  And literally you walk from fucking Morocco to Europe.
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.100]  I mean, so it got there easy.
[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:06.300]  Dude, so easy, man.
[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:09.820]  I mean, I was in Spain for a while and I met so many people.
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:12.500]  I had so much hash I had to leave it there when I flew back.
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:13.940]  I mean, I couldn't even get through it all.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:17.140]  And I couldn't believe how many how much people had.
[02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:19.700]  I mean, it's just unheard of in the States, you know?
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:26.580]  And. Yeah, yeah, I remember, remember those days, a kid, my dad being in the military
[02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:31.980]  over there in Germany, and they would be like a little needle, poke through cardboard,
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:34.140]  light it up, put a glass on top.
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.340]  Oh, yeah. OK, I see you all up there.
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:39.020]  Yeah. Smell good.
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:42.620]  How are those like dragon balls made?
[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:47.460]  Is that more of like a synthetic process, I would imagine?
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:50.100]  Do you know what's the dragon ball?
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:52.060]  I think I've seen it. But it's huge.
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:54.020]  Like, I'll pull one.
[02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.820]  I'll pull it up because they're just frickin sick.
[02:34:57.140 --> 02:34:58.900]  But yeah, I'll draw it.
[02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:02.980]  I used to know this dude when I was on this app called Doobie.
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:06.100]  I was trying to he was like, yeah, I'll show you how to do it.
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:07.700]  I'll show you how to do it. Show you how to do it.
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:10.940]  But, you know, here's the here's the picture.
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:12.900]  But he always took pictures of it with the newspaper.
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:14.260]  I was like, well, show me today's date.
[02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:15.980]  You know, you fucking put it up there.
[02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:18.900]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:20.660]  You guys can't see this yet.
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:21.460]  I'm a quick one.
[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:25.540]  Let me look at the picture here.
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:26.460]  He's laughing.
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:29.180]  Chad's about to show you is like
[02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:30.780]  kind of like an underground thing.
[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:31.780]  I think this is more.
[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:34.020]  I don't think you would ever see this in a dispensary.
[02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:35.380]  Well, this is a smuggling thing.
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:38.620]  Just imagine how much how many you hauls
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:40.900]  would you have to get the haul the same amount of weed
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:44.020]  as you get in a dragon ball?
[02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:44.660]  Awesome.
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:47.700]  What? How do you think they're doing that?
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:49.140]  It's got to be like that.
[02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:52.820]  Rosin. No, it's I don't even know how they do it.
[02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:54.260]  That's what is that real?
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:56.500]  Yes. Yes, it is real. Yes.
[02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:01.500]  My take is that is that's the HO or something.
[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:05.060]  3000 grams of pure cannabis oil per ball.
[02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:06.980]  It had to be like we did.
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:09.460]  It's not for CO2.
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:14.220]  OK, it looks I don't is it CO2 to do it?
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:17.260]  I don't know. That's why I'm too ignorant to really.
[02:36:17.300 --> 02:36:21.020]  I just know that like if you know that kind of shit.
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:22.820]  Yeah, it's just on a whole nother level.
[02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:24.500]  And I was wondering if there's any way to do that,
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:26.020]  where it'd be a pure form.
[02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:28.900]  The chest that is distal it.
[02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:31.260]  Hey, let's see. How are they made?
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:32.380]  Oh, let me click on that.
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:35.060]  He said those are glass flask with the tops hidden.
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:37.980]  So there that's the bottom of the flask that you're looking at.
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:38.900]  That's true.
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:43.940]  The chat is hilarious.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:49.820]  Extracted labs produce these massive and unique pieces in Seattle mining labs.
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:53.220]  So what do you do?
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:56.020]  Break up, break it with a hammer and get you a chunk.
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:56.820]  I mean, what is that?
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:36:57.940]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:01.580]  It's going to be it's going to be BHO or ethanol or hexane or something.
[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:04.380]  And they just have a big ball of it.
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:08.580]  I mean, I could make a 500 ball temple ball if I had that much material.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:09.780]  It ain't going to be clear.
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:10.740]  That's what I was wondering.
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:11.700]  No, it's definitely not.
[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:13.660]  These gigantic temple balls.
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:15.100]  Yeah, you're never going to get clear.
[02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:18.340]  But that's the whole I mean, that's the problem with the BHO.
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:21.580]  I mean, you're never going to get you're never going to get clear.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:24.740]  I even understand sticky as a mug right now.
[02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:27.780]  Oh, that dude should stick his mouth.
[02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:31.620]  You know, don't don't trip.
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:34.900]  I bet. And I bet like one percent of the community.
[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:35.860]  You know how to make that.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:40.620]  They still keep that like that's a highly guarded secret,
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:43.540]  or at least around here, like no one really knows how to make those.
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:48.420]  I mean, there's theories and stuff, but yeah, no, we'll all know in a few more years.
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.220]  It'll come out.
[02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:54.420]  I mean, most of that stuff, I mean, they're using hexane anyway, so I mean,
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:57.860]  it's a it's definitely should fuck up your brain.
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:01.660]  Probably, but you know, the stuff that like anything
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.740]  would ain't on the end of it is not good.
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.460]  Yeah, methane.
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:08.660]  I mean, you don't want to go on that.
[02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:11.620]  You tame anyway, if you can figure out how to make like a solvent
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:17.380]  dragon ball sticky, you are like, you know, you'd be crumbling and dragon balls, dude.
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:18.860]  No doubt, man.
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:21.340]  That'd be sweet.
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:23.700]  I mean, I guess I mean,
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:27.940]  you aren't going to make a temple ball, but I can make rosin
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:31.780]  that would be formed into a ball fresh press.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:35.260]  I can make fresh press look like that and it would be hard
[02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:38.620]  and it wouldn't melt because that's how fresh press is.
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:39.900]  You put it in the freezer.
[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:43.060]  It has a harder consistency when you pull it out because it hasn't buttered up yet.
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:48.140]  So there is no doubt in my mind you can make fresh press into a big ass ball.
[02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:49.500]  And that's it's clear.
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:54.540]  I mean, if you're pulling early, if you're at that 68, eight, nine weeks,
[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:56.180]  you can make it clear.
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:39:00.420]  But as you see with mine, it gets more orangey when you get in that 77 weeks
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:02.140]  because you have more amber heads.
[02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:05.820]  So there's going to be some some.
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:08.740]  It may be a little bit more opaque,
[02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:11.620]  but there are definitely the consistencies that you can see
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:13.420]  through some of that stuff.
[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:14.860]  I like it.
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:16.940]  Well, if you want to go through the challenge, man,
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:18.980]  I'd love to have you come back on the show and show it.
[02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:21.500]  Makes me dragon balls, man.
[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:24.340]  Yeah. So is there a point of
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:28.180]  temple balls being too big, like where, you know,
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:31.180]  hot on the outside, icy cold in the middle?
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:33.300]  I'd actually say no.
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:36.660]  I think I'd say a bigger ball is better because it has less surface area.
[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:39.500]  So if you can pack more into the center
[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:43.740]  and then you only have less surface area, you're that's actually a better situation
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:47.620]  because it's preventing the oxidation of the cannabinoids inside.
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:50.900]  OK, and that's like your book you saw when they cut them in half.
[02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:53.860]  It was dark on the outside and it's all nice and creamy on the inside.
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:57.580]  That's exactly because it oxidized on the outside
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:00.060]  and there were a lot more terpenes on the outside.
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:02.540]  So the terpenes are aging and it's going to darken in color.
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:05.580]  So that's why that outside stays so dark.
[02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:10.180]  Nice. So really, you're when you want to when you consume a temple ball,
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:13.540]  I think I want to like kind of break it open, get a little bit out the middle
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:14.700]  and then kind of close it back.
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:17.460]  That's kind of the way I would imagine best way to do it,
[02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:22.700]  because if the oxidizer is on the outside, you kind of say you at last, I guess.
[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:25.260]  That makes perfect sense to me.
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:27.780]  I don't I don't ever do it that way.
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:29.860]  I just grab off this grab off.
[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:33.260]  Like, yeah, I'll take a scoop off and then like squish it back into a circle
[02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:36.340]  and put it in cellophane again and then put it in the fridge, you know.
[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:40.740]  I love hanging out with guys like sticky, though, like when you're
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:44.060]  when you're at like a larger event, because they'll just throw you like a glob.
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:45.420]  You know, they're not.
[02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:47.340]  You know, they're doing it all themselves.
[02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:50.260]  It'll kind of, you know, and I hope this is with respect,
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:53.780]  but you don't kind of value it the same way as somebody that's buying at retail.
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:56.780]  You know, you're giving as everybody was, like, especially when
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:59.100]  back in the day when you had a flower, like people be like,
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:03.180]  you know, almost kind of a Paul that you would dust off some of the the weed
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:05.380]  on your lap when you're at a party or whatever, you know,
[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:08.100]  you put that back in the jar.
[02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:08.900]  Fuck it, dude.
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:11.420]  You know, so that's what I could see you doing.
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:15.140]  But it's just kind of like putting everybody's, you know,
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:19.700]  their little banger to hardcore use by filling it up.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:24.020]  Yeah, that's exactly once you start growing your own weed, dude, all of a sudden
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:28.380]  it has weed has it has a different definition to you.
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:31.860]  And then when you go to the world, I mean, the commercial facilities
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:36.580]  that make Rosin and stuff like seven, ten labs or something, the amount of waste
[02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:39.380]  there is is frickin incredible, man.
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:44.740]  Like, you know, and I waste stuff, you know, if I get like a tool
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:49.020]  and it gets sticky as I'm like stirring stuff or pressing things down, you know,
[02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:52.980]  I get to the point sometimes that I'm like, there could be a glob on it.
[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:55.900]  And if I can't scrape it off, I'm just taking alcohol and cleaning it.
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:58.860]  And I'm like, that was like five fucking dabs, you know,
[02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:03.780]  like if you spent that money and you're spending 50, 60,
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:08.620]  80, 100 dollars for a gram of Rosin, dude, every fucking speck
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:10.140]  is you're going to want to smoke.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:13.700]  But when you're not in your you're producing a bunch,
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:17.820]  even with just a few plants, I mean, you're going to produce a lot.
[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:20.060]  And that goes a long way.
[02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:22.060]  And you just get a little bit more careless over time.
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:26.460]  Yeah, you become a little Johnny Appleseed spreading it around the party
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:29.020]  and everybody's like, dude, he's getting everybody ripped over here.
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:31.380]  Fucking stickies here at the party again.
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:35.340]  Oh, man. Guys putting super globs in everybody's dish.
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:38.180]  You know, when he entered the building, you know,
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:41.620]  funny man. Good shit.
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:44.100]  Yeah. Yeah, man. It's good stuff.
[02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:47.340]  Thank you. Definitely, man.
[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:48.740]  Hey, this is great, man.
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:52.820]  I'm glad you you came on and and I know you gave the community
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:56.300]  a bunch of different stuff, man, because I was hitting the gold bars.
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:57.900]  And this is definitely one man.
[02:42:57.900 --> 02:43:01.500]  This is this goes to show like, guys, it's not about the followers
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:04.340]  or who how popular you are that we used to say.
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:06.620]  A good dog is where you find them.
[02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:09.540]  OK, a good strain is where you find it.
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.500]  It don't matter the name or where it came.
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:15.060]  If you find Mac or if you find whatever that is, then you found it.
[02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:18.820]  So you go to show that man, a good people are where where you find them.
[02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:22.780]  You're a good person. Appreciate you sharing the techniques.
[02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:24.580]  I think that kind of stuff is invaluable.
[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.380]  You know what I mean?
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:29.460]  Hopefully you save a lot of people a lot of time and something dumb I did.
[02:43:29.860 --> 02:43:34.020]  So when I did finally get this little bit to drip out of my press, right,
[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:36.420]  I get it on my little stick.
[02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:39.420]  Then I decide to touch it.
[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:44.340]  So now you wouldn't believe how sticky a little fucking pea
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:45.940]  sized dab or something is, man.
[02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:48.140]  I look like I mean, I had shit all over the place.
[02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:51.460]  I ended up just fucking say a pocket, wiping on my hands clean
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:53.700]  and end up losing a little bit I had anyway.
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:57.660]  So listen, learning is key, guys.
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:00.940]  It's save some time by learning from people to know how to do it.
[02:44:00.980 --> 02:44:01.740]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:06.220]  So so I mean, like like the the chem dog,
[02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:09.460]  the fresh press that I gave you, Marco.
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:10.900]  Yeah, I have it.
[02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:12.260]  So I mean, I haven't known that.
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:13.820]  I mean, that's just my old school genetic.
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:15.500]  You know, it smells like old school and everything.
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:21.340]  But that was a five gram fresh frozen that I did in November.
[02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:24.660]  So I'd probably say fresh rose is like maybe three months in the freezer.
[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:25.780]  I think beyond that, maybe.
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:29.420]  So yours is older than three months, but it was still perfect.
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:32.860]  I mean, I busted several grams off of it to give people
[02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:34.820]  all my little trip down when I saw you.
[02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:37.380]  Yes. And it was just easy, you know.
[02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:40.900]  So it's already hard when you put it in the freezer, you bust it out
[02:44:41.700 --> 02:44:43.780]  because it maintains that hard consistency.
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:48.100]  You can warm it up in your hands a little bit to to form it back into what it.
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:52.100]  And you make shapes, you make hearts and stars and all the other things
[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.900]  that people are putting out there and shit.
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:58.220]  Yeah. And then you just put it in a nice little pretty jar and then it works out.
[02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:00.660]  But yeah, very nice.
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:04.100]  Yeah. And I've been using it very sparingly because it is so nice.
[02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:05.100]  And I kind of want it.
[02:45:05.100 --> 02:45:07.340]  I like to you know, I like to always keep me a little soft.
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:09.340]  I got a little some of his dick.
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:11.380]  I'm that kind of guy.
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:12.500]  I got that collection.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:15.220]  So yeah, so it's it's good stuff.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.620]  And yeah, man, nice.
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:23.060]  I can talk about bugs or, you know, and all kind of stuff, too.
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:25.820]  Well, open it up to questions.
[02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:27.660]  Yeah. And then if not, we can get into that.
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:32.340]  You're muted, Chad.
[02:45:33.260 --> 02:45:35.460]  They that's my one time of the show.
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:36.780]  Thanks, brother.
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:38.500]  Yeah, you've got it.
[02:45:38.500 --> 02:45:41.460]  They getting we've been getting to the questions, which has been nice.
[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:44.940]  And it's been great that I've just kind of been able to throw them up live as we go.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:50.060]  But yeah, everybody in chat, this is your chance to get some questions in.
[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:54.500]  So definitely do that as we continue to kind of talk and wrap it up.
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:57.180]  I'll keep my eye open for that.
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:59.460]  But yeah, sorry, Operation Annihilation.
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:02.980]  So real quick, then fresh back to that sticky.
[02:46:03.380 --> 02:46:08.660]  So what you want to run over kind of like your IPM protocols and that kind of stuff.
[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:11.060]  Actually, I probably don't want to because I think they suck.
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:16.020]  But now it's a protecting plants for 20 years.
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:17.500]  Man, oh, my God.
[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.100]  I'm doing something right.
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:21.380]  Well, you know, for the most of the IPM stuff.
[02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:27.660]  I honestly trying to keep a clean room and keeping the stuff out of it is going to get
[02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:31.940]  and watching when you're going out, you know, I never go work in my front yard
[02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:34.580]  and then come down and go in my room ever.
[02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:38.820]  You know, I honestly I'll take a shower before I go in there.
[02:46:38.820 --> 02:46:41.860]  You got to keep you don't want to be bringing bugs, even just coming in,
[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:44.980]  parking your car and walking inside, you can grab something and bring down.
[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:49.940]  And but one of the things I did for a while was actually using
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:52.900]  cocoa, coconut water,
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:57.860]  because it creates like a a it's good for the plants,
[02:46:57.860 --> 02:47:02.100]  but it has a stickiness to it that most lots of bugs didn't like screwing around
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:06.980]  with it, and I would spray that on during during the veg and up in the three weeks
[02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:11.140]  up into flower, and that did always a good, good job, you know, always kept the mites away.
[02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:13.660]  There was only one time that I really had
[02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:17.620]  mites, two spotted mites.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:21.820]  And, you know, you're able to use a like a soap or a.
[02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:23.860]  So, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:26.740]  And they just suffocate so quickly, they're really easy to get rid of.
[02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:30.460]  The things that I've struggled with over the last several years were thrips, man.
[02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:32.420]  And the thrip I brought the thrip in.
[02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:35.340]  I know he hitched ride on me and then it just blew up.
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:41.460]  Yeah, the mites actually I had a jasmine plant in a window upstairs
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:44.620]  and that mites love jasmine.
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:48.620]  And they came in the window, hit the jasmine plant and it blew up.
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:53.540]  And they came in the window, hit the jasmine plant, and they quickly found my
[02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:59.980]  cannabis. So but the thrips I brought in and honestly, dude, I'm still this is four
[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:02.900]  years in and I'm still dealing with fucking thrips, dude.
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:07.780]  And I've changed my entire system out just three cycles to go.
[02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:11.780]  And that was one of the reasons why I got rid of my 12 cycle.
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:14.020]  Hey, let me I'll be right back.
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.140]  We're in a second. OK, sorry.
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:18.660]  One day. You had to get a package.
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:21.940]  Yeah, so we'll toss him back in and it's actually good.
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:23.820]  I see your questions are coming in.
[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:26.700]  So when he gets back, we'll get the questions to him.
[02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:33.220]  But I want to ask him that if he uses any like good bugs to fight those thrips.
[02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:36.020]  So what's he what does he tried in those four years?
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:37.700]  So we'll have to get on that.
[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:41.300]  Yeah. Yeah. And when he's talking, Mike, he's saying it's easy to get rid of the
[02:48:41.700 --> 02:48:44.020]  he's saying spider might say it.
[02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:47.460]  So there's definitely a difference between a spider mite and a russet mite.
[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:51.140]  So don't think if you have russet mites, that you're going to easily solve that
[02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:55.220]  problem. And that is a I don't I wouldn't wish that on any girl, really.
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:58.660]  It's just a nightmare, especially if you're trying to feed your family with that
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:03.500]  stuff. So that's why it's extremely important to be proactive with this and identify
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:08.940]  things that could potentially potentially kill the entire operation.
[02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:14.140]  And from what I've seen, man, Russets are really the only one this day and age.
[02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:19.020]  If you if you understand, I can that still can throw a curveball even to like a
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:21.860]  veteran farmer.
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:24.100]  Peter, that is not getting it.
[02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:27.300]  Yeah. So what he's mentioned, prevent preventive.
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:30.980]  I mean, so how you been fighting those grips, man?
[02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:34.940]  So, dude, the thrips are a bane of my existence, dude.
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:40.500]  I the main reason why I switched out all that 12 cycles is because I couldn't get rid
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:43.900]  of thrips. I mean, I've sprayed every I've done everything possible.
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:49.980]  If you can known to mankind and even by I mean, regularly buying kookamarus and my new
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:53.380]  pirate bugs and all that stuff, I just couldn't get rid of them.
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:57.900]  Changed my whole room out, changed all the soil, changed everything, sprayed the room
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:03.900]  down a million times with hypochloric acid and bleach and everything else and
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:06.220]  fucking dude, they came right back.
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:09.980]  Like it's almost like they lived somewhere in my house.
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:14.980]  And I did it in the wintertime to know there was not one fucking thrip outside.
[02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:18.500]  Right. And sure and shit, dude, I still got them.
[02:50:18.580 --> 02:50:21.780]  And I struggle with it, honestly.
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:28.500]  I mean, they don't ruin my plants, but it's about, you know, I, you know, just trying
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:31.620]  to manage with kookamarus and my new pirate bugs and
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:36.660]  I'm missing one of them.
[02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:37.700]  I don't know what I'm trying to think.
[02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:42.900]  Oh, straddle, a lopsa, simitis, the one that Brian loves saying.
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:46.900]  Yeah, if I could pronounce it like you do, I know what I say.
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:48.020]  Hypo is miles.
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:51.140]  Yeah, dude, you know what? I just love saying straddle a lops, man.
[02:50:53.660 --> 02:50:57.780]  So but simitis simitis is how you say it.
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:59.540]  But I love them fucking things.
[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:03.220]  They're awesome. And so I just use those.
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:07.420]  And, you know, they keep things down, but they just never do enough.
[02:51:07.420 --> 02:51:15.500]  And as I see Rotten Skateboard says about Suzanne, the bug lady, she she was actually
[02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:20.940]  out in Humboldt in January with me and she pretty much said.
[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:27.060]  Live with the thrips, as long as you put your kookamarus out and shit, it's it's not
[02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.740]  even worth it, because what happens is their cycle so fast that you spray them with
[02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.860]  something and then the babies are immune to whatever the hell you sprayed them with.
[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:38.580]  I mean, even if you're putting real chemicals on them and they get immune.
[02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:41.340]  So the thing so quickly, you can't ever fix it.
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:45.700]  And I honestly, dude, I'm just dumbfounded.
[02:51:45.700 --> 02:51:47.900]  I'm just sort of managing over time.
[02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:49.660]  I mean, they don't mess anything up.
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:52.540]  You know, it's not like I got bazillions of them hanging out.
[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:57.260]  It's just like there's always some around and you can see it on the leads as they're
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:52:01.500]  doing what they're what they're doing, but to not be able to find something that eats
[02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:07.940]  them all the time. And as much as I love buying beneficial bugs, the beneficials aren't
[02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:09.900]  trying to eat all those bugs.
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:14.820]  The reason is because they need them to keep growing so they keep getting fed so they can
[02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:20.060]  have babies. So to annihilate their food source is the last thing that they want to do.
[02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:25.620]  So as great as all that is, it's really just managing.
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:28.740]  They're just managing the populations.
[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:33.060]  I mean, to the point that I just had so many fucking rove beetles.
[02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:39.340]  They ate all my kookamaris and I had such a bloom of rove beetles, dude.
[02:52:39.380 --> 02:52:42.060]  I mean, they were flying all over my house.
[02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:43.860]  I mean, they were everywhere.
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:48.100]  Like I go into the shower in the morning and they'd be like a hundred of them, like
[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:49.980]  hanging out, drinking the water.
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:52.380]  Like they were just so many.
[02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:53.780]  And you can't really get rid of them.
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:55.460]  I guess I get like a bearded dragon or something.
[02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:59.460]  Maybe I'd get rid of them. But they had all that food to eat.
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.380]  They were so much food.
[02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:03.420]  It's finally actually dwindling.
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:11.940]  But even after throwing 200,000 kookamaris, this is this is an 18 square feet, 200,000
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:18.300]  kookamaris and a thousand minute ladybugs.
[02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:23.220]  And we talking hundreds of thousands of beneficials in a one little room.
[02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:25.180]  I can't fucking get rid of the thrips.
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:30.860]  You're like, yeah, you had a party up in there.
[02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:32.780]  That was a hell of a party going on.
[02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:34.180]  Crazy. Yeah.
[02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:38.580]  That's crazy that you did all that and threw out all your old soil.
[02:53:38.580 --> 02:53:40.380]  And then they said, hey, we're still here.
[02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:41.500]  Still here.
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:43.780]  That's when I was like, I almost like gave up.
[02:53:43.820 --> 02:53:46.100]  I don't even know what I don't even know what to do anymore.
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:47.540]  Now I saved all the soil.
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:51.020]  I piled it up in the backyard and threw some straw over top of it.
[02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:57.340]  So it's got some so it's still good to go and we'll use it.
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:01.420]  But it's a it's just some of this stuff you're just not going to get rid of.
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:03.900]  Mites are fairly easy unless you get the rust.
[02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:05.660]  They're a little more challenging.
[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:13.780]  But mites, honestly, if somebody said it to spotted mite is in my my garden, I know I
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:15.940]  can kill that bitch in a few weeks.
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:17.300]  They not even think about it.
[02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:21.340]  And before I was like sweating bullets and going, oh, my God, the world's going to end.
[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:22.620]  And it just didn't.
[02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:27.060]  But the thrips are just nagging, just nagging.
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.660]  And yeah, dude, I got to move.
[02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:31.220]  They don't move with you.
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:35.340]  They're like, have you tried buying the praying mantis sex?
[02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:37.020]  I do, man.
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:38.140]  I got a bunch of pictures.
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:41.740]  I got I made some videos of my when they when they burst out.
[02:54:41.740 --> 02:54:44.500]  They can't they can't get a hold of all the thrips right there.
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:49.620]  Dude, they weren't they weren't they were eating rose beetle hoagies all day long, but
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.860]  they I never saw one hit a threat.
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:57.820]  I almost think the thrips I even would put them next to the thrips and they were never
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:01.820]  quick enough. It's like the thrips just like bing and they like bounce somewhere or fly
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:02.980]  or whatever the hell they're doing.
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:05.060]  And it just never really gave them a chance.
[02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:11.820]  And they're just too small compared to even a three quarter inch size praying mantis.
[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:15.820]  So. But praying mantis are cool, man, I love them.
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:22.700]  Yeah, there you go. See, that's what either thrift you would think, you know, that's about
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:25.220]  bite size for those motherfuckers are ninjas, too.
[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.980]  They're usually pretty on point with it.
[02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:30.340]  They're on my rose for sure, man.
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:31.620]  They like roe beetle.
[02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:36.100]  So how are you getting your roe beetles to breed like that because you had the rips?
[02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:38.020]  I mean, is that so that's the secret.
[02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:39.300]  You got to get thrips to get.
[02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:41.220]  And I hope not.
[02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:44.860]  So I get the bloom when I put the kookamaris in.
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:50.660]  They and the strata laelops cimitis, they they go after.
[02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:59.540]  The kookamaris, so everybody gets fed from from the kookamaris feed and from the kookamaris
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:01.260]  are small enough that they're eating.
[02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:05.940]  I don't I never really saw him ever catch an adult thrift, but they certainly eat shit
[02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:09.140]  out of the instar, the smaller babies and stuff.
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:17.700]  And it's just I don't even know, but it would be ridiculous to put kookamaris, spend
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:22.620]  that money on kookamaris to breed the roe beetles, depending on how much money you're
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:27.540]  getting. But I every time I put two hundred thousand of them joints in there, man, if
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:28.780]  they just blow up.
[02:56:29.220 --> 02:56:32.300]  And I mean, like the I have my foes.
[02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:35.340]  It has some sun sunrise and sunset.
[02:56:35.700 --> 02:56:41.060]  And at an hour before I have it sun setting, an hour before the lights go out and as soon
[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:48.420]  as. The moment that that goes down a little bit, that first minute you start seeing the
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:54.020]  roe beetles getting all excited and over the next 15 minutes, they'll start flying and
[02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:56.980]  then they because they're like, oh, the day's over with.
[02:56:57.220 --> 02:56:59.500]  I'm getting ready. I'm going to go fly to another spot.
[02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:01.580]  So in the morning I'm going to start eating some good stuff.
[02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:06.820]  And do they start hovering and by like the last 30 minutes of the day, dude, I got roe
[02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:08.500]  beetles flying all over the damn place.
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:15.860]  And so but I think because of the moisture, the moisture level and the kookamaris and
[02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:18.460]  then as now what's happening is they're dwindling down.
[02:57:18.460 --> 02:57:22.060]  So they're not producing as much because the kookamaris are all gone at this point.
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:27.540]  And they're just nibbling on whatever whatever they eat otherwise.
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:31.740]  I mean, I've heard they eat like fungus and other bacteria and other food scrap things
[02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:33.420]  and whatever is going on with that.
[02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:37.300]  They're eating those and they're eating the springtails.
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:39.060]  Yeah, that's what I try to feed them.
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:43.420]  And that's what just happened with me recently is that I had this big bloom off the
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:48.220]  kookamaris and then which was honestly the biggest bloom I've ever had.
[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:52.420]  And do they destroyed all my.
[02:57:52.740 --> 02:57:55.660]  Um. Whatever I just said.
[02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:01.260]  That damn it, what are you using to feed them the springtails?
[02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:05.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude, it all springtails like I don't I don't even have a springtail
[02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:07.580]  that my in my ground anymore in the soil.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:09.780]  Like and I used to have bazillions of them.
[02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:11.140]  You got to get that balance.
[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:11.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:13.860]  That's right. Yeah, I got to get him back.
[02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:18.540]  I got a two hundred thousand roe beetles downstairs that I'm releasing like after the
[02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:20.660]  show. So I'm excited to try to get them going.
[02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:24.140]  I'm going to tell you how to get them going, man, is that wheat bran.
[02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:26.300]  They love that wheat bran.
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:32.420]  Man, I started using that wheat bran and they just because that increased my spring
[02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:34.460]  tails and in the rows increase.
[02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:38.060]  So now like I just got rows all over my soil, walking on the surface.
[02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:42.980]  Now it's nice. And the bar earlier from Marco to get the like calcium.
[02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:46.580]  They're like I call my little calcium mines now where you get the oyster shell flowers.
[02:58:46.940 --> 02:58:52.060]  I continue to when I pick that up as things are progressing week by week, the springtails
[02:58:52.060 --> 02:58:53.980]  are all over that calcium source now.
[02:58:53.980 --> 02:58:57.660]  So that's just another way that you can take it knock, knock, knock into a new thing and
[02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:58.820]  put it right back in there.
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:03.020]  You could come if it gets healthy enough, you come back in just a few hours and continue
[02:59:03.020 --> 02:59:06.900]  to do that. So again, just always giving credit where credit's due.
[02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:12.540]  But there's something to using a calcium source to really build up your decomposing
[02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:14.700]  soil. What was that again?
[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:19.140]  What specifically what product or oyster shell flower or oyster shells?
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:22.140]  Now I'm thinking flower.
[02:59:22.140 --> 02:59:25.900]  Now that you said that, have you tried to sprinkle in the flower that already have that
[02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:30.340]  kind of I am using that, but specifically to try to get the springtails to breed and
[02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:33.020]  then so I could inoculate because I was a show.
[02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:35.980]  It's hard to get, obviously, a bunch of them to clump together.
[02:59:36.460 --> 02:59:37.660]  So how do we achieve that?
[02:59:37.660 --> 02:59:42.460]  And before it would take forever to get really old, like really flimsy bark.
[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:46.820]  Once you got like some old bark to that, then they would come to that other than that, it
[02:59:46.820 --> 02:59:50.300]  was really hard to get that other than some food sources sometimes.
[02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:54.700]  But then you almost take too many, I feel like, because there is a balance.
[02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:58.820]  Like if you take it and take too many, then so for you guys out there, if you really want
[02:59:58.820 --> 03:00:04.540]  to get into a living soil system, springtails are something that is a game changer.
[03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:09.500]  It's like once you understand the composting worms, then you move to the springtails.
[03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:13.060]  And then again, of course, moving just the progression and understanding where things
[03:00:13.060 --> 03:00:18.340]  are, that's where you're really going to kind of spend a little money up front and then
[03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:24.060]  get days, hours, just time back to your life and lifestyle because they manage
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:26.820]  everything, especially the compost worms, if you've ever tried them.
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:27.640]  Yeah.
[03:00:29.420 --> 03:00:31.020]  Yeah, I love my springtails, man.
[03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:36.900]  I mean, at one point just in the last year, I had these orange ones where they're orange
[03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:40.820]  with white stripes and they were like twice or three times the size of a normal
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:43.100]  springtail and they were gorgeous, man.
[03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:45.780]  But they hunted stuff too.
[03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:49.980]  You could tell the way it was because it would get up in the canopy and the way it
[03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:54.020]  would move around a leaf was like a ladybug, like going along the edges and stuff.
[03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:56.700]  And it was searching for something more.
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:01:01.300]  But Cinch Angel is when I sent it to him, he's the one that told me it looked like it
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.060]  was a springtail, some type of springtail.
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:08.180]  So I didn't know springtails would hunt other stuff, but apparently larger ones do.
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:12.100]  I've never seen them up in the canopies, but I have seen some larger ones.
[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:14.140]  They do come in some pretty big sizes too.
[03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:16.320]  Yeah.
[03:01:17.020 --> 03:01:20.140]  And always look at the overall health of your plants.
[03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:22.940]  Like when they, you know, they can't obviously take over.
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:28.140]  If everything's in balance, you just almost kind of forget what your plants looked like
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:30.220]  before you started adding all of this life to it.
[03:01:30.220 --> 03:01:32.340]  And it's like, oh yeah, there's hardly any deficiencies.
[03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:37.980]  You know, barely really doing anything at that point other than monitoring the system.
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:39.300]  You know, they don't rely on you.
[03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:43.980]  Like, you know, going back to when we started the show, like when you start out with a
[03:01:43.980 --> 03:01:48.100]  bottle of nutrients, that's why in fairness, there's also a love for the plants.
[03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:52.020]  And that's how a lot of us started and week by week and stuff is because they are so
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:53.020]  dependent on you.
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:56.580]  You know, if you go away for a weekend, chaos would ensue.
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:59.260]  And that's why it was always called like a golden handcuffs.
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:00.780]  Now it was.
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:04.820]  Yeah, man. And then your girlfriend, you know, she's yelling at you.
[03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:06.180]  It's like chaos.
[03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:10.900]  And then you'd ask a homie, Oh man, I forgot to go over there.
[03:02:10.900 --> 03:02:14.180]  Sorry. Oh man, you should have reminded me.
[03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:15.540]  It's like I was on vacation.
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:16.080]  Damn.
[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:21.260]  Dude, I go on vacation and I throw a camera up in that joint so I can actually when I'm
[03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:23.420]  on vacay, I can still see what's going on.
[03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:24.380]  Just watch.
[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:25.820]  Things have changed dramatically.
[03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:29.220]  Like you can be not only a living soil nerd, but like a technology nerd.
[03:02:29.220 --> 03:02:32.740]  And I would imagine you could you could take that to the next next level.
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:34.980]  You know, oh wait, a degree went off.
[03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:36.100]  Hold on. You're at dinner.
[03:02:36.140 --> 03:02:36.780]  Hold on, babe.
[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:37.900]  Exactly.
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:38.580]  Everything.
[03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:44.340]  Yeah, the technology makes it great, man.
[03:02:44.340 --> 03:02:47.100]  And honestly, it's one of those things you go away in a week, especially in the old
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:50.340]  days when I was more worried about something catching on fire.
[03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:53.700]  It's like, you know, I'm not home.
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:57.540]  So it doesn't really matter if the house catches on fire, but at least I can call 9-1-1
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:02:59.060]  from wherever I'm at.
[03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:00.500]  Exactly.
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:01.660]  Before I got too crazy.
[03:03:02.220 --> 03:03:06.340]  Yeah. Back then you would have been the fire trucks and the police waiting on your ass
[03:03:06.340 --> 03:03:07.340]  when you got back.
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:08.940]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[03:03:09.140 --> 03:03:13.180]  That's true. And if you use those things, that gives them probable cause to come into
[03:03:13.180 --> 03:03:15.700]  your house. So just remember that stuff.
[03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:18.380]  We always would. I don't know.
[03:03:18.380 --> 03:03:22.460]  I guess I guess it's OK to say, but it's also better at night to maybe just steal a sign
[03:03:22.460 --> 03:03:26.780]  from somebody and then pop that shit in your front yard and bluff the community if you're
[03:03:26.780 --> 03:03:29.420]  willing to to grow weed where you're not allowed to.
[03:03:29.780 --> 03:03:32.060]  I wouldn't sign up for those services.
[03:03:32.500 --> 03:03:35.100]  You might shoot yourself in the foot because the cops will come.
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:41.060]  You know, if the fire if the fire department sees that, they will 100 percent call the
[03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:42.060]  police for that.
[03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:46.700]  Sure. I've had more problems with police than I have good time.
[03:03:46.700 --> 03:03:48.660]  So I don't know if I'm the only one.
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:53.420]  We I always say like if they're protecting my mother or something, a fantastic.
[03:03:53.940 --> 03:03:56.260]  But other than that, I try to handle everything.
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:57.860]  And I'm the police over here.
[03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:01.500]  All right, good stuff, y'all.
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:03.500]  Damn, this is rolling. This is one man.
[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:05.340]  Look at that. We could talk all night, man.
[03:04:05.380 --> 03:04:10.380]  But all night. Yeah, you got you guys have surpassed the three hour mark.
[03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:13.300]  I didn't want to just like the proceedings.
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:15.700]  But well, can you keep us on the clock?
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:17.380]  Can we let us off the clock?
[03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:21.140]  So, hey, we should give a shout out to him, too, for stepping up and because he
[03:04:22.540 --> 03:04:26.340]  like he's he has the same skill level as Chad with the IT stuff.
[03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:28.980]  So appreciate you can fill it in.
[03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:32.940]  And we, you know, you know, now he's got his own show, obviously, and everything.
[03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:34.300]  So tune in on Mondays.
[03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:36.740]  You know, I love how the community just keeps growing.
[03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:41.100]  You know, you put time and effort into something, you know, then the grandpa sees that
[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:42.140]  it has value.
[03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:45.340]  Put you on. So, Ken, it's well-deserved, buddy.
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:47.100]  And it's it's all about the biology.
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:51.780]  Sure. It's it's fun hearing the conversation expanded, you know.
[03:04:52.980 --> 03:04:57.260]  Brian, I just want to ask you, I want to ask you about your arthropods and stuff or
[03:04:57.260 --> 03:05:00.140]  isopods. I mean, what I need.
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:03.900]  I know you've talked about like I think the zebras or the pandas.
[03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:05.260]  I don't remember. You got so many, dude.
[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:10.820]  But I need something for my grow a shredder that's not going to turn into these
[03:05:10.980 --> 03:05:14.500]  the gray ones that I squish all the time that I can't stand.
[03:05:14.780 --> 03:05:16.700]  So those are the baloney ones, man.
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:17.980]  That's why I exist.
[03:05:18.260 --> 03:05:20.220]  Can't be growing with baloney sandwiches.
[03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:23.020]  So that's what I'm saying. So what do I need to get that's not going to go?
[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:26.860]  I don't want anything overly crazy, but I need something to manage.
[03:05:27.180 --> 03:05:28.540]  You know, like I got that one little.
[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:34.060]  Rove beetle, that's like three quarters long.
[03:05:34.100 --> 03:05:36.860]  I got him in some compost at some point time.
[03:05:36.860 --> 03:05:38.900]  He's over a year old, man, I can't believe it.
[03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:43.620]  And so just getting something that's not going to be overbearing, but still continue
[03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:48.860]  and not one of your you know, I love the duckies, but they're 170 for.
[03:05:49.900 --> 03:05:53.140]  Well, all of that stuff is based on how long it takes to breed.
[03:05:53.180 --> 03:05:54.820]  So that is key, right?
[03:05:54.820 --> 03:05:59.860]  Because those gray ones, you know, would breed like the rubber duckies.
[03:06:00.180 --> 03:06:02.700]  You know, I'd be an extremely wealthy man.
[03:06:03.220 --> 03:06:05.500]  But unfortunately, that doesn't work like that.
[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:08.860]  Anything in life, you know, it takes a long time to be able to get things that are
[03:06:08.860 --> 03:06:12.140]  truly unique. The rubber duckies are obviously at the
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:17.300]  the furthest end of that spectrum, kind of what created the whole designer isopod
[03:06:17.300 --> 03:06:21.900]  craze. What you're after is more of just kind of like a return on investment isopod.
[03:06:22.460 --> 03:06:24.580]  And again, that would come down more to your environment.
[03:06:24.620 --> 03:06:28.980]  So a lot of these things like like the zebras, that's what I first started off with.
[03:06:28.980 --> 03:06:33.500]  That's kind of where this idea even came for me, is that I would take a few photos
[03:06:33.500 --> 03:06:35.340]  with them and then people be like, what the hell is that?
[03:06:36.100 --> 03:06:37.940]  You know, the zebra isopods come from France.
[03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:41.540]  So there's there's isopods from all over the world that you can get into.
[03:06:42.220 --> 03:06:46.140]  I would even say if you're into like Instagrams, there's this thing called the Shiro
[03:06:47.020 --> 03:06:52.140]  that look pretty cool, man, and relatively cheap for how quickly they
[03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:56.420]  produce, but not at the same level of the the bologna sandwich isopods.
[03:06:56.700 --> 03:06:59.140]  So again, it comes down to more what you're trying to achieve.
[03:06:59.140 --> 03:07:03.100]  But some of us like the prettiness, like the panicking's, they're obviously going to
[03:07:03.100 --> 03:07:07.500]  break things down, but not the same level of something that's known as the dairy cow.
[03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:13.300]  Yeah. Dairy cow is what we use to feed like the reptiles because they breed so quickly.
[03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:17.060]  I wouldn't use that in my cannabis grow.
[03:07:17.260 --> 03:07:22.220]  You know, that would be something that I would I would use, you know, building
[03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:27.740]  up a like a worm system that the dairy cows would be fantastic for that.
[03:07:27.740 --> 03:07:30.540]  So there's a there's a lot of variables to that.
[03:07:31.180 --> 03:07:35.300]  But again, it'd be more like, do you want to look at the zebras or the, you know,
[03:07:35.300 --> 03:07:39.420]  orange calicos? They kind of all do at that level the same thing.
[03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:43.580]  So it's more of this, you know, what color do you want your car to look like when it's
[03:07:43.580 --> 03:07:44.740]  like running around? You know?
[03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:46.580]  Well, I'm all about that color.
[03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:48.260]  And that's why I love that one rove beetle.
[03:07:48.260 --> 03:07:50.940]  And he's big with nice red patch on his back.
[03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:52.060]  And actually I had two.
[03:07:52.300 --> 03:07:54.340]  So I don't know if I still have two, but one.
[03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:58.580]  And then but yeah, dude, they're just awesome.
[03:07:58.580 --> 03:08:04.740]  I mean, I like I I want to keep all kinds of little bugs in my in my soil.
[03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:07.980]  And that, you know, they're all you look down, all of a sudden something else is
[03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:11.660]  poking up or, you know, a worm is like poking his little head up or something.
[03:08:11.660 --> 03:08:14.420]  You know what I'm saying? Like all that stuff is cool shit to me.
[03:08:14.420 --> 03:08:15.620]  I mean, I got to be.
[03:08:15.980 --> 03:08:17.500]  Yeah, I mean, I'll sit there and stare.
[03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:21.540]  I guarantee I spend 90 percent of my time staring at my soil and 10 percent looking
[03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:21.980]  at the weed.
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:22.780]  Dude, boom.
[03:08:24.380 --> 03:08:24.820]  The weeds.
[03:08:24.820 --> 03:08:26.620]  That's why you create what you're creating.
[03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:31.060]  I mean, you get where it's actually magic is obviously in the rhizosphere.
[03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:33.540]  That's just a fancy word for it.
[03:08:33.540 --> 03:08:35.300]  I put everything's breaking down.
[03:08:35.380 --> 03:08:38.540]  I got these reading glasses like old people.
[03:08:38.980 --> 03:08:40.860]  That's the rubber ducky guy, by the way.
[03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:41.220]  Oh, yeah.
[03:08:41.220 --> 03:08:44.740]  No, it doesn't look like one, but he's the one that I guess blessed.
[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:47.180]  And Chad, you saw that in Amsterdam, right?
[03:08:48.220 --> 03:08:54.740]  Yeah, that was in a natural museum, amongst many other stuffed once living animals.
[03:08:55.260 --> 03:08:58.180]  But that was blown up for demonstration purposes.
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:09:01.580]  But that was there are ones in the ocean that live that are huge.
[03:09:01.660 --> 03:09:03.340]  Yeah. Three, four feet.
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:07.380]  Yeah. You can go to like high end places in Las Vegas and like a table of six dues.
[03:09:07.380 --> 03:09:10.180]  And you can eat a pod from the ocean.
[03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:14.260]  I know that it's a definitely an ex.
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:17.220]  I must stick to that crab right now.
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:18.860]  I don't go to Wagyu, man.
[03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:20.700]  If you're in Vegas, it's white.
[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:21.860]  Don't let them fool you.
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:23.060]  Real Wagyu beef.
[03:09:23.060 --> 03:09:24.580]  If you're paying for it, that shit is white.
[03:09:24.780 --> 03:09:25.700]  All right. All fat.
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:26.500]  Is it good?
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:31.860]  Talk about talk about a high end microbial.
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:33.780]  I bet your microbes devour that in seconds.
[03:09:34.220 --> 03:09:34.780]  Oh, yeah.
[03:09:36.980 --> 03:09:39.940]  Well, not not a whole bunch of house cleaning today.
[03:09:40.340 --> 03:09:42.300]  I know we've got a full schedule.
[03:09:42.300 --> 03:09:45.300]  I'm going to be jumping back into the swing of things here in a couple of weeks.
[03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:47.540]  Get a lot of shows planned for everybody.
[03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:50.340]  But what do we got going on tomorrow morning, Brian?
[03:09:51.220 --> 03:09:54.340]  Yeah, we're chopping up with Layton's tried and true.
[03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:57.620]  You know, he speaks on certain individuals a lot.
[03:09:58.380 --> 03:10:03.540]  And the individual individual, I would imagine, as well as a small team.
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:06.860]  I can't wait to interview, but I don't know enough about
[03:10:06.860 --> 03:10:09.700]  if it's just one person or a small team, but it's called Fish Brew.
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:13.380]  So we're going to obviously be talking about more of like the aquatic
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:14.500]  microbial world.
[03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:17.780]  And, you know, when Layton kind of chops it up with products,
[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:20.940]  I know the community tries it and they have a lot of success with it.
[03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:24.300]  So, you know, this is somebody that he's talked about
[03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:25.980]  since I've been doing the show with them.
[03:10:25.980 --> 03:10:28.620]  And as far as I know, they're just buddies.
[03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:31.220]  And he just thinks that they do really well.
[03:10:31.380 --> 03:10:35.660]  I use I've been using Fish Brew, and I think it's definitely has helped
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:39.660]  over with my new soil to actually move it a little bit faster
[03:10:39.660 --> 03:10:41.180]  than I was I was hoping for.
[03:10:41.180 --> 03:10:46.060]  So it's definitely I see the results and I'll probably just keep using it.
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:49.780]  This is it's it's adding something that I wasn't getting before.
[03:10:50.100 --> 03:10:53.700]  And I don't have like a big compost pile and just like loading compost or anything.
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:54.700]  I'm not that fortunate.
[03:10:55.700 --> 03:10:59.820]  So this has given me a wide swath of of
[03:11:00.980 --> 03:11:04.460]  my biology that I just wouldn't have got otherwise.
[03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.900]  And it's it's definitely noticeable.
[03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:10.260]  And it's definitely improving things fast.
[03:11:10.580 --> 03:11:12.500]  So I'm all about it.
[03:11:14.220 --> 03:11:17.020]  Oh, boom. There you have an actual testimonial.
[03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:18.860]  And that's really what people like.
[03:11:18.860 --> 03:11:20.980]  You know, you have you actually tried the product?
[03:11:20.980 --> 03:11:21.820]  No, yes.
[03:11:22.220 --> 03:11:25.540]  And getting to go to the source to, you know, the people that are making it
[03:11:25.540 --> 03:11:28.340]  or, you know, the people that are representing it, that's invaluable
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:32.060]  because chat, everybody, if you're watching, you're going to be able
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:34.860]  to ask your questions and get them directly to the person.
[03:11:34.860 --> 03:11:38.740]  There's you know, that's an awesome thing about this channel and these shows.
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:42.220]  And, you know, like Sticky's probably not going to tell us how to make the creme
[03:11:42.220 --> 03:11:47.940]  velée, but he's given us some good advice on the road to that path.
[03:11:47.980 --> 03:11:50.420]  So I appreciate your time today, Sticky.
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:52.460]  Oh, no, dude.
[03:11:52.460 --> 03:11:54.260]  I honestly, dude, I am grateful, man.
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:11:55.500]  Thanks for so much for having me.
[03:11:55.500 --> 03:11:56.820]  And, you know, I'm
[03:11:58.420 --> 03:12:00.940]  talking three hours about weed is a beautiful thing, man.
[03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:02.620]  I wish I could do this all the time with you guys.
[03:12:02.620 --> 03:12:05.700]  And but I'm really grateful for the opportunity
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:08.980]  and appreciate you guys having value with what I was saying.
[03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:11.900]  So thank you so much.
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:15.660]  No problem. And I'll put your I'll put your Instagram up one more time.
[03:12:16.700 --> 03:12:19.340]  Let everybody hit you up there, follow you
[03:12:19.580 --> 03:12:21.900]  and try to learn a little bit.
[03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:25.020]  You got some great pictures up there.
[03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:28.340]  Brian, Marco, you know, I always like to give you guys a little chance
[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:31.020]  to give any shout outs or what you got coming up.
[03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:34.180]  So let's let's get that going before we wrap it up today.
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:36.340]  All right, man. Just want to say thank you.
[03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:37.940]  Sticky, appreciate you, man.
[03:12:37.940 --> 03:12:40.060]  We're going to keep talking, do what we do.
[03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:42.540]  And definitely, man, we'll get you back on here again.
[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:44.300]  I think you got a lot more to offer.
[03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:46.220]  You know, you're kind of one of those guys.
[03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:48.340]  I feel like we just kind of scratched the surface.
[03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:53.100]  He's I could tell you're very smart, you know, and not only in cannabis,
[03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:56.180]  but in life, you know, so I can tell you a lot to offer.
[03:12:56.180 --> 03:12:59.980]  And just thank you for dropping what you dropped on us today, man.
[03:13:00.180 --> 03:13:01.820]  Much appreciated.
[03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:06.580]  Yeah, I think, Sticky, you know, especially when these things flow like that,
[03:13:06.580 --> 03:13:08.420]  you know, everybody everybody's in the zone.
[03:13:08.420 --> 03:13:11.940]  And I know that the the viewing community, especially the replay
[03:13:11.940 --> 03:13:15.100]  viewing community, really appreciates that because it's not all these tangents
[03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:17.780]  and kind of stuff that sometimes we go into.
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:19.220]  They're good and bad, you know.
[03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:22.460]  But again, it's I just like the you know, these conversations
[03:13:22.460 --> 03:13:24.820]  with Chad and Marco are off the cuff.
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:26.380]  It's hard to fake it.
[03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:28.340]  You got to come over here and know your stuff.
[03:13:28.340 --> 03:13:30.060]  And you obviously know what you're doing.
[03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:32.860]  Like Marco had mentioned, the proof is in the end product.
[03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:34.580]  We all believe in that.
[03:13:34.580 --> 03:13:37.700]  So starting from base points, understanding IMO's,
[03:13:37.700 --> 03:13:40.700]  Bokashi's and that kind of thing, and then taking it to the next level
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:43.420]  and creating that crumb relay that everybody's after.
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:45.780]  But very, very few individuals are able to achieve.
[03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:48.860]  So hats off to you for speaking with us today.
[03:13:49.980 --> 03:13:52.500]  Again, it was very touching for everybody that reached out to me.
[03:13:53.100 --> 03:13:56.700]  You know, having a daughter is obviously one of the once in a lifetime thing.
[03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:58.460]  So again, I just thank everybody.
[03:13:58.460 --> 03:14:00.420]  I still have to get in the DMZ.
[03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:04.140]  So I was hoping I could, you know, let you guys know that I super appreciate it.
[03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:06.300]  And I hope to be able to catch up with all of that stuff.
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:09.460]  But I hope that you see to the, you know.
[03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:11.580]  Maybe change.
[03:14:11.580 --> 03:14:13.260]  I know I personally changed my ways.
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:16.420]  My wife changed her ways to be able to achieve that.
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:19.820]  And I know that a lot of individuals want to be able to grow cannabis
[03:14:19.820 --> 03:14:21.860]  to kind of change their stars, their own outcome.
[03:14:22.460 --> 03:14:25.860]  And I hope that you guys see that a lot of the people that come on our show,
[03:14:26.420 --> 03:14:30.260]  Sticky, Marco, Chad, a lot of you guys are going to be able to find ways
[03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:32.900]  to be able to take care of yourself by just doing what you love.
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:35.140]  And Peter is a prime example of that.
[03:14:35.140 --> 03:14:38.420]  You know, Peter's been doing and had this platform way before COVID
[03:14:38.420 --> 03:14:41.420]  and everybody kind of just everybody had their own podcast.
[03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:43.700]  So Peter's an OG for a reason.
[03:14:43.980 --> 03:14:47.980]  He obviously understand things way before anybody else did.
[03:14:47.980 --> 03:14:51.260]  So he's I know he's inching close to 70,000 subscribers.
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:54.940]  So I just wanted to give him again where credit give credit where credit is due.
[03:14:55.460 --> 03:14:58.860]  Thank you, Peter, for allowing this thing to become what it is.
[03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:03.500]  100 percent, and everybody, thanks for following in here.
[03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:07.780]  Time after time, you got two minutes until the 420 on the West Coast,
[03:15:07.780 --> 03:15:08.980]  if that's important to you.
[03:15:09.580 --> 03:15:12.420]  But yeah, thank you for joining us today.
[03:15:12.420 --> 03:15:13.820]  And that was very well said, Brian.
[03:15:13.820 --> 03:15:15.460]  Again, congratulations.
[03:15:15.460 --> 03:15:17.860]  I sense a daddy's little girl in the future.
[03:15:18.940 --> 03:15:20.700]  Lots of pink, lots of frozen.
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:24.020]  I'm sure you'll you'll be into it.
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:27.460]  But until next time, everybody, thank you again for hanging out.
[03:15:27.780 --> 03:15:29.860]  We will catch you later.
[03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:30.660]  I'll wrap it up.
