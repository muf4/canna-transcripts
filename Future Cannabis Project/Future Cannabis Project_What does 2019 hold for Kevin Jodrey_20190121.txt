[00:10.360 --> 00:20.360]  You've been around for a minute and you've seen so much go on. We were just talking about how things have changed at the Emerald Cup with the segue from 2015 to 64.
[00:20.360 --> 00:26.360]  Where do you see it in a year? What do you see happening this next year? What are you focused on there?
[00:26.360 --> 00:37.360]  For me, I'd say the primary focus is just to be able to understand how to make the transition from what we did to what we're doing because there's no map.
[00:37.360 --> 00:45.360]  It's a new industry that you're creating so nobody really has a book to buy that says this is the steps you take.
[00:45.360 --> 00:52.360]  If you watch even these large companies make missteps, you realize that it's just a tricky thing.
[00:52.360 --> 01:00.360]  A lot of it is to make sure that you emotionally keep yourself stable so that you can make the transitions and allow the businesses that you're able to develop
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.360]  and the pathways through this new maze are able to be presented so you can see them.
[01:07.360 --> 01:14.360]  That's the main point is to stay on focus with that. That's the reality of the new industry.
[01:15.360 --> 01:23.360]  At the same time, I'm getting to do incredible projects because we're able to work with scientific technology that we never had access to before.
[01:23.360 --> 01:27.360]  You're able to work with people from the new industry coming in.
[01:27.360 --> 01:33.360]  Everybody's all the green rushes, right? A lot of the green rushes are green rushes, but a lot of the green rushes are actually pretty good people.
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.360]  They're intelligent and they have a desire to be in a new industry.
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.360]  They realize their position because they've been in other industries and they see that this is a different one.
[01:45.360 --> 01:49.360]  They're not trying to necessarily model this one after the other one so much.
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.360]  They know that this will be its own organic development because it's a unique industry.
[01:53.360 --> 02:05.360]  All of a sudden, you get to really have intelligent data acquisition and genomic scientists and high-level plant consultants that work on really intricate, large projects
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.360]  that help you understand some of the nuances people face at these scales and at these issues.
[02:09.360 --> 02:17.360]  With the regulations, as strict as it is, you're bringing in incredible levels of organic methodologies.
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.360]  It's a resurrection of how does one work without chemical ag.
[02:21.360 --> 02:30.360]  At the same time, on the other page, it's how do you use the most modern technology to lift the production values and get the margins into a tighter range.
[02:31.360 --> 02:33.360]  It's fascinating in that respect.
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.360]  For all of us that were in the industry all these years, we always wanted to have the tools to use, but you couldn't.
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.360]  Now you can. Now that you can, it kind of scares the shit out of you because you see that they're there.
[02:42.360 --> 02:46.360]  I'm excited about that, man. I'm digging it.
[02:46.360 --> 02:57.360]  I like that hemp is going to move across the board because it'll open up agricultural methodologies throughout the country for biomass, for fiber, for hemp seed oil.
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.360]  They'll transfer it to cannabinoids. It'll go back in California under the BCC.
[03:02.360 --> 03:11.360]  This way, it allows the farmers that are growing cannabis and cannabinoids to be able to focus on a multi-use crop, not just all THC-driven, but THC, CBD.
[03:11.360 --> 03:15.360]  Then as we go forward, CBGs, THCVs, CBNs.
[03:15.360 --> 03:25.360]  It'll allow a much greater diversity for the cultivator, so you're not all trying to stick OG cushion gelato into a jar and sell it at the store.
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.360]  You're able to go at populations that want some very interesting things because it works for their situation.
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.360]  All of a sudden, now you have a much larger population of total potential customers and clients.
[03:36.360 --> 03:40.360]  It isn't like it's going to compress. It's going to explode. I'm digging it.
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.360]  I heard you're working on a bit of a skunk work. I mean, literally, skunk work project.
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  Trying to get some land race.
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.360]  I'm bringing back all the old genetics because we partnered up with the lab, Node Labs out of Petaluma.
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.360]  Node Labs is our tissue culture facility where we're going to do all our tissue culture production.
[03:55.360 --> 03:59.360]  Then we'll move it into the new wonderland and develop it there to grow out.
[03:59.360 --> 04:08.360]  What it does, it lets us have this ability to use modern tech, but I'm using the modern tech to go and open up old seeds from the 70s.
[04:08.360 --> 04:17.360]  From populations that were held by people who held them because they really liked it and they just didn't want to get rid of the seeds, but they also knew they couldn't do anything with them.
[04:17.360 --> 04:25.360]  Well, we can go into them now and preserve some of them and pull some of that genealogical material out and use it to steer the directions different.
[04:25.360 --> 04:31.360]  Those building blocks, we really shifted away from them and now they're not present.
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.360]  The thing is that there's all this incredible, beautiful material to be delved into.
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.360]  The ability to do that stuff is unreal, man.
[04:39.360 --> 04:49.360]  I can go back to my roots, which is a simple guy just wanted to smoke the grass, and then I can go all the way to the top of the tree, which is we're touching some really high science.
[04:49.360 --> 04:53.360]  It's an unbelievable time to be able to do it.
[04:53.360 --> 05:02.360]  You're terrified most of the time that these companies are going to gobble you alive, but at the same time, they need to deal with you to be able to figure out what to do.
[05:03.360 --> 05:06.360]  You really have a very unique moment in time.
[05:06.360 --> 05:20.360]  I wish I had been in tech and saw the dot-com in person because I bet it was similar where in the same room you had all these people just for one period of time before they all fragmented out into their respective specialties.
[05:20.360 --> 05:26.360]  That's my background. I don't even know if I share it, but years ago, it was post-dot-bomb, as we say.
[05:26.360 --> 05:29.360]  It was more of the early 2000s I got into it, but you're spot on.
[05:29.360 --> 05:33.360]  I felt that I was very fortunate to be a part of something that was such an evolution.
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.360]  Now, I think this one's a more important evolution, truth be told.
[05:37.360 --> 05:42.360]  I'm an advocate from a medicinal side. Definitely respect the adult use side, but I agree with you.
[05:42.360 --> 05:51.360]  It is very similar. You had these people that were just these think tanks that they didn't even realize it was so much bigger than even anyone could understand or comprehend at the time.
[05:51.360 --> 05:52.360]  Again, that's what I love about it.
[05:52.360 --> 05:56.360]  We've had conversations about that, you and I both, where I'm the same way.
[05:56.360 --> 06:03.360]  To see a true Acapulco gold or Northern Lights, not crossbred, not backbred.
[06:03.360 --> 06:08.360]  I love we talked about this too. These trendy cakes. I know cakes are hot now.
[06:08.360 --> 06:14.360]  We had cakes, we had cookies, we had the OGs. We went through these hazes, all these phases over the years.
[06:15.360 --> 06:24.360]  You get into it, and this is something that no matter what big company comes into the scene, you're the one who has the keys to this castle that can tell them,
[06:24.360 --> 06:27.360]  this is why the genetics went this direction.
[06:27.360 --> 06:35.360]  This is why everything started shifting to less pungent or to a little more restrained on the terpene side, a little less flavonoid.
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.360]  You know that. You were there when they brought everything indoors post-air back in the early 80s.
[06:41.360 --> 06:45.360]  Looking back, are you just not ever amazed? Do you ever just stop and go,
[06:45.360 --> 06:50.360]  my God, this really just happened in not just your lifetime, but just in the last 20 or 30 years?
[06:52.360 --> 06:57.360]  It's the last couple years that blew my mind because that was the change of pace that was fastest.
[06:57.360 --> 07:00.360]  It was really pretty stable for a long time.
[07:00.360 --> 07:06.360]  You had a stability that was built in from regulation, meaning legal enforcement.
[07:06.360 --> 07:12.360]  That gave a price stabilization, which allowed people to be able to have resources to be able to operate independently.
[07:12.360 --> 07:15.360]  Then when that got shut out, it compressed the industry.
[07:15.360 --> 07:19.360]  Now the new influx of capital and new people coming in is re-blowing it up.
[07:19.360 --> 07:30.360]  It's just trying to figure out how do you get some of these things from the past, genetically speaking, culturally speaking, and have them transcend and move forward through time.
[07:31.360 --> 07:39.360]  It's just so strange to be watching it in real time because we knew this was coming and we prepared for it and we worked with it,
[07:39.360 --> 07:42.360]  but no one ever knows the future in real time.
[07:42.360 --> 07:45.360]  You have no idea what's next.
[07:45.360 --> 07:52.360]  Now we're talking about synthetically growing terpenoids in yeast solution and growing cannabinoids in yeast solutions.
[07:52.360 --> 07:58.360]  We're manufacturing stuff that we need specifically in lab for very specific purposes.
[07:58.360 --> 08:09.360]  The genomic projects, we can start getting stabilized lines going through and developing plant populations that have high resistance so that cultivation is easier in a lot of areas.
[08:09.360 --> 08:17.360]  Going at specific combinations of cannabinoids and terps for medicinal purposes because now you can get medicinal research.
[08:17.360 --> 08:22.360]  Expungement on cases, people that got caught a case getting expungements.
[08:22.360 --> 08:26.360]  You're an East Coast guy, born East Coast.
[08:26.360 --> 08:30.360]  I was floored when I was hearing that a place like Mass was tornado.
[08:30.360 --> 08:31.360]  Blowing up.
[08:31.360 --> 08:34.360]  I'm like, even the Canadians are like, this makes sense, right?
[08:34.360 --> 08:35.360]  Yeah, the Canadians are going off.
[08:35.360 --> 08:36.360]  Yeah.
[08:36.360 --> 08:45.360]  I could see that because they've said, hey, this is an excellent opportunity for us to enter an industry before the US gets involved because once the US gets involved heavily, it's going to be hard to compete.
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.360]  It's tough to beat better climate with ag.
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.360]  Mexico is killing us with agricultural products.
[08:53.360 --> 09:02.360]  They have the water, the flat ground, good soil, and they also have a looser labor and environmental controls.
[09:02.360 --> 09:05.360]  It allows them to be more competitive in those things.
[09:06.360 --> 09:14.360]  Canada, to me, is the front runner right now, but I don't see the ability to hold that position with ag.
[09:14.360 --> 09:22.360]  Technical, breeding, very specific, but not on a broad production once these other countries can start producing.
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.360]  I agree.
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.360]  They're in a situation that's different.
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.360]  The East Coast, which has been traditionally draconian, so New England's draconian on cannabis.
[09:32.360 --> 09:34.360]  They're bracing it, two fang and claw.
[09:34.360 --> 09:37.360]  I'm looking at it, I'm like, whoa.
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.360]  I remember catching a case in 83, and I said, I think I'm good.
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.360]  I'm out of there when I graduated school in 84.
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.360]  I never had a desire to go back and do cannabis in New England.
[09:47.360 --> 09:50.360]  Now, right now, it's exploding.
[09:50.360 --> 09:57.360]  It's just so strange for me to see it because that's something I can mark in a reality because it was my reality.
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.360]  I was there as a New Englander, and I knew what it was like then.
[10:00.360 --> 10:05.360]  Now, it's just as gobbled up as can be, and you're like, whoa.
[10:05.360 --> 10:07.360]  Utah.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.360]  You got Utah.
[10:08.360 --> 10:11.360]  I got to tell you, I think you were down there, too.
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.360]  We had a couple of volunteers from a Utah can that came by our booth down in San Jose, NCAA.
[10:17.360 --> 10:19.360]  These guys were like, we're from Utah.
[10:19.360 --> 10:21.360]  We're thinking about putting together a show.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.360]  I'm like, I'm in.
[10:22.360 --> 10:23.360]  I'm with you.
[10:23.360 --> 10:29.360]  I really thought if someone asked me to force rank the 50 states, honestly, I thought Utah and Texas would be last.
[10:29.360 --> 10:30.360]  Texas even has a CBD program.
[10:30.360 --> 10:31.360]  A lot of people don't know.
[10:31.360 --> 10:33.360]  They have a few dispensaries nobody knows about.
[10:33.360 --> 10:34.360]  They keep it under wraps.
[10:34.360 --> 10:35.360]  It's a very major red state.
[10:35.360 --> 10:37.360]  But Utah, I was so impressed.
[10:37.360 --> 10:38.360]  They know they went for it.
[10:38.360 --> 10:39.360]  Yeah.
[10:39.360 --> 10:48.360]  And it just shows an incredible awareness to the homeopathic medicinal properties that cannabis can be derived from, provide to.
[10:48.360 --> 10:57.360]  And so all of a sudden, you have this radical paradigm shift of the value of the product, not just financially, but actually as a product.
[10:57.360 --> 11:00.360]  And now they're saying, hey, we can work with opiate addiction.
[11:00.360 --> 11:03.360]  We can work with all the seizures.
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.360]  You have the new EPA approved or the FDA approved of dialects.
[11:07.360 --> 11:10.360]  So it may be $37,000 for a year's treatment.
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.360]  But the point is that it has been accepted at a level that nothing else has.
[11:15.360 --> 11:24.360]  And it begins the belief in the acceptance so that you can start to really figure out how to use this varietal or this family of varietals.
[11:24.360 --> 11:26.360]  And people finally get some benefit they need.
[11:26.360 --> 11:28.360]  And the stigma is not on them.
[11:28.360 --> 11:30.360]  They don't have to be ashamed.
[11:30.360 --> 11:32.360]  Their children find relief from products.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.360]  They have to go illegally get in other states.
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.360]  And they risk.
[11:35.360 --> 11:36.360]  No, they don't have to.
[11:36.360 --> 11:37.360]  I'm like, it's crazy.
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.360]  I'm digging it, man.
[11:38.360 --> 11:44.360]  For any beating I'm taking in business over the last couple of years where we always felt like we were getting pounded out making the transition.
[11:44.360 --> 11:45.360]  Definitely.
[11:45.360 --> 11:47.360]  Where every time you were shifting, you were like, whoa.
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.360]  And then the cost of building your own world was really, really high.
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.360]  And people say that's a naivete that we didn't understand it.
[11:53.360 --> 12:00.360]  But it's that nobody understood it because the regulations changed so frequently that you're having to modify, modify, modify.
[12:00.360 --> 12:03.360]  It was just an incredibly expensive process.
[12:03.360 --> 12:06.360]  So for anybody that got involved in cannabis, they bled money.
[12:06.360 --> 12:07.360]  So we all have the same thing.
[12:07.360 --> 12:09.360]  Investors coming in, I'm bleeding.
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.360]  Growers, I'm bleeding.
[12:10.360 --> 12:12.360]  That's what it is when you build.
[12:12.360 --> 12:13.360]  It's a real world.
[12:13.360 --> 12:15.360]  I don't think people understand how tough things have been.
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.360]  Maybe it's all business as usual in the triangle.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.360]  But it's not.
[12:19.360 --> 12:38.360]  I'll take the beating for the benefits of the general population where if the general population can use cannabis to alleviate issues that they really could benefit from and it allows them to have a better quality of life, then what do you really put a value on that?
[12:39.360 --> 12:50.360]  And so the thing is that for us in cannabis, we just have to accept that there was a huge trade, that we traded a lot of our personal freedoms for a greater good.
[12:50.360 --> 12:58.360]  And they say large companies are taking the money, but regular people are benefiting in a way they couldn't prior because access wasn't allowed.
[12:58.360 --> 13:01.360]  And it was like, well, just move to California.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.360]  It's not that simple, man.
[13:02.360 --> 13:04.360]  You can't just pick up and move when you're poor.
[13:04.360 --> 13:05.360]  Especially not to a state like California.
[13:05.360 --> 13:06.360]  No, it's expensive.
[13:06.360 --> 13:07.360]  You can't do it.
[13:07.360 --> 13:08.360]  It's just not possible.
[13:08.360 --> 13:10.360]  You have to be a transient and then it's just a nightmare.
[13:10.360 --> 13:19.360]  And so finally, you get individuals that have the ability to easily access stuff, readily available, tested, no more predatory products.
[13:19.360 --> 13:20.360]  It's huge.
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.360]  Yeah, it's huge.
