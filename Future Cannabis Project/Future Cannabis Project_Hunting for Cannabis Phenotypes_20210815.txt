[00:00.700 --> 00:08.860]  Thanks for waiting everyone. As I said before, James was driving home as fast as the pedal
[00:08.860 --> 00:14.220]  could be put to the metal. So here we go. Hey, what's up everybody. Thanks for tuning
[00:14.220 --> 00:19.060]  in this week. We don't have a special guest. I'm just going to be talking about pheno hunting
[00:19.060 --> 00:26.320]  this week and selecting seeds and winners from your seed packs, how you do it. And so
[00:26.320 --> 00:30.880]  it's going to be a short and sweet episode. We got the Frenchie Memorial at 1130. So we're
[00:30.880 --> 00:36.280]  going to be talking for about 20 minutes. If you guys have questions, get them in, but
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.680]  you know, we're just going to go over the basics. And I think the most important thing
[00:39.680 --> 00:45.980]  is before you start trying to pheno hunt is learn how to grow. I think that's the most
[00:45.980 --> 00:50.080]  important thing is learning how to cultivate. You know, I've said it time and time again,
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.960]  but pheno hunting is something that you learn how to do over time. You know, there's a
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.920]  lot of little things that I can tell you how to do, but the biggest thing is learn how
[01:01.920 --> 01:06.160]  to cultivate, learn how to grow so that you can make your plants express properly. You
[01:06.160 --> 01:12.040]  know, you might find winners that are real standout, even if you're a new grower. I think
[01:12.040 --> 01:16.920]  it's best to grow from clones in the beginning, but if you're not that fortunate to have access
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.020]  to clones, seeds are seeds are a good option. But yeah, let's, let's start with that and
[01:22.020 --> 01:27.900]  build on that. So step one is learn how to cultivate. I think that is one of the biggest
[01:27.900 --> 01:32.680]  things, learn how to grow, master your medium, grow the same thing over and over and over.
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.080]  And each time you grow it, you're going to improve. If you try to grow in the very beginning,
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.720]  when you start out, if you try to grow one strain, this time, the different strain, the
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.760]  next time a different variety, the next time, if you keep on doing different varieties,
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.760]  it's a lot harder to see the progress that you're making. And I think part of that is
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.640]  also a grown one cultivar in the beginning and then switching to a different is a problem.
[01:56.640 --> 02:03.220]  But with that concept, if you stick with the same nutrients and your same, like basically
[02:03.220 --> 02:07.160]  your same food regimen, your same lights, if you do change certain things, just change
[02:07.160 --> 02:13.560]  a couple of them. So that's in the beginning, that's for the very new guys. Now, once you
[02:13.560 --> 02:19.760]  learn to make your plants express, you know, I think there's a lot to be said for quality
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.720]  of genetics, who's making the genetics, what the genetics are, how much diversity, the
[02:25.720 --> 02:33.320]  more diversity, the more you're going to have to go through seeds to find good stuff. So
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.000]  yeah, I think there's all kinds of cool stuff in the chat going on. But yeah, it's, you
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.800]  know, we got someone who says, I don't think I will ever breed, you know, I think you can
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.520]  make it as a goal. Some people want to breed and they don't even want to grow weed. They
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.480]  just want to make seeds. And I think it's all part of the journey. You got to remember
[02:51.480 --> 02:57.680]  like this is a whole lifetime experience thing. It's not all about that quick buck. It should
[02:57.680 --> 03:03.560]  be about passion. Whatever you do in life. I enjoy cooking too. I think cooking is amazing.
[03:03.560 --> 03:09.440]  I enjoy cooking. I don't ever want to go back to being a chef really. But you know, I enjoy
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.360]  cooking from time to time. I cooked last night. So my pictures are on my Instagram.
[03:13.360 --> 03:21.160]  But going back to pheno hunting, you can find anywhere from, you know, one keeper to zero
[03:21.160 --> 03:27.840]  keepers, sometimes, sometimes 10 keepers in a 10 pack of feminized seeds. You know, and
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.880]  typically with feminized, you're going to get all females, you should, I mean, 20 years
[03:31.880 --> 03:38.600]  ago, if you got nine females in one that hermed or was male, you're doing good. Now you should
[03:38.600 --> 03:46.320]  expect in a 10 pack to get all females. So let's see. And now if we're talking about
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.280]  regular seeds, you were talking about 50%. So she should get around five males to five
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.000]  females, but that's almost never the case. It's usually four and six, seven and three
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.160]  in either direction. Sometimes certain varieties tend to throw more males out than females.
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.920]  But as far as what we're looking for, we had one of my friends texted me who's watching
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.960]  the show today, he was asking about males. If you're pheno hunting males, what are you
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.600]  looking for? Well, there's a lot of things and I think there's a lot of luck involved
[04:17.600 --> 04:25.380]  with males. You know, and not only luck, you can make your own luck by testing and experimenting
[04:25.380 --> 04:30.120]  and seeing what that plant does. So you're looking for structure a lot of times. And
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.440]  the structure should be you're looking for something that's a little bit taller than
[04:33.440 --> 04:38.640]  the female. If you're trying to do an IBL, you're looking for something that has same
[04:38.640 --> 04:44.120]  sort of leaf size and shape, same nodal spacing. You're looking for something that's similar
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.440]  nodal spacing. And then sometimes you get smell and sometimes you get trichomes. Those
[04:48.440 --> 04:57.120]  are great things, but they're not always necessary. So knowing your breeder, researching your
[04:57.120 --> 05:04.800]  breeder, growing their seeds out, those are all important things. So as far as larger
[05:04.800 --> 05:09.360]  populations, I think work better when you're trying to find winners. But if you're a home
[05:09.360 --> 05:15.360]  grower, your expectations may be a lot lower than somebody who's growing on a commercial
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.280]  scale that's trying to create amazing seeds. So it really depends on what you're looking
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.120]  for. You're looking for something that's great, you know, something that's amazing for you
[05:24.120 --> 05:31.040]  as an individual. So yeah, we can open the chat up if you guys have questions on pheno
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.640]  hunting as well, make sure to get them in because we're doing a really short show. We
[05:34.640 --> 05:41.400]  got less than 20 minutes left. But pheno hunting varieties, you know, it's like I've had stuff
[05:41.400 --> 05:46.920]  where I didn't find what I would consider a winner in over 1000 seeds that we popped.
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.320]  And then my friend Midnight Rider popped a 10 pack of seeds and found that one winner.
[05:51.320 --> 05:59.720]  That was the Loudberry cup winning variety that was 2013 in LA, really good cultivar.
[05:59.720 --> 06:04.040]  But he found something unique and it was because it's an outlier. And what those outliers are
[06:04.040 --> 06:10.240]  the the genetic within the genetic diversity, those are the ones that are so far different
[06:10.240 --> 06:18.380]  that it almost doesn't represent the middle, the mean the average, you know, and so those
[06:18.380 --> 06:23.340]  on a large scale, sometimes you need a large space to hunt those out. But for you guys,
[06:23.340 --> 06:27.180]  what you're looking for in a pheno you're looking for, first of all, is terpenes. I
[06:27.180 --> 06:33.500]  think that's the biggest thing is terpene profile for me. For me, it's terpene profile.
[06:33.500 --> 06:37.660]  Some people it's effect. You know, some people are breeding for effect. For me, I'm breeding
[06:37.660 --> 06:45.420]  for terpenes for flavor for that nose. You know, and then we can talk about genotypes
[06:45.420 --> 06:51.180]  versus phenotypes. So phenotype, phenotypical expression, we're talking about phenotypical
[06:51.180 --> 06:57.820]  expression that requires for it to express the same way when you get a seed, the first
[06:57.820 --> 07:01.140]  time you grow it out, it's not going to be the same as the second time you grow it out.
[07:01.140 --> 07:05.740]  Maybe not the third time. Maybe it might take four times to do a proper pheno hunt before
[07:05.740 --> 07:10.340]  you have sexual stability in the plant expresses itself the same every time you grow it. Some
[07:10.340 --> 07:15.180]  people like skipping that step of growing it from seed and they take a clone off just
[07:15.180 --> 07:21.020]  to skip that step so they can see what it does from a clone rather than from seed. But
[07:21.020 --> 07:26.260]  the truth is, you got to wait. You got to wait time that that plant takes time to mature
[07:26.260 --> 07:30.740]  before it'll express itself consistently over time. Sometimes in the beginning, it might
[07:30.740 --> 07:34.900]  harm the first time. If you try to put in a flower from seed too quickly, you're going
[07:34.900 --> 07:40.620]  to get intersexual traits. So those are the things you got to watch out for. Now, moving
[07:40.620 --> 07:46.460]  forward from that, it's like over time you get these different expressions. So you might
[07:46.460 --> 07:52.100]  have to pheno hunt. You might have to go through the same 10 back three times. I used to think
[07:52.100 --> 07:56.700]  that you do it the second time you're done. The guys from Sticky Farms did it with the
[07:56.700 --> 08:02.020]  Pluto three times. And I really kind of geared myself over the last year to trying to grow
[08:02.020 --> 08:07.140]  things out three times to see the differences. And there is a noticeable difference because
[08:07.140 --> 08:11.700]  also you're learning how to grow that cultivar because each cultivar that you grow responds
[08:11.700 --> 08:16.540]  differently. They need a different nutrient regimen. Some like more light, some like less
[08:16.540 --> 08:22.180]  light as far as concentration, some plants like different bulbs. So you might be pheno
[08:22.180 --> 08:28.060]  hunting in an HPS, but you move it to a CMH type environment for light or LED, and it's
[08:28.060 --> 08:33.460]  going to either do better or worse. So that's why it's great to actually go through and
[08:33.460 --> 08:41.820]  do it three times in the same environment to really see what you're getting. Let's see.
[08:41.820 --> 08:47.780]  That's interesting things in the chat here. Simon from Serious Seeds. Let's just talk
[08:47.780 --> 08:53.820]  about Simon for a while. Simon from Serious Seeds, he's someone I look up to. Someone
[08:53.820 --> 09:00.060]  who's a real game changer in the industry, especially with all these F1 so-called breeders,
[09:00.060 --> 09:06.100]  which I would call seed producers. Simon is a real true breeder. He's someone kind
[09:06.100 --> 09:11.860]  of I've modeled some of the stuff I've been working on after what he's done. Simon from
[09:11.860 --> 09:18.180]  Serious, if we're talking about AK47, Cali Mist, a lot of these varieties that Simon
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.860]  created, it's not just that it was the one in a thousand, it's that he took five years
[09:21.860 --> 09:29.180]  to create four strains, four different varieties. And he bred what I would consider to be the
[09:29.180 --> 09:36.420]  closest to true F1s that anybody's done in the cannabis industry. And he's taken four
[09:36.420 --> 09:41.340]  strains that he's gotten from different places. Land-raised strains created F1s and took those
[09:41.340 --> 09:47.740]  F1s after doing a huge selection process, understanding how those plants work, doing
[09:47.740 --> 09:54.520]  the selections and then breeding those to create an F1. Stabilizing over time, stabilizing
[09:54.520 --> 10:00.240]  a variety and then crossing that with another stable variety and then taking two other stable
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.120]  varieties, stabilizing those and crossing them together. And a lot can be said for that.
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.860]  I think we're in a day and age where people are really just trying to get new genetics
[10:10.860 --> 10:14.720]  out as fast as possible. It's like, what's the latest and greatest thing? And if we start
[10:14.720 --> 10:20.400]  working on projects like that, five years from now, it may not be relevant. So we're
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.360]  in a different day and age to a degree, but really we need to go back to the roots and
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.760]  start breeding like they do for traditional agriculture. There's a handful of people doing
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.720]  it. You look at all the big companies out there, they're really gearing towards that.
[10:33.720 --> 10:41.960]  They're doing a lot of sequencing, breeding towards specific traits, doing basically data-driven
[10:41.960 --> 10:48.720]  breeding, which I think is great. But back to the pheno hunting, if you can be like Simon,
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.840]  if you look at AK-47, if you look at some of these, there's a lot of amazing things
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.160]  to be said for Cali Mist AK-47. Yeah, these were the popular strains in the 90s and maybe
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.040]  they aren't the exotics of today, but these are really stable varieties that do really
[11:03.040 --> 11:11.040]  well in multiple types of environments. They're strong, hardy plants. So someone says, I chuck
[11:11.040 --> 11:15.520]  pollen to fund my Ling Term breeding projects. That's great.
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.200]  So as far as what you're looking for, I think the first thing going back to that is terpene
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.800]  profile. And then second thing would be structure. Now, sometimes you're not going to get lucky
[11:26.800 --> 11:29.880]  and get both of those things. You might get one or the other. And then what do you go
[11:29.880 --> 11:34.960]  for? I would stick with that terpene profile and then try to either breed another generation
[11:34.960 --> 11:40.760]  or breed it with something that you'll get better structure out of. But yeah, I think
[11:40.920 --> 11:46.680]  when you're phenohunting, it's those one in a million, it's the terpene profile that makes
[11:46.680 --> 11:53.680]  those things special. So yeah, it's, you know, and I think some things also, if you're breeding
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.680]  for extract, which I think a lot of people are starting to breed specifically for extract,
[11:58.680 --> 12:05.680]  going in that direction, you can get one time, second time, third time, third run that you're
[12:05.680 --> 12:09.680]  doing, make extract out of each of them, compare them. The nice thing with that, you
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.400]  can save it. You're going to get good quality. Another way to save it if you're doing phenohunts
[12:15.400 --> 12:20.680]  is the handy dandy freezer. I have a chest freezer and I save different varieties, cultivars,
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.160]  samples. I have all kinds of different little samples of stuff. I save samples of each thing
[12:25.160 --> 12:31.040]  so that I can compare. And if you use a sandwich bag and then vacuum seal that sandwich bag
[12:31.040 --> 12:35.040]  with the butt in it, all you have to do is pull that out, let it come to room temperature,
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.400]  and then put it in glass and it's good to go. You can win cups with that stuff. You
[12:38.400 --> 12:43.600]  can have it last a year, two years, all that stuff is great. And then you can compare your
[12:43.600 --> 12:51.600]  different runs, your different phenotypes from one time to the next. You can compare
[12:51.600 --> 12:56.840]  different batches. And, you know, I think obviously I was saying terpenes and then structure
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.840]  and then also what works good for you. Because if you're growing outside as opposed to growing
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.840]  indoors, you're going to get and get two different plants almost. So those two different environments,
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.840]  you can have one plant that grows really well outdoors. If you took 10 seeds and you grow
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.840]  them indoors as opposed to outdoors, you're going to get different phenotypical expression
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.840]  because you have different variables as far as nutrition, you know, you're going to get
[13:24.840 --> 13:32.840]  variables as far as nutrition. And so it really depends on what you're breeding for. Huge
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.840]  different, huge things that can affect your plants differently. And, you know, I've seen
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.840]  stuff where it's like we popped a whole bunch outside, then we brought them inside. And
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.840]  the results weren't quite as good. Now, it's so subjective to the individual. And now with
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.840]  sequencing, we can do all kinds of different tests to see what's the best and compare those
[13:54.840 --> 14:00.840]  indoors or narrow your selections down and then compare those. So, yeah. Asked James
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.840]  if he said that the Oakland A's might be leaving for Vegas. I don't know about Oak. I'm
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.840]  actually wearing my A's gear because the Giants lost last night. I'm a Giants and A's fan.
[14:09.840 --> 14:17.840]  So I just couldn't bear it to wear my Giants gear today. So do you see this one? How long
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.840]  are you keeping males and females for back cross purposes? Is that typical part of your
[14:22.840 --> 14:29.840]  breeding program? I used to save a lot more males than I do now. Yeah. And I mean, typically
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.840]  you can save those a long time. A lot of times your males will start to auto flower. You
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.840]  need to keep them under 24 hours of light. You need to as soon as they get bigger, you
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.840]  need to clone off your clone. I would say that saving those for as long as you can or
[14:44.840 --> 14:49.840]  as long as you want to depending on what you're if you're talking about BXing because
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.840]  you're breeding towards a specific thing. That's great. I do a lot of feminized breeding
[14:54.840 --> 15:00.840]  mostly these days. I mean, I do work with males and I do have some males alive, but
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.840]  I have a lot of pollen stored. And so I use a lot of my pollen like I'll make extra pollen
[15:05.840 --> 15:13.840]  and save that pollen. I have pollen around my office here just sitting. So I think those
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.840]  things are great. When you're talking about large scale, it's a different thing. But a
[15:18.840 --> 15:27.840]  lot of breeding I do is in small scale and then seed production is large scale. So someone
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.840]  says that hat he's wearing in particular. I'm an Oakland native. Yeah, this is a loud
[15:33.840 --> 15:39.840]  seeds. This beautiful hair I got here. But yeah, we got grassroots. It's got the stash
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.840]  spot. It's all hemp. These were limited. We're definitely out of them. We'll be doing
[15:45.840 --> 15:53.840]  some more stuff with grassroots in the future, I'm sure. So but back to breeding. So who's
[15:53.840 --> 16:04.260]  got some other questions? We got a few minutes left. Dark Star and Bubblegum. So yeah, it's
[16:04.260 --> 16:11.260]  funny. Some plants won't express that well indoors and other plants do. And it's just
[16:11.260 --> 16:17.260]  not just luck of the draw. So someone says, I thought we should be hunting genotypes and
[16:17.260 --> 16:21.260]  then studying the phenotypical expression for breeding. Isn't hunting for phenotypes
[16:21.260 --> 16:29.260]  just selection based on looks? It 100% is. And I would say that the thing is, is what
[16:29.260 --> 16:34.260]  what I would say most of the people watching this show are looking for is that phenotypical
[16:34.260 --> 16:41.260]  expression. And that's why you do multiple runs. So yeah, you can definitely study the
[16:41.260 --> 16:46.260]  genotypes. But really, at the end of the day, we're looking for that phenotypical expression.
[16:46.260 --> 16:51.260]  You know, and it really depends on how much time you have and how much space you have
[16:51.260 --> 16:58.260]  and how much work you're really willing to do. It's just one of those things. But I would
[16:58.260 --> 17:02.260]  say most people what you guys are looking for when you buy seed packs, you're looking
[17:02.260 --> 17:07.260]  for that phenotypical expression rather than studying genotypes. Now with genotypes, it
[17:07.260 --> 17:12.260]  depends on the amount of genetic diversity. We can talk about that for a minute. So genetic
[17:12.260 --> 17:16.260]  diversity that you have in there, how many phenotypes you're going to have. Sometimes
[17:16.260 --> 17:22.260]  you get two, sometimes you get four, sometimes you get 32 different. I wouldn't say you get
[17:22.260 --> 17:27.260]  32 genotypes. That's a little out of control, but you're definitely going to have phenotypical
[17:27.260 --> 17:33.260]  expression that could be upwards of 32 if you have a lot of genetic diversity. And so
[17:33.260 --> 17:37.260]  going in and if you really want to look at genotypes, then you're looking for things
[17:37.260 --> 17:42.260]  like structure, node spacing, things that aren't going to change, things that are ingrained.
[17:42.260 --> 17:47.260]  That's things that are ingrained in the DNA that doesn't change from phenotypical
[17:47.260 --> 17:55.260]  expression. You know, and terpenes, you know, that nose when we're talking about how the
[17:55.260 --> 18:04.260]  plant smells, those are things that are affected by nutrition and environment. So R.I.P. Frenchy
[18:04.260 --> 18:14.260]  1130, we got his memorial. Really sad, man. How do you breed using living soil? Oh, wait.
[18:14.260 --> 18:19.260]  Okay, we'll go with this one first. If I have pollen that I made, the seeds and right now
[18:19.260 --> 18:25.260]  those seeds are flowering. If I use that ball, how do you put that in words? What is that?
[18:25.260 --> 18:29.260]  So if you made pollen and then you're...
[18:29.260 --> 18:35.260]  So you pollinated some females, those females had seeds, you popped those seeds, then you
[18:35.260 --> 18:38.260]  use the same father's pollen on the next generation.
[18:38.260 --> 18:43.260]  Yeah, you're back crossing. That would be a back cross. Because you're using one of the
[18:43.260 --> 18:47.260]  parents to breed towards that. So you're using that same pollen to breed. And let's say you
[18:47.260 --> 18:51.260]  took that again and you use that same pollen after you made seeds the second time, that
[18:51.260 --> 18:55.260]  would be a BX2. And then you could do a BX3 with that same pollen over and over and over
[18:55.260 --> 19:00.260]  again. If you really like what that pollen does, that's not a bad idea. There's definitely
[19:00.260 --> 19:05.260]  some interesting things, but I would map things like that out. And sometimes you just stumble
[19:05.260 --> 19:10.260]  on things in the process of breeding and in the process of doing seed production. You
[19:10.260 --> 19:16.260]  stumble on things that are like, oh, shit, look what this does. And then, you know, you
[19:16.260 --> 19:20.260]  end up with something special. And at the end of the day, what we're all looking for
[19:20.260 --> 19:24.260]  is something special, I think. Some people are looking for just good flower to grow.
[19:24.260 --> 19:30.260]  And that's why we're talking about this today. You know, as far as pheno hunting, go for
[19:30.260 --> 19:36.260]  the turps first, grow it out multiple times. That is relatively simple. You know, someone
[19:36.260 --> 19:42.260]  has a Durban, I have short and tall pheno pollen. That's great. Durban poison, it's
[19:42.260 --> 19:46.260]  another one. I love talking about Durban poison because the real Durban poison that
[19:46.260 --> 19:52.260]  came down from Sensi seeds that I believe made the cookies came from my friend Josh
[19:52.260 --> 19:58.260]  Silverback from Grow Will and Nutrients. He started Grow Will and Nutrients. Him and my
[19:58.260 --> 20:04.260]  friend Joe went up to BC, bought a pack, brought it down, and theirs smells nothing like the
[20:04.260 --> 20:09.260]  Durban poison that you guys have today. So it's funny because names, they don't mean
[20:09.260 --> 20:13.260]  as much as what you guys think they do. People are like, I got cookies or I got this or I
[20:13.260 --> 20:21.260]  got that. But until you have like it backed by and verified, what you guys are seeing
[20:21.260 --> 20:27.260]  as Durban poison today is not the Durban poison I saw before. And it's because Durban poison,
[20:27.260 --> 20:32.260]  when they released it in seed form, it was crossed with super silver haze. And so what
[20:32.260 --> 20:38.260]  that did, you got a lot of haziness to it and you lost on a lot of the phenotypes and
[20:38.260 --> 20:44.260]  a lot of the genotypes, you lost the muskiness. And the muskiness is what made it special.
[20:44.260 --> 20:48.260]  Now you get the structure, but then when you're talking about the nose, you're getting a lot
[20:48.260 --> 20:54.260]  of lime, you're getting a lot of terpenoline, you're getting a lot of these things that
[20:54.260 --> 21:03.260]  are very distinct and very much like the Colombian varieties, very much like the varieties
[21:03.260 --> 21:08.260]  that you guys are, you know, which are known as hazes, but that really dominant terpene
[21:08.260 --> 21:15.260]  profile, a lot of the stuff is missing that cherry and nice and the Durban. When we talk
[21:15.260 --> 21:21.260]  about Durban, what I know is Durban was this big, huge monster of a plant that had orange
[21:21.260 --> 21:25.260]  yarn hairs that kind of covered up the trichomes. They were there, but they were covered up
[21:25.260 --> 21:31.260]  by these gnarly orange hairs that were like yarn almost. And then the terpene profile
[21:31.260 --> 21:38.260]  was not hazy. It was really, really, really musky. And it had a nice, like it had a licorice
[21:38.260 --> 21:42.260]  smell to it. When you'd squeeze it, it would be like pungent licorice with a little bit
[21:42.260 --> 21:48.260]  of cherry on the back. So there's all kinds of, yeah, we can, we can talk about this for
[21:48.260 --> 21:53.260]  days. Someone saying Durban was several localities around South Africa brought to the seaport.
[21:53.260 --> 21:58.260]  One of the early offerings in the late 80s was sourced from Pinetown. That's awesome.
[21:58.260 --> 22:03.260]  And, but Durban definitely is more musky than the real Durban, I believe is way more
[22:03.260 --> 22:09.260]  musky than it is hazy. And, you know, I talked about this with Ariane on the show. So, you
[22:09.260 --> 22:13.260]  know, beware buyer, beware always of, especially when we're talking about land races, what
[22:13.260 --> 22:18.260]  does it actually cross with? What is it taking away from if I'm trying to hunt for something
[22:18.260 --> 22:22.260]  that is Durban, you should really be looking for more of that stuff. But the Durban cuts
[22:22.260 --> 22:27.260]  that are going around is Durban poison are definitely more haze based. I think what most
[22:27.260 --> 22:32.260]  people know is Durban poison is not what I think is Durban poison and not, you know,
[22:32.260 --> 22:36.260]  if you, you talk to Ariane and some of these old school cats, they're going to talk about
[22:36.260 --> 22:44.260]  Durban poison as being more of that musky variety. So because male selection has been
[22:44.260 --> 22:49.260]  behind female selection for the past 50 years, how do you feel that has affected cultivars
[22:49.260 --> 22:59.260]  and where we are now with what's in the future? You know, I think that's an interesting question.
[22:59.260 --> 23:07.260]  I think that if we look at it from ag perspective, commercial ag perspective, I think we're way,
[23:07.260 --> 23:11.260]  way, way behind. And I don't think it's just the male selection. I think it's just a lot
[23:11.260 --> 23:15.260]  of people, random breeding, pollen shucking and expecting the best. And we have a lot
[23:15.260 --> 23:20.260]  of intersexual traits that were bred into the plant. Now those intersexual traits don't
[23:20.260 --> 23:28.260]  have to be there. That's something that we as, as aficionados and, and enthusiasts and
[23:28.260 --> 23:36.260]  people pollen shucking and breeding and producing seeds, we weren't that aware of. I think there
[23:36.260 --> 23:39.260]  was some of us that were definitely aware of it. You know, moving back and we talked
[23:39.260 --> 23:44.260]  to guys like Rob Clark, we talked to, you know, some of these guys were definitely aware
[23:44.260 --> 23:49.260]  of intersexual traits. Simon from Sirius, he's another one. But a lot of people were
[23:49.260 --> 23:52.260]  like, Oh, I'm just going to take this and I'm going to cross it with this. So a lot
[23:52.260 --> 23:58.260]  of people got lucky with bag seeds too. I think there's a big contributing factor from
[23:58.260 --> 24:04.260]  the bag seed where the bag seeds is where a lot of the winners came from in the past
[24:04.260 --> 24:08.260]  and in the future. And people instantly became breeders when they found a bag seed, they're
[24:08.260 --> 24:13.260]  like, I created this and they found it in a bag of this. I mean, there's people like
[24:13.260 --> 24:19.260]  a chem dog that are very, you know, open about how he found the seeds. But I think not a
[24:19.260 --> 24:28.260]  lot of people over the years have been so crystal clear and, and told the whole story
[24:28.260 --> 24:35.260]  about how they created varieties. So no, any good sativa auto flowers with high yield and
[24:35.260 --> 24:40.260]  fast growing for beginners. You know, I'm working on some stuff. My, my partner, Andrew's
[24:40.260 --> 24:47.260]  working on some really, really awesome sativa autos that I think are going to be game changers.
[24:47.260 --> 24:52.260]  As far as stuff I could recommend, I can't recommend anything in specific right now.
[24:52.260 --> 24:58.260]  But talk about hermaphrodites. See that one. Let's talk about hermaphrodites and the different
[24:58.260 --> 25:04.260]  levels of what's called a hermy or not. Ambiguity is worse. Okay, so hermaphrodites, we're
[25:04.260 --> 25:09.260]  talking about intersexual traits here. Intersexual traits. You can have a female express male.
[25:09.260 --> 25:18.260]  I've even seen, you know, full blown males with larger populations doing feminized seeds.
[25:18.260 --> 25:24.260]  You will get full blown males in your population as your population grows. You know, if you're
[25:24.260 --> 25:30.260]  talking about one in 2000, one in 1000 is acceptable. One in 2000 is acceptable. One
[25:30.260 --> 25:36.260]  in 5000, that's great. But hermaphrodites, they can also be stress related. So you can
[25:36.260 --> 25:42.260]  have sometimes they will express with stress. Sometimes, you know, we were talking about
[25:42.260 --> 25:49.260]  earlier how, oh shit, it's 1129. But yeah, we'll, we'll touch on this real quick. So
[25:49.260 --> 25:53.260]  as far as hermaphrodites, you can get them stress factors. If you sexual maturity can
[25:54.260 --> 26:00.260]  cause plants to stress, huge dips in swing, light, all these different things can cause
[26:00.260 --> 26:05.260]  your plants to express and sometimes they'll just pop bananas. Sometimes you'll get full
[26:05.260 --> 26:11.260]  expression of male flowers. And you know, that's that's specific. You can breed those
[26:11.260 --> 26:17.260]  traits in or out. You can breed sexual stability. You can test for sexual stability if you got
[26:17.260 --> 26:22.260]  money in your varieties. And so these things can be bred in and out and we need to be more
[26:22.260 --> 26:28.260]  conscious and really trying to get rid of the bananas and the Hermes and real push, you
[26:28.260 --> 26:32.260]  know, cookies. Great example of something that has a lot of intersexual traits, cookies
[26:32.260 --> 26:38.260]  is in everything. And so that's why we have a lot of stuff that has these intersexual
[26:38.260 --> 26:43.260]  traits and these these tendencies to express. And sometimes, you know, it goes, there's
[26:43.260 --> 26:47.260]  a selection process, you can find the one that expresses the least or the one that doesn't
[26:47.260 --> 26:52.260]  express at all. But then you cross that back into something. And because it's recessive,
[26:52.260 --> 26:58.260]  it can express on the whole population. And so I've found and with with my partners,
[26:58.260 --> 27:04.260]  we found that as far as expression is concerned, if you're talking about breeding, you want
[27:04.260 --> 27:10.260]  to have the donor more stable than the receiver. And that's just something that's time
[27:10.260 --> 27:14.260]  tested. There's there's other people that will say differently when you talk about on
[27:14.260 --> 27:19.260]  paper. But I would say that if you have a donor that's more stable, you're going to
[27:19.260 --> 27:25.260]  get better results with breeding. So and that's another thing with pheno hunting. Look for
[27:25.260 --> 27:31.260]  those intersexual traits. Also, I think stressing your plants out a little to see if they have
[27:31.260 --> 27:37.260]  intersexual traits is not a bad way to go. Some people have just stressful environments
[27:37.260 --> 27:43.260]  and that's that's okay, too, as long as your plants are coming out great. But I really
[27:43.260 --> 27:49.260]  appreciate the time today. It's eleven thirty one, guys. So we're going to get over to
[27:49.260 --> 27:55.260]  French's memorial. You know, I just want to say Frenchie was a great guy. Legend.
[27:55.260 --> 28:01.260]  Hash legend helped move the industry forward in a positive way. Was very passionate
[28:01.260 --> 28:07.260]  about the sacred plant. I have so many great things to say about Frenchie.
[28:07.260 --> 28:12.260]  But I appreciate your time today, guys. And I look forward to talking to you next week.
[28:12.260 --> 28:16.260]  I'm going to do shows, whether we got my new studio or not. If they're short shows, long shows,
[28:16.260 --> 28:22.260]  we're going to figure it out. Peter's like, man, I was enjoying these Sundays off. But we're back to it, guys.
[28:22.260 --> 28:28.260]  I don't mind at all. My two kids were fighting earlier, so like my stress levels were going up.
[28:28.260 --> 28:34.260]  But yeah, I don't think the Frenchie thing started yet, but that's it's I believe just
[28:34.260 --> 28:40.260]  going to be streaming from his IG account, which you can see Frenchie Canoli.
[28:40.260 --> 28:46.260]  So everybody move on over there. And thanks for joining us for the quick,
[28:46.260 --> 28:53.260]  hard 30 minutes on on Fino hunting. And we'll, I guess, see you next week.
[28:53.260 --> 28:58.260]  Yes. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, everyone. Have a good one, guys.
