[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Come here. What do you have in your hand?
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  Candy?
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  You got two pieces.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  Yeah, but you can't chew it right now. It's ten in the morning.
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  My God, look at your toothless from all the gum chewing.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Everyone see your lack of front teeth?
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  Alright, we are live.
[00:18.000 --> 00:25.000]  Sticky Flower Farm, would you please come to the stage and check your email for the link?
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  But we do see you in the chat, which we appreciate.
[00:28.000 --> 00:36.000]  I remember one time Kevin Jeredry was chatting away with people and I was like, dude, where are you?
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Okay, take it away, Brian.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  Sticky Flower Farm should be jumping on shortly.
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  Good morning to you Living Soil Nerds.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Happy Thursday.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  This is a big day for I feel like a lot of families.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  So shout out to everybody that is a veteran.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  Happy Veterans Day to everybody.
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  I just can't express enough of what I feel like, especially for veterans that want to use cannabis and aren't allowed to are usually penalized.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  If they choose to go the cannabis route by forfeiting their benefits and that kind of stuff.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  So just shout out to everybody that is a veteran.
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.000]  We appreciate you. And hopefully we can continue to put out education where you guys will choose to potentially grow your own and that kind of thing.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  So, Leighton, I also kind of wanted to give you a moment.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  I know that it's pretty hard not to support veterans and children.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  So I wanted to give you a moment to kind of give a shout out as well.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  And I made the ultimate sacrifice to, you know, they got the shit kicked out of him for our country and then our country turned their back on.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  All right. A lot of shit's not right.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  You know, I thank you guys.
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  There's a homeless guy here who's a vet. And every time I see him, I'll swing by him a couple bucks so that he can get something to eat.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  You know, it's heartbreaking to see this. And, you know, here they are making these incredible sacrifices.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  And then we turn their turn our backs on them when they get back.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  Our government's pretty fucked up, to say the least. But stay strong, guys.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  Yeah. Good morning to you, Andy. Shout out to Sticky Flower Farm.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Excited to have you on the show, man.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  There's a lot of people that have been reaching out to the DMs and that kind of thing.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  Interested in kind of picking your brain for a lot of things, man.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  You're an A to Z grower, as I feel like we're starting to maybe coin that term here, where you really understand farming.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  The plant is also finishing off the product in a variety of different ways.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  So excited to, again, pick your brain on that stuff.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  I also wanted to give you a personal shout out, man.
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  You were featured in Ed Rosenthal's book, and I feel like you're humble and maybe not enough people know about that.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  I wanted to kind of give you that accolade because that is something that is pretty cool, man.
[02:49.000 --> 03:00.000]  I feel like to learn from all of these, especially him and a few others that are, in my opinion, living legends and legends, to be featured in something like that.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  I kind of wanted to kick off the show with that, man, so we can kind of talk from what I understand.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  The reason why you were in there is because of your hugelkultur knowledge.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  So I wanted to kind of kick off that and then get more into your backstory.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  I feel like there's a lot of stuff that maybe you just don't tell the community that I hope that we're going to be able to talk about today.
[03:18.000 --> 03:28.000]  To be honest, man, how beautiful your setup is and just the overall experience that I feel like is going to come as you continue to improve your little piece of land.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  I hope that more and more people get involved in that.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  If you have a piece of land, I just don't understand why you wouldn't be going out of your way to find ways to improve it,
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  especially if you believe in passing that on in family and keeping that for generations.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  Then that is something that I feel like these are skill sets that need to be passed on from generation to generation.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  So I wanted to kick it off with you, Andy.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  A shout out to Peter for always making these podcasts.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  But let's kind of kick it off, Andy.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  Why were you featured in Mr. Ed Rosenthal's book?
[04:00.000 --> 04:08.000]  Well, first, I want to say thank you so much to each and every one of you for giving me the opportunity to be here.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  I couldn't be more thrilled to be chosen to just talk with you guys.
[04:14.000 --> 04:22.000]  I've learned just about everything I'm going to share with you guys I've learned off of YouTube or from my peers or people just willing to share on Instagram.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  And this kind of a platform is what's needed so, so bad.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Because what I've seen with my past and growing up on a commercial ag farm in Texas, I know where this is going.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  And if we're going to nitpick now, we're going to end up in some issues.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  So I think sharing knowledge is probably one of the most important parts.
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  So Leighton and Brian, thank you so much for giving me your time and your ear and pulling me on the show.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  And Peter, thank you so much for all the work you do behind the scenes with the link.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  And it was like, pop, there it was.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  You know, it was it was nothing short of miraculous.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  And anyway, where do you go from here?
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  All right. Yeah. Ed's book. Let's let's touch base on that a little bit.
[05:10.000 --> 05:22.000]  Let me grab. And why were you chosen? I mean, obviously, Ed Rosenthal, for those that don't know, is considered like one of the true OGs of giving out information before it was anybody was ever talking about it.
[05:22.000 --> 05:29.000]  So, you know, for you guys that don't know, it's it's a it's an honor to be featured in that book.
[05:29.000 --> 05:37.000]  So if you are talking Hugelkultur, let's kind of talk more on on the reasons why you were featured in that book and we'll kind of run down that road.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  OK, well, I want to show the book that I was featured in here.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  This is the Cannabis Growers Handbook.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  It is massive to be part of it.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  I can't. I mean.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Talk about I don't know. It's such an honor.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  It's such an honor. I was reached out to.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  Because they just see me on Instagram using I was just going out and picking mushrooms.
[06:07.000 --> 06:16.000]  And it's amazing what you learn a year later whenever you read the book and you're like, oh, my, there's some things in there that like I was I was very immature in my thinking with that.
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  But like that was part of my progress.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  And this is part of the story. And I think everyone needs to know that.
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  My uncle would always say, never be ashamed to get in at a price at which you can afford.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  And I think that's so true with cannabis.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  And the Instagram just puts a big stop on that.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  People are like, I don't want to do it.
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000]  And like, look like a fool.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  But like I was going out and picking mushrooms and leaf mold and things.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  And I was putting those in my aerated compost teas that I was, again, putting on my hugelkultur.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  I did a long mound and then I did mounds.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  My wife and I, a little bit of her.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  I'll touch a little bit on this. We can talk about a little bit later.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  But in March of 2020, we sold our business of 10 years and moved out to 10 acres outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  And so we had fresh land and some of it had what looks like has never been touched.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  There's 10 acres. Five of that is at the bottom of the hill and five at the top.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  The five on the bottom is all untouched wooded areas.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  I mean, oak trees as big as a VW Bug around.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  And then the top half is not that.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  So whenever you start getting in the soil, it's like I'm not able to just throw a bunch of money down for soil test,
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  even though I know that that the efficacy of that is there.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  You need to know what you're working with.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  I didn't necessarily have it. I just had my background grown up on a farm.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  Stick your finger in the dirt, rub it around, smell it, look at it, look what's growing there and go from there.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  And so what I did was I took the hugelkultur model and I said, I want to try hugelkultur.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  So I dug a bed and did the normal layering.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  And then for the other 10 plants I took and I built mounds.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  And I didn't I didn't send a picture of these, but they're just they're just mounds of dirt.
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  And I put five logs. I took a postal digger and I dug five holes in the middle of that mound spaced evenly.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  And then I took two foot long logs, oak logs and dropped them in there.
[08:11.000 --> 08:22.000]  And so they were sitting vertical. The reason why is because my my sand in my soil was was it's either sloppy and you've got a bunch of water or like it's dry as a bone.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  You don't really have many. There's there's no there's no fluctuation.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  There's no room for error. You know, there's no room for the hot and the cold and the wet and the dry cycles.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  And so dropping that log in there was my idea of doing that.
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  Whenever you do hugelkultur, you need to build your beds and then not expect the first year to get a huge crop out of it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  It takes a while for things to start breaking down and get get to kicking, you know.
[08:50.000 --> 09:03.000]  So I knew that going in. So I wanted to do these mounds and then I would go pick mushrooms and stuff from the woods and put those in my area to compost teas and then put that on top of the mounds to just hit it as hard as I could with as much diversity.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  That was my goal. And what I learned real quick was that's like subtle rosegill mushrooms were growing like crazy in there.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  And those have been picked up from some leaf litter that I saw near my one of my ponds that was dug out.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  They're all laid with the late like they're laid on on contour.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  I was probably done in the 40s, but they're in the woods. So I go out there and I pick up leaf litter.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  And then because that leaf litter I had subtle rosegill and then a bunch of bird nest fungi.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  Those were loaded in there, breaking down some of that, some of those wood chips and stuff that I had on top.
[09:38.000 --> 09:51.000]  So they called and they reached out Angela Baca and just said, hey, I'd love to visit with you about how you're getting this quality of rosin out of natural farming, especially in Oklahoma.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  And for me, it's this big, broad picture. It's 10, 15, 20 years down the line. It's thinking five, six, seven generations in.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  Where's this going to be? I'm not trying to think of how do I get the 2025 Corvette?
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  I don't. That's foolish. That's straight foolish.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  So anyway, they reached out to me for that and they did an interview with me and it was awesome.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  I mean, just be able to share that with them. And then a guy named Jeff Hooten, Cased God is his Instagram handle.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  He came out, took some pictures for the book as well. Got to meet him.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  And yeah, I mean, yeah.
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  And as far as like on Instagram, you're kind of newer to the scene unless you've had something deleted that I didn't know about.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  I mean, you know, my research on you before the show was that you came on board July 2018.
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  As far as like Instagram world, you know, you're kind of newer to exposing yourself to all this stuff.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  And I encourage a lot of people to go check out his Instagram.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.000]  It is a treasure trove of seeing this in action, seeing it on his farm, the FPJs and stuff that you're showing,
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  like the just the overall just the color of the flowers themselves. It's just beautiful, man.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  So I feel like you're not you're not in probably by choice, I would imagine.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  But there's a lot of things that are so beautiful about what you're doing.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  And you don't really show as much as I kind of hope that you would following you after you and I had a discussion in July.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  So I was hoping that maybe today, too, I could encourage you to kind of show more of that stuff, show more of the farm.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  There's a lot of even livestock and stuff I want to talk about later in the show where we can get into that.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  But I feel like when people are really focused on becoming that A to Z farmer, for lack of a better term on that,
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  I feel like that's how you really make a name for yourself.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  And obviously, people see the quality in the flower that you're doing by, you know, finishing it off in the concentrate world.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  So when they're reaching out to you, I, you know, I just wanted to highlight that to you, man,
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  and to the world so that more people can kind of see that, like, this is what it really takes to build something that other people admire.
[12:09.000 --> 12:18.000]  And when other people are going out of their way to reach it to you, I feel like when you're newer on Instagram and the community just kind of gravitating to you,
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  it's obviously shows you the grind of Instagram because, you know, for the cannabis accounts, a lot of that stuff is slowed down.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  And if you're too popular, they they kind of like blackball you with all these different techniques and that kind of stuff.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  Or in some ways now they just delete hashtags in general or hide the hashtag in general.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  So if you had a certain popular thing that that slows down growth.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  So I encourage a lot of the people out there that, you know, if you really give a shit about those metrics, I feel like you're focused on the wrong one.
[12:47.000 --> 12:55.000]  It's more about the engagement. Are people talking on your, you know, are people focused more than just like scrolling through your thing and liking your photo?
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  Are they actually sitting there and kind of engaging with what's going on?
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  And that's something that I feel like Andy's Instagram is fantastic for. And you guys can kind of see it in real time.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  So for a lot of you out there that that sometimes make certain K&F ideas or you're trying to maybe go down that road as well.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  I feel like you see the difference in what Andy is doing with the coloring and all that stuff.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  I just feel like you're having quality inputs in everything that you're doing and it's coming out in the end product.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  Yeah, something and I'm not an Instagram guru by any means, probably the least qualified to talk about this.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  I just know that the save button boosts the algorithm. I mean, it's so give stuff for people to save.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  I mean, they were an FPGA recipe. Save it. What do I do? I save it.
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.000]  There's other people are sharing tech. You know, Marco's growing. He was sharing some where he just digs a hole by some of his mulch beds and then pulls humic acids out of that.
[13:56.000 --> 14:07.000]  I'm like, brilliant. Save. Boost that algorithm. So really just share what you got and you're going to look like a fool sometimes.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  You know, I've made some mistakes and look look foolish. And then I've also learned a bunch of stuff.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  I mean, with the flower from it, you're talking about the colors. There was a flower FPGA that I did.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  So about my farm a little bit. There's 10 acres here. My wife and I, we raise all of our own food on our property as much as we can.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  We buy very little from the grocery store. We eat as raw as we possibly can.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  So like in the morning, we're getting smoothies like my wife will make a smoothie in the morning.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  And there's obviously certain things you buy from a grocery store, but like walk out and go to the greenhouse during the winter or during the summer.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  Go out and pick that lettuce and stuff that you're going to put in that smoothie so that you're inoculating yourself to.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  That was important for us. And to be able to do that and to be able to incorporate animals into this production.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  Like I say this and it probably gets some bad rap, but turds to turps like turds to turps.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  You can turn turds into turps and some people like their turps to smell like turds.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  I've got I've got a strain in the freeze dryer called scotoli and it smells like a port-a-john at a food truck festival.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  It's it's wretched. It's terrible. And that has nothing to do with the inputs.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  Didn't use, you know, the manure inputs didn't do that.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  So don't think that like you're going to add a bunch of chicken shit to something and like get really stinky GMO.
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  Like you're you're not you're going to get a really stinky bed probably of GMO.
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  Anyway, I don't know where I was going with that, but I just my biggest thing with Instagram, man, is I just want to share with people.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  I didn't know how to do any of this stuff. I grew up on a commercial ag farm.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  Like you want to talk about acres. You and I were talking about this yesterday.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  You talk about acreage that that whole world is a whole nother world that people don't even understand.
[15:52.000 --> 16:00.000]  And to tell my family that I I've got a quarter to half acre garden and then I've got an acre and a half of a pasture.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Whenever I've got an uncle that has twenty four hundred acres on a ranch.
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.000]  I mean, like it's laughable, straight up laughable, but I can take risk.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  They can't even imagine I can risk an entire crop and that's OK and they can't.
[16:16.000 --> 16:27.000]  And I think that this is the future of ag. And if we let cannabis be a driver for that, we're going to completely change what an opportunity within ag.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  I'm not saying we're changing commercial ag. You're not. The monster is too big.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  You're not. Don't even don't even try it. Don't even attempt. Don't just don't.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  That'd be like me. That'd be like me going on an NBA team.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  Come on. It's laughable. Create another game. Do something else.
[16:44.000 --> 16:50.000]  Do something that differentiates you with my farm and what we do here on the property.
[16:50.000 --> 17:00.000]  You know, those those microbes, that whole process that takes takes cannabis and it makes it incredibly complex.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  You know, you guys always ask for like sayings or things. And I was like, what are things that I always like think?
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  And you can't have complexity without diversity. Your diversity leads to your complexity.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  You can have way more complex turkeys. You can have way more complex gardens, polycultures.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  You wouldn't imagine the stuff that you can do there as long as you have more diversity.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Your diversity helps balance everything. Your diversity.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  You know, this year didn't have near the worms that I had last year, but that's because there was pollinate.
[17:29.000 --> 17:38.000]  There was more pollinators on the property. Next year, I probably won't have many worms because I'm going to plant pollinators all around my gardens because I've seen like, yeah, wasps up.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  They bite you and that's not fun. But like, just just don't go pick their flower.
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  You know, they're cool with it as long as you don't inject their food, you know.
[17:47.000 --> 17:58.000]  So that's for me, man. Diversity is that. And if you want something to differentiate you, don't go buy the same bottles from the same growth store that everyone else has.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  Go take manure and break it down or do a hash reactor. I don't know.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  I probably sent a picture of that to Peter, but it's a bioreactor.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  I don't remember the name of the gentleman late and you probably know.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  Well, Johnson Sue was the one that started it, but he was more focused on using manures.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  And I think that's that's the that was the problem.
[18:21.000 --> 18:30.000]  He was in such a dry environment that he didn't have a lot of access to carbon sources other than a ton of manures.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  So, yeah, that's a that's a whole nother game. But yeah, dude, I'm fucking big at the shit you're saying.
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  Diversity, diversity, diversity. Keep rolling. Keep rolling.
[18:40.000 --> 18:48.000]  And I'm excited. We're gonna we're gonna do like more of a live demo and stuff just to let everybody know Peter had to run some errands behind the scenes.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  So we're kind of switching things a little around a little bit.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  But we're obviously going to dive deeper into this and kind of show you guys in real time.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  I would say in fairness, once you've learned this kind of how easy it can be once you understand things.
[19:02.000 --> 19:12.000]  And I hope that this goalpost seems a little bit closer to you after today of maybe wanting to become an A to Z farmer after you kind of see where what Andy is about.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  Because for me, man, you're kind of living the dream of everyone.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  When you have your own ranch, you're growing your own stuff and squishing your own stuff and washing your own stuff.
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.000]  And, you know, whatever route you choose, I just feel like having your own is that dream come true.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  And it's very hard to attain for most individuals.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  So for a lot of us, you know, we do it on a smaller scale.
[19:33.000 --> 19:42.000]  And I want to dive deeper into the manures with you and Leighton, because I've personally seen that, obviously, on a microcosm scale of using the lion head rabbits.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  I don't have alpacas, but that would be the goal if I was at your level, Andy.
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  So I kind of wanted to talk about the variety of different manures, which ones you feel like are worth it, which ones aren't going to be worth it,
[19:53.000 --> 20:03.000]  especially if you are getting tested as a cannabis farmer, because I feel like some people just go crazy with that stuff, adding a lot of dairy cow manures and not really sourcing it.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  You know, just a lot of the rookie mistakes.
[20:06.000 --> 20:14.000]  So I kind of wanted to give a rookie blanketed advice with you, Andy and Leighton, on manures and let people know really the difference even between cold manures and hot manures.
[20:14.000 --> 20:20.000]  Definitely. I want to touch on the bioreactor real quick and I'll jump right in the manures.
[20:20.000 --> 20:34.000]  With the bioreactor, I did what's called a hash reactor, and it's where I ran all of my hash water out of my washroom here into the middle of a bioreactor that I just filled with wood chips and stuff that we have out of our garden.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  Wood chips, garden waste, things like that.
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  I put about two and a half to three gallons of just chicken bedding on top, just so there's a little bit of in and it's not just all browns.
[20:45.000 --> 20:52.000]  The idea was that just hold the terpenes that I'm losing in my wash and to be able to introduce those back into the soil.
[20:52.000 --> 21:02.000]  You guys shared something about terpenes and how microbes communicate under the ground with terpenes, and I'm just like, let's just give them a bunch of computers to work with
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  so that they can just send signals to each other and go for it.
[21:07.000 --> 21:18.000]  The idea of that, and I'll go into manures, is the concepts of them, the structural bones of Korean natural farming, the structural bones of Jadam.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  You can use K&F all by yourself, and IMOs are the magic on that.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  I have not done IMO three, four, or five.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  I look to do that in the spring or this winter if I'm able to.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  Korean natural farming all by itself is a functional methodology that works.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  If you take the bones of it, you can apply it to your local terroir, your local environment.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  I wanted to take the bones of Korean natural farming.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  I wanted to take the bones of Jadam, which I had a blast with Jadam this year.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  I feel like Jadam's probably a little bit less.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  It's easy to put.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  Jadam's the kid, and K&F's the dad.
[21:56.000 --> 22:05.000]  Jadam was started because he saw his dad's methods, and he took those bones, and he tweaked them a little, and you ended up with this wonderful thing.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  With manures, all of that's like, okay, so the microbes, you want diversity.
[22:11.000 --> 22:21.000]  You can feed your animals diversity and change your manures because if manures, say, from CAFOs, feed yards.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  I grew up around them.
[22:24.000 --> 22:35.000]  There's a CAFO by my hometown that feeds around 40 truckloads, 40 semi-loads of corn per day, 40.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  So there's around 40,000 pounds of grain in one of those truckloads.
[22:40.000 --> 22:47.000]  That's chewed through by cows every day in the front end, at the back end, and then they've got to haul it in, and they've got to haul it out.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  What a lot of those places are doing is they're composting them so that they pass organic certification, whatever that is, and then they're able to use it.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  I got some of that compost when we first came on our property, and we put it in our garden.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  It was just stale.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  It was stagnant.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  There was nothing to it.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  It was just like this is basically cow poop that's composted, thermophilic.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  So they put them in long rows, and then they process them.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.000]  I think it takes them three weeks.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  They do it pretty quick.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  Late in the compost guru, you may know exactly what they do there.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  I know what's in it because I know what they're all fed.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  I know the rate and the rates, just all that.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  It's like that affects the manure.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  I got pigs.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  You guys mentioned something on a show about lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus being in the gut of a pig.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  I was like, oh, that changes things.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  So I went and did some research on it.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  Yes, all the research that's done is done with pigs in confined animal feeding operations.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  I don't really trust that.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Of course, it's got E. coli in it.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  What are you feeding them?
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  You're feeding them grains all day long, every day.
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.000]  You keep them in a confined spot.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  They stain in their poop.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  What humans eat lunch sitting on the toilet?
[24:02.780 --> 24:04.780]  But we demand it of our animals.
[24:04.780 --> 24:05.780]  I do.
[24:07.780 --> 24:08.780]  I didn't even know Peter was back.
[24:10.780 --> 24:11.780]  Yeah, man.
[24:11.780 --> 24:12.780]  That's pretty gross.
[24:13.780 --> 24:14.780]  It's insanity, brother.
[24:14.780 --> 24:15.780]  Insanity.
[24:17.780 --> 24:18.780]  It is insane.
[24:18.780 --> 24:19.780]  I like Joel Salatin a lot.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.780]  You'll probably hear me reference him some.
[24:22.780 --> 24:24.780]  He'll always say, folks, this ain't normal.
[24:24.780 --> 24:25.780]  Because it's not normal.
[24:25.780 --> 24:26.780]  It's just not at all.
[24:28.780 --> 24:30.780]  Your different manures do different things.
[24:30.780 --> 24:36.780]  I wish I had found a sheet somewhere that basically lists what manures hold what.
[24:37.780 --> 24:38.780]  What I found is this.
[24:38.780 --> 24:41.780]  We have three main manures that I worked with this year.
[24:41.780 --> 24:43.780]  That was chicken, duck, and turkey.
[24:45.780 --> 24:52.780]  All that manure is the feed that's fed it is from a local farm here that I get to mill the ration for me.
[24:53.780 --> 24:55.780]  It's all either certified organic or non-GMO.
[24:56.780 --> 24:57.780]  One or the other.
[24:57.780 --> 24:58.780]  We're in Oklahoma.
[24:58.780 --> 24:59.780]  We've got grains all around us.
[24:59.780 --> 25:00.780]  You've got to work with what you've got.
[25:01.780 --> 25:04.780]  The microbial world can really chew through a lot of stuff.
[25:04.780 --> 25:09.780]  I'm not going to overload their plate and ask them to chew through Roundup all the time.
[25:10.780 --> 25:12.780]  If that's all that you have, work with it.
[25:13.780 --> 25:16.780]  Don't be afraid to get in at a price at which you can afford.
[25:17.780 --> 25:18.780]  Work with it.
[25:18.780 --> 25:19.780]  I know some guys that do organics.
[25:19.780 --> 25:26.780]  All they do is grab barrels and barrels and barrels of food waste, like prep waste, from a local grocery store.
[25:27.780 --> 25:28.780]  Is that all organic?
[25:28.780 --> 25:29.780]  No.
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.780]  You pass it through a pig, is it organic then?
[25:30.780 --> 25:31.780]  I don't know.
[25:31.780 --> 25:32.780]  I don't know the answer to that.
[25:33.780 --> 25:35.780]  The different manures change with that.
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.780]  Like turkeys.
[25:36.780 --> 25:37.780]  Turkeys are a lot like a chicken.
[25:37.780 --> 25:38.780]  It's a lot hotter of a manure.
[25:38.780 --> 25:40.780]  I won't even talk about the NPK because it doesn't really matter.
[25:40.780 --> 25:41.780]  It's just a lot hotter of a manure.
[25:41.780 --> 25:42.780]  It's a lot stronger.
[25:42.780 --> 25:43.780]  You can get a lot more done with it.
[25:44.780 --> 25:45.780]  We have ducks.
[25:45.780 --> 25:46.780]  What I've learned with ducks is this.
[25:46.780 --> 25:47.780]  They are microbial gatherers.
[25:48.780 --> 25:53.780]  They stick their beak in the ground and they shove it full of water and they just work it like crazy.
[25:54.780 --> 25:56.780]  They fill their whole mouth full of dirt and they just eat it.
[25:57.780 --> 25:58.780]  They're not going to eat it.
[25:58.780 --> 25:59.780]  They're going to eat it.
[25:59.780 --> 26:00.780]  They're going to eat it.
[26:00.780 --> 26:01.780]  They're going to eat it.
[26:01.780 --> 26:02.780]  They're going to eat it.
[26:02.780 --> 26:03.780]  They're going to eat it.
[26:03.780 --> 26:04.780]  They're going to eat it.
[26:04.780 --> 26:09.780]  Dirt, microbes and worms and then that shoots right out the back end about five minutes later.
[26:10.780 --> 26:11.780]  There's a reason why they're called waterfowl.
[26:12.780 --> 26:18.780]  If you let the duck express the duckness of the duck, let them play in water.
[26:18.780 --> 26:22.780]  Let them do their thing and learn how to plug that into what you got.
[26:23.780 --> 26:26.780]  Oklahoma Kush Collective, he got three ducks for me earlier this year.
[26:27.780 --> 26:30.780]  He ran those in his grow in his backyard and he would just take his pools.
[26:30.780 --> 26:31.740]  we just take his pool.
[26:31.740 --> 26:35.400]  So we've got two pools in our run with the ducks
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.660]  and the geese.
[26:36.660 --> 26:39.560]  And they get it full of poop and dirt and feed
[26:39.560 --> 26:40.600]  and all this stuff.
[26:40.600 --> 26:42.900]  And you can just take that water and dump it out.
[26:42.900 --> 26:44.760]  It's not really hot.
[26:44.760 --> 26:46.900]  Hot meaning it's not really loaded with nitrogen
[26:46.900 --> 26:49.720]  so you cook whatever it touches.
[26:49.720 --> 26:52.280]  It's just a microbial inoculant.
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.040]  And so it's like, wow, that's a tool.
[26:55.040 --> 26:57.100]  Again, bones of things.
[26:57.100 --> 26:58.680]  Take Korean Natural Farming, JADAM,
[26:58.680 --> 27:00.700]  you understand the microbials, the diversity,
[27:00.700 --> 27:04.060]  all of that, and then plug that into your livestock.
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.180]  Korean Natural Farming does beet bedding.
[27:06.180 --> 27:08.100]  I'm doing that with my pigs this year
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.660]  because I want to collect all that pig poop
[27:09.660 --> 27:11.460]  because come spring, I'm gonna need to expand
[27:11.460 --> 27:13.800]  my hugel mounds and I need that manure.
[27:14.820 --> 27:18.020]  I'm able to do everything closed loop on the property.
[27:18.020 --> 27:19.680]  With turkeys, I mentioned this yesterday.
[27:19.680 --> 27:21.020]  Something that I found that's really cool,
[27:21.020 --> 27:22.900]  I hope people are doing this at home,
[27:22.900 --> 27:26.740]  is if you give animals the access to charred wood,
[27:26.740 --> 27:28.980]  so you take a branch, you leave it in the fire
[27:28.980 --> 27:31.540]  and you drag it out, and now it's charred.
[27:31.540 --> 27:33.940]  Yeah, there's some of our pigs.
[27:33.940 --> 27:34.980]  You take that charred wood
[27:34.980 --> 27:37.000]  and you put it in the pen with them.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.900]  You don't necessarily have to put it in their food
[27:38.900 --> 27:42.660]  because then you're having to manage, it's going in.
[27:42.660 --> 27:44.340]  You need to manage the amount that it is
[27:44.340 --> 27:48.420]  and I think that too much biochar in their food
[27:48.420 --> 27:50.300]  would be too much for them.
[27:50.300 --> 27:52.220]  But a little bit of charcoal every now and then
[27:52.220 --> 27:53.060]  doesn't hurt anything.
[27:53.060 --> 27:55.660]  So take that burnt log and throw it in your pen.
[27:56.660 --> 27:58.060]  One day I walked into my turkey run
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.220]  and this is what I found, black poop.
[28:00.220 --> 28:03.500]  Straight black turkey poop with a white dot on top.
[28:03.500 --> 28:06.700]  And I was like, oh God, my turkeys are dying, what the heck.
[28:06.700 --> 28:09.500]  Well, they had found a branch that had been charred
[28:09.500 --> 28:11.780]  from a small fire on the ground in that run.
[28:11.780 --> 28:14.460]  I move my turkeys about every month from where they're at
[28:14.460 --> 28:16.000]  just because we haven't had that many.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.660]  Yeah, there's the geese, my wife.
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.240]  And they eat that charcoal, that biochar,
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.120]  and then they pooped it out the back.
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.960]  So you have inoculated biochar
[28:28.960 --> 28:31.840]  coming out the back end of a turkey for free.
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.400]  You didn't have to inoculate.
[28:33.400 --> 28:35.080]  You just threw it in there and the turkey was like,
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.120]  oh hey, some charcoal, this is good for my system.
[28:38.120 --> 28:39.940]  I'm gonna eliminate some toxins.
[28:41.180 --> 28:44.240]  And our pasture's way better for it.
[28:44.240 --> 28:46.880]  We're spreading biochar all thanks to turkeys.
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.300]  Yeah, so there's turkeys whenever they were really young
[28:50.300 --> 28:51.920]  and then you notice there's a red chicken
[28:51.920 --> 28:53.040]  in the middle of them.
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.200]  Whenever they're raised together, they imprint sometimes
[28:57.200 --> 28:59.800]  and that chicken was convinced it was a turkey.
[28:59.800 --> 29:01.140]  I mean, convinced.
[29:02.640 --> 29:06.620]  Yeah, so it didn't taste like a turkey though.
[29:06.620 --> 29:07.640]  I promise you that.
[29:07.640 --> 29:08.880]  It tasted like a chicken.
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.600]  So anyway, that's kind of the rundown on manures.
[29:13.600 --> 29:14.920]  You were talking about rabbit manure,
[29:14.920 --> 29:18.380]  something that I observed this year in my pasture
[29:18.380 --> 29:20.840]  was as we've taken on this property
[29:20.840 --> 29:23.240]  and we've kind of started to protect it,
[29:23.240 --> 29:25.420]  squirrels started coming back to the property.
[29:25.420 --> 29:27.760]  I don't know why they were gone, but they just weren't here
[29:27.760 --> 29:29.840]  and then rabbits started showing back up.
[29:29.840 --> 29:32.200]  So we've been seeing some cottontails running around.
[29:32.200 --> 29:34.400]  I saw a big reishi mushroom about this tall
[29:34.400 --> 29:37.400]  sticking up out of the pasture, which is random,
[29:37.400 --> 29:39.320]  in the middle of a clover patch.
[29:39.320 --> 29:41.400]  And you looked and you got close,
[29:41.400 --> 29:44.340]  there was about 15 or 20 rabbit droppings right there.
[29:45.600 --> 29:48.220]  And so I don't know what that does or where that works,
[29:48.220 --> 29:49.680]  but it's pretty cool to find a reishi
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.640]  out in the middle of nowhere.
[29:50.640 --> 29:53.700]  And the reason for it was that rabbit poop, I'm convinced.
[29:53.700 --> 29:57.300]  It was part of the nitrogen source to really push it.
[29:57.300 --> 30:00.160]  So I'm very interested in the rabbit poop as well.
[30:00.160 --> 30:02.520]  Yeah, there's some of our chickens, the posse.
[30:02.520 --> 30:03.680]  My wife loves this picture.
[30:03.680 --> 30:05.240]  She's like, they look like gangsters, man.
[30:05.240 --> 30:07.520]  They're just about to come out and come after you.
[30:08.840 --> 30:12.280]  Anyway, yeah, so we have them in coops and then we move them
[30:12.280 --> 30:14.280]  so we follow the Joel Salatin model.
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.200]  He moves them every day.
[30:16.200 --> 30:18.520]  We allow them to kind of stay in one spot
[30:18.520 --> 30:20.200]  until they do the work that we want them to do.
[30:20.200 --> 30:23.320]  So the picture with the geese with my wife,
[30:23.320 --> 30:24.840]  that's in her cut flower garden.
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.120]  So she sells cut flowers to like local flower shops
[30:28.120 --> 30:30.200]  as well as making seeds to sell.
[30:31.120 --> 30:32.960]  And so what we learned this year was that
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.560]  they imprinted with her at a very,
[30:34.560 --> 30:36.520]  they imprinted with her because she's very close
[30:36.520 --> 30:39.640]  with the geese and all the animals.
[30:39.640 --> 30:41.360]  They imprinted with her and what we learned this spring
[30:41.360 --> 30:43.480]  was those are dahlias in front of her.
[30:43.480 --> 30:46.000]  She's able to go pick the grass that she wants them to pick
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.840]  and they'll actually rip the grass out
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.880]  and work the bed for you.
[30:49.880 --> 30:50.720]  And guess what?
[30:50.720 --> 30:53.240]  They get fed and they send out manure on the back end
[30:53.240 --> 30:56.160]  so that dahlias next year can be prettier.
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.000]  And that whole cut flower garden
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.160]  is where I'm able to get some of the inputs.
[31:00.160 --> 31:03.000]  Again, it's just observation, looking at what you have.
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.840]  So it was like, oh, I've got dahlias.
[31:06.440 --> 31:08.120]  Oh my gosh, I can't even name all the flowers.
[31:08.120 --> 31:09.520]  There's so many in there.
[31:09.520 --> 31:12.140]  And that picture I put in there, Peter,
[31:12.140 --> 31:13.500]  it's just all of them on a board.
[31:13.500 --> 31:15.740]  I was just about to chop them up, yeah.
[31:15.740 --> 31:17.440]  And the reason for this was inspired
[31:17.440 --> 31:19.100]  by Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.620]  Big shout out to Josh and Kelly.
[31:20.620 --> 31:23.500]  You guys are so inspirational to so many people.
[31:23.500 --> 31:25.180]  And that's one of my goals for the farm
[31:25.180 --> 31:28.500]  is to end up being Dragonfly Earth certified
[31:30.220 --> 31:31.340]  and being all closed loop.
[31:31.340 --> 31:34.180]  And so this was something that I experimented with this year
[31:34.180 --> 31:35.740]  was like, there's all these flower heads
[31:35.740 --> 31:37.540]  and what were we gonna do with them?
[31:39.060 --> 31:41.760]  So let's chop them up and let's make a FPGA out of it.
[31:42.720 --> 31:44.540]  That is probably the best tasting FPGA
[31:44.540 --> 31:46.620]  on the face of the earth.
[31:46.620 --> 31:50.380]  And I wanted to do it to add more flavonoids
[31:50.380 --> 31:54.060]  and all of that intelligence that those flowers pack.
[31:54.060 --> 31:57.040]  I wanted to give that to the plants.
[31:57.040 --> 31:59.820]  And so in order to give them that opportunity
[31:59.820 --> 32:03.740]  to express themselves that way, I did the flower FPGA.
[32:04.540 --> 32:05.620]  Yeah, there's one of the flowers
[32:05.620 --> 32:09.340]  with a white crab spider of sort in the middle of it.
[32:11.340 --> 32:13.300]  This is a gold bar and you're either gonna get it
[32:13.300 --> 32:15.220]  or it's gonna hit you inside the head.
[32:15.220 --> 32:18.700]  Observation is like the number one thing to learning.
[32:18.700 --> 32:20.160]  You have to observe.
[32:20.980 --> 32:22.180]  We spent our first year here.
[32:22.180 --> 32:25.340]  We made a few mistakes on the property.
[32:25.340 --> 32:28.620]  But really, biggest thing I learned was observation's key.
[32:28.620 --> 32:30.300]  So this is just observation
[32:30.300 --> 32:33.220]  where I'm sharing pictures on my gram, just observation.
[32:33.220 --> 32:35.920]  And Brian, I'm definitely gonna take the time to share more
[32:35.920 --> 32:39.140]  about some of the methods and things and the reasons why.
[32:39.140 --> 32:42.100]  Because I feel like what I take for granted
[32:42.100 --> 32:46.200]  growing up on a farm, most people, it's brand new to them.
[32:47.100 --> 32:49.860]  And a lot of people are so intimidated by it.
[32:49.860 --> 32:53.140]  Chickens are so easy, y'all, so easy.
[32:53.140 --> 32:54.900]  If you don't have chickens in your backyard
[32:54.900 --> 32:57.420]  and you're in town, I mean, really?
[33:01.460 --> 33:02.940]  Get it.
[33:02.940 --> 33:04.760]  To eat food in the morning.
[33:05.660 --> 33:07.460]  So the chicken walks around the backyard
[33:07.460 --> 33:09.700]  and then it goes in its thing, it sings a little happy song
[33:09.700 --> 33:11.580]  and then an egg pops out the back.
[33:11.580 --> 33:14.420]  In the morning, you take that, you crack that egg open,
[33:14.420 --> 33:16.500]  you eat it before you go feed the chicken.
[33:16.500 --> 33:18.940]  That animal is feeding you.
[33:18.940 --> 33:21.200]  It's providing for you.
[33:21.200 --> 33:22.820]  That changes things.
[33:22.820 --> 33:25.220]  People talk about the sacredness of life.
[33:25.220 --> 33:27.200]  How sacred is that?
[33:27.200 --> 33:29.140]  Like, totally doing it for you.
[33:29.140 --> 33:31.100]  And then it's pooping all over your backyard.
[33:31.100 --> 33:33.800]  Whoever owns the house that we were in in Tulsa,
[33:33.800 --> 33:36.600]  they will never have to fertilize their yard again.
[33:36.600 --> 33:39.260]  We had eight hens in the backyard, in a small backyard,
[33:39.260 --> 33:41.820]  and then we raised six broilers.
[33:41.820 --> 33:45.020]  So a broiler is a chicken that's bred specifically
[33:45.020 --> 33:46.500]  to grow for meat.
[33:46.500 --> 33:48.700]  So if you're eating a meat chicken in,
[33:48.700 --> 33:50.820]  if you're eating meat from the grocery store,
[33:50.820 --> 33:53.220]  99% chance it's from a broiler,
[33:53.220 --> 33:56.020]  and that's just to describe that type of chicken.
[33:56.020 --> 33:58.440]  What we used was a Cornish cross.
[33:58.440 --> 34:03.380]  So a Cornish cross is what these Tyson chicken houses use.
[34:03.380 --> 34:05.780]  They put 25,000 in a barn,
[34:05.780 --> 34:08.540]  and it goes from a chick to a five and a half pound bird
[34:08.540 --> 34:10.300]  in eight weeks.
[34:10.300 --> 34:12.460]  Within a week after that eight weeks,
[34:12.460 --> 34:16.020]  your mortality rate's like 25 to 30% per day.
[34:16.020 --> 34:17.940]  That whole barn starts dying,
[34:17.940 --> 34:19.260]  and it's because their heart doesn't grow
[34:19.260 --> 34:20.820]  as fast as their body.
[34:20.820 --> 34:22.500]  Their breasts are bigger than everything else
[34:22.500 --> 34:24.580]  because that's what we want on the grocery store shelves,
[34:24.580 --> 34:25.420]  bigger breasts.
[34:25.420 --> 34:26.480]  Why do we have bigger breasts?
[34:26.480 --> 34:29.900]  Well, all the chicken places have what?
[34:29.900 --> 34:31.220]  Breast meat.
[34:31.220 --> 34:34.700]  And so we bred these, we call them piranhas,
[34:34.700 --> 34:35.900]  because like in the morning, whenever you're like,
[34:35.900 --> 34:36.740]  oh, they're piranhas.
[34:36.740 --> 34:37.980]  All they wanna do is eat.
[34:38.420 --> 34:40.100]  And their poop smells completely different
[34:40.100 --> 34:42.220]  than any other chicken poop.
[34:42.220 --> 34:45.040]  And I'm convinced there's something there.
[34:46.300 --> 34:48.100]  Anyway, put these chickens in.
[34:48.100 --> 34:50.620]  We grew six of them in our backyard just to see.
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.420]  And at eight weeks, they barely could walk.
[34:52.420 --> 34:54.220]  They looked like a lot of Americans trying to walk
[34:54.220 --> 34:56.500]  in and out of a grocery store, just waddling.
[34:56.500 --> 34:57.340]  Their hips hurt.
[34:57.340 --> 35:00.300]  And I'm not like, I used to weigh 330 pounds, man.
[35:00.300 --> 35:01.660]  I weigh 195 now.
[35:01.660 --> 35:04.620]  Like I was destined to waddle,
[35:04.620 --> 35:07.340]  and it wasn't because really I didn't want to
[35:07.860 --> 35:08.780]  or that my genetics weren't there.
[35:08.780 --> 35:12.820]  It's just, I'm not meant to eat the shit that Babylon eats.
[35:12.820 --> 35:13.980]  No thanks.
[35:13.980 --> 35:15.180]  It doesn't work for me.
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.660]  Anyway, I'm trailing off.
[35:18.660 --> 35:19.940]  Please catch me.
[35:19.940 --> 35:21.580]  No, I thought that was, I mean,
[35:21.580 --> 35:23.860]  you dropping those gold bars and then saying
[35:23.860 --> 35:26.460]  that you weighed 330 pounds.
[35:26.460 --> 35:28.940]  I mean, that's quite an accomplishment.
[35:28.940 --> 35:31.540]  Alay, you wanna kinda jump in there, bud?
[35:31.540 --> 35:33.900]  Oh, there's just so much.
[35:33.900 --> 35:35.900]  I don't even know where to fucking start.
[35:36.900 --> 35:38.700]  Yeah, I don't think enough people think
[35:38.700 --> 35:41.660]  about what goes in, what comes out.
[35:41.660 --> 35:44.700]  And I think that you're kind of exemplifying
[35:44.700 --> 35:46.860]  the diversity of that.
[35:46.860 --> 35:51.740]  You can feed these chickens all kinds of different things,
[35:51.740 --> 35:52.940]  and the same with the pigs.
[35:52.940 --> 35:56.580]  And so you can change what's coming out the back end
[35:56.580 --> 35:58.260]  based on what you put in front of them.
[35:58.260 --> 36:00.140]  And the biochar one, fuck.
[36:00.140 --> 36:04.860]  Dude, yeah, man, these guys need diversity too.
[36:05.180 --> 36:07.700]  And we just feed the same thing all the time
[36:07.700 --> 36:09.460]  instead of giving them the opportunity
[36:09.460 --> 36:12.460]  to choose what they want when they want it.
[36:13.500 --> 36:18.500]  The duck fucking inoculant pond, spot on, dude, spot on.
[36:18.700 --> 36:22.180]  That is the most amazing biological inoculant.
[36:22.180 --> 36:27.180]  And whether it's aquatic microorganisms or terrestrial,
[36:27.500 --> 36:29.060]  they don't fucking matter.
[36:29.060 --> 36:30.300]  They're the same.
[36:30.300 --> 36:33.340]  And people think that they're different, but they're not.
[36:33.340 --> 36:38.340]  So another great way for somebody to share,
[36:38.900 --> 36:42.220]  take that water, bottle it, send it to a friend,
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.860]  give it to your neighbor's farm.
[36:45.140 --> 36:49.340]  Share the way nature used to do it for us.
[36:49.340 --> 36:52.420]  Nature used to have mass migrations of animals.
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.980]  They did all that for us.
[36:53.980 --> 36:58.100]  They naturally constantly was putting more and more
[36:58.100 --> 37:00.900]  inoculants and biostimulants into play
[37:01.340 --> 37:03.780]  for the existing microbes that were there,
[37:03.780 --> 37:04.940]  present in that environment.
[37:04.940 --> 37:06.700]  And that doesn't happen anymore.
[37:06.700 --> 37:09.860]  But you just gave the audience a great way
[37:09.860 --> 37:11.380]  to create that diversity.
[37:11.380 --> 37:14.580]  One person in the neighborhood have ducks
[37:14.580 --> 37:17.060]  and let everybody come and get five gallons
[37:17.060 --> 37:18.620]  of that water once a week.
[37:18.620 --> 37:20.180]  And because they're a machine,
[37:20.180 --> 37:22.820]  they're not gonna fucking stop producing that stuff.
[37:22.820 --> 37:27.740]  So think about how powerful of an opportunity
[37:27.740 --> 37:31.260]  that you would have to help transition the soils
[37:31.260 --> 37:35.740]  or the dirts back into soils, biodiversity soils.
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.980]  And that's what's gonna fucking save the planet.
[37:37.980 --> 37:40.340]  That's the only fucking thing that's left.
[37:40.340 --> 37:43.340]  If we don't fix our fucking soils, forget it, we're done.
[37:44.500 --> 37:48.420]  Microbes build biofilms that prevent erosion, clean water.
[37:48.420 --> 37:50.380]  I mean, I could just go on and on and on,
[37:50.380 --> 37:53.380]  but that was one hell of a fucking gold bar.
[37:53.380 --> 37:57.340]  And I pray to God that this community listens to that one,
[37:57.940 --> 37:59.740]  because again, one person can do it
[37:59.740 --> 38:01.860]  and everybody can benefit from it.
[38:01.860 --> 38:03.660]  I mean, this whole community is about sharing.
[38:03.660 --> 38:06.460]  What a great fucking share that would be, right?
[38:06.460 --> 38:07.900]  So I'll sit back,
[38:07.900 --> 38:10.380]  because dude, you're fucking popping my cork
[38:10.380 --> 38:11.380]  with all this good knowledge.
[38:11.380 --> 38:13.620]  And the turp thing with the fucking,
[38:13.620 --> 38:16.460]  putting your wash water into the fucking compost,
[38:17.580 --> 38:20.460]  another one, dude, just another bomb, fucking.
[38:22.700 --> 38:26.100]  I don't know if we're going from PG to R
[38:26.100 --> 38:28.300]  with Leighton getting his pork cork popped.
[38:29.340 --> 38:31.100]  Just these two pictures,
[38:31.100 --> 38:33.140]  is this the pond you guys are talking about?
[38:33.140 --> 38:36.100]  So this picture here is a swale.
[38:36.100 --> 38:39.020]  Our property was part of the Dust Bowl.
[38:39.020 --> 38:40.060]  Like we're right on the edge
[38:40.060 --> 38:41.380]  of whenever the Dust Bowl happened.
[38:41.380 --> 38:45.900]  And part of that recovery was the NRCS,
[38:45.900 --> 38:48.500]  National Resource Conservation Services,
[38:48.500 --> 38:51.180]  or whatever the government acronym is for it.
[38:51.180 --> 38:53.460]  They came through and they cut terraces
[38:53.460 --> 38:55.580]  all across this part of the country.
[38:56.100 --> 38:56.980]  And so when we got on our property,
[38:56.980 --> 38:58.660]  we noticed that there was some terracing
[38:58.660 --> 39:00.740]  that basically was gone.
[39:00.740 --> 39:02.700]  I mean, there is two foot of difference
[39:02.700 --> 39:06.260]  between part of my property that was in woods for 60 years
[39:06.260 --> 39:08.300]  and part of my property that's been in grass.
[39:08.300 --> 39:11.900]  There's two foot of topsoil that's been lost.
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.980]  And so the terraces at the bottom,
[39:13.980 --> 39:15.820]  yep, the terraces towards the bottom
[39:15.820 --> 39:18.500]  have actually collected some of that silt.
[39:18.500 --> 39:20.740]  We've taken, so that water that you saw there,
[39:20.740 --> 39:23.180]  I actually took some of those swales,
[39:23.180 --> 39:25.340]  I just call them swales, not terraces,
[39:26.100 --> 39:27.020]  I've taken those swales and I've been digging out
[39:27.020 --> 39:28.260]  to just hold more water.
[39:29.220 --> 39:31.940]  There's a pond in the trees that I collect water
[39:31.940 --> 39:34.420]  that looks just like this in the spring.
[39:34.420 --> 39:36.500]  So I came to the hustle and educate.
[39:36.500 --> 39:38.820]  Shout out to KNF Gardener.
[39:38.820 --> 39:39.860]  Him and I were just talking
[39:39.860 --> 39:41.580]  and I came to the hustle and educate in Tulsa,
[39:41.580 --> 39:45.740]  that Brian that you put on with Marco and everyone.
[39:45.740 --> 39:50.500]  And I was having problems with leaf spot on my plants,
[39:50.500 --> 39:51.900]  leaf septora.
[39:51.900 --> 39:54.980]  And I know that a lot of KNF guys have that same issue.
[39:55.940 --> 39:56.780]  And that was brought up, it was like,
[39:56.780 --> 39:57.620]  hey, there's this issue.
[39:57.620 --> 39:59.860]  And Brandon Russ was coming at it with science,
[39:59.860 --> 40:01.620]  which is great, we need that.
[40:01.620 --> 40:03.900]  But a lot of the science has followed up
[40:03.900 --> 40:05.540]  with this product or that product.
[40:05.540 --> 40:07.220]  And it wasn't him trying to sell product,
[40:07.220 --> 40:11.020]  he was just like, these are our answers with our tool set.
[40:11.020 --> 40:14.580]  And I looked at it and said, I don't wanna buy humics.
[40:14.580 --> 40:16.300]  I don't wanna bring anything on my property.
[40:16.300 --> 40:18.180]  Yep, perfect.
[40:18.180 --> 40:20.340]  I don't wanna bring anything on my property.
[40:20.340 --> 40:22.280]  But I need to fix this issue.
[40:22.280 --> 40:24.180]  And so using labs in the morning
[40:24.180 --> 40:26.260]  helped adjust the pH on the leaf surface.
[40:26.260 --> 40:27.320]  So that helped.
[40:27.320 --> 40:30.580]  I would spray a Korean Natural Farming,
[40:30.580 --> 40:31.540]  like a maintenance solution.
[40:31.540 --> 40:32.700]  I'd spray that early in the morning.
[40:32.700 --> 40:34.860]  Everything was dewy for like two and a half months
[40:34.860 --> 40:35.700]  to spray.
[40:35.700 --> 40:38.140]  Every morning, everything was just drenched.
[40:38.140 --> 40:42.180]  And KNF Gardener said, humics, let's do humics.
[40:42.180 --> 40:43.940]  That's your solution.
[40:43.940 --> 40:47.380]  It was like, okay, but I don't wanna mix anything.
[40:47.380 --> 40:50.140]  And so it was like, how do I find these on my property?
[40:51.300 --> 40:53.820]  Every time it rained an inch, that pond filled up.
[40:54.660 --> 40:55.700]  That area filled up.
[40:55.700 --> 40:59.540]  It's about a fifth of an acre,
[40:59.540 --> 41:01.500]  maybe a quarter of an acre area.
[41:01.500 --> 41:03.100]  And it'd fill up and then it would run out
[41:03.100 --> 41:04.660]  because it's filled up with silt.
[41:04.660 --> 41:06.300]  And so the runoff isn't that,
[41:06.300 --> 41:09.060]  the area where it runs off isn't that deep.
[41:09.060 --> 41:11.100]  So I went over there and I spent three hours
[41:11.100 --> 41:14.080]  and built a dam and started collecting that.
[41:14.080 --> 41:16.860]  And before I knew it, I had close to 400,000 gallons
[41:16.860 --> 41:20.500]  based on my calculations worth of humic acid water.
[41:20.500 --> 41:22.180]  Like, oh, come on.
[41:22.180 --> 41:24.780]  And it comes off of a hill that I own.
[41:24.780 --> 41:26.860]  So there's nothing funny coming into it.
[41:26.860 --> 41:31.860]  It's two acres of forest floor that are soaking up water.
[41:32.420 --> 41:34.640]  And then that's running and it's hitting the clay layer
[41:34.640 --> 41:36.300]  that's down below.
[41:36.300 --> 41:38.060]  And it's hitting that and it's running right on top
[41:38.060 --> 41:39.380]  of that clay layer under the soil.
[41:39.380 --> 41:41.740]  And then it's filling up that pond.
[41:41.740 --> 41:46.060]  And it's that same looking, same tea-like color.
[41:46.060 --> 41:48.100]  And it was like, oh, we're gonna add that to the Hugo bed.
[41:48.100 --> 41:50.420]  So I was adding five gallons, five to 10 gallons.
[41:50.460 --> 41:52.620]  Just walk out in the pond, dunk a five gallon bucket in,
[41:52.620 --> 41:54.580]  go put it on my Hugo bed.
[41:54.580 --> 41:57.240]  I have a 21 foot Hugo bed that I'm working with.
[41:57.240 --> 41:58.460]  Put it on that Hugo bed.
[41:58.460 --> 42:00.700]  And I did that every day for about a week and a half.
[42:00.700 --> 42:04.140]  And all the new stuff didn't fight, at least not.
[42:04.140 --> 42:06.020]  And there were some that did.
[42:06.020 --> 42:09.100]  Again, that goes back to breeding for your region.
[42:09.100 --> 42:10.900]  Some things just hate life.
[42:10.900 --> 42:13.620]  Kims, good luck in Oklahoma.
[42:13.620 --> 42:16.100]  Kim 91s this year just bit the dust.
[42:17.220 --> 42:18.820]  I had one that was a big bad wolf,
[42:18.820 --> 42:20.900]  which is Kim 91 crossed with Kim D.
[42:20.900 --> 42:22.860]  Both of those are done by CSI Humboldt,
[42:22.860 --> 42:25.700]  an incredible breeder, an incredible breeder.
[42:25.700 --> 42:28.900]  Does good work, solid work, and works it out.
[42:28.900 --> 42:31.260]  And he told me, I reached out to him.
[42:31.260 --> 42:32.820]  I was like, hey, what's gonna do best?
[42:32.820 --> 42:35.740]  He's like, they're not gonna like the human temps,
[42:35.740 --> 42:36.940]  but see what you got.
[42:36.940 --> 42:40.100]  I was like, okay, pop the seed and see what we had.
[42:40.100 --> 42:41.540]  And it fought it all year.
[42:41.540 --> 42:42.940]  Will I breed with those plants?
[42:42.940 --> 42:45.660]  No, they're just not for here.
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.660]  And that's okay.
[42:46.660 --> 42:48.180]  There's plenty of states in the US
[42:48.540 --> 42:50.060]  that are gonna be able to grow Kims
[42:50.060 --> 42:51.860]  a million times better than anyone in Oklahoma.
[42:51.860 --> 42:52.700]  That's fine.
[42:54.220 --> 42:56.820]  Anyway, I don't know where you wanna go from there.
[42:59.060 --> 43:00.020]  There's a lot of ways, man.
[43:00.020 --> 43:02.260]  I have a lot of little things we can talk about.
[43:02.260 --> 43:04.380]  Kind of getting back to the chickens
[43:04.380 --> 43:05.500]  and that kind of thing,
[43:05.500 --> 43:08.700]  so that more people maybe wanna get into this or with ducks.
[43:08.700 --> 43:10.340]  From what I understand when the duck,
[43:10.340 --> 43:12.700]  or I'm sorry, when the chicken laid the egg,
[43:12.700 --> 43:14.940]  it doesn't need to be refrigerated.
[43:16.020 --> 43:17.880]  And can we kind of go into why that is?
[43:18.580 --> 43:21.080]  Because obviously if you go to the supermarket,
[43:21.080 --> 43:22.900]  it's always refrigerated.
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.540]  Oh man, I'm gonna really mess y'all up
[43:28.540 --> 43:29.920]  whenever it comes to food.
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.800]  Yeah, and feel free to give us the long form version
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.480]  of the American food system with chicken and eggs.
[43:39.400 --> 43:41.280]  The chicken or the egg, right?
[43:41.280 --> 43:42.640]  We got time.
[43:42.640 --> 43:43.680]  What's first?
[43:43.680 --> 43:45.600]  Capitalism came first.
[43:45.600 --> 43:47.880]  Not the chicken or the egg, capitalism.
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.280]  No, I, okay, so the reason a chicken lays an egg
[43:55.920 --> 43:59.720]  and a chicken will take and collect eggs for a week or two
[43:59.720 --> 44:01.340]  to make what's a clutch.
[44:01.340 --> 44:03.760]  And then they sit on that and they hatch it.
[44:04.800 --> 44:08.200]  21 days later, little things come out of the eggs.
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.320]  And how do you think those eggs are okay?
[44:12.320 --> 44:15.440]  I mean, nature's made it that way for a reason.
[44:16.280 --> 44:17.120]  So we take our eggs,
[44:17.120 --> 44:18.560]  we don't refrigerate any of our eggs here at the house.
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.200]  We just take them, we put them on a bowl,
[44:20.200 --> 44:21.720]  they're on the counter.
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.120]  Duck eggs, chicken eggs, same thing.
[44:24.120 --> 44:25.560]  Reason why is because an egg,
[44:25.560 --> 44:27.920]  whenever it comes out, it's inoculated.
[44:27.920 --> 44:29.600]  So what's called a bloom,
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.520]  there's a bloom on the outside of an egg.
[44:31.520 --> 44:33.760]  I wish I had some eggs with me, I'd show you.
[44:33.760 --> 44:36.280]  And you can actually, you don't lick the egg,
[44:36.280 --> 44:37.200]  but like lick your finger
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.640]  and then rub your wet finger on the egg
[44:38.640 --> 44:40.660]  and you'll actually see it change a little bit of a color.
[44:40.660 --> 44:43.100]  That bloom is actually inoculant, that comes out.
[44:43.100 --> 44:45.300]  That's no different than a human being birthed.
[44:46.140 --> 44:46.980]  So a human being is born vaginally
[44:46.980 --> 44:48.260]  and getting that inoculation on their face
[44:48.260 --> 44:51.020]  whenever they first come into being.
[44:51.020 --> 44:52.700]  This is that same thing.
[44:52.700 --> 44:55.620]  That's there so that whenever that chick pecks that thing,
[44:55.620 --> 44:58.620]  it's getting inoculated to help its internal system
[44:58.620 --> 45:01.060]  once it's cracked and once it starts coming out.
[45:02.660 --> 45:04.820]  Eggs are safe on a counter.
[45:04.820 --> 45:07.620]  They allow air to go in and out
[45:07.620 --> 45:09.740]  and it's not a, they're porous.
[45:09.740 --> 45:10.740]  They're supposed to breathe.
[45:10.740 --> 45:13.300]  There's a living being in there.
[45:13.300 --> 45:16.120]  So whenever you buy eggs at a grocery store,
[45:17.420 --> 45:18.600]  your eggs are washed.
[45:20.180 --> 45:22.140]  They're washed in chlorine.
[45:22.140 --> 45:23.100]  They're sterilized.
[45:23.100 --> 45:24.580]  The outside's sterile.
[45:24.580 --> 45:26.660]  So whenever you start making water-soluble calcium
[45:26.660 --> 45:29.940]  and you use organic, the organic is not chlorine.
[45:29.940 --> 45:32.660]  They do another chemical I'm not so sure of.
[45:33.580 --> 45:34.860]  Or I don't know what the name is.
[45:34.860 --> 45:36.100]  I don't know if it's good or bad.
[45:36.100 --> 45:39.240]  I just don't, it doesn't matter to me really.
[45:40.900 --> 45:41.820]  They do it with that.
[45:41.860 --> 45:43.220]  So be aware of that.
[45:43.220 --> 45:44.700]  Whenever you're doing water-soluble calcium,
[45:44.700 --> 45:47.380]  you do want some microbes in that whole process.
[45:47.380 --> 45:48.940]  That's why I use apple cider vinegar
[45:48.940 --> 45:51.500]  to dissolve my egg shells down
[45:51.500 --> 45:52.540]  because there's a mother in that
[45:52.540 --> 45:55.060]  plus I'm able to get an organic vinegar
[45:55.060 --> 45:57.100]  as opposed to brown rice vinegar at the local Walmart.
[45:57.100 --> 45:58.860]  There's no organic in there.
[46:00.940 --> 46:03.620]  Anyway, the egg, whenever you wash it,
[46:03.620 --> 46:05.020]  it removes that coating.
[46:05.020 --> 46:08.040]  Now things can go into the egg and out of the egg
[46:08.040 --> 46:10.960]  like E. coli or salmonella, whatever,
[46:10.960 --> 46:13.320]  whatever things you don't want in an egg that's there.
[46:13.320 --> 46:15.220]  So you have to keep them refrigerated.
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.400]  Milk has to be pasteurized
[46:18.400 --> 46:21.020]  because of greed and a broken system.
[46:21.020 --> 46:23.600]  Eggs have to be cleaned and washed and refrigerated
[46:23.600 --> 46:25.600]  because of a broken system.
[46:25.600 --> 46:28.000]  And the broken system allows four to six
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.640]  to eight big companies to run the whole damn show.
[46:31.640 --> 46:34.040]  If you drink milk from a grocery store,
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.540]  over 20% of that milk is utter pus.
[46:37.540 --> 46:39.640]  That's not a cow problem.
[46:39.640 --> 46:41.560]  That's because of the process.
[46:41.560 --> 46:43.480]  It's because they put them on these huge carousels,
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.480]  500 cattle in a freaking big massive circle carousel,
[46:48.520 --> 46:49.360]  exactly what you think.
[46:49.360 --> 46:51.280]  They load in on one side, they plug them in.
[46:51.280 --> 46:53.120]  By the time they get around to the other side,
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.360]  the cow's done milked, the milk's in the tank and sent off.
[46:57.240 --> 46:59.200]  I have family that own dairies.
[46:59.200 --> 47:01.560]  They wouldn't drink the milk out of their tanks.
[47:01.560 --> 47:04.480]  And that's because the whole system is so dirty and broken
[47:04.480 --> 47:05.600]  all the way up to that point.
[47:05.600 --> 47:08.040]  They have to pasteurize everything.
[47:08.040 --> 47:10.520]  And now we use words like ultra-pasteurize.
[47:10.520 --> 47:14.000]  Like, come on, why do we have to ultra anything?
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.440]  Like people are drinking raw milk all the time.
[47:16.440 --> 47:18.520]  You know, I've heard it put this way by a birthing coach.
[47:18.520 --> 47:21.280]  She said, women are having babies in jungles all the time.
[47:21.280 --> 47:22.880]  What are you nervous about?
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.160]  It's like, same thing.
[47:24.160 --> 47:26.120]  People eat eggs all the time that aren't refrigerated
[47:26.120 --> 47:29.060]  or cleaned or passed through any kind of USDA inspection.
[47:31.080 --> 47:35.760]  It's so fucked up.
[47:35.880 --> 47:39.720]  I don't even, it's not normal, just not.
[47:39.720 --> 47:41.760]  And I know a lot of people,
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.260]  they need to kind of see this stuff for themselves visually.
[47:44.260 --> 47:45.600]  So they might not be able to go out
[47:45.600 --> 47:46.720]  and get chickens right away.
[47:46.720 --> 47:48.320]  So I feel like one of the easier ways
[47:48.320 --> 47:51.200]  to maybe see this for yourself is buy some Walmart eggs,
[47:51.200 --> 47:52.760]  the cheapest you can find,
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.520]  and then get some pasture raised, same marketplace.
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.560]  And then go home and crack both of those open
[47:58.560 --> 47:59.600]  and look at the difference.
[47:59.600 --> 48:01.720]  And then I feel like you'll, if you can,
[48:01.720 --> 48:03.760]  you're gonna reach out to people like Andy
[48:03.760 --> 48:06.040]  or other individuals at farmers markets,
[48:06.040 --> 48:08.160]  that kind of stuff that are having eggs
[48:08.160 --> 48:09.480]  where they don't have to be refrigerated
[48:09.480 --> 48:12.760]  because the nutrient content that you can see in the yolk
[48:12.760 --> 48:16.000]  is drastically different compared to that Walmart egg.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.160]  Huge, huge.
[48:18.160 --> 48:19.400]  Don't forget the taste.
[48:20.360 --> 48:21.600]  It tastes so much better.
[48:23.480 --> 48:25.480]  Here's a little gold nugget for you cookers.
[48:25.480 --> 48:28.360]  Duck eggs, keep your cakes fluffier.
[48:28.360 --> 48:31.000]  Duck eggs, if you use like a one to three ratio,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.720]  duck eggs to regular eggs in your French toast,
[48:34.560 --> 48:35.800]  it keeps that French toast fluffy.
[48:37.280 --> 48:38.120]  Yeah.
[48:40.240 --> 48:42.640]  Now when it comes to the birds and that kind of stuff,
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.120]  the ducks, the chickens, the pecking order,
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.280]  like do you as like the king feeder to the flock,
[48:50.280 --> 48:52.120]  do you have to abide by that as well?
[48:52.120 --> 48:53.800]  Like, are you kind of like interacting
[48:53.800 --> 48:55.920]  with the boss every day or how?
[48:56.840 --> 48:58.520]  I have to interact sometime.
[48:58.520 --> 48:59.360]  Right.
[48:59.360 --> 49:00.200]  I got thumped, man.
[49:00.200 --> 49:01.200]  I stuck my hand down.
[49:01.200 --> 49:03.680]  I wasn't paying attention and our rooster Winston, man,
[49:04.520 --> 49:05.360]  he just worked me over.
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.040]  Like he latched on right here and thumped me so many times.
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.840]  Felt like the kid that got like sucker punched.
[49:12.840 --> 49:14.320]  As far as pecking order and stuff,
[49:14.320 --> 49:15.600]  animals do it all the time.
[49:15.600 --> 49:16.760]  They figure it out.
[49:16.760 --> 49:19.200]  What we're dealing with now on our property is,
[49:19.200 --> 49:20.480]  I want to suggest this for people.
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.920]  If you're in town and you want to have chickens,
[49:22.920 --> 49:24.640]  I highly suggest it.
[49:24.640 --> 49:27.760]  Get like a barred rock, which is a heritage breed.
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.160]  A barred rock or a buff Orpington
[49:32.160 --> 49:33.920]  are really good breeds as well.
[49:33.920 --> 49:35.200]  Silkies.
[49:35.200 --> 49:36.320]  So I sent some pictures.
[49:36.320 --> 49:37.720]  They're the fluffy, we call them the Muppets.
[49:37.720 --> 49:39.760]  My wife says they all look like Jim Henson characters.
[49:39.760 --> 49:41.520]  So she names them after the Muppets.
[49:42.760 --> 49:44.120]  They don't really fly.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.560]  And so they're really docile.
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.400]  They're chill.
[49:47.400 --> 49:48.600]  They lay a smaller egg.
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.360]  They're perfect for people in town.
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.440]  The roosters crow with silkies.
[49:53.440 --> 49:54.560]  They'll crow in the middle of the night,
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.440]  but the crow isn't as loud.
[49:56.440 --> 49:59.280]  We had some rooster silkies in town.
[49:59.280 --> 50:01.080]  When the pecking order gets messed up,
[50:01.120 --> 50:03.800]  it's just what happens in our world
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.280]  whenever there's too many roosters.
[50:07.280 --> 50:09.140]  And whenever there's too many roosters,
[50:09.140 --> 50:11.200]  like now we bred a bunch of silkies this spring,
[50:11.200 --> 50:12.960]  we bought some silkies and they've come up
[50:12.960 --> 50:15.320]  and you can't tell if they're a male or a female
[50:15.320 --> 50:18.380]  for quite some time until they usually crow at you.
[50:18.380 --> 50:20.120]  And now we've got too many roosters.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.960]  So we sort through the roosters.
[50:21.960 --> 50:23.040]  My wife's very picky.
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.200]  She only picks the roosters that are nice and docile.
[50:26.200 --> 50:27.400]  If they're not nice and docile,
[50:27.400 --> 50:29.080]  she doesn't want to carry that into our eggs.
[50:29.080 --> 50:30.760]  We're going to sell eggs for breeding and stuff.
[50:31.440 --> 50:34.580]  So if people want to get into it, reach out to us.
[50:34.580 --> 50:35.640]  I do want to say this,
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.440]  our farm name is different from our cannabis farm name.
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.440]  Our farm name is Dandy Hill Farm.
[50:42.440 --> 50:47.300]  So my wife's name is Danielle and my wife's name is Danielle.
[50:47.300 --> 50:48.140]  My name's Andy.
[50:48.140 --> 50:50.600]  Together we're on a hill and it's a dandy hill.
[50:50.600 --> 50:52.560]  So that's where we came with that.
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.440]  And that shows more of the farming aspect
[50:54.440 --> 50:56.000]  of everything that we do
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.340]  and just kind of our interaction there.
[50:58.340 --> 50:59.680]  So whenever you get too many roosters,
[50:59.680 --> 51:00.720]  you start having issues.
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.880]  And some of those roosters will straight up kill each other.
[51:03.880 --> 51:07.120]  And so you just have to, observation's key.
[51:07.120 --> 51:09.300]  You have to understand what they're doing.
[51:09.300 --> 51:11.040]  You have to understand why they're fighting.
[51:11.040 --> 51:13.800]  There's all this, it's not necessarily the chicken fault.
[51:13.800 --> 51:15.280]  The chicken's just being a chicken.
[51:15.280 --> 51:17.120]  The rooster's just being a rooster.
[51:17.120 --> 51:19.640]  I think that every flock needs a good rooster.
[51:19.640 --> 51:23.680]  10 to 12 hens per rooster's about even.
[51:23.680 --> 51:26.680]  If you get 20 or 30 hens and you've only got one rooster,
[51:26.680 --> 51:29.000]  there's not enough of that stud muffin to go around.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.600]  So you gotta spread out the love a little bit.
[51:31.600 --> 51:34.140]  If there's too many roosters, they're fighting.
[51:35.240 --> 51:37.000]  And so that helps with the pecking order.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.280]  With geese, geese can be aggressive,
[51:39.280 --> 51:41.920]  but as long as you're chill with them,
[51:41.920 --> 51:44.320]  especially whenever they're little babes,
[51:44.320 --> 51:47.420]  it works a lot better whenever they're little goslings.
[51:48.600 --> 51:51.280]  Ducks, ducks are probably the funnest little creatures
[51:51.280 --> 51:52.440]  to ever work with.
[51:52.440 --> 51:55.480]  Peter put up a picture, it looks kind of like compost.
[51:55.480 --> 51:57.520]  I wanted to touch this on ducks.
[51:57.520 --> 52:00.280]  We took our duckling bedding.
[52:00.280 --> 52:02.820]  So we raised ducks for some local restaurants here.
[52:02.820 --> 52:04.040]  They're just called Pekin ducks.
[52:04.040 --> 52:05.400]  They're just white ducks.
[52:05.400 --> 52:07.800]  And we raised them for a local farm to table restaurant.
[52:07.800 --> 52:11.720]  So we had close to 70 ducklings in our brooder
[52:11.720 --> 52:13.540]  and we got a meadow hay.
[52:13.540 --> 52:15.240]  So a lot of the ranchers and stuff
[52:15.240 --> 52:17.840]  will just cut their meadows down and then bale it up.
[52:17.840 --> 52:20.200]  It's clean hay, we just brought it in and put it in there.
[52:20.200 --> 52:22.720]  What we noticed rather quick was all those little ducklings
[52:22.720 --> 52:25.080]  use so much water and they poop, poop, poop like crazy.
[52:25.080 --> 52:28.240]  And that brooder is not, it's not sitting on the ground.
[52:29.900 --> 52:33.160]  He was making a mat, like a swamp cooler mat.
[52:33.160 --> 52:36.200]  So I was like, oh, we need to, what could I do with this?
[52:36.200 --> 52:38.240]  So we were done with the brooder after five weeks.
[52:38.240 --> 52:40.320]  We put the ducks out on pasture
[52:40.320 --> 52:42.640]  and then we pulled the brooder out of our shipping container
[52:42.640 --> 52:45.300]  and we left it out in the sun and let all that dry out.
[52:45.300 --> 52:48.360]  And then I took IMO and a bunch of my aerated compost teas
[52:48.360 --> 52:51.280]  that I have, and I would just take some jugs out of those
[52:51.280 --> 52:54.400]  in this past spring and just put it on the brooder
[52:54.400 --> 52:55.920]  and let it all dry.
[52:55.920 --> 52:58.360]  When I understand a lot of that microbe life
[52:58.360 --> 52:59.480]  is just sifting up.
[52:59.480 --> 53:02.600]  So it's going, oh, well, it's dry in Oklahoma.
[53:02.600 --> 53:04.120]  This happens every year.
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.040]  Let's just hold tight.
[53:06.040 --> 53:09.000]  And so I just kept on inoculating.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.600]  Then I took that mat because it was dry
[53:11.600 --> 53:13.800]  and I was able to take that mat in these squares
[53:13.800 --> 53:15.840]  and just lay them on top of my hugel bed.
[53:17.080 --> 53:21.440]  Within a month, man, I think I've got a pill bug problem.
[53:21.440 --> 53:23.240]  I have so many of those things in there,
[53:23.240 --> 53:24.560]  just working it over.
[53:24.560 --> 53:25.900]  You can like pill it up and see.
[53:25.900 --> 53:29.640]  I'm some of my, one of my bioreactor things,
[53:29.640 --> 53:31.120]  I just took a big clump out of it.
[53:31.120 --> 53:35.280]  And it was probably a thousand little pill bugs
[53:35.280 --> 53:38.280]  on the backside, roly polies, just munching through it.
[53:39.240 --> 53:41.360]  Again, just using what we have on the farm.
[53:41.360 --> 53:42.180]  I'm just thinking like,
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.480]  what would my ancestors do a hundred years ago?
[53:45.640 --> 53:49.720]  They didn't go to grow gin and pick up the latest,
[53:49.720 --> 53:53.140]  greatest from, you know, tough Mike.
[53:53.980 --> 53:55.100]  Look at that guy.
[53:55.100 --> 53:56.480]  Like he's about to pop too.
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.540]  Like he's drinking way too much Budswell.
[53:59.580 --> 54:01.220]  Most people want their buds to look like
[54:01.220 --> 54:03.120]  half the guys walking out of GNC.
[54:03.120 --> 54:03.960]  I don't.
[54:05.540 --> 54:06.360]  Not this guy.
[54:07.660 --> 54:11.300]  Anyway, so that's kind of the thing with chickens.
[54:11.300 --> 54:13.420]  And I suggest anyone get chickens.
[54:13.420 --> 54:14.380]  In town, get them.
[54:14.380 --> 54:17.900]  Most towns like Tulsa, they changed it from six to 12.
[54:17.900 --> 54:20.060]  You could have 12 and then you could have a rooster.
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.720]  And now rumor has it is you can have a goat or two.
[54:22.720 --> 54:24.960]  Like do it.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.560]  Treat your backyard right.
[54:26.560 --> 54:29.120]  Don't be part of the 40 million acres in America
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.040]  that's devoted to lawns.
[54:31.040 --> 54:32.840]  Or the other 40 million acres in America
[54:32.840 --> 54:35.040]  that's devoted to recreational horse grazing.
[54:35.040 --> 54:37.440]  No, sorry, 30 million and 30 million.
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.840]  60 total to just foolery.
[54:40.840 --> 54:41.660]  Why?
[54:42.920 --> 54:44.780]  Now, are you allowing these animals
[54:44.780 --> 54:46.880]  to like work things out themselves?
[54:46.880 --> 54:49.020]  Are you, you know, with the pecking order,
[54:49.020 --> 54:50.880]  like if there are too many roosters,
[54:50.880 --> 54:52.520]  you kind of just let them figure it out
[54:53.320 --> 54:54.560]  and then you have a stronger rooster
[54:54.560 --> 54:57.400]  because that one's been either kicking everybody's ass
[54:57.400 --> 55:00.560]  or I would imagine killing the other ones as well.
[55:00.560 --> 55:03.700]  And then at that point, like I know you can use pill bugs
[55:03.700 --> 55:05.520]  to break down a lot of proteins and stuff.
[55:05.520 --> 55:08.360]  So have you experimented with like using
[55:08.360 --> 55:11.120]  protein heavy isopods to continue to break down?
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.780]  You can even do like shedding and that kind of stuff.
[55:14.780 --> 55:18.120]  And then are you, have you noticed like using the chickens
[55:18.120 --> 55:22.200]  and the ducks, I know they love to eat the isopods
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.380]  and the same thing, pill bugs.
[55:26.760 --> 55:29.600]  Yeah, so my wife walked in
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.600]  and it kind of distracted me a little bit.
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.240]  The pill bugs as far as chickens and ducks in the spring,
[55:35.240 --> 55:36.760]  if I have too much of an issue with them,
[55:36.760 --> 55:39.240]  I'm gonna put the ducks in all of our hugel beds.
[55:39.240 --> 55:41.500]  My buddy that did Oklahoma Kush Collective,
[55:41.500 --> 55:43.560]  the guy that did those ducks in the backyard,
[55:43.560 --> 55:46.120]  like he sold me on the idea.
[55:46.120 --> 55:47.840]  I'm like, oh yeah, we're putting blue pools
[55:47.840 --> 55:49.360]  in the hugel mounds this year.
[55:49.360 --> 55:51.560]  This coming spring, I'll be commercial here in Oklahoma.
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.400]  So I'll be able to have more than my six plants,
[55:54.400 --> 55:55.920]  my wife's six plants.
[55:55.920 --> 55:58.120]  And so we're gonna do 500 feet of hugel bed
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.440]  and I'm gonna drag those pools through there
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.520]  and just continue to inoculate as far as that.
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.360]  And then they'll pick through
[56:10.360 --> 56:11.940]  and they'll work those pill bugs through.
[56:11.940 --> 56:13.200]  And they do, they shed a lot.
[56:13.200 --> 56:14.380]  That's something that I've noticed is,
[56:14.380 --> 56:17.080]  so there's all the titan from the pill bugs that are shedding
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.840]  and you're saying that they really eat on protein.
[56:18.840 --> 56:21.520]  There's probably a bunch of leftover feed that's in that
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.480]  because little ducklings are just messes.
[56:23.480 --> 56:25.520]  I mean, ducks are messes, period.
[56:25.520 --> 56:28.800]  The ones you see in your thing wouldn't break that down.
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.960]  So I know that there's potentials,
[56:30.960 --> 56:32.800]  you don't wanna put certain species in things,
[56:32.800 --> 56:35.040]  but there are different isopods
[56:35.040 --> 56:37.360]  that'll actually break down all of that.
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.600]  Once the animal died, they'll actually sit there
[56:39.600 --> 56:41.360]  and break down the proteins on it.
[56:41.360 --> 56:44.000]  So I was wondering, if you see, unfortunately,
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.220]  a chicken diet or a duck diet or something like that,
[56:46.220 --> 56:48.740]  are you going in there, throwing it in the compost bin?
[56:48.740 --> 56:50.000]  Are you interacting like that
[56:50.040 --> 56:52.680]  or are you just letting things naturally break down?
[56:54.240 --> 56:55.800]  That's a really good question, actually.
[56:55.800 --> 56:57.840]  So I'll answer it a couple of different ways.
[56:57.840 --> 56:59.640]  First, everything that we bring on our property
[56:59.640 --> 57:01.160]  stays on our property.
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.160]  And so with regulating the roosters,
[57:06.240 --> 57:07.440]  following up with what I was saying,
[57:07.440 --> 57:08.440]  I got a little bit sidetracked.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.400]  My wife will go through those roosters
[57:10.400 --> 57:12.560]  and if she sees some that are too aggressive,
[57:12.560 --> 57:13.640]  they're out of here.
[57:13.640 --> 57:15.820]  Like, we're selling them.
[57:15.820 --> 57:18.200]  They're usually pretty small and we wanted to be,
[57:18.200 --> 57:19.320]  we butchered a bunch of ducks.
[57:19.320 --> 57:22.080]  We butcher our animals here on the property
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.200]  and we just got tired of all the death.
[57:26.200 --> 57:30.040]  It's not that we won't do it for our own or our family
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.160]  or some neighbors and stuff that buy from us,
[57:33.160 --> 57:36.000]  but really we wanted it to be more of a property of life
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.600]  that life comes off of.
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.440]  So we're selling those roosters before they get too rowdy.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.040]  It is our duty to make sure
[57:44.040 --> 57:45.200]  that they're not killing each other.
[57:45.200 --> 57:47.480]  They're good genetics, they're good roosters,
[57:47.480 --> 57:48.880]  they're good animals.
[57:49.440 --> 57:50.880]  And I feel like roosters get a lot of a bad rap,
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.440]  especially these big hatcheries.
[57:52.440 --> 57:54.920]  Half of the birds that they hatch are roosters
[57:54.920 --> 57:56.660]  and no one wants roosters.
[57:56.660 --> 57:58.080]  So where are they going?
[57:58.080 --> 58:00.200]  Now I can answer that, but like, where are they going?
[58:00.200 --> 58:02.920]  And so with the roosters and stuff,
[58:02.920 --> 58:05.700]  we sell them off, people buy them,
[58:05.700 --> 58:07.040]  with if something dies.
[58:07.040 --> 58:09.680]  So a couple weeks ago we had a predator.
[58:09.680 --> 58:12.000]  A bobcat showed up on our property
[58:12.000 --> 58:12.920]  during the middle of the day,
[58:12.920 --> 58:14.320]  waited till the duck stuck its head.
[58:14.320 --> 58:16.740]  So we have these mesh fences.
[58:16.740 --> 58:18.200]  They're made by Premier One,
[58:18.520 --> 58:19.800]  and probably a picture that I sent to Peter
[58:19.800 --> 58:21.640]  has some of those white mesh fences,
[58:21.640 --> 58:22.520]  and they're electric.
[58:22.520 --> 58:25.320]  So they've got an energizer tied to them.
[58:25.320 --> 58:27.000]  And then that keeps our chickens in
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.600]  and it keeps predators out.
[58:29.680 --> 58:31.600]  This bobcat waited in the grass
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.000]  until this duck stuck its head through
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.160]  and then took that as an opportunity to finish the duck.
[58:36.160 --> 58:39.280]  In an incident like that with the ducks,
[58:39.280 --> 58:42.880]  we have pigs now, we would turn a duck into bacon
[58:44.400 --> 58:46.800]  because that's probably the best way to do it.
[58:47.640 --> 58:50.600]  Pigs are carnivores, they're just like us.
[58:50.600 --> 58:51.640]  So they'll eat everything.
[58:51.640 --> 58:52.680]  They'll eat the bones and everything.
[58:52.680 --> 58:54.960]  Whenever I make bone broth with the chicken,
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.200]  the bones are real brittle.
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.600]  I feed those, I mean, they're brittle.
[58:57.600 --> 58:59.800]  You can take them in your finger and go like that.
[58:59.800 --> 59:01.760]  I feed that all to my pigs
[59:01.760 --> 59:03.440]  because then that turns it into poop.
[59:03.440 --> 59:05.480]  That poop's caught in a deep bedding
[59:05.480 --> 59:07.480]  and then I'm able to put that on the property.
[59:07.480 --> 59:10.440]  So I am controlling that death.
[59:10.440 --> 59:14.440]  As far as like an animal that we,
[59:14.440 --> 59:16.680]  before we had pigs, what would we do with it?
[59:17.720 --> 59:21.560]  Before that, we would harvest as much as we could,
[59:21.560 --> 59:23.480]  put in the fridge and the other portion,
[59:23.480 --> 59:25.720]  I would take it down to the bottom of our hill
[59:25.720 --> 59:26.680]  where there's a creek bed
[59:26.680 --> 59:28.420]  and I would set it right next to the creek bed.
[59:28.420 --> 59:30.960]  We've got wild animals that run in there
[59:30.960 --> 59:33.640]  and the best advice I can give people for farms
[59:33.640 --> 59:35.240]  is if you keep as much distance
[59:35.240 --> 59:37.200]  between you and the wild animals
[59:37.200 --> 59:39.280]  and whenever they start showing up,
[59:39.280 --> 59:40.240]  it's because they're hungry.
[59:40.240 --> 59:42.840]  Something's messed with their routine.
[59:42.840 --> 59:45.800]  The bobcat showed up because it was hunting season
[59:45.800 --> 59:47.720]  and everyone was going into the woods
[59:47.720 --> 59:49.700]  and they were running the bobcats and the deer all over
[59:49.700 --> 59:51.680]  because all of a sudden we have all these deer on a property
[59:51.680 --> 59:53.860]  that we hadn't seen since last year.
[59:55.120 --> 59:57.080]  So just trying to understand nature
[59:57.080 --> 59:59.720]  and not being so kicked back on it.
[59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.880]  Yeah, the bobcat's a problem.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.160]  So we moved our netting further away from the trees
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.040]  to make him have to walk further out in the open.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.440]  For anyone that has animals
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.560]  and if you put them in your backyard,
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.060]  here's another little tip.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.300]  Walmart has these little solar panel lights
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.320]  that are motion sensor.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.620]  They're 10 bucks.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.660]  Put those on your coop.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.380]  At night, little raccoon comes walking by,
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.740]  wants to get an egg.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.360]  That light lights up and it usually either wakes you up
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.380]  or it runs them off.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.680]  They don't like it.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.340]  So that's how we deal with predators
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.780]  and then if there is predator problems with animals.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.940]  I also have black soldier fly larva.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.280]  I did a black soldier fly larva bin this spring.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.260]  Actually right before the Hustle and Educate.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.420]  It was gonna be a worm bin
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.620]  and then four days later I looked in there
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.660]  and it's covered in black soldier fly larva.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.060]  I reached out to Marco's Growing.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.340]  It's like, hey man, is this a problem?
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.220]  He's like, probably not.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.620]  I don't see why it would be
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.740]  as long as you've got enough dirt
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.500]  for those worms to not be right up against the soldier fly.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.660]  It should be cool.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.420]  And so that's been incredible.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.060]  So if there is some protein and stuff,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.060]  I'll put it in there but I try to keep that out.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.780]  I mean, I'm not a big fan of composting proteins
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.720]  or animal fats or anything like that.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.500]  I think there's a way and there's good ways to do it.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]  We really don't have to now.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.180]  We've got the biggest miracle on earth
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.620]  and that's the pig.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.040]  Turn anything into bacon.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.560]  What's not to love?
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.780]  It's not like Jim Gaffigan.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.340]  You know who that is?
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.100]  That dude has like a 10 minute skit on bacon.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.200]  Oh, that's all he gave to bacon?
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.020]  I mean, bacon deserves like hours of time.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.620]  If you've never heard that skit, man,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.420]  if you're making jokes about bacon,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.980]  it's probably the best skit you can come up with.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.780]  But when you're getting into bacon, like I was saying,
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.780]  I think some of the part that you brought up
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.220]  about the lab and the yogurt,
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.180]  that's from my son's mother's family.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.920]  They were really big and found ways
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.020]  to feed the animals cheaply
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.600]  and they made deals with a lot of the other farmers.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.580]  So they were going out of their way to get wasted yogurt,
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.300]  expired yogurt, that kind of stuff.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.900]  So if you are a pig farmer,
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.940]  I think you could maybe experiment with that.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.020]  I personally never tried it myself,
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.060]  but I've been on my son's uncle's farm
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.740]  and it's a beautiful place, man.
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.060]  You know, you think,
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.580]  especially when you look at pigs and think of pigs
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.100]  when they're not out there just kind of grazing,
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.220]  you always think it's disgusting.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:31.060]  But I would say, except for like on the inside pens,
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.260]  it was just like,
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.380]  they seemed like they had little personalities, you know,
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.780]  they were running around and checking you out,
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.460]  making sure that you weren't up to anything.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.980]  But the other thing that I saw though,
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.140]  when I was there, unfortunately,
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.240]  is it seems like the mothers, for whatever reason,
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.220]  when they've given birth,
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.940]  they're kind of disoriented maybe or something,
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.360]  and they'll lay down and kill the babies.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.700]  I always wondered about that.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.100]  So I'd love to talk to another pig farmer about that.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.780]  Yeah, I'm pretty far from a pig farmer,
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.540]  but I know what you're talking about.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.060]  And a lot of times people will put like a little stable
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.560]  where she can't roll on them just because she doesn't know.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.560]  She doesn't know there's 12 or 13 piglets around her
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.920]  and she weighs hundreds of pounds.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.600]  And she just like her job there is to just feed them.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.480]  And so they'll roll over on them, that happens.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.560]  And that's where like the modern day commercial ag
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.880]  farrowing pens where they're stuck in these
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.560]  God awful concrete metal cages.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.480]  And they're just meant to just pump out piglets
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.240]  for this machine.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.520]  I have friends who raise pigs and piglets in the woods,
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.960]  they farrow naturally.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.960]  So one of them, she'll say that her pigs,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.680]  Mangalisa is the name of the pigs.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.680]  And her pigs will go out, the sows will
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.240]  whenever they're pregnant and they're about to birth,
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.800]  and they'll go out in the woods and they'll birth.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.840]  And she's like, I've had to isolate the ones
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.300]  that rolled on the piglets and I've gotten rid of those.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.840]  And I don't have any problems now.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.920]  So there's some of that.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.280]  There's a gentleman out of Missouri named Greg Judy.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.400]  He's a pastured regenerative sheep and cattle farmer.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  And he has a herd of sheep, this is pretty unheard of,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.400]  that have no problems with worms.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.440]  No dewormers, no issues, but it's taken him 20 years
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.180]  of genetically isolating the ones that could take it.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.200]  And I think we've lost that in our pig,
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.640]  our commercial pig operation.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.400]  We've lost the pigness of the pig.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.240]  We put them in a cage, they can't use.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.520]  This right here on a pig is like a shovel.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.880]  Like they're a shovel on legs, man.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.080]  They just go dig shit up, let them root.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.960]  That's what they do.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.800]  Because we've got a bunch of acorns
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.660]  and walnuts in the trees.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.680]  And that's a food source.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.640]  And if I can get that going in the woods,
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.680]  I'm starting a whole nother regeneration cycle.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.800]  Now there's manure in the woods.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.480]  There hasn't been manure in the woods in,
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.680]  I don't know how long.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.440]  And now we're cycling that.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.280]  Because it's got three, four years of acorns
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.580]  that are just, it's just a layer.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.280]  And those acorns don't taste as good as bacon.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.660]  Again, back to bacon.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.280]  I can say pork chops, I can say ham, but like.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.480]  That's, smell and flies are due to mismanagement.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.960]  My pigs, yesterday I walked up to the pig,
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.320]  the little run that I have them in for now.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.280]  And I walked up to that run and I could smell their poop.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.560]  And the reason why I could smell their poop
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.100]  is because the corner, so pigs are really clean.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.560]  They actually poop in one corner.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.840]  They keep it all pretty localized.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.920]  And their poop hadn't been covered up that day.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.760]  And so I was just sitting there.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.680]  I saw some flies and smelled some poop.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.360]  So I went and got a gorilla cart full of mulch
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.160]  from our mulch piles and brought that wood chips in
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.280]  and just literally took a handful per poop
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.400]  and just threw it on top.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.600]  It wasn't perfectly covered or anything,
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.560]  but came back 30, 45 minutes later,
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.360]  flies were gone, there was no smell.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.520]  It's mismanagement.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.400]  Again, the confined animal feeding operations,
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.640]  all their issues is mismanagement.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.480]  You can't move in 800,000 pounds of corn
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.920]  and have that process through the four stomachs of cows
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.940]  and not expect there to be issues.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.200]  You just can't.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.240]  But we're like, oh, just enough heat or enough bleach
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.080]  and we're good.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.760]  We're good.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.680]  So anyway, I hope that helps with the pigs.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.720]  The fair wing, that's just something that happens.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.400]  They're just big ladies and that's just what happens.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.640]  And he was mentioning
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.160]  that you can't really separate them either.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.360]  So it's like the less of two evils
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.840]  is hopefully that she won't squish them.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.400]  So a lot of people take like just some boards
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.200]  where the piglets can come and go
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.880]  and where if the mom rolled on top,
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.840]  she wouldn't fall.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.640]  Basically a box, a wooden box,
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.480]  and they can run under and they can feed from there.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.640]  But if she rolls over, it doesn't hurt them.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.400]  It doesn't kill them.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.240]  And again, that's just management.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.200]  There's some people that do it through fence wall,
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.120]  like a fence, and then her teats come through the fence
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.960]  and then they feed on the other side.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.680]  It's preference.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.360]  If you wanted to let them be in the wild, you could.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.480]  There's wild pigs all over.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.320]  They breed like crazy.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.840]  One of the genetics in mine has wild hog in it.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.680]  You can see it.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.260]  The blonde one, she's striped wild.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.680]  There's a wild boar got in with them at one time
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.520]  and dropped those genetics off before he went on his way.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.280]  Right on.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.160]  So when it's coming to these things,
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.440]  like is there certain livestock that you feel like
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.040]  is better geared toward the cannabis farmer
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.600]  than just like the average,
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.120]  like livestock rancher kind of a farm?
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.760]  I don't have these.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.320]  I plan to, but I don't have them yet.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.520]  And that's alpacas.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.080]  Alpaca poops.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.000]  Pretty good poop, man.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.640]  Pretty good poop.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.840]  And I feel like alpacas are kind of the pit bulls
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.840]  of the regenerative agriculture cannabis world.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.040]  Everyone had pit bulls back in the day
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.640]  and now it's like everyone's getting alpacas
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.800]  for their property.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.040]  Alpacas are really good.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.760]  Again, it's not really hot poop
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.240]  and it's what you're wanting to accomplish.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.920]  Like a cow is basically a sauerkraut machine on legs.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.560]  And so it pumps in all of this plant material
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.880]  and it ferments it and sends it out the back.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.080]  Pigs not fermenting.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.520]  Pigs chewing through it and processing a lot like we are.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.120]  Chicken and a turkey have gizzards.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.560]  So you can really play with that.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.040]  I posted a picture yesterday of red turkey poop.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.600]  Now we're going back to turkeys and chickens do this too.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.980]  Their poop turns red.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.280]  We have red dirt.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.200]  And so there's little red sandstone pebbles
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.720]  all over our field.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.320]  And they pick those up because we call them turkey teeth.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.680]  Grit is turkey teeth because turkeys don't have teeth
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.560]  and neither do chickens.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.240]  So if you give them grit, they put that in their gizzard
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.800]  and that gizzard is a strong muscle
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.860]  and it grinds all their food.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.580]  It does what your teeth do.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.840]  And then out the back.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.080]  If you give them sandstone,
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.560]  it's not hard enough to really break up food.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.480]  So you don't get as good of a food conversion.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.840]  Whereas if you give them granite,
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.520]  you get a good food conversion.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.160]  But granite doesn't really break down
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.280]  on the property a whole bunch.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.880]  But they'll pick up sandstones
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.440]  or I'll go down to the creek and I'll get sandstones
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.220]  and bring them little pebbles, bring them up,
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.440]  throw them all over the field.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.540]  They pick them up.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.800]  They crush them in their gizzard.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.840]  You're mineralizing.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.920]  You're making a lot of the silicas and stuff available
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.560]  and then kicking it out the back.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.420]  Things like that.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.680]  Why not feed them to the animals?
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.360]  Like they do.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.480]  I mean, who are we to think we're better?
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.080]  Like they've been doing this a long time.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  So manures do change things.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.880]  Your cow manure, a good thing with cow manure
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.640]  is after three days, your sultrify larva hatch.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.000]  And if you have chickens there waiting,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.160]  they'll spread that cow poop all over the place.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.320]  And so you don't get these clumps of green grass
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320]  all over a field, but they scatter it.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.000]  If you bring in the chickens on day two, they won't do it.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.400]  Day four, they won't do it.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.040]  Because all the larva's gone.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.600]  So you gotta, I always say this,
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.600]  like you gotta set the table for your guest.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.400]  And if you want your guest to show up,
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.760]  just put the food on the table.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.600]  They're like teenagers.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.440]  It's that easy.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.400]  Well, I wanted to get more into the alpaca
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.720]  because that's something that I hopefully one day,
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.240]  I'd love to be able to ranch those
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.200]  for a variety of different reasons.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.440]  But what I've heard about them is they're pretty intelligent.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.880]  They poop in the same area.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.280]  They like to be clean.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.680]  And then from other farmers,
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.280]  what I've heard is that they use,
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.440]  then we'll introduce the dung beetle.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.160]  So then the dung beetle will go over there
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.120]  to where the alpaca manure is
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.480]  and actually start to spread that all over the field
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.000]  for you.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.760]  So then you as a farmer get to kind of put your feet up.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.480]  And I guess because they are intelligent enough,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.640]  like once everything's kind of cleaned off,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.280]  they really know that that's the area
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.200]  they're gonna poop at.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.720]  And then you continue to clean that up with the dung beetle
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.840]  and you have a little like closed ecosystem
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.160]  that takes care of itself.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.760]  I personally never use that,
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.360]  but I wanted to give that little gold nugget.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.640]  Cause I do feel like for those of you out there,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.320]  hey, try that, get back to us on that.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.280]  Because from what I understand,
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.720]  having both of those things in the setup,
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.240]  your field is gonna look fantastic,
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.040]  obviously as the years roll through.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.760]  Yeah, and again, you said it real good,
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.000]  as the years roll through.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.560]  This isn't something that's instant,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.280]  but you can do a lot of things really quick
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.880]  with some good diversity.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.480]  I didn't know that about alpacas.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.320]  That's freaking awesome.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.640]  They poop in one spot.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.640]  I've got a friend, his name's Packapunch.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.600]  And he does an alpaca, he has like a,
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.600]  he's from Colorado.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.640]  He moved here several years ago.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.040]  And he made like, I think it was called Packapunch.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.920]  And it was just this dry amendment
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.680]  and it had a lot of alpaca poop in it.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.920]  That was his main thing.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.760]  That's what he had pushed.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.520]  He's like, it's got alpaca poop in it.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.360]  Just watch.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.680]  You just put this in as a top dress
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.920]  or mix this in with one cup or whatever
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920]  and watch what it does.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.760]  I did a grow with it.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.160]  It did really well.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.480]  We didn't have any issues.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.440]  I don't know if he has that stuff available anymore,
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.200]  but that's incredible about the alpacas,
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.780]  especially with the dung beetles.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.780]  I'm trying something new with my pigs.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.800]  I moved my black soldier fly larva.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.780]  I saw OK Calix and Marco's growing.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.260]  Shout out to you two guys.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.660]  I saw them having issues with their black soldier fly larva
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.500]  at the end of the season.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.980]  Everything's getting colder
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.940]  and they're just kind of being done with it.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.260]  So I was like, I've got a hoop house
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:27.020]  or I've got a 50 foot gothic hoop house
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.820]  from Farmer's Friend.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.740]  And I just stuck it at one end of it.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.340]  Last year, I was able to keep the greenhouse alive
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.820]  with a thermophilic compost at one end
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.420]  with duck and chicken manure in it.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.040]  And I inoculated it.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.780]  We dropped below freezing for 13 days.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.760]  My greenhouse survived.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.480]  It dropped negative 17.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.840]  My greenhouse stayed at about 17 above
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.160]  with a thermophilic compost.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.880]  So I was like, compost is going in the greenhouse this year
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.740]  and we're gonna put the black soldier fly larva in there.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.080]  And they have exploded in growth.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.720]  So I took a bucket
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.640]  and I grabbed some of those black soldier fly larva
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.400]  and I put it in the corner where I'm deep bedding those pigs.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.320]  My hope is, is those black soldier flies start working
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.760]  throughout all that material
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.200]  and they start eating some of that poop
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.560]  and start breaking it down.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.220]  Worst case scenario, they don't do anything
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.840]  and nothing ever happens.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.780]  But that's incredible.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.300]  Dung beetles, I mean, come on.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.000]  And then they probably bury it.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.400]  So they'll take it and they'll dig a hole
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.600]  and then they send it down the hole.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.880]  I mean, they're plowing for you.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.600]  Like they're not calling in sick.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.520]  They don't require workers comp.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.400]  There's no complaints, no HR, no nothing.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.980]  Like why wouldn't you work with them?
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.820]  You just feed them.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.600]  And I've heard they're a little bit like,
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.800]  they'll nip at you a little bit
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.440]  or they're kind of a little bit emotional creatures.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.660]  But that's really all I know about them.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.500]  But I know that-
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.540]  I don't think they spit like llamas
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.300]  even though they are kind of like a llama.
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.020]  But again, if, I'm saying,
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.740]  I've never personally used them,
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.280]  but these are things that I've seen on people's farms
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.540]  and it just always inspired me to where I was like, wow,
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.980]  if I was able to have a ranch one day,
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.820]  this is what Clydesdale horses and alpacas
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.740]  would need to be the dream kind of setup.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.720]  And I do feel like having personalities,
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.460]  obviously horses have personalities
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.900]  and just to kind of have that where,
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.300]  I actually had a fun question for you, Andy, as well.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.440]  So when I was young, we grew up on,
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.300]  I didn't grow up on a farm,
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.860]  but a lot of the friends in Georgia and stuff,
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:25.700]  they had farms.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.980]  And so the highlight of what we were supposed to do
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.580]  on Friday nights after football games was to go cow tipping.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.260]  But anytime that we entered a field,
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.480]  they would all start moving and running.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.760]  I've always thought that people that said
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.560]  that they went cow tipping successfully were liars
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.600]  because I've personally never seen that happen
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.340]  unless you maybe have one cow and kind of like a barn
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.320]  and you just push it over.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.000]  Obviously this is stupid shit that you shouldn't do.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.360]  But teens, I was just wondering if that's even possible
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.360]  or if it's the same kind of thing, like urban legend,
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.160]  where people just repeat bullshit.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.400]  Oh man, you're talking to the cow tipping legend right here.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.720]  I've kept, I've tipped more, I'm just kidding.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.800]  I haven't.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.960]  I think that that comes from, like you said,
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.880]  old farms used to have a milk cow,
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.680]  or like my dad says, I would have to,
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.680]  my dad would say he had to have to milk six cows
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.160]  before breakfast.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.920]  He'd wake up at around 4 a.m.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.060]  And they would be waiting at the barn for him.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.880]  And at night, if you know where they're at,
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.440]  they're all, there's a farm out here called Loma,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.000]  Land of Milk and Honey is what it stands for.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.640]  And he's an Amish gentleman and it's all pastured milk.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.080]  And it's this red barn, it's the most magical little place.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.360]  It's got 68 A2H2 jerseys.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  He does wood stove, low vat pasteurization.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.220]  And where I'm going with that is they're so gentle,
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.560]  you can just rub them.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.700]  They come in, they know you, they're glad you're there
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.360]  because you're gonna drain them.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.320]  They're in pain, they need to be drained.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.000]  They're full, they're full of milk.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.200]  And so I think that that comes from that,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.640]  where you actually could walk out into a field.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.960]  I grew up in Northern Texas, man, we did some wild stuff.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.200]  We would bet 30 pack of beer could get people
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.960]  to do a lot of things.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.400]  And you'd bet your buddy that a 30 pack of beer
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.000]  that he couldn't jump that fence.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.160]  We had cattle everywhere.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.160]  Jump the fence, grab that calf and tackle it carefully.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.360]  Don't bust it over or whatever.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.120]  But tackle it before the mom got you.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.800]  And he was like, oh, yeah, of course.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.680]  Give me a six pack and we'll do this.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.640]  And as soon as you jump the fence,
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.240]  the mommas point their ears at you
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.180]  and they point their eyes at you and she'll kill you.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.560]  People are worried about bulls, man.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.200]  I just worked cattle all last week at my uncle's ranch.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.080]  It's not the bulls that I'm worried about.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.600]  Like I pay them mad respect.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.120]  They're 2,500 pounds of straight T-bone muscle.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.240]  And they'll kill you in a split second.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.600]  They wouldn't even know it.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.640]  But they're super-
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.460]  You're gonna do this, Bob,
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.300]  that's why you're talking about that.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.920]  Because I remember when they would run by you,
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.320]  it felt, especially being younger, I guess,
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.040]  but it felt like a freight train.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.320]  You just got missed by hitting by a bus or something.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.120]  These things, when they're spooked.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.440]  Yeah.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.280]  Holy shit.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.120]  It still does.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.000]  So whenever a cow,
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.360]  so bovine is the name of the creature.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:23.360]  A cow is a bovine that has been bred and had a calf.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.880]  Whenever the cows come by, they're 1,600, 1,800 pounds
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.600]  and they just shake the ground.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.080]  When a cow, when a bull's bigger,
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.080]  but when a cow gets mad, we call it getting hot.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.040]  Whenever she gets hot,
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.420]  because you've tried to get her in the pan
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.400]  or she's been irritated at you or whatever,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.120]  and she gets this demonized,
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.200]  it is the worst thing in the world to be anywhere near her.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.440]  I had a four-wheeler hit by her.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.880]  I had a cow hit a four-wheeler, I don't know,
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.280]  four to six different times.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.560]  I was just trying to get away from her.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.040]  And she was just coming after the four-wheeler,
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040]  just trying to get me to go away.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.200]  And if she got me off the four-wheeler,
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200]  she would have pounded me into the ground.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.760]  They do that because a cow is meant to protect its baby.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.840]  Has nothing to do with you.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.600]  She doesn't think you're cute or dangerous.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.160]  She's not afraid of you.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.240]  She just wants to protect the baby.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.160]  And so if you give them a cow to express the cowness
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.720]  of a cow, you let her protect the baby, you're fine.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.980]  Everything's okay.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:20.120]  And I think that's where some of those old myths,
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.280]  I've had cows on our property growing up
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.080]  that there was a short mama Hereford
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.600]  and she would come up to you and nudge you in the pen
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.960]  because she'd want you to scratch her behind the ear.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.800]  I'd never had a cow that was that gentle,
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.980]  but she had been raised by like an old 70 year old man
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.320]  that had basically fed his herd
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.360]  out of the back of his pickup every morning.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.640]  She wasn't afraid of humans at all.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.720]  She had a calf.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.600]  She would introduce the calf to you.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.920]  Wasn't that, it's not that scary.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.760]  Raising animals isn't that terrifying.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.320]  Once you realize, my buddy, Oklahoma Kush Collective,
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.160]  say it all the time.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.080]  He goes, you just have to figure out
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.840]  what they're willing to barter for.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.860]  And most animals are not willing to barter their fear.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.440]  And so the way that a lot of commercial ag move stuff
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.200]  is out of fear, scream, yell, kick, punch,
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.040]  whatever it takes to get the animals to move,
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.920]  you got to scare them.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.880]  When in all reality, you see people like Joel Salatin,
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.080]  he can move 600 head of cattle just by opening a fence
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.360]  and he can go out there and lay down with them
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.760]  and they won't mess with him.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.360]  People are worried about it because they don't understand it
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.520]  or they don't know it.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.400]  And I encourage everyone to grow your own food,
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.440]  even if it's a couple of chickens
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.000]  or a couple rabbits in the basement.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  I mean, rabbits can, you can push out some protein
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.480]  with some rabbits if people are wanting to grow
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.720]  their own food.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.880]  So yeah, they're amazing, majestic creatures
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.000]  and I respect their life.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.360]  I mean, I eat beef.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.400]  I'm beef fed, beef raised.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.640]  I mean, I'm pork, beef, chicken, all that stuff.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.280]  But no reason to disrespect a cow's life
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.640]  by shoving it through the commercial ag system.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.520]  There's just no reason.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.840]  The meat doesn't even taste as good.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.360]  You get a better quality meat.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.440]  All that vitamin D from grass fed beef
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.800]  is the reason why we're so vitamin D deficient.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.320]  We don't have it.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.460]  Same thing with eggs.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.680]  Your eggs are pasture raised, they're raised in the sun,
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.840]  they've got vitamin D in them.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.900]  They've got a lot of things that break a lot of things down
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:22.520]  that help balance it, just like an orange has its fiber
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.800]  to protect your pancreas from all the sugar.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.240]  You're not meant to drink orange juice.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.920]  You're meant to eat oranges
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.520]  because the orange has all the balance necessary in it
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.280]  to slow down that process
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.780]  so you're not spiking your blood sugar every day.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.880]  It's there.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.320]  Nature's built that way.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.960]  Oh, another tangent.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.800]  No, that's great.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.560]  I think Leighton's jumping in there.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.520]  It's, you know, there's just so much
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.200]  you're throwing out there and it's all beautiful.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.360]  It's like, pay attention to nature, right?
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.360]  Just watch what she does.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.200]  It's easy.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.480]  You don't have to do shit.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.560]  You know, the dung beetles, the manures, you know,
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.480]  these relationships that have been
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.520]  for millions and millions of years
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.080]  and the arrogance of humanity is,
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.360]  well, we can do it better.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.920]  And we got to fight nature.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.400]  We got to push her back.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.320]  And that is the foundation of where we are today.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.360]  That's why we have so many problems.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.800]  So no, I'm just-
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.320]  Have you-
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.680]  Go ahead.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.720]  Have you heard America, the land America,
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.200]  produce four times more protein before we settled it?
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.200]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.120]  Four times the amount of protein we produce today.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.600]  And we have all this in land.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.520]  I mean, we grow feed.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.960]  Like my part of Texas, I grew up Northwest part of Texas.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.720]  We get 18 inches of rain a year.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.880]  Our farm runs off the Ogallala Aquifer.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.800]  We are using the Earth's most precious natural resource,
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.000]  something that we can't live without for three days.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  We're using that to make pig feed
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.280]  and cow feed and chicken feed.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.240]  Good God, what are we doing?
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.680]  And it's like, we're not raising,
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.240]  they're not raising cucumbers out there.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.640]  They're not raising lettuces and things like that.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.080]  No, they're raising corn, wheat, cotton, and that's it.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.440]  And they've got 60 or 70 dairies in like a four county area.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.840]  And it's all driven for those dairies.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.240]  Can I say something here?
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.360]  This is not normal.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.240]  There is a dairy South of my parents' house
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.640]  that's about a mile.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.080]  It's an organic dairy.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.160]  They are required,
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.560]  in order to meet their certification organic,
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.640]  they have to let their cows out
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.600]  so many days a year to graze.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.840]  They have to be out of their big white barns.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.960]  And so you'll see the black and white cows picturesque
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.280]  out on there.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.120]  12 miles South of that dairy
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.080]  is the dairy that owns that dairy.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.040]  That dairy to the South is where they mill all their food,
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.280]  all the grain for all the cows,
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.720]  all that's milled 12 miles South.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.240]  In order to appease the organic certification,
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.360]  they mill it in the South,
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360]  they put it on a truck and they drive it North
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.600]  and they feed it
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.940]  because they don't wanna spend the money
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.980]  on putting a mill in the North farm.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:17.860]  So they drive everything from the South farm.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.060]  And that is organic.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:20.900]  It's covered,
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.220]  it's not literally covered in diesel figuratively.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.660]  We've covered in petro from there to there.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:29.140]  Why the hell are they hauling it?
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.700]  But it's like financially, that's why.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.540]  And I'm not knocking anyone for making money.
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.180]  But that is such a sore spot on the organic agriculture
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.420]  and these farmers y'all,
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.260]  all you gotta do is sign a freaking piece of paper
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.600]  saying it was grown organic and it goes.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:49.540]  And no one's, who the hell's tested it?
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.100]  Who the hell's testing on the other side?
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.620]  Come on, nothing on the other side.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.220]  They just goes in a bin and it's fed to cows
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.700]  and we charge three times as much for that beef
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.660]  and it's the same shit.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.980]  It's just different degree.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.500]  Really, I don't get it.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.860]  And the whole thing, it's just not normal.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.620]  And anyway, I'm-
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.900]  Now wait.
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.020]  Well, when it comes to the labels,
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.020]  I kind of wanna run down that.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.460]  So like the USDA organic,
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.740]  I guess that's more compromised.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.340]  Now some people are saying the non-GMO
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.620]  with the butterfly on it, that that's still pure and true.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.500]  Do you happen to know any information on that as well?
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.340]  I don't.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.220]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:32.180]  I do know that my dad sold seed
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.060]  for Pioneer Seed Company for over 35 years.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.380]  So whenever it comes to genetics and seeds,
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:41.660]  whether that be corn or Milo, I'm pretty well versed in it.
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:47.700]  Non-GMOs are generally more organic
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.780]  because now we really can't grow many seeds
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.580]  that aren't GMOed because the methodologies around them
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.740]  help prop those crappy genetics up.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:00.180]  And so whenever you get something that's non-GMO,
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:01.700]  I'm not saying it's clean.
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:06.260]  I'm just saying there's less of a opportunity to be tainted
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.940]  because it is non-GMO.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.100]  I've heard it go the other way too.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.060]  If it's organic, it has to be non-GMO.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:12.900]  Is that correct?
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.420]  Or has to be, right?
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.460]  Someone has to sign on a paper.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.500]  That's what I had heard, especially when it comes to food.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.260]  So like if a company goes out of their way
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:24.500]  to have USDA organic and the non-GMO butterfly,
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.900]  that that's a company that's going out of their way
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.380]  to at least play the game, I guess.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.340]  But from what I understood, the non-GMO
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.780]  with the butterfly on it,
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.020]  still like they came out and checked the farms and stuff.
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:37.820]  So I would love somebody that knows way more
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:38.700]  about this shit than us.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.140]  Maybe we could talk on that.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.460]  Because I do feel like you are deceived nowadays.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.060]  There's just all these like weird words
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.380]  where they just say like natural or, you know,
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.540]  like if you say, I think pasture-raised
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.740]  has to be a certain thing, but it's not what you think.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.700]  You know, it's just so many square feet
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.020]  per chicken or per animal.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.340]  It's all lies.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.500]  In the state of Oklahoma, we can't butcher chickens
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.660]  in the state of Oklahoma.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.900]  Let me tell you why.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:07.900]  Because just east of here is the state of Arkansas
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.540]  and Rogers, Arkansas is the home of Tyson Chicken
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.900]  and a couple other big conglomerates.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.220]  All their butcher shops are on the other side of the border.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.860]  So if you're growing chickens, 25,000 in a barn here,
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.660]  you can't butcher them in the state of Oklahoma.
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.860]  You have to go to their facilities.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:21.700]  It's horseshit.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.260]  You can't butcher them on your own property?
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.100]  No, government doesn't allow that.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.820]  The state of Oklahoma allows us to sell 1,000 broilers,
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.260]  so 1,000 chickens off our property,
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.300]  butchered on our property,
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.580]  but they have to have all these disclaimers
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.260]  so that people know how dangerous it is
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.860]  to eat a chicken from someone that farmed it right.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.980]  And it's so asinine.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.900]  It's so dumb.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:51.220]  So yeah, I don't know where.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.180]  Well, I would, and for people that wanna check out
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.900]  the chicken stuff, though,
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.300]  there's a movie called Food Inc.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.220]  And I believe they actually specifically go
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.820]  to Tyson Chicken Farms and you can see for yourself
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.500]  what's going on on that side of things.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.220]  Yeah, and I'm always of the mindset
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.500]  that to change stuff like this,
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.020]  you need to shine a light on it
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.220]  and watch all the cockroaches kind of go away.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.220]  So I would love for you to stick on this topic
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.460]  and just talk about some of the shit that goes on
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:20.020]  that's just ass backwards, like the Tyson situation.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:22.220]  And if you wanna keep talking about it,
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.740]  because I feel like when people hear it,
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.060]  if we keep repeating it, the word spreads, right?
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.740]  Like it may spread to 230 people today,
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:34.620]  but you can't get from point A to point B
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:38.180]  without just continuously hammering on these points.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.660]  Yeah, and a lot of people call it greenwashing.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.180]  Greenwashing is the reason why you believe
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.220]  that Vital Farms is actually pasture.
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.540]  My friend went to a farmer that's contracted
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.580]  with Vital Farms.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.820]  Every two days, they have to open a little doggy door
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.300]  on the side of their coop with 25,000 chickens
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.180]  that are raised the exact same way as all the others
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:59.220]  to allow them to be pasture raised.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.780]  Cage-free, cage-free.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.020]  They just put them in the same barns
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:06.780]  that they raise their boilers in and they open the door.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.380]  They never wanna go outside, you know why?
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.180]  Because they can't, they're too fat.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.820]  They're overweight, their legs can't carry them,
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.820]  their muscle structure is not made for it.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.100]  So they just don't go out.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:18.060]  And it's the saddest damn thing
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.060]  you've ever seen in your life
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.980]  because it's like these chickens aren't being chickens.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.540]  They're something else.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.780]  Andy, my family buys Vital Farm eggs
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.060]  thinking we're doing the right shit.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:28.900]  So what eggs should we be buying
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.340]  when we can't go to the farmer's market?
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.260]  Find a local farmer.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.820]  There's a lot of them around that do the eggs
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.980]  or that will actually deliver now.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.620]  March of 2020 really changed the whole world.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:44.200]  And the farm that I have milled my grain for me for our feed,
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.220]  their name's Prairie Creek Farms.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.140]  And they're here in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.440]  And they do grass-based, grass-finished stuff.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.280]  And I don't know of any brands
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.200]  on any big grocery store shelves,
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.540]  even the one owned by Amazon,
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.360]  to be any way honest anymore.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.280]  And people talk about brand, go ahead.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.440]  Well, Peter wanted us to kind of dive deeper into that.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.820]  So let's kind of dive deeper into the dirty world of that.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.480]  Because if you haven't seen certain videos
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.140]  about where your food comes from,
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.460]  it is eye-opening what people are getting away with,
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.620]  what huge conglomerates are getting away with.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.900]  Yeah, so if you buy beef from a local ranch
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.540]  or you can look at the market
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.340]  and see what beef goes for that day.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.620]  It's usually a buck 30 to a dollar 50 a pound
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.340]  is what they get paid.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:39.420]  And they get paid that by commercial ag.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.420]  So they sell it at a barn
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.180]  or they sell it to one of these big four conglomerates.
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:46.380]  And then that goes through these big massive packing houses.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:51.380]  That company makes over $700 per head of cattle,
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.340]  per cow that they run through there and they butcher.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:56.420]  The rancher's not making that much money.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.200]  So again, we have another system,
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.340]  just like the coffee industry, which I can,
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.940]  there's a whole nother rabbit hole.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.100]  Just like the coffee industry
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.620]  where the farmer's not getting paid anything
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.900]  and the last person to handle that farmer's product
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.520]  makes the largest margin.
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.200]  Same thing's happening in cannabis.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.740]  Why are dispos getting 100% markup on their stuff
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.980]  whenever the farmer doesn't get paid diddly shit?
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.940]  I always ask people, why in the fall
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.740]  is there such a drop in price,
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.360]  but the patient never sees it?
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.540]  They never see it.
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.380]  And so we're doing the same thing
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.620]  that we're doing a commercial ag with beef.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.860]  And so we run these beefs through there.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:33.660]  They make over $700 profit per cow with chickens.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.580]  Chickens don't make much for profit.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.660]  They make about seven cents per chicken
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.140]  is what Tyson makes after it's sold.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.300]  Seven cents is all they have.
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.400]  So if the price of feed goes up,
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.100]  that seven cents is eat up like that.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.260]  How do they control it if they can't control the feed?
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.260]  Because they can't control the feed, they're big buyers,
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.580]  so they can get cheaper prices and they can manipulate that.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.820]  But really, their way of controlling it is
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.860]  getting on the phone, calling their other plant
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.220]  and saying, do not increase production.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.900]  Because if you don't increase production,
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:12.380]  we can keep the demand up, we can lower our supply level
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.100]  and increase the price and make up our seven cent margin
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.060]  because a 10 or a 15% increase in feed
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.380]  equates to a 15 cent loss on the other side.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:26.280]  And so they're just trying to keep their business in check.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.860]  And they're just saying, well,
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.820]  the only way to really do the margin
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:30.820]  instead of calling every Walmart
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.800]  and telling them to raise our price,
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.220]  we'll just reduce our supply and they'll raise the price
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.380]  and then we'll make more money.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.300]  They do it all the time.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.300]  Beef packers, they're under lawsuits right now
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.280]  saying that the four main beef packers,
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.300]  I wrote this down so I had this info
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.660]  because I wanted this stat.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.820]  Those four meat packers are being told
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.400]  that they actually are in cahoots with one another,
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.580]  which every rancher and every feed yard manager
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.820]  in the United States knows that they are.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.740]  Because if you get one that shuts down
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:02.740]  because of a sickness, that's wonderful.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.700]  Because they just lost 60% of their business
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.220]  whenever every restaurant in the United States
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.420]  was told to shut down.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.380]  So what do they do?
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.060]  Oh, they shut down, they were sick.
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.900]  It's supposed to be the most sterile environment
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:13.940]  in the world.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.780]  They're passing our meat through it
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.780]  and they're like, oh well, we can't be in there.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:19.620]  Why?
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.220]  Well, because it's dangerous to be in there.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:27.380]  So how do you make up money on the other end?
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:29.500]  You just lower your demand.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:34.500]  So as long as, say JBS is a big one,
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.060]  JBS calls the other national beef,
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.660]  JBS calls national beef and just says,
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:43.480]  hey, why don't we figure out a way to shut a plant down?
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.380]  And then as long as we don't increase production,
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.540]  we'll all make more money.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:51.540]  Why wouldn't they?
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.340]  They control it.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.400]  So it sounds like the diamond market,
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.640]  just hide all this shit.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.680]  Don't let people know the real volume that you have.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.120]  And then you can manipulate the marketplace.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.240]  I felt like when I was younger,
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.760]  I saw how powerful the beef industry was
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:13.960]  when Oprah Winfrey famously said on her show
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.920]  that she was never gonna eat a hamburger again
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.940]  because of the E.coli breakout.
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:22.240]  And the only reason that Oprah wasn't destroyed,
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.840]  obviously, by the beef industry
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.440]  with all the losses that they threw at her
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.680]  is because she was Oprah Winfrey
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.640]  with a shit ton of money.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.480]  But to the average farmer, that's not what they do.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.440]  What happened?
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.760]  Oh, he must have frozen or something.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.800]  I think Layton's freezing and he's thinking it's us.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.880]  Yeah, dude, that Oprah thing,
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.720]  that happened in basically my hometown in Amarillo, Texas.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.920]  Don't threaten the Texas Cattle Feeders Association.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.760]  Just don't.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.160]  It's crazy the lawsuits they brought on her
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.000]  just for saying that one little snippet.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.940]  I mean, that was really all she said.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.040]  Where the power is,
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.880]  and I wanna reiterate this 100 times,
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.120]  is whenever the farmer directs with the patient
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.620]  or the farmer directs with the consumer.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.960]  That's whenever it's done.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:05.800]  Because it's like,
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.640]  the rancher's gonna get paid this amount for their beef
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.620]  and you're gonna pay about a dollar a pound to process it.
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:14.520]  So you're gonna get beef if you buy quarters and halves
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.520]  from ranchers, you're gonna get beef
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.840]  at around three to 350 a pound, and that's on a high end.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.160]  That's 350 a pound for your ribeyes,
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.520]  and your briskets, and your hamburger meat.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.120]  I don't know hamburger meat that's going less
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.420]  than five bucks a pound right now in the grocery store.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.340]  And it's all shit.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.280]  So reach out to a rancher or a farmer.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.480]  You're gonna change their life.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.800]  I watched it in my business before this with coffee farming.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.680]  You pay a farmer, you pay a coffee farmer
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.720]  up to 10 times more than what they're getting paid,
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.120]  completely changes their ballgame.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.640]  It changes next year, and the next year, and the next year.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.120]  And it costs, a dollar to a coffee farmer
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.480]  is like a three-fold increase.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.280]  A dollar to someone in America
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.480]  sipping another Starbucks is nothing.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.000]  So why aren't we passing that along?
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.180]  Why not?
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.680]  And we do it in the cannabis industry.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.640]  That's why JDAM and natural farming's so important.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.720]  Because JDAM's first chapter is all about
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.560]  giving power back to the farmer,
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.920]  and that is the most important,
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.000]  most sacred thing that we can do.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.080]  If we want sovereignty and we really wanna change this thing
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.720]  we have to have control of our own food.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.280]  If we don't, what are you gonna do?
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.880]  Talk shit and then they're just gonna
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.580]  not deliver the food that week?
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:29.280]  You're gonna stop talking shit real quick.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.080]  You just think they got us by the balls now.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.500]  Just wait till they start slinging.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.640]  I don't have the quote, I think it's 87%,
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.480]  you can Google it, 87% of most meat in America
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.640]  is held by four major companies.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.960]  I wanted to also talk about with the meat.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.800]  So a lot of companies.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.840]  Just quickly, this is where for me being concrete,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.680]  can you just name those companies?
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.360]  The four major?
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.760]  Right, just so everybody kinda
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.880]  starts getting educated on this stuff.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.840]  And Andy, take your time and search it.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.360]  Just take your time and search it.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.840]  Because there's a lot of things
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.900]  that's not being talked about right now.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.860]  Farm Aid.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.940]  What the fuck was Farm Aid?
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:21.500]  It happened way back when and nobody remembers it.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.100]  That was when the big food guys came in
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:29.100]  and stole all the farms from multi-generational farmers.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.500]  And that's where they gained the power
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.460]  and created these food empires.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.460]  And I think there's only four of them, two,
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.660]  that control the vast majority of farmland
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.260]  in the Middle West.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.220]  And they don't give a flying fuck
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:49.860]  about protein or health or soil or anything.
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:52.300]  They are just raping the environment.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:55.060]  You know?
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:58.580]  It's relative feed value, RFV.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:02.160]  Hemp's got a wonderful, hemp has a wonderful opportunity.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.940]  The relative feed value, so the quality of feed,
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.820]  is right there with alfalfa.
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.340]  So whenever you bale up hemp,
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.060]  you grow it up, it's foraged, chop it,
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.500]  and then dry it out and bale it
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.860]  just like you would alfalfa hay
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.620]  and feed it to your cattle or your whatever,
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:18.180]  it's got the same relative feed value as alfalfa.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:19.940]  Alfalfa's a perennial.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.940]  More important, it's feeding the endocannabinoid system
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.060]  of the animal which then we are consuming.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.220]  And that's gonna increase our endocannabinoid value.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.300]  So all of this-
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:33.580]  You're popping his cork again
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:34.980]  while you're talking about it.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.140]  I'm really excited.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.540]  I'm really excited there's a farmer here
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.380]  in the state of Oklahoma that I've been working with
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.140]  to get hemp seed cake.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.460]  So he takes hemp seed, he presses it for hemp seed oil,
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:48.500]  he grows it on his property there here in Oklahoma.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.280]  And then the byproduct is this cake.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.460]  I'll grab some here in a second.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:56.740]  It's this cake and it's 28% protein, we've had it analyzed.
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:38:01.460]  And so I wanna replace the soy in our feed with that
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:05.020]  because soy meals around 34 to 36% protein
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.940]  and that's what makes up a lot of this food.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.020]  And if you're buying eggs that are fed with soy protein,
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.020]  you're really upping the estrogen in that egg.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.720]  I mean, some people have issues with it.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.380]  So we're just trying to, again, start with where you're at
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.620]  and then move away from it if you're in any way possible.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.680]  And that hemp seed cake, man, that is a whole nother world
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.600]  here in the United States that we need to get into
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.620]  because what I'm excited about is to feed hemp seed cake
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.260]  to only layers.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.080]  And then I wanna send the eggs off
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.540]  with and without hemp seed cake
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.900]  as the base protein and see what nutritional value
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.500]  comes out of that egg.
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.460]  And just not tell them it's hemp.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.860]  I gotta send it to a local university
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.220]  here in the state of Oklahoma
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.280]  and I just won't tell them it's hemp.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.580]  I'll just tell them it's two separate eggs,
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.500]  send it to their food science department
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.500]  and then they can figure out how that goes.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:54.700]  There's a whole nother world there
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.620]  and I would love to explore that, especially as farming.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.020]  Like this is the future of farming, hemp, cannabis,
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.500]  future of farming.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.480]  And without it, we're toast.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.840]  My family spent $750,000 on one piece of equipment
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.600]  to harvest cotton.
[01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.250]  And I buy scissors.
[01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.610]  They can't fix that piece of equipment.
[01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:21.810]  If they try to touch that piece of equipment
[01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:24.090]  in any way, shape or form.
[01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:27.370]  Yeah, they're not allowed to.
[01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:31.250]  Okay, so four largest meat producers, according to Google,
[01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:33.370]  in the US meat processing is in the hands
[01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:34.470]  of a few corporations.
[01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:38.150]  For beef, it's JBS, Tyson, Cargill and Marfit.
[01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:41.270]  JBS is owned in Brazil.
[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:43.630]  JBS is owned by a company in Brazil.
[01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:45.670]  They don't even, they're not even American.
[01:39:45.670 --> 01:39:47.750]  It's, they're not even here.
[01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:50.150]  We are letting another country control
[01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.330]  what could be a quarter or even greater.
[01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:55.110]  I would say JBS is probably the biggest
[01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:56.250]  of our meat production.
[01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:00.550]  We outsourced our chips.
[01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:04.010]  How does the auto industry like that right now?
[01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:06.930]  And we're gonna do it with food.
[01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:08.890]  We outsourced everything, guys.
[01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:10.650]  Everything got fucking outsourced.
[01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:12.250]  We can get this back though.
[01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.990]  The farming is the answer.
[01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:16.050]  That's how we get it back and be able to do this
[01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:17.810]  start to finish A to Z,
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:19.410]  be able to press your own medicine.
[01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:20.650]  Why not?
[01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:22.650]  Be able to grow your own medicine in your garden.
[01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:23.490]  Why not?
[01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:25.250]  My wife has an autoimmune disease
[01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:29.810]  and a very mild case of lupus.
[01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:32.050]  And so this is for our health too.
[01:40:32.530 --> 01:40:35.770]  I moved out to the, we moved out to the farm in March 2020
[01:40:35.770 --> 01:40:37.450]  or May of 2020.
[01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:39.690]  And from May of 2020 until about December,
[01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:42.290]  I dropped from 230 to 195.
[01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:44.690]  And I always call it country boy CrossFit
[01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:45.530]  because it's all it was.
[01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:48.090]  I was digging post holes and digging beds
[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:50.610]  and doing all this work and working my hands in the soil.
[01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:52.410]  And I feel better.
[01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:53.670]  I was more clear headed.
[01:40:53.670 --> 01:40:55.450]  I wasn't in the city running my business
[01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:57.130]  and just stressed out to the max.
[01:40:58.890 --> 01:40:59.950]  For me, this is medicine.
[01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.570]  I had a brain injury when I was 17.
[01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.930]  I had a traumatic brain injury.
[01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:04.770]  I spent 13 days in the hospital.
[01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:05.610]  When I walked out,
[01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:07.010]  they told me that I didn't have any symptoms.
[01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:08.690]  That was about the time that all of our boys
[01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:12.090]  were starting to come back from Iraq with all their TBIs.
[01:41:12.090 --> 01:41:16.570]  And then the medical world started seeing a bunch of these.
[01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.250]  And what are the symptoms?
[01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.530]  What are long-term?
[01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.490]  And so by then I was already long gone.
[01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:26.030]  Social anxiety is no joke with that.
[01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:29.610]  Our food depicts so much of how that,
[01:41:29.610 --> 01:41:32.130]  it determines so much of that for us.
[01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:33.370]  So I'm a big broth drinker.
[01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:36.250]  You'll see me in the morning, I'll be drinking some broth.
[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.850]  I make broth here.
[01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:39.210]  It remineralizes me.
[01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:41.250]  My adrenals are shot
[01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:43.170]  because I've drank way too much coffee in my life
[01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:45.850]  and I've been stressed out and I ate like shit.
[01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:48.410]  So my adrenals are shot, dizzy all day.
[01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:50.010]  But since I've been drinking broth,
[01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:51.450]  that's started to come around
[01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:54.650]  because the minerals and the stuff that are in the bones
[01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:58.170]  that you extract out during the broth making process,
[01:41:58.170 --> 01:42:01.010]  for one, it's amazing for your lower, your gut.
[01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:03.970]  It'll rebuild a gut in no time flat
[01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:07.930]  because of the collagen that's in it from the bones.
[01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:10.970]  It helps restore that lining in your intestinal tract.
[01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:14.490]  But the mineralization was what I was really going for.
[01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:16.690]  So that's been incredible too.
[01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:19.090]  You get that when you move out to your own property.
[01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:20.410]  And I know Brian, you said like,
[01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:22.530]  it's really hard for a lot of people to accomplish,
[01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:23.370]  but I'll say this,
[01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.050]  and you'll hear me say it about the equipment today.
[01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:27.130]  Really what it costs is a few heady rigs
[01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:28.050]  and you've got it.
[01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:31.810]  These guys would just not spend 10 grand on glass.
[01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:32.890]  And I love glass.
[01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:34.210]  I think it's amazing,
[01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:35.970]  but I'm not gonna spend 10 grand on it.
[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:38.830]  I spent four or five grand on this setup behind me
[01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:40.290]  instead of buying a heady glass.
[01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:42.330]  And I went and bought a $300 glass
[01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:44.130]  from an artist here in town.
[01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:46.290]  And this has saved me thousands and thousands
[01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:48.850]  and thousands of dollars worth of medicine.
[01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:49.810]  Because I don't know about you,
[01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:51.890]  but I can't spend 70 bucks a gram on hash rods.
[01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:55.650]  And that's subpar from farmers sometimes that lie
[01:42:55.650 --> 01:42:58.330]  or producers that sometimes lie
[01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:00.810]  or lab testing that just isn't accurate.
[01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:03.570]  They may be all goodwill as they want,
[01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:04.730]  but our industry is young
[01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:06.970]  and some of those things just aren't accurate.
[01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:09.770]  So this ensures health.
[01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:12.650]  And I think that's overall goal of everything
[01:43:12.650 --> 01:43:14.890]  in this podcast is just health.
[01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:17.370]  We want a healthy industry to control our food.
[01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:20.810]  We want a healthy industry to control our medicine.
[01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:22.210]  And if those aren't gonna be made,
[01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:23.570]  then we just make our own.
[01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:25.150]  Let them do their craziness.
[01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:27.970]  Let them do their Babylonian crap.
[01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:29.770]  Like we know where that's gonna go.
[01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:33.050]  Just do your own thing.
[01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:35.970]  I can't say it enough.
[01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:37.850]  Like it's one of the healthiest things you can do
[01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:40.410]  is take your food back in your own hands.
[01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:44.050]  And it allows you to remember how good you can feel.
[01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.690]  Like as you get older in life,
[01:43:45.690 --> 01:43:48.250]  all the joints, the inflammation, all that kind of stuff.
[01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:51.850]  And I can't echo enough what you had mentioned
[01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:52.770]  with the bone broth.
[01:43:52.770 --> 01:43:54.970]  And if you're disciplined enough to maybe fast,
[01:43:55.290 --> 01:43:57.850]  let's say 24 hours, 36 hours the first time.
[01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:00.050]  If you're able to do that,
[01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:01.570]  make sure your electrolytes are balanced.
[01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:02.410]  There's a lot of things.
[01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:05.410]  Just don't jump in the pool with that kind of thing.
[01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:07.490]  But if you're familiar with fasting
[01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:09.250]  and then you throw some bone broth into that
[01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:10.850]  when you are finished.
[01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:12.130]  I've personally seen it help me
[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:14.250]  with this thing called leaky gut,
[01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:16.410]  which is a horrible thing to have.
[01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:19.290]  There's a variety of stomach issues
[01:44:19.290 --> 01:44:20.930]  that you can have that cause things.
[01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:22.630]  But that's more of like inflammation
[01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:24.210]  and just always feeling tired
[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:26.690]  and the adrenal stuff as well
[01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:28.370]  really helps with the bone broth.
[01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:31.810]  And again, that's gonna come from high-end sources.
[01:44:31.810 --> 01:44:34.090]  So if you're doing another level
[01:44:34.090 --> 01:44:36.330]  that you're hopefully getting at
[01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:37.650]  or you're spending the money for,
[01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:39.050]  I think it's called Kettle Fire,
[01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:41.350]  seems to be the best brand for the bone broth.
[01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:43.610]  You're spending a little extra money.
[01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:44.770]  That stuff is expensive.
[01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:47.850]  But think of the overall benefit.
[01:44:47.850 --> 01:44:49.190]  You're going to see the benefit
[01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:51.930]  within just a few weeks to maybe a few months
[01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:54.290]  depending on where your body's at.
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.180]  You know, again, something that's not being discussed here
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:06.060]  is that our medical industry,
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:11.260]  our doctors who are being trained to work on us
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:16.260]  don't even take a nutrition class in their college.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.180]  It's not discussed.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.940]  Food is our medicine.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:25.740]  It is why our bodies are going to be healthy or sick.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.660]  Again, the pharmaceutical industry
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:35.660]  bought all the medical schools way back when
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:40.300]  and told them, we're gonna do everything with chemistry.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.140]  Right, chemistry, not food.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.820]  You're right, I do wanna rant, Peter.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.820]  I wanna go fucking ballistic right now.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.180]  But I won't.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.060]  I'll keep it cool, all right?
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:53.580]  But bottom line is that everything
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.220]  that we've talked about today
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.160]  goes back to one fucking thing, money.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.340]  We didn't even touch on how money is being manipulated.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:05.620]  Right, who's the Federal Reserve?
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.460]  Who's the fucking Federal Reserve?
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:12.980]  Hey, if you ever wanna have a talk on real tinfoil stuff,
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.700]  part of my life I was on Tybee Island and Jekyll Island
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:20.100]  where a lot of that stuff was created.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:24.220]  The Federal Reserve was created actually in Savannah, Georgia
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.500]  Jekyll Island specifically.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.140]  So I would love to go down that man
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:31.900]  because I don't feel like enough people realize
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.820]  no matter what's going on,
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:36.180]  I think that's why the rest of the world
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:39.180]  always gets so pissed off as we just print the money
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.460]  and tell people to deal with it.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.900]  And they're not allowed to.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.740]  Right.
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:44.580]  Yeah.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:45.420]  Yeah.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.260]  Yeah.
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:47.100]  Yeah.
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:47.940]  Yeah.
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:48.760]  Yeah.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.340]  I think to talk about that is a huge rabbit hole.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.820]  I do wanna say this,
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.580]  you were talking about some woo woo stuff.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.460]  My grandpa was known for being a water witcher.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.300]  He was a dower.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.340]  And if you had him come out to your property
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.540]  and mark where you should drill your well,
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.620]  now this is Northern Texas, it's 500 feet down.
[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.940]  It costs 25 to $35,000
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.900]  just to see if your hunch is right.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:14.720]  And if it is right,
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:17.020]  it's gonna cost you 60 to 80 to drill it.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:19.500]  And then it's gonna cost you two to $300 a day
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.820]  to keep the well that's on it pumping 1,100 gallons a minute
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.420]  to make sure your cow feed out there
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:28.800]  is getting subsidized by the government and watered.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.220]  And my grandpa would walk around and start marking flags.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:35.500]  And he was like, what is he doing?
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:38.700]  And then he had these dowel rods and they would cross.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:40.900]  And he was like, what are you?
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.220]  Teach us.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:43.820]  And so he'd go and they'd cross
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:45.620]  and he'd go and they'd cross.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.580]  He was one of the guys that Southwest Kansas
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:50.500]  attributes him to starting helping them
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.500]  learn how to dig wells.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.020]  They weren't doing that in the 30s.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.740]  He went to California to shell walnuts or almonds
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:59.860]  during the dirty 30s because his family was broke.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.260]  This was in the dust bowl, they were farming.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:07.260]  And he came back and he had these new ideas, California.
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:09.460]  Hey, we can drill down and there's water here
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:10.300]  and let's dowel.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:12.900]  And so they started doing that and changed things.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.220]  But it was incredible to watch him put six or eight
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.660]  or 10 different flags out in the field
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:18.540]  and then go to each flag again
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.160]  and then pick the one like this is the one.
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.340]  And the difference between 10 feet
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:28.000]  was 300 gallons a minute out of the ground
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.540]  or 1,200 gallons a minute out of the ground.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.300]  And it was like, how does that work?
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.920]  And it's like, that works because that's intelligence
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.880]  that we're too proud to admit we don't know.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.680]  And we think that our computers should be able to tell us.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.260]  I don't know where I was going with that.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:45.040]  You said something right before it.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:48.240]  It's the manipulation, we've lost it.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.040]  We put on tinfoil hats.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.680]  So this isn't a tinfoil hat, grain subsidized.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.920]  Every farmer that farms, that owns the land,
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.000]  gets, I'm talking tens of thousands,
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.480]  hundreds of thousands of dollars per farmer,
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.860]  per year in government payments.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:13.120]  It's so that corn stays cheap, so sugar's cheap,
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.800]  so unhealth is cheap.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.760]  It's, if we're in a natural world,
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.440]  we're just exchanging stuff.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.240]  You know, we're robbing from Peter to pay Paul
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.560]  and we're exchanging that fertility
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.720]  and we're never gonna get anywhere.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.560]  The people that robbed it or mined it out
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.280]  is already gonna be long gone by the time it's over with.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.520]  Um, I don't know, man.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.600]  It doesn't need to be something that's attacked and changed.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.440]  If there's anything we can learn from history
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.600]  or any stories is that, you know,
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.960]  David kills Goliath with something small.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.620]  It's something tiny that gets him.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.280]  Sometimes it's just a whole nother world
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.440]  that starts over here.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.400]  And I think that's what natural farming can and will be.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.560]  Because what it does, it gives respect back to the animals.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.280]  It gives respect back to the soil.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.560]  It gives respect back to life.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.320]  It gives respect back to nature.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.680]  And in turn, you get to feel better than you've ever felt.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.800]  And I'm telling you, the hash is better than I've ever smoked
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.600]  and so like, why not?
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.920]  I mean, everything says like,
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.600]  hey, we're gonna reward you for this, so do it.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.160]  You just can't expect to be rewarded
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.400]  the way that Babylon rewards you.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.860]  It's just not gonna happen, you know?
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.480]  You know, what's funny is when you just mentioned hash,
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.240]  I forgot that we haven't even talked about hash yet, really.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.800]  And we haven't, I'm like, holy shit,
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:28.960]  we got another two hours.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.240]  We got a whole hash conversation coming up.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.440]  Yeah.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.920]  I was gonna say the same thing, Peter.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.760]  Maybe we should reel it in and talk about
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.720]  what we were supposed to be talking about.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:43.720]  I love all the, so I don't know if you said this.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:47.800]  I'm assuming you didn't mean to say that specifically.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.960]  You know, very many, just the nuance
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.960]  or the importance of accuracy in wording.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.640]  But yeah, no, there are lots of, I think it's the bigger,
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:01.640]  you know, I'm wanting to rant.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.360]  I'm wanting to match Leighton rant for rant,
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.720]  but I'm gonna hold it back.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.720]  But basically it's like what I loved about the cannabis world
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.920]  and why I'm, except for this crew,
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:18.160]  like I'm just generally depressed about
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.120]  how I see everything playing out
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.240]  because I feel like in all these other industries,
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.800]  once certain players became powerful enough,
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.200]  they tilted the playing field in their favor.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.680]  And what I loved like specifically in California
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.680]  was all the mom and pops who, you know,
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.680]  before corporate anything came in,
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.480]  it was all husband and wives, you know,
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.820]  family, whatever, friends.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:46.560]  And to your point of all these other industries,
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.560]  it's like some group became powerful, they became big,
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:55.400]  then they started lobbying, and then they just skewed shit
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.760]  in a way like if you explain what happens in these markets
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:03.480]  to anybody, kid, adult, like just they're like,
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.900]  that doesn't sound right.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:07.840]  Like nobody would ever say that sounds right,
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:11.160]  yet it happens and we're kind of locked into it.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:14.600]  And that's why like my big thing is trying to make sure,
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.920]  and it's like trying to hold back a boulder
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:19.800]  rolling down a hill, but it's like that the weed world
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.240]  doesn't go in that direction,
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.080]  even though that's what I'm seeing, right.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.220]  I'm like sadly watching it like a,
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.440]  now I was gonna say what sank the Titanic, a?
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.280]  Iceberg.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.800]  Iceberg, that's the word I'm looking for.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.280]  Right, and slow mo.
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:41.780]  I couldn't agree with you more, and I think,
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.040]  I'll say this, like if you're starting a business,
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.980]  I know that a duck's gonna do what a duck's gonna do
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.800]  because a duck is a duck.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.680]  And so if you're starting a business in this world,
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:56.960]  know that commercial ag has billions and trillions
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.200]  of dollars piled behind it.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.060]  They are stuck to that wagon.
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:04.040]  And Brian, you and I were talking about this.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.800]  I have family that borrows a million dollars
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.960]  at the beginning of the year to be able to do
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:12.120]  this insanity that's called corn farming.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.800]  Corn farmer pays $750 per acre to plant and grow the corn.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:19.000]  And if the market doesn't match that,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.040]  which it generally kind of doesn't,
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  they break even.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.880]  They pay off the bank.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.800]  The banker's happy, everyone's happy, right?
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.880]  Except for the farmer.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:29.860]  Farmer gets subsidies sometimes.
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:30.700]  You're right on that.
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.200]  Not all farmers get subsidies.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.540]  It's just this, they're tied to it.
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.760]  When they go in debt that much, they're tied to it.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.360]  All you growers here in Oklahoma
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.160]  and all around the United States,
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.200]  whenever someone goes and puts in 100 lighter,
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.000]  I go, oh, you're gonna make the patients pay
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:47.920]  for 100 lighter?
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.640]  Because they're stuck to it.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.320]  They're stuck for five years in it.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.800]  They're stuck for 10 years in it.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.640]  We've seen this now.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.800]  This is our third year being legal in Oklahoma.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.840]  And I've seen this advancement where everyone's like,
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.320]  we're gonna bring it bigger and we're gonna go bigger.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.280]  And they're like expanding, doubling, tripling
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.560]  their canopy because they all know
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.520]  that the price is gonna be driven to the bottom.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.160]  They're part of a race that they can't win.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:13.600]  And they're tied to it.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.680]  You get a natural farmer, I'm not tied to shit.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:18.280]  Like I'm not tied to any standard
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:21.560]  or bottled nutrients or anything like that.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.520]  I'm not tied to that system.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.520]  So I can flex and go.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.040]  I mean, right now, without doing the numbers today,
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.640]  and I've only done some test washing,
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.520]  it has cost me $7.49 per gram to grow this.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:38.220]  And if I get what I think I'm gonna get probably today,
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:39.800]  I'll be below $3 a gram.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.200]  That's my cost.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.560]  I don't have an electric bill hanging over my head.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.840]  I don't have a facility that I'm leasing.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:49.400]  I don't have a 10 year lease that my business model
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.400]  has to stay in to complete this 10 year lease.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.480]  I don't have that.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.400]  That is our greatest strength,
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.520]  our absolute greatest strength.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:01.120]  So actually hearing what you're talking about,
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.680]  if you moved your entire operation to the California market,
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.040]  and this is why I love Oklahoma,
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.800]  they'd be like, oh, let's put some weight belts
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:14.580]  of like fees to the state and city
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:17.360]  and like to lawyers and account, you know,
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:20.480]  let's put this massive financial weight vest
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.840]  to artificially jack up your ability
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.640]  to be a small business and succeed.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.680]  That's California and that's why I love Oklahoma.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.000]  And that's just government in general.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:31.840]  They're trying to do it.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:32.960]  And it's worse.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.640]  You forgot the fact that there's a middle man.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.760]  So the farmer, again, is getting-
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.760]  Oh yeah, that's my other thing is no farmers markets
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.520]  are really allowed here in California,
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:48.400]  which is just like, what the fuck?
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.720]  And a cannabis farmers market is allowed here
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.640]  in the state of Oklahoma, just no one's done it yet.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.480]  So if you're in Oklahoma and you want to do something
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.240]  like that next fall, hit me up.
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.400]  I've got some ideas because I think that direct
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.760]  to the patients, because direct to the patients-
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.040]  Could have the FCP harvest hoedown.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:07.880]  There you go.
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.720]  At Jamboree.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.960]  Yeah, yeah, where you could come get your cork blown.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.960]  We can make it a total like farm country fair,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  like thematically with like rides and like rides
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.280]  for the kids and like-
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:25.760]  Animal rides.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.560]  We could have bull riding, the FCP bull riding competition.
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:32.680]  And we could have like the professional bracket
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.880]  and the like stoner bracket of like people
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.280]  who have never been on a bull before.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.680]  You know what mutton busting is?
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.600]  No.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.760]  Come on.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.320]  Anyway, I'm from the country.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.160]  I'm just a-
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.520]  No, what is it?
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.720]  Mutton busting is what little kids get to do
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.640]  to become bull riders.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.960]  So whenever they're really young,
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.080]  they'll put on like a hockey helmet
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.840]  and they'll put them on the back of like a sheep
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.680]  at like a rodeo.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:00.120]  And they're like supposed to hang on for eight seconds
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:02.280]  while this sheep runs off.
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.480]  So we can do that here in the state too for the youngins.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.640]  They'll really enjoy it.
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.000]  You could have like a smoking world, you know,
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.320]  like really get it going where everyone like smokes
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.160]  and then throws up off the side of the ride.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:16.400]  You know, that'd be good stuff.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.120]  Are you talking about the thing?
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:20.080]  Well, remember the thing where the floor drops,
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.040]  the gravity floor or whatever you call it,
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.440]  the gravity wall?
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.680]  I don't remember that.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.280]  Cause I would never go on that.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.280]  Yeah, one of my friends threw up right now.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.920]  So we're both like glued to the wall facing each other
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.520]  and he threw up and I'm like right here.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.240]  And the throw up's like, and stuck to the wall.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.120]  It was pretty funny.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:42.600]  It's reminding me of memories.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.640]  Man, the stuff we talk about on this thing.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.480]  This is awesome.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:51.440]  No, I just, I think that if we educate the patients more,
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.360]  you know, do patients know that every October
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.840]  the market's flooded and the price falls out of it?
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:58.000]  Probably not because their dispensary
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.520]  who's supposed to be taking care of them
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.440]  is wanting to make sure that they get their,
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:05.840]  they go, you know, Black Friday.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.680]  They get in their red, they're out of the red, whatever.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.720]  Where they're making profit.
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.840]  And part of that dispensary problem
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.240]  is the same what you're talking about, Peter,
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.640]  is a lot of the regulations.
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.440]  I don't want to knock on dispensaries too hard.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:23.160]  They're paying like 35 to 41% taxes on their grows.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.000]  You get like eight deductions in the state of Oklahoma
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.620]  for a business that's not a cannabis farm.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.160]  And I don't, don't quote me on that.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.800]  I'm not a tax advisor or anything like that.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.000]  I just know that they're paying taxes on gross earnings.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.880]  And if you're paying taxes on gross earnings, man,
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:39.200]  you're getting a bought, I mean,
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:41.160]  you're just, you're getting the guts ripped out of you.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.880]  Yeah, not being able to deduct
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:47.540]  any normal business expenses is crazy.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:49.800]  Yeah, so.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.600]  That's part of the weight belt.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.720]  I just, I just, again, to reiterate,
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.000]  I just think, or to go back to it a little bit,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.400]  our power comes whenever we direct
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.000]  and we educate the patients
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.640]  and our power comes whenever we're able
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:06.340]  to make our nutrients ourselves and whatever it is,
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.400]  because then we don't have, right now there's,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.080]  oh, food prices are going through the roof
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.360]  and 30 to 40% increase, why?
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.240]  Fertilizer's higher.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.400]  Why is fertilizer higher?
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.200]  Petroleum's up.
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.120]  So why does our petroleum market determine our food market?
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.520]  Well, there's this stuff called anhydrous ammonia.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.960]  There's other fertilizers that are made
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:27.040]  in refiners and things like that.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:30.000]  So of course it controls it, it's all part of it.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.280]  We can't make the same mistakes in the cannabis industry
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.520]  and think that we're gonna get in the river
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.360]  with the big boys and swim, because we're not.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.920]  You're gonna have to do stuff unique
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:43.320]  and Frishie can only rest his soul.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.080]  He was so far ahead of us
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.800]  whenever he was thinking Appalachians.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.320]  If you're in Oklahoma and you wanna start talking
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.960]  about terroir and Appalachians,
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:52.280]  reach out to me, hit me in the DM,
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.280]  because I think that that is something that is necessary
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.860]  in every single state that's even somewhat legal
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.200]  all across the nation.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.600]  However you can get your foot in that door,
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.440]  you shove it in there,
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:04.200]  because the wine industry would have smothered France.
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.160]  But do you think that's possible everywhere?
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:10.320]  Like, I think of like Napa terroir and it means something.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:12.920]  If you were like, these grapes were grown in Oklahoma,
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920]  they have that, the Oklahoma terroir,
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.240]  I'd be like, hmm, I'm good.
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.080]  I don't think we'll know if it means anything until we try.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.880]  And I think that, I've noticed this in my state.
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.400]  I grew in, like it was big root soil
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:29.920]  in my back garden bed in town.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.440]  And I grew a green crack cross
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.120]  that I crossed with a string called Morningwood.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.600]  And it's sour diesel Alaska Thunderfuck.
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:40.520]  And that cross is from the guy Pack-A-Punch.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.240]  It's an amazing hasher, it makes great hash.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.000]  The concentrates are through the roof.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.760]  And it's got that, a lot of people would say
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.600]  a sativa dominant terpene profile.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:52.640]  It's just got a lot of that tropic pine, just gas.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.200]  And you usually can't get those to hash.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.960]  But when I grew the, it's called Pepe de Pew.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.160]  When I grew Pepe de Pew in town,
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.520]  I didn't have near the spice.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.840]  And then whenever I grew it out here
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.640]  in the horticulture beds, I had way more spice in it.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:09.000]  I mean, it was like spicy, spicy.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.800]  The B. caropheline or B. caropheline, however you say that,
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.840]  that was coming through in a way
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:17.160]  that I hadn't had it come through before.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:19.320]  I think, Peter, to answer your question,
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.360]  may not be so much convincing there
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.000]  than that locations are the most important
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.940]  definitive result for terroir,
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.620]  but maybe the microbial world is.
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:30.860]  Because I'm with you, there's Russian River Valley,
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.740]  all that, all up and down California.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:35.900]  There's reasons why those grapes are phenomenal
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:38.620]  in that location and not somewhere else.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.020]  One of the things, just as we're talking,
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:43.660]  and this is a totally random,
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:44.940]  I've been getting high outside
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.100]  because my whole family's not home right now, tangent.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:52.480]  But if you, like, I think of like Kentucky
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.120]  as like prime tobacco growing region, right?
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.080]  I think of Napa as prime grape growing region.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.560]  It'd be interesting to be like, all right, Napa farmers,
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.480]  you gotta do the tobacco this year,
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.880]  and tobacco farmers, you gotta,
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.720]  in Kentucky, you gotta do the grapes,
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:10.740]  and see kind of how, like, why do certain things
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.800]  express themselves so well in Kentucky?
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.000]  What if you put, like, anyway, that's kind of,
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.840]  I'm like, I'd like to just have someone
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.240]  drop knowledge on that.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.440]  Peter, this is something that I think
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.080]  is a really, really good question.
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:27.400]  And the reason those grapes grow so well there,
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.640]  and the tobacco grows so well over there,
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.560]  is environment, right?
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.500]  The cannabis plant is a different animal.
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:36.000]  It's not a grape, and it's not a tobacco plant.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.340]  You can grow cannabis anywhere in the friggin' world,
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:42.280]  but that's not gonna necessarily come through
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.640]  as better in one place than the other.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.720]  That gets back to environment, taro,
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:51.560]  Appalachia, your inputs, and you are up
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.280]  to getting the genetics.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:56.480]  But cannabis may, like grapes and tobacco,
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.320]  have places where, objectively, people who smoke it
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.920]  are like, that is consistently much better.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:05.480]  And so my curiosity is kind of like,
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.080]  it'll be fun to see how, I mean,
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  everybody assumes Humboldt, Trinity, Emerald County,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.760]  certain locations, but it'll be interesting
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:19.480]  to see if there are other great,
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:21.240]  and I think if I hear you correctly,
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:24.080]  what you're saying is cannabis has a wider range
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.400]  of places it can thrive to its best potential
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.640]  than, you know, like Connecticut's another random
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.760]  tobacco place, right?
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.800]  Like a certain kind of tobacco thrives growing.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.520]  Yeah, and so it's kind of interesting, like,
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.960]  you know, anyway.
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.640]  Some crops thrive in specific, very small areas,
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:49.080]  and other crops like cannabis have a bigger band,
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:51.120]  and that's just kind of a cool concept.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.680]  Well, and also, you've gotta talk cultivar,
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.800]  because certain cultivars will do better
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:56.880]  in certain locations.
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.200]  But again, the cannabis plant has been bred
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:04.480]  so hard by humans that now it can pretty much grow
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:07.400]  almost anywhere, other than some issues
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.640]  with the genetics, like this one's prone
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.480]  to getting PM.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.680]  Don't grow it on the fucking coast.
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:15.080]  Grow it in fucking Oklahoma, where it's dry,
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.440]  or maybe Arizona, where you don't have that moisture
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.480]  that can potentially bring that particular pathogen
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.640]  out of it.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:25.120]  So, you know, those kinds of things have to be taken
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.400]  into consideration, but for the most part,
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:31.720]  what he just said is biology is the fucking key.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.280]  And again, how are you treating that?
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.600]  You're using duck pond water, bam, now you're talking.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.720]  You're using manures, bam, you're talking
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:45.600]  about building a microbial diversity in the soil
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:49.640]  that will let this plant express what she wants to.
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:52.480]  She wants to give you her best abilities.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.800]  And so, you know, you're doing your part,
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.800]  that genetic will do its part,
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:59.280]  and now you get something special.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.240]  And the biggest problem we have, rolling this all the way
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.200]  back to the beginning of the conversation,
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:06.400]  is the fucking money control.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:10.040]  So even though you make something, this incredible flower,
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:12.720]  you can't fucking sell it, now you're in trouble, right?
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.920]  You put all these inputs into it, all this energy,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.640]  and now you can't reap the benefits of that.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.600]  And, you know, this is where I wanted to take
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.400]  this conversation earlier, back to Hash,
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.920]  was that the ancients were smart, and they realized
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:32.880]  they couldn't take that flower with them and hold onto it
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:35.680]  for a whole season, or until the next year.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.680]  So they created Hash as a way of preserving it,
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.600]  so that they could continue to smoke that and enjoy it
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:44.520]  until the next harvest.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.400]  And the really, really fucking crazy cool part
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:48.400]  about all that-
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.120]  Stunners are clever problem solvers.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.280]  Well, no, no, it's actually fermenting.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.720]  It's actually getting better.
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:59.240]  It's like that egg that went through and wasn't washed,
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:01.120]  or the baby that was born naturally,
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.320]  that got all its immunities.
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:05.480]  You know, that's the beauty of nature.
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:09.240]  Not fucking around, we're trying to improve it.
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:13.000]  So let's reel back into fucking Hash.
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.320]  Let's talk about some of the things
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.440]  that you're actually doing over there on that farm.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.280]  Because we now-
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:20.760]  Laden wants his cork popped a few more times today.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:23.600]  Now we know the beautiful-
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.720]  Let's pop his cork with flower rosin.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:28.280]  Say again?
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:31.520]  I was hoping we could pop your cork with flower rosin
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:32.520]  and kind of talk about that,
[02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.720]  because I feel like Andy would be an excellent person
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.080]  to speak on that subject.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:41.000]  Yeah, yeah, no, that's what I thought we were gonna talk.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.040]  But now we know the backstory.
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:44.640]  Now we know how he's growing
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:46.560]  and all of the beautiful influences
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:48.600]  that he's plugging into his soil.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.440]  Right.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:50.600]  Another level.
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.240]  Let's talk about what's coming out.
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:54.280]  What are you producing, bro?
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.440]  Actually, hold on before you get there,
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:57.800]  because I have some last...
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:06:59.800]  What?
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:02.200]  Just quickly, what's this one?
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.520]  So this is the top of a JADAM liquid fertilizer, a JLF.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.160]  This is the top of a JLF that was made using only tomatoes.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:16.480]  And I actually used the whole plant.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:18.580]  So something that I've noticed here,
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:20.600]  art, and that's another one.
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:21.440]  So that's just...
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.920]  So the other one was the whole plant.
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.600]  I used all these tomatoes that were coming up.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:25.680]  They were really vigorous.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:28.440]  And I wanted to use that as a vegetative input
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.440]  for my cannabis.
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.280]  And so that's what I did.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.800]  I figured tomatoes grow faster than anything else.
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.380]  The only resistance they don't really have is aphids,
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:39.000]  which you can minimize that using certain things.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:41.480]  But yeah.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.420]  And so this is another JADAM liquid fertilizer.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:46.200]  This is using just the tomato fruit.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:47.600]  So what you're seeing on it is,
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:51.960]  I'm gonna pronounce it probably wrong, is a pellicle.
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:57.260]  And it's essentially, this is a SCOBY that's being formed.
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:59.080]  This one has more red in it.
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.280]  And I noticed that a lot of our whole plant,
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.720]  the stuff that's really vigorous,
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:05.120]  will give kind of a red tint to it.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:07.280]  I don't know if that's because we've got red dirt
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.640]  and there's more iron in our dirt.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:10.960]  I'm just not sure on that.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.520]  But yeah, so those are two of the ferments that I use.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.920]  And then I mix the tomato one here
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:19.440]  with cucumber, squash, watermelons.
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:24.440]  I think that was it in that one.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.000]  And that was for my finishing.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.640]  So yeah, there's some.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:31.680]  All right, on to hash.
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:32.520]  Yeah.
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:37.720]  Okay, so let's talk about flour rosin first.
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:41.580]  So everyone can just start hating and get that over with.
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.920]  And I just, again, going back to what we talked about
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.000]  at the very beginning,
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.160]  I'm talking about the meat and bones of things.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.420]  I'm not talking about all the methodology with it.
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:53.360]  That's for you to decide however you wanna decide it.
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.120]  And so the meat and the bones is this.
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.080]  You have a joint.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.100]  Let's say it's one gram.
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:00.520]  We're gonna use that for ease.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.680]  You have one gram joint of say sunshine bowl.
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:04.800]  I'm gonna be using it today.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.440]  It's across the shaggy roots.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.960]  He's a breeder here in the state does.
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.120]  Incredible strain.
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:12.440]  And I have one gram.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.280]  Shout out to him too,
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.100]  because he's a cool guy.
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:14.940]  Yeah, shaggy roots, dude.
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:15.760]  He's so cool.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.920]  He's giving away seeds today on vet.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.280]  Anyway, he's just, there's so much about that guy.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.540]  I just can't, it's so much positivity there.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.060]  I just, awesome.
[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:26.820]  Anyway, you get a whole joint
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:28.300]  and I'm making these numbers up.
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.540]  So I don't have the COA on these,
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:33.180]  but let's say that joint is 20% cannabinoids.
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:35.420]  Let's say that flower is 20% cannabinoids.
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:38.900]  So you have a thousand milligrams of plant material,
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:43.900]  plant material, 200 milligrams of that is cannabinoids.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:47.260]  80, 800 milligrams of that is plant material,
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.220]  cellulose essentially.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:52.940]  You're telling me you're going to smoke 80% plant material
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:54.600]  to receive 20% medicine.
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.060]  When you squish flower rosin,
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:02.540]  you eliminate a majority of that 80%.
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.020]  So you make a more superior product than flower.
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:07.900]  I'm not saying to knock,
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.500]  to throw flower out the door and not smoke joints.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.740]  I'm just saying if the goal is health
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.400]  and the goal is to inhale things
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:16.800]  that have less particulate matter,
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:19.440]  getting a rosin press and squishing your own flower rosin,
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.520]  regardless of what Instagram says,
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.840]  is a cleaner, healthier way to consume your cannabinoids.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:28.180]  I'm not saying joints are bad.
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:30.220]  I'm not saying that, you know,
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.320]  I hope you guys hear me.
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.380]  I hope that's clear enough.
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:37.840]  I'm just saying flower rosin is far superior to just flower,
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:42.160]  but flower rosin is not as superior as hash rosin is
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.720]  by any means.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:45.920]  There are some hash rosins in the state of Oklahoma
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:47.940]  that are not superior to flower rosin,
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.360]  but for the most part,
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:53.460]  the rule would be hash rosins way cleaner
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:55.960]  and less particulate matter than flower rosin.
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:59.080]  Now, you can take flower rosin
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.520]  and put it in 37 micron or 25 micron bags,
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  and you eliminate more particulate matter.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:09.600]  Again, more, less particulate matter,
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.740]  more cannabinoids in your end,
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:14.640]  whatever it is you're making at the end,
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:15.680]  and that's the goal.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:17.880]  If you want to remove a bunch of plant material
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.420]  out of your joints, you can do that.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:23.320]  I learned the value of flower rosin in 2020
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.600]  whenever I moved out here,
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:26.280]  and I didn't have a bunch of hash,
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.980]  but I had tons of flower from my harvest.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.800]  And so I was like, okay, smoke some joints, whatever,
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.240]  start hacking, coughing,
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.240]  stop doing that for two or three weeks
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:41.040]  and just use concentrates, just flower rosin.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:42.200]  It was way better off.
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.360]  Don't hack, don't cough as much.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:47.680]  Concentrates really do hold that cleanliness for the future.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.360]  And I'm not saying flower rosin's just clean, wonderful,
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:53.320]  go show it off on IG because there's haters
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:56.200]  and they'll tell you all the reasons why it's shit,
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.420]  but it's cleaner than flower.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:03.280]  And that's why I want to show everyone how I do this today.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.880]  So it's just, it's cleaner.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:07.360]  It's not my preferred oil to go to,
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:10.640]  but it's way better off than some CRCBHO.
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.880]  Are we doing a live press today?
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:14.720]  Yeah, we'll do some live presses.
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:16.480]  Amazing.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.040]  So this wooden thing here is a janky ass wooden thing,
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:22.360]  has nothing to do with the press.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.960]  It has everything to do with the camera angle.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.640]  My buddy, he goes by Green Agricultural Services.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.520]  He's like, the farmers are gonna take over.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.200]  We're masters of none.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.720]  And it's like, yeah, we can do just about anything,
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.500]  but we're never a master at really anything.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:41.140]  So that's some farmer tech right there.
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:43.940]  And that's how I want you guys to just go through this today
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:47.260]  is this is just someone that's trying to make cleaner meds
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.580]  for himself and for others.
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:51.460]  Am I still on?
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:53.980]  See the timer going?
[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:54.980]  Okay, I just didn't see.
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:56.740]  It's all you right now.
[02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:59.780]  Not only are you on, you're featured.
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.540]  I got the stage.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.900]  Let me go turn my AC back on, back down.
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:05.980]  It was freezing up on me.
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:06.820]  One second.
[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:11.990]  All right, Layton, we got some dead time.
[02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.830]  Fill it up.
[02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.830]  No, he's back.
[02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:17.670]  You were live.
[02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:18.910]  Filled it with a laugh.
[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:21.390]  Yeah, you guys are already talking smack, man.
[02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:23.190]  I was only gone for like 30 seconds.
[02:13:23.190 --> 02:13:24.910]  And you guys were all.
[02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:26.510]  Cleaner uses me as a tool.
[02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:30.710]  Conceptually, I liked how you were like,
[02:13:30.710 --> 02:13:32.230]  anybody who wants to hate on this,
[02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:34.270]  just get it out of the way all at once.
[02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:37.190]  Conceptually, I like that idea where if anyone,
[02:13:37.190 --> 02:13:39.150]  if like 10 people hate on something,
[02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:40.750]  and they just all get it done
[02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:43.990]  so that the chat for like an hour straight doesn't,
[02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:46.750]  it's like unrelenting hate on whatever
[02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:48.790]  the thing is they're hating on.
[02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:52.030]  So some advice I'm gonna share with this as well
[02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:55.670]  is I've prepped most of the stuff
[02:13:55.670 --> 02:13:57.750]  so that this wouldn't be too long today,
[02:13:57.750 --> 02:14:00.270]  but I've left a prep of each one
[02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:02.630]  so that you guys can see how I'm gonna prep it.
[02:14:03.710 --> 02:14:06.550]  If you're prepping flour resin, you're like me,
[02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:08.590]  and you're in a room where this room
[02:14:08.590 --> 02:14:10.510]  is a multi-use room for us on the farm.
[02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:12.990]  We've got freezers in here that'll be full of turkeys
[02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:15.550]  at the end of next week in time for Thanksgiving.
[02:14:15.550 --> 02:14:17.310]  Right now, they're full of plant material,
[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:18.470]  and in the next three to four days,
[02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:19.750]  they'll be out of that.
[02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:21.790]  All the plant material will be turned into hash.
[02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:23.190]  I wanna say this with hash.
[02:14:23.190 --> 02:14:24.430]  Layton, hold your cork, buddy.
[02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:25.370]  Here it comes.
[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:29.030]  Hash on the farm, in my opinion,
[02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:33.070]  is one of the most regenerative ways to farm cannabis
[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:36.070]  for the simple purpose of if I get a 5% return
[02:14:36.590 --> 02:14:39.470]  on my plant material, I keep 95% of the carbon
[02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:42.990]  that I produced on this farm to put back on the farm,
[02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:45.030]  and I'm not sending it to people to smoke
[02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:46.510]  and to throw it in their ashtrays.
[02:14:46.510 --> 02:14:47.950]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:49.670]  I'm just saying, but if you're producing,
[02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:52.070]  like my family produces corn,
[02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:55.410]  and they move 250,000 pounds of corn off of one field.
[02:14:55.410 --> 02:14:57.470]  That's 250,000 pounds of carbon.
[02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:59.630]  Something had to make that, and you're removing it.
[02:14:59.630 --> 02:15:01.190]  I hope you're putting that back,
[02:15:01.190 --> 02:15:02.590]  and it's the same thing on the farm.
[02:15:02.590 --> 02:15:05.150]  I saw it this year with my bio, with my hash reactor.
[02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:09.350]  It was like, oh, oh, this changes things.
[02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:11.690]  The carbon that I worked my ass off
[02:15:11.690 --> 02:15:14.630]  to allow the microbes to work stays here,
[02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:17.150]  and that means that my amendments are gonna be
[02:15:17.150 --> 02:15:19.110]  less and less every single year,
[02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:22.370]  because if you put 10 pounds of amendments in your soil,
[02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:25.010]  and you pull 10 pounds of plant material out,
[02:15:27.230 --> 02:15:28.670]  where'd it come from?
[02:15:28.670 --> 02:15:29.950]  It's a balance sheet, man.
[02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:31.790]  You aren't gonna cheat it.
[02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.390]  You do get some from sunshine.
[02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:36.590]  You do gain like 20 to 30% of the weight
[02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:39.610]  just by carbon and sunshine of the material,
[02:15:39.610 --> 02:15:42.990]  but really, and don't quote me on the 20 to 30%.
[02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:45.050]  That's what I've heard on forums and stuff.
[02:15:45.050 --> 02:15:46.590]  You keep that with the sunshine.
[02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:48.390]  So it's like, why not?
[02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:52.310]  Again, shout out Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.830]  Using hash water on your farm.
[02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:56.350]  I've got a five-gallon bucket that's fermenting.
[02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:57.630]  I've got another five-gallon bucket
[02:15:57.630 --> 02:15:59.470]  that has plant material in it with it.
[02:15:59.470 --> 02:16:01.410]  Those are all gonna be put back on the farm.
[02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:03.690]  That's part of the hash prep process.
[02:16:03.690 --> 02:16:05.650]  Make sure that your preps are ready.
[02:16:05.650 --> 02:16:08.010]  And another thing, this room is multi-use.
[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:09.370]  So whenever I'm in a room like this,
[02:16:09.370 --> 02:16:11.850]  and I'm gonna be dealing with flower rosin and hash rosin,
[02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:13.750]  and I'm trying to do a setting of that,
[02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:15.410]  I'm gonna do the flower rosin prep
[02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:18.450]  before I really scrub the whole place down,
[02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:21.410]  because your flower is flaky, and it breaks,
[02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:22.770]  and it does things.
[02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:24.490]  And so you get that shit everywhere,
[02:16:24.490 --> 02:16:27.730]  and then your hash rosin ends up with flower flakes in it,
[02:16:27.730 --> 02:16:29.810]  and you didn't mean to, but it just happened.
[02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:32.970]  So I've already prepped most of the flower.
[02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:35.690]  I'm gonna do the flower prep and the press
[02:16:35.690 --> 02:16:38.210]  at the end of all the pressing of the hash.
[02:16:38.210 --> 02:16:40.250]  Then that way I'll have everything cleaned up,
[02:16:40.250 --> 02:16:41.890]  and I'll be ready to come in with the flower rosin
[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:43.570]  if I make a mess, big deal.
[02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:44.490]  Hash rosin out of the way.
[02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:46.330]  So that's a tip for the flower rosin.
[02:16:48.810 --> 02:16:51.530]  Just quickly, can you rotate your computer
[02:16:51.530 --> 02:16:53.890]  to show us the rest of the room?
[02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:54.730]  Yeah.
[02:16:56.410 --> 02:16:57.250]  Totally can.
[02:16:57.250 --> 02:16:59.870]  So I can visualize where the turkeys hang.
[02:17:01.170 --> 02:17:03.810]  Don't have turkeys hanging in here,
[02:17:03.810 --> 02:17:05.690]  but you can see I've got the Christmas lights,
[02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:08.210]  because, well, Santa might show up.
[02:17:10.450 --> 02:17:12.610]  So I've got two grow lights,
[02:17:12.610 --> 02:17:14.370]  and then there's trellising right here,
[02:17:14.370 --> 02:17:15.650]  and that's just to hang plants.
[02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:18.330]  I'll get into that with hash production too.
[02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:23.330]  That's a five by five tray on the floor,
[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.410]  like a drained waste tray down there,
[02:17:25.410 --> 02:17:27.410]  and that's where all the water sits in.
[02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:30.850]  And by the way, we need to get you sponsored by Polypro.
[02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:33.650]  Peli, or whatever that is.
[02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:35.850]  Yeah, the insulation.
[02:17:35.850 --> 02:17:36.690]  Yeah.
[02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:45.950]  Peter, put him on full screen for the demonstration.
[02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:46.830]  I would like to point out
[02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:48.570]  before you start the demonstration, Andy,
[02:17:48.570 --> 02:17:51.230]  that you're really the only one,
[02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:52.670]  when I've reached out to several people,
[02:17:52.670 --> 02:17:55.490]  that was willing to not only talk and educate,
[02:17:55.530 --> 02:17:59.810]  but show live on air in real time your method.
[02:17:59.810 --> 02:18:03.330]  So again, man, we really, really appreciate the fact
[02:18:03.330 --> 02:18:04.330]  that you're going out of your way.
[02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:07.490]  It takes several days to prep for all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:08.490]  So thank you for your time,
[02:18:08.490 --> 02:18:09.530]  and I feel like a lot of people
[02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:13.170]  are definitely going to learn today.
[02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:15.170]  Awesome.
[02:18:15.170 --> 02:18:17.770]  Yeah, dude, I appreciate that.
[02:18:17.770 --> 02:18:21.730]  My history is I was a coffee roaster for 10 years.
[02:18:21.730 --> 02:18:22.650]  I was self-taught,
[02:18:22.650 --> 02:18:24.810]  and whenever you're learning home roast and coffee,
[02:18:25.170 --> 02:18:26.250]  you can find every forum in the world
[02:18:26.250 --> 02:18:29.090]  to teach you how to make coffee with a popcorn popper
[02:18:29.090 --> 02:18:31.370]  or some of the $500 or $600 coffee roasters
[02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:32.530]  that are out there.
[02:18:32.530 --> 02:18:34.330]  But as soon as you went commercial,
[02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:35.770]  everyone was going to charge you two grand
[02:18:35.770 --> 02:18:37.130]  to even open their mouth.
[02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:39.690]  And it was like, really?
[02:18:39.690 --> 02:18:42.650]  I thought it was like this big welcoming community.
[02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:45.690]  And so I wanted to make sure that no matter how big I got,
[02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:47.890]  that that was something that I always offered people.
[02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:49.290]  So if people wanted to know about roasting,
[02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:50.490]  I was willing to share with them.
[02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:52.210]  Same thing with solventless.
[02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:53.210]  The more people that get in it,
[02:18:53.250 --> 02:18:54.530]  the more opportunities we have
[02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:57.210]  to kick out the old bad players.
[02:18:57.210 --> 02:18:59.330]  Because if you're really good and you're talented
[02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:01.930]  and you're up and coming and you're 18 or 20 right now,
[02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:05.330]  like I really hope you pass everyone in the industry.
[02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:07.490]  And the only way that I can get that out to you
[02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:09.730]  is just to educate with what I know,
[02:19:09.730 --> 02:19:11.010]  and then you can build on that.
[02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:15.970]  A huge, huge shout out to Ken Wall and Low Temp Plates.
[02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:19.490]  They came to Oklahoma two and a half, three years ago,
[02:19:19.490 --> 02:19:21.930]  brought them in to do a teaching at the coffee shop
[02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:24.690]  that we owned and a huge shout out to them.
[02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:26.330]  A lot of this tech comes from them.
[02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:28.010]  Another one is Pedro's Grow Room.
[02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.010]  He goes by Pedro's Glassroom right now.
[02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:31.890]  I did a class with him.
[02:19:31.890 --> 02:19:33.210]  He offers classes.
[02:19:33.210 --> 02:19:35.330]  They're not expensive and you can do,
[02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:38.330]  I think mine was like 50 bucks.
[02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:40.250]  And it was like a group class and he just taught
[02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:41.730]  just how to press rosin.
[02:19:41.730 --> 02:19:45.010]  The bag folding that I do is because of him.
[02:19:45.010 --> 02:19:45.850]  So-
[02:19:45.850 --> 02:19:46.690]  You're talking about Pedro from Colorado?
[02:19:46.690 --> 02:19:47.530]  Yeah, yeah, Pedro from Colorado.
[02:19:47.530 --> 02:19:49.250]  Yeah, that dude's super solid, man.
[02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:50.090]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:52.410]  I was sharing, I don't really know him.
[02:19:52.410 --> 02:19:56.530]  I just interacted with him some and he taught me online
[02:19:56.530 --> 02:19:59.850]  how to fold rosin bags or how to put them in the right way.
[02:19:59.850 --> 02:20:02.250]  Just little tips and the tips,
[02:20:02.250 --> 02:20:03.890]  like if you're dealing with rosin and you're like,
[02:20:03.890 --> 02:20:06.730]  oh, 4% yield or 3% yield,
[02:20:06.730 --> 02:20:09.090]  that could literally be how you folded the bag.
[02:20:10.090 --> 02:20:11.890]  And when you're a commercial producer
[02:20:11.890 --> 02:20:13.730]  and you're trying to make money with it,
[02:20:15.250 --> 02:20:16.530]  that could be the difference.
[02:20:16.530 --> 02:20:19.650]  So I wanted to show this today because I got in the corner.
[02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:22.970]  This is how I have my hash bag set up.
[02:20:22.970 --> 02:20:24.250]  And they're just buckets.
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:29.300]  Cut at different lengths.
[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:32.780]  And I think this is props to Frenchie Cannoli for this.
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:36.500]  And then the bottom one here.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:39.100]  The bottom one's really long.
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:40.900]  Anything with printing on the outside
[02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:41.860]  will get in your hash.
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:43.660]  So do not have it anywhere near it.
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:46.540]  This is an outside bucket that's never inside.
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:50.100]  Any kind of printing will flake off, will flake off,
[02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:51.340]  and it will get in your hash
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:52.900]  and you will be pissed
[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:54.420]  because it will be probably a whole crop
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:56.140]  and you'll have this big yellow flake in there
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:57.460]  because someone needed to put their brand
[02:20:57.460 --> 02:20:58.740]  on the side of the bucket.
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:01.020]  So these buckets I got from Walmart
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:02.620]  and they don't have any stickers on them
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:03.700]  or anything like that.
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:06.260]  And that just allows the hash to fall.
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:08.660]  And then I'm dealing with one bucket.
[02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.500]  It makes collection super easy.
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.460]  It makes cleaning way easy.
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:14.300]  And the problem that a lot of people have
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:16.660]  with full mesh bags from Rosin Evo
[02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:20.220]  is the fact that right here,
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:23.780]  hash goes in there and if it gets on the bucket
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:26.060]  and you push it up against the bucket, it can break.
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:27.700]  And so you wanna be able to rinse those down.
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.420]  Bags that have like a liner
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:30.660]  prevent that from ever happening
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:32.460]  because they don't pass through.
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:33.980]  The benefit of full mesh is the fact
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:36.220]  that you can lift these big heavy bags full of water
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:37.820]  and they drain out better.
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:41.060]  You just have to understand that the issue with it
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:42.980]  can be fixed by using these buckets.
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:47.700]  You got a bucket, now you've got a solid liner right here
[02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:50.600]  and you can continue to rinse that with your wand
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:53.680]  and push that hash down into your collection at the bottom.
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.320]  Here, I'm gonna put these back.
[02:22:05.610 --> 02:22:08.170]  Oh, I didn't know it was the only one.
[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:12.290]  It's just you and me right now, Andy.
[02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:13.110]  No, I'm here.
[02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:15.410]  I'm just, I'm in the, I'm holding my camera.
[02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:16.250]  So I'm here.
[02:22:19.450 --> 02:22:20.910]  You gotta unmute yourself.
[02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:24.210]  Well, it would have made more sense
[02:22:24.210 --> 02:22:25.290]  if you had heard me singing,
[02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:26.790]  but it was just the two of us.
[02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:28.590]  And now it's not.
[02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:30.910]  Just the two of us.
[02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:32.110]  Yeah, mine wasn't that good.
[02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:33.350]  So I'm glad I was muted.
[02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:37.150]  Okay, so with Flower Rosin,
[02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:39.870]  I would say where we start all the stuff,
[02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:42.750]  biggest, most, I'll talk on the prep of Flower Rosin
[02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:44.230]  a little bit and then I'll get into hash
[02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:46.190]  and then we'll do all the Flower Rosin.
[02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:50.550]  Just quickly, do you see that question?
[02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:53.430]  Great question.
[02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:54.790]  That's exactly where I'm going right now.
[02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:56.050]  Excellent.
[02:22:56.050 --> 02:22:57.650]  So with Flower Rosin,
[02:22:57.650 --> 02:22:59.250]  one thing that you really need to make sure
[02:22:59.250 --> 02:23:03.010]  is that your flour has some moisture content in it.
[02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:05.570]  My assumption, this is an assumption,
[02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:07.050]  this is an observation,
[02:23:07.050 --> 02:23:10.610]  pass through these synopsis, these brain waves up here.
[02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:12.330]  My assumption is this,
[02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:13.610]  when there's a decent amount of moisture,
[02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:17.610]  so what I do is I put a 58 or a 62% humidity pack
[02:23:17.610 --> 02:23:21.050]  in the jar before I'm squishing a day or two before.
[02:23:21.050 --> 02:23:23.330]  So this has been sitting in the jar for two, three days.
[02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:25.290]  I'm not a huge fan of the humidity packs,
[02:23:25.330 --> 02:23:28.870]  but for this, it helps stabilize it and ensure it
[02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:32.170]  without having to deal with hydrometer and all that.
[02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.610]  So that's, I'm trying to show you guys,
[02:23:33.610 --> 02:23:36.210]  like this is a farm kid's way of doing this.
[02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:37.850]  So that's what I do.
[02:23:37.850 --> 02:23:40.970]  Moisture in your flour, this is so important.
[02:23:40.970 --> 02:23:41.970]  Moisture in your flour,
[02:23:41.970 --> 02:23:44.330]  whenever it's on the press turns to steam.
[02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:46.370]  That steam carries some of the terpenes
[02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:47.470]  and some of the oils.
[02:23:47.470 --> 02:23:50.450]  I'm not gonna go into how you're losing terpenes.
[02:23:50.450 --> 02:23:53.170]  You're squishing Flower Rosin, get over it.
[02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:57.690]  The biggest thing is, is that steam helps propel that oil
[02:23:57.690 --> 02:24:00.890]  out from the plant material and get out of that bag
[02:24:00.890 --> 02:24:03.290]  and onto that parchment and away from those plates.
[02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:04.810]  There's a huge difference.
[02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:08.090]  You can't expect, I don't even care how good a flour it is.
[02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:11.930]  If it's 35% cannabinoids and you squish it
[02:24:11.930 --> 02:24:14.850]  and it's dry as a bone, you can't expect that oil
[02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:18.010]  to be that vicious or that the viscosity
[02:24:18.010 --> 02:24:20.130]  to help propel everything out.
[02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:21.430]  You just get way better return.
[02:24:21.430 --> 02:24:23.990]  So I don't know the exact percentage
[02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:25.630]  of the humidity of my flour is.
[02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:29.630]  I just know that I put a 58 or a 62% Lovita pack
[02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:31.950]  or one of these humidity boost packs
[02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:34.190]  a couple of days before I press.
[02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:36.550]  If it's a jar that I'm pressing out of all the time,
[02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:37.910]  I'll just leave it in there.
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.640]  Right on.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.680]  Okay, so let me see here.
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.200]  So this is a, this is a Flower Rosin
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.380]  that I squished last night.
[02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:02.940]  You can see the writing on the bottom through it.
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:11.340]  People ask me, you know, how is it so clear?
[02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:13.980]  That's the 37 or the 25 U-Bag.
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:16.900]  Biggest thing, big shout out to Indica Only.
[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:20.260]  You press a lot of Flower Rosin regardless of what people say
[02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:22.500]  and that Flower Rosin still looks incredible.
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:26.620]  Some of these tips and stuff come from watching Indica Only.
[02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.700]  Again, meat and bones of things, guys.
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:31.980]  The skeletal structure of it, the foundation of it.
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.420]  Some of this stuff is not gospel,
[02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:36.980]  but the concepts behind it will help you
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:38.880]  and serve you along the way because,
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:44.220]  I mean, not everyone has J Plant Speaker Q, right?
[02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.040]  The soapy stuff.
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:48.500]  So I'm trying to figure out, will yucca root work
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.420]  and can I get yucca root out of Oklahoma, dig it up,
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:52.540]  dry it out, grind it up,
[02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:55.340]  and will it be as effective as that?
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:56.880]  I don't know until I try.
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.220]  Again, meat and bones on the thing.
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:00.220]  You're trying to create a wedding agent.
[02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:01.620]  This is that wedding agent
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:05.300]  just to see what works best in your area.
[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:06.860]  Pacific Northwest is gonna be different.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:08.580]  Northeast is gonna be different.
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:11.220]  Your flower is gonna grow completely different.
[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:15.340]  I worked this year on Duncanson buds
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:16.820]  to see how that would do.
[02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:19.260]  A wash, so you harvest, you wash them,
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.180]  and then you hang them, let them drip dry,
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:23.140]  and then you can freeze them if you want.
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:26.580]  I just put them in the dryer in here for four days,
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:29.220]  let them dry down, and then I froze them.
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:30.340]  And wash and buds seemed to work.
[02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:33.020]  That was a lemon juice baking soda mixture,
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:34.380]  and it really cleaned them up.
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:37.460]  My first wash, I've never seen a wash water that clean.
[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:39.700]  So that kind of sold it for me on that.
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:42.000]  I know some people say that it kills terpenes.
[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:46.940]  I don't feel that way, and at least not in my experience.
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:50.580]  So anyway, questions about flower rods
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:52.680]  before I jump ship on that for a bit,
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:54.380]  and then we'll come back and visit it,
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:56.380]  but I wanna get into the hash prep
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:58.220]  and all that kind of stuff.
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.860]  And I'm gonna need to, Brian, Peter,
[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:03.020]  I'm gonna need to move the cameras around,
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:04.720]  move some angles around, and things like that.
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:06.580]  So if there's things you guys want,
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:07.860]  Leighton, now's the time to rant.
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:11.240]  If you wanna get in on a rant and go for it, go for it.
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:12.940]  I'm gonna move some lights around,
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:16.300]  move some camera around if we're ready for that.
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:20.300]  And I wanna be able to, what I'll start with is,
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:24.120]  I've got some hash prep in bags ready to go,
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:25.460]  and then I've got a tray of hash
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:26.580]  that needs to be put in a bag.
[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:27.780]  And I'll be able to show you that monotonous,
[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.780]  how I do that, and then just kind of that process.
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:34.060]  But you won't be able to see me,
[02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:35.900]  because I'm literally gonna be hanging you upside down
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.300]  over the rosin press.
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:41.700]  But I'll be able to peek sideways and I'll hear you.
[02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:44.460]  You'll be able to hear me, but that'll be it.
[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:45.580]  So any questions?
[02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:47.940]  Sounds like you came prepared, which I love.
[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:51.740]  It's not often that someone's like,
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:53.460]  I actually know what we're gonna talk about it,
[02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:54.860]  and I've laid it all out.
[02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.910]  Ah.
[02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:01.750]  You're muted.
[02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:06.470]  Again, we appreciate that you're willing to show,
[02:28:06.470 --> 02:28:08.190]  basically everything that you're doing.
[02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:09.750]  And I feel like for whatever reason,
[02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:12.550]  everyone has a different reason on why they didn't want to.
[02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:15.350]  But you're really just kind of putting your money
[02:28:15.350 --> 02:28:16.310]  where your mouth is, man.
[02:28:16.310 --> 02:28:18.110]  Everything on your Instagram and all that kind of stuff
[02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:19.990]  you're talking about, open source,
[02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:23.370]  the classes should be relatively cheap,
[02:28:23.370 --> 02:28:26.550]  and just going out of your way to give the free education.
[02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:30.590]  And so I feel like, man, this is hopefully that moment
[02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:32.350]  where more and more people can see that,
[02:28:32.350 --> 02:28:35.150]  all right, not only are you farming in diversity and stuff
[02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:36.990]  with different plants and that kind of thing,
[02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:38.630]  which a lot of people obviously are trying to do
[02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:41.710]  in their basement or in their tent,
[02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:44.030]  but you're taking it to the next level with livestock.
[02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:45.430]  And I feel like in just a moment,
[02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:46.950]  you're gonna see some of the difference
[02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:49.630]  on when you're really taking it to that next level.
[02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:51.350]  And I feel like, Andy, you're that gentleman
[02:28:51.350 --> 02:28:54.890]  that's taking it to that next level in my peer group.
[02:28:54.970 --> 02:28:58.490]  I've continued to watch and see just the quality
[02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:59.810]  of the stuff that you're producing.
[02:28:59.810 --> 02:29:01.270]  And so we're about to see that live.
[02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:03.530]  And again, we really, really appreciate that.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:09.920]  You're muted.
[02:29:14.610 --> 02:29:15.970]  Nope, you're still muted.
[02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.970]  Think you have like fat thumbs right now
[02:29:20.970 --> 02:29:22.610]  where you're like double tapping.
[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:28.940]  I do command D and it kept popping up
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:31.100]  as a command search or something.
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:35.140]  Anyway, so a lot of people have done,
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:37.660]  you've seen a lot of tech out there called jar tech,
[02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.580]  not jar tech of the Ross and after the press.
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:45.000]  I'm talking about a jar test, not tech, it would be a test.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.740]  And that's where you take your hash
[02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:49.740]  and you shake it in a jar and you kind of determine
[02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:51.660]  if it's gonna be worth a shit or not.
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:53.740]  And if it's gonna wash well or not.
[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:56.460]  And there's, for me, again, this goes back to observation,
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:30:00.140]  wanting to share as much data as you can possibly get,
[02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:02.100]  as much as you can possibly observe,
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:03.540]  that's what you wanna do.
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:06.980]  And so with me, I'm wanting to observe how that resin reacts
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:08.800]  after I harvest it from the plant.
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.060]  Can I harvest it fresh?
[02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:12.420]  Can it be fresh frozen or can it not?
[02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:14.260]  Some strains won't let you.
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.820]  In fact, most strains don't like fresh frozen.
[02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:18.520]  They just break apart in the water.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:20.180]  And what I mean by that is your trichome heads
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:21.980]  go in the water and you start washing it
[02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:24.060]  and they break apart and then all your terpenes
[02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:28.220]  are in the water and then your bags get all oily and gross
[02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:30.180]  and you can never collect it.
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:33.340]  A trichome head that's intact is collectible.
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:35.740]  A trichome head that's broken apart is not,
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:36.640]  you don't get the oil.
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:41.640]  You may get the wax, but like, no one wants that.
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.980]  I mean, that's not something you really want
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:44.820]  in your material.
[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:48.580]  And so trying to understand the plant
[02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:50.460]  before you do what I've done,
[02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:52.100]  and that's washed two whole plants
[02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:53.460]  that were supposed to hash.
[02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:56.220]  The breeder told me they were bred for hash.
[02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:59.420]  So I grew them and I pheno-hunted 20
[02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:01.820]  and I picked my favorite two and I grew them up
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:04.100]  and they're covered in trichomes.
[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:06.740]  Put both of them in a tub, start washing with my friends.
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:09.940]  And then first time I pour, it's just the whole top
[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:12.940]  looks like the water that comes off a Walmart parking lot.
[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:14.780]  Just oil sheen.
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:17.700]  It's like, oh crap, this ain't gonna be good.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.740]  Two whole plants and I got like half a lubey
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:21.700]  worth of what looks like a lubey.
[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:24.100]  And it was so disappointing to me.
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:27.800]  Had I known what I knew after that wash,
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:30.760]  I would have just taken that material and put it as flour.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:32.420]  There's some strains or some cultivars
[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:33.500]  that just do not hash.
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:34.980]  In fact, most don't.
[02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:39.020]  And so the goal is to understand which ones do.
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:42.500]  And if we're not pheno-hunting, and I'm not knocking GMO,
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:43.320]  I love GMO.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:45.500]  I think GMO needs to be in a lot of places
[02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:48.460]  and a lot of stables as far as for hash makers
[02:31:48.460 --> 02:31:50.640]  just because they can pay the bills.
[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:53.160]  But you're searching for phenos and stuff.
[02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:54.640]  You're going through a lot of different plants.
[02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:55.600]  Some bust in the water.
[02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:58.320]  Some don't even harvest.
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:31:59.640]  Some you look at them, you're like,
[02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:00.760]  oh, they're covered in trichomes.
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:03.760]  And you roll it up, you smoke it, it works.
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:05.560]  You know, you're higher in health.
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:07.160]  Your head's peeled back.
[02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:08.800]  You can't get it in the water, it won't hash.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:10.480]  It won't dry sift, it won't anything.
[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:11.880]  So you wanna figure that out.
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:13.000]  And I wanna know it ahead of time
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.740]  before I go stick a third of my crop in the water.
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:18.840]  So a lot of people do that with the jar test.
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:20.640]  The jar, they put ice in it, they put water in it,
[02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:25.640]  they put 20 grams of fresh frozen material in it.
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:28.320]  And then you let it sit and you use that
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:31.740]  as like a little hash water or hash thing.
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:32.920]  I'm gonna start with those here.
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:35.160]  I'm gonna show you guys how to do that.
[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:36.720]  I've already got it prepped out.
[02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:38.720]  And then I'll show you after a bit
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:42.080]  how I test to see how that works.
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:44.080]  There's a gentleman, I don't know his name.
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:46.140]  He took an Aeropress coffee maker.
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:50.620]  So it's an Aeropress, it looks like a big syringe.
[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:53.740]  And he built on with, I think a 3D printer,
[02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:54.940]  different layers.
[02:32:54.940 --> 02:32:57.660]  And so he would put different microns in each layer.
[02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:58.940]  And then you take that hash water
[02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:02.500]  and you press that Aeropress and it filters through.
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:05.300]  So you're able to take a test sample and say,
[02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:09.560]  it's yielding X amount on this small wash.
[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:11.460]  I thought that was incredible.
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:13.620]  I just don't have the money for that tester.
[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:16.400]  So I had to think, what do I use
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:19.680]  to be able to still filter my hash water out
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:21.920]  instead of doing what most people do?
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:23.480]  And that's, they just look at the bottom
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:25.800]  and they're like, oh, there's a lot of hash.
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:30.800]  And while that works, observation and the more you do it,
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.760]  you'll understand what a lot of hash is
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.840]  and what not a lot of hash is.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.240]  You've got to practice, so keep, start practicing.
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:39.600]  What do they say, 10,000 hours to a mastery?
[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.680]  Like start now, start shaking,
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:44.380]  start shaking buds in water and seeing.
[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:46.000]  Probably a lot of you will be really upset
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.320]  whenever you start shaking buds in water
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:49.120]  and realize that there's no trichomes on it
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:51.600]  and you've been smoking shitty ass weed.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.000]  But put them in, shake them up.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.820]  So I'm gonna show you guys that
[02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:58.120]  and then you shake it for a bit and then you let it sit.
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:33:59.920]  I'm gonna let it sit and then I'll show you guys here
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:03.440]  after a bit how actually a tech to do that
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:06.840]  without that filter that you can just do
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:08.680]  if you're in a hash room, one second.
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.520]  So once we get to our professional level of show production,
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:18.920]  we'll have like, you know, on cooking shows
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:21.200]  where like they're making a lasagna
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.640]  and they already have one that's fully cooked in the oven
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:25.080]  so we don't have to sit there waiting
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:26.840]  for an hour for it to cook.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:29.600]  So like he'll like put something in the harvest right
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:32.360]  and like pull something out at the same time.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:33.640]  Martha Stewart style.
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:34.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:37.200]  And he's back.
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:41.200]  So I just prepped a lot of this stuff
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.380]  to feel like a cook on TV.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:48.200]  This will only take me 30 seconds.
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:50.760]  You know, just a little of that.
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:51.600]  That's what I was saying.
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:52.420]  A little of this, a little of that.
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:55.000]  And it's like, okay, you prepped something.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.640]  How's that chicken done in five minutes?
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.760]  You know, you did it in five seconds.
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:03.560]  Okay, so what I'm doing here is I have one pint jar
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.640]  and I put them in here just so they would stay.
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:08.720]  I have one pint jar that I'm gonna leave empty.
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:09.960]  I have two bags.
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.120]  Pint jar that I'm gonna leave empty.
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:12.800]  I'm actually gonna fill this up with water
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:14.760]  about two thirds of the way up
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:15.960]  and just let it sit to the side.
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:16.840]  There's a reason for that.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:19.200]  This is rinse water, is what this is gonna be.
[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:27.940]  Is there anything special about your rinse water?
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:31.480]  Is it RO or mineralized or?
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:33.960]  Well water.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:37.980]  Generally I use, not generally,
[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:39.940]  I always use filtered water for any of my hashing,
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:42.780]  but today for this, I just went and got well water.
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:46.260]  I didn't really matter for me.
[02:35:46.260 --> 02:35:49.580]  But yes, use filtered water, RO water.
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:51.860]  I'm curious if RO water doesn't make trichomes
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:53.220]  bust a little bit more,
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:55.380]  just because it's such an empty water.
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:56.300]  I say it's empty.
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:35:57.300]  It's like an empty sponge.
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:35:58.820]  It can absorb a lot.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:01.860]  So I'm wondering if that's not allowing certain terpenes
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:03.340]  to absorb into it.
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:06.380]  My history being in coffee, RO water brews coffee
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:08.700]  completely different than non-RO water.
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:10.060]  Filtered water.
[02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:11.580]  It's stripping minerals.
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:12.420]  Yep.
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:14.140]  Literally stripping minerals, of course.
[02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:15.140]  It's acid.
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:16.500]  Strong as one possible.
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:18.820]  I've got a cork jar.
[02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:19.660]  I put some ice in it.
[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:20.540]  This is in the freezer.
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:22.300]  I don't know if this is enough ice or not.
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:23.860]  I think it's probably too much,
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:26.740]  but we're gonna see.
[02:36:26.740 --> 02:36:29.500]  First off first, make sure your water's always really cold
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.220]  before you go stick plants in it.
[02:36:31.220 --> 02:36:32.540]  Especially if you're washing ash,
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:34.220]  make sure your water's like as cold
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:36.020]  as you can possibly get it beforehand.
[02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:37.460]  Colder the better.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:41.300]  Obviously a brick of ice is too cold, but yeah.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:44.020]  So I'm just using, I'm just pouring filtered water
[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.820]  in a cork jar with some ice.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:47.060]  Leave some head space at top
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:52.060]  because you got to put in 20 grams of plant material.
[02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:53.740]  I'm gonna give this a shake
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:57.260]  so I can get the ice to cool down the water
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:36:58.960]  and we don't have to wait forever.
[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:01.420]  And I'll explain this.
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:04.100]  These are two rosin bags.
[02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:05.660]  See where I'm going with this.
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:10.620]  This is a 37 micron and this is a 160 micron.
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:13.420]  Whenever I filter hash, I run them through bags
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:15.340]  that are 45 microns.
[02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:17.180]  So 37 is a little bit smaller.
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:19.260]  Some people run a 25 on their bottom.
[02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:22.660]  Whenever I make hash, I run 45 to 149
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:24.820]  and I'll put a 73 in the middle or a 90 in the middle,
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:28.460]  depending on what strains I want to keep the 73 or the 90.
[02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:29.300]  I will say this.
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.820]  If your hash rosin at the end is a little bit dirty
[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:33.220]  or you're just bummed out with it
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:35.500]  and you just don't really seem that it's that great,
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  keep the 45 to 72 separate and squish the 73 to 149
[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:41.980]  and see how that tastes.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.260]  If that tastes good separately squished
[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:47.140]  or maybe you don't like it,
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:52.140]  add whatever ratio of 45 that you have to that.
[02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:57.380]  Let's say you have 30 grams of hash at the end.
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:02.380]  20 grams is the 73 to 149 and 10 grams is the 45 you bag.
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:06.100]  So that's a one to two ratio.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:09.880]  So if you take your dabber and you dab two thirds
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:11.460]  and then a third of the 45,
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:13.340]  so two thirds of the 73, a third,
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:15.340]  you'll get to taste what it tastes like together
[02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:17.000]  without actually putting it together
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.540]  and being stuck with that.
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:20.100]  If you do like it, put them together,
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:22.880]  whip them up, put them in the jar, who cares?
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:23.820]  It's whatever.
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:27.780]  I've noticed in my experiences, whenever I add the 45,
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:31.140]  I have a little bit more of a body to the smoke.
[02:38:31.140 --> 02:38:34.280]  There's a little bit more of legs to the whole thing.
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:35.740]  That's not always the case
[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:37.540]  and that body is not always the best thing.
[02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:40.820]  Sometimes it's a little bit harsh.
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:42.740]  Sometimes that 45 bag can be that way.
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:45.920]  So you don't have to add them all at once,
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:47.340]  but you totally can.
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.020]  And I wanna make sure that everyone knows
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:50.960]  this is more of a broad spectrum.
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:52.340]  This is not a full spectrum.
[02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:55.940]  Whenever you do hash, we don't have the 25 in there.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:58.460]  So that's what these bags are gonna be for.
[02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:00.860]  So I've got the water, ice is in there
[02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:16.420]  because I'm not a caveman.
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:19.940]  Says 26, it's full of it.
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:21.260]  Ah, that's.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:25.100]  You're sounding fine without the headphones.
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:26.740]  Yeah, yeah, I just can't hear.
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:27.900]  Get rid of the headphones.
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:29.140]  Oh, you can't hear?
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:30.180]  I just can't hear, yeah.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:31.180]  I have to pull the headphones
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:33.700]  because my auxiliary cord was supposed to be a lot longer
[02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:34.540]  than it was today.
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:39.540]  So anyway, ice water, 20 grams of fresh frozen.
[02:39:42.100 --> 02:39:46.460]  Now I'll show y'all how this is prepped before it went in.
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:49.840]  Your water leaves are taken off, okay?
[02:39:50.940 --> 02:39:53.140]  So really any leaf that doesn't have a trichome on it,
[02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:55.940]  any leaf that doesn't, just cut it off.
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:58.780]  Some tips for that, do it two to three days
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:01.060]  before you're planning on harvesting.
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:02.680]  Go clip off all those leaves.
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:04.540]  You're gonna cause a stress response in that plant.
[02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:06.900]  It's gonna grow trichomes a little bit heavier
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.660]  and you're really gonna be able to,
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:11.300]  then whenever harvest comes,
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:12.660]  you don't really have to do that much.
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:14.020]  And you're not opening wounds
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:15.820]  that the plant hasn't already fixed.
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:19.700]  Because every time you cut, you open a wound on that plant
[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:21.620]  and that's an opportunity for chlorophyll
[02:40:21.620 --> 02:40:23.740]  to get into the wash at the end.
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:26.420]  So clip all your leaves two to three days before,
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.920]  like prep for a cut.
[02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:32.140]  There's a gold bar for you.
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:38.940]  So I'm gonna let this sit for a bit.
[02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:40.540]  Answer any questions you guys may have.
[02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:42.860]  That'll get that soaking
[02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:45.100]  and then I'll get to shaking here after a bit.
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:46.300]  Yeah.
[02:40:49.210 --> 02:40:52.050]  You know, I just wanted to make a comment about observation
[02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:55.450]  because I think that more people need to pay attention.
[02:40:55.450 --> 02:41:00.130]  When I do a soil sample, 50% of what I'm gonna do
[02:41:00.130 --> 02:41:01.970]  as far as microscopy is concerned
[02:41:01.970 --> 02:41:04.550]  is observation before I look at it.
[02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:07.690]  So half of the energy I put into looking around
[02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:09.330]  where I'm collecting the sample.
[02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:12.250]  And again, on the farm,
[02:41:12.250 --> 02:41:14.730]  that's what's gonna teach you the fastest
[02:41:14.730 --> 02:41:16.490]  what works and what doesn't work.
[02:41:16.970 --> 02:41:18.890]  And paying attention to what nature does.
[02:41:18.890 --> 02:41:20.290]  So thank you for bringing that up
[02:41:20.290 --> 02:41:22.810]  because I think that's something that we've lost,
[02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:27.090]  because we don't have time or we don't make it.
[02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:30.130]  We have other things vying for our attention
[02:41:30.130 --> 02:41:33.250]  and they've dressed it up in the fanciest clothes
[02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:38.010]  and the most stimulating everything and we're there.
[02:41:38.010 --> 02:41:39.210]  I don't mean to get all woo woo,
[02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:43.410]  but like this is made of crystals.
[02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:46.270]  Just think about that.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:50.960]  We're watching crystals.
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:55.240]  Layton's cork is tingling right now.
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:57.040]  You're saying all the right things.
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:41:57.880]  Oh, look at that.
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:58.720]  Oh, look at that.
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:41:59.540]  Oh, look at that.
[02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:00.380]  Oh, look at that.
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:02.200]  What movie is it?
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:03.720]  Without a paddle?
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:04.560]  Have you seen that movie?
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.080]  You're like, I don't mean to sound woo woo.
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:07.920]  Layton's like, I like woo woo.
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.160]  Where the guy's got the armadillo hat on
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:12.360]  and it like protects the raids.
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.680]  Like we have armadillos out here.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:17.320]  I may do another show and get an armadillo hat.
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.220]  There you go.
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.340]  So people will take us serious.
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:21.180]  Finally.
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:26.260]  Okay, so I've had it sitting
[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:29.020]  and I know that it's ice cold and it's fresh frozen.
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.260]  So I'm just gonna give it a shake.
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:33.220]  I feel like there's too much ice in here.
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.780]  You want it cold, you don't necessarily need the ice.
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:41.980]  Again, this is not commercial.
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:44.900]  I would never use my hands to do anything commercial.
[02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:45.900]  It's gonna be loud.
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:58.080]  Okay, enough ice in there so that it stays cold,
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.280]  but not so much that it beats the plants up.
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:02.560]  And I'm just gonna slowly sit here
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:05.480]  and shake this and answer any questions.
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:07.300]  I'll go ahead and tell you guys what we're gonna do
[02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:09.640]  just so you know what's coming.
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:12.800]  I'm gonna take this water.
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:14.560]  Remember, this is just clean water.
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:18.080]  And I'm gonna use it as a filter to dump.
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:22.160]  So the plan will be is whenever I wash,
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.460]  when I wash hash, I take and I put a 45 micron bag
[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:28.520]  on the bottom and then I'd stick a 73 micron bag into that.
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:31.640]  And I stick 150 into that and I stick a 160
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:32.800]  and then I stick a 220.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:38.800]  Bottom bag, top bag.
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:40.800]  This is the 37 micron.
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:45.460]  And I'm putting the 160 micron into the 37.
[02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:47.260]  Make sure your seams are on the same side.
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:48.600]  There's a reason for that.
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:50.800]  For one, the redundancy of always putting the seams
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:52.840]  on the side, make sure that you'll never do it
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:55.800]  whenever you're pressing because seams on one side
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:59.560]  allow things to go the path of least resistance.
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:01.600]  Water flows path of least resistance.
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:03.120]  Wherever water's flown before,
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.000]  it'll flow their way easier the next time.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.280]  Same thing with hash.
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:08.280]  So you're putting seams on one side.
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:10.860]  Whenever people letterpress, they're letterpressers,
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:12.760]  so they're actually stamping.
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.720]  This is an old technique.
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:15.320]  They're actually stamping like envelopes
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:16.160]  and cards and things.
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:18.640]  That's how they used to print with a press.
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:21.960]  They have to be able to line all those seams up
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.760]  because a thin piece of paper
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:25.960]  affects how that plate stamps down.
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:26.920]  This is no different.
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:29.240]  You're dealing with plates, skeletal structures.
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:30.080]  Remember that.
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:32.340]  Plates, the function of that plate,
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:34.240]  it's gonna press down evenly on this.
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:36.940]  If you put a seam on one side and a seam on the other,
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:40.140]  it's easy to go to both.
[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:41.580]  But if you put seams on one side,
[02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:43.920]  this one side will be completely squished
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:47.300]  and the side with the seams
[02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:50.140]  will be where a lot of the rosin actually passes through.
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:52.300]  So I'm doing that here.
[02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:54.100]  I will reiterate that later,
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:54.940]  but that's what I'm doing here.
[02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:59.300]  I've got a 37 micron and I shoved a 160 micron,
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:03.240]  these are rosin evolution, press bags into it.
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:05.620]  What I'm going to do with this is after I shake this water
[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:08.340]  and I get the hash in the bottom and it's all settled out,
[02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:09.980]  I'm gonna take the plant material that's in here
[02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:11.340]  and the ice and I'm gonna just dig it out
[02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:12.780]  with my hand and throw it out.
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:16.220]  And then I'm gonna pour the water through here,
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:18.820]  which is going to do on a mini tiny little scale
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:20.360]  exactly what that does.
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:21.820]  And all it does is it gives me
[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:24.140]  another opportunity to observe.
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:28.060]  That clean water is where this bag is gonna be dipped in.
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:33.060]  That's gonna kind of copy what I do with the rinser
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:34.240]  on top of the hash.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:36.160]  So it's gentle and it's just gonna be,
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:38.660]  you're gonna be dabbing this in and out, in and out.
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:43.160]  Then the question is,
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.860]  what do you do with the rosin in the bag?
[02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:47.780]  Sorry, the hash.
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:48.660]  What do you do with the hash
[02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:50.220]  and all the particulates in the bag?
[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:51.220]  You could do two things.
[02:45:51.220 --> 02:45:52.260]  And this is what I did this year
[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:53.620]  and this worked well for me.
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:56.220]  I took a plant that I wanted to see
[02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:57.680]  if it would go well fresh frozen.
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:45:59.500]  So I put it in a jar, I shook it up.
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:02.700]  I always look at the top of the jar on the top of the water.
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:03.940]  If there's an oil sheen there,
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:06.460]  I know that those trichome heads are really sensitive.
[02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:08.500]  I either need to A, continue to add
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:10.640]  more water soluble calcium to my grow
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:12.620]  and just continue to hit it with that.
[02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:15.340]  That's a good way to develop better trichome heads
[02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:16.820]  in a way healthier plant.
[02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:18.940]  Just go with it on calcium.
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:21.180]  I'm not saying go with it on heavy
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:24.540]  store bought bottled calcium.
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:27.180]  That stuff's IB status.
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:29.740]  I mean, it'll give that to the plant and then some.
[02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:32.860]  I'm saying I'm using eggshells that I've crushed up,
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:35.800]  dissolved in brown rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar.
[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:39.340]  And I use that one to 1000 ratio.
[02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:41.260]  So one milliliter per liter
[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:45.660]  I was four milliliters per gallon, something like that.
[02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:48.600]  So what I was able to see with this
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:51.860]  was that this plant could not fresh froze very easily
[02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:53.540]  or the plant that I was working with
[02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:56.800]  and the whole top was oily.
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:58.600]  So I knew that right away.
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:00.380]  So then I wanted to see if it would work better
[02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:03.940]  three to four days dry and then a jar test.
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:06.980]  So I hung up roughly about 20 grams or so,
[02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:08.980]  let them get dry where I would get them dry
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:11.660]  three, four days, five days later.
[02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:12.900]  Props Pedro's grow room.
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:15.840]  Again, this is stuff that he shared.
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:18.140]  If you've got a really greasy strain
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:19.860]  that just greases up no matter what
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:22.960]  it makes the bags a mess, hang dry for three or four days.
[02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:26.060]  I've had way better results doing that.
[02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:28.220]  I've had successful harvests
[02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:30.180]  where otherwise I wouldn't have.
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:33.060]  This lets me observe that real time.
[02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:35.340]  So I'll take this water, I'll pour it through here.
[02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:37.860]  And what I did this year was I just cut them open.
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:41.700]  And when I cut them open, they were all grease on the inside
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:44.780]  and it was like, okay, so it won't go fresh frozen.
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:46.980]  It won't hang for three or four days and then wash.
[02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:48.500]  So then what am I gonna be left with?
[02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:52.140]  It's like flour, just hanging as flour.
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:53.360]  Let it be what it is.
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:55.460]  Don't try to shove it into something else.
[02:47:56.420 --> 02:47:58.540]  And some of that flour I can press it to flyerosin.
[02:47:58.540 --> 02:48:00.620]  Some of that I can turn into RSO.
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:06.520]  Yeah, so I hope this helps.
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:09.140]  This is not the best method.
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.200]  I think the AeroPress, the filter
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:14.120]  is an incredibly accurate way.
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:16.520]  The other way that you can use these
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:19.000]  is you can take these bags after they're filled
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.560]  with the hash that we're gonna get out of here.
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:23.120]  And you just put them in your freeze dryer
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:24.540]  or put them in your freezer.
[02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:26.200]  Whenever you run the freeze dryer next,
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:28.440]  put the bags in the freeze dryer.
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:31.980]  After they're dried, now the hash should be loose.
[02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:33.620]  Now you can cut the bag open.
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:34.640]  And if you really wanted to,
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:37.680]  you could weigh the bags before you did this,
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:39.760]  before you added any water to it,
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:42.600]  and then weigh the bags after you freeze dried.
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:43.720]  And that difference in the weight
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:46.960]  should be how much hash is actually in the bag.
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:49.000]  And you can get kind of a rough estimate.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.280]  Again, the whole jar test is just to see,
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:53.140]  just to observe another observation
[02:48:53.140 --> 02:48:56.040]  without putting thousands and tens of thousands of dollars
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:58.240]  worth of plant material in an ice water bath
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:48:59.760]  that essentially ruins it
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:02.240]  if there's no hash comes out of it,
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:04.880]  which is just, it sucks, really sucks.
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:10.040]  So just shaking it.
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:11.840]  You wanna see if it'll take it.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.400]  You can beat the crap out of it if you want.
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:17.260]  In my experience, I've beat these things to pieces before,
[02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:18.840]  trying to get the heads to break.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.140]  And I'm like, oh good, they didn't break.
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:21.760]  And I can do this as fresh frozen.
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.600]  And then I washed it as fresh frozen, and they all broke.
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:26.040]  That's why this started.
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.720]  Because it was like, well, if they're gonna break in the bag
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:30.640]  or they're gonna break after the fact,
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:32.040]  I wanna actually know that.
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:35.760]  So any questions as I'm doing this?
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:37.360]  I'm just shaking a jar here.
[02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:45.150]  You know, I got a new one.
[02:49:45.150 --> 02:49:48.550]  Instead of always diversity, diversity, diversity,
[02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:51.110]  observation, observation, observation.
[02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:53.910]  Yep, yep.
[02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:55.710]  So I wrote a couple things down
[02:49:55.710 --> 02:49:58.110]  whenever it came to observation and diversity.
[02:49:58.110 --> 02:50:01.710]  And these are just things that kind of resonate with me.
[02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:04.510]  And I put, there's no complexity without diversity.
[02:50:04.510 --> 02:50:07.150]  Your diversity determines your complexity.
[02:50:07.150 --> 02:50:09.630]  And then I want everyone to know that curiosity
[02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:14.310]  or your curiousness is the secret sauce for natural farming.
[02:50:14.310 --> 02:50:15.910]  If you ever want a tip, that's it.
[02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:18.070]  Play with your curiosity, learn it.
[02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:21.430]  I did those flower, that flower FPJ we showed earlier today.
[02:50:21.430 --> 02:50:22.630]  I did that, and I got hit up
[02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:24.230]  by a couple of Korean natural farming guys,
[02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:27.190]  which I appreciate them making sure that things are done
[02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:30.670]  based on Master Cho's teachings,
[02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:32.710]  which that needs to stay.
[02:50:34.030 --> 02:50:34.870]  They reached out to me and they're like,
[02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:36.710]  hey man, I've heard that that might cause some issues
[02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:39.230]  in flower, just be careful and just test it.
[02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:41.990]  Because the thought was, is that the finished
[02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:44.350]  or the flowers that were done that I made into the FPJ
[02:50:44.350 --> 02:50:46.190]  for a minute plant juice,
[02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:48.590]  would actually signal the plant to go to flower
[02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:50.550]  or to finish, just to be done.
[02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:51.750]  And so it was like, well, I don't want to do that
[02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:53.430]  in like week two.
[02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:55.470]  So I had a couple of male plants
[02:50:55.470 --> 02:50:57.790]  and I just sprayed them on one branch and seeing what it did.
[02:50:57.790 --> 02:50:59.710]  And it didn't trigger anything.
[02:50:59.750 --> 02:51:01.110]  It didn't cause anything.
[02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:04.590]  I didn't really see any big results or small results.
[02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:06.390]  But again, it was curiosity.
[02:51:06.390 --> 02:51:08.830]  And I'm telling you, anyone that had my rosin last year,
[02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:10.610]  tried it, will say this year,
[02:51:10.610 --> 02:51:12.330]  the rosin is incredibly floral.
[02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:17.830]  Again, I added something I've never added before,
[02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:18.870]  a flower ferment.
[02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:23.930]  Yeah, so you can see here,
[02:51:27.530 --> 02:51:29.030]  we're getting some shake down.
[02:51:32.690 --> 02:51:35.770]  Reminds me of a like mint Julep.
[02:51:38.490 --> 02:51:39.790]  How do you know it's not?
[02:51:39.790 --> 02:51:41.210]  The consistency.
[02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:42.050]  Mojito.
[02:51:43.650 --> 02:51:46.170]  So I don't know many farmers that can do this.
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:53.620]  That's spicy.
[02:51:56.260 --> 02:51:57.700]  Is it bitter at all?
[02:51:57.700 --> 02:51:59.380]  Do you see that comment?
[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:01.220]  It's not bitter, it's a little spicy.
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:02.580]  Yeah.
[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:05.140]  Yeah.
[02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:06.180]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:07.260]  Glad you can do it.
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:09.660]  And it'll, hopefully it serves everyone.
[02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:12.260]  Hopefully this spurs something that spurs something
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:14.700]  that spurs something that makes it easy.
[02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:18.580]  You know, I love the AeroPress idea.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:20.540]  That's an incredible coffee maker.
[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:23.900]  And to be able to use it as a filter for hash,
[02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:25.080]  how cool is that?
[02:52:26.820 --> 02:52:29.900]  Okay, so I'm gonna set this on just a subtle,
[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:32.060]  this much of an angle,
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:34.380]  just so that it'll kind of settle to one side
[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:35.220]  while we talk.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:39.540]  And you guys can kind of see what most people do.
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:41.500]  And that's just wait until the bottom.
[02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:44.220]  Or wait and look at the bottom.
[02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:46.740]  Okay.
[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:52.060]  Okay, next questions.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:53.180]  Gonna start in on the hash.
[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:54.460]  I'll let that sit for a while,
[02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:55.440]  and then I'll just show you guys
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:57.380]  how I just run that through the filter.
[02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:00.780]  My air conditioner is doing good.
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:02.420]  My temp's good.
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:05.340]  One thing, hash room, always run a carbon filter in it
[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:06.700]  and continue to recirculate.
[02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:08.100]  I've got an AC Infinity system
[02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:10.540]  that I run on five in here at all times.
[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:13.720]  That just continues to keep any kind of dust or anything
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:16.460]  going somewhere and getting trapped,
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:18.500]  as opposed to landing in your hash
[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:19.960]  and ending up in your banger.
[02:53:25.290 --> 02:53:26.930]  Did you pick that unit up
[02:53:26.930 --> 02:53:31.130]  through the Chad Westport 15% discount?
[02:53:31.930 --> 02:53:33.150]  The AC Infinity?
[02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:36.450]  I didn't even know you could do that.
[02:53:36.450 --> 02:53:38.730]  That's an inside joke for anybody
[02:53:38.730 --> 02:53:40.290]  who's been paying attention.
[02:53:41.530 --> 02:53:44.830]  If Chad's out there, throw your discount code,
[02:53:46.770 --> 02:53:48.130]  I think it's like Westport.
[02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:52.210]  Why don't you guys have a whole list of codes
[02:53:52.210 --> 02:53:53.810]  everyone wanted to give to your audience?
[02:53:53.810 --> 02:53:55.330]  That is a very good idea,
[02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:58.050]  and it just requires time and effort to put together.
[02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:59.210]  I'm sorry, Chad.
[02:53:59.210 --> 02:54:02.090]  But yeah, it'd be good to reach out to companies
[02:54:02.090 --> 02:54:05.290]  that are solid and mentioned and be like,
[02:54:05.290 --> 02:54:07.170]  can we give a discount code out?
[02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:08.490]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:54:08.490 --> 02:54:09.330]  No, I think that'd be awesome.
[02:54:09.330 --> 02:54:12.770]  It's on my to-do list of good ideas that I...
[02:54:12.770 --> 02:54:14.570]  It's like having a podcast.
[02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:16.610]  People always ask about a pod,
[02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:19.290]  can you just put these in an audio format?
[02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:22.850]  It's number three on my to-do list right now,
[02:54:22.850 --> 02:54:25.490]  and it's been sitting there for a year and a half.
[02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:26.490]  Yeah.
[02:54:26.730 --> 02:54:28.330]  I've asked that same question,
[02:54:28.330 --> 02:54:29.730]  like, hey, when's this gonna go audio
[02:54:29.730 --> 02:54:31.650]  so I can listen to it in the garden
[02:54:31.650 --> 02:54:33.810]  without having to bump my hand on my phone
[02:54:33.810 --> 02:54:37.570]  and it go to the next whatever video?
[02:54:37.570 --> 02:54:39.530]  For me, it's like a Graham Hancock video,
[02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:40.650]  like, oh, we're gonna start talking
[02:54:40.650 --> 02:54:44.890]  about the ancient civilizations, which isn't cannabis.
[02:54:46.410 --> 02:54:47.930]  You were talking about observation, Layton.
[02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:50.970]  I put observation is the marination.
[02:54:50.970 --> 02:54:52.810]  It's where the things marinate.
[02:54:54.930 --> 02:54:56.130]  Some things we did on our farm,
[02:54:56.770 --> 02:54:59.530]  we made these zeros of the farm mistakes.
[02:54:59.530 --> 02:55:01.970]  We wanted to move our fifth wheel out here.
[02:55:01.970 --> 02:55:03.370]  And so in February, March,
[02:55:03.370 --> 02:55:05.370]  what happens here in the fall and winter
[02:55:05.370 --> 02:55:07.930]  is it rains all winter, fall and winter pretty often,
[02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:10.250]  and there's not enough heat to evaporate the moisture off,
[02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:12.690]  and there's not as much greenery there to use it up.
[02:55:12.690 --> 02:55:17.290]  And so you get this big, thick clay sand layer
[02:55:17.290 --> 02:55:20.130]  that once it shears, what's the word for that?
[02:55:20.130 --> 02:55:23.130]  It's Layton, whenever they talk about like shear strength.
[02:55:23.130 --> 02:55:24.410]  Cleavage.
[02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:25.250]  What is it?
[02:55:25.690 --> 02:55:26.530]  Cleavage.
[02:55:28.050 --> 02:55:29.130]  Wow, that's awesome.
[02:55:30.570 --> 02:55:32.410]  Who can be mad with cleavage?
[02:55:32.410 --> 02:55:34.770]  Who can be mad with cleavage?
[02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:39.770]  So whenever like, when the cleavage goes from 20 to 60,
[02:55:40.290 --> 02:55:42.810]  you end up with like trucks and pickups
[02:55:42.810 --> 02:55:44.410]  and things that are just stuck.
[02:55:44.410 --> 02:55:45.650]  We didn't know this right away.
[02:55:45.650 --> 02:55:47.450]  And where we wanted our fifth wheel
[02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:48.690]  was way on the property.
[02:55:48.690 --> 02:55:50.570]  We made more ruts and more issues.
[02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:52.970]  We got pickup stuck, we got tractor stuck,
[02:55:53.010 --> 02:55:58.050]  and it was like, if we had observed for three months,
[02:55:58.050 --> 02:56:00.410]  we would have not made that mistake.
[02:56:00.410 --> 02:56:01.930]  If I had observed some of the things
[02:56:01.930 --> 02:56:04.090]  that I did my first year, I did all those Hugo beds,
[02:56:04.090 --> 02:56:06.290]  the Ed Rosenthal book, I did those mounds.
[02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:08.050]  Here's what I learned on those mounds.
[02:56:08.050 --> 02:56:09.370]  A little mound, you have to control
[02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:11.170]  the diversity for one mound.
[02:56:11.170 --> 02:56:13.010]  Whereas if you have a Hugo bed,
[02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:14.970]  you have four plants in one bed,
[02:56:14.970 --> 02:56:17.450]  the diversity for that whole bed is spread out.
[02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:20.010]  So I'm not having to say, how do I manage this bed
[02:56:20.010 --> 02:56:21.010]  and this bed and this bed?
[02:56:21.010 --> 02:56:22.130]  If you were in pots, you would say,
[02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:23.810]  how do I manage this 50 gallon pot
[02:56:23.810 --> 02:56:26.770]  and this 100 gallon pot and this 50 gallon pot?
[02:56:26.770 --> 02:56:30.130]  I can just manage all that in one long Hugo bed.
[02:56:30.130 --> 02:56:31.970]  And so if there's issues on the bed,
[02:56:31.970 --> 02:56:34.130]  it's not this mound that I have to fix,
[02:56:34.130 --> 02:56:35.170]  it's the whole thing.
[02:56:36.570 --> 02:56:39.410]  And that was an observation my first year.
[02:56:39.410 --> 02:56:43.090]  I had one plant get stem rot and just crack over.
[02:56:43.090 --> 02:56:45.410]  And it's because of the soil horizons.
[02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:46.970]  My pasture was soaking up water
[02:56:46.970 --> 02:56:48.850]  and it was hitting the clay layer about two feet down,
[02:56:48.850 --> 02:56:50.850]  and then that was running down the hill.
[02:56:50.850 --> 02:56:53.130]  And my Hugo beds were at the bottom of the hill.
[02:56:53.130 --> 02:56:56.210]  And what I thought was a problem with moisture,
[02:56:56.210 --> 02:56:57.650]  lack of moisture ended up being a problem
[02:56:57.650 --> 02:56:59.330]  with too much moisture.
[02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:01.450]  And so I had to fight that with my plants,
[02:57:01.450 --> 02:57:04.170]  having issues with not having enough nutrients
[02:57:04.170 --> 02:57:06.410]  because we were constantly just washing the water out
[02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:08.170]  or washing the nutrients out with water,
[02:57:08.170 --> 02:57:10.330]  just running away with it.
[02:57:11.370 --> 02:57:14.650]  I would have learned that had I observed for a few months.
[02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:17.850]  I just didn't have that ability.
[02:57:17.850 --> 02:57:19.770]  You can learn so much from observation.
[02:57:19.810 --> 02:57:22.890]  The pond with the humic gases, that was observation.
[02:57:22.890 --> 02:57:24.770]  Here's one partridge peas.
[02:57:24.770 --> 02:57:28.970]  It's an annual and it's a legume, so it's nitrogen fixing.
[02:57:28.970 --> 02:57:31.730]  It's always found in pastures that are like roughed up.
[02:57:31.730 --> 02:57:32.970]  So if cattle out there,
[02:57:32.970 --> 02:57:37.530]  the disturbance actually causes a seed to germinate.
[02:57:37.530 --> 02:57:39.650]  That seed puts nitrogen back in the soil.
[02:57:39.650 --> 02:57:41.850]  Whenever the soil is fixed, that plant leaves.
[02:57:41.850 --> 02:57:43.570]  You won't see it germinating anymore.
[02:57:43.570 --> 02:57:45.850]  After three to four years, it just, it stops.
[02:57:45.850 --> 02:57:48.410]  It's an annual, it's not a perennial and it's a legume.
[02:57:48.410 --> 02:57:50.250]  What I observed on it was this,
[02:57:50.250 --> 02:57:52.010]  the ants would run up that stem
[02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:54.970]  and go to these nectar spots on the stem.
[02:57:54.970 --> 02:57:56.490]  The ants were doing that.
[02:57:56.490 --> 02:57:59.390]  Whatever plant was right near it, I had no aphid pressure.
[02:58:00.690 --> 02:58:02.490]  Why did I have no aphid pressure?
[02:58:02.490 --> 02:58:04.530]  Because I fed my ants.
[02:58:04.530 --> 02:58:07.570]  I set the table for them and they showed up.
[02:58:07.570 --> 02:58:09.370]  I just set the table somewhere else.
[02:58:10.290 --> 02:58:12.210]  And I had no clue that that was happening
[02:58:12.210 --> 02:58:15.490]  until I witnessed one plant had no aphid pressure
[02:58:15.490 --> 02:58:17.050]  and it had the same ants underneath it
[02:58:17.050 --> 02:58:19.250]  that all the other plants had.
[02:58:19.250 --> 02:58:21.450]  This one had a partridge be right next to it.
[02:58:21.450 --> 02:58:24.630]  And seeing that helped me this year with aphid pressure
[02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:26.290]  and it'll help us next year with aphid pressure.
[02:58:26.290 --> 02:58:28.230]  And anyone running anything, it's an annual.
[02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:30.250]  So it's not, you're not committing to it forever.
[02:58:30.250 --> 02:58:35.250]  It's just, and you can buy the seeds wherever, but anyway.
[02:58:35.290 --> 02:58:37.970]  Do you understand the relationship
[02:58:37.970 --> 02:58:39.410]  between ants and aphids?
[02:58:40.530 --> 02:58:41.730]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[02:58:41.730 --> 02:58:43.570]  It's actually farmed, the aphids.
[02:58:43.570 --> 02:58:46.010]  They take them, move them from place to place
[02:58:46.010 --> 02:58:46.910]  to get them to poop.
[02:58:47.730 --> 02:58:48.750]  So they can eat their food.
[02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:49.590]  Yeah.
[02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:51.070]  There's a little piece of knowledge.
[02:58:51.070 --> 02:58:52.030]  That was a great one.
[02:58:52.030 --> 02:58:53.670]  That was a great bulldog.
[02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:56.070]  Again, working with nature, not fighting it.
[02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:59.710]  Okay.
[02:58:59.710 --> 02:59:03.130]  You'll see here, I could let this settle a lot longer.
[02:59:03.130 --> 02:59:05.190]  There's a lot of plant material in there.
[02:59:06.070 --> 02:59:07.390]  That's not caterpillar poop.
[02:59:07.390 --> 02:59:09.270]  I promise that's some dark,
[02:59:09.270 --> 02:59:11.030]  it's a strain called sunshine bull.
[02:59:12.350 --> 02:59:13.510]  So I'm just gonna pull the ice
[02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:16.190]  and the plant material out of this real quick.
[02:59:16.990 --> 02:59:18.150]  And I'll be right back.
[02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:24.220]  This is great, man.
[02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:25.780]  This guy, I love this guy.
[02:59:25.780 --> 02:59:26.620]  He's better.
[02:59:26.620 --> 02:59:27.460]  We know.
[02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:30.380]  We know.
[02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:31.220]  Well, the best part about him,
[02:59:31.220 --> 02:59:32.580]  I mean, he's featured in a book
[02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:34.420]  that I feel like a lot of people look up to
[02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:36.740]  and doesn't even really talk, you know?
[02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:38.380]  So I'm glad that we were able to highlight
[02:59:38.380 --> 02:59:39.220]  a lot of that stuff.
[02:59:39.220 --> 02:59:40.900]  I feel like the same thing with Peter,
[02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:43.600]  winning a damn Emmy and not telling anybody.
[02:59:45.260 --> 02:59:47.540]  So when you do find out, it's cool, you know?
[02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:51.540]  Oh, wait, he left again.
[02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:53.100]  I can't look at the time.
[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:53.980]  When we were in high school,
[02:59:53.980 --> 02:59:55.460]  we used to hang out with his buddy.
[02:59:55.460 --> 02:59:57.580]  We'd hang out with him all the time, play sports, whatever,
[02:59:57.580 --> 02:59:58.660]  just kind of messing around.
[02:59:58.660 --> 03:00:01.340]  Then one day he asked us to come to his,
[03:00:01.340 --> 03:00:02.980]  like a ping pong tournament.
[03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:05.580]  So we all get stoned, show up to his ping pong tournament,
[03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:06.860]  excited to cheer him on.
[03:00:06.860 --> 03:00:08.100]  And we have no idea,
[03:00:08.100 --> 03:00:11.140]  but he is like the fucking ping pong guy.
[03:00:11.140 --> 03:00:12.940]  Never mentioned this ever.
[03:00:12.940 --> 03:00:14.900]  The whole time we've hung out, grown up together,
[03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:17.420]  never told anybody that he played ping pong
[03:00:17.420 --> 03:00:20.260]  until it was like this super tournament day or whatever.
[03:00:20.260 --> 03:00:22.500]  So that was, it's that kind of stuff that I think is-
[03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:25.780]  It's like Forrest Gump on the table.
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:28.900]  Yeah, but the cool part is they never told anybody,
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:30.020]  kind of like you guys, you know,
[03:00:30.020 --> 03:00:31.100]  where you just don't say anything
[03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:32.020]  until people figure it out.
[03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:33.180]  And it's like, Jesus Christ,
[03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:36.100]  this guy's like the fucking ping pong guy around here.
[03:00:37.980 --> 03:00:38.980]  So that's you today, man.
[03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:41.260]  Did he get all the ladies?
[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:45.060]  Yeah, I would say he was pretty good in that department.
[03:00:46.060 --> 03:00:48.940]  He had his varsity ping pong jacket
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:50.860]  that he would wear around school.
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:53.140]  Personality, I think is definitely.
[03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:54.620]  I don't know how to do this
[03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:56.920]  and not threaten my computer, really.
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:00.340]  I could put my computer to that.
[03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:02.620]  This is a high stakes maneuver right now.
[03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:03.900]  I'm gonna show y'all what I'm doing
[03:01:03.900 --> 03:01:05.580]  and then I'm gonna do it on the floor over here
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:07.620]  whenever I don't have to risk it for the biscuit.
[03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:09.820]  I'm just pouring water in that.
[03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:12.660]  And this is just an empty jar so I don't soak my computer.
[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:15.220]  I'm gonna pour it over the drain here.
[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:17.940]  You guys can continue to talk and then I'll come back.
[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:20.300]  Is your computer a laptop?
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:24.380]  It is, but I'm hooked up like the Matrix man.
[03:01:24.380 --> 03:01:28.100]  Yeah, I was gonna say, could you just tilt the screen down
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:30.620]  and does the camera go down with it?
[03:01:30.620 --> 03:01:31.740]  I can't.
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:32.580]  I got it.
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:33.420]  Not where it's at.
[03:01:38.530 --> 03:01:42.250]  Well, the one thing that I can't stress enough
[03:01:42.250 --> 03:01:44.810]  about what he's taught us today
[03:01:44.850 --> 03:01:48.970]  is that that relationship of animals,
[03:01:48.970 --> 03:01:53.810]  fertility, food, microbes, that's it, man.
[03:01:53.810 --> 03:01:54.650]  That's it.
[03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:57.250]  I mean, that's the way we used to farm
[03:01:57.250 --> 03:02:00.810]  before big money came in and changed.
[03:02:01.770 --> 03:02:05.090]  And if we can all go back to it, that'd be fantastic.
[03:02:05.090 --> 03:02:08.490]  But the reality is most of us live in these cities,
[03:02:08.490 --> 03:02:11.110]  these communities that you can't do shit.
[03:02:12.110 --> 03:02:17.110]  So, this is what people should look up to
[03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:20.830]  and not look up to a bigger car or a bigger house.
[03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:23.030]  You don't need anything.
[03:02:23.030 --> 03:02:23.990]  You really don't.
[03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:25.470]  Once you get over possession,
[03:02:26.430 --> 03:02:29.590]  you're much happier, but less is to want more.
[03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:32.630]  And look, you know, you gotta-
[03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:35.110]  I feel like this is a fight club rant right now.
[03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:38.950]  The things you own end up owning you.
[03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:40.230]  Oh, God, yes.
[03:02:40.270 --> 03:02:41.190]  God, yes.
[03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:42.390]  So true.
[03:02:42.390 --> 03:02:43.750]  True and powerful words.
[03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:52.630]  All right, so what else?
[03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:53.470]  Dead area.
[03:02:53.470 --> 03:02:54.310]  Yeah.
[03:02:54.310 --> 03:02:55.130]  Yeah.
[03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:55.970]  Yeah.
[03:02:55.970 --> 03:02:56.810]  Yeah.
[03:02:56.810 --> 03:02:57.630]  Yeah.
[03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:58.470]  Yeah.
[03:02:58.470 --> 03:02:59.470]  I got any ping pong stories?
[03:02:59.470 --> 03:03:00.510]  Hey, how'd that guy do?
[03:03:00.510 --> 03:03:01.510]  Did he win?
[03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:02.790]  Yeah, that's what I meant.
[03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:07.790]  It was like, it was unbelievable how much talent he had
[03:03:08.270 --> 03:03:09.710]  to never mention it ever.
[03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:11.550]  Not even to be like, hey man, you know,
[03:03:11.550 --> 03:03:12.830]  I gotta go do this
[03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:15.230]  because I got my ping pong tournament practice.
[03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:16.590]  Never said a word about it.
[03:03:17.790 --> 03:03:19.470]  And then blew the place up?
[03:03:19.470 --> 03:03:20.470]  Blew our minds.
[03:03:20.470 --> 03:03:21.910]  I feel like he'd been waiting years
[03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:23.310]  and then was just like, hey, by the way,
[03:03:23.310 --> 03:03:26.190]  come check out my little ping pong tournament, you know?
[03:03:26.190 --> 03:03:27.990]  And then just crushes everybody.
[03:03:29.470 --> 03:03:32.430]  Well, here comes the ping pong tournament, y'all.
[03:03:33.790 --> 03:03:36.550]  Okay, so see here in the bag,
[03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:39.830]  I have, again, the 160 is into the 37.
[03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:42.950]  So the 37, if I'm holding it, is on the outside.
[03:03:43.390 --> 03:03:45.710]  But I wanna rinse that
[03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:48.190]  because there's stuff in the 160 I wanna get out.
[03:03:49.470 --> 03:03:51.670]  I just take the bag and dip it.
[03:03:53.430 --> 03:03:55.630]  It'll fill up with water and it rinses out.
[03:03:57.310 --> 03:03:58.150]  That's it.
[03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:59.590]  And that'll help clean it up a little bit
[03:03:59.590 --> 03:04:02.470]  so you get some of that plant material out of there.
[03:04:02.470 --> 03:04:04.230]  You can see the hash in the corner.
[03:04:05.830 --> 03:04:06.910]  Again, if you really wanted to,
[03:04:06.910 --> 03:04:08.350]  you could weigh all this before you do it
[03:04:08.350 --> 03:04:10.750]  and then weigh it after and kind of get an idea.
[03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:13.790]  I did this and then cut it open
[03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:15.990]  just to see if the resin was sandy or not.
[03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:18.950]  A lot of people talk about what's the best strains.
[03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:21.070]  They gotta be sandy and it's like, yeah, that's very true.
[03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:22.710]  If you can put it in your finger
[03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:24.630]  and it doesn't just break to a million pieces
[03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:28.870]  and turn to oil, well, then you're in a better shape.
[03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:31.910]  Sunshine Bowl, I had two phenos this year.
[03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:34.270]  One of those phenos was just grease.
[03:04:34.270 --> 03:04:37.110]  I would go, you know, just hazy,
[03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:39.070]  lining, that real hazy lining.
[03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:41.790]  And in my experience, I never see those really hash.
[03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:44.030]  I usually end up with just really messy bags
[03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:47.830]  and a lot of broken dreams and shattered hearts.
[03:04:49.630 --> 03:04:53.030]  And so it was two phenos.
[03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:56.990]  One was more fruit forward and then one's more hazy lime.
[03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:58.350]  And the hazy lime was real greasy.
[03:04:58.350 --> 03:05:00.710]  I'd brush up against the flower a little bit.
[03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:01.670]  It was greasy.
[03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:03.330]  A tip on that, don't listen to me
[03:05:03.330 --> 03:05:05.250]  about brushing flower all the time.
[03:05:06.250 --> 03:05:08.890]  A tip for growing the best hash
[03:05:08.890 --> 03:05:13.890]  is to pick one bud on that plant to squeeze and to smell.
[03:05:13.930 --> 03:05:15.730]  Don't go squeezing all the buds.
[03:05:15.730 --> 03:05:19.930]  Don't put them in a trellis where they do this in the wind
[03:05:19.930 --> 03:05:22.550]  because every time they hit each other, right,
[03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:23.390]  they're hitting each other
[03:05:23.390 --> 03:05:24.490]  and then they're breaking the trichomes.
[03:05:24.490 --> 03:05:25.810]  You don't get that at the end of the year.
[03:05:25.810 --> 03:05:28.930]  I don't know if there's a recovery for trichomes,
[03:05:28.930 --> 03:05:31.850]  like if the plant will actually make new ones
[03:05:31.850 --> 03:05:34.030]  to fix the ones that were busted.
[03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:37.870]  But from what I've seen is like pests, grasshoppers,
[03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:40.590]  we had stink bugs this year like I've never seen before,
[03:05:40.590 --> 03:05:42.790]  but pests will walk on the trichomes and bust them.
[03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:46.550]  So pest management is not only effective
[03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:49.350]  for just the health of the plant,
[03:05:49.350 --> 03:05:50.830]  but really the cleanliness of your rosin
[03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:53.030]  at the same time or your hash at the same time
[03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:54.290]  because they're breaking up all the heads.
[03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:56.090]  They're getting all nasty and gross.
[03:05:57.310 --> 03:05:59.270]  So anyway, that's kind of that.
[03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:01.550]  I had a strain.
[03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:03.390]  So one of the sunshine bowls was really greasy.
[03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:05.230]  I would hang it for three days and it was grease.
[03:06:05.230 --> 03:06:08.830]  On the fourth day it turned, yes, bastards.
[03:06:08.830 --> 03:06:11.590]  On the fourth day it would turn hard as a rock.
[03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:12.830]  You could brush up against the flower
[03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:14.030]  and your finger wouldn't,
[03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:17.270]  you brush up against it and hold it in the light
[03:06:17.270 --> 03:06:18.550]  and you'll get a little sheen.
[03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:20.270]  You wouldn't get that on the fourth day.
[03:06:20.270 --> 03:06:21.470]  So I was like, oh, okay.
[03:06:21.470 --> 03:06:23.990]  I learned that because I did this.
[03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:27.390]  And I learned it with about 60 grams worth of wasted material
[03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:31.330]  as opposed to what I learned three years before
[03:06:31.330 --> 03:06:33.850]  whenever I put two whole plants in a wash
[03:06:33.850 --> 03:06:36.130]  and was just super let down.
[03:06:36.130 --> 03:06:38.690]  If you're a farmer and you're doing splits with hash makers
[03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:41.410]  and those hash makers aren't doing this beforehand,
[03:06:41.410 --> 03:06:43.370]  they don't care about you.
[03:06:43.370 --> 03:06:44.770]  They don't care about your product.
[03:06:44.770 --> 03:06:45.610]  They don't care if you fail.
[03:06:45.610 --> 03:06:46.830]  You work six months on that.
[03:06:46.830 --> 03:06:51.830]  They work six hours and they don't understand it.
[03:06:51.890 --> 03:06:53.530]  They don't understand the weight.
[03:06:53.530 --> 03:06:56.210]  That's where doing everything direct yourself,
[03:06:56.210 --> 03:06:58.130]  even if it's just learn how.
[03:06:58.130 --> 03:07:00.770]  Really for me, it adds a lot of respect to hash makers.
[03:07:01.210 --> 03:07:02.050]  The ones that are doing it right
[03:07:02.050 --> 03:07:03.810]  that are complimenting their farmers.
[03:07:03.810 --> 03:07:06.730]  And I don't see very many that actually really go out
[03:07:06.730 --> 03:07:08.930]  of their way to make it all about the farmer,
[03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:11.650]  but it's what it is.
[03:07:11.650 --> 03:07:13.490]  They'll learn eventually.
[03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:16.130]  We had to do it with coffee and here we are.
[03:07:17.170 --> 03:07:20.290]  Okay, that's the jar test method.
[03:07:20.290 --> 03:07:24.530]  Are we ready to get in to some squishing?
[03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:25.410]  Press is hot.
[03:07:27.130 --> 03:07:28.890]  Squish away my friend.
[03:07:28.890 --> 03:07:32.370]  Okay, I'll share some temps with y'all beforehand.
[03:07:37.380 --> 03:07:39.220]  I can actually, I'll send this to you, Brian,
[03:07:39.220 --> 03:07:40.420]  and you can just post it up here.
[03:07:40.420 --> 03:07:42.060]  It's just a little spreadsheet
[03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:45.420]  and it's just a press plate temperatures
[03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:48.620]  for just three, for flour, rye, and dry sift and hash.
[03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:51.860]  These aren't gospel.
[03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:54.900]  These are just kind of the parameters that I play with.
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:57.900]  You can go colder and you can go hotter.
[03:07:57.900 --> 03:07:58.720]  It doesn't matter.
[03:07:58.720 --> 03:08:00.260]  I know people that squish it like 205,
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:04.220]  which is insane to me, but it's what it is.
[03:08:04.220 --> 03:08:06.860]  Today I'm squishing at 73 degrees centigrade,
[03:08:06.860 --> 03:08:11.060]  which is 163.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
[03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:12.540]  The reason why I squished it that
[03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:14.580]  is because 34 is a prime number.
[03:08:14.580 --> 03:08:15.620]  It's a prime number to me.
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:16.780]  I see it everywhere in my life.
[03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:18.460]  You can call it all the woo-woo you want,
[03:08:18.460 --> 03:08:22.740]  but the best draws I get comes out of 163.4 for me personally.
[03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:24.500]  I can see other people use those temps
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:26.260]  and they don't get that.
[03:08:26.260 --> 03:08:28.220]  What works for you works for you.
[03:08:28.220 --> 03:08:29.540]  And I'm very much a number person.
[03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:33.580]  That 34 number, you know, you Fibonacci's,
[03:08:33.580 --> 03:08:36.060]  you're moving up, you're at 21, 34.
[03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:39.060]  I like that in there.
[03:08:39.060 --> 03:08:40.780]  Do I notice a big difference on anything else?
[03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:43.300]  No, and I can't give you that it's 5% better
[03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:45.340]  or it's 2% worse or you lose this amount
[03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:46.980]  of terpenes or whatever.
[03:08:46.980 --> 03:08:47.800]  I don't have that, man.
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:49.060]  I'm just a farm kid from Texas learning
[03:08:49.060 --> 03:08:51.140]  how to do this in Oklahoma.
[03:08:51.140 --> 03:08:53.180]  I moved here like 15, 20 years ago
[03:08:53.180 --> 03:08:55.940]  and was able to just be here whenever we legalized,
[03:08:55.940 --> 03:08:57.860]  which was pretty badass.
[03:08:58.620 --> 03:09:00.100]  These aren't absolutes.
[03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:02.740]  These are just some parameters that I'm working with.
[03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:05.900]  And I'll send those over.
[03:09:09.250 --> 03:09:11.210]  No, I think that there's a lot to do
[03:09:11.210 --> 03:09:13.850]  with instinct in everything in life.
[03:09:13.850 --> 03:09:16.370]  And, you know, that you instinctually went
[03:09:16.370 --> 03:09:20.970]  to that temperature is probably spot on.
[03:09:20.970 --> 03:09:22.810]  And you just gotta believe it, you know,
[03:09:22.810 --> 03:09:24.410]  and I'm sure you've tried other things
[03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:26.570]  and they just don't feel right
[03:09:26.570 --> 03:09:29.170]  or for whatever reason, they're not working.
[03:09:29.530 --> 03:09:31.610]  So trust your instincts.
[03:09:31.610 --> 03:09:34.050]  And that's the thing, even with the jar washing,
[03:09:34.050 --> 03:09:36.930]  like people can shake it, resin rinse extraction.
[03:09:36.930 --> 03:09:38.890]  He just shakes the jar and he can look at it
[03:09:38.890 --> 03:09:41.470]  and give you a percentage because he's been doing that
[03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:44.610]  for so many plants, he's got that mastery down.
[03:09:44.610 --> 03:09:46.490]  He doesn't need to dip it into rosin bags
[03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:47.810]  and get actual weights.
[03:09:47.810 --> 03:09:50.490]  I mean, he may want to, but he doesn't have to
[03:09:50.490 --> 03:09:52.750]  because he's been consistent with that.
[03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:55.210]  My dad could be on a baler when I was a kid
[03:09:55.210 --> 03:09:56.890]  and know if the bale's coming out of the back
[03:09:56.890 --> 03:09:59.290]  of the baler weighed 70 pounds
[03:09:59.290 --> 03:10:01.010]  just by the sound of the baler.
[03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:02.410]  And it was like, there's no way.
[03:10:02.410 --> 03:10:04.850]  And it's like, no, I know when a good bale's made,
[03:10:04.850 --> 03:10:05.670]  I can hear it.
[03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:09.490]  Same way with hash, you're gonna be able to feel it.
[03:10:09.490 --> 03:10:11.850]  If you're using a pneumatic press,
[03:10:11.850 --> 03:10:14.650]  you're missing out on a lot of the experience with that.
[03:10:14.650 --> 03:10:18.010]  You're missing out on a lot of the different nuances
[03:10:18.010 --> 03:10:21.050]  and the little subtleties that observation take in,
[03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:23.890]  marinate together and come out with a different method.
[03:10:24.890 --> 03:10:28.130]  I will say growing up, there's people out there
[03:10:28.130 --> 03:10:31.010]  where you could, it was almost like a Rain Man trick
[03:10:31.010 --> 03:10:32.730]  that we would do when we were bored.
[03:10:32.730 --> 03:10:35.570]  And you would put so many grams in somebody's hand.
[03:10:35.570 --> 03:10:37.810]  Shout out to a guy that I really respected.
[03:10:37.810 --> 03:10:38.630]  He passed away.
[03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:41.490]  His name was Roderick, but he was the best at this.
[03:10:41.490 --> 03:10:43.930]  You put like, you know, everybody in the group knows
[03:10:43.930 --> 03:10:46.970]  it's like 7.2 or whatever, just 3.8 or something
[03:10:46.970 --> 03:10:48.450]  that's close, but still, you know,
[03:10:48.450 --> 03:10:50.770]  cause it's gotta be right on,
[03:10:50.770 --> 03:10:54.170]  especially when you don't have a scale and all that.
[03:10:54.170 --> 03:10:56.970]  And those boys would just be like spot on, dude.
[03:10:56.970 --> 03:10:59.250]  Like 3.4, 3.5, whatever it was.
[03:10:59.250 --> 03:11:02.470]  So I feel like as things progress in your life,
[03:11:02.470 --> 03:11:05.330]  maybe you just get better at certain skill sets
[03:11:05.330 --> 03:11:07.290]  because you have to, you know, you're out there.
[03:11:07.290 --> 03:11:09.770]  You can't be running around with weed
[03:11:09.770 --> 03:11:11.310]  and a scale that you're a moron, right?
[03:11:11.310 --> 03:11:13.090]  So how do you combat that?
[03:11:13.090 --> 03:11:15.530]  You get really good at weighing that shit out in your hand.
[03:11:15.530 --> 03:11:16.450]  Yep.
[03:11:16.450 --> 03:11:17.290]  Yeah, I know.
[03:11:17.290 --> 03:11:19.810]  There's no substitution for experience.
[03:11:19.890 --> 03:11:20.730]  There isn't.
[03:11:21.890 --> 03:11:24.930]  And I like that you mentioned Malcolm Gladwell's book.
[03:11:24.930 --> 03:11:26.370]  When I try to work with people,
[03:11:26.370 --> 03:11:27.650]  that's usually one of the first books
[03:11:27.650 --> 03:11:29.290]  that I try to get them to read.
[03:11:29.290 --> 03:11:30.970]  Unfortunately, a lot of them won't.
[03:11:30.970 --> 03:11:32.490]  And I feel like it's a pretty easy read
[03:11:32.490 --> 03:11:34.650]  to start to understand why certain people in life
[03:11:34.650 --> 03:11:36.210]  seem like they have a leg up,
[03:11:36.210 --> 03:11:37.650]  especially if they're young enough
[03:11:37.650 --> 03:11:39.810]  and get those 10,000 hours.
[03:11:39.810 --> 03:11:42.650]  So you talk about the experience
[03:11:42.650 --> 03:11:45.130]  and you talk about these subtle experiences with farming.
[03:11:45.130 --> 03:11:46.970]  That's, I want to read this stat
[03:11:46.970 --> 03:11:49.850]  and tell me how much experience is disappearing.
[03:11:49.850 --> 03:11:51.890]  And then I'll get back to Ash.
[03:11:51.890 --> 03:11:55.410]  70% of the farmland in America
[03:11:55.410 --> 03:11:58.430]  is set to change hands in the next 10 years.
[03:11:59.290 --> 03:12:00.770]  70%.
[03:12:00.770 --> 03:12:02.330]  And that's because baby boomers are dying
[03:12:02.330 --> 03:12:03.890]  and they're leaving it to their kids
[03:12:03.890 --> 03:12:05.690]  or the kids are selling it
[03:12:05.690 --> 03:12:07.810]  or the baby boomers are selling it
[03:12:07.810 --> 03:12:09.150]  or whatever, whatever the reason.
[03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:11.170]  This isn't so much about the reason,
[03:12:11.170 --> 03:12:14.410]  but it's about the 70% of the farmland in America is leaving
[03:12:14.410 --> 03:12:16.090]  the farmers are going with it
[03:12:16.090 --> 03:12:17.650]  and the experience and the subtleties,
[03:12:17.650 --> 03:12:20.130]  how they know how the hell they can grow something
[03:12:20.130 --> 03:12:22.210]  in some of these conditions like here.
[03:12:22.210 --> 03:12:24.250]  Like back to Terroir,
[03:12:24.250 --> 03:12:26.250]  we're never going to grow an OG Kush in Oklahoma
[03:12:26.250 --> 03:12:28.290]  anywhere near, anywhere close
[03:12:28.290 --> 03:12:29.690]  to what they can grow in Humboldt County.
[03:12:29.690 --> 03:12:30.770]  I'm not even going to try.
[03:12:30.770 --> 03:12:31.610]  Why?
[03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:33.410]  Because they've got it so much better.
[03:12:33.410 --> 03:12:35.650]  But there's strains that'll work here.
[03:12:35.650 --> 03:12:36.730]  Green crack's one of those.
[03:12:36.730 --> 03:12:38.490]  You want an easy strain to grow in Oklahoma,
[03:12:38.490 --> 03:12:41.050]  green crack, man, bulletproof, go through anything.
[03:12:41.050 --> 03:12:42.770]  Pepe de Pew, same way.
[03:12:42.770 --> 03:12:44.410]  Bulletproof, go through anything.
[03:12:46.170 --> 03:12:50.370]  And it's learning that,
[03:12:50.370 --> 03:12:52.630]  and that's going to go away.
[03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:55.050]  So learn, learn as much as you can with the farmers.
[03:12:55.050 --> 03:12:56.490]  They're in their 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[03:12:56.490 --> 03:12:57.610]  They're like my dad.
[03:12:57.610 --> 03:12:59.450]  They're on the last leg of their life
[03:12:59.450 --> 03:13:01.130]  and they're just wanting to share as much as they can
[03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:02.130]  before they leave.
[03:13:02.130 --> 03:13:04.650]  And those little differences are going to really,
[03:13:04.650 --> 03:13:06.290]  really, really be the difference
[03:13:06.290 --> 03:13:08.650]  between a successful farmstead
[03:13:08.650 --> 03:13:10.210]  and a big commercial operation.
[03:13:11.490 --> 03:13:13.370]  So yeah, anyway, I'm going to get,
[03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:16.050]  so I need to set up the mics.
[03:13:16.890 --> 03:13:17.730]  I need to move the lights around
[03:13:17.730 --> 03:13:18.850]  and all that kind of stuff.
[03:13:18.850 --> 03:13:21.850]  I'm going to pull so I don't have to have my headphones on
[03:13:21.850 --> 03:13:22.690]  at the moment.
[03:13:22.690 --> 03:13:24.690]  I'm going to pull it so I can hear what you guys are saying,
[03:13:24.690 --> 03:13:26.970]  but I'm going to have my mic on this in muted.
[03:13:26.970 --> 03:13:28.970]  So you don't have to worry about my mute.
[03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:31.690]  And then I'll get it all moved around.
[03:13:31.690 --> 03:13:33.290]  You'll see it start prepping up.
[03:13:35.010 --> 03:13:36.330]  We're going to start with,
[03:13:38.570 --> 03:13:41.570]  we'll start with, what would you guys like?
[03:13:41.570 --> 03:13:44.250]  Just, you want me to prep just kind of how I would.
[03:13:44.250 --> 03:13:47.330]  I'll just do, I'll fill a bag full of ash,
[03:13:47.330 --> 03:13:48.170]  shake it, do the triple bag.
[03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:50.730]  Yeah, remember when we were talking beforehand
[03:13:50.730 --> 03:13:51.770]  to kind of prep this,
[03:13:51.770 --> 03:13:53.970]  all the things that you find mundane,
[03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:56.370]  the little, even when you're saying how long
[03:13:56.370 --> 03:13:58.170]  you were shaking it and that kind of stuff, right?
[03:13:58.170 --> 03:14:00.610]  That's the stuff that people really want to see.
[03:14:00.610 --> 03:14:02.210]  Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
[03:14:02.210 --> 03:14:03.130]  I can do that.
[03:14:03.130 --> 03:14:04.650]  So I'll be listening to you guys.
[03:14:04.650 --> 03:14:06.770]  If you guys want to ask me questions,
[03:14:07.770 --> 03:14:09.050]  I'll have to do some finagling,
[03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:10.890]  so maybe don't ask me questions,
[03:14:10.890 --> 03:14:13.330]  but I'll be able to hear you guys.
[03:14:14.250 --> 03:14:15.090]  Yeah.
[03:14:18.130 --> 03:14:20.890]  To me, it seems like, you know,
[03:14:20.890 --> 03:14:22.290]  like we kind of mentioned at the,
[03:14:22.290 --> 03:14:25.530]  maybe the half point of the show
[03:14:25.530 --> 03:14:28.010]  was that it's kind of like he's gone to the next level.
[03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:30.210]  So we're talking diversity in plants,
[03:14:30.210 --> 03:14:32.290]  but now when you have diversity in livestock
[03:14:32.290 --> 03:14:34.170]  and you're just really figuring this out
[03:14:34.170 --> 03:14:35.530]  and like everybody, you know,
[03:14:35.530 --> 03:14:38.010]  the theme maybe today is also making sure
[03:14:38.010 --> 03:14:40.210]  you're focused on observation.
[03:14:40.210 --> 03:14:41.810]  When you are using livestock,
[03:14:41.850 --> 03:14:45.770]  it seems like maybe that's why his genetics, his flowers,
[03:14:45.770 --> 03:14:48.290]  just everything seemed just brighter and beautiful to me
[03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:51.530]  than others that are maybe even kind of farming
[03:14:51.530 --> 03:14:55.250]  in the same manner, just don't use animals, livestock.
[03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:57.170]  I mean, again, that's like the chef,
[03:14:57.170 --> 03:14:59.130]  you know, everybody's cooking it a little bit differently,
[03:14:59.130 --> 03:15:01.250]  but it seems like that might be an advantage
[03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:02.730]  to someone that does have land,
[03:15:02.730 --> 03:15:04.450]  does have the ability to build this up.
[03:15:04.450 --> 03:15:06.330]  If you have livestock, you're building things up,
[03:15:06.330 --> 03:15:07.690]  you're understanding different animals,
[03:15:07.690 --> 03:15:09.450]  you're using different manures,
[03:15:09.450 --> 03:15:14.330]  you're seeing for yourself that some of the views on animals
[03:15:14.330 --> 03:15:16.290]  and the way that certain things are viewed,
[03:15:16.290 --> 03:15:17.930]  I feel like by the general public,
[03:15:17.930 --> 03:15:20.130]  a lot of things are misguided, I feel like,
[03:15:21.250 --> 03:15:24.010]  you know, hanging out with animals.
[03:15:24.010 --> 03:15:26.810]  Yeah, we're misinformed and letting those animals
[03:15:26.810 --> 03:15:31.810]  have a style of life, like a quality of life,
[03:15:31.970 --> 03:15:35.730]  not kept in a cage, not, you know, mass produced.
[03:15:35.730 --> 03:15:38.050]  And if they're healthier and happier,
[03:15:38.050 --> 03:15:40.290]  guess what they're gonna leave behind?
[03:15:40.290 --> 03:15:41.570]  Good vibes, right?
[03:15:41.570 --> 03:15:45.250]  We talk about spirituality and just being surrounded
[03:15:45.250 --> 03:15:49.610]  by the creatures, the animals is very uplifting.
[03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:52.250]  I mean, why do you think we have fucking zoos?
[03:15:52.250 --> 03:15:54.250]  Because it makes you feel good to see the animal,
[03:15:54.250 --> 03:15:55.530]  but you think about, you know,
[03:15:55.530 --> 03:15:57.850]  if you go deep or go dark on it, you go,
[03:15:57.850 --> 03:16:00.050]  oh man, that poor animal has no life.
[03:16:00.050 --> 03:16:02.370]  But the kids, they don't get that part of it.
[03:16:02.370 --> 03:16:04.930]  To them, it's, oh wow, look at all these animals,
[03:16:04.930 --> 03:16:06.930]  it makes me feel good.
[03:16:06.930 --> 03:16:09.810]  So I think that, you know, this connection
[03:16:09.810 --> 03:16:14.810]  that we've lost to the earth is very deep and faceted.
[03:16:15.130 --> 03:16:16.450]  There's a lot to it.
[03:16:16.450 --> 03:16:19.970]  And, you know, by having that diversity
[03:16:19.970 --> 03:16:22.450]  with animals and plants, and the other thing that,
[03:16:22.450 --> 03:16:25.330]  you know, I have such deep respect for this guy,
[03:16:25.330 --> 03:16:27.650]  is he talked about giving back.
[03:16:27.650 --> 03:16:29.250]  Nobody fucking gives back.
[03:16:29.250 --> 03:16:32.370]  All they do is they take, take, take, right?
[03:16:32.370 --> 03:16:36.410]  So by hashing his plants, 90% of the biomass
[03:16:36.930 --> 03:16:39.970]  that was taken from nutrients out of the soil
[03:16:39.970 --> 03:16:42.410]  is going back into the soil.
[03:16:42.410 --> 03:16:46.890]  There's this guy, St. in England,
[03:16:46.890 --> 03:16:51.890]  and he talked about returning 50% of your crop
[03:16:52.410 --> 03:16:56.170]  back to the soil as a staple
[03:16:56.170 --> 03:16:59.890]  to prevent what happens, degradation.
[03:16:59.890 --> 03:17:01.450]  And I think he was right on.
[03:17:01.450 --> 03:17:05.370]  I think 50% is about what you should be doing.
[03:17:05.370 --> 03:17:07.210]  And I don't think anybody does.
[03:17:07.210 --> 03:17:09.930]  Like the big ag doesn't, they take everything
[03:17:09.930 --> 03:17:12.210]  and then they till it all up and do it again, right?
[03:17:12.210 --> 03:17:16.290]  So that's, they're stealing from the soil.
[03:17:16.290 --> 03:17:18.210]  Look at all big businesses.
[03:17:18.210 --> 03:17:19.650]  They take, take, take.
[03:17:19.650 --> 03:17:21.210]  What do they give back?
[03:17:21.210 --> 03:17:22.050]  Nothing.
[03:17:22.050 --> 03:17:24.250]  Their leaders all make all this money
[03:17:24.250 --> 03:17:28.210]  and buy more homes, burn more carbon.
[03:17:28.210 --> 03:17:31.410]  And so that's why we are where we are at this point in time.
[03:17:31.770 --> 03:17:32.610]  Yes.
[03:17:33.850 --> 03:17:35.490]  There's another, can you guys hear me?
[03:17:35.490 --> 03:17:37.050]  I can't see you, but can you hear me?
[03:17:37.050 --> 03:17:38.210]  Okay.
[03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:40.250]  There's another phenomenon that's happening right now.
[03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:44.250]  And that is in order for dairies to get the forage part
[03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:46.410]  or the fiber part of their ration.
[03:17:46.410 --> 03:17:50.670]  So a ration is basically the food that they get every day.
[03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:53.930]  And in order to make that ration a complete meal,
[03:17:53.930 --> 03:17:55.810]  they need a certain amount of fiber.
[03:17:55.810 --> 03:17:59.270]  And in order to get fiber cheap, you bail.
[03:17:59.270 --> 03:18:00.250]  Now this is a thing.
[03:18:00.250 --> 03:18:03.890]  You bail corn stalks.
[03:18:03.890 --> 03:18:06.670]  Now let me remind you what's on those corn stalks.
[03:18:06.670 --> 03:18:08.450]  That corn is all round up ready,
[03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:10.730]  which means it's been sprayed at least once,
[03:18:10.730 --> 03:18:13.110]  more like twice with glyphosates
[03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:15.390]  to be able to keep the weed suppression at bay.
[03:18:15.390 --> 03:18:18.250]  So this wussy little genetics with no root zone
[03:18:18.250 --> 03:18:21.510]  can, doesn't have to compete with anything for a crop.
[03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:25.210]  And so you're taking hundreds of thousands.
[03:18:25.210 --> 03:18:29.210]  Well, so one, I don't have the math on me at the moment,
[03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:32.830]  but a 135 acre field that was planted to corn
[03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:36.310]  yielded over 300 square bales that averaged between 800
[03:18:36.310 --> 03:18:38.430]  and about a thousand pounds a piece.
[03:18:38.430 --> 03:18:40.830]  That biomass is sold to dairies.
[03:18:40.830 --> 03:18:42.870]  That dairies take that and they grind it up
[03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:44.350]  and they put it in their food.
[03:18:44.350 --> 03:18:46.110]  So your cows are not only getting the kernels
[03:18:46.110 --> 03:18:48.190]  that have the roundup ready glyphosate on them,
[03:18:48.190 --> 03:18:50.030]  but they're getting the whole plant.
[03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:51.190]  And the problem with that is,
[03:18:51.190 --> 03:18:52.750]  is you're moving hundreds of thousands,
[03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:55.570]  if not millions of pounds of carbon
[03:18:55.570 --> 03:18:58.130]  and plant material off the farm,
[03:18:58.130 --> 03:19:00.670]  which makes you more dependent on synthetic fertilizers
[03:19:00.670 --> 03:19:02.230]  as a farm.
[03:19:02.230 --> 03:19:04.390]  We cannot make these same mistakes in cannabis
[03:19:04.390 --> 03:19:05.670]  and expect to get ahead.
[03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:07.270]  The commercial guys can do this all they want.
[03:19:07.270 --> 03:19:08.790]  Like I said, they're tied to it.
[03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:10.590]  They have no flexibility.
[03:19:10.590 --> 03:19:12.550]  They're stuck with their bank and their bank stuck
[03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:15.150]  with Cargill, Bayer, Monsanto, DuPont.
[03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:16.590]  It's tied to that.
[03:19:16.590 --> 03:19:19.310]  So anyway, I'm gonna keep going with this.
[03:19:19.310 --> 03:19:20.670]  Something I do here,
[03:19:20.670 --> 03:19:22.910]  I've got some of these down for this morning.
[03:19:22.910 --> 03:19:24.350]  I'm gonna put another one here.
[03:19:24.350 --> 03:19:27.390]  I always like a clean parchment covered place
[03:19:27.390 --> 03:19:30.210]  because if you're like me, you make a mistake,
[03:19:30.210 --> 03:19:32.170]  you drop hash, hash falls.
[03:19:32.170 --> 03:19:35.870]  Some people can afford a big silicone mat,
[03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:38.530]  which I think is probably the best method out there.
[03:19:38.530 --> 03:19:40.890]  But the silicone mats, you gotta continually clean them off.
[03:19:40.890 --> 03:19:42.250]  And if they get a little bit dirty,
[03:19:42.250 --> 03:19:44.190]  you're rolling your hash on that.
[03:19:44.190 --> 03:19:46.490]  With this, I'm throwing the parchments away.
[03:19:46.490 --> 03:19:49.010]  They'll end up in compost and back on the plants.
[03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:50.970]  But that's just something I do.
[03:19:50.970 --> 03:19:52.250]  Again, cleanliness.
[03:19:52.250 --> 03:19:54.410]  Make your plans for your mistakes.
[03:19:54.410 --> 03:19:56.470]  So if they do happen, it's not the end of the world.
[03:19:56.490 --> 03:19:59.090]  If they don't happen, it's not the end of the world.
[03:20:00.170 --> 03:20:02.130]  How did you get the parchment so flat?
[03:20:05.850 --> 03:20:07.010]  I read it a poem.
[03:20:08.570 --> 03:20:13.570]  No, this is Black Paper Parchment Company, I think.
[03:20:16.730 --> 03:20:18.450]  Is the name of the company or something like that.
[03:20:18.450 --> 03:20:19.890]  They're all flat in the box already.
[03:20:19.890 --> 03:20:24.330]  So this isn't folded or this lays flat in the box.
[03:20:24.330 --> 03:20:26.410]  I'm assuming that's why it stayed that way.
[03:20:27.350 --> 03:20:29.310]  Anyway, I'm gonna continue to prep here.
[03:20:29.310 --> 03:20:30.310]  You guys go on.
[03:20:30.310 --> 03:20:32.150]  Whenever you see the hash tray here in the bags,
[03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:33.790]  and I'll move the scale around,
[03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:35.910]  then I'll be ready, I'll unmute.
[03:20:41.640 --> 03:20:44.040]  So this is what we're waiting for.
[03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:46.640]  This one's gonna run late today, Peter, I can tell.
[03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:53.340]  Yeah, I gotta go help my three-year-old pee in the toilet.
[03:20:55.240 --> 03:20:58.760]  I'm gonna put it on him and then jump out for two minutes.
[03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:01.640]  Yeah, like we mentioned,
[03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:03.740]  people wanna see the mundane stuff anyway.
[03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:08.700]  All right, so what is that now?
[03:21:08.700 --> 03:21:10.940]  That's washed or is that dry sift?
[03:21:11.880 --> 03:21:13.640]  Oh, he's on mute, he can't hear me.
[03:21:16.430 --> 03:21:18.630]  Well, we'll figure it out when he gets back on.
[03:21:20.250 --> 03:21:22.030]  I thought he wasn't on mute.
[03:21:24.430 --> 03:21:25.270]  I see his headphone.
[03:21:25.270 --> 03:21:27.770]  I can hear you, what's up?
[03:21:27.770 --> 03:21:29.550]  So that was washed or that was dry sift?
[03:21:29.550 --> 03:21:31.510]  Is everything okay?
[03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:32.350]  Oh, late one's-
[03:21:32.350 --> 03:21:33.510]  Is this right here?
[03:21:34.170 --> 03:21:35.010]  Yeah.
[03:21:35.010 --> 03:21:37.850]  This has been washed and freeze-dried.
[03:21:37.850 --> 03:21:38.690]  Oh, okay.
[03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:39.650]  And I broke it up.
[03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:43.170]  Normally, you would run this through a colander and sift it.
[03:21:43.170 --> 03:21:46.010]  This has been probably the sandiest
[03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:47.890]  of all the strains that I have.
[03:21:47.890 --> 03:21:52.890]  And because my room, I don't have a $350 CoolBot,
[03:21:52.890 --> 03:21:55.230]  I have to play with my air conditioner a little bit,
[03:21:55.230 --> 03:21:58.010]  and I've got my room down in the high 50s right now.
[03:21:58.010 --> 03:22:00.970]  So normally, I would sift this all through a colander.
[03:22:00.970 --> 03:22:02.930]  It helps make a sandy texture
[03:22:03.270 --> 03:22:04.110]  when you pour it in the bags,
[03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:05.430]  it makes it more consistent.
[03:22:05.430 --> 03:22:06.950]  It's overall, it's a better product
[03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:08.390]  if you run it through a colander.
[03:22:08.390 --> 03:22:09.550]  I'm not doing it to this one
[03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:11.910]  because the room temperature won't allow me.
[03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:14.430]  Again, work with what you have.
[03:22:14.430 --> 03:22:15.970]  It's not the end of the world,
[03:22:15.970 --> 03:22:18.510]  even though Instagram's gonna hate or whatever.
[03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:21.630]  If someone that hates can give me the exact percentage
[03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:24.870]  of loss that is lost because I don't crumble
[03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:27.910]  these tiny little crumbles into smaller little crumbles,
[03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:29.510]  I will listen to them.
[03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:31.310]  But until they can prove that to me,
[03:22:31.310 --> 03:22:33.970]  they're just a bunch of keyboard warriors.
[03:22:33.970 --> 03:22:36.590]  And I know that it's sifted, it's better,
[03:22:36.590 --> 03:22:37.930]  little chunks, better.
[03:22:37.930 --> 03:22:39.730]  Big chunks, you don't want big chunks.
[03:22:39.730 --> 03:22:41.610]  There's all the reasons why the big chunks don't work.
[03:22:41.610 --> 03:22:43.570]  A lot of times, they're ice.
[03:22:43.570 --> 03:22:45.530]  So if you're breaking your hash up,
[03:22:45.530 --> 03:22:48.090]  and you get into one, see how this is real sandy?
[03:22:48.090 --> 03:22:50.010]  You get into one that's a clump,
[03:22:50.010 --> 03:22:51.610]  and you're like beating the crap out of it,
[03:22:51.610 --> 03:22:52.450]  that's probably got water in it,
[03:22:52.450 --> 03:22:54.770]  and you need to freeze dry it longer
[03:22:54.770 --> 03:22:57.170]  because you don't want water in your rosin.
[03:22:57.170 --> 03:22:58.810]  Okay, so I'm gonna grab some bags,
[03:22:58.810 --> 03:23:00.170]  and then I'll be right back.
[03:23:04.170 --> 03:23:06.270]  This is one of those shows where I wish
[03:23:06.270 --> 03:23:07.470]  we could get samples.
[03:23:07.470 --> 03:23:12.470]  Yeah, I second that.
[03:23:15.610 --> 03:23:16.750]  Because this guy certainly knows
[03:23:16.750 --> 03:23:18.250]  what the fuck he's doing, man.
[03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:22.710]  Yeah, and that's why I feel like Leighton,
[03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:25.110]  and Peter, and I guess myself here,
[03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:29.310]  we've kind of maybe started that term A to Z.
[03:23:29.310 --> 03:23:30.910]  Like if you understand this A to Z,
[03:23:30.930 --> 03:23:33.170]  especially Andy had mentioned,
[03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:36.570]  and a few other shows, I feel like we've talked about that.
[03:23:36.570 --> 03:23:38.890]  When you're a young individual doing that,
[03:23:38.890 --> 03:23:42.850]  understanding this maybe 25 years or less,
[03:23:42.850 --> 03:23:44.130]  you're gonna have a long,
[03:23:46.010 --> 03:23:48.450]  potentially successful career doing this.
[03:23:48.450 --> 03:23:50.570]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:51.930]  Can you guys hear me?
[03:23:51.930 --> 03:23:52.770]  Yeah, no, we can't.
[03:23:52.770 --> 03:23:53.770]  Now we can.
[03:23:53.770 --> 03:23:55.810]  Okay, these are the bags I'm using.
[03:23:55.810 --> 03:23:59.210]  These are 25 micron rosin evolution.
[03:23:59.230 --> 03:24:00.950]  These are three by sixes.
[03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:04.070]  Bag size does matter as far as squishing.
[03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:06.290]  These are all the bags that I have left in this size.
[03:24:06.290 --> 03:24:09.070]  There's one squish I have that's a smaller two by three
[03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:11.110]  inch size that rosin evolution makes,
[03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:13.990]  and I really like those for small home squishes and stuff.
[03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:15.710]  Don't go over 10 grams with them.
[03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:17.230]  With these, I wouldn't really go over
[03:24:17.230 --> 03:24:21.070]  about 35 or 40 grams of hash material being put in these.
[03:24:21.070 --> 03:24:23.230]  Again, it's not necessarily the rule.
[03:24:23.230 --> 03:24:25.390]  It's just kind of what I've found to be the most effective.
[03:24:25.390 --> 03:24:27.670]  Any more than 40 grams in these things,
[03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:29.810]  and everything just gets kind of crowded.
[03:24:30.770 --> 03:24:33.850]  And so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to take
[03:24:33.850 --> 03:24:38.330]  and double bag this hash to two 25 micron.
[03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:40.850]  So I'll put hash into one, and then I'll take that bag
[03:24:40.850 --> 03:24:41.890]  and I'll show you how to fold it,
[03:24:41.890 --> 03:24:45.450]  and I'll put it into another bag that is also a 25 micron.
[03:24:45.450 --> 03:24:47.250]  The reason for that is double filtration,
[03:24:47.250 --> 03:24:50.170]  and you don't have to worry about blowouts.
[03:24:50.170 --> 03:24:52.930]  I'm going to ensure that there's no blowouts on Instagram
[03:24:52.930 --> 03:24:56.330]  or on YouTube today by putting these two bags
[03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:59.350]  inside of a 160 micron bag,
[03:24:59.350 --> 03:25:01.190]  and that holds everything together.
[03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:04.970]  I say the 160s, the glue holding the whole shit show
[03:25:04.970 --> 03:25:07.950]  together, and until you have a blowout
[03:25:07.950 --> 03:25:10.670]  and you lose thousands of dollars worth of product,
[03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:13.590]  you will not think that it's necessary for that third bag.
[03:25:14.470 --> 03:25:15.690]  That's your choice.
[03:25:15.690 --> 03:25:17.510]  You can learn that lesson just like all of us
[03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:21.190]  that have cried and wept over blown out bags
[03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:24.150]  of delicious hash that we were drooling over.
[03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:26.230]  Anyway, so that's what I'm doing.
[03:25:27.090 --> 03:25:27.930]  I hope that's clear.
[03:25:27.930 --> 03:25:28.890]  Any questions, you're gonna have to read them to me
[03:25:28.890 --> 03:25:30.450]  because I can't read them.
[03:25:30.450 --> 03:25:32.410]  So I'm going to be using 25 micron
[03:25:32.410 --> 03:25:34.710]  Rosin Evolution bags, these three by six.
[03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:36.530]  It doesn't have to be this size.
[03:25:36.530 --> 03:25:38.730]  They can be smaller, but for this,
[03:25:38.730 --> 03:25:40.870]  and this is a little bit, this hash right here,
[03:25:40.870 --> 03:25:42.630]  this is a little bit too little for this bag,
[03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:44.690]  so I'm gonna just trim them down just a little bit
[03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:45.630]  with the scissors.
[03:25:45.630 --> 03:25:46.510]  Anyone can do this.
[03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:48.730]  It's not a big deal.
[03:25:48.730 --> 03:25:49.570]  Anyway, fire away.
[03:25:49.570 --> 03:25:50.410]  I'm listening.
[03:25:50.410 --> 03:25:51.230]  I'm here.
[03:25:51.230 --> 03:25:52.070]  I just can't see you.
[03:25:52.570 --> 03:25:56.830]  I would imagine everybody's pretty excited
[03:25:56.830 --> 03:25:58.730]  just to see how the process works,
[03:25:59.690 --> 03:26:01.470]  especially from your point of view
[03:26:01.470 --> 03:26:02.730]  and the way that you've set this up.
[03:26:02.730 --> 03:26:03.570]  It's pretty cool, man.
[03:26:03.570 --> 03:26:04.590]  Does this work?
[03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:05.930]  Y'all see it all right?
[03:26:05.930 --> 03:26:06.770]  Yeah.
[03:26:06.770 --> 03:26:07.590]  Okay.
[03:26:08.490 --> 03:26:09.330]  So-
[03:26:09.330 --> 03:26:10.150]  Can you tell us about the pressure
[03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:12.210]  that you're gonna put this under?
[03:26:12.210 --> 03:26:13.050]  Oh man.
[03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:15.530]  We're gonna put it under pressure.
[03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:17.290]  Where's the music for this?
[03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:20.610]  We gotta wait for Peter to come back
[03:26:20.670 --> 03:26:23.630]  because if you play copyrighted music,
[03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:25.530]  you get in big time trouble, I guess.
[03:26:25.530 --> 03:26:26.370]  Okay.
[03:26:26.370 --> 03:26:27.190]  I'm just-
[03:26:28.310 --> 03:26:29.150]  This is messy.
[03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:32.430]  All right, there's my scissors.
[03:26:32.430 --> 03:26:33.270]  One second.
[03:26:38.830 --> 03:26:39.870]  Okay.
[03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:41.230]  Still there.
[03:26:41.230 --> 03:26:42.790]  All right, so I'm gonna just trim off
[03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:45.470]  about an inch off of these bags.
[03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:49.470]  Again, I'm gonna reiterate it while I'm cutting.
[03:26:49.470 --> 03:26:52.230]  Your seams, your seams are most important
[03:26:52.230 --> 03:26:54.390]  because your seams allow the rosin
[03:26:55.210 --> 03:26:57.370]  and allow that bag to go the path of least resistance.
[03:26:57.370 --> 03:26:59.890]  So remember that whenever you're dealing with your seams,
[03:26:59.890 --> 03:27:01.530]  whenever we're folding.
[03:27:01.530 --> 03:27:03.890]  How we fold will also make a difference
[03:27:03.890 --> 03:27:05.130]  in the flow of things.
[03:27:13.040 --> 03:27:14.540]  Wow, that cut looks terrible.
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:18.100]  But I don't have to show that.
[03:27:21.790 --> 03:27:23.710]  Does it matter if it looks terrible?
[03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:26.350]  Is it function over feature or is it just-
[03:27:26.350 --> 03:27:27.190]  This one's so bad,
[03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:29.050]  I don't think it would even function.
[03:27:29.890 --> 03:27:30.730]  Gotcha.
[03:27:31.590 --> 03:27:33.050]  It was all janky on one side.
[03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.890]  It wasn't straight.
[03:27:33.890 --> 03:27:37.930]  So as you can see, I've cut about an inch.
[03:27:37.930 --> 03:27:39.970]  Cut about an inch off the end.
[03:27:39.970 --> 03:27:44.330]  And that's just because I've got less hashes on your bags.
[03:27:48.930 --> 03:27:52.890]  Some of you can go back to your college days with this.
[03:27:52.890 --> 03:27:54.890]  You can kind of see what I'm doing here.
[03:27:54.890 --> 03:27:56.490]  Or making lines.
[03:27:57.150 --> 03:27:58.230]  Back to the 80s.
[03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:01.110]  Some hash rails.
[03:28:02.310 --> 03:28:03.150]  Okay.
[03:28:04.350 --> 03:28:06.150]  Did you weigh that?
[03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:07.910]  I have not weighed it yet.
[03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:09.550]  That reminds me, I need to weigh this bag.
[03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:10.830]  Thank you, Leighton.
[03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:12.470]  So I'm gonna weigh the bag ahead of time
[03:28:12.470 --> 03:28:14.270]  so that I know my in and out weight.
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:22.280]  Bag weighs 1.2, y'all.
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:23.680]  Don't let me forget that.
[03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:25.000]  1.2.
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:26.320]  You should weigh all of your bags
[03:28:26.340 --> 03:28:27.380]  because you cut them each.
[03:28:27.380 --> 03:28:29.300]  So they might weigh different.
[03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:30.620]  Well, I'll be able to weigh this
[03:28:30.620 --> 03:28:31.940]  and then I'll put it in the other bag
[03:28:31.940 --> 03:28:32.780]  and I don't care what you weigh.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:33.820]  Oh, I see. Okay.
[03:28:33.820 --> 03:28:34.660]  Yeah.
[03:28:34.660 --> 03:28:36.700]  So, okay, one more thing.
[03:28:41.380 --> 03:28:43.100]  Real quick for you guys out there.
[03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:45.260]  If you're trying to balance a scale
[03:28:45.260 --> 03:28:46.860]  or using a scale that you're not sure on,
[03:28:46.860 --> 03:28:50.500]  a nickel always weighs five grams on point.
[03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:52.100]  So you can easily grab a nickel,
[03:28:52.100 --> 03:28:53.500]  make sure that it's five grams
[03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:57.120]  and you know that your scale is on point.
[03:28:57.120 --> 03:28:58.700]  Good nuggets, man.
[03:28:58.700 --> 03:28:59.540]  Definitely.
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:04.160]  Okay, so your plates, if they've sat in their freezer,
[03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:05.320]  these are coming out of the freezer dryer,
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:06.940]  I've got it freezing.
[03:29:06.940 --> 03:29:10.040]  The plates are gonna collect condensation.
[03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:13.720]  I'm also aware that when you pull these parchment,
[03:29:13.720 --> 03:29:15.240]  you pull the parchment out of the freezer dryer
[03:29:15.240 --> 03:29:18.520]  after it's been wet and it's dried, it's crispy.
[03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:20.360]  And so whenever you like move on this side,
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:22.300]  the hash over here flicks off
[03:29:22.320 --> 03:29:24.720]  and takes off somewhere where you don't want it to.
[03:29:24.720 --> 03:29:26.280]  And it ends up on your shoe
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:28.640]  or in your dog's hair or whatever.
[03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:29.600]  And that's not where you want it.
[03:29:29.600 --> 03:29:30.440]  You want it in a bag.
[03:29:30.440 --> 03:29:32.760]  So be very cautious of that.
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:34.600]  That's why I slid this parchment underneath.
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:35.640]  This is clean parchment.
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:38.520]  So if I make a mistake, the parchment's there to catch me.
[03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:40.520]  If I don't make a mistake, I'm fine.
[03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:44.000]  I can use that parchment for whatever I want to later on.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  So I'm gonna risk it for the biscuit today.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:48.760]  And we're just gonna go big.
[03:29:48.760 --> 03:29:51.040]  And I'm gonna pour this whole pile.
[03:29:51.060 --> 03:29:56.060]  Now, remember, I have chopped this up some already
[03:29:56.180 --> 03:29:57.420]  and made it a little bit finer.
[03:29:57.420 --> 03:29:59.860]  I would suggest putting this through a colander
[03:29:59.860 --> 03:30:01.180]  if you've got a cold enough room
[03:30:01.180 --> 03:30:04.620]  to keep the colander from gumming up.
[03:30:04.620 --> 03:30:07.300]  My colander, I can brush it.
[03:30:07.300 --> 03:30:10.900]  Or if I put this through there, I would have had a mess.
[03:30:10.900 --> 03:30:15.900]  So pull it up, put it in the bag and then turn it up.
[03:30:16.320 --> 03:30:18.800]  Put it in the bag and then turn it up.
[03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:22.780]  Now, again, they're real crunchy.
[03:30:29.520 --> 03:30:30.640]  What a view, man.
[03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:32.400]  Dude, you're really good with that camera.
[03:30:32.400 --> 03:30:36.840]  My wife was like,
[03:30:36.840 --> 03:30:39.840]  well, we're not gonna go buy GoPros for this.
[03:30:39.840 --> 03:30:42.080]  And I was like, okay, well, I'm gonna have to get creative.
[03:30:42.080 --> 03:30:45.280]  And so again, farmer tech, I just,
[03:30:45.280 --> 03:30:46.960]  old bleacher wood, that's what this is.
[03:30:46.960 --> 03:30:49.760]  This is, this countertop here is bleacher wood
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:52.340]  from my high school that I grew up in.
[03:30:52.340 --> 03:30:53.740]  It's amazing whenever you live in a town,
[03:30:53.740 --> 03:30:55.940]  outside of a town of like 400 people,
[03:30:55.940 --> 03:30:57.580]  the cool shit you can get.
[03:30:59.060 --> 03:31:01.120]  So you notice here it's real sandy.
[03:31:01.980 --> 03:31:04.000]  We'll give it a weight, 1.2, right?
[03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:06.340]  Yep.
[03:31:06.340 --> 03:31:07.180]  Okay.
[03:31:11.380 --> 03:31:16.380]  We've got 15.1, so right at 13.9 grams or so.
[03:31:18.340 --> 03:31:19.940]  Okay.
[03:31:19.940 --> 03:31:22.800]  I'm gonna move this out of the way, this to the side.
[03:31:26.120 --> 03:31:27.320]  All right, now the fold.
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:34.000]  So a lot of people spend a lot of money on tools.
[03:31:35.440 --> 03:31:38.040]  I wanna make a suggestion, Hobby Lobby,
[03:31:38.040 --> 03:31:39.520]  these are called putty knives.
[03:31:40.720 --> 03:31:42.840]  You can get a whole pack of really cool ones
[03:31:42.840 --> 03:31:44.500]  for like six bucks.
[03:31:45.400 --> 03:31:48.280]  As long as you don't show them on Instagram, no one knows.
[03:31:48.420 --> 03:31:52.660]  So that's definitely a plus.
[03:31:52.660 --> 03:31:55.020]  Now I have this for a reason and it's clean.
[03:31:55.020 --> 03:31:56.060]  All your tools always clean.
[03:31:56.060 --> 03:31:58.840]  This one specifically never gets any sticky stuff on it.
[03:31:58.840 --> 03:32:01.220]  I'll explain here just the reason why.
[03:32:01.220 --> 03:32:03.400]  So I take the bag after it's filled with,
[03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:05.740]  can you guys see that all right?
[03:32:05.740 --> 03:32:06.860]  Yep.
[03:32:06.860 --> 03:32:08.580]  Okay, and then I just hold it,
[03:32:08.580 --> 03:32:11.820]  gently pinch it at the top and shake it down.
[03:32:11.820 --> 03:32:13.480]  And what that does is that just moves that hash
[03:32:13.480 --> 03:32:14.320]  down to the bottom.
[03:32:14.320 --> 03:32:17.800]  Now I'm gonna fold it, hold it back on itself.
[03:32:18.340 --> 03:32:20.140]  Now this is very important.
[03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:22.200]  It's folded back so it doesn't have blowouts.
[03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:24.840]  Now remember, seams are most important.
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:27.440]  This side is the seam, it's folded.
[03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:28.800]  So you notice something.
[03:32:28.800 --> 03:32:33.800]  This side only has one layer of 25 micron to go through,
[03:32:33.980 --> 03:32:36.580]  whereas this side is going to have three layers
[03:32:36.580 --> 03:32:38.820]  of 25 micron to go through.
[03:32:38.820 --> 03:32:40.700]  Again, path of least resistance.
[03:32:40.700 --> 03:32:42.880]  Thank you, Pedro's Brewing for teaching this.
[03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:46.820]  If you put them seam to seam, so here's this,
[03:32:46.820 --> 03:32:48.580]  and you're gonna take this fold
[03:32:48.580 --> 03:32:51.020]  and you're gonna put this fold seam
[03:32:51.020 --> 03:32:53.720]  in this back seam as well together.
[03:32:54.800 --> 03:32:57.380]  And if you take this and you taco it a little bit,
[03:32:57.380 --> 03:32:58.820]  you see my thumb, I'm pushing down
[03:32:58.820 --> 03:33:00.860]  and I'm raising with my pinky and my index.
[03:33:00.860 --> 03:33:03.580]  You taco it a little bit, it's really easy to go in there.
[03:33:03.580 --> 03:33:06.640]  Now notice my flap, it's folded in there like that.
[03:33:06.640 --> 03:33:07.860]  There's a reason.
[03:33:07.860 --> 03:33:12.020]  So I slide that all the way down, give it a shake.
[03:33:12.020 --> 03:33:13.540]  Now I'm double bagged.
[03:33:13.780 --> 03:33:18.780]  Now, this side has two layers of 25 micron to go through,
[03:33:20.660 --> 03:33:23.140]  and this side has four.
[03:33:23.140 --> 03:33:24.460]  How do I balance that?
[03:33:24.460 --> 03:33:26.500]  I want this to be the path of least resistance.
[03:33:26.500 --> 03:33:28.620]  This is where the clean tool comes in.
[03:33:28.620 --> 03:33:31.740]  Take the tool, push it on the side
[03:33:31.740 --> 03:33:33.860]  that the fold's already on on the inside.
[03:33:34.860 --> 03:33:39.260]  Push it, you'll see that slowly starts to get in there.
[03:33:39.260 --> 03:33:40.940]  You tuck it in itself.
[03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:44.740]  And if you take that tool and you work it like this,
[03:33:44.740 --> 03:33:48.300]  it grabs that micron and it pushes it in.
[03:33:48.300 --> 03:33:50.460]  I know it looks messy now.
[03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:51.660]  It's kind of like our world.
[03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:53.460]  Everything's a little messy,
[03:33:53.460 --> 03:33:56.860]  but here in a bit, we'll get it all straightened out.
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.900]  So I'm going to the side and I'm pushing.
[03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:02.180]  This is the side with the seam.
[03:34:02.180 --> 03:34:04.060]  This side has two seams on it.
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:06.460]  I'm pushing, it's stretching this.
[03:34:06.460 --> 03:34:08.860]  I'm pushing on the other side, it's stretching it.
[03:34:08.860 --> 03:34:12.020]  I'm pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing.
[03:34:12.020 --> 03:34:14.860]  What I want is to be like a letter presser.
[03:34:14.860 --> 03:34:17.740]  I want this to be a smooth feel.
[03:34:17.740 --> 03:34:19.340]  Right here, it's got a crease.
[03:34:19.340 --> 03:34:20.620]  I don't want that crease.
[03:34:20.620 --> 03:34:22.500]  So I pull tight on the edges
[03:34:22.500 --> 03:34:25.340]  and I can get those creases to work out.
[03:34:25.340 --> 03:34:29.900]  Again, sticking it in, turning it to the side,
[03:34:29.900 --> 03:34:33.300]  pulls, it pulls on this and it straightens out kinks.
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:35.140]  Does the same thing on the other side.
[03:34:35.140 --> 03:34:38.620]  You see how that's all tucked in, all nice?
[03:34:39.380 --> 03:34:44.380]  This side has two layers still, 25 micron to go through.
[03:34:44.780 --> 03:34:48.180]  And this side has one, two, three, four, five,
[03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:50.020]  six layers to go through.
[03:34:50.020 --> 03:34:52.220]  It does not matter, and I'm going to repeat,
[03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:56.100]  it does not matter which side is placed up or down
[03:34:56.100 --> 03:34:59.580]  in the plate whenever we press, but it does matter.
[03:35:00.700 --> 03:35:04.700]  This is the door that I shut that other piece in.
[03:35:04.700 --> 03:35:07.020]  It does matter where that is.
[03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:08.940]  I want this to face me.
[03:35:08.940 --> 03:35:11.140]  I want this to face the back of the press.
[03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:13.820]  The reason why is because when I put the 160,
[03:35:13.820 --> 03:35:15.460]  I'm going to do the exact same thing.
[03:35:15.460 --> 03:35:19.740]  Seam on one side, folded, tucked in with the 160,
[03:35:19.740 --> 03:35:21.580]  and I'm going to place that mouth,
[03:35:21.580 --> 03:35:25.260]  I'll call this the mouth, mouth to the back of the plate.
[03:35:25.260 --> 03:35:27.660]  Whenever I do directional, if that blows out,
[03:35:27.660 --> 03:35:30.940]  it has to unwind, it has to unwind.
[03:35:30.940 --> 03:35:33.460]  So I'm going to do the same thing on the other side.
[03:35:33.460 --> 03:35:35.740]  I'm going to do the same thing on the other side.
[03:35:36.020 --> 03:35:38.500]  It has to unwind a bunch of bags
[03:35:38.500 --> 03:35:40.420]  to get it to actually blow out.
[03:35:40.420 --> 03:35:43.740]  So you really protect, these are little things
[03:35:43.740 --> 03:35:46.500]  that help you protect your investment
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:49.260]  or whatever it is that you're doing
[03:35:49.260 --> 03:35:50.340]  as far as with the press,
[03:35:50.340 --> 03:35:52.140]  whether you're making it for someone else
[03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:53.340]  or you're making it for yourself,
[03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:57.500]  it helps ensure a successful harvest
[03:35:57.500 --> 03:36:00.060]  because it's disappointing whenever you don't,
[03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:01.020]  very disappointing.
[03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:15.550]  Well, I really like the way you've really thought through
[03:36:15.550 --> 03:36:19.350]  the least path of resistance in this process.
[03:36:19.350 --> 03:36:22.390]  Yeah, I've never seen anybody back quite like that.
[03:36:22.390 --> 03:36:23.670]  That's all Pedro, man.
[03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:24.750]  That's Pedro the girl ring.
[03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:26.870]  That's, that ain't my information.
[03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:28.570]  That's, that's him.
[03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:30.350]  And I love it.
[03:36:30.350 --> 03:36:31.670]  I'm like, yeah, that totally makes sense.
[03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:33.910]  Everyone wants these big squishes like Pedro.
[03:36:33.910 --> 03:36:37.430]  And it's like, well, yeah, you just, all this stuff matters.
[03:36:37.430 --> 03:36:38.270]  I've heard it said,
[03:36:38.270 --> 03:36:41.070]  how you do something is how you do everything.
[03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:43.110]  And is that not the truth?
[03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:45.150]  Because I'll get sloppy with stuff.
[03:36:45.150 --> 03:36:47.310]  And then I realized I'm sloppy with other things.
[03:36:47.310 --> 03:36:48.270]  In my life.
[03:36:48.270 --> 03:36:49.770]  One second, let me grab a bag.
[03:36:56.870 --> 03:37:00.390]  By the way, Pedro's grow room can take it to the face too.
[03:37:00.390 --> 03:37:04.050]  That dude is really, that dude is a dabbing machine.
[03:37:04.890 --> 03:37:05.730]  Oh my God.
[03:37:07.090 --> 03:37:09.050]  I'm like, dude, how do you even?
[03:37:09.050 --> 03:37:11.890]  Okay, bag 160.
[03:37:11.890 --> 03:37:13.530]  We're going to do the same thing with the seams.
[03:37:13.530 --> 03:37:15.530]  We want to make sure that the seams are there.
[03:37:15.530 --> 03:37:16.930]  I need to trim this bag.
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:28.540]  Again, mouth, recognize one side has two layers.
[03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:30.920]  The other side has six or seven.
[03:37:30.920 --> 03:37:32.420]  We want to take the mouth.
[03:37:32.420 --> 03:37:33.280]  Here's this bag.
[03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:34.540]  Here's the seam.
[03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:36.460]  I want to match up my seams.
[03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:39.820]  And I want to put the mouth of this rosin bag into,
[03:37:39.820 --> 03:37:42.060]  again, press here, kind of taco it.
[03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:44.020]  You see I'm doing that, a little taco.
[03:37:44.020 --> 03:37:46.260]  That lets that fit in there real easily.
[03:37:46.260 --> 03:37:48.980]  And then all I have to do is push that taco flat
[03:37:48.980 --> 03:37:51.080]  and we're good to go again.
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:52.860]  So see how I'm doing that?
[03:37:52.860 --> 03:37:55.300]  Pushing that bag in there like this, it's all wrinkled.
[03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:58.380]  It's going to be, everything's a shit show right now.
[03:37:58.380 --> 03:38:03.380]  And taking that clean, give it a shake,
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:05.260]  shoves it to the bottom.
[03:38:05.260 --> 03:38:08.140]  Now, two layers.
[03:38:08.140 --> 03:38:10.180]  I want to make sure that there's only a third layer on this.
[03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:12.180]  So I need to fold it this way again.
[03:38:12.180 --> 03:38:14.020]  So I'm going to fold it on the same side
[03:38:14.020 --> 03:38:15.420]  that the other sides are on.
[03:38:21.690 --> 03:38:23.630]  And it's funny to see like just different methods.
[03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:25.510]  You know, Pedro does a lot of stuff for his home.
[03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:28.150]  So he's very concerned about the one or 2%.
[03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:30.670]  And I find that a lot of commercial guys aren't as concerned.
[03:38:30.670 --> 03:38:32.390]  They're just like, oh, let's just throw it all together
[03:38:32.390 --> 03:38:34.470]  and get big squishes, you know?
[03:38:34.470 --> 03:38:35.790]  And then there's people that are concerned.
[03:38:35.790 --> 03:38:38.950]  They're like, really, it's not worth our time.
[03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:42.070]  So we're going to do like 60 or 80, 100 grand squishes,
[03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:44.330]  which are always fun to watch.
[03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:52.270]  So again, pull it to the side and turn it.
[03:38:52.270 --> 03:38:54.350]  You can see that knife kind of turning in there.
[03:38:54.350 --> 03:38:57.310]  It turns and it stretches this, turns and stretches it.
[03:38:57.310 --> 03:38:58.650]  So everything's even.
[03:38:59.830 --> 03:39:00.670]  Want to make sure.
[03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:03.070]  So I've got three seams on this side.
[03:39:03.070 --> 03:39:06.910]  I have like eight or nine layers on this side
[03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:08.830]  and only three on this side.
[03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:10.590]  This is the path of least resistance.
[03:39:11.430 --> 03:39:12.270]  This is the bottom seam.
[03:39:12.270 --> 03:39:13.990]  I'm going to face this towards me
[03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:16.110]  whenever I press here a bit.
[03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:18.790]  So that's how I prep bags.
[03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:20.070]  Questions.
[03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:22.230]  And I'm going to prep one or two of the other bags
[03:39:22.230 --> 03:39:25.230]  that just need a little bit here and there on some stuff.
[03:39:27.470 --> 03:39:28.970]  Yeah, go ahead, ask questions.
[03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:31.470]  Dude, you explained it so well.
[03:39:31.470 --> 03:39:34.590]  I don't think there are going to be any questions.
[03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:36.830]  Since he understands it so well,
[03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:38.910]  I've asked this question to a variety
[03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:39.830]  of different hashmakers.
[03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:43.510]  If you do have a blowout, you're trying to do this out,
[03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:46.350]  Andy, and you do unfortunately have a blowout,
[03:39:46.350 --> 03:39:49.030]  is any of that salvageable?
[03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:50.430]  Yeah, totally.
[03:39:50.430 --> 03:39:52.670]  Yeah, you can put it, if you have a blowout,
[03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:54.470]  get it all together as fast as you can,
[03:39:54.470 --> 03:39:57.350]  put it all together and stick it back in a rosin bag.
[03:39:57.350 --> 03:39:59.670]  And then press that again.
[03:39:59.670 --> 03:40:00.910]  You are going to lose some terpenes,
[03:40:00.910 --> 03:40:03.270]  but it's better than losing the whole pot.
[03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:04.630]  You know.
[03:40:07.310 --> 03:40:12.310]  So here is a little bag in here.
[03:40:14.370 --> 03:40:19.370]  And this is just 45U, this is a Sunshine Bull and Scottoli.
[03:40:19.610 --> 03:40:23.430]  So Scottoli is a Kim 91 crossed with Litterbox,
[03:40:23.430 --> 03:40:26.450]  and that's bred by Divine Collection here in Oklahoma.
[03:40:26.450 --> 03:40:28.450]  He's from Colorado.
[03:40:29.770 --> 03:40:31.950]  And then, and that came from him,
[03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:33.670]  so I sorted through that.
[03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:38.670]  And then this also has the other 45U of the Sunshine Bull
[03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:40.030]  that I'll be squishing today as well,
[03:40:40.030 --> 03:40:41.890]  and that was bred by Shaggy Brutes.
[03:40:41.890 --> 03:40:44.030]  So you can see here, these are the smaller bags.
[03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:45.710]  This is double bag 25.
[03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:49.230]  I'm not going to put a 160 on here
[03:40:49.230 --> 03:40:51.430]  because I want people to see that there isn't a difference
[03:40:51.430 --> 03:40:53.310]  between with or without a 160.
[03:40:53.310 --> 03:40:55.230]  There is only a difference whenever it blows out.
[03:40:55.230 --> 03:40:56.950]  I won't blow this out today,
[03:40:56.950 --> 03:41:01.350]  but I just want you guys to know that there is that.
[03:41:01.390 --> 03:41:04.210]  So this is just a little squish we'll do today.
[03:41:04.210 --> 03:41:05.950]  And then this one here is a Scottoli.
[03:41:05.950 --> 03:41:07.630]  Now I want to talk about this one a bit
[03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:10.390]  because this one is so dadgum greasy.
[03:41:10.390 --> 03:41:13.310]  I had to do it yesterday at seven degrees.
[03:41:13.310 --> 03:41:15.670]  When I pulled it out of the freeze dryer at seven degrees,
[03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:18.190]  it was almost soup.
[03:41:19.350 --> 03:41:20.430]  It was just mush.
[03:41:20.430 --> 03:41:25.030]  And so you gotta work with what you got sometimes.
[03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:29.630]  So I have this double bagged in 25 already,
[03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:31.510]  and I'm going to go ahead and stick it in the 160,
[03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:32.910]  just like I showed you guys.
[03:41:32.910 --> 03:41:34.990]  Again, mouth into.
[03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:37.950]  So if it does blow out, it has to unravel in here.
[03:41:37.950 --> 03:41:40.170]  Very, very slim chance that it will.
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:46.660]  But if you have blowouts, man, just put it back in the bag
[03:41:46.660 --> 03:41:50.740]  or smoke it and realize that people in the United States
[03:41:50.740 --> 03:41:52.680]  are still smoking Reggie.
[03:41:52.680 --> 03:41:55.160]  So you're just spoiled little baby.
[03:41:57.060 --> 03:42:00.060]  Little bit of particulate in your ash and poor thing.
[03:42:00.060 --> 03:42:15.160]  So, you know, this is probably one of the first shows
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:17.700]  I haven't seen millions of questions.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:21.040]  You're doing such a great job of explaining
[03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:25.040]  not only the techniques, the methods, the methodologies,
[03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:30.200]  and everything in a way that's very easy to understand.
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:33.000]  It doesn't leave a lot of need for question.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.520]  But people out there, if you do have a question,
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:36.440]  go ahead and hit it.
[03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:38.280]  But I think this guy's nailing it
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:40.080]  as far as keeping you guys informed.
[03:42:42.400 --> 03:42:43.600]  Appreciate that, Layton.
[03:42:45.920 --> 03:42:47.160]  You see me fumbling with this.
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:48.560]  It was because the bag was too long.
[03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:50.480]  So I needed to trim it off a little bit
[03:42:52.360 --> 03:42:53.840]  to get it to work better.
[03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:55.800]  Again, things work if they're kind of in order.
[03:42:55.800 --> 03:42:57.080]  Nature's the same way.
[03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:00.000]  We have a wonderful opportunity with nature
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  to just be able to observe what order she has
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.960]  and how we can apply that to our daily lives.
[03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:08.060]  And Brian, you were talking about fasting.
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:11.800]  My animals fast every night when I put them up.
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:15.400]  And every morning they break that fast.
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:18.560]  And so I wonder what that's doing for their microbiome.
[03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:20.440]  If we wanna talk about some stuff,
[03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:22.160]  I'm always curious, Layton,
[03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:23.520]  I'm always curious what the,
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:27.080]  they're calling it a horse dewormer, but it's not.
[03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:29.760]  Farm boys have been dipping into that unknowingly
[03:43:29.760 --> 03:43:31.680]  for a really long time.
[03:43:31.680 --> 03:43:33.880]  What's that doing to our microbiome
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:36.000]  that's actually helping people
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:39.880]  get over some certain diseases using ivermectin?
[03:43:39.880 --> 03:43:42.440]  I don't wanna really use that word a whole bunch, but.
[03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:47.240]  Well, it could be a certain compound
[03:43:47.240 --> 03:43:51.560]  that when digested creates secondary metabolites
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:53.480]  that are exported through our blood.
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:56.800]  That would probably be the reason why.
[03:43:58.200 --> 03:43:59.200]  Biology is really interesting.
[03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:01.280]  I mean, when you start thinking about
[03:44:01.280 --> 03:44:05.160]  how it will pull off or unravel
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:11.200]  a compound or pull a part of a carbon chain,
[03:44:12.880 --> 03:44:14.640]  say it wants hydrogen,
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:17.840]  it takes the water molecule and pulls the hydrogen off,
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:21.320]  releasing oxygen and releasing the other hydrogen.
[03:44:21.320 --> 03:44:23.840]  And when you start to think about those processes,
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:26.840]  by default, you're creating other compounds
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:29.760]  or you're disintegrating molecules
[03:44:29.760 --> 03:44:33.720]  that will then go to another molecule
[03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:36.800]  and start to steal its missing pieces.
[03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:41.920]  It's like trying to look at space
[03:44:41.920 --> 03:44:44.240]  and say it's expanding into something.
[03:44:44.240 --> 03:44:45.760]  What's it expanding into?
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:48.240]  The other day I had Efron on
[03:44:48.240 --> 03:44:52.360]  and we were talking about inside the spore
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:56.320]  of a mycorrhizae fungi, which is 50 micron,
[03:44:56.320 --> 03:44:58.080]  which is very, very small.
[03:44:58.080 --> 03:45:01.960]  We now know for sure there's a whole nother ecosystem
[03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:05.320]  in that spore that allows it the energy,
[03:45:05.320 --> 03:45:09.120]  like an egg, to hatch and search out a plant.
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:11.000]  Then it gets really fucking complex
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:15.200]  and you start talking about chemotaxis,
[03:45:15.200 --> 03:45:18.320]  where that plant, that spore,
[03:45:18.320 --> 03:45:23.320]  smells where the plant is and does what's called a smoo.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:26.760]  So a smoo is where it directs its energy
[03:45:26.760 --> 03:45:30.520]  because that spore can pop on any side, right?
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:32.200]  It's three dimensional.
[03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:33.960]  So how does it know where the root is?
[03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:37.200]  It smells it and then it smoo's in that direction,
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:38.840]  puts all its energy into growing
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:42.240]  in that one direction to find that root.
[03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:43.720]  Fucking nature's badass.
[03:45:43.720 --> 03:45:44.560]  It's incredible.
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:49.760]  Okay, so more prep here.
[03:45:49.760 --> 03:45:51.640]  You've got a bag and you want some directional.
[03:45:51.640 --> 03:45:54.320]  So I'm gonna go over a couple of directional things with you.
[03:45:54.320 --> 03:45:57.680]  First one is, is this is how most people set up their stuff.
[03:45:57.680 --> 03:45:58.840]  This isn't the rule.
[03:45:58.840 --> 03:46:00.360]  This is just how I do it.
[03:46:01.200 --> 03:46:02.040]  And it's one piece of parchment
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:04.560]  that I've folded about two thirds down to here.
[03:46:05.480 --> 03:46:08.960]  And then I folded the sides in, okay?
[03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:13.040]  And then I've cut right here to allow this
[03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:17.780]  to go into the rosin press like this.
[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:22.560]  So we'll be able to tuck our hash in the bed right there
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:24.840]  and give it a blanket.
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:29.040]  This can be reusable many times
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:32.400]  if you, this parchment cut out here.
[03:46:32.400 --> 03:46:35.440]  If you use a, like a directional flow,
[03:46:35.440 --> 03:46:38.080]  which I'm gonna show you right here what I'm doing.
[03:46:38.080 --> 03:46:42.160]  So these are the bigger bags, same size parchment here.
[03:46:42.160 --> 03:46:44.920]  I folded it in half just because it was easier done
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:47.960]  when Layton was talking and that's in half.
[03:46:47.960 --> 03:46:49.360]  So this is gonna be in thirds.
[03:46:49.360 --> 03:46:52.640]  So again, make paper airplanes in class.
[03:46:52.640 --> 03:46:56.000]  If you did that, you're way ahead of the game here.
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:46:57.640]  Fold it in thirds over.
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:06.570]  And so it's gonna make, just three folds, right?
[03:47:06.570 --> 03:47:08.010]  It's gonna make a little pocket.
[03:47:08.010 --> 03:47:10.210]  Here's one that I've already made.
[03:47:10.210 --> 03:47:13.130]  Notice that's already in there, it's in that pocket.
[03:47:13.130 --> 03:47:17.090]  That pocket is made by taking this whole thing,
[03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:20.050]  it's all folded together and finding the very back,
[03:47:20.050 --> 03:47:23.410]  not the one that's, this is opposite of this side,
[03:47:23.410 --> 03:47:24.290]  back in here.
[03:47:24.290 --> 03:47:27.890]  This one singular pocket makes sure everything
[03:47:27.890 --> 03:47:29.410]  goes out this direction.
[03:47:29.410 --> 03:47:31.450]  So that's where you're gonna put that hash bag.
[03:47:31.450 --> 03:47:34.450]  And then you're gonna put this in conjunction with this,
[03:47:34.450 --> 03:47:37.010]  that's already in the press together.
[03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:38.810]  So whenever you pull it, you can just pull this
[03:47:38.810 --> 03:47:41.530]  if you want to, or you can pull the whole thing.
[03:47:41.530 --> 03:47:44.050]  If you're doing three or four of the same squish,
[03:47:44.050 --> 03:47:48.170]  you can squish them with this in the rosin press
[03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:51.570]  the whole time and you're just swapping these flow bags
[03:47:51.570 --> 03:47:53.610]  in and out as you go.
[03:47:53.610 --> 03:47:55.910]  This will get thin and I will show you that.
[03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:58.370]  This paper will get thin as you put pressure on it.
[03:47:58.370 --> 03:48:01.410]  I never go over 4,000 PSI on my plates.
[03:48:01.410 --> 03:48:03.970]  I'm using four by seven low temp plates.
[03:48:03.970 --> 03:48:05.490]  I'm using the B2 model.
[03:48:05.490 --> 03:48:07.330]  I can't speak highly enough of their plates
[03:48:07.330 --> 03:48:09.570]  and the quality of everything that they do.
[03:48:09.570 --> 03:48:12.930]  If you want to get in cheap, get a pair of their cage kits
[03:48:12.930 --> 03:48:15.050]  and go down to like Harbor Freight
[03:48:15.050 --> 03:48:16.930]  and get like a 10 ton press.
[03:48:16.930 --> 03:48:19.070]  That's how I started, really how I started.
[03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:21.850]  I learned how to press bearings with a 50 ton bearing press
[03:48:21.850 --> 03:48:23.130]  on the farm.
[03:48:23.130 --> 03:48:25.970]  So whenever people show up with a 10 ton, I'm like,
[03:48:25.970 --> 03:48:27.730]  where's the 50 ton?
[03:48:27.730 --> 03:48:30.070]  And it's just, it's a lot of overkill.
[03:48:31.130 --> 03:48:34.090]  But anyway, so that's how I make those directional flow bags
[03:48:34.090 --> 03:48:35.130]  trying to get all the prep together
[03:48:35.130 --> 03:48:37.130]  because then I'll pull the computer down and turn it around
[03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:39.290]  so we can watch this beautiful drip happen.
[03:48:40.290 --> 03:48:44.730]  So yes, remember bag, this is the mouth of that bag.
[03:48:44.730 --> 03:48:46.410]  This is the end with the seams.
[03:48:46.410 --> 03:48:47.410]  We're gonna put the seam,
[03:48:47.410 --> 03:48:51.490]  we're gonna put the mouth in the pocket first.
[03:48:52.530 --> 03:48:56.170]  So if it does blow out, it's got nowhere to go.
[03:48:56.170 --> 03:48:57.730]  If it blows out, it stays in the bag.
[03:48:57.730 --> 03:49:00.570]  If you ask me about blowouts, that's one way.
[03:49:00.570 --> 03:49:03.050]  If it does happen and the world comes falling down,
[03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:04.890]  at least it's in a bag and you can pick it all up
[03:49:04.890 --> 03:49:07.210]  to some degree, get it back in a rosin bag
[03:49:07.210 --> 03:49:08.250]  and repress it again.
[03:49:10.090 --> 03:49:13.290]  You know, I've seen people and I've tried it myself.
[03:49:13.290 --> 03:49:15.730]  When it starts to blow out, you try to like,
[03:49:15.730 --> 03:49:18.090]  do you know, shape shift and move real fast
[03:49:18.090 --> 03:49:20.450]  and it ends up a big mess.
[03:49:20.450 --> 03:49:24.010]  So this will be put on the rosin press
[03:49:24.010 --> 03:49:26.130]  and then I'll take this and I'll put this inside
[03:49:26.970 --> 03:49:28.210]  and then it'll press down just like that.
[03:49:30.610 --> 03:49:32.010]  And then for bigger squishes,
[03:49:32.010 --> 03:49:37.010]  so I've got one here that's got a 40, 32 grams in it.
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:42.720]  I already pre-made my little pocket here
[03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:53.170]  and then this will be the end one.
[03:49:53.170 --> 03:49:56.490]  This is quite a bit of hash in there.
[03:49:56.490 --> 03:49:58.650]  Again, double bag, 37.
[03:49:58.650 --> 03:50:00.730]  I prep this one ahead of time.
[03:50:00.730 --> 03:50:03.090]  This bag is full, I don't need to cut it.
[03:50:03.090 --> 03:50:06.530]  So again, both sides, seam on one side,
[03:50:06.530 --> 03:50:09.250]  line the seam up, mouth in the bag first.
[03:50:10.770 --> 03:50:12.250]  And I can't, I don't know if I'm,
[03:50:12.250 --> 03:50:13.530]  well, I'm not gonna be able to taco that one,
[03:50:13.530 --> 03:50:14.450]  that one's frozen.
[03:50:15.690 --> 03:50:18.650]  So you're gonna get to see the struggle without a taco.
[03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:20.370]  Oh, it's all breaking up.
[03:50:20.370 --> 03:50:23.650]  So notice I'm trying to just shrink it this way
[03:50:23.650 --> 03:50:28.960]  a little bit so I can get it in the bag.
[03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:43.670]  Ooh, you're a big girl.
[03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:46.230]  Suck it in, lady, come on.
[03:50:52.210 --> 03:50:54.930]  She's gonna have to suck it in to get into these jeans.
[03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:03.040]  Again, it's all wrinkly, clean up the wrinkles.
[03:51:05.480 --> 03:51:07.040]  Push that thing to the side.
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:10.080]  And in this case, I can already tell you
[03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:13.200]  just based on experience, I can't explain why,
[03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:15.920]  but I can tell you if I let this sit for just a little bit,
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:17.400]  it's gonna be a lot easier to work with.
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:18.680]  Right now, they're just,
[03:51:20.400 --> 03:51:23.840]  it was pretty greasy, and so now it's been in the freezer,
[03:51:23.840 --> 03:51:25.840]  and now it's hard as a rock in there.
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:27.880]  Here in a bit, this will all soften up,
[03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:30.160]  and it'll be more malleable, and I can kind of taco it
[03:51:30.160 --> 03:51:31.080]  and get everything tucked in.
[03:51:31.080 --> 03:51:32.280]  Right now, I'm just struggling with it.
[03:51:32.280 --> 03:51:36.520]  So I'll move on to another prep, and go from there.
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:40.920]  Any questions?
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:43.880]  Yeah, Peter popped one up for you.
[03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:46.200]  If you can't see it, I can read it to you.
[03:51:46.200 --> 03:51:48.440]  Yeah, I can't see it, read it to me, please.
[03:51:49.200 --> 03:51:50.040]  Peter.
[03:51:52.160 --> 03:51:54.960]  I would assume the flow moves away from the seams.
[03:51:54.960 --> 03:51:57.680]  You're saying the seams are the least resistant?
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:51:59.840]  Correct.
[03:52:01.320 --> 03:52:06.320]  Well, the seams create a space in the rosin bag
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:10.560]  where oil will build up, and if you put a seam on both sides,
[03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:13.560]  you've got basically a ditch where your rosin sits,
[03:52:13.560 --> 03:52:14.720]  and it never comes out.
[03:52:15.640 --> 03:52:17.160]  If you only have one ditch,
[03:52:17.160 --> 03:52:18.320]  I guess that's a good way to put it,
[03:52:18.320 --> 03:52:21.120]  only one ditch on that road, all the water,
[03:52:21.120 --> 03:52:22.440]  or all the rosin in this case,
[03:52:22.440 --> 03:52:24.920]  moves to that side and stays in it.
[03:52:24.920 --> 03:52:27.160]  So the other side's squished clean.
[03:52:27.160 --> 03:52:30.600]  That extra space allows an ease of flow
[03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:31.920]  for the rosin to go.
[03:52:33.420 --> 03:52:34.440]  Least resistance.
[03:52:37.630 --> 03:52:40.150]  It's almost counterintuitive, but I know what you're saying.
[03:52:40.150 --> 03:52:40.990]  It makes sense.
[03:52:40.990 --> 03:52:42.750]  Yeah. It totally makes sense.
[03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:44.310]  Yeah.
[03:52:44.310 --> 03:52:46.590]  Yeah, it's like if everyone put something on their face,
[03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:48.550]  well, then it's okay, everyone else should too.
[03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:49.750]  You know how that works.
[03:52:51.630 --> 03:52:53.510]  We're talking in general.
[03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:54.990]  We're just talking in general, man.
[03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:56.790]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:59.470]  I'm just saying.
[03:52:59.470 --> 03:53:02.030]  So it's warmed up just a little bit.
[03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:03.990]  It's 62 in here.
[03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:06.390]  I'd like for it to be a little bit colder
[03:53:06.390 --> 03:53:09.630]  because my air conditioner over there is a brick of ice.
[03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:14.630]  So I'll get it going colder before we get to squishing.
[03:53:15.470 --> 03:53:18.850]  So again, just struggling with the bag here on air.
[03:53:22.390 --> 03:53:24.510]  The more bags you work with, the better you get at it.
[03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:27.030]  So I guess I'm a little rusty with these big boys.
[03:53:31.120 --> 03:53:33.480]  And tuck it in and just work it.
[03:53:33.480 --> 03:53:34.640]  This isn't a race.
[03:53:36.520 --> 03:53:39.200]  Farmer took six months to grow this plant.
[03:53:39.200 --> 03:53:40.640]  They woke up every morning and they went
[03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:42.320]  and made sure that it was okay.
[03:53:42.320 --> 03:53:44.080]  They went every evening, made sure it was fine.
[03:53:44.080 --> 03:53:45.240]  They worked with it throughout the day.
[03:53:45.240 --> 03:53:46.780]  They picked it, they plucked it.
[03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:48.320]  They took care of it.
[03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:49.940]  They invested their energy into it.
[03:53:49.940 --> 03:53:54.400]  And as a hash maker, I think it just shows mad respect
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:53:58.300]  to take your time and to respect that work
[03:53:58.300 --> 03:54:00.300]  that nature and the farmer did together.
[03:54:01.820 --> 03:54:03.880]  So take your time and do it right.
[03:54:03.880 --> 03:54:05.180]  And don't try to rush it.
[03:54:06.980 --> 03:54:08.900]  Nature's not in a rush.
[03:54:08.900 --> 03:54:11.380]  And if anything, society shows us
[03:54:11.380 --> 03:54:13.180]  that a rush really doesn't help us.
[03:54:17.420 --> 03:54:18.860]  Okay.
[03:54:19.020 --> 03:54:19.940]  There we go.
[03:54:19.940 --> 03:54:20.780]  Ready to go on that one.
[03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:22.100]  That was a big one.
[03:54:22.100 --> 03:54:23.500]  That's what I got this one going for.
[03:54:23.500 --> 03:54:24.540]  So this is a directional.
[03:54:24.540 --> 03:54:26.620]  We're gonna actually drop this into a jar.
[03:54:26.620 --> 03:54:27.940]  Everyone likes jar pictures.
[03:54:27.940 --> 03:54:30.500]  So I did it very similar to the other one.
[03:54:30.500 --> 03:54:34.080]  One big piece of parchment, folded it about two thirds.
[03:54:34.080 --> 03:54:36.540]  I folded the sides and I clipped it here.
[03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:38.300]  Just like the paper airplanes that you would throw
[03:54:38.300 --> 03:54:41.780]  into your math teacher's head, you fold it right here.
[03:54:41.780 --> 03:54:42.620]  Leave a spot.
[03:54:42.620 --> 03:54:43.980]  You can do this however you want.
[03:54:43.980 --> 03:54:46.460]  Really, I'm just trying to tell the rosin where to go.
[03:54:46.460 --> 03:54:47.820]  And that's it.
[03:54:47.820 --> 03:54:50.100]  I'm gonna have a jar sitting at the bottom for it.
[03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:53.980]  So again, here's my little nook.
[03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:58.190]  I wanna take the seam
[03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:03.310]  and place it to the outside.
[03:55:03.310 --> 03:55:05.230]  The mouth, inside.
[03:55:32.470 --> 03:55:33.790]  If you're talking to me, I can't hear you.
[03:55:33.790 --> 03:55:35.190]  I got my headphones off.
[03:55:37.190 --> 03:55:39.870]  I just put some of this on the back table here
[03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:44.190]  so I can make some room for a computer and some pressing.
[03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:51.300]  Here's another one that I prepped.
[03:55:51.300 --> 03:55:52.140]  Again, really easy.
[03:55:52.140 --> 03:55:55.060]  One piece of parchment, two thirds of the way down.
[03:55:55.060 --> 03:55:58.140]  Hold it on the sides and then just cut that.
[03:55:58.140 --> 03:56:00.660]  Because otherwise, if you leave this,
[03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:02.500]  that paper flexes up and down.
[03:56:02.500 --> 03:56:03.500]  And this is just a mess.
[03:56:03.500 --> 03:56:06.300]  It tries to follow it and it shouldn't.
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:10.900]  I'm gonna go ahead and just put this directional into here.
[03:56:10.900 --> 03:56:11.940]  And then you'll see here in a second
[03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:14.900]  what that looks like as far as in the press.
[03:56:16.660 --> 03:56:17.500]  Part of that goes.
[03:56:17.500 --> 03:56:19.260]  Okay, any questions, you guys?
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:20.100]  I'm about to start.
[03:56:20.100 --> 03:56:22.020]  I'm gonna have to move lights around and stuff.
[03:56:22.020 --> 03:56:26.060]  It's not as complex or as matrix.
[03:56:26.060 --> 03:56:28.740]  But yeah, then we'll be able to press.
[03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.950]  Work for y'all.
[03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:34.150]  Y'all still on?
[03:56:34.150 --> 03:56:35.950]  Yeah, man, that sounds good.
[03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:36.790]  Okay, cool.
[03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:37.630]  I'm gonna meet Sean.
[03:56:37.630 --> 03:56:38.470]  Okay.
[03:56:46.890 --> 03:56:49.130]  I'm glad he's kinda showing the real work
[03:56:49.170 --> 03:56:50.970]  that goes behind the scenes with this lighting.
[03:56:50.970 --> 03:56:54.490]  Because everybody thinks it's, well, I shouldn't say everybody.
[03:56:54.490 --> 03:56:58.530]  I think some people assume that it's a lot easier than this.
[03:56:59.610 --> 03:57:04.410]  Well, look at all the intricacies of protecting yourself,
[03:57:04.410 --> 03:57:07.650]  ensuring that you're not going to have issues and problems.
[03:57:07.650 --> 03:57:10.570]  I think that's the part that's most important.
[03:57:11.610 --> 03:57:16.610]  Like he's really giving people the tools to be successful,
[03:57:17.610 --> 03:57:19.570]  which is fantastic.
[03:57:19.570 --> 03:57:21.610]  And you can watch this over and over again.
[03:57:21.610 --> 03:57:23.130]  That's the other part about it.
[03:57:23.130 --> 03:57:23.970]  Right?
[03:57:23.970 --> 03:57:24.810]  Yeah.
[03:57:26.050 --> 03:57:27.610]  And I don't know what they were complaining about,
[03:57:27.610 --> 03:57:30.930]  saying that you can't listen to this.
[03:57:30.930 --> 03:57:34.410]  Because I think there's a way for you to record,
[03:57:35.650 --> 03:57:38.410]  watch it and record it at the same time on your phone
[03:57:38.410 --> 03:57:40.770]  and then listen to it again later.
[03:57:40.770 --> 03:57:42.890]  So that you don't miss some of the little nuggets
[03:57:42.890 --> 03:57:44.370]  along the way.
[03:57:44.370 --> 03:57:45.530]  Yeah, I've had people reach out
[03:57:45.970 --> 03:57:48.530]  that want to put it on certain podcasts and stuff.
[03:57:48.530 --> 03:57:51.810]  So I have no idea if that's easy or not.
[03:57:51.810 --> 03:57:54.530]  I know YouTube always tries to hustle me
[03:57:54.530 --> 03:57:56.930]  to get me to buy their premiere or whatever.
[03:57:56.930 --> 03:57:58.530]  And from what I understand,
[03:57:58.530 --> 03:57:59.610]  I've never spent the money on it,
[03:57:59.610 --> 03:58:02.810]  but from what I understand is that lets you watch these
[03:58:02.810 --> 03:58:05.810]  and you can just close your phone and put it in your pocket.
[03:58:05.810 --> 03:58:08.010]  And then essentially it's audio, right?
[03:58:09.330 --> 03:58:12.690]  So I just take mine and I wear overalls a lot of the time
[03:58:12.690 --> 03:58:15.010]  because I'm a farmer, that's what you do.
[03:58:15.530 --> 03:58:17.650]  I just drop my phone into my overalls
[03:58:17.650 --> 03:58:20.930]  and as long as I'm not too sweaty in the chest,
[03:58:20.930 --> 03:58:23.290]  it never pokes any buttons or does anything.
[03:58:25.050 --> 03:58:27.170]  Anyway, so, okay, y'all ready?
[03:58:27.170 --> 03:58:28.010]  Is the light good?
[03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:29.090]  It looks like it's good.
[03:58:29.090 --> 03:58:31.370]  You're gonna notice over here, this is my pressure.
[03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:34.050]  Everything's gonna be backwards as well.
[03:58:34.050 --> 03:58:36.130]  Just because of the way the screen works.
[03:58:36.130 --> 03:58:41.130]  I'm going to set up a stopwatch here.
[03:58:41.650 --> 03:58:46.650]  I really wish I had some good timers.
[03:58:51.130 --> 03:58:52.370]  That worked, okay.
[03:58:52.370 --> 03:58:53.730]  I really wish I had some good timers
[03:58:53.730 --> 03:58:54.570]  with some good batteries,
[03:58:54.570 --> 03:58:56.770]  but the Roslyn Evo timers require batteries
[03:58:56.770 --> 03:58:59.530]  that are very difficult to find right now.
[03:58:59.530 --> 03:59:04.530]  So anyway, I hope that'll work.
[03:59:05.290 --> 03:59:07.290]  Okay, so we're getting there.
[03:59:07.290 --> 03:59:10.650]  You notice here I put, again,
[03:59:11.170 --> 03:59:12.010]  this is the reason why it's cut
[03:59:12.010 --> 03:59:13.330]  because whenever it's folded and it's in there
[03:59:13.330 --> 03:59:14.930]  and you try to stick something in there,
[03:59:14.930 --> 03:59:16.730]  if this was still connected, it would never work.
[03:59:16.730 --> 03:59:18.330]  It'd be out like this.
[03:59:18.330 --> 03:59:19.690]  So that's the reason why it's cut.
[03:59:19.690 --> 03:59:22.090]  Notice I say you can use this quite a few times
[03:59:22.970 --> 03:59:24.850]  and you'll be able to as long as you don't go
[03:59:24.850 --> 03:59:25.810]  too high on the pressure.
[03:59:25.810 --> 03:59:28.050]  So what we're gonna start with here
[03:59:28.050 --> 03:59:30.570]  is I'm gonna start with the 45U.
[03:59:30.570 --> 03:59:32.970]  This is Sunshine Bowl and Scotoli.
[03:59:32.970 --> 03:59:34.290]  The reason why I did the 45U
[03:59:34.290 --> 03:59:36.850]  is because it gave me about three and a half grams
[03:59:36.850 --> 03:59:39.770]  per wash of the 45U,
[03:59:39.770 --> 03:59:42.050]  which was the smallest amount of what I got.
[03:59:42.050 --> 03:59:44.210]  And I just figured, man, this is personal.
[03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:46.370]  All this stuff is personal.
[03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:50.210]  I'll add this to the mix if I like it together.
[03:59:50.210 --> 03:59:53.450]  Again, if you don't like certain varieties
[03:59:53.450 --> 03:59:55.930]  or certain pulls, test them all separate
[03:59:55.930 --> 03:59:58.050]  and then combine them if you want.
[03:59:58.050 --> 03:59:59.210]  There's never a mistake,
[03:59:59.210 --> 04:00:01.490]  but once you go there, you can't go back.
[04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:03.370]  So that's what this is.
[04:00:03.370 --> 04:00:06.050]  Again, if you guys couldn't see it in the video,
[04:00:06.050 --> 04:00:07.570]  this is just a small version.
[04:00:07.570 --> 04:00:09.570]  It's literally half the size.
[04:00:09.570 --> 04:00:13.550]  And I've just taken paper and I folded it over.
[04:00:16.690 --> 04:00:18.490]  And then there's that little note.
[04:00:18.490 --> 04:00:23.090]  Again, same to the outside, mouth to the inside.
[04:00:23.090 --> 04:00:25.330]  And I'm gonna have it closer to the front
[04:00:25.330 --> 04:00:27.810]  so we can see the squish a lot better.
[04:00:30.330 --> 04:00:31.170]  Here.
[04:00:32.170 --> 04:00:36.090]  Again, 163.4 is my temperature.
[04:00:39.130 --> 04:00:41.450]  163.4 is my temp.
[04:00:41.450 --> 04:00:43.490]  So that's what I'm gonna be squishing at.
[04:00:46.410 --> 04:00:48.250]  Okay, here goes a stopwatch.
[04:00:48.250 --> 04:00:51.370]  So the first 30 seconds of the squish.
[04:00:54.210 --> 04:00:55.930]  First 30 seconds is just gonna be getting
[04:00:55.930 --> 04:00:59.370]  everything situated in that bag whenever I start squishing.
[04:00:59.370 --> 04:01:01.290]  So slide it in.
[04:01:02.970 --> 04:01:04.010]  Start my timer.
[04:01:04.890 --> 04:01:06.530]  And then I'm gonna slowly work down.
[04:01:06.530 --> 04:01:08.370]  I'm using a BVA hydraulic pump.
[04:01:09.490 --> 04:01:11.170]  Notice everything has gotta get situated.
[04:01:11.170 --> 04:01:12.870]  That paper's gotta fold.
[04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:15.130]  I'm going a little bit quicker now than I would normally.
[04:01:15.130 --> 04:01:17.370]  I'm gonna slow down here in just a second.
[04:01:17.370 --> 04:01:21.050]  The idea is to see, I'm getting some pressure now.
[04:01:21.050 --> 04:01:24.090]  And if you're able to watch that needle very close,
[04:01:24.090 --> 04:01:25.570]  you probably can't see in the video,
[04:01:25.570 --> 04:01:27.290]  but in real life, you can watch that needle
[04:01:27.290 --> 04:01:29.170]  slowly move on the pressure gauge.
[04:01:29.970 --> 04:01:30.810]  And that's just applying pressure
[04:01:30.810 --> 04:01:32.650]  and then it's responding to the pressure
[04:01:32.650 --> 04:01:33.490]  when the needle falls.
[04:01:33.490 --> 04:01:36.210]  So I've got pressure, I've got pushback, I can feel it.
[04:01:37.690 --> 04:01:38.850]  And I'm around 30 seconds.
[04:01:38.850 --> 04:01:40.810]  So around 45 or so, I'm gonna start getting
[04:01:40.810 --> 04:01:42.130]  some rosin squeezing out of there.
[04:01:42.130 --> 04:01:44.170]  There's a little bit of pressure on here.
[04:01:48.290 --> 04:01:52.130]  I've got a BVA jack, and so I'm just resting my hand on it.
[04:01:52.130 --> 04:01:54.290]  I'll show you all here in just a minute.
[04:01:54.290 --> 04:01:57.530]  But it's just my arm pressure on it.
[04:01:57.530 --> 04:01:59.410]  What that allows me to do is it allows me
[04:01:59.410 --> 04:02:01.410]  to feel this rosin.
[04:02:01.410 --> 04:02:04.090]  It allows me to feel the heads,
[04:02:04.090 --> 04:02:06.450]  not necessarily literally break,
[04:02:06.450 --> 04:02:08.890]  but you can feel it get easier.
[04:02:08.890 --> 04:02:10.730]  Reminder, this is a 45-year bag,
[04:02:10.730 --> 04:02:14.650]  so it's not gonna have, in some cases, as much oil.
[04:02:14.650 --> 04:02:17.890]  But clarity doesn't necessarily determine,
[04:02:17.890 --> 04:02:22.050]  clarity isn't determined by your pull either.
[04:02:22.050 --> 04:02:24.050]  So you can see here, we've got some pretty
[04:02:25.450 --> 04:02:26.970]  sexy looking rosin.
[04:02:26.970 --> 04:02:29.330]  Now once it starts flowing, you wanna keep it flowing.
[04:02:29.330 --> 04:02:31.050]  So I'm slowly pumping this pump.
[04:02:32.370 --> 04:02:34.250]  Not a lot of pressure.
[04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:37.290]  I'm not trying to win some He-Man,
[04:02:38.170 --> 04:02:40.890]  He-Man whatever.
[04:02:43.010 --> 04:02:44.610]  Just trying to press some rosin.
[04:02:45.730 --> 04:02:47.730]  It doesn't look like, it almost doesn't look like
[04:02:47.730 --> 04:02:49.730]  you have any pressure on it right now.
[04:02:49.730 --> 04:02:52.450]  Like the needle, the needle isn't up.
[04:02:52.450 --> 04:02:56.010]  Yeah, so the needle is moving about the width of the needle.
[04:02:56.010 --> 04:02:58.330]  And then whenever I lift up on the bottle,
[04:02:58.330 --> 04:02:59.570]  the needle falls.
[04:02:59.610 --> 04:03:01.410]  And that's because the pressure's being applied,
[04:03:01.410 --> 04:03:03.770]  but the pressure's leaving in the form of the rosin
[04:03:03.770 --> 04:03:05.290]  leaving the plates.
[04:03:05.290 --> 04:03:07.730]  So you're actually able to see on the pressure
[04:03:07.730 --> 04:03:10.050]  whether I can see rosin coming out or not.
[04:03:10.050 --> 04:03:12.690]  I should be able to look just at this
[04:03:12.690 --> 04:03:14.970]  and know how complete my press is.
[04:03:16.050 --> 04:03:17.770]  So when that starts to raise up,
[04:03:17.770 --> 04:03:20.090]  you know you're done getting anything out of it.
[04:03:20.090 --> 04:03:21.090]  Everything that's in the bag
[04:03:21.090 --> 04:03:22.130]  is pretty well out of the bag.
[04:03:22.130 --> 04:03:24.090]  Now I'm just trying to get it off the plates.
[04:03:24.090 --> 04:03:25.370]  So with the smaller bags,
[04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:29.130]  I'm not gonna go over around 3,000 PSI.
[04:03:29.730 --> 04:03:31.010]  Again, if I want more oil out of it,
[04:03:31.010 --> 04:03:33.050]  I can always repress it.
[04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:34.690]  It's not the best thing in the world to do,
[04:03:34.690 --> 04:03:36.770]  but this is personal stash.
[04:03:36.770 --> 04:03:38.290]  And that's really all that matters.
[04:03:38.290 --> 04:03:40.010]  So I'm at two and a half minutes.
[04:03:40.010 --> 04:03:42.610]  I don't like going over three minutes of plate time.
[04:03:44.930 --> 04:03:46.890]  So I'm gonna pull it in just a second.
[04:03:48.370 --> 04:03:50.370]  What's your PSI right now?
[04:03:50.370 --> 04:03:51.690]  I'm around 3,000.
[04:03:53.250 --> 04:03:55.610]  So notice it's not really coming out much anymore
[04:03:55.610 --> 04:03:56.650]  so I'm gonna pull it.
[04:04:01.180 --> 04:04:02.660]  Beautiful, man.
[04:04:02.660 --> 04:04:04.340]  Makes me nervous by the computer.
[04:04:06.940 --> 04:04:07.780]  It's funny though,
[04:04:07.780 --> 04:04:10.420]  this rosin's probably worth about as much as a computer.
[04:04:10.420 --> 04:04:13.380]  I was gonna say, dude, just switch it out.
[04:04:15.260 --> 04:04:16.300]  Beautiful work, dude.
[04:04:19.980 --> 04:04:21.780]  I almost pulled the computer off the counter.
[04:04:21.780 --> 04:04:23.180]  Holy cow.
[04:04:23.180 --> 04:04:25.340]  Good thing I, let me unhook.
[04:04:26.700 --> 04:04:27.660]  That was too close.
[04:04:36.680 --> 04:04:37.800]  You know, I'm glad you shared
[04:04:38.080 --> 04:04:40.240]  that you don't like to press over three minutes.
[04:04:40.240 --> 04:04:43.120]  And so there is kind of an importance
[04:04:43.120 --> 04:04:48.120]  for you to pay attention to time and pressure
[04:04:48.120 --> 04:04:49.680]  while you're doing it.
[04:04:49.680 --> 04:04:51.880]  Correct, very correct.
[04:04:53.160 --> 04:04:57.080]  You know, your temperature is degrading things
[04:04:57.080 --> 04:04:59.400]  and it is doing that.
[04:05:02.720 --> 04:05:04.640]  So that one's all dirty and I'm not gonna be able to flex.
[04:05:04.640 --> 04:05:07.800]  So I'm gonna flip one of these directions up real quick
[04:05:07.800 --> 04:05:08.720]  behind the scenes.
[04:05:10.280 --> 04:05:12.880]  It is very important, time and temperature.
[04:05:12.880 --> 04:05:17.880]  A lot of people will say, oh, I want 200 Fahrenheit
[04:05:18.200 --> 04:05:22.520]  so I can get it off the place quicker or whatever.
[04:05:22.520 --> 04:05:24.720]  And I totally understand that reasoning.
[04:05:24.720 --> 04:05:26.560]  There's nothing wrong with that reasoning.
[04:05:27.760 --> 04:05:29.120]  I just have noticed that, man,
[04:05:29.120 --> 04:05:31.360]  I just get better results with that.
[04:05:31.360 --> 04:05:33.360]  Oh, shout out to Humphrey Hash.
[04:05:34.360 --> 04:05:36.960]  Humphrey Hash presented something a couple of weeks ago
[04:05:36.960 --> 04:05:40.880]  with some graphs showing the volatilization
[04:05:40.880 --> 04:05:43.240]  or when the evaporation of certain terpenes
[04:05:43.240 --> 04:05:46.000]  happen under vacuum.
[04:05:46.960 --> 04:05:50.080]  And boy howdy, does a vacuum change things.
[04:05:50.080 --> 04:05:52.120]  Be careful, according to his graph,
[04:05:52.120 --> 04:05:54.840]  be careful when it comes off at five degrees
[04:05:56.120 --> 04:05:58.400]  under a vacuum in the freeze dryer.
[04:05:58.400 --> 04:06:00.600]  So if you're wanting to keep,
[04:06:00.600 --> 04:06:03.240]  if you're wanting to keep be careful,
[04:06:04.080 --> 04:06:07.080]  you're gonna wanna put your shelf temp at five degrees.
[04:06:07.080 --> 04:06:09.120]  I'm telling you, I did it this year.
[04:06:10.360 --> 04:06:11.280]  I stuffed soup.
[04:06:12.360 --> 04:06:14.400]  It's like a rosin jam whenever it comes out.
[04:06:14.400 --> 04:06:15.360]  And that's all I changed.
[04:06:15.360 --> 04:06:17.720]  I moved my plate temp from 35 down to five.
[04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:24.630]  That one's about as pretty, kind of.
[04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:29.510]  Okay, so that was what I just squished at the 45.
[04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:35.390]  This here is a really, this is Skitoli.
[04:06:35.390 --> 04:06:37.830]  So this is a Kim 91 Cross litter box.
[04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:40.530]  Shout out to Divine Collection.
[04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:44.190]  Or Kena Divine, who's a breeder on this deal.
[04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:46.790]  Or on this strain.
[04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:49.350]  Gave me some of these seeds at the beginning of the year
[04:06:49.350 --> 04:06:52.190]  and I was like, dude, try them out, see how they work.
[04:06:52.190 --> 04:06:54.310]  So again, this was all prepped ahead of time.
[04:06:54.310 --> 04:06:55.590]  You guys see me all right?
[04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:58.550]  Yeah, man, this is a front row seat.
[04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:03.950]  Start, put this on the plates.
[04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:28.520]  Again, real slow, once you get down here,
[04:07:28.520 --> 04:07:30.120]  you've worked all year for this.
[04:07:32.640 --> 04:07:34.840]  I'm gonna have to make a tray at the bottom
[04:07:34.840 --> 04:07:36.720]  because this thing's gonna get squishy.
[04:07:38.720 --> 04:07:40.320]  Varietals really do matter.
[04:07:40.320 --> 04:07:43.200]  I think that probably matters more than anything else.
[04:07:43.200 --> 04:07:45.880]  Varieties and what that does.
[04:07:46.000 --> 04:07:47.800]  Look at this, oh my gosh.
[04:07:47.800 --> 04:07:49.120]  So you see it coming out of the bag,
[04:07:49.120 --> 04:07:50.880]  it's coming right to that seam
[04:07:50.880 --> 04:07:53.080]  and then it'll pass easily through that seam.
[04:07:54.800 --> 04:08:04.380]  This is raised by chickens, ducks, geese in nature.
[04:08:06.940 --> 04:08:08.740]  That's a gorgeous one.
[04:08:08.740 --> 04:08:12.740]  I'm gonna have to hold up her chin,
[04:08:12.740 --> 04:08:15.260]  she's gonna be drooling here in a second.
[04:08:15.260 --> 04:08:16.100]  Easy girl.
[04:08:17.980 --> 04:08:18.820]  She's drooling.
[04:08:18.820 --> 04:08:19.660]  She's drooling.
[04:08:19.660 --> 04:08:20.500]  She's drooling.
[04:08:20.500 --> 04:08:21.340]  She's drooling.
[04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:22.700]  She's drooling.
[04:08:25.740 --> 04:08:28.140]  What I've seen with natural farming, man,
[04:08:28.140 --> 04:08:30.420]  is the terpene levels, it is just saucy.
[04:08:30.420 --> 04:08:31.860]  Look at it, it's just sauce.
[04:08:33.220 --> 04:08:36.820]  Terpene levels are just way, way higher
[04:08:36.820 --> 04:08:37.980]  with anything sun grown.
[04:08:37.980 --> 04:08:40.340]  I don't even care if it's like some boofy sun grown.
[04:08:40.340 --> 04:08:42.340]  I feel like a lot of the terpenes in boofy sun grown
[04:08:42.340 --> 04:08:44.820]  are better than half the indoor stuff that people have.
[04:08:44.820 --> 04:08:47.220]  So you notice my needle over there really hasn't moved
[04:08:47.220 --> 04:08:48.660]  and there comes another drip.
[04:08:49.620 --> 04:08:51.540]  And here's a perfect example to talk about
[04:08:51.540 --> 04:08:53.380]  how you need your bags to be outside
[04:08:53.380 --> 04:08:54.300]  of the front of the press.
[04:08:54.300 --> 04:08:59.020]  You can notice by the L there, it's actually on the press.
[04:08:59.020 --> 04:09:00.500]  That's something you don't really want there
[04:09:00.500 --> 04:09:02.420]  to finally get your thought.
[04:09:02.420 --> 04:09:05.020]  But that was done because I just was not paying attention
[04:09:05.020 --> 04:09:07.260]  or I just got in a rush one of the two.
[04:09:07.260 --> 04:09:09.100]  Those are just mistakes that happen, man.
[04:09:09.100 --> 04:09:11.660]  I'll just try not to do it next time.
[04:09:14.700 --> 04:09:17.420]  I need you to correct some of your words.
[04:09:17.420 --> 04:09:19.500]  Don't use mistake, use lesson.
[04:09:19.500 --> 04:09:20.620]  Everything's a lesson.
[04:09:22.260 --> 04:09:24.580]  Mistake is a negative connotation.
[04:09:24.580 --> 04:09:27.580]  We don't want to put negativity in any part of our life.
[04:09:28.540 --> 04:09:30.220]  Sorry to be a dick.
[04:09:30.220 --> 04:09:35.220]  Can I change the word?
[04:09:35.300 --> 04:09:36.500]  Don't use the word dick.
[04:09:38.260 --> 04:09:39.300]  Use the word prick.
[04:09:40.700 --> 04:09:41.940]  Little bit less negative.
[04:09:42.980 --> 04:09:43.820]  Love it.
[04:09:45.180 --> 04:09:46.620]  I got a lot of goop on that.
[04:09:48.420 --> 04:09:49.260]  Hopefully you all can see.
[04:09:49.260 --> 04:09:51.940]  I mean, look, it's just gonna run right off of there.
[04:09:52.900 --> 04:09:54.380]  How many grams was that?
[04:10:00.960 --> 04:10:03.240]  And while he's looking for his notes,
[04:10:03.240 --> 04:10:05.760]  while everybody was looking in at the closeup,
[04:10:05.760 --> 04:10:08.480]  I was gonna go, boom.
[04:10:10.880 --> 04:10:12.720]  Is that Ben Diesel?
[04:10:12.720 --> 04:10:14.520]  No, that's Right Said Fred.
[04:10:14.520 --> 04:10:16.080]  That's what the chat's talking,
[04:10:16.080 --> 04:10:19.400]  or was talking about when I pulled it up.
[04:10:20.080 --> 04:10:21.160]  I'm glad they're engaged.
[04:10:21.960 --> 04:10:26.560]  So yeah, we have two people on the, go ahead.
[04:10:26.560 --> 04:10:28.040]  We're gonna do a big squish next.
[04:10:28.040 --> 04:10:31.120]  So if anyone has any, we're gonna put a jar up there
[04:10:31.120 --> 04:10:33.040]  and we're gonna run it right into a jar
[04:10:33.040 --> 04:10:34.680]  whenever y'all are ready.
[04:10:34.680 --> 04:10:35.520]  Questions?
[04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:41.750]  Dude, I haven't seen any questions.
[04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:42.590]  Okay.
[04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:43.430]  One or two so far.
[04:10:43.430 --> 04:10:44.390]  Okay.
[04:10:44.390 --> 04:10:46.910]  All right, well, we're gonna use a jar
[04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:49.030]  and we're gonna do directional.
[04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:51.350]  That last squish was?
[04:10:52.270 --> 04:10:53.670]  Guess your question.
[04:10:56.390 --> 04:11:00.430]  Was 18.8 grams is what was in there.
[04:11:00.430 --> 04:11:02.990]  And this one's gonna be close to 32.
[04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:05.990]  So I saw this online, I think it was in a hash church
[04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:10.190]  and someone was like, oh, you didn't tear the jar.
[04:11:10.190 --> 04:11:12.070]  And the dude was like, no, I teared it.
[04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.990]  Everyone's like, no, you didn't.
[04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:14.350]  It's not even written on.
[04:11:14.350 --> 04:11:15.790]  And then he did that.
[04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:19.350]  And I was like, oh my gosh, that is brilliant.
[04:11:19.350 --> 04:11:21.830]  So he wrote the tear on the bottom
[04:11:22.430 --> 04:11:25.230]  and then he wrote it right there, right in this crease.
[04:11:25.230 --> 04:11:28.390]  So you're not rubbing it off like you are here.
[04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:30.870]  And it's just two references.
[04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:32.430]  So I started doing it.
[04:11:32.430 --> 04:11:34.390]  If anyone's asking why, that's why.
[04:11:34.390 --> 04:11:35.230]  I don't remember who did it,
[04:11:35.230 --> 04:11:36.830]  but I was like, oh, that's brilliant.
[04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:38.510]  That is a gold bar.
[04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:41.230]  Right inside the little crease there, dude.
[04:11:41.230 --> 04:11:44.150]  Because anyone that's ever done it knows how annoying it is.
[04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:49.270]  So it's been a while since you last mentioned
[04:11:49.270 --> 04:11:50.390]  what you're pressing.
[04:11:50.390 --> 04:11:55.110]  So for our new viewers, what are you pressing?
[04:11:58.630 --> 04:12:01.070]  So right now, what I'm gonna put it,
[04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:04.470]  well, the two, the hash rods I'm gonna press in a day,
[04:12:04.470 --> 04:12:06.670]  and this one specifically, this is skitoli.
[04:12:06.670 --> 04:12:08.150]  And this is the first pheno,
[04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:10.470]  the one that I picked out of five
[04:12:10.470 --> 04:12:13.230]  that I decided was gonna be best for environment,
[04:12:13.230 --> 04:12:15.790]  best for conditions, best for hashing.
[04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:18.750]  And again, it's all pissing in the wind in the spring,
[04:12:18.750 --> 04:12:22.110]  but you can kind of make your commitment,
[04:12:22.110 --> 04:12:24.670]  make your decision, and then stick with it
[04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:26.910]  and learn what you're gonna learn from that.
[04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:29.590]  And so this was the first pheno.
[04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:31.190]  It did incredibly well.
[04:12:31.190 --> 04:12:32.310]  I've got a good return off of it.
[04:12:32.310 --> 04:12:33.870]  I'll be able to give you guys total returns
[04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:35.270]  at the end of the show,
[04:12:35.270 --> 04:12:37.150]  as far as what I got for percentage-wise
[04:12:37.150 --> 04:12:40.070]  from plant all the way to finished rosin.
[04:12:41.230 --> 04:12:43.710]  Skitoli is named after the smell
[04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:45.750]  that makes poop smell like poop.
[04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:48.270]  And it's bred by Canada Vine or Divine Collection
[04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:49.630]  here in Oklahoma.
[04:12:49.630 --> 04:12:51.230]  They come from Colorado at one time.
[04:12:51.230 --> 04:12:54.950]  This is a Kim 91 crossed with a Litterbox No. 7.
[04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:58.470]  And if you've ever had Litterbox No. 7,
[04:12:58.470 --> 04:12:59.550]  you know about it.
[04:12:59.550 --> 04:13:00.590]  It'll change your life, man.
[04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:01.430]  It's so good.
[04:13:01.430 --> 04:13:04.030]  It's got this asahi berry and all this complexity in it.
[04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:05.790]  So anyway, this is a cross from that.
[04:13:05.790 --> 04:13:08.510]  And then the other squishes that I did,
[04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:10.870]  that I just did the really yellow one,
[04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:15.870]  that was skitoli pheno two, three, and four.
[04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:20.150]  And so it was kind of a mix.
[04:13:21.230 --> 04:13:22.870]  I just didn't have enough of each one.
[04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:24.790]  Again, if you're going A to Z,
[04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:26.750]  you gotta learn how to pheno hunt.
[04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:28.470]  And pheno hunting means you're gonna be let down
[04:13:28.470 --> 04:13:29.430]  at the end of the year.
[04:13:29.430 --> 04:13:32.110]  But you're not let down as long as you're getting data.
[04:13:32.110 --> 04:13:33.910]  And with Jadon Natural Farming,
[04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:36.430]  you can turn this year's losses into next year's gains
[04:13:36.430 --> 04:13:38.150]  by just fermenting the plants.
[04:13:38.150 --> 04:13:41.070]  I had one plant this year that always had aphid pressure,
[04:13:41.070 --> 04:13:43.390]  which my friend Kurt will always say,
[04:13:43.390 --> 04:13:45.430]  aphids are nature's way of telling you
[04:13:45.430 --> 04:13:48.750]  that genetics in that environment is not right.
[04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:50.830]  And it's gonna turn it back into compost
[04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:53.630]  so it can do it again, so it can try again,
[04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:54.910]  so it can try again.
[04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:56.790]  So don't take aphids as a pest,
[04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:58.830]  take them as canary in your coal mine
[04:13:58.830 --> 04:14:01.590]  that maybe your genetics aren't on point,
[04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:03.310]  maybe your farming's not on point,
[04:14:03.310 --> 04:14:04.950]  maybe your soil's not on point,
[04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:06.950]  maybe all those things aren't on point,
[04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:08.110]  but take it what it is.
[04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:12.190]  So I get some that are just complete losers.
[04:14:12.190 --> 04:14:13.790]  And one of those this year was a peppy-to-pew,
[04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:14.870]  which I've been working on this
[04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:16.270]  my third year working on it.
[04:14:17.350 --> 04:14:19.310]  It was a complete, one of them was a complete loser
[04:14:19.310 --> 04:14:20.910]  this year, it was covered in aphids.
[04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:23.470]  But I decided to take that whole plant
[04:14:23.470 --> 04:14:26.110]  and put it into a ferment that I'll use next year.
[04:14:26.110 --> 04:14:29.430]  So again, tucked in, seam to the outside.
[04:14:29.430 --> 04:14:34.150]  This'll be a really big press for me at least.
[04:14:34.150 --> 04:14:37.390]  And someone asked what brand of bubble bags are you using?
[04:14:39.790 --> 04:14:41.750]  I use Rosin Evolution Full Mesh.
[04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:44.430]  So we're not gonna make the mistake
[04:14:44.430 --> 04:14:46.470]  that we did last time, we're gonna leave the paper
[04:14:46.470 --> 04:14:48.110]  sticking out of the presses,
[04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:50.550]  and that lets the oil that rolls off of them
[04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:52.230]  to not stick to the press.
[04:14:57.270 --> 04:14:59.510]  This is the grand finale, right?
[04:14:59.510 --> 04:15:01.430]  No, I actually realized I've got another one back there,
[04:15:01.430 --> 04:15:06.110]  not this big, but it is 420 yards,
[04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:08.550]  so let's do this right.
[04:15:09.550 --> 04:15:14.250]  Oh yeah, dab it up.
[04:15:19.820 --> 04:15:24.460]  So again, this is take it slow, let those bags adjust.
[04:15:24.460 --> 04:15:26.460]  If you go really fast, those bags will spread
[04:15:26.460 --> 04:15:30.940]  and then you'll change the micron of each specific area
[04:15:30.940 --> 04:15:35.140]  and you don't get as consistent of a press.
[04:15:35.140 --> 04:15:37.900]  You just take it slow, like I've just got
[04:15:37.900 --> 04:15:39.300]  hand pressure on this thing.
[04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:47.710]  My wife came downstairs and was wondering what I was doing.
[04:15:47.710 --> 04:15:48.710]  I was like, we're all sitting here
[04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:50.230]  waiting for the money shots.
[04:15:54.230 --> 04:15:55.550]  Yeah, my wife texted me and was like,
[04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:58.150]  I think we have chicken, what do you want for supper?
[04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:04.030]  Yeah, but all of our spouses are wondering what the hell,
[04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:06.150]  because I'm usually done by now.
[04:16:06.150 --> 04:16:09.030]  I know, we're just over here watching oil move.
[04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:10.590]  This is beautiful though, man.
[04:16:15.460 --> 04:16:17.380]  So this is the time, if you press really hard
[04:16:17.380 --> 04:16:20.020]  and really fast, you're gonna end up with a blowout.
[04:16:20.940 --> 04:16:22.660]  It's not coming out as fast.
[04:16:22.660 --> 04:16:26.220]  My temperatures are a little bit lower, so it does that.
[04:16:28.860 --> 04:16:33.460]  Again, if you feel it, you know that there's some restriction
[04:16:33.460 --> 04:16:36.100]  compared to the last one, which just ran out.
[04:16:44.820 --> 04:16:46.580]  He's growing some legs now, man.
[04:16:46.580 --> 04:16:47.900]  Look at that shit run.
[04:16:49.780 --> 04:16:50.620]  There we go.
[04:16:52.700 --> 04:16:57.700]  We need a color commentary, man, or play by play.
[04:17:03.660 --> 04:17:05.460]  We need a tasting test.
[04:17:09.820 --> 04:17:12.180]  You know, John Madden and Al Michaels.
[04:17:13.380 --> 04:17:15.140]  I'm gonna have a tasting test.
[04:17:17.740 --> 04:17:18.580]  But again, if you guys-
[04:17:18.580 --> 04:17:20.340]  Usually there's so many issues with this
[04:17:20.340 --> 04:17:22.260]  for people that have never seen this before.
[04:17:22.260 --> 04:17:25.340]  So just another kudos for you, Andy,
[04:17:25.340 --> 04:17:28.580]  taking the time to show all of the intricate things
[04:17:28.580 --> 04:17:30.860]  that are needed to get it to flow like this.
[04:17:34.700 --> 04:17:36.260]  Notice my needle.
[04:17:36.260 --> 04:17:38.580]  My needle's starting to rise a little bit.
[04:17:38.580 --> 04:17:40.260]  So that means I'm getting pretty well everything out
[04:17:40.260 --> 04:17:41.540]  that I need to get out.
[04:17:41.540 --> 04:17:43.180]  I know there's probably a lot in the bag
[04:17:43.180 --> 04:17:44.940]  because what I've seen, or not in the bag,
[04:17:44.940 --> 04:17:46.660]  but it'll be in the directional flow
[04:17:46.660 --> 04:17:48.020]  of the paper that I folded.
[04:17:49.020 --> 04:17:52.260]  Because generally there'd be a little bit more
[04:17:52.260 --> 04:17:53.620]  squeezing out of the front.
[04:17:54.620 --> 04:17:56.180]  But you can see color and consistency.
[04:17:56.180 --> 04:17:57.940]  This is farmed organically.
[04:17:57.940 --> 04:18:01.500]  What I use for foliar sprays, as far as IPM management,
[04:18:01.500 --> 04:18:03.380]  is I use Dr. Zimes.
[04:18:03.380 --> 04:18:05.420]  And I use Dr. Zimes on their heavy dose.
[04:18:05.420 --> 04:18:07.660]  I do it once a week from about the middle of June
[04:18:07.660 --> 04:18:09.460]  until about the middle of August.
[04:18:09.460 --> 04:18:10.860]  Yes, that puts me into flower.
[04:18:10.860 --> 04:18:14.020]  I do not have a problem spraying Dr. Zimes on flower at all.
[04:18:15.260 --> 04:18:16.700]  So after the middle of August,
[04:18:16.700 --> 04:18:18.980]  what I've realized is that the buds are dense enough.
[04:18:18.980 --> 04:18:21.860]  It won't really matter if I spray the whole plant.
[04:18:21.860 --> 04:18:24.700]  So I need to be more, notice I'm over three minutes,
[04:18:24.700 --> 04:18:26.500]  I'm not paying attention here.
[04:18:26.500 --> 04:18:27.540]  Close to four.
[04:18:29.940 --> 04:18:32.580]  Then I just go spot spray with a little hand sprayer.
[04:18:39.740 --> 04:18:41.660]  For those of you out there that like to support,
[04:18:41.660 --> 04:18:42.940]  as far as I understand still,
[04:18:42.940 --> 04:18:46.480]  Dr. Zimes is a family owned business.
[04:18:49.660 --> 04:18:51.140]  I like their stuff, man.
[04:18:51.140 --> 04:18:54.540]  They have kept me out of more issues.
[04:18:54.540 --> 04:18:55.580]  The other one with the branding
[04:18:55.580 --> 04:18:57.460]  with the wizard on them and stuff?
[04:18:57.460 --> 04:18:58.540]  Yeah, that's correct.
[04:18:58.540 --> 04:19:00.700]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're based,
[04:19:00.700 --> 04:19:02.180]  started here in Colorado.
[04:19:03.100 --> 04:19:03.980]  So shout out to them,
[04:19:03.980 --> 04:19:05.660]  because they're, as far as I understand,
[04:19:05.660 --> 04:19:07.100]  a husband and wife team.
[04:19:07.100 --> 04:19:08.460]  Ooh, that's stinky.
[04:19:14.720 --> 04:19:16.620]  And then I've got one more for y'all.
[04:19:19.400 --> 04:19:21.760]  Yeah, just a second, man, fuck.
[04:19:23.120 --> 04:19:25.080]  And you guys, I hate to do this,
[04:19:25.080 --> 04:19:27.040]  but I got a three o'clock,
[04:19:27.040 --> 04:19:30.640]  and it's 25 minutes from here,
[04:19:30.640 --> 04:19:32.320]  so I'm gonna have to wind down.
[04:19:32.320 --> 04:19:34.640]  But dude, I can't thank you enough, man,
[04:19:34.640 --> 04:19:38.080]  for giving us four plus hours of your time
[04:19:38.080 --> 04:19:41.280]  to help educate this community
[04:19:41.280 --> 04:19:45.160]  that we've been a part of for over a year now.
[04:19:45.160 --> 04:19:48.040]  And I just love what you're doing with the earth,
[04:19:48.040 --> 04:19:49.280]  the respect you give it.
[04:19:50.240 --> 04:19:53.880]  You're an amazing human being, dude.
[04:19:53.880 --> 04:19:54.840]  Follow me in a sec.
[04:19:57.760 --> 04:19:59.760]  Were you just talking to me?
[04:19:59.760 --> 04:20:00.840]  Yeah.
[04:20:00.840 --> 04:20:02.600]  Sorry, you were saying something.
[04:20:02.600 --> 04:20:05.960]  I was unplugged.
[04:20:05.960 --> 04:20:07.520]  No, I was unplugged, and I plugged in.
[04:20:07.520 --> 04:20:09.840]  I heard you saying something about an amazing human being,
[04:20:09.840 --> 04:20:11.520]  and I was like, is he talking to me?
[04:20:11.520 --> 04:20:12.360]  I was.
[04:20:12.360 --> 04:20:14.640]  And I guess you were, so I caught the very end of that.
[04:20:14.640 --> 04:20:17.880]  I appreciate whatever well words were in that.
[04:20:17.920 --> 04:20:20.680]  If there's any foul words, thanks, I guess, for that too.
[04:20:20.680 --> 04:20:22.240]  But anyway.
[04:20:22.240 --> 04:20:23.760]  I really appreciate it.
[04:20:23.760 --> 04:20:26.080]  It's inspired by this podcast.
[04:20:26.080 --> 04:20:28.480]  It's inspired by all the free knowledge
[04:20:28.480 --> 04:20:30.760]  that I've been given so many times.
[04:20:30.760 --> 04:20:32.160]  It's like we have to give that back.
[04:20:32.160 --> 04:20:33.720]  We're screwed if we don't.
[04:20:33.720 --> 04:20:36.080]  Right, that's what it's all about.
[04:20:36.080 --> 04:20:38.160]  The more you give, the more you get.
[04:20:38.160 --> 04:20:40.080]  But I gotta bounce.
[04:20:40.080 --> 04:20:41.560]  I've got a three o'clock meeting.
[04:20:41.560 --> 04:20:43.680]  I haven't eaten anything yet,
[04:20:43.680 --> 04:20:45.240]  and it's about 25 minutes away,
[04:20:45.240 --> 04:20:47.600]  so I got 10 minutes to stuff something down my throat
[04:20:48.240 --> 04:20:49.080]  and get some coffee.
[04:20:49.080 --> 04:20:51.280]  But again, I appreciate what you've done,
[04:20:51.280 --> 04:20:54.480]  giving us four hours and 20 minutes.
[04:20:55.760 --> 04:20:57.640]  Well, this can be our outro.
[04:20:57.640 --> 04:21:02.240]  We'll fade to black once this press finishes.
[04:21:04.320 --> 04:21:05.240]  Excellent.
[04:21:05.240 --> 04:21:07.920]  And we'll cut to shirtless right said Fred
[04:21:07.920 --> 04:21:08.920]  right before that.
[04:21:11.400 --> 04:21:13.040]  So this one goes to.
[04:21:13.040 --> 04:21:14.280]  Peter, thanks as always.
[04:21:14.280 --> 04:21:16.040]  Brian, great job as always.
[04:21:16.400 --> 04:21:19.240]  I'll catch you guys next Thursday.
[04:21:19.240 --> 04:21:20.880]  Layton, thank you so much for your time, sir.
[04:21:20.880 --> 04:21:22.240]  I really appreciate it.
[04:21:22.240 --> 04:21:23.640]  See you later.
[04:21:23.640 --> 04:21:24.640]  Deep respect, brother.
[04:21:24.640 --> 04:21:26.840]  Deep respect for the work you're doing.
[04:21:26.840 --> 04:21:27.680]  Fucking huge.
[04:21:31.000 --> 04:21:32.760]  All right, peace out, everybody.
[04:21:32.760 --> 04:21:33.600]  See ya.
[04:21:34.920 --> 04:21:38.720]  Just quickly, someone asked, no, I lost it.
[04:21:41.720 --> 04:21:44.120]  I think it was, can you hear me or no?
[04:21:44.120 --> 04:21:45.240]  I can totally hear you, yeah.
[04:21:45.280 --> 04:21:47.280]  Okay, because I was about to say something
[04:21:47.280 --> 04:21:51.440]  totally emotionally charged and complimentary of you
[04:21:51.440 --> 04:21:52.720]  and I didn't want you to miss it.
[04:21:52.720 --> 04:21:53.560]  No, I'm joking.
[04:21:57.200 --> 04:22:01.880]  With time and so I think someone asked a question
[04:22:01.880 --> 04:22:04.760]  about your freezer or your freeze dryer.
[04:22:04.760 --> 04:22:07.760]  What is this freeze and dry time?
[04:22:09.200 --> 04:22:12.640]  And then the plate temps, I assume these plates.
[04:22:13.640 --> 04:22:17.360]  Yeah, so freeze dry and dry time,
[04:22:17.360 --> 04:22:19.760]  maybe 12 hours, final dry.
[04:22:19.760 --> 04:22:21.960]  My freeze time is 10 hours.
[04:22:21.960 --> 04:22:24.240]  You don't necessarily need 10 hours.
[04:22:24.240 --> 04:22:26.840]  I think you need a minimum of six,
[04:22:26.840 --> 04:22:28.640]  but if you can do 10, do 10.
[04:22:28.640 --> 04:22:29.880]  It doesn't hurt anything.
[04:22:31.960 --> 04:22:33.280]  And then I set my shelf limit.
[04:22:33.280 --> 04:22:36.320]  I used to set it at 35 and I suggest anyone,
[04:22:36.320 --> 04:22:38.640]  shelf limit needs to be below 40,
[04:22:38.640 --> 04:22:41.560]  below 40 degrees no matter what,
[04:22:41.920 --> 04:22:43.200]  if you're doing hash.
[04:22:43.200 --> 04:22:45.000]  First time I ever did hash, I stuck it in there
[04:22:45.000 --> 04:22:47.080]  and we brought it out and it looked like glass.
[04:22:47.080 --> 04:22:48.240]  And it was like, what the crap?
[04:22:48.240 --> 04:22:50.200]  Well, yeah, it'd been 135 degrees.
[04:22:51.080 --> 04:22:53.360]  It was basically decarbed and ready to go.
[04:22:55.040 --> 04:22:57.840]  So shelf limit, I do five degrees
[04:22:57.840 --> 04:23:01.720]  and that's all props to Humphrey Hash, five degrees.
[04:23:01.720 --> 04:23:03.160]  And that allows it to be carefully
[04:23:03.160 --> 04:23:07.040]  not to evaporate off as much or not at all really
[04:23:07.040 --> 04:23:11.240]  because it's not its vaporization point
[04:23:11.920 --> 04:23:13.000]  and still gets all your water off too.
[04:23:13.000 --> 04:23:15.680]  You're gonna extend your dry time by a couple hours,
[04:23:15.680 --> 04:23:18.080]  but really it's been all year growing this.
[04:23:18.080 --> 04:23:20.080]  Like what's a few more hours?
[04:23:20.920 --> 04:23:23.680]  I say that, I also know that I'm incredibly impatient
[04:23:24.680 --> 04:23:27.400]  and a few more hours can mean the world.
[04:23:28.840 --> 04:23:30.200]  And then on the press side,
[04:23:30.200 --> 04:23:32.960]  what temperature are you setting these plates at?
[04:23:32.960 --> 04:23:34.760]  These are 163.4.
[04:23:37.160 --> 04:23:39.480]  I just do that because 73 is centigrade
[04:23:39.480 --> 04:23:44.240]  and 163 is always, seems to be a really low temp,
[04:23:44.240 --> 04:23:46.200]  but it always does really well for me.
[04:23:47.880 --> 04:23:49.840]  And so this is Sunshine Bowl.
[04:23:49.840 --> 04:23:51.760]  Sunshine Bowl is mango ash plant
[04:23:51.760 --> 04:23:54.640]  crossed with banana, puddin tang and goji oji.
[04:23:54.640 --> 04:23:59.000]  So it's got some, it's been an awesome strength.
[04:23:59.000 --> 04:23:59.840]  Bread by Shaggy.
[04:23:59.840 --> 04:24:01.440]  Sounds tropical.
[04:24:01.440 --> 04:24:02.600]  It can be.
[04:24:02.600 --> 04:24:06.480]  One of the phenoses is very, very fruit forward
[04:24:06.480 --> 04:24:09.320]  kind of banana, osmium dominant
[04:24:10.160 --> 04:24:12.440]  and then last year was real peach rings.
[04:24:12.440 --> 04:24:14.080]  And this year the two phenoses I have,
[04:24:14.080 --> 04:24:15.240]  one was real hazy and limey
[04:24:15.240 --> 04:24:18.120]  and the other one is again kind of that tropical fruit,
[04:24:18.120 --> 04:24:20.280]  but a lot of floral this year.
[04:24:20.280 --> 04:24:21.120]  Okay.
[04:24:24.520 --> 04:24:26.720]  I'll turn this around.
[04:24:26.720 --> 04:24:28.400]  So are we gonna, is this gonna be it?
[04:24:28.400 --> 04:24:30.080]  You think we're just pushing time?
[04:24:31.040 --> 04:24:32.840]  What do you want to do one more?
[04:24:32.840 --> 04:24:35.440]  Or what was, what's up next?
[04:24:35.440 --> 04:24:38.400]  What I was gonna do is do a little bit of flower rosin.
[04:24:38.400 --> 04:24:39.240]  Sure.
[04:24:40.080 --> 04:24:42.960]  I can probably throw it together really quick.
[04:24:44.240 --> 04:24:45.800]  You guys can just see it whipped up real quick
[04:24:45.800 --> 04:24:48.160]  and then we'll be able to just do one press of it
[04:24:48.160 --> 04:24:50.480]  and I can show you guys that, that work.
[04:24:50.480 --> 04:24:51.320]  Yeah.
[04:24:51.320 --> 04:24:52.840]  Brian, you're with Leighton gone.
[04:24:52.840 --> 04:24:53.880]  You're gonna be the,
[04:24:55.040 --> 04:24:57.280]  you're gonna be filling up the dead space.
[04:24:58.920 --> 04:24:59.760]  I'm not as good as someone else for sure.
[04:24:59.760 --> 04:25:00.840]  We're galling us with,
[04:25:02.040 --> 04:25:03.480]  could go in any direction.
[04:25:05.120 --> 04:25:07.080]  No tin foil hats today.
[04:25:07.080 --> 04:25:08.400]  When I start the flyer rosin,
[04:25:08.400 --> 04:25:12.200]  I increase my plate temp to 195.
[04:25:12.200 --> 04:25:14.280]  So I'm just increasing that right now
[04:25:14.280 --> 04:25:16.480]  because it takes a bit for the temps to come up,
[04:25:16.480 --> 04:25:18.000]  the plates to come up to temp.
[04:25:18.000 --> 04:25:21.600]  Now, Brian, Brian, you mentioned something to me about
[04:25:21.600 --> 04:25:24.680]  just kind of showing people the raw of the whole thing.
[04:25:24.680 --> 04:25:27.280]  And that's exactly what I wanted to do here was
[04:25:29.280 --> 04:25:33.360]  I just grabbed some flower that I didn't put beforehand.
[04:25:33.360 --> 04:25:36.640]  I planned on this being flower.
[04:25:37.480 --> 04:25:40.480]  So you can see here, this is sunshine bowl number one,
[04:25:40.480 --> 04:25:42.080]  still got the sugar leaves on.
[04:25:42.080 --> 04:25:43.120]  I'm gonna remove every leaf
[04:25:43.120 --> 04:25:45.240]  that doesn't have some trichomes on it.
[04:25:45.240 --> 04:25:47.560]  And that's just how I'm gonna prep for flower rosin.
[04:25:47.560 --> 04:25:50.960]  So just, you just peel them off with your finger.
[04:25:50.960 --> 04:25:52.960]  You don't have to use trimming scissors.
[04:25:53.960 --> 04:25:56.880]  Basically, if you can, if you can grab ahold of something,
[04:25:58.480 --> 04:26:00.400]  cool bot, I would love to have a cool bot
[04:26:00.400 --> 04:26:02.960]  because here's, here's why the fuck why.
[04:26:02.960 --> 04:26:04.400]  Look at that brick.
[04:26:04.400 --> 04:26:05.600]  That is a brick of ice.
[04:26:06.880 --> 04:26:08.920]  The light bulb, so little tip,
[04:26:08.920 --> 04:26:10.960]  the light bulb is pressed up against the thermometer
[04:26:10.960 --> 04:26:14.360]  on the front of that air conditioner.
[04:26:14.360 --> 04:26:16.560]  That light bulb keeps the temp in the room
[04:26:16.560 --> 04:26:18.720]  according to the thermometer,
[04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:20.440]  temp in the room higher than what it really is.
[04:26:20.440 --> 04:26:23.280]  So that air conditioner thinks it's like 75 in here
[04:26:23.280 --> 04:26:24.760]  because the light bulb's so close.
[04:26:24.760 --> 04:26:28.680]  That's how cool bot works is it keeps that hot and cold.
[04:26:28.680 --> 04:26:31.040]  Cool bot's genius because it keeps it from freezing up
[04:26:31.040 --> 04:26:32.320]  like this as opposed to me,
[04:26:32.320 --> 04:26:33.920]  where I'm trying to do a live show,
[04:26:33.920 --> 04:26:35.640]  jump over there, turn the ice brick
[04:26:35.640 --> 04:26:39.200]  into like flowing air again, sorry over,
[04:26:39.200 --> 04:26:41.200]  but anyway, I'm just trimming off
[04:26:41.200 --> 04:26:43.440]  some of these sugar leaves here
[04:26:43.440 --> 04:26:45.520]  and then I'm gonna break this nugget
[04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:51.990]  and biggest thing with flour rousing,
[04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:53.750]  try to get away from these big stems.
[04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:55.150]  These poke holes through your bags.
[04:26:55.150 --> 04:26:56.470]  It's really the only thing.
[04:27:05.150 --> 04:27:08.310]  And I'm gonna just keep the camera up here.
[04:27:08.310 --> 04:27:09.510]  You guys can ask any questions,
[04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:11.150]  I'll get through this pretty quick.
[04:27:12.150 --> 04:27:17.150]  Yeah, for the viewers, this is a much faster process.
[04:27:17.310 --> 04:27:20.150]  You guys are gonna obviously notice that.
[04:27:21.430 --> 04:27:22.950]  Yeah, you don't have to freeze dry.
[04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:24.510]  You don't have to go through that whole thing.
[04:27:24.510 --> 04:27:27.110]  It's just, it's really easy.
[04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:28.790]  And with this, so with flour rousing,
[04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:29.750]  it's a little bit different.
[04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:33.870]  Your plate pressure and your temp helps do a couple things.
[04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:35.790]  One, the mechanical part of it helps push the oil out
[04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:37.550]  just like it does with hash rousing.
[04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:42.710]  And it can squeeze chlorophyll out
[04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:45.070]  if you have too much water.
[04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:46.830]  So you have to be cautious of that.
[04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:49.270]  So what I'm gonna do when I'm pressing for flour rousing
[04:27:49.270 --> 04:27:53.190]  is I want that bag to get squished down warm, slowly,
[04:27:53.190 --> 04:27:55.430]  so that that bag shapes to the flour.
[04:27:55.430 --> 04:27:57.510]  I use a barrel tech.
[04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:59.830]  I'm sure people don't know what barrel tech is.
[04:27:59.830 --> 04:28:02.630]  Barrel tech is where instead of laying the bag sideways,
[04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:06.550]  like you do with hash rousing, you just stand it vertical.
[04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:09.830]  And so I'm gonna stand the bag vertical.
[04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:11.150]  There's a couple reasons for that.
[04:28:11.150 --> 04:28:13.630]  The way I understand it is a vertical bag.
[04:28:14.590 --> 04:28:15.630]  And I don't know plate pressure,
[04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:17.310]  there's a whole bunch on how to do all that.
[04:28:17.310 --> 04:28:20.110]  I know there's some people that are very well versed in it.
[04:28:20.110 --> 04:28:21.790]  That's part of my algebra in high school.
[04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:23.690]  They just kind of buzzed over my head.
[04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:26.950]  But what I understand it is whenever you do a barrel,
[04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:29.910]  you have a one inch square surface area
[04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:32.310]  where all the pressure's being applied.
[04:28:32.310 --> 04:28:34.390]  Whereas if you have like a three by six bag,
[04:28:34.390 --> 04:28:37.110]  you can have up to six inches of pressure,
[04:28:37.110 --> 04:28:39.390]  of area that that pressure's being applied.
[04:28:39.390 --> 04:28:42.070]  And so your pressure per inch is less
[04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:43.950]  whenever it gets bigger.
[04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:48.790]  So a barrel tech, no matter if it's in this case,
[04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:51.470]  you know, six, seven grams in a big bag,
[04:28:51.470 --> 04:28:53.830]  or two or three in a smaller bag,
[04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:55.230]  that I showed you guys,
[04:28:55.230 --> 04:28:59.350]  it's still kind of the same plate pressure.
[04:29:03.400 --> 04:29:04.400]  And I'm not gonna weigh this out.
[04:29:04.400 --> 04:29:06.760]  I'm just kind of, I'm not as good as your homeboy
[04:29:07.600 --> 04:29:08.440]  that can just like weigh it in his hand,
[04:29:08.440 --> 04:29:10.600]  but this will fill up a bag enough
[04:29:10.600 --> 04:29:12.800]  to kind of show people what we're working with.
[04:29:16.580 --> 04:29:19.140]  And again, I'm just trying to eliminate that big stem out.
[04:29:19.140 --> 04:29:20.300]  Can't eliminate all the stems,
[04:29:20.300 --> 04:29:22.140]  but if you're not gonna smoke the stem,
[04:29:22.140 --> 04:29:25.320]  no, don't put it in your press.
[04:29:38.540 --> 04:29:40.580]  37 micron.
[04:29:40.580 --> 04:29:42.300]  I'm only gonna use one bag.
[04:29:42.300 --> 04:29:43.900]  I'm not double bagging these.
[04:29:43.900 --> 04:29:44.900]  I'm only using one.
[04:29:50.080 --> 04:29:52.400]  Big bag, we're gonna trim it down.
[04:29:52.400 --> 04:29:54.280]  I'm gonna refill it with Fly Rosin.
[04:29:54.280 --> 04:29:55.860]  Little nuggets, small.
[04:29:57.440 --> 04:29:58.880]  Push them into those corners,
[04:29:59.840 --> 04:30:02.040]  into the corner of the bag, right there.
[04:30:02.040 --> 04:30:03.980]  Get all those spots filled.
[04:30:05.080 --> 04:30:06.560]  It's gonna make it easier whenever you press.
[04:30:06.560 --> 04:30:08.560]  It also makes the press more consistent.
[04:30:09.080 --> 04:30:15.740]  So I highly suggest Fly Rosin at home.
[04:30:15.740 --> 04:30:18.380]  If you're on a budget, I mean, think about it.
[04:30:18.380 --> 04:30:20.020]  If you're dealing with concentrates
[04:30:20.020 --> 04:30:22.380]  that may not be the best in the world
[04:30:22.380 --> 04:30:24.820]  or the cleanest or whatever, Instagram worthy,
[04:30:24.820 --> 04:30:26.600]  but like, they're not bad.
[04:30:26.600 --> 04:30:28.420]  So this bag's about half full.
[04:30:28.420 --> 04:30:30.100]  Just, we're just gonna do this.
[04:30:33.540 --> 04:30:35.220]  How do you always misplace the scissors?
[04:30:35.220 --> 04:30:37.060]  Can someone answer me that?
[04:30:37.180 --> 04:30:41.640]  How do the scissors always disappear?
[04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:48.070]  So, you get the south scissors.
[04:30:51.510 --> 04:30:52.350]  This is a problem.
[04:30:52.350 --> 04:30:54.730]  I think you set some stuff on another table.
[04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:59.750]  I've set a lot on another table.
[04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:02.470]  Okay, well, whatever.
[04:31:02.470 --> 04:31:03.430]  This is the seam side.
[04:31:03.430 --> 04:31:06.350]  Again, push the seam in first.
[04:31:06.350 --> 04:31:07.270]  Why do I do that?
[04:31:07.270 --> 04:31:08.470]  It's just habit.
[04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:09.830]  It doesn't matter.
[04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:12.070]  It's not gonna make your yield better.
[04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.910]  It's just habit.
[04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:14.990]  Push the seam in first, fold this over.
[04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:18.830]  Since I'm not cutting this off,
[04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:22.990]  I'm gonna fold it a couple times and put it on top.
[04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:24.590]  Barrel tech, it's a barrel.
[04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:26.430]  You're gonna stand it up like a barrel.
[04:31:26.430 --> 04:31:27.510]  See that?
[04:31:27.510 --> 04:31:29.110]  All the extra is on top.
[04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:31.710]  There's nothing on the bottom, okay?
[04:31:31.710 --> 04:31:34.410]  With barrel tech, I am doing things a bit differently.
[04:31:36.230 --> 04:31:38.430]  So I'm not gonna do a directional bag,
[04:31:39.390 --> 04:31:40.230]  because there's flour on them.
[04:31:40.230 --> 04:31:42.310]  I just wanna get the oil out of the flour
[04:31:46.320 --> 04:31:50.080]  and on the parchment.
[04:31:59.750 --> 04:32:04.190]  So I noticed, forgive me if this isn't the right analogy,
[04:32:04.190 --> 04:32:07.150]  but you went more for chunky peanut butter,
[04:32:07.150 --> 04:32:09.950]  where I see a lot more people break it down for smooth,
[04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.930]  putting it in the bag.
[04:32:11.930 --> 04:32:14.110]  Chunky peanut butter for flour on the bag?
[04:32:14.110 --> 04:32:15.590]  Putting the flour in the bag.
[04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:18.470]  Seems like you left it be a little bit chunkier there
[04:32:18.470 --> 04:32:21.350]  than other people seem to refine it a little more.
[04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:24.810]  Tomato, tomato.
[04:32:27.230 --> 04:32:29.750]  Well, I was just, is there, is there?
[04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:30.590]  Oh, wow.
[04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:36.630]  Someone asked what micron size bags you're using right now.
[04:32:38.150 --> 04:32:41.310]  These are 37 micron Ross and Evo bags.
[04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:44.150]  If you wanted to, you could do 25.
[04:32:44.150 --> 04:32:45.270]  That's not a problem at all.
[04:32:46.110 --> 04:32:47.630]  I'm just doing 37, that's what I grabbed.
[04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:50.670]  25 makes a little bit more of a refined flour rosin,
[04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:53.470]  but it doesn't have to be.
[04:32:53.470 --> 04:32:55.830]  So I'm gonna turn the computer around and grab my light
[04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:58.230]  and then we'll be swishing.
[04:32:59.670 --> 04:33:04.590]  Yeah, I think scissors, Sharpies, and X-Acto knives
[04:33:04.590 --> 04:33:08.470]  are what I am looking for the most and can't find the most.
[04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:11.730]  So I just have tons of all of them and shears.
[04:33:12.530 --> 04:33:16.450]  Yeah, oh, trimming scissors.
[04:33:16.450 --> 04:33:18.370]  Yeah, we're all trimming scissors.
[04:33:23.340 --> 04:33:24.460]  So y'all hear me just fine?
[04:33:24.460 --> 04:33:25.620]  Everything's okay?
[04:33:27.020 --> 04:33:27.860]  Yeah.
[04:33:32.740 --> 04:33:34.020]  So I'm at 90.
[04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:44.290]  Stopwatch going here.
[04:33:45.290 --> 04:33:51.900]  Okay, so open your plates.
[04:33:54.100 --> 04:33:57.020]  And then this, generally with these big bags,
[04:33:57.020 --> 04:33:57.940]  it's only seven grams.
[04:33:57.940 --> 04:33:59.620]  The other bags are like three.
[04:33:59.620 --> 04:34:01.340]  And that's the only thing we can get with height.
[04:34:01.340 --> 04:34:04.140]  You can get a lot more flour into these things.
[04:34:04.140 --> 04:34:06.260]  And I know people that do flour rosin
[04:34:06.260 --> 04:34:08.180]  that have like pre-presses
[04:34:09.460 --> 04:34:11.020]  and they pre-press their flour rosin
[04:34:11.020 --> 04:34:12.500]  and I think that's great.
[04:34:12.500 --> 04:34:14.020]  It's another way to get more in the bag.
[04:34:14.020 --> 04:34:16.940]  This is just for home.
[04:34:17.780 --> 04:34:19.420]  Wow, this is like the worst it's ever gone in.
[04:34:19.420 --> 04:34:20.660]  Okay, here we go.
[04:34:21.980 --> 04:34:22.900]  In the bag.
[04:34:26.860 --> 04:34:28.140]  And here we go, okay.
[04:34:30.620 --> 04:34:33.580]  Three minute rule applies to no matter what you're doing.
[04:34:35.140 --> 04:34:37.740]  Yeah, I like to keep everything under three minutes.
[04:34:38.900 --> 04:34:40.640]  Notice I'm going down slow.
[04:34:40.640 --> 04:34:45.080]  That bag is crinkling and pinching and moving and flexing.
[04:34:45.080 --> 04:34:46.220]  And I know there's areas there
[04:34:46.220 --> 04:34:48.020]  that are not 37 micron anymore.
[04:34:48.020 --> 04:34:49.860]  They're gonna get pushed out and spread.
[04:34:49.860 --> 04:34:51.460]  That's okay.
[04:34:51.460 --> 04:34:52.760]  It's flour rosin.
[04:34:53.620 --> 04:34:55.020]  But right now you just get slow.
[04:34:55.020 --> 04:34:57.860]  And then as soon as you start seeing oil,
[04:34:57.860 --> 04:34:59.300]  I'm gonna look in here.
[04:34:59.300 --> 04:35:01.460]  As soon as I start seeing the oil move,
[04:35:05.900 --> 04:35:08.700]  as soon as I see that bag start getting wet
[04:35:08.700 --> 04:35:10.180]  and it start moving,
[04:35:10.180 --> 04:35:13.100]  I'm gonna start adding pressure at a pretty decent rate.
[04:35:13.100 --> 04:35:16.100]  I am adding pressure faster than I ever would
[04:35:16.180 --> 04:35:17.660]  with hash rosin.
[04:35:17.660 --> 04:35:21.940]  Because hash moves around in that bag and it's out.
[04:35:21.940 --> 04:35:25.460]  Notice I haven't seen any oil move just yet.
[04:35:25.460 --> 04:35:26.820]  So I'm watching my needle.
[04:35:27.820 --> 04:35:29.740]  My needle tells me what's up.
[04:35:29.740 --> 04:35:34.740]  It's like flying by what is visual flight rules, VFR,
[04:35:35.260 --> 04:35:36.900]  as opposed to flying by instruments.
[04:35:36.900 --> 04:35:38.800]  This is kind of flying by instruments.
[04:35:42.340 --> 04:35:43.820]  I noticed flour rosin,
[04:35:43.820 --> 04:35:46.340]  usually I'm done with it a lot quicker.
[04:35:46.340 --> 04:35:49.420]  So under two and a half minutes, generally I'm finished.
[04:35:49.420 --> 04:35:51.660]  Right here I'm at 3000 PSI.
[04:35:51.660 --> 04:35:52.500]  Oh, there we go.
[04:35:52.500 --> 04:35:53.320]  There's some.
[04:36:03.550 --> 04:36:06.270]  Go close to 4000, turn and stop.
[04:36:06.270 --> 04:36:08.910]  I'm gonna let it sit there just a little bit and run.
[04:36:10.030 --> 04:36:12.030]  Whenever I kind of see the run slow down,
[04:36:12.030 --> 04:36:13.350]  again, observation,
[04:36:13.350 --> 04:36:14.830]  or I see that run start slowing down,
[04:36:14.830 --> 04:36:16.470]  I'm just gonna pull them.
[04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:18.590]  If I get to close to two and a half minutes,
[04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:19.830]  I'll just pull them.
[04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:22.030]  So you're getting some bubbles.
[04:36:22.030 --> 04:36:23.630]  That's pretty normal.
[04:36:23.630 --> 04:36:26.070]  Again, moisture is key, man.
[04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:27.670]  You've got some good moisture.
[04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:29.990]  It allows the steam to push the oil out
[04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:32.790]  from the plant material and out of the bag.
[04:36:32.790 --> 04:36:36.430]  And then I've never seen it with water left over.
[04:36:36.430 --> 04:36:37.910]  I think you would have water left over
[04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:39.830]  if you took like really fresh buds.
[04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:42.750]  So yeah, two and a half, two 15, it's pretty well done.
[04:36:45.670 --> 04:36:46.510]  Notice here,
[04:36:58.400 --> 04:36:59.240]  all
[04:37:05.940 --> 04:37:07.900]  Peter, is that happening on your end?
[04:37:09.340 --> 04:37:10.900]  That's what I was trying to figure out.
[04:37:10.900 --> 04:37:11.740]  Oh, there we are.
[04:37:11.740 --> 04:37:13.060]  We're back.
[04:37:13.060 --> 04:37:15.020]  But then I didn't see you moving either.
[04:37:15.020 --> 04:37:16.660]  So I was like, maybe it's me.
[04:37:18.780 --> 04:37:19.900]  All right, here we go.
[04:37:26.540 --> 04:37:27.380]  Oh.
[04:37:35.100 --> 04:37:35.940]  There he is.
[04:37:38.020 --> 04:37:38.860]  All right.
[04:37:40.380 --> 04:37:41.660]  Someone asked what,
[04:37:46.610 --> 04:37:49.450]  can you hear me?
[04:37:49.450 --> 04:37:51.210]  His bandwidth isn't keeping up.
[04:37:52.650 --> 04:37:54.170]  What is his moisture content?
[04:37:54.170 --> 04:37:55.290]  Can you see that one?
[04:37:58.700 --> 04:37:59.540]  Did you close the door?
[04:37:59.540 --> 04:38:00.380]  Open it.
[04:38:00.380 --> 04:38:02.620]  It's not opening, give me just a second.
[04:38:02.620 --> 04:38:03.460]  Yeah.
[04:38:03.460 --> 04:38:04.540]  Open that door, please.
[04:38:05.820 --> 04:38:08.380]  I've queued up our outro song
[04:38:08.380 --> 04:38:09.900]  while you were doing all that.
[04:38:11.140 --> 04:38:12.660]  Do you see that question?
[04:38:12.660 --> 04:38:14.780]  That should be just a little bit better.
[04:38:14.780 --> 04:38:16.660]  Okay, what is your moisture content?
[04:38:17.620 --> 04:38:19.140]  My answer on the moisture content is this.
[04:38:19.140 --> 04:38:21.500]  I don't know because I don't have a hydrometer,
[04:38:21.500 --> 04:38:25.620]  but what I do is I add the 58 or 62%
[04:38:25.620 --> 04:38:27.780]  both via or boost packs to my flour
[04:38:27.780 --> 04:38:29.660]  two to three days before I press it.
[04:38:29.660 --> 04:38:31.220]  That helps even everything out.
[04:38:32.900 --> 04:38:35.380]  I wish I could tell you a hydrometer on it exactly,
[04:38:35.380 --> 04:38:36.980]  but moisture is important.
[04:38:36.980 --> 04:38:39.740]  That's why I just throw these in.
[04:38:41.100 --> 04:38:42.860]  Yeah, I can unfold that parchment.
[04:38:42.860 --> 04:38:45.860]  You want the parchment for the flour, Rossum?
[04:38:45.860 --> 04:38:46.740]  I believe so.
[04:38:47.340 --> 04:38:51.860]  Yeah, you're frozen there for 30 seconds, 45 seconds.
[04:39:00.660 --> 04:39:02.860]  See, a lot of people don't like flour, Rossum,
[04:39:02.860 --> 04:39:04.420]  because the clarity just sucks.
[04:39:04.420 --> 04:39:08.300]  A lot of people go in with no Rossum bags at all.
[04:39:08.300 --> 04:39:10.580]  So what you end up with is a lot of plant material
[04:39:10.580 --> 04:39:11.580]  and contaminants.
[04:39:11.580 --> 04:39:14.540]  Again, way less contaminants than smoking a joint
[04:39:14.540 --> 04:39:16.900]  for the cannabinoids, but still,
[04:39:16.900 --> 04:39:18.580]  something that you probably won't desire,
[04:39:18.580 --> 04:39:20.780]  especially if you're smoking concentrates.
[04:39:20.780 --> 04:39:23.020]  So this just gives the ability.
[04:39:23.020 --> 04:39:25.700]  I mean, it's clear.
[04:39:25.700 --> 04:39:26.660]  It's insane.
[04:39:26.660 --> 04:39:28.820]  And that's just the 37-bag doing its thing.
[04:39:33.280 --> 04:39:35.200]  Yeah, I think from another standpoint
[04:39:35.200 --> 04:39:36.240]  and maybe where you're coming from
[04:39:36.240 --> 04:39:39.000]  is how long it used to take to break up,
[04:39:39.000 --> 04:39:41.760]  unfold a blunt, like an Optimo or something.
[04:39:41.760 --> 04:39:43.120]  I mean, that would take like 30 minutes
[04:39:43.120 --> 04:39:43.960]  to kind of do that stuff
[04:39:43.960 --> 04:39:46.240]  where you could press your own flour, Rossum,
[04:39:46.240 --> 04:39:47.800]  in way less time.
[04:39:47.800 --> 04:39:49.440]  And I feel like enjoy it better,
[04:39:49.440 --> 04:39:52.080]  have a better high than also adding the tobacco
[04:39:52.080 --> 04:39:53.240]  and all that within it.
[04:39:55.640 --> 04:39:56.480]  So I feel like-
[04:39:56.480 --> 04:39:58.720]  Yeah, I mean, Brian, you and I talked yesterday.
[04:40:00.640 --> 04:40:03.680]  I learned about cannabis by smoking peach white ales
[04:40:03.680 --> 04:40:04.600]  with Reggie.
[04:40:06.320 --> 04:40:09.840]  And so people have got it so good today.
[04:40:09.840 --> 04:40:13.240]  You're smoking like 80, 90% cannabinoids processed
[04:40:13.240 --> 04:40:15.640]  solvency with no BHO.
[04:40:15.640 --> 04:40:17.120]  I mean, whoa.
[04:40:17.120 --> 04:40:19.240]  You're gonna complain about a little particulate?
[04:40:20.120 --> 04:40:21.000]  Come on, man.
[04:40:22.520 --> 04:40:23.680]  Some of you have never smoked weed
[04:40:23.680 --> 04:40:24.880]  through a freaking Coke can.
[04:40:24.880 --> 04:40:26.480]  That kind of shows.
[04:40:26.480 --> 04:40:30.720]  No, it's like, let's remember our roots a little bit.
[04:40:30.720 --> 04:40:32.640]  I'm not saying everyone goes smoke out of a Coke can.
[04:40:32.640 --> 04:40:34.240]  It's terrible for you.
[04:40:34.240 --> 04:40:35.920]  But you get what I'm saying?
[04:40:35.920 --> 04:40:38.400]  It's like IG wants to pick.
[04:40:38.400 --> 04:40:40.480]  And I feel like a lot of times people pick
[04:40:40.480 --> 04:40:42.160]  because they're trying to elevate their brand
[04:40:42.160 --> 04:40:44.480]  by knocking another brand down.
[04:40:44.480 --> 04:40:46.800]  And we're way bigger than that.
[04:40:46.800 --> 04:40:48.320]  We can do way better than that.
[04:40:48.360 --> 04:40:49.880]  If you're intimidated by another brand,
[04:40:49.880 --> 04:40:51.880]  don't criticize them.
[04:40:51.880 --> 04:40:53.720]  Go just be better.
[04:40:53.720 --> 04:40:57.000]  I really like, you wrote The Purple Cow.
[04:40:57.000 --> 04:40:58.040]  It's a book called The Purple Cow.
[04:40:58.040 --> 04:41:00.520]  And you wrote another one called The Icarus Deception.
[04:41:00.520 --> 04:41:02.760]  And it's by an author named Seth Godin.
[04:41:02.760 --> 04:41:04.400]  And in The Icarus Deception, it just says,
[04:41:04.400 --> 04:41:06.160]  just make better art.
[04:41:06.160 --> 04:41:07.000]  Make better art.
[04:41:07.000 --> 04:41:08.200]  People don't like it, make better art.
[04:41:08.200 --> 04:41:09.040]  Do it better.
[04:41:09.040 --> 04:41:09.880]  Just retry again.
[04:41:09.880 --> 04:41:11.000]  But don't try to convince people
[04:41:11.000 --> 04:41:13.280]  to take your shitty ass art.
[04:41:14.640 --> 04:41:15.480]  I mean, I guess you can.
[04:41:15.480 --> 04:41:17.280]  You can kind of do whatever you want.
[04:41:18.200 --> 04:41:20.560]  Anyway, I really hope that we will answer
[04:41:20.560 --> 04:41:22.400]  a lot of the questions today.
[04:41:22.400 --> 04:41:23.240]  Get through some of this.
[04:41:23.240 --> 04:41:25.880]  I think flour rosin has its place.
[04:41:27.440 --> 04:41:29.240]  Yeah, perfect.
[04:41:29.240 --> 04:41:32.200]  Is there a one-to-one strain you like?
[04:41:33.320 --> 04:41:34.600]  One-to-one flour rosin.
[04:41:34.600 --> 04:41:36.520]  You can't, you can't.
[04:41:36.520 --> 04:41:37.560]  I'm not saying you can't
[04:41:37.560 --> 04:41:39.440]  because I know that there's people that do.
[04:41:39.440 --> 04:41:43.560]  But you're not, it's not as easy to wash CBD strains
[04:41:43.560 --> 04:41:46.800]  or higher CBD strains as it is to wash
[04:41:47.200 --> 04:41:48.280]  something like Chimo.
[04:41:49.440 --> 04:41:53.480]  And flour rosin with one-to-ones is incredible.
[04:41:53.480 --> 04:41:55.920]  I have one that's shaggy root spread for me.
[04:41:55.920 --> 04:41:58.400]  And it's a ACBC crossed with blueberry.
[04:41:58.400 --> 04:41:59.800]  It's a DJ Shorts blueberry.
[04:41:59.800 --> 04:42:02.080]  You can use that mayo and cross it.
[04:42:02.080 --> 04:42:04.520]  I don't know if it's necessarily a one-to-one.
[04:42:04.520 --> 04:42:06.240]  I don't know about the Fino that I grew out,
[04:42:06.240 --> 04:42:09.400]  but I do know it just has this big OG flavor on it.
[04:42:09.400 --> 04:42:11.880]  And it doesn't elevate you the way
[04:42:11.880 --> 04:42:13.760]  that some of the higher THC strains do.
[04:42:13.800 --> 04:42:17.000]  So rosin presses are incredible for him,
[04:42:17.000 --> 04:42:18.880]  for people that can't smoke.
[04:42:18.880 --> 04:42:21.240]  I mean, I think a lot of people that can't smoke flour
[04:42:21.240 --> 04:42:23.320]  can probably smoke flour rosin.
[04:42:23.320 --> 04:42:25.640]  And if you're wanting to get into concentrates
[04:42:25.640 --> 04:42:27.880]  and flour rosin is a great stepping stone,
[04:42:28.840 --> 04:42:31.160]  don't care that everyone on Instagram says
[04:42:31.160 --> 04:42:33.080]  flour rosin is like Nickelback.
[04:42:33.080 --> 04:42:34.440]  Like just listen to Nickelback,
[04:42:34.440 --> 04:42:36.640]  roll the windows up and freaking jam out.
[04:42:37.520 --> 04:42:40.440]  Like, don't be afraid of it.
[04:42:40.440 --> 04:42:42.240]  Just do it.
[04:42:43.000 --> 04:42:45.600]  When did you last,
[04:42:45.600 --> 04:42:48.560]  when were you last in the car rocking the Nickelback?
[04:42:50.520 --> 04:42:51.920]  Oh, I'd never tell you that.
[04:42:51.920 --> 04:42:52.760]  Because-
[04:42:55.760 --> 04:42:57.960]  It may or may not have been three days ago.
[04:42:59.200 --> 04:43:01.760]  I hate to use Nickelback as such an easy target,
[04:43:01.760 --> 04:43:03.440]  but like we do it all the time.
[04:43:03.440 --> 04:43:06.680]  You know, like Instagram's algorithm prefers conflict.
[04:43:06.680 --> 04:43:13.080]  And whenever you're providing that,
[04:43:15.080 --> 04:43:17.640]  it really likes it and it keeps it up.
[04:43:17.640 --> 04:43:18.760]  And so people are like,
[04:43:18.760 --> 04:43:20.400]  I don't want to smoke flour rosin or whatever.
[04:43:20.400 --> 04:43:23.840]  It's like, well, maybe it's just not made good enough.
[04:43:23.840 --> 04:43:25.080]  Maybe the reason why you don't like
[04:43:25.080 --> 04:43:26.200]  some of the Oklahoma flours,
[04:43:26.200 --> 04:43:28.520]  because the farmers that can really do it justice
[04:43:28.520 --> 04:43:30.280]  haven't had access to it yet.
[04:43:31.160 --> 04:43:33.080]  It's not always the end all, be all.
[04:43:33.080 --> 04:43:34.560]  You can adjust.
[04:43:34.560 --> 04:43:37.040]  So I hope the flour rosin really helped people out.
[04:43:37.080 --> 04:43:39.440]  I know it got me through a really hard time last year.
[04:43:39.440 --> 04:43:41.880]  I had tons of flour and it was like,
[04:43:41.880 --> 04:43:44.080]  ah, I don't smoke much flour.
[04:43:45.240 --> 04:43:46.280]  I rather smoke concentrate,
[04:43:46.280 --> 04:43:48.880]  something that's easier on my lungs.
[04:43:48.880 --> 04:43:49.880]  Flour rosin it was.
[04:43:51.000 --> 04:43:51.840]  Yeah.
[04:43:55.060 --> 04:43:57.500]  Grassy cultivars.
[04:43:57.500 --> 04:43:58.340]  Grassy ones.
[04:43:58.340 --> 04:43:59.620]  I mean like-
[04:43:59.620 --> 04:44:02.940]  Yeah, can you elaborate on that, Cheddar Bob?
[04:44:08.450 --> 04:44:10.410]  There, that makes much more sense.
[04:44:11.250 --> 04:44:13.010]  Good question.
[04:44:13.010 --> 04:44:14.610]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[04:44:14.610 --> 04:44:16.610]  Really greasy strains.
[04:44:16.610 --> 04:44:18.330]  So the one this morning that I had to deal with
[04:44:18.330 --> 04:44:19.490]  before the show,
[04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:21.890]  I had to deal with it whenever it's 42 degrees outside
[04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:24.810]  and I was able to get into this room and drop the temp.
[04:44:24.810 --> 04:44:26.450]  I got a nice break again.
[04:44:26.450 --> 04:44:28.090]  Drop the temp down and be able to work with it
[04:44:28.090 --> 04:44:29.570]  because when I pulled it out of the freeze dryer
[04:44:29.570 --> 04:44:32.650]  at seven degrees, that's scotoli,
[04:44:32.650 --> 04:44:34.770]  and it was plants two, three, and four.
[04:44:34.770 --> 04:44:36.890]  Those plants, one of them was really greasy
[04:44:36.890 --> 04:44:39.610]  and it was almost puddles at seven degrees.
[04:44:39.610 --> 04:44:41.010]  So I was like, okay, well, I know that
[04:44:41.010 --> 04:44:42.890]  I'm not gonna be able to work with this one
[04:44:42.890 --> 04:44:46.010]  very easily in the hash form unless it's really cold.
[04:44:46.010 --> 04:44:47.410]  So just plan on it.
[04:44:47.410 --> 04:44:50.010]  Plan on everything being as cold as possible.
[04:44:50.010 --> 04:44:53.050]  Put two or three extra trays in your freeze dryer if you can
[04:44:53.050 --> 04:44:55.450]  or take your freeze dryer trays and put them in the freezer.
[04:44:55.450 --> 04:44:57.490]  Take a cold plate, whatever it takes.
[04:44:57.490 --> 04:45:01.050]  And I swap those whenever it's really cold and greasy,
[04:45:01.050 --> 04:45:02.770]  I'll take the plate out with the hash
[04:45:02.770 --> 04:45:05.690]  and I'll move that whole thing of hash onto another plate.
[04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:07.850]  I'll take that plate and put it back in the freezer.
[04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:08.690]  Why?
[04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:10.810]  Because I'm gonna wish that I had a cold plate.
[04:45:10.810 --> 04:45:11.650]  And so then I'll take it,
[04:45:11.650 --> 04:45:14.170]  I'll just swap those trays in and out, back and forth.
[04:45:14.170 --> 04:45:17.090]  And that gives me something cold to be able to work on
[04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:18.450]  with greasy strains.
[04:45:18.450 --> 04:45:20.130]  Greasy strains are just that.
[04:45:20.130 --> 04:45:21.570]  What I've learned with greasy strains,
[04:45:21.570 --> 04:45:23.530]  and shout out to Pedro's grow room,
[04:45:23.530 --> 04:45:28.130]  a three to four to five day hang dry on that material
[04:45:28.130 --> 04:45:32.650]  doesn't, I've never known it to change the turps
[04:45:32.650 --> 04:45:34.690]  drastically enough to even taste it.
[04:45:35.530 --> 04:45:37.050]  And to give you a little bit of reference for me
[04:45:37.090 --> 04:45:39.250]  as flavor for 10 years,
[04:45:39.250 --> 04:45:41.650]  I worked in the coffee industry as a coffee roaster.
[04:45:41.650 --> 04:45:42.890]  I own the business.
[04:45:42.890 --> 04:45:44.170]  I had to be able to taste it.
[04:45:44.170 --> 04:45:47.050]  A farmer made a mistake on his farm in January
[04:45:47.050 --> 04:45:48.330]  when it was harvested,
[04:45:48.330 --> 04:45:51.110]  whenever I tasted it from a roaster in June.
[04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:53.690]  So when I say that I'm not tasting a big difference,
[04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:55.690]  I'm not tasting any difference at all
[04:45:55.690 --> 04:45:58.610]  between a plant that's hung dry in proper conditions.
[04:45:58.610 --> 04:46:01.050]  Hear me, proper conditions.
[04:46:01.050 --> 04:46:03.810]  I like a 60, 60 hang dry,
[04:46:03.810 --> 04:46:05.450]  proper conditions for three to five days
[04:46:05.490 --> 04:46:08.130]  and then buff that down and throw it in the freezer.
[04:46:08.130 --> 04:46:09.950]  Greasy strains are way easier to deal with.
[04:46:09.950 --> 04:46:11.670]  I'm not saying it can be dealt with,
[04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:14.210]  but I have had success, especially this year.
[04:46:14.210 --> 04:46:16.970]  Sunshine bowl number one, hazy lime turps.
[04:46:18.050 --> 04:46:19.570]  It was all grease.
[04:46:19.570 --> 04:46:21.130]  Day three hanging, all grease.
[04:46:21.130 --> 04:46:23.210]  Day four, hard as a rock.
[04:46:23.210 --> 04:46:26.330]  And I've taken that, frozen it, washed it.
[04:46:27.710 --> 04:46:31.930]  My returns are about 2.9% and that's start to finish,
[04:46:31.930 --> 04:46:33.490]  my returns, but it's way better
[04:46:33.490 --> 04:46:35.650]  than what I would have gotten any other way.
[04:46:35.650 --> 04:46:37.130]  What I would have gotten was just bags
[04:46:37.130 --> 04:46:38.970]  that were just all greased up.
[04:46:38.970 --> 04:46:40.250]  Really greasy strains,
[04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:43.170]  there's a lot of them that you just can't hash.
[04:46:43.170 --> 04:46:46.010]  Epi-de-pew is a strain that won't hash.
[04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:49.250]  It's incredible flower, incredible flower, rather,
[04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:50.530]  but it won't hash.
[04:46:50.530 --> 04:46:54.690]  So I'm working on the genetics to make that strain hash.
[04:46:54.690 --> 04:46:57.050]  I want those turps and I want them in a jar
[04:46:57.050 --> 04:46:59.610]  and I want it now, but I can't.
[04:46:59.610 --> 04:47:03.330]  So I've got to breed to be able to help that along.
[04:47:04.170 --> 04:47:05.530]  So I hope that answers your question about greasy strains.
[04:47:05.530 --> 04:47:07.490]  Don't give it a three to five day hang,
[04:47:07.490 --> 04:47:09.610]  or hang it for seven to 10 days,
[04:47:09.610 --> 04:47:12.370]  full on dry it out and then freeze it and then wash it.
[04:47:14.010 --> 04:47:16.610]  You may lose like half a percent turps,
[04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:18.250]  but you didn't lose the whole crop.
[04:47:18.250 --> 04:47:19.690]  So for me, that's a win.
[04:47:22.050 --> 04:47:24.490]  And Cheddar Bob bringing the questions today
[04:47:24.490 --> 04:47:26.570]  is bringing the heat with the questions.
[04:47:28.090 --> 04:47:29.810]  Ooh, what's the best bull?
[04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:33.650]  My best bull from flower rosin is around 25%.
[04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:35.810]  I've never had anything up to 33.
[04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:38.130]  Something with flower rosin, if you're a processor
[04:47:38.130 --> 04:47:40.250]  and you're doing VHO and you want to see
[04:47:40.250 --> 04:47:42.930]  how your plants are going to actually kick out,
[04:47:42.930 --> 04:47:45.530]  what I've noticed is running,
[04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:46.850]  able to run closed loop systems
[04:47:46.850 --> 04:47:48.930]  and having access to that myself,
[04:47:48.930 --> 04:47:52.170]  is if I squish something and it squishes, say 20, 25%,
[04:47:52.170 --> 04:47:54.530]  I'm probably going to get about that same return
[04:47:54.530 --> 04:47:56.370]  in the VHO equipment.
[04:47:56.370 --> 04:47:58.370]  It is a good way to test samples in VHO
[04:47:58.370 --> 04:48:00.610]  instead of having to put four or five pounds in a column
[04:48:00.610 --> 04:48:02.570]  and run it through a closed loop system.
[04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:05.570]  You can just squish a little bit of it and say,
[04:48:05.570 --> 04:48:07.690]  oh, in your case, 33%.
[04:48:07.690 --> 04:48:11.210]  So I would expect at least 20 to 25% of it.
[04:48:11.210 --> 04:48:13.930]  In fact, I'll probably get more like 35%
[04:48:13.930 --> 04:48:17.090]  because the flower rosin press won't be as effective
[04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:19.370]  in my opinion at pushing the oil out
[04:48:19.370 --> 04:48:21.370]  as butane stripping it off.
[04:48:22.250 --> 04:48:24.010]  So I hope that answered your question.
[04:48:24.010 --> 04:48:26.250]  25 is about what I've gotten.
[04:48:26.250 --> 04:48:27.810]  33, that's pretty impressive.
[04:48:28.250 --> 04:48:30.210]  I'd be squishing that all day long.
[04:48:30.210 --> 04:48:32.530]  All right, well, Cheddar Bob's not done with you yet.
[04:48:32.530 --> 04:48:36.170]  And just while you answer this one, I got to run inside
[04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:38.770]  and evidently I'm the only one that my three-year-old
[04:48:38.770 --> 04:48:40.730]  takes seriously when I say it's nap time.
[04:48:40.730 --> 04:48:43.770]  So I got to go tell her that she seriously
[04:48:43.770 --> 04:48:44.850]  has to take a nap.
[04:48:44.850 --> 04:48:47.730]  So you can answer that one.
[04:48:51.810 --> 04:48:53.690]  Oh, hand washer or machine?
[04:48:53.690 --> 04:48:55.050]  I've done both.
[04:48:55.090 --> 04:48:58.810]  I've worked with machines.
[04:48:58.810 --> 04:49:02.010]  I got to see the Osprey, which is made by Lotemplates,
[04:49:02.010 --> 04:49:03.370]  which does an incredible job,
[04:49:03.370 --> 04:49:04.570]  especially for the price point.
[04:49:04.570 --> 04:49:05.970]  It's an incredible machine.
[04:49:05.970 --> 04:49:07.610]  I've seen that machine pull off some stuff
[04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:10.690]  and do really, really well compared to a hand washer.
[04:49:10.690 --> 04:49:14.210]  I think that hand washing isn't necessarily superior,
[04:49:14.210 --> 04:49:15.770]  but it's just another method.
[04:49:15.770 --> 04:49:18.610]  I think that whenever you start dealing with greasy strains,
[04:49:18.610 --> 04:49:19.770]  you're gonna like the hand wash
[04:49:19.770 --> 04:49:22.650]  because you're going to keep it more,
[04:49:22.650 --> 04:49:25.090]  keep it subtle, keep it gentle,
[04:49:25.090 --> 04:49:26.890]  not sit there and get the piss out of it.
[04:49:26.890 --> 04:49:29.010]  Because with the machine, you've got one option.
[04:49:29.010 --> 04:49:30.490]  With the Lotemplates Osprey plates,
[04:49:30.490 --> 04:49:33.250]  and I think some of the other machines that are out there
[04:49:33.250 --> 04:49:35.370]  that do 20, 30 gallons at a time,
[04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:38.610]  you can adjust those to some degree,
[04:49:38.610 --> 04:49:42.010]  but you're still dealing with that current and that vortex,
[04:49:42.010 --> 04:49:44.810]  which you can do with a paddle as well.
[04:49:44.810 --> 04:49:46.730]  So I've used the five-gallon machines.
[04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:48.930]  I've used the 20-gallon machines,
[04:49:48.930 --> 04:49:50.930]  and those I've actually abused use,
[04:49:50.930 --> 04:49:52.490]  and then I've had access
[04:49:52.490 --> 04:49:54.930]  and been able to be around the Osprey.
[04:49:54.930 --> 04:49:56.690]  Machines are good, they have their place.
[04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:59.650]  You're gonna lose a percentage for the convenience,
[04:50:00.690 --> 04:50:02.170]  I think, in that,
[04:50:02.170 --> 04:50:04.490]  and you can really bust up a greasy strain.
[04:50:04.490 --> 04:50:06.370]  So tomato, tomato on it.
[04:50:09.210 --> 04:50:10.850]  I have one last one, I guess.
[04:50:10.850 --> 04:50:13.250]  Are there certain breeders that you feel like
[04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:14.930]  you don't mind giving a shout out to
[04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:16.910]  where it seems like those are the genetics
[04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:21.090]  that you should pheno hunt with for this specifically?
[04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:26.510]  Yeah, let me, so I wanted to do some shout outs,
[04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:27.510]  and I made sure and wrote them down,
[04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:29.350]  and this is one of those breeders
[04:50:30.270 --> 04:50:33.530]  that I feel like are doing some solid stuff.
[04:50:48.280 --> 04:50:51.000]  Okay, so one of those is definitely Shaggy Roots.
[04:50:51.000 --> 04:50:53.240]  Shaggy Roots is doing the Sunshine Gold,
[04:50:53.240 --> 04:50:55.280]  and from what I've seen from that strain,
[04:50:55.280 --> 04:50:58.320]  it's not across the board every single pheno's a washer,
[04:50:58.640 --> 04:51:00.640]  but there are some really good washers in there.
[04:51:00.640 --> 04:51:02.680]  Sunshine Gold's got that Go-GOG
[04:51:02.680 --> 04:51:04.400]  and that Banana Pudentane in it,
[04:51:04.400 --> 04:51:05.680]  and one of the phenos that I had this year
[04:51:05.680 --> 04:51:08.640]  was total that Banana Pudentane style from Swamp Boys.
[04:51:08.640 --> 04:51:11.040]  Big, I mean big and vigorous,
[04:51:11.040 --> 04:51:12.840]  three times as vigorous as all the other plants.
[04:51:12.840 --> 04:51:14.680]  It just really showed those genetics,
[04:51:14.680 --> 04:51:16.360]  and it really did well here.
[04:51:16.360 --> 04:51:17.640]  So I really respect Shaggy
[04:51:17.640 --> 04:51:18.760]  and what he's doing here in the state,
[04:51:18.760 --> 04:51:20.840]  because he's always thinking about stuff,
[04:51:20.840 --> 04:51:22.080]  and I'm always sharing data,
[04:51:22.080 --> 04:51:24.840]  and if you're a farmer, share your data with your breeders.
[04:51:24.840 --> 04:51:26.400]  I can't express it enough,
[04:51:26.400 --> 04:51:27.800]  because if I'm sharing it with my breeders,
[04:51:28.320 --> 04:51:29.160]  I've got plants out there now,
[04:51:29.160 --> 04:51:30.720]  it's what, middle of November.
[04:51:30.720 --> 04:51:33.160]  I've cut most of these plants down to about nothing
[04:51:33.160 --> 04:51:34.720]  to see how they would respond.
[04:51:34.720 --> 04:51:36.840]  What kills them at the end of the year?
[04:51:36.840 --> 04:51:38.120]  Is it the mold that kills them?
[04:51:38.120 --> 04:51:39.560]  Is it the frost that kills them?
[04:51:39.560 --> 04:51:41.080]  Is it the harvest that kills them?
[04:51:41.080 --> 04:51:42.960]  I had a Scotoli this year, I clipped it all down,
[04:51:42.960 --> 04:51:45.200]  I left the lowers, it was dead two days later.
[04:51:45.200 --> 04:51:46.920]  The harvest killed it, the stretch just whacked it,
[04:51:46.920 --> 04:51:48.440]  that was it, it was done.
[04:51:48.440 --> 04:51:49.480]  There's something to be learned there.
[04:51:49.480 --> 04:51:51.760]  I don't know a positive or negative to that,
[04:51:51.760 --> 04:51:53.440]  I just know that it's a test.
[04:51:53.440 --> 04:51:54.840]  With the Sunshine Gold, same thing,
[04:51:54.840 --> 04:51:56.360]  sharing with Shaggy and just saying,
[04:51:56.360 --> 04:51:58.360]  I really like how this pheno number one opens up,
[04:51:58.360 --> 04:52:00.200]  whenever I cut up, or I buck,
[04:52:00.200 --> 04:52:02.720]  it allows water to pass in and out of those nubs,
[04:52:02.720 --> 04:52:04.280]  as opposed to some of the other pheno
[04:52:04.280 --> 04:52:06.640]  where everything's so tight, there's no water getting in.
[04:52:06.640 --> 04:52:08.000]  And he's like, when I breed,
[04:52:08.000 --> 04:52:10.180]  I think about that kind of stuff.
[04:52:10.180 --> 04:52:12.360]  Someone like him is thinking about,
[04:52:12.360 --> 04:52:14.160]  whenever the ants move up the plant,
[04:52:14.160 --> 04:52:16.560]  or something, I saw this year in my own breed.
[04:52:16.560 --> 04:52:18.280]  I had two phenos with Pepe the Pew.
[04:52:18.280 --> 04:52:20.320]  One was really open and stretchy,
[04:52:20.320 --> 04:52:22.400]  it was just this big, it almost looked like hemp,
[04:52:22.400 --> 04:52:23.900]  it was just a big monster,
[04:52:23.900 --> 04:52:26.540]  but it just made these long spears.
[04:52:26.540 --> 04:52:28.460]  They were more open, and it allowed ants
[04:52:28.460 --> 04:52:31.140]  to pass up and down really, really, really easily,
[04:52:31.140 --> 04:52:33.940]  too easily, and so I always fought aphids on that plant,
[04:52:33.940 --> 04:52:35.940]  and I ended up just fermenting that plant.
[04:52:35.940 --> 04:52:40.260]  The other pheno was tighter, still had ant pressure,
[04:52:40.260 --> 04:52:42.940]  but the ants couldn't move up and down it as easy.
[04:52:42.940 --> 04:52:44.140]  So whenever a breeder's telling me
[04:52:44.140 --> 04:52:45.940]  that he's taking that into consideration,
[04:52:45.940 --> 04:52:48.540]  and knowing that ant pressure can be reduced
[04:52:48.540 --> 04:52:51.860]  by some density, but not too much,
[04:52:51.860 --> 04:52:52.780]  because if you have too much,
[04:52:52.780 --> 04:52:54.740]  the trichome heads start pushing together,
[04:52:54.740 --> 04:52:57.500]  and then you're not able to wash them out.
[04:52:57.500 --> 04:52:59.020]  Incredible, I can't say enough about him.
[04:52:59.020 --> 04:53:01.100]  Pack-a-Punch, he's a breeder here in the state,
[04:53:01.100 --> 04:53:02.460]  that bred the Morning Witch strain,
[04:53:02.460 --> 04:53:04.860]  that does incredible, if you're in Oklahoma,
[04:53:04.860 --> 04:53:07.940]  and you can hold on to that cut, get that cut.
[04:53:07.940 --> 04:53:10.060]  It's a sour diesel from Colorado,
[04:53:10.060 --> 04:53:12.620]  the Crossroads, and Alaska Thunder Climber.
[04:53:12.620 --> 04:53:14.700]  Some other breeders that I would,
[04:53:14.700 --> 04:53:16.420]  definitely Divine Collection.
[04:53:16.420 --> 04:53:18.420]  Divine Collection is a hash maker here in the state
[04:53:18.420 --> 04:53:20.300]  that does single source solventless,
[04:53:20.300 --> 04:53:21.700]  and they've got some incredible lines,
[04:53:21.700 --> 04:53:23.380]  and so they just share some genetics with me.
[04:53:23.380 --> 04:53:25.140]  They're not necessarily breeders,
[04:53:25.140 --> 04:53:27.260]  but they just share some genetics with me.
[04:53:28.540 --> 04:53:30.180]  Let's see here, Masonic's always one
[04:53:30.180 --> 04:53:32.420]  that a lot of people lean towards
[04:53:32.420 --> 04:53:34.900]  whenever they go down the hash route.
[04:53:34.900 --> 04:53:37.820]  And whenever someone, and this is no knock on him,
[04:53:37.820 --> 04:53:39.540]  whenever someone gets popular enough
[04:53:39.540 --> 04:53:41.740]  that everyone's using him, I'm out.
[04:53:42.740 --> 04:53:44.780]  And it's not because their stuff's not quality,
[04:53:44.780 --> 04:53:46.740]  or that it's bad or good,
[04:53:46.740 --> 04:53:50.500]  it's just whenever everyone catches that wave, I'm out.
[04:53:51.740 --> 04:53:53.740]  And that's what's happened with that Masonic,
[04:53:53.740 --> 04:53:56.740]  is so many people have so many strains by him,
[04:53:56.740 --> 04:54:01.180]  there's not much diversity in the hash world.
[04:54:01.180 --> 04:54:03.820]  And there's so few strains that actually hash diesel.
[04:54:05.180 --> 04:54:07.780]  There's not, Turp Wizard, he's got some coming out.
[04:54:07.780 --> 04:54:09.220]  He's out of Michigan.
[04:54:09.220 --> 04:54:12.620]  When I helped hold the low temp plate class
[04:54:12.620 --> 04:54:14.260]  that was here in 2019,
[04:54:15.740 --> 04:54:18.220]  we had eight people in a class of almost 40
[04:54:18.220 --> 04:54:20.380]  learning solventless hash processing.
[04:54:20.380 --> 04:54:21.820]  We had eight people from Oklahoma,
[04:54:21.820 --> 04:54:23.820]  the rest were from out of state.
[04:54:23.820 --> 04:54:25.500]  And I'm telling you, the Michigan boys,
[04:54:25.500 --> 04:54:27.340]  I have respect to Michigan boys.
[04:54:27.340 --> 04:54:29.340]  Some of the best hash on the tables
[04:54:29.340 --> 04:54:30.780]  was coming out of Michigan.
[04:54:30.780 --> 04:54:33.260]  Whenever we had another low temp class,
[04:54:33.260 --> 04:54:36.340]  I think last fall, we had some Michigan boys,
[04:54:36.340 --> 04:54:39.500]  different Michigan boys, y'all are packing heat.
[04:54:39.500 --> 04:54:42.780]  Those Michigan boys and their hash rods is no joke.
[04:54:43.660 --> 04:54:47.220]  Oklahoma's got the most hash producers in the entire country
[04:54:47.220 --> 04:54:48.740]  and I wouldn't be surprised
[04:54:48.780 --> 04:54:50.660]  if we don't have some incredible talent that's here
[04:54:50.660 --> 04:54:54.060]  that really raises the bar in the country.
[04:54:54.060 --> 04:54:55.740]  I think we already have that here.
[04:54:57.300 --> 04:54:58.260]  But those Michigan boys.
[04:54:58.260 --> 04:55:01.380]  So Turp Wizard, I know Humphrey Hash is doing some stuff.
[04:55:02.940 --> 04:55:04.940]  Humphrey Hash is the one who shared that.
[04:55:07.580 --> 04:55:10.460]  And then me and some friends,
[04:55:10.460 --> 04:55:11.820]  I don't wanna suggest this to everyone,
[04:55:11.820 --> 04:55:14.580]  you guys share cuts, share genetics,
[04:55:14.580 --> 04:55:17.420]  share males, share pollen, whatever it is,
[04:55:17.420 --> 04:55:19.820]  because your specific, our region right here
[04:55:19.820 --> 04:55:24.820]  is a threat of being overrun by commercial ag
[04:55:25.180 --> 04:55:26.820]  in the next 10 to 15 years.
[04:55:26.820 --> 04:55:29.340]  And we really need strains that do well for us.
[04:55:29.340 --> 04:55:30.980]  And so learning what strains do well.
[04:55:30.980 --> 04:55:33.100]  The purple hercules, yeah, right, not here.
[04:55:33.100 --> 04:55:34.900]  Maybe indoor, but not outside.
[04:55:34.900 --> 04:55:36.940]  Anything purple hercule, anything cheese,
[04:55:36.940 --> 04:55:38.260]  it just falls apart out here.
[04:55:38.260 --> 04:55:39.740]  It can't take any kind of heat.
[04:55:39.740 --> 04:55:41.140]  Chems don't like it either,
[04:55:41.140 --> 04:55:42.980]  but chems cross do really well.
[04:55:42.980 --> 04:55:44.580]  These are all things we're gonna learn in the state.
[04:55:44.580 --> 04:55:46.580]  So there's some of your local farmers,
[04:55:46.700 --> 04:55:47.940]  if you know who you are here in the state,
[04:55:47.940 --> 04:55:49.020]  they're working with me.
[04:55:49.020 --> 04:55:51.300]  We're gonna be trading pollen, trading cuts
[04:55:51.300 --> 04:55:52.580]  to be able to create some genetics
[04:55:52.580 --> 04:55:54.380]  that work here for the farmers here.
[04:55:58.660 --> 04:56:00.140]  Oh gosh, Sunleaf Seed.
[04:56:00.980 --> 04:56:02.820]  If you want land-raised stuff,
[04:56:02.820 --> 04:56:05.580]  and you wanna start working with some breeder,
[04:56:05.580 --> 04:56:08.940]  I've got some Baca Lebanon packs from him
[04:56:08.940 --> 04:56:10.700]  that I wanna hunt through for Hash.
[04:56:10.700 --> 04:56:11.980]  If you wanna be different in Hash,
[04:56:11.980 --> 04:56:14.700]  don't go try to catch Masonic on his next drop.
[04:56:14.700 --> 04:56:16.380]  Go breed your own.
[04:56:17.180 --> 04:56:18.020]  Go get some of these lines,
[04:56:18.020 --> 04:56:18.860]  some of these land-raised lines
[04:56:18.860 --> 04:56:19.700]  that people have worked through
[04:56:19.700 --> 04:56:22.260]  that probably hold some Hashers in them,
[04:56:22.260 --> 04:56:24.100]  and work through those and create your own.
[04:56:24.100 --> 04:56:26.740]  Because everyone thinks, man,
[04:56:26.740 --> 04:56:29.780]  that their cut's gonna be the cut that changes the game.
[04:56:29.780 --> 04:56:31.060]  And really, it's just a matter of time
[04:56:31.060 --> 04:56:33.340]  until that cut leaves with some employee,
[04:56:33.340 --> 04:56:35.300]  and now five-year competitors have it.
[04:56:37.820 --> 04:56:40.220]  Anyway, that's a tangent on the breeders,
[04:56:40.220 --> 04:56:41.980]  but CSI Humboldt I really like,
[04:56:41.980 --> 04:56:44.100]  Humboldt Seed Company I really like.
[04:56:44.100 --> 04:56:45.660]  Both of them, they just do really good work
[04:56:45.700 --> 04:56:46.900]  with all their phenos.
[04:56:46.900 --> 04:56:50.260]  I know Humboldt Seed's got a lot of bubble Hash.
[04:56:50.260 --> 04:56:52.900]  He's got a lot of their strains in the neck.
[04:56:52.900 --> 04:56:54.820]  That kind of lets me look at it and go,
[04:56:54.820 --> 04:56:56.620]  wow, he's got three or four or five
[04:56:56.620 --> 04:56:57.780]  that are just doing really well
[04:56:57.780 --> 04:56:59.780]  from Humboldt Seed as far as Hash.
[04:56:59.780 --> 04:57:01.440]  One of those is Stupid Fruits.
[04:57:01.440 --> 04:57:03.620]  I think there's a place to find some blueberry muffins
[04:57:03.620 --> 04:57:05.140]  that Hash really well.
[04:57:05.140 --> 04:57:07.720]  Brian, you tried some of that blueberry muffin,
[04:57:07.720 --> 04:57:09.380]  some of that VHO that I had
[04:57:09.380 --> 04:57:11.140]  when it was first legalized back.
[04:57:11.140 --> 04:57:12.460]  It was so good, man.
[04:57:12.460 --> 04:57:14.060]  It tasted like blueberry muffin.
[04:57:15.060 --> 04:57:18.380]  Yeah, we got to interview his daughter on that as well
[04:57:18.380 --> 04:57:19.460]  with some of that.
[04:57:19.460 --> 04:57:21.540]  Just the nostalgia from Humboldt Seed
[04:57:21.540 --> 04:57:23.940]  smoking the blueberry muffins is kind of cool
[04:57:23.940 --> 04:57:26.300]  in just that aspect alone.
[04:57:28.180 --> 04:57:29.420]  So I wanna give a few shout outs
[04:57:29.420 --> 04:57:31.940]  to a couple of growers here in the States
[04:57:31.940 --> 04:57:35.560]  and processors just so I have this.
[04:57:35.560 --> 04:57:37.060]  People that I feel like are really doing it right
[04:57:37.060 --> 04:57:38.580]  or had conversations with them.
[04:57:38.580 --> 04:57:40.040]  And they may not be like perfect now,
[04:57:40.040 --> 04:57:42.820]  but they're working in a direction of regenerative
[04:57:42.860 --> 04:57:45.460]  or in a direction of patients first and everything.
[04:57:45.460 --> 04:57:47.860]  That's Full Sun Farm here in the state.
[04:57:47.860 --> 04:57:50.100]  Wild West Organics.
[04:57:50.100 --> 04:57:51.740]  Blissful Farms.
[04:57:51.740 --> 04:57:54.100]  Uncle Mike at Blissful, I call him Uncle Mike.
[04:57:55.180 --> 04:57:57.620]  Patients Over Profit, and that dude's straight up about it.
[04:57:57.620 --> 04:58:00.060]  Oklahoma Kush Collective.
[04:58:00.060 --> 04:58:01.740]  That's my boy, man.
[04:58:01.740 --> 04:58:03.180]  Anyway, wild natives.
[04:58:03.180 --> 04:58:04.260]  Wild natives here in the state.
[04:58:04.260 --> 04:58:06.420]  I don't know you, I've had conversation with you,
[04:58:06.420 --> 04:58:08.300]  but you're using words like terroir
[04:58:08.300 --> 04:58:09.540]  and Rock Creek Project.
[04:58:09.540 --> 04:58:11.580]  Rock Creek's one of the creeks
[04:58:11.580 --> 04:58:14.140]  for the Arkansas River.
[04:58:14.140 --> 04:58:17.860]  That's very forward thinking with a lot of their stuff.
[04:58:17.860 --> 04:58:21.540]  Red Dirt Rays, they were at the Hustle and Educate.
[04:58:21.540 --> 04:58:23.700]  Really good guys, really good folks.
[04:58:23.700 --> 04:58:28.420]  And then Straight Fire is the grow facility
[04:58:28.420 --> 04:58:31.420]  that Shaggy Roots works for.
[04:58:31.420 --> 04:58:32.660]  So I wanted to give them a shout out to you.
[04:58:32.660 --> 04:58:35.620]  They're doing all living soil indoors as well.
[04:58:35.620 --> 04:58:38.140]  Oklahoma processors that I really feel like
[04:58:38.140 --> 04:58:39.420]  just knock it out of the park.
[04:58:39.420 --> 04:58:40.820]  Cicada Labs.
[04:58:40.860 --> 04:58:41.900]  He's been around for a while
[04:58:41.900 --> 04:58:43.940]  and he knows what the hell he's doing.
[04:58:43.940 --> 04:58:46.460]  If you get live heads, get them from Cicada.
[04:58:46.460 --> 04:58:48.100]  You're gonna really like their live heads.
[04:58:48.100 --> 04:58:49.660]  Michael at Gravity Grown.
[04:58:49.660 --> 04:58:50.540]  What's up, Michael?
[04:58:50.540 --> 04:58:54.420]  We have a, ah, yeah, I just love him so much.
[04:58:54.420 --> 04:58:56.900]  He's up and coming Gravity Grown if you're in the state
[04:58:56.900 --> 04:58:57.980]  and you've heard Gravity Grown
[04:58:57.980 --> 04:58:59.220]  and you've looked at some of their stuff.
[04:58:59.220 --> 04:59:00.660]  He's doing mechanical separation
[04:59:00.660 --> 04:59:03.780]  with white clear THC isolate.
[04:59:03.780 --> 04:59:05.140]  It's incredible.
[04:59:05.140 --> 04:59:07.220]  Hilltop, you're doing it right.
[04:59:07.220 --> 04:59:09.020]  Lost Roots, doing it right.
[04:59:09.060 --> 04:59:10.780]  If you were at the Hustle and Educate,
[04:59:10.780 --> 04:59:12.660]  can't speak enough highly about him.
[04:59:12.660 --> 04:59:14.220]  Divine Collection, doing it right.
[04:59:14.220 --> 04:59:16.340]  They're doing single source here in the state.
[04:59:16.340 --> 04:59:17.940]  Gunner over at Wooly Mammoth.
[04:59:17.940 --> 04:59:19.180]  You're just getting in the game
[04:59:19.180 --> 04:59:22.820]  as far as what I, like in the last year, year and a half.
[04:59:22.820 --> 04:59:24.260]  Be on the lookout for him.
[04:59:24.260 --> 04:59:26.340]  Rare Extracts, they come out of Colorado.
[04:59:26.340 --> 04:59:28.580]  Whenever they drop solvents here in the state,
[04:59:28.580 --> 04:59:30.300]  it is freaking quality.
[04:59:30.300 --> 04:59:33.100]  They're really BHO focused on a lot of their stuff
[04:59:33.100 --> 04:59:34.580]  but they can pull over to solvents
[04:59:34.580 --> 04:59:35.900]  and I have mad respect for anyone
[04:59:35.900 --> 04:59:37.980]  that can move from solvent to solvents
[04:59:37.980 --> 04:59:40.260]  and still pump out just incredible quality.
[04:59:41.140 --> 04:59:43.180]  All of them would say our farmers
[04:59:43.180 --> 04:59:44.580]  are the ones who help produce it
[04:59:44.580 --> 04:59:46.500]  or we're single source.
[04:59:46.500 --> 04:59:49.300]  Up and coming, washers.
[04:59:49.300 --> 04:59:51.020]  Washers here in the state.
[04:59:51.020 --> 04:59:52.980]  So if you're waiting for what's coming on the shelf,
[04:59:52.980 --> 04:59:55.340]  washers, just pay attention to them.
[04:59:55.340 --> 04:59:56.700]  They're gonna be single source.
[04:59:56.700 --> 04:59:58.500]  They're gonna be running some of the sunshine bowl cuts
[04:59:58.500 --> 05:00:00.340]  that I handed out at the beginning of the year.
[05:00:00.340 --> 05:00:02.900]  So that's kind of all my shout outs.
[05:00:03.740 --> 05:00:06.620]  Mad respect to Ken Wall, Low Temp Plates,
[05:00:06.620 --> 05:00:10.100]  Pedro's Grow Room and Humphreys for the plate temp.
[05:00:10.100 --> 05:00:11.340]  And there's a lot of other tech,
[05:00:11.340 --> 05:00:13.300]  Indica Home is another one.
[05:00:13.300 --> 05:00:16.100]  Thank you for always being the charge on flour rousing
[05:00:16.100 --> 05:00:19.420]  and continually like, it's just fire.
[05:00:19.420 --> 05:00:20.260]  Like you see it on the internet,
[05:00:20.260 --> 05:00:22.980]  you're like, is that really flour rousing?
[05:00:22.980 --> 05:00:24.740]  It's like, yeah, it is.
[05:00:24.740 --> 05:00:26.180]  Doing it right.
[05:00:26.180 --> 05:00:28.260]  And I think patience, spend a couple grand
[05:00:28.260 --> 05:00:29.500]  instead of spending it on glass,
[05:00:29.500 --> 05:00:31.820]  spend a couple grand and spend it on a freeze dryer,
[05:00:31.820 --> 05:00:34.540]  a press, some parchment, some bags
[05:00:34.580 --> 05:00:36.740]  and you'll never be dissatisfied
[05:00:39.020 --> 05:00:40.460]  with spending the money on that.
[05:00:40.460 --> 05:00:41.980]  So I think that's it.
[05:00:41.980 --> 05:00:43.580]  If you have any other questions,
[05:00:45.020 --> 05:00:47.420]  looking through my notes here, just making sure.
[05:00:52.540 --> 05:00:53.900]  Top of my notes right here,
[05:00:53.900 --> 05:00:55.500]  I just wanna say thank you again
[05:00:55.500 --> 05:00:57.460]  to all the vets today at Veterans Day.
[05:00:58.500 --> 05:01:02.100]  If you're not growing and sharing with the vets,
[05:01:02.100 --> 05:01:03.540]  whatever that looks like,
[05:01:04.700 --> 05:01:07.380]  if that's just them coming out to your farm for a day
[05:01:07.380 --> 05:01:10.500]  and just unplugging, that's fine.
[05:01:10.500 --> 05:01:13.180]  If it's medicine, it's even better.
[05:01:13.180 --> 05:01:17.100]  These people have went through hell and high water for us
[05:01:17.100 --> 05:01:19.620]  and we just owe them the respect
[05:01:19.620 --> 05:01:24.620]  and just the respect that here, we're gonna help you.
[05:01:25.740 --> 05:01:27.980]  We wouldn't have the shit.
[05:01:27.980 --> 05:01:29.700]  I woke up and I watched the sunrise this morning
[05:01:29.700 --> 05:01:32.460]  because someone somewhere else is watching the sunrise
[05:01:32.460 --> 05:01:34.260]  with a gun in their hand.
[05:01:34.260 --> 05:01:35.540]  We don't talk about that a whole bunch,
[05:01:35.540 --> 05:01:37.860]  but I know with the cannabis industry,
[05:01:39.500 --> 05:01:41.460]  who are we taking care of?
[05:01:41.460 --> 05:01:43.100]  We're taking care of cancer patients,
[05:01:43.100 --> 05:01:44.500]  we're taking care of vets,
[05:01:44.500 --> 05:01:45.420]  we're taking care of people
[05:01:45.420 --> 05:01:48.480]  that have had just terrible lives or whatever.
[05:01:50.340 --> 05:01:52.220]  We're giving them life.
[05:01:52.220 --> 05:01:54.100]  So take this seriously.
[05:01:54.100 --> 05:01:56.780]  This is that and you can get people relief
[05:01:56.780 --> 05:01:57.900]  and you get people sleep.
[05:01:57.900 --> 05:01:59.020]  If you've ever been without sleep,
[05:01:59.020 --> 05:02:01.940]  you don't know how bad you really need sleep
[05:02:01.940 --> 05:02:02.780]  that you actually get.
[05:02:02.780 --> 05:02:05.980]  So I run along here, y'all.
[05:02:08.620 --> 05:02:11.060]  Yeah, this was a mob deep of an interview,
[05:02:11.060 --> 05:02:12.540]  but we appreciate your time
[05:02:12.540 --> 05:02:16.100]  and I think this will be replayed over and over.
[05:02:16.100 --> 05:02:18.020]  Also for the beginning of this interview, man,
[05:02:18.020 --> 05:02:21.260]  where we're kind of really diving deep into some of the,
[05:02:21.260 --> 05:02:23.980]  I feel like the upper echelons of what it takes
[05:02:23.980 --> 05:02:27.620]  to kind of take diversity cannabis farming
[05:02:27.660 --> 05:02:29.700]  to the next level again by using livestock.
[05:02:29.700 --> 05:02:30.780]  So appreciate that, man.
[05:02:30.780 --> 05:02:32.380]  I know I'm gonna watch it again.
[05:02:33.300 --> 05:02:35.140]  Of course, appreciate it.
[05:02:35.140 --> 05:02:36.820]  And thank you to everyone who just,
[05:02:36.820 --> 05:02:39.540]  you took the time out of your day to watch this,
[05:02:39.540 --> 05:02:41.260]  whether this is now or later.
[05:02:41.260 --> 05:02:42.100]  I wanna thank you for that.
[05:02:42.100 --> 05:02:44.700]  I respect your time and I really appreciate you
[05:02:44.700 --> 05:02:46.940]  believing in this and believing in the knowledge
[05:02:46.940 --> 05:02:49.940]  and taking it and making some bones out of it
[05:02:49.940 --> 05:02:51.820]  and creating some things.
[05:02:51.820 --> 05:02:53.020]  Getting some of this stuff.
[05:02:53.020 --> 05:02:54.360]  Thank you, Mike.
[05:02:55.200 --> 05:02:57.280]  All right, so as our outro,
[05:02:58.960 --> 05:03:01.840]  if we get dinged for a musical copyright infringement,
[05:03:01.840 --> 05:03:05.200]  I tried to find a remix of this song.
[05:03:06.440 --> 05:03:10.760]  So, can you guys hear that?
[05:03:11.880 --> 05:03:12.720]  Yeah.
[05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:19.630]  This one's for you, Elka.
[05:03:23.870 --> 05:03:26.630]  This is a Skate Night music for me, the original.
[05:03:27.550 --> 05:03:28.390]  Yeah.
[05:03:35.080 --> 05:03:38.520]  All these awesome, Ash's awesome.
[05:03:38.520 --> 05:03:39.760]  I'm in the car with it.
[05:03:39.760 --> 05:03:44.760]  Gotta have fun with it, otherwise what's the point, right?
[05:03:51.010 --> 05:03:53.010]  Jen, thank you guys so much.
[05:03:57.210 --> 05:04:01.210]  I shake my little tush on the catwalk.
[05:04:01.210 --> 05:04:03.530]  I sing this with my daughters all the time.
[05:04:04.490 --> 05:04:05.330]  I bet you do.
[05:04:05.330 --> 05:04:07.890]  And now they're both like, I shake my little tush.
[05:04:11.050 --> 05:04:13.330]  All right, I don't think we need to listen
[05:04:13.330 --> 05:04:18.330]  to the whole song, but hold on, I can actually fade it out.
[05:04:23.410 --> 05:04:28.410]  All right, so as we wrap this one five hours in,
[05:04:29.050 --> 05:04:32.770]  I realize we got another one in three hours
[05:04:32.810 --> 05:04:37.810]  with Hota Erb, Doc Ray, talking communication networks
[05:04:40.010 --> 05:04:44.250]  and veterans and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[05:04:44.250 --> 05:04:47.690]  So that's gonna be on Clubhouse and on FCP2
[05:04:47.690 --> 05:04:51.650]  and Chad Westport says, holy shit, you guys.
[05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:58.170]  There is a Chad related thought in my head earlier
[05:04:58.170 --> 05:05:02.330]  and I'm totally forgetting what it was, but anywho.
[05:05:03.090 --> 05:05:04.210]  It'll come back to me.
[05:05:06.850 --> 05:05:11.130]  Thank you all and should we kill it?
[05:05:13.090 --> 05:05:15.610]  Thank you everyone for your time and for tuning in.
[05:05:15.610 --> 05:05:18.730]  This was super blast, just a lot of fun.
[05:05:20.410 --> 05:05:21.770]  We'll see you guys next week.
[05:05:21.770 --> 05:05:24.090]  You blew, Layton had to tap out,
[05:05:24.090 --> 05:05:26.130]  his cork was blown so much.
[05:05:27.570 --> 05:05:29.730]  He was like, no mas, tap out.
[05:05:30.730 --> 05:05:34.490]  I don't know if Layton's seen that before,
[05:05:34.490 --> 05:05:35.970]  the whole process, so that was probably
[05:05:35.970 --> 05:05:37.370]  pretty cool for him as well.
[05:05:40.210 --> 05:05:43.010]  All right, five hour marathon.
[05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:44.250]  All right, thanks everyone.
[05:05:44.250 --> 05:05:45.250]  Y'all have a great day.
