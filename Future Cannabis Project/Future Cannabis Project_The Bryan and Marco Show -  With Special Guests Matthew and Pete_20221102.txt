[00:00.000 --> 00:03.360]  Wednesday to you Living Soil nerds.
[00:03.360 --> 00:05.360]  Back again with another episode.
[00:05.360 --> 00:08.360]  Marco's gone out of his way to reach out to two individuals
[00:08.360 --> 00:10.360]  that are also entrepreneurs.
[00:10.360 --> 00:14.280]  So part of obviously weekly kind of engagement and talks,
[00:14.280 --> 00:16.400]  obviously we're gonna talk about cannabis.
[00:16.400 --> 00:19.120]  But part of that moving forward is that we need
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.640]  to be able to sell our cannabis.
[00:20.640 --> 00:22.000]  We need to sell our ideas.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.840]  We need to have marketing and branding dialed in.
[00:24.840 --> 00:27.820]  So I kind of wanted to give it to the audience this week.
[00:27.820 --> 00:30.280]  Behind the scenes, I've been nonstop running around.
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.380]  So what kind of phone calls did you guys make today?
[00:33.380 --> 00:37.220]  Are you finally pulling the trigger on that logo
[00:37.220 --> 00:38.060]  and that kind of stuff?
[00:38.060 --> 00:40.060]  Because I have a lot of individuals asking me,
[00:40.060 --> 00:44.300]  even the guy that made the logo for Marco and myself,
[00:44.300 --> 00:46.020]  reach out to talented individuals.
[00:46.020 --> 00:47.940]  I think that doing a quality logo
[00:47.940 --> 00:50.720]  is going to cost you a couple hundred bucks.
[00:50.720 --> 00:53.160]  Just realizing what you should put money into
[00:53.160 --> 00:55.020]  and what you shouldn't, I think when you're branding,
[00:55.020 --> 00:56.260]  when you're representing yourself
[00:56.620 --> 00:58.540]  is just on a whole nother level.
[00:58.540 --> 01:01.100]  So I'm excited to have two fellow entrepreneurs
[01:01.100 --> 01:02.420]  on the show today.
[01:02.420 --> 01:05.860]  Marco reached out to them and we're gonna obviously
[01:05.860 --> 01:07.460]  chop it up on a variety of things.
[01:07.460 --> 01:10.020]  But to be able to sit here and just kind of also
[01:10.020 --> 01:13.020]  show you guys in real time, there are a lot of us
[01:13.020 --> 01:15.620]  in the community that have started these little businesses.
[01:15.620 --> 01:18.540]  And we got our own little lane and we're growing together
[01:18.540 --> 01:19.660]  and that kind of stuff.
[01:19.660 --> 01:21.620]  But if you're sitting around on the couch,
[01:21.620 --> 01:23.420]  weeks have gone by since we kind of started
[01:23.420 --> 01:25.740]  mentioning this stuff and you still are telling me,
[01:25.740 --> 01:26.780]  oh, I gotta do that.
[01:26.780 --> 01:27.660]  Oh, I gotta do this.
[01:27.660 --> 01:29.340]  And you know who I'm talking to,
[01:29.340 --> 01:31.400]  a couple of individuals personally.
[01:31.400 --> 01:32.460]  I wanna see that, man.
[01:32.460 --> 01:34.700]  I wanna see you guys take it to the next.
[01:34.700 --> 01:36.300]  So again, hats off to individuals
[01:36.300 --> 01:39.020]  that are being entrepreneurs, not wantrepreneurs.
[01:39.020 --> 01:40.220]  Marco.
[01:40.220 --> 01:41.320]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:42.260 --> 01:43.100]  What's up Pete?
[01:43.100 --> 01:44.100]  What's up Matt?
[01:45.140 --> 01:46.740]  Pete is somebody that I met.
[01:46.740 --> 01:48.340]  He came to one of my workshops.
[01:48.340 --> 01:50.700]  So it's been going on a little over a year now.
[01:50.700 --> 01:52.900]  And man, we really hit it off
[01:52.940 --> 01:55.780]  and kind of been in touch ever since.
[01:55.780 --> 02:00.380]  We were able to link up out at Michael Permaculture Ninja.
[02:00.380 --> 02:03.020]  We went out to his Pawpaw Fest.
[02:03.020 --> 02:06.860]  So we linked up, had a nice session out there by the stream.
[02:08.220 --> 02:13.220]  And Pete's met my wife and he's just all around great guy.
[02:13.500 --> 02:16.740]  So when I asked Pete to be on, he said,
[02:16.740 --> 02:20.700]  hey man, I got my buddy Matt that knows a lot
[02:20.700 --> 02:22.520]  about what I'm doing, about what we're doing.
[02:23.480 --> 02:24.800]  Be a great add to the show.
[02:24.800 --> 02:27.200]  So I'm glad Matt to get you on here as well.
[02:27.200 --> 02:29.580]  So definitely thank you guys.
[02:29.580 --> 02:31.400]  It was a little short notice.
[02:31.400 --> 02:33.280]  People have been a little flaky now and then
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.120]  about coming on and that's understandable.
[02:36.120 --> 02:38.280]  People have a lot of stuff that comes up
[02:38.280 --> 02:39.120]  and stuff going on.
[02:39.120 --> 02:40.760]  So thank you all for coming.
[02:40.760 --> 02:44.680]  And it is cool to see people that are,
[02:44.680 --> 02:47.540]  maybe you're not a hundred percent into your business,
[02:47.540 --> 02:49.760]  meaning you got a few other things you're doing,
[02:49.760 --> 02:51.260]  but at least you have that business
[02:51.260 --> 02:54.500]  and you're starting down that road of entrepreneurship.
[02:54.500 --> 02:55.820]  So good to see you guys.
[02:55.820 --> 02:59.260]  And you know how we do, the Living Soil Nerds,
[02:59.260 --> 03:01.780]  this conversation could go pretty much any direction,
[03:01.780 --> 03:03.700]  but I guess I'll start with Pete,
[03:03.700 --> 03:05.860]  let you guys kind of introduce yourselves
[03:05.860 --> 03:06.980]  and then kick it over to Matt.
[03:06.980 --> 03:08.500]  And then we'll just kind of jump into it
[03:08.500 --> 03:10.600]  and talk about a little bit of everything.
[03:12.100 --> 03:12.940]  Right on.
[03:12.940 --> 03:15.020]  Well, yeah, thanks again, Marco.
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.100]  It's really a huge opportunity to be on here.
[03:18.100 --> 03:20.220]  And Matt's one of my best friends
[03:20.220 --> 03:22.340]  and we've been on the same path,
[03:22.340 --> 03:25.100]  kind of parallel paths for 11 years,
[03:25.100 --> 03:27.020]  best friends doing similar work
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.780]  and collaborating when we can.
[03:28.780 --> 03:31.060]  And yeah, he's just a wealth of knowledge
[03:31.060 --> 03:32.980]  and experience and really skilled guy.
[03:32.980 --> 03:35.300]  So thanks Matt for joining us.
[03:35.300 --> 03:38.420]  And yeah, so I'll just tell a little bit
[03:38.420 --> 03:39.800]  about my background.
[03:41.220 --> 03:44.740]  Yeah, I got into growing every kind of plant
[03:44.740 --> 03:45.980]  when I was in college.
[03:45.980 --> 03:49.060]  I got really bored with going to class.
[03:49.980 --> 03:51.620]  I was always really into cannabis
[03:51.620 --> 03:53.580]  and was just fascinated by the plant.
[03:53.580 --> 03:57.420]  And it really was kind of the gateway for me
[03:57.420 --> 03:58.740]  to get into growing plants.
[04:00.420 --> 04:03.580]  Such a magical electric plant to be around.
[04:03.580 --> 04:05.060]  And when I got to be around it, I said,
[04:05.060 --> 04:06.540]  I wanna learn more about growing,
[04:06.540 --> 04:10.060]  how to do this, how to grow this medicine.
[04:10.060 --> 04:12.940]  And that led me down the path
[04:12.940 --> 04:15.300]  of being more and more inspired to grow food.
[04:15.300 --> 04:18.620]  And that's really what I've spent most of my career doing
[04:19.140 --> 04:21.460]  is learning from some of the best farmers
[04:21.460 --> 04:25.140]  and growers that I could find all over the country
[04:25.140 --> 04:26.900]  and my specific region.
[04:26.900 --> 04:29.580]  I'm from Northern Virginia, Loudoun County.
[04:29.580 --> 04:32.380]  I grew up here and yeah,
[04:32.380 --> 04:35.360]  so I'm just coming off of four seasons
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.160]  of managing a nonprofit educational farm
[04:38.160 --> 04:39.740]  that we were growing vegetables
[04:39.740 --> 04:43.460]  that were all donated to a local food bank.
[04:43.460 --> 04:47.340]  And it was an amazing experience being able to do that
[04:48.020 --> 04:49.060]  while the pandemic happened,
[04:49.060 --> 04:54.020]  we escalated our production up 500% the second season
[04:54.020 --> 04:56.500]  to help supply the demands of the food bank.
[04:56.500 --> 04:59.420]  And they set up a little farmer's market
[04:59.420 --> 05:00.700]  with everything we grew there.
[05:00.700 --> 05:02.820]  And that had nothing to do with cannabis,
[05:02.820 --> 05:04.940]  but I was always really, really inspired
[05:04.940 --> 05:07.420]  by the cannabis community
[05:07.420 --> 05:11.300]  and all the incredible living soil conversations
[05:11.300 --> 05:12.900]  that were going on in the cannabis community
[05:12.900 --> 05:16.100]  that I wasn't really finding in the vegetable community
[05:16.100 --> 05:19.460]  or in quite in the nonprofit world yet,
[05:19.460 --> 05:21.260]  it was really ahead of the game.
[05:21.260 --> 05:24.460]  And I've grown my own hobby cannabis
[05:24.460 --> 05:26.860]  and have my own little medicinal garden,
[05:26.860 --> 05:29.300]  but really most of my career has been around food.
[05:29.300 --> 05:31.040]  And I'm really excited now that in Virginia,
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.940]  we can like fully get into growing our home plants, man.
[05:34.940 --> 05:38.140]  That was such a blessing and a privilege too
[05:38.140 --> 05:39.940]  to be able to do that.
[05:39.940 --> 05:41.820]  So yeah, two seasons into doing that
[05:41.820 --> 05:43.500]  and I've had a super fun time
[05:43.500 --> 05:45.820]  growing the homegrown cannabis
[05:46.540 --> 05:47.860]  and I think that's the way forward too
[05:47.860 --> 05:50.260]  of the whole industry,
[05:50.260 --> 05:51.740]  teaching people to grow at home,
[05:51.740 --> 05:54.660]  empowering people with the skills and mindset
[05:54.660 --> 05:55.980]  and all the tools they need
[05:55.980 --> 05:58.420]  to be a successful home grower.
[05:58.420 --> 06:00.700]  So that's kind of just a nutshell.
[06:00.700 --> 06:04.140]  Yeah, I have tons of stories and things we can get into,
[06:04.140 --> 06:07.600]  but I wanna give Matt a chance to introduce himself.
[06:07.600 --> 06:10.260]  I met Matt in Patagonia actually,
[06:10.260 --> 06:15.260]  we did this pretty wild wilderness leadership course
[06:15.380 --> 06:18.300]  and spent three months sea kayaking and mountaineering.
[06:18.300 --> 06:20.580]  And when you go through something like that with somebody,
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.220]  I mean, we're bros for life, you know, so.
[06:23.220 --> 06:25.180]  Yeah, I bet, man.
[06:25.180 --> 06:26.020]  It was powerful.
[06:26.020 --> 06:28.660]  So, and yeah, we got into permaculture
[06:28.660 --> 06:31.140]  kind of like we hadn't kept in touch for a while.
[06:31.140 --> 06:32.940]  And one day we just like called each other out of the blue
[06:32.940 --> 06:35.220]  and we're like, man, I just took this permaculture course.
[06:35.220 --> 06:36.060]  You heard of this?
[06:36.060 --> 06:38.260]  This was probably 10 years, at least 10 years ago
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.380]  and right after Patagonia.
[06:40.380 --> 06:42.720]  And we were just like, man, this is what we have to do.
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.960]  Like every skill, everything we can do to learn permaculture
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.960]  and share permaculture.
[06:47.960 --> 06:49.800]  And that's what we've been about, you know,
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.320]  and we live it and breathe it.
[06:51.320 --> 06:53.880]  So it's good stuff.
[06:53.880 --> 06:56.520]  Matt, yeah, introduce yourself, man.
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.280]  Cool, yeah, thanks Pete.
[06:59.840 --> 07:02.920]  Yeah, so I'm Matt Holt, I'm the owner operator
[07:02.920 --> 07:04.640]  of Stillwater Earthworks,
[07:04.640 --> 07:08.000]  which is a regenerative construction company.
[07:08.040 --> 07:12.360]  I generally do like permaculture design installations.
[07:13.200 --> 07:16.640]  So it ends up being like orchards and vineyards,
[07:16.640 --> 07:19.920]  digging ponds and terraces,
[07:21.320 --> 07:24.440]  a lot of like farm infrastructure and stuff like that.
[07:26.560 --> 07:31.120]  The way I got into growing in cannabis was,
[07:32.360 --> 07:34.600]  well, I've always kind of been like into
[07:34.600 --> 07:35.840]  like an outdoor person.
[07:36.760 --> 07:39.040]  I knew growing up, I wanted to like work outdoors.
[07:39.040 --> 07:40.920]  That's all I ever said when people would ask me
[07:40.920 --> 07:42.480]  what I wanna do when I grew up.
[07:42.480 --> 07:43.800]  I just wanna work outside.
[07:45.240 --> 07:48.600]  And at some point, like in eighth grade,
[07:48.600 --> 07:50.320]  some new kids moved to the school.
[07:50.320 --> 07:52.000]  I thought they were real cool skater kids,
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.720]  started hanging out with them.
[07:53.720 --> 07:58.720]  And long story short, ended up finding like, you know,
[07:58.800 --> 08:01.560]  their pops was grown in the basement kind of thing.
[08:01.560 --> 08:06.560]  And just like that was, I put that on a pedestal in my mind
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.920]  like growing cannabis at a young age.
[08:08.920 --> 08:11.840]  So I always knew that I was gonna get
[08:11.840 --> 08:15.480]  into the cannabis field somehow.
[08:15.480 --> 08:18.000]  So after I graduated high school,
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.800]  I went to a year of college in New Jersey,
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.640]  was studying plants and realized I wanted to grow plants,
[08:23.640 --> 08:24.680]  not study them.
[08:24.680 --> 08:29.680]  So me and my wife packed up a car and drove out to Humboldt.
[08:31.560 --> 08:35.640]  And we landed with my buddy, Bo,
[08:35.640 --> 08:38.600]  who ended up being like the farm manager
[08:38.600 --> 08:40.920]  for Humboldt Seed Companies.
[08:40.920 --> 08:44.440]  Seed Companies, they're a pilot farm out in Orleans.
[08:44.440 --> 08:47.440]  And got to link up with all those people.
[08:47.440 --> 08:50.160]  And just real quick out in Humboldt,
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.160]  like just met a lot of really awesome,
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.400]  potent, regenerative farmers doing the right thing.
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.000]  Family farms, beautiful properties,
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.480]  and like making a living for themselves.
[09:08.400 --> 09:13.400]  And I guess kind of trimmed my way up the ladder,
[09:13.720 --> 09:16.120]  started managing farms after a couple of years.
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.120]  And just living out in Humboldt,
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.600]  in the Emerald Triangle out there,
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.040]  like there's so much growing knowledge
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.760]  that it's really just an amazing opportunity
[09:31.760 --> 09:35.560]  to soak up the tip of the cultivation methods
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.960]  that are coming out fresh.
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.600]  I mean, it's like compost teas.
[09:41.600 --> 09:44.880]  And then right after that, like, oh, but you know,
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.840]  you wanna add anaerobic microbes to the soil.
[09:47.840 --> 09:50.080]  So fermented plant juices.
[09:50.080 --> 09:52.320]  And just like as these technologies are coming out
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.760]  and booming onto the scene,
[09:53.760 --> 09:55.520]  there's a whole community around you
[09:55.520 --> 09:58.840]  and really great gross supply shops and stuff like that.
[09:58.840 --> 10:01.960]  Literal people in like a co-op to talk to
[10:01.960 --> 10:04.560]  and talk about cannabis and strains
[10:04.560 --> 10:06.600]  and different breeding programs.
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.120]  So yeah, it was really deep in that world
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.640]  for a little bit out there.
[10:13.640 --> 10:18.640]  And as when Prop 64 rolled around,
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.400]  it really kind of rocked everybody's world, honestly,
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.760]  like having to go legal.
[10:27.760 --> 10:30.160]  But there was a lot of lessons that came out of that too.
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.040]  So I realized like being, you know,
[10:34.040 --> 10:35.400]  not growing up in Humboldt,
[10:36.320 --> 10:37.640]  we're on the West Coast or something.
[10:37.640 --> 10:38.960]  Like my whole family was on the East Coast.
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.200]  I felt like I was gonna come back here.
[10:40.200 --> 10:42.720]  So I really just kind of soaked up as much knowledge
[10:42.720 --> 10:45.200]  as I could and remained inspired.
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.120]  And man, like one thing that I saw was like,
[10:52.160 --> 10:54.760]  a lot of the permitting requirements,
[10:54.760 --> 10:58.760]  a lot of people had to update their properties
[10:58.760 --> 11:03.760]  with culverts and like responsible water system management.
[11:04.680 --> 11:07.920]  And a lot of that was like big machine operating,
[11:07.920 --> 11:09.880]  doing like really good projects,
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.640]  like long-term regenerative forestry kind of projects.
[11:14.640 --> 11:16.080]  And I was like, damn,
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.200]  this is how you make a big positive ripple in the world.
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.080]  Like just how I saw myself,
[11:24.080 --> 11:27.160]  maybe being able to do the most good with myself
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.160]  is jumping into actual land regeneration.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.640]  You know, I don't wanna call it development
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.080]  because nature has its divine pattern, but we, yeah.
[11:41.600 --> 11:44.720]  So there's a lot of parts of the story,
[11:44.720 --> 11:47.440]  but then I ended up moving back to Pennsylvania
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.560]  like five years ago with my family.
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.280]  And started working in the civil construction world
[11:54.280 --> 11:59.280]  and learned some project management, machine operating,
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.200]  but always kept permaculture dear to my heart,
[12:04.200 --> 12:06.000]  like where I wanted to be.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.640]  So working in the construction industry,
[12:07.640 --> 12:10.960]  like didn't feel like fulfilling,
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.520]  but I knew that I was going,
[12:13.520 --> 12:14.600]  it was like a stepping stone
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.640]  to be able to reach one of my goals.
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.960]  So about a year ago,
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.560]  I jumped off and started my own construction company,
[12:22.560 --> 12:26.880]  strictly handling regenerative projects.
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.880]  And I mean, it's really amazing to be a business owner
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.840]  that like sets your own code.
[12:36.840 --> 12:39.360]  Like, you know, you can choose to,
[12:39.360 --> 12:40.760]  or not to work with people
[12:40.760 --> 12:42.680]  if it's not aligned with your ethos.
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.440]  And that's been like the most liberating,
[12:44.440 --> 12:45.720]  life-changing aspect.
[12:45.840 --> 12:47.240]  Where's that bar at Marco?
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.160]  Being able to choose your own income.
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.880]  I cannot stress that enough.
[12:52.880 --> 12:54.360]  I know Marco's behind that buddy,
[12:54.360 --> 12:55.960]  where you're just talking about,
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.480]  not all money is good money.
[12:57.480 --> 12:59.520]  And it takes a while to get to that
[12:59.520 --> 13:00.720]  because if you're super hungry
[13:00.720 --> 13:02.200]  and you're grasping the straws,
[13:02.200 --> 13:04.280]  all money seems like it's good money.
[13:04.280 --> 13:06.160]  But then once you're a business owner,
[13:06.160 --> 13:07.560]  I just wanted to highlight that, man,
[13:07.560 --> 13:09.360]  because I don't think a lot of people realize that
[13:09.360 --> 13:12.400]  maybe until a year or two when they're really into it.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.240]  Yeah.
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.760]  And I mean, sorry, go on Marco.
[13:16.760 --> 13:18.400]  No, no, I'm just going to agree
[13:18.400 --> 13:20.360]  when I put the bar up was when you said
[13:20.360 --> 13:22.080]  you were doing that construction work
[13:22.080 --> 13:23.400]  and it wasn't fulfilling you
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.840]  and you went branched off
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.080]  and did your other thing parallel.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.040]  So that's what the bar is all about.
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.480]  Guys, somebody's got an app opening behind.
[13:34.480 --> 13:37.960]  We're getting a little bit of an echo from somebody.
[13:37.960 --> 13:39.840]  Just to let you guys know.
[13:39.840 --> 13:40.680]  Oh, that's probably me.
[13:40.680 --> 13:42.200]  Do I need to put headphones on?
[13:44.900 --> 13:45.740]  That's called-
[13:45.740 --> 13:47.620]  Headphones are best.
[13:47.620 --> 13:48.460]  Yeah.
[13:48.460 --> 13:49.780]  I don't know, that might be kind of-
[13:49.780 --> 13:50.900]  Yeah, because we're getting a little bit
[13:50.900 --> 13:52.060]  of a feedback loop.
[13:52.060 --> 13:52.900]  So just-
[13:55.700 --> 13:56.540]  All right, let me-
[13:56.540 --> 13:57.380]  Good deal.
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.460]  Hey, so just while we're working on that,
[14:00.460 --> 14:02.020]  the chat had a pretty good question
[14:02.020 --> 14:03.020]  that went along with that,
[14:03.020 --> 14:04.060]  backing up a little bit.
[14:04.060 --> 14:06.140]  Everybody says, you know, I want to go to Humboldt.
[14:06.140 --> 14:08.580]  I'm going to go out there and make it, right?
[14:08.580 --> 14:09.740]  So here's a great question.
[14:09.740 --> 14:12.380]  You know, what's the best way to go out there
[14:12.380 --> 14:15.700]  in a humble way, not be a tourist,
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.780]  and get access to the folks out there
[14:17.780 --> 14:20.820]  and get some real interaction
[14:20.820 --> 14:24.300]  instead of just brushing you off like kind of a tourist?
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.680]  I think it's, you actually have to get involved
[14:30.680 --> 14:32.400]  in the community.
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.040]  You got to show up to the seed swaps,
[14:36.040 --> 14:39.360]  which is an awesome event if you're a farmer
[14:39.360 --> 14:41.560]  and they have them in Humboldt.
[14:41.560 --> 14:44.560]  You have to go to the Emerald Cup
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.800]  and the other like cannabis events.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.040]  Sometimes they're invite only,
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.040]  but I mean, it's all the organic face-to-face interactions
[14:56.960 --> 14:59.680]  that will forge a relationship.
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.840]  So, you know, if you know there's like-minded people
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.240]  out there, you got to go find them, you know,
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.600]  where you think they'd be hanging out.
[15:08.600 --> 15:11.000]  Like I know there's a, in the Plaza in Arcata,
[15:11.440 --> 15:13.560]  there's a new building called The Thing,
[15:13.560 --> 15:15.520]  and they host a lot of events.
[15:15.520 --> 15:17.880]  Like our friend Toad does tarot readings there
[15:17.880 --> 15:22.880]  and the Humboldt Mycology hosts mycological events there.
[15:23.640 --> 15:26.480]  And of course there's cannabis events there.
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.280]  I know like Joey Burger, you know,
[15:29.280 --> 15:30.920]  is hosting events there and stuff like that.
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.160]  So it's really about linking in with the people
[15:34.160 --> 15:36.840]  that you want to, you know, just-
[15:36.840 --> 15:38.360]  Find your people, man.
[15:38.360 --> 15:39.600]  We say that all the time.
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.040]  I stole that from my wife.
[15:41.040 --> 15:42.240]  You got to find your people.
[15:42.240 --> 15:44.840]  And usually at a typical event,
[15:44.840 --> 15:46.800]  you're going to be the only natural farming
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.520]  or permaculture person there.
[15:48.520 --> 15:50.400]  Not at one of our events,
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.480]  like if you're just out and about, right?
[15:52.480 --> 15:53.960]  You're going to be one of very few.
[15:53.960 --> 15:56.920]  But when you go to these events, now you multiply all that.
[15:56.920 --> 15:59.480]  You've got touch, you can touch way more people.
[15:59.480 --> 16:01.360]  Now you can start making those contacts.
[16:01.360 --> 16:03.760]  So that'd probably be a wise investment.
[16:03.760 --> 16:06.920]  Start hitting some live events, get your feet out there,
[16:06.920 --> 16:08.440]  let people see you.
[16:08.760 --> 16:12.000]  People know that facial recognition,
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.040]  start building a rapport and work your way up that way.
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.600]  But I would say don't come on strong.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.440]  You know what I mean?
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.040]  Just come on, get in the game and feel your way out.
[16:23.040 --> 16:25.960]  Don't be pushy and see if somebody
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.640]  kind of take you under their wing.
[16:28.520 --> 16:30.160]  Yep.
[16:30.160 --> 16:31.640]  Yep.
[16:31.640 --> 16:34.040]  I think that's vital information.
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.720]  I think too, you know,
[16:35.720 --> 16:37.840]  sometimes when a guy likes a girl, right?
[16:37.840 --> 16:39.080]  They kind of beat around the bush.
[16:39.080 --> 16:40.080]  They're not direct with it.
[16:40.080 --> 16:40.920]  Like, hey, I like you.
[16:40.920 --> 16:42.920]  I'd like to take you out or whatever your approach is.
[16:42.920 --> 16:43.760]  Right?
[16:43.760 --> 16:46.400]  And I think sometimes when people are starstruck
[16:46.400 --> 16:48.720]  by other individuals, maybe they're out at Humboldt,
[16:48.720 --> 16:50.120]  they kind of do that same thing
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.560]  where they're like beating around the bush,
[16:51.560 --> 16:52.560]  they're showing up.
[16:52.560 --> 16:54.840]  I've found that most cannabis individuals,
[16:54.840 --> 16:58.080]  especially breeders or individuals with big long beards,
[16:58.080 --> 17:00.040]  such as yourself, Matt,
[17:00.040 --> 17:01.400]  they want that direct approach.
[17:01.400 --> 17:03.640]  Like, all right, you know, especially if you're young.
[17:03.640 --> 17:05.960]  All right, kid, what the fuck do you want from me?
[17:05.960 --> 17:07.280]  And if you just kind of come up to them
[17:07.920 --> 17:08.960]  in a politeful manner,
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.080]  hey man, you know, I'd just love to pick your brain on this
[17:12.080 --> 17:13.560]  or whatever your end goal is.
[17:13.560 --> 17:16.520]  I know from firsthand that they appreciate that.
[17:16.520 --> 17:19.200]  Then you just, hey, hey, how's it going?
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.280]  How's the weather?
[17:20.280 --> 17:23.400]  All this like, I know Marco appreciates that shit as well.
[17:23.400 --> 17:25.880]  You know, like the small talk that you think you need
[17:25.880 --> 17:29.840]  to have is going to probably hinder you trying
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.240]  to get those networks and stuff.
[17:31.240 --> 17:35.040]  So just direct, that's going to work with most people.
[17:35.040 --> 17:36.800]  That's a bar right there, Brian.
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.600]  The small talk could actually hinder you guys.
[17:40.600 --> 17:41.720]  That's a bar right there.
[17:41.720 --> 17:43.480]  That's a huge bar.
[17:43.480 --> 17:46.480]  Know your audience, know your people.
[17:47.400 --> 17:48.240]  Yeah, you got to-
[17:48.240 --> 17:49.320]  That works for females too,
[17:49.320 --> 17:51.840]  if you guys are out there struggling with the lanes.
[17:51.840 --> 17:54.680]  Just be direct, beeline it.
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.840]  You guys lock eyes, beeline that shit.
[17:56.840 --> 17:58.840]  What's the worst thing that could happen?
[17:58.840 --> 18:01.960]  You get turned down, then you find that out.
[18:01.960 --> 18:03.200]  And most people are looking at you like,
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.800]  hey, at least you tried.
[18:04.800 --> 18:05.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[18:05.640 --> 18:07.840]  Cannabis, nothing wrong with that.
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.240]  But like, yeah, I mean, like just for an example,
[18:12.240 --> 18:16.880]  like for some reason I built up, like, you know, all right.
[18:16.880 --> 18:19.680]  So people who have maybe like a big following
[18:19.680 --> 18:21.880]  on Instagram or something, cannabis breeders,
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.000]  like nobody hires somebody off of Instagram
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.920]  or nobody like really becomes tight homies on Instagram
[18:27.920 --> 18:29.760]  and never hangs out in person.
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.040]  And, but you know, these people maybe are personalities
[18:33.040 --> 18:34.200]  or something like that.
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.400]  And I live in the same town as Brian
[18:39.400 --> 18:43.280]  from Scarlet Fire Farms, Dragon With Matches.
[18:43.280 --> 18:45.920]  And he seemed real big to me, you know?
[18:45.920 --> 18:49.360]  And like, I would see him every other day
[18:49.360 --> 18:51.800]  at the Lighthouse, this place that we ate at in Trinidad.
[18:51.800 --> 18:55.000]  And like, for some reason, it took me a couple times
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.520]  of seeing him to approach him.
[18:56.520 --> 18:58.200]  But when I did, then he was just like,
[18:58.200 --> 18:59.160]  oh yeah, what's up dude?
[18:59.160 --> 19:03.000]  Like, you know, in the flow, like you just,
[19:03.520 --> 19:05.080]  we're doing all the same shit, you know?
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.960]  Like it's, there's not like,
[19:06.960 --> 19:08.120]  there doesn't have to be a divide
[19:08.120 --> 19:09.480]  or somebody put on a pedestal.
[19:09.480 --> 19:11.760]  Like we're all real people.
[19:11.760 --> 19:12.600]  And-
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.480]  That's the ones that do put on that divide
[19:14.480 --> 19:16.240]  that you gotta kind of watch to me.
[19:16.240 --> 19:19.920]  Like the ones that try to put their head above the others.
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.760]  You know what I mean?
[19:20.760 --> 19:22.520]  Like I get that you want to do that
[19:22.520 --> 19:24.480]  by your deeds and your works.
[19:24.480 --> 19:25.320]  Yeah.
[19:25.320 --> 19:28.040]  But not by your attitude and your act, you know,
[19:28.040 --> 19:28.880]  dealing with people.
[19:28.880 --> 19:30.400]  Yeah, well, you don't want to hang out
[19:30.400 --> 19:31.560]  with them anyways then, right?
[19:32.440 --> 19:33.280]  Exactly.
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.560]  Yeah.
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.520]  Kind of the beauty of Humboldt is that you're learning,
[19:39.520 --> 19:43.760]  in my opinion, from the true OGs of regenerative farming,
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.520]  which they were just growing outdoors
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.360]  and trying to figure it out.
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.080]  The lore and legends out there,
[19:49.080 --> 19:51.480]  one of the ones I think was more of like the hippie mafia,
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.960]  from what I understand.
[19:52.960 --> 19:55.080]  They weren't a real mafia, obviously.
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.080]  They were just, you know, a group of individuals
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.160]  that from what I understand were regenerative farming
[20:00.360 --> 20:02.560]  or trying to get to that at that point.
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.080]  So I think that might be the birth, at least in America,
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.760]  from where cannabis farming was kind of,
[20:08.760 --> 20:11.200]  you know, the OGs of the OGs started out from there.
[20:11.200 --> 20:12.040]  So when you were out there,
[20:12.040 --> 20:14.200]  are there other life lessons that you learned
[20:14.200 --> 20:16.560]  or things that, you know,
[20:16.560 --> 20:18.840]  genetics that just seem to be tried and true?
[20:18.840 --> 20:21.360]  Obviously Humboldt seeds and derivatives of that,
[20:21.360 --> 20:23.920]  you know, people rock that around the world.
[20:23.920 --> 20:25.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:25.280 --> 20:28.560]  Well, yeah.
[20:28.560 --> 20:31.840]  Like as far as what I learned, man,
[20:31.840 --> 20:36.040]  I mean, it's like being in the epicenter
[20:36.040 --> 20:39.160]  of cannabis breeding and culture.
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.240]  So like having the access to sample, taste,
[20:43.240 --> 20:45.000]  witness how many different,
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.360]  how all these different varieties grow,
[20:48.360 --> 20:53.080]  smell, express themselves in different like bio regions,
[20:53.080 --> 20:54.240]  because like, you know,
[20:54.240 --> 20:57.640]  something on the coast is gonna finish up way different
[20:57.640 --> 21:00.120]  than something on the, like, you know,
[21:00.120 --> 21:02.320]  30 miles inland or something like that,
[21:02.320 --> 21:03.520]  high up on a ridge,
[21:04.640 --> 21:07.200]  just because they have different environmental factors
[21:07.200 --> 21:11.800]  that they're trying to work with and against, you know,
[21:11.800 --> 21:13.560]  like obviously humidity on the coast
[21:13.560 --> 21:18.560]  and like super hot, dry, harsh summer out on the mountains.
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.480]  So like really you learn,
[21:28.360 --> 21:31.160]  what does well in your region while you're like,
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.320]  by growing there, right?
[21:32.320 --> 21:33.640]  And also everybody else around,
[21:33.640 --> 21:35.440]  there's so many people growing that,
[21:35.440 --> 21:38.160]  like you see things that do well with higher humidity.
[21:38.160 --> 21:43.160]  So there's just a real like pattern literacy.
[21:43.280 --> 21:45.320]  It's hard to sum it up in just a couple of words,
[21:45.320 --> 21:48.240]  but there's a real pattern literacy that you learn about
[21:49.560 --> 21:51.840]  all the different varieties of cannabis.
[21:51.840 --> 21:54.840]  And you start to be able to predict
[21:54.840 --> 21:56.720]  what would do well in a region.
[21:56.720 --> 22:00.640]  And so coming back to the East coast,
[22:00.640 --> 22:04.120]  like the climate's totally different over here, you know,
[22:04.120 --> 22:05.600]  like growing in Virginia is way different
[22:05.600 --> 22:07.960]  than growing in the Central Valley.
[22:07.960 --> 22:12.960]  And I think the biggest factor
[22:13.240 --> 22:18.240]  to be able to determine like a good outcome is genetics.
[22:18.960 --> 22:23.920]  And so it's gonna be like botrytis resistance
[22:23.960 --> 22:26.760]  in some degree and powder mildew resistance.
[22:26.760 --> 22:31.240]  And honestly like an early finisher
[22:31.240 --> 22:35.960]  because it gets cold and wet quick and gloomy and dark.
[22:35.960 --> 22:38.360]  And it's just like kinda hard to finish stuff up.
[22:38.360 --> 22:43.360]  So, but beyond that, like it's funny because in Humboldt,
[22:46.360 --> 22:50.840]  there was a lot of super awesome built,
[22:50.840 --> 22:55.360]  highly amended, organic potting soil.
[22:55.360 --> 22:57.000]  Everyone's grown in potting soil, you know,
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.720]  because the native soil more or less isn't that great
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.680]  because agricultural land's super expensive
[23:03.680 --> 23:04.760]  and there's not a lot of it,
[23:04.760 --> 23:05.920]  even though they're trying to push
[23:05.920 --> 23:08.600]  the permanent people onto ag land.
[23:08.600 --> 23:10.240]  Now that isn't historically how it's been.
[23:10.240 --> 23:12.320]  You've been out in the cuts up on the hill
[23:12.320 --> 23:15.800]  and it's like rocky and like sandy, clay,
[23:15.800 --> 23:18.360]  like not super nutrient dense.
[23:18.360 --> 23:20.440]  So you come over here and you put something in the ground,
[23:21.080 --> 23:22.160]  like that shit fires off.
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.840]  And like, I mean, it's, you know,
[23:25.840 --> 23:30.560]  if you have some soil literacy, like you get a soil test
[23:30.560 --> 23:33.240]  and it's pretty easy to remineralize, you know,
[23:33.240 --> 23:36.120]  that's like, it's like a numbers game, you know?
[23:36.120 --> 23:40.280]  And then beyond that, if you're conscious of the moisture
[23:40.280 --> 23:43.520]  and the tilth of it, like, man, I mean,
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.680]  cannabis plants are so receptive.
[23:45.680 --> 23:48.800]  So like if you get some good genetics,
[23:48.800 --> 23:52.280]  you're gonna have great success in my opinion.
[23:53.240 --> 23:54.080]  Is that not right?
[23:54.080 --> 23:54.920]  Yeah, I gotta agree.
[23:54.920 --> 23:58.440]  Yeah, man, genetics is a huge factor.
[23:58.440 --> 24:00.160]  You know, one of the most important ones.
[24:00.160 --> 24:02.040]  And that was a bar you said,
[24:02.040 --> 24:05.640]  because it's also a factor of just being resistant to pests,
[24:05.640 --> 24:07.120]  being resistant to disease.
[24:07.120 --> 24:09.680]  That comes from your genetics as well, guys.
[24:09.680 --> 24:12.960]  Genetics isn't just your, you know, trichomes,
[24:12.960 --> 24:14.560]  your frost, your, you know,
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.320]  there's a lot more to it than that.
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.280]  Yeah.
[24:18.880 --> 24:20.920]  And when you're going deeper into your genetics,
[24:20.920 --> 24:22.800]  I think it's important to realize
[24:22.800 --> 24:24.840]  that you might've run somebody's genetics,
[24:24.840 --> 24:26.600]  you pop two of their packs,
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.280]  you feel a certain way about it,
[24:28.280 --> 24:30.120]  but listen to individuals that are growing
[24:30.120 --> 24:31.960]  on a larger scale,
[24:31.960 --> 24:33.960]  because they're obviously, you know,
[24:33.960 --> 24:36.240]  their data is better than yours.
[24:36.240 --> 24:38.320]  So sometimes when you pack some, you know,
[24:38.320 --> 24:41.720]  pop hundreds of seeds,
[24:41.720 --> 24:46.280]  your view on other people's work will change.
[24:46.280 --> 24:47.280]  So that's why I always think
[24:47.280 --> 24:49.280]  just constantly be pheno hunting.
[24:49.280 --> 24:51.480]  When you're, you know, set for success,
[24:51.480 --> 24:53.160]  I think a lot of us are always like,
[24:53.160 --> 24:55.920]  wanna keep the good stuff for a rainy day.
[24:55.920 --> 24:58.200]  Now's that time for that rainy day, in my opinion.
[24:58.200 --> 24:59.400]  I mean, there's so much,
[25:00.320 --> 25:02.040]  we even had this like a website,
[25:02.040 --> 25:04.320]  seed hoarders that we wanted to put together and stuff.
[25:04.320 --> 25:07.120]  I think that defines people in the cannabis game
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.800]  is it's not seed growers for the most part.
[25:09.800 --> 25:11.800]  We do pop some of our beans,
[25:11.800 --> 25:14.280]  but we don't pop the ones that I think are,
[25:14.280 --> 25:17.320]  I mean, imagine all the people around in this,
[25:17.320 --> 25:18.680]  just in the United States.
[25:18.680 --> 25:22.120]  I mean, the overall genetics that haven't been popped yet,
[25:22.120 --> 25:23.960]  it's gotta be mind boggling.
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.960]  I wanna get Pete back into the conversation.
[25:26.960 --> 25:28.000]  I know.
[25:28.000 --> 25:28.840]  Yeah, brother.
[25:29.680 --> 25:32.280]  And I wanted to kind of also understand, you know,
[25:32.280 --> 25:35.960]  I really admire people that are working for 5013Cs
[25:35.960 --> 25:37.440]  when you're getting to the next level
[25:37.440 --> 25:40.600]  and nonprofits, helping children, veterans.
[25:40.600 --> 25:42.040]  I mean, those are really the two things
[25:42.040 --> 25:44.200]  that I have never been burned on, man.
[25:44.200 --> 25:45.840]  You know, kids don't wanna fuck you over.
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.720]  Veterans just appreciative that you wanna sit there
[25:47.720 --> 25:48.960]  and smoke weed with them.
[25:48.960 --> 25:50.920]  So when you're growing food,
[25:50.920 --> 25:53.000]  I think that's just another skillset, man.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.840]  When you're giving back, you're giving to kids,
[25:55.840 --> 25:58.680]  you're showing them, hey, you need real nutrients over here.
[25:58.680 --> 26:01.480]  If you wanna be, you know, better at the, you know,
[26:01.480 --> 26:03.640]  with my kids, I'm like, hey, you wanna do more pull-ups?
[26:03.640 --> 26:05.040]  You know, you gotta have these nutrients
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.040]  so that tomorrow you can do more pull-ups than Isaac
[26:08.040 --> 26:09.560]  or all these other little kids that are out there.
[26:09.560 --> 26:10.400]  Boom.
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.240]  Right?
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.720]  So I think when you're growing all that, Pete,
[26:13.720 --> 26:16.920]  you're not only showing it by the, you know,
[26:16.920 --> 26:18.320]  the fruits of your labor,
[26:18.320 --> 26:20.600]  but I think a lot of kids are starting to recognize like,
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.960]  okay, food comes from the ground.
[26:22.960 --> 26:24.520]  You know, when you just go to the grocery store,
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.360]  it's almost like a mind fuck, even to my children.
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.680]  They're like, they just think it magically appears.
[26:29.680 --> 26:30.520]  Yeah.
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.400]  Yeah. Well, thank you, man.
[26:32.400 --> 26:33.240]  I appreciate it.
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.160]  Those are kind words.
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.160]  And yeah, I've taught a lot of kids over the years
[26:39.160 --> 26:41.360]  and seeing a lot of that firsthand,
[26:41.360 --> 26:43.520]  kids just have no idea where the food comes from.
[26:43.520 --> 26:46.720]  They see a chicken and don't realize that that's a chicken
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.760]  that is the same chicken that they might eat in, you know,
[26:50.760 --> 26:51.600]  as meat form.
[26:51.600 --> 26:54.760]  So it's wild to help guide children
[26:54.760 --> 26:57.600]  through that whole experience of realizing, you know,
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.360]  the full connection to food, but kids really get it.
[27:00.360 --> 27:01.680]  And they're super receptive to it,
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.560]  which is why I am always most inspired to work with kids
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.360]  and plant those seeds in them of talking to their friends
[27:10.360 --> 27:13.520]  and their parents, even getting them excited about soil.
[27:13.520 --> 27:16.320]  I'm always trying to get kids that were coming to the farm
[27:16.320 --> 27:18.400]  excited about composting at home
[27:18.400 --> 27:21.440]  and talking about the mycelial network that, you know,
[27:21.440 --> 27:24.880]  holds the forest together and communicates and all that
[27:24.880 --> 27:27.600]  and try to distill it in a really simple way
[27:27.600 --> 27:29.040]  so that they can understand it.
[27:29.040 --> 27:31.560]  Because, you know, I take in,
[27:31.560 --> 27:34.040]  we all take in a lot of really kind of heady information
[27:34.040 --> 27:36.320]  and go down these rabbit holes of, you know,
[27:36.320 --> 27:39.520]  all these different minerals and whatever,
[27:39.520 --> 27:41.800]  but for kids, they just want that spark of something
[27:41.800 --> 27:42.840]  that gets them excited about it.
[27:42.840 --> 27:45.560]  So I've sort of learned to speak that language
[27:45.560 --> 27:48.080]  and come at it from that approach.
[27:48.080 --> 27:52.760]  But yeah, man, it's really cool watching kids light up.
[27:52.760 --> 27:55.640]  And I had the opportunity of managing a farm
[27:55.640 --> 27:58.680]  that we were doing a lot of conventional organic production
[27:58.680 --> 28:00.640]  alongside these sort of experiments
[28:00.640 --> 28:03.920]  that I was kind of spearheading with No-Till
[28:04.800 --> 28:06.720]  and the more regenerative and agroforestry stuff,
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.120]  which we can get into later.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.560]  But, you know, the kids were really curious of like,
[28:12.560 --> 28:15.320]  you know, when we used to use the plastic mulch,
[28:15.320 --> 28:16.880]  they were like, why is this plastic here?
[28:16.880 --> 28:17.840]  What is this?
[28:17.840 --> 28:20.040]  You know, and that's the most commonly used thing
[28:20.040 --> 28:21.160]  in organic agriculture.
[28:21.160 --> 28:23.920]  Like, you know, farms are tilling
[28:23.920 --> 28:25.360]  and laying down this plastic mulch
[28:25.360 --> 28:27.960]  that the soil just bakes and it's really hard to irrigate
[28:27.960 --> 28:29.640]  and they waste tons of water.
[28:29.640 --> 28:32.200]  You know, I've done it and seen it on many farms
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.800]  and kids right away are just like, what is this?
[28:34.800 --> 28:35.720]  Like, this doesn't make sense.
[28:35.720 --> 28:36.800]  Like, why you got plastic here?
[28:36.800 --> 28:39.520]  And then walk over to the field
[28:39.520 --> 28:40.760]  that the mushrooms are popping up
[28:40.760 --> 28:42.440]  and then they're just like, whoa, what is that?
[28:42.440 --> 28:44.920]  You know, so kids get it really easy.
[28:44.920 --> 28:48.040]  And, you know, any adults that come curious
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.120]  to the farm do too.
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.240]  Like, you know, it's, everybody can get in touch
[28:52.240 --> 28:54.680]  with their inner child there and, oh, nice man.
[28:55.920 --> 28:57.440]  Appreciate that.
[28:57.440 --> 28:58.920]  Yeah, it's nice.
[28:58.920 --> 29:01.760]  Yeah, so some of those, you know, those crop fields,
[29:02.320 --> 29:03.160]  sorry to cut you off, Pete, but I want to-
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.000]  Oh, you're good, man.
[29:04.000 --> 29:04.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:04.840 --> 29:06.600]  This is a big, you know, nice scale here.
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.440]  I love it.
[29:07.440 --> 29:09.120]  Yeah, we were working at a pretty big scale.
[29:09.120 --> 29:12.480]  So it was mostly just me and one other person.
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.680]  So it was a lot of labor that we put into it over the years.
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.480]  You know, I gave everything to it.
[29:18.480 --> 29:21.240]  I'm excited to do some entrepreneurial stuff too
[29:21.240 --> 29:24.120]  with all that energy that I won't be putting full-time
[29:24.120 --> 29:24.960]  into the farm.
[29:26.080 --> 29:28.920]  But yeah, man, so I learned so much.
[29:28.920 --> 29:32.480]  I was able to experiment and test things out, you know,
[29:32.480 --> 29:35.160]  and the organization I work for is really supportive
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.120]  of all my kind of, you know, hippie ideas
[29:37.120 --> 29:39.480]  of regenerative stuff and natural farming
[29:39.480 --> 29:42.000]  that was kind of, you know, it's foreign to a lot of people
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.800]  and it's not, a lot of people commonly, you know,
[29:45.800 --> 29:47.000]  not in the organization I work for,
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.280]  but common people see a corn field, they think,
[29:49.280 --> 29:52.000]  oh, farming, you know, just like that's farming.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.840]  And I was always trying to show that that is not farming.
[29:54.840 --> 29:56.960]  Farming is diversified,
[29:58.200 --> 30:00.360]  fitting all you can into one space
[30:00.360 --> 30:03.880]  and, you know, really trying to showcase that.
[30:03.880 --> 30:06.080]  And Matt's doing that too.
[30:06.080 --> 30:07.960]  You know, I wanted to mention Matt's an amazing homesteader.
[30:07.960 --> 30:10.080]  We're both ultimately really trying to,
[30:10.080 --> 30:11.240]  we really just want to homestead
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.720]  and trying to get other people homesteading
[30:12.720 --> 30:15.240]  so that one day everybody can just kind of be
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.600]  a community of homesteaders.
[30:16.600 --> 30:19.360]  That's, you know, big picture, visionary stuff.
[30:19.360 --> 30:22.680]  But it's just a fun way to live, growing food, you know?
[30:22.680 --> 30:24.600]  It's like, what else do we need to do
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.440]  if we're all out in our gardens all day,
[30:26.440 --> 30:31.440]  just with our families, putting away food for the winter,
[30:31.480 --> 30:33.680]  nested in, like that's good life, man.
[30:33.680 --> 30:38.280]  So that's what I'm aspiring towards.
[30:38.280 --> 30:39.120]  I love it.
[30:39.120 --> 30:41.320]  You know, I was just like, I say this all the time.
[30:41.320 --> 30:44.800]  I hate that I gotta repeat myself, but I do guys.
[30:45.640 --> 30:46.480]  Do it.
[30:46.480 --> 30:50.160]  You know, life is just like, should be waking up.
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.480]  I woke up, right?
[30:51.480 --> 30:53.800]  Step one, no matter what your life is,
[30:53.800 --> 30:55.440]  that's a joyous thing.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.680]  Now, step two, what do I have to do?
[30:57.680 --> 30:59.120]  Do I have animals to attend to?
[30:59.120 --> 31:01.240]  Do I have crops to tend to?
[31:01.240 --> 31:04.760]  What is, you know, why does it have to be wake up,
[31:04.760 --> 31:08.560]  get in the car, drive to the office, do that?
[31:08.560 --> 31:09.800]  It doesn't have to be that.
[31:09.800 --> 31:11.920]  And that's one thing I really like about you guys.
[31:11.920 --> 31:15.000]  I was telling Brian, you guys are kind of like that wave of,
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.840]  and I say young and with respect,
[31:16.840 --> 31:20.760]  because you're just a little bit younger than me,
[31:20.760 --> 31:23.560]  but younger guys that are going ahead
[31:23.560 --> 31:25.520]  and kind of foregoing that whole,
[31:25.520 --> 31:27.160]  you gotta do this for 20 years,
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.360]  then retire, then do that, right?
[31:29.360 --> 31:31.240]  And so I really think that's big.
[31:31.240 --> 31:34.480]  And the keys though, like you said, having that business,
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.320]  having that, you know, permaculture construction.
[31:37.320 --> 31:39.360]  I'm, you know, I'm a construction guy
[31:40.320 --> 31:43.000]  and I'm really curious kind of what kind of projects,
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.840]  you know, you guys have worked on, Matt,
[31:44.840 --> 31:47.400]  at kind of going towards that a little bit, if we could.
[31:47.400 --> 31:49.640]  Real quick, before you get into that, Matt,
[31:49.640 --> 31:52.400]  I wanted to just build off the waking up
[31:52.400 --> 31:54.080]  kind of comment that you made, Marco,
[31:54.080 --> 31:56.480]  because Matt and I met at a time
[31:56.480 --> 31:59.680]  where we were both waking up in our really early twenties,
[31:59.680 --> 32:01.960]  like, you know, just like realizing that the system,
[32:01.960 --> 32:05.520]  like we don't have to be a part of this whole,
[32:05.520 --> 32:08.240]  whatever it is, this industrial complex.
[32:08.240 --> 32:10.000]  And so we met in the wilderness
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  and the wilderness really shaped us and reinforced that,
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.920]  like, no, you don't have to go back into that matrix.
[32:15.920 --> 32:18.160]  Like you can connect with nature
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.240]  and do something completely different.
[32:20.240 --> 32:22.960]  We were just in the wilderness meditating on that,
[32:22.960 --> 32:26.040]  you know, didn't see people for hundreds of miles,
[32:26.040 --> 32:28.280]  met these gauchos that were out there living,
[32:28.280 --> 32:30.240]  you know, a hundred miles from anybody
[32:30.240 --> 32:32.640]  and would like feel it in the soil
[32:32.640 --> 32:35.040]  that we were coming to, you know, days before,
[32:35.040 --> 32:36.360]  you know, stuff like that.
[32:37.600 --> 32:40.280]  Waking up is a really important part of this whole thing
[32:40.280 --> 32:41.360]  and just getting people to realize
[32:41.360 --> 32:43.960]  we have a lot of connection to nature and wisdom
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.600]  and knowledge that is just within us.
[32:45.600 --> 32:49.520]  And if we just observe nature, it'll help us out.
[32:49.520 --> 32:53.240]  But Matt, yeah, definitely focusing on what you're doing
[32:53.240 --> 32:54.080]  because that's-
[32:54.080 --> 32:57.920]  Wait a minute now, I like that vibe we're on right there
[32:57.920 --> 32:59.520]  because that is touching, man.
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.680]  You starting with that waking up, right?
[33:01.680 --> 33:02.720]  And then you're going to that.
[33:02.720 --> 33:03.880]  And that's pretty sweet, man.
[33:03.880 --> 33:05.400]  You guys were conscious and were like,
[33:05.400 --> 33:07.480]  you know what, man, we don't have to live that system.
[33:07.480 --> 33:10.360]  We don't have to do that every day, right, Brian?
[33:10.360 --> 33:12.000]  I mean, you do the same thing, man.
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.200]  You know what I mean?
[33:13.200 --> 33:15.120]  Absolutely, get to pick your day.
[33:15.640 --> 33:16.640]  Hey, I was surprised to see too, Pete,
[33:16.640 --> 33:18.520]  when you're growing the vegetables for the children,
[33:18.520 --> 33:20.560]  you're out there listening to Gucci, man?
[33:21.680 --> 33:22.800]  That's right, man.
[33:22.800 --> 33:23.640]  All right.
[33:23.640 --> 33:24.720]  Yeah, man.
[33:24.720 --> 33:26.840]  Yeah, that kind of hit my heart a little bit.
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.280]  It reminded me of a takeoff, dude,
[33:28.280 --> 33:31.600]  that takeoff passing yesterday, really.
[33:31.600 --> 33:33.040]  Yeah, I love trap music.
[33:33.040 --> 33:34.720]  Dice games are fucked up, man.
[33:34.720 --> 33:36.000]  Man, the whole thing is fucked up, dude.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.480]  You've never seen a dice game.
[33:37.480 --> 33:39.520]  Congratulations, you don't want to.
[33:39.520 --> 33:40.360]  Whole thing is fucked up.
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.480]  That shit never ends right.
[33:41.480 --> 33:43.080]  Yeah, super tragic.
[33:44.080 --> 33:44.920]  But yeah.
[33:44.920 --> 33:45.880]  Especially when you got that kind of money, man.
[33:45.880 --> 33:46.960]  What are you doing?
[33:46.960 --> 33:48.440]  You know?
[33:48.440 --> 33:51.000]  I'd be at the hot hand with Bill Gates or something,
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.760]  you know, trying to run it up.
[33:52.760 --> 33:54.800]  Man, man, man.
[33:54.800 --> 33:57.720]  So yeah, it's cool to see that you're cultured there,
[33:57.720 --> 33:59.400]  Pete, with the whole like, you know,
[33:59.400 --> 34:03.040]  nothing really grows vegetables like Gucci man lyrics.
[34:03.040 --> 34:05.040]  I mean, sometimes, dude.
[34:05.040 --> 34:06.040]  Sometimes, yeah, man.
[34:06.040 --> 34:07.960]  Sometimes that really helps.
[34:07.960 --> 34:10.680]  I used to farm a lot to young dolphins,
[34:10.720 --> 34:15.240]  some hard stuff that really motivated me when I was.
[34:15.240 --> 34:16.080]  Yeah, Pete likes it.
[34:16.080 --> 34:16.920]  He likes it, man.
[34:16.920 --> 34:18.080]  He likes the hip hop, for sure.
[34:18.080 --> 34:19.880]  Yeah, and some house music too.
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.160]  If I'm needing to just like flow,
[34:21.160 --> 34:23.040]  I put on some house music.
[34:23.040 --> 34:23.880]  Amen.
[34:23.880 --> 34:24.720]  Well, everything.
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.040]  I love music.
[34:26.040 --> 34:27.160]  Nice.
[34:27.160 --> 34:28.000]  Shit, man.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.320]  When you talk about a dice game, man, just not the,
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.120]  I mean, this is just real life here, guys.
[34:32.120 --> 34:33.200]  Sunday morning.
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.920]  So my wife goes in to take clients today, right?
[34:38.920 --> 34:41.080]  And then one of our clients says,
[34:41.080 --> 34:42.760]  your building was on the news.
[34:42.760 --> 34:44.760]  Like our building where our farm is,
[34:44.760 --> 34:47.280]  Pete, you know, where we have the workshop.
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.360]  So she sends me the article and the guy literally shot dead
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.800]  in the street late Saturday morning,
[34:53.800 --> 34:56.560]  right there in front of that building, 12 shots.
[34:56.560 --> 34:58.560]  So I finally made it over there
[34:58.560 --> 35:01.200]  and I still bloodstained in the street, dude.
[35:01.200 --> 35:04.040]  Like, you know, like we think about the celebrity that died,
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.440]  but there's so many men dying real life right here near you.
[35:08.960 --> 35:11.640]  So not that we want to turn the show that direction,
[35:11.640 --> 35:14.040]  but that's why we want to keep it positive.
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.080]  First of all, not a lot of farming going on at, you know,
[35:17.080 --> 35:18.480]  three, four, five in the morning.
[35:18.480 --> 35:21.400]  So there's not a lot of positive shit happening out there
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.880]  at that time of day.
[35:22.880 --> 35:24.920]  But, you know, just real life, man.
[35:24.920 --> 35:27.000]  Just, you know, keep your head on a swivel out there
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.640]  and stay positive is all I'm getting at.
[35:28.640 --> 35:31.840]  So let's just kind of get back to the positivity, I guess.
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.840]  Yeah.
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.240]  I mean, I feel like we can take those stories
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.080]  and be inspired to try to do something about it, right?
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.800]  And like, I think it comes back to building community
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.000]  almost every time, like a healthy community,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  one that like grows food for each other
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.080]  and is invested in projects together
[35:53.080 --> 35:55.720]  and wants to see each other succeed.
[35:57.600 --> 36:01.960]  Because that kind of struggle happens
[36:01.960 --> 36:03.760]  in all types of communities
[36:04.040 --> 36:06.320]  where people are just disconnected
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.560]  from a real support system.
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.280]  And I think that that's what my first,
[36:14.280 --> 36:17.200]  my biggest lesson first year of being a business owner
[36:17.200 --> 36:20.120]  is there's no way I can do this alone.
[36:20.120 --> 36:24.080]  And it's not like I just need to hire a couple people
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.520]  to work for me.
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.880]  Like, no, I need people to work with me.
[36:28.760 --> 36:31.880]  Like, yes, like on my actual projects,
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.400]  but then like the kind of work that we wanna do
[36:35.400 --> 36:40.400]  and aspire for, like we wanna myceliate the world.
[36:41.560 --> 36:46.560]  We want cities to be dripping with fruit and nuts
[36:46.840 --> 36:49.040]  and perennial vegetables.
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.040]  And like big aspirations in the permaculture community.
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.240]  And like, there has to be real action
[36:59.240 --> 37:01.120]  tying this stuff together.
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.080]  And the way I see that,
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.160]  yeah, the way I've been seeing that happen is events.
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.800]  And I'm gonna plug an event right now,
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.240]  MycoFest, MycoSymbiotics.
[37:19.160 --> 37:23.560]  Man, there was so many real life connections that were made
[37:23.560 --> 37:26.760]  and have propelled forward to this current time
[37:26.760 --> 37:28.760]  through that fest and so many others.
[37:28.760 --> 37:33.760]  But just the community, you know?
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.480]  Like, I think a lot of people are searching for community
[37:37.480 --> 37:39.560]  and we find it online.
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.720]  So we're able to be reinforced that our ideas are good
[37:43.720 --> 37:45.840]  and that like, you know, keep it up, keep going.
[37:45.840 --> 37:47.240]  Like, I'm here for you.
[37:47.240 --> 37:49.080]  You know, anytime you need to bounce some ideas
[37:49.080 --> 37:51.200]  and talk and do the ethereal thing.
[37:51.200 --> 37:54.080]  But like, man, sometimes you actually need someone
[37:54.080 --> 37:56.800]  to be in the trench with you, digging with a shovel,
[37:56.800 --> 37:59.600]  you know, going at it and planting trees.
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.160]  And likewise, because planting trees
[38:03.160 --> 38:04.440]  on other people's properties
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.440]  and just really doing that actual community outreach.
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.000]  Like, it's a lot easier said than done, no doubt.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.760]  But I think it's like the most important work.
[38:17.760 --> 38:19.800]  And it's the only way that I see like,
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.640]  like as an entrepreneur and having like
[38:21.640 --> 38:22.680]  a successful business,
[38:22.680 --> 38:25.400]  that's the only way I see my business succeeding.
[38:25.440 --> 38:28.840]  Like, is by being like valued by the community,
[38:28.840 --> 38:31.400]  because if people don't value what I do,
[38:31.400 --> 38:34.120]  why are they gonna wanna, you know, support me
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.000]  and end up paying me for my services?
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.160]  Because those payments, it's literally feeding my kids.
[38:40.160 --> 38:42.200]  It's literally keeping the roof over our head.
[38:42.200 --> 38:44.960]  It's literally putting fuel in my vehicles
[38:44.960 --> 38:45.800]  and like stuff like that.
[38:45.800 --> 38:46.640]  You know what I mean?
[38:46.640 --> 38:51.640]  Like, it's so like, I'm trying to take out the,
[38:52.160 --> 38:54.920]  that separation of, you know,
[38:54.920 --> 38:58.240]  like lording over anybody that you're working for,
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.600]  doing a project for like,
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.800]  and the best thing coming back to like, you know, doing,
[39:03.800 --> 39:07.560]  being able to choose who you work for and with.
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.560]  Like, almost all my clients who I started working for
[39:12.560 --> 39:15.440]  and all my friends and some of my best friends.
[39:15.440 --> 39:18.600]  And like, it's just a beautiful thing where like,
[39:18.600 --> 39:19.440]  you know, I'm like,
[39:19.480 --> 39:21.840]  it's just a beautiful thing where like, you know,
[39:21.840 --> 39:23.720]  right now, like where I was today,
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.800]  I was just like doing some grading around a root cellar
[39:27.800 --> 39:31.080]  that we installed on my friend's homestead
[39:31.080 --> 39:36.080]  and a big orchard and like berry plantings around ponds.
[39:36.760 --> 39:41.760]  And I know because I'm confident in like the installation
[39:42.920 --> 39:45.280]  that those things are going to thrive into the future.
[39:45.280 --> 39:48.480]  Like that's the feel good posterity work
[39:48.480 --> 39:51.200]  that I've always been searching for in life.
[39:52.880 --> 39:57.880]  And like, it has to be tied back into a community
[40:00.760 --> 40:03.680]  for it to be permaculture, right?
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.520]  Rooted, right?
[40:04.520 --> 40:06.200]  You have to have those roots.
[40:06.200 --> 40:07.040]  Yeah.
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.320]  And you know, I think that's so ironic, man.
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.200]  Like, you guys know me,
[40:11.200 --> 40:13.440]  you guys know what I'm about, natural farming.
[40:13.440 --> 40:15.960]  And for that to happen, like right out,
[40:15.960 --> 40:17.840]  you know, footsteps from my property
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.080]  where if, you know, in any situation
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.360]  if that person ever needed help,
[40:23.360 --> 40:24.840]  he could come to me for shelter.
[40:24.840 --> 40:25.680]  You know what I'm saying?
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.320]  And it's just ironic that for that to happen right there
[40:29.320 --> 40:32.760]  at a place where whatever you need, what do you need, bro?
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.720]  I got you, you know, I would help you.
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.480]  So that's tough, man, bridging the gap.
[40:37.480 --> 40:40.000]  And I think this is kind of funny.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.160]  I always, I use my wife for a lot of references,
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.320]  but she said this, she said, bring a giraffe to the hood.
[40:46.360 --> 40:50.240]  Do you want, no thug, there won't be no thug in anybody
[40:50.240 --> 40:53.880]  because she said, everybody will be like, wow.
[40:53.880 --> 40:54.720]  You know what I mean?
[40:54.720 --> 40:57.280]  Like, so not necessarily bringing that animal there,
[40:57.280 --> 40:59.760]  but do y'all get the mindset there, you know,
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.960]  you have to give them something kind of shocking in a way
[41:03.960 --> 41:06.000]  and also that's gonna pull them in
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.120]  and you know, something on that, on those lines.
[41:10.280 --> 41:11.720]  Yeah, I hear that.
[41:11.720 --> 41:14.800]  You know, it's, I've, I think personally,
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.880]  I've been waiting for an invitation and, you know,
[41:19.880 --> 41:23.840]  to circles, to places, to go do things.
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.520]  And kind of the invitations haven't really come
[41:28.520 --> 41:30.840]  in the sense of like, people don't wanna go outside
[41:30.840 --> 41:31.840]  of their comfort zone, you know,
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.240]  like change, big change doesn't happen easily.
[41:35.240 --> 41:39.880]  So I think it's important to kind of straddle that line
[41:39.880 --> 41:44.240]  of like being kind of pushy about like, you know,
[41:44.680 --> 41:46.080]  like guerrilla growing and stuff like that.
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.880]  Like throwing fruit and flower seeds,
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.600]  like all over the, you know, like highway sides
[41:54.600 --> 41:55.840]  and stuff like this, side of the freeway
[41:55.840 --> 41:56.840]  and stuff like that.
[41:58.760 --> 42:03.680]  But also like having the real, having a real impact
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.160]  like of like the education, you know, like that's,
[42:08.160 --> 42:10.320]  and that's why I respect you so much Marco
[42:10.320 --> 42:13.760]  is that you have events that people are learning
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.080]  about indigenous microorganisms, you know, like,
[42:17.080 --> 42:19.320]  I mean, shit, I can't imagine how many people
[42:19.320 --> 42:22.480]  you just turned on to that phrase, you know,
[42:22.480 --> 42:25.800]  like, which is important because indigenous,
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.240]  like we all have microorganisms around us
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.720]  that we can work with.
[42:30.720 --> 42:33.360]  And like, it's those like little grains,
[42:33.360 --> 42:36.160]  like those shit and other, they're gold bars, you know,
[42:36.160 --> 42:38.400]  like when you learn stuff like that,
[42:38.400 --> 42:43.280]  that gets anybody inspired to go do it themselves.
[42:43.800 --> 42:46.960]  And I think ultimately that's what we're after, right?
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.720]  Like not trying to do it yourself,
[42:50.720 --> 42:52.520]  trying to plug other people in
[42:52.520 --> 42:54.840]  and bring people up with you, right?
[42:54.840 --> 42:56.960]  And I got to the point kind of where,
[42:56.960 --> 42:59.360]  and I see this is someone's, this is your IG, okay.
[42:59.360 --> 43:00.880]  That's mine, yeah, that's me.
[43:00.880 --> 43:02.480]  And I kind of got to the point where I'm like,
[43:02.480 --> 43:04.800]  well, you know, I'm not gonna have a class.
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.440]  Maybe people aren't even feeling it,
[43:06.440 --> 43:08.200]  it's not worth it or whatever.
[43:08.200 --> 43:10.280]  But man, even with you just saying that,
[43:10.280 --> 43:12.040]  and I've had several people hit me up,
[43:12.040 --> 43:13.640]  it's been a year since I had one.
[43:13.640 --> 43:15.680]  I think I should have another one, man.
[43:15.680 --> 43:17.600]  And maybe we should link up and do one,
[43:17.600 --> 43:18.440]  you know what I mean?
[43:18.440 --> 43:21.760]  Have some more like-minded heads in the same place.
[43:21.760 --> 43:23.640]  And I'd love to do that down in my place
[43:23.640 --> 43:25.280]  so we can talk about it offline,
[43:25.280 --> 43:27.320]  but I think that'd be great.
[43:27.320 --> 43:28.240]  Yeah, that's great.
[43:28.240 --> 43:30.760]  I mean, honestly, I can say like,
[43:30.760 --> 43:32.560]  look forward into the future,
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.080]  more class offerings coming from me and my community,
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.360]  people up here, Pete, absolutely.
[43:39.200 --> 43:41.640]  Southeast Pennsylvania is like popping off
[43:41.640 --> 43:43.960]  with inspiration right now.
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.600]  There's the Keystone Tree Crop Co-op,
[43:47.960 --> 43:52.400]  and the Mushroom Network is just,
[43:52.400 --> 43:55.000]  there's foragers galore around here.
[43:56.640 --> 43:59.440]  The excitement is really like palatable.
[43:59.440 --> 44:02.600]  And I really am feeling like we just need
[44:02.600 --> 44:06.640]  to have some more events to get people together
[44:08.400 --> 44:10.240]  even if it's just going to different people's properties
[44:10.240 --> 44:13.920]  to kind of just be like, hell yeah, keep it up, man.
[44:13.920 --> 44:15.120]  Like we're here for you.
[44:16.680 --> 44:19.920]  That's something that is definitely going to be happening
[44:19.920 --> 44:22.080]  more and more into the coming future.
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.960]  So yeah, definitely look forward to that.
[44:23.960 --> 44:25.120]  I look forward to working with y'all
[44:25.120 --> 44:29.640]  coming down to Virginia and yeah, anywhere.
[44:29.640 --> 44:31.160]  We can take it worldwide, man.
[44:32.360 --> 44:33.640]  It is worldwide.
[44:33.640 --> 44:35.360]  This is a worldwide show now.
[44:35.360 --> 44:36.200]  So I mean, it's-
[44:36.200 --> 44:37.440]  It was pretty cool.
[44:37.440 --> 44:39.960]  We were able to even last week interview somebody
[44:39.960 --> 44:42.640]  live from South Africa where he had like,
[44:43.840 --> 44:46.760]  planned blackouts during the day.
[44:46.760 --> 44:49.360]  So flowering would make him anxious.
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.400]  And I mean, all of the things we take for granted,
[44:53.400 --> 44:54.880]  on top of all the other stuff.
[44:54.880 --> 44:58.000]  So it's just really cool to see them.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.760]  I think the theme today I saw a lot was like,
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.280]  when people will, when there's a will,
[45:01.280 --> 45:03.200]  there's a way type thing.
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.040]  When people love to grow things
[45:05.040 --> 45:06.920]  and they want to take care of their family,
[45:07.400 --> 45:08.600]  I think that's the extra drive.
[45:08.600 --> 45:11.760]  And I noticed that you had kids there, Matt, as well.
[45:11.760 --> 45:14.720]  When there's somebody else depending on what you're doing,
[45:14.720 --> 45:15.560]  I don't know, man.
[45:15.560 --> 45:18.120]  There's just something to that when it's not just you.
[45:18.120 --> 45:19.400]  Like you can eat ramen,
[45:19.400 --> 45:21.560]  but you wouldn't want your kids to eat ramen.
[45:21.560 --> 45:24.280]  So there's just something changes in that.
[45:24.280 --> 45:26.920]  So shout out to you for-
[45:26.920 --> 45:28.440]  Here's a question that I wanted to actually add.
[45:28.440 --> 45:31.200]  I'll go with Pete, because Pete's over there quiet.
[45:31.200 --> 45:32.040]  And then I'll go-
[45:32.040 --> 45:33.920]  I love listening to Matt, man.
[45:33.920 --> 45:35.920]  I love, that's why I got Matt on here, bro.
[45:36.520 --> 45:39.440]  I wanted to put him on because he's just got such,
[45:39.440 --> 45:41.840]  and shout out to him for being an amazing dad too.
[45:41.840 --> 45:43.400]  He's got two beautiful kids.
[45:43.400 --> 45:44.240]  Awesome, dude.
[45:44.240 --> 45:45.080]  Best dad.
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.040]  We love you, Uncle Pete.
[45:47.040 --> 45:49.880]  So what gave you boys the courage to decide,
[45:49.880 --> 45:51.520]  you know what, I'm going to do this.
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.320]  I'm going to create my own business.
[45:56.700 --> 45:58.340]  Well, man, I got inspired.
[45:58.340 --> 45:59.540]  I'll speak first,
[45:59.540 --> 46:02.500]  because I've always been inspired by Matt.
[46:02.500 --> 46:04.980]  A few years ago, before I started this farm,
[46:05.020 --> 46:08.460]  I was four seasons working for this nonprofit.
[46:08.460 --> 46:11.380]  Before that, I had my own heirloom fruit
[46:11.380 --> 46:13.140]  and nut tree nursery business
[46:13.140 --> 46:16.100]  and did some small little edible landscapes for people.
[46:16.100 --> 46:18.100]  And also my former partner and I
[46:18.100 --> 46:20.460]  were managing another educational farm too.
[46:20.460 --> 46:21.300]  So I was doing a lot,
[46:21.300 --> 46:23.020]  had my hand in a lot of different things.
[46:23.020 --> 46:24.260]  So I've always just been about that.
[46:24.260 --> 46:27.900]  Yeah, I just wanted to not work for anybody else
[46:27.900 --> 46:31.700]  and figure it out myself and work with people like Matt
[46:31.700 --> 46:33.420]  and people like Marco and people like you
[46:33.460 --> 46:35.620]  that are inspired on the same level.
[46:37.060 --> 46:38.380]  So yeah, I've always had that spirit.
[46:38.380 --> 46:40.860]  And then, you know, I went through some life changes
[46:40.860 --> 46:42.100]  and left Virginia for a minute
[46:42.100 --> 46:43.980]  and Matt was about to leave California.
[46:43.980 --> 46:46.780]  So I went and just hopped out and camped around
[46:46.780 --> 46:48.540]  and checked out some of his friends' farms
[46:48.540 --> 46:50.660]  and just like got my hands dirty learning
[46:50.660 --> 46:53.380]  from some of the best growers how to grow cannabis
[46:53.380 --> 46:55.100]  just for a little bit, kind of checking it out.
[46:55.100 --> 46:57.540]  And I wanted to get that absorption
[46:57.540 --> 46:59.060]  while he was out there with all these people
[46:59.060 --> 47:01.100]  that he had built this network with over the years
[47:01.100 --> 47:04.780]  and just see how my farm experience
[47:04.780 --> 47:05.740]  that I'd built over the years
[47:05.740 --> 47:07.740]  could then one day be applied to cannabis.
[47:07.740 --> 47:11.580]  And it was, you know, pretty much same thing,
[47:11.580 --> 47:13.940]  just growing and connecting with the soil
[47:13.940 --> 47:17.800]  and doing all the right simple practices to make it work.
[47:18.820 --> 47:20.860]  Hopefully Matt can come back on there.
[47:20.860 --> 47:23.940]  But yeah, man, so I went and briefly visited him
[47:23.940 --> 47:26.700]  and then came back from Virginia and then started working
[47:26.700 --> 47:29.060]  and, you know, did my own thing for a little bit.
[47:29.100 --> 47:31.540]  But yeah, Matt really has also inspired me
[47:31.540 --> 47:33.320]  at a lot of different points throughout the years
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.940]  where we've both just been sort of a little bit tired
[47:35.940 --> 47:36.940]  of working for somebody else
[47:36.940 --> 47:39.340]  and just check in with each other and lift each other up
[47:39.340 --> 47:40.980]  and say, yo man, like keep going.
[47:42.020 --> 47:43.560]  You know, he was working a really hard job
[47:43.560 --> 47:45.100]  with that excavation company for years,
[47:45.100 --> 47:47.360]  building that skillset that he can now build these ponds
[47:47.360 --> 47:48.620]  and build swales.
[47:48.620 --> 47:51.060]  And he was able to provide for his family and save,
[47:51.060 --> 47:53.740]  you know, so he's just living from the heart
[47:53.740 --> 47:54.940]  and puts that work in.
[47:56.020 --> 47:58.300]  So yeah, it's been really good to have that friendship,
[47:58.860 --> 48:00.540]  hopefully everybody can have a friend like that
[48:00.540 --> 48:03.460]  that they can bounce stuff off like that on that level.
[48:03.460 --> 48:04.580]  Through all the challenges, man,
[48:04.580 --> 48:08.060]  we went through some dark stuff and back out together
[48:08.060 --> 48:09.800]  and still best friends.
[48:09.800 --> 48:10.980]  So I think that's really important.
[48:10.980 --> 48:13.180]  Just like keep with people, you know,
[48:13.180 --> 48:14.780]  support them through whatever they're going through.
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.460]  That's really important.
[48:16.460 --> 48:18.980]  But yeah, Matt jumped off this year
[48:18.980 --> 48:22.240]  and I was kind of feeling like I was ready for a change
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.820]  and ready to get back into doing my own thing.
[48:24.820 --> 48:26.060]  You know, I had a really great experience
[48:26.060 --> 48:26.920]  working for this farm.
[48:26.920 --> 48:29.040]  It was nothing bad leaving it.
[48:29.040 --> 48:31.000]  It was just kind of time for me to jump off
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.640]  and do my own thing and left the farm
[48:33.640 --> 48:35.360]  in the hands of this really awesome guy,
[48:35.360 --> 48:36.420]  shout out to Mitchell.
[48:37.600 --> 48:39.920]  He's a great guy running things, holding it down there,
[48:39.920 --> 48:41.440]  holding down the natural farming,
[48:41.440 --> 48:44.520]  regenerative perspective, kind of keeping it going.
[48:44.520 --> 48:45.580]  And my pigs are still there.
[48:45.580 --> 48:47.840]  So I go hang out there every once in a while
[48:47.840 --> 48:49.900]  and check in on the pigs.
[48:49.900 --> 48:53.080]  But yeah, I left after, at the end of September
[48:53.080 --> 48:54.440]  and I've just been sort of,
[48:55.320 --> 48:57.280]  kind of just transitioning a little bit,
[48:58.200 --> 49:00.000]  restoring myself, farming is hard work.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.680]  And I definitely ran myself pretty ragged
[49:02.680 --> 49:05.280]  over like 10 years of more or less doing
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.240]  pretty much non-stop growing and hustling
[49:07.240 --> 49:10.880]  and just needed a minute to kind of reset myself.
[49:10.880 --> 49:13.280]  And now Matt and I are about to start, you know,
[49:13.280 --> 49:15.560]  hopping in on doing some collaborations together.
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.600]  I'm going up to help him on a project next week.
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.140]  And he's coming down to look at a cool project
[49:21.140 --> 49:23.580]  at a Buddhist temple that we're gonna, you know,
[49:23.580 --> 49:26.500]  help buff up their little chicken coop for the winter,
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.540]  do some projects there.
[49:27.540 --> 49:29.060]  Yeah, so we're just kind of starting out
[49:29.060 --> 49:31.100]  doing whatever we can, helping people that,
[49:31.100 --> 49:34.580]  again, are like-minded and with the vibe.
[49:34.580 --> 49:38.180]  So we're excited to just kind of see where it goes
[49:38.180 --> 49:39.700]  and definitely offer a lot of classes.
[49:39.700 --> 49:41.100]  That's what I feel most called to do,
[49:41.100 --> 49:44.820]  because we're happy to like get people started
[49:44.820 --> 49:47.000]  and do stuff and like put in initial work
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.500]  with our experience and our understanding
[49:48.500 --> 49:49.340]  of the whole system.
[49:49.340 --> 49:52.580]  But, you know, ultimately I really wanna see people,
[49:52.580 --> 49:54.420]  communities of people managing and growing
[49:54.420 --> 49:56.780]  and getting into it themselves, you know.
[49:56.780 --> 49:57.620]  It's too much work.
[49:57.620 --> 49:58.740]  It takes a village to farm.
[49:58.740 --> 50:01.140]  I was managing more or less close to five acres
[50:01.140 --> 50:03.500]  of vegetables with two to three people
[50:03.500 --> 50:04.480]  and then some volunteers.
[50:04.480 --> 50:06.300]  And it was a tremendous amount of work, man.
[50:06.300 --> 50:09.220]  It was just, we grew close to 100,000 pounds
[50:09.220 --> 50:10.060]  over the last few years.
[50:10.060 --> 50:11.460]  And, you know, it's a lot of work.
[50:11.460 --> 50:14.140]  So more and more people that get excited about it
[50:14.140 --> 50:16.520]  and wanna participate, that's what we need.
[50:16.520 --> 50:19.340]  So classes and making it fun too.
[50:19.340 --> 50:21.060]  Like I wanna make really cool video series
[50:21.060 --> 50:22.620]  that's like watching a show,
[50:22.620 --> 50:25.880]  but you're learning about microbes on accident almost.
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.720]  You know what I mean?
[50:26.720 --> 50:29.300]  Just people who wouldn't even normally be inspired
[50:29.300 --> 50:32.260]  or geek out or look into this on their own.
[50:32.260 --> 50:35.100]  How do we reach a really, really wide audience with it?
[50:35.100 --> 50:37.900]  So that's kind of where I'm shifting my work
[50:37.900 --> 50:39.840]  and working with Matt and also trying to work
[50:39.840 --> 50:42.740]  with a compost company that's up here.
[50:42.740 --> 50:46.080]  Shout out to Key City Compost in Frederick, Maryland.
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.460]  I really just wanna help.
[50:47.460 --> 50:49.060]  They've got a ton of amazing compost.
[50:49.060 --> 50:50.540]  I wanna help them kind of figure out
[50:50.980 --> 50:52.300]  what to do with it all and get it in the hands
[50:52.300 --> 50:53.660]  of good farmers and good growers.
[50:53.660 --> 50:58.460]  And cause that's a real issue in the regenerative no-till
[50:58.460 --> 51:00.880]  kind of larger scale farm thing is getting access
[51:00.880 --> 51:03.220]  to enough good quality compost,
[51:03.220 --> 51:05.660]  enough extra ingredients to kind of keep adding
[51:05.660 --> 51:08.100]  and keep boosting your system
[51:08.100 --> 51:11.140]  while you're getting it started as opposed to tillage
[51:11.140 --> 51:13.020]  and just keeping depleting everything.
[51:13.020 --> 51:13.860]  So yeah, got it.
[51:13.860 --> 51:14.700]  Got my head.
[51:14.700 --> 51:15.980]  That's a good bar right there,
[51:15.980 --> 51:17.720]  especially on a smaller property
[51:17.720 --> 51:19.660]  when you don't have a lot to start with.
[51:19.660 --> 51:21.260]  You gotta make sure whatever you bring in
[51:21.260 --> 51:23.460]  needs to be the best quality.
[51:23.460 --> 51:24.300]  Absolutely.
[51:25.220 --> 51:26.260]  Yeah, yep.
[51:27.420 --> 51:29.500]  So yeah, man, if that answers your question,
[51:29.500 --> 51:31.680]  I kind of maybe veered from it a little bit,
[51:31.680 --> 51:32.980]  but something about, you know,
[51:32.980 --> 51:35.060]  that maybe the courage to jump off on your own,
[51:35.060 --> 51:36.220]  I think is what you started.
[51:36.220 --> 51:38.940]  I got a little bit to tag on on the same thing.
[51:38.940 --> 51:41.540]  Now, did you have a little support to help you
[51:41.540 --> 51:44.260]  or did you kind of prepare and say, all right,
[51:44.260 --> 51:46.340]  you know, even talking to your significant other,
[51:46.340 --> 51:48.100]  all right, next year we're gonna make that move.
[51:48.100 --> 51:49.600]  Like, what was that process?
[51:50.540 --> 51:51.560]  Like, or did you just wake up one day and say,
[51:51.560 --> 51:54.880]  all right, this is it, you know, we're kind of going?
[51:54.880 --> 51:57.080]  Yeah, that's a great question, man.
[51:57.080 --> 51:59.220]  I mean, I wasn't fully like financially ready.
[51:59.220 --> 52:01.080]  I'm still having to like scrap some things together
[52:01.080 --> 52:03.360]  to make it work, but I'm okay.
[52:03.360 --> 52:05.320]  And thankfully I'm in a really good situation
[52:05.320 --> 52:06.840]  where I have a good community where I live.
[52:06.840 --> 52:10.440]  I grew up here, like I'm good friends with my landlord,
[52:10.440 --> 52:13.160]  who's, you know, in line with all the things
[52:13.160 --> 52:14.580]  we're talking about, really inspired, you know,
[52:14.580 --> 52:15.720]  inspired by Regenerative Ag.
[52:15.720 --> 52:17.320]  You know, so I have a great community
[52:17.320 --> 52:20.040]  where if I decide to do something, I do feel supported.
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.960]  And I'm really, really grateful for that.
[52:21.960 --> 52:23.320]  I know not everyone has that.
[52:23.320 --> 52:26.040]  So I can't imagine how hard it would be
[52:26.040 --> 52:29.000]  and how much extra like work and things
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.980]  you'd have to overcome to take those extra steps.
[52:30.980 --> 52:32.320]  So I have a lot of respect for people
[52:32.320 --> 52:34.940]  who don't have that support and take those steps.
[52:34.940 --> 52:37.400]  But yeah, I was really blessed and fortunate, man.
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.160]  So I've, my parents are amazing people too.
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.740]  Super, just the best of the best people.
[52:43.740 --> 52:46.880]  And when I've been a broke farmer, really,
[52:47.400 --> 52:48.280]  which has been most of the last few years,
[52:48.280 --> 52:49.960]  just working on vegetable farms and learning
[52:49.960 --> 52:52.280]  and just doing it more for the education
[52:52.280 --> 52:54.760]  than really than for the money,
[52:54.760 --> 52:57.460]  because I knew that was more worthwhile.
[52:57.460 --> 53:00.400]  And anyway, my parents let me live at home
[53:00.400 --> 53:01.520]  when I couldn't afford anywhere else.
[53:01.520 --> 53:03.120]  And I'm grateful for that, you know,
[53:03.120 --> 53:05.920]  and if you can do that, if you have the support,
[53:05.920 --> 53:08.400]  you know, to pursue part of your dream,
[53:08.400 --> 53:10.600]  if that's part of your step, I think that's okay.
[53:10.600 --> 53:11.800]  You know, it worked out really well for me
[53:11.800 --> 53:13.400]  and I'm really grateful.
[53:13.400 --> 53:16.400]  Yeah, I recommend that too, if you can stay at home
[53:16.920 --> 53:17.920]  a little while when you're in your twenties,
[53:17.920 --> 53:21.260]  I know I just probably sounds old to you guys,
[53:21.260 --> 53:24.440]  but I didn't move out till I was after college.
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.280]  You know what I mean?
[53:25.280 --> 53:27.160]  I went back home and then I bought my first house
[53:27.160 --> 53:29.200]  when I was 27, you know what I mean?
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.960]  But that's when I moved out, you know what I mean?
[53:30.960 --> 53:33.240]  So if you, when you move out, try to make a good move
[53:33.240 --> 53:35.180]  and stay there as long as you can,
[53:35.180 --> 53:38.160]  because I was living at home for those couple of years
[53:38.160 --> 53:40.860]  and making really good money and able to save.
[53:40.860 --> 53:42.560]  And then when I did buy a house, you know,
[53:42.560 --> 53:43.880]  it was a big move for me.
[53:43.880 --> 53:45.960]  So I had some support too,
[53:45.960 --> 53:48.240]  but I also made kind of my own bed, you know,
[53:48.240 --> 53:50.520]  you kind of got to work with what you got.
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.400]  If you can be cool at home, help out at home and stay there,
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.080]  try to stack your chips, you know what I mean?
[53:56.080 --> 53:57.680]  If you can, and then when you make that move,
[53:57.680 --> 53:59.400]  you're a lot, a lot stronger,
[53:59.400 --> 54:02.320]  can make better moves after that.
[54:02.320 --> 54:03.160]  100%.
[54:04.960 --> 54:06.920]  Well, I guess same question to you, Matt.
[54:06.920 --> 54:11.220]  What got you on that trajectory getting out on your own?
[54:11.540 --> 54:15.940]  Yeah, I knew I was always going to work for myself
[54:15.940 --> 54:20.260]  at some point, like I've tried lots of different
[54:20.260 --> 54:24.140]  entrepreneurial pursuits throughout my life.
[54:24.140 --> 54:29.020]  I mean, it was like hustling fish shirts on fish lot
[54:29.020 --> 54:31.300]  as a teenager and shit like that.
[54:31.300 --> 54:34.900]  So I've always been trying to do something,
[54:34.900 --> 54:37.740]  but after I had my first kid,
[54:37.740 --> 54:39.900]  kind of realized that like I needed to make money
[54:39.900 --> 54:42.340]  for a family, you know, like besides myself,
[54:42.340 --> 54:46.780]  even if jobs made me miserable or something like that,
[54:47.820 --> 54:48.900]  if they weren't ideal.
[54:48.900 --> 54:53.900]  So I started, yeah, I was working construction for a while
[54:55.620 --> 54:59.100]  and, you know, like my ethos weren't totally aligned
[54:59.100 --> 55:01.580]  with the company, nothing like that.
[55:01.580 --> 55:03.460]  Had to do some compromising things,
[55:03.460 --> 55:08.460]  but the single incident that like really made me be like,
[55:08.540 --> 55:09.820]  oh, I'm jumping, I'm doing my own thing.
[55:10.660 --> 55:13.500]  I'm getting out of here is the birth of my daughter,
[55:13.500 --> 55:14.700]  my second child.
[55:15.700 --> 55:19.540]  When she was born, it's like, everyone was like,
[55:20.660 --> 55:21.940]  what, you want off?
[55:21.940 --> 55:25.620]  You want to take days off of work for your baby being born?
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.220]  Like what, why?
[55:27.220 --> 55:29.060]  And I was like, are you fucking like,
[55:30.060 --> 55:32.300]  the lack of support, you know, I was like,
[55:32.300 --> 55:36.180]  oh, like I need to change this.
[55:36.180 --> 55:38.460]  And I was also kind of just like beat down
[55:38.460 --> 55:42.900]  and I didn't want my children to see their father grow up,
[55:42.900 --> 55:45.020]  coming home from work, kicking off his boots
[55:45.020 --> 55:47.380]  and just being like, you know,
[55:47.380 --> 55:50.380]  like, because I know that I have that spark inside me
[55:50.380 --> 55:53.060]  and that passion and like, I have a lot to share, man.
[55:53.060 --> 55:54.820]  Like we had this beautiful homestead
[55:54.820 --> 55:56.860]  and I wasn't able to give it the attention
[55:56.860 --> 55:58.020]  that I wanted to.
[55:58.980 --> 56:02.180]  And that's all been part of jumping off too,
[56:02.180 --> 56:03.580]  is like my family's health.
[56:05.220 --> 56:07.300]  Being able to be here for my kids a lot more
[56:07.300 --> 56:11.140]  and my wife and the property, you know,
[56:11.140 --> 56:14.820]  like the trees are thriving now.
[56:14.820 --> 56:19.820]  Like I guess I'm just happy and blessed, honestly.
[56:19.820 --> 56:22.220]  Like I feel really grateful.
[56:22.220 --> 56:24.620]  I mean, but the construction job that I was working,
[56:24.620 --> 56:29.620]  like it was all prevailing wage government work.
[56:30.100 --> 56:30.940]  So-
[56:30.940 --> 56:31.780]  What were y'all doing?
[56:31.780 --> 56:34.060]  So like utilities?
[56:34.060 --> 56:38.500]  Yeah, I was a pipe player doing like water main,
[56:38.500 --> 56:42.300]  sewer main, storm drains and stuff like that,
[56:42.300 --> 56:44.500]  all for like municipalities and townships.
[56:45.940 --> 56:48.380]  So they're all like multimillion dollar jobs and stuff.
[56:48.380 --> 56:52.380]  But I really saw how, you know,
[56:52.380 --> 56:53.420]  you're in it for long enough
[56:53.420 --> 56:55.820]  and you just see how all the pieces move.
[56:55.820 --> 56:59.100]  And I was like, man, I wanna be working
[56:59.100 --> 57:02.340]  with like big piles of inoculated wood chips.
[57:02.380 --> 57:05.260]  And like, I wanna be installing fruit trees,
[57:05.260 --> 57:07.660]  not plastic pipes in the ground, you know?
[57:07.660 --> 57:09.660]  Like if I'm busting my knuckles,
[57:09.660 --> 57:12.540]  like I want it to be like for, you know,
[57:12.540 --> 57:16.380]  a root cellar that's gonna last for hundreds of years,
[57:16.380 --> 57:19.100]  preserving food and making a family thrive
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.660]  and stuff like that.
[57:20.660 --> 57:22.180]  So all that was the motivation.
[57:22.180 --> 57:25.100]  And man, like Pete was saying, having a friend like Pete,
[57:25.100 --> 57:28.300]  like always being able to balance his ideas or like,
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.700]  you know, I live up in Pennsylvania, he lives in Virginia.
[57:30.700 --> 57:32.900]  So we were like three hours away or so.
[57:32.900 --> 57:35.180]  But like, we always make the effort to get together
[57:35.180 --> 57:36.780]  like once a month or so, our families.
[57:36.780 --> 57:40.740]  And you know, like he's a real good reflection
[57:40.740 --> 57:43.140]  of myself in this way where like,
[57:43.140 --> 57:44.700]  I wouldn't know how miserable I was
[57:44.700 --> 57:46.580]  because of getting beat down from work
[57:46.580 --> 57:47.420]  or something like that.
[57:47.420 --> 57:48.500]  But when I would show up, he'd be like,
[57:48.500 --> 57:50.380]  damn dude, like, you okay?
[57:50.380 --> 57:51.500]  You know, like I'm here for you.
[57:51.500 --> 57:54.580]  Like, you remember those dreams like we have?
[57:54.580 --> 57:56.660]  Like, we're gonna do it, you know?
[57:56.660 --> 57:58.820]  And like, it's pretty wild,
[57:58.820 --> 58:01.460]  like to have a friendship like that for 10 years
[58:01.460 --> 58:05.380]  and it constantly be like progressive
[58:05.380 --> 58:08.220]  and actually like, you know,
[58:08.220 --> 58:10.620]  somebody who helps you achieve your goals
[58:10.620 --> 58:11.580]  and something like that.
[58:11.580 --> 58:16.580]  So that's, you know, how I had the courage to jump off
[58:17.020 --> 58:20.260]  and a super supporting, loving family as well, no doubt.
[58:20.260 --> 58:23.940]  Like, you know, I got people around me saying like,
[58:23.940 --> 58:27.180]  shit, we'll support you no matter what you do.
[58:27.180 --> 58:30.060]  So that's how important too.
[58:30.980 --> 58:33.260]  That goes back to your character though too.
[58:34.540 --> 58:36.500]  It sounds like you guys call each other out
[58:36.500 --> 58:38.500]  on each other's bullshit,
[58:38.500 --> 58:41.060]  which I don't think enough friends do that enough,
[58:41.060 --> 58:43.180]  especially growing up in your early twenties and stuff.
[58:43.180 --> 58:45.460]  You know, you let the, you're going out with a homie
[58:45.460 --> 58:47.460]  and there's always some homie trying to fight everybody
[58:47.460 --> 58:48.300]  in the fucking town.
[58:48.300 --> 58:49.860]  You're like, dude, just chill out.
[58:49.860 --> 58:51.780]  So moving forward with that stuff,
[58:51.780 --> 58:53.940]  honestly, I mean, I'm not trying to bring in pop culture,
[58:53.940 --> 58:56.140]  but I think that's what like Kanye West
[58:56.180 --> 58:58.620]  doesn't have anybody that cares about him anymore.
[58:58.620 --> 59:01.420]  So he just sits around and just says wild ass shit.
[59:01.420 --> 59:03.860]  And I've seen that on a microcosm scale
[59:03.860 --> 59:05.980]  with sometimes with cannabis farmers.
[59:05.980 --> 59:08.060]  It's like, as soon as they become head grower,
[59:08.060 --> 59:09.860]  it's like they invented cannabis
[59:09.860 --> 59:11.460]  and all the people that helped them get there
[59:11.460 --> 59:14.380]  and all this kind of stuff, that goes all to the wayside.
[59:14.380 --> 59:17.260]  They, you know, start to believe their own bullshit
[59:17.260 --> 59:19.180]  in a way, and then they falter.
[59:19.180 --> 59:22.340]  So I think, you know, what you guys are talking about
[59:22.340 --> 59:26.020]  is not only continuing to focus on education,
[59:26.900 --> 59:29.580]  but you have to have somebody in your little private world
[59:29.580 --> 59:32.260]  where you can talk to them real, human to human.
[59:32.260 --> 59:34.260]  And they can be like, hey, I think that's a great move
[59:34.260 --> 59:36.340]  or hey, I think that's a stupid ass move.
[59:36.340 --> 59:38.140]  And if you don't have that person,
[59:38.140 --> 59:39.980]  you need to kind of find that person.
[59:41.380 --> 59:42.940]  You need to be that person.
[59:43.900 --> 59:44.940]  Yeah.
[59:44.940 --> 59:46.780]  That's tough if people don't give it back.
[59:46.780 --> 59:47.900]  Yeah, I know.
[59:47.900 --> 59:49.540]  That is an unhealthy relationship
[59:49.540 --> 59:51.580]  if you're the only one giving.
[59:51.580 --> 59:52.540]  Yeah, totally.
[59:52.540 --> 59:55.180]  I mean, and you do need to have people tell you
[59:55.820 --> 59:59.380]  that that's not a good idea sometimes, you know?
[59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.220]  Like, I mean, like, yeah, you gotta,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.860]  rather than just having people always prop you up and stuff,
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.460]  you know, and like fluff your ideas and shit.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.820]  Like you just gotta, it's really nice to have
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.220]  like real people around you that are like,
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.700]  ah, what's the practicality of like, you know,
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.980]  planting that many variety of something,
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:21.820]  you know what I mean?
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.020]  Like, oh, isn't that kind of getting like monocultury
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.860]  or something like that?
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.540]  I really appreciate challenging perspectives.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.500]  Yeah, like my wife Shannon, she's amazing.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.300]  But like every time I have an idea,
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.540]  she will like tease it apart.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.660]  And I know now that it's to be productive,
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.140]  like so that I'm not wasting time on like wild ass ideas,
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.180]  you know?
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.180]  And so I've really learned to like throw out ideas
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.260]  as like, you know, and see what sticks kind of shit.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.620]  Like, and like, I know not everything's good,
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:05.220]  but I think staying inspired is like half the battle
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.420]  a lot of times, you know?
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.140]  Like, so even if one idea doesn't work out,
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.300]  like keep it going, you know?
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.140]  Like inoculate another type of wood chips,
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.700]  like work with a different strain of mushrooms,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.660]  like try a different type of cannabis, you know?
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:21.660]  Like whatever, like, or like a different style of growing,
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.300]  like, man, I think a lot of times people get beat up
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.780]  about having a failed run to bring it back to cannabis,
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.340]  you know, like home growers.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.060]  I seen a lot of people just like throwing the towel
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.300]  completely because of a failed run.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.220]  And it's just like diversifying,
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.340]  just diversifying the grow methods and stuff.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.900]  And I think that's where the microbes come in.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.980]  And that's where like, we're gonna be able to find people
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.380]  who are growing anything are attracted to this community
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:03.140]  of living soil, of, you know,
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.460]  yeah, really living soil and regenerative farming.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.820]  Like, it doesn't matter if it's,
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.580]  like cannabis doesn't have to be its own cultivation,
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.660]  like this school of cultivation, you know?
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.660]  Like those methods apply across the board more or less.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.140]  Yeah, that's from a room in Trinidad.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:25.260]  I wanted to tactfully ask you if,
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.780]  so what is all going on here?
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.740]  Like when you're,
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.340]  cause that was something that I noticed
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.420]  when Marco was saying, hey, here are our guests.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.340]  And I was talking to obviously Ken behind the scenes.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.340]  So it's really hard for individuals to get their plants,
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.020]  especially younger to look like that
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.540]  because they have a lot of deficiencies
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.860]  when they're first starting out.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.140]  So how are you building up your soil systems?
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.460]  Well, start with a good base.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.820]  I mean, honestly out there in Humble,
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.500]  Soilscape Solutions is like top to bottom
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.820]  will just like get you good.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.060]  Like they will give you a base and an amendment
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.300]  like for where you are, like what region you are
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.100]  or like indoor or like, you know,
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.620]  they really cater it to you.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.940]  So it's built with all types of good,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.020]  like humic, fulvic and, you know,
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:21.340]  like meals, you know, from crustaceans and whatever.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.220]  I'm not sure what their exact blends for their,
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.740]  like what they are.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.620]  But I think that I have some pictures back,
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.140]  like when I was amending the greenhouses outside
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.260]  of the bags.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:39.140]  So it was, the soil was Soilscape Solutions
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.940]  base mix and amendments.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:47.940]  And then for that particular indoor,
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.140]  I'm not proud to say, but you did ask,
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.220]  there was some cutting edge solutions,
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.220]  like micros, like Uncle John's blend
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:02.220]  or some shit like that, which like ended up like,
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.900]  yeah, it was like a pseudo,
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.140]  it was a pseudo organic, like grow that
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.620]  actually didn't end up yielding super well
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:14.580]  because of so many different variables going into it.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.140]  Like it was, you know,
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:18.980]  to me,
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.820]  So we're on the same page.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.740]  You're talking about the older gentleman.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.980]  He's always at all the expos talking cutting edge solutions,
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.820]  I believe is his.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.700]  His name is Uncle John or whatever.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.540]  He's a good dude.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.060]  And like, if, you know, if people grow an indoor
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.940]  and salts, like whatever, I'm not into it.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.300]  It's not the thing, but like they do,
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.100]  they haven't really dialed in as far as like user friendly
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.620]  and just like results will come out.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.460]  So I just, I know that their products
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.380]  are like tried and true.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.580]  I got a homie that's a rep of them, but generally,
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.700]  I mean, anytime that I have been able to control the inputs,
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.500]  it's been organic through and through,
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.260]  which is really easy to source good materials.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.580]  Yeah, that's a photo.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.420]  That's a beautiful photo.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.620]  So now, oh yeah, so that, yeah.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.380]  So that those outdoor greenhouses,
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.900]  I'm pretty sure that one to the right is all seed starts
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.420]  and to the left were all clones, I think.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:17.380]  And yeah, I mean like, so that was kind of like
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.820]  a collaboration with a homie who had a couple of spots
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.020]  and we were just popping a whole bunch of different stuff
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.140]  that we were interested in, a whole lot of seed starts.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.660]  I ran seed junkies ice cream cake
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.420]  before it was like named ice cream cake.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.780]  Like I just knew that one was gonna be hot.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:39.500]  It was like, you know, gelato and wedding cake, like the,
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.780]  and then also ran a whole bunch of stuff
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.500]  from Humboldt seed company because they're the homies
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.460]  and like their shit like gets fat and yields.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.540]  And the blueberry muffin is like stanky and greasy,
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.380]  super unique.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.420]  Like it, one of them smells like baby shit
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.980]  and the other one smells like fake ass blueberries.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.540]  So really it was just like, you know,
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.940]  like the price per pound was tanking so hard
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.700]  that's like during those years
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.340]  that was really unpredictable.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.340]  Scott, that's my voice guy.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.700]  It was really unpredictable, like what the outcome,
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.220]  what people were gonna want, what was gonna sell for what.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.500]  So we were kind of just like, let's grow a little bit
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.020]  for what we're just a little bit of to learn
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:29.420]  like about all the different genetics that we've been into
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.140]  but haven't been able to grow yet.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.100]  And also like to really do a lot of recreations
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.260]  of other strains and stuff that we've already grown
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.220]  and just that we know rock out, you know,
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.780]  and people will want kind of thing.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.100]  But man, at this point it was so like,
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.700]  I forget what year this was, 2017, 18, I forget.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:55.020]  But like.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.460]  Looks like 18, August of 18.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.300]  Yeah.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.660]  August of 2018, yeah.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.660]  Facebook never forgets Matt.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.580]  Right, just me.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.300]  You know, like a lot of people were starting
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300]  to want fresh frozen that year
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.060]  and like purple weed wasn't cool yet.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.300]  And, but like we grew a bunch of purple wheat
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.460]  and like, so it was all that that was going on
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.180]  was like for fun, low input,
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.420]  as far as like into the soils and stuff.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.460]  We were brewing a lot of compost tea that year.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.220]  I don't really brew compost tea anymore
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.700]  because like, it's just like so many hours
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.100]  of cleaning your tanks and shit.
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:37.660]  But we were using like a really cool vortex brewer
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.820]  and yeah, doing a lot of nice like IPM sprays
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.380]  with the atomizer.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.820]  Atomizer, yeah.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.580]  Yeah, boy, that's old school shit.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.660]  Yeah, right.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:53.180]  The shape of those things is like ridiculous
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.220]  to try to lug through a greenhouse like that.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.620]  And then they eventually, the suction wears out
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.540]  and it'll just fall
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.300]  and all your shit will splatter everywhere.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.780]  Correct, correct.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.500]  I know Petro Tools really stepped it up from that.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.660]  But yeah, so like, you know, out in Humboldt.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.420]  So those were like my last year out there
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.420]  and I was, you know, invested in this property
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.580]  and we, it just didn't really work out for me, man.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.260]  Like the market, like just, it wasn't sustainable for like,
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.740]  I mean, there's a whole lot of nuances to it
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.900]  but like a lot of times you can't get rid of your products
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:41.100]  until like the following spring or summer
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.100]  and like investing into a farm and having a family then
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.660]  really just kinda like, I needed something more stable.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.260]  So that's when I like, I wrapped up everything.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.340]  I was like, you know what?
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.900]  The lessons that I'm learning, like I can take this.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.380]  Honestly, like it sounds lame to say it
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.180]  cause like everyone's like, oh, these guys.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.700]  But like, I can take all the information from Humboldt
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.300]  and take it to the East Coast and teach everyone
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:11.260]  because man, it's such an epicenter
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.780]  of information and knowledge.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.740]  And I mean, like, shoot, all the genetics
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.780]  I got to play with, like that's like super glue.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:23.220]  We had a couple of different, like we were doing OG trials.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:28.220]  Like we had 707 OG, Larry and what else?
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.020]  Side by side, I forget.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.820]  But like maybe it was Humboldt OG or something like that.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.820]  Like it was just like being able to soak up
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.740]  so much knowledge passively.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.140]  Like, and a part of me really wants to just preserve it
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.380]  into the future and teach everyone
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.180]  like the kind of some of the best methods
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.620]  that I've seen cultivating cannabis.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.700]  And I mean, all that's like, you know
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.860]  I'm living in Pennsylvania right now.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.820]  So all that like is on pause as far as the community
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.860]  really being able to come together.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.300]  But-
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.140]  Are you guys able to grow anything out there right now?
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.900]  Pennsylvania?
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.260]  Not legally, no.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.500]  Okay, so I didn't know.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.860]  I thought, cause I have a buddy
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.100]  that like works in a dispensary out there.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.340]  So what's y'all's deal?
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.460]  What's going on?
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.340]  It's just straight medical.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:24.420]  And you know, the majority of the production facilities
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.780]  are owned by like Canadian hedge fund investors
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.660]  or something.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.860]  Some of my comment and be like-
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.100]  Typical shit.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.100]  Yeah, but like it's the products on the shelf
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.460]  in the dispensary are disappointing.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.700]  It's not, if you've had like real quality medicine,
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.980]  organic, fresh medicine in your life,
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.100]  you know that that's not the best medicine
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.580]  when you get it, you know?
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:56.180]  Like it's dried too hot, like the terpenes bake out of it.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.660]  It's just a little too,
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.940]  it's like when genetics don't express their full potential,
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.180]  it's disappointing, you know, when you know better.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:12.180]  So, you know, honestly man, it's like,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.420]  who has the better quality right now?
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.340]  The black market does.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:22.140]  You can find your source better that way, you know?
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.700]  Find that gray area we always talk about.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.260]  Like, you know, I'm not trying to support
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.980]  the rich getting richer anyways, you know?
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.940]  Like I wanna find my local producer.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.020]  So I think that's what,
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.540]  it's coming back to your community, you know?
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:40.460]  Like your cannabis community.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.580]  I mean, a lot of people have come to
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:48.180]  regenerative agriculture or meditation
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.620]  or whatever like their beneficial,
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.900]  maybe like yoga or some shit through a cannabis community,
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.380]  you know, a couple of friends that they would smoke weed with
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.020]  and like, and talk about life.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.420]  So I think that like,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.420]  like fortifying a cannabis community in your area
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.460]  is like probably one of the most potent things
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.860]  that we can do, right?
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.980]  What do you think would be the best way?
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.420]  Have a little get together, start out like that,
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.660]  private gathering and let it kind of grow from there.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.300]  Yeah, I even think like,
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:28.420]  so there's a gross supply shop around the corner from here,
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.780]  AG Botanicals.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:34.580]  And it's just kind of like a hub for people to link up,
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.900]  you know, it's not like a lot of people getting together,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.620]  but like when you go in there
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.980]  and you're with other people in that space,
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.500]  like it's kind of a safe space for cannabis, you know,
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.740]  there's some unspoken things going on,
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.660]  even though it's all, everyone's just a gardener,
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.260]  you know what I mean?
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:56.260]  But that's, you know, finding like a physical location,
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.940]  like I've just been having so much more success
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.420]  like making lasting relationships,
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.300]  like physically going out and meeting people
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.100]  than I have any other way, you know?
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.340]  So yeah, I think, and also then like, you know,
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.420]  like I'm gonna say this with a caveat or whatever,
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.060]  like it's fucking not legal advice, but like, fuck it,
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.300]  like you're not getting arrested for like letting people
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.020]  know that you smoke weed, you know what I mean?
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.540]  Like you can tell people that you're fucking whatever
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.860]  and like hang out with people and smoke weed,
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.900]  like that's fine, that's cool.
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.780]  Like I think that we should renormalize that
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:41.140]  as opposed to being afraid of the legal repercussions.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:45.940]  That's actually the move is to buck up and do it anyway,
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:46.780]  you know what I mean?
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.060]  That's the move instead of, you know,
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.260]  yes, thanks for letting us smoke,
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.620]  but in a way, you know, fuck you, you know what I mean?
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.220]  Like fuck y'all, you know, like don't tell me
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:01.860]  what I can do on this property or whatever I pay for here.
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.340]  Like to me, we all know that's bullshit.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.380]  So I get a little, sometimes I'm like,
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.620]  I'm not gonna say thank you, you know, fuck that.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.940]  We should be doing that anyway.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.900]  That should already be part of it, so.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.540]  Yeah, so I mean, on that tip, I wanna plug one thing,
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.460]  which is the, what is it, decriminalized nature.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:26.300]  And for like, you know, into the future,
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.580]  like legalization may not have been the way,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.740]  like decriminalization probably would have been easier
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.380]  because it's just like, leave your hands out of it
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.180]  and what comes of it comes, you know what I mean?
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.340]  Like you're not gonna get arrested,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.220]  but like legalization comes with a whole bunch
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:45.220]  of requirements and like, so then all of a sudden
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.100]  to be able to grow this plant that's legal now,
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:52.020]  you have to fit into a box and-
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.860]  Or be illegal.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:54.700]  Or be illegal.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.460]  You go back to being illegal again, right?
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.660]  Right, right, right.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.500]  So it's like, I don't know, neither sides of those coins
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.780]  really work for most people, right?
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.700]  Like, they're totally beneficial.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.140]  I wanted to add something on that,
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.020]  just in kind of connecting with the people
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.980]  in your community who might be growing.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.820]  I, when cannabis first went legal in Virginia,
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:22.260]  I think it was July of following or previous year,
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:25.860]  I decided like a week heads up to put together
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.700]  a little intro to homegrown class, living soil talk
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.700]  at my friend's health food store.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.380]  And the customer base there is like, I had no idea.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.860]  I was kind of, I felt a little bit nervous,
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.300]  like putting myself out there, like homegrown cannabis talk.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.620]  I was like, one of the first people to do that
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.260]  and still had a job that was like, not, you know,
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.780]  about cannabis, we didn't talk about it really.
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.300]  So it was a little bit of putting myself out there,
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.580]  but I was just like, fuck it.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.980]  Like, it's legal now.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.980]  I'm sure there's people who wanna learn how to grow.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.820]  Like, let's try it out.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.460]  So held this little event.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.380]  I think like 30 people came.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.900]  It was like, you know, a few days heads up,
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.000]  30 people showed up, people you would never expect,
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.140]  like walking down the street that wanted to come learn
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.060]  how to grow their own weeds.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.060]  So it's just like, you never know who's hiding
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.980]  or who's got some plants in there.
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.220]  Like who was doing this before it was even, you know,
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.460]  it's like, it's a lot of diverse community
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.820]  that's in the growing and has been for a while.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.740]  So it's exciting to see kind of who comes out
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.380]  of the woodwork as these states change legalization.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.260]  Like Marco, man, I didn't, I first reached out to you,
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.680]  I think right when you started your cannabis profile.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.660]  And I didn't realize it was you at first.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.940]  I just kind of was like, man, who is this dude
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.980]  right off the bat growing like incredible weed
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.740]  with like Jadam and natural farm?
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.580]  Like I had no idea anybody was gonna be doing that
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.420]  in Virginia.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.240]  Like, you know.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.080]  Right off the gate.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:45.900]  Right off the gate, man.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.360]  I was like, yo, we should link up.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.200]  Like, that's so cool.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.260]  And then I finally pieced together.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.100]  I was like, oh shit.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.740]  I was like, damn dude.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.780]  And then I signed up as soon as you posted that class, man.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.380]  I was like, I have to be there.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.940]  I wanna meet the people, you know,
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.780]  that are also gonna come out of the woodwork.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.600]  And that was amazing.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.440]  And there's a lot of others.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.340]  A lot of them, man.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.180]  A lot of them.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.420]  People, again, people you would never expect
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.540]  that consume cannabis and other substances
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.420]  that they're curious about, you know.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.980]  Like people are interested.
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.720]  And I think we really do need to be the ones
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.300]  who aren't afraid to break the taboo culture
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.500]  and just be like, hey man, fuck it.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.300]  Like times are changed.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.700]  If you don't like it,
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.700]  you can sit in your corner and not like it.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.340]  But this is medicine, man.
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.180]  This is medicine.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.940]  And we're, you know, especially us living soil people,
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.820]  you know, we're not just in it for the cannabis.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.380]  We're in it for circling it all in
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.900]  with fruit and nut tree systems
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.780]  that really, really long-term build the soil
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:42.220]  that is gonna sustain five generations from now.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.180]  You know, that's what I get excited about.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.500]  So.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.340]  Yeah.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.860]  A lot of people talk about the nut trees too, man.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.220]  Like Michael was talking about them
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.060]  So why don't we kind of get into that?
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:56.660]  I mean, man, we're all in place anyway.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.500]  Let's do it, man.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.860]  I'm sure there's some people here
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.020]  who might be interested in nut trees, I hope, you know.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:01.860]  Heck yeah.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:02.700]  Yeah.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.940]  And also while we're in there,
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.780]  just working on through the rest of the shows,
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.020]  what slide into some of your type projects you do, Matt.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.100]  Like, you know, like if I'm a guy, I need a pond,
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.900]  you'll come out and help me do that.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.300]  Or, you know, hugel cultures, like things like that.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:20.860]  Are you doing any kind of straw bale structures
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.500]  or things like that?
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.380]  Yeah.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.420]  So a lot of what I do, like for work and like,
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.260]  you know, the contracts and stuff,
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.540]  it's mostly like a lot of residential stuff,
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.900]  like people setting up homesteads.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:40.740]  I work a lot with a permaculture designer.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:44.340]  His name's Adam Duesen at Hundred Fruit Farm.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:48.140]  And he does designs and he sends,
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.780]  he referenced me and sends them my way.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.780]  And when they don't want to do them themselves
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.100]  or it's too big, they need help.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:59.660]  I come in and I'll install the design.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.540]  Beyond that, then it's like other smaller projects
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.620]  that can help support a landscape.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.380]  Honestly, here in Pennsylvania,
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.380]  probably same thing down in Virginia.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.540]  The natural disaster that we have to prepare for
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:19.220]  before anything else is flooding, too much water.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.340]  Generally, that's like what's going to wipe you out,
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:24.740]  like a crop or something like that.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.140]  Or make a landscape unusable.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.140]  So managing water is a big aspect of what I do.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.460]  There's, you know, responsible
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.580]  and irresponsible ways of doing that.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.580]  So it's really important.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.100]  I think that a lot of the water projects I do are,
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.900]  some of the most important ones
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.780]  because they keep it out of the stream, you know,
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:59.060]  let it soak into the ground and have the soil
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.860]  and the microbial life and the fungi do the cleansing.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.460]  Because municipalities and cities,
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:13.460]  like it is a direct line in the biggest pipes possible
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.460]  straight to the creek, you know,
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.140]  picking up all the contaminants along the way.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:24.020]  So, yeah, like, you know, the way it would happen,
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:29.220]  like a lot of the edible landscaping that I do
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.140]  and the orchards and stuff are based off of designs.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.940]  And I'll get like, you know, the bird's eye view print of it
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:39.540]  and, you know, have to imprint it onto the land.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.620]  But if you were to be like a guy that called me up
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.420]  and were like, hey, I'm interested in, you know,
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.660]  fruit trees and come check out my property or whatever.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.060]  First thing I would do is come to your property
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:54.500]  and see what the actual physical landscape is like.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.980]  And a lot of times there's problems, like, you know,
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.980]  I noticed that there is water issues to address
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:06.980]  or just like unutilized resource really, you know,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.180]  like that's actually maybe causing damage,
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.140]  like erosion or like just pooling up,
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.900]  like settling somewhere, like that isn't a pond,
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.460]  but like, it's just like killing vegetation
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.140]  and they keep trying to grow vegetation over it,
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.220]  like stuff like that.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.020]  And, you know, it's like fun to come at it
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:34.020]  with a permaculture mindset because like,
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.820]  first of all, I'm always working with the landscape,
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.980]  it's different every project,
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.140]  but then it's like, I get to kind of impose
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.860]  like the will of nature a little bit
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.300]  as I'm trying to maybe like channel that.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:53.300]  Like, so like, you know, using like mycelium,
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.020]  like I'm trying to inoculate a lot of wood chips
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.500]  and use the wood chips to clean up like swales.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.580]  If like at the end of a swale,
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.460]  it comes to like a retention pond or something like that.
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.460]  Pete mentioned this chicken coop project
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.500]  that we're going to look at.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:14.500]  And we were talking about employing some IMO,
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.940]  I guess maybe it would be like some deep litter IMO four,
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.660]  and then like some like swales
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:24.820]  where we dig little trenches on contour to,
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.380]  in rain events, it would collect the water
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:30.060]  and shoo them out to little retention ponds,
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.380]  that little impressions in the landscape.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.540]  And we'd fill those up with wood chips
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.860]  that are also inoculated with maybe King Strafaria
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.460]  or oysters or something to kind of clean up
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.740]  the contamination of the manure.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.780]  So yeah, these are a lot of the physical projects.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:53.700]  Like it's generally, and like,
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.100]  this is something where like,
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.980]  I feel like I need help from the community
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:59.340]  where like I'm not a great photographer,
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.260]  I'm not good at recording the stuff that I do.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.180]  So in this pic right here, Matt, while we got it up.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.780]  So what was the issue here?
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.340]  Was this a low line area that stayed wet
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.020]  and then now you had to divert the water
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.820]  on down to that wood line?
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.820]  So this was like a five acre homestead,
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.820]  pretty close to like two hours north of Philadelphia,
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.980]  like an hour, hour 50, yeah.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.980]  And it had a lot of waters,
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:34.580]  like kind of in the middle of like a watershed
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.700]  where like all the properties uphill
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.860]  drain to a point right above this property.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.380]  So whenever it stormed,
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.540]  there was like sheet water coming through
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.460]  this like big grassy meadow.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:52.260]  And the homeowners, they wanted to have an orchard there,
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.380]  but it was just like too wet and like unpredictable.
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.340]  And like the water was just like, you know,
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.180]  picking up speed as it was going down,
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.860]  creating little channels and stuff.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:07.860]  So that, those swales and berms up there,
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.900]  that's like a key line system of swales
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:17.220]  that S down through the property.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.420]  Like you can, it's coming in from above right there
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:22.860]  and then it goes across and then all the way out there,
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.180]  it goes down and links back.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.380]  From right to left then,
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.660]  the water was coming from right, head and down.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.940]  Yeah, yeah, yup, yup, downhill there.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.700]  And then like, I mean, at the bottom,
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:36.140]  there's a huge mulch basin of Jerusalem artichokes
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:39.980]  and then like another basin of like ferns
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.180]  and stuff like that.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:43.660]  So it's really tying in.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:48.420]  It's like the focus is almost always
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:53.420]  how to have the land sustain itself into the future
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.900]  while also like sustaining human life,
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.580]  if that's your goal, you know what I mean?
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.620]  Like, especially on the residential projects,
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.780]  that's, it's almost always about food forests
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:05.220]  and edible landscaping and working with the property.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:10.220]  So, you know, like I'll have to say like,
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.500]  a lot of the stuff that I do, it's interesting
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.940]  because like, I don't know many other like permaculturalists
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.740]  that run machines as often as I do.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.700]  And it's kind of like a dilemma, you know, personally,
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.340]  but I always have to chalk it up to like net positive.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:31.220]  Like, is my impact gonna be net positive in the long run?
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:35.260]  And that's how I base every single decision that I make
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:38.140]  as far as bringing in a piece of equipment onto a property.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.980]  Like if I'm tracking over like a sensitive wetland
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.180]  or something to like, you know, put that swale in
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:47.300]  like we just saw, like I'm only tracking over it once,
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.620]  like while I'm digging it backwards, you know what I mean?
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:52.700]  And that's it, like not even like,
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.260]  so I put a lot more pressure on myself
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.340]  in these situations where I'm bringing machines
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.060]  onto people's property because I'm aware of the scrutiny
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.220]  that I'm under as a permaculture installation guy.
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:12.220]  But something that I refuse to do is rely on volunteer work
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.700]  because I want other people to come up
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.220]  and I wanna feed other people, you know,
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.340]  like I want people to be paid when they work with me.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.620]  And I think I could get some projects done
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.620]  by having like huge volunteer groups,
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:31.620]  but like, you know, it just, I'm 33 years old.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.940]  Like I'm trying to have a growing lasting impact
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:39.020]  for posterity, like now that I have children here,
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.060]  like I wanna leave them something.
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:46.060]  Like, and what I see myself leaving is physically fruit trees
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.180]  and food forest and plantations.
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.860]  Like John Hershey and like all these other people
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.860]  that have established, I mean, the native cultures,
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.460]  honestly, the indigenous people, like let's nod to that
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.780]  because they were the real gardeners of this,
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.740]  of this, of this country.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.580]  Yeah, don't think that that pawpaw patch
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.980]  that you stumbled upon was just an accident.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:10.780]  You know, people have been out there
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.940]  planting these delicious fruit for many years,
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.780]  you know what I mean?
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.620]  So.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.460]  No doubt.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.380]  I definitely agree with that.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.700]  And I like that idea, man.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.820]  It seems like there's just something about, you know,
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.660]  wanting to leave a tree behind.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:23.740]  I don't know.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.580]  Cause if you can respect an old tree, man,
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:29.900]  you can respect this guy that just planted one.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:33.660]  And hopefully that old tree makes it to an old age.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.420]  So I just think those are all just lifestyle things.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.020]  Much respect.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.060]  It's a legacy thing, I think too.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.460]  Like you're building something for your future family.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.580]  I like that.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.460]  Exactly, man.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.020]  Leaving them something to harvest,
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.220]  a whole bunch of pecans
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.140]  and they can get rich off harvesting nuts or whatever,
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.860]  or just eat well, you know, so.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.740]  Legit.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.580]  Tangible things.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.540]  So you said that you want to talk about nut trees.
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.540]  We should crack into that
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:03.140]  because that's a whole blossoming industry
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.540]  right here on the East Coast.
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.420]  I just attended a really cool nut fest up in New York.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.220]  And it was thrown by like
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.620]  the New York Nut Growers Association,
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.540]  maybe they go by something else.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.860]  But it's just a bunch of cool young folk
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:25.020]  that are invested in perennial agriculture
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:29.060]  and feel like that nuts are the way to,
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.740]  are the most viable option, you know?
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.860]  Like we have hickory trees growing everywhere around here,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.020]  walnuts everywhere, you know?
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.380]  And they're like an amazing food source.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.180]  Like I don't have to go into their nutritional density
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.020]  and all that stuff,
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.380]  but like beyond that, like, you know,
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.420]  we as humans have done a lot of deforestation.
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.060]  So planting trees is like, you know,
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.500]  a very beneficial thing to do.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.500]  And yeah, so like, it's what really excites me.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.380]  And like, I kind of got into the nut world backwards
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:10.980]  because I was trying to get into like mushrooms really deep.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:13.700]  And all of a sudden I was just like realizing
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:18.700]  that mushrooms are so connected to trees,
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.340]  nut trees especially in a way like oaks
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:28.340]  and hickories and beech and all these things.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.020]  But I mean, all the trees have
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.980]  mycorrhizal relationships and stuff.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.180]  But you know, it's like,
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.460]  if you start really getting into mushrooms,
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.300]  you go out into the forest and the first thing you do
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.580]  is you look at the trees.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.980]  And I'm looking at these trees and I'm like, oh my God,
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.300]  I'm looking for like a couple of mushrooms, hopefully,
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.780]  maybe, but like I'm stepping over mountains of acorns.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.020]  So not to mention that this oak tree
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.780]  is like hundreds of years old.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.620]  So like just have mad respect for it off the bat
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.620]  and just like, so yeah, yeah, nut trees.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.100]  They're like our greatest teachers,
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.260]  but also like our bridge into like a sustainable future,
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:07.060]  like in my humble opinion, you know,
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.260]  like to, you know, that they provide the habitat,
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.860]  the mulch, they provide oxygen,
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.660]  they bring water up from the depths.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.860]  And what's really wild is that like,
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:24.860]  there isn't a strong North American nut industry,
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.460]  especially like on the East Coast, you know?
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:31.180]  And like, it kind of stopped after,
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:34.460]  you know, we all know how prevalent
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.300]  the chestnuts used to be and whatnot.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.700]  But, you know, the indigenous people
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:42.740]  absolutely utilize all the nuts and the oaks
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.220]  and whatnot and like these proteins,
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:51.380]  the nuts that come from these trees are like so abundant.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:54.340]  It's like ridiculous that like, you know,
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.620]  we're trying so hard to grow fields full of annuals
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.420]  when like we're cutting down nut trees
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.660]  that are already doing it for us.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.460]  Like, so really what the push is right now
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.180]  is to get the industry established,
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:11.180]  to like connect all the dots from gatherers or producers
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:15.540]  to processors, to product makers, to consumer.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:18.900]  And like, there's a group called
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.460]  the Keystone Tree Crop Co-op.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.860]  I'll repeat that.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:27.500]  It's the Keystone Tree Crop Co-op, KTCC.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.140]  And it's a group of super motivated young farmers,
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:37.140]  naturalists, and just nuts that are really pushing
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.420]  the development of this industry.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.500]  And they just got a couple of grants.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.020]  Part of that, like, you know, $55 million
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.740]  shelling out of the regional, the agricultural things.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.700]  I don't know, I can't speak to that.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:55.700]  But, and they hit a crowdfunding goal
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:59.860]  to get a hickory nut press.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:02.700]  I'm pretty sure that's what the GoFundMe was for.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.540]  And so like the momentum's rolling, you know?
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:12.580]  Like in the people, like there's becoming the networks
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.460]  that are necessary to build this industry
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.780]  are all kind of falling into place.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:22.140]  So it ties all back into living soil
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:27.140]  because you can't grow nut trees like long-term
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.660]  with a heavy herbicide, pesticide use.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.060]  And you can't even do it short-term responsibly.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:40.380]  You can't do it one year responsibly in my humble opinion
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:45.100]  because you're polluting the microbiome in the watershed.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:50.100]  So as this industry comes up, it's being fostered
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:53.660]  by people that like really care about living soil
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.220]  and microbes and the interconnectedness
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.340]  of these other industries and the mushrooms
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.340]  that are gonna come alive in these orchards
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.940]  and all the wealth of the forest
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.860]  as you're going into the forest to collect these nuts.
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.940]  It's not only the nuts, you know, it's the mushrooms,
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.180]  it's the medicine plants, it's all these things.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:19.180]  And ultimately that act is like tying all that together.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.580]  I mean, having the industry, but being part of it
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:27.420]  is what like feels like the healthiest lifestyle to me,
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.260]  you know, gathering your food, providing for your family
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.620]  like off the land, but knowing that the land
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.660]  is like providing for you and being humble about that.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:40.300]  There's definitely like, you know,
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:45.300]  a lot of nuance in the respect and forage etiquette
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.340]  and stuff like that.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:53.860]  But these are all like educational opportunities really.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:57.380]  And they're opportunities to get people out into nature,
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:01.260]  to get engaged with plants, to get engaged with food systems.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:04.860]  I mean, like, you know, it's wild.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.340]  Like nuts are one of those things where like,
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:09.820]  I'm like a, you know, 33 and grown ass man.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:12.500]  Like I haven't cracked many nuts in my life.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.980]  Like a nutcracker thing was like a novelty
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.420]  at Christmas time around my family, you know?
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.780]  Like, so going to this event and like actually
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.900]  just busting open a nut with a hammer
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.860]  or like one of the specialty crackers
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.620]  that you can get easily is like so satisfying
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.340]  to actually like harvest your food like that.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:38.220]  Do that final, you know, recognition of how the food
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:40.780]  is like prepared from nature to you.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.020]  And like, not to mention like Walnut Store
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.180]  in their husk for like two years, at least, you know?
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:52.780]  So yeah, there's like endless amount of benefits
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.460]  to the nut industry, whether it's to like
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.620]  the health of the people, you know,
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:04.100]  a thriving industry is, helps the local economy
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.780]  providing jobs and all that.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:09.660]  So, and then like the waste products from like nut husks
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.980]  are just like great mulch or some of them are like,
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:14.660]  can be natural dyes or, you know.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.060]  Microbes love them, man.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.620]  Like especially acorns, any nut, you know,
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.420]  because they're just loaded with energy.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:25.380]  The energy of that tree ready to blow up, ready to grow.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.940]  It's really exciting.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.460]  Yeah, that's great, man.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:33.580]  There is something extra special about acorn though.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.140]  Like if you're saying,
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.980]  do you wanna kind of go deeper into that?
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.580]  I know Marco's discovered that.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.820]  I feel like a lot of other people
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.980]  are starting to discover that.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.140]  You're welcome.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.180]  Yeah.
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:49.900]  Yeah, I mean, the Oak tree, like, wow, you know?
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:53.140]  So many different varieties of Oak,
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.380]  different species, subspecies.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.140]  They get hard.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.060]  They like breed, they interbreed so well.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.620]  They get hard to identify.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.900]  And like, that's part of their beauty, really.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.340]  I think that's part of their persistence as well.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:13.700]  And like found all across the continent
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:16.980]  and all types of like growing situations
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:19.100]  and regions and climates.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:24.700]  And they have such strong fungal relations.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:30.020]  Like, you know, Shiitake's dominant on them.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.060]  And, you know, like the wood chips are recommended
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:38.540]  for like, you know, like outdoor cultivation beds
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:42.140]  for oysters or King Strepharios
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.420]  or Enokis and stuff like that.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.260]  Like Oak has kind of always been the staple
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.900]  of mushroom cultivation.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:56.780]  It, you know, I just had some amazing products
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:58.540]  up at this nut fest.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:03.460]  Like there's a acorn porridge and like it looked gray
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:05.420]  but it was amazing.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.900]  Like the depth, it was kind of like
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.820]  butternut squash soup, but like with some umami behind it.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.820]  They had like apples and caramelized onions in there.
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:19.780]  But like, just that it's like this really
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.300]  it's a really important food source.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:25.780]  Like if, especially in any kind of like, you know
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.060]  systems collapse or like, you know
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.780]  the food network not being able to like
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.380]  grocery stores are empty.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.660]  Yeah. Thank you, Pete.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.180]  You know, anything like that.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.780]  Like, I think it's really important for people to connect
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:43.340]  with their local food sources.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.100]  And like, like Oaks are one of the like easiest.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.700]  I mean, they're like in the city central park
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.700]  like they're in, you know, lining the streets of most towns.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.380]  Like they're so abundant that like
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.620]  we don't have to look much further.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:02.580]  And it's obviously like, you know, not
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:04.300]  not like a panacea or anything like that.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:07.020]  But like, if you want to focus on a tree
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:11.180]  like that is doing like real, real well
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.300]  for humanity and the planet, like, yeah
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:17.100]  we got to give the oak tree props, no doubt.
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:20.660]  I wanted to add on what Matt's saying about Oaks, just
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.100]  in our area, at least in Virginia
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.380]  a lot of the really old oak trees are rapidly declining.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.980]  They're just calling it generally oak decline.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:30.580]  I don't know if this is down by you too, Marco.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.660]  Yeah. And a lot of the chainsaws too.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.500]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.320]  That too.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.620]  Yeah. But a lot of just heavy pests and fungal pressure
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.260]  maybe just some enough shifts in our weather patterns
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.540]  that are making them all across the board.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.340]  At least in my area, you see the biggest ones
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.140]  the old beautiful ones just starting to die.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:48.980]  And it's really tragic.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.340]  So it's really important for like people
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:51.980]  to start planting Oaks, you know
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.300]  there's a lot of Oaks coming up
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.060]  but breeding Oaks that are resistant
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.900]  to the new challenges that Oaks are facing
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.260]  all the same perspective that people bring
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.820]  into breeding cannabis and selecting
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.580]  for cannabis can be applied to all these fruit
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:07.540]  and nut trees too.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.740]  And it's really valuable to the food system
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.180]  for people to do that work.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.980]  And there's a handful of people really doing it
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.820]  and preserving these old heirloom genetics
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.500]  of hickories and stuff like that
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.300]  that are produce a really big nut
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.380]  that produces a higher yield of oil, things like that
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.660]  you know, really selecting for these more nuanced traits
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.980]  that make it more valuable to design it into a farm system.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.660]  You know, we have a lot of work to just learn
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.100]  what nature's already providing in terms of food.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:41.420]  Like, you know, there's so much in our bio region
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.220]  just available if you walk into the forest
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:44.940]  if you know what you're looking for
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.020]  and then taking some of those species
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:50.060]  and designing them into more thought out
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.380]  planned farm systems that can be harvestable
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:56.340]  on a predictable timescale, you know
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.620]  more streamlined harvesting type things.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.740]  And so not everyone's just foraging
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.140]  but it's a little bit fine tuning
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.380]  just some sort of the systems that nature's showing us.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.060]  Yeah, that's what kind of Matt and I are hoping
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:09.540]  to work with people on is people who have properties
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.700]  and land, the more little pockets
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.460]  of these tree systems we get just planted, you know
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.700]  whether it's one acre or a hundred acres, you know
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.300]  that's gonna long-term help a lot of people down the road.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.940]  When we see the long-term effects
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:27.660]  of our collapsing food production system, you know
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.940]  it's really not working.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.900]  If you look at most of the organic food
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:32.780]  that is in the grocery store
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.060]  that's coming out of California typically.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.660]  And if you go through California
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.780]  and you see how dry it is and the fires
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:41.020]  and the way the workers are treated, man
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.460]  that is not gonna last long.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.780]  The fact that that system is producing
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:48.380]  for most of our needs and it doesn't have to
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.780]  that's just a silly misconception
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.380]  that you have to depend on that.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:55.220]  You can band together with a few friends
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.300]  and build a small garden that can produce
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.460]  an insane amount of food that you don't know what to do with
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:04.020]  you know, and then, you know, people coming together
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.580]  for growing annuals I think is great
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:08.500]  because using farms for annual production
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.580]  I think is kind of ultimately kind of silly
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:12.180]  even though I've done it for a long time
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:15.620]  and it's necessary currently in our current system
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.700]  but I think everyone can grow their own vegetables.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.980]  It really doesn't take that much or a community of people
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.420]  if they find a little plot can band together
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.220]  and grow enough vegetables to sustain them.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.100]  I really, I really believe that.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.780]  And then people on a farm scale
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.100]  installing these nut orchards
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.660]  and looking at like perennial wheat crops
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.620]  you know, the land Institute in Kansas
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:39.740]  I think is working on, I think it's Kerns
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:41.300]  maybe it's not, I can't remember the name
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:42.540]  that's a different grain.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:44.540]  Anyway, a perennial grain.
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.660]  So we can grow grain crops for flour.
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:49.700]  They don't have to be tilled and break away
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:52.060]  from all the pesticide use and all that
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.980]  with some of our grain production
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:57.340]  and integrate it with these long-term storied
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.220]  berry crops and nut tree crops.
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:02.020]  It's just a really exciting time for agriculture
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:03.420]  because it's now been tested.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:04.980]  These aren't just like theoretical things.
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.940]  Like there's a lot of cool organizations
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.700]  across the country that are really putting good material
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.700]  out the Savannah Institute is a really good one.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.660]  If you want to look into that
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:16.900]  there's somewhere in the Midwest
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:19.300]  and they're just doing a lot of progressive work
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.820]  in the Midwest with agroforestry.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:25.380]  And yeah, a bunch of good, I could name a few
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.100]  but we can, you know, a lot of people doing the work
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.300]  that prove this is what we need to do.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.220]  So it's exciting.
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.580]  Have you, you've done work with the land Institute?
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.420]  No, I haven't.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.180]  I'm just, you know, I'm always geeking out on what
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.980]  Yeah, that's a great organization.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.540]  Totally. Yep.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:43.380]  Yep. Yeah.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:44.540]  And I'm not super familiar.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.820]  I just had, I kind of picked onto that
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:48.900]  that they're working on that perennial grain project.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.580]  Cause I think that's a really cool, you know
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:54.940]  just finding those perennials that can replace annuals.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.660]  I mean, there's so many just weeds that pop
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:59.740]  up in your garden that are more nutritious
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.540]  than what you're trying to grow, you know?
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.300]  So again, just learning, learning what is already
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:08.100]  being provided for us and then not forcing anything.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:11.400]  I think, I think a lot of agriculture has a pretty
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.460]  forceful approach and a heavy hand
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:15.720]  and wanting to control everything.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.980]  And, you know, if we sort of take a few steps back
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.140]  and scale back and work with like-minded people
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:23.180]  it gets easier.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.800]  So one of my buddies was a, like a prepper for a long time
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.720]  and he was constantly ingrained into my head
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:35.460]  that I should stock up on these things called mung beans.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.140]  That supposedly like, you know
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.680]  that's the prepper bean or whatever.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.200]  Is there a validity to that?
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.920]  And if so, why is that?
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.480]  Man, I would say it's acorns and all the nuts, man.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:47.520]  Like, I don't know.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.320]  I don't know personally about mung beans, honestly.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.960]  They're probably great.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.760]  But I say, just have everything, man.
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.760]  You gotta have a diversity of all of it.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.160]  Yeah, fruit and nut trees, that's it.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.580]  And then mushrooms, dude, mushrooms.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:03.440]  Mushrooms are pretty easy to cultivate
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.180]  and are an amazing, almost like a meat replacement.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:09.220]  Sometimes a good shiitake mushroom
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:11.480]  and you can have a huge flush of them and dehydrate them.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.600]  And then you have a winter supply of mushrooms, you know
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.720]  or go out foraging and find one huge chicken
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.200]  and go to the woods, dehydrate that or myitake
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.800]  and you're fed for quite a few meals
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.960]  or at least one big staple addition to your meal.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.720]  So I don't know that I have like one specific crop
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.960]  but yeah, the nuts for me, like people have kind
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.760]  of forgotten the importance of eating chestnuts
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.340]  and walnuts and acorns and all the different minerals.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.680]  I mean, think about a tree root system going so deep
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.440]  into the soil, getting access to minerals and things that
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.840]  you know, these other annual plants just aren't gonna
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.520]  get and just the complexity of a tree, it produces
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.120]  this really, you know, super nutrient dense food source
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:54.960]  in high abundance.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.120]  So if we learn how to store it properly, you know
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.280]  make flowers out of acorns, things like that.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:01.560]  So we can replace some of our other grains
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.420]  with acorn flour, like Matt was talking about or soups.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:08.160]  And it's, you know, that's what I
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.680]  that's what I kind of get most excited about.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.200]  I don't have like a set crop that I say
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.800]  this is what you need to keep around, but.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.400]  Let me just say about mung beans right quick, Brian.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.440]  Nikki's that's been a buzzword and Nikki's stuff.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.000]  So she's been reading up on mung beans.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.760]  So I think that's, it's a known
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.200]  it's been known by preppers probably for some time
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.000]  but now mainstream is catching on to it with the mung beans.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.800]  So I've been requested to grow that next season.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.780]  Yeah, it must be, it must be something, man.
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:39.140]  Cause it is a buzzword.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.160]  And from what I understand, if you're a true prepper
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.320]  you have what's called a bug out bag.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.680]  I'm talking about stuff.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.440]  I don't technically know everything.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.960]  You're on it.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.080]  Bug out bag.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:54.200]  And he was saying like pound for pound macadamia nuts.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.200]  So I even got my wife, she's breastfeeding right now.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.960]  So she's chowing down on macadamia nuts
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.760]  which seems like it does make a difference.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.760]  So the nut aspect of that, I think is drastically forgotten
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.400]  especially when you're really trying to focus
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.040]  on like nutrient health, like salads are great
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.560]  and everything, but there's other aspects
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.600]  to the human body.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.200]  Yeah. I mean, I think like the real, like
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.120]  as far as prepper mentality, like trying to grow
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.360]  for the long-term collapse thing
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.120]  it's really just perennial food systems.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:34.400]  And like, whatever is wherever you live
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.400]  you got to kind of figure out what's going to do best there.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.240]  You know?
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.480]  And there's a lot like nature is abundant, you know
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.040]  like around here, there's like persimmons and plums
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.040]  and just like mushrooms galore, nuts galore
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.000]  that we already like mentioned and everything.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.360]  And even like, there's a, you know, a lot of
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.280]  like small greens like dandelion and chickweed
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.840]  and watercress, like these grow everywhere.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.840]  So it's mustard, garlic mustard is, you know
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.920]  majorly invasive, but it's like a great food source.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.480]  Honestly, if you're, if you were to be starving, like it's
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.880]  it comes back, I think as far as prepping goes
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.840]  to education of like plants and stuff
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.840]  and what you have around you, but yeah, like I
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.600]  I wanted to
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.920]  Sustainable prepping, right?
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.640]  Where you can kind of not just have that bag
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.040]  of macadamia nuts, but now you can sustain
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.440]  at long-term off living off land.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  Yeah, cause I mean, hickory nuts are, are macadamia nuts
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.840]  you know, like macadamia nuts grow in the tropics.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.160]  So like, we won't find them out wild here, but like
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.760]  we'll find hickories on the ground, no doubt.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:49.480]  I mean, like even just like following the squirrels,
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.920]  you know, like if you were hungry
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.080]  you could legit just watch a squirrel bury a bunch
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.720]  of nuts and go pick up those nuts, you know
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.640]  like they do the work for you.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.520]  And you're like, there's like, there's food out there.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.120]  Point being like, as far as like prepping for food
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.160]  I think it's, it's more prevalent to, to, to learn
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.480]  for the, about the call, like to learn
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.440]  about the food around you for the collapse
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.400]  as opposed to try to have enough rice or mung beans
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.440]  or something to last until the end of the, you know
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.760]  chaos or whatever the, the, the visualization is, or
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.280]  but like something, I wanted to tie it all back
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.600]  to something that we all have in common, which is like
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:37.160]  we're all like citizen scientists, which is like
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.400]  seemingly like the most potent thing that
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.280]  that people can be doing these days, because like
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.520]  the traditional knowledge institutions
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.160]  and colleges and stuff, like they're really slow
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.240]  to get information out and it's bureaucratic
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.680]  and they have board members and they have to
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.240]  approve ideas of research and all this stuff.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.520]  And like, meanwhile, there's people doing it.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.840]  Like there's people, like if you're talking
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.120]  about plants, if you're talking about, you know
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:08.840]  like different genetic trials, let's talk about cannabis.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.320]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.200]  Like the colleges have not been teaching about cannabis
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:18.360]  and, or like, you know, researching it and having like
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.280]  giving it the attention that it deserves
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.920]  especially for how much money the state's making
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.760]  off of it now.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:28.000]  But we, I think what's happening is there's
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.680]  like this really great welling of citizen scientists
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:32.400]  that are coming together and we're starting to realize
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:35.880]  a lot through like living soil and regenerative agriculture
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.200]  and different growing practices.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.160]  We're like, yo, like we're at the tip of this.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.320]  You know, like all of us, like if we keep on,
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.880]  like I think it's why a lot of us
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.480]  like go onto Instagram every day.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.880]  It's to like keep seeing how people's different projects
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.400]  are progressing and what other people are learning about.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.400]  And I think that we are, everybody's kind of starting
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.160]  to realize that no matter what discipline they're in,
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.840]  like say that I just wanted to focus on hazelnuts
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.680]  or some shit.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.360]  Like I like inevitably am gonna realize
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:11.360]  that I need indigenous microorganisms on, in my toolbox.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.600]  And I'm gonna need to make friends with all the
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.600]  like vertebrates and invertebrates that live around.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  And I need to be able to have the pattern literacy
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.440]  of reading the weather and maybe some hard skills
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.160]  of like, you know, putting up trellises
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.440]  and stuff like that or something like, I don't know,
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.800]  not for hazelnuts, but like, you know what I'm saying?
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:34.040]  Like point being the trials and experiments
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.920]  that everybody and all of y'all right now
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:41.080]  that I'm talking to are doing is like really important stuff.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.920]  And like the more we can share that and get together
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.800]  and just kind of be like, yeah, there's people out here
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.280]  that like care and wanna know, like that's,
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.080]  that's like what I'm looking to get out of like interactions
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.000]  and stuff these days.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.560]  Like, you know, I'm not like, not trying to just glean
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.920]  information out of people every time that we're talking,
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.840]  but like, like everybody is so damn inspirational,
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.600]  like in the things that they do,
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.760]  if they're giving their heart, like that there's like
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.240]  these universal messages to learn
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.360]  and also some physical shit to like apply
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:13.440]  to your personal life.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.600]  Like, especially when you're growing, you know,
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:19.200]  like you learn stuff from water people,
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:23.560]  you learn stuff from like native plant people
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.960]  and, you know, cover cropping from farmers
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.360]  and all these things.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.480]  So like, really, I just wanted to like, thank you guys
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.360]  for like being the citizen scientists out there,
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.520]  constantly experimenting,
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.800]  constantly sharing what you're doing
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.440]  and like linking people together to talk about it
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.640]  because like legit,
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.560]  some of the most important things we can be doing
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.760]  is talking about what our findings, right?
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.680]  Yeah, and giving back to the community in an open source.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.480]  Unfortunately, sometimes people do kind of lean on each
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.440]  other, seem a certain way.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:01.160]  And now all of a sudden they have a class or a course,
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:02.800]  you know, so I think open source,
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.640]  if you're learning from open source,
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:06.840]  then you should contribute open source.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.800]  I also wanted to get into more like,
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:12.120]  since you boys are growing more of that,
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.680]  the cannabis aspects in a, you know,
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:17.480]  different environment, I would say,
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.720]  do you believe that indoor cannabis needs a cover crop
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:25.960]  if you're trying to replicate as best you can indoors?
[01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:32.230]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:33.070]  I mean like,
[01:52:33.070 --> 01:52:36.270]  I was like, yeah, let's expand more than that head nod.
[01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:41.270]  Yeah, yeah, cause you know, cannabis is just cannabis sativa.
[01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:42.830]  Like it's just one plant.
[01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:47.830]  It has its associated fungi and bacteria
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:49.830]  that thrives around it.
[01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:52.190]  But those fungi and bacteria have a whole set
[01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:55.110]  of related relations with all these other microorganisms
[01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:57.470]  that like, man, we really can't even understand.
[01:52:57.510 --> 01:53:02.070]  Like, I kind of think about it as like the cosmos in a way.
[01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:04.830]  Like if you're doing a completely controlled environment,
[01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:08.310]  like you just got like a couple stars out there, you know?
[01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:11.270]  But like, if you're introducing like nature
[01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:14.550]  and all the shit that's ever been able to breed and die
[01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:18.790]  and contribute some carbon and minerals
[01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:23.470]  and to live in this big genetic experiment,
[01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:27.550]  if you can introduce that into your indoor environment,
[01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:33.270]  I think that you do,
[01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:36.430]  I think that you need that to be like a organic regenerate,
[01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:40.590]  a successful organic indoor cannabis grower.
[01:53:40.590 --> 01:53:41.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:43.310]  Cause otherwise like,
[01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:48.470]  it swings all the way over to complete control.
[01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:49.990]  Like, I don't really feel like there's much
[01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:52.590]  of a middle ground personally.
[01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:53.590]  I'm sure there's other people
[01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:55.310]  that have these like systems dialed,
[01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:58.070]  but like me personally,
[01:53:58.070 --> 01:54:03.070]  I have had the greatest success with bigger bag, the better,
[01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:05.830]  because like at least like a 30 gallon,
[01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:08.830]  because you need that perennial moisture in there
[01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:10.990]  to keep microbes alive.
[01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:12.990]  I mean, even in a 30 gallon bag,
[01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:15.230]  like that's not even really like,
[01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:20.230]  it's not even enough of the variety of environments
[01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:23.790]  available for all the different microbes that you want
[01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:26.070]  to be traveling up and through your soil,
[01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:28.030]  you know, like as like stuff dries out
[01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:30.430]  because like growing cannabis indoor, you know,
[01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:34.630]  like you can't overwater it,
[01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:36.510]  you can't let it dry out too hard,
[01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:38.270]  but like it does need to dry out a little bit.
[01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:39.110]  You know what I mean?
[01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:44.110]  Like you need to really actually lean on the biology
[01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:47.030]  if you're gonna go that route.
[01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:50.430]  And the way you do that is by introducing all of it,
[01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:52.990]  in my opinion, like all of it.
[01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:58.590]  And so like, I get excited about indigenous microorganisms
[01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:01.310]  as close to home as possible.
[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:04.270]  Like me and Pete, like anytime he comes over,
[01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:05.470]  we go hiking right across the street,
[01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:08.190]  there's like this environmental education center.
[01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:11.470]  And like, we're always pulling back Duff
[01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:14.030]  and like being like, oh shit, like, yeah,
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:16.230]  like, you know, take a little handful of it home.
[01:55:16.230 --> 01:55:18.190]  Like maybe bring something and leave something
[01:55:18.190 --> 01:55:19.030]  in its place.
[01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:21.750]  Like if we were actually intending to harvest a little bit
[01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:22.710]  and bring it back into our system,
[01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:27.710]  but like pretty intentional about bringing microorganisms
[01:55:29.590 --> 01:55:31.790]  from places right around my home
[01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:34.190]  that it wouldn't hurt to disturb it too much
[01:55:34.190 --> 01:55:35.630]  and bringing it into my grow.
[01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:42.070]  And I've like water needs have gone like so far down
[01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:46.830]  and like mushrooms will be popping out the side
[01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:50.910]  of the grow bag and like, I don't know,
[01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:54.110]  then like the compost, I do like a pretty cold compost
[01:55:54.110 --> 01:55:56.150]  for like all of our like food scraps
[01:55:56.150 --> 01:55:58.830]  and like animal manure and stuff like that.
[01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:01.790]  Just like leave it sit, don't turn it
[01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:04.470]  for like a year and a half or so.
[01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:06.430]  And there's always like some stuff at the top
[01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:08.750]  that volunteers, you know, like tomatoes
[01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:10.470]  and squashes especially.
[01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:12.830]  And like, those are my cover crops then generally
[01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:14.990]  and always like random ass weed seeds,
[01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:17.150]  like whatever some grasses, you know,
[01:56:17.150 --> 01:56:20.150]  like I'll sometimes like take my fiskers
[01:56:20.150 --> 01:56:21.790]  and cut things off if they're like coming up
[01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:23.550]  into the actual branches.
[01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:28.550]  But like, I just like, I bank on like mother nature
[01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:32.190]  knows better than I do a lot of times.
[01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:34.390]  And that might look like laziness,
[01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:39.390]  but ultimately like I, since I haven't been working
[01:56:40.150 --> 01:56:44.750]  on like large farms, cause like nothing on my Instagram
[01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:46.950]  was any of like the big farms I used to work on
[01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:49.670]  out in Humboldt where there's like producing thousands
[01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:52.470]  of pounds, that was all I kind of production minded.
[01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:55.350]  Ever since then, I just realized that like,
[01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:57.830]  I love the plant, cannabis plant.
[01:56:57.830 --> 01:57:00.470]  And like, it's always been like for experimentation
[01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:03.830]  and observation and I'm not like trying to push it too hard
[01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:08.830]  for like yield, it's more about like the expression.
[01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:11.230]  And like ultimately terpenes, right?
[01:57:11.230 --> 01:57:12.830]  Like you gotta get them terps.
[01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:16.710]  It's the only thing that brings people back.
[01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:18.430]  I don't know if you've ever heard it say that,
[01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:21.830]  but you know, the only business is repeat business.
[01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:25.590]  That was our motto, you know, growing up in the peer group.
[01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:29.070]  Cause it was us versus the dispensaries
[01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:30.470]  in the commercial growth.
[01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:33.030]  So how do we get people to wanna drive past all that
[01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:35.110]  and meet up with us at a Whole Foods or something,
[01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:36.390]  you know, some parking lot.
[01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:38.950]  Not everybody wants to do that anymore,
[01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:41.670]  but if the quality is there, people are so used to it
[01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:43.910]  that they'll still do it that way.
[01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:46.110]  Wholesome Whole Foods meet up.
[01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:49.590]  Hey, you wanna tip with that?
[01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:51.550]  The reason why we chose Whole Foods
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:54.110]  is because those people are usually so self-absorbed
[01:57:54.110 --> 01:57:57.430]  into their own world that if you have a Whole Foods bag
[01:57:57.430 --> 01:58:00.350]  of obviously the work and you're putting it in
[01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:05.310]  and you're exchanging into a cars, nobody notices, man.
[01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:06.870]  So just remember that stuff.
[01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:09.710]  You gotta always just be in the moment.
[01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:11.910]  And as long as it looks correct,
[01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:13.990]  nobody's gonna question a thing.
[01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.830]  That's right.
[01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:18.230]  A lot of gold bars today, I would say.
[01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:19.830]  Yeah, this has been great, man.
[01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:21.030]  Just getting into everything.
[01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:23.030]  So I had a couple of questions going back
[01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:25.990]  to the big nut trees.
[01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:29.750]  You know, like, so I have a pecan tree in my backyard.
[01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:31.070]  I have a small yard.
[01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:35.390]  That tree will be huge for that yard eventually one day,
[01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:37.350]  but it's not too, you know, it's a good size.
[01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:42.350]  So how many trees or big nut trees would you plant per acre?
[01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:45.430]  Or is there a rule of thumb for spacing?
[01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:47.390]  Because we also have a place out here
[01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:49.310]  called Richard Bland College,
[01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:52.190]  and they have a huge pecan orchard.
[01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:55.350]  And I noticed their spacing is about 50 feet.
[01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:56.830]  And it's been around since like,
[01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:59.550]  I think John Adams or one of the presidents,
[01:58:59.550 --> 01:59:01.590]  whoever planted them back in the day.
[01:59:01.590 --> 01:59:05.390]  But so what kind of advice do you have on,
[01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:07.430]  you know, spacing and that kind of stuff?
[01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:12.590]  Yeah, you know, like, I don't have like
[01:59:12.590 --> 01:59:15.630]  the recommended spacings of everything, like memorized,
[01:59:15.630 --> 01:59:17.590]  but like, I generally do like,
[01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:19.070]  like type it into Google real quick.
[01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:21.030]  Like when I gotta like plant stuff out
[01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:24.430]  and like kind of match it, like lay it out in a landscape.
[01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:27.430]  But I also, so like,
[01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:31.830]  like pecans, like I'm pretty sure like 30 feet
[01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:32.910]  like chilling, you know,
[01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:35.430]  like you'll get a nice full tree that way.
[01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:38.350]  You know, you can-
[01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:40.270]  Because we got one, I'm sorry to cut.
[01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:43.030]  There's one thing, you know, we gotta do as farmers
[01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:45.670]  and a lot of younger farmers are guilty of this
[01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:46.910]  is they over plant.
[01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:49.350]  So now if I want this, I wanna plant this oak
[01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:51.990]  or this pecan and never have it touch.
[01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:54.630]  And so one thing you have to do is think about
[01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:56.750]  how big that tree will ultimately get.
[01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:59.310]  I think on an acre, you know, you would wanna
[01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:01.150]  just do your homework, like you said,
[02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:02.550]  not that we have it memorized,
[02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:05.390]  but think about that for planting anything really.
[02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:06.950]  You know, you don't wanna over plant.
[02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:08.550]  I wanna echo that Marco.
[02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:11.910]  That's the most common thing I've seen people misdo
[02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:14.070]  with orchards and vegetable gardens,
[02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:16.350]  just kind of try to jam everything too close together.
[02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:19.390]  Plants want like space to like fully express
[02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:22.310]  and like breathe and let airflow go through the system.
[02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:25.710]  You know, it's important to not overcrowd everything.
[02:00:25.710 --> 02:00:28.630]  There is some value in like over planting young trees
[02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:30.590]  at the beginning of a, you know, a planting,
[02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:32.390]  just in case you eventually lose something,
[02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:34.510]  the rodents or something like that, you know,
[02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:37.550]  started at like a double density of what you ultimately want
[02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:40.030]  and then ultimately thin out some trees for lumber
[02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:41.950]  down the road or something like that, you know?
[02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:44.350]  So just kind of plant a little denser to start
[02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:45.190]  just to get everything.
[02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:46.630]  And you also get a competition effect
[02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:48.470]  where trees will grow up straighter
[02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:50.830]  if they're bunched together.
[02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:52.870]  So there's different ways to just manipulate the system
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:54.750]  depending on what your space is.
[02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:56.790]  And also going to genetics, you know,
[02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:58.950]  like we haven't done a ton of research on,
[02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:02.990]  or a lot of citizen science recently on pecan breeding,
[02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:04.950]  you know, maybe there's like a really good dwarf pecan
[02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:07.950]  that's like great for smaller environments, you know,
[02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:09.510]  but we haven't found it yet.
[02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:10.510]  Just things like that, you know,
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:15.170]  I think selecting the right plant for your situation.
[02:01:15.170 --> 02:01:17.110]  I see a lot of people like want to put an apple tree
[02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:18.030]  in somewhere, but it's like,
[02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:19.590]  that's just not the place for an apple.
[02:01:19.590 --> 02:01:22.230]  Like, I'm sorry, like it's a wet clay pit
[02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:24.590]  that's not gonna, you know,
[02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:26.670]  want an apple tree is not gonna thrive.
[02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:29.230]  It's gonna have a lot of problems, do something else.
[02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:31.430]  So yeah, again, just kind of working with somebody
[02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:32.630]  who knows what's gonna work where,
[02:01:32.630 --> 02:01:34.030]  and I'm still learning a lot of that too
[02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:37.070]  when it comes to trees, having focused on vegetables,
[02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:39.270]  but I know a lot of people who, you know,
[02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:41.110]  I can go to quickly and ask that question.
[02:01:41.110 --> 02:01:43.310]  And one of my best friends, Alex Darr,
[02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:46.110]  is an amazing designer that designs these huge
[02:01:46.110 --> 02:01:48.550]  habitat restorations and agroforestry systems.
[02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:49.590]  So I can call on him and be like,
[02:01:49.590 --> 02:01:51.590]  hey man, is this gonna make sense here?
[02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:53.750]  And, you know, kind of play around.
[02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:56.590]  There's also ways that you can manipulate, you know,
[02:01:56.590 --> 02:01:58.990]  pruning trees to make them fit better into space,
[02:01:58.990 --> 02:02:01.550]  you know, and pollarding and things like that.
[02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:06.550]  That's kind of old school ways of getting certain trees
[02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:09.030]  to certain shapes, you know, for a certain purpose
[02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:11.590]  and getting different crops off of them, you know,
[02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:12.670]  where you're trying to get lumber,
[02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:15.210]  get a whole bunch of sticks if you pollard a tree.
[02:02:15.210 --> 02:02:18.270]  So yeah, there's lots of different ways to approach that,
[02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:21.230]  you know, but a common thing I see is people trying
[02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.150]  to put way too much in a small space
[02:02:24.150 --> 02:02:28.030]  and things just kind of aren't able to fully express.
[02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:30.950]  And same with cannabis too, you know, cannabis,
[02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:33.790]  I love to give my cannabis plants as much space as possible,
[02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:36.070]  you know, especially in this humid environment
[02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:39.310]  from each other to just let a lot of airflow go through.
[02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:41.750]  So if you cram a bunch of things together and don't prune,
[02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:43.670]  you're gonna get some problems.
[02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:45.230]  Yeah, great answer, Pete.
[02:02:46.110 --> 02:02:46.950]  Definitely gonna have problems.
[02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:50.950]  I think when you're planting out like perennial,
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.840]  oh, packing them together, yeah.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:02.660]  But about planting perennial like tree crops
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.700]  and stuff like that, I think it's really important
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:10.700]  on the installation, during onset of the installation,
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:15.700]  it's really important to know the long-term management goals
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:18.300]  because like you can plant, you know,
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:21.300]  semi-dwarf fruit trees close to each other,
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:24.380]  you know, 10, 12 feet and they'll grow into each other,
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:26.720]  but you have to know that every year or every other year,
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:29.900]  you're gonna be managing the shape of that tree.
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.940]  We can do a lot to like manipulate the growth of plants
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.800]  and some people, you know, like a lot of methods,
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.800]  like coppicing hazelnuts like every third year.
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  So like helps consistently like eternally produce
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.260]  really healthy growth and production.
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:56.300]  So like there's management methods,
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:59.800]  but like that can, that will make your production
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.680]  go through the roof.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.080]  But there's also, if you're just like,
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.200]  this is a standalone self-sustaining food forest,
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:11.260]  that's a whole other style of planting.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:16.620]  So then yeah, if you want that singular pecan tree
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:19.660]  to thrive, like give it full sun,
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.380]  don't crowd it with like anything else,
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:23.280]  except for some super low,
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:26.540]  like annually dying back vegetation,
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:27.900]  that's like, you know, perennial grasses
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.060]  or something like that.
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:33.260]  And yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all about,
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.400]  it's all about what your long-term goals are.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.260]  That's what I wanna say.
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.340]  Nice.
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.780]  Yeah, cause I was just thinking as you were speaking, man,
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:42.660]  you're talking long-term
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.820]  and think of a piece of property guys.
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.320]  Think of, okay, now think past yourself,
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.000]  you know, 50 years down the road or 80 or a hundred.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.100]  You wanna plant your trees in a way that even if people
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:59.300]  didn't tend to that land well, or didn't maintain it,
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.340]  you could still see that the, okay,
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:03.620]  trees are there for a reason.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:04.460]  You know what I mean?
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:06.860]  So think real, real long-term with some of this stuff.
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:10.220]  You know, I do, I mean, hey, after you die,
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:12.700]  someone could go cut everything down or anything could
[02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:14.820]  happen, but do the best you can.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:17.780]  And if you think ahead, then maybe you leave something
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.060]  really, you know, really nice.
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:21.740]  I like, you know, when you go to the botanical gardens
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.520]  and things were, you know, planted a hundred years ago
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.660]  and now we're getting to enjoy it.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:28.860]  You know, the guy that planted it doesn't necessarily
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:30.780]  get to enjoy it as much.
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:34.660]  You know, he did the work, which was fun and fulfilling,
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.660]  but you know, the enjoyment's gonna come later, you know?
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:40.660]  And even for me now, things I'm planning are for when
[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:43.740]  I'm able to just, maybe there's a day I can just drive
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.580]  in my truck.
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.220]  Well, I can, on my property, can do a little lap around
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:49.860]  my property in my truck and sit there and be right there
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.900]  next to a pollinator gardens and things like that.
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:56.180]  And I remember like, you know, spending summers,
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:59.500]  my great-grandmother's in Georgia, their neighbor,
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.180]  big daddy, you know, would always sit in his Cadillac.
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.900]  He couldn't drive anymore, but he would sit out there
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.980]  in his Cadillac all day.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:09.700]  And with the little radio playing and you walk up to him,
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:12.400]  to holler at him, talk to him a little while.
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:15.160]  And, you know, but just, I just think about things
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.000]  like that, man.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.020]  You always gotta think about what, you know, you can't,
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:20.540]  you might not be able to move as much as you are now
[02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:23.540]  and, you know, or a loved one might need something
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.360]  like that.
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:27.140]  So I always kind of think outside the box and plan ahead,
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:28.700]  I think is a good way to think.
[02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:33.980]  Now we're going deeper with the fruit trees and stuff.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:36.380]  If you're building this out, you have your own land.
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:40.780]  Is it extremely beneficial to, you know,
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:43.140]  I don't know how deep each individual would want to go,
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:46.340]  but finding ways to add bees to your property.
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:48.300]  So beekeeping, if you're into that,
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.820]  or just maybe finding a few ways to plant
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:55.220]  and get more of that naturally to your land.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:59.700]  I just want to say quick on that.
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:02.540]  I'm all about keeping bees and getting into that.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.180]  If you're called to it, I have never been personally.
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.500]  I just felt like a whole nother thing
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:09.260]  that I didn't have the capacity for.
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:10.460]  And I wanted, if I was going to get bees,
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:11.740]  I wanted to take really good care of them
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:14.220]  and make sure they were, you know, thriving.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:16.940]  And I had pigs and livestock other things.
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:19.000]  So I didn't get into bees, but man,
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.020]  I found planting all these different species
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.700]  to attract the native pollinators, they come in and work.
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:27.260]  And, you know, there's plenty of research on that too.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.700]  Some of these native bees that even look kind of clumsy
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.180]  are like exponentially more efficient at pollinating
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:35.600]  than a honeybee, you know?
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:40.600]  So it's, I'm all about honeybees more than Mario.
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.660]  I'm happy when I see people getting into that.
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.260]  But yeah, it's good to just know
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:46.740]  that there are a lot of natives.
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:49.880]  If you build it, they will come and help you out.
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:53.240]  And I've seen that over four seasons of managing a farm.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:57.160]  It was such an amazing, I witnessed it firsthand.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:58.600]  Like first couple of seasons,
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:00.700]  we had such insane pest pressure.
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:03.540]  Every year, the more and more pollinator plots we got going
[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:07.300]  and letting just native weeds come up like Queen Anne's Lace,
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.300]  wet thistle flower occasionally,
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.900]  all these things were just attracting
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:13.800]  such diversity of insects and, you know,
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:15.820]  predatory insects and pollinators
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.180]  that it just was, it was happening on its own.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:20.700]  So I say people were planting an orchard,
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:21.800]  you know, it depends where you are.
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:24.340]  If you're in a, you know, every situation's different.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.260]  Bees might be needed where you are.
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:27.340]  I can't say for sure.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.840]  Some people might be in sort of like a little pocket
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.320]  where there isn't a lot of native buffer
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:37.600]  to allow for that thriving native pollinator community.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:39.160]  And if there's a place where there's a lot of spray
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:42.360]  is going on around in the surrounding zone,
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:45.320]  that can really rapidly impact that.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:46.780]  So yeah, in those types of situations,
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:49.020]  I think starting to learn how to keep bees
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.520]  makes a lot of sense.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.880]  But you know, I'm fortunate
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.520]  where there's a really nice ecosystem around me
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.440]  that does support pollinators.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:59.200]  If you put some flowers out, man, it's just, man,
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.720]  get a container of mint
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.200]  that's not gonna spread everywhere on you
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:03.400]  and let that flower.
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:05.360]  It's insane.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.540]  I mean, you just stare at it for an hour.
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.400]  It's a meditation,
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:10.360]  just watching all these different insects come through.
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:13.680]  So again, it's the common theme here
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:15.920]  that we can keep saying is just nature really,
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:18.880]  really helps us out if you kind of work with her, you know?
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.920]  When you mentioned the honeybee, is that,
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.840]  are you not able to keep bees outside of the honeybee?
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.960]  I'm sure there's people that do.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.400]  I'm sure there's people that keep a variety of bees.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:36.080]  I guarantee, man, like, you know,
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.840]  you know in the insect world, maybe you could be that guy.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.740]  You should be the guy that keeps these alternative bees.
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:44.880]  Seriously, man, who knows, dude?
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:46.760]  You could, that could be something.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:49.040]  I gotta find my own spot, my landlord.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.040]  A bee man.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.760]  A thousand stings in the game.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.200]  Can you imagine if things really turned to like a zero scape?
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.160]  Like that's what my neighborhood's about.
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:01.520]  They want zero scape
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:04.720]  because they're conserving water and all this.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.680]  It's obviously the exact opposite of what the, yeah.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:10.600]  So the policies being made sometimes,
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.600]  even at the, you know,
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.160]  I guess that's the local level is really ridiculous, man.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:18.480]  Like you don't think they would consult somebody
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:21.720]  that might know a little bit about the subject at hand.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:23.640]  Yeah.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.200]  Zero scape is huge here.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.160]  Yeah, it's wild.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:31.160]  You know, we had a gathering of people at our spot
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:33.120]  like a month or so ago,
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.000]  and there's a lot of elevated conversation.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.560]  And there was a girl here who works
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:40.920]  for the local conservation group.
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:43.700]  And she does a lot of the like grant writing
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.580]  and the policy making and stuff.
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:48.820]  And she was talking about how, you know,
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:52.440]  there aren't people at the municipalities
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:57.480]  that have the influence, that have the education.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:59.200]  Everybody just kind of follows suit
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.000]  from the people before them.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.480]  And the ordinances, a lot of times are the things
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.000]  that stop these really awesome
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.840]  regenerative projects from happening.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:13.080]  You know, like people can't have like chickens
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.480]  in their neighborhood and like, damn,
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:18.440]  like that's such an easy way to get sustenance.
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.840]  Like that should be a human, just a right.
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.040]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.480]  Like you should be allowed to keep your food and stuff.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.840]  But yeah, like, you know, people being offended
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:29.560]  and all these things like have gotten in the way
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:32.840]  of like the, just like the policies being made
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.640]  for not sustaining actual human life.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.560]  And it really takes like people getting active
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.680]  at the local level.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:41.360]  And like, here's me saying that,
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.120]  but like, you know, I'm not politically active
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.720]  because like, you know, I have a hard time
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:51.320]  like going into meetings and boardrooms
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.200]  and stuff like that.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:53.360]  Like it's, you know what I mean?
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.960]  Like that's just one of the few things
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.120]  that I don't like doing.
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.600]  So I am all about people who want to do that.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.520]  And that's where some of the real change is happening,
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.480]  you know, like, and I know this for a fact
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:09.400]  from the town of Arcata is a great Arcata, California.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:13.040]  Like in the seventies or something,
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.520]  the early eighties, the city council board members
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.160]  got taken over by a bunch of hippies,
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.560]  a bunch of cool people.
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  And their sewage system was developed
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.040]  so that the entire town sewage goes to the Arcata Bay
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:32.040]  in this really responsible way where it channels
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:35.640]  through these like fenced off with this like maze
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.440]  of like swamp lands.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.600]  And it like gets cleaned by the reeds and all this stuff.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.520]  Like how like, you know, the Hudson Bay used to do it
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:47.960]  for New York city back in, you know, 1800s or whatever.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.560]  And obviously that all got out of hand,
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.240]  but point being, and like the ordinances
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.240]  in the town of Arcata are like awesome, you know,
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.800]  fruit trees dripping on the streets,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.840]  like downtown, like art everywhere.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:02.120]  It's like, you know, it's one of those examples of a town
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.520]  and there's other ones like Asheville
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:05.760]  and all those cool little local hubs,
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:07.120]  but people did it, you know?
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.280]  And like, I was at a permaculture talk in Asheville
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.000]  and somebody asked the guy who's like,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:15.840]  well, what can we do?
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:16.680]  What's the best thing we can do
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.000]  with like all this information, you know?
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.160]  Like how should we put it into action?
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:22.200]  And the guy was like, well,
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:24.680]  take all the permaculture information you're learning,
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:27.520]  all the inspirational regenerative information
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:30.520]  from this class and everybody in broader Asheville
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:32.880]  and then get the fuck out, go back home,
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:36.280]  go back to the Midwest or the New England
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.640]  or your town that you hate so much
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.840]  and like make it better, you know?
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:43.360]  And like hearing that, I was just like,
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.240]  damn, that sucks.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:47.480]  Cause it's like, I don't want to go back to Reading,
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:48.840]  but like-
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.200]  He made you go.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.080]  Yeah, nobody else is gonna do it, you know?
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.640]  Like you want something done right,
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:58.560]  you gotta do it yourself.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.040]  Like, I don't entirely believe that,
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:02.720]  but like, shit, you gotta get up,
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:04.040]  you gotta stay motivated.
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:06.160]  And like, I noticed that, like, you know,
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.960]  I grew up here in Berks County,
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:10.800]  like where I live right now, where I returned to.
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:12.680]  And like, you know, I traveled,
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:14.600]  I lived in other places, North Carolina
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:16.400]  and California and whatnot.
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.120]  And like, I made great friends,
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.320]  but I never had the same network
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.400]  as like where you grow up, you know?
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.880]  There's so much embedded in that.
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:28.440]  And like, maybe that's not the same case for everybody.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:29.600]  And like, they move to a place
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.920]  where they find that network and whatever.
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:35.440]  But like, when you start plugging into a network,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.400]  like it really is actually the thing
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.520]  that like starts to sustain you into the future.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:45.120]  And like, I'm trying not to harp on the bad parts
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.480]  of where I live and try to just like look
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:50.440]  at the good things that are up and coming, you know?
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.920]  So that's like, yeah, that's where I'm about.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.800]  Like where, you know, I'm always excited
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.120]  for conversations like this,
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:01.840]  because it's just a chance to hear
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.920]  where other people are at and share where I'm at
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.640]  and with like-minded individuals.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.000]  And, you know, like it doesn't even have to be
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.080]  like a formal education platform thing.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.680]  Like, you know, where it's like,
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:20.320]  you're trying to get like information across,
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:24.080]  like, cause so much information is just transmitted
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.200]  like from hosting a conversation with somebody.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.960]  So yeah, to tie it back,
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:34.800]  like I really appreciate you guys doing the networking work,
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.560]  connecting us like mycelium.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.520]  Definitely, man.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:41.600]  Like that's what I always say, man, spread it back.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.880]  You know, learn, if you learn something, spread it out,
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:45.440]  teach somebody else.
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:47.800]  And that's how we'll all get stronger.
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:50.280]  You know, us right here that we can all talk to
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.840]  that's listening to us are already on this, right?
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.080]  We need to touch more people that are on the verge
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.840]  of being on it or don't know which way to go, right?
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:01.720]  So that's kind of why we're doing this, which is great.
[02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.830]  Absolutely.
[02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:07.790]  So are there any learning opportunities
[02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:10.510]  that either you have coming up in the future
[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:11.990]  that we can learn more about?
[02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:15.990]  Well, I'm definitely gonna get something going, man.
[02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:19.190]  We'll go get something going soon, but no, not right now,
[02:16:19.190 --> 02:16:21.190]  man, I'm just been grinding,
[02:16:21.190 --> 02:16:23.670]  actually building my infrastructure,
[02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:26.910]  working on my pond, got that in.
[02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:30.590]  Now I'm just dialing in my little bit of filtration
[02:16:30.590 --> 02:16:32.150]  and I'm working that.
[02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:34.270]  And I wanna set, but I wanna make sure
[02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:37.630]  I'm setting that filtration up to where I can expand it
[02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:39.150]  because I wanna do aquaculture
[02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:42.030]  alongside of this natural pond.
[02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:43.830]  So I've been working on that,
[02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:47.030]  building IMO three piles because it's cool.
[02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:48.470]  And you know, those are things
[02:16:48.470 --> 02:16:50.470]  that people would really love to see.
[02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:54.950]  So I've been, I got myself a GoPro or whatever,
[02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:57.550]  and I've been filming these things as I've been doing them,
[02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:59.430]  like long, just kind of long winded,
[02:16:59.430 --> 02:17:01.270]  not even editing right now,
[02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:03.110]  just getting it all on film.
[02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:05.110]  And then I wanna start kind of putting some of those
[02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:08.430]  kind of longer, you know, from start to finish,
[02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:10.190]  you know, digging the pond, you know,
[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:13.350]  sizing the liner, you know, laying the pre-liner,
[02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:14.590]  if you have to go liner.
[02:17:14.590 --> 02:17:17.750]  My soil is really sandy, I'm close to the river.
[02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:21.110]  So I didn't wanna even mess with trying to clay it
[02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:22.590]  and trying to get it to lock in,
[02:17:22.590 --> 02:17:24.790]  and it's not a very big pond anyway.
[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:28.390]  It's to the point where my land actually,
[02:17:28.390 --> 02:17:29.790]  Matt, you would appreciate this.
[02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:33.150]  I'm so close to the river that when it rains
[02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:35.430]  and it floods really bad,
[02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:38.870]  far enough away the river doesn't flood to my land,
[02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:42.190]  but the groundwater will actually come up
[02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:44.110]  and set now form kind of pools.
[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:45.110]  Yeah, and it's wild.
[02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:46.830]  And then when the river goes down,
[02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:49.270]  it kind of goes down kind of with it.
[02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:51.550]  So it's interesting.
[02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:54.070]  So I went with the liner because of that.
[02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:57.430]  You got some pawpaws down there?
[02:17:57.430 --> 02:17:59.670]  Yeah, I got a couple out there.
[02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:01.390]  I had a few, I had three,
[02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:04.510]  and then I went to Michael's and bought about four.
[02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:06.910]  And so now I've been adding some pawpaws,
[02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:11.910]  but I think pawpaws, but figs are kind of my thing.
[02:18:12.390 --> 02:18:16.390]  I got a lot, I got, I think about six varieties of figs now.
[02:18:16.390 --> 02:18:19.070]  And my wife and I were just out there on the property,
[02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:20.710]  just walking around, looking at stuff.
[02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:24.710]  And I said, shit, why can't I have a fig fest?
[02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:28.750]  Like I grow all my figs and he started a pawpaw fest,
[02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:31.150]  have a fig fest, things like that,
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:34.470]  just kind of doing what someone else is doing,
[02:18:34.470 --> 02:18:35.750]  but in your own way.
[02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:37.230]  I mean, I think that's pretty cool.
[02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:38.870]  And people might dig that.
[02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:40.950]  Please, please have a fig fest, dude.
[02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:42.230]  That would be awesome.
[02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:43.430]  We need that.
[02:18:43.430 --> 02:18:48.430]  Are you linked up with Bassamon, Trees of Joy,
[02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:51.150]  I think up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?
[02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:52.590]  No, no, I'm not linked.
[02:18:52.590 --> 02:18:54.630]  Oh man, you have to look into that.
[02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:56.430]  Bassamon, Trees of Joy.
[02:18:56.430 --> 02:18:58.630]  I'm pretty sure it's Trees of Joy.
[02:18:59.510 --> 02:19:04.510]  He has the most varieties of figs I've ever seen.
[02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:08.390]  I think he holds the biggest library
[02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:09.670]  in the States at least.
[02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:14.110]  And yeah, really cool varieties.
[02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:15.830]  He's like walked around a lot of the cities
[02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:18.150]  in the Northeast and has gone to different neighborhoods
[02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:20.550]  and just has found like fig trees growing
[02:19:20.550 --> 02:19:24.270]  because they grow in urban environments really good
[02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:26.550]  because all the concrete and blacktop,
[02:19:26.670 --> 02:19:28.150]  the thermal radiance.
[02:19:29.630 --> 02:19:32.230]  And so he just like goes around and collects
[02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:34.070]  like these pretty much unknown varieties
[02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:35.750]  that have just come from all these different parts
[02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:36.590]  of the world.
[02:19:36.590 --> 02:19:38.390]  Like he walked around New York,
[02:19:38.390 --> 02:19:41.190]  like Easton and Philadelphia and Boston
[02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:44.510]  and has like found these really unique varieties.
[02:19:44.510 --> 02:19:47.030]  So that's definitely something you gotta look into
[02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.870]  for sure.
[02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:49.630]  That's tight.
[02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:51.070]  I'm gonna pin that with a gold bar.
[02:19:52.110 --> 02:19:53.870]  Yeah, man, damn, that's very interesting.
[02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:55.630]  Because if you think about it,
[02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:58.750]  I have some friends that are really into figs,
[02:19:58.750 --> 02:20:01.030]  like fig guys.
[02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:03.150]  And sometimes I'll send them a fig
[02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:04.310]  and they can't even,
[02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:08.950]  they can't even ID it.
[02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:09.790]  You know what I mean?
[02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:13.630]  So like there's a lot of different figs out there, man.
[02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:14.470]  It's a whole world.
[02:20:14.470 --> 02:20:15.310]  I love fig.
[02:20:15.310 --> 02:20:16.150]  You like figs, Brian?
[02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:17.750]  You know where fig news come from?
[02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:19.390]  I like fig guys.
[02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:21.350]  You know, the big fig.
[02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:22.190]  I do, man.
[02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.870]  I, to be honest, I like fig news.
[02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:25.910]  I make fig beer as a fig guy.
[02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:28.230]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:29.350]  Figs and dates.
[02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:31.910]  I think those are, from what I understand,
[02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:34.950]  those actually used to be like royalty foods.
[02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:38.390]  You know, it was very hard to get those kinds of things.
[02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:39.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:20:39.390 --> 02:20:41.790]  And I know figs, one of my Mediterranean friends,
[02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:43.470]  he said that if you have diabetes,
[02:20:43.470 --> 02:20:47.150]  the sugar in figs actually counteracts
[02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:49.550]  that bad forms of sugar.
[02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:50.830]  I don't know all about it
[02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:52.950]  because I don't have diabetes, but he said that.
[02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:54.430]  So I was like, that's worth knowing.
[02:20:54.430 --> 02:20:58.310]  He said it's a good type of sugar to eat for your body.
[02:20:59.830 --> 02:21:03.230]  I've been trying to get my hands on those jujubes
[02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:06.390]  that Michael Judd was showcasing on his page the other day.
[02:21:06.390 --> 02:21:07.830]  I saw those.
[02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:10.750]  Yeah, they're a Chinese fruit, but yeah, when they dry out,
[02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:13.350]  apparently they taste just like dates.
[02:21:13.350 --> 02:21:16.630]  That's something I'm like, all those new unique fruits,
[02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:19.230]  like that shit's so fun to me, you know?
[02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:21.350]  Yeah, oh yeah, definitely.
[02:21:21.350 --> 02:21:23.830]  Chad, it's fruit and cake, man.
[02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:25.270]  Everybody's known that for a long time.
[02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:26.230]  That's right.
[02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:27.790]  Fruit and nuts, boy.
[02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:29.430]  And who the hell doesn't eat those things
[02:21:29.430 --> 02:21:31.110]  by the sleeve, dude?
[02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:34.390]  Oh yeah, I get a whole sleeve for this deal.
[02:21:34.390 --> 02:21:36.310]  It's like eating Oreos or something.
[02:21:36.310 --> 02:21:38.790]  Like I can't eat two cookies.
[02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:40.950]  But you feel better eating a sleeve of figs
[02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:43.270]  than a sleeve of Oreos.
[02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:46.710]  Oh yeah, that was always like the healthy snack growing up.
[02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:48.110]  You know, like my mom was like,
[02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:49.790]  oh, we're feeding you super healthy.
[02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:50.870]  Like we're not getting Oreos.
[02:21:51.390 --> 02:21:52.230]  We're gonna get Fig Newtons.
[02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:53.070]  And I'm like, all right,
[02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:55.550]  I'm gonna eat the whole fucking bag.
[02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:57.990]  Man, here, we didn't get Oreos.
[02:21:57.990 --> 02:22:00.630]  No, I'm with you on that.
[02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:01.910]  Yeah, dad was,
[02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:04.710]  because you get a lot of your snacks from your people.
[02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:07.670]  You know, my dad, he loved his figs and he loved nuts.
[02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:09.230]  He always has a bowl of nuts around
[02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:10.870]  with a nutcracker ready for you.
[02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:16.910]  Man, I literally saw Oreos destroy a family.
[02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:21.590]  They won the like lifelong Oreo thing.
[02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:23.350]  This used to be like a contest.
[02:22:23.350 --> 02:22:25.390]  Well, their family won that shit.
[02:22:25.390 --> 02:22:27.550]  And they would eat so many Oreos
[02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:31.870]  that like it literally changed their family.
[02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:32.910]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:35.390]  Damn, sabotage.
[02:22:35.390 --> 02:22:36.510]  Yeah, you would think like,
[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:38.950]  oh man, you got Oreos for life.
[02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:39.790]  But that-
[02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:41.430]  You got heart disease.
[02:22:41.430 --> 02:22:42.830]  Took a family down.
[02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:44.430]  I even had to tell my wife that.
[02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:46.590]  It's pretty sad.
[02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:49.790]  But how irresponsible of the Oreo company.
[02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:50.630]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:52.310]  Like it's-
[02:22:52.310 --> 02:22:53.790]  They were always giving it out, dude.
[02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:55.510]  Like Willy Wonka style.
[02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:56.350]  Every time you see them,
[02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:58.390]  they're on our soccer team for a while.
[02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:00.790]  And then he couldn't keep up was the other thing.
[02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:03.190]  So he, you know, his,
[02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:06.430]  I guess his whole view of things changed in that family.
[02:23:06.430 --> 02:23:07.870]  And they were eating so many cookies
[02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:09.670]  that he just couldn't keep up.
[02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:10.510]  They didn't get burned.
[02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:12.310]  I just never forgot that, you know?
[02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:14.070]  Like Oreos could take you down, dude.
[02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:15.590]  You gotta be careful.
[02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:16.790]  Yeah, totally.
[02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:19.190]  Gucci man, you know, he's got the ice cream on his,
[02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.030]  he knows, dude.
[02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:23.190]  Sugar, you gotta be scared of that shit, man.
[02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:25.110]  Growing up in the streets.
[02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:27.950]  I mean, I think that's why I'm into fruit trees, honestly.
[02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:30.870]  Like I'm like low key a sugar addict.
[02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:34.790]  Like it sucks, but like, you know what I mean?
[02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:37.430]  It's like a thing that I, like,
[02:23:37.430 --> 02:23:40.390]  I'm testing my willpower these days with like,
[02:23:40.390 --> 02:23:43.070]  literally today with the Halloween candy
[02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.910]  sitting down there.
[02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:45.870]  Like, you know, we try to make sure
[02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:48.070]  the kids forget about it, but like, you know,
[02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:51.870]  that's, it's a pretty insane culture that, you know,
[02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:54.470]  if we're trying to live a holistically healthy life,
[02:23:54.470 --> 02:23:56.830]  like it's pretty like gnarly culture
[02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:59.030]  that you're working against, you know?
[02:24:00.270 --> 02:24:01.630]  So many examples of it everywhere,
[02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:04.150]  but like Halloween's definitely one of those
[02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:06.950]  where you're like, damn, it's so easy to be unhealthy.
[02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:08.470]  And it's so hard to be healthy.
[02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:10.430]  So.
[02:24:10.430 --> 02:24:11.710]  I've definitely gotten Fig Newtons
[02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:14.350]  in my Halloween thing when I was a kid.
[02:24:14.350 --> 02:24:18.190]  So yeah, some forward thinking individuals back then.
[02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:19.310]  There were disappointment,
[02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:21.390]  then like around here in Pennsylvania,
[02:24:21.390 --> 02:24:22.910]  it was always bags of pretzels.
[02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:25.950]  And you're like, ah, come on, pretzels, nah.
[02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:29.870]  I feel you, it just has like a ghost on the front.
[02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:30.710]  You're like, come on.
[02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:31.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:34.350]  I could have got this anyways.
[02:24:34.350 --> 02:24:36.870]  The roll back, the airplane back.
[02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:39.350]  Halloween stuff real quick.
[02:24:39.350 --> 02:24:41.590]  My parents went from like, when we were kids,
[02:24:42.470 --> 02:24:44.230]  being the pretzel house,
[02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:46.030]  to now that there's no kids there,
[02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:48.470]  being the like king-sized candy bar house.
[02:24:49.310 --> 02:24:51.630]  That was me and the wife when we were doing the,
[02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:52.950]  we were going crazy with it.
[02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:54.550]  Yeah, reach in there and get all you want.
[02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:57.310]  Then kids started coming like with just a mask
[02:24:57.310 --> 02:24:58.150]  in their hand.
[02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.990]  We're like, hold on, y'all.
[02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:00.790]  Y'all ain't gonna be abusing me like this.
[02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:02.110]  You gotta work for it.
[02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:04.310]  Yeah, you gotta at least put on your stuff.
[02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:08.230]  I would imagine Word would travel quick
[02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:09.750]  in the kid community around there
[02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:12.190]  if you guys are giving out full-size candy bars.
[02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:14.670]  Oh, no doubt.
[02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:17.510]  Yeah, that's the, we're like, maybe not though.
[02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:19.430]  Cause it's like a coveted secret at that point too.
[02:25:19.430 --> 02:25:21.750]  You know, like I remember those years.
[02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:30.310]  The people that give you like non brand name candy.
[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:31.710]  You know, you be like, what the hell is this?
[02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:33.510]  Candy corns, loose.
[02:25:36.310 --> 02:25:39.470]  The Halloween version of the Peeps.
[02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:41.070]  That shit was gross to me too.
[02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:43.110]  Pumpkins, yeah, horrible.
[02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:46.470]  No, I can't do it.
[02:25:46.470 --> 02:25:51.070]  Yeah, like gotta have like that hierarchy of candy,
[02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:54.350]  you know, like strictly go for, all right, real quick.
[02:25:54.350 --> 02:25:57.990]  What's like the first candy bar y'all went for in the bag?
[02:25:58.990 --> 02:26:01.670]  Peanut butter M&Ms.
[02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:02.510]  Peanut butter M&Ms.
[02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:05.070]  I was a Snickers guy.
[02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:06.830]  Or Butterfingers for a while.
[02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:08.190]  Baby Ruth.
[02:26:08.190 --> 02:26:09.030]  Baby Ruth over here.
[02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:10.270]  Like a Baby Ruth too.
[02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:11.230]  That is so good.
[02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:13.630]  I mean, Snickers, Snickers, yeah, solid.
[02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.950]  Oh man.
[02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:16.790]  I was supposed to take it away from Ken.
[02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:17.630]  You got living soil?
[02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:18.470]  Ken, I was gonna say.
[02:26:18.470 --> 02:26:20.350]  We gotta get back on track.
[02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:22.830]  I was gonna say back on track with the kids though.
[02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:25.270]  Like, you know, what I saw at the farm,
[02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:27.430]  kids were like really weird about trying stuff,
[02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:29.190]  like tasting something and they were just like,
[02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:30.630]  usually didn't want to do it.
[02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:34.990]  But there was a few times where I would like give a kid
[02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:37.270]  a fresh watermelon, like right out of the field.
[02:26:37.710 --> 02:26:39.630]  I made sure it was like a good one.
[02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:42.390]  You know, I was like, yeah, this is like
[02:26:42.390 --> 02:26:44.030]  the best watermelon you're ever gonna have
[02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:45.830]  grown in like regenerative soil.
[02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:46.670]  Full spike.
[02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:48.310]  This is as good as it gets right here.
[02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:50.990]  And I had a few kids be like, this is the best.
[02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:52.150]  I don't like melons.
[02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:53.030]  I don't like watermelons.
[02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:55.310]  This is the best one I've ever had, like hands down.
[02:26:55.310 --> 02:26:57.270]  And they loved it and they couldn't get enough.
[02:26:57.270 --> 02:27:00.790]  So like when you introduce kids to a good alternative,
[02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:02.990]  like, I don't know, just start with like really good berry,
[02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:05.030]  like raspberries and berries and stuff,
[02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:08.350]  kids will just like go to town on that stuff.
[02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:11.430]  And then you see kids like Michael Judd
[02:27:11.430 --> 02:27:12.990]  going back to him again, like his kid,
[02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:15.190]  and he was just growing up on this fruit.
[02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:18.590]  And that's super inspirational to me seeing that.
[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:20.510]  But yeah, when you give kids an opportunity
[02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:23.710]  to try something that's really grown well,
[02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:25.710]  and back to the living soil,
[02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:27.710]  the living soil is how you get the flavor,
[02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:29.270]  you know, talking about turps and cannabis,
[02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:31.630]  like the flavor in food,
[02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:35.190]  when you grow in really good soil is just
[02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:41.230]  on another level, similar to how, you know, cannabis is,
[02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:42.950]  you know, if you really put that love into it
[02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:45.230]  and really do it right, it reflects back
[02:27:45.230 --> 02:27:46.310]  and you experience that.
[02:27:46.310 --> 02:27:48.390]  And it's, you know, got a higher nutrient density
[02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:49.230]  in addition to that.
[02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:50.470]  So it's medicine.
[02:27:50.470 --> 02:27:52.710]  So, but yeah, the kids really know that
[02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:55.390]  when they experience it, it's like an intuitive thing
[02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:58.630]  that I hope more kids get excited about that
[02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:59.470]  and less about the candy,
[02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:01.550]  because the candy culture is insane to me.
[02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:04.390]  And like, we wonder why we have all these health problems
[02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:07.830]  as a society, like we have to maybe take it
[02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:08.910]  a little more seriously.
[02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:12.350]  Like, this is like a cocaine level addictive substance
[02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.470]  that we, like kids have every year.
[02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:15.310]  And I'm not trying to villainize,
[02:28:15.310 --> 02:28:16.830]  I'm not trying to get on a pedestal at all.
[02:28:16.830 --> 02:28:19.630]  Like I love eating some ice cream here, like, you know,
[02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:20.750]  but just moderation more
[02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:22.310]  and learning what it actually is doing
[02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:25.510]  and finding replacements for like, you know,
[02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:26.870]  you want a sweet snack,
[02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:29.910]  eat a fig that actually balances your blood sugar well,
[02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:34.110]  doesn't send you on a crash that you're then depressed from.
[02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:35.470]  Because that, you know, this is all,
[02:28:35.470 --> 02:28:36.750]  we're learning this is all interconnected
[02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:37.750]  to mental health really.
[02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:41.590]  Like if you're feeding your gut microbiome poorly,
[02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:44.310]  or if the soil that your food is grown in,
[02:28:44.310 --> 02:28:48.190]  that microbiome is not fed and nurtured properly,
[02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:49.790]  the whole system isn't gonna work properly
[02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:51.270]  and you get sick or you get depressed
[02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:52.110]  or any of these things.
[02:28:52.110 --> 02:28:55.310]  Like all these things are, you know, in my opinion,
[02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:58.390]  go back to the root, which is taking care of our food system
[02:28:58.390 --> 02:29:00.430]  and taking care of our soil, so.
[02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:03.390]  Yeah, way to bring it back, Pete.
[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:06.950]  Definitely too much sugar will spoil your garden.
[02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:10.070]  I say that all the time with the sugary inputs,
[02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.990]  just like with your body,
[02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:12.390]  you don't wanna eat too much of that too.
[02:29:12.390 --> 02:29:13.790]  So yeah, good deal.
[02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:15.870]  But yeah, I'm like you, man.
[02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:16.930]  I do love my sweets,
[02:29:16.930 --> 02:29:19.510]  but I think if you bring a child up a little bit more on,
[02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:21.910]  that's a treat, sweet treat,
[02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:25.670]  not every meal sweet, Pop-Tarts, boom, boom, cereal,
[02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:26.830]  you know, all that all day,
[02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:28.310]  I think you can kind of get a little bit,
[02:29:28.310 --> 02:29:30.110]  starting out to get a little better.
[02:29:32.470 --> 02:29:35.590]  Pop-Tarts, dude, I remember the toastal strudels.
[02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:38.110]  You got to put that hot icing on that shit yourself.
[02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:39.110]  Spread it on there yourself.
[02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:40.430]  Talk about turps.
[02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:44.030]  Yeah, I was the icing thief in the house.
[02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:45.510]  I gotta admit that.
[02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:48.870]  Yeah, y'all had money, y'all had toastal strudel.
[02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:50.670]  Man, we did not have money, dog.
[02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:54.750]  Hey, that was a treat when you got them toastal strudel.
[02:29:54.750 --> 02:29:56.470]  Them bad boys went quick.
[02:29:56.470 --> 02:29:58.390]  No doubt, they only had like four in a pack.
[02:29:58.390 --> 02:30:00.030]  That was the problem.
[02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:01.870]  You know, when you're poor,
[02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:04.310]  like when you need the nutrients the most,
[02:30:04.310 --> 02:30:06.750]  that's not what they give you.
[02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:08.270]  All this stuff that can break down
[02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:09.990]  is usually just thrown in a dumpster
[02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:11.150]  because they can get sued,
[02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:13.190]  or people get sick, or all these.
[02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:15.430]  So what they, or at least in Georgia,
[02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:18.110]  what they were giving to my family growing up
[02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:20.230]  was all the processed foods.
[02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:21.310]  So that's why I meant by like,
[02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:22.710]  I really started to pay attention
[02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:24.230]  when the Oreos took down.
[02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:25.670]  I was a lot older when that happened,
[02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:29.310]  but no one when I grew up was ever saying like,
[02:30:29.310 --> 02:30:32.110]  hey, this chicken is different than this chicken.
[02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:35.390]  It was like, yeah, why would you spend $10 for something
[02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:36.990]  when you can get it for two?
[02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:39.110]  And no one ever made that correlation,
[02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:41.070]  at least in my family, for a long time.
[02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:45.390]  So you gotta break that cycle if you grow up.
[02:30:45.390 --> 02:30:47.310]  Yeah, miseducation on.
[02:30:47.310 --> 02:30:50.350]  Yeah, it really is an access and education issue
[02:30:50.390 --> 02:30:51.270]  in so many ways.
[02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:56.270]  And most of us are fortunate to be turned onto that,
[02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:58.350]  how much food matters in our life,
[02:30:58.350 --> 02:30:59.670]  but a lot of people just have no idea
[02:30:59.670 --> 02:31:01.030]  and haven't ever had the opportunity
[02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:03.470]  to have a conversation about it.
[02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:06.910]  So yeah, that's all I really wanna say.
[02:31:06.910 --> 02:31:08.110]  But yeah, it really is.
[02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:09.710]  The more people are out there talking about it,
[02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:13.830]  meeting other people, making fun, inspiring social media,
[02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:15.670]  that again, just gets people into it
[02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:16.990]  who might not be into it.
[02:31:16.990 --> 02:31:20.110]  I think that's sort of like a barrier point.
[02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:24.550]  People who know all this super important,
[02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:27.110]  but also kind of nerdy stuff when we really get into it,
[02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:29.350]  how do we make that super palatable
[02:31:29.350 --> 02:31:31.230]  to a really wide audience
[02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:34.590]  and get people as excited about living soil
[02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:39.590]  as whatever other mindless media they consume?
[02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:43.750]  Again, just replace it with some good stuff.
[02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:44.710]  We can make it entertaining.
[02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:46.710]  And I don't know, I feel like sometimes
[02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:50.110]  we almost have to just make it super silly
[02:31:50.110 --> 02:31:51.990]  and goofy and funny just to get people
[02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:53.270]  more attracted to the community.
[02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:54.990]  Like, yeah, come on, this is fun stuff, dude.
[02:31:54.990 --> 02:31:58.030]  It's not just like, we're not only prepping
[02:31:58.030 --> 02:32:00.070]  for a collapse of a food system.
[02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:02.630]  It's super fun to hang out with all your homies
[02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:05.390]  and geek out over the unique turps
[02:32:05.390 --> 02:32:07.710]  on your seedling weed plants.
[02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:08.710]  It's just fun.
[02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:11.310]  And then to eat a home-cooked dinner, it's all fun.
[02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:13.190]  So if everyone could get a taste of that,
[02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:14.590]  which a lot of people just don't have access
[02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:16.350]  or the privilege or the awareness,
[02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:19.710]  yeah, we need more of that.
[02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:21.670]  We need more opportunity for people
[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:24.350]  to learn about good food.
[02:32:24.350 --> 02:32:25.590]  And I was really grateful, again,
[02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:28.230]  going back to my career the past few years,
[02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:30.070]  all the, a lot of the food in the food bank
[02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:31.950]  can be a lot of this processed food
[02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:34.310]  that's just built the store for a long time
[02:32:34.310 --> 02:32:37.550]  and isn't really that actually nutritional.
[02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:39.950]  So being able to provide for like a farmer's market setup
[02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:42.750]  where it was like day after it was harvested,
[02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:44.030]  it was right there ready.
[02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:46.350]  You know, and I didn't actually get a chance
[02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:48.630]  to go to the farm stand myself.
[02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:49.470]  I wish I would have.
[02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:50.790]  And I hope to do it in the future
[02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:51.710]  and meet some of the people
[02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:54.390]  that were eating everything over the years.
[02:32:54.390 --> 02:32:56.510]  But yeah, I think another thing,
[02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:59.830]  I'm hopeful that everyone knows how to fully prepare
[02:32:59.830 --> 02:33:00.750]  all the variety of vegetables.
[02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:01.750]  Cause like I've been a member
[02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:03.910]  of a really diverse CSA for years.
[02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:04.950]  And sometimes I get a vegetable,
[02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:06.870]  I'm like, I don't quite know what to do with this right now.
[02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:08.910]  Like, you know, and so more community,
[02:33:08.910 --> 02:33:10.830]  like cooking events where it's like,
[02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:13.110]  how do I make this thing that grows well here?
[02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:14.830]  But like, what the hell is it?
[02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:15.990]  Like kind of tastes weird.
[02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.830]  Like what can we do?
[02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:17.670]  You know, there's a lot of learning.
[02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:19.710]  Something besides just butter.
[02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:21.430]  Yeah, something besides, I mean, butter always helps,
[02:33:21.430 --> 02:33:23.150]  but something besides just butter.
[02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:26.710]  Anyway, that's pretty much all I have to say on that.
[02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:27.870]  But no doubt.
[02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:32.190]  Yeah, so I believe a few of us
[02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:34.670]  have a lot of time restraints today.
[02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:36.550]  So in honor of that,
[02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:39.110]  we're gonna get out into the questions here.
[02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:40.950]  I believe we have a few of them behind the scenes.
[02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:42.830]  So Ken, if you wanted to start.
[02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:44.630]  Ken, present yourself.
[02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:45.910]  There you go.
[02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:49.670]  I am back from hiding in the lurker tree in the background.
[02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:50.510]  Oh, yay.
[02:33:52.390 --> 02:33:54.910]  Well, just switch me around here to a place
[02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:58.950]  where we're cutting off my face with the questions.
[02:33:58.950 --> 02:34:00.830]  So, okay.
[02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:02.910]  So we'll start with,
[02:34:02.910 --> 02:34:07.910]  is that Stillwater, Oklahoma for your plants there?
[02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.900]  Oh, you must be muted.
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:16.500]  My bad, my bad.
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:20.820]  That's Stillwater Earthworks in Reading, Pennsylvania.
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:25.300]  See, that's a really quick question, you know.
[02:34:26.940 --> 02:34:31.940]  When should I add mycorrhizae in the nutrient solution?
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:37.540]  Nutrient solution.
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.300]  I wouldn't necessarily add mycorrhizae
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:43.260]  to my nutrient solutions.
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:46.140]  My advice would be to add mycorrhizae
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.820]  like as like a top dressing to your soil.
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:54.180]  And more just put things that mycorrhizae
[02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:55.300]  are gonna wanna eat, you know,
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.780]  especially if you get like an indigenous microbe culture
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:34:59.300]  from Marco or something,
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.020]  all those different fungus are in there, man.
[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:04.740]  So if you put the right food for them,
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:05.980]  you don't have to add some other
[02:35:05.980 --> 02:35:09.380]  like powdered mycorrhizae nutrient thing, you know.
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:11.340]  It really needs to create a living system.
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:14.140]  And that's all about feeding it what it wants to eat
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:15.780]  and taking care of it, keeping it covered,
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:18.340]  keeping the moisture where it wants to be.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:19.940]  You know, for fungus to thrive,
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:22.780]  they really want the right moisture levels at all times.
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.620]  So they're pretty sensitive to that.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:26.260]  I mean, they'll rebound if they dry out,
[02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:28.820]  but it's good to keep it flowing the whole time
[02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:30.260]  with moisture.
[02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:34.100]  And we're not gonna, we're talking not buying that.
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:36.100]  We're talking about collecting IMO
[02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.860]  is where you should start, so.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:38.700]  Yeah.
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.900]  Yeah, but I would buy some.
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.100]  I would buy some from Marco though to boost your,
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:45.500]  I'm just gonna say that, man.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:48.420]  Like you've done a lot of work for people.
[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:51.380]  Yeah, when it's available, this stuff you have, man,
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.460]  it really helps bring in a nice diversity.
[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:54.580]  But yeah, collect it yourself too.
[02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:55.660]  It's everywhere, so.
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:58.100]  I wanna add to that,
[02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:00.540]  that cannabis has been known to have
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:03.660]  endo and ectomycorrhizal relationships.
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:07.060]  So like upon transplant,
[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:10.340]  if you can introduce those endo and ectomycorrhizal
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:11.700]  directly to the roots,
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:15.900]  then you'll have a really great jumping off.
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:17.740]  And if you were to add something,
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:20.180]  it that would probably be like the crucial time.
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.220]  Okay.
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:27.500]  So the next one, I'm not quite sure on the question.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:31.940]  I heard the indigenous used to make acorn flour,
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:34.580]  pancakes and maple syrup.
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:35.460]  Yes, please.
[02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:38.700]  Why don't we use acorns now?
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:43.340]  We just forgot really.
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:44.340]  I mean, that's it.
[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:48.220]  And there's a whole industry built around annual production
[02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:50.740]  that's pretty corrupt and pushes corn products
[02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:52.420]  and all that.
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.180]  So you're fighting big money too.
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:55.500]  And just saying,
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.340]  in a forgotten indigenous way that we need to bring back.
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:00.660]  So yeah.
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:02.500]  Yeah.
[02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:06.660]  It's one of the many indigenous technologies that were lost,
[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:07.540]  which is a shame,
[02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:11.700]  but I guess inspirational that it wasn't totally lost.
[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:13.780]  You know, we know that it happened.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:15.260]  So what can you do,
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:17.260]  but try to pick up the pieces
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:19.420]  and keep working with those plants.
[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:24.980]  But they made, they want us to forget.
[02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:28.220]  They didn't, we didn't just walk down the street and forgot.
[02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:31.900]  There was a strategic thing for them to make us forget
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:33.900]  these native principles and tactics.
[02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:37.180]  And that's why people like us are keeping that fight alive.
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:38.140]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:38.980]  Totally.
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:41.060]  All types of shaming people out of their culture.
[02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:44.340]  And yeah, there's,
[02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:48.060]  I feel like there's a great resurgence happening now.
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:49.380]  So let's just hope.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.540]  Oh, definitely.
[02:37:54.540 --> 02:37:56.500]  And I think a lot of it is we can go back
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.900]  in the old literature from, you know,
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:02.060]  hundreds of years ago and find these kinds of recipes.
[02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:03.540]  They're still there.
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:05.340]  We just have to dig for them though.
[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:09.860]  So this one for Marco.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:14.860]  Hey Marco, if any VA locals that break out with skunk phenos
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:19.100]  after skunk con 11 or 11, 12, 22,
[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:24.100]  can you or affiliates get it put into region late entry?
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:29.180]  Man, play by the rules, bro.
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:31.940]  It says 11, 12, it's 11, 12.
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:35.060]  Okay.
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:36.380]  That's what I would stick with.
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:38.940]  You know, he's talking about skunk con coming up.
[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:41.060]  I understand your timing might be off,
[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:42.660]  but I know they pushed it out.
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:47.180]  I'm not, I might ask if my shit was late,
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:49.020]  but I'm not just gonna go out there
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:51.100]  and asking for somebody else who's late.
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.140]  You feel me?
[02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:53.140]  Much love though.
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:55.420]  Okay. Yeah.
[02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:59.420]  So do is the goose and gander kind of come to mind
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:00.700]  on that one, Marco?
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.860]  I mean, you know, I'll have my stuff in early, bro.
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:06.340]  I'm an early gander.
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:07.780]  Yeah. Same with me.
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:10.060]  I'd rather be 10 minutes early to a meeting
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:11.740]  than five minutes late, you know?
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:13.380]  Thank you.
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:16.580]  So who has the answer to this one?
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:20.060]  Is HID or LED more organic?
[02:39:24.250 --> 02:39:26.770]  That sounds like a trick question to me.
[02:39:26.770 --> 02:39:28.250]  Yeah, right.
[02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:30.130]  Well, the sun's the most organic.
[02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:32.210]  I think closer would be the LEDs
[02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:34.330]  because it does cover a larger spectrum
[02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:36.410]  where the HLDs just don't.
[02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:37.250]  But that's my-
[02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:39.130]  But see, then they're gonna get into how they're made
[02:39:39.130 --> 02:39:41.130]  and what was in the carbon footprint.
[02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:42.250]  I don't know all that.
[02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:45.370]  I know LEDs are way cheaper,
[02:39:45.370 --> 02:39:47.090]  but that just means I run more.
[02:39:48.930 --> 02:39:51.170]  You can have a bigger grow that way.
[02:39:51.210 --> 02:39:53.090]  Okay, so hemp trees.
[02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:55.050]  How tall can hemp get?
[02:39:57.050 --> 02:39:58.730]  It's a lot of the same genetics.
[02:39:59.730 --> 02:40:01.610]  They can become monsters, you know?
[02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:04.770]  I mean, especially like the industrial hemp,
[02:40:04.770 --> 02:40:07.530]  like that stuff can go 10, 12 feet tall,
[02:40:07.530 --> 02:40:10.810]  but like, yeah, I don't know.
[02:40:10.810 --> 02:40:15.810]  My buddy grew some like 12, 10, 12 foot hemp flower plants
[02:40:16.810 --> 02:40:21.810]  like in Robisonia and Berks County this year.
[02:40:21.970 --> 02:40:22.810]  Phenomenal.
[02:40:22.810 --> 02:40:24.970]  So yeah, pretty much as big
[02:40:24.970 --> 02:40:26.850]  as a regular cannabis plant could get.
[02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:30.610]  And isn't that kind of strain specific
[02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:33.410]  because you've got different types of hemp plants
[02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:36.770]  where some are a short fiber and some are a longer fiber.
[02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:39.770]  I think the longer fiber can grow up to 25 feet
[02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:40.890]  or something like that.
[02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:43.010]  Oh, I bet.
[02:40:43.010 --> 02:40:44.610]  Yeah, I'm not an expert on that.
[02:40:44.610 --> 02:40:47.890]  I bet, yeah, I'm not an expert, but like it's, yeah.
[02:40:47.890 --> 02:40:49.690]  I mean, yeah, maybe they were looking
[02:40:49.690 --> 02:40:54.690]  for some concrete numbers and some ultimatums, but large.
[02:40:54.730 --> 02:40:56.130]  Ain't gonna happen here.
[02:40:57.770 --> 02:41:00.530]  He's not on that question anyway.
[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:01.450]  So here we go.
[02:41:01.450 --> 02:41:04.730]  I heard wasps are good predator bugs.
[02:41:04.730 --> 02:41:05.790]  Is that true?
[02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:09.410]  And this might be more of a question for me
[02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:11.850]  because I am a half-assed bee guy.
[02:41:12.770 --> 02:41:15.690]  Certain wasps are, or all wasps are predators.
[02:41:15.690 --> 02:41:18.130]  They are carnivores.
[02:41:18.130 --> 02:41:20.130]  Some wasps, a paper wasp,
[02:41:20.130 --> 02:41:23.210]  you don't have to worry about too much of them attacking you.
[02:41:23.210 --> 02:41:24.510]  Most other species,
[02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:26.830]  you have to worry about them attacking you.
[02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:31.210]  So that's the basic answer for that one.
[02:41:31.210 --> 02:41:35.730]  And then this one, yes, I do talk about catching wild swarms
[02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:37.570]  and that is of the honeybee.
[02:41:37.570 --> 02:41:39.890]  And the honeybee is the only bee
[02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:43.210]  that will survive in a hive over winter.
[02:41:43.210 --> 02:41:47.970]  Every other type of bee, it's a crapshoot.
[02:41:47.970 --> 02:41:50.050]  They go into a hibernation mode
[02:41:50.050 --> 02:41:53.850]  and then the queens come out in the spring and restart.
[02:41:53.850 --> 02:41:56.930]  But if you're putting up mason bee habitat,
[02:41:56.930 --> 02:41:59.570]  definitely any type of habitat
[02:41:59.570 --> 02:42:04.570]  for beneficial insects is always good, always.
[02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:08.870]  Hey Ken, is it bees or wasps that live in the ground as well?
[02:42:10.370 --> 02:42:14.010]  Your bumblebee will actually live underground,
[02:42:14.010 --> 02:42:16.410]  but generally speaking, it is your wasp,
[02:42:16.410 --> 02:42:18.890]  your yellow jackets that are underground.
[02:42:18.890 --> 02:42:21.870]  Honeybees will not live underground.
[02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:25.330]  Your mud daubers, they will live in the ground as well.
[02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:27.890]  But unless you're in the mud flats,
[02:42:27.890 --> 02:42:30.970]  you're not generally gonna see the mud dauber type of wasp.
[02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:37.650]  So then question, oh, no, that's, was that one.
[02:42:37.650 --> 02:42:39.810]  So we'll go to the next one.
[02:42:40.090 --> 02:42:42.450]  What is a selection of fruit trees
[02:42:42.450 --> 02:42:45.470]  that will supply food all year round?
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:54.480]  I mean, that's a very specific question
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.720]  depending on where you live, what your situation is.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:42:59.840]  There's not like one tree necessarily
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:02.960]  that produces a year round crop that I know of.
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:06.640]  It's like, just perpetual feeding tree or something.
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:08.160]  If that's what you're asking, I'm not totally sure.
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:09.200]  Matt, do you have any,
[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:12.320]  I say plant diverse amounts of trees
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.600]  that can be staggered to get different yields
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:15.420]  at different times.
[02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:19.400]  If you're like looking at setting up a farm system,
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:22.200]  you know, like diversity is better,
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.120]  have different varieties to get different harvest
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:26.120]  at different times.
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:31.060]  Matt, did you wanna go for that?
[02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:35.020]  Yeah, because I feel like there's probably
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:37.160]  a more concrete answer for the tropics.
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:41.140]  I imagine that there's some like tree
[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:44.180]  that has edible leaves and then produces fruit.
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:46.620]  So there's like some aspect of that plant
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:49.800]  that you could just be eating all year long in the tropics.
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:52.200]  But up here in the temperate region,
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.780]  I mean, like I like to try to answer it with something.
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:43:58.380]  And I think of like mulberry trees,
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:01.220]  like their leaves are delicious and edible.
[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:03.860]  And you know, like they'll keep regenerating their leaves
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:06.100]  if you pick them even hard, a lot of them.
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:08.260]  So as soon as they pop out in the spring
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.180]  and then a lot of mulberries also produce fruit
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:13.620]  for the majority of the growing season,
[02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:16.820]  like into now, like November.
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:19.460]  So mulberries are pretty awesome.
[02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:22.260]  Yeah, I hadn't heard that.
[02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:24.580]  That's why it was part of the nursery rhyme
[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:26.020]  that we've all heard like growing up
[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:28.940]  is because it was like actually a nutrient dense food.
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:31.100]  So everybody wanted to, you know,
[02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:33.080]  here we go around the mulberry bush.
[02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:35.140]  Yeah, it's wild.
[02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:35.980]  I love that.
[02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:37.580]  Yeah.
[02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:38.420]  I love that.
[02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:40.100]  Like, you know, there are certain trees
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:43.180]  that like their stories are embedded in us.
[02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:45.020]  But like, you know, we might not know.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:46.060]  On the apple seed?
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:47.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:48.940]  But like, you know, something like the mulberry tree,
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:50.660]  like I don't know if I knew how to like, you know,
[02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:53.020]  identify mulberry tree until, you know,
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:55.740]  teenage or early 20s or something like that.
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:59.340]  But I knew what it was ever since I was like two or three,
[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:02.460]  you know, I just think that's interesting.
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:03.700]  It's part of our culture.
[02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:05.660]  Definitely.
[02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:07.980]  And then you can get up into Canada where I am
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:09.500]  and nothing grows year round here.
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:10.340]  Okay.
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:11.160]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:12.160]  We get too much white.
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:15.780]  True.
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:18.580]  So Aussie Grow Show,
[02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:22.540]  what is everyone's idea of environmentally friendly
[02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:27.300]  and sustainable cannabis industries and marketplace?
[02:45:30.690 --> 02:45:32.110]  As in brands?
[02:45:33.690 --> 02:45:34.530]  Like you say-
[02:45:34.850 --> 02:45:36.410]  Overall.
[02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:39.050]  Is he saying like what this facility would look like,
[02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:43.250]  meaning living soil beds, meaning using natural inputs,
[02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:45.290]  meaning, you know, chopping grass.
[02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:49.410]  I think it's more of a three hour show question
[02:45:49.410 --> 02:45:51.810]  to answer that particular question.
[02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:54.970]  But the things we talk about here,
[02:45:54.970 --> 02:45:57.130]  these living soils, step one to be,
[02:45:57.130 --> 02:45:59.330]  if you want to be super environmental,
[02:45:59.330 --> 02:46:01.770]  start there with your large growth, you know,
[02:46:01.770 --> 02:46:03.730]  and then go, you know, work from there.
[02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:06.090]  Definitely.
[02:46:06.090 --> 02:46:07.770]  Definitely.
[02:46:07.770 --> 02:46:09.730]  So then we got the last question
[02:46:09.730 --> 02:46:11.770]  that we've got on the board here is,
[02:46:11.770 --> 02:46:16.410]  what do you guys know about the fig tree business?
[02:46:18.490 --> 02:46:21.330]  I know that I will buy fig trees from you
[02:46:21.330 --> 02:46:22.850]  and I know that I'm not alone.
[02:46:22.850 --> 02:46:26.490]  I know I love to eat figs, but nothing about the business.
[02:46:26.490 --> 02:46:28.930]  I mean, you know, I haven't read up on that.
[02:46:28.930 --> 02:46:33.930]  I know the fruit don't store well to be shipped live.
[02:46:34.290 --> 02:46:37.290]  So a lot of times they'll dry them
[02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:40.170]  and that's a big part of the fruit industry, I do know.
[02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:42.690]  I like dry figs too, you know,
[02:46:42.690 --> 02:46:44.290]  when they're done right and they're not too hard,
[02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:46.410]  but that's me.
[02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:50.850]  Matt.
[02:46:50.850 --> 02:46:54.050]  So I'm on the border of like where figs
[02:46:54.050 --> 02:46:57.650]  will really grow outside being zone six
[02:46:57.650 --> 02:46:58.970]  here in Pennsylvania.
[02:47:00.130 --> 02:47:01.610]  So there's really not like,
[02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:05.930]  I can't really picture like a sustainable industry
[02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:09.290]  around here for figs because they need to be
[02:47:09.290 --> 02:47:12.530]  climate controlled and to be like in a hoop house at least,
[02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:14.210]  most likely a greenhouse.
[02:47:14.210 --> 02:47:15.850]  I mean, you can grow them against like your house
[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:18.050]  and have a little thermal mass or like in the cities,
[02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:19.810]  but like as far as like, you know,
[02:47:19.810 --> 02:47:22.010]  being a major fruit producer,
[02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:24.450]  it's really not feasible around here.
[02:47:24.450 --> 02:47:26.490]  The one thing that is feasible is
[02:47:27.490 --> 02:47:31.290]  like growing out fig trees for propagation
[02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:33.490]  because they propagate real easily.
[02:47:33.490 --> 02:47:35.370]  Still, they need climate control.
[02:47:35.370 --> 02:47:38.890]  Like you can't have the roots die back because of cold.
[02:47:38.890 --> 02:47:40.570]  So you can like bring them into your basement
[02:47:40.570 --> 02:47:42.530]  in the winter or something like around like 40 degrees
[02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:43.370]  or whatever.
[02:47:43.370 --> 02:47:48.370]  But yeah, as far as like fig fruit industry,
[02:47:48.850 --> 02:47:51.690]  where I live, it's all zone dependent,
[02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:52.530]  you know what I mean?
[02:47:52.530 --> 02:47:54.130]  You don't wanna try too hard to grow anything.
[02:47:54.570 --> 02:47:58.610]  I don't, but you could, but they said fig trees.
[02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:01.410]  So I was like, yeah, you can do potted plants, no doubt.
[02:48:01.410 --> 02:48:03.890]  Like you could grow them out and take hella cuttings
[02:48:03.890 --> 02:48:05.410]  and put them in dirt.
[02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:06.850]  They grow roots easily.
[02:48:06.850 --> 02:48:10.930]  So two ways to look at it.
[02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:14.450]  I know that there's a couple of startups
[02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:16.930]  and I don't know if all of them are still in business
[02:48:16.930 --> 02:48:20.730]  here in Boulder where their focus was on the date.
[02:48:20.730 --> 02:48:22.530]  I don't know if that's maybe like better,
[02:48:22.530 --> 02:48:24.730]  has lower sugar and all those things.
[02:48:24.730 --> 02:48:27.330]  So if a lot of those companies are popping up over
[02:48:27.330 --> 02:48:30.050]  and you do some background check on this stuff.
[02:48:30.050 --> 02:48:31.570]  But I think the date might be something
[02:48:31.570 --> 02:48:34.010]  that there's not enough people growing.
[02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:36.290]  So that might be a nice little niche for people
[02:48:36.290 --> 02:48:38.770]  that have the means to be able to do that.
[02:48:38.770 --> 02:48:41.010]  Dates are from palm trees though.
[02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:43.050]  That's where dates come from.
[02:48:43.050 --> 02:48:44.130]  So you go-
[02:48:44.130 --> 02:48:46.610]  So very specific locations.
[02:48:46.610 --> 02:48:49.730]  Yeah, so they probably had a plug and we're getting them
[02:48:49.770 --> 02:48:52.690]  because they wouldn't grow in Colorado, I wouldn't think.
[02:48:54.690 --> 02:48:56.450]  I don't like dates as much for some reason.
[02:48:56.450 --> 02:48:58.650]  They got a weird texture to them.
[02:48:58.650 --> 02:49:02.210]  I'm all about the people are making it into like a spread
[02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:05.690]  with like a jam or jelly and they're selling it in Boulder.
[02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:10.250]  There's this famous brand called Bobo bars
[02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:11.450]  out of Boulder as well.
[02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:13.970]  So if you're truly thinking about getting
[02:49:13.970 --> 02:49:17.450]  into that kind of stuff, I would research some of that stuff.
[02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:19.130]  There's a lady that has a whole brand
[02:49:19.530 --> 02:49:22.250]  that just sells like jams with breading.
[02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:24.330]  Yeah, think about it.
[02:49:24.330 --> 02:49:26.330]  You're just taking a piece like we always do
[02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:29.330]  and it's a piece of the puzzle and making it your own lane.
[02:49:32.650 --> 02:49:34.410]  Thank you, Stilly Louie.
[02:49:34.410 --> 02:49:36.170]  All right, do we have any more questions
[02:49:36.170 --> 02:49:38.650]  or might be able to rock out here?
[02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:41.930]  Ken, you are muted, sir.
[02:49:43.050 --> 02:49:44.570]  Yeah, thanks Ken.
[02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:47.690]  Thank you guys for hosting this.
[02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:51.290]  This has been really dope to just talk with y'all.
[02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:53.610]  Like, yeah, man, I don't know.
[02:49:53.610 --> 02:49:55.090]  I'm always up for conversations
[02:49:55.090 --> 02:49:56.570]  about elevated stuff like this.
[02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:59.530]  So I just leave feeling inspired
[02:49:59.530 --> 02:50:02.330]  and more like online with my purpose.
[02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:04.290]  And honestly, like I'm inspired
[02:50:04.290 --> 02:50:08.450]  to host more connections like this, like you guys are.
[02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:10.250]  You want me to get more people together
[02:50:10.250 --> 02:50:12.730]  with intentions that are aligned.
[02:50:12.730 --> 02:50:15.690]  So hell yeah, thank you guys.
[02:50:15.690 --> 02:50:16.810]  Thanks for having me.
[02:50:16.930 --> 02:50:18.290]  Yeah, much love and respect guys.
[02:50:18.290 --> 02:50:20.570]  Really appreciate you giving us this opportunity
[02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:22.330]  to share what we're into.
[02:50:22.330 --> 02:50:24.370]  And hopefully, it wasn't all cannabis talk,
[02:50:24.370 --> 02:50:27.610]  but hopefully people got some different perspective
[02:50:27.610 --> 02:50:29.530]  and something cool to take away from it.
[02:50:29.530 --> 02:50:31.610]  So really appreciate it.
[02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:33.890]  Oh, it was an amazing conversation, guys.
[02:50:33.890 --> 02:50:35.770]  I know I learned a lot today
[02:50:35.770 --> 02:50:37.890]  and that's one of the reasons I love
[02:50:37.890 --> 02:50:40.570]  to actually be able to sit back where nobody can see me
[02:50:40.570 --> 02:50:42.810]  because then I can really try to focus
[02:50:42.810 --> 02:50:45.290]  on what you guys are trying to share.
[02:50:45.330 --> 02:50:46.890]  And you guys are amazing.
[02:50:46.890 --> 02:50:49.610]  And thank you very much from the bottom of my heart
[02:50:49.610 --> 02:50:52.090]  for coming on and sharing the knowledge
[02:50:52.090 --> 02:50:55.090]  and your zest for life
[02:50:55.090 --> 02:50:57.530]  and the reason that you're doing this to help people.
[02:50:57.530 --> 02:51:00.250]  And it's a wonderful thing you guys are doing.
[02:51:00.250 --> 02:51:02.610]  Yes, I always say, man, I'm like,
[02:51:02.610 --> 02:51:05.250]  I bring these people on here because I want to learn.
[02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:07.450]  And so that's what we do, man.
[02:51:07.450 --> 02:51:10.050]  I appreciate y'all for sharing what y'all know.
[02:51:10.050 --> 02:51:12.930]  Some of what y'all know, I always tell people,
[02:51:12.930 --> 02:51:14.090]  you just know what I told you.
[02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:16.090]  You don't know everything.
[02:51:16.090 --> 02:51:18.090]  So yeah, appreciate y'all for sharing
[02:51:18.090 --> 02:51:19.450]  what you share with us, man.
[02:51:19.450 --> 02:51:22.690]  I took a lot of good notes mentally pretty much.
[02:51:22.690 --> 02:51:26.690]  And that fig spot, I just looked them up.
[02:51:26.690 --> 02:51:30.490]  It was like 170 different items.
[02:51:30.490 --> 02:51:31.970]  So yeah, much love with that.
[02:51:31.970 --> 02:51:33.810]  I'll be checking him out.
[02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:34.650]  Thank y'all, man.
[02:51:34.650 --> 02:51:35.490]  Great show.
[02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:37.610]  I love it when three hours goes pretty quick
[02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:40.610]  and everybody's got a role and I do as well.
[02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:43.850]  So we'll let Brian give it up for the last words here.
[02:51:44.850 --> 02:51:47.210]  Yeah, appreciate you gentlemen.
[02:51:47.210 --> 02:51:51.650]  Like he said, it's always been described to me as flow.
[02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:53.250]  When everybody's in it,
[02:51:53.250 --> 02:51:55.450]  that's where the time goes quickly.
[02:51:55.450 --> 02:51:58.250]  Supposedly that's why when your family's on vacation,
[02:51:58.250 --> 02:52:00.090]  everybody's enjoying everything together.
[02:52:00.090 --> 02:52:02.170]  That's why the week goes by so quickly
[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:04.050]  because everybody's in flow, everybody's connected,
[02:52:04.050 --> 02:52:05.370]  everybody's having fun.
[02:52:05.370 --> 02:52:07.370]  This was a fantastic show.
[02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:09.970]  I think there's a lot of ways that people can go back.
[02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:12.850]  Hopefully again, if you guys want to timestamp some stuff,
[02:52:12.890 --> 02:52:15.090]  really working with mother nature,
[02:52:15.090 --> 02:52:16.490]  growing food for kids.
[02:52:16.490 --> 02:52:18.010]  I mean, you boys are,
[02:52:18.010 --> 02:52:20.090]  and you got Gucci man in the headphones.
[02:52:20.090 --> 02:52:23.650]  So that's what we like is that balance in life.
[02:52:23.650 --> 02:52:26.650]  You gotta understand both sides of the world, I think,
[02:52:26.650 --> 02:52:29.450]  to truly find success.
[02:52:29.450 --> 02:52:30.490]  You gotta know that,
[02:52:31.530 --> 02:52:33.330]  like kind of Matt was getting at,
[02:52:33.330 --> 02:52:35.250]  you get to pick what you wanna do
[02:52:35.250 --> 02:52:37.050]  and there's a real beauty in that
[02:52:37.050 --> 02:52:38.730]  instead of waking up every day,
[02:52:38.730 --> 02:52:41.210]  just knowing that you gotta go to this individual
[02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:43.330]  and go to this individual.
[02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:45.930]  It just gets mundane, I think for anybody involved.
[02:52:47.810 --> 02:52:52.690]  Tomorrow we're interviewing Frenchie Cannoli's wife,
[02:52:52.690 --> 02:52:55.770]  which I think is paramount for,
[02:52:55.770 --> 02:52:57.290]  that's a latent connect, obviously.
[02:52:57.290 --> 02:53:00.090]  I don't have a Rolodex like that,
[02:53:00.090 --> 02:53:03.170]  but he reached out and she's willing to come on.
[02:53:03.170 --> 02:53:05.810]  I was able to throw a party once and he came
[02:53:05.810 --> 02:53:09.930]  and just the dude had a different light about him.
[02:53:10.170 --> 02:53:11.410]  He lit up the room,
[02:53:11.410 --> 02:53:14.130]  he was always getting the entire room stoned
[02:53:15.090 --> 02:53:16.770]  with the chillums and all that kind of stuff.
[02:53:16.770 --> 02:53:19.170]  So we're just kind of like celebrate his life,
[02:53:19.170 --> 02:53:21.850]  ask a lot of questions, reminisce.
[02:53:21.850 --> 02:53:24.730]  I even was able to trip with him one time,
[02:53:24.730 --> 02:53:26.250]  which I, you know,
[02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:28.370]  who the hell can kind of tell that kind of story?
[02:53:28.370 --> 02:53:31.090]  So there was just these small little moments in my life
[02:53:31.090 --> 02:53:32.650]  that when they were happening,
[02:53:32.650 --> 02:53:34.290]  they were still like pretty cool to me.
[02:53:34.290 --> 02:53:35.970]  But now looking back, it's like, man,
[02:53:35.970 --> 02:53:38.370]  talk about a small little outlier moment here
[02:53:38.930 --> 02:53:41.530]  and it was in Palm Springs, California.
[02:53:41.530 --> 02:53:43.770]  So just small moments in time
[02:53:43.770 --> 02:53:46.890]  that now are obviously forever treasured
[02:53:46.890 --> 02:53:47.770]  because he passed away
[02:53:47.770 --> 02:53:50.250]  and he seemed like he was always rocking
[02:53:50.250 --> 02:53:51.490]  and doing his thing.
[02:53:53.490 --> 02:53:54.650]  Then he would even have like,
[02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:56.690]  sometimes I felt like critics in the room.
[02:53:56.690 --> 02:53:58.210]  And then as he would discuss things
[02:53:58.210 --> 02:54:00.090]  and kind of explain things and talk to him
[02:54:00.090 --> 02:54:02.890]  after he gave his speech,
[02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:04.170]  walked down and like,
[02:54:04.170 --> 02:54:08.050]  he was a rock star from the day that I ever got to see him,
[02:54:08.410 --> 02:54:09.650]  publicly speak.
[02:54:09.650 --> 02:54:12.530]  So somebody that I think is gonna be dearly missed.
[02:54:12.530 --> 02:54:16.890]  And if you don't know who that is, you need to.
[02:54:16.890 --> 02:54:17.730]  Frenchie Cano.
[02:54:18.570 --> 02:54:19.410]  Yeah, look him up.
[02:54:19.410 --> 02:54:21.290]  Thank you, Miss Kimberly.
[02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:22.210]  See you tomorrow.
[02:54:23.610 --> 02:54:24.450]  Nice.
[02:54:24.450 --> 02:54:26.770]  Okay, guys, with that, I do have to bounce
[02:54:26.770 --> 02:54:28.530]  because I got another podcast to go on to.
[02:54:28.530 --> 02:54:30.050]  So love you all.
[02:54:30.050 --> 02:54:30.890]  See you tomorrow.
[02:54:30.890 --> 02:54:32.650]  Cheers, Ryan C. Chris.
[02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:33.810]  Thanks a lot, guys.
