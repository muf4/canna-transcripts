[00:03.580 --> 01:05.720]  Hey everybody, Chad Westport here, and I just wanted to say, damn, 2022 was a kick-ass year
[01:05.720 --> 01:12.280]  for everybody involved here at the Future Cannabis Project, FCPO2, and FCPO3.
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.640]  And I just want to say thank you to all of the guests that came on all of the shows,
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.120]  but also to the Friendly Cannabis Show. You know, this was a really fun year for me.
[01:22.120 --> 01:26.040]  Gotta check off kind of, you know, a lot of bucket list stuff talking to a few of these people.
[01:26.040 --> 01:32.120]  So I gotta give a big shout out to Peter, Peter Longpipes, the man who makes it all happen,
[01:32.120 --> 01:38.280]  the man with the vision who created this channel and built this channel over the many years,
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.760]  and allows us to prosper and enjoy and have fun and learn together. So Peter,
[01:44.760 --> 01:49.560]  thank you, man. Couldn't do it without you. And to all the other hosts on the channel,
[01:49.560 --> 01:56.360]  you know, Future Cannabis Project, we've got a number of shows here, FCPO2 and FCPO3.
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.920]  I don't want to name names because I don't want to leave anybody out. So be sure you check out
[02:00.920 --> 02:07.560]  all of the channels. Also hit up Dagga.Garden, check out some of the breeders that are going on
[02:07.560 --> 02:12.760]  and working with FCP. So it's really an amazing thing, but I'm rambling on. I just came here to
[02:12.760 --> 02:18.280]  say thank you. I appreciate it. And in the new year for the Friendly Cannabis Show,
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.720]  we're going to keep doing our thing. You know, the seed collector shows,
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.960]  I've actually got a special episode coming up for you. Well, we've got a whole bunch of them.
[02:25.960 --> 02:30.280]  They're booked out. So seed collectors episodes will continue. Also going to do something new and
[02:30.280 --> 02:37.640]  fun called Origin Stories, Fact or Fiction, which most of cannabis history is. So we're going to
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.560]  pick a place. We're going to pick a strain. We're going to start there. It's probably going to be
[02:41.560 --> 02:47.240]  more fiction than fact, but we're going to try to get to the bottom of it through you, through
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.880]  the Internet. And who knows, we may get a couple of these cool breeders on who really know some of
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.320]  these origin stories. That's the goal. I'm going to put the strain name out a week ahead. Tell me
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.480]  who I should talk to. Maybe we could all get in that person's ear and see if they want to come on
[03:01.480 --> 03:07.880]  the show that's scheduled for a week away. Origin Stories. So look forward to that in the new year.
[03:07.880 --> 03:12.840]  And thank you again for supporting the channel, for supporting me and for supporting everybody
[03:13.400 --> 03:21.240]  on the platform. Again, community, we rise up together. So thank you. Happy New Year's and enjoy your 2023.
