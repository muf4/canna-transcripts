[00:00.830 --> 00:08.590]  I believe we are live. Welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us for the morning
[00:08.590 --> 00:15.670]  garden tour evening edition. We're broadcasting at you from the West Coast.
[00:15.670 --> 00:22.390]  I'm in LA. Chad is up in Washington State.
[00:22.390 --> 00:24.390]  Yes sir.
[00:24.390 --> 00:29.390]  Are you a little intimidated after this morning's garden tour?
[00:29.390 --> 00:38.230]  Holy cow. To be completely honest, that's probably the most efficient, well-run setup
[00:38.230 --> 00:46.150]  I have seen in a commercial scale. It was pretty inspirational. I would love to work
[00:46.150 --> 00:50.150]  there if they were up in my area.
[00:50.150 --> 00:53.150]  Charles said, it's that guy, Chad Westport.
[00:53.910 --> 00:58.910]  Hey. Give you the shooter McGavin. What's up?
[01:00.910 --> 01:08.910]  Yeah, it was pretty cool. Definitely a tough act to follow. But it's kind of perfect because
[01:08.910 --> 01:17.490]  it shows you the exact opposite. The wide range of grows that you can have and how people
[01:17.490 --> 01:22.250]  are doing it. So yeah, tough act to follow. That was fun to watch.
[01:22.250 --> 01:31.250]  Yeah, it was impressive. For anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about, it was FLIR
[01:31.250 --> 01:35.250]  Las Vegas or FLIR Nevada, right?
[01:35.250 --> 01:37.250]  Yeah.
[01:37.250 --> 01:43.250]  I see some familiar faces in the chat.
[01:43.250 --> 01:46.250]  Yo, right on. Holy cow.
[01:47.010 --> 01:54.010]  Coming in from Hawaii. Obviously, we have some Australians in the house.
[01:54.010 --> 01:56.010]  Yeah, Australia.
[01:56.010 --> 01:58.010]  Starting their day.
[02:00.010 --> 02:04.010]  Awesome, guys. Thanks for hopping in and popping in. It's great to see all you guys.
[02:04.010 --> 02:10.010]  So just to give people some context, I think one of the things you and I talked about was
[02:10.770 --> 02:18.770]  kind of focusing on home growers and shooting the shit with home growers, home grow tutorials,
[02:18.770 --> 02:25.770]  which I've always been psyched to do and wanting to get started. So I guess we're going to get started.
[02:25.770 --> 02:27.770]  Yeah.
[02:27.770 --> 02:30.770]  On a semi-regular recurring basis.
[02:30.770 --> 02:32.770]  That's...
[02:33.530 --> 02:39.530]  Why don't you talk about kind of your home...
[02:39.530 --> 02:44.530]  So you've... Because you moved how many years ago to where you are now?
[02:44.530 --> 02:51.530]  Three years. Three years ago, I moved out here and I'm just... I've had a few different configurations
[02:51.530 --> 02:56.530]  trying to, you know, you go from one space to the next and try to make it work.
[02:56.530 --> 02:59.530]  Always want to expand, but you have a limit.
[03:00.290 --> 03:04.290]  Are you in a house or are you in an apartment or what are you in?
[03:04.290 --> 03:06.290]  Yeah, I'm in a house.
[03:06.290 --> 03:12.290]  My old house was a little bit better because I just used the garage, which was great.
[03:12.290 --> 03:18.290]  I had a nice, beautiful looking fake wall there and all the room that I needed.
[03:18.290 --> 03:23.290]  But the garage here has turned into a bedroom. So what's a guy to do?
[03:24.050 --> 03:32.050]  Yeah, I know. I was going to ask, like when you were looking at houses, was growing weed kind of one of the considerations of like,
[03:32.050 --> 03:35.050]  where am I going to be growing in this house?
[03:37.050 --> 03:42.050]  Yeah, usually. My first thing has always been, where's the half pipe going to go?
[03:42.050 --> 03:45.050]  And that's usually been the garage. Now it's out back.
[03:45.050 --> 03:49.050]  But yeah, number two comes in, where's I'm going to put my things?
[03:49.810 --> 03:55.810]  More importantly, actually, tomorrow we are going to go look at some property in Oregon.
[03:57.810 --> 04:02.810]  It's zoned perfectly for farming and greenhouse and agriculture.
[04:02.810 --> 04:07.810]  So I'm going to go take a look at some bare land tomorrow and hopefully get things rolling.
[04:07.810 --> 04:10.810]  That would be where I could do it properly.
[04:11.810 --> 04:14.810]  And how far from where you are right now is that?
[04:15.810 --> 04:17.810]  About an hour and a half.
[04:18.570 --> 04:19.570]  So not far at all.
[04:20.570 --> 04:22.570]  No, no, no. It's a nice day drive.
[04:23.570 --> 04:24.570]  Awesome.
[04:25.570 --> 04:28.570]  So, and how long have you been growing for?
[04:29.570 --> 04:31.570]  About 10 years. Well, a little bit over 10 years.
[04:33.570 --> 04:41.570]  Yeah, Washington has had a medical system for a while. 2010, it really kind of opened as far as who gets to write the prescriptions.
[04:41.570 --> 04:45.570]  And that opened the doors and access to a lot of people.
[04:46.330 --> 04:49.330]  So I went and got my license and I've been doing it ever since.
[04:50.330 --> 04:51.330]  Got it.
[04:52.330 --> 04:55.330]  And you have a musical background, right?
[04:56.330 --> 05:01.330]  I do. I do. I come from the DJ world, which is a little slice of the pie.
[05:02.330 --> 05:06.330]  And if you want to divide that even further, I would say it's the drum and the bass.
[05:08.330 --> 05:10.330]  I remember the drum and the bass.
[05:11.090 --> 05:18.090]  I was in New York in the mid to late 90s and drum and bass was strong there back in the day.
[05:19.090 --> 05:26.090]  I actually went to some raves because I had a, when I got out of college, I started a software company.
[05:27.090 --> 05:32.090]  And I was dealing with like Microsoft and some other companies.
[05:33.090 --> 05:37.090]  And I'd fly up to Washington.
[05:37.850 --> 05:42.850]  And I remember this guy, Ken, took me to a couple raves every time I went.
[05:43.850 --> 05:48.850]  That was my intro to like the Seattle up into like Vancouver rave scene.
[05:49.850 --> 05:54.850]  Yeah. Well, shoot, that time frame we might have been, we might have bumped elbows.
[05:55.850 --> 05:56.850]  That's funny.
[05:57.850 --> 06:04.850]  So what, do you want to give us a little tour of the setup?
[06:05.610 --> 06:07.610]  Yeah. Yeah. I'll take you in there.
[06:08.610 --> 06:11.610]  Again, just kind of preface it for those people who watched it earlier.
[06:12.610 --> 06:15.610]  This is the everyman version.
[06:16.610 --> 06:25.610]  Yeah. Yeah. You know, I like back in the medical days when it got started, I wanted to kind of help seniors.
[06:26.610 --> 06:33.610]  It was basically a market that I felt could benefit the most from cannabis, the potential of cannabis.
[06:34.370 --> 06:37.370]  They're also the most indoctrinated with reefer madness.
[06:38.370 --> 06:43.370]  And so, yeah, I went in and kind of helped set up and worked with a lot of those people.
[06:44.370 --> 06:47.370]  And another thing that you got to consider there is they're working on a budget too.
[06:48.370 --> 06:52.370]  So it's good to know how to do everything with all kinds of budgets and all kinds of spaces.
[06:53.370 --> 06:55.370]  And let's go take a look here.
[06:56.370 --> 06:58.370]  I'm going to flip my camera around real quick.
[06:59.370 --> 07:01.370]  Let's see here.
[07:02.130 --> 07:10.540]  All right. Let's go in here.
[07:12.540 --> 07:14.540]  So let it adjust.
[07:15.540 --> 07:16.540]  We got, let's see here.
[07:17.540 --> 07:18.540]  Let me go back here.
[07:19.540 --> 07:27.540]  And just quickly to give people some background, the reason we're going at 10 at night is because your lights go on at 9 at night, right?
[07:28.540 --> 07:30.540]  Yeah. Yeah. They come on at 9.
[07:31.300 --> 07:32.300]  So, OK.
[07:33.300 --> 07:36.300]  It's kind of hard to see with this little screen.
[07:37.300 --> 07:39.300]  So I guess we'll just, we'll start at the bottom here.
[07:40.300 --> 07:41.300]  I've got kind of a little.
[07:42.300 --> 07:43.300]  There we go. Thank you.
[07:44.300 --> 07:46.300]  Got a little clone section down here.
[07:47.300 --> 07:48.300]  Right now I'm taking a few.
[07:49.300 --> 07:51.300]  You kind of see these over here.
[07:52.300 --> 07:53.300]  A little bit off color.
[07:54.300 --> 07:56.300]  Don't worry. Give it four days and they'll be fine.
[07:57.300 --> 07:58.300]  Just put them in there.
[07:59.060 --> 08:00.060]  Kind of coming over here.
[08:01.060 --> 08:02.060]  These, by the way, let's see.
[08:03.060 --> 08:08.060]  They're both Temple Runts, which is from Ethos Genetics.
[08:09.060 --> 08:11.060]  It's kind of a one pheno and a two pheno.
[08:12.060 --> 08:16.060]  I'll show you the difference in a second.
[08:17.060 --> 08:19.060]  Varieties. Let's see.
[08:20.060 --> 08:21.060]  So we have a couple of Temple Runts there.
[08:21.820 --> 08:23.820]  The dorm edition. Let's see.
[08:24.820 --> 08:27.340]  What do we got?
[08:28.340 --> 08:29.340]  We got anything coming up?
[08:30.340 --> 08:35.340]  And I like the funky colors of the.
[08:36.340 --> 08:37.340]  But right.
[08:38.340 --> 08:39.340]  Colors.
[08:41.340 --> 08:42.340]  Can you hear me?
[08:43.340 --> 08:44.340]  Yeah.
[08:45.340 --> 08:46.340]  Can you hear me?
[08:47.340 --> 08:51.150]  Yeah.
[08:52.150 --> 08:53.150]  I can hear you.
[08:53.910 --> 08:54.910]  Can you hear me?
[08:55.910 --> 08:56.910]  Yeah.
[09:00.080 --> 09:01.080]  Yeah, there's a little delay.
[09:02.080 --> 09:03.080]  Okay, so I'm still talking.
[09:07.890 --> 09:08.890]  Yeah. Okay.
[09:09.890 --> 09:10.890]  So you guys are getting a lag.
[09:11.890 --> 09:12.890]  Farther from.
[09:16.480 --> 09:20.480]  Is the door open going out to where the Wi-Fi is?
[09:21.480 --> 09:22.480]  Let's see here.
[09:23.240 --> 09:26.240]  Yeah, doors open here.
[09:27.240 --> 09:28.240]  Let me.
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.240]  Let me try to open another door here real quick.
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.240]  Set you down looking up here.
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.240]  Sorry, guys.
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.370]  That's a trippy view.
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.370]  Corner of the house.
[09:48.370 --> 09:49.370]  Yeah, you probably stare straight up at my light.
[09:50.370 --> 09:51.370]  Sorry.
[09:51.370 --> 09:52.370]  Okay, it's.
[09:53.370 --> 09:54.370]  Can you hear me now?
[09:55.130 --> 09:56.130]  Is it a little bit better?
[09:57.130 --> 09:58.130]  Yeah.
[09:59.130 --> 10:00.130]  Okay, perfect.
[10:01.130 --> 10:04.130]  So right now this is what we're rocking and veg.
[10:07.130 --> 10:08.130]  Awesome, Patrick.
[10:09.130 --> 10:15.130]  Okay, so gosh, it's like I need one of those pointers so I can get it in shot.
[10:16.130 --> 10:17.130]  Yeah.
[10:18.130 --> 10:20.130]  Just go to right now.
[10:20.890 --> 10:26.890]  I was in the process of transplanting into the three gallons, but I went and took my.
[10:27.890 --> 10:32.890]  Soil out of the car, put my hand in it and realized exactly how cold it was.
[10:33.890 --> 10:35.890]  And you don't want to do that.
[10:36.890 --> 10:40.890]  You had your soil sitting out in cold weather for a while.
[10:40.890 --> 10:42.890]  You're just going to shock the crap out of your roots.
[10:43.890 --> 10:45.890]  So I decided not to do that.
[10:46.890 --> 10:48.890]  So I still got them in there.
[10:49.650 --> 10:53.650]  It's warming up to room temperature, so that'll get transplanted later.
[10:54.650 --> 10:58.650]  Okay, so right now we've got kind of a Dutch treat.
[10:59.650 --> 11:00.650]  Dutch treat.
[11:01.650 --> 11:02.650]  These are this is a clone.
[11:03.650 --> 11:04.650]  This thing stretches like a beast.
[11:05.650 --> 11:06.650]  Tons of internal space on it.
[11:08.650 --> 11:10.650]  It just tastes so damn good.
[11:11.650 --> 11:15.650]  I don't necessarily like growing it, but every now and then I got to do it.
[11:16.410 --> 11:17.410]  Let's see.
[11:17.410 --> 11:19.410]  I mentioned the two Temple Runts phenos earlier.
[11:20.410 --> 11:23.410]  So this is the first one.
[11:24.410 --> 11:26.410]  Let's see if this works better.
[11:28.410 --> 11:29.410]  That does work a little bit better.
[11:30.410 --> 11:31.410]  Or is that annoying for our sensitive crowd?
[11:32.410 --> 11:33.410]  I'm sure they'll let us know.
[11:34.410 --> 11:38.410]  I like it more TV style when it takes up the whole screen.
[11:40.410 --> 11:41.410]  Me too.
[11:42.410 --> 11:43.410]  I was just trying to fit it all in.
[11:44.170 --> 11:47.170]  So if you look, let's see if we can get in on this one.
[11:48.170 --> 11:49.170]  This is Temple Runts number one.
[11:50.170 --> 11:53.170]  It's got really tight nodal spacing on it.
[11:54.170 --> 11:59.170]  You know, a lot better than the one that's sitting right behind it.
[12:02.170 --> 12:03.170]  This is Temple Runts as well.
[12:04.170 --> 12:06.170]  And that just has.
[12:08.170 --> 12:09.170]  Oh boy.
[12:10.170 --> 12:11.170]  Let's see here.
[12:11.930 --> 12:18.210]  Are you still with me, Peter?
[12:19.210 --> 12:20.210]  Yeah.
[12:23.210 --> 12:25.210]  Fat fingers on the phone.
[12:30.530 --> 12:31.530]  Yeah, chat.
[12:33.530 --> 12:34.530]  There's no mercy.
[12:37.530 --> 12:47.530]  Yeah, I actually have fallen asleep a couple of times tonight waiting for my two year old to decide that she's maybe ready to entertain the idea of.
[12:48.290 --> 12:49.290]  Going to bed.
[12:50.290 --> 12:51.290]  Yeah, he'll be back.
[12:52.290 --> 12:53.290]  In the meantime, it's just me.
[12:59.670 --> 13:02.670]  And three, two, one.
[13:03.670 --> 13:04.670]  There he is.
[13:05.670 --> 13:06.670]  He's back.
[13:07.670 --> 13:08.670]  OK, I'm sorry about that.
[13:09.670 --> 13:10.670]  I won't go so deep in there.
[13:11.670 --> 13:12.670]  Let's see.
[13:13.670 --> 13:17.670]  So I had the shorter one with the kind of the tighter nodal spacing here like that one.
[13:18.670 --> 13:19.670]  That one's coming in good.
[13:20.430 --> 13:23.430]  But then if you look at the one in the back, that's also the same Temple Runts.
[13:24.430 --> 13:25.430]  Definitely a lot taller.
[13:26.430 --> 13:30.430]  Typically, when I see something like that, my first intuition is that's going to turn out to be a male.
[13:31.430 --> 13:36.430]  Doesn't always come true, but sometimes when they do that on you, that's the case.
[13:37.430 --> 13:40.430]  And I had to just kind of top that one.
[13:41.430 --> 13:42.430]  I can't reach in there.
[13:42.430 --> 13:43.430]  It'll cut out.
[13:43.430 --> 13:45.430]  But these two up here, I'm basically I'm going to tie those down.
[13:46.430 --> 13:47.430]  I just got it into the third.
[13:48.190 --> 13:51.190]  And then the other two that are right here, I'll bend those down.
[13:52.190 --> 13:56.190]  So that's going to kind of keep it a little bit more level with the other canopy.
[13:57.190 --> 13:58.190]  So that's important.
[13:59.190 --> 14:01.190]  First run on.
[14:02.190 --> 14:03.190]  Let's see.
[14:05.190 --> 14:12.190]  Those in the back, it's got a big bud that's just basically going straight up with no side branching.
[14:13.190 --> 14:16.190]  And then a Chem OG, kind of the same deal.
[14:16.950 --> 14:25.950]  I just topped the Chem OG and it's nice because I noticed today that it's starting to pre flower and I noticed pistils on it.
[14:25.950 --> 14:26.950]  So that was a regular seed.
[14:26.950 --> 14:28.950]  That's going to turn out to be a female.
[14:28.950 --> 14:29.950]  I'm happy about that.
[14:30.950 --> 14:32.950]  You kind of got the short male that I'm working with there.
[14:33.950 --> 14:36.950]  That's an Afghani number one male that needs to get up potted.
[14:37.950 --> 14:42.950]  And the one hiding in the corner there, as well as this one, is skunk number one.
[14:43.710 --> 14:45.710]  From Scentsy Seeds.
[14:46.710 --> 14:48.710]  I have it in flower now.
[14:49.710 --> 14:52.710]  I don't smell skunk, so it is what it is.
[14:53.710 --> 15:05.710]  But mentioned earlier, I was watering and you can kind of see how the leaves right now are not as awesome as this one.
[15:05.710 --> 15:07.710]  This one, I didn't get watered, so it's up.
[15:07.710 --> 15:08.710]  It's praying.
[15:08.710 --> 15:09.710]  It's not laying down.
[15:10.710 --> 15:12.710]  This has a little bit too much water.
[15:13.470 --> 15:15.470]  So right after you water it, you'll see this in the plants a lot.
[15:16.470 --> 15:23.470]  And for new growers, it's important to kind of know that over watering, under watering kind of looks like the same thing.
[15:24.470 --> 15:27.470]  But you'll also have people like, oh, when you over water it claws.
[15:28.470 --> 15:34.470]  And, you know, if you have too much nitrogen in there, it will actually like bend down and like claw on the ends of the tips.
[15:35.470 --> 15:39.470]  And that's like more of like a feed type issue.
[15:40.230 --> 15:44.230]  But when you have that just like gentle sloping down, it's just got a little water.
[15:45.230 --> 15:46.230]  So that'll come about.
[15:47.230 --> 15:49.230]  And then for like watering.
[15:49.230 --> 15:51.230]  Sorry for the shakiness, guys.
[15:52.230 --> 15:56.230]  I just went to Home Depot and you can get the cool shelving.
[15:57.230 --> 16:00.230]  You put that on there and then it also helps.
[16:01.230 --> 16:03.230]  Oh, there's so many things I could say right now.
[16:04.230 --> 16:07.230]  But basically regulate like temperature, helps with the airflow, air pruning.
[16:07.990 --> 16:08.990]  It's not sitting in a saucer.
[16:09.990 --> 16:10.990]  There's a lot of advantages to doing like that.
[16:11.990 --> 16:12.990]  Plus, it makes getting rid of your runoff easy.
[16:13.990 --> 16:16.990]  You just pull your tray out and dump it out.
[16:17.990 --> 16:18.990]  You're good to go.
[16:19.990 --> 16:20.990]  So that's kind of that.
[16:21.990 --> 16:24.990]  That's just roughly the veg I do have.
[16:27.990 --> 16:29.990]  AC Infinity fan back there is coming up.
[16:30.990 --> 16:34.990]  Don't forget to keep your power strips out of the way of the water and off the ground.
[16:35.750 --> 16:38.750]  Got my fan moving some air over there.
[16:39.750 --> 16:44.750]  Got a light with a carbon filter up there as well.
[16:45.750 --> 16:48.750]  And then I kind of just measure out to the distance from the light.
[16:49.750 --> 16:50.750]  Kind of helps me.
[16:51.750 --> 16:54.750]  But I also know that when it hits to this point, I need to put it into flowering.
[16:55.750 --> 16:56.750]  Otherwise, I'm going to be hosed.
[16:57.750 --> 16:59.750]  And you'll see what that looks like here in a sec.
[17:00.750 --> 17:01.750]  We'll go over to the flowering.
[17:02.750 --> 17:03.750]  Just kind of show you some of the things.
[17:04.510 --> 17:05.510]  You got your little reed out there.
[17:06.510 --> 17:08.510]  It's a little cold because I have the door open.
[17:09.510 --> 17:10.510]  I'm keeping the door open right now.
[17:11.510 --> 17:12.510]  Got my watering cans.
[17:13.510 --> 17:14.510]  Got all my newts and stuff in there.
[17:17.510 --> 17:18.510]  Oh, grow hack right here.
[17:19.510 --> 17:20.510]  These little binder clip things.
[17:21.510 --> 17:25.510]  If you ever need to do some like tie downs on a plant,
[17:26.510 --> 17:29.510]  they fit perfectly onto the edge of these.
[17:30.510 --> 17:32.510]  So if you need to, you know, if you wanted to bend something down
[17:33.270 --> 17:34.270]  or you're trying to train something,
[17:35.270 --> 17:36.270]  these little binder clips right there.
[17:37.270 --> 17:38.270]  Frickin money.
[17:39.270 --> 17:40.270]  So that's awesome.
[17:41.270 --> 17:43.270]  Yes, you do see Doug from NorCal.
[17:44.270 --> 17:45.270]  What's up?
[17:46.270 --> 17:47.270]  Another little thing.
[17:48.270 --> 17:51.270]  These, I guarantee the facility that you looked at earlier
[17:52.270 --> 17:54.270]  probably does not have one of these bad boys.
[17:55.270 --> 17:59.270]  If you do use drip pans, you definitely don't want your.
[18:00.270 --> 18:02.270]  Yeah, you don't want to use drip pans.
[18:03.270 --> 18:04.270]  You don't want your stuff sitting in there.
[18:05.270 --> 18:06.270]  You don't want your roots sitting in the water.
[18:07.270 --> 18:09.270]  So yeah, you got your turkey baster, you pull it out.
[18:10.270 --> 18:11.270]  Let's see.
[18:12.270 --> 18:13.270]  You kind of got some lovely basics.
[18:14.270 --> 18:17.270]  If you guys ever need to like hide a light leak or anything like that,
[18:18.270 --> 18:19.270]  seal your corners.
[18:20.270 --> 18:23.270]  This silver, this metal tape that you get at the hardware store is money.
[18:24.270 --> 18:25.270]  No light is coming through that.
[18:26.270 --> 18:28.270]  That's another kind of awesome thing there.
[18:30.270 --> 18:31.270]  Let's see here.
[18:32.030 --> 18:33.030]  Let's open this up.
[18:34.030 --> 18:35.030]  We got some flour over here.
[18:37.030 --> 18:38.030]  Welcome to the jungle.
[18:39.030 --> 18:42.030]  It's kind of an appropriate way to put it.
[18:44.030 --> 18:45.030]  Let's see here.
[18:46.030 --> 18:47.030]  Let's get that out of the way.
[18:48.030 --> 18:49.030]  So we'll start here.
[18:50.030 --> 18:51.030]  Kind of the same.
[18:52.030 --> 18:54.030]  I have it elevated so I can run, get run on.
[18:58.460 --> 18:59.460]  Ah, shit.
[19:00.460 --> 19:01.460]  Oh, okay.
[19:01.460 --> 19:02.460]  Wait, no, we're good.
[19:03.220 --> 19:04.220]  Sorry, guys.
[19:07.220 --> 19:08.220]  Okay.
[19:09.220 --> 19:12.220]  So under here, I've pretty much stripped and everything.
[19:13.220 --> 19:18.220]  Got it cleaned up to my Scrognett, which is actually a wire mesh.
[19:19.220 --> 19:24.220]  So it's pretty solid, which I like because sometimes you have runaway plants
[19:25.220 --> 19:30.220]  and you're able to run things laterally a lot easier when you have a stiffer
[19:30.980 --> 19:31.980]  material.
[19:32.980 --> 19:36.980]  Sometimes that Scrognett, it just, you can push it all over the place.
[19:37.980 --> 19:41.980]  So this also has smaller holes than the traditional kind of Scrognett,
[19:42.980 --> 19:45.980]  which I like because, you know, again, when you're trying to maximize your
[19:46.980 --> 19:50.980]  space, you want to spread it out as much as possible.
[19:51.980 --> 19:53.980]  See if I can get some sort of lens.
[19:54.980 --> 19:55.980]  Let's see here.
[19:56.740 --> 19:57.740]  Oh, sorry, guys.
[20:01.220 --> 20:03.220]  Figuring it out here as I go.
[20:04.220 --> 20:05.220]  So let's see.
[20:06.220 --> 20:08.220]  No, that's not going to do it.
[20:11.200 --> 20:12.200]  Okay.
[20:12.200 --> 20:13.200]  Technical difficulty.
[20:14.200 --> 20:17.200]  So as we come in, like the first, first strain you got, this is,
[20:18.200 --> 20:23.200]  this is the Wounded Warrior right here, which, oh, let's see.
[20:24.200 --> 20:25.200]  Can I focus?
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.200]  Can I bring this in here?
[20:28.200 --> 20:29.200]  Focus, focus, focus.
[20:29.960 --> 20:30.960]  No, no focusing.
[20:31.960 --> 20:32.960]  Okay.
[20:33.960 --> 20:34.960]  No.
[20:35.960 --> 20:36.960]  Oh, man.
[20:37.960 --> 20:38.960]  So.
[20:39.960 --> 20:40.960]  God dang.
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.960]  Let's see.
[20:41.960 --> 20:42.960]  Can we get in here without blinding people?
[20:43.960 --> 20:44.960]  Let's see.
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.960]  In the very back here, we've got some Dutch Treat going in the back there.
[20:50.960 --> 20:56.960]  Again, that, it's got a wicked stretch on it, so don't always grow it,
[20:57.960 --> 20:58.960]  but I've got that.
[20:59.960 --> 21:01.960]  Different varieties that are in veg, James.
[21:02.960 --> 21:03.960]  I do have the Dutch Treat in here.
[21:04.960 --> 21:07.960]  A couple of things that aren't in veg right now that I took out.
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.960]  One is this Lemon Sunrise from Iry Genetics.
[21:15.960 --> 21:21.960]  Man, that thing grows tall and stretches, and it's got super long branches on it
[21:22.960 --> 21:26.960]  that for an indoor space like mine, just not the best plant to grow.
[21:27.720 --> 21:30.720]  If I was growing outdoors, I would absolutely love to run this.
[21:31.720 --> 21:32.720]  So let's see.
[21:33.720 --> 21:34.720]  Let's see where we're at up there.
[21:35.720 --> 21:37.720]  That's the top of it.
[21:38.720 --> 21:39.720]  The cola is up there.
[21:40.720 --> 21:43.720]  It's coming in with a good lemon smell right now.
[21:44.720 --> 21:47.720]  Crystals are starting to form on it, so that's always nice.
[21:48.720 --> 21:51.720]  But again, just not going to keep that around growing too tall.
[21:52.480 --> 21:57.480]  The one, another one that I'm not, that's not in veg right now is in the back here.
[21:58.480 --> 22:01.480]  These, this is Afghani No. 1.
[22:02.480 --> 22:04.480]  Got that all in the back there.
[22:05.480 --> 22:07.480]  Just didn't hit, didn't hit the spot for me.
[22:08.480 --> 22:11.480]  It was a fun plant to do, but it's not the keeper.
[22:12.480 --> 22:15.480]  And I'm trying to go through more and more things these days
[22:16.480 --> 22:19.480]  instead of just running the same plant.
[22:20.240 --> 22:22.240]  Just running the same things that I like,
[22:23.240 --> 22:24.240]  because I'm trying to find some good things to work with.
[22:25.240 --> 22:28.240]  So you got to rotate things out, especially when you got a spot this small.
[22:29.240 --> 22:33.240]  You know, I still think that you can do a pheno hunt.
[22:34.240 --> 22:36.240]  I'm not going to say a good pheno hunt,
[22:37.240 --> 22:39.240]  because a good pheno hunt is going to be a whole bunch of plants.
[22:40.240 --> 22:42.240]  And it takes many years on this side doing it this way.
[22:43.240 --> 22:46.240]  But man, if you've been smoking weed for like 20 years and you've been around,
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  you kind of know which ones are the winners.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  So it's just kind of a race through seeds right now,
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  trying to find some fun things, some good things to work with.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  We got another Dutch treat here in the corner that was in a 2-gallon pot,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  which was an experiment versus the 3.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  I definitely like the 3-gallon.
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  I mean, we've got, again, we've got the Dutch treat here in the back.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Let's see, that was in the 3-gallon.
[23:14.760 --> 23:21.760]  And that's putting off, I mean, that's all the buds in the back over there
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.760]  versus something much smaller.
[23:27.760 --> 23:32.760]  So root mass, root size, bigger the root, the bigger the fruit, right?
[23:35.760 --> 23:39.760]  That is kind of the tour.
[23:40.760 --> 23:41.760]  So, OK, here's a good example.
[23:42.520 --> 23:45.520]  So my room right now is kind of a great example of a lot of things
[23:46.520 --> 23:50.520]  of what necessarily not to do or things that you run into.
[23:51.520 --> 23:53.520]  Everything is way too close to the light.
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.520]  OK, a couple of things I could have done is, you know, I could have,
[23:59.520 --> 24:01.520]  if I had less plants in here, I kind of stretch things out,
[24:02.520 --> 24:03.520]  kind of pull things out.
[24:04.520 --> 24:06.520]  I could have added another layer of Scrognett.
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.520]  That would have been nice.
[24:09.280 --> 24:12.280]  But since it is where it is and these are new LED lights,
[24:13.280 --> 24:14.280]  I've been running HPS forever.
[24:15.280 --> 24:17.280]  So this is the second run with the LEDs.
[24:19.280 --> 24:22.280]  So what the fuck happens if it is four inches off the light?
[24:23.280 --> 24:24.280]  I'm finding out right now.
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.280]  So we'll see.
[24:27.280 --> 24:29.280]  There's a lot of things that can be corrected.
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.280]  But then a lot of times you're just like, well, you know what?
[24:33.280 --> 24:35.280]  So what does happen? I'll find out for once.
[24:36.280 --> 24:37.280]  The really tall ones in the back,
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.040]  I haven't run that before.
[24:40.040 --> 24:42.040]  So that's a skunk number one.
[24:43.040 --> 24:45.040]  That pretty much had like a three time stretch on it.
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.040]  It's actually above the lights, which I've never had happen before.
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.040]  Yeah, I was going to say that thing shot up.
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.040]  Yeah.
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.040]  And it's totally, it's interesting to me because, OK, you're like,
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.040]  well, you know, light drives the growth.
[25:00.040 --> 25:02.040]  But really photosynthesis is driving it.
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.040]  So all of these leaves that are still down here are getting food.
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.040]  Up to that upper bud.
[25:10.040 --> 25:14.040]  Is that upper bud going to be as big as the ones down here at the end that are in the light?
[25:15.040 --> 25:18.040]  Because it has apical dominance, so it should be getting all the food,
[25:19.040 --> 25:21.040]  but it's not in a good spot to earn priority.
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.040]  So I don't know.
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.040]  Those are just little things that I'm answering myself since this is the way it is.
[25:28.040 --> 25:30.040]  Again, this this kind of has the new floor.
[25:31.040 --> 25:32.040]  So I lost some height there.
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.040]  These took, they took about three extra weeks in veg.
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.800]  Just because I was waiting for a male to drop pollen.
[25:41.800 --> 25:48.800]  And I don't like starting my flowering until the male is done dropping pollen in a different tent.
[25:49.800 --> 25:51.800]  So that's kind of that.
[25:52.800 --> 25:53.800]  I hope this doesn't cut out here.
[25:54.800 --> 26:00.800]  I want to try to go in here and show you what I did as far as just like managing like the Dutch tree and the stretch on that.
[26:01.800 --> 26:03.800]  If it does, I'll be right back.
[26:04.560 --> 26:09.560]  But I just want to kind of show you the under canopy again and just like exactly what you can do.
[26:10.560 --> 26:12.560]  You can kind of see them like right there.
[26:13.560 --> 26:19.560]  Another one right here, right there, over here.
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.560]  Basically what I did is I just bent these freaking things straight over.
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.560]  So instead of keep growing up, they got in here, bent them over, just kind of let them lay there.
[26:32.320 --> 26:35.320]  And some of the side growth caught up to it.
[26:36.320 --> 26:37.320]  I trimmed that off.
[26:38.320 --> 26:41.320]  But again, that saved me probably at least.
[26:42.320 --> 26:45.320]  They would have been in the lights if I didn't do that.
[26:46.320 --> 26:48.320]  So they are where they are right now.
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.320]  But that's kind of what I'm running in the flower.
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.320]  Some people can defoliate a little bit more.
[26:57.320 --> 26:59.320]  It's all playing with it.
[27:00.080 --> 27:01.080]  But I don't know.
[27:02.080 --> 27:04.080]  I haven't had my eye on chat lately.
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.080]  I don't know.
[27:05.080 --> 27:06.080]  Does anybody have any questions?
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.080]  Yeah, there are questions about how frequently you water.
[27:12.080 --> 27:14.080]  I thought I just saw that one.
[27:15.080 --> 27:18.080]  And then what your grow media is.
[27:19.080 --> 27:20.080]  Yeah, right.
[27:22.670 --> 27:23.670]  Okay.
[27:24.670 --> 27:30.670]  Right now, these are getting watered between every two to three days.
[27:31.430 --> 27:34.430]  They're at four weeks right now, so they're starting to drink a little bit more.
[27:35.430 --> 27:38.430]  At the same time, you give it a little bit of drought stress.
[27:39.430 --> 27:44.430]  You can increase the secondary metabolites, mainly THC and resin production.
[27:45.430 --> 27:51.430]  So I'm trying to keep them kind of on the edge of being thirsty, but not too thirsty.
[27:52.430 --> 27:56.430]  If the soil gets too dry, I am using in this run, I'm using salts.
[27:57.190 --> 28:02.190]  So if the soil is going to get a little bit too dry, the EC gets a little bit higher.
[28:03.190 --> 28:05.190]  The salts mineralize kind of.
[28:06.190 --> 28:10.190]  And then the next time you go in and water, it all dissolves and that can cause issues.
[28:11.190 --> 28:14.190]  So watering about every two to three days here.
[28:15.190 --> 28:21.190]  Over here, these guys are just finally starting to get on a regular routine.
[28:22.190 --> 28:25.190]  Of about every two to three days as well.
[28:25.950 --> 28:26.950]  But I just up-potted them.
[28:27.950 --> 28:29.950]  So I'm guessing that's going to be about three, four days now.
[28:30.950 --> 28:33.950]  Just while they're filling out the new soil mass.
[28:34.950 --> 28:37.950]  Oh, I should probably plug my clones back in, right?
[28:38.950 --> 28:43.950]  God, when I worked at a commercial facility, obviously you're taking clones all the time.
[28:44.950 --> 28:48.950]  But dude forgot to plug... He took a thousand clones and forgot to plug the machine in.
[28:49.950 --> 28:50.950]  Whoops.
[28:51.710 --> 28:58.710]  Yeah, and just quickly, so you have an Aeroponics, is that like a Turbo Cloner or what is it?
[28:59.710 --> 29:01.710]  Yeah, it's like a Turbo Cloner.
[29:02.710 --> 29:05.710]  It's not any particular named model.
[29:06.710 --> 29:11.710]  One thing I like too about having it in the little McDonald's tray.
[29:12.710 --> 29:15.710]  So if any water comes down this, it just sits in the tray.
[29:16.710 --> 29:17.710]  So take it off here.
[29:18.710 --> 29:19.710]  Lift it up.
[29:20.470 --> 29:23.470]  Yeah, just little 360 misters.
[29:24.470 --> 29:25.470]  Thing works like a charm.
[29:26.470 --> 29:30.470]  Honestly, I've probably had this over a year now.
[29:31.470 --> 29:34.470]  I have not had one fail to root, which is nice.
[29:35.470 --> 29:36.470]  Yeah, I love mine.
[29:39.470 --> 29:42.470]  Do you just have straight water in there or do you add it?
[29:43.230 --> 29:51.760]  I do some water in there and I add a little bit of Clonex.
[29:52.760 --> 29:54.760]  Let's see. Let's take a peek in here.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.760]  I do a little bit of this in there with it.
[29:58.760 --> 30:00.760]  It's a little bit of the Clonex solution.
[30:01.760 --> 30:03.760]  It's supposed to give it a little bit of food.
[30:04.760 --> 30:10.760]  But I mean, as you can see, they do get pretty malnutritioned while they're sitting in here.
[30:11.520 --> 30:16.520]  Those are about eight days old from when I took them.
[30:17.520 --> 30:22.520]  So, you know, I guess really the two in the back pretty much within 10 days, they're ready to go.
[30:23.520 --> 30:27.520]  So I don't sweat the color or the look of the nutrients too much.
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.520]  Because again, I know once I put them into the soil and you had a medium.
[30:35.520 --> 30:36.520]  I use.
[30:37.520 --> 30:38.520]  Oh, let's see here.
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.280]  Okay.
[30:41.280 --> 30:44.280]  Royal Gold Kings Mix.
[30:45.280 --> 30:47.280]  So it's a soil blend.
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.280]  It has a little bit of Bicco in there.
[30:50.280 --> 30:52.280]  It's a peat product, aged forest stuff.
[30:53.280 --> 30:55.280]  A little bit of a natural amendments in there.
[30:56.280 --> 31:01.280]  So again, that gives me the food to not have to worry about that color.
[31:03.280 --> 31:04.280]  But in here I've got.
[31:05.280 --> 31:07.280]  So the kind of the lines that I keep.
[31:08.040 --> 31:09.040]  Messing with.
[31:12.040 --> 31:14.040]  Yeah, clone gel.
[31:15.040 --> 31:16.040]  I've got my.
[31:17.040 --> 31:19.040]  I've got my clone X that I put into another jar.
[31:20.040 --> 31:21.040]  I always use it.
[31:22.040 --> 31:26.040]  One kind of, you know, despite the look of the things pro level tip here is when you have your colon X.
[31:27.040 --> 31:31.040]  After you take your clones, put a little bit of this into a cap or something else.
[31:32.040 --> 31:36.040]  Because if you're dipping directly into your clone X or whatever you're using.
[31:36.800 --> 31:38.800]  And your plant has some sort of pathogen.
[31:39.800 --> 31:42.800]  And you keep dipping everything else into the same bottle and the same bottle.
[31:43.800 --> 31:44.800]  You might infect everything.
[31:45.800 --> 31:46.800]  So be careful with that one.
[31:48.800 --> 31:50.800]  So, yeah, I just kind of pour it into other stuff.
[31:51.800 --> 31:52.800]  A little bit of the mammoth pee.
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.800]  They're all free stuff and never use it.
[31:56.800 --> 31:59.800]  So probably the most common line that people are going to try.
[32:00.800 --> 32:01.800]  They're going to try this.
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.800]  I need to be familiar with it.
[32:04.560 --> 32:06.560]  I was using this line in cocoa.
[32:07.560 --> 32:08.560]  Works great.
[32:09.560 --> 32:10.560]  I'm trying it in the flour this time.
[32:11.560 --> 32:12.560]  Just to see if it translates.
[32:14.560 --> 32:15.560]  We'll see.
[32:16.560 --> 32:17.560]  Jury's still out.
[32:18.560 --> 32:19.560]  But I also have, let's see.
[32:20.560 --> 32:21.560]  Down here.
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.560]  Roots Organics.
[32:24.560 --> 32:25.560]  They call it the master pack.
[32:26.560 --> 32:28.560]  It's like fucking 10 bottles of stuff.
[32:29.560 --> 32:32.560]  But I'm going to do that with the ones in veg.
[32:33.320 --> 32:35.320]  I want to try an organic bottled solution.
[32:36.320 --> 32:39.320]  Just to see what sort of results I have compared to salts.
[32:41.320 --> 32:42.320]  Also playing with up potting.
[32:43.320 --> 32:44.320]  Building more root mass.
[32:45.320 --> 32:47.320]  But as I mentioned with the clones.
[32:49.320 --> 32:51.320]  The soil is amended slightly.
[32:52.320 --> 32:54.320]  So I get it to a new stage.
[32:55.320 --> 32:56.320]  Basically when you're about to need to feed it again.
[32:57.320 --> 32:58.320]  And then I up pot it.
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.320]  So all the soil in that up pot has.
[33:02.080 --> 33:04.080]  It's going to eat off of that for a week or two.
[33:05.080 --> 33:06.080]  And then right about when you would need to add food again.
[33:07.080 --> 33:08.080]  I up pot it again.
[33:09.080 --> 33:13.080]  So that's kind of a way to minimize the amount of inputs.
[33:15.080 --> 33:18.080]  And that is something that totally relates to home growing.
[33:19.080 --> 33:20.080]  And not necessarily to commercial.
[33:21.080 --> 33:23.080]  I don't have to hit a quota.
[33:24.080 --> 33:25.080]  I don't have to hit an output.
[33:26.080 --> 33:27.080]  If I get one ounce per plant.
[33:28.080 --> 33:30.080]  That will take care of me and my wife.
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.840]  I got six plants.
[33:32.840 --> 33:33.840]  Six ounces.
[33:34.840 --> 33:35.840]  Takes us two months.
[33:36.840 --> 33:37.840]  As you can see I have perpetual going.
[33:38.840 --> 33:39.840]  That's going to switch.
[33:40.840 --> 33:41.840]  This is actually.
[33:42.840 --> 33:43.840]  I'm going to turn this into another flower chamber.
[33:44.840 --> 33:45.840]  Because I want to have.
[33:46.840 --> 33:47.840]  I want to thin this out.
[33:48.840 --> 33:49.840]  I have six in here right now.
[33:50.840 --> 33:51.840]  And I've gone with four in there before.
[33:52.840 --> 33:55.840]  And I was able to get the same sort of output from it.
[33:56.840 --> 33:58.840]  There's this real thing called shade response.
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.600]  Plants want to start growing up when they feel shade from another plant.
[34:03.600 --> 34:04.600]  Instead of focusing on buds.
[34:05.600 --> 34:06.600]  So by packing things in.
[34:07.600 --> 34:09.600]  You can kind of kick yourself in the.
[34:10.600 --> 34:12.600]  Or shoot yourself in the foot by doing that.
[34:13.600 --> 34:14.600]  But again at the same time.
[34:15.600 --> 34:16.600]  I like variety.
[34:17.600 --> 34:19.600]  So I don't ever really monocrop.
[34:20.600 --> 34:21.600]  I want to have.
[34:22.600 --> 34:23.600]  I want to have some options.
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.600]  To things to smoke.
[34:26.600 --> 34:27.600]  And running through things here again.
[34:28.360 --> 34:29.360]  I'm just stuffing stuff in.
[34:30.360 --> 34:31.360]  Going through it real quick.
[34:32.360 --> 34:33.360]  So this is going to thin out.
[34:34.360 --> 34:35.360]  That's going to be a little bit more under control.
[34:36.360 --> 34:37.360]  This is going to be.
[34:38.360 --> 34:39.360]  Take the other part of the flowering away.
[34:40.360 --> 34:41.360]  Or be part of the other flowering.
[34:42.360 --> 34:44.360]  And then I'll just do the simple vegging.
[34:45.360 --> 34:46.360]  So I'm not going to get them too tall.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.360]  You know again right now.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.360]  24 inches maybe.
[34:52.360 --> 34:53.360]  That's all I need.
[34:54.360 --> 34:55.360]  And then they'll flower.
[34:56.360 --> 34:57.360]  So those are just going to go into tents.
[34:58.360 --> 34:59.360]  Two of the two by two tents.
[35:00.360 --> 35:01.360]  And I'll actually just.
[35:02.360 --> 35:03.360]  I just set one up today.
[35:04.360 --> 35:05.360]  I could show you that.
[35:06.360 --> 35:07.360]  Nothing in it yet.
[35:08.360 --> 35:09.360]  But that is going to help solve that problem too.
[35:10.360 --> 35:11.360]  And then with this room.
[35:12.360 --> 35:13.360]  I can just kind of seal it off.
[35:14.360 --> 35:15.360]  Instead of right now.
[35:16.360 --> 35:17.360]  You know I've got my door.
[35:19.360 --> 35:20.360]  Which you can't see through it.
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.360]  You've got.
[35:23.360 --> 35:24.360]  You got to do enough layers.
[35:25.360 --> 35:26.360]  But it basically it just.
[35:27.120 --> 35:28.120]  Flashes on here.
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.120]  Little wing nut.
[35:31.120 --> 35:32.120]  Gets it tight.
[35:33.120 --> 35:34.120]  But I have weather guard.
[35:35.120 --> 35:36.120]  So it actually seats.
[35:37.120 --> 35:38.120]  Against it.
[35:39.120 --> 35:40.120]  When it when it sits in there.
[35:41.120 --> 35:42.120]  Which is nice because again there's no no light leak.
[35:43.120 --> 35:44.120]  But I'm just.
[35:45.120 --> 35:46.120]  Since I'm going to do them both.
[35:47.120 --> 35:48.120]  Flower in here.
[35:49.120 --> 35:50.120]  I'm just going to take that off.
[35:51.120 --> 35:52.120]  And then do a professional zippered door.
[35:53.120 --> 35:54.120]  Over the main door to this little room.
[35:55.120 --> 35:56.120]  And then that way I don't have to worry about.
[35:57.120 --> 35:58.120]  The doors because both chambers will be on the same light cycle.
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.120]  Whereas they're different now.
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.120]  So that's kind of why I got to have them a little bit differently.
[36:08.390 --> 36:11.390]  What what was the male that you collected pollen from.
[36:13.390 --> 36:16.390]  It is an Afghani number one male.
[36:17.390 --> 36:20.390]  And it grew definitely different than.
[36:21.390 --> 36:23.390]  Males that I pop from the bunch.
[36:24.390 --> 36:25.390]  The females were kind of spread out.
[36:26.150 --> 36:27.150]  I didn't really like that.
[36:28.150 --> 36:30.150]  I wanted something that's going to have a tighter nodal spacing.
[36:31.150 --> 36:32.150]  And this male just.
[36:33.150 --> 36:34.150]  I liked the way that it grew.
[36:35.150 --> 36:37.150]  Everything grew kind of nice and tight on it.
[36:38.150 --> 36:40.150]  It doesn't actually stretch a whole bunch.
[36:41.150 --> 36:42.150]  Which is kind of cool too.
[36:43.150 --> 36:45.150]  But I just I just like the way that it grew.
[36:46.150 --> 36:47.150]  What I wanted to do with this.
[36:48.150 --> 36:50.150]  Is kind of introduce stability for one.
[36:51.150 --> 36:52.150]  It's a pretty damn stable.
[36:53.150 --> 36:54.150]  But I wanted to make it kind of.
[36:54.910 --> 36:55.910]  It's a pretty damn stable line.
[36:56.910 --> 36:57.910]  But I also wanted to get.
[36:59.910 --> 37:00.910]  Better structure.
[37:01.910 --> 37:02.910]  I kind of find like.
[37:03.910 --> 37:05.910]  A lot of the hot strains today are growing like this.
[37:06.910 --> 37:07.910]  The temple runs here in the back.
[37:08.910 --> 37:09.910]  There's a lot of.
[37:10.910 --> 37:11.910]  At least the ones I see a lot of internal space.
[37:12.910 --> 37:13.910]  You know they're not huge buds anymore.
[37:14.910 --> 37:17.910]  Just a lot of stretch with little golf balls on them.
[37:18.910 --> 37:19.910]  And that's cool.
[37:20.910 --> 37:22.910]  They're they're super crystally super flavory and they're really good.
[37:23.670 --> 37:25.670]  But I'm a little bit older.
[37:28.670 --> 37:29.670]  I like you know.
[37:30.670 --> 37:33.670]  I like big fat nugs and some different taste.
[37:34.670 --> 37:36.670]  So that's that's something solid.
[37:37.670 --> 37:40.670]  Like if I if I get something that I like from either of these runs.
[37:41.670 --> 37:42.670]  And I still have more to go through.
[37:43.670 --> 37:44.670]  I'm looking for some that's completely fruity.
[37:45.670 --> 37:47.670]  Some that's going to smack you in your face.
[37:48.670 --> 37:49.670]  If I find that.
[37:50.670 --> 37:52.670]  Then I would be able to cross it to the male here.
[37:53.670 --> 37:54.670]  And then when I go through that progeny.
[37:55.670 --> 37:59.670]  Since this since the Afghani male is so just like consistent.
[38:00.670 --> 38:03.670]  And almost in my opinion some of the flower might be a little bit bland.
[38:04.670 --> 38:05.670]  Compared to today.
[38:06.670 --> 38:08.670]  But I'm going to know which plant is given what.
[38:09.670 --> 38:12.670]  And I'm also going to be able to tell what expression.
[38:13.670 --> 38:15.670]  Or where the expression from the lineage is coming.
[38:16.670 --> 38:19.670]  So that's kind of one of the ideas there.
[38:20.430 --> 38:21.430]  But I do.
[38:22.430 --> 38:25.430]  You know and especially for the freaking forum that I'm on right now.
[38:26.430 --> 38:28.430]  I always like to say that I make seeds.
[38:29.430 --> 38:30.430]  I'm not I'm not going to say that I'm a breeder.
[38:31.430 --> 38:33.430]  I think a lot of people would probably agree with me on that one.
[38:34.430 --> 38:36.430]  But I do have purpose.
[38:37.430 --> 38:38.430]  I do have direction.
[38:39.430 --> 38:44.430]  I have a plethora of smoking experience and cannabis knowledge.
[38:45.430 --> 38:48.430]  So you know it can all lead somewhere one day.
[38:49.190 --> 38:50.190]  Hopefully I go look at this property tomorrow.
[38:51.190 --> 38:52.190]  And that just kicks everything off.
[38:53.190 --> 38:54.190]  So who knows.
[38:55.190 --> 38:56.190]  Who knows.
[39:02.680 --> 39:04.680]  What else or anything else in the chat for me.
[39:08.680 --> 39:09.680]  I really wish I could.
[39:10.680 --> 39:11.680]  Someone asked if you top.
[39:14.680 --> 39:15.680]  Or was that one.
[39:16.440 --> 39:27.820]  I do like to sometimes depending on the plant.
[39:28.820 --> 39:29.820]  I'll top.
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.820]  But I usually go for like a little bit of femming.
[39:32.820 --> 39:33.820]  Like this over here.
[39:34.820 --> 39:35.820]  OK.
[39:36.820 --> 39:37.820]  Try not to make it cut out.
[39:38.820 --> 39:39.820]  Yeah.
[39:39.820 --> 39:40.820]  So that's that's kind of what I did here.
[39:42.820 --> 39:43.820]  Is I just spend it here.
[39:44.820 --> 39:45.820]  I got my little my little top growth.
[39:46.820 --> 39:50.820]  But again these I'll just be able to lay down while that continues up northward.
[39:51.820 --> 39:52.820]  And then I'll just lay it down.
[39:53.580 --> 39:56.580]  And then I'll lay these two on the sides down as well.
[39:59.580 --> 40:03.580]  I had to finally top the chemo G because this one was just growing north.
[40:04.580 --> 40:06.580]  And again that's why you kind of see the funky.
[40:07.580 --> 40:08.580]  Funky little leaves here.
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.580]  That's where I cut it.
[40:11.580 --> 40:12.580]  And it grew out.
[40:13.580 --> 40:15.580]  But again I always find that like if you do a top or a fem.
[40:16.580 --> 40:19.580]  Once you get to about the seventh or eighth node you'll start to see pre flowers.
[40:20.340 --> 40:23.340]  Like that little bit of stress will help make the plant just express itself.
[40:24.340 --> 40:28.340]  And again today I noticed for the first time that thing is female.
[40:29.340 --> 40:32.340]  So that's a that's one good sign about it.
[40:33.340 --> 40:34.340]  We'll find out what the final smoke is like.
[40:35.340 --> 40:36.340]  But it's a female.
[40:37.340 --> 40:38.340]  So that's a good step in the right direction there.
[40:40.340 --> 40:41.340]  And again yeah.
[40:42.340 --> 40:43.340]  It's like the royal gold stuff I'm using.
[40:44.340 --> 40:45.340]  Shout out to the men of dope.
[40:46.340 --> 40:47.340]  I like stickers if you can't tell.
[40:48.100 --> 40:51.100]  I'm still that kid that puts everything like on the side of the shelf.
[40:55.100 --> 40:56.100]  Oh boy.
[40:57.100 --> 40:58.100]  Yeah.
[40:58.100 --> 40:59.100]  I got.
[40:59.100 --> 41:00.100]  Let's see.
[41:01.100 --> 41:02.100]  Oh I got to show this because.
[41:03.100 --> 41:04.100]  So that's my med paper right there.
[41:05.100 --> 41:06.100]  You always got to have that by your grill.
[41:07.100 --> 41:09.100]  But I told Danny Danko I hang his shit right above my stuff.
[41:10.100 --> 41:11.100]  And he probably doesn't believe me.
[41:12.100 --> 41:13.100]  But Danny Danko there's your shit right above my stuff.
[41:14.100 --> 41:15.100]  So thank you very much.
[41:15.860 --> 41:16.860]  Danny if you're watching.
[41:17.860 --> 41:18.860]  Yeah I know right.
[41:19.860 --> 41:20.860]  I'm not sure he's got this DVR.
[41:25.860 --> 41:26.860]  Someone asked when you switched.
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.860]  Yeah here we go.
[41:30.860 --> 41:31.860]  I switched to flower.
[41:32.860 --> 41:33.860]  Yeah.
[41:37.660 --> 41:38.660]  It would be nice if I switched to flower.
[41:39.660 --> 41:44.660]  And actually I will be able to do this now that I have the other tent set up to veg in.
[41:45.420 --> 41:48.420]  But previously I have to wait until these are done.
[41:49.420 --> 41:54.420]  Like if I have I try to run a short strains you know 60 days nine weeks.
[41:56.420 --> 41:58.420]  If I get a strain that goes longer than that.
[41:59.420 --> 42:02.420]  These things got to wait in the other room.
[42:03.420 --> 42:07.420]  So I'm kind of solving my own problem there by vegging differently.
[42:09.420 --> 42:10.420]  Do you ever do that?
[42:11.420 --> 42:12.420]  Yeah.
[42:13.180 --> 42:18.180]  Do you reduce the light or something to slow them down if there's like a backlog?
[42:19.180 --> 42:20.180]  Yes.
[42:20.180 --> 42:22.180]  Yeah you absolutely absolutely can.
[42:23.180 --> 42:26.180]  All my lights are and then veg it is probably a little bit underpowered.
[42:27.180 --> 42:30.180]  Well it's underpowered for what you could do.
[42:31.180 --> 42:32.180]  But yeah you're absolutely right.
[42:33.180 --> 42:38.180]  That's really kind of been an effort just to keep growth at a decent pace but not explosive.
[42:38.940 --> 42:47.940]  And that's really kind of another benefit of going off of the amendments in the soil versus going hard on the feed and veg.
[42:48.940 --> 42:53.940]  You obviously you know you want to keep the color you want to keep them healthy you want to keep them happy.
[42:54.940 --> 42:56.940]  But you don't necessarily need to turbo charge them.
[42:57.940 --> 42:59.940]  So yeah that's lighting is one thing that I will do.
[43:00.940 --> 43:03.940]  Also the pot size pot size makes a big difference.
[43:04.700 --> 43:14.700]  If I had these plants and five or seven gallons this room dude if you think it's out of control right now it would just be off the hook.
[43:15.700 --> 43:23.700]  Because these are three gallons and then I've got a two gallon down there just to A and B the difference with the same strain you know.
[43:24.460 --> 43:30.460]  And speaking of lights someone Charles asked what what lights are you using.
[43:31.460 --> 43:33.460]  We got a what soil are you using.
[43:34.460 --> 43:35.460]  OK.
[43:36.460 --> 43:38.460]  Lights I've got a couple of Charles.
[43:39.460 --> 43:40.460]  Hey Charles.
[43:41.460 --> 43:42.460]  Very curious.
[43:43.460 --> 43:44.460]  Yes.
[43:45.460 --> 43:47.460]  Soil is Royal Gold Kings mix.
[43:48.460 --> 43:52.460]  It's mainly forest products and peat but it has a little bit of a different color.
[43:53.220 --> 43:55.220]  It's mainly forest products and peat but it has a little bit of cocoa in it as well.
[43:56.220 --> 44:00.220]  That actually compared to other brands it seems a little bit lighter.
[44:01.220 --> 44:04.220]  I can get more water in and out of it without it staying soaked.
[44:05.220 --> 44:06.220]  So that's always nice.
[44:07.220 --> 44:11.220]  That was the soil question.
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.220]  And then the lights.
[44:14.220 --> 44:15.220]  Lights.
[44:15.220 --> 44:16.220]  Oh yes.
[44:16.220 --> 44:17.220]  That's where I was going.
[44:17.220 --> 44:18.220]  Let's see if I can not blind you guys.
[44:19.220 --> 44:22.220]  I have two spider farmer 1000s in here.
[44:23.220 --> 44:29.220]  It's a total of 200 watts for a space that's three by three.
[44:30.220 --> 44:33.220]  So a bit under powered than it could be.
[44:34.220 --> 44:41.220]  But again it works perfect for my space and it gives me the yields that I really need.
[44:42.220 --> 44:49.220]  Quite honest if I was pulling massive yields in here I wouldn't be able to do anything with it.
[44:49.980 --> 44:54.980]  Me and my wife we can smoke it and if I do have extras I do give it away to some people that I know.
[44:55.980 --> 44:56.980]  Washington is awesome.
[44:57.980 --> 45:02.980]  You can gift up to an ounce to a person and I prefer to do it that way.
[45:03.980 --> 45:04.980]  That keeps everything simple.
[45:05.980 --> 45:06.980]  I still have all the smoke that I need.
[45:07.980 --> 45:08.980]  We're all good.
[45:08.980 --> 45:09.980]  I like to help people.
[45:10.980 --> 45:11.980]  So that's that.
[45:12.980 --> 45:14.980]  Have you ever played with a tupper?
[45:15.980 --> 45:16.980]  I haven't.
[45:17.980 --> 45:18.980]  That's their straight cocoa right?
[45:19.980 --> 45:25.980]  It's definitely their lightest mix.
[45:26.980 --> 45:29.980]  That's what I used and then I just kind of added my own stuff.
[45:32.980 --> 45:39.320]  Oh yeah someone just mentioned tupper.
[45:42.320 --> 45:45.320]  Oh Sir Dirty you just broke my heart.
[45:46.320 --> 45:48.320]  I just tried to do.
[45:49.080 --> 45:50.080]  I didn't know that.
[45:51.080 --> 45:59.080]  I actually want to check in with Michael from Royal Gold to see if that sad news is actually true.
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.080]  Yeah that would be kind of a bummer.
[46:05.080 --> 46:11.080]  I am leaning more and more towards building my own soil.
[46:12.080 --> 46:15.080]  Just kind of trying to amend it myself.
[46:15.840 --> 46:16.840]  That's one of the hard things.
[46:17.840 --> 46:19.840]  I love listening to a lot of the soil science things.
[46:20.840 --> 46:22.840]  And you know I mentioned we were talking earlier.
[46:23.840 --> 46:27.840]  I do have commercial experience growing cannabis.
[46:28.840 --> 46:29.840]  So guys don't judge me.
[46:30.840 --> 46:35.840]  In a commercial environment I would grow one plant in here and still bitch about not having enough room.
[46:36.840 --> 46:38.840]  So I've grown in that environment.
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.840]  I've also done the sustainable agriculture program up here with WSU.
[46:45.840 --> 46:46.840]  And Scadid Valley.
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.840]  My point being is something.
[46:52.840 --> 46:54.840]  And it will come back to me very shortly.
[46:59.840 --> 47:02.840]  Yeah building kind of is building my own soil.
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.840]  Again like guys I'm in a three gallon bucket for maybe three months.
[47:10.840 --> 47:13.840]  You know really two months because I'm just up potting.
[47:14.600 --> 47:16.600]  And so I use the soil.
[47:17.600 --> 47:23.600]  I guess it would be easier to kind of keep maybe like a fixed bed or something in here.
[47:24.600 --> 47:26.600]  Or larger pots in here when I do go to flowering them both.
[47:27.600 --> 47:30.600]  Because I won't have to need to move them from one to the other.
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.600]  My big thing with like the living soil the organic soils.
[47:38.600 --> 47:41.600]  Outside in beds bigger spaces.
[47:42.360 --> 47:47.360]  I would do it all day but it's hard to convince me to try to do that stuff for three months in a three gallon pot.
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.360]  Like just give me a bag and call it good.
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.360]  So flame on folks.
[47:58.360 --> 47:59.360]  All right.
[48:01.360 --> 48:02.360]  And any other questions about here.
[48:03.360 --> 48:06.360]  I'm going to go back and sit down and show you my beautiful face.
[48:07.360 --> 48:08.360]  My arms are getting tired.
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.360]  Yeah.
[48:11.120 --> 48:12.120]  Okay.
[48:13.120 --> 48:14.120]  Let's see here I'm just going to flip myself back.
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.120]  Oh let's see here.
[48:18.120 --> 48:20.120]  That's one more thing little design.
[48:21.120 --> 48:23.120]  I've got my passive intake down here.
[48:24.120 --> 48:26.120]  Which is always good to have right now.
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.120]  That's kind of a way that I heat it during lights off.
[48:32.120 --> 48:33.120]  So I just got a little heater.
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.120]  That's been in there.
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.120]  And that doesn't go just empty out right in here.
[48:39.880 --> 48:40.880]  It's actually it goes down.
[48:41.880 --> 48:42.880]  It goes along.
[48:43.880 --> 48:46.880]  It comes around and then it pops up right there.
[48:47.880 --> 48:48.880]  Where's my finger.
[48:49.880 --> 48:50.880]  Right there.
[48:51.880 --> 48:54.880]  So no light is coming in to ruin my growth.
[48:55.880 --> 48:58.880]  So passive intake gets extra air when the door is closed.
[48:59.880 --> 49:03.880]  And it's also an option for heating right now because it's cold.
[49:04.880 --> 49:06.880]  That's one thing about switching from the HPS.
[49:07.640 --> 49:09.640]  If I had my HPS in here I wouldn't need to heat anything.
[49:10.640 --> 49:12.640]  But since I'm running the LEDs and it's the winter.
[49:13.640 --> 49:15.640]  It's a little bit colder.
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.640]  But that yeah that's just kind of little little details.
[49:21.640 --> 49:22.640]  Little details.
[49:23.640 --> 49:25.640]  Little things you can do and play with.
[49:26.640 --> 49:27.640]  Let's see here.
[49:34.180 --> 49:35.180]  Oh that's right.
[49:36.180 --> 49:37.180]  Studio mode.
[49:38.180 --> 49:39.180]  Look at that.
[49:39.940 --> 49:40.940]  Hey like an ace.
[49:41.940 --> 49:42.940]  All right.
[49:42.940 --> 49:43.940]  Sorry guys.
[49:44.940 --> 49:45.940]  It does get hot in there though.
[49:46.940 --> 49:47.940]  It's like a little sauna in that closet.
[49:48.940 --> 49:50.940]  But that's my happy space.
[49:51.940 --> 49:52.940]  That's where I spend a bunch of time.
[49:54.940 --> 49:56.940]  Are you guys allowed to grow outside?
[50:00.340 --> 50:02.340]  It can't be in plain view.
[50:03.340 --> 50:05.340]  So I would say no.
[50:06.340 --> 50:10.340]  And any of the commercial facilities that are growing outside.
[50:11.340 --> 50:14.340]  It's so funny because you would never notice that they were there.
[50:15.340 --> 50:18.340]  Except for the 10 foot gate that surrounds all of them.
[50:19.340 --> 50:23.340]  Like the security that they have to have gives away exactly what they do.
[50:24.340 --> 50:26.340]  Sorry he's in Washington state.
[50:29.340 --> 50:31.340]  Yeah let me try to open up that.
[50:32.340 --> 50:34.340]  So Eastern Washington the weather is better.
[50:35.340 --> 50:38.340]  You do get a lot more outdoor grows there.
[50:39.100 --> 50:40.100]  I'm on the west side of the mountains.
[50:41.100 --> 50:42.100]  The west side is the rainy side.
[50:43.100 --> 50:44.100]  There are some outdoors.
[50:45.100 --> 50:46.100]  But no I've never been able to do it.
[50:47.100 --> 50:48.100]  I'd like to grow outdoors one day.
[50:49.100 --> 50:51.100]  Again I'd throw that lemon sunrise outdoors.
[50:52.100 --> 50:53.100]  That would be a great one.
[50:54.100 --> 50:55.100]  But here not going to happen.
[50:56.100 --> 50:58.100]  Not going to happen well at least.
[50:59.100 --> 51:00.100]  I wouldn't put my bank on it.
[51:01.100 --> 51:03.620]  Yeah I'm looking in the.
[51:05.620 --> 51:06.620]  What.
[51:07.380 --> 51:09.380]  You know since we're focused on home grows.
[51:10.380 --> 51:13.380]  What are kind of some common mistakes you see people make.
[51:15.380 --> 51:17.380]  The common mistakes like.
[51:18.380 --> 51:21.380]  I'd love to you know just start at the beginning and break it down.
[51:22.380 --> 51:26.380]  One of the common mistakes that people will do is they'll sprout a seed.
[51:27.380 --> 51:31.380]  And then they'll put it right into the three gallon or a five gallon or a bigger bucket.
[51:32.380 --> 51:34.380]  And that is hard to water accurately.
[51:35.140 --> 51:36.140]  It's.
[51:37.140 --> 51:38.140]  So that's that's their first mistake.
[51:39.140 --> 51:42.140]  They'll go in and put it in something too big and they're kind of doomed that way.
[51:43.140 --> 51:44.140]  I like the little four inch by four inch.
[51:45.140 --> 51:46.140]  Containers.
[51:47.140 --> 51:51.140]  Easier to keep the right amount of water and oxygen in the root zone for a baby root zone.
[51:52.140 --> 52:01.140]  And it's not sitting in soaked water as long either because that water can kind of fluctuate in and out with pH and temperatures.
[52:01.900 --> 52:03.900]  So yeah I always say start small.
[52:04.900 --> 52:08.900]  Watering and feeding is also probably the other most common thing.
[52:09.900 --> 52:10.900]  Over watering under watering.
[52:11.900 --> 52:12.900]  They look similar which is crazy.
[52:13.900 --> 52:21.900]  And I showed you a little bit earlier about how the leaves you know when they're over watered they're not clawed like this.
[52:22.900 --> 52:25.900]  They're just more of a gentle like droopy a little bit.
[52:26.900 --> 52:28.900]  But they'll they'll they'll come back out and then stand up.
[52:29.660 --> 52:31.660]  You know the praying position you would say.
[52:32.660 --> 52:34.660]  So those those are things to look for.
[52:35.660 --> 52:39.660]  Again if you have the right size pot it's a lot easier to lift it.
[52:40.660 --> 52:45.660]  That's kind of one of the best generic techniques is water your pot.
[52:46.660 --> 52:47.660]  Get a little bit of runoff on it.
[52:48.660 --> 52:52.660]  Don't get a whole bunch because sometimes some nutrients are more mobile in the soil than others.
[52:53.660 --> 52:57.660]  So if you're just dumping water through and you're getting a ton of runoff saying like oh it's watered.
[52:58.420 --> 53:04.420]  You're washing out some nutrients and you're changing the ratios in the soil and that can lead to issues.
[53:05.420 --> 53:07.420]  So you just water out you get a little bit of runoff.
[53:08.420 --> 53:09.420]  You pick up your pot.
[53:10.420 --> 53:11.420]  OK feels good.
[53:12.420 --> 53:13.420]  That's what it's like.
[53:14.420 --> 53:15.420]  And then you wait.
[53:16.420 --> 53:17.420]  You wait until it's about half of that way.
[53:18.420 --> 53:20.420]  You can kind of stick your finger in the soil do the knuckle test.
[53:21.420 --> 53:24.420]  But really it's a weight and a feeling thing.
[53:25.420 --> 53:27.420]  That's going to be the best way for new growth.
[53:28.420 --> 53:30.420]  For new growers to figure out when it's time to water.
[53:31.420 --> 53:35.420]  Because patience is a key so vital to growing this plant.
[53:36.420 --> 53:40.420]  And when you are new to it and you're excited you just want it to hurry up.
[53:41.420 --> 53:47.700]  And we have a Hawaiian trying to join us right now.
[53:48.700 --> 53:50.700]  But his device is not connected yet.
[53:51.700 --> 53:52.700]  So we'll wait.
[53:53.700 --> 53:57.700]  But actually a while ago someone asked about your IPM strategy.
[53:58.460 --> 54:08.460]  And I guess that gets for me that gets to the starting point of what kind of pests are you seeing in an indoor grow in Washington state.
[54:09.460 --> 54:11.460]  Indoor grow.
[54:12.460 --> 54:14.460]  So first of all IPM for me.
[54:15.460 --> 54:18.460]  My IPM management is just basically cultural.
[54:19.460 --> 54:25.460]  There's a lot of there's five or six different levels of IPM management that you can go into.
[54:26.460 --> 54:27.460]  And they're all important.
[54:28.460 --> 54:29.460]  Especially when you have big crops.
[54:30.460 --> 54:32.460]  One I don't take in any clones.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.460]  So I don't bring anything in.
[54:35.460 --> 54:38.460]  I have different shoes that I wear in here.
[54:39.460 --> 54:41.460]  I don't prevent I don't do anything preventative.
[54:42.460 --> 54:46.460]  I don't spray I don't release predator insects.
[54:47.460 --> 54:51.460]  I just try to keep healthy plants and a sterile environment.
[54:52.460 --> 54:54.460]  And kind of through those cultural controls.
[54:55.220 --> 54:57.220]  I've been able to you know knock on wood.
[54:58.220 --> 55:01.220]  Avoid everything except for maybe five or six fungus gnats.
[55:03.220 --> 55:08.220]  Previously I took in some thrips on a clone.
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.220]  And this was back in the medical days.
[55:11.220 --> 55:18.220]  I learned quickly how things how most bugs start is from getting clones from people.
[55:19.220 --> 55:21.220]  The thrips they didn't really damage my plant.
[55:21.980 --> 55:22.980]  They weren't all over.
[55:23.980 --> 55:25.980]  So I didn't really worry about them.
[55:26.980 --> 55:27.980]  That was a mistake.
[55:28.980 --> 55:31.980]  Because they are great at vectoring disease and pathogens.
[55:32.980 --> 55:38.980]  And I honestly think that something along the line I don't know what virus it was.
[55:39.980 --> 55:43.980]  But running the same plants over a course of years.
[55:44.980 --> 55:47.980]  Two years kind of after I got the last batch of clones that were a little runty.
[55:48.740 --> 55:52.740]  My yields just kept going down slowly.
[55:53.740 --> 55:54.740]  But it was everything was the same.
[55:55.740 --> 55:59.740]  And so yeah I think those thrips I wasn't worried because they weren't damaging the plant really.
[56:00.740 --> 56:02.740]  But ultimately they were a threat.
[56:03.740 --> 56:06.740]  Because I think they gave me a pathogen that just stunted everything I had.
[56:07.740 --> 56:10.740]  And I haven't worked with any of that material for years now.
[56:11.740 --> 56:12.740]  So yeah no clones for me.
[56:13.740 --> 56:15.740]  Drybacks I see Worthy Buzz here.
[56:16.500 --> 56:17.500]  Drybacks for the IPM.
[56:18.500 --> 56:24.500]  If I have a little bit of fungus gnats I probably would.
[56:25.500 --> 56:27.500]  It hasn't really been an issue for me.
[56:28.500 --> 56:31.500]  Again that's kind of going to using the right container size.
[56:32.500 --> 56:36.500]  If I have a little plant in that three gallon that surface is going to stay wet for a long time.
[56:37.500 --> 56:39.500]  But if I have it in that little four inch by four inch container.
[56:40.500 --> 56:44.500]  I'm able to get wet dry wet dry with the right container.
[56:45.260 --> 56:47.260]  Without it staying very wet.
[56:48.260 --> 56:52.260]  So for IPM I haven't really done the dryback again.
[56:53.260 --> 57:01.260]  Because just using the salts I'm concerned about the EC levels in my soil spiking and changing the pH.
[57:03.260 --> 57:06.260]  But yeah my pleasure man.
[57:07.260 --> 57:12.260]  And can you hear us in Hawaii?
[57:13.260 --> 57:14.260]  Yeah I can hear.
[57:15.260 --> 57:16.260]  How do I flip the camera on this?
[57:17.260 --> 57:19.260]  Uhhhh.
[57:20.260 --> 57:24.260]  So you see the thing that looks like a sprocket?
[57:25.260 --> 57:26.260]  That says cam mic.
[57:27.260 --> 57:28.260]  So if you tap that.
[57:29.260 --> 57:31.260]  And then on the camera if you.
[57:32.260 --> 57:33.260]  Yeah look at that.
[57:34.260 --> 57:35.260]  Heyo.
[57:36.260 --> 57:39.260]  And then turn your camera 90 degrees so it's like a TV.
[57:40.260 --> 57:43.260]  Dickey pads for fungus gnats.
[57:44.020 --> 57:45.020]  I don't.
[57:46.020 --> 57:47.020]  Lucky Mike.
[57:48.020 --> 57:49.020]  What's up by the way buddy?
[57:50.020 --> 57:51.020]  Good to see you in here.
[57:52.020 --> 57:53.020]  Thank you for coming over.
[57:54.020 --> 57:57.020]  I haven't used the sticky pads.
[57:58.020 --> 58:03.020]  I haven't really seen a bunch of the fungus gnats in here.
[58:04.020 --> 58:07.020]  So again if you notice in there I have the white floors.
[58:08.020 --> 58:10.020]  And I also have white on all of the surfaces.
[58:10.780 --> 58:13.780]  That really helps me again with the cultural controls.
[58:14.780 --> 58:17.780]  I know if my arm hair is sitting on there which is kind of disgusting.
[58:18.780 --> 58:19.780]  Because that's the thing I see most on the floor.
[58:20.780 --> 58:22.780]  But I know if there's dirt on the floor.
[58:23.780 --> 58:24.780]  I know if there's water on there.
[58:25.780 --> 58:26.780]  I know if there's little bugs crawling across it.
[58:27.780 --> 58:29.780]  So that's kind of another thing that I'm doing.
[58:30.780 --> 58:33.780]  Just to help with my IPM there.
[58:34.780 --> 58:37.500]  So I saw that.
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.500]  Let's see here.
[58:40.260 --> 58:42.260]  I'm going to stroke the beard for one of those comments there.
[58:43.260 --> 58:44.260]  Yes, yes, yes.
[58:45.260 --> 58:46.260]  Let's see.
[58:47.260 --> 58:48.260]  Can I scroll up and down on these things?
[58:49.260 --> 58:50.260]  Oh I can.
[58:51.260 --> 58:52.260]  I'm new to this system.
[58:53.260 --> 58:54.260]  I'm a zoom, zoom, zoom kind of guy.
[58:55.260 --> 58:56.260]  But hey that's all good.
[58:57.260 --> 58:58.260]  Thanks James.
[58:59.260 --> 59:00.260]  I appreciate that.
[59:01.260 --> 59:04.260]  Wetus207, Modern Genetics, Lucky Mike, iMedic31, George Gabriel.
[59:05.260 --> 59:06.260]  All these names I recognize.
[59:07.260 --> 59:08.260]  That's so freaking awesome guys.
[59:09.020 --> 59:11.020]  It's one thing to come onto this channel.
[59:12.020 --> 59:15.020]  It's another thing to come onto this channel after the show they had today.
[59:16.020 --> 59:19.020]  But I'm just going to be real here.
[59:20.020 --> 59:25.020]  And I think there's a lot of other people out there that are just going to be real too.
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.020]  I like to work with home growers.
[59:28.020 --> 59:29.020]  I like to work with people in tents.
[59:30.020 --> 59:31.020]  I like to work with people that have a budget.
[59:32.020 --> 59:33.020]  I like to work with people that have constraints.
[59:34.020 --> 59:37.020]  That is reality for a lot of people.
[59:37.780 --> 59:38.780]  Unlimited space, unlimited budgets.
[59:39.780 --> 59:41.780]  I'm sure we could all do fabulous things.
[59:42.780 --> 59:44.780]  It does take a lot of the same knowledge.
[59:45.780 --> 59:47.780]  You don't necessarily have to get that deep.
[59:48.780 --> 59:51.780]  There's levels to everything in life.
[59:52.780 --> 59:53.780]  Growing cannabis is no different.
[59:54.780 --> 59:55.780]  You can treat it rather basically.
[59:56.780 --> 59:58.780]  You can get into it super in depth.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.780]  That's something that I love.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.780]  And my background, we talked a little bit of audio earlier.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.540]  I have the audio engineering degree.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:14.540]  And one of the things, best thing that I learned from my instructor and my teacher there.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.540]  Was you have to learn the rules before you can break the rules.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.540]  And pretty much what that meant is I had been making music beforehand.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.540]  And I know when I go and turn that reverb, it's going to give me that kind of echoey sound that I want.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.540]  It's going to sound good.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.300]  But why did it sound good?
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:43.300]  Now I know that the difference between delay and chorus and reverb is just basically the amount of milliseconds between the echoes.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.300]  So I know what it's actually doing.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.300]  I know the rule now.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.300]  I know the rule of those different things.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.300]  If I wanted to do something different, I can manipulate it now that I understand it.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.300]  So growing on the big level, and that was another thing that was kind of inspirational about this morning.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:09.060]  Scaling things from a home grow to a commercial aspect 99% of the time don't work.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]  I mean, dude, go for real.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:18.060]  Have you ever been into a commercial facility that has clippy fans on every wall?
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.060]  No, because it just doesn't scale.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:29.060]  But what they were doing was developed on a smaller scale and then brought up.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.820]  And it was done through organics and possibly that's just the inputs that they were using.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.820]  But that's something that I'm always looking for.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:45.820]  Because again, I will be doing at some point, I will be doing vertically integrated craft cannabis.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.820]  That's what I would like to do.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820]  I squirreled that.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820]  I was looking at chat.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.580]  I get passionate about it, man.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.580]  I like helping the home growers because that's who I am.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:07.580]  And again, a lot of people, if they're just trying to make some medicine for themselves,
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.580]  they don't need to pull three pounds of light.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:17.580]  They're happy if they got three ounces of some killer quality smoke that they know has no pesticides.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.580]  That they know the inputs of it.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580]  And they can trim it however they want.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.340]  So we have a Maui or no, what island are you on?
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340]  Kauai.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.340]  So we have our Hawaiian cameo.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340]  Hey, aloha brother.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340]  Yeah, there we go.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.340]  So what are you growing?
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100]  Snake oil.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.100]  Some cookie crunch.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.100]  Pebbles.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.100]  Ash musca.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.100]  Tundra.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.100]  Texas gas.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.010]  Snake oil.
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.010]  Some pretty pebbles.
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.010]  Stardog.
[01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:10.010]  Yeah, I got a lot of stuff.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:31.620]  Yeah, we'll have to come back to that.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.380]  Yeah, we'll have to come back in the daytime.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.380]  Yeah, it's dark out here.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.380]  They look pretty happy though.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.420]  Yeah, man. I'm loving the big finger leafs on those things.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.420]  I'm just picturing like...
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.420]  Yeah, this is a mango by KC Brains, I think.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.420]  Yeah.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.420]  Okay.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.420]  This is a blue haze by Biofish.
[01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:08.390]  Blue haze.
[01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:11.390]  Blue haze. Wow.
[01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:15.390]  Have you ever...
[01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:20.390]  Do you see a strain of puna butter out there a lot?
[01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.390]  Oh, I actually just got into this.
[01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.390]  I just got into growing.
[01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:29.390]  Oh, cool, cool.
[01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.390]  It's fun, man. It is fun.
[01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.390]  Ooh, nice. Nice color there.
[01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:49.410]  Yeah, it looks like three finger leafs on that.
[01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:51.410]  Yeah? Isn't that...
[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.410]  They call that the duck foot usually?
[01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:56.410]  Yeah, I'm not too sure.
[01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:58.410]  I got this from my friend on the road.
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:00.410]  He's actually a breeder.
[01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.410]  It's a haystring.
[01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.410]  So, most of us...
[01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.410]  ...but aren't an original.
[01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.410]  That's cool.
[01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.410]  And this is a...
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:16.170]  And this is the other one.
[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.170]  Strawberry on a mallow leaf.
[01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:24.270]  Nice.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]  Yeah, pretty dark though over here.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]  Yeah, it's late.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400]  I got the artificial sun.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]  There's a little solar light right there.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.060]  This is my supplemental lighting right here.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.060]  It provides the...
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.060]  ...sustenance.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820]  Is that...
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.820]  That stays on during the night time?
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.820]  Yeah, 24 hours from dusk to dawn.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.820]  Okay.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820]  So, they just get sun during the day.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.820]  Yeah.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:02.820]  Full sun.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.820]  There was...
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.820]  So, one of the things that people talk about is, you know, like light leaks.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.820]  And, oh, if you get light leaks and there's a strain that's genetically predisposed to the sun.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.820]  And it's genetically predisposed to herming.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.820]  Light leaks can trigger it.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.820]  And that's definitely true.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.820]  But there was a study and it hasn't concluded.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820]  I'd love it when it does.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:35.820]  But what they were actually testing was the spectrum of light and the intensity of light.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.820]  Because full moons, man, you can see your shadow in a full moon.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.820]  But that full moon doesn't make all the plants hermy.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.820]  So, we know they can handle a certain amount of light.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.820]  It's just before they thought, you know, they were looking at it like, well, how much light?
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.820]  Now that they're a little bit more refined in their approach, okay, well, what spectrum is it?
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:03.820]  What spectrum and what intensity in the different spectrums is going to trigger the herming?
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.820]  There's, you know, sometimes people will put...
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.820]  It doesn't necessarily apply to your situation.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.820]  But the little lights on your power strip or little LCD readout screens on some of the gear you have.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:22.820]  People go far enough to put electrical tape over it.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.820]  Just better safe than sorry.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820]  Yeah.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.820]  I never really had a herming problem.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.820]  I did when I had a motion sensor.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.820]  Okay.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.820]  And that would make sense.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:39.820]  The flickering was causing it, you know.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.820]  Yeah, that totally would be my guess.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.580]  It's like one of those that I missed, you know.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.580]  Transplant.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.580]  I transplanted too late.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.580]  Like a big bud auto that turned into a little bud.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580]  Nice.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.580]  I'm running my first big bud right now.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.580]  That was one of the ones in the flower.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.580]  And I'm about to pop my first auto flowers ever.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.580]  I've never grown auto flowers, but we're going to be doing that for the GR420 contest.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:15.340]  Just a little grow off with auto flowers.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.340]  I'll toss my hand in that ring because I want to test something.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.340]  Again, there's so much speculation out there.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.340]  I don't know if anybody truly knows the answer to this one.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.340]  A lot of people have what makes the auto flower flower.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.340]  Other than time.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.340]  Some people say, well, dude, when the taproot hits the bottom, that's when it starts to flower.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.340]  I've seen that repeated.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340]  Can't find anything to back it up.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.100]  I've seen it enough.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.100]  I'm going to do a one gallon, a two gallon, and a three gallon.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.100]  We'll see which one flowers first.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.100]  We probably know which one's going to hit the bottom first.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.100]  Yeah, so auto flowers.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100]  I'm sorry to go off on a tangent there.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.100]  Those are looking pretty close.
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:06.430]  Yeah, this one is a critical bubble by Kyle Cushman.
[01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.430]  Nice.
[01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:13.190]  Things are looking a bit frosty.
[01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:31.780]  What is the humidity like where you're at?
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.780]  Is it really, really humid or do you get pretty mellow?
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.780]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.780]  It's humid all the time.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.780]  Okay.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:43.780]  All the time.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.780]  Every day.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.780]  Right now it's humid.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.780]  Yeah.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.780]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:10:01.540]  I'm in a coastal area, too, so I don't get too much of a fluctuation between night and day temperatures.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540]  And actually winter and summer, for that matter.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.540]  Everything kind of stays in the middle zone.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.540]  Do you get really big swings between the night and the day temps there?
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.540]  Sometimes.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:19.540]  Sometimes it's nice and cool and then it gets crazy hot.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.540]  Then it gets cool again during the night.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.540]  It chills all day.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.540]  You can drop down to 50s, but during the day it's like 80, 90.
[01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:34.870]  Like right now the winter is what, you know, kind of weird.
[01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:37.870]  Yeah.
[01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:40.870]  Are you at elevation?
[01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.870]  Not really.
[01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:48.960]  Okay.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  So how long do those typically run for you?
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  A lot of what I'm doing is the 60-day strains, the nine-week strains.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  Since those are hazes, do they go a little bit longer out there?
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:16.850]  Yeah, but I usually just leave mine on the light for 24 hours.
[01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:21.850]  I just like to get them pretty huge as well.
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:23.850]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.820]  This one right here, it's in the five gallon.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:34.560]  Oh yeah, that's a big boy.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]  Big lady.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.160]  Yeah.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.160]  Yeah, so I was planning on sticking these into a 35.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.160]  Yeah, it's getting bushy.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.160]  I mean, it looks like they have pretty good spacing in there.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.160]  It's not super compact where you would worry about too much mold with the humidity there.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  Do you ever defoliate any of the strains out there?
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.160]  Yeah, I try to defoliate pretty often.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.160]  I like the hedge look.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  You know, because it provides a little bit of privacy.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.160]  I like to just let it go.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.160]  Yeah, it's like the world's coolest privacy screen.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  Right?
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160]  Yeah, I get that.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.920]  Yeah, and then these are some cuttings.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:57.180]  These are some cuttings that are supposedly like 20 years old.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:02.180]  I mean, came from something that was like 20 years, going around for 20 years.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.180]  Yeah.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180]  There's...
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.180]  Surfer OG.
[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.210]  Surfer OG.
[01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:17.210]  I bet, man, I bet there are some great strains there that kind of stay on the islands.
[01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:20.210]  And those are the true treasures.
[01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:23.210]  I went down there to...
[01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.210]  I've been to a couple of the islands there.
[01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:32.210]  But one of the most memorable weeds I had there, it tasted exactly like I was smoking hash.
[01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.210]  It wasn't hash.
[01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.210]  It was green buds.
[01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:40.970]  But man, it had that spicy, just old pressed hash taste to it.
[01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:43.970]  And I have no idea what the strain was, though.
[01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:45.970]  Freaking phenomenal.
[01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:48.970]  Yeah, I just like...
[01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:50.970]  I think it was only like three years.
[01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.970]  I think it's only like the last three years I got into this.
[01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:56.970]  But I was like...
[01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:01.970]  I did landscaping, irrigation, and agriculture.
[01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.970]  For a good amount of time, like 15 years now.
[01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:07.970]  I did it professionally.
[01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:09.970]  I kind of already had the experience.
[01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.970]  And I took some classes.
[01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:17.970]  I took the integrated pest management class on accident, technically.
[01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:21.970]  I took it trying to kill stuff, you know.
[01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:24.970]  I wanted to kill stuff, but I had to take that class first.
[01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:28.970]  I ended up just cutting it out there and then stopped it.
[01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:30.970]  I went on a poison trip.
[01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:34.730]  You're stuck with the integrated pest management course, you know.
[01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:36.730]  Yeah.
[01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:43.730]  At the commercial facility, there was a lot of spraying going on.
[01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:45.730]  I'll put it that way.
[01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:50.730]  I spray, but I use like an organicide.
[01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.730]  Yeah, they were good at that.
[01:14:53.730 --> 01:15:01.260]  I haven't heard of that one myself, but that sounds like an organic spray.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.020]  Sounds like an organic option.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.020]  It's not Eagle 20.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020]  Okay.
[01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:15.310]  Oil, fish oil.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.100]  It smells kind of crazy, you know.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]  It smells like fish oil, but...
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.100]  I mean, you get used to it after a while.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]  It works pretty good.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.100]  It doesn't alter the flavor much.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.100]  If you stop, you know, you don't want to keep spraying oil to the end of the bar.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860]  No.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860]  But it works pretty fine.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860]  Good.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.860]  Yeah, you definitely don't want to spray the buds.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.860]  Yeah, that's good that it works.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.860]  I like that it says, be safe, too, on there.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:50.860]  That's a big thing.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.860]  We need our pollinators.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860]  We got to keep those things buzzing around.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.860]  Yeah.
[01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:07.050]  What are some of the pests you're battling with?
[01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:10.050]  In Hawaii?
[01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:15.050]  We have like russet mice, which is like the worst thing.
[01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:24.050]  We have apes, gillibirds, floor beetles, sand beetles.
[01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:34.050]  I mean, but to me, the worst thing that I ever dealt with was the russet mice, you know.
[01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:40.810]  It was like, it hit me one time when I had like six foot, I never expected that.
[01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:43.810]  I didn't expect that at all.
[01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:49.810]  Like that is one bug I never really encountered doing landscaping kinds of stuff.
[01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:59.810]  And then in here, you know, like with this plant, it's just more of those, like, not like this.
[01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:05.570]  Herbs and stuff, you know, something that that bug likes to eat.
[01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:10.570]  And I got hit with it one year and it made me give up.
[01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:12.570]  It messed with me so bad.
[01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:17.570]  Yeah, that's one of my fears of doing outside growing.
[01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:22.570]  It's a totally different world when it comes to IPM.
[01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:25.570]  And other aspects, too.
[01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:27.570]  You don't have control like you do with the plants.
[01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:29.330]  And other aspects, too.
[01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:31.330]  You don't have control like you do indoors.
[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.330]  But outdoors, you're kind of at the mercy of what is local and what is neighboring.
[01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:44.330]  So russet mites, I always kind of recommend people burn the building, usually.
[01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:48.330]  I usually, I have one around.
[01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:50.330]  I have one right now.
[01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:52.330]  And it's for, I leave it there for bait.
[01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:54.330]  Okay, yeah.
[01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:57.090]  So the rest, it doesn't bother all of these, you know.
[01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.090]  So a little trap plant.
[01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:01.090]  You know what you could do?
[01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:06.090]  I mean, it looks like you had, you know, you might have a couple to spare there.
[01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:10.090]  Plants that are healthier.
[01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:16.090]  Yeah, healthier plants aren't going to get attacked as frequently as a plant that's weak.
[01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:21.090]  So if you have something in your garden and you have enough space to kind of spread things out.
[01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:27.850]  Yeah, you might plant that kind of that trap plant to see what's colonizing yourself.
[01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:29.850]  If the sticky traps aren't working.
[01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:35.850]  Or if you do know that you have some things and you're not able to just kind of clean the slate.
[01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:37.850]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:42.850]  Just kind of sacrifice the weaker ones and hopefully they'll stay away from the stronger ones.
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:44.850]  Because they have a better target.
[01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:46.850]  Yeah, I got one around the corner.
[01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:48.850]  I'm trying to look.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.220]  It is dark in Hawaii.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.220]  But yet, they're still in a t-shirt and sandals.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.220]  I'm jealous.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.220]  Well, what am I talking about?
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.220]  You're in Hawaii, Peter.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.220]  You've got probably nice weather, too.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:23.220]  Oh yeah, no, today was a satisfying day.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220]  Good.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:29.980]  Carnivorous plants as companion plants.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.980]  John Doe KCK.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.980]  I have not.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.980]  That is an interesting concept.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:42.980]  Yeah, it'd be cool to have.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.980]  Might catch a few fungus gnats here and there, but they're definitely not going to be a good match.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:50.980]  It's a very slow, slow strategy.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.980]  Yeah, but it looks cool.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.420]  Yeah, I think like I...
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.420]  Aphids are hammering my strawberry plants right now.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:13.420]  And because I only have like five of them, I've just been drilling them with, you know,
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:21.420]  I have like a hose with a handle on the end and like different modes.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.420]  And I've just been drilling the aphids.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:29.180]  You know, like today, I think I hit them three times and I'm just like,
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.180]  you guys will be uncomfortable and unhappy.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.180]  And I want to see how long until I can get the population down.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.180]  Yeah.
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:47.180]  Are you trying any kind of like biological control or like Spinosad or anything chemical like that?
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.180]  I'm going to.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.180]  Yeah, I'm going to play with like Lost Coast and other stuff.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:01.940]  But I want to see if just that, you know, obviously this isn't a scalable strategy, but
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.940]  someone said, Magma said strawberries do better with some cloth.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.940]  Strawberries like really warm soil.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.940]  So you will see a lot of soil coverings when you're growing strawberries.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.940]  That's kind of the key to get them kicking off.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.700]  What's interesting is.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:28.700]  So I have five fabric pots with the strawberries growing.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.700]  One of them is just a kind of soil mix.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.700]  Four of them are.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.700]  Pit mosses.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.700]  It's basically pit moss, which is the shredded newspaper,
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:48.460]  recycled newspaper and chicken manure.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.460]  And those are the ones that primarily have the aphids.
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.460]  And the one that's in just kind of the old soil mix that I had doesn't have them.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:01.460]  And I don't know if that's.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.460]  If there's a correlation or if it's just random, but I think we just lost him, but
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.220]  we will we will hit him again in the daytime one day.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:19.220]  Yeah, give us a tour, a tour of the Hawaiian Islands.
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.220]  Oh, jealous.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:27.220]  But maybe we'll get Greg McAllister to make a cameo.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.220]  Yes, Greg, I would appreciate that because.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:39.220]  I am nobody and you can talk to me and there's no way I'm going to talk to you.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.220]  There's no judging and I don't know, I'll just babble until you come on, Greg.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.220]  So how about that?
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:47.220]  I agree with that.
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.220]  I'd love to talk to somebody like you.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.220]  Oh, let's see.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.220]  It's flashing, flashing by the.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.220]  Flashing by chat there for a second.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.220]  No, no worries.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.220]  You were a sport.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.220]  Oh, that was you, bro.
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.220]  That is that's cool.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.980]  OK, I do know that's cool.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.980]  You know, I do know.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:23.980]  So that's what any any any topics you want to hit on.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:32.980]  Not off the top of my head for now, I want to save all the good stuff for later, but
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:39.740]  I'll just preface this, you know, again, you know, 808, I know you through chat.
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:41.740]  I've seen you before.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.740]  We've talked back and forth.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740]  I love that.
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.740]  I want to hear from a lot of you guys.
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.740]  I want to talk to a lot of the people that are growing intense.
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.740]  I want to talk to people that aren't afraid to come on and maybe show something that they're
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.740]  having a problem with or something that, you know, my is totally overgrown.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:23:59.740]  I know how to solve that.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.500]  And I'm trying to test different things right now.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500]  So I want to talk to a lot of you folks.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.500]  I just got on Instagram today.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.500]  You see, you see this gray, right?
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.500]  I know it's all a lie, man.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:19.500]  I did a ton of social media in my music days, and that's why I don't touch it at all now.
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500]  But I just started an Instagram today.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500]  I want to be able to connect with a lot of you guys.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:32.260]  I've been traditional email guy, and that's worked to a certain extent.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:35.260]  But all of you are over there.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:40.260]  Someone wanted to know when you're going to run the cookies, the full cookies lineup.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:46.260]  Bro, you're probably my friend already on Instagram and saw my shirt.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:55.260]  That's not going to happen anytime soon, but I will put an invitation out there to Berner.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.260]  Berner, you are welcome to come on.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.260]  I will humor you.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.260]  I'll be nice if you come on and we'll play together.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.260]  But that'll never happen.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.260]  So, yeah, I might run cookies sometime soon.
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.260]  Let me cue up your Instagram. Hold on.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:21.260]  Dude, to tell you how gray I am, somebody had sent me a message.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.260]  They were stoked that I was on there.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.260]  I'm like, dude, you're the first friend on here.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.260]  I'm still sending out friend requests.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.260]  Dude, it's not friend requests on there.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.260]  I don't know. I'm not hip.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.260]  It's not Friendster.
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.260]  They were talking Napster the other day or last night.
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.260]  Yeah, I binged on Napster back in the day.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260]  That was the most amazing thing ever.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260]  That was like life changing.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]  Yes.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.260]  Dude, to a musician making music, music wasn't accessible.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.020]  So I remember pulling the Love Boat theme song
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020]  and just getting samples from all these different sources.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.020]  Napster was awesome.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.020]  Yes.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.020]  So at Chad.Westport.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.020]  That's me on Instagram.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.020]  I only have a couple posts up.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.020]  But please.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:22.020]  I love the proud grower of plants with 0% cookies genetics.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.020]  Yeah.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.780]  Twin Peaks Cannabis.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.780]  Yep.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:33.780]  That's a little throwback to my area, the Twin Peaks.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.780]  But yeah, proud grower of plants with 0% cookies genetics.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.780]  So proud that I made a damn t-shirt.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.780]  So actually, let's talk the audio scene.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.780]  Because you work with rain, right?
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:53.780]  I did.
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.780]  In 2016, rain sold to a company that has been buying.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:05.780]  They own like M-Audio, Akai, Vestex, Newmark, Denon.
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:12.780]  So yeah, in 2016, that company bought the name rain from the owners.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:20.780]  And within two weeks of owning it, closed the doors and moved all the jobs overseas.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.780]  Wow.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.540]  Yeah.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.540]  Where are they based?
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.540]  Their headquarters is in Connecticut, I believe.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:31.540]  It's in music.
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.540]  But it's kind of one of those companies.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.540]  The headquarters is in Connecticut.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.540]  I don't know if you've ever seen those projects.
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.540]  It's like conceptualized in the United States.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.540]  Rendered in Canada.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.540]  Built in Mexico.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.540]  It's kind of one of those companies.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.540]  Their headquarters is in the US.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.300]  Not too much gets done from there.
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:28:00.300]  Did you know Future Music back in the day?
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.300]  It's like a website, review site.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.300]  I want to say it sounds familiar.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:13.300]  But there was probably so many different Future Music, like festivals or Future Music.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.300]  This or that.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.300]  I don't specifically remember that, no.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.300]  What you're talking about.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:25.060]  The guy who started it, I worked with him a little bit in New York.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.060]  But anyway, if you don't know what it is, then never mind.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:38.060]  Did Future Music focus more on production than actual audio, than the DJs or whatnot?
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:51.820]  It was like a blog that focused on product reviews of DJ software, production stuff.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.820]  Yes, I think I do.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:00.820]  And they always had the sample CD of 500 free royalty free samples on the cover.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.820]  That I do not remember.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.820]  Okay, there was a mag like that.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.580]  I'm going to grab some real quick.
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:09.580]  Let's see here.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.580]  Let's see if you remember this magazine.
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.580]  He wants the Rain 1 controller.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:20.580]  You remember this magazine, DJ Mag?
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580]  There we go.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.580]  Best sound card so far, 2013 baby.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.580]  Actually, hold on.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.580]  I got to keep this thing.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.580]  This thing is heavy too.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.580]  I got to keep this thing.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.580]  Rain, Rain, SL4.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.580]  Yes.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.200]  Hold on.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.200]  One of my prizes.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.200]  My prize.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.200]  Babies.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200]  I'll always keep you.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.780]  Okay, I'm going to...
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:06.780]  So, for people that don't know what Rain is, while you're looking that up,
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.780]  Rain was a hardware company.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780]  They were a mixer company.
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:16.780]  They got involved with a lot of the DMCs, a lot of the battle type mixing.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.780]  So, pretty big in hip hop.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.780]  Then, they had partnered...
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.780]  We partnered with a company, Serato, which was in New Zealand.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:26.780]  They were a software company.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.780]  And the software was, at that time, it was called Scratch Live.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.780]  Now it's Serato DJ.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.780]  But if you DJ these days, you 100% know what I'm talking about.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:42.540]  And it's kind of one of those weird mixed emotions too,
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.540]  because I come from the days of having to lug crates and crates of records,
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:48.540]  which are really heavy.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.540]  The days where you have to learn how to beat match.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:52.540]  The days where you have to...
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:55.540]  I don't miss the days of lugging records.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.540]  When I was in New York, in the middle of the winter,
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.540]  when you'd have to go out and try to catch a cab.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.540]  Yeah.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.540]  Yeah, I don't miss it.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.300]  I'm so glad for that advancement, but at the same time,
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.300]  we kind of...
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.300]  What do you want to do as a business?
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.300]  You want to open the doors and increase the accessibility to people.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.300]  And it really opened the doors to a lot of people to become DJs.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.300]  So, I just found what I was looking for.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.300]  So, let me know if you can hear the audio on this.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.300]  Okay.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720]  Oh.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.540]  So, anyway.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.540]  Are you able to hear me, Peter?
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.540]  Yes.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.540]  Okay, cool.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.540]  I wasn't getting a reading on the little microphone here.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.540]  Sorry.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:14.540]  Could you...
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.540]  Oh, you didn't hear anything.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.540]  All right.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.540]  I heard it.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.540]  So, yeah.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:28.300]  I held a concert of his in Central Park and basically had...
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.300]  I convinced him to let me do it.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:36.300]  And I, with no budget, I just gave a bunch of my friends...
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:41.300]  I gave each of them a camera and was just like,
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:47.300]  just go anywhere and just film and don't stop the record.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.300]  Like, don't stop recording.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.300]  Yeah.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.060]  And then afterwards, I pieced it all together.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:01.060]  And it was like, you know, it was like perfect summer day.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.060]  It was fun.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.060]  Yeah.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:09.060]  And Central Park, that looked like a pretty awesome stage, too.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:15.060]  So, Paul Van Dyke in that era, any era really, but I saw 2006 there.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.060]  That was...
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.060]  Yeah, that would be the height.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.820]  People can hear the crickets in my garage right now, I think.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:26.820]  They're like a metronome.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:28.820]  They're singing.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.820]  Total metronomes over there.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.820]  I got started in like 98, 99 is when I...
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:43.820]  I was DJing before that, but I got my first paycheck for DJing in 99.
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:46.820]  So that's when I always say I started, was in 99.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.580]  It's when you start getting paid for it.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.580]  But yeah, so going through that era, the early 2000s,
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:57.580]  that was kind of the height of American rave scene.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.580]  And to be completely honest, it was the crack house law that ended it.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.580]  Basically meaning if you were a promoter and people were selling drugs in the building
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580]  where you then, the promoter, are responsible for it.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:14.580]  So that put a lot of liability on the people throwing these parties
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.580]  and that kind of killed it.
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.580]  We all know with budget cuts right now, there ain't nobody out there.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.580]  They got better things to do.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.580]  So the warehouse parties are alive.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:27.580]  They're coming back.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.580]  Yes, they will be.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:31.580]  They will be.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:33.580]  That's funny.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.580]  That's cool though.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.580]  Paul Van Dyke is huge.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:45.580]  He was one of the bigger, bigger names to do it for sure.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.340]  It was insane realizing what some of these guys pulled in each year.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:53.340]  I don't know what the top DJ is.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:56.340]  It's like 20, 30 million dollars a year.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.340]  Yeah, easily.
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:06.340]  Again, working at Rain, what I did is I supported the DJ product.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:13.340]  So if you had a problem with it, you talk to me or three of my other friends.
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:15.340]  There were only four of us.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.340]  We were together at a record store for many years.
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:21.340]  We all DJ together for pretty much a decade before that.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:26.340]  But yeah, I got to talk to a lot of pretty cool people.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:29.340]  A lot of cool people use that product.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.340]  And that led to some pretty interesting conversations and situations.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.340]  People are dating themselves.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:41.340]  This is the DJs who were big in the 90s and early 2000s, late 90s.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.340]  Yes, Paul Oakenfold.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.100]  Oh gosh.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.100]  Sasha and Digweed.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.100]  Pete Tong.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.100]  Pete Tong is still doing the Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.100]  Yeah.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.100]  Which I love.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.100]  Sasha and Digweed.
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:06.100]  We, we, I'm not under, I don't think I'm a, I won't talk about it.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.100]  But I met, I met Sasha.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.100]  He came, he came to Rain once.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.100]  That was pretty cool.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860]  Yeah, I see Tiesto.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:15.860]  Yes.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:17.860]  Yes.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.860]  Orbital I loved, or I still love.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:22.860]  Yep. Orbital is great.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:26.860]  Oh, let's see here.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:28.860]  Jungle.
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:31.860]  That's my guy right there.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.860]  Worthy Buzz.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.860]  So Ed Rush and Optical, Bad Company, Ram Recordings.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.860]  Those, Renegade Hardware was my favorite label.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620]  We had a lot of those guys out.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:48.620]  If you look up like US Jungle, US Drum and Bass, it's Seattle is going to come up.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.620]  And the Baltic Room, Baltic Room Tuesdays is going to come up.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:58.620]  That we had basically a UK get every Tuesday straight.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.620]  I mean, most people don't tour on Tuesdays, so they always came to Seattle.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.620]  And we had, it's still up until COVID.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:12.380]  It was the longest running drum and bass, consecutive drum and bass night in the country.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:17.380]  The Concrete Jungle from New York City, which is probably what you went to, Peter.
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:20.380]  That was the oldest, longest running one.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.380]  But Baltic Room Drum and Bass Tuesdays in Seattle.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.380]  Can't beat it.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.380]  Hands down, best drum and bass on the West Coast.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.380]  The LA Junglist Platoon might disagree, but hey, they're cool too.
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.140]  You guys got good drum and bass down there.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.140]  Yep, Hospital Records, I see.
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.140]  Good night, CD.
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.140]  Hospital Records, love a lot of that stuff.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:56.140]  Actually, from doing it so long, there's a lot of people releasing stuff on some of these labels right now.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:59.140]  But yeah, it's fun, man.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.140]  It's fun being old.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.140]  It is beatport kind of thing.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:14.900]  Is beatport kind of the dominant, like in terms of, I remember, I would download a lot of stuff from there.
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:16.900]  Yeah.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:20.900]  I still have my login for beatport.
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:22.900]  I'll go there every now and then.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  Kind of another side advantage, and they were just lifetime memberships of working at Rainn.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:33.660]  There's a lot of record pools out there, and they always wanted you to see what they thought.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.660]  So I'm still a member of like five different record pools.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:42.660]  Which if I wanted, I pretty much go there and one of them will have it.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:48.660]  So I'm able to just kind of download the music there instead of paying for it on beatport.
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.660]  Sorry, artists.
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.660]  You know how hard it is?
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.660]  There's one artist that I really love.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:57.660]  Well, there's many, but Breakage.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.420]  He started out as a drum and bass DJ.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.420]  He does a lot of bass music these days.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.420]  He actually does a lot of production for pop people now, because he's just that awesome.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:13.420]  Roots Manuva, he's like, his bass is so deep, you think he's talking to Sea Life.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:21.420]  But Breakage, I wanted to buy his album, and I didn't want to go through a beatport or a place like that,
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:27.180]  because I wanted the artist to get as much money from me as I could give to him,
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:29.180]  because I wanted to support like that.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:33.180]  I had to go to page three of Google to find where to buy it.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:37.180]  The first three pages were where I could download it for free, but yeah.
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.180]  I had to go to page three to find where to pay the man.
[01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:45.090]  Yeah, I like Roots Manuva.
[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:49.090]  Yeah.
[01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:51.090]  Yeah, hip hop.
[01:40:51.850 --> 01:40:52.850]  I don't know.
[01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:57.850]  So is anybody out there, one of the artists we built, a couple artists we built custom mixers for.
[01:40:58.850 --> 01:41:01.850]  One was Fatboy Slim, who is a fricking riot.
[01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:09.850]  We built a custom mixer for him, and we also built a custom model that actually went into production for DJ Z-Trip.
[01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:19.850]  He does a lot of stuff with LL Cool J, a lot with Shepard Fairey, the Obey Giant artist guy.
[01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:26.610]  But he really brought in kind of the mashup or he popularized the mashup.
[01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:35.610]  And I'm just curious if anybody in chat knows of the Uneasy Listening Volume 1, DJ P and Z-Trip.
[01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:38.610]  That is a seminal mix.
[01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:46.610]  Yep, Groski808, Z-Trip did have that rain model, and that was fun to work with him.
[01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:48.370]  Trying to put things together.
[01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:53.370]  When we unveiled it at NAMM every January, there's the North American Music Merchants.
[01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:59.370]  It's closed to the public, but that's where all the companies come and show their new gear.
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:04.370]  And they want all the buyers in their booths, so they always invite cool people.
[01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:14.370]  And so when the Z-Trip model came out, we invited him, and he came down to the booth and hung out all weekend and did a bunch of drop-in sets.
[01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:18.130]  Ziggy D, Fatboy Slim is effing in heaven.
[01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:21.130]  Yes, my...
[01:42:22.130 --> 01:42:25.130]  What, what, Rockefeller Skank, that was probably my introduction to Fatboy Slim.
[01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:29.130]  Probably most people's right about now, the Funk's Old Brother.
[01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.130]  The Funk's Old Brother right about now, yeah.
[01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.130]  Yep, the Rockefeller Skank.
[01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:39.130]  I remember Kruder and Dorfmeister when the KND sessions dropped.
[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:43.130]  That was influential on me.
[01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:47.890]  I see Big Worm. What's up, Big Worm? He's saying Growmouse is cool.
[01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:52.890]  And I saw it for the longest time. I'm like, what if Growmouse was really Deadmau5?
[01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:54.890]  They have the same helmet.
[01:42:55.890 --> 01:42:56.890]  That would be cool.
[01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:01.890]  Deadmau5, not only a producer, he grows killer weed too.
[01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:10.290]  Well, why don't we call it a night?
[01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:12.290]  Yes.
[01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:15.050]  This is just giving people a little taste.
[01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:25.050]  So you're going to be our Home Grow Tips and Tricks correspondent, our field correspondent.
[01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:31.050]  Yeah, I want to try to make things just understandable and digestible for people.
[01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:37.050]  There's a lot of great knowledge out there and there's a lot of freaking fantastic knowledge on this channel.
[01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:39.810]  And it can seem really overwhelming.
[01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:47.810]  But once you understand it, again, to go back to audio, those big, huge mixing boards, the big six...
[01:43:48.810 --> 01:43:50.810]  I'm one of the crickets now. Yes.
[01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:53.810]  You blend in. I like your ghillie suit there.
[01:43:56.810 --> 01:44:01.810]  But the big boards, those big mixing boards, they're so huge, they're so intimidating.
[01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:08.570]  But if I told you every inch strip does the exact same thing, it would be a lot less intimidating.
[01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:17.570]  So what I wanted to try to do is help teach people that one strip so they can go in front of that big intimidating thing and just be confident and rock it.
[01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:25.570]  So, yeah, I want to help a lot of the home growers and a lot of people just trying to provide their own medicine.
[01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:33.330]  And if you're not that proud of your tent or if you're feeling good, hit me up on Instagram because I want to talk to you about it.
[01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:35.330]  Please.
[01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:42.330]  And maybe you can see if Fatboy Slim wants to come on with us to talk growing weed.
[01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:46.330]  Good old Norman. I... Dude.
[01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:49.330]  Hmm. I wonder.
[01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:53.330]  All we can do is ask.
[01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:59.090]  Yeah. Well, right about now, my future cannabis brother.
[01:45:00.090 --> 01:45:01.090]  I appreciate it.
[01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:07.090]  All right. With that, I'm going to go to bed.
[01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:14.090]  I have no idea what time it is for everyone else, but we're nearing midnight.
[01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:18.090]  I was up, I think, till one last night.
[01:45:18.850 --> 01:45:23.850]  Basically, after last night, I hit the fridge and just destroyed everything in there.
[01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:27.850]  Are you going to do the same?
[01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:31.850]  Tonight? Probably not.
[01:45:32.610 --> 01:45:48.610]  And actually, so tomorrow I'm going to go set up a four by four tent up at Tom's house, who some people may recognize from past videos.
[01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:54.610]  But so we can we can broadcast from there, too.
[01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:57.370]  And I'm trying to think, I think.
[01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:07.830]  Sunday we have because James has already sent me.
[01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:12.830]  OK, so this Sunday we have Peli.
[01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:20.830]  Talking about the legend of champagne and then next Sunday, Soma.
[01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:24.590]  But yeah, so there's probably going to be something between now and Sunday.
[01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:29.590]  But as far as I know, the next thing is Sunday.
[01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:31.590]  Are you streaming this set?
[01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:39.590]  Potentially I could, although it's more relaxing just to set it up.
[01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:44.590]  I actually I set up I mean, with all these tents, it's like, right, like,
[01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:47.590]  I'm going to set up a four by four tent.
[01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:53.350]  It's like, right, like it takes a minute to set the actual tent up.
[01:46:57.350 --> 01:47:01.350]  But anyway, with that.
[01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:05.350]  Doubt I can make the live, but can't wait to.
[01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:07.350]  Oh, that's for the Sunday.
[01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:14.350]  I like that. Damn it, Siri.
[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:16.350]  The name is Westport.
[01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:19.350]  Damn it.
[01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:21.350]  That's awesome.
[01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:23.350]  Everybody's Siri is going off right now, too.
[01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:27.350]  So, all right.
[01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:31.350]  Well, so, yeah, we'll figure out loosely.
[01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:34.350]  I think we're going to be on what in every other week schedule.
[01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:36.350]  Yeah, that would be good.
[01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:38.350]  Every other week schedule.
[01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:44.350]  That way I can, you know, just kind of keep it fresh and talk, talk good to people.
[01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:47.110]  That's such an incompleteness.
[01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:49.110]  It's OK.
[01:47:50.110 --> 01:47:51.110]  Nobody's judging.
[01:47:52.110 --> 01:47:53.110]  All right.
[01:47:53.110 --> 01:47:57.110]  Well, everyone have a good night or a good start of your day.
[01:47:58.110 --> 01:47:59.110]  I'm trying to think of.
[01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:01.110]  Yeah, I guess in.
[01:48:02.110 --> 01:48:03.110]  It's like nine hours ahead.
[01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.110]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:06.110]  So it's midnight.
[01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:08.110]  So, yeah, people in like Amsterdam and Barcelona.
[01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:10.110]  9 a.m.
[01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.110]  Yeah.
[01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:14.870]  I've got London, Amsterdam and Barcelona down.
[01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:15.870]  That's about it.
[01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:19.870]  We're still we're still talking DJs.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.720]  So, all right.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.720]  Well, with that, let's call it.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:31.720]  Officially at eleven forty nine p.m.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.720]  Pacific time.
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.720]  So thanks, everyone.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720]  Thank you, guys.
