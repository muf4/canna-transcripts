[00:12.410 --> 00:15.650]  All right, welcome back everybody.
[00:15.650 --> 00:21.970]  Thank you for joining us on another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:21.970 --> 00:26.530]  I get the pleasure of saying this is going to be a fun one every episode.
[00:26.530 --> 00:32.290]  And I know because, John, we talked yesterday for a little while and, oh man, we've got
[00:32.290 --> 00:36.170]  so many fun things that we could go on about and I want to get to those.
[00:36.170 --> 00:41.050]  But please first say hello and introduce yourself to everybody out there who may or may not
[00:41.050 --> 00:43.490]  be familiar with you already.
[00:43.490 --> 00:46.410]  I'm John Matsos, I'm a home grower.
[00:46.410 --> 00:50.210]  I live in Brookline, Massachusetts, home of Danny Danko.
[00:50.210 --> 00:51.570]  Shout out to Danny Danko.
[00:51.570 --> 00:53.210]  I don't really know him that well.
[00:53.210 --> 00:57.730]  I'm a couple years older than him, but I used to go to his older brother's parties up on
[00:57.730 --> 00:59.730]  Summit Hill back in the day.
[00:59.730 --> 01:07.730]  But anyway, so I'm a home grower, a passionate gardener.
[01:07.730 --> 01:15.410]  The plant really has been the gateway to me growing vegetables and trying to grow
[01:15.410 --> 01:18.950]  everything that I can in my little suburban area.
[01:18.950 --> 01:24.690]  And I aspire to have more space to, I can't ever get, you know, we probably all have the
[01:24.690 --> 01:26.770]  same big box of seeds we can't get through.
[01:26.770 --> 01:31.410]  So right now it's like really, but I don't just want to grow cannabis.
[01:31.410 --> 01:36.930]  I want to grow everything and get back to the, you know, growing truly wholesome medicine
[01:36.930 --> 01:44.570]  and, you know, and teach and educate.
[01:44.570 --> 01:47.610]  You know, because I grew up in the city, so I wasn't ever really exposed to all this.
[01:47.610 --> 01:50.530]  So it came kind of later on in life, like, oh my God.
[01:50.530 --> 01:55.450]  And then when we learn all about the soil food web and all these things and all the
[01:55.450 --> 02:03.410]  marvels that we can't even explain that we're so kind of arrogant or, you know, we're not
[02:03.410 --> 02:08.430]  humble enough about what we don't understand and what we take for granted.
[02:08.430 --> 02:11.410]  So it's just every time I push this, like, why wasn't I not taught that?
[02:11.410 --> 02:17.050]  So I'm probably going off on a tangent, but I'm at the point in my life where I want to
[02:17.050 --> 02:18.050]  give back.
[02:18.050 --> 02:23.490]  I want to teach and I want to grow and like, you know, not necessarily be off the grid,
[02:23.530 --> 02:30.930]  but try and make my footprint and, you know, take any way I can be more ethical, you know,
[02:30.930 --> 02:34.930]  efficacy and, you know, related to the environment.
[02:34.930 --> 02:39.650]  And, you know, and I look up to so many people that I aspire to do.
[02:40.050 --> 02:42.210]  I don't know if I have that work.
[02:42.210 --> 02:50.810]  It's not easy, but I'm thinking about buying some land and having a farm and have
[02:50.810 --> 02:51.770]  aspirations like that.
[02:51.770 --> 02:58.250]  And so some good friends of mine and hopefully we can get make something even more of this
[02:58.250 --> 03:04.730]  and promote, you know, to, you know, this plant and this this master plant and how
[03:04.730 --> 03:11.650]  wonderful it can be and introducing everybody into kind of healthier living as a whole.
[03:12.330 --> 03:13.730]  And that would be, you know, ideal.
[03:13.730 --> 03:17.490]  I think that is kind of a goal for a lot of us is to get that, you know, the piece of
[03:17.490 --> 03:20.050]  land to be able to move out to do a little farming.
[03:20.050 --> 03:21.730]  And you don't really need much to farm.
[03:21.730 --> 03:25.890]  I mean, a quarter acre is going to produce so much food, more food than like the typical
[03:25.890 --> 03:27.650]  average family can handle.
[03:29.090 --> 03:32.250]  But, you know, you mentioned it came to you later in life.
[03:32.250 --> 03:34.850]  It came it definitely came later to me in life.
[03:34.850 --> 03:39.170]  Like my teenage self could have cared less about nature, could have cared less about,
[03:39.170 --> 03:43.010]  you know, any of this because I was a city kid, you know, I was doing city things.
[03:43.330 --> 03:47.170]  And the more I got to kind of slow down, the more I got into these things.
[03:47.730 --> 03:49.890]  One thing we talked about, maybe we could go into it now.
[03:49.890 --> 03:54.530]  Yesterday was just kind of like the gut biome and then like the soil biome and how that
[03:54.530 --> 03:58.290]  all relates. You know, these things kind of have turned me on.
[03:58.290 --> 04:04.450]  It's like it's interesting how cannabis has led to health knowledge and health knowledge
[04:04.450 --> 04:06.690]  has led to cannabis in my life.
[04:06.930 --> 04:09.290]  So has that kind of been a similar tale for you?
[04:09.290 --> 04:14.330]  It's definitely a direct correlation, because I mean, if this has been my medication,
[04:14.810 --> 04:17.610]  they've wanted to put, you know, I have anxiety and other things.
[04:17.610 --> 04:21.090]  But this is kind of what I've been treating myself with for many years.
[04:21.370 --> 04:23.850]  And anything can be taken over the therapeutic index.
[04:23.850 --> 04:25.530]  And yes, we do like to get high.
[04:25.530 --> 04:33.330]  So, you know, but we function and I probably got lost in the question, but it is
[04:33.330 --> 04:35.770]  definitely important because my mom's a celiac.
[04:36.130 --> 04:42.650]  And so I understand now more than ever how important the gut biome is and how it's
[04:42.650 --> 04:48.410]  directly related to what we're learning in the soil biology and endophytes and how
[04:48.410 --> 04:52.770]  do we get them into us if they're not on our vegetables, if they're not in the store,
[04:53.410 --> 04:54.770]  we have to grow them ourself.
[04:55.090 --> 04:59.290]  And then just all the things that are such heightened.
[04:59.530 --> 05:03.530]  I mean, I don't know if people even know that, but like my mom's a baker.
[05:03.530 --> 05:04.610]  She's a master baker.
[05:05.050 --> 05:06.730]  Everyone used to joke about that, right?
[05:06.730 --> 05:07.130]  Of course.
[05:07.690 --> 05:09.570]  My brain didn't even go there, man.
[05:09.570 --> 05:11.490]  I like donuts and cakes too much.
[05:11.810 --> 05:16.970]  For Julia Child, like she's a, you know, she was also classically French cuisine trained by
[05:16.970 --> 05:19.890]  Madeline Kamen and Women's Culinary Guild member.
[05:19.890 --> 05:25.330]  So I've, you know, but, you know, I forgot what I was saying.
[05:25.490 --> 05:28.450]  Now we're talking about how she's celiac in the biome.
[05:28.490 --> 05:29.530]  Yeah, no, that's fine.
[05:29.530 --> 05:33.650]  That's a cruel irony that she and my grandfather in Denmark was a baker because she's
[05:33.650 --> 05:39.290]  Danish and now she can't be around, you know, gluten without gloves and a mask and she can't
[05:39.290 --> 05:39.850]  even cook with it.
[05:39.850 --> 05:43.970]  So she has had to do a lot of gluten free work and she's done consultings and made
[05:43.970 --> 05:49.690]  recipes. But they put vital wheat gluten in all of this thing.
[05:49.970 --> 05:55.170]  So there's like five times more like gluten than should even exist in the wheat.
[05:55.610 --> 06:00.290]  And we really haven't been as humans eating wheat and grains.
[06:00.410 --> 06:01.330]  We haven't farmed.
[06:01.650 --> 06:04.250]  So now we're just in it's in everything.
[06:04.250 --> 06:05.930]  Toothpaste, hair, like.
[06:06.930 --> 06:11.930]  You can still get it in through cuts and stuff, but like someone who's a celiac has needs
[06:11.930 --> 06:17.570]  to be totally zero tolerance for for for the, you know, the transglutaminin.
[06:19.010 --> 06:20.130]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[06:20.130 --> 06:22.890]  Like when people walk down, you know, they're sensitive to fragrances.
[06:22.890 --> 06:28.090]  If you walk down, you know, like the dish soap or laundry soap aisle in the grocery
[06:28.090 --> 06:29.530]  stores like, oh, my gosh.
[06:29.690 --> 06:33.650]  But for celiac bread aisle can be the exact same.
[06:33.650 --> 06:37.930]  I see my wife's interaction sometimes when we're just around a whole bunch of like
[06:37.930 --> 06:39.850]  like gluten concentrated area.
[06:39.850 --> 06:41.690]  It's it's interesting.
[06:41.690 --> 06:42.570]  It's like the sport.
[06:42.570 --> 06:44.050]  Well, it could be in the air.
[06:44.050 --> 06:45.050]  It could be the spores.
[06:45.050 --> 06:47.010]  It could be like the flour or.
[06:48.970 --> 06:54.970]  But yeah, it's it's it's it is kind of interesting how prevalent all these food allergies
[06:54.970 --> 06:57.650]  are now, like we've heard of peanut allergies with children.
[06:57.650 --> 07:00.970]  I was I'm pretty old, so I'm over 50.
[07:01.970 --> 07:06.850]  So it's like it and it's just you makes you wonder why, like maybe the onset of these
[07:06.850 --> 07:09.090]  diseases don't have to happen so quickly.
[07:09.370 --> 07:14.410]  They're in our DNA and they might arise, but it's almost like they're triggered by all
[07:14.410 --> 07:20.530]  of the the preservatives and all of the chemicals and glyphosate is obviously in
[07:20.530 --> 07:23.810]  everything. Like now they finally recognize it's like, really?
[07:24.130 --> 07:27.690]  This is like, of course, we're the most diseased country in the world.
[07:27.690 --> 07:32.530]  And and and it's because everything on our shelves is really not.
[07:33.290 --> 07:37.610]  Now, you really have to be a label reader and I'm a diabetic, so I have to count carbs.
[07:38.090 --> 07:44.410]  And it's like but it's even when we go and get organic, sometimes we just really just
[07:44.410 --> 07:48.770]  need to have someone that, you know, support your local farmer, go to them, get those
[07:48.770 --> 07:55.010]  vegetables. They might not be certified, but they way more way more clean and healthy
[07:55.010 --> 07:58.210]  than the certified, you know, they just can't afford certification.
[07:58.690 --> 08:03.890]  So I know I'm going off on a rant, but I'm very passionate and about all this.
[08:03.890 --> 08:07.970]  And I understand it's like it's kind of like, why did this come later on in life?
[08:07.970 --> 08:12.890]  I was very much a naturalist and love nature and a Boy Scout Eagle Scout when camping
[08:12.890 --> 08:15.050]  outbound, did all these other stuff.
[08:15.050 --> 08:17.330]  Camp Challenge is kind of like an hour about thing.
[08:17.490 --> 08:18.570]  So I love nature.
[08:18.770 --> 08:24.210]  But now it's like, wow, we just kids don't even know what coriander is.
[08:24.210 --> 08:27.050]  They're like, oh, oh, that's cilantro.
[08:27.050 --> 08:28.050]  No, it's coriander.
[08:28.050 --> 08:32.530]  When it's like now they put on the bunch like, no, it's it's it's cilantro when it's in
[08:32.530 --> 08:36.370]  the bunch. It's coriander when it's when it's the flower corn, you know, like the
[08:36.370 --> 08:37.570]  peppercorn of the flower.
[08:38.090 --> 08:43.290]  The the the the the small details of it, which is something that I know that you
[08:43.290 --> 08:46.170]  definitely nail drive down into.
[08:46.170 --> 08:49.810]  And I think actually, you know, that's a big part of your success.
[08:49.810 --> 08:51.810]  Where does cilantro come from? Comes from the supermarket.
[08:51.810 --> 08:52.650]  Like, you know.
[08:53.010 --> 08:56.330]  Right. I know that's like hunting.
[08:56.330 --> 08:57.850]  I like the contract killers, man.
[08:57.850 --> 08:59.850]  No questions asked. Just put it on my plate.
[09:00.210 --> 09:02.330]  But no problems with the hunters.
[09:02.890 --> 09:08.410]  And I guess I'm just going to throw the like the like conflict grenade out here.
[09:09.450 --> 09:10.770]  Going back to.
[09:10.850 --> 09:12.370]  OK, so you mentioned glyphosate.
[09:12.410 --> 09:16.570]  There was a recent study. It says 80 percent of people have glyphosate in their urine
[09:16.570 --> 09:18.810]  in the US. This is absolutely true.
[09:18.970 --> 09:22.370]  People there was less than 2000 people tested.
[09:22.410 --> 09:23.650]  Now, that percentage is high.
[09:23.650 --> 09:26.610]  And I'm sure if they tested two million, it would probably stay the same.
[09:26.610 --> 09:31.850]  And that's good. But with studies and particularly with percentages, check the size
[09:31.850 --> 09:35.650]  of the group before you go out and start saying, oh, my God.
[09:35.890 --> 09:39.130]  But it is one of those, oh, my goodness things, because it shouldn't even be there.
[09:39.130 --> 09:40.370]  It doesn't need to be there.
[09:40.450 --> 09:45.970]  And that's one of the challenges that we see from agri regular agriculture to
[09:45.970 --> 09:49.330]  cannabis. It's hard to do things on scale.
[09:49.450 --> 09:57.010]  It's hard to do things to preserve them or store them to make it get from the field to
[09:57.010 --> 10:02.250]  the warehouse, to the distributor, to the other warehouse, to finally the shelf.
[10:03.810 --> 10:10.810]  We kind of I think we would both recommend a more direct approach by going directly to
[10:10.810 --> 10:12.570]  the farm. You cut all these things out.
[10:12.570 --> 10:14.090]  You're dealing with somebody smaller.
[10:14.330 --> 10:18.730]  But that is an odd challenge that we have to face with mass scale production of
[10:18.730 --> 10:24.610]  anything. Do you think we can maybe get away with small scale cannabis production
[10:24.850 --> 10:29.410]  successfully? I think craft is where it's going to.
[10:30.610 --> 10:32.410]  That's where people are going to appreciate.
[10:32.770 --> 10:39.250]  But that's only once the consumer as well as well as everybody gets educated about
[10:39.250 --> 10:46.210]  what really why it should demand a higher price point and why it's hard for all these
[10:46.210 --> 10:51.170]  struggling farmers to feed their families when they're putting out stuff that's at a
[10:51.170 --> 10:55.770]  much higher quality and the price is like, I don't know if I read into that question
[10:55.770 --> 11:01.970]  wrong, but it's like I don't you know, I I just I admire all these people that are doing
[11:01.970 --> 11:07.610]  it. You know, I don't even know if I have the strength to do that because it's it's it's
[11:07.610 --> 11:09.410]  hard, but I admire it.
[11:09.410 --> 11:15.890]  And and later on in life, I I'm trying to take those steps to try and like whether it's
[11:15.930 --> 11:17.130]  like because I grow inside.
[11:17.130 --> 11:18.450]  So now it's like I want to get out.
[11:18.450 --> 11:19.890]  I want to grow. I want to use the sun.
[11:19.890 --> 11:23.930]  There's so many more phyto cannabinoids the sun can impart in that medicine.
[11:23.930 --> 11:26.250]  It's not the same without the sun.
[11:26.250 --> 11:28.970]  I really believe that. And I've been growing indoors pretty much.
[11:28.970 --> 11:30.050]  I mean, I do grow outdoors.
[11:30.050 --> 11:34.970]  It's just so hard here in the east with all the caterpillars and PM and the season.
[11:34.970 --> 11:38.170]  And. That's where I'm at.
[11:38.170 --> 11:42.930]  Some people here don't even grow in the in the summertime indoors because of PM and
[11:42.930 --> 11:47.130]  wherever they are or just air conditioning and whatever.
[11:47.130 --> 11:52.730]  Yeah. I know people in hotter climates that don't they don't grow in the summer.
[11:53.450 --> 11:56.010]  So, I mean, I guess we've had to feed the world.
[11:56.010 --> 11:59.330]  So all that bomb making material got turned into fertilizer.
[11:59.770 --> 12:06.490]  But we should have learned from the Dust Bowl that we're headed for that same or, you
[12:06.490 --> 12:07.690]  know, I don't know. It's kind of.
[12:08.290 --> 12:13.810]  And I don't want to, you know, but it's made me aware it's made me more aware and more
[12:13.810 --> 12:17.850]  like more cognizant of like, wait, OK, I wait.
[12:17.850 --> 12:22.410]  I am going to take that extra minute to do that because it is going to benefit in the
[12:22.410 --> 12:24.570]  future. And everybody that says, oh, it's just that.
[12:24.570 --> 12:26.730]  And then it all adds up.
[12:26.730 --> 12:33.170]  And if you know, and I'm not trying to sound, you know, it's just I I want to live and
[12:33.170 --> 12:39.330]  kind of make up for my the like Brandon Russ coined that term.
[12:42.490 --> 12:50.810]  What does he say? Biological debt that we're born into and and it totally resonated with
[12:50.810 --> 12:55.490]  me. It's like, yeah, of course, like all the decisions that we make can help the future,
[12:56.130 --> 12:59.610]  whether some people might not want to or not or don't care.
[13:00.010 --> 13:05.930]  But like we've already need to make up for our other ancestors, bad mistakes or, you
[13:05.930 --> 13:08.450]  know, it's kind of like let's try to leave the play.
[13:08.490 --> 13:10.890]  Let's try to leave it a little bit better than we found it.
[13:10.890 --> 13:15.210]  You know, maybe that's some weird foreign idea probably came from aliens.
[13:15.890 --> 13:18.130]  But no, we got to leave it better than we found it.
[13:18.130 --> 13:19.770]  And you mentioned the Dust Bowl.
[13:19.930 --> 13:25.210]  And here's just, you know, for anybody who doesn't know what the Dust Bowl is or remember
[13:25.210 --> 13:27.570]  the Dust Bowl or the causes, go look it up.
[13:27.610 --> 13:30.930]  It's a long time ago in history, but it could easily be repeated.
[13:31.090 --> 13:34.250]  And in the example that comes to mind, you know, you said the Dust Bowl.
[13:34.690 --> 13:39.450]  One of the problems there is, you know, the winds they drew, they blew off that top
[13:39.450 --> 13:42.090]  fertile layer of soil where all the minerals are.
[13:42.650 --> 13:46.450]  Organic practices, cover crops is so simple.
[13:46.450 --> 13:51.970]  You know, I see a lot more fields in Washington now with a cover crop instead of just
[13:51.970 --> 13:57.090]  fallow, because, again, when you have just a bare dirt field, you lose it from erosion,
[13:57.090 --> 14:01.250]  from the raindrops driving down and landing that's eroding your good top soil.
[14:01.290 --> 14:02.850]  Your wind is blowing it away.
[14:02.930 --> 14:04.050]  There's nothing to hold it.
[14:04.410 --> 14:08.610]  But those cover crops, which can then be, you know, chopped and dropped and turned into
[14:08.610 --> 14:14.970]  actual nutrients for that soil, that's such a little thing that goes a long way.
[14:15.210 --> 14:16.770]  So they all add up.
[14:16.770 --> 14:21.970]  And I know organic practices was how you kind of preferred to get or your approach.
[14:22.490 --> 14:26.450]  Were you gardening with organic practices before cannabis or how did that?
[14:26.450 --> 14:28.970]  No, I wasn't even gardening before cannabis.
[14:28.970 --> 14:33.930]  That's that was what got me to garden because like I was a caretaker for my father who
[14:33.930 --> 14:38.610]  had many illnesses and his surgeries and ileostomy, colostomy, all these different
[14:38.610 --> 14:40.530]  things that I had to take care of.
[14:41.530 --> 14:42.770]  So I was growing.
[14:42.770 --> 14:49.650]  But then when he passed away, I stopped growing because, you know, I needed to be
[14:49.650 --> 14:51.210]  out. Everything was in my name.
[14:51.210 --> 14:53.050]  So I was like, I'm not going to take any chances.
[14:53.050 --> 14:56.970]  And then the climate changed here in Massachusetts and the laws changed.
[14:56.970 --> 15:05.410]  And and, you know, but in between that time, that love for growing was really then I'd
[15:05.410 --> 15:07.930]  started growing. I wish I could show you out my garden.
[15:08.410 --> 15:11.850]  It's all sub irrigated planters and it's all polyculture.
[15:11.850 --> 15:16.490]  I don't even there's no room for the cover crop is everything that's out there.
[15:17.490 --> 15:23.770]  But that love, you know, I was it's just like I think even Ed Rosenthal said, you'll
[15:24.050 --> 15:28.210]  you'll never stop wanting to like even if you have to stop growing because of wherever
[15:28.210 --> 15:32.330]  you're living or doing or for whatever reason, you still want to.
[15:32.570 --> 15:35.730]  And I kind of took that passion and that outside.
[15:35.730 --> 15:40.410]  And I started growing all these heirloom tomatoes, the mortgage lifter, the White
[15:40.410 --> 15:41.330]  Shoals, Dr.
[15:42.010 --> 15:45.930]  White Shoals, yellow, orange, all these different awesome things.
[15:45.930 --> 15:47.290]  And all the herbs.
[15:47.290 --> 15:51.330]  So now if I go outside, I just go grab a handful of stuff and cook with, you know what
[15:51.330 --> 15:53.810]  I mean? And then I have root nine going like right by my house.
[15:53.810 --> 15:57.370]  It's not like but the plethora of life that's out here, too.
[15:57.570 --> 15:59.370]  I got like seven different type of birds.
[15:59.370 --> 16:03.290]  I got rabbits. I got chipmunks that I actually hand feed right now.
[16:03.290 --> 16:04.570]  I got I'm coming up to the window.
[16:04.570 --> 16:07.050]  I sit here and have my coffee in the morning right out this window.
[16:07.450 --> 16:11.570]  And it's just amazing because when you look at all the stuff and all the flowers and the
[16:11.970 --> 16:16.650]  scarlet honeysuckles and all the native plants that I bought and put in here, I have
[16:16.650 --> 16:19.810]  hunting hummingbirds come to my honeysuckle, my scarlet honeysuckle.
[16:20.410 --> 16:24.450]  It's you can bring life into this is what.
[16:24.450 --> 16:28.250]  And so I've seen it just on this little microcosm of like what I want to do.
[16:28.330 --> 16:32.410]  And it doesn't like you were saying, it doesn't take much land to really even do that,
[16:32.410 --> 16:35.570]  to be subsistent and and to other help other people.
[16:35.570 --> 16:41.290]  And, you know, and, you know, so, yeah, it's really put
[16:41.290 --> 16:46.410]  into motion that all this like and then the more you want to learn, it's oh, my God.
[16:46.410 --> 16:48.370]  Oh, what the rise of cycle.
[16:48.370 --> 16:51.770]  What? Oh, my God. They suck them in and they and they spit them back.
[16:51.810 --> 16:53.250]  Oh, my God. Like what's going on?
[16:53.250 --> 16:58.370]  This is great. Yeah. And then I saw it like when you see it, it's like, how can we not
[16:58.370 --> 17:00.570]  like just be at all at.
[17:00.850 --> 17:06.690]  Yeah. At nature and what happens under our feet, the silent majority that basically
[17:07.290 --> 17:08.450]  we are humus beings.
[17:08.450 --> 17:13.090]  And I know Jesse from Bios Vortex said that a long time ago, and I've kind of taken that to
[17:13.090 --> 17:17.730]  heart. But, you know, and it goes right back to our gut biome, you know, right there.
[17:18.330 --> 17:21.210]  Right. And there that's the full 360.
[17:21.210 --> 17:24.410]  You know, it's all it's amazing how interconnected it is.
[17:24.650 --> 17:31.370]  And that's rad that you were able to build a biodiverse area in such a short
[17:31.370 --> 17:36.330]  time and have the tangible results about seeing these animals, seeing these birds.
[17:36.490 --> 17:40.730]  One thing we like to do in our yard is we like to plant a lot of pollinator plants to
[17:40.730 --> 17:44.170]  attract the bees and to help the bees and sure as shit, they show up.
[17:44.170 --> 17:45.490]  So it's cool.
[17:45.490 --> 17:49.770]  I took a quarter pound of Kiss Organics pollinator mix.
[17:49.810 --> 17:51.050]  I bought a quarter pound of it.
[17:51.090 --> 17:56.090]  I still have more of it, but that's what I put instead of I used to use enriching mulch
[17:56.090 --> 17:59.330]  around the borders. And that's kind of broken down over the years.
[17:59.330 --> 18:03.490]  I've actually had black leaf mold brought in one time to do that.
[18:03.490 --> 18:06.170]  And it smelled like crazy. But then two days later, it was awesome.
[18:06.330 --> 18:09.890]  So I put those down and now it's just everything everywhere.
[18:10.130 --> 18:14.770]  And then all my arugula seeds, all my muskling mix and all my mustard.
[18:14.770 --> 18:17.210]  And oh, my God, I mean, we must have pollinated the neighborhood.
[18:17.210 --> 18:19.130]  I can look over fences and it's everywhere.
[18:19.770 --> 18:20.890]  That's good, though, man.
[18:21.090 --> 18:26.250]  We've actually this year kind of have taken it on to do a lot more seed bombs.
[18:26.890 --> 18:29.050]  And we live near a park and stuff.
[18:29.050 --> 18:32.410]  And we're just planting flowers everywhere, man.
[18:32.410 --> 18:33.650]  We're just like, fuck it.
[18:33.650 --> 18:35.730]  We're overgrowing slowly.
[18:35.730 --> 18:37.370]  Hopefully the bees are coming back.
[18:37.370 --> 18:38.250]  Right. I mean.
[18:38.970 --> 18:40.690]  Yeah, they're good.
[18:40.690 --> 18:44.610]  You know, it's well, I can't say it's a healthy population because I don't really know.
[18:44.730 --> 18:47.330]  But there tends to be a lot of them down here.
[18:47.570 --> 18:52.850]  And, you know, real quick, Ken's tagline, it's all about the biology.
[18:53.330 --> 18:54.810]  We got to throw that one in there.
[18:54.810 --> 18:59.090]  Yes. Josh says fertility through biology.
[18:59.090 --> 19:01.370]  Right. Oh, yeah.
[19:01.410 --> 19:02.610]  Even there you go, Ken.
[19:02.610 --> 19:03.810]  That's the next shirt right there.
[19:03.810 --> 19:06.330]  You got to call Josh. But that's that's the next shirt.
[19:06.450 --> 19:09.010]  And I wanted to show you out too, man.
[19:09.410 --> 19:11.970]  You're getting you're getting some shout out.
[19:11.970 --> 19:13.330]  I got to get him credit for this.
[19:13.330 --> 19:18.650]  But my buddy, Chef Alex, made me this four time award winning chef.
[19:18.690 --> 19:20.210]  On post. Yeah.
[19:20.210 --> 19:22.970]  Yeah. We hung out with them at the region conference.
[19:22.970 --> 19:26.010]  And oh, man, those guys, all those guys.
[19:26.410 --> 19:28.610]  That's family. That's family.
[19:28.610 --> 19:31.210]  Definitely for life.
[19:31.210 --> 19:32.450]  I love this cheddar, Bob.
[19:32.450 --> 19:33.570]  This guy is a one.
[19:33.570 --> 19:34.970]  He filled my jar with flour.
[19:34.970 --> 19:36.930]  Basically, the first hour.
[19:36.930 --> 19:38.450]  I haven't been able to hang out with him, bro.
[19:38.450 --> 19:39.730]  He's fucking cool, dude.
[19:39.730 --> 19:40.810]  That's so cool.
[19:40.810 --> 19:42.770]  We need to sit down and squish.
[19:42.770 --> 19:45.210]  We need a squish. And and, you know.
[19:47.130 --> 19:50.330]  Yes, he's he's got his own
[19:50.330 --> 19:53.490]  a squish, because I'm so technical with the term.
[19:53.490 --> 19:55.690]  He's got his own squisher.
[19:55.690 --> 19:56.970]  Yeah. Yeah. Nug smasher.
[19:56.970 --> 19:59.290]  I I started off on a smaller machine, too.
[19:59.650 --> 20:01.610]  And that one there he does is awesome.
[20:01.610 --> 20:03.530]  He does the double pack side by side like
[20:04.890 --> 20:06.130]  Chottel Tech or whatever.
[20:06.130 --> 20:08.210]  Boom. Awesome.
[20:08.690 --> 20:11.770]  And then, you know, he's a bunch of people here.
[20:11.770 --> 20:12.610]  It's like, yes.
[20:12.610 --> 20:14.810]  So happy to see you up here and get your time.
[20:14.970 --> 20:18.930]  You mentioned the region conference, though, is that, you know, region
[20:18.930 --> 20:20.250]  conferences you've been to?
[20:20.250 --> 20:22.330]  What one to a couple of those things?
[20:22.330 --> 20:27.330]  I've I've been to the the one COVID shut down that one that I wanted to go to.
[20:27.810 --> 20:30.810]  And I guess California still still went through.
[20:30.810 --> 20:36.130]  But then the main one got, you know, nixed for because rightly so.
[20:36.490 --> 20:38.410]  But then it comes around again.
[20:38.410 --> 20:46.130]  But prior to that, Wendy Kronberg and James Brower and and pretty much
[20:46.130 --> 20:50.250]  some of the crew from the original region had organic cultivators,
[20:50.250 --> 20:52.290]  which I attended, which was really great.
[20:52.290 --> 20:54.370]  So Donald Trump, you know,
[20:55.530 --> 20:57.610]  Susan, wait, was it Evans?
[20:57.610 --> 20:58.370]  I don't know. Wait, Chris.
[20:58.410 --> 20:59.170]  Trump, right?
[20:59.170 --> 21:00.450]  Chris, Chris.
[21:00.450 --> 21:02.650]  I was like, holy shit, bro.
[21:02.650 --> 21:03.370]  He showed up.
[21:03.370 --> 21:06.570]  Was he was he like smoking the the gold plated blunts?
[21:06.610 --> 21:07.170]  No, no.
[21:07.170 --> 21:07.730]  OK, Chris.
[21:07.730 --> 21:08.010]  Trump.
[21:08.010 --> 21:08.810]  Chris Trump.
[21:08.810 --> 21:10.570]  Right. Why did I say that?
[21:10.570 --> 21:12.930]  Geez. Yeah. Right.
[21:12.930 --> 21:14.810]  Anyway, Freudian.
[21:14.810 --> 21:15.570]  Chris Trump.
[21:15.570 --> 21:21.250]  But he does talk about he jokes about the master gen or child talking to her.
[21:21.730 --> 21:23.290]  Man, I'm probably saying the wrong things.
[21:23.290 --> 21:31.050]  But I actually am hoping just to do this October out in the Cape.
[21:31.050 --> 21:33.650]  He's doing that five day intensive course.
[21:34.770 --> 21:37.490]  And it looks like what he said to the region.
[21:37.490 --> 21:39.850]  Was that the one that got canceled?
[21:39.850 --> 21:41.850]  The main one that you went to the main.
[21:41.850 --> 21:44.130]  I went to that after that, too.
[21:44.130 --> 21:46.530]  And Chris Trump was there as well.
[21:46.730 --> 21:48.650]  I said it the right this time.
[21:48.650 --> 21:52.770]  Cool. And I got to meet Kevin Jodry and Joshua Steensland.
[21:52.770 --> 21:57.770]  Dutch blooms, which was funny because we all wear the orange hat.
[21:57.770 --> 22:01.770]  Right. I actually had my girlfriend make me an orange hat and
[22:03.010 --> 22:04.330]  said, get the seeds.
[22:04.330 --> 22:07.050]  And then I'm like, oh, you know, and I've been following him for a long time
[22:07.050 --> 22:10.330]  because I mean, Kevin Jodry, I've been like following him.
[22:10.330 --> 22:11.690]  Like he's the master.
[22:11.690 --> 22:15.370]  He's like the mentor has really his videos.
[22:15.370 --> 22:19.490]  And and the meet the breeders is kind of where I really had an idea
[22:19.490 --> 22:20.650]  of who these people were.
[22:20.650 --> 22:24.090]  And, you know, and it just kind of it was great for him to do that,
[22:24.410 --> 22:26.050]  to give them that exposure.
[22:26.050 --> 22:30.090]  And and it's just like, you know, so it was kind of a dream to meet all these people.
[22:30.090 --> 22:33.890]  It was kind of like I was starstruck, but it was like, hey, here's my jar.
[22:33.890 --> 22:35.250]  Please, no, please take some.
[22:35.250 --> 22:38.090]  No, you know, like take my buds, please.
[22:38.170 --> 22:39.770]  I want you to have it.
[22:39.770 --> 22:41.650]  That's a little nerve wracking, too, though.
[22:41.650 --> 22:44.570]  You know, when you step up or you meet some of those guys, it's kind of like
[22:44.570 --> 22:49.690]  I know you smoked some of the best weed in the world, but here's my offering.
[22:51.570 --> 22:57.730]  So I showed up with that orange hat and and I was like, oh, and and so for real,
[22:58.210 --> 23:00.530]  I said to him, oh, you know, my mom's Danish.
[23:00.530 --> 23:04.170]  I didn't know you were you were you're you're Dutch because I figured the orange hat.
[23:04.170 --> 23:05.850]  Right. The Dutch hat. You know, OK.
[23:05.850 --> 23:07.130]  Yeah. You love Amsterdam.
[23:07.130 --> 23:10.850]  So like, yes, I'm orange is the color that he's got over there.
[23:10.850 --> 23:14.690]  And and obviously Dutch was like the mecca for for cannabis.
[23:14.690 --> 23:17.530]  And and and so I'm like, oh, that's cool.
[23:17.530 --> 23:18.650]  You're Dutch. You get that.
[23:18.650 --> 23:21.490]  And he's like, you need to even think about it was more of like a hunter hat,
[23:21.490 --> 23:23.410]  you know, like the fluorescent orange.
[23:23.410 --> 23:24.050]  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[23:24.050 --> 23:27.570]  So I'm like, oh, but for sure I'm like laughing my ass off.
[23:27.570 --> 23:31.170]  Like, I for sure thought that that you were Dutch
[23:31.610 --> 23:34.250]  and we got the orange hat and it all made sense.
[23:34.930 --> 23:37.610]  And he was standing there drinking his Dutch brothers coffee,
[23:38.210 --> 23:41.850]  you know, eating pickled herring like what's going on here?
[23:41.890 --> 23:43.090]  No, but he did have crocs on.
[23:43.090 --> 23:44.730]  They kind of resemble clogs a little bit.
[23:44.730 --> 23:47.330]  So, you know, they do.
[23:48.290 --> 23:50.450]  I could easily see that happening.
[23:50.450 --> 23:53.850]  But that must have been fun because, you know, it was everything
[23:54.170 --> 23:56.090]  you get to hear from those people.
[23:56.090 --> 24:00.730]  But I know from talking to you, you have great questions.
[24:00.730 --> 24:03.570]  And so was getting some of your questions answered
[24:04.250 --> 24:08.170]  something that maybe moved you forward as a benefit of attending these conferences?
[24:09.170 --> 24:11.090]  Yes. And it was.
[24:11.290 --> 24:13.010]  Yeah, I mean.
[24:13.570 --> 24:16.530]  There's so many nuggets that like even if you listen to it,
[24:16.890 --> 24:20.970]  like I listen to all these podcasts sometimes twice just to
[24:21.650 --> 24:25.530]  to to ingrain it in my memory, because I learn in a different way.
[24:26.010 --> 24:27.690]  Yeah, I'm not good at taking notes.
[24:27.690 --> 24:29.170]  I'm more of a visual person.
[24:29.170 --> 24:31.610]  So I'm like I like to watch and I like to listen.
[24:31.610 --> 24:33.370]  And if I. Yeah.
[24:33.370 --> 24:37.210]  But yeah, I mean, it was just it was kind of
[24:38.210 --> 24:39.970]  definitely got lots of Kevin.
[24:39.970 --> 24:41.490]  I got to chop it up with Kevin a lot.
[24:41.490 --> 24:43.250]  And he was very generous at this time.
[24:43.250 --> 24:45.090]  And and even Joshua Steensland.
[24:45.090 --> 24:48.050]  And I just I felt like I didn't want to be like the wedding
[24:48.050 --> 24:50.890]  crasher or the the cling of the stage for a clinger or whatever.
[24:52.090 --> 24:54.850]  But I was like, please tell me if I'm bothering you.
[24:54.850 --> 24:58.810]  But I'm just like, you know, just so it was it was a dream.
[24:58.810 --> 24:59.970]  It was awesome to do that.
[24:59.970 --> 25:04.010]  And and it made it so much more awesome because we had to wait a whole year
[25:04.010 --> 25:08.050]  in between. And, you know, but in between that,
[25:08.290 --> 25:11.810]  I did attend the Cannabinoid Cultivation Academy
[25:12.210 --> 25:14.370]  with Brian Washman and and
[25:17.130 --> 25:18.490]  Leighton Morrison.
[25:18.490 --> 25:22.530]  And and and so I got to actually that was the first time
[25:22.810 --> 25:27.170]  that I actually got to ask those people questions because they had Elaine Ingham
[25:27.170 --> 25:30.450]  and and Kevin Jodria speakers and Dr.
[25:30.450 --> 25:32.170]  White, Clark or
[25:33.250 --> 25:38.050]  many, many people and and and even people I didn't even know, like Craig Chester.
[25:38.050 --> 25:40.610]  And they're mycologists.
[25:40.610 --> 25:42.890]  They're unbelievable, phenomenal knowledge.
[25:43.290 --> 25:45.930]  And, you know, it just made me want to learn more.
[25:45.930 --> 25:49.490]  Like every time I listen to people that are that are specialized in their field
[25:49.490 --> 25:51.810]  and it's just so many things to know.
[25:51.810 --> 25:56.610]  That's why this is like a lifelong pursuit to, you know, like
[25:57.530 --> 26:00.690]  I've I've got awards for cabinet and furniture making.
[26:00.890 --> 26:04.690]  I went to North Bennett Street School and that's a whole nother craft.
[26:04.690 --> 26:06.770]  Like any craft is a lifelong pursuit.
[26:06.770 --> 26:10.090]  You can't just you and you have to be always learning
[26:10.210 --> 26:12.690]  because then you stagnate.
[26:12.690 --> 26:17.610]  And it's no there's no loss for things to learn.
[26:17.610 --> 26:20.250]  So it's like you're going to be busy, busy, busy.
[26:20.650 --> 26:24.530]  And and, you know, I just feel like now I'm starting to get good at this.
[26:24.530 --> 26:25.570]  Like, you know what I mean?
[26:25.570 --> 26:28.210]  And I've been doing this since probably 1998.
[26:28.770 --> 26:32.050]  You know, I just didn't ever really I mean, we had a small little place
[26:32.050 --> 26:35.890]  where we used to like have the community farm.
[26:35.890 --> 26:39.930]  And I remember I hated the Brussels sprouts that my mom would make and stuff.
[26:39.930 --> 26:41.450]  But I didn't really.
[26:41.450 --> 26:44.810]  And my grandmother would like be growing tomatoes and beefsteaks.
[26:44.810 --> 26:46.770]  She loved beefsteaks and she did have a garden.
[26:46.770 --> 26:49.690]  But it's like I never really was drawn to that.
[26:49.730 --> 26:52.210]  And it's kind of strange how later on in life
[26:52.850 --> 26:56.370]  and I really have to attribute it to this plant as the gateway.
[26:57.090 --> 26:59.850]  Yeah, it is. It's a gateway drug to gardening.
[27:00.090 --> 27:01.530]  It was for me.
[27:01.530 --> 27:04.050]  I mean, I killed a cactus before I learned how to grow.
[27:04.410 --> 27:06.690]  So it took me a year or two, but I did.
[27:06.690 --> 27:07.490]  I killed a cactus.
[27:07.490 --> 27:10.130]  So, yeah, now I'm interested in all kinds of things.
[27:10.330 --> 27:12.170]  I'm interested in the soil.
[27:12.170 --> 27:14.490]  I'm interested in how that works.
[27:14.490 --> 27:16.330]  You kind of mentioned Brandon Russ earlier.
[27:16.330 --> 27:19.810]  I can't remember if this is before we were live or after we were live.
[27:20.730 --> 27:24.970]  But yeah, I love his analytical, methodical approach to things.
[27:24.970 --> 27:28.690]  Very, you know, there's experimentation in there,
[27:28.690 --> 27:30.730]  but there's a rigid set of guidelines.
[27:30.730 --> 27:32.770]  So it's not just shooting in the dark.
[27:33.450 --> 27:37.170]  I love that approach because things are going to be always different.
[27:37.170 --> 27:39.330]  If you're not testing, you're just guessing.
[27:39.330 --> 27:44.530]  And I mean, I want to get to that level where I have to worry about
[27:44.610 --> 27:46.890]  like I don't have that many plants to worry about that.
[27:47.770 --> 27:51.490]  I mean, I have here and there, but not like, you know, it's not.
[27:52.850 --> 27:56.570]  But I aspire to be like maybe do a light depth type of thing, too,
[27:56.610 --> 27:58.770]  where it's the sun, you know.
[27:59.610 --> 28:01.130]  But yeah, he's killing it.
[28:01.130 --> 28:03.690]  I have mad respect.
[28:03.690 --> 28:05.330]  I talked to him briefly on the phone.
[28:05.330 --> 28:06.930]  I got some of his gear.
[28:06.930 --> 28:08.970]  I haven't been posting stuff. I've been so busy.
[28:09.370 --> 28:13.810]  But like I just popped some of his Malawi dog and hid that shit is fire.
[28:13.810 --> 28:16.850]  And it was after like home to home.
[28:17.290 --> 28:22.250]  What was the uptown grow labs posted this beautiful like blue purple photo.
[28:22.250 --> 28:25.690]  And I was just like, oh, OK, I go into the box and I pop them.
[28:26.010 --> 28:28.570]  And I did find that, you know,
[28:28.730 --> 28:30.770]  it was it was beautiful.
[28:31.370 --> 28:33.890]  I still have it in the jars.
[28:33.890 --> 28:36.850]  I need to post up for him because he's put in the work
[28:36.850 --> 28:41.610]  and and I definitely appreciate him.
[28:41.610 --> 28:46.730]  And it's nice to give the breeders that feedback just because, again,
[28:46.770 --> 28:50.330]  you know, they can't possibly pop all of them in all of the conditions
[28:50.330 --> 28:51.730]  that exist out there.
[28:51.730 --> 28:55.170]  So, yeah, getting that feedback to breeders or people, you know,
[28:55.170 --> 28:58.050]  if they gave you seeds, that's just that's a really nice gesture.
[28:58.050 --> 29:00.530]  You know, that's almost. Oh, yeah.
[29:00.530 --> 29:03.810]  Even if you enter a contest, you have to give homage to who
[29:03.810 --> 29:05.610]  who who did that, put the work in.
[29:05.610 --> 29:06.410]  You know what I mean?
[29:06.410 --> 29:10.130]  Like someone put the work in and someone else put the work in before them.
[29:10.130 --> 29:13.610]  So, you know, you want to make sure that you're still
[29:14.170 --> 29:17.690]  given the props and flowers where they're due, you know?
[29:20.330 --> 29:22.250]  Yeah, definitely give give them where they're due.
[29:22.250 --> 29:23.610]  It's important. It's important.
[29:23.610 --> 29:27.370]  Once we start losing what we're I'm going to go off on another tangent.
[29:27.370 --> 29:32.050]  But once we stop like knowing what it is and we have to rely on like
[29:32.210 --> 29:36.610]  analytical testing to figure out what that name is and is it was it and what?
[29:36.610 --> 29:38.850]  You know, it's it's harder.
[29:38.850 --> 29:39.890]  It's harder to try.
[29:39.890 --> 29:42.370]  We all fight to figure out, is that the real one?
[29:42.610 --> 29:46.770]  And it's like, how do we know if we keep changing names and or this and that?
[29:46.770 --> 29:51.010]  And, you know, we try to keep our records as as as good as possible.
[29:51.010 --> 29:52.770]  But I mean, it's not. Yeah.
[29:54.730 --> 29:56.810]  Yeah. And I don't think we honestly know anymore
[29:56.810 --> 29:59.490]  with the proliferation of home growing and home breeding,
[29:59.490 --> 30:03.090]  because there is a lot of seed companies out there that will say it's a blueberry
[30:03.170 --> 30:04.610]  when it's not a blueberry.
[30:04.610 --> 30:06.810]  But I get it. I grow it.
[30:07.650 --> 30:09.290]  OK, suggestive thinking.
[30:09.290 --> 30:10.650]  There's a little blueberry there.
[30:10.650 --> 30:14.290]  I give it to my friend as a blueberry, and I'm 100 percent convinced
[30:14.290 --> 30:18.050]  and genuine that this is blueberry that has happened so many times.
[30:18.050 --> 30:22.290]  I mean, really, since the legal system, really, since it became something
[30:22.290 --> 30:25.730]  that were name makes that big of a difference, it's been a problem.
[30:25.730 --> 30:29.050]  So I think ultimately, the genomic testing is going to answer
[30:29.050 --> 30:31.010]  a lot of these questions.
[30:31.010 --> 30:33.450]  How far down the road that is, I don't know.
[30:33.450 --> 30:37.650]  But that's, in my opinion, the only way we're going to get to the bottom of any of this.
[30:38.090 --> 30:38.930]  But it is fun.
[30:38.930 --> 30:41.170]  Said if it's fire, it's still fire, right?
[30:41.650 --> 30:43.130]  Thank you. Exactly.
[30:43.130 --> 30:45.130]  It's like, you know, the things at the end of the day,
[30:45.130 --> 30:47.770]  I was having this exact conversation the other day.
[30:47.770 --> 30:50.010]  I just like to know the real name, but it's still. Yeah. Right.
[30:50.530 --> 30:52.250]  Yeah. And I said, you know, at the end of the day,
[30:52.250 --> 30:56.170]  the most important things are the effects, you know, the taste, the smell
[30:56.170 --> 30:57.250]  and then the appearance.
[30:57.250 --> 31:01.010]  But the effects should be for an educated person or someone using it.
[31:01.010 --> 31:02.890]  Medicily effects is the number one thing.
[31:02.890 --> 31:07.730]  Name is secondary, but different market, different tangent there.
[31:08.770 --> 31:09.850]  But what are you growing?
[31:09.850 --> 31:12.250]  That other tangent goes on to to to.
[31:12.250 --> 31:15.610]  Yeah, I've been growing this for about eight years, this eight one eight headband
[31:15.610 --> 31:18.010]  from Cali Sea Connection, Swerve's gear.
[31:18.490 --> 31:20.370]  And I sat on it for a while.
[31:20.370 --> 31:23.570]  And I have these two phenos that are really my medicine.
[31:24.050 --> 31:26.850]  And they were the first time I ever had anything tested
[31:26.850 --> 31:28.970]  entering like the Harvest Cup in Worcester.
[31:29.410 --> 31:33.730]  And and they came back like twenty eight, twenty nine total active cannabinoids.
[31:33.730 --> 31:35.410]  And I knew I was doing it right.
[31:35.410 --> 31:39.090]  I wasn't using tad soil then, but I was kind of using my own mix
[31:39.090 --> 31:42.370]  and other blends and all kinds of brass.
[31:42.370 --> 31:47.690]  And I was using biochar probably too much, not at five to 10 percent.
[31:47.690 --> 31:49.850]  I was probably using more heavy handed things.
[31:50.290 --> 31:53.450]  And, you know, but you know, it's like there's a learning curve.
[31:54.050 --> 31:59.130]  But the reason that I think that that is so good is because it has about
[31:59.810 --> 32:04.650]  eight or nine different constituents when it comes to its cannabinoids.
[32:04.650 --> 32:07.330]  It's like it's a really good synergy.
[32:07.330 --> 32:10.050]  There's you know, it has a little THC, VA.
[32:10.370 --> 32:11.410]  It has a little bit.
[32:11.410 --> 32:15.730]  Well, and it's an interesting I had two different when I first entered,
[32:15.730 --> 32:20.450]  I entered two of the same the same cut from two different runs three months apart.
[32:21.290 --> 32:25.570]  It was a direct correlation from the THC converting to CBN
[32:25.690 --> 32:28.650]  and it showed in the pie chart and it made me feel good because I was like, oh,
[32:29.130 --> 32:31.010]  that's the same thing from run to run.
[32:31.010 --> 32:32.850]  That's consistency. That's awesome.
[32:32.850 --> 32:36.010]  And I could see that that was a direct percentage of what it was.
[32:36.890 --> 32:38.890]  They converted to CBN.
[32:38.890 --> 32:40.690]  Like, why is this one less THC?
[32:40.690 --> 32:42.730]  Oh, because this one's got more CBN.
[32:42.730 --> 32:45.770]  And that's the one that's three months older.
[32:47.290 --> 32:50.290]  So I got out on the data.
[32:51.250 --> 32:55.770]  Yeah, no. And and then like I was running that Hollyweed
[32:55.770 --> 32:59.650]  because Kevin Jodery, he you know, that was that is.
[32:59.890 --> 33:01.930]  And I don't even know if I have the best vino.
[33:02.530 --> 33:03.570]  I have a whole nother pack.
[33:03.570 --> 33:05.170]  So I need to find out.
[33:05.170 --> 33:09.650]  But it's a wonderful hash plant and Bodie, Bodie, Bodie,
[33:11.970 --> 33:14.050]  not Greenbody, but Bodie.
[33:14.050 --> 33:16.610]  Yeah, I met my best buddy.
[33:16.610 --> 33:18.210]  I haven't met Greenbody.
[33:18.210 --> 33:19.450]  I've never met Bodie, but I.
[33:19.450 --> 33:21.250]  But he's on my list.
[33:21.250 --> 33:23.770]  I know he's like, I'm a video.
[33:23.770 --> 33:27.650]  And he's definitely a wonderful soul.
[33:28.450 --> 33:31.730]  But yeah, so I was growing that.
[33:31.730 --> 33:37.610]  And then I was like, wait, maybe the PK is really very close to the the SVOG
[33:37.610 --> 33:41.370]  IBL, because when you look at the constituents in the in
[33:41.930 --> 33:45.770]  when you compare the Hollyweed to it, you can actually see
[33:46.170 --> 33:49.570]  that it's the same pretty much the same constituents
[33:50.210 --> 33:53.050]  to the purple vino that I have of the eight one eight headband,
[33:53.850 --> 33:58.370]  which is the which is the the the SFV leaner.
[33:58.690 --> 33:59.250]  You know what I mean?
[33:59.250 --> 34:01.770]  The green vino is the more AJ Sour Diesel.
[34:02.090 --> 34:04.810]  I'm probably just I didn't really say what it was, but
[34:05.530 --> 34:10.770]  a one eight headband is AJ Sour Diesel across to or at least from Cali
[34:10.770 --> 34:15.370]  C connection to the SFV IBL.
[34:15.650 --> 34:16.370]  Oh, yeah.
[34:17.410 --> 34:19.850]  And the eight one eight is for the San Fernando Valley.
[34:19.850 --> 34:23.090]  I guess that's what the homage is.
[34:23.090 --> 34:26.210]  So there's many different ones out there, but apparently the green one
[34:26.210 --> 34:29.090]  is more like the gas, the one that's the fuel.
[34:30.090 --> 34:34.610]  That's the hard to find kind of recessive one, you know, in there.
[34:34.610 --> 34:37.370]  That's not everything else goes purple normally.
[34:37.650 --> 34:39.570]  That was and that's my medicine.
[34:39.570 --> 34:40.130]  I don't know.
[34:40.130 --> 34:44.970]  I just and maybe I don't want to sound woo woo, but maybe I bonded with it by now.
[34:45.370 --> 34:49.290]  But I really feel that because I like Holly, the Hollywood, too, but it's more earth.
[34:49.770 --> 34:55.770]  Like, you know, if you break it down like Kevin, you know, has kind of actually proven,
[34:56.690 --> 35:03.130]  you know, I'm more of a fuel and I don't really I like a little fruit, but only if it has the fuel with the fruit.
[35:03.450 --> 35:05.210]  Like, you know, I mean, I want the gas.
[35:05.250 --> 35:05.930]  I want the gas.
[35:05.930 --> 35:08.130]  So and that Hollywood is awesome.
[35:08.130 --> 35:08.770]  But it's earth.
[35:08.770 --> 35:11.530]  It's more of that hashy type earth, which is wonderful.
[35:11.530 --> 35:12.690]  And it's really sandy.
[35:12.690 --> 35:16.330]  And I brought a jar with me to the to the conference.
[35:16.610 --> 35:19.730]  It actually I think James Jamison Wellborn posted it up.
[35:20.570 --> 35:22.610]  It's in a video from that from that.
[35:22.930 --> 35:25.010]  It was all just dry sieve.
[35:25.410 --> 35:26.690]  That thing just dumped.
[35:26.690 --> 35:27.610]  And it's wonderful.
[35:27.610 --> 35:32.490]  But it's more of that earthy, spicy kind of flavor.
[35:33.170 --> 35:40.010]  But it makes wonderful yellow rosin to like the brightest, brightest cultivar that I for pressing at least.
[35:40.530 --> 35:44.970]  And not not picked early, not, you know, not not prematurely picked.
[35:44.970 --> 35:46.410]  Yeah. Which is a popular thing.
[35:46.410 --> 35:48.930]  And you mentioned, you know, Kevin breaks it down.
[35:48.930 --> 35:51.050]  And I've ever since I heard him say it.
[35:51.050 --> 35:54.250]  Yeah. Barlow is you got your fruity, floral, earthy and gassy.
[35:54.250 --> 35:58.850]  You can pretty much break all cannabis down into one of those four categories.
[35:59.050 --> 36:05.050]  In Oregon, they have some cultivator cup something or cultivator something.
[36:05.490 --> 36:09.090]  And they do it all by it's double blind.
[36:09.570 --> 36:10.490]  I was listening to it.
[36:10.490 --> 36:12.770]  I think it was either Shango or on Tad's.
[36:12.770 --> 36:14.610]  But I listened to all these guys.
[36:14.610 --> 36:16.210]  They're great resources.
[36:16.210 --> 36:17.570]  If you don't listen to them.
[36:17.570 --> 36:20.570]  Yeah. And obviously future kind of future cannabis project.
[36:20.570 --> 36:22.050]  I've been watching all of you guys.
[36:22.050 --> 36:24.890]  And I'm kind of just like in a dream right now.
[36:24.890 --> 36:26.770]  Like, it's so surreal. Is this real?
[36:28.410 --> 36:30.610]  Hell yeah. So thank you, Chad, for having me.
[36:30.610 --> 36:32.690]  And I'm sorry if I'm just babbling all over the place.
[36:33.330 --> 36:34.690]  I'm really excited to be here.
[36:34.690 --> 36:37.250]  And and sometimes my passion gets away with me.
[36:37.250 --> 36:40.410]  And I don't know if I want I don't want to turn people off, but, you know, like I
[36:41.090 --> 36:44.130]  I can talk for hours. So it's the and it's
[36:44.130 --> 36:49.410]  and then when you find the people that are your people and and, you know, it's it's
[36:49.850 --> 36:53.210]  it's awesome. We've had some great conversations and I don't even know you.
[36:53.210 --> 36:55.130]  But I love you, man.
[36:55.130 --> 36:59.330]  Yeah, we're on the same page, man, is, you know, again, there's, you know,
[36:59.330 --> 37:03.330]  just even a lot of the personal factors that we talked about in our lives are very
[37:03.330 --> 37:07.330]  similar, which is, you know, always interesting because that's one of the fun things
[37:07.330 --> 37:11.290]  about cannabis, you know, like early I got into cannabis at an early age and it was
[37:11.290 --> 37:16.490]  really kind of almost, you know, the misfits of, you know, society or school or
[37:16.490 --> 37:17.970]  whatever you want to call it.
[37:17.970 --> 37:20.290]  But we all had a group.
[37:20.290 --> 37:24.810]  We all may have been like completely different, but we had a commonality and we were
[37:24.810 --> 37:26.410]  able to kind of bond over that.
[37:26.610 --> 37:32.090]  And I see that later in life, too, you know, with cannabis or natural farming or,
[37:32.090 --> 37:33.450]  you know, healthier approaches.
[37:33.450 --> 37:36.530]  It's like these things that we're deeply passionate about.
[37:37.370 --> 37:43.090]  Somebody who I may not have said hello to sitting next to on the bus all of a sudden
[37:43.090 --> 37:44.530]  it's like you grow. Really?
[37:44.530 --> 37:45.610]  Let's talk, you know.
[37:45.970 --> 37:47.450]  So I enjoy it.
[37:47.610 --> 37:49.370]  And you mentioned Tad, too.
[37:49.610 --> 37:51.490]  Tad is a person that I love talking about.
[37:51.490 --> 37:56.210]  I've used his Kiss Organics, the biochar soil.
[37:56.210 --> 37:57.930]  I did a water only run with that.
[37:57.930 --> 38:00.250]  And that's an impressive story, man.
[38:00.890 --> 38:01.970]  It is fabulous.
[38:01.970 --> 38:04.570]  And that's what I had tremendous.
[38:05.490 --> 38:11.810]  Well, I've been using a bunch of things, but right now I have a whole box of it that
[38:12.210 --> 38:13.330]  I'm reamending.
[38:14.690 --> 38:21.050]  But right now mine's in a mix of two of Build A Soil and his just because I ran out
[38:21.050 --> 38:26.290]  of the Kiss and I don't want to order anymore because of efficacy.
[38:26.530 --> 38:31.770]  So I have a well until until I have a farm, then I would order it probably.
[38:32.610 --> 38:36.530]  I even think Maincraft Cannabis, that's their big secret over there.
[38:39.570 --> 38:43.570]  You know, I mean, I think he's having something over here now, so I don't want to talk
[38:43.570 --> 38:47.810]  out of turn. But but I love the soil right now.
[38:47.810 --> 38:54.370]  It's in kind of started in in his and then it's in some another quality soil, the
[38:54.370 --> 38:56.010]  Build A Soil, which I love Jeremy, too.
[38:56.210 --> 38:57.530]  He's been very influential.
[38:57.530 --> 39:02.170]  I used to listen to him on like the grow whatever growers roundtable, whatever grow
[39:02.170 --> 39:04.770]  tube, whatever crazy day go something.
[39:04.770 --> 39:08.930]  I don't know. Back then, like with all those, you know, Mando, Adope.
[39:09.610 --> 39:13.530]  I'm kind of lucky geographically with the Kiss organic stuff.
[39:13.770 --> 39:19.370]  You know, I said yesterday it's like I'm sorry, but that podcast actually was told to
[39:19.370 --> 39:21.290]  me by someone in a grow shop.
[39:21.330 --> 39:23.930]  It's like, oh, you listen to the Cannabis Cultivation Science podcast.
[39:23.930 --> 39:25.530]  I was like, no.
[39:25.570 --> 39:28.690]  And ever since then, I probably listen to every episode twice.
[39:28.970 --> 39:32.370]  So, yeah, that's definitely a you're listening twice episodes.
[39:32.370 --> 39:33.450]  And I like it.
[39:33.490 --> 39:35.210]  Compost tea is phenomenal.
[39:35.250 --> 39:40.010]  It really is. I mean, a lot of people are saying you don't need to use compost tea and
[39:40.010 --> 39:41.130]  it's not worth the trouble.
[39:41.130 --> 39:43.090]  You can just top dress with a lot of compost.
[39:43.090 --> 39:44.570]  And and it's probably true.
[39:44.890 --> 39:48.490]  But that that compost tea definitely works.
[39:48.570 --> 39:52.370]  I know I've seen the plants just really respond to that.
[39:52.770 --> 39:58.010]  And, you know, kind of takes the guesswork out of it for home grower, really.
[39:58.010 --> 40:01.810]  You know, there's plenty of people that, you know, and there's and he even publishes tea
[40:01.810 --> 40:05.130]  recipes, I believe, that you can kind of do your own as well.
[40:06.570 --> 40:07.930]  Or maybe that's I don't know.
[40:07.930 --> 40:10.370]  But I love I love Tad's products.
[40:11.610 --> 40:17.490]  Yeah, you know, I use all the I only go that kind of like use the people that and
[40:17.490 --> 40:18.690]  there's other ways to do it now.
[40:18.690 --> 40:21.610]  Like now I want to aspire to do more K&F practices.
[40:21.610 --> 40:23.850]  I want to start to make my own.
[40:23.890 --> 40:28.130]  I have all this wonderful stuff out in the garden that I just need to start harvesting
[40:28.130 --> 40:32.610]  and and and, you know, making fermented, you know, plant extracts.
[40:32.610 --> 40:37.370]  And yeah, it's there's so many there's so many levels.
[40:37.370 --> 40:43.170]  And I'm just excited to start on that venture of the more, you know, natural Korean
[40:43.170 --> 40:45.170]  natural farming and ferments.
[40:45.170 --> 40:51.250]  And I mean, even though I do some and labs and whatever, but not like now.
[40:51.250 --> 40:53.090]  And I do is like sprouted CT.
[40:53.370 --> 40:58.210]  I think that's something that's really useful during like I mean, and that goes back to
[40:58.210 --> 40:59.010]  Clackamas Coot.
[41:00.050 --> 41:02.730]  Yeah, another great another great resource.
[41:03.050 --> 41:07.450]  So many people are using his third, third, third soil recipe out there.
[41:08.330 --> 41:11.490]  I think I bought a big thing from Tad of the barley.
[41:12.410 --> 41:16.890]  And the only reason I bought it at the shop was because it said I was planting a tree.
[41:16.890 --> 41:22.370]  So I was like, I'm going to get the mix or whatever it was that they had their own sprouted
[41:22.370 --> 41:24.810]  tea mix. It used to have like hemp seed in it.
[41:25.050 --> 41:26.810]  And then I think they changed it to something else.
[41:26.810 --> 41:36.130]  But if you don't grind it up enough, yes, the corn and corn is right behind me.
[41:37.610 --> 41:39.890]  I get all that kind of hurt.
[41:39.930 --> 41:47.130]  I got a I want to be doing the top dressing with his stuff this time, the nutrient pack.
[41:47.530 --> 41:48.530]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:48.570 --> 41:49.970]  That's what I have.
[41:49.970 --> 41:50.730]  Top dressing.
[41:51.410 --> 41:52.530]  Oh, it's just top dressing.
[41:52.530 --> 41:53.090]  OK, cool.
[41:53.530 --> 41:54.930]  Well, I might.
[41:54.930 --> 41:56.450]  I don't know. I need to read the directions, right?
[41:56.730 --> 42:02.290]  I'm not. Well, so originally he sent it to me to reamend my soil, which I was going to
[42:02.290 --> 42:07.610]  reamend the soil that I used of his because I actually I liked it so much that I wanted to
[42:07.610 --> 42:09.570]  bring it outside for vegetable production.
[42:09.930 --> 42:12.810]  So it's like one cup for every 10 gallons.
[42:12.970 --> 42:13.850]  I'm not. Yeah, yeah.
[42:13.850 --> 42:17.290]  One one cup per 10 gallons.
[42:17.290 --> 42:19.210]  Exactly. One cup per 10 gallons.
[42:19.210 --> 42:22.210]  Or it gives you, you know, half a cup for square footage.
[42:22.210 --> 42:24.090]  But yeah, this is a lot.
[42:24.090 --> 42:25.090]  So this should go a long way.
[42:25.090 --> 42:26.490]  And I'm excited to see.
[42:26.770 --> 42:27.930]  Or containers.
[42:29.650 --> 42:31.170]  You're in containers, right?
[42:31.490 --> 42:33.890]  Containers indoors for the cannabis.
[42:33.970 --> 42:36.050]  And I'm going to try that on some of those.
[42:36.530 --> 42:38.730]  But outdoors in beds for veggies.
[42:39.170 --> 42:44.090]  So what I'm trying to do now, and that's why I don't have all KISS organic soil in my mix
[42:44.090 --> 42:46.610]  now, because I I have three bins.
[42:47.050 --> 42:48.210]  This bin's ready now.
[42:48.210 --> 42:52.010]  Once I chop to go right into it, it'll be all KISS organics.
[42:52.330 --> 42:55.050]  I've already amended it one cup to 10 gallons.
[42:55.050 --> 42:56.410]  It's like a 50 gallon tote.
[42:57.170 --> 43:06.050]  And and I've already amended it and I've already put in some nematodes and I put in the
[43:06.050 --> 43:11.930]  grocashi, two different ones, the Atkinson's one, the grocashi and also the the
[43:11.930 --> 43:17.650]  terragonics one with the Malibu compost also in there enriched or whatever.
[43:18.130 --> 43:19.610]  And they're different grains.
[43:19.610 --> 43:24.690]  So they so like I have fuzzy spiraled tops and they're ready to go now.
[43:24.690 --> 43:30.010]  But I can't wait to see what this is going to be the third run on that.
[43:30.450 --> 43:32.490]  So you can roll your soil.
[43:32.850 --> 43:38.490]  But if you're in containers and I think Tad would recommend it, but I would confer with him that
[43:38.490 --> 43:41.210]  you probably want to take those balls apart.
[43:42.010 --> 43:43.170]  You don't have.
[43:43.170 --> 43:44.250]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:44.250 --> 43:46.490]  I would dump it on a tarp and just remix.
[43:46.490 --> 43:47.130]  Yeah. Yeah.
[43:47.130 --> 43:51.050]  And get it all homogenous with whatever.
[43:51.970 --> 43:55.650]  You know, yeah, yeah, I would I wouldn't leave it in the containers and try to do it just
[43:55.650 --> 43:57.010]  because I know what the rule is.
[43:57.010 --> 43:58.370]  You're just going to be a mess.
[43:58.730 --> 44:01.370]  But top dress, I you know, I don't know about.
[44:02.130 --> 44:03.290]  While it's alive.
[44:03.570 --> 44:07.770]  Yeah. While it's alive, I'll probably do a little top dressing because, you know, the
[44:07.770 --> 44:11.410]  Soham living soil, which I also used in the water only test.
[44:11.890 --> 44:15.010]  I like that. And I've got more bags of it here.
[44:15.010 --> 44:16.450]  So I'm using that again.
[44:17.330 --> 44:23.850]  But they were very accurate as far as, OK, seven gallons, you're going to get 60 days,
[44:23.850 --> 44:28.690]  you know, and I've been doing the math and I've let this last one veg a little bit longer.
[44:28.690 --> 44:32.850]  So I'm going to need to add something to it before the end.
[44:32.850 --> 44:35.010]  So I'm just like, well, I've got this sitting here.
[44:35.730 --> 44:37.850]  Let's see how it works as the top dress.
[44:38.210 --> 44:39.850]  So playing around.
[44:40.090 --> 44:45.890]  The first time I used the Soham soil, I got springtails and I was like, oh, no, what's
[44:45.890 --> 44:47.610]  going on? Oh, what do I do?
[44:47.610 --> 44:51.170]  What do I do? And then I was like, yay, they're springtails.
[44:51.570 --> 44:52.690]  You're good ones.
[44:53.810 --> 44:58.170]  I mean, when you learn growing anything moving in the soil is like.
[44:58.170 --> 44:59.370]  Yeah, it's like, no, no, no.
[44:59.370 --> 45:01.130]  D-Day, you know, it's all over.
[45:01.130 --> 45:02.250]  There's moving stuff.
[45:02.250 --> 45:05.370]  I haven't even entered worms into my my regime yet.
[45:05.410 --> 45:09.010]  I have the hungry bin and and I've had it there.
[45:10.850 --> 45:13.610]  The worms are doing great because I didn't start it with much.
[45:13.610 --> 45:17.650]  So I've been building, building and giving it all of my scraps and eggshells.
[45:17.650 --> 45:20.690]  And I guess I should be heating them first.
[45:20.690 --> 45:23.810]  But I've been just crunching them up and putting them in there.
[45:23.810 --> 45:33.570]  But it's pretty much like all just cocoa and and all my kitchen scraps or, you know,
[45:34.370 --> 45:36.930]  other than meat and whatever is supposedly good for the worm.
[45:36.930 --> 45:38.450]  So it's been sitting there for a long time.
[45:38.770 --> 45:40.930]  Now I'm going to introduce that into the bin.
[45:41.170 --> 45:45.490]  I must I mean, I must have some amazing castings in there.
[45:45.610 --> 45:50.090]  And and it's just yeah, it's amazing.
[45:50.090 --> 45:55.410]  The the the life that's going on, it's mostly all predatory mites like blooms of them.
[45:55.770 --> 45:57.090]  It depends on when you feed them.
[45:57.250 --> 46:00.130]  And then you can see that because I guess the worms regulate themselves.
[46:00.130 --> 46:02.730]  So I'll see like blooms of the worms, too.
[46:03.330 --> 46:05.210]  But if there's not enough food, they kind of go away.
[46:05.690 --> 46:07.490]  But it is another thing you have to take care of.
[46:07.490 --> 46:08.450]  It's another life form.
[46:08.850 --> 46:10.570]  And they're eating good, though.
[46:10.930 --> 46:12.890]  But I need to harvest those.
[46:12.890 --> 46:17.410]  And that's the next step, because like, you know, I could always said, oh, you're not
[46:17.450 --> 46:21.170]  growing in my mix because you don't have my you don't have my vermicompost.
[46:23.170 --> 46:24.490]  Yeah. Yeah.
[46:24.530 --> 46:26.170]  The magic ingredient, man.
[46:26.290 --> 46:28.770]  But yeah, I know there's so so many good things.
[46:28.770 --> 46:32.410]  And like now that's why I want to do this outdoors.
[46:32.410 --> 46:34.370]  I really want to do this for everything.
[46:34.370 --> 46:38.570]  It's crazy. Like the more you learn, it's like, oh, wow, this is
[46:40.730 --> 46:42.770]  Tiffany. It's it's limitless.
[46:42.810 --> 46:47.010]  And then, you know, like we said, we diversify from cannabis, too.
[46:47.010 --> 46:51.050]  And you get into other, you know, like blueberries, blueberry wants a totally acidic
[46:51.050 --> 46:53.810]  soil. It's going to take different feeding requirements.
[46:53.810 --> 46:59.290]  So you get to really play or, you know, make sure you you're painting with the right
[46:59.290 --> 47:05.170]  colors and everything. So that's another fun aspect of, you know, from juggling two
[47:05.170 --> 47:09.050]  to now you're juggling four and it all always keep progressing.
[47:09.730 --> 47:14.130]  I did that with our hydrangea.
[47:14.490 --> 47:19.530]  I tricked my girlfriend, I put some lime out there or whatever, and it changed the color.
[47:19.570 --> 47:20.930]  And she was like, what happened to the.
[47:22.330 --> 47:23.930]  What is going on?
[47:25.050 --> 47:29.850]  Yeah. Some some happy accidents to that's, you know, trial and error.
[47:29.850 --> 47:33.690]  I'd rather trial and error with some of the veggie stuff.
[47:33.730 --> 47:37.930]  And, you know, you mentioned earlier to like ferments and some of these things.
[47:37.930 --> 47:42.850]  It's nice to be able to kind of do a little bit on the cannabis plant instead of going
[47:42.850 --> 47:45.970]  all in and then just confirm your methodology.
[47:46.410 --> 47:47.730]  Do you think that's kind of important?
[47:49.610 --> 47:55.210]  Well, yes, it's like don't change too much at one time like but but I encourage people
[47:55.210 --> 47:59.330]  to try other ways, like maybe dedicate a space to doing something like that.
[48:00.370 --> 48:02.770]  You know, they're using the sub irrigated planters.
[48:02.970 --> 48:06.410]  They're really they're really good outdoors because you're you're conserving.
[48:06.850 --> 48:08.890]  You know, they want you to put the mulch cover on there.
[48:08.890 --> 48:15.610]  But if you're kind of polyculturing, it does use a lot of water, but it's a lot better
[48:15.610 --> 48:17.450]  than it's a lot.
[48:17.930 --> 48:19.690]  You know, it's definitely a lot more.
[48:21.770 --> 48:27.490]  Conservative, and I actually have a rain barrel here, too, so I collect on two places
[48:28.650 --> 48:32.690]  and it usually overflows my barrel, I think I need another barrel, but I try and use that
[48:32.690 --> 48:35.330]  as much as possible to fill all those containers.
[48:35.770 --> 48:41.930]  And I do kind of use out in my on my vegetables, I use the whole what Alan Atkinson and I
[48:41.930 --> 48:49.770]  learned from Kevin Jodery by putting EM1, one one shot of one ounce of EM1 in all my
[48:49.770 --> 48:54.050]  pots. And I know I just got off on a tangent, but I think it's important.
[48:54.050 --> 48:54.650]  What does that do real quick?
[48:55.850 --> 48:56.850]  Well, what does that EM1 do?
[48:58.130 --> 49:03.250]  It's there's like faculty of anaerobes in there so they can thrive in that wet, wet
[49:03.250 --> 49:07.610]  moisture and they kind of keep everything zooming along.
[49:07.610 --> 49:15.370]  And I mean, well, it was actually Atkinson and I recall watching a video of him and
[49:15.370 --> 49:20.290]  Kevin Jodery and they were actually reviving plants that were held indoors that really
[49:20.290 --> 49:26.250]  haven't seen the light of day that had problems, not necessarily certainly not HPLVD
[49:26.250 --> 49:27.410]  because you don't get rid of that.
[49:27.650 --> 49:34.530]  But they were actually reviving plants that were, you know, being held in inside for
[49:34.530 --> 49:41.250]  decades, bringing them outdoors, putting them in like an earth box or sub irrigated
[49:41.250 --> 49:44.610]  plant or patio pickers or whatever they have at Home Depot, Lowe's.
[49:45.370 --> 49:53.250]  And and then putting the plants in there, but also inoculating it with the Bokashi grain
[49:53.250 --> 49:57.650]  on top, which is EM1 and then putting EM1 in the reservoir.
[49:58.730 --> 50:04.410]  And they were they were actually reviving plants and bringing health and vigor back to
[50:04.410 --> 50:10.330]  these plants. And then they were able to take cuts from that and kind of, you know,
[50:10.370 --> 50:15.250]  bring up, I mean, really heal the plant to making it look totally different than like, oh
[50:15.250 --> 50:16.170]  my God, it's back.
[50:16.170 --> 50:17.370]  It's all you know what I mean?
[50:17.370 --> 50:24.290]  So and yeah, so I'm a really big believer of Bokashi and and that's why I want to learn
[50:24.290 --> 50:30.690]  so much more about ferments and canna and actually start doing it, you know?
[50:31.210 --> 50:36.890]  Yeah. Now, how much room do you expect this to take up if you're only doing it for a few
[50:36.890 --> 50:42.050]  plants? Can you get away with, you know, just like, oh, no, I know Herb has a little shelf
[50:42.050 --> 50:45.770]  I've seen on his program with all the all his little thing, you know?
[50:45.770 --> 50:48.730]  Yeah. And it doesn't take much because I think at that point, I think it's like one to a
[50:48.730 --> 50:50.490]  hundred or or I don't know.
[50:50.490 --> 50:53.890]  They're all different. That's what I want to learn, because, you know, Master Chow has kind
[50:53.890 --> 50:55.130]  of perfected this.
[50:55.130 --> 50:59.170]  And I guess his son has taken another step forward, too, or, you know.
[51:00.130 --> 51:01.770]  But to me, it's fascinating.
[51:01.770 --> 51:05.490]  So it's something that then I'm just like, it works.
[51:05.490 --> 51:06.410]  I know it works.
[51:08.210 --> 51:09.970]  There's earlier in the week.
[51:09.970 --> 51:11.210]  And it's cost effective.
[51:11.930 --> 51:17.970]  One of the things the takeaways from the from Wendy Kronberg was saying that they were able to
[51:17.970 --> 51:23.010]  produce twenty seven cents a gram as opposed to two hundred two dollars and seventy cents a
[51:23.010 --> 51:31.850]  gram. Just by using their biomass and fermenting and ferments and kind of using what's on
[51:31.850 --> 51:32.970]  your land. You know what I mean?
[51:32.970 --> 51:36.650]  And like, I don't know if I'm cut out for it, but I want to try.
[51:37.250 --> 51:42.730]  Yeah, right. And the older the older I get, the smaller the dream property gets.
[51:42.730 --> 51:45.690]  But yeah, no, it's it's still a dream.
[51:45.690 --> 51:46.970]  But exactly.
[51:46.970 --> 51:51.450]  Well, no, I want to manifest it because like, yes, I've like I haven't talked to anybody.
[51:51.450 --> 51:53.890]  It's like I finally feel like comfortable.
[51:54.290 --> 51:58.130]  Well, not really. I'm still not totally comfortable talking to people, but to people that are
[51:58.130 --> 52:03.770]  passionate about it, because I still used to have to like hide and it's like I'm fifty three.
[52:03.770 --> 52:09.690]  It's like I can't you know, it's like there's still this big stigma and, you know, it's
[52:09.690 --> 52:13.210]  dude, I see I'm wearing I'm wearing my belief cannabis shirt today.
[52:13.250 --> 52:17.770]  No, it's when it's one of those things where, you know, I have some, you know, nice
[52:17.770 --> 52:19.050]  cannabis related shirts.
[52:19.050 --> 52:22.650]  But when I put it on in the morning, I'm like, do I have to go to the grocery store?
[52:22.650 --> 52:24.250]  Do I need to go to the post office?
[52:24.970 --> 52:26.770]  Why am I still thinking this way?
[52:27.690 --> 52:29.850]  Right. But I mean, it's yeah.
[52:30.250 --> 52:33.130]  Yeah. It's and my answer was, no, I'm not going anywhere today.
[52:33.130 --> 52:35.170]  So believe sure it was.
[52:37.770 --> 52:41.610]  I mean, it's so funny because I almost today went out with this shirt that said flower
[52:41.610 --> 52:45.330]  power, but it's actually those solar cure UV bulbs.
[52:45.810 --> 52:51.130]  And I was like, no, no, you know, because people don't know that that's what that is.
[52:51.410 --> 52:52.930]  They just see a big marijuana leaf.
[52:52.930 --> 52:55.370]  And but we should be rocking it with pride.
[52:55.370 --> 52:57.010]  Like it's kind of ridiculous.
[52:57.010 --> 52:58.730]  Like, yeah.
[52:59.250 --> 53:06.290]  For for for I mean, I feel deeply about this plant as a medicine and it's like, why
[53:06.290 --> 53:07.810]  should you be ashamed of medicine?
[53:07.810 --> 53:09.890]  But still, we're older.
[53:09.890 --> 53:11.770]  We're a little bit more ingrained with this.
[53:11.770 --> 53:13.770]  But there are people believe it's medicine.
[53:13.770 --> 53:17.250]  Like even people that are in the game didn't even believe it was medicine until they
[53:17.250 --> 53:18.370]  owned a dispensary.
[53:18.850 --> 53:21.930]  And then it was like, oh, they saw how it actually helped people.
[53:21.930 --> 53:24.930]  And it was like, oh, yeah, this is awesome.
[53:24.970 --> 53:26.050]  Like, you know, and.
[53:27.010 --> 53:32.930]  You know, we we still want to get high, let's keep it real, but like we balance
[53:32.930 --> 53:34.810]  everything with order and balance, right?
[53:34.810 --> 53:35.890]  You know, yes.
[53:36.330 --> 53:39.130]  The first the first two bowls of the day are medicinal.
[53:39.530 --> 53:41.730]  Everything else after that is recreational.
[53:42.530 --> 53:46.650]  Some some to that effect, depending on your your therapeutic index.
[53:47.170 --> 53:48.170]  Yeah. Yeah.
[53:48.170 --> 53:49.370]  Now everybody's different.
[53:49.370 --> 53:51.130]  I might be two dabs, two dabs.
[53:51.130 --> 53:53.530]  I'm good. Two two dabs.
[53:53.530 --> 53:55.690]  I'll do. Yeah, that's awesome.
[53:55.890 --> 53:58.250]  Well, let's let's real quick to, you know, I want to shift.
[53:58.250 --> 54:02.530]  We've kind of been talking about growing and some of the organa philosophy and a little
[54:02.530 --> 54:05.210]  bit about your growing. Now you've been growing for a while.
[54:05.490 --> 54:07.530]  I believe you said, you know, kind of ninety eight.
[54:07.530 --> 54:10.210]  So you've got some practice in there.
[54:10.570 --> 54:15.490]  You're also you've won a few awards with your growing.
[54:15.490 --> 54:19.210]  Can you maybe tell us what you do right?
[54:19.210 --> 54:23.450]  Or, you know, some things that you've discovered along that journey that's improved
[54:23.450 --> 54:27.970]  you and elevated you to this level of growing where you're currently at today.
[54:31.310 --> 54:35.990]  It's it's kind of that adage of being the shadow, right, like being in the room,
[54:36.070 --> 54:39.950]  being making a connection, it is a sentient being.
[54:39.950 --> 54:41.430]  People don't understand. I don't want to start.
[54:41.510 --> 54:42.630]  People are going to probably tune out.
[54:42.630 --> 54:44.950]  But like, honestly, not on this channel.
[54:44.990 --> 54:49.070]  It and.
[54:50.270 --> 54:52.470]  And it also has to do with intent.
[54:53.230 --> 55:00.510]  I mean, yes, if you really into this plant, you're made a spiritual connection.
[55:00.510 --> 55:02.510]  This is like this is my spirit guide.
[55:02.550 --> 55:04.230]  This is my master plant.
[55:04.430 --> 55:07.310]  There's many other master plants that I need to explore, too.
[55:08.510 --> 55:13.110]  And just I mean, and even ones that aren't psychedelic, obviously talking about fungi.
[55:13.110 --> 55:16.030]  But I mean, this is the way to healthy living.
[55:16.030 --> 55:17.550]  This is the way to a healthy earth.
[55:17.790 --> 55:22.030]  This is a way to to scrub your system, to buy or mediate the earth.
[55:22.350 --> 55:25.190]  Like all these plants and stuff we need to learn.
[55:26.990 --> 55:31.070]  You know how you know, we need to use these resources.
[55:31.430 --> 55:32.710]  I just went off on a tangent.
[55:32.710 --> 55:33.430]  I'm sorry, but.
[55:34.070 --> 55:35.110]  No, it's fine.
[55:35.110 --> 55:37.430]  We're just, you know, unlocking some of that stuff.
[55:37.430 --> 55:41.750]  But we're talking about the things that you've learned and progressed on your journey to.
[55:42.190 --> 55:43.590]  You're already winning awards.
[55:44.350 --> 55:47.870]  Well, it's about the it's it's organics.
[55:47.870 --> 55:51.870]  It's it's it's, you know, fertility through biology.
[55:51.870 --> 55:56.470]  Like Joshua Stensland says, it's it's it's all those microbes.
[55:56.470 --> 55:57.750]  It's all those interactions.
[55:57.750 --> 55:58.950]  It's the exudates.
[55:58.950 --> 56:00.950]  It's the rhizophagy cycle.
[56:00.950 --> 56:03.950]  It's the fungi, the bacteria, all those things.
[56:03.950 --> 56:12.150]  You know, it's it's letting the plant do choose what it's going to take up.
[56:13.070 --> 56:21.870]  And giving it enough things to choose from so that it can it can make all those metabolites
[56:21.870 --> 56:27.110]  that it can put off that resin, because we're like we're growing resin, right?
[56:27.110 --> 56:29.390]  We're not growing. I mean, I mean.
[56:30.470 --> 56:33.710]  But that's what we're trying to stimulate, like in like.
[56:34.310 --> 56:39.510]  Whether we're using like chitin or insect brass or some types of chitin to to set up,
[56:39.510 --> 56:46.870]  you know, to stimulate a response or there's all different ways of stressors or, you know,
[56:46.870 --> 56:50.710]  a biotic or biotic, sometimes it's all good.
[56:50.830 --> 56:56.790]  Sometimes your worst grow is your best grow or from from from a visual standpoint, it is.
[56:57.150 --> 57:01.950]  But the plant is reacted to protect itself so that it could survive.
[57:02.710 --> 57:04.190]  And so it could be your medicine.
[57:05.590 --> 57:06.910]  It's like, I don't know.
[57:06.910 --> 57:13.910]  I mean, but yeah, there's a lot of crazy things that aren't crazy to me anymore that I thought might be crazy.
[57:14.150 --> 57:15.990]  I pop my seeds in my mouth and I do.
[57:15.990 --> 57:17.750]  I pop my seeds on the full moon now.
[57:17.870 --> 57:18.790]  I swear by it.
[57:19.150 --> 57:19.990]  I have a better.
[57:20.310 --> 57:27.390]  And I was talking to my friend, Chef Alex, the other day, and I was like, you know, every time I write number one, two, three, four or five.
[57:27.910 --> 57:31.590]  Why does number one more predominantly not be the best plant?
[57:32.150 --> 57:37.990]  Is it only because I've taken the one that's got the longest tap root on it and I put it in that cup?
[57:38.270 --> 57:41.510]  It's not true because I'm kind of just doing that selectively.
[57:41.510 --> 57:43.510]  And then I'm putting one, two, three, four, five.
[57:43.790 --> 57:45.950]  Is there there is an energy there?
[57:46.110 --> 57:47.110]  I can't deny it.
[57:47.110 --> 57:48.750]  It's happened so many times.
[57:49.270 --> 57:53.030]  You like we're so blind to things we don't I don't know.
[57:53.030 --> 57:53.430]  It's funny.
[57:53.430 --> 58:01.550]  Like sometimes you get, you know, like Homer Simpson never learns over and over and over, like he's stubbing his toe or doing the same thing.
[58:02.030 --> 58:06.270]  When do we open our eyes and go like, of course, that's the reason.
[58:06.270 --> 58:07.910]  Like there's a connection.
[58:07.910 --> 58:08.590]  There's an energy.
[58:08.590 --> 58:09.270]  There's a bond.
[58:09.270 --> 58:12.710]  There's we can't, you know, and actually do start to feel it.
[58:12.710 --> 58:14.990]  I've been doing Tai Chi and that's a whole nother show.
[58:14.990 --> 58:21.830]  But like, really, there is so many things and growing inside, you know, your plant isn't grounded either.
[58:22.070 --> 58:28.670]  Like that's why I am really think you need other paramagnetism and stuff like I just went off on another thing.
[58:28.670 --> 58:34.230]  But once you start to learn about all the things you like, I'm not using crystals yet, but I know that works.
[58:34.230 --> 58:35.150]  I know that works.
[58:35.150 --> 58:37.070]  I know they're crushing it up.
[58:37.070 --> 58:39.310]  I know they're using I mean, it's a fact.
[58:39.310 --> 58:40.270]  It's it's science.
[58:40.270 --> 58:45.310]  I think, you know, you know, Nature Summit up there is doing it.
[58:45.310 --> 58:46.790]  Those guys are amazing.
[58:46.830 --> 58:47.950]  They're amazing beings.
[58:48.430 --> 58:49.270]  I love those guys.
[58:49.270 --> 58:50.110]  They're like family.
[58:50.110 --> 58:51.310]  I only met them once.
[58:51.310 --> 59:00.230]  And, you know, I don't really talk too much, but, you know, that's a beautiful thing they're trying to do that they are doing that they're manifesting.
[59:00.470 --> 59:01.390]  And that's what it's about.
[59:01.390 --> 59:02.830]  It's about manifesting your dreams.
[59:02.830 --> 59:05.590]  And that's a segue back to these rewards.
[59:05.950 --> 59:14.230]  Maybe in the beginning, this was more about like, ah, this is more like I have something to prove to myself or I want to be I want people to know that I'm good at this.
[59:14.670 --> 59:18.710]  Now it's more about let's get the word out about healthy, clean medicine.
[59:18.710 --> 59:22.310]  Let's let's let's everybody can everybody can do this.
[59:22.590 --> 59:25.750]  I'm not there's so many amazing, talented growers out east.
[59:26.230 --> 59:34.270]  Everybody thinks the West is cornered for growers, but like there's so, so amazing growers all up the East Coast and the West Coast.
[59:34.270 --> 59:46.390]  And even even the homegrower that just takes the time to to care for a couple of plants, they're going to grow better stuff than they can get from the dispensary for real.
[59:46.910 --> 59:51.150]  Even on their worst growth, like, yes, and then they're going to be inspired, hopefully.
[59:51.150 --> 59:55.510]  And then hopefully they're going to go outside and say, I'm going to grow some tomatoes or shit.
[59:55.510 --> 01:00:00.710]  I don't have much space, but I'm just going to get four of these city pickers and like, oh, my God, I had enough tomatoes.
[01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.910]  I was giving them to my neighbors.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:05.350]  Like, you know, it's like it just takes that connection.
[01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.630]  And yeah, it's amazing.
[01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:15.630]  Things can happen when you manifest and you believe in the process and and say, you know, or put your mind to just doing good.
[01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.750]  Really, it's kind of like the vibe is everything.
[01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.030]  The energy, it's a wavelength.
[01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:26.670]  We don't, you know, that's why I'm like, oh, my God, the way it's so much not using the sun.
[01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:27.330]  Really?
[01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:28.310]  You know, yeah.
[01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:31.310]  And, you know, shout out to to Wolf Siegel.
[01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:33.350]  Listen to him and his talk about life.
[01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:34.830]  I mean, what was it?
[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.070]  Farmer in the Sky?
[01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.070]  Was that his podcast?
[01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.790]  Yes.
[01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:38.670]  Farmer in the Sky.
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.950]  Yeah.
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:40.150]  Yes.
[01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:49.630]  Yeah, it's it's all and to think, too, is, you know, it's such a lifelong pursuit to learn and to know these mechanisms.
[01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:54.230]  And let's just say theoretically somebody mastered all of what we know.
[01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:58.630]  We already know that we only know about five percent of what's in the soil.
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:03.750]  So even if you know everything, you still only know five percent of what's really going on.
[01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:10.990]  I hear someone or someone way back even then was saying, like, we know more about the the moon, the stars and the ocean than what's under our feet.
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.030]  I mean, it's still it's still true.
[01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:14.070]  Yeah.
[01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:14.590]  Yeah.
[01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:19.590]  And it's a wrong person, but like it's like it hasn't changed.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.870]  Just like it.
[01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:25.750]  Steiner's trying to tell us about like, oh, we're in we're in for another dust bowl here.
[01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:27.190]  Getting back to the dust bowl.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.710]  Nobody wanted to listen to him in 1924.
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.230]  He said we were going to erode our topsoil and all that.
[01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.790]  Everything that he said, it was like, oh, he's crazy.
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.230]  Like, is he crazy?
[01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.750]  He's right.
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:40.430]  How he's not crazy or he's on another level.
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.190]  That's all it is.
[01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:58.710]  Like sometimes I mean, I don't want to use but I mean, it's just I'm I'm believe in all this energies, vibrations, intent, love, love, like even Chris Trump would say love is the other fire.
[01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.430]  Right.
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:01.830]  We need that love for everybody.
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:07.230]  And the earth and everything that we put in our body because it becomes us and we are it.
[01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:11.590]  We are from all these all these things.
[01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:13.710]  So what did you say earlier?
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.430]  Where you miss humus beings?
[01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.150]  Humus beings.
[01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.310]  Yeah.
[01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.470]  But I that was quoted from Jerry.
[01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:21.230]  Excuse me, Jesse from Bio Vortex.
[01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:28.110]  I like that on a podcast or one of the meet the breeders with Kevin Jodry or stumbling across.
[01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:34.350]  Yes, I believe it was that or it was one of his talks, you know.
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:40.830]  Well, two things you said yesterday that, you know, I well, shit, actually, a lot of things resonated.
[01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:45.230]  I wrote down a lot of things, but two almost like taglines that like stuck out to me.
[01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:48.630]  The first one was educate and elevate.
[01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:50.830]  And that's kind of a personal mission of yours.
[01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:56.710]  So do you maybe want to explain how that's happened or is going to continue happening to educate and elevate?
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.430]  My mom was a teacher.
[01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:14.510]  So I really feel like that because it's so important if we the only way that we in this industry and and just as the culture, if we don't educate people, we can't shed the stigmas.
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:19.190]  We can't you know, we we need to show people that there is responsible use.
[01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.590]  There is people that are functional.
[01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:28.270]  They might get high as every day, but they're still pay their bills, pay their taxes.
[01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:43.510]  They're good people that aren't hurting anybody that are trying, you know, that are trying to live their best lives and pretty much, you know, are, you know, doing their best to to to live in harmony.
[01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.990]  So it's kind of it's not like.
[01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:58.150]  I struggle with it because growing up, it has been such a big stigma and it is the whole thing you're talking about the shirt like, oh, yeah, I got to what?
[01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:02.510]  Oh, this is organics and this is you know, they don't know this is the science podcast or whatever.
[01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:05.150]  Right. But I can't walk out with the with.
[01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.830]  But, you know, it's it.
[01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.310]  Yeah, it's weird.
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.070]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:20.670]  And I get emotional, too, because and I don't know, maybe I need to check my blood sugar to do what I need to do.
[01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.790]  Yeah, do whatever you need to do.
[01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:29.790]  Seriously, I I'll tell you a story about a friend who passed away.
[01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.590]  But yeah. So do what you need to do in those regards.
[01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.270]  And I can keep talking.
[01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:40.790]  But, you know, the education and elevation is such a huge thing.
[01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:47.470]  And it's an it's an admirable thing from my perspective, because it's a very community based perspective.
[01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:52.630]  It's not, you know, get rich or die trying type of, you know, phase.
[01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:58.590]  And there's there's so many different types of people and personalities in this world that I wish we could.
[01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:04.710]  You know, I'm glad for the diversity, but I wish we could all love, you know, little kiddies and walks on the beach.
[01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.190]  That's just not the reality.
[01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.230]  There's going to be all kinds of people that you're going to deal with throughout life.
[01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:17.350]  So when you do or when I do come across people like yourself, I appreciate that more.
[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:20.670]  The intent. The other thing you said, you know, was growing with intent.
[01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.270]  And that was an important thing, too.
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.270]  You want to touch on that one, maybe?
[01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:33.230]  Yeah. Making that medicine as wholesome as possible as you can in every regard.
[01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:39.830]  And like even I don't know, I just I'm a very it's easy to say, you know, and I try.
[01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:45.670]  I want to like every time I like I look at things that I do sometimes like, oh, man, you need to start doing better about that.
[01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.790]  Like, why are you buying bottled water? Oh, you need the filter.
[01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:54.750]  Well, now you need I'm going to get a keg and I'm definitely actually that's on the list, too, because I'm learning about this.
[01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.230]  Every time we learn things, it opens.
[01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:00.070]  It's just a whole nother web of wonder in one.
[01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.190]  But, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.350]  I'm just I know I have a low blood sugar.
[01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:07.910]  That's why I just did some Manuka honey.
[01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:11.230]  This is my favorite go to factor 16.
[01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.630]  It's like 78 percent real Manuka honey.
[01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:19.430]  And this is like higher percentage than like it has like the same antioxidants.
[01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:25.710]  And it's almost like 10 times stronger than hydrogen peroxide.
[01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:28.430]  But it's a good it's actually it's good.
[01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:34.190]  It's a prebiotic, probiotic and actually a factor 16.
[01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:38.310]  It's not a pharmaceutical grade, but you can put this on your cut.
[01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:45.510]  You can you know, it's like tea tree extract Manuka honey, Manuka.
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.150]  That's another thing. Like we don't learn about these things.
[01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.790]  And it's like, oh, oh, man, no.
[01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.990]  Like I actually had a product of nature.
[01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:57.230]  I actually I don't know, but I took antibiotics that drove me crazy.
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.830]  But I had actually appendicitis.
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:04.910]  It was a non-perforated, non-complicated, but they gave me an option to do
[01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.430]  antibiotic therapy.
[01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:13.030]  Now I wish I got the the now I wish I got the operation.
[01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:14.670]  They took my appendix out, but they didn't.
[01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.470]  And this is kind of what I did.
[01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:20.390]  I did this after and lots of yogurt to try and get my butt.
[01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:24.870]  But honestly, that was another thing that made me understand about the gut biome.
[01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.070]  I was not myself after I took the flagel and the Cipro.
[01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.430]  Like I still have my appendix and it's been five years.
[01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:37.350]  But I mean, and they do treat in Helsinki and in these other places, kids now with
[01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:40.710]  this treatment. So I'm in the hospital trying to figure out, am I going to operate
[01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:42.710]  or not? But anyway, Manuka honey.
[01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:44.230]  And that's interesting.
[01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.190]  And that just it all ties into the gut biome again.
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:55.070]  And we're only as you know, it this is this is our our stomach, our biome is our
[01:07:55.070 --> 01:08:00.190]  first brain. We this is everything revolves around, you know, and that's why
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:04.670]  cannabis is so wonderful, because it can it can react on these receptors.
[01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:07.310]  And like I've listened to like, you know, Dr.
[01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:10.990]  Ethan Rousseau and try and think of a reverse agonist, agonist, antagonist.
[01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:15.310]  Like I'm trying to still stay in the pocket and listen to all that.
[01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:18.030]  But I mean, I love it. I just geek out on all of that stuff.
[01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:24.510]  And and it's just science is showing that this plant is, you know, it's not the
[01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:30.510]  panacea, but it's the gateway to, you know, healthier living.
[01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:34.390]  And cannabinoid system, we're learning more about that every day.
[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.110]  We're learning about more receptors.
[01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:40.470]  We're learning about more areas of our body that the cannabinoids act on, whether
[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:43.310]  it be the THC or something like CBN.
[01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:46.150]  You know, it's a constantly learning process.
[01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:51.550]  Dr. Ethan Rousseau, that's usually the first name I look to when it comes to that
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:54.390]  type of work. He's been in it for a long time.
[01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:55.830]  He worked for GW Pharma.
[01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.430]  He's broken out on his own.
[01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:02.950]  The guy definitely has legs to stand on as far as credibility.
[01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:04.870]  And I've got to meet the guy, too.
[01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:12.670]  He lived up on the Orcas, yeah, Vashon Islands, up in that area here.
[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:18.350]  And we did a little well, I didn't do it, but it was a cannabis contest called
[01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:20.310]  Terpestival. It was fun.
[01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:24.790]  But he was the keynote speaker and shared some pizza and conversations with that guy.
[01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:29.230]  And that was cool because, yeah, he's he's the leading guy.
[01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:33.550]  So it's nice to see him out there and still doing things.
[01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:40.150]  And he also has a company, True Terpenes, that we were talking earlier about, you know,
[01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:46.270]  the synergistic effects or, you know, entourage full spectrum.
[01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:50.030]  And he's a big proponent of that, too.
[01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:55.750]  You had you mentioned earlier that you grow like, oh, I think you're on mute right now.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.710]  Let's see, are you muted? Yeah, you're muted on your end there.
[01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.350]  Looks like if you hit the mute button, you're good.
[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.710]  The sorry, Chad.
[01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.190]  Yeah, no, his latest thing is the cryo keep.
[01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:11.710]  I was listening to a wonderful pop and I'm getting I don't know if it was Tad or if it was
[01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:17.790]  Shango, but he was on recently and talking about the cryo keep and the importance of saving
[01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:22.750]  those volatile compounds before they, you know, because by the time we dry the flower,
[01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.190]  we've lost 50 percent.
[01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:28.150]  And there you know, so there's a lot of exciting stuff that he's doing now, too.
[01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:30.190]  And that's, I guess, his own venture as well.
[01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.910]  Yeah, it's I yeah, I try and follow everybody.
[01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:38.670]  I'm you know, it's funny because I would say I know a lot.
[01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.630]  I know a little about a lot.
[01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:45.230]  Man, it's hard to be an expert in everything.
[01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:49.990]  That's why you have to. That's why, you know, good companies have good managers that hire
[01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:54.870]  right. Hire the right specialist for the job that gets along with everybody else.
[01:10:55.830 --> 01:11:00.070]  You know, I was in music for a long time and I also did management there and books,
[01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.150]  international tours.
[01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.670]  And it's like, yeah, musicians are musicians, man.
[01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.230]  They're not the back office people.
[01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:10.830]  So you got to have multiple brains working together to accomplish some of these things.
[01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:14.030]  And the larger you get with growing, you need that, too.
[01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:15.030]  You can't do it all.
[01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:16.070]  You have to delegate.
[01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:23.070]  But it's nice to learn the processes or your SOPs on kind of the smaller scale and then try
[01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.910]  to, you know, translate and scale those up.
[01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:27.990]  There we go. That's a nice way.
[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:30.070]  What are you smoking here, actually?
[01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:35.830]  This is my eight one eight headband, the green Fino, and this is just dry.
[01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:41.430]  This is just dry so that I press this morning so so I could get this color a lot better.
[01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.830]  But really, this is was cured like this was like 70 days.
[01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:47.190]  And this is not doing it justice.
[01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.270]  You can't even see the light at the right angle here.
[01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:52.230]  But it's weird because the camera is always backwards.
[01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:55.830]  But yeah, that's so good.
[01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:56.710]  Snaps this.
[01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.350]  This shows the color better here.
[01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.230]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:06.230]  It you know, but again, it's it was harvested to for flower to enter flower.
[01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:11.870]  I just entered this into the to the Freedom Rally, the Freedom Cup that they're doing on the
[01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:15.230]  Boston Common, which is kind of the place to go.
[01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:19.030]  Used to be a sit in, you know, for Boston here to smoke out.
[01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:23.470]  And and it's turned into a really.
[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:29.830]  For me, it's surreal because I'm not used to like I'm used to sneaking around trying to smoke on the
[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:36.190]  common like it's like a bonfire, everybody's you know, it's kind of like a festival.
[01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:39.350]  With towns everywhere, it's like what?
[01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:43.270]  Everybody's looking at the old guy going behind the bush to smoke.
[01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:44.710]  It's like, why is he going back there?
[01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.670]  That was like, you want this?
[01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:47.190]  You want that?
[01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:55.710]  But yeah, Uncle Stone or Bobby West had that squash shop last year down there, and I didn't place in that one.
[01:12:55.710 --> 01:13:00.430]  But that was was kind of what got me into entering those competitions.
[01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.830]  And I don't know.
[01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:02.430]  I was about that.
[01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.670]  I didn't even know they kind of existed.
[01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:09.150]  Like the first time I entered one was the Harvest Cup and I've entered a couple of times.
[01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:15.110]  Never won. But at the Harvest Cup, the squash shop, I got second place.
[01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:18.550]  And I wasn't going to give up.
[01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:25.470]  I had three entries in the Harvest Cup and then and then I and I and then I entered the Dabadoo and I got
[01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:32.950]  third place. And that was actually a flower rosin that I entered in the rosin category.
[01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:34.990]  That was amazing.
[01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.590]  I'm so thankful for that.
[01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:41.430]  And and then on 420, I won first and second place at Dr.
[01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:46.550]  Green's with Brett Bogue and Bobby West, Uncle Stoner and USA squash shop.
[01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:50.270]  I came in first and second for the two Finos of the 818 headband.
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:55.910]  And and then I won for the purple headband.
[01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:59.950]  I didn't enter my green Fino because I didn't have it at the time for the Commonwealth Cup.
[01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:04.430]  And I just got third place for flower at the at the Commonwealth Cup.
[01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.910]  So. Yeah.
[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.830]  And then there are ghost events.
[01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:12.830]  Somebody I used to see at the store, high grade herb.
[01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.150]  Shout out to high grade herb.
[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.350]  He came in second.
[01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:16.750]  He's an organic grower.
[01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:17.950]  It was so crazy.
[01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:21.910]  I saw him at the at the at the region conference and I was so happy to see him.
[01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.750]  But I think I didn't even see him the first day because he didn't have his dreads.
[01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:27.550]  And I was like. He's a John.
[01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:28.750]  I was like, where do I know?
[01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:30.070]  Oh, my God. Herb.
[01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.790]  What the? Unbelievable.
[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:35.350]  So come to find out that, you know, he won.
[01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:42.750]  He came in second. So it was really, really special to know that two organic growers are on the podium.
[01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:52.430]  Yeah. To kind of show that that, you know, sometimes it you know, there's many ways to create more metabolites.
[01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:58.670]  But I really think that it's, you know, that biology, you know, I mean, we know we know.
[01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:01.550]  But once we start doing it, it's hard to make a change.
[01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:08.550]  And you never want to take everything at once, either, because then it's just like there's no there's no method to your madness.
[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.270]  There's no. But try it out.
[01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:15.390]  Try it out. I just encourage, you know, people are killing it, doing it every which way.
[01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:21.550]  I'm not. Dude, there's fire everywhere and indoor, outdoor, whatever way there's, you know.
[01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:28.590]  But. I just like to see someone try it or or or at least consider trying it like.
[01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:31.430]  I'm not doing that. That's too much trouble. That's too much work.
[01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:34.390]  But really, in the end, it doesn't. Isn't it less work?
[01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:37.030]  It's like, oh, it seems like a lot mixing this.
[01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.830]  What? How much milliliters of this and that?
[01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.230]  And wait, what day is it? Oh, this and that.
[01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:47.470]  Like it is a chart. And I mean, and then there's people have their wonderful recipes and then there's people doing it all different ways.
[01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:51.070]  I'm not I love the plant and I don't want to discourage anyone.
[01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:56.310]  I just want people to try and think about how they can be more ethical about what they're doing.
[01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:02.110]  And kind of bond with the plant more risk.
[01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:05.670]  And then and it's about the patient that you know what I mean?
[01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:07.990]  Like. That's the intent.
[01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.070]  The intent is the end user.
[01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:15.350]  And when I'm trying to make this my medicine, I'm obviously going to try to do the best I can.
[01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:19.870]  I go in there and show you stuff I got in fine woodworking design book in American Woodworker magazine.
[01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:24.390]  Right. I'll look at it. I'll still see all the imperfections because it's a lot.
[01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.550]  It's a lifelong, never ending pursuit.
[01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:30.070]  And this plant is is amazing.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.430]  And it's the same thing.
[01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:34.790]  You can you can spend your whole life just learning about mycology.
[01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:38.150]  You can spend your whole life just learning about, you know.
[01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:43.710]  Oh, man, it's just it's fascinating to me and I love it.
[01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:49.630]  So I'm sorry if I went off on all these things, but I'm passionate about it.
[01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:50.870]  There's you can't fake passion.
[01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:53.950]  You know, when you start talking to someone, if they're really about the plant.
[01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:59.830]  Yeah. You know, everybody we need to make money, but there's room for both.
[01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:03.030]  There's room for both. Yeah, there is.
[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:15.430]  And, you know, I'm glad that you mention it, because, you know, a lot of us, you know, in that space do have to make some sort of money to, you know, pay the car payment or keep the lights on or, you know, keep everybody in the house fed.
[01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.070]  So there is a little bit of that.
[01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:22.950]  But then there's also the well, I'm driving a Hyundai, not a Ferrari.
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:27.230]  You know, I'm eating the you know, the, you know, two for ones.
[01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:29.550]  I'm not eating the, you know, T-bone.
[01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:33.550]  So, yeah, there's a lot of different ways that people.
[01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:34.750]  I guess I feel guilty.
[01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.790]  I feel like I'm not living my life right.
[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:44.030]  Like as I now that I know what I should be doing, I need to make this move to be close, you know, reconnect with the land and, you know.
[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:46.510]  Practice what I preach.
[01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:48.550]  It's amazing.
[01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:53.470]  I mean, really, it's like and that's what I, you know, on some level and definitely do.
[01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:54.710]  I'm going to manifest that, too.
[01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.150]  And it's amazing to this.
[01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:11.630]  Like when you said when somebody is truly passionate about it, you know, I've known people and been in that position where it's like they've been really passionate about growing and, you know, they've gone just to like grow vegetables and like, well, you know, I'll make my money at, you know, my little farm stand.
[01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:17.310]  And it's not something that's necessary, very lucrative, but they put their everything into it.
[01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:23.150]  And that attracts people and the quality of their product speaks for itself.
[01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.950]  And that in itself is what actually brings them the wealth.
[01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.470]  It wasn't their search for the wealth.
[01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.790]  It was their search to do it right.
[01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.430]  And that's something that, you know, I wrote about you.
[01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:39.550]  I love your just do it right attitude and kind of other things that fall into place after that.
[01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:49.230]  I was going to say that, you know, I got to meet Kobe Guy, who is the Cellar Door Collective or Cellar Door Garden.
[01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:57.950]  And he's somewhere over in Sacramento, but he's a KNF guy and he grows peppers and he grows all these other things.
[01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:08.030]  And he supplies, you know, these wonderful things to like Michelin star restaurant, a chef, a friend of his or something.
[01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:16.750]  Hopefully I'm not bastardizing the story, but basically, essentially he grows vegetables and he makes ferments and he makes the best hot sauce.
[01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:20.790]  They were joking about it with Suzanne Wainwright and Chris Trump.
[01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:24.750]  And, you know, he makes these wonderful fermented peppers and stuff.
[01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.070]  I've never, I didn't get any.
[01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:27.110]  Send me some.
[01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.630]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:37.230]  But it just shows that like, if you can grow, you can grow, you can supplement your income.
[01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:43.990]  Like that's what, that's why when I have a place, it's going to be growing herbs and medicinal herbs as well.
[01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:48.110]  But like, you know, I'm all like, I mean, I have lemon balm.
[01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:49.670]  I got all these things I need to start using.
[01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:57.470]  I can't wait to get schooled on how to, how to make ferment all this stuff and the time to pick them for the different times I'm going to apply
[01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:01.550]  them. And I mean, I'm already learning, but it's like, I wanted the hands-on.
[01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:06.110]  But I'm sorry if I went off on another tangent.
[01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:07.950]  No, you're fine. It just made me think too.
[01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:17.950]  It's like for any, for any legacy growers that are complaining about the price of a pound these days, look at how much you get paid for ginseng and reconsider per pound.
[01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:20.910]  But you had mentioned hoop houses and light tapper.
[01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:23.590]  I want to grow a lot of stuff off season.
[01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:29.710]  You know, if you grow off season, there's always more of a demand and a better price and there's more of a challenge too.
[01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:30.910]  But yeah, sorry, saffron.
[01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:32.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:38.710]  No. And I mean, I think that where the class is going to be held at Dave Green's, he's a very, very nice gentleman.
[01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.870]  He's got, he grows greens on the Cape Cod.
[01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:45.430]  It's like you, and you can do it.
[01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:46.390]  Like people are doing it.
[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:49.230]  And I really, I admire all these people so much.
[01:20:49.350 --> 01:21:00.030]  Like even like, I mean, I don't, I got to meet him, you know, and I really appreciate all these people that are trying to like Nicholas Mahmood from Green Source Gardens.
[01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:08.910]  I don't even know the gentleman, but like he blows me away with his talks and, you know, and it's just like, man, I cannot even do what he's doing.
[01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:10.350]  Like, yeah, I guess I can.
[01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:15.470]  It's like you only, if you argue for your limitations, they are yours, you know, like you got to manifest stuff.
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:18.390]  You got to like, so now I've been kind of like, what have I been waiting for?
[01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:23.950]  But maybe it's just finally like this calling is like, you know, this is what I want to do.
[01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:35.470]  I want to, want to do my part to, you know, educate other people and inspire and, you know, so yeah, education and elevation.
[01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:37.750]  Like I was always brought up that knowledge is power.
[01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:42.630]  And my mom was, you know, has her master's in education from Denmark.
[01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:45.510]  So she was always an educator and chef instructor.
[01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:50.910]  So I think I'd be good at it and I don't have any kids.
[01:21:50.910 --> 01:22:15.390]  So I kind of at the point in my life where I want to, you know, give back, I want to share, you know, and it's important because this is like I do as I learn all about the soil, the soil food web and in all these intricate interactions and exudates and enzymes and, you know, all this.
[01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:16.470]  Wonderful stuff.
[01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:22.630]  It's like, I can't help, but want to go and finally have, you know what I mean?
[01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:23.230]  I have to do it.
[01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.030]  I have to do it now.
[01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.390]  But, um, there's a calling man.
[01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:29.990]  Change is scary when we're comfortable.
[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.030]  We don't like to change.
[01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:34.630]  So that's another big factor that holds people back is, you know, people are comfortable.
[01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:36.070]  People don't like to rock the boat.
[01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.950]  It's scary.
[01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:45.310]  But when you hear that calling and it's loud enough and you're true to yourself, man, sometimes you do, you gotta, you know, as they say, bite on,
[01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:48.350]  bite down on the mouthpiece and just go for it.
[01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:51.790]  Well, I spent too much of my life saying, oh, I can't do that.
[01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:52.750]  I can't do that.
[01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.630]  Right.
[01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:56.070]  And that just, that's what manifests.
[01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.870]  Yeah.
[01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.430]  Yeah.
[01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:03.070]  You know, it's, uh, tell me I can't do something and that's pretty much a guarantee.
[01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:04.070]  I'm going to do it.
[01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:10.750]  You know, I'm like, I wish my parents would have told me I couldn't be a doctor or a lawyer when I was young, but now they did.
[01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:14.110]  So, you know, here I am and I'm happy.
[01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:21.750]  Um, but yeah, there's, there's a lot of things that we have to fight internally to get there too, because there's the security.
[01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:27.630]  But when you have that true belief and you have the right work ethic, I think, uh, things can be accomplished.
[01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:29.550]  So I see that for you.
[01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:32.350]  Where do you see yourself in five years?
[01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:33.710]  Are you going to have a business?
[01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:37.590]  Are you going to have like a, uh, processing facility?
[01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:40.270]  Uh, where, where do you see yourself?
[01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.790]  Yeah.
[01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.550]  I mean, that's, that's, that is the goal.
[01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:56.550]  And, um, I'm, there's a bunch of people that I hopefully we're going to get together and do this because I, you know, like my good friend, Alex Feldbauer, he's the chef.
[01:23:56.590 --> 01:24:01.790]  He's won four awards for edibles and he's worked in the industry.
[01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:06.510]  Um, and, um, so, and he's a great, he's a fabulous grower too.
[01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:12.710]  And he's, uh, you know, he's all about the, um, in all of his cooking and all of his culinary arts.
[01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:28.630]  They're all like, even, uh, it was Josh, um, Dutch, Joshua, uh, Rutherford that was like, these are some of the best bio available, um, edibles that I had because it goes back to taking the pride in the intent and what you're making.
[01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:34.750]  All those ingredients are like, he uses a tapioca starch, so there's no like raw sugar.
[01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:37.310]  So it's a slower, it's not a spike.
[01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:39.470]  It's a better glycemic index.
[01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:52.550]  The packaging is, is, is, you know, as biodegradable as possible, you know, like, um, but I do see us having our own, um, I know I'm, I'm very proud of him.
[01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:54.670]  So I, you need to interview him, bro.
[01:24:54.670 --> 01:25:01.630]  He's definitely, um, you know, he, we, we're going to be in five years, we're going to have a farm.
[01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.190]  This is manifesting right now.
[01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:04.910]  We're going to have a farm.
[01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:06.710]  We're going to grow vegetables.
[01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.310]  We're going to teach kids to grow.
[01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:20.950]  And, uh, I'm getting emotional, but, and, uh, we're going to grow, we're going to grow some of the finest cannabis and, um, and Medicaid get people good, good medicine.
[01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:24.590]  And, um, yeah.
[01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:36.630]  And process and make some of the best hash and rosin, uh, and rosin infused edibles that, that, um, that'll blow your mind because you already, people are trying his caramels.
[01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:44.950]  People tried to eat one for his stoop waffle, you know, he got for me candy, one first place for that.
[01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:47.030]  It was a delicious praline nut.
[01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.870]  Oh my God.
[01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:51.390]  Like, so, and, and it's all like full spectrum.
[01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:53.750]  Like, so it's, it's wholesome medicine.
[01:25:53.750 --> 01:26:01.670]  It's it's, it, it has the synergy of all of those entourage because it's, you know, so that's what we want to do.
[01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:03.510]  We want to bring those types of markets to the product.
[01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:05.670]  There's plenty of people that are killing it and doing it.
[01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:08.390]  And, um, my hats off to all of them.
[01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:09.110]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:12.830]  I just want to be beside them doing it too, and doing it for the right reasons.
[01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:16.550]  And that is, this is so admirable.
[01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:18.190]  You know, it's like, it's hats off.
[01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:29.030]  You know, the first thing, you know, you mentioned vegetables, you want to teach the kids, dude, if you teach one kid and they teach one kid and they teach one kid, that's how we win.
[01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:30.550]  That's how we succeed.
[01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:34.070]  I don't know how I was never taught this.
[01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:38.510]  I had my grandparents that were definitely growing vegetables, but I just never got into it because I was in the city.
[01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:39.470]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:42.870]  So it was kind of like, what the, you know, like, it's true.
[01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:43.670]  It's like it.
[01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:48.030]  So we kind of, we don't even see ourselves out there.
[01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:51.750]  Cause it's like, you know, we don't, we don't care because we don't, we don't know to care.
[01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:54.390]  That's true, man.
[01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:55.710]  That's something that I deal with.
[01:26:56.670 --> 01:27:00.350]  I deal with some of my neighbors sometimes, you know, there is actually one neighbor and
[01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:03.030]  they've got kids, you know, that are boys that are teenagers.
[01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:12.470]  They're not doing really anything different than I did when I was that age, but there's a lot of just like little like common courtesy or lack of respect things.
[01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:17.470]  And like some of the other people in the neighborhood, you know, like, Oh, those kids are pieces of shit.
[01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:18.350]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:21.870]  And I'm just like, look, man, they don't have the example.
[01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:23.070]  They don't know better.
[01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.870]  You can't expect them to know better.
[01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:26.070]  It's like, yeah, we would hope.
[01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:36.350]  And the more we actually treat them like people and talk to them, the better it will be because anybody that greeted me as a teenager was like, Oh, you're a piece of shit.
[01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.710]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:43.270]  I was a skateboarder and you know, that got the middle finger that didn't get my ears open that, you know, got the bird going.
[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:45.310]  So yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:46.870]  That was a tangent that there we go.
[01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.110]  I threw him my Tony Hawk.
[01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:53.950]  I have a Tony Hawk skateboard from back in the day, you know, original with the real.
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:54.990]  Yeah.
[01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:57.110]  But no people, people also go back now.
[01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.630]  Now I remember.
[01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:05.190]  But you know, we need those examples and it's great to be the person that's able to want to go out there and to try to set that example.
[01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:10.150]  You know, again, traditionally speaking, that hasn't been the most lucrative position.
[01:28:10.150 --> 01:28:11.150]  That's like teachers, man.
[01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:17.230]  I wish teachers got paid like fucking NBA players, but they don't because they don't have jersey sales.
[01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:21.390]  But yeah, it's oh, sorry.
[01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.590]  I'll stop there.
[01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:26.470]  It's just one of those things, but I'm glad that you're going to be the example.
[01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:31.270]  You're hitting the head on the nail and it's yeah, it's really.
[01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.430]  Yeah, we're.
[01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:40.910]  Yeah, so I like your plans, five to 10 years, man, we're going to be checking in here.
[01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:42.910]  I know the future cannabis products going to go.
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:48.630]  Yeah, you know, I'm I'm yeah, I'm ecstatic to like we've actually been.
[01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:53.830]  Well. Five years, we'll say five years.
[01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.470]  Yeah, definitely have that up and running, but.
[01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:59.030]  At least, you know.
[01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:14.510]  And now I want to get to kind of some some growth questions because I don't process anything into other than I make like water hash with my extra, you know, the lar for the trim or whatever, I don't actually squish everything.
[01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:17.350]  I don't have the means or really the knowledge to do that.
[01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:21.870]  So I want to ask you, because there's a lot of people out there who are and do.
[01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:35.910]  Is there anything in particular you should be doing while you're growing the flower that is maybe different for something that's going to be used in that manner versus just like flower?
[01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:42.750]  You already feed the organic way, but is there anything else that people do?
[01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:50.670]  Um, well, I use the sprouted this SST, you know, the sprouted seed tea.
[01:29:52.190 --> 01:30:04.430]  I feel that helps, but I know that like I try and use a little extra sulfur and I try and, you know.
[01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.550]  And then.
[01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:13.670]  Well, I also use, I do use Jeremy build the soils product, the flower.
[01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:16.550]  A little bit of the.
[01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:24.710]  He's got a product build a bloom. They even have a top dress. I haven't used that yet. I'm going to try it. So I'm always trying different things. So.
[01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:38.710]  I'm not afraid to try something and say, Hey, and because I think I encourage people to do that because you, you know, it's great when someone tells you this is great. This is great. But really seeing is believing so and what someone might have a great.
[01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:48.190]  You know, result with might not be a great result for you or, you know, there might be different factors of your growing style.
[01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:58.590]  Um, you know, but I'm, you know, I'm always trying different things and I'm always listening. Definitely. I mean, it's kind of like if you, you know, you're part of the fun.
[01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:06.310]  Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It is it's being a scientist. It's being your own scientists, the citizens citizen scientists like
[01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:16.270]  And kind of, you know, because sometimes it's like, Oh, no, no, like I've tried to clone any every pretty much every way I started out like years ago with the rock world because that's what it was.
[01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:23.190]  I've even used, you know, like deep water culture just made my own little box. Then I use the arrow cloners.
[01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:32.230]  And now I'm like, you know what, everybody's like, Oh, that's great. So I don't forget it. But I actually kind of using the whole Jeremy build a soil method with just the
[01:31:33.230 --> 01:31:43.710]  Horticultural aloe and pelvic acid and exit out the axle 16 and I've been getting really good rooted clones, but I've also just got a great rooted clones with just using
[01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:54.030]  The A's. Oh, you know, just making a slurry and dipping, you know, I mean, back in the day it was like Olivia's because I was like, um, even back then I was trying to grow organic but that's
[01:31:54.630 --> 01:32:00.150]  I found out that's not even like a rooting hormone. I never really did use hormone X or all this stuff. And now
[01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:13.590]  You can even wrote just in your media in your cups like I've done that to where I actually let cut sit for a while, just as old as the ones that are in plugs, but they just been in in that same solution.
[01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:20.110]  And that aloe really just keeps all those enzymes keep those things just
[01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:27.950]  They have everything they still need. Apparently, you know, because I actually it's amazing if you take a cutting and I hate cutting things. It's like
[01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:40.950]  I actually make some flower arrangements out of it sometimes and it can take weeks like flowers die within no time at all. But if you and this is just plain water tap water, not just not with all you know though goodies, but
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:52.910]  Yeah, it's amazing how long they'll take. But yeah, so use try. Don't just stick to one thing. Try it, you know, or do it your way and then add it so you're not like, oh, I messed up and
[01:32:54.230 --> 01:33:03.310]  Now I've got to start over like, oh, well, that's not for me or. Oh, wow. These cuts are the most healthy and green. I'm not getting any fading. I'm not getting any yellowing
[01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:12.790]  They're perky. They're beautiful like they're putting off leaves already in the cube like things that I didn't see happening before, like, you know, I mean,
[01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:19.630]  And but sometimes the longest method is not the best method, depending on where you're taking the clone from on the plant and
[01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:27.270]  You know, I mean, sometimes you're better off waiting a little longer with a bigger stem to begin with. You get a much heartier thicker plant.
[01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:35.310]  You know, I mean, and these are all things that that you just kind of you get to because you need to connect with the plant and the plant will tell you what to do.
[01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:49.590]  And I'm on a perpetual grow, you know, I have like my flower tent my veg tent. So because I have to wait two months for one to finish and the other I take little clones because like you said, you know, if I took the big one like this.
[01:33:49.590 --> 01:34:07.630]  Well, two months later that things already too big to flower. But, you know, when I take the little ones. That's just how it works for me and they do root pretty easily. I did a test with a bunch of different methods just even plain water being one of them and everything rooted at a pretty similar
[01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:22.870]  Ratio just the like pure water just took a few days longer. So that's even some sort of crop steering. You could do, I guess, because crop steering is the hot word this year. We've moved on from terpenes and CBD. It's now crop steering.
[01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:30.070]  That's Brendan rust. He did a talk on that at the cannabinoid cultivation Academy crop biological club crops.
[01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:44.710]  And fair enough to him. I did see on the future cannabis project is over a year old his his crop steering episode. So he's been using it forever. You can get away with it. But yeah, if you just started saying crop steering you're like me.
[01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:55.310]  But back to the original question. Anything that you do differently in like the harvesting or curing process for something that you're gonna
[01:34:55.310 --> 01:35:12.910]  Just sticking to the kind of the 6060 kind of rule, keeping that trying to get that to be like 10 at least, you know, I mean, I guess it's a debatable. It depends on your space and your airflow and you don't want the airflow on directly on the plants, but
[01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:21.190]  I really think you need to have something at dry 10 to 14 days for you really to get all the nuances, all of the the
[01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:30.950]  Get the best bouquet from it that you know what I mean, like, I mean, we know that it's a lot about the gases and off gassing and and
[01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:40.990]  You know, the ethylene and stuff. But I mean, that's a little later in the burping of the jar to but like it's a process. It's not easy. Like I always tell people like
[01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:51.910]  Yeah, you grew amazing plant. You just ran half a marathon. Now you got the other half of the marathon to run in the dry in the cure. And so it's really
[01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:56.830]  I guess that's why I'm good at it because I'm a very detail oriented person. So you just got it, you know,
[01:35:57.630 --> 01:36:09.070]  Everybody can do it. It's a, you know, everybody should try and grow their own medicine. That's the word I really want to get out because it's not that hard. Don't be intimidated. We all start somewhere.
[01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:29.070]  Even if you go out and just get some fertilizer and say, you know, this is easy for me because this is what works in my space. I'm not going to hate, but I'm going to hopefully see you transition to into, you know, more because it's about biomimicry. Right. I mean, and how does that happen. I mean,
[01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:32.590]  I don't know. I just, I do go out.
[01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:33.710]  Yeah, I'm
[01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:41.910]  Yes, I'm, I don't want to sound religious about it. We all sound religious about it when we're in this camp. It's kind of like, but
[01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:52.270]  We we've experienced things that that you can't you can't explain their science and then there's the science of the unexplainable to and
[01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:54.310]  You can feel it, though. It's, you know,
[01:36:54.670 --> 01:37:08.590]  The results speak for themselves. And when you truly believe and see and feel that there is a better way you want to teach everybody you want to show everybody. So that's why I think sometimes people get passionate where I think it goes wrong is when they're like,
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:23.710]  You know, you're a horrible person because you grow with synthetics and you'll never grow good cannabis. Not true. 90% of the cannabis before the 90s was all synthetic and we had no complaints then. But my main thing is like first thing is like just grow just start growing just grow just grow just grow.
[01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:33.550]  And that's, you know, where, where your style and stuff comes in. But hey, if you can get ahead of the curve, yeah, if you could get ahead of the growing and then start to grow your business in a way that is, you know,
[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:37.910]  And if you're not, I guess that's what I need to get,
[01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:40.390]  because it's easier for me to move to Maine
[01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:43.750]  and try and live the dream than to stay here
[01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:44.830]  and fight it out.
[01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:46.630]  And the laws are so against,
[01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:49.510]  and is that, I am assuming that's the similar thing
[01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:51.310]  between Oregon and Washington,
[01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:53.150]  that you're saying you can't do it?
[01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:55.010]  Well, it's just the limited licenses.
[01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:57.750]  Washington had very limited licenses
[01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:59.570]  and they haven't been available.
[01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:02.350]  And even if there was one that,
[01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:06.530]  I mean, I could go buy one for like way too much money
[01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:07.650]  just to get in the game,
[01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:10.150]  to be squished by the larger people,
[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:12.130]  because there's no vertical integration here.
[01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:13.470]  I can't sell direct.
[01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:15.430]  I can't sell at a farm stand.
[01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:17.410]  Oregon's a little different.
[01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:19.410]  It's a little money to get into the game,
[01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:21.830]  but there's a lot more licenses available
[01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:24.310]  and you can do the farm stand type stuff
[01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:26.950]  if you're a small enough producer.
[01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:29.010]  And again, I'm not trying to take over the world, man.
[01:43:29.010 --> 01:43:30.150]  I'm just trying to improve it.
[01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:30.990]  So.
[01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.830]  Yeah, no.
[01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:34.650]  That's the deal.
[01:43:34.650 --> 01:43:36.230]  So I think similar things.
[01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:38.290]  It's like the state where I'm at is preventing it,
[01:43:38.290 --> 01:43:41.190]  but just a couple hours South of me.
[01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:43.890]  Yeah. Good deal.
[01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:47.270]  Yeah, even Vermont, they're doing it big up there.
[01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:50.350]  I met some wonderful people up in Vermont.
[01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:54.770]  Some people that went to the Gonjiar program.
[01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:56.590]  I don't know if it's the Vermont Gonjiar,
[01:43:56.590 --> 01:44:00.230]  Global Gonjiar, Stephanie and Rebel Dan
[01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:01.670]  is actually growing up there now.
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.750]  Apparently he's got his grow up there
[01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:05.590]  and I guess he's flying back and forth.
[01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:09.110]  I finally got to meet him, which was really cool.
[01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:10.990]  And then I come to find out he lived in Newton,
[01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.990]  which is right next to me.
[01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.830]  I'm like, what the hell?
[01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:15.230]  And then the private high school that I went to,
[01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:18.150]  of course it's like decade later or not, maybe.
[01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:19.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:22.190]  He was told me he went to the same place
[01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:24.950]  and I was like, this is crazy.
[01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:27.110]  And then I met Blue from Green Tank
[01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:30.030]  and I was like, oh yeah, you're up down East.
[01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:31.670]  And he's like, yeah.
[01:44:31.670 --> 01:44:33.350]  I was like, oh man, I go to Beale's Lobster Pot
[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:34.670]  in Southwest Harbor.
[01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.790]  He's like, that's my place right there.
[01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:38.150]  That's my jam.
[01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:39.310]  What the hell?
[01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:42.790]  It's kind of weird how,
[01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:44.230]  I mean, they're not maybe big connections,
[01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:45.430]  but it's just like, oh my God,
[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:48.270]  that's where I go with my aunt and uncle.
[01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:49.110]  That's your place.
[01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:51.310]  I've been in your place and didn't even know it.
[01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:52.150]  Small world, man.
[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:53.270]  So shout out to all those,
[01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:56.310]  everybody and there's so many that I can't even name.
[01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:58.910]  So many wonderful people I've met since.
[01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:01.430]  And me and Alex have been kind of going hard
[01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:02.750]  in this journey,
[01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:04.710]  going to all these events and trying to
[01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:08.790]  spread the good word and the good love.
[01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:12.550]  That's awesome, man.
[01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:17.270]  We're getting close to the two hour mark here.
[01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.350]  I don't even feel like, see,
[01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:22.150]  it just cruises by, huh?
[01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:23.910]  We haven't even like scratched the whole surface.
[01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:25.510]  I'm usually at home just listening
[01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:27.870]  to all these podcasts by myself,
[01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:30.350]  doing my thing, gardening,
[01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:32.710]  because the garden is really therapeutic too.
[01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:34.750]  It's good for physical health.
[01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:39.310]  I was moving seven gallons earlier.
[01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:41.590]  When you get big plants and you have a short ceiling,
[01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:43.830]  you have to do all this plant yoga.
[01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:44.670]  No.
[01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:47.630]  Because I still hand water
[01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:49.870]  because my space doesn't allow me to use the blue mat.
[01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:53.110]  I have used blue mat and they're awesome.
[01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:54.510]  I got to meet Michael Box too
[01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:56.230]  at one of the things I was wearing.
[01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:58.070]  I was wearing the Kiss Organics shirt.
[01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:59.270]  He's like, hey.
[01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:00.710]  And I got a blue mat hat
[01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:02.350]  and I got to chop it up with him.
[01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:05.870]  But definitely like now I'm starting to like,
[01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:07.910]  like, hey, I'm finally meeting all these people.
[01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:10.910]  Like I got to meet Eddie Lepp at the Harvest.
[01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:12.310]  Oh, thank God.
[01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:13.910]  So that was cool, man.
[01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:14.950]  That was awesome.
[01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:16.070]  And he told me some stories
[01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:17.830]  that I'll always have and cherish.
[01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:19.710]  So it's cool to hang out with him.
[01:46:19.710 --> 01:46:21.030]  A couple of days he was here
[01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:24.670]  and then I missed out ever seeing Frenchie,
[01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:27.750]  but we just did the Hashishin workshop
[01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:29.990]  in Long Island at Long Island Glass.
[01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:32.630]  It was awesome over there with Cherry Blossom Bell
[01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.070]  and Madam Cannoli.
[01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:35.230]  Thank you guys.
[01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.070]  But yeah.
[01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.910]  Man.
[01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:40.750]  That's cool.
[01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:41.590]  Let's show, yeah.
[01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:44.790]  Let me put you up here on the big screen there.
[01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:45.710]  Boom.
[01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:46.750]  Right on.
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:48.630]  Yeah, it's like driving a boat with a camera.
[01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:50.310]  If you want to go left, you got to move right.
[01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:53.310]  If you want to go right, you got to move left.
[01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:54.270]  I don't know, it's weird.
[01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:58.310]  But the trichome head, that's so cool, man.
[01:46:58.310 --> 01:47:02.750]  And this is kind of like a little known unknown thing,
[01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:07.390]  but Tad is going to have some pretty cool interviews
[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:09.830]  coming out here with both of those names
[01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:13.750]  that you just mentioned, obviously post-Humus.
[01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:15.710]  But yeah, there'll be some exciting things
[01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:19.190]  coming from a new Kiss Organics podcast soon
[01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:21.550]  that I helped work with.
[01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.390]  So that's exciting.
[01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:25.150]  But let's get back to that table, man.
[01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:27.950]  Now that I blew it up, I saw all the kind of fun things.
[01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:29.350]  Can we do a little show and tell?
[01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:31.950]  Like, grab something and tell us.
[01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:37.630]  Well, this is from the Dabadoo.
[01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:40.950]  This is the third place rosin.
[01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:43.950]  I just picked this one up.
[01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:48.270]  And Dabadoo, for anybody who isn't familiar with that,
[01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:50.870]  you've got to be familiar with Mila the Hash Queen.
[01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:53.950]  She is the Hash Queen for a reason.
[01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:59.950]  This is an event that she is highly involved with,
[01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:04.750]  I would say integral, integral, integral, integral,
[01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:07.630]  very important to that.
[01:48:07.630 --> 01:48:10.550]  So that's a huge honor sitting right there.
[01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:13.030]  She, yes, yes.
[01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:15.590]  Because that has so many judges in that,
[01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:17.830]  that everybody gets to judge on that.
[01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:19.350]  That's so, it's awesome.
[01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:22.470]  So that was cool because that was like,
[01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:24.030]  that was Flower Rosin.
[01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:29.030]  Then I guess just before that was the first time
[01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:34.110]  I won for the Squash Off, which is this Bobby,
[01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:37.750]  Bobby West Humphrey Stoner.
[01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:40.150]  Now, so where is the Squash Off take place?
[01:48:40.150 --> 01:48:42.110]  Maybe tell us a quick little bit about Squash Off.
[01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:43.350]  It's kind of like a traveling,
[01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:44.830]  he's got a really great event
[01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:49.230]  because you get to submit your entry with a fee.
[01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:52.390]  And they judge it right there in front of you.
[01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:57.390]  They squash it in Rosin Tech Press,
[01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:59.910]  which I started on long year, many years ago,
[01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:03.270]  just the similar to the Nug Smasher.
[01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:04.830]  Think Mug Smasher is a little.
[01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:08.910]  So does everybody just bring flour and then they do this?
[01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:12.390]  They bring flour, they enter it and then they squish it.
[01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:14.990]  And then they look under the microscope,
[01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:17.510]  like I have over here, like, you know,
[01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:20.670]  put it on the screen, look at the trichromes,
[01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:24.390]  give every, all the judges smell it.
[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:28.830]  And then they squish it, then they smell it,
[01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:29.790]  then they dab it.
[01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.150]  And then the winner's chosen.
[01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:33.350]  And it's all right there in front of you.
[01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:36.590]  So you get to hear them critique it, right there.
[01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:40.550]  So it's, you know, real, lots of transparency because,
[01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:42.990]  which is kind of cool.
[01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:46.790]  And yeah, so that's an event
[01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:48.990]  that I wasn't really even aware of.
[01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:51.830]  I think I heard it on the Adam Dunn Show one time.
[01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:55.830]  And then I heard about it from,
[01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:59.950]  like that they were gonna do it at the Freedom Rally.
[01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:02.790]  So I was like, all right, I'm gonna try that, you know?
[01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:06.150]  By then I finally did get to get a joint
[01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:08.590]  into Danny Danko's hands and he smoked it
[01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:11.750]  with Hoda Erb in a slip for the first time.
[01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:14.830]  Like, I was like, here, roll this.
[01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:17.910]  And it was another guy, 508 Valley Gardens,
[01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:20.350]  I believe his name is Drew.
[01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:21.950]  We were all in the circle together
[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:24.830]  and someone, Sweet Leaf Nutrients, I forgot,
[01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:27.270]  other Danny Danko's friend there, I forgot.
[01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:29.510]  But yeah, so that was like,
[01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:30.790]  and I didn't even know it was him.
[01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.230]  I was like, hey, roll this.
[01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:33.830]  I just wanted to share my herb.
[01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:36.550]  I just wanted to be like, hey, this is,
[01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:38.190]  I think I have something good here.
[01:50:38.190 --> 01:50:40.310]  You know, like I want to get you guys.
[01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:41.310]  I want to do it up.
[01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:42.150]  Like, you know?
[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:45.390]  And then in the circle, and you know,
[01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:48.230]  I'm not the best, but it definitely,
[01:50:48.230 --> 01:50:53.030]  they were, you know, they definitely gave me a good review.
[01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:55.910]  Even saw him the next day and he was like,
[01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:58.670]  that was some of the best stuff I've smoked this weekend.
[01:50:58.670 --> 01:50:59.710]  I was like, okay, cool.
[01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:00.990]  That's awesome.
[01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:03.430]  But, and I don't want to take words out of his mouth.
[01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:04.270]  So I don't really,
[01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:06.350]  we're not like in correspondence or anything,
[01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:07.190]  but I've seen him in other shows.
[01:51:07.190 --> 01:51:09.710]  Yeah, but still, man, that's fucking cool.
[01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:13.110]  I got his book for many people signed by him, you know?
[01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:16.270]  I got his book signed, right?
[01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:18.470]  I got, it's like five feet behind me, man.
[01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:19.310]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:20.150]  Yeah, yeah, no, man.
[01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:21.750]  I've, you know, I've seen it a few times.
[01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:24.310]  I mean, you had Jorge Cervantes on.
[01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.230]  I'm just like, what?
[01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:26.150]  This is crazy.
[01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:27.110]  What, I'm on this show?
[01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:28.110]  No way.
[01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:30.710]  JJ Top Dog, like all these people,
[01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:32.950]  you had Masonic, you had other people
[01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:34.310]  that are doing it big, you know?
[01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:37.110]  It's just like, it's awesome because I, you know,
[01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:38.710]  I know I have skills.
[01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:41.470]  So it's just, I want to finally showcase
[01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:43.070]  what I can really do.
[01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:48.070]  And, you know, and it's, it can always elevate.
[01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:50.630]  You can always, there's so many different things
[01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:51.910]  that you can do.
[01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:53.750]  There's so much to learn.
[01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:57.350]  And there's so many, the people,
[01:51:57.350 --> 01:52:00.510]  there's so many wonderful people about this master plan.
[01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:04.270]  Those are the people that are, their hearts are gold.
[01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:06.990]  So you'll know when you meet them.
[01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:09.830]  This industry is, in the beginning,
[01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:11.750]  I just wanted to have friends.
[01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:16.230]  Now I want to, you know, I want the people that are,
[01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:19.830]  you know, the people that, you know,
[01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:21.870]  it's, I don't know, it's kind of just weird.
[01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:24.630]  You gotta be around people that inspire you
[01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:27.110]  and that want to advance with you.
[01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:28.270]  You can't get stuck.
[01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:29.470]  And we all have different goals.
[01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:30.310]  That's great.
[01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:32.990]  I'm not, you know, but like my goal is to connect
[01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:35.470]  with the people like, you know,
[01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:39.430]  that are trying to also grow vegetables and other things.
[01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:41.750]  And that's why I try to shout out to Kobe,
[01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:44.630]  Kobe guy, who's, you know,
[01:52:44.630 --> 01:52:47.110]  cause he just grows awesome vegetables,
[01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:50.630]  but he grows amazing cannabis too, I'm sure for himself.
[01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.430]  I don't think, you know what I mean?
[01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:54.910]  That's like, there's even people making, like,
[01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:56.270]  I don't know, like even Kevin Jodery
[01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:58.310]  was going to let his farm sit farrow or something.
[01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:59.750]  People, times are hard.
[01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:03.270]  Like it's, if you can grow something else
[01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:05.150]  that can bring in some income,
[01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:06.950]  because you're probably going to grow
[01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:11.190]  some incredible vegetables too with these methodologies.
[01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:12.430]  So.
[01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:14.470]  Yeah, just even to help people out too.
[01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:16.630]  Like I basically, you know,
[01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:18.390]  the neighbors always have offers.
[01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:19.950]  I've got one neighbor with chicken.
[01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:21.670]  So, you know, we get eggs from them
[01:53:21.670 --> 01:53:23.150]  and we give them veggies, but you know,
[01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:26.070]  a lot of times I'm basically growing for the food bank.
[01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:27.790]  I'm totally fine with that, man.
[01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:28.870]  That's cool.
[01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:32.310]  Let's get some good stuff in people's hands.
[01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:34.910]  That's, you're inspiring me even more, bro.
[01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:35.790]  That's awesome.
[01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:37.710]  That is awesome because that's what it's about.
[01:53:37.710 --> 01:53:38.550]  It's what it's about.
[01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:42.710]  It's about, you know, connecting in a deeper way.
[01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:46.030]  Cause we're just, the world needs more love.
[01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.870]  Yes.
[01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:47.710]  It really does.
[01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:48.550]  It does.
[01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:51.670]  It's like, and if our food isn't medicine,
[01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:55.190]  then we're not going to be in a loving mood
[01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:57.750]  because we're going to, our biome's going to be all messed up
[01:53:58.510 --> 01:54:03.510]  and you know, that changes our whole demeanor.
[01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:05.390]  It does.
[01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:07.230]  And it's, you know, the older I get,
[01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:08.350]  the more I've noticed it.
[01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:10.950]  Maybe I was just iron stomach as a kid,
[01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:14.190]  or, you know, I didn't feel it in my like teens and twenties
[01:54:14.190 --> 01:54:18.950]  but the way that I eat does actually affect my mood now.
[01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:22.070]  Like I see the real connection between it.
[01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:24.470]  If I eat like a bunch of like processed meats or something
[01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:26.470]  or like, you know, I'll eat fast food every now and then.
[01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:30.430]  I'd love to have some salami or like a Italian sub.
[01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:34.510]  But in the morning I'm like dehydrated, all that sodium.
[01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:36.510]  And I just don't, I don't feel ill.
[01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:39.310]  I'm like, oh, was it worth eating that?
[01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:40.950]  But I think as we get older,
[01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:42.910]  because it is bioaccumulation, right?
[01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:43.750]  I mean.
[01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:44.590]  Right.
[01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:45.430]  There we go.
[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:46.270]  That's the answer, I guess.
[01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.750]  That would be the answer because.
[01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:48.590]  Yeah.
[01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:50.350]  I mean, we get to a point where our body's already like,
[01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:51.750]  oh, we're at a toxic level.
[01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.950]  So now that just little bit tips it
[01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:57.590]  or even tips it to set off that immune disease
[01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:59.990]  that's just dormant that now is triggered
[01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:01.470]  because it's stressed.
[01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:03.270]  And it'll make me moody too.
[01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:04.510]  Some of the foods I eat,
[01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:06.430]  I'll realize that I have like a shorter
[01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:10.350]  or I'll get frustrated or like angry or easier.
[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:13.030]  And that's probably because my gut is actually in pain.
[01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:15.190]  And that's something that I've always dealt with.
[01:55:15.190 --> 01:55:16.710]  And you know, it's like when you're in pain,
[01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.150]  you definitely have a shorter fuse
[01:55:18.150 --> 01:55:20.830]  because it's like, do you really?
[01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:22.150]  Like, you know, it's like,
[01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:24.070]  it's so hard to explain to somebody
[01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:26.390]  who doesn't know what chronic pain is.
[01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:28.350]  It's like when somebody comes up to you
[01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:30.070]  and complains about like, I don't know,
[01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.230]  they're fricking, I don't know.
[01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:34.390]  Oh, my hat got sun bleached.
[01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:35.390]  It's like, what the fuck?
[01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:36.550]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:37.670]  Tangent number two.
[01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:38.510]  Okay.
[01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:39.350]  Tangent number two.
[01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:40.270]  Yeah.
[01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:41.110]  Yeah.
[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:45.390]  Well, there's so many stomach ailments
[01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:48.150]  that can be helped by, you know,
[01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:50.910]  like all the receptors that are in our stomach,
[01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:55.910]  like Crohn's disease and all these other, you know,
[01:55:56.910 --> 01:56:01.910]  I'm actually taking Dr. Uma to heart, to hemp hearts.
[01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:08.950]  So I try and get them in my diet every day.
[01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:11.470]  And I think it really helps my mood.
[01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:16.430]  I'm not, I've toyed with doing like the daily
[01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:17.550]  mushroom blend mix.
[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:18.430]  I think that's good.
[01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:21.110]  Not any, you know, psychedelic,
[01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:25.510]  but just like all those good stuff for neuroplasticity
[01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:27.670]  and genesis and everything.
[01:56:27.670 --> 01:56:28.510]  I love that.
[01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:29.350]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:30.190]  Yeah.
[01:56:30.190 --> 01:56:31.230]  I mean, they can do that.
[01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:32.110]  Like, I think that's it.
[01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:34.510]  Like, yeah, that's a whole nother,
[01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:37.390]  I learned so much from those guys too.
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:41.990]  Just learning about, trying to benefit the plant.
[01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:44.590]  It's like, you learn so much to benefit yourself.
[01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:47.270]  Or how everything relates.
[01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:48.830]  It's just, yeah.
[01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:51.830]  It's so, and then afterwards it's like, what?
[01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:55.710]  No wonder we're all dying from diseases or like, you know,
[01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:57.830]  like, I don't know, it's crazy.
[01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:58.670]  Yeah.
[01:56:58.670 --> 01:57:02.470]  When you put that one-on-one together and, you know,
[01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:04.470]  earlier I was like, oh, I'll pull the grenade.
[01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:07.470]  The conflict bomb is, you know, all these pesticides.
[01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:09.710]  I started talking about glyphosate at the time
[01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:12.110]  and didn't get to my original point, which was the bomb.
[01:57:12.110 --> 01:57:14.670]  But, you know, we were talking earlier that too,
[01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:16.630]  that, you know, people are developing allergies
[01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:18.110]  or developing these issues.
[01:57:18.110 --> 01:57:20.670]  I kind of almost want to link the rise of autism
[01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:23.630]  to the use of chemicals in our food.
[01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:26.510]  There is somewhat of a loose correlation
[01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:28.750]  that I would love to dive deeper into,
[01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:32.270]  but I, in my brain of brains,
[01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:34.670]  think there is a connection somewhere there.
[01:57:34.670 --> 01:57:37.270]  So sorry if I offended anybody, hopefully.
[01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:38.430]  I don't know, whatever.
[01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:41.950]  Well, we don't know how things affect us
[01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:43.630]  because it is this, like,
[01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:46.790]  and everybody has their own tolerance level, I'm sure.
[01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:49.950]  So not everybody, somebody might be able to body accumulate
[01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:51.230]  more than someone else.
[01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:52.630]  Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.
[01:57:52.630 --> 01:57:54.630]  And I'm sure that is the case.
[01:57:54.630 --> 01:57:57.350]  Or their bodies, like, whatever it's genetics to,
[01:57:57.350 --> 01:58:00.470]  like stronger or what, yeah.
[01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:03.110]  I've drank enough Mountain Dew to kill a mule.
[01:58:03.110 --> 01:58:06.470]  So yes, I don't drink that stuff anymore
[01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:09.110]  because it actually, that's one of those ones that,
[01:58:09.110 --> 01:58:10.150]  now that I don't drink it,
[01:58:10.150 --> 01:58:13.150]  if I do go back to having like a can,
[01:58:13.150 --> 01:58:14.590]  I can't even finish the whole can
[01:58:14.590 --> 01:58:17.310]  because my body already feels like just crap.
[01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:20.550]  I'm like, ooh, I used to drink these every day.
[01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:22.750]  Me too, like we used to get the two liters
[01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:25.310]  and like, I'm a diabetic for the past 25 years.
[01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:28.270]  So I started drinking diet soda,
[01:58:28.270 --> 01:58:31.670]  but to find out that actually diet soda is actually worse,
[01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:34.710]  I mean, not for my diabetes, but for my body as a whole,
[01:58:34.710 --> 01:58:37.870]  because I guess there was like tests showing
[01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:39.150]  that the laboratory rats
[01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:42.710]  or whatever the laboratory animals that they were using
[01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:45.750]  were actually getting more lethargic and obese
[01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:48.510]  from the saccharin or from the whatever,
[01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:52.590]  or NutraSweet or whatever was in the,
[01:58:52.590 --> 01:58:55.230]  and then it messed up their bodies
[01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:57.590]  because it wasn't a sugar that our bodies,
[01:58:57.590 --> 01:58:59.830]  they figured out that it's basically not a sugar
[01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:01.550]  our bodies actually identify.
[01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:05.830]  So we eat more and it messes up our whole metabolism.
[01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:08.830]  And then actually, so yeah, man,
[01:59:09.670 --> 01:59:11.870]  it's like, I don't know if I,
[01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:16.030]  I don't know who to quote or who to cite on that, but I'm.
[01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:19.670]  Yeah, no, we feel like, I can smell what you're cooking.
[01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:23.470]  Oh, shoot.
[01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:25.670]  Well, let's real quick too,
[01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:28.350]  you showed me a couple earlier ones,
[01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:32.310]  the number one and the number two place from the squash shop.
[01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:34.310]  Those were pretty cool little trophies, man.
[01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:37.750]  Can you maybe tell us about what that event was like
[01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:41.430]  and then who you're with and when they calling your name,
[01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:44.990]  like I've never entered, let alone won anything.
[01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:46.950]  So that's pretty cool, man.
[01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:48.310]  I'd love to hear about it.
[01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:52.550]  I'm definitely a shout out to Uncle Stoner, Bobby West,
[01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:57.550]  his shirt over here, but he's, yeah, man, he's a real deal.
[01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:59.790]  He's got the legends jacket.
[01:59:59.790 --> 02:00:02.350]  They just gave him an Amsterdam just recently.
[02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:03.190]  Oh, shit.
[02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:04.030]  Okay.
[02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:07.270]  Yeah, so he's a proud honoree.
[02:00:07.710 --> 02:00:08.550]  Yeah.
[02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:12.590]  Yeah, the legends, man, that was a bulldog.
[02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:17.590]  So this was, yeah, it was during the Abidoo,
[02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:19.990]  during that January, whatever.
[02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:26.310]  But yeah, man, him and Deb, shout out to them.
[02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:28.390]  They're awesome people.
[02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:32.190]  And I really appreciate, you know,
[02:00:32.190 --> 02:00:33.470]  I can't wait for the next one
[02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:34.870]  cause I'll probably be entering it.
[02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:36.430]  This one supposedly glows in the dark.
[02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:37.910]  This is second place.
[02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:38.750]  Wow, look at that.
[02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:39.750]  And this is for the two Finos
[02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:41.710]  that I have of the 818 headband.
[02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:45.110]  Yeah, this one's got some weight to it.
[02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:45.950]  I like it.
[02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:46.790]  Yeah.
[02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:49.990]  But this supposedly glows in the dark, he told me.
[02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:52.230]  Flava, flava, eat your heart out.
[02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:54.190]  No, look, cause now I know it's,
[02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:56.670]  well, this is slate glass.
[02:00:56.670 --> 02:00:58.910]  This was the third place flower
[02:00:58.910 --> 02:01:02.070]  for the Harvest Commonwealth Cup.
[02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:05.350]  Which was, that was on 521.
[02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:08.550]  This was on 420.
[02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:12.750]  Wow, man, this year has just been a phenomenal year for you.
[02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:17.750]  And this was in November and this was in January.
[02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:19.590]  Wow.
[02:01:19.590 --> 02:01:24.590]  So, yeah, manifest, manifest.
[02:01:24.630 --> 02:01:25.470]  Yep.
[02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:27.950]  The ball is rolling.
[02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:29.790]  The ball is rolling.
[02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:32.950]  Yeah, and so, and we'll see,
[02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:34.190]  hopefully we're gonna get,
[02:01:34.190 --> 02:01:36.310]  and the chef's got some stuff in.
[02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:39.430]  My friend, Chef Alex got his gummies, I believe,
[02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:42.710]  into the Freedom Cup coming up in the,
[02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:47.790]  at the smoke out or the sit in at the Freedom Rally
[02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:51.630]  in Boston, I believe that's September.
[02:01:51.630 --> 02:01:52.550]  Is it September?
[02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:54.630]  Yes, I think it's September.
[02:01:54.630 --> 02:01:55.750]  I should know that.
[02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:58.110]  I missed out on some other really good events though,
[02:01:58.110 --> 02:02:02.270]  where they do like a cup,
[02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:04.750]  what is it?
[02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:08.230]  You just had Ben Morgan Dillon on the other day,
[02:02:08.230 --> 02:02:11.670]  or at least they had him on the Living Soil Conversations.
[02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:13.550]  Yeah, right.
[02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:15.870]  I believe he was doing some intake for the,
[02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:17.550]  is it Pheno?
[02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:19.070]  It's not Pheno Cup, that's something else.
[02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:22.470]  It's the, oh man, I missed out on it.
[02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:24.630]  If anybody in chat knows, anybody in chat,
[02:02:25.630 --> 02:02:30.630]  it was the grow off, the grow off.
[02:02:31.230 --> 02:02:32.790]  So you get cuts.
[02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:34.110]  Okay, I like that.
[02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:37.070]  And it was cool because I wanted to participate in that,
[02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:40.830]  but I think I was actually at the Hashishin Workshop
[02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:42.550]  that day in Long Island,
[02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:46.190]  which is four hours from where I am doing,
[02:02:46.190 --> 02:02:47.310]  hanging there.
[02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:49.190]  And then we went from there to the Vermont
[02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:50.990]  on the second day for the Vermont,
[02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:53.470]  New England Cannabis Convention.
[02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:57.390]  The Vermont Me Can drove from there to there.
[02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:59.070]  So we kind of did this little pilgrimage.
[02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:00.990]  We've been hitting the streets,
[02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:04.270]  no, we've been traveling a lot, but it's awesome.
[02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:07.030]  Meeting a lot of wonderful, wonderful people along the way.
[02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:12.030]  Really this, we're gonna, if we all band together,
[02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:17.470]  and we're gonna do this,
[02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:20.510]  they will survive.
[02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:22.470]  It's easy for me to say,
[02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:27.470]  but I wanna participate and I'm sick of not
[02:03:33.190 --> 02:03:34.350]  participating bigger.
[02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:37.550]  I wanna just really participate and make a difference.
[02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:41.230]  And I just stuttered a little bit.
[02:03:42.670 --> 02:03:45.190]  Yeah, there's so many emotions because it's weird.
[02:03:45.190 --> 02:03:46.030]  People are like,
[02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:47.670]  how can you be so passionate about the plant?
[02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:49.870]  It's like, cause it does so much for me
[02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:51.470]  in so many ways.
[02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:56.470]  So it's kind of people, some people don't,
[02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:00.270]  it's dedication too.
[02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:04.510]  So that's another part of making the best quality
[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:06.550]  that you can, handling it,
[02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:09.470]  not letting it smash around in a bag,
[02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:11.830]  not getting it electrostatically,
[02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:15.670]  trichromes structured or stripped.
[02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:17.470]  And if you really wanna even get down to it,
[02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:20.110]  and I have to give the shout out to DC Scrogger
[02:04:20.110 --> 02:04:22.750]  for telling me, when you take that bud,
[02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:25.470]  you manicure it and you don't fully manicure it,
[02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:27.830]  just like Kyle Cushman likes to have his nicely,
[02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:32.830]  roughly manicured buds to peel those sugar leaves off
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:36.070]  before smoking and keep all those good crystals there,
[02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:38.550]  all the capitulate glands or whatever.
[02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:43.550]  But you put it in a piece of like foam
[02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:47.350]  and then you put it in a glass and you put it in the stock
[02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:49.070]  and it doesn't touch anything.
[02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:50.830]  And that's how you really should,
[02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:53.190]  if you're gonna respect, so if you,
[02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:56.710]  that's like, when I heard that, I was like, yeah, I get it.
[02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:58.230]  And one of my buddies was like,
[02:04:58.230 --> 02:04:59.790]  what are you talking about?
[02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:02.910]  Cause he's like, no, and if it's all messed up,
[02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:05.630]  I'm not like, you're already medically disqualified.
[02:05:05.630 --> 02:05:06.910]  Like, that's just the way it is.
[02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:09.110]  Like you didn't respect the plant.
[02:05:09.110 --> 02:05:11.910]  You didn't like, that is taking it to another level.
[02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:14.750]  But if you want to shine and the judges to look at that
[02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:16.950]  and be like, Ooh, wow.
[02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:18.430]  If it's all stocks and no heads.
[02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:21.990]  And it's not adulterated, it's not been kicked around
[02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:25.030]  in a C vault or a bag or in a jar.
[02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:26.750]  And you know what I mean?
[02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:30.990]  It's, you know, so if you're gonna do an entry,
[02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:35.350]  you kind of have to like, that's probably only,
[02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:38.230]  it depends on who's doing the scoring and what the event is
[02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:39.750]  and what they're voting on.
[02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:42.870]  But like that might be the difference
[02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:46.150]  of between first and second or second and third
[02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:48.270]  is just how you present it.
[02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:49.110]  You know what I mean?
[02:05:49.110 --> 02:05:50.670]  Like, I don't know.
[02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:53.270]  When you put that much into growing something
[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:55.990]  and all that time and all these extra things
[02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:58.870]  to try and make that medicine as wholesome
[02:05:58.870 --> 02:06:03.350]  and perfect as possible, you can't cut any corners.
[02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:05.830]  You have to do that throughout the whole process.
[02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:07.590]  Yeah.
[02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:10.590]  There's been a few growers who have really highlighted
[02:06:10.590 --> 02:06:13.670]  the fact of like, don't ever touch your buds.
[02:06:14.150 --> 02:06:16.510]  Whether it'd be like, while you're growing it,
[02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:17.910]  don't walk in there and,
[02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.750]  oh yeah, this one smells good tonight.
[02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:20.670]  Yeah, smell that.
[02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:23.190]  Like, it's tempting, we all want to, but you're killing it.
[02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:24.910]  Unless that's the one you're gonna take off
[02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:26.470]  and then you're gonna do the test squish
[02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:29.350]  to see how that rosin squishes off of that bud.
[02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:31.310]  No, I'll do that.
[02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:32.790]  I will take stuff off the plant
[02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:35.030]  just to see what the next stuff is coming.
[02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:37.950]  Cause I got this, I brought back the double tangy banana.
[02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:39.350]  I wanna see if that's gonna,
[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:42.310]  cause everybody wants fruit and all this,
[02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:46.070]  bananas and tangies and maybe it's a marvelous plant,
[02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:49.030]  but I had the, that's Crockett DNA, whatever.
[02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:50.550]  I had that pack.
[02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:52.150]  I have so many things.
[02:06:52.150 --> 02:06:55.030]  I'm excited about some stuff I just popped though.
[02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:58.150]  I popped the double OG Chem, Rebel Dan.
[02:06:58.150 --> 02:07:03.150]  I popped some of the Soda Project,
[02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:06.630]  which is like the Mean Gene and Dutch collab.
[02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:09.710]  What we got the shirts for, which was from the region.
[02:07:09.710 --> 02:07:10.830]  I have a few of those going.
[02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:13.270]  Cause I can't, I thought I need more space
[02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:15.750]  so I can really do these really, really fine phenos
[02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.150]  that I wanna find.
[02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:20.230]  But it's like, and then I popped some old stuff
[02:07:20.230 --> 02:07:23.030]  from Bodhi, the Cocoon,
[02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:24.630]  because that has that Lumpa headband
[02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:27.470]  crossed to the Wookiee 15.
[02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:30.070]  And Turpinado, I just ran Turpinado
[02:07:30.070 --> 02:07:31.950]  and it was actually Rebel Dan that was like,
[02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:34.590]  this is, he liked my green pheno, which is my medicine.
[02:07:34.590 --> 02:07:36.350]  So I was really happy to hear that.
[02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:38.590]  I was like, yeah, you like that gas.
[02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:40.750]  And then he's like, but this second one,
[02:07:41.630 --> 02:07:42.590]  and it happened to be the Turpinado.
[02:07:42.590 --> 02:07:45.350]  So when I said, oh shit, the headband to the Wookiee
[02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:46.950]  and the Wookiee is a really stinky,
[02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:49.230]  turpy strain as far as I know.
[02:07:50.670 --> 02:07:53.910]  And so I'm excited for that.
[02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:57.150]  And then also, what is it?
[02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:59.870]  Is it Mean Mug or something else from Dutch?
[02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:01.710]  Something else from Dutch.
[02:08:01.710 --> 02:08:04.750]  But yeah, and yeah.
[02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:07.110]  And the other thing is we, I wanna,
[02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:11.590]  we, I want to pop these, I just don't have,
[02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:16.030]  and we're gonna have to set up to do that,
[02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:19.030]  but Kevin Jodery gave out people some special seeds
[02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:22.150]  and I'm just hankering to pop those.
[02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:24.470]  I'm really am, I just don't have the room
[02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:26.790]  and I need to do them all at once.
[02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:28.630]  And I also need to make F1s from them
[02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:30.030]  because they're special.
[02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:34.790]  So it's a lot of work and that's why I haven't undertaken it
[02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:38.110]  but those are definitely on the list to pack those,
[02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:43.110]  the Gosney from rotting flesh to,
[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:46.430]  from fruit to rotting flesh decaying, whatever.
[02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:47.710]  That's awesome, yeah.
[02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:48.550]  Marvelous.
[02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:50.910]  Covering it, cover it all.
[02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:53.070]  He's, yeah, Jodery's got,
[02:08:53.070 --> 02:08:55.070]  I think he was working on a skunk project too
[02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:57.070]  or at least trying to go through some of the older stuff
[02:08:57.070 --> 02:08:58.670]  and see what he could find, so.
[02:08:58.670 --> 02:09:01.430]  Right, because he talked about that before BC,
[02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:06.110]  before carbon, all these skunk strains got eradicated.
[02:09:06.110 --> 02:09:08.630]  I'm almost as old as him or I might be as, I don't know,
[02:09:08.630 --> 02:09:12.590]  but I only know this because I've been following him
[02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:14.790]  and he's been so influential in my journey
[02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:19.070]  and really part of,
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:24.630]  part of the reason I can do what I do
[02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:28.430]  is following all these wonderful mentors.
[02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:31.230]  So I listen to him when he talks
[02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:34.470]  and I've been following him for a long, long time
[02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:35.950]  and I wouldn't even know half of the people
[02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:38.750]  if he didn't do like the meet the breeders
[02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:41.590]  but I definitely wanna, you know,
[02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:42.910]  and that's something me, Chef,
[02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:46.830]  and another friend of ours, Joe Gattis,
[02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:50.310]  we're gonna be, I don't know if you should, but whatever.
[02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:51.430]  They're Green Love Organics.
[02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:56.230]  They got, they're doing some auto flower breeding
[02:09:56.230 --> 02:10:01.230]  and yeah, man, there's, so we're just trying to get our,
[02:10:01.590 --> 02:10:04.710]  we've got a bunch of, there's so many people.
[02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:07.430]  It's, there's a lot of talented people out East.
[02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:10.790]  So you're gonna be hearing from a lot of them.
[02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:12.070]  Yes. Definitely.
[02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.390]  I'm excited, man.
[02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:15.510]  And it's cool to see, you know,
[02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:18.710]  kind of that fresh excitement as well.
[02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:20.790]  It's been over 10 years on the West Coast
[02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:22.510]  since we've done the thing here,
[02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:25.310]  but to see legalization just coming to a lot of these,
[02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:28.790]  you know, East Coast states is rad
[02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:31.910]  because I've met more than a couple of people like yourself
[02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:36.910]  who they weren't comfortable being exposed before.
[02:10:37.710 --> 02:10:39.110]  And now that they are, you know,
[02:10:39.110 --> 02:10:41.650]  obviously we always have that in the back of our brain,
[02:10:41.650 --> 02:10:44.550]  but they're getting out, they've got great information
[02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:46.650]  and they're making a difference like yourself.
[02:10:46.650 --> 02:10:48.310]  So I'm glad that that's happening.
[02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:50.290]  And I'm just, I'm just a cog in the wheel
[02:10:50.290 --> 02:10:51.630]  passing along the information
[02:10:51.630 --> 02:10:53.230]  from all those other great minds
[02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:57.510]  that I've been so sponge, you know,
[02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:59.370]  just soaking up all that knowledge.
[02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:03.070]  Yeah. And Kevin, I mean, Kevin Jodry has been a huge one,
[02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:05.470]  a future cannabis project, those breeder panels,
[02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:07.070]  those things, those dudes that got me hooked.
[02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:09.170]  I've watched those for hours every day.
[02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:10.870]  Yep. Yeah.
[02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:13.450]  Just a lot of free resources out there.
[02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:14.950]  Like, I remember it was so surreal.
[02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:17.150]  I was there with Alex and talking and we're,
[02:11:17.150 --> 02:11:18.950]  and he was like, and velocity.
[02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:20.310]  And I was like, remember Alex,
[02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:21.350]  I told you about velocity.
[02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:22.230]  It needs to have,
[02:11:22.230 --> 02:11:23.950]  like, that's why you kind of have to have something
[02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:26.270]  that's current, something that's a staple,
[02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.790]  something that fills all those four flavors
[02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:31.070]  like we talked about, or, you know,
[02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:33.350]  you can't just put all your eggs in one basket.
[02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:34.590]  And I've been, and I heard about this
[02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:36.190]  like five, six years ago.
[02:11:36.190 --> 02:11:38.350]  So it was kind of surreal to be there and be like,
[02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:40.990]  oh my God, like, yeah, didn't I tell you about that?
[02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:42.270]  Like, didn't I tell you about that?
[02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:44.430]  Cause like when I get talking to people sometimes
[02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:46.430]  they're like, well, you know a lot about like,
[02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:48.350]  it's like, yeah, I guess I am spending,
[02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:49.670]  even though I'm not like on social,
[02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:52.830]  finally have social media, IG since November.
[02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:54.750]  I've only had IG since November
[02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:56.150]  and I don't even use my Facebook.
[02:11:56.150 --> 02:11:58.230]  I only use that to talk to my girlfriend
[02:11:58.230 --> 02:12:00.670]  when she's in Brazil on the FaceTime or whatever,
[02:12:00.670 --> 02:12:01.950]  or WhatsApp.
[02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:03.990]  So I don't really use any of that social media.
[02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:06.150]  So I'm definitely out of my element.
[02:12:06.150 --> 02:12:08.150]  And I realized it's really,
[02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:09.630]  it's been what's been holding me back
[02:12:09.630 --> 02:12:12.510]  from connecting with marvelous, wonderful growers
[02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:14.990]  like yourself and all these other people.
[02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:18.630]  And that I can't just not put myself,
[02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:19.950]  I may be putting myself on blast,
[02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:22.150]  but like it now it's like,
[02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:24.670]  it's like, I wanna,
[02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:29.910]  I got your Instagram.
[02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:30.750]  Do my part.
[02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:33.070]  I wanna find my lane,
[02:12:33.070 --> 02:12:35.550]  like I wanna help other people too.
[02:12:35.550 --> 02:12:40.550]  Like I definitely wanna be part of a team,
[02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:43.550]  a movement, a revolution.
[02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:44.630]  Educate and elevate.
[02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:45.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:47.470]  They're doing it everywhere.
[02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:48.310]  It's amazing.
[02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:50.350]  And my shout out to all the people,
[02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:51.750]  all these places that I've been attending
[02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:55.350]  and learning from, it's invaluable.
[02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:57.630]  And also the connections you make
[02:12:57.630 --> 02:12:59.510]  going to those events as well.
[02:12:59.510 --> 02:13:02.150]  You're gonna probably make some lifelong friends.
[02:13:02.150 --> 02:13:02.990]  You know what I mean?
[02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:05.270]  Or at very least some session buddies, right?
[02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:06.110]  No.
[02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:10.830]  You'll smoke some really good smoke.
[02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:13.430]  Yes, that's at the minimum.
[02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:15.230]  Shoot.
[02:13:16.150 --> 02:13:17.230]  That's awesome, man.
[02:13:18.630 --> 02:13:22.550]  A couple of things that I always like to do before we go.
[02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:25.230]  I wanna let you give some shout outs
[02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.350]  because there's been some good people
[02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:27.710]  that have helped you along the way
[02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:29.750]  and have inspired you and keep inspiring you.
[02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:31.310]  So I want you to be able to do that.
[02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:32.590]  But first one thing,
[02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:34.590]  and the answer sometimes is no,
[02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:37.950]  but is there anything that you wanted to talk about today
[02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:39.510]  that I didn't ask you about
[02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:42.510]  or something that you just feel everybody should hear or know?
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.680]  We've covered a lot of ground, but.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.520]  Yeah, no.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.400]  I have the gift of gab.
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.520]  Even when I know that I just can't help it,
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:56.480]  it's the passion.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:59.520]  It's infectious, man.
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.240]  It's infectious.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:02.080]  Definitely.
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.640]  So I think we've covered a lot of things thoroughly.
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:07.760]  And I know I went off on many tangents,
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:12.760]  but I'm definitely a disciple of this plant.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.200]  It's definitely my spirit guide.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.640]  And, well, I used to have that up there,
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:20.960]  but I couldn't fit it up in the IG.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.000]  I put master plant disciple,
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  because that's kind of how I feel
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.080]  because I am very religious about it.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:28.520]  And good or bad, I don't know.
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.040]  I just starting to believe things.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.040]  And I just wanna teach this way of doing it.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.120]  There's so many ways to do it.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.160]  And I'm not saying there's a wrong way or a right way.
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.960]  I'm just saying, try and do it as.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.400]  Yeah.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:49.120]  You found something good for yourself.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:49.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.360]  And you feel it could be good for others.
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:52.840]  So why not share that?
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:53.680]  Why not share that knowledge?
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:55.680]  I start off with rockwool,
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.240]  and I just never could get the terps
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.240]  and the expression that I wanted.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:01.560]  And I've tried many lines of things,
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.800]  and it just seemed like, oh, wait, what?
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:06.640]  This is like, and everybody's like, oh.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:09.560]  Like every time I talk to people, it's like, it's not me.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.680]  It's the soil.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:11.880]  It's not me.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:13.960]  It's the genetics and the soil.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:15.240]  I'm just the steward.
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.760]  I'm just taking care of it.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.280]  But if you're attentive and you listen,
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.960]  and I mean, by watching and observing,
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.400]  we can learn marvelous things that we wouldn't
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:29.520]  if we're just in there.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.960]  And I guess what I wanna say is
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.760]  don't abuse your plants either.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:35.800]  Like I know everybody wants to rip all these leaves off
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.680]  and everything, but I'm more like on Gangesana
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.080]  with like, say a prayer before you go in there,
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:42.800]  center yourself.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:45.840]  They know the energy that you are having.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:48.280]  This is true.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:50.800]  It's true.
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:54.040]  You go in there and they know you're there.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.200]  So if you're gonna be mean to them,
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.400]  or you say bad words or have bad intent,
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.320]  they are gonna suffer and your medication is gonna suffer.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.240]  It's a simple, because there is this connection
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.120]  and they do know, they are a sentient being.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:14.800]  And so why are they gonna help you
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:16.560]  if you're not treating it with love?
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.280]  And if you're putting the love in,
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.480]  that's what you're getting out of the medicine.
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:25.760]  It might sound hokey, but like, honestly, I feel like,
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.400]  and that's why I'm so driven to get these plants outside
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.560]  in the real sun.
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:37.200]  Right, give them, finally give them what they really want.
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:40.520]  And I'm missing that whole part of the medicine.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:43.440]  I'm trying to do that, trying to do biomimicry with,
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.080]  I'm doing combination of CMH, LED and solar cure,
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:51.760]  like UV bulbs and different stages and trying to,
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:58.160]  simulate rise in sun and just with no digital, nothing,
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:02.160]  just analog timers, but it can be done.
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:04.200]  So that's another takeaway.
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.480]  You can grow the best medicine,
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:07.800]  you can grow better medicine,
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.640]  than the person you think grows better than you.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:11.960]  You just need to do it.
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:15.200]  And it's not about better, it's about,
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:22.600]  well, not meaning it's your own medicine.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:25.320]  Once you put that seed in your mouth,
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.720]  it is gonna bond with your, it is gonna,
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.640]  all right, now I'm talking crazy, but.
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:32.320]  Roll with it.
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:35.760]  It knows, it becomes part of you.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.760]  You are the plant, you are the plant, the plant is you.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.320]  So, you need to connect with the plant.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:47.120]  If you really want the medicine to be,
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:48.560]  regardless of how you grow it,
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.600]  you still need to connect with the plant.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.120]  But that connection with the soil
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.600]  is what's gonna make that plant.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:00.520]  You're gonna, I just feel the only way
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:03.040]  you're gonna bring out the best qualities of the plant
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:07.240]  and all of its metabolites and all of its,
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.320]  you know, thiols, esters, and aldehydes,
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.480]  and all those things are not gonna be done from,
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.200]  you know, but the nature of the natural process
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.400]  and trying to be as close to biomimicry as possible.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:21.200]  So I'm starting to, you know,
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:22.840]  so that's my next part of the journey is like,
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:24.760]  hey, I understand now I need to go out,
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.760]  I need to go out and do this,
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.720]  I understand now I need to go out, I need the sun,
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.160]  the sun, we're missing, we're missing the sun.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.160]  We are, and fortunately we can.
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:39.200]  Not all can we do, so still grow as ethically as you can
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:40.040]  and grow your own medicine,
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:42.000]  it's still that bond with the plant,
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.560]  it's still, you know what I mean?
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:46.800]  We all will all, you know,
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:48.840]  and maybe that's just what works,
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:50.280]  because all you have is a,
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.680]  you can still grow in a three by three by six foot space,
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.800]  like even smaller than a closet,
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:57.200]  people can make their own medicine.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:58.200]  And I encourage that,
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:00.720]  whether it's with just one little LED light
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:03.520]  and even just like a hempy bucket
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:06.520]  or whatever you wanna do, whatever, you know,
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:08.200]  that's still gonna be better medicine
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:10.120]  because you know, you've seen what happened,
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:13.000]  you didn't, you don't, you've seen every process of that.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.240]  And that's not me trying to,
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.200]  but like, how do you know,
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:19.440]  you're gonna go someplace and get something
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:21.360]  and you don't really know how it's been handled
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:24.800]  or processed or, you know,
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.400]  and then there's reputable places.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.280]  So I'm not trying to say that, like, you know, but.
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.120]  Hard to do at scale.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.240]  You're always gonna, you can do it yourself
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:38.240]  and for a lot cheaper and probably,
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.800]  you'll probably be really surprised at what you can do.
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:45.320]  Yep, and that's why everybody just needs to grow,
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.120]  just start, just get growing, just do it.
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:49.240]  This is a good channel,
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.960]  there's plenty of other good channels out there.
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:54.800]  Lots of information today that will get you going
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.680]  and growing, like just start.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:59.840]  I watch stuff, I go back, I'm like,
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:00.880]  oh, how did I miss this one?
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:03.440]  Cause you guys put out so much content,
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:04.600]  it's hard to keep up.
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:06.400]  Cause I'm watching all these other shows,
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:09.520]  like the shout out to Tad Hussey,
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:11.600]  Shango Lowe's Shaping Fire.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.960]  You know, I even listened to the Dude Grows.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:17.520]  I listened to Danny Dango, Broke the Fudge Yourself.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:20.080]  I listened to, you can pull a nugget away
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:23.840]  from any of those, Future Cannabis Project, of course, bro.
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:26.200]  You know, like I've been watching you guys,
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:28.200]  like that's how I knew Joshua Stimson
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:30.240]  before I knew I wanted to meet him.
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.080]  You know what I mean?
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:31.920]  Right, yeah.
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:32.960]  Now he actually knows who I am.
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.280]  So it's like, hey, cool dude.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.880]  And he's a really awesome dude.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:39.080]  Like all those people from the Regen Conference,
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:44.080]  Nature Summit, you know, I mean, I can't think of them all.
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:49.520]  Like Steve Reisner, Potent Ponics, like everybody,
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:53.240]  like all those people put out phenomenal content
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:56.800]  and like, I can only dream to learn, you know,
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:58.960]  but that's why it's important to have people
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:02.000]  that are specialists too, that that's all they delve in,
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.200]  because then they become the person that,
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:06.960]  you know, who am I gonna call?
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:09.640]  Oh, you know, boom, you know?
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:14.200]  So like all those people I admire and respect
[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:19.000]  and honestly they are, Kevin Chaudhry,
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.680]  all those people have made me into the grower I am today,
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:27.680]  you know, and well, have, you know,
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:33.440]  definitely have been so invaluable on this journey.
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:35.320]  So I really applaud all of what they're doing
[02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:37.680]  and I wish them all nothing but health, strength
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.960]  and prosperity and their loved ones.
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:44.600]  And, you know, we're only here for a finite,
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:47.760]  you know, it's like, so I really appreciate
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:49.440]  all those people doing that,
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.760]  because if they did that for me,
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:53.280]  imagine how many other people are touching.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:56.360]  And that's why that educating and elevating is like,
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:58.240]  cause you know, each one teach one,
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:21:59.560]  it really, you need to do that.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.960]  Like, and before it was so secretive,
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:04.360]  I had to go and hide to go get books.
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:08.280]  I had to, you know, like in 1996,
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.000]  I was like trying to research.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.360]  I had Jorge Cervantes, I had Mel Frank,
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:16.000]  I had Robert O'Connor Clark, I had, I have all these books.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.920]  And it's like, I couldn't even display them.
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.040]  You know, it's like back then it's like,
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:22.600]  and then kind of this culture magazine
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:25.440]  and high times of course, I have ones from,
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:28.360]  my friend gave me from like from the late seventies
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:31.720]  to present, I have pretty much all of those.
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.040]  I mean, not the latest ones,
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.080]  cause I kind of fell off with all that,
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.640]  because then all of a sudden,
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.040]  even though I'm not a computer person,
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.720]  all this finally became available to us.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:44.160]  And the climate change, so to speak, or the, you know,
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:50.120]  but that's another thing, support the prisoner project,
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.000]  because there's a lot of people there
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.040]  that don't have the luxury that I had
[02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:57.080]  to never have to have to worry about that,
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:01.040]  or on that magnitude, never had that type,
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.960]  I can't ever said I had those type of balls
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:06.560]  and my nuts and button mad respect
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:10.200]  and pay homage to all those people
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:15.240]  that made it so that we can be where we're at today.
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:17.280]  All those people, a lot of them been left behind.
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:19.560]  I talked to Eddie Leppin, he was very disappointed
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:22.120]  and I don't wanna get into what he told me,
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.760]  but those are the OGs,
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:27.160]  you know, shout out to him,
[02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.800]  Scott Fester-Flex, his son, you know, Brett,
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:32.360]  and those guys, you know, they put the work in,
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.800]  they deserve all the credit.
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:35.400]  There's so many people I can't even name,
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:37.160]  but I'm talking about legacy,
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:40.720]  I'm talking about, you know, all those people that,
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:44.280]  you know, and I'm just starting to be part of the community
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:47.720]  and I just want to kind of get that tap to the shoulder
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:49.920]  to go in and get in the game.
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.480]  Yeah, well, you're already in the game.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:55.680]  So just keep rolling with it, keep meeting people
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.920]  and keep lifting others up around you, man.
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:23:59.880]  That's awesome.
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:02.720]  And like you said, you know, each one teach one,
[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:06.240]  you know, we both have quoted Kevin Jodry today
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.840]  and that's just one example
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:10.060]  of the many people that are out there.
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:14.200]  But you know, we've both learned from them,
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:16.880]  we've both been inspired, it's, you know, kept us doing.
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:20.880]  So it's cool to actually be in that position yourself.
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:23.320]  So I know you're gonna inspire people
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:24.960]  and the more you do this,
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:26.480]  the more people that'll be inspired.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.160]  And that to me equals a better world.
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:32.160]  So yeah, it's an awesome thing.
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:33.880]  When I'm listening to Kevin talk about,
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:35.120]  and it's like, oh my God,
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:36.880]  like you identify with so many things.
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:39.680]  It's like, that's exactly how I feel.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:42.840]  That's exactly, like, it's just like, that's your story.
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:43.680]  No, that's my story.
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:44.520]  No, that's not, it's not.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:45.340]  But you know what I mean?
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:47.480]  Like in the way that I connect with the plant
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:51.400]  and how this progression, this journey has gotten me
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.440]  to understand about all these other things
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.840]  that it would have, that I surely would have never,
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.560]  that I've just kind of been like in the suburbs.
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:01.040]  Like what the hell?
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.320]  Like, even though I love nature,
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.440]  it's like, I would have never thought about,
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.400]  oh wow, I've spent hours researching all these things now.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.040]  It's just fascinating.
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:11.880]  Going out in the woods and you're like,
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.600]  now I'm like, well, this would be a good place
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.120]  for an IMO collection.
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:15.960]  Thank you, Marcus.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:18.640]  Shout out, Brian and Marco show.
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:21.520]  But yeah, Marco, he's got me on that one.
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:24.240]  I used, I asked, you know,
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:28.120]  I watched him during the Cannabinoid Cultivation Academy
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:30.320]  and I've watched him do his talks about worms.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:33.080]  And now I know he's rubber ducky isopods.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.120]  And, you know, shout out to that.
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:36.120]  That's awesome.
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:39.400]  That's another way to find your niche and still be,
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.680]  you know, it's awesome.
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:42.920]  It's awesome.
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:44.440]  Mad respect.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:45.280]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.480]  Well, speaking of educating, it looks like we've got,
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:50.080]  I've got two questions here for you.
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.120]  Anybody in chat, you guys have been awesome.
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:56.000]  I've been enjoyed watching and reading along as well today.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.200]  And I see Chef Alex is in here too.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.560]  So that's pretty cool.
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:01.520]  Good to see you.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.280]  Award time award winner, Chef Alex,
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:05.440]  my best friend, my bestie.
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:06.840]  We're gonna do shit together.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.680]  We're doing shit.
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:08.940]  We are doing shit together.
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:10.640]  We keep going and winning awards places.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:13.120]  So like, that's not everything though.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:14.880]  So now we're gonna bring this message
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:19.880]  and these incredible, delightful, organic,
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.680]  and works of gourmet art.
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:26.520]  Yes.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.080]  He won for his salted caramel at the Auto Cup
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:32.480]  at Shanghai Luce over on Shoshone Island.
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:33.880]  Okay.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:35.840]  And he does some auto car greeting
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:37.400]  with a friend of his, Joe.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.240]  And then he won for the Stroopwafel.
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.680]  He won for caramel.
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:44.480]  He added a garlic to Burrito.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:46.680]  He didn't win when I got my third place,
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:48.400]  but that was on point.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.200]  Everybody still loves his,
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.560]  and it's the best gummies you'll ever try ever.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.560]  Because it's all natural.
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.400]  It's all from real fruit.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:57.240]  Right.
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:00.400]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:01.240]  The texture of his caramel,
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.720]  he had a salted bourbon caramel with Celtic sea salt
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.640]  or Scotch whiskey with Celtic sea salt,
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:11.600]  vanilla, real vanilla bean.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:14.120]  Because Cheddar Bob, shout out to those dudes too.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.600]  He was, that was the first thing he asked him.
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:20.560]  Did you use vanilla extract?
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:22.640]  He's like, no, I use vanilla bean.
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:27.000]  So anyway, he's gonna succeed
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  because we're gonna be collabing with a lot of stuff.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.360]  He's definitely my best friend
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:41.040]  and an amazing grower too, him and Joe.
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:42.600]  And we know so many other people too.
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.560]  It's like, I don't wanna put everybody on blast either,
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:48.160]  but we've met so many wonderful people.
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.680]  And I've already taken an hour and a half of your time.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:53.440]  And I have the gift of gab,
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:55.120]  so I don't wanna keep cutting you off.
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.400]  And it's just my passion.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:58.320]  It's my passion, bro.
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:01.000]  And I'm honored to be here and thank you for this platform.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  And again, mad respect.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.080]  You guys are killing it.
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.840]  And I appreciate you very, very much.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:09.680]  Thank you, man.
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.520]  Thank you.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:12.120]  It's been a fun conversation.
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.440]  I enjoyed it.
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:16.120]  And I hope, and I know that we'll do this in the future
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:18.320]  many more times on camera, off camera.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:19.560]  It doesn't really matter.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:23.000]  It's a good one.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.600]  I just, I do wanna say here a couple of questions.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:27.240]  And because you mentioned it earlier,
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:29.720]  I know you talked about a microscope,
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:30.800]  but Ken Summersville,
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.080]  he actually does some shows here on the channel as well.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:35.400]  He also does a lot of production.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:36.960]  I just started following him because,
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:39.960]  yes, yes, I saw him on the other show the other day, yes.
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:42.760]  Yep, so, okay, you are using a microscope.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.120]  What are you using the microscope for?
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.400]  Is it for looking at trichomes
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:47.720]  or are you actually looking at like-
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:50.120]  Yeah, no, I wanna do that.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:51.400]  Limitodes.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:55.000]  No, no, no, I wish that, well, that was my next thing.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.840]  I was thinking about doing the Elaine Ingham home.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.160]  She has something you can do online.
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:03.000]  Yep.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:03.840]  But I'm not doing that.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.640]  I'm entrusting in Kiss Organics soil
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.800]  to be full of the diversity that I need.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:14.400]  Well, I'm doing, but yes, no,
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.080]  I use it primarily to look at the trichomes.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.960]  I have a digital one and then I have a little like dynalite,
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.560]  but yeah, primarily you just use that for pests
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:31.560]  and for looking to find maturity to harvest.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:38.080]  I use it for basically pest identification and yeah.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:39.040]  Okay, good deal.
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:44.040]  And we have one Jessica Rutherford came in at the end.
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:45.560]  This is when we were talking
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:47.200]  about putting the seeds in the mouth.
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.000]  And it said, pre germination,
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.240]  place seeds in your mouth for a connection.
[02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:53.160]  How long?
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.280]  Meditation, I'm assuming.
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.760]  Do you meditate while you do it?
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:56.600]  And let me just try to-
[02:29:56.600 --> 02:29:59.200]  This is something that I haven't been doing very long,
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:00.720]  but it's something that I believe in.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:03.120]  And it's something that Wolf Siegel talked about.
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:06.740]  It's a sadhus in India have done it for hundreds of years.
[02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:10.340]  It's part of the amylase.
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.180]  Like we actually talked about this on the phone,
[02:30:12.180 --> 02:30:13.020]  but prior to this-
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.780]  Let's see if I spelled it right, I'll Google it now.
[02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:18.660]  And even like Wolf Siegel would be like,
[02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:19.940]  well, it can't hurt.
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:23.300]  But if anything, the amylase will actually help, right?
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:29.400]  Soften the seed casing and help it germinate.
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:31.380]  Did I spell that right?
[02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:33.020]  Enzyme, amylase.
[02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:33.860]  Yeah, I believe it is.
[02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:34.900]  Good for me.
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:35.740]  Yeah, it is.
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:37.300]  It's something that I heard too.
[02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.120]  It's a lot of people-
[02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:42.140]  Even Clapton-
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:42.980]  Rooting agents, hormone agents.
[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:43.820]  He talked about amylase.
[02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:45.280]  And that's a natural one.
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:46.900]  Yes, yes.
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:47.740]  Yep.
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:50.740]  Okay, so we've got through those questions here.
[02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:53.180]  How long?
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:54.000]  I don't know.
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:55.380]  I just kind of put it in.
[02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:59.700]  I kind of just put it in and just like say a prayer.
[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:01.620]  And, or like, yeah.
[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:03.540]  I mean, I think you need to also
[02:31:03.540 --> 02:31:05.260]  kind of mentally give an intent.
[02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:06.420]  I don't know.
[02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:07.260]  It can't hurt.
[02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:08.080]  Okay, intent's important.
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:10.820]  We've been talking about that this whole time though.
[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:11.940]  If you believe it or not,
[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:15.020]  I believe you just need to say, I love you.
[02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:17.660]  Please provide good medicine for me.
[02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:18.700]  Thank you for,
[02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:22.220]  thank you for, you know, kind of just like,
[02:31:22.220 --> 02:31:23.300]  thank you for your blessing.
[02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:24.320]  Just like Indians did.
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:26.860]  They didn't ever take anything more than they needed.
[02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:28.580]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:29.620]  Ugh.
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:31.220]  I like that.
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:33.700]  Well, but before we go,
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:35.680]  I do want to give you an opportunity again,
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:37.740]  just to give some shout outs to, you know,
[02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:40.740]  the people that have supported you or support you,
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:43.820]  you look up to as far as the information, but yeah.
[02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:46.800]  Anybody you want to mention and for everybody watching,
[02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.700]  his IG is down in the show notes.
[02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:52.500]  So connect with John, the gross space killer.
[02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:54.540]  I have to say it that way.
[02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:55.740]  I'm a little fan.
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:56.940]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:58.060]  Yeah, I'm sorry, but you know,
[02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:00.780]  please go ahead and shout out anybody you'd like here
[02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:02.180]  or anything.
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:03.500]  Man.
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:04.660]  No pressure.
[02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:07.320]  Well, people influence me like,
[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:13.900]  man, like so many people,
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:16.940]  even watch the guy that does the grow your greens,
[02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:19.060]  the guy, John, all these other people,
[02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:22.320]  like honestly, like even bubble man, John Berfulo,
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:24.700]  all these people like that, you know,
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:27.620]  Jorge Cervantes, obviously Ed Rosenthal,
[02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:28.780]  they finally got to meet him.
[02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:29.620]  I have a picture,
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:31.540]  they finally got to meet him and he smoked my weed.
[02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:33.380]  And then he actually had a hard time
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:34.580]  doing his little speech there.
[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:35.980]  So I found that out.
[02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:39.300]  Shout out to Bill, Bill, New England,
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:42.940]  any gorilla growing,
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:47.740]  he was there kind of being his entourage or his,
[02:32:49.180 --> 02:32:50.760]  and he told me afterwards, he's like, oh my God,
[02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:54.020]  he smoked that green Fino and he couldn't even talk.
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:56.100]  And I was like, oh, I'm mortified,
[02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.960]  but I'm so proud at the same time.
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:01.360]  So the green Fino man, that's the one.
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:02.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:06.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, but honestly, if you mix them together,
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.520]  I met Swerve at the, yeah, Swerve,
[02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:12.800]  your genetics, I've been running them for fucking eight
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:15.520]  years and, you know, I'm winning awards with them
[02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:18.480]  and I appreciate you and it is my medicine
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:21.240]  and I don't know, but that's kind of how it is
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:23.040]  when you take care of something.
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:28.200]  So yeah, this, I got to see him,
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:30.800]  I got to dab him out at the Freedom Rally
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:32.800]  and he was like, mix them together.
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:34.360]  And if he didn't tell me that,
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:36.440]  I wouldn't have had enough for the entry for the dabadoo.
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.640]  So he told me to mix them together
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.240]  and that was the only way it was a possible entry.
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:45.640]  And so, and it actually is good together
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:48.400]  because some people don't like that pinene
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:50.320]  that gives it kind of messes your lungs
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:53.320]  or I love feeling that like that rug burn OG,
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:56.000]  but the other one is the purple,
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.720]  the anthocyanins is more fruit.
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:33:59.880]  So it's, it doesn't have that hit,
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:01.520]  but it does have that fruity flavor
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:04.840]  and it has the beautiful color and, you know,
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:06.520]  but together they're magic.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:08.160]  And it's kind of like when you take,
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.880]  like if you're going to go grow a whole field of cannabis,
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:15.400]  traditionally, wasn't it just harvested altogether
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.880]  and then thrashed or made into hash?
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:20.920]  So you're getting all those phenotypical expressions
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:23.760]  all in that hash and each chemo bar,
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:25.840]  each pheno has its own chemo bar, right?
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.440]  Or slightly altered or variation.
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:30.760]  And now you're putting it all together.
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:33.080]  So you're getting that full plant medicine.
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:35.640]  And so together they're amazing
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:37.320]  because you still get a little fruit,
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:38.920]  but then you get that gas.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:41.520]  So it's together, they're awesome.
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.600]  So, yeah.
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:45.240]  My wife would love that answer
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:47.000]  because she constantly mixes.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.760]  She mixes everything into the bowl.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:52.320]  She's like, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.040]  And I'm over here, I'm like, I got a testing.
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:55.760]  So I want to know exactly, you know,
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:58.840]  how this one affected me or if this one was the winner.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:00.720]  So I'm always just smoking it by myself.
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:03.360]  So yeah, when you put it that way.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:04.800]  We'll tell you your nose knows.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:07.560]  So you kind of get drawn to the strain that you,
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:08.440]  you know, with anything,
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.880]  that's what's kept us here at the top of the food chain,
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:14.120]  knowing that, well, well, everybody's here, but animals,
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:16.720]  like our nose is our most important sense.
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:20.600]  Without it, we would not exist, right?
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:21.440]  We wouldn't know what-
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:22.800]  The nose knows.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.640]  Yes.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:26.520]  Well, cool, man.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:27.840]  Thank you for your time, John.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.920]  I really appreciate the time you've taken.
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.960]  It's been an honor and my privilege, honestly.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:33.920]  Thank you, Chad.
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:38.920]  And wish you and all you guys, the family, the FCP family,
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:45.240]  hope to be invited into the Cool Kids Club again.
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:48.200]  Right on.
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:50.240]  We got your lunchbox packed already.
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.080]  You're in.
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:51.920]  Nice.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.760]  Yeah.
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:54.360]  I got my swimsuit and my towel.
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:55.520]  I'm ready to go to camp.
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:57.040]  Yes.
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.560]  The pool is on the roof.
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:00.720]  Never buy that one.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:01.560]  It's not up there.
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:02.400]  No.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:03.360]  Yeah, no, thank you.
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:06.520]  And hopefully we'll see you entering some of the FCP cups
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:09.520]  that hopefully will be coming down the road.
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:12.640]  Well, hopefully I'll be reporting, you know,
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:16.080]  a good favor at the Freedom Cup.
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:16.920]  Yeah.
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.840]  You know, those guys, I guess that's the Canna Maniacs.
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:21.840]  They're doing that.
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:24.760]  So.
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:26.720]  Yeah, I don't know the group behind it, but-
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:27.560]  No, no, I just-
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:29.040]  It's a huge event.
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:32.160]  I just met them at the intake to drop off my samples
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:34.400]  and kicked it with some other good growers,
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:35.320]  which was actually cool.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:37.360]  Because, you know, you go to enter these things
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.040]  and you're gonna meet a lot of people
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.080]  that also on this same journey with you.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.080]  And so a lot of really good people and great growers.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:46.880]  Thank you, Chad.
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:47.720]  Awesome, man.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:48.960]  Yep, no, my pleasure.
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:51.480]  Everybody in chat, thank you so much for hanging out.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:52.360]  Thanks for being here.
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:55.480]  Everybody watching on replay, we really appreciate that.
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.160]  Keep doing your damn thing out there.
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:36:59.280]  Keep growing.
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.880]  And go follow John, man.
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:02.720]  Overgrow.
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:03.560]  Catch up with this guy.
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.080]  Yes, overgrow.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:07.040]  All right, with that, I will hit the.
