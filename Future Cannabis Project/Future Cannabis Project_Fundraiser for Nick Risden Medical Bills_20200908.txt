Okay.
All right, let me create a graph deck.
All right, we're live.
Hey everybody, thanks for, we're live?
Yes.
Anybody watching, thanks for hopping on.
We're trying to raise some money for Nick.
Most people that have watched this show in the last month
know who Nick Rysden is, he's a good friend of mine.
He's been struggling with multiple tick-borne diseases.
He got bit by a tick a couple of years ago
and it's just changed his life.
And he's been struggling to stay alive, to be honest,
for the last couple of years.
And a couple of days ago, in the middle of the night,
he was in such excruciating pain in his arm
that his fiancee drug him to the hospital
and he had a big infection
just basically explode in his arm.
And so they did a surgery and scraped a bunch of it out
and then they ended up doing a second surgery
and they're gonna probably do a third and maybe a fourth.
And so it's a bit of a gnarly thing,
but the even more challenging thing for him
is because he basically left his home state of Kentucky
so he could be in a medical safe state, Michigan,
where he moved to.
He hasn't got his insurance transferred over
and it's been a challenge to do so.
And so he's got a round of prescriptions
that's around $3,000, that is $3,000.
And he let me know, we just talked for just a minute,
about a half hour, an hour ago,
and he said he's got all that, he's got about 2,400 bucks.
He's like, man, I'll sell any pack of seeds
if you can get me 600 bucks raised.
And in my mind, I know that that means
that's all the money they have.
And so they won't have money for food
and anything else that's gonna happen,
gas to get back for the surgeries, et cetera.
So the only way they make money is through their fall crop.
And so they're literally treading water
and waiting for the next few weeks
to bring that crop down.
And obviously he's not gonna be able to work
to help harvest it.
So that's another issue.
But today, if we can raise three grand to pay for that,
that medical expenses, prescription,
antibiotics, essentially, and painkillers,
I think maybe a little bit, I don't even know.
I think it's just antibiotics, to be honest,
needles and that sort of materials.
I don't think he really likes to take any pain meds
or anything unless it's absolutely necessary.
And then the other need I'll just throw out there,
that he's in dire need of some Royal Kush material
to make RSO out of like ASAP.
He was contemplating cutting some plants down early
just to get some RSO that he can use,
but he needs kind of specifically something
with the Royal Kush lines in it that has the Neridol
and he's willing to buy it or trade for it or whatever.
He has a bunch of other weed,
and I'm just throwing that out there.
If you're in the area or a way to get him,
sorry about that.
If you're in the area or have a way to get him
hooked up on that, reach out to me on my Instagram
and DM me, Dutch blooms, Dutch underscore blooms
in Instagram, and we can help figure that out.
So what we're gonna try to do is we're gonna auction
a couple of things off like we've been doing,
and we're also going to do a lower ticket value
giveaway.
So if you can donate 30 to $50,
whatever you can afford and send a verification picture
to us, to me, DM to me, then I will ship you a pack
of 12 seeds made by Itau Foundation.
They are TKM 10 across the platinum pie selection
that he made.
And yeah, if you were part of the Regen Conference
this year in Michigan or Maine, you got a pack of these
in the mail already.
And so there's some folks growing these out
and I've heard some good feedback.
And he's not selling it.
And so what I hold in my hand in my refrigerator here
is all that's available of this stuff.
And it's for a good cause.
And I actually don't have any experience
with the TKM 10.
Do you, Kaya, have any experience with that one?
Is he still with us?
I think we lost him.
But I'm sure he'll be back.
And so Peter, can you pop up the image for Nick's Venmo?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm making it right now.
So the image will be up in 30 seconds.
Okay.
You know, and just to let you know,
if you don't know Nick,
he's been going through this battle for two years
and it's an up and down thing,
literally on a month by month or week by week basis,
or sometimes day by day.
But when he's up and feeling good or feeling somewhat good,
he's trying to raise support and help others.
You know, we kind of, for me,
getting involved in doing this auctions
was really driven by him,
wanting to raise money for Tommy, Duke Diamond.
And so I was like, yeah, man, I'll do whatever I can.
You know, if you want to raise some money for somebody,
I'll help you out, you know, no problem.
Just as a thing to do and be cool.
And then it was successful.
And yeah, just, he's a real cool dude.
And he's always giving and taking care of people
with what he's got, you know,
and he's hurting and in need right now.
I really appreciate everybody coming together,
Peter and Cascadian.
And I think Dragonfly is going to pop on here
in a few minutes, Josh and Kelly,
and Kaya is going to hop back on here
and Tyler, Family Tree Seeds.
We're going to auction some stuff off
and try to raise some money that way.
But yeah, I think that if we could get 100 people
to donate 300 or 30 to 50 bucks,
then we've got the goal
and we can get the prescription taken care of, you know?
Right.
Let me just see if any,
okay, so let me quickly,
give me one minute to get that up.
Okay, you see that?
Yeah.
So it's the Venmo is Nick-Risden.
And then you can just, yeah,
send your donation there
and take a screenshot of the donation
and you can DM that to me on Instagram.
Yeah, either DM it or,
I put my email address up in the chat.
So just, yeah, either DM Josh or email me
so we have your contact info
and then we can get your mailing address.
Can you send me something on what the,
so basically anybody who donates 30 to 50 bucks
gets a pack from ITEL Foundation, correct?
Yeah, and it's the TK M10,
Triangle Cush M10 crossed with the Platinum Pi,
F2 that you selected.
Can you text me that?
Yep.
Grow to Smoke It Cash App.
It's Venmo,
Nick-Risden.
Yeah, that was Walter, you said Nick-Risden.
Yeah, Nick-Risden.
Let me figure out where to,
can I pin something?
Whoops.
All right, let me make a graphic for that.
Oh, Tyler from Family Tree, hold on.
Oh, we lost Josh.
No wonder why it was so quiet.
And he's back.
And he's back, yep.
Sorry about that, guys, I'm not sure what happened.
So TK M10 crossed with Platinum Pi F2, right?
Correct.
It should probably be written the other way around,
actually, Platinum Pi F2 crossed TK M10.
Okay, and I don't think I,
let me just get this up and then I'll ping Tyler.
Eyes hollow.
Yeah, this is the guy from Kentucky that's been on,
someone was asking in chat.
He moved up to Michigan, he lives up there now,
and that's kind of why he has the need
is he doesn't have insurance.
He's been trying to switch it back,
switch it over to Michigan where he lives
and is in the hospital right now having surgeries.
So he can't get the medication paid for through insurance.
But yeah, he's from Kentucky.
And his kind of main thing that he suffers from
was a tick bite that he acquired a number of
tick-borne diseases, Lyme's disease kind of being
the easy one, and the way he talks about it,
he's like, oh yeah, I got Lyme's disease.
We dealt with that a while ago,
but it's these other ones that I can't remember or pronounce
that are really intense and rare
and people that have them don't live very long.
He's kind of outlived most people.
And it's definitely a miraculous story.
He's been on, hopped off all the other,
the prescription stuff,
and been on mycocaps and mycocannicaps
from Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
and RSO, massive amounts of RSO,
specifically Royal Kush,
or Royal Kush derivative strains
that are high in osamine and neradol,
which are antimicrobial and fight the infection in his body.
Infections, but the infections are,
it's kind of like this up and down battle.
And this is definitely a shitty thing
that he's going through.
All right, I almost have the,
so based on rating, donate 30 to 50 bucks
and get a pack from ITAL Foundation,
Platinum Pi F2 crossed with TKM 10.
Is that good?
Yeah.
Okay.
So this is for all the people who always want to help out,
but, and we totally understand
that everybody can afford like the $500 purchase price
or $1,000 purchase price as some of these.
Is there somebody that can take PayPal
that can then turn around and slap it on Nick's Venmo?
Or is that, are they gonna take a slab off that?
We'll get back to you on that.
Should we see if,
is there any way to see if Nick also has a PayPal?
I don't know how Venmo works.
Kaya says he can't get back in.
All right, I'll,
here, tell him to hold on a second.
Let me just,
I'm just creating this graphic and then I'll,
let me, oh, wait, here we go.
He's coming back.
There we go.
What?
Everybody's popping off.
All right, Josh, you're back.
Sorry about that.
I keep, I think because I entered through my text message
every time I pop out to do a text, it kicks me out.
I'm back.
What's up, bro?
You kicked me out.
Cool.
There we go, that's a good graphic.
Donate to the community.
Donate to the community.
Donate to the community.
Donate to the community.
Donate to the community.
Donate to the community.
That's a good graphic.
Donate 30 to 50 bucks to Nick's,
Nick hyphen,
Riseden on Venmo.
And we'll send you out a pack of ITAL Foundation,
TKM10 cross platinum Pi F2.
I was asking you when you were popping off, Kaya,
have you run the TKM10?
I know it's kind of, it's a classic strain,
but I have no experience with it.
I have not.
I got a bunch of this stuff running this summer.
I've got a bunch of those jelly rolls going.
Yeah, the jelly roll is stinky, dude.
It is stinky.
And I dropped a bunch of the Long Valley Royal Cushes
out in Hawaii with my people out there.
So those are getting some sunshine.
Nice.
Nice.
Well, let's get an auction going while we're at it.
You got something you're looking at?
I made myself a list.
I'm never this organized.
A list on the computer.
I used Excel.
Nice.
So I've got, I'm just thinking,
because I've got different readings.
So I thought maybe I'd offer something
from each reading until we get to our number.
And let's start it off with a fog reading.
So that's the OG Cush female,
crossed with our freeze F3.
That was the boy in this one.
And then we crossed that to Key Lime Coffee.
The key lime that we used in that cross
was Starfighter times Cherry Pie.
So the Cherry Pie clone only crossed with Starfighter.
And then we selected a female of that
and hit it with our coffee.
And then selected a female of that
and hit it with this fog to make the Key Lime Frappe.
So we'll offer up a pack of Key Lime Frappe to start it.
I don't know, Josh.
What should we start it off for?
200 bucks?
100 bucks?
What do you?
How about start it off at 50?
How about start it off at 50?
All right.
Let people jump in on it.
Will you keep us on time, cascading,
give us a five minute timer and manage that in chat?
Yeah, Kai, can you read that to me one more time?
I wanna make sure I did it right.
And can you text it to me?
And I'll create a graphic for it.
Sure, let me try here.
I hope it doesn't drop me off here.
If it does, Kai, enter through email.
Did Peter send you the email?
If you enter it through email, I think it won't drop you.
Okay, I'll double check.
Sorry, I'm on my phone today, guys,
because the power's out,
internet's out here at the house.
But the one we're auctioning off here is Key Lime Frappe.
That's the name of the strain, Key Lime Frappe.
And that is Key Lime Coffee crossed with the fog.
The fog is OG Kush times freeze.
The Key Lime Coffee is cherry pie, star fighter, and coffee.
All right, Key Lime Frappe, F-R-A-P-P-E.
Just F-R-A-P, we keep them short.
And Key Lime, K-E-Y-L-I-M-E, Key Lime Frappe.
And what is that?
That's a what crossed with a what?
That is Key Lime Coffee, email,
and the fog, mail.
F-O-G?
P-H-O-G.
So Key Lime Coffee crossed with fog.
I was trying to auto-correct that.
Do you need to have Venmo app to send?
Venmo, is that the hangup?
It seems like you can't just use a credit card.
Like you gotta have the app.
But yeah, for everybody watching,
yeah, we get that people outside the US
don't necessarily have Venmo.
So give us a minute to work on it.
Let me just, all right, so let me create the key.
Good God, I don't even have time to get my beer.
What is it, Pacific, your Instagram's Pacific underscore?
No, Pacific NW, roots with a Z.
That's our main account.
Okay, Pacific Northwest roots.
Pacific Northwest roots.
That's our main account.
Okay, Pacific Northwest roots.
It's a Key Lime Frappe,
which is a Key Lime Coffee by Fog, good enough.
That does not look very good,
but I hope you are not offended
by how I graphically represent your donation.
I love those sounds, oh man.
Are they too loud?
No, no.
No, they're nice.
I think they're much needed today.
Yeah, got those for Tati for her birthday.
The Corinthian bells, they call them.
Tune to the key of G.
Okay, so this is what we have going right now, right?
And I think we, Mr. Trees, I think we lost Josh.
There's Josh.
I'm back, yeah.
Yeah, I recognize that guy.
What's up, guys?
How you doing?
All right, man, running around like a wild man.
Glad I could get in here.
Get set up here, give me a sec, I'm gonna mute myself.
You know, he's all business
because he rolls around every day
with those clippers on his side.
Yeah.
I just took off the giant knives, man,
the knives and shovels.
Clippers are the only thing that never come off, you know?
You need to hurry, hurry for the other side,
and here's that.
Rolling up like Croc Dundee.
Sorry, Rolo, sorry, Rolo.
Come on, Rolo, come here.
Come here, Rolo.
You wanna be on TV?
Hi, Rolo.
Oh, we got a hundred bucks going.
Someone's asking again what the lineage is,
and it's the Fog OG is the Freezeland OG,
onto the OG, is that what it is, the Freeze onto OG?
Yeah, and maybe, Peter, you could add this
to that same graphic underneath it there.
So yeah, the Fog is OG Kush, female,
and then the male is the Freeze.
And that Freeze is something that we bred out.
It was a clone around here,
and then we out-crossed it and back-crossed it a bunch.
And it's kind of a unique thing
that we're smoking on up here,
like when I was in high school.
And then the Key Lime Coffee side of it
is cherry pie times starfighter times coffee.
That was-
What was it?
Where'd you get the cherry pie?
Was it a cut or a bag seed?
I picked up that cherry pie cut long time ago
down in Berkeley, California,
and brought it up here,
like beginning of medical days in Washington.
Well, the breakout of medical days.
And that was that really crazy.
In fact, Jai just asked me when I seen him in Spain.
He said, man, you still got that cut?
Because I don't know too many people that have it.
It was a little unstable,
and that was kind of the point of breeding it
to what we were doing was to try to stabilize it
and get that in there.
So Mike and I, Exotic Mike, worked on that.
I gave him the cut,
and he crossed it, hit it with his starfighter,
and then passed me a couple of those females
and actually gave me a bunch of males
that he had selected through too.
And we did a little breeding project called the gas mask,
but that's where that came from, that key lime.
It's not mean genes.
Totally different from what mean genes working with.
This stuff down there is super fire too, by the way.
That's the one where the families go for it,
and it did a herm like week four.
Ooh, we got a sniper, Nicola Davis, 110.
120, Jack Field, get it.
Yeah, these usually go out for 200 or more.
The seed page has been doing auctions on them,
and these are great ones, man.
Some fire in there.
Jack Field, oh, we got a little $5 increments.
Like it.
A little bidding war.
130 it is.
Remember guys, this is all going to help out
our brother Nick.
He's struggling right now,
and every bit of support he can get, super cool.
Someone just said, SunGrowth707 said,
Gene needs some vibes, his farm is in danger.
I saw his post.
Was it, were the flames that close to where he is?
I don't know.
I don't know if the flames are close,
but we definitely getting smoked out.
I mean, the weeds are getting fucked
if it's looking like that, right?
The smoke.
Oh yeah.
Did you hear the crickets?
That was wild.
Yeah, yeah.
Crickets are flying off.
I heard that.
You know, we had that like a couple of years like that,
and I'm looking out the window,
and it's just, the smoke's just starting to roll in,
and the haze up here.
It's not like nothing like what they are,
but you know, when you look up,
you're like, what's going on?
You know?
So a quick thank you to Walter Jorgensen,
who made a $40 donation.
Randy Haas, thank you for your donation.
Anyway.
Here, send Nick the link.
He just texted me and said he could pop on
and help us with PayPal.
Oh, he has a PayPal.
Okay, cool.
This will...
Probably pop off, and I'll just text it to him.
That'll be easy for him.
And then I'll hop back on.
Let me, yeah, I'll text it to you so you can just, boom.
You got that?
Actually, I think I, here, hold on, Nick.
And I think...
Yeah, I don't think.
Yeah, I can text it to him.
Hold on, please.
Okay.
Is he setting up a PayPal?
Okay.
So yeah, everybody who can't donate a demo,
don't worry, we'll have the PayPal option,
even if it's not in the next hour,
the seeds aren't going anywhere.
Yeah, yeah, we got plenty.
Have we wrapped up?
And where are we at on the talk?
I'm choked up.
Cascades are tough for my papers.
Yeah, that ended.
We ran out of time,
and I think we got those Cascade in for 1.30.
Is that where that ended up at?
Yeah, 1.30 to Jack Field, two words.
Okay, so Jack Field.
YouTube name is Jack Field.
Yeah.
I now have a spreadsheet.
Oh, nice.
Oh yeah, Jack Field.
Jack.
So Jack, if you can send me an email,
or actually, yeah, hold on.
In the background, Peter's just developing a master list,
and he's gonna be like,
you know what, motherfucker,
I know your YouTube name, your address.
I know the...
No one's ever good.
Posting us again.
Yeah.
So that was a steal, right?
Kaya, you said those usually go for 200?
Deal.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
How long you been at this?
Tell them, you guys going before I got on here.
Just five minutes, we kind of, yeah.
I were just sloppily getting it going,
just trying to pull it together, man.
No, no, yeah, yeah, cool.
We're like a well-oiled machine by now.
I, by the way, I'm still trying to,
I've spent the past two days trying to, like,
match YouTube usernames with items one,
with real names, with addresses,
and then people will, like, email me their address,
and it's like all in lowercase, missing critical things,
like someone forgot to put the word north in,
like, you know, North Gretna Green,
or South Gretna Green,
and I'm like, how do you forget to put that in your address
when you're gonna be shipped something?
And so, so Cascading, I saw, yeah,
I'll look at the,
the,
because I've finished Saturday,
and now I'm struggling with Friday,
because there were, I think, like six,
on Friday, oh, the Pamdemic, I think.
Did you text me that?
And then, let me see if Nick's not logged in yet.
This one I'm waiting for, yeah.
Let me go to your.
Pretty sure they're on that list.
Yeah, let me just go to your,
and that's the other thing, get it,
I'm like, I know someone, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, hey, if you wanna feed me another one,
I'll start it.
Who wants to throw something up?
No pressure, Kyle.
I'm happy to throw up.
I've been waiting to throw up,
but I don't know, how many viewers do we have?
Yeah, how many people, Nick?
There's Nick.
Hey, hey, Nick.
Zion is connecting.
You're on.
Let me see if Nick.
Here's Nick.
One sec.
What's up, Nick, can you hear us?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Hey, Nick.
What's up, homies?
What's up?
What's up, man?
Good to hear you, brother.
You too.
They just let me go.
This surgery again on Friday.
It's better for me to recoup from,
and I won't be as dope John's every six hours,
because I don't like this.
But I appreciate the love, and I'll be good financially.
We're looking at $3,600 pharmacy bill on them.
And we've got almost all that.
We're just several hundred short.
And I'll harvest big here in a week or two.
I don't know how I'm gonna do anything.
But I really hate the charity,
meeting with people, people meeting things.
But I just can't skip the antibiotics right now.
I gotta run them through my chest.
I'm sorry to ask.
I know I need help.
And I can pay this back on auctions in just a couple weeks.
I just can't even skip a couple days on antibiotics.
But apparently I got some infection.
What's it called?
Necrophagia.
What?
Necrophagia, it's a bacteria that's tissue.
I've been complaining about arm pain to the doctors
for a couple months.
I guess.
I don't know.
Hey, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, just quickly.
I'm gonna, Nick, I'm gonna kill your video for one second
just so we can hear your audio.
Okay, go ahead.
Nick, can you hear me?
Okay.
Here, Nick, we'll come back to you in a second.
Let's get the next, sorry, what was our next item?
If you don't mind, Peter, I'll jump in with another one.
Okay.
I got a pack of a mango here,
and that's one of our original releases.
So it's an alien kush cross.
It's the mango kush times alien kush, mango.
Okay, so what's it called again?
Bango, B-A-N-G-O.
Yep.
Like bingo.
It's a cross of what?
Mango kush and alien kush.
Okay.
Was that your alien kush that's in the coffee?
Is that anything special with that alien kush?
What's the word behind that one?
Can I start it up?
Yeah, actually, that was a cool one.
I was gifted that clone.
It was a male, how I started breeding.
My mentor gave me that clone.
He had picked up the seeds at auction.
And at the time, they were like the most expensive seed
ever sold at auction.
It was like 1700 bucks he paid.
And they were released by OG Rascal.
So Rascal had picked it up, made the originals,
and then sent them out.
And then Mel made the F2s, I think,
and then handed me that male.
And that was a real special boy.
He was short in flower time on anything it touched,
added some frost and some purpleness.
Great breeding plant.
I rocked that guy for a long time, actually.
Kind of miss him.
I wish I had him back.
Is that accurate?
Yep, that's perfect.
You could put F2 after that alien kush,
just so folks know.
For people that are kind of wondering,
well, what's F1, F2?
That's filial generation.
So you're line breeding, essentially,
breeding brothers and sisters to each other.
At F2, you're gonna get kind of a higher expression
of the different genotypes that are in there.
So you're gonna see a wide variety of different things.
And that's where you can have a lot of fun popping seeds.
So these should be great for anybody.
A fast finisher, the mango kush was a super fast finisher.
It's my understanding that it was just a green crack phenol,
the mango kush.
So it had that real sweet smell to it.
Super fast finisher, did great outdoors.
These ones are gonna be nice and squat,
really good structure, grenade-sized nuggies on them.
And these are regular seeds, right?
Not feminized.
Yeah, everything we do,
played a little bit with feminized stuff,
but we're predominantly doing just regular beans,
which I think is a little bit better
for if you're wanting to breed and do stuff down the line.
If you've got some of those intentions,
then I say rock some regulars instead of feminized.
Peter, did you see, I texted you,
we got a PayPal email account.
Oh, sweet, okay.
You can post that.
What are they going up for?
What did we put these up for?
They're at 150 right now.
Boom, they're rocking.
Boom.
You're on it.
That skate is not playing around.
He's running the show.
Let's get it.
Let's get this money.
Let's get this prescription filled, guys.
I can't see it,
but I imagine like 10 computer screens in front of him,
you know what I mean?
And he's like winging and banging and checking and doing.
Miracle worker.
Easy there, Rolo.
Easy, come here.
Come here.
Come here, Rolo.
Is that a 12 pack?
10 pack?
Yeah, we always say 10 pack,
but there's always an extra bean or two in there.
I had a question in chat.
And listen, you know,
folks, I just want to throw this out there too.
And you folks, anytime you're picking something up
on something like this,
I'm going to send it out in a nice little gift bag.
I'm going to throw in some CBD Kush creams,
some medicated cream from our friends over at Kush Creams.
She's super supportive of, you know,
kind of anything that we're getting into.
You know, we'll throw down some really dope root stickers.
And, you know, if you guys bid it up real high,
you know, I'm throwing in extras.
I'll throw in some Matterhorn or something special in there.
I always try to take care of folks
who are having good intentions
and looking out for each other.
So keep that in mind when you're bidding.
Is this the packaging?
Actually, these are,
I'm going to, I'm actually going to take a little walk,
stroll down to the root cellar.
And this is, these ones are coming in our,
some old, old original packaging stuff here.
Here.
You.
These bangle ones are.
You're, you're, you're, you're breaking up a little bit.
Yeah, the root cellar, he's not kidding.
It's a root cellar.
All right, I'm back out here.
So yeah, these are, these are actually some,
some old school packaging that we had done.
Boom, but I will definitely throw these
in a wooden box as well.
Peter, you can show them the wooden box,
but I'll throw these in a wooden box.
But this is some original packaging.
And again, these have been in my possession.
So they've been kept cool down in the root cellar.
You should have good, good viability on these.
Okay, so, so a couple of things.
Here's an update.
So everybody who does not have Venmo,
the PayPal, I'm going to put it in the chat
cause it's not the, it doesn't roll off your tongue.
The CAP 9159.
So PayPal CAP 9159.
9159 at AOL.com.
So if you make a donation there as well.
So basically we have Venmo and PayPal.
Hopefully that covers most people.
If not, just hit us up after
and we'll figure out a third option.
G-Unit, G-Unit.
Did G-Unit win?
No.
Oh.
Oster Hoosier won with 200.
Nice.
You guys are awesome.
Okay, so let me just quickly.
So Oster Hoosier won that, right?
Yep.
All right, let me just log that.
And Mr. Trees, you want to go next?
Absolutely.
Okay, so hold on one.
All right, yeah.
Tell us what you want to donate and.
Read it to me and I'll get it started here.
Yeah, man, we can do lots of things.
I want to be kind of crazy too.
I want to, you know, I want to help.
So I was thinking,
I was thinking about putting up a PAM 15 clone.
Pure PAM 15 clone.
If you're in the US,
you know, we can work something out.
But yeah, so I was thinking, yeah.
Sorry, just quickly before you go with that.
Oster Hoosier won for 200, right?
Right.
And then what was the first pack?
The Key Lime?
Key Lime Frappe.
The Key Lime Frappe was for how much?
It was 150, but we're working right now.
Jack Fields, 150.
Okay, sorry.
Okay.
And this is?
130, I think.
130 for Jack Fields.
Yeah, 130.
Sorry, 130, okay.
Peter, when they get in touch with you,
you can just forward me that email, yeah?
Yep.
Perfect.
I'm sure you guys include your safe mailing addy
that you want that to show up at.
So we're doing PAM 15 clone.
We can do, yeah.
I mean, well, if you want, it just depends.
If we're gonna press on and do this
and you wanna keep that for later on,
I definitely wanna put one of those up.
I also wanna put up the pack of PAM BXs too.
I wanna do another pack of those PAM BXs up there.
So depends on, like I said,
I don't know how many people are here.
I don't know what's gonna be the best way
to get the best war going on for Nick.
You know what I mean?
We got 195 people watching.
Let's do the PAM BX real fast
and we'll hang on the phone for a little bit.
Well, actually, this is amazing
because I can just copy paste the graphic
I created for Friday night.
So you are, look at you guys being nice to me.
Trying to be nice to you, Peter.
I would say that, just to say too,
I'm gonna option off to get everyone that's watching.
I'm gonna option off a selection
of the Cherry Pi BX crossline ones
that I'm currently going through.
I'm going through about 900 of them.
I've pulled every mail and saved every mail.
I'm gonna be searching through the mails separately.
I'm doing this one really, really proper.
And so I'm gonna have,
I know I'm gonna have multiple selections in this.
They are by far the stinkiest plants
that I've handled all year.
And I've handled about 6,000 seedlings this year
from all my friends.
And it's a range from fruit to dank all over the place.
So I know there's gonna be a number of selections,
but I'm gonna option off.
Someone can go down on the auction
and they can choose whatever female and or male
that they want, and I'll profile them and categorize them.
Nice.
Josh, can you text me what that is?
And then I'll create a graphic for it.
And in the meantime, is this what we're auctioning?
Sorry, is it gonna be a 25 pack?
Yeah, yeah, we can do 25.
That's fine.
Thank God.
Make it lovely for you, brother.
Remember me.
Yeah.
You'll be one of the first ones to know.
So yeah, so people that don't know,
go to my Instagram, check out the old Pam.
Absolutely divine.
This was my bat cross,
my male selection from the F2 generation.
Went back onto the original Pam one.
That has brought out even more strength
in her already strong genetic profile.
Statures and all those things are really, really,
pretty damn spot on uniform.
You're gonna get a taller, stretchy sativa type plant.
Lots of crazy branching, extreme vigor.
Easy cloner, cloner in 10 days or less
in most of the plants.
Killer resistance, Pam one frost.
This is a breeding stock that I don't release.
This is charity stuff.
They only go for charity, period.
I've had a number of people email me asking me,
can I get Pam BXs, Pam BXs?
And this is strictly a charity.
It's my breeding stock.
It's stuff that I use to craft
and continue stabilizing my Pam line.
So this will probably be the last time
that the Pam BXs are available
since I've let 225 packs go.
So I need to keep as many numbers as I can for myself
to finish off the project properly.
So truth be told, this is probably your, what was that?
What do you wanna start this one at?
Let's start it at 200.
There you go.
Okay.
Here we go.
Yep, so this will be, like I said,
this will be 99% sure
there ain't gonna be any more Pam BXs released
unless I'm losing my arm or one of you guys are,
you know what I'm saying?
It's one of those special things.
So it's definitely not your cookie.
It ain't no cake.
It ain't a kush.
It's typically I've tracked it down
to a Western Himalayan whaling valley type land race.
We're very damn close to it.
Only one or two steps removed from that.
Strong, strong, strong morphological characteristics
from that region.
It's higher elevation.
So you get that extra resin, that extra sheen,
that little extra something, lots of incense,
lots of fruit, lots of grape.
I always say the Pam one is, you know,
the big league two bubble gum, the grape flavor
with some skunk on the background or some musty BO
or something wrong with that.
You know, it's that bang on, you know,
great, you know, big league two bubble gum
with this skunkiness to it on the end
or this dark mustiness.
Back crossnets, you know, they, like I said,
she's already got strong morphological characteristics.
All the generations usually look,
you can spot Pam a mile away no matter what generation
or what cross you're looking at.
She's a dominator.
Fish and ass plant, you're looking outdoors.
You're looking plants from six to 12 foot,
usually leaning on the nine to 10, nine to 11 foot realm.
Lots of purple stem characteristics in the other lines.
This being a back cross to Pam,
you're gonna have less of the purple stem popping out.
In this one, you're gonna have a little bit, yeah,
there you go.
So there's some stuff right there.
You got the purple petioles, giant sativa type leaves,
prayers, man, absolute prayers.
Look how big they are compared to those gyros.
Yeah, they are prayer.
They're just a fair amount of dollar.
Yeah, and they will go.
I always tell people, man, if you want to plant,
you grow the trees outside
and you really wanna put some love and some care
into making a Mac Daddy tree
that you can lay and read a book under,
the Pam will do it with resin production up the wazoo.
You'll get some good spears on there, nice, thin,
dense spears.
Pam one has got very modern bud structure,
really dense, travels well, bags well, flashy,
lots of colors, pinks, gunmetal blues, purples.
It gets black and blue if you let it go long enough.
It's the most colorful plant.
That's how she got her name.
She's always got lipstick, always got red lipstick,
always got color, always got makeup on.
One of the prettiest plants you'll see in the garden
in a lot of cases.
All said is done, you're looking at a tough,
durable, breed stock machine.
It's something you can weave and steal things from.
It's something you could plug into something
that's really squat and nasty
and be able to see all of her progeny in there
and pull them out or keep them,
whatever you're looking for.
It's a great tool to use
depending on what you're looking to do with her.
So like I said, it's gonna be probably the last one
that goes out.
And it hurts me a little bit, but I'm happy to do it.
And it's, like I said, it's gonna make people happy.
So anybody gets a hold of it,
you're gonna have something fun.
It's gonna help you in a multitude of ways.
And you get me to answer questions
and all that jazz too if you want.
You got it.
That's me.
Hey, Mr. Tree, isn't that, that Pam is like
when you had it tested against different genetics and stuff
it had like the most unique markers
of any plant out there, yeah?
Yeah, so it has basically the chemotype is a,
it's not a rare chemotype,
but chemical makeup of the plant.
It's on the spectrum of rare and regular
at the more close rare side.
If you're looking at the graphs that they provide,
it's closer to the rare side than is the regular,
but it is a regular chemotype.
It doesn't make any unusual type chemicals,
like no unusual type terpenes or anything
that they picked up on that scan,
but it's family history out of the thousands of plants
that they tested, it didn't match
with any of the family lineage.
So it stood on its own in the galaxy
with its own little bubble
and didn't have any plants directly related to it
that had been tested into the system.
So if you're looking at do-si-do or GMO
or whatever in the galaxy,
basically you'll see that in the middle as the star,
the do-si-do in the middle,
and then there'll be a ring around that
and there'll be all these other little plants
with these dots, the cushes and those, it's relatives.
And then beyond that, you'll have an extended family
and you'll have all these other plants around that
that made up the secondary family
that made up that center dot.
She sat alone.
There was no information.
There was no link with any other plants
that were tested in that system.
So that tells me two things.
Number one, we need a lot more plants to be tested
because there's gaps in the genome,
just like there's gaps if you're testing ancestry.com
and you're testing yourself,
there's gaps of certain people
that haven't had their genes tested
and they're not in the map yet.
But it also told me that she's special and she's rare
and not a lot of fricking people grow that.
And it's not something that pops up.
It's not something that's been bred with.
It's something that is kind of on its own island
and is now being re-weaved into the system.
So I've kept her around for six,
I'll come on seven years now as the clone
and I've been working her in all directions
from self-in to out-crossing to in-crossing
to all I've done, everything under the sun,
which has taught me where she came from originally.
And I'm gonna put up a post too of her relatives.
I've got a couple of pictures of who she's related to
in that valley from the Indian Land Race Exchange.
Guy Deepak, I believe his name is, cool dude.
He sent me some cool pictures that just,
it's bang on, that's grandma.
You know, so you'll be able to kind of see
where she comes from, what she does,
but ultimately it is one of them Himalayan sativas,
higher elevation, fun stuff.
It's not extremely long flowering.
You're looking at, you know, I mean,
in a perfect world, you take her 10 or 11 weeks.
That's where I like her.
That's where she gets the most rich, the most developed.
You'll get the most complexity.
You'll get the best out of her,
but you can start pulling her down a lot earlier than that.
I start pulling her down seven and a half, eight weeks.
When green is rare, she'll go through those phases
where she'll flush up and all her hairs will be beautiful
and she'll be all greasy and then they'll die down
and it'll look ripe and there'll be all these golf balls
up down the stem and you can pull her down
at any one of those points
and you'll get slightly different profiles
and slightly different fruits to accurate as it goes along.
It's obviously better to take it all the way,
but like I said, I'm no stranger to pulling her down
at eight weeks, you know, without feeling bad, you know,
it does the job and it's always showy in the bag.
It's always showy on the screen.
She's a gem.
She's one of those gems.
So whoever gets her, keep her alive, share her,
get her going, you know, so it's up to the few.
The winner was Dimples Sanchez.
Dimples Sanchez.
For $5.50.
Nice, nice.
That'll help out.
And so Dimples, you can, Dimples and everybody else,
you can go to Venmo or PayPal and Dimples for your,
the PAM, you'd put in $5.50, but for everybody else,
just remember for 30 to 50 bucks,
or even if you want to donate 51 or 55 or 60
or whatever it is, you will get a pack of ITAL Foundation.
Let me just quickly go to it.
I need to add the-
Yeah, hit me up too.
The PayPal.
Winner, winner, hit me up in some fashion,
send me an email.
I'll connect you guys once I hear from them.
And I'm gonna update this slide with the PayPal as well.
So basically everyone let me know if this covers most of you
if you can do Venmo or PayPal,
or if you live in a country like North Korea
where you have neither of those options, let us know.
But anyway, let me update this slide.
And I think Josh, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
So you want to do yours next?
Sure, I was just responding to some folks here.
They were asking if we can ship to Canada.
And I think it's dependent on the item.
Like so seeds, yes, generally that's no problem.
If it's a slip, we could try,
but it's a lot more difficult
just because the timing takes a long time to get through.
And so that's, especially with COVID,
if you would ask me three months ago,
I've been like, oh yeah, we can do it.
We'll pay whatever, but with COVID,
I've been paying the two day and it takes 30 days.
That's the reality.
So seeds are safe in that manner,
especially this time of year,
everything's really cooling down.
And so wherever they are, they're gonna be fine.
Totally agree.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, so I'm gonna auction up.
I was just mentioning earlier,
Kev, we've talked about it on the live
before Kev sent me the cherry pie.
So these are, this is work that Jackson kind of made
and then Kev took the genetics and made some crosses with.
So the female was a cherry pie cross.
I was a cherry pie female crossed onto the cherry west
and the cherry west was, if I remember correctly,
a bag seed from cherry pie that the Jackson remade
and kind of started back crossing into cherry pie,
found a good male.
So it's a cherry pie back cross essentially.
And then he gave the beans from that to Kev
and then Kev took the lime one, which was from seed.
And he crossed that onto this and gave me the seeds.
And so nobody else has these.
It was really fucking cool of Kev to send them to me
and I'm doing a big sift on them
and I'm quite honored to have this stuff.
And so I'm doing it proper and I'm saving all the males
and all the females separately
and I'm gonna grow them both out
before I make selections on either.
And then what I'm offering is clone or clones.
I'll offer a pair if we wanna do a pair,
a male and a female of whoever bids and wins the bid,
whatever they wanna choose, I'll let them choose.
I'll end up categorizing the different,
what I find at the different sections essentially.
I won't keep everything, but I'll keep,
I know there's gonna be a fruitier version.
I know there's gonna be a stinkier, dank version.
As I've moved the plants around,
they are the stinkiest plants.
I haven't even stem rubbed them,
just moving them around.
They're the stinkiest plants I've held
in the garden this year.
And by the way, you could go out to the garden
and show us, right?
Yeah, we can go, we can walk out there.
They just got there in the heat
and they're all fucking flopped over, but.
Yeah, definitely we can go out there
and see what's going on.
But it's gonna be, like I actually have all the males,
I'll show you guys, are pulled out in cities
and I'm gonna be able to show you guys
I'll show you guys are pulled out
and sitting in my like aquaponics stream,
the roots are, and they're just kind of hanging out
so I can repot them.
Cause I put three seeds per pot
so that when I would go to place them in the greenhouse,
I would be assured or for the most part
to have a female per space
and I could just pull out the males.
And so I was able to do that in transplanting.
And now I'm actually gonna just put them
into a good veg moment for about three or four weeks
before I flip them into flour
cause they already triggered in the flour
a little bit naturally.
So I was able to sex the males
and then get them in a good veg and then flip them.
That's gonna be exciting sift, honestly,
just like I was saying, based upon the smell
that I was seeing, there's definitely a lot of variation
but they're really strong.
It's like, oh, that's berry, berry fucking clear.
That's rank, you know,
you have rank part of cherry pie for sure.
And then there's some really zesty ones, you know?
And so I'm excited to see what the females look like
for sure.
And yeah, so this is,
and I'm not gonna be giving out cuts of this stuff either.
And I'm gonna be making crosses with this
so that the selections that I make,
I'll be taking to make into stuff.
And cause it's essentially Jackson's work.
And I wanna honor, you know, what he did.
And I'm really grateful that I have it.
It's Jackson and Kevin's work.
And yeah, it's a kinda,
you could kinda call it a kissing cousin to cherry limeade.
It's not exactly that.
It's a different version of the cherry pie.
And it's a slightly different version of the lime.
The lime that was used in the cherry limeade
was black lime reserve, which had the chem put onto it.
So this is a male, female, clone pair?
US only?
Yep, US only.
All right, where do you wanna start with that?
This one, I don't know.
I don't wanna be too arrogant.
It's hard.
Like I always make everyone do it to themselves,
but you know, it's hard cause you don't wanna be arrogant.
But I'm not gonna be releasing this at all
out of respect for these guys.
But I know that they would all be down
to do something like this for auction.
And so I think, you know,
back on the box is a really honest,
you know, is a good starting point, you know?
Yeah, it's fair.
Hands down.
You're in a pair.
Yeah, it's a really-
You're gonna be able to continue the generations,
you know?
Yeah.
That's even more power than before, you know?
Yeah, so it's like, you know,
you could take those and go this way,
take those and go this way.
And that's what I'm gonna do.
And then I'll end up making selection from that
and then doing crosses, you know?
So I will kind of make my own cultivars out of this.
Yeah, the only thing that'll differentiate
is the selection, yeah, yeah.
Right, but that's how we do it.
And you can go a lot, I mean, you can camp, you know?
You can go to a lot of different directions.
That's what's fun.
And just as a reminder for everybody
who's priced out of things like this,
you can donate 30 to 50 bucks
or 51 to 60, whatever you can afford.
So Nick, is that the correct?
I hope the email address is right.
KAP9159 at AOL.com for the PayPal?
Shannon's saying yes.
Okay, thank you, Shannon.
And really like, guys, I appreciate it.
And I got tons of seeds.
I already put them up here.
We're literally sitting outside of a CVS pharmacy
waiting on my mom to transfer money
to pay for antibiotics right now
just because the healthcare system is what it is.
I don't know how to, to people who have never been sick
and you ever get sick, it is scary.
There are antibiotics that are upwards of $3,000.
There are medicine that you take,
antivacute, malaria medication that is $600
for a fluid that lasts for four days.
What's funny is they make this in a dog
that you can get for about,
for dogs you can get it for about $40.
But you run into problems doing that.
I've tried to do it that way.
We're in a situation where we'll be fine
with harvest in a few weeks.
I'm not gonna be able to use my arm for, I don't know.
We'll do surgery again Friday, I guess,
or they'll cut stuff out.
I got a drain installed in there right now.
Necrotizing fasciitis, flesh eating bacteria.
Tax people with autoimmune disorders.
I have multiple from the tick bite.
So we're going home.
I'm trying to get activated charcoal in me.
I don't like being on opiates.
I have to be right now due to the situation.
I've, if anybody's got any advice
on how to not be as doped up,
but to get the pain relief where it's not bombing,
I'm down to listen,
because opiates aren't my thing.
I appreciate the love from people.
I know a lot of people need help.
I keep battling that stuff.
I help others out and I swear I'll do an auction
to help others in a couple of weeks.
We just got to get through harvest.
And this wiped us out and came out of nowhere.
I mean, just three days ago,
we were posting pictures of four days ago,
big trees in the backyard and talking to Tyler
about throwing the Pam into flower.
But it's, you know,
some people always say the world comes in threes.
I don't believe that shit just happens.
You know, and I deal with a lot of microbes.
I brew a lot of teas.
I have autoimmune disease.
I was off my proper RSO
and trying other things out and infections happen.
So I appreciate you guys stepping up.
I reached out to Josh,
like I just need to call up with 300 more
to get the antibiotics,
but that wipes us out.
We're going to have to hire somebody to help Shannon.
Cause the problem is she now full care goes into me.
I can't even use the fingers.
So we got a good harvest that'll come down.
I can pay this back in a thing.
And I do have-
I hate bro.
No stress brother.
We got you.
I mean, waste breath,
talking about paying back.
It's all good brother.
I love you guys.
I love what you do.
I have a,
this disease did create a little bit
of mental instability in me.
You know, PTSD, I go in the hospital.
If it wasn't for these videos,
I'd be sitting there.
I don't make mobile hash.
I don't do that stuff for all.
Let me hop in for a sec, Nick.
With this bid is ending.
And I just want to say,
I appreciate your guys' bidding,
but with the offering,
I'm also offering my time to,
however you want, you know,
you'll get me on DM and you'll get,
you'll get a bunch of that.
So I'm offering up a male female selection
from the cherry pie lime selection.
Just quickly, Nick,
where in Michigan are you?
I'm in Saginaw.
So.
Okay.
Cause we have some Michigan people watching
who could probably come and help out.
I really appreciate you guys donating.
Thank you guys for bidding on this.
We're up to 1100 bucks.
Thank you very much.
Look, I love you all.
I got to get off here.
I'm so nauseous.
Yeah, go for it, Nick.
We got you.
We got you.
Take care brother.
Before you go.
I do want to say something, man.
Like PTSD and stuff from this tick bite,
my brain's swelling.
Listening to all the future cannabis podcasts
and stuff in there,
I stayed with,
I stay with headphones on.
If y'all ever see me in a hospital,
you'll notice headphones stay on for my clarity.
So thank you for all the content you all do.
Tyler, I was listening to you talk about the PAM
and everything again last night.
I watched the Emerald Mountain stuff
and GW smoke break.
This content people put out is important.
So, I mean,
just thank you all.
And I'm sorry I had to ask,
but thank you all.
Nick,
Nick, have Shannon look into Jamaican Dogwood for pain.
What's, I will do, man.
I'll reach out to you on Instagram soon, brother.
Hit me up, man.
It's a low dose herb,
but it works, dude.
Just hit me up anytime.
All right, thanks, man.
Yeah, man.
Bye, Nick.
Fuck, he's going to make me cry.
Yeah, no.
Okay, so thank you.
I wanted to, I'll double down.
I'll double down.
Hold on, I'll double down on this for the top two bidders
if we want to do two of them.
I see some people that are really excited
and I really appreciate that.
So we're kind of hanging in
snipe mode right now.
I'm not following it as well.
But that's cool, man.
We have analog selections at 1200.
So just quickly, Steve,
I sent you the link to jump on.
Thank you to John who made a $30 donation.
I mean, for me, it's amazing.
I mean, Nick's literally at CVS
and we could Venmo and PayPal the money for him
or for Shannon to walk in there
and get his prescription.
And I don't know, I'm sure everybody has.
That's pretty powerful, guys.
Thank you very, very much.
So this is amazing.
And while this stuff's stressful to do live,
it makes, I think, everybody who's watching
and part of it and especially, you know,
the people donating seeds and the people buying.
And I love that we have stuff for people
who just wanna help out with 30 bucks.
So thank you all.
And what are we at right now?
There's still some time for each other.
I've got about 10 minutes before I gotta go do daddy duty.
So I wanna go one more before I go
and then I'll come back when I'm done.
So just wanna put that in there for.
Let's call this one.
And Analog Selection, Sunnyland Grow, and Tricomes Tommy,
if you guys all wanna donate a thousand bucks,
I'll honor that deal with three of you guys.
That's awesome.
I think that's a good way to do it.
I really appreciate all you guys bidding
and helping my buddy out.
That's awesome, man.
Okay, so Analog Selection.
So Analog Selection, I'm just keeping,
I have my spreadsheet.
Analog Selection, who else?
Tommy Tricome.
Sunnyland Grow.
And that was at a thousand each, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you guys.
That's really cool.
Yeah, thanks for that.
That's really cool.
You guys made that one tough on me.
I couldn't just call it, so thanks.
And you guys can come and we can pick those up in person
if you're close.
I know Sunnyland, he lives here in town.
So depending on how we wanna do it,
you can come up and make the selections, dude.
All right, so for the people who won, let me get Nick's,
just give me one second to get this thing back up there.
There we go.
All right.
So that's the Venmo and the PayPal.
The only way to fly.
All right, man, lay the cross on me
and I'm gonna let you go do daddy duty.
Is this gonna be one we've already done on Friday night
or you're gonna make me create something, a new slide?
You can use the same slide and it's just gonna be,
it'll be a cut.
It'll be a cut of the PAM-15.
So use the PAM-15 F3 slide.
That'll show a picture of it and it ain't the seeds.
It's, you know, you go that way.
This, it's a special plant.
No one in the world has it.
There you go.
You got a number?
Yeah, start it.
200.
Start it, yeah, start it, yeah.
Start it at 250.
Nice, look at that boldness.
I like it, the confidence.
Okay, so this is a PAM-15 F3.
It's not a steed pack.
It's just a slit, yeah, it'll be a slit.
Basically, it's not your typical.
So if you grow cookies and you're expecting
to map out your situation in an appropriate way,
don't expect that with the 15.
The 15 is a collector plant.
It's a plant that is an extreme stretching sativa machine
that dumps frost like nobody's business.
It's colorful, is not dense bud, but not fluffy bud.
It's this perfect open airy washing bud, right?
This is old school hashish.
This is Himalayan hillside frigging resin weed right here.
It is a killer plant.
As she gets bigger and healthier,
you can snap off leaves, fan leaves,
and smell the chlorophyll or the blood of the plant.
And it has this nasty bewitched nose twinge spice thing
to it that I've never smelled before quite as strongly
as she does it when she's in just peak happy outdoor form.
You can look online, my Instagram,
there's some recent pictures of some PAM 15s and some stuff.
She's tall.
She'll send up multiple heads
that are just straight up and down.
Like literally just like branch after branch
of these just these spears.
They're very, very sharp, very, very stacky and unwarbly,
but there's something special and you can see it in there.
Her calyxes are huge, extra large calyxes.
Her smoke is, or her sense first,
I guess is more like a really funky smoke shop
with bad, with incense going,
old guys smoking cigarettes with BO
and like some just foul sharpness cheese.
Sometimes some cheeses will come out of there.
It's more of an unpleasant type smell
than it is like, wow, that's,
it's very, very offensive is more of how it smells.
It smokes deliciously.
The nugs are fabulous and long and break off.
And like I said, they're not super, super dense,
so they're perfect for little snappers
and washing and stuff like that is optimal.
But like I said, it's a, this is a collection plant.
You know, this isn't, this isn't one of those things
you're gonna, I mean, you could and somebody will,
and eventually it's gonna be like this boutique type thing.
But like I said, this is something that you're gonna hold.
You're gonna keep, you're just,
you're gonna grow off in the corner
and it's gonna be special to you.
It's more timeless,
it's more like a collection plant.
It's more time loss and kind of thinking weed,
kind of psychedelic in that fashion
where you're just kind of lost in your thoughts
and it's just very, the clock moves like a son of a bitch.
It is delightful.
If the smoke lingers and fills the room.
And if you've ever heard Kev talk about those,
those types of profiles where that smoke just stays
in these certain patterns in these layers.
And it's exactly that when it sits around.
It's a delightful, hazy type plant without the raciness.
It's not racy, it's not couch sloppy, it's euphoric.
It's more euphoric, it's more, like I said,
it's a special one.
Like I said, you can see the pictures,
you can take a look.
She doesn't need anything extra special.
She's very durable, branches are tough,
doesn't have a lot of pest problems or disease.
And if it does get a problem,
then it pretty much shrugs it off
compared to other plants.
If you get like, thrips are one of our biggest problems here
I always say, and if thrips get into stuff,
you'll really just, plants will just look like dog shit,
you know what I mean?
And riddled with all those little scars.
And the Pan 15, she still grows faster
than the thrips can kind of populate.
And she's always putting on a little bit more cleaner growth
and you can kind of get on top of things a little bit.
It's a nuisance because she does grow so well,
so you'll have to up pot pretty frequently.
And she's gonna blow her roots
right through whatever you're doing.
She grows tall and stretchy and will lean over something
because she's got lots of branches
and so she'll be shading other things.
They're not floppy, but they're gonna shade some stuff
just because of her branchy nature and her,
just her, she is probably the closer plant
to that Himalayan land race that I'm always talking about.
The resin that just drips and rips on all the fan leaves
to the end, kind of takes a little bit to get going.
Week three or so is really when she starts
to just throw on the glitz,
which is completely opposite of what Pan 1 does.
But when she throws it out, she throws it out.
And there are these tall, stocked, big heads,
and then small, small stocks,
all kind of packed in together really well.
It's a bitching kind of bitching look.
I always go back and forth, like, you know,
is Pan 1 or Pan 15, which one do I like more?
You know, some days Pan 15 wins, some days Pan 1 wins.
And it's really just, it's how they're grown.
They can have kind of different expressions vastly,
depending on where they're growing, inside or outside.
It's just, it's always the same plant.
But sometimes you get more color.
Sometimes you get more flavor.
Sometimes you'll get more potency.
It's just, it's just, it bounces around
based on your growing techniques.
You know, she really does.
Like in testing for terpenes and things,
you can see that different situations, different places.
One time she'll be dominant in one terpene,
then she'll be dominant in another terpene,
and it just fluctuates too much to say
where her chemical potential is like,
wants to be.
It's like I said, it's a pigeon,
tall, lanky, 12, nine, 12 foot sativa machine.
It'll put you in another world, man.
Pan 15.
How much time was that?
It went for 500.
All right, there we go.
There we go.
Okay, so.
Give me some info.
Yeah, just quickly.
So someone said they were having trouble
paying Nick's PayPal account.
So I'm just online checking to see if that email,
it may be that if he just set it up,
it hasn't, you know, processed the account yet.
Let me just see if I, or can other people see if they can.
I'm trying to find like where to enter someone else's,
send money.
Okay.
Yeah, just hit the send money button.
Put his email in and then on the next page,
it'll tell you.
All right.
Yeah, hit me up with the info.
I gotta go.
Time to roll for me for a little bit.
Yeah, all right.
So one, much appreciated.
That was awesome.
And I actually had my wife's birthday today,
so I'm stressed out.
I have dinner in like an hour or two hours,
but we appreciate it.
We appreciate you stepping up.
Much love.
And we're still going.
But enjoy the kids.
Yeah, hit me up, you guys.
You need some faces.
Hit me up in a little bit.
I'll be free in a little bit,
but I gotta do the regular stuff later.
Yeah.
So, Jett.
Right, you okay?
Not to you, this is to someone else.
Someone had emailed me.
So, yeah, Astro Hoosier.
So I could find Nick's PayPal.
We'll put it in the chat again.
It's just that email address,
but it did locate it.
And I can see that I can enter an amount.
I bought one genetics and the American one
both paid with PayPal and I went to-
So other people are also verified.
Yeah, at top floor genetics,
I see an email from you.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So it's working.
And Cascading, can you put the PayPal email
back in the chat?
And Steve, let's go to you,
but let me make a graphic.
So, potentonic Steve.
I was trying to get back to you, Steve.
I'm glad you got on here.
Sorry, man, I wasn't ignoring you.
Steve, you're muted if you're trying to talk to us.
Yeah, he also said he has crappy reception.
So he, oh, no.
Let me see what his last.
Oh, sorry, they have, oh, there he is.
Sorry about that.
My dog chewed up one of my USB ports
and blew out four of my,
four of the ports in the back of my computer.
So, and took out the cord for my VR.
So I'm pretty pissed off,
but I didn't realize the cord from my mic,
the ports for my mic and my camera were dead.
So I was like, oh,
so it took me a minute to figure out what had happened.
So I apologize.
So yes, I have some blue hats.
So actually, Steve, just before you start,
let me make sure I got the last one.
That, I don't even remember.
That was a family tree.
And that was the, what were we auctioning off?
That was the PAM15.
PAM15.
Okay, and who won it?
Went to U-W-H-A-R-I-E.
We were dogs.
U-N-W-H-A-R-I-E.
Gun dogs.
Gun dogs.
Good God.
Hold on.
Can you post that in the YouTube chat?
Yeah.
He just texted me a screenshot of him.
He already made the donation,
so I'll post that to you.
You worried dogs.
Okay, so he's paid.
Thank you very much.
And that was for how much?
$505.
You are awesome.
All right, and this is,
okay, so Steve, while you're talking about it,
I'm gonna create a graphic in the background.
So start talking and...
Sure.
Sure, so I'm giving away some blue hash seeds
to help Nick out.
Nick actually just was on our show
over on Growing with Fishes on Thursday
and spent three hours with us
talking all about his journey with cannabis.
So it was a lot of fun to get to know Nick a lot better,
but I'm gonna give you a little bit of a tour
I thought I'd pop on and hand out some blue hash.
Blue hash is a strain that I've been growing for a long time.
So I've been growing blue hash since 2013.
Originally started off with a really nice Blue Dream cut,
which was a bread and butter, which is kind of generic,
but we crossed it with the Afghan hash plant
that a buddy of mine had brought back over
that was particularly stinky to try and get
kind of a heavier producing hash plant,
something that would just, you know,
kind of have that profile with that bulk.
And in that, we found some incredible stock.
We have two different lines
that we've kind of developed out of that.
One of them is much thicker in stock
and is a little bit better for outdoor.
The other one is a little bit better for producer
and is really awesome for indoor and for aquaponics.
Five of the seven generations I've done
have been in aquaponics,
with two of them being in soil
on the one half of the lineage,
and then the other one being three in aquaponics
and then switching back to soil
after that, living soil after that.
So that's the, I guess, the story behind those.
They've been, the last two generations
have been bred out by Mr. Green, Gene's Garden
down in San Clemente.
He crossed those for me,
and he does a lot of bulking out for seeds for me,
and he's been pheno hunting a whole bunch of these,
and he's got it down to two really awesome lineages.
And I'll give you some of both to help Nick out.
That's the cherry bomb, Mr. Green, Gene's, right?
Yep.
Yeah, I have, I send him a lot of stuff
when I get my hands on something weird,
and he bulks it out and sends me some love back.
And we've had a pretty long running relationship now.
I had a chance to interview him quite a couple of years ago,
and he's kind of gotten back
into the breeding game since then,
and really starting to produce a lot of stuff.
He actually redid some of the cherry bombs
and did a refresh to some of the old Jack Herrera lines
called Way Back Jack and a bunch of other good stuff.
So he's got a lot of cool stuff
that he's been working on too,
and a great friend of the show and a friend of mine.
And yeah, so he's the one who actually did
the last two generations on these,
and I'm giving these away for anybody that wants them.
So this is two packs?
Yeah, so it'll be, yeah, two packs of 10 each.
Okay.
And it's the blue hash one and the blue hash three,
which are the two lineages that are good.
So, and again, if you're looking to get started
in aquaponics, these are particularly water loving.
The one cultivar, a hash plant,
or a blue hash one is particularly water loving.
And again, almost all of it has been in aquaponics
its whole life.
So it really, really sings in that environment.
So if you're looking to get going in aquaponics,
we've talked about this cultivar
on at least two dozen episodes
of the Growing with Fishes podcast.
And we've never, other than the other time
we did it for Duke Diamond,
I've never given away the seeds
unless you've come and hung out with me.
So definitely.
I just want to echo that that's a really important thing.
I mean, I started the regenerative seed coat
based upon the idea that the biology makes the difference
in the coding on the biology
and inside the seed makes the difference.
And it definitely makes a difference in AP.
Folks that message me and stuff,
have asked me a number of times,
do you have any specifically?
Because they know I dabble in AP
and they asked me if I have anything
specifically bred in AP.
And we've talked about this, Steve,
that that should be kind of part of protocol,
doing soil specific and AP specific kinetics.
The same thing, but working them
in those directions side by side.
Absolutely.
The plants get a little more used to the nitrate over ammonia
and get a little bit more used to having
that extra water pressure around all the time.
The blue hash or say the blue dream mother
that we got from this cultivar
was actually a very heavy, thick stock,
almost like a hemp stock plant.
And it was doing just fine,
without any support at all until we trellised.
It was one of the last plants we trellised,
but we didn't have a single broken branch on it.
And it was the largest nug with by far,
almost like a freakish extra 20% size on the stems.
And that's the reason why we chose her
because we wanted something that would really do well
in the wind on the front range.
If we put something in a higher wind environment
in Colorado, something that would actually
tolerate it and take it.
What's a good starting number
and I can kick this thing off?
Whatever you guys wanna start it off at.
That's fine.
250, 200?
Let's start with 250.
And Steve, look at the screen.
Does that look accurate?
Yep, yep.
I did the first five generations in aquaponics,
last two have been in soil.
Yep, absolutely.
All right.
And for everybody who can't afford this stuff,
and you just wanna make a donation.
How many generations is this Steve
that you've been working on this one?
This is an F7.
So I did the first cross back in 2013
of this particular lineage.
And I know that-
All in AP, seven generations.
Yeah, all in aquaponics, the first five generations.
And then the last two have just been
with Mr. Green Jeans doing the last two generations
from me since I went to Africa basically.
So nice.
Cool.
So this is for everybody who donates 30 or more.
You could also donate a dollar and get some gratitude.
Yeah, and just to, Nick pops on here
and it's really hard for him to accept money.
And he wants to try to compensate and give back,
which is one of the reasons I love him.
But I texted him and said,
hey man, this is one trip to the pharmacy
that you're talking about here.
How long is this gonna last?
You're gonna need another one.
And like, it takes time to harvest, dry,
hear, process, get paid.
So I really appreciate my guests to say that.
I really appreciate you guys, like everything,
all the donators, everyone putting in money.
Thank you very much.
You know, it's really fucking cool.
If you guys break 500,
I'll throw in some Zimbabwe land race
that I picked up in Anyanga too.
Okay, and this is what we're on now.
I figured I'd throw a little sweetener in.
So Ian said you're like a wizard
when it comes to aquaponics and microbiology.
Thanks man.
I appreciate all the love the community gives us.
It's oftentimes can be easy to listen to that one negative,
but yeah, you gotta listen to the 10,
the 100 good voices, you know?
All right, and then Kaya had the twofer that's coming up.
So a double pack coffee cubed,
which is Kaya's coffee F1, cross with coffee.
And then a Matterhorn.
So we can do that next.
All right, so we got a minute 30.
Let me see if we have any.
Thank you, Jacob.
Thank you, John.
I don't know if people want their last names used, but.
Yeah, the one thing I will say about
that I noticed about the Zimbabwe land race
is it's ultra high and alpha piney,
which seems to be something
that everyone's kind of chasing right now.
I have no idea on the flowering times,
so don't ask me on that,
but the bud that I smoked and the seeds that I got
from the buds that I smoked are amazing
and very old school sativa, that real cerebral high.
Thank you, Ian.
Thank you, Sunnyland Grow.
Thank you, Danny.
Thank you, Casey.
Wow, yeah, these are some big,
okay, so Ostro Hoosier,
some advice for other people on PayPal.
If people are paying by credit card,
they should choose the purchase rather than personal option.
Thank you, Mr. E.
Josh.
Thank you, John.
In Indiana.
Tim in Santa Rosa, California.
Thank you.
Thank you, Noah.
Yeah, no, this is amazing.
And then, so this is what we're bidding on right now.
And then for everybody else,
if you just wanna make a donation of any amount,
that's where you can make a donation.
All right, what's our timer at?
That one's sold for $2.50 to Greg H.
Lone Stoner, stop with the names.
I'm trying to thank the people who made donations.
We can take a minute to thank them.
Yeah, and go ahead.
No, sorry, what did you just say?
Did we have a winner for this or not yet?
Yeah, we did.
We did.
Did we have a winner for this or not yet?
Yeah, Greg H. with $2.50.
Thanks, Greg, for supporting Nick.
But I wanna thank again, Sunnyland and Analog Genetics.
Well, where is it, Analog?
I didn't write it down.
Selections.
Analog Selections.
And try to contact me.
I haven't received your donation yet,
or I haven't received a notification of it in DM,
but I've messaged with the other three guys.
So I appreciate you guys.
Thank you so much.
It's fucking cool.
They all did it.
We're able to do it into his Venmo.
So it's immediately available to him.
So he doesn't need his mom's money.
Appreciate you guys.
That's really cool.
And his mom doesn't have it to share.
So it's not like, you know.
Okay, so do you wanna...
Should we go to Kaia's next one?
Yeah.
Sorry, and this last one was $2.50 to Greg H., right?
Okay, so of course Kaia's not on.
All right, let me...
Yeah, Greg, yeah, hit, or let me just check my email.
Thank you to Coyote for $30 donation to Nick.
For the wrap mixtape.
All right, let me...
Oh, cool.
Okay, I already created the graphic for this.
All right, Josh,
you're gonna have to be the hype man for this one
because he's not on with us right now.
So this is what's going up next.
Boom.
So this is a twofer.
And so it's a double pack.
You get both.
And he even sent me some pictures.
Okay, so first up,
that's the Matterhorn.
And then here comes the coffee.
So that coffee,
Matterhorn,
and you get both.
So should we start this at 300?
Sorry, I was talking,
I was talking and I didn't realize I was muted.
I was telling you all about it or what I thought.
Yeah, start from the top again.
So I haven't grown the coffee,
but I've smoked the coffee.
And I've talked with Kaya a bit about it.
I'm still thinking, he's been working the BX,
the coffee in all different directions.
And that his mentor, he's talked about it,
Lemon Oko, who's out here in the Northwest as well,
told him, which is pretty good advice,
that if you could do one cultivar in your lifetime,
that's about all you have time for.
And just to make sure you,
whatever else you do to make sure you keep focusing
on doing this thing.
And so coffee is that for Kaya, for sure.
He's done it in,
in generations.
He's back-crossed it a few different ways.
This one is the coffee cubed.
It's this female onto the BX3 male
back onto his original female selection.
And it's, for me, I got to smoke it.
It was definitely in a good moment in time.
I was really happy and excited.
It was a bunch of cool dudes.
But it represents what I really like in weed.
The reason, it's like the reason I like Gorilla Glue
is the same reason I like the coffee.
And similar to the Dog Walker has that in there too.
You know, it's the same thing that the TK has
that is that sort of side of Kush
and that side of Chemdog in my mind,
you know, just flavor-wise.
Even though I don't think there's any Chemdog
in this, in the coffee.
I think it's, I don't know what the background on it is.
I think it's something with,
maybe something with the freeze and something with alien.
I know he has worked with some alien Kush genetics.
And then the Matterhorn is that BX,
that same BX3 male back onto the TK.
So if you like Gorilla Glue
and you like cooking Dog Walker and TK,
this is like one of those,
just it's like that turned up, you know, and it's fresh.
Being that it's not a cut,
it doesn't have any of the bullshit
that comes with, you know, cuts being passed around.
I'd hop all over them.
I haven't had a chance to pop them or run them at all.
You know, if I had, I don't even actually have the beans.
If I did, I'd have already popped them.
Trust me on that.
So did we get any, where are we at here in action?
300?
Jameson Wellborn.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were part of the crew
that worked on in promoting,
or I can't remember the exact affiliation,
but you're with the crew that's doing the documentary.
The GW Smoke Break from Mandelbrot one?
No, no, no.
Shoot, someone put it in the chat for me.
I'm horrible at remembering things.
It's about, it's a movie about the environment
and there's three or four characters
that have gone their way to make an impact
in climate change.
And it's really powerful.
It's really powerful.
Like, you know, the need to grow.
Thanks, James, Jameson.
The need to grow.
I recommend everyone watch it, check it out, share it.
There's lots of documentaries out there
that sparked me into growing regeneratively
and learning down this path.
But this one, they just came out with it
like within the last year, year and a half.
So just quickly, I had talked to the directors
about having them come on.
So that reminds me to follow up
and we'll bring them on in the next couple of weeks.
It's if we can get the guy.
It's this guy, Rob Herring
and Eric Cutter, Michael Smith.
Oh yeah, so Eric Cutter and Michael Smith,
I think they're the people featured.
And then Rosario Dawson, I think was one of the producers
and Rob Herring was the director.
Cool.
That's really powerful.
And one of the guys that stuck out
that they featured in the documentary
was a guy that built this really cool greenhouse system
and it had aquaponics involved.
And it was kind of like a, almost like a geodome
or whatever it was, that Pauly Shore movie, Biodome.
It was kind of like a biodome, but it worked
and he had it successful.
And then something happened and it burned down
and he's rebuilt it.
It's a really powerful story.
I just want to pump it up because it moved me.
And thanks for bidding, Jameson.
But we got some snipes coming in.
Nicola Davis.
If Hash people is watching, I'm responding to you now.
I thought I had, he was one of the winners.
Okay, so sorry.
What item are we on right now?
I'm like doing 18 things at once.
We're on the coffee.
The double pack coffee cube.
Oh wait, sorry.
Kaya came back in.
He's connecting to his audio.
He's going to be like, dude,
you just botched that whole thing.
I'm like, I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
You just botched that whole thing.
It's none of those things.
Yeah.
Now these people are like, what?
Yeah, Steve, I'm just seeing your chat.
Yeah, let's do it.
I just pinged the director again.
And then also the documentary that Kevin was in,
I had talked to the woman who directed that.
And I was thinking of getting her, Kevin,
and then the French woman who is the wine grower on,
but it was a cool documentary.
It was a nice like.
Yeah, you got to get Nikona on too, man.
What's that?
You got to get Nikona on too.
Who's Nikona?
Joe's your son, Kev's son.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
Nico.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, sorry, did we wrap?
Oh, sorry, there's Kaya.
So did we wrap that or is it still?
It wrapped up at 375.
Okay.
Dave's not here.
Dave's not here, man.
All right, this was Pacific
and this was the two pack coffee.
It was a steal, absolute steal.
Yeah.
And the Matterhorn.
And that was for 350?
375.
375.
You're looking out, y'all.
And sorry, and that was to who?
Dave's not here.
Dave, space, Z not here.
Where are you, Dave's not here.
Oh, yeah, he won.
He won a couple of days ago, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
There was a well-born,
something well-born on there, also bidding on that.
Jamison.
Yeah, I think that guy is a guy
that sent me a care package of some coffee stuff.
So if he wanted to get in on that too,
I would match him up with that guy.
If he wanted to get in on that too,
I would match that.
You could have two winners.
I'll send them both each the double pack for the same deal
and we can double up the money
if Mr. Wellborn wants to do that.
I'll watch for his reply, man.
Sure, just throwing it out there.
There's a little bit of a delay between when we're talking.
Jamison Wellborn.
Well, I think Nicola Davis also did 370.
Yep.
I'd match it three ways or two ways.
All right, so why don't we bring Dave down to 370?
If the other two step up, Dave will get it for 370
and Nicola and Jamison,
or even if one of the two steps up,
you'll all get it for 370.
Otherwise, Dave is the sole exclusive winner.
How many Cs in each pack, Groset asks?
There's a little extra Cs in there,
so you're probably gonna get 12 in these ones.
These are the newest ones out.
Ballpark 12.
All right, so we'll wait for them.
As we're all...
Sorry, Nicola, what...
All right, so Nicola, if you're willing to do your 370,
you got it and you'll be helping out Dave's not here
also get it for 370 instead of 375.
Nicola, do you want the two pack?
Thank you, Dave, you rock.
And Kaya will throw a little extra something
in there for you.
Always.
Always looking out for you guys.
Thank you.
Dave's already paid the 375.
So Nicola, if you're down for 370 and...
Yeah, Michelle's asking,
did PayPal go into an account for Kimberly?
I think that's the name on the account, correct?
Yeah, it's Kimberly.
Sorry, let me just look at one of the screenshots I got.
It's Kimberly something.
Nicola agreed, Waynone Jameson.
Awesome.
Super cool, you guys.
Let's get this taken care of
and get this guy his much needed prescriptions filled.
Let him get on his way.
Appreciate it.
Okay, so sorry, that...
All right, so we have Dave's not here.
And then...
Nicola Davis for 370.
Nicola Davis, right?
370.
Davis, yeah.
And then did the third person respond or no?
I'm waiting on Jameson's though.
Okay.
Jameson, if you're there.
Hey, Peter, just let me know on that.
Either way, I'll take care of him.
I gotta step out again.
We're gonna go check out Mike.
He's fighting tonight on the UFC contender.
You guys got ESPN plus, check him out.
Oh, wait, so sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, so explain that.
Cause I saw the text and I was like, what's this for?
Yeah, yeah.
My wife's nephew.
Yeah, my wife's nephew, Juan Martinez.
He's a fighter out of Houston, Texas.
And he's been doing karate and jiu-jitsu since he was six.
And he's getting his shot tonight on the UFC contender.
He's fighting, I'm not sure the guy's name,
but he's fighting for a UFC contract.
So we're gonna check him out.
There he is, boom.
Tonight at five o'clock.
So coming up soon, ESPN plus, if you got it, tune in
and send some positive vibes his way for a win.
Cool.
Awesome, thanks Peter.
Y'all are awesome.
That makes more sense.
Cause you had sent that to me with no context
and I was like, okay.
Sorry, sorry.
Met him myself.
Anyways, thank you guys for putting in the time
and the effort to get me out there.
All right.
Thanks for the donations
and I'll let you know who to send what to.
Thanks Peter.
Bye.
Okay.
Okay, so it looks like,
okay, Ethan Savage, you wanna step up for that third pack?
Is it hanging on Kaya's?
That's weird.
Okay, is Ethan?
Cool, all right.
Thank you, Ethan.
Ethan, just putting you in my screen.
Spreadsheet at 370.
Cool.
Well, do you guys mind if we wrap for today here?
Cause I got a,
and try to-
Yeah, no, this, you guys-
Yell that for my wife's birthday dinner.
Thanks for taking time and just on the fly,
like it's fucking cool.
Well, no, I mean,
we have a powerful ability to just bring people together.
I mean, this was spur of the,
how many people are watching right now?
I have no idea.
248 right now.
Yeah, it's so cool everybody.
Like it's really awesome.
And, you know, I was honestly struggling inside.
I was like, is this,
are we gonna wear our welcome with doing these auctions here
and everyone just keeps stepping up.
So it's really awesome.
And thank you.
So just quickly before we close for everyone,
even just five bucks,
you know, it helps.
It's, it pays for something at CVS
and we can have a commentary on the US healthcare system
and the fact that we need to do stuff like this
and you don't need to do stuff like this.
And pretty much every other first world country
but in the very short term, we need to help someone out.
So every dollar helps, every dollar counts.
And if you donate above 30 bucks,
that is what you'll get.
And just let us know that you made the donation
and we'll get those packs out to you.
And independent of all the donate,
the just kind of not winning.
So I guess just the auction,
we just raised in two hours, right?
Or however long we've been on,
almost $6,000 independent of all the 5, 10, 20, 30,
$50 donations.
So, I mean, that it makes me wanna cry.
Nick doesn't have to work.
That's awesome.
Yeah, cause if he's gonna end up having to do
the another one of these in a week,
and that's the reality.
So it's fucking cool.
So, from 619, I wanna send a donation
but how will I confirm it's sent?
Well, just go to PayPal or Venmo
and if it's Venmo, it's nick-risden
is the name you're searching for PayPal.
Just put in that email address,
make any sort of donation
and you should see a confirmation from,
yeah, so Cascadian just put it in the chat as well.
But I'll leave that up and everybody have a good night.
And this, yeah, I mean, just the past week
has it's been a lot of work, but it's been amazing.
I mean, we've as a community, when I say we,
we've helped people who lost their farms to fire.
We've helped a nonprofit that's been doing good work,
not just in the Santa Cruz community,
but globally for decades to feed people in need
and today we helped a brother out
who could really use some help
and who helps a lot of other people
even though he is going through a lot of shit himself.
So that's why when Nick talks about paying people back,
everyone's like, dude, just shut up
and because he doesn't need to pay us back.
And we all know that if something happens to one of us,
hopefully other people will step up
in the same way we're doing right now.
So any parting words?
Sorry to your wife and just tell her how much
this means to Nick and we really appreciate
your time and space, Peter.
All right, and with that,
and so you may see us back here tomorrow
or the next day or the next day,
but we'll try to give you a little more notice
than no notice, but with that,
I'll kill the live stream and everybody have a good night
and thanks again for, we really appreciate all the help
for all the people that we as a community
have been stepping up for.
