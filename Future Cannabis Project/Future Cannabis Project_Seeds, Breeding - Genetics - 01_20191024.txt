[00:00.000 --> 00:08.120]  We got all kinds of stuff going on.
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.600]  We're doing a collaboration actually.
[00:10.600 --> 00:14.720]  Adam and I have the Dunmouth collaboration and that's going through seeds here now in
[00:14.720 --> 00:15.720]  the very near future.
[00:15.720 --> 00:18.600]  Amazingly we have all of them on stage right here.
[00:18.600 --> 00:22.320]  We should probably start off with explaining who we are.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.760]  Yeah, let's do that.
[00:26.280 --> 00:30.560]  Obviously everybody knows one of us, I hope.
[00:30.560 --> 00:32.560]  Let's start with you first.
[00:32.560 --> 00:33.960]  Yeah, so my name is James Loud.
[00:33.960 --> 00:36.800]  I've been breeding for over 10 years.
[00:36.800 --> 00:40.360]  I've been working with the plant for over 25 years.
[00:40.360 --> 00:47.360]  I started a company called Loud Seeds in the Netherlands and in Spain in 2013.
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.080]  I'm writing a book on breeding and currently I'm breeding everything regs, fems, auto flower
[00:53.680 --> 00:58.280]  genetics and I'm working on a whole bunch of different projects.
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.280]  Stabilizing genetics.
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.000]  For the longest time I was breeding a lot of F1s like everybody because of the demand
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.560]  and now I'm kind of gearing towards ag product that can be sold to big ag.
[01:11.560 --> 01:18.760]  My name is Adam Dunn and I've been growing since around 93 sort of seriously and that
[01:18.760 --> 01:22.120]  was in Amsterdam.
[01:22.160 --> 01:30.920]  I started a seed company back when it was more because I wanted to bring American genetics
[01:30.920 --> 01:31.920]  to Europe.
[01:31.920 --> 01:37.400]  That was kind of my goal at the time because I felt it was a little stagnant and lo and
[01:37.400 --> 01:43.400]  behold here we are 25 years later and it's like the Europeans are looking towards America
[01:43.400 --> 01:51.520]  again because of the, I feel like the heart and soul of cannabis is sort of here in California,
[01:51.520 --> 01:54.440]  here in America where I live in Colorado.
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.680]  There's spots all over the states but the passion has always been here so I've kind
[01:58.680 --> 02:01.360]  of followed that.
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.280]  When I went to Amsterdam I was 19 years old, didn't realize I was going to be working for
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.120]  Sensi Seeds which I did for about three years and then start my own seed company and it
[02:10.120 --> 02:14.560]  was all based on just seeing that all the customers were American.
[02:14.560 --> 02:20.120]  So here I am an American living in Amsterdam and every guy who walks through the door is
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.840]  living in some small town and got some seeds from Neville a few years ago and now they
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.240]  came back and Neville's nowhere to be found and we filled the void.
[02:29.240 --> 02:36.880]  So it's kind of like those special times make it easy now to kind of interject into the
[02:36.880 --> 02:39.240]  industry as far as it's all cycles.
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.760]  If you're a grower you realize that five years ago people had a different taste and right
[02:45.760 --> 02:52.280]  now the gaps are getting kind of tighter and tighter because less people know what's
[02:52.280 --> 02:54.800]  going on so it's good to be on stage and hanging out with these guys.
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.240]  I met James back in Amsterdam when he came over there.
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.720]  He was also like another wave because it's like every few years a new wave of American
[03:03.720 --> 03:06.960]  growers goes over there and they all have the same sort of thing where they see it because
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.460]  it's like a sea of genetics over there and you kind of get lost in the shuffle.
[03:12.460 --> 03:14.400]  So we're here to kind of clear that up.
[03:15.120 --> 03:15.620]  Cool.
[03:15.620 --> 03:16.620]  I'm James Bean.
[03:16.620 --> 03:19.000]  I'm CEO of seedchairnow.com.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.880]  I run what I believe to be one of the largest seed banks in the states if not the world.
[03:23.880 --> 03:26.720]  I work with 52 breeders.
[03:26.720 --> 03:29.480]  I'm a breeder hunter if you will.
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.920]  One thing about working with all these different breeders is all the breeders I work with all
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.920]  work with a different male.
[03:34.920 --> 03:39.080]  As far as I'm concerned that's the only way to really separate who's doing work, who's
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.760]  not doing work.
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.440]  For instance if you bred with an MK Ultra and crossed it with a Girl Scout cookie I
[03:44.440 --> 03:45.960]  really can't represent that.
[03:45.960 --> 03:47.360]  Like you didn't do any work.
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.440]  You took somebody else's cookie who we'll say St. George.
[03:51.440 --> 03:54.640]  St. George is the cookie I believe.
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.280]  So you took somebody else's cookie and took the MK Ultra and crossed it and put it together
[03:59.280 --> 04:01.280]  and made MK cookies.
[04:01.280 --> 04:02.520]  I don't want to represent that.
[04:02.520 --> 04:03.880]  This guy's not getting paid off of it.
[04:03.880 --> 04:07.000]  I want to represent the guy who did the thing in the first place.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.480]  A lot of the old timers.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.280]  I have to do a lot of sleuthing if you will to figure out the history of things and make
[04:14.280 --> 04:17.920]  sure the stories all collide and make sure they all make sense.
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.000]  But it's been my thing and I've worked with 52 all-American breeders right now.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.960]  So I'm pretty happy about that.
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.800]  Yeah and just to add on breeding with males.
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.240]  I feel like the second you sell seeds, sold lots of different varieties over the years,
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.120]  and the second you sell those seeds, if you have males, I'm totally happy with people
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.400]  using my males.
[04:40.400 --> 04:43.400]  But I feel like there's integrity involved.
[04:43.400 --> 04:46.480]  If you're going to use them to start a seed line, that's different than if you're using
[04:46.480 --> 04:49.960]  them to create other strains.
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.000]  It's again, it's just sort of like it comes down to it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.400]  You can do whatever you want with it, but the minute you start making money, it starts
[04:56.400 --> 04:58.160]  to become a little bit tense.
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.160]  It's very much like music.
[04:59.160 --> 05:01.680]  I always try to put it out like that.
[05:01.680 --> 05:06.800]  We create something that's sort of a vibe and it's a thing, but it's actually work behind
[05:06.800 --> 05:07.800]  it.
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.560]  So if I give you some seed, if I sell you a seed, yes, you own it to a point, but I
[05:12.560 --> 05:16.400]  feel like when you start to make seeds from those seeds and sell those seeds-
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.880]  Self-preservation, not for profit.
[05:17.880 --> 05:24.680]  You kind of either have to either just work with the person and get their kind of blessing.
[05:24.680 --> 05:30.760]  You don't have to, but it feels like it gives a better vibe to the whole situation.
[05:30.840 --> 05:33.040]  It'd be great if it kicked down, but that don't ever happen.
[05:33.040 --> 05:34.040]  I've never seen that.
[05:34.040 --> 05:38.280]  Like I could be living off bubble gum for the rest of my life just on the amount of
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.280]  people that have used it in crosses, but I've never seen a dime.
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.000]  I talked to Bog about it at one point and he didn't even know where it came from.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.560]  And I was kind of like, well, you do realize that the guy that you got it from, got it
[05:48.560 --> 05:49.560]  from me.
[05:49.560 --> 05:54.520]  And that still doesn't, it wasn't that long ago, it was a couple of years ago and he had
[05:54.520 --> 05:59.800]  no clue, but it's at the end of the day, I think if you work with other people's stuff,
[05:59.840 --> 06:05.600]  it's nice to have some arrangement, whether it be verbal or just doing a collab like we're
[06:05.600 --> 06:13.120]  doing with the Dunloud series is he selected a sage and sour male, three out of 500, right?
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.120]  Yes.
[06:14.120 --> 06:17.520]  Well, out of 50 males, there's 50 males that I selected from.
[06:17.520 --> 06:18.520]  Oh, but from the total seeds.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.520]  From the total seeds.
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.840]  I had 50 males and then I went in and I took males that represented like OG Kush that were
[06:24.840 --> 06:26.280]  more shorter.
[06:26.280 --> 06:30.920]  I took some that were more on that haze side and then there was one that was really sourish
[06:30.920 --> 06:31.920]  with the stem rub.
[06:31.920 --> 06:37.680]  And so I figured using that, because breeding F1s, the more variety you have, the more diversity
[06:37.680 --> 06:42.320]  you have, the more options you'll have to select from, you know, from the progeny.
[06:42.320 --> 06:43.480]  Yeah.
[06:43.480 --> 06:46.800]  And so that was about a year ago or a little less.
[06:46.800 --> 06:47.800]  I harvested the seeds.
[06:47.800 --> 06:48.800]  Oh, that's spanavus you told me, right?
[06:48.800 --> 06:49.800]  Yeah.
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.200]  I harvested the seeds over a year ago and they're just, they've been tested.
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.840]  They're about to go online here shortly.
[06:54.840 --> 06:55.840]  Right.
[06:56.400 --> 06:57.400]  And I was one of those like, yeah, sure.
[06:57.400 --> 07:03.560]  You know, that's the whole point of putting out regular seeds because I saw the market
[07:03.560 --> 07:09.560]  change and, you know, it really, the idea for Feminized Seeds in Holland, which were,
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.920]  you know, totally started there.
[07:12.920 --> 07:17.440]  Dutch Passion Seed Company was kind of the first guy who really put it out commercially.
[07:17.440 --> 07:20.760]  And I don't know, just somehow right out of the gate, I just didn't like it.
[07:20.760 --> 07:27.480]  Like I was really against the idea of sort of pigeonholing your work or kind of like
[07:27.480 --> 07:32.560]  giving a dead end, it felt like, because if everybody starts to work with only feminized
[07:32.560 --> 07:39.600]  and this is also, you know, in a place where everything's about money in Holland, right?
[07:39.600 --> 07:40.680]  Everybody's just money, money, money.
[07:40.680 --> 07:45.760]  And the Dutch are notoriously lazy and the Spanish are notoriously lazy growers.
[07:45.760 --> 07:47.480]  None of them want to do selection.
[07:47.480 --> 07:48.720]  They just want it to work, right?
[07:48.720 --> 07:51.320]  They don't want to, they don't like F1s.
[07:51.320 --> 07:55.200]  They don't like things that are, have any kind of variables.
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.480]  But in a way, like, I feel like when you buy seeds, whether it's F1, and a lot of times
[08:00.480 --> 08:02.600]  F1 is where all the magic's happening anyway.
[08:02.600 --> 08:07.400]  So you're actually doing better than letting a guy screw it all up and get it to like F3
[08:07.400 --> 08:11.960]  and have terrible selections and just somehow miss the mark.
[08:11.960 --> 08:14.880]  And now you're the victim of their terrible selection.
[08:14.880 --> 08:15.880]  You know what I mean?
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.520]  So if you have a good F1, it's like you have, if it's a true F1, which is almost impossible
[08:20.520 --> 08:26.320]  these days because whether or not you know it, most stuff is interrelated in some way,
[08:26.320 --> 08:29.880]  shape, or form and closer to than you think a lot of times where you're like, oh, actually
[08:29.880 --> 08:33.280]  those are cousins and these are cousins.
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.200]  So what do you think is going to happen is you're going to end up, you know, you always
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.860]  have shining examples in the trailer park, right?
[08:39.860 --> 08:43.280]  But it doesn't mean that the genetics are strong, right?
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.800]  So it's like one of those situations where you're going to have one or two pop up.
[08:46.800 --> 08:47.800]  Wow, this is beautiful.
[08:47.800 --> 08:50.920]  But if you're looking for stability, that's when you really want to run down the line
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.680]  and get it to F2, F3, F4.
[08:52.680 --> 08:55.640]  And the thing is, we don't actually want that.
[08:55.640 --> 08:59.120]  You now are an industry that wants that because once you're in agriculture, they don't want
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.360]  to have any variables, right?
[09:00.360 --> 09:01.760]  They want it to be exactly the same.
[09:01.760 --> 09:07.000]  Yeah, but the biggest problem that we're running into, like stabilizing stuff to an F7, and
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.080]  that's where you take it and back cross it with an inbred line to seven generations where
[09:11.160 --> 09:15.200]  you can stabilize it, is a heterosis, the lack of vigor.
[09:15.200 --> 09:16.560]  So you have this lack of vigor.
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.120]  Now you either need to breed parallel lines and cross those together, or you need to back
[09:20.120 --> 09:22.360]  cross it to the original F1.
[09:22.360 --> 09:26.440]  And the thing is, is with that, you want to breed when you're breeding that inbred line,
[09:26.440 --> 09:28.440]  you want to breed stuff that's very similar.
[09:28.440 --> 09:32.800]  So you have less phenotypical variation when you make that back cross.
[09:32.800 --> 09:39.480]  But again, like I think a lot of us, you know, unless you are growing on a scale, and that
[09:39.640 --> 09:43.080]  with a price point, that's so important, and you can't have any variables, and you want
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.080]  to grow that way.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.080]  Yeah, sure.
[09:45.080 --> 09:49.200]  But for the average guy, and especially for what you're going to get when you get a selection
[09:49.200 --> 09:56.280]  of seeds that still have that hybrid vigor based on the fact that there's still some,
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.280]  there's like an actual, you know, hopefully, they're not too interrelated.
[09:59.280 --> 10:03.600]  But at the same time, even with that, you can sometimes get, you know, shining examples
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.600]  coming out.
[10:04.600 --> 10:08.600]  And really, I think a lot of times now, it's separating yourself from all the other guys.
[10:08.720 --> 10:13.240]  And people finally got to the point where, you know, they've seen these clone only that
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.560]  have been around for 20 plus years, sometimes, they're more trouble than they're worth, you
[10:17.560 --> 10:18.560]  know what I mean?
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.760]  Because at the end of the day, they either have viruses or problems and, and or they're
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.400]  just, you know, been worked way too hard.
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.080]  So it's like sometimes nice when you see a whole tray of new, fresh genetics.
[10:31.080 --> 10:34.080]  And then that's like, literally, again, where the magic's happening.
[10:34.080 --> 10:36.600]  And then it comes strictly down to the selection.
[10:36.600 --> 10:39.720]  And that's where people can either make or break.
[10:39.720 --> 10:41.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:41.360 --> 10:42.360]  Yeah.
[10:42.360 --> 10:43.360]  Yeah.
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.360]  Yeah.
[10:44.360 --> 10:47.280]  Welcome to the Adam Dunn show.
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.640]  Well, you know, and it's really interesting, because I see a lot of work being done by
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.080]  a lot of breeders out there.
[10:54.080 --> 10:56.680]  And I don't see a lot of novel genetics coming out.
[10:56.680 --> 11:02.120]  I think one of the things that's kind of sticking us up right now is people are buying based
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.640]  on THC levels and dispensaries, especially on the rec market, because they go in the
[11:05.680 --> 11:07.560]  dispensaries are buying on THC levels.
[11:07.560 --> 11:08.560]  Yeah.
[11:08.560 --> 11:11.480]  So the first thing they do is they go in and they're going to buy the highest THC.
[11:11.480 --> 11:14.320]  And well, you know, I understand that.
[11:14.320 --> 11:21.360]  But we've smoked a lot of different cultivars, different strains that are 14% like sour diesel
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.320]  that'll knock your, you know, knock your socks off compared to some of those that tested
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.320]  30%.
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.320]  Well, yeah.
[11:27.320 --> 11:30.580]  And it's, it's really down to like, I mean, how many times have you gone to some place
[11:30.580 --> 11:35.200]  and had got some really shitty looking weed that you're like, this is definitely not going
[11:35.200 --> 11:36.280]  to get me high.
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.440]  And then somehow you're like in your hotel room all fucking, dude, I don't know.
[11:40.440 --> 11:44.040]  I haven't got that high and I've been smoking all this Cam D and all these other strains,
[11:44.040 --> 11:45.560]  but you're just so used to that.
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.560]  You know what I mean?
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.640]  Like, and just tickling those other spots doesn't maybe last very long.
[11:49.640 --> 11:52.760]  And after the second joint, you're like, I don't know how that did it, but it fucking
[11:52.760 --> 11:53.760]  got me super baked.
[11:53.760 --> 11:54.760]  You know what I mean?
[11:54.760 --> 11:55.760]  So green crack.
[11:55.760 --> 12:00.600]  And that could be like a 9% or, you know, super low, even lower, but it's just because
[12:00.600 --> 12:06.320]  it's the right pro, you know, can have a knowledge profile at that point for you and
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.320]  changing it up a lot.
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.320]  It's good.
[12:08.320 --> 12:11.360]  It's funny because some of the shittiest looking weed back in the day was the best.
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.360]  We had cat piss.
[12:12.360 --> 12:15.280]  That was one of my all time favorite strains still is.
[12:15.280 --> 12:18.040]  And I haven't seen it in 20 years, the real cat piss.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.440]  And you know, we've been, I've been talking to people.
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.560]  I talked to JJ when we were at lunch a couple of weeks ago and he was saying it's probably
[12:23.560 --> 12:24.560]  from an A5 lineage.
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.760]  Well, I was told originally it was an NL5 haze cross, but that really doesn't make sense
[12:28.760 --> 12:30.080]  with that.
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.440]  But that strain was lost 20 years ago at a big gunfight in California with the HAs and
[12:36.440 --> 12:37.440]  sheriffs.
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.560]  Well, you know, yeah, that's going to say like the victim of your own success was probably
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.000]  the biggest problem back in the day is that all like everyone's always like looking, you
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.720]  know, where's that old skunk and where's that old skunk?
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.720]  And it's like the reality is it's because those old skunks smelled like fucking skunks
[12:52.720 --> 12:54.400]  that they got people arrested.
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.160]  And you know, they're walking into their local shop and they're stink like a skunk and they
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.400]  tell the cop and the cop would follow them to their house, whatever.
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.400]  All those people got caught.
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.440]  And that's why, like there was a point in time where people would come to Holland and
[13:07.440 --> 13:10.600]  ask you like, do you have anything that doesn't have any smell to it?
[13:10.600 --> 13:17.000]  And you'd be like, you know, there's things that don't have a lot of smell, but that's
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.720]  usually an indicator of good weed.
[13:18.720 --> 13:19.720]  Right.
[13:19.720 --> 13:22.680]  But it's also the fact that that's the reason why a lot of people probably lost those.
[13:22.680 --> 13:25.120]  And like cat piss had that lingering fucking.
[13:25.120 --> 13:27.760]  A tenth of a gram would make your whole house smell.
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.360]  The pre-covid filter days.
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.360]  Yeah.
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.720]  Well, and then that was like from the early 90s, maybe 93 to 2001.
[13:37.720 --> 13:42.000]  And it smelled it had this strong ammonia smell with skunk.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.560]  And it was like that.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.560]  It was after that.
[13:46.560 --> 13:48.040]  No, it was after it dried.
[13:48.040 --> 13:51.400]  And it was like some of the like the A5 haze has that.
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.560]  It's that really it's accurate almost.
[13:53.560 --> 13:55.760]  It's like it burns your nose.
[13:55.760 --> 13:59.280]  And then with the skunk along with it, it would just like literally a tenth of a gram.
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.440]  If you had it in your shirt pocket, you'd be looking for the bud like for four hours.
[14:04.440 --> 14:06.920]  And that's it's been gone for a long time.
[14:06.920 --> 14:08.440]  But a lot of those old school smells.
[14:08.440 --> 14:12.720]  I mean, I think they've evolved, but I haven't seen a handful of them in many years.
[14:12.720 --> 14:15.800]  I think the other funny thing, too, is that like back in the day, everybody was drying
[14:15.800 --> 14:21.880]  in these like dank little nasty spots and growing and drying in the same room all the
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.600]  time because that's all they had.
[14:23.600 --> 14:26.240]  And it was like the only place that had ventilation was the grow room.
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.720]  So you just dried it in the grow room and they'd still have the pots in the corner and
[14:30.720 --> 14:33.920]  the things kind of there's some decomposing going on.
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.520]  And it would all end up in the bud, too, because you know how it was.
[14:36.520 --> 14:39.320]  You'd be like, God, it smells like a basement.
[14:39.320 --> 14:40.320]  Like it's got.
[14:40.320 --> 14:42.400]  And I think that was the thing about that particular weed.
[14:42.400 --> 14:44.000]  It never really dried very good.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.840]  It wasn't a very easy drying like thing.
[14:45.840 --> 14:46.840]  It was very leafy.
[14:46.840 --> 14:47.840]  Right.
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.040]  And very but but had that very heavy oil coat on it.
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.800]  So like, you know, the oil air bud, which is not dry, particularly.
[14:55.800 --> 14:56.800]  It was greasy.
[14:56.800 --> 14:57.800]  Yeah.
[14:57.800 --> 15:00.800]  And so I think a lot of those strains.
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.280]  I mean, it's funny because the ones that are the most difficult back in the day at that
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.120]  moment, they were kind of difficult to grow and not very great yielding.
[15:09.120 --> 15:11.840]  And the only reason you kept it around is because of that particular funk that it had
[15:11.840 --> 15:13.160]  or whatever.
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.040]  And that's a lot to do with, I think, the success and failure of a lot of strains, because
[15:18.040 --> 15:23.800]  people now are so not only as a THC, but, you know, as a grower, when you have to grow
[15:23.800 --> 15:31.360]  a plant that needs support by 15 stakes or it just grows like a soldier, you know, theoretically
[15:31.360 --> 15:32.920]  be doing way better if you grow.
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.760]  And that's why strains like, yeah, like Blue Dream become popular because it's like, yeah,
[15:37.760 --> 15:40.680]  you can pretty much shit in the reservoir and you'll yield at least two pounds.
[15:40.680 --> 15:41.680]  I hate that.
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.000]  I really hate some blue dream.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.920]  Well, I think the success of Blue Dream is based on the fact that it's stored really
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.040]  well compared to other weed.
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.800]  Like there's a lot of strains that are great when you first harvest them.
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.680]  And if you're lucky enough to be that guy who's got it within a certain time frame,
[15:59.680 --> 16:01.440]  it's still got that pop to it.
[16:01.440 --> 16:04.040]  But then after a little while, it dies off.
[16:04.040 --> 16:07.720]  And Blue Dream is the opposite, where if you store that shit and sit on it for a year or
[16:07.720 --> 16:10.960]  two years and pop it out, it's like, that actually still smells pretty good.
[16:10.960 --> 16:11.960]  It always gets better.
[16:11.960 --> 16:13.360]  Yeah, it gets better.
[16:13.360 --> 16:14.360]  Exactly.
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.720]  It grows really well.
[16:15.720 --> 16:17.720]  And so that was a bonus.
[16:17.720 --> 16:23.000]  So limonene, I believe limonene makes the weed deteriorate a lot.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.960]  It definitely shortens the time.
[16:25.960 --> 16:29.640]  Well, this is a story that I was told by somebody in this room.
[16:29.640 --> 16:32.560]  So maybe he can confirm if it's true.
[16:32.560 --> 16:39.360]  But back in the day when they would put rubber bands around bags of haze, it would eat through
[16:39.360 --> 16:40.720]  the rubber band.
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.720]  Is that true?
[16:41.720 --> 16:43.720]  Mysterious man in the back?
[16:44.280 --> 16:46.440]  Yeah, man.
[16:46.440 --> 16:51.480]  So the fact that it would eat through rubber bands kind of tells you that it's got a different
[16:51.480 --> 16:53.640]  sort of reaction than other sort of...
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.520]  Because if you put that same rubber band around some other plant and nothing would happen
[16:56.520 --> 16:57.520]  to it.
[16:57.520 --> 16:58.520]  So there's something going on there.
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.520]  Yeah.
[16:59.520 --> 17:00.520]  And...
[17:00.520 --> 17:03.840]  Around a bag of weed.
[17:03.840 --> 17:07.720]  So it's just like eat, like literally through everything, man.
[17:07.720 --> 17:08.720]  It was just like...
[17:08.720 --> 17:09.720]  It's like magic.
[17:09.720 --> 17:11.160]  And through the tops of the seals of the things, right?
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.960]  On the tops of the mason jars and stuff, they would get sort of eaten up.
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.120]  So you can imagine that there's some chemical reaction without anything happening going
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.120]  on there.
[17:20.120 --> 17:23.160]  And that means shit's working on your brain probably.
[17:23.160 --> 17:26.040]  Something's going down.
[17:26.040 --> 17:27.840]  But I digress.
[17:27.840 --> 17:28.840]  Yeah.
[17:28.840 --> 17:34.320]  So as far as like, we can definitely talk about Europe and how they kind of homogenized
[17:34.320 --> 17:36.760]  all the strains and also naming...
[17:36.760 --> 17:37.760]  Oh, yeah.
[17:37.760 --> 17:38.760]  Those evil...
[17:38.760 --> 17:39.760]  Naming conventions.
[17:39.760 --> 17:40.760]  Dutchies.
[17:41.360 --> 17:42.360]  The Dutch.
[17:42.360 --> 17:43.360]  They just bred for haze.
[17:43.360 --> 17:47.000]  No, well, I mean, the thing is it was really like...
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  It goes in...
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  Cannabis has these waves and things don't change for say six or seven years sometimes
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  in these little waves.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.320]  And then all of a sudden there's a massive change.
[17:56.320 --> 18:00.360]  And it's usually based on just exposure from wherever.
[18:00.360 --> 18:06.240]  And so Holland had that thing where those people that brought genetics there in the
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.880]  beginning blew people's minds because they were trying to grow a bunch of literally of
[18:10.880 --> 18:13.240]  like bird seed and shit.
[18:13.240 --> 18:14.560]  They were not doing their selection.
[18:14.560 --> 18:20.640]  And all of a sudden it took the outsiders to come there, wake them up.
[18:20.640 --> 18:23.400]  And the problem is that they also had a business running.
[18:23.400 --> 18:25.600]  They had a business model that they're trying to keep going.
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.200]  It was totally illegal, yet legal, but whatever.
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.600]  And so at the end of the day, now the people here figure out that that's actually really
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.160]  hard when you have customers coming in every single day demanding the same quality weed,
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.880]  which as you know, as a grower, it's really hard to deliver year round and stuff.
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.560]  And so I think that they were the first ones to take that model and try to work with it.
[18:46.560 --> 18:53.240]  And so from a breeder's point of view, I feel like they did a great job of keeping it alive
[18:53.240 --> 18:54.240]  for everybody.
[18:54.240 --> 18:55.240]  Sure.
[18:55.240 --> 18:58.200]  But on a creative side, they just didn't quite have that creative thing going.
[18:58.200 --> 18:59.760]  And they didn't care about weed.
[18:59.760 --> 19:00.760]  That's the problem.
[19:00.760 --> 19:01.760]  All the people that cared about weed, they were Americans.
[19:02.200 --> 19:04.200]  Well, they were breeding for different things.
[19:04.200 --> 19:06.960]  They were breeding in Europe.
[19:06.960 --> 19:10.800]  I feel like the traits they were breeding for was vigor and yield.
[19:10.800 --> 19:12.920]  Of course, and smell.
[19:12.920 --> 19:15.280]  Not really smell, because look what happened with OG Kush over there.
[19:15.280 --> 19:18.960]  So OG Kush, which is amazing, came from California.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  The second it hit the-
[19:19.960 --> 19:20.960]  How'd it get there, though?
[19:20.960 --> 19:21.960]  How'd it get to Europe?
[19:21.960 --> 19:22.960]  That's a great story.
[19:22.960 --> 19:23.960]  We should probably have Mojave come up here.
[19:23.960 --> 19:24.960]  Oh, Mo, you want to come up?
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.200]  You want to clear that up, Mo?
[19:29.200 --> 19:34.960]  So yeah, OG Kush, I feel like the seeds, I bought seeds of OG Kush in probably 2009.
[19:34.960 --> 19:38.480]  A widow, you buy seeds of OG Kush.
[19:38.480 --> 19:39.480]  Yeah.
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.960]  Well, no, that was OG Kush times white widow, and maybe back cross to OG Kush or something.
[19:44.960 --> 19:48.320]  But it definitely wasn't a very good representation of OG Kush.
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.320]  It was garbage.
[19:49.320 --> 19:50.520]  It was feminized.
[19:50.520 --> 19:51.520]  And I realize-
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.760]  It sounds like all the wrong things.
[19:53.760 --> 19:56.160]  You went for literally the wrong everything.
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.160]  Yeah.
[19:57.160 --> 20:02.760]  Maybe that feminized OG Kush something from Europe that really, oh my God, it must have
[20:02.760 --> 20:03.760]  been-
[20:03.760 --> 20:04.760]  Oh, yeah.
[20:04.760 --> 20:07.760]  The amount of fuckery going on in that is terrible, I can say.
[20:07.760 --> 20:08.760]  Yeah.
[20:08.760 --> 20:09.760]  It could have not even been OG Kush.
[20:09.760 --> 20:10.760]  Or nothing to do-
[20:10.760 --> 20:13.760]  98% chance it wasn't, I'd say.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.360]  It was just white widow, probably.
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.800]  I would guess to me, yes.
[20:16.800 --> 20:17.800]  Like everything.
[20:17.800 --> 20:18.800]  Right.
[20:18.800 --> 20:19.800]  Everything.
[20:19.800 --> 20:25.160]  There's a white widow male that people use over there for sure that's been out and abused
[20:26.160 --> 20:27.480]  like no other.
[20:27.480 --> 20:31.760]  All the big seed companies used it back in the day for their feminizing.
[20:31.760 --> 20:36.440]  But that kind of goes into what James was talking about earlier about giving credit
[20:36.440 --> 20:38.120]  to where credit's due.
[20:38.120 --> 20:43.800]  I think a lot of the, and I'm totally guilty of this, I released an AJ's Sour Diesel pack
[20:43.800 --> 20:45.960]  a long time ago, but it wasn't AJ's Sour Diesel.
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.040]  It was AJ's Sour Diesel crossed with white widow.
[20:49.040 --> 20:53.360]  We were working with some guys over there, and then they put that back on the AJ's Sour
[20:53.480 --> 20:55.200]  Diesel cut that I had.
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.560]  So we called it AJ's Sour Diesel.
[20:56.560 --> 21:00.840]  But moving forward, I feel like we were doing the wrong thing back then, and we didn't really
[21:00.840 --> 21:01.840]  know it.
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.600]  I saw a Chem 23 the other day.
[21:03.600 --> 21:07.080]  I was like, what the hell is a Chem 23?
[21:07.080 --> 21:11.680]  So it's getting to that point now where people have already forgotten.
[21:11.680 --> 21:18.280]  The thing about the OG in Europe was when it first arrived there, of course people who
[21:18.280 --> 21:20.560]  smoked a lot of weed were like, well, this is good.
[21:20.760 --> 21:23.400]  A lot of the people over there, they don't even like really strong weed.
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.320]  If you give it, oh, it's too strong.
[21:25.320 --> 21:26.320]  Nobody wants it.
[21:26.320 --> 21:27.320]  Like, what?
[21:27.320 --> 21:31.080]  This is the exact opposite of reason why we are growing cannabis.
[21:31.080 --> 21:35.880]  But that was part of the thing, was figuring out the packaging of this product, which was
[21:35.880 --> 21:41.800]  now kind of like, they kind of like, as long as the buds were a certain weight and size,
[21:41.800 --> 21:42.800]  it was good.
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.640]  They don't want to think about it too much.
[21:44.640 --> 21:46.880]  They want to put it on the scale, less than 100.
[21:46.880 --> 21:49.280]  You come in there with a big, giant, giant bud.
[21:49.320 --> 21:51.000]  It was like, no, this is not happening.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  People would look at you crazy.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  Of course.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  How do you do it?
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  Everything had to be toned down.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.360]  That was the first thing you learn as an American grower over there, was like, probably should
[21:59.360 --> 22:01.200]  tone it down a little bit.
[22:01.200 --> 22:03.600]  Yeah, that's just a hard place to grow in.
[22:03.600 --> 22:06.040]  That's got to be like one of the worst places for a grower.
[22:06.040 --> 22:08.600]  From a breeder's point of view, though, the one thing that I did find interesting was
[22:08.600 --> 22:14.560]  that a lot of the seeds that we would grow there, if you imagine where they're growing,
[22:14.560 --> 22:15.560]  right?
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.560]  It's like dank and nasty.
[22:16.760 --> 22:19.680]  It's not like California or something like that.
[22:19.680 --> 22:24.680]  Then you get those seeds and somebody magically flies home with them wherever they took them.
[22:24.680 --> 22:26.600]  Then, unbelievable, right?
[22:26.600 --> 22:29.120]  Those plants just fucking loved life.
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.800]  Whereas when you grow in a beautiful climate and then those seeds end up going back to
[22:33.800 --> 22:38.360]  like Holland or somewhere shady like that, I bet that they're not so happy.
[22:38.360 --> 22:39.360]  You know what I mean?
[22:39.360 --> 22:41.680]  They're not as stoked when they come out.
[22:41.680 --> 22:42.680]  They're like, what?
[22:42.680 --> 22:45.400]  But I came from California.
[22:45.440 --> 22:47.880]  I want to go home.
[22:47.880 --> 22:53.080]  There's memories and epigenetics with everything.
[22:53.080 --> 22:57.920]  When you grow for the right reasons and you seed a plant at the right time and everything
[22:57.920 --> 23:01.560]  comes ... All the things are working, you almost ... As you're handing those seeds to
[23:01.560 --> 23:06.800]  somebody, you just know, guaranteed, those are going to be so good because it was all
[23:06.800 --> 23:07.800]  good.
[23:07.800 --> 23:10.960]  Whereas if you have a situation where, yeah, they were in a room and then the lights went
[23:10.960 --> 23:13.920]  out because the power went out for three days and then the plants kind of suffered a little
[23:13.920 --> 23:15.800]  bit and the seeds still came through.
[23:15.800 --> 23:18.360]  It's not like you're going to not sell any of them, but at the same time, you do know
[23:18.360 --> 23:21.960]  that there was a little stress involved on that particular run.
[23:21.960 --> 23:23.800]  Again, it's epigenetics.
[23:23.800 --> 23:29.040]  It's like something where we, as breeders, try to put something into it.
[23:29.040 --> 23:33.280]  The problem with Holland was that a lot of those guys, it was all ... It was without
[23:33.280 --> 23:34.280]  even them.
[23:34.280 --> 23:35.280]  None of them cared.
[23:35.280 --> 23:39.240]  They smoked shaggies and tobacco and some hash in it.
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.240]  You're like, but you grow weed all day long.
[23:41.240 --> 23:42.240]  It's like, no, no, I smoke tobacco.
[23:42.560 --> 23:44.640]  Half of those guys didn't even breed.
[23:44.640 --> 23:46.200]  Half of them, they just buy seeds from other people.
[23:46.200 --> 23:49.200]  I feel like that was the biggest thing over there.
[23:49.200 --> 23:50.200]  Yeah.
[23:50.200 --> 23:52.160]  It's sad, but it's part of the thing.
[23:52.160 --> 23:58.080]  Every time you see a mislabeled seed sold or a clone going out with the wrong name on
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.560]  it, you know it's just causing just endless problems down the road.
[24:02.560 --> 24:06.600]  So many people are going to say, oh, I smoked this and it was either shitty or it was great
[24:06.600 --> 24:11.040]  and it could be the opposite either way or no credit is given where it should be done.
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.040]  Yeah.
[24:13.040 --> 24:15.160]  So from a grower's point or from a breeder's point of view, I kind of feel like if you're
[24:15.160 --> 24:19.000]  in the perfect place, it's sometimes not the perfect place.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.040]  So that was the one thing they had going for them is that anything that came out of there
[24:23.040 --> 24:26.040]  seemed to thrive when it got out of that fucking ...
[24:26.040 --> 24:30.040]  Thanks to James V. Thank you.
[24:30.040 --> 24:32.040]  I bought all my seeds off him.
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.040]  Allegedly.
[24:33.040 --> 24:34.040]  Allegedly.
[24:34.040 --> 24:35.040]  Thank you.
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.040]  I've been here about four years and I appreciate everything you do.
[24:39.040 --> 24:41.040]  I bought everything off your site.
[24:41.040 --> 24:42.040]  Awesome.
[24:42.040 --> 24:43.040]  Thank you.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.040]  Allegedly.
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.040]  Thank you.
[24:45.040 --> 24:46.040]  Allegedly.
[24:46.040 --> 24:47.040]  Oh, nice.
[24:47.040 --> 24:51.040]  Everything I popped died instantly.
[24:51.040 --> 24:53.040]  I emailed you at Bear.
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.040]  You brought me a new pack and I used two mails out there.
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.040]  Awesome.
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.040]  I give out seeds to everybody here tonight.
[25:02.040 --> 25:03.040]  Awesome.
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.040]  Appreciate it.
[25:04.040 --> 25:05.040]  Thank you.
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.040]  And I appreciate you and I appreciate both you guys for being real on this.
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.040]  That's right, Paul.
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.040]  And one more thing, James, where's all the food at?
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.040]  I've seen all your posts.
[25:15.040 --> 25:16.040]  He's a cook.
[25:16.040 --> 25:17.040]  He's a food scientist.
[25:17.040 --> 25:18.040]  You can see it's all right here.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.040]  Yeah.
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.040]  I have a million followers.
[25:20.040 --> 25:21.040]  Yeah, I mean, I consult ...
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.040]  I've seen it.
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.040]  Thank you very much.
[25:23.040 --> 25:27.040]  But yeah, I consult for a lot of people and I travel a lot so there's always good food.
[25:27.040 --> 25:28.040]  I used to be a chef as well.
[25:28.040 --> 25:32.040]  So I graduated Le Cordon Bleu top of my class a long time ago.
[25:32.040 --> 25:33.040]  Yeah.
[25:33.040 --> 25:34.040]  Hell yeah, bro.
[25:34.040 --> 25:35.040]  So thank you.
[25:35.040 --> 25:36.040]  I appreciate you guys.
[25:36.040 --> 25:37.040]  Thank you.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.040]  I appreciate it.
[25:38.040 --> 25:39.040]  I saw it.
[25:39.040 --> 25:40.040]  It's amazing.
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.040]  Yeah.
[25:41.040 --> 25:44.480]  It's great to be able to get people ... You know, if people come out of their comfort
[25:44.480 --> 25:48.880]  zone to come to a thing like this, they got a little bit of heart and dedication to what
[25:48.880 --> 25:50.320]  we're doing.
[25:50.320 --> 25:56.480]  And that's also part of this industry is kind of a lot of camaraderie between people, which
[25:56.480 --> 25:59.480]  is also nice, like our collab.
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.480]  Yeah.
[26:00.480 --> 26:02.360]  Customer service is big too.
[26:02.360 --> 26:03.880]  I think a lot of people are losing that.
[26:03.880 --> 26:04.880]  They're just expected customers.
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.440]  And that's one of the things we're big on is customer service.
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.880]  If you have a situation with a pack, you know, you email us, you tell us what happened, I'm
[26:11.880 --> 26:13.720]  going to send you a free pack, no questions asked.
[26:13.720 --> 26:19.920]  I mean, I can ask you how you germinate them, but my way is not always the right way.
[26:19.920 --> 26:22.440]  Just because I do it one way doesn't mean you do it that way.
[26:22.440 --> 26:24.560]  And the way we work, you're not supposed to germinate them anyways.
[26:24.560 --> 26:25.960]  Don't get them wet or dirty.
[26:25.960 --> 26:30.360]  So if you have a situation with them, the best thing to do is just replace that pack
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.200]  and then you're happy and you go again.
[26:32.200 --> 26:33.640]  And then I have happy customers like that.
[26:33.640 --> 26:38.080]  So I appreciate you coming out and sharing seeds because I think everybody should definitely
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.600]  grow, but definitely grow from a seed.
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.240]  It's a big difference between buying a clone and taking it home and putting it in some
[26:43.240 --> 26:45.240]  dirt and being like, oh, I got a clone.
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.920]  You know, or taking a little seedling and actually watching it pop and growing it and
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.160]  knowing it has a taproot and the potential it could be and how they're all going to be
[26:52.160 --> 26:53.160]  different.
[26:53.160 --> 26:54.160]  So it's a lot.
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.160]  Awesome.
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.160]  Nice.
[26:56.160 --> 26:57.160]  Drinks and seeds.
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.160]  Seeds, look under your seat.
[26:58.160 --> 26:59.160]  Everybody's got seeds.
[26:59.160 --> 27:06.160]  You get seeds, you get seeds, you get seeds.
[27:06.160 --> 27:07.160]  Yeah.
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.160]  And that's also the cool part.
[27:09.160 --> 27:15.480]  Like as you see, like giving away, like, you know, from such a small thing compared to
[27:15.480 --> 27:18.360]  like clones, you're kind of working with other people's selection.
[27:18.360 --> 27:19.360]  Right.
[27:19.360 --> 27:23.080]  So like you're not going to be able, chances of you growing a better version of the guy
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.500]  who gave you the clones is pretty slim.
[27:26.500 --> 27:29.660]  You might be a better grower and you might get a fraction of a bit better.
[27:29.660 --> 27:31.780]  But when you go from seed, there's like a rolling dice every time.
[27:31.780 --> 27:34.540]  So like you might just hit the, you just might nail it.
[27:34.540 --> 27:35.540]  Right.
[27:35.540 --> 27:39.060]  Where you're just like, oh man, not only is it bigger, faster, tastier, whatever, all
[27:39.060 --> 27:41.660]  the things you're looking for.
[27:41.660 --> 27:45.740]  And the best part is like a lot of things is like, I used to always joke that, you know,
[27:45.740 --> 27:49.180]  the best thing about the cannabis industry is the fact that there's so much testing involved
[27:49.180 --> 27:51.540]  and work involved in trying to figure it out.
[27:51.540 --> 27:52.540]  Right.
[27:52.540 --> 27:57.380]  And it's never, never felt like work sitting and doing a, like a pheno hunt and then having
[27:57.380 --> 28:01.220]  all these different strains to kind of, you know, or these different cultivars at the
[28:01.220 --> 28:06.100]  same time and narrowing it down to one and, you know, tough work.
[28:06.100 --> 28:08.300]  The breeders don't even have the best cuts anymore.
[28:08.300 --> 28:13.340]  The guys that are selling their seeds to seeds here now, half the time, the best phenotype
[28:13.340 --> 28:15.060]  is probably out with the consumer.
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.580]  I've actually been at the booth where someone come up with that.
[28:17.580 --> 28:20.620]  And to me, I think that's the true representation of a good breeder.
[28:20.700 --> 28:24.700]  If he's trying to improve the line, you should come back with something better than he has.
[28:24.700 --> 28:27.500]  If you don't, you should be disappointed if you don't have a keeper, if you don't get
[28:27.500 --> 28:29.100]  something better than he has.
[28:29.100 --> 28:33.980]  I think that's a good representation of that is I like breeders when they bring me seeds
[28:33.980 --> 28:37.120]  or when they bring me gear, I'll have flour with it too.
[28:37.120 --> 28:40.220]  And so that lets me know that they grew them out, they tested them and passed all their
[28:40.220 --> 28:43.820]  checks to all their boxes and they're comfortable with it.
[28:43.820 --> 28:48.040]  And so I think that's really big when you guys go for buying and selecting genes is
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.980]  make sure whoever you're buying them from tested them out.
[28:50.340 --> 28:53.740]  Look for pictures, make sure they give you data, make sure they give you info.
[28:53.740 --> 28:58.220]  Because if a real breeder did it or if they meant to do it, for one, they'll have the
[28:58.220 --> 28:59.220]  mail.
[28:59.220 --> 29:02.300]  So that shoots a lot of things in the foot right there.
[29:02.300 --> 29:03.300]  A lot of things were accidents.
[29:03.300 --> 29:04.700]  If they don't have the mail, they didn't do it.
[29:04.700 --> 29:05.700]  They'll just get cookies.
[29:05.700 --> 29:08.060]  But there's a lot of guys like JJ doesn't keep his mails.
[29:08.060 --> 29:09.060]  You know what I mean?
[29:09.060 --> 29:10.660]  There's some people, everybody kind of has their own style too.
[29:10.660 --> 29:12.540]  That's the other funny thing about breeding.
[29:12.540 --> 29:15.940]  It's like we're all doing the same thing, but we have kind of our own style.
[29:15.940 --> 29:19.780]  It's like making hash, same sort of thing.
[29:19.780 --> 29:23.540]  We're all kind of trying to do the same thing, but somehow somebody does it better than the
[29:23.540 --> 29:24.540]  other guy.
[29:24.540 --> 29:29.980]  And it's just because they have better patience or their timing or their temperature sort
[29:29.980 --> 29:33.820]  of knowledge of being on point is a little bit better.
[29:33.820 --> 29:34.820]  Usually it's a lazy factor.
[29:34.820 --> 29:35.820]  You know what I mean?
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.060]  It's one of those, anything that's hard to do, like making-
[29:38.060 --> 29:39.060]  You're calling JJ lazy?
[29:39.060 --> 29:40.060]  No, I'm not saying he's lazy.
[29:40.060 --> 29:41.060]  I don't know.
[29:41.060 --> 29:42.060]  I don't know.
[29:42.060 --> 29:43.060]  He's got his own style though, for sure.
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.060]  But no, he doesn't keep his own.
[29:44.060 --> 29:45.060]  He doesn't keep mails.
[29:45.060 --> 29:46.060]  He just kind of moves on.
[29:46.060 --> 29:57.260]  Keeps on moving on, which is good if you really are good at sort of seeing what's coming
[29:57.260 --> 29:58.260]  up around the corner.
[29:58.260 --> 30:02.500]  But I do try to keep mails as long as I can.
[30:02.500 --> 30:04.460]  That's kind of one of those, if I can.
[30:04.460 --> 30:06.620]  Yeah, well, it's so difficult keeping mail.
[30:06.620 --> 30:07.620]  I mean, you have to have a-
[30:07.620 --> 30:08.620]  Nobody wants to hold them for you, that's for sure.
[30:08.620 --> 30:10.300]  Yeah, no one wants to hold them for you.
[30:10.300 --> 30:14.260]  I mean, I've lost most of my mails, but now I have a handful that I'm keeping in a nursery.
[30:14.260 --> 30:18.980]  Now with the rec market, we're able to kind of move forward with keeping things alive
[30:18.980 --> 30:20.660]  a lot longer.
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.500]  Tissue culture, I think, is going to be a good solution.
[30:22.500 --> 30:25.100]  Currently, I don't think it's ideal, but I think-
[30:25.100 --> 30:26.100]  It's not practical yet.
[30:26.100 --> 30:28.060]  Putting plants through tissue, yeah, it's not practical yet.
[30:28.060 --> 30:34.580]  I mean, it's great for keeping it, like for your in-house sort of being able to clean
[30:34.580 --> 30:35.580]  things up.
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.580]  That's kind of where we're at now.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.580]  Yeah.
[30:37.580 --> 30:38.580]  And just meristem propagation.
[30:39.580 --> 30:43.540]  Well, now that we can recognize like viroids and viruses and all these things that we can
[30:43.540 --> 30:49.700]  actually clean up and then put through tissue culture, get a new start of that plant that
[30:49.700 --> 30:50.700]  is clean and healthy.
[30:50.700 --> 30:54.620]  I mean, there's so many old plants that need to go through tissue culture.
[30:54.620 --> 30:59.980]  Yeah, no, I think that's the only way that people on large scale production are going
[30:59.980 --> 31:02.060]  to be able to do it anyway, just because they need to have-
[31:02.060 --> 31:03.060]  Clean, fresh, healthy starts.
[31:03.060 --> 31:08.540]  Clean from the start and be able to look back and put a date on it, you know, because you
[31:08.540 --> 31:14.100]  can just imagine how many facilities got ruined by taking in ... Again, that's the
[31:14.100 --> 31:19.700]  problem with clones in general, is there's pathogen problems, there's viroids, and there's-
[31:19.700 --> 31:21.140]  Powdered mildew.
[31:21.140 --> 31:24.380]  And if you have any kind of medium going with it, it's all that too, you know?
[31:24.380 --> 31:26.020]  How did Europe get powdered mildew?
[31:26.020 --> 31:27.020]  Oh, no, I definitely brought that.
[31:27.020 --> 31:28.020]  That was for sure.
[31:28.020 --> 31:29.020]  That was me.
[31:29.020 --> 31:30.020]  I just want to clarify.
[31:30.020 --> 31:31.020]  Oh, yeah.
[31:31.020 --> 31:32.020]  That was 100% verified.
[31:32.020 --> 31:33.020]  I'd never seen it before.
[31:33.020 --> 31:43.820]  And I was super proud because I had OG and Sour D, and I was all stoked and had my friends
[31:43.820 --> 31:45.260]  from Minnesota come into town.
[31:45.260 --> 31:47.260]  And the first thing they said is, oh, dude, you got PM.
[31:47.260 --> 31:48.260]  And I'm like, what?
[31:48.260 --> 31:49.260]  Like, what are you talking about?
[31:49.260 --> 31:51.820]  And I literally did not even see it.
[31:51.820 --> 31:57.260]  And it was just at that stage where it was just coming in enough that if you, once you
[31:57.260 --> 31:58.740]  see it, you can't unsee it.
[31:58.740 --> 32:02.100]  Now, all of a sudden, you're like, oh my God, it's everywhere.
[32:02.180 --> 32:05.700]  And it wasn't bad yet, but it was just coming on.
[32:05.700 --> 32:07.780]  And so, you know, they're from Minnesota.
[32:07.780 --> 32:08.780]  They're used to seeing it.
[32:08.780 --> 32:10.460]  They're like, no problem.
[32:10.460 --> 32:13.180]  Get some Tyvek suits, get to work on it.
[32:13.180 --> 32:17.260]  But if I didn't have them come through, I would have just completely wiped out my things.
[32:17.260 --> 32:22.700]  But that's because I brought those cuts from here, literally from Cali and straight to
[32:22.700 --> 32:25.100]  Amsterdam and just like, yep, there you go.
[32:25.100 --> 32:27.740]  All those cuts I gave you, I got powdered mildew.
[32:27.740 --> 32:28.740]  What did you use?
[32:28.740 --> 32:30.300]  Because there was no Eagle 20 over there.
[32:30.300 --> 32:31.300]  I used sulfur.
[32:31.500 --> 32:35.900]  I went for sulfur early on, but it was also burners.
[32:35.900 --> 32:40.140]  And the burners were kind of a bitch because they get everywhere.
[32:40.140 --> 32:42.340]  Now I realize I would never use burners.
[32:42.340 --> 32:46.580]  I'd only use micronized sulfur because that way you can apply it directly to where you
[32:46.580 --> 32:51.820]  want to apply it and not just like, I'm going to nuke the entire facility because we can
[32:51.820 --> 32:52.820]  never get it out.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.340]  Like that stuff is like fire.
[32:55.340 --> 32:56.980]  You feel like you're in a firecracker factory.
[32:56.980 --> 32:58.940]  You're like, okay, this is not good.
[32:58.940 --> 32:59.940]  No, it's not good.
[33:00.660 --> 33:04.940]  Because it's micronized or because it's in the burners, it's going up and getting like...
[33:04.940 --> 33:08.460]  So for me, my problem is I was using a lot of light movers at the time and it was so
[33:08.460 --> 33:12.060]  slick that it made my wheels on the light movers just spin and I wouldn't...
[33:12.060 --> 33:14.700]  So I'd come in the room and be like, goddamn sulfur burners.
[33:14.700 --> 33:17.140]  So I stopped using them for that.
[33:17.140 --> 33:20.260]  But then I realized later, like, man, I just didn't like the way that it was applied.
[33:20.260 --> 33:21.260]  But it worked.
[33:21.260 --> 33:22.860]  I mean, it definitely got rid of it.
[33:22.860 --> 33:27.540]  So there's a product called Micro-Thyl Disperse and it has two S's on it.
[33:27.540 --> 33:28.540]  It's amazing.
[33:28.540 --> 33:29.540]  It's micronized.
[33:30.140 --> 33:32.740]  You can buy like, two pound bags of micronized sulfur and then put a wetting agent.
[33:32.740 --> 33:35.540]  This has it all in there and it's like $50 for 50 pounds.
[33:35.540 --> 33:36.540]  You can buy it on...
[33:36.540 --> 33:37.540]  You can order it.
[33:37.540 --> 33:41.740]  You type it in Google, it shows up and it's perfect in every way.
[33:41.740 --> 33:42.740]  It's good for russet mites.
[33:42.740 --> 33:46.300]  It's good for powdery mildew if you have to use it, if you have to use a sulfur product.
[33:46.300 --> 33:48.300]  And I believe it's OMRI certified.
[33:48.300 --> 33:51.380]  Yeah, it's amazing when you...
[33:51.380 --> 33:57.380]  Because of the bad taste in my mouth, literally from the burners, I just never really got...
[33:57.420 --> 34:00.620]  I was like, ah, no, sulfur did it, not gonna do it.
[34:00.620 --> 34:03.660]  And then about a year ago, somebody...
[34:03.660 --> 34:04.660]  Again, same problem.
[34:04.660 --> 34:07.660]  Somebody gave me some clones and then I was like, oh, you motherfuckers.
[34:07.660 --> 34:09.660]  I'm like, I'm gonna get into this scope.
[34:09.660 --> 34:10.660]  Like, ah, nuke them.
[34:10.660 --> 34:11.660]  So I hit them with...
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.380]  I was like, I gotta do them.
[34:13.380 --> 34:14.380]  This time I gotta do it.
[34:14.380 --> 34:18.660]  But I don't wanna just go straight to try to use something chemical because it's like,
[34:18.660 --> 34:19.660]  you gotta...
[34:19.660 --> 34:22.660]  The only way to do proper organic is to start organic, you know what I mean?
[34:22.660 --> 34:26.860]  And work it all the way through you because it's pretty much, you know, it's in there.
[34:27.340 --> 34:29.340]  So, use sulfur and I was amazed.
[34:29.340 --> 34:33.340]  I was like, wow, does this work better than all the other things I've been using and cheap?
[34:33.340 --> 34:36.340]  Well, we used to think powdery mildew was systemic.
[34:36.340 --> 34:37.340]  At least I did.
[34:37.340 --> 34:40.340]  And then I learned that you can outgrow powdery mildew.
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.340]  It's not systemic.
[34:41.340 --> 34:42.340]  Yeah, it's way...
[34:42.340 --> 34:46.340]  Well, it's just one of those things where it latches, it gets into the plant technically.
[34:46.340 --> 34:51.340]  So it feels like it's systemic, but it's not permanent, you know what I mean?
[34:51.340 --> 34:52.340]  It can be peed.
[34:52.340 --> 34:53.340]  But...
[34:53.340 --> 34:54.340]  Yeah, I think...
[34:54.820 --> 34:55.820]  I think just...
[34:55.820 --> 34:59.820]  It's a lot easier when you're growing plants that don't get powdery mildew.
[34:59.820 --> 35:02.820]  It's just like, hey, look, this plant doesn't get powdery mildew.
[35:02.820 --> 35:04.820]  It's like, if I can just grow that.
[35:04.820 --> 35:10.820]  If that's possible and you can somehow, you know, get rid of that sourdough or that cut
[35:10.820 --> 35:15.820]  that you actually are just so attached to that always gets it, you know, which is always a problem.
[35:15.820 --> 35:16.820]  There's certain plants that just do that.
[35:16.820 --> 35:17.820]  Cushions.
[35:17.820 --> 35:19.820]  Cushions are really susceptible typically to powdery mildew.
[35:19.820 --> 35:22.820]  In Europe, it was HP13 that was the worst.
[35:23.300 --> 35:28.300]  That plant came around and just anybody who got that cut, especially a lot of the Dutch
[35:28.300 --> 35:30.300]  growers didn't recognize what it was.
[35:30.300 --> 35:32.300]  And they were all proud when they handed it to you.
[35:32.300 --> 35:34.300]  And you're like, whoa, what's all that?
[35:34.300 --> 35:35.300]  They're like, what do you mean?
[35:35.300 --> 35:37.300]  That's all trichomes or something.
[35:37.300 --> 35:40.300]  And like, no, that is powdery fucking mildew.
[35:40.300 --> 35:44.300]  And then once they figured it out, it was like, yo, dude, well, that's on everything
[35:44.300 --> 35:48.300]  I have then because that's exactly what all my plants look like back home.
[35:48.300 --> 35:49.300]  So it definitely...
[35:49.780 --> 35:51.780]  That particular cut was a nightmare.
[35:51.780 --> 35:53.780]  And Soma sold a lot of that and a lot of people.
[35:53.780 --> 35:57.780]  That was just around for a short amount of time, long enough to really infect a lot of
[35:57.780 --> 35:59.780]  people's gardens.
[35:59.780 --> 36:01.780]  But that wasn't me technically.
[36:01.780 --> 36:03.780]  So it was somebody else.
[36:03.780 --> 36:04.780]  Right.
[36:04.780 --> 36:07.780]  I may have brought it at one point, but that one seemed to be inherent.
[36:07.780 --> 36:10.780]  And that was an old plant from New York and Hawaii and all that.
[36:10.780 --> 36:14.780]  That plant, which is another one of those weird things about strains, is that you'll
[36:14.780 --> 36:17.780]  notice that there's a lot of drama based around a lot of these strains.
[36:18.260 --> 36:23.260]  And it's like there are certain ones like HP 13, especially because it was a Hawaii,
[36:23.260 --> 36:25.260]  New York kind of thing.
[36:25.260 --> 36:28.260]  Drama, like unbelievable amounts.
[36:28.260 --> 36:30.260]  People, a lot of groups broke up over it.
[36:30.260 --> 36:32.260]  Fights, infighting.
[36:32.260 --> 36:39.260]  Sour diesel, it got his name from causing people to become sour from lack of access.
[36:39.260 --> 36:41.260]  So there was just like...
[36:41.740 --> 36:47.740]  Obviously, OG has its own history and it wasn't necessarily as brutal as some of the other
[36:47.740 --> 36:51.740]  ones, but I've seen other strains causing all sorts of drama.
[36:51.740 --> 36:58.740]  And it's because, I think it's just because, well, back in the day it was power struggle
[36:58.740 --> 37:03.740]  more or less, and now it's the same power struggle, it's just in a legal way, which
[37:03.740 --> 37:04.740]  is worse, of course.
[37:04.740 --> 37:05.740]  Way worse.
[37:05.740 --> 37:06.740]  I would rather it be the other way.
[37:06.740 --> 37:07.740]  It's way different.
[37:07.740 --> 37:10.740]  The white market and the black market is way different with that.
[37:11.220 --> 37:13.220]  Traditional market.
[37:13.220 --> 37:14.220]  Traditional market.
[37:14.220 --> 37:15.220]  Traditional market.
[37:15.220 --> 37:16.220]  Traditional market.
[37:16.220 --> 37:19.220]  Yes, the traditional market.
[37:21.220 --> 37:26.220]  Yeah, and it used to be more honor code, let's say, or something like that, and now it's...
[37:26.220 --> 37:28.220]  We worked on handshakes back in the day.
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.220]  It was handshakes.
[37:29.220 --> 37:30.220]  We didn't sign papers.
[37:30.220 --> 37:33.220]  It was like you work with people that you trust, you get burned occasionally, and you
[37:33.220 --> 37:37.220]  grow, and you learn who you can work with, and you work with those people, and then the
[37:37.700 --> 37:40.700]  shit heads you get rid of now, it's like you gotta sign papers and...
[37:40.700 --> 37:42.700]  Well, yeah, there's a lot of...
[37:42.700 --> 37:43.700]  Lots of contracts.
[37:43.700 --> 37:45.700]  There's a lot of lunches now is what you get.
[37:45.700 --> 37:46.700]  You get a lot of lunches.
[37:46.700 --> 37:47.700]  A lot of lunches.
[37:47.700 --> 37:53.220]  Everybody gets a fuck load of lunches, a couple dinners, and then usually it fizzles.
[37:53.220 --> 37:57.220]  At that point, they've done the brain drain to enough to like, there's somebody at the
[37:57.220 --> 37:59.220]  back just with a sketch pad.
[37:59.220 --> 38:06.220]  And that's the thing about this industry, it's very much saturated in many ways, but
[38:07.220 --> 38:09.220]  in a weird way, reinventing itself all the time too.
[38:09.220 --> 38:15.220]  So I think if you can kind of stay slightly ahead of the curve and or just sort of figure
[38:15.220 --> 38:22.220]  out your position within this industry, you can be comfortable, but at the same time,
[38:22.220 --> 38:27.220]  it sucks to try to be on that front end of what's going on, because things are...
[38:27.220 --> 38:31.220]  Until it goes federally legal, there's just no point of even investing a ton of money
[38:31.220 --> 38:34.220]  and trying to put all your energy into it, because you know you're gonna get your ass
[38:34.220 --> 38:37.220]  handed to you the minute it goes into that zone.
[38:37.220 --> 38:41.220]  So you kind of almost wanna either had to have already been doing it, you know what
[38:41.220 --> 38:48.220]  I mean, and taking that risk early on, because now to get involved is kind of a bit much.
[38:48.220 --> 38:53.220]  And on a breeding point of view, it's nice because it can be like a hobby style side
[38:53.220 --> 38:54.220]  thing.
[38:54.220 --> 39:01.220]  You could go full steam, but again, you're gonna see it's gonna get less and less interesting
[39:01.220 --> 39:03.220]  the higher up you go up the ladder.
[39:03.220 --> 39:07.220]  And you're like, wow, your hands are tied once again, because you're now limited to
[39:07.220 --> 39:10.220]  these particular strains that may have already been put through the system.
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.220]  And now it's like, well, how am I gonna do anything with that?
[39:12.220 --> 39:14.220]  Because that has nothing to do with what I'm doing.
[39:14.220 --> 39:15.220]  Well, and then even trademarks.
[39:15.220 --> 39:20.220]  So we had the trademark for Loud for the longest time, me and my partners with Loud Seeds.
[39:20.220 --> 39:24.220]  And it got to a point where it just wouldn't be enforceable.
[39:24.220 --> 39:25.220]  Everyone wanted a Loud company.
[39:25.220 --> 39:26.220]  We were the first.
[39:26.220 --> 39:27.220]  We were the first.
[39:27.220 --> 39:29.220]  There was no other Louds before us.
[39:30.220 --> 39:35.220]  But then 2014, people started hearing there's Loud Farms in Kansas now.
[39:35.220 --> 39:36.220]  Yeah.
[39:36.220 --> 39:38.220]  Or Oklahoma, not Kansas.
[39:38.220 --> 39:40.220]  And there's another Loud company in Seattle.
[39:40.220 --> 39:43.220]  But there's probably 100 different Loud companies now.
[39:43.220 --> 39:48.220]  So it gets to a point, because it's not federally legal, to where how do you enforce it?
[39:48.220 --> 39:52.220]  And how much money do you really want to spend enforcing something like a trademark?
[39:52.220 --> 39:53.220]  Yeah.
[39:53.220 --> 39:56.220]  It's unenforceable at this point.
[39:56.220 --> 40:02.220]  Anybody who goes down that sort of rabbit hole is either well-funded and they don't care about losing money,
[40:02.220 --> 40:04.220]  because that's about the only people that could really do it,
[40:04.220 --> 40:08.220]  or they just don't quite get how the system works.
[40:08.220 --> 40:11.220]  Because once you get – there's no way to take it to the next level,
[40:11.220 --> 40:14.220]  because the next level is going to laugh at you and say, well, it's not legal, so what are we going to do?
[40:14.220 --> 40:19.220]  So you can only do it at a state level, which doesn't make it nationwide anyway.
[40:19.220 --> 40:22.220]  How can you be – you can't be nationwide if you're doing it at a state level, right?
[40:23.220 --> 40:26.220]  You kind of get – yeah, you're stuck.
[40:26.220 --> 40:30.220]  Yeah, if you look at like Runtz, Gorilla Glue, Skittles, these names,
[40:30.220 --> 40:34.220]  these guys have had uphill battles because of their names.
[40:34.220 --> 40:36.220]  Yeah, it was a dumb idea.
[40:36.220 --> 40:42.220]  I think the fact that people can't think outside the box and put something at least sort of original,
[40:42.220 --> 40:50.220]  I mean, it's like if it's not Lucasfilm or Disney or Nestle or one of these big –
[40:50.220 --> 40:55.220]  who really thinks that they're going to be able to take that anywhere federally once it gets to the federal level?
[40:55.220 --> 41:00.220]  They're going to get creamed, because there's going to be like 50 lawyers laughing at you.
[41:00.220 --> 41:04.220]  Like, you really put all your money into naming everything after Star Wars?
[41:04.220 --> 41:06.220]  Like, come on, dude.
[41:06.220 --> 41:08.220]  You've got to get a little more original.
[41:08.220 --> 41:14.220]  And that's the problem, is that the cannabis industry is kind of like always worked off of – we get it.
[41:14.220 --> 41:17.220]  We all love puns, and we all love to rip off logos,
[41:17.220 --> 41:20.220]  and we all think it's funny when you come up with something that looks like something.
[41:20.220 --> 41:26.220]  But you've really got to think like, okay, if I'm going to put too much energy into this, I might get my ass handed to me.
[41:26.220 --> 41:28.220]  Just like Hitman with his Dabachinos.
[41:28.220 --> 41:31.220]  It's like you copied it a little too close.
[41:31.220 --> 41:33.220]  I mean, it was a pipe.
[41:33.220 --> 41:36.220]  It was not a copyright infringement in any way, shape, or form,
[41:36.220 --> 41:41.220]  except for the fact that it was called the Dabachino, and it looked like their thing.
[41:41.220 --> 41:43.220]  So Starbucks, you know, they won.
[41:44.220 --> 41:50.220]  So it's just a matter of time before those people get caught up, I think, when they put too much energy into that kind of stuff.
[41:50.220 --> 41:55.220]  So I think with trademarks, you've either got to be dedicated –
[41:55.220 --> 41:58.220]  because I've trademarked as many strains as I could.
[41:58.220 --> 42:02.220]  A lot of stuff I couldn't trademark, like I couldn't trademark Bubblegum,
[42:02.220 --> 42:04.220]  but then somehow Simon from Serious Seeds got to –
[42:04.220 --> 42:06.220]  I was like, wait a minute, how did you do that?
[42:06.220 --> 42:09.220]  They told me I wouldn't have that because it was too general.
[42:10.220 --> 42:13.220]  But they did give me MK Ultra, which I thought was funny.
[42:13.220 --> 42:16.220]  So I'm like, oh, so I got the trademark for MK Ultra now.
[42:16.220 --> 42:17.220]  You got that here or over –
[42:17.220 --> 42:18.220]  I got that here.
[42:18.220 --> 42:19.220]  That's hilarious.
[42:19.220 --> 42:23.220]  And so I'm like, oh, so I can get government experiments and trademark their names,
[42:23.220 --> 42:26.220]  but I can't trademark the word Bubblegum for Seeds.
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.220]  But I think it's – what we call it is like surrounding the wagon right now.
[42:30.220 --> 42:36.220]  So basically you just cover your ass and trademark everything around the product,
[42:36.220 --> 42:40.220]  and when you legally can do the product when you're in a state like California, you do it.
[42:40.220 --> 42:42.220]  But it costs a fuckload of money, dude.
[42:42.220 --> 42:48.220]  We've spent tens if not hundreds of thousands over the last 15 years on just trademarks
[42:48.220 --> 42:52.220]  that we never, ever, ever, ever used in any way, shape, or form.
[42:52.220 --> 42:53.220]  Trademarks and website names.
[42:53.220 --> 42:58.220]  Except having that little TM and knowing it's real, you know, it has something behind it.
[42:58.220 --> 43:00.220]  But it's rough, right?
[43:00.220 --> 43:01.220]  Yeah.
[43:01.220 --> 43:02.220]  You're all over this stuff.
[43:02.220 --> 43:03.220]  Son of a bitch.
[43:03.220 --> 43:08.220]  And you've got 52 growers who are all like have no clue, half of them,
[43:08.220 --> 43:10.220]  what they're even doing when it comes to business, right?
[43:10.220 --> 43:11.220]  I mean, I can only imagine.
[43:11.220 --> 43:12.220]  You can't tell them that, though.
[43:12.220 --> 43:14.220]  No, but I know because I'm one of them.
[43:14.220 --> 43:15.220]  I'm one of them.
[43:15.220 --> 43:16.220]  I know exactly.
[43:16.220 --> 43:18.220]  I'm like, how are we doing this?
[43:18.220 --> 43:19.220]  I don't know.
[43:19.220 --> 43:20.220]  Well, we're doing it.
[43:20.220 --> 43:21.220]  Logistically.
[43:21.220 --> 43:26.220]  And that is part of the industry is like we've got to make it up as we go along because when it comes to seeds –
[43:26.220 --> 43:27.220]  Trill blazers.
[43:27.220 --> 43:32.220]  Well, seeds are always weird because seeds are like one of those things where it's either the most benign thing
[43:32.220 --> 43:34.220]  because you can't get high from it, right?
[43:34.220 --> 43:38.220]  It's just like you can have a thousand pounds of seeds in the room and we couldn't get high from it
[43:38.220 --> 43:40.220]  unless we found some weed that was mixed in between it.
[43:40.220 --> 43:44.220]  But when you grow that thousand pounds, you can take up the whole town.
[43:44.220 --> 43:48.220]  You can get the whole town, you know, you can get everybody high for miles, you know?
[43:48.220 --> 43:54.220]  So it's like the most dangerous thing in the world in one way to them and it's the most benign
[43:54.220 --> 43:58.220]  because if you get the right guy, he's just like, oh, yeah, nobody can, you know, explain.
[43:58.220 --> 44:02.220]  There's not more than .3 percent THC in that entire bag of seeds.
[44:02.220 --> 44:08.220]  So we're kind of in a weird zone where theoretically we should be able to sell those things in every 7-Eleven
[44:08.220 --> 44:13.220]  and everywhere in town because they are just like any other CBD product out there.
[44:13.220 --> 44:14.220]  They're .3.
[44:14.220 --> 44:18.220]  They follow all those things, but we haven't quite got there yet.
[44:18.220 --> 44:19.220]  So when's that coming?
[44:19.220 --> 44:21.220]  When is the 7-Eleven deal going down?
[44:21.220 --> 44:22.220]  So I don't know.
[44:22.220 --> 44:29.220]  The Farm Bill passed, the 2018 Farm Bill passed, which stated anything below .03 percent THC
[44:29.220 --> 44:33.220]  was considered hemp and was to be removed from the Consolidated Substances Act,
[44:33.220 --> 44:38.220]  which legally made seeds legal because they have, if you take 10 seeds, you take 100 seeds,
[44:38.220 --> 44:43.220]  you take 10,000 seeds, squish them all up, you're not going to get a 0.3 percent THC.
[44:43.220 --> 44:44.220]  It's just not going to happen.
[44:44.220 --> 44:47.220]  There's no cannabinoids in the embryo of a seed whatsoever.
[44:47.220 --> 44:52.220]  And so it's really hard to, you have to explain your case to MasterCard and Visa
[44:52.220 --> 44:55.220]  and tell them why they're different when they shut you down.
[44:55.220 --> 44:56.220]  Do they actually listen to you, though?
[44:56.220 --> 44:57.220]  No.
[44:57.220 --> 44:58.220]  They listen to lawyers.
[44:58.220 --> 44:59.220]  They listen to lawyers.
[44:59.220 --> 45:00.220]  Yeah.
[45:00.220 --> 45:08.220]  But yeah, so we're in this weird zone where it's like, you know, theoretically we should be able to,
[45:08.220 --> 45:13.220]  you know, conduct business like anybody else and sell our stuff to anybody, but we have to be, you know,
[45:13.220 --> 45:16.220]  that's why, I mean, I only have, he's my only distributor because of that.
[45:16.220 --> 45:22.220]  I kind of, I don't trust having it, because I feel like we're still kind of like overstepping still
[45:22.220 --> 45:25.220]  by the fact that we're crossing state lines and things are getting weird.
[45:25.220 --> 45:31.220]  Like the whole seed game is definitely one of those things where it's kind of like the Wild West still out there,
[45:31.220 --> 45:36.220]  you know, and it is, but it's also the best part of the industry because of the fact that it's changing
[45:36.220 --> 45:40.220]  and evolving and getting, you know.
[45:40.220 --> 45:42.220]  Genetics spread out throughout the world.
[45:42.220 --> 45:46.220]  Well, you know, that was one of our mottos of our company was always drop seeds, not bombs,
[45:46.220 --> 45:50.220]  because we felt like every time somebody bought a pack of seeds, they were going to their neighborhood
[45:50.220 --> 45:53.220]  and just like, you know, like they were, blah.
[45:53.220 --> 45:56.220]  I'm pretty sure DNA trademarked that.
[45:56.220 --> 46:00.220]  They're 10 years behind on everything they do, my friend, so it's fine.
[46:00.220 --> 46:02.220]  But, and Soma used it too for a long time.
[46:02.220 --> 46:06.220]  Soma would go out there and go, hey, what I always said, drop seeds, not bombs.
[46:06.220 --> 46:08.220]  I was like, are you kidding?
[46:08.220 --> 46:11.220]  We had T-shirts, posters, stickers, you know what I mean?
[46:11.220 --> 46:12.220]  Come on.
[46:12.220 --> 46:14.220]  But, I mean, we don't really care.
[46:14.220 --> 46:19.220]  We want more people to use the motto because the idea is it's real, you know what I mean?
[46:19.220 --> 46:24.220]  Like when you see neighborhoods change because somebody grew some fireweed, it's like,
[46:24.220 --> 46:26.220]  especially back in the day.
[46:26.220 --> 46:31.220]  Now, of course, it's kind of people are spoiled as usual, but there was times when people would come to the shop
[46:31.220 --> 46:37.220]  in Amsterdam and tell me how like by buying a pack of chocolate chunk seeds or whatever they bought at the time,
[46:37.220 --> 46:40.220]  they went back to their place and grew it really well.
[46:40.220 --> 46:42.220]  Everything changed, you know what I mean?
[46:42.220 --> 46:46.220]  Like now all of a sudden people are like, finally knew what good weed was.
[46:46.220 --> 46:51.220]  That's a good feeling as a grower because that's like with clones you don't get that because there's no trap.
[46:51.220 --> 46:58.220]  You know, a little bit, yeah, you might want to, you might go here to there, but it's always like it's weird.
[46:58.220 --> 47:00.220]  It's like clones make people weird.
[47:00.220 --> 47:01.220]  They're very horrid.
[47:01.220 --> 47:03.220]  There's a lot of hoarding going on and a lot of.
[47:04.220 --> 47:06.220]  That goes to the Katsu Bluebird cut.
[47:06.220 --> 47:08.220]  You guys are familiar with that, Katsu Bluebird online.
[47:08.220 --> 47:17.220]  You know, as a genetics out, but he bought the bubble cush cut in 2001 when he said he had a little too much money
[47:17.220 --> 47:20.220]  and not more money than he had since.
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.220]  He bought the cut for 500 bucks after he got it.
[47:23.220 --> 47:25.220]  So he got a small tree, great looking plant.
[47:25.220 --> 47:29.220]  The guy called him and said, you can't give away cuts, you can't sell clones.
[47:29.220 --> 47:31.220]  He was like, hey, that wasn't part of the fucking deal.
[47:31.220 --> 47:38.220]  And so for about four years online, if you emailed him, he'd send you a cut, only the only covet being you have to give away five cuts.
[47:38.220 --> 47:41.220]  And so if you were anybody and you mailed him, he'd mail you that clone.
[47:41.220 --> 47:43.220]  And that's how Bubba got out everywhere.
[47:43.220 --> 47:49.220]  And that's, you can imagine like you're in Illinois, you're on the forum, but you email this guy, he mails you the bubble cut.
[47:49.220 --> 47:51.220]  You're now like the king of your fucking block.
[47:51.220 --> 47:53.220]  Like you've got the fire-ish thing on the block.
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.220]  Everybody loves you.
[47:54.220 --> 47:55.220]  They're blown up your phone.
[47:55.220 --> 47:58.220]  I didn't email cuts back then, like wrapped in plastic.
[47:58.220 --> 48:00.220]  Oh, cigar tubes?
[48:00.220 --> 48:04.220]  Cigar tubes, you pack it in a cigar and then you'd cut the top off.
[48:04.220 --> 48:06.220]  Was it rooted or just fucking hot?
[48:06.220 --> 48:09.220]  Get some tobacco mosaic virus with it.
[48:09.220 --> 48:10.220]  Here you go.
[48:10.220 --> 48:12.220]  Have that along with your cut.
[48:12.220 --> 48:13.220]  No problem.
[48:13.220 --> 48:19.220]  Yeah, you would get the small plugs, not the standard rock wool plugs, but the small.
[48:19.220 --> 48:22.220]  So I always felt, I would do opposite.
[48:22.220 --> 48:29.220]  I would cut fresh and I would stick a whole bunch into like one piece of rock wool and then wrap that in plastic.
[48:29.220 --> 48:35.220]  And then put that into a poster tube and then wedge it in there so that you could flip it over either way.
[48:35.220 --> 48:38.220]  And then that would go through no problem.
[48:38.220 --> 48:43.220]  And the thing is, if you do them when they're fresh and you don't have any roots, there's no stress, right?
[48:43.220 --> 48:49.220]  Because when your plant has roots and you bounce it all around and you take it gets cold and hot and all that.
[48:49.220 --> 48:56.220]  There's, again, that's the same problem that we were saying earlier where you're kind of like, eh, you kind of, it's like you drop the baby.
[48:56.220 --> 48:57.220]  You know what I mean?
[48:57.220 --> 48:58.220]  It's going to be fine, honey.
[48:58.220 --> 48:59.220]  Don't worry.
[48:59.220 --> 49:03.220]  And then like third grade, you're all, fuck, I think I dropped it pretty hard, dude.
[49:03.220 --> 49:04.220]  I don't know.
[49:04.220 --> 49:06.220]  That was a problem.
[49:06.220 --> 49:15.220]  And with these plants, you see that quicker because you'll see one plant, you'll track one plant through and you'll realize like, oh, that's the one that I fucked the root ball up on or whatever.
[49:15.220 --> 49:20.220]  And you will see that that plant does not succeed as well as the other ones because it had trauma at that time.
[49:20.220 --> 49:24.220]  So I feel like when you take the cuts fresh, it's like a ER thing.
[49:25.220 --> 49:27.220]  It's like as long as you get it within a certain time frame.
[49:27.220 --> 49:37.220]  And in the beginning, this is pre-9-11, but I used to, we put a little LED light on the top of the tube and thinking like, oh, it's going to keep the photo period.
[49:37.220 --> 49:38.220]  But then later on I realized.
[49:38.220 --> 49:39.220]  They sell those too.
[49:39.220 --> 49:40.220]  It doesn't matter.
[49:40.220 --> 49:41.220]  And then nowadays you get clone tubes.
[49:41.220 --> 49:43.220]  Yeah, you can get the whole clone box and stuff.
[49:43.220 --> 49:53.220]  I still feel like to send it with roots is, unless you're going to do it yourself, like if you're going to transport it in a cooler and bring it to your friend's house and all that, it's cool.
[49:53.220 --> 49:55.220]  But then you put it into a mailbox.
[49:55.220 --> 49:58.220]  That guy just goes, okay, thanks and throws it behind him.
[49:58.220 --> 50:00.220]  You know that thing's on a rough ride.
[50:00.220 --> 50:05.220]  So I had clones shipped to my friend's mom's house back in the day and he forgot to pick them up.
[50:05.220 --> 50:07.220]  And it was two weeks later.
[50:07.220 --> 50:08.220]  I'm like, so do you have those?
[50:08.220 --> 50:09.220]  Are they growing?
[50:09.220 --> 50:11.220]  And he's like, oh, I forgot to get them.
[50:11.220 --> 50:13.220]  And so I'm like, fuck, they're probably dead.
[50:13.220 --> 50:15.220]  So he went over and got them and they were still alive.
[50:15.220 --> 50:16.220]  They were just fine.
[50:16.220 --> 50:18.220]  And they were in the dark for two weeks.
[50:18.220 --> 50:19.220]  That's crazy.
[50:19.220 --> 50:20.220]  So.
[50:20.220 --> 50:21.220]  Well, then you want roots.
[50:22.220 --> 50:23.220]  At that point you want roots.
[50:23.220 --> 50:30.220]  But I've had clones arrive that didn't go on a direct shipment, like got stuck for three or four days.
[50:30.220 --> 50:37.220]  And then it's just like, thanks for the box of dehydrated or just basically spinach that's defrosted.
[50:37.220 --> 50:38.220]  I've seen spinach.
[50:38.220 --> 50:40.220]  You're like, well, that didn't work out so well.
[50:40.220 --> 50:46.220]  But I think it's funny because people think it's so crazy moving cuts around like that.
[50:46.220 --> 50:49.220]  But back in the day it was just like, you got to do what you got to do.
[50:50.220 --> 50:52.220]  It made a huge difference when they did.
[50:52.220 --> 50:59.220]  It's such a good feeling when you get a clone from thousands of miles away and you get it to root and you're like, all right, now it's fucking on.
[50:59.220 --> 51:05.220]  And plus when it starts fresh there and it's got no distress, it's like it's all on you at that point.
[51:07.220 --> 51:08.220]  James.
[51:08.220 --> 51:09.220]  Yeah.
[51:09.220 --> 51:10.220]  You stop talking so much.
[51:13.220 --> 51:14.220]  Oh, man, that's all he wanted.
[51:14.220 --> 51:16.220]  That's all he wanted was a breeder drama.
[51:17.220 --> 51:18.220]  Oh, good.
[51:18.220 --> 51:19.220]  You got some.
[51:19.220 --> 51:20.220]  Oh, this is awesome.
[51:20.220 --> 51:21.220]  Feed us.
[51:21.220 --> 51:22.220]  Feed me, Seymour.
[51:22.220 --> 51:23.220]  Oh, yeah.
[51:23.220 --> 51:24.220]  Let's hear it.
[51:24.220 --> 51:25.220]  Oh, Jesus.
[51:28.220 --> 51:29.220]  Alpha females.
[51:29.220 --> 51:31.220]  Is it alpha females?
[51:34.220 --> 51:35.220]  Alpha Herm.
[51:35.220 --> 51:36.220]  Oh, my God.
[51:38.220 --> 51:39.220]  So tell us what happened.
[51:47.220 --> 51:48.220]  Check.
[51:49.220 --> 51:58.220]  Okay, so I got the Inzane, the Banana Hammock, the Crescendo, some other cross he gave me as a freebie.
[51:58.220 --> 51:59.220]  All fem.
[51:59.220 --> 52:02.220]  I just couldn't get it to go.
[52:02.220 --> 52:07.220]  So I was wondering what you guys thought of his fem crosses.
[52:07.220 --> 52:08.220]  Have you grown any of them out?
[52:11.220 --> 52:13.220]  So when you say they didn't go, what do you mean?
[52:13.220 --> 52:14.220]  They either dudded.
[52:15.220 --> 52:16.220]  They didn't germinate?
[52:16.220 --> 52:21.220]  They germinated to where they showed a little bit out of the soil.
[52:21.220 --> 52:22.220]  So it was like dampening off.
[52:22.220 --> 52:26.220]  Yeah, it showed itself and then it either died.
[52:26.220 --> 52:30.220]  But the ones that I did get to go, they were fire.
[52:30.220 --> 52:33.220]  And I've been following him for a minute.
[52:34.220 --> 52:35.220]  Hermaphrodite issues, you said, too?
[52:35.220 --> 52:38.220]  Yeah, so the Inzane, half of them hermed.
[52:38.220 --> 52:41.220]  The other two I kept and I breeded.
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.220]  I hit him with a male.
[52:44.220 --> 52:47.220]  But I understand, that's just how fucking shit goes.
[52:47.220 --> 52:49.220]  It's like you're breeding these crazy ass things.
[52:50.220 --> 52:54.220]  All plants will show intersex traits, but they shouldn't show them that quickly.
[52:54.220 --> 53:04.220]  One thing that I think breeders aren't doing right now, and this is something that I've been doing in the last year, especially with all the feminized work, is stress testing.
[53:04.220 --> 53:07.220]  You want to stress test the shit out of the plants you're breeding with?
[53:07.220 --> 53:11.220]  Because if you stress test them, then when you breed with them, you're less likely.
[53:12.220 --> 53:14.220]  I was talking to Rob Clark in Mojave.
[53:14.220 --> 53:16.220]  I don't even know who they are.
[53:16.220 --> 53:19.220]  Those guys are lame.
[53:19.220 --> 53:21.220]  Talking about that trait.
[53:23.220 --> 53:25.220]  We're talking about monoecious versus dioecious.
[53:25.220 --> 53:32.220]  Monoecious plants basically are the plants that hermaphrodite, that have both male and female organs on them.
[53:32.220 --> 53:37.220]  And how do you feel about that as his feminized line?
[53:37.220 --> 53:39.220]  Are you seeing that along his feminized line?
[53:39.220 --> 53:40.220]  It's not just him.
[53:40.220 --> 53:41.220]  It's a lot of people.
[53:41.220 --> 53:47.220]  I haven't seen it personally, so I can't comment on that.
[53:47.220 --> 53:55.220]  But I just feel like a lot of breeders aren't properly stress testing their plants if they're trying to breed stuff that doesn't have hermaphrodite traits.
[53:55.220 --> 54:06.220]  The biggest problem is that a lot of people, you can stand behind feminization all you want, but the reality is that these plants are just so fucking sneaky.
[54:06.220 --> 54:07.220]  Frankenstein.
[54:07.220 --> 54:09.220]  They're not going to wait around for you.
[54:09.220 --> 54:11.220]  They're not listening to rules.
[54:11.220 --> 54:12.220]  Put it that way.
[54:12.220 --> 54:13.220]  When you're like, it's impossible.
[54:13.220 --> 54:14.220]  It's like, no, it is not.
[54:14.220 --> 54:15.220]  We've seen it happen.
[54:15.220 --> 54:21.220]  The thing is, especially when we're now talking about millions and millions and millions of seeds at a time that are actually getting grown.
[54:21.220 --> 54:27.220]  Because before, there wasn't that many places that you could get to see somebody put down four million seeds.
[54:27.220 --> 54:30.220]  But now it's happening because of the hemp crops.
[54:30.220 --> 54:40.220]  So people are seeing four million seeds and they're going, okay, well, 275,000 of those four million are auto flowering and the other 275,000 are doing this.
[54:40.220 --> 54:46.220]  So these are real true numbers that are coming out that are like, okay, now we're going to get some real data.
[54:46.220 --> 54:49.220]  Yeah, I'm not trying to bash on the guy.
[54:49.220 --> 54:54.220]  He has great stuff, but just from the stuff that I've grown.
[54:54.220 --> 54:56.220]  Colin's problem is that he's so cocky.
[54:56.220 --> 54:58.220]  He's too cocky for his own good.
[54:58.220 --> 55:01.220]  I don't think he'll, I mean, he will probably replace the seeds.
[55:01.220 --> 55:04.220]  He replaced everything I had plus some.
[55:04.220 --> 55:05.220]  Oh, good.
[55:05.220 --> 55:07.220]  So there's no beef with that.
[55:07.220 --> 55:12.220]  I'm just saying like with all this feminized stuff, especially with the hemp that's coming online.
[55:12.220 --> 55:14.220]  I would say the hemp industry.
[55:14.220 --> 55:16.220]  All the working hemp companies that are like.
[55:16.220 --> 55:22.220]  So the hemp industry, some of the companies, I feel like that's a scaling issue that we're seeing with hemp right now.
[55:22.220 --> 55:27.220]  It's because what happened is we need all these hemp seeds because everybody's coming online to grow hemp.
[55:27.220 --> 55:30.220]  And so everyone's growing all those hemp seed outdoors and we're getting cross pollination.
[55:30.220 --> 55:39.220]  But when these companies first started, they had like intersexual traits of like 0.02 percent, which is like one in 5,000 male or hermaphrodite.
[55:39.220 --> 55:46.220]  But the fact is that if you're growing seeds outdoors, you're more than likely going to get cross pollinated by other stuff.
[55:46.220 --> 55:53.220]  Right. Whether it's regs from, you know, THC or whether it's other hemp, you're going to get that cross pollination.
[55:53.220 --> 56:03.220]  And I feel like the government's going to start regulating it and make people either grow in greenhouses that are basically with wet walls that prevent cross pollination or indoors.
[56:03.220 --> 56:10.220]  And you can't even sell seeds to Germany right now like hemp seeds unless you have phytosanitary certification.
[56:10.220 --> 56:14.220]  And I believe you need a CGMP certification.
[56:15.220 --> 56:19.220]  Well, that's the most anal place in the world. So, of course, they're going to make you fucking...
[56:19.220 --> 56:20.220]  They want leather.
[56:20.220 --> 56:21.220]  You must grow in rock wool.
[56:21.220 --> 56:23.220]  They're not going to let you come through easy.
[56:23.220 --> 56:37.220]  Yeah. And it's cool to see that because we're figuring out quickly also that as far as the hemp game goes, that the window for all the CBD guys is closing real fast.
[56:38.220 --> 56:49.220]  You know what I mean? Like, there are going to be some sore people this year when they realize that what they thought was going to be $30 million worth of something is going to be worth $300,000 or something.
[56:49.220 --> 56:54.220]  And if they can get it even to process, you know what I mean? That's the issue that we're running into.
[56:54.220 --> 56:56.220]  A lot of hot hemp.
[56:56.220 --> 56:57.220]  Oh, there's so much hot hemp.
[56:57.220 --> 56:58.220]  So much hot hemp.
[56:58.220 --> 57:03.220]  And imagine what... Imagine, like he was saying with the cross pollination, imagine what's going to happen in both directions, right?
[57:03.220 --> 57:07.220]  Like, there's going to be a whole bunch of shitty weed being grown because people are going to be like, oh, I got this fire.
[57:07.220 --> 57:11.220]  Well, and they're growing and making seeds from seed rather than using clones.
[57:11.220 --> 57:17.220]  So, like, if you really want to do breeding, I feel like it's more ideal to use a clone for your receiver.
[57:17.220 --> 57:23.220]  And then, you know, it's like with your donor as well, selecting that donor that you know that's tried and true when you're making your seeds.
[57:23.220 --> 57:25.220]  But a lot of people aren't even testing their seeds.
[57:25.220 --> 57:29.220]  They're just selling bulk seed, you know, at a dollar a piece.
[57:29.220 --> 57:34.220]  They're selling 100,000, 200,000, a million seeds to some of these companies, and they're not even testing them.
[57:34.220 --> 57:39.220]  Well, we saw stuff that was 13% THC that was supposed to be hemp.
[57:39.220 --> 57:41.220]  And this doesn't count for all the companies.
[57:41.220 --> 57:42.220]  And 0% CBD.
[57:42.220 --> 57:43.220]  I'm generalizing.
[57:43.220 --> 57:44.220]  Well, that was a good test.
[57:44.220 --> 57:45.220]  I mean, fuck.
[57:45.220 --> 57:47.220]  I think we're fucked, you know what I mean?
[57:47.220 --> 57:50.220]  Like, you have nothing to harvest at all there, you know?
[57:50.220 --> 57:54.220]  Well, and we haven't figured out cannabis, whether it's hemp or whether it's marijuana.
[57:54.220 --> 57:56.220]  We haven't figured out, like, the tomato industry has figured it out.
[57:56.220 --> 57:57.220]  Well, there's no marijuana.
[57:57.220 --> 57:58.220]  I mean, it's all cannabis.
[57:58.220 --> 57:59.220]  Well, it's all cannabis.
[57:59.220 --> 58:00.220]  See, don't get me wrong.
[58:00.220 --> 58:01.220]  You're swearing on stage.
[58:01.220 --> 58:02.220]  I can't believe it.
[58:02.220 --> 58:04.220]  It's all cannabis, right?
[58:04.220 --> 58:16.220]  And that's the funny thing, though, is we have waved in their face so hard with this smokable hemp right now, like, to the point where it's like, I know I'm not smoking smokable hemp.
[58:16.220 --> 58:19.220]  But a shitload of people are out there.
[58:20.220 --> 58:27.220]  And it's weird because, like, the whole point of us getting it legal was to say, hey, it's not like we're going to smoke it or anything.
[58:27.220 --> 58:29.220]  But all of a sudden, it's like, that's all we're doing.
[58:29.220 --> 58:31.220]  Well, it's marijuana drugs CBD, right?
[58:31.220 --> 58:36.220]  So it's just high cannabinoid, low THC cannabis, you know what I mean?
[58:36.220 --> 58:44.220]  And that's why the people that are growing good are getting, you know, 300 bucks a pound, let's say, for their smokable hemp.
[58:44.220 --> 58:47.220]  But that market's going to drop soon, too, because there's so much hemp.
[58:47.220 --> 58:49.220]  I mean, you see all the smokable hemp that's super fire, though.
[58:49.220 --> 58:50.220]  That's coming out for sure.
[58:50.220 --> 58:51.220]  Oh, it's out.
[58:51.220 --> 58:53.220]  But there's not as much.
[58:53.220 --> 58:57.220]  I think it's there technically, but it's not there.
[58:57.220 --> 59:00.220]  No one's producing it in large greenhouses that I've seen.
[59:00.220 --> 59:01.220]  Not in quantity, no.
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.220]  Not in quantity.
[59:02.220 --> 59:03.220]  This guy's not going to be able to do it.
[59:03.220 --> 59:05.220]  Is there going to be a drought 2.0?
[59:05.220 --> 59:06.220]  No.
[59:06.220 --> 59:07.220]  No?
[59:07.220 --> 59:12.220]  Not like the beginning of the year where shit went up to like 20 something, 100?
[59:13.220 --> 59:19.220]  The problem is that everybody saw that happening, and our reactions are so...
[59:19.220 --> 59:21.220]  They're quick and yet slow at the same time because we're stoners, right?
[59:21.220 --> 59:26.220]  So our reactions are like, we're all thinking the same thing, but no one's really getting up to do it yet.
[59:26.220 --> 59:30.220]  And then all of a sudden, it's like one day no one shows up, and they're all out doing it.
[59:30.220 --> 59:36.220]  And then they all come back online, and it's like, oh, shit, now we're all cashing in at the same time.
[59:36.220 --> 59:37.220]  And what we thought was all...
[59:38.220 --> 59:41.220]  So those markets, I feel like we're...
[59:43.220 --> 59:45.220]  There's always going to be a shortage of good weed.
[59:45.220 --> 59:46.220]  Always.
[59:46.220 --> 59:49.220]  There's always a shortage of good weed, but there's going to be way too much weed.
[59:49.220 --> 59:51.220]  Way too much.
[59:51.220 --> 59:55.220]  But the black markets really changed too because metrics aren't in place in California.
[59:55.220 --> 59:59.220]  So we have all these licensed companies that who knows where it's coming from.
[59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.220]  It could be coming from those licensed companies.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:08.220]  Because the black markets, those guys up in Humboldt and in Sonoma and in Mendocino, and even down here.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:13.220]  Those guys got hit hard this year, but there's still a lot of black market pot out there.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.220]  And then he's getting shipped out of town, right?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.220]  I have no idea.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.220]  No idea.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.220]  Out of town.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.220]  It's going to shoot the moon.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.220]  It's interesting how...
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:31.220]  I saw it maybe about five years ago, maybe even longer, maybe seven years ago.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:37.220]  Somebody in New York was telling me about $1,500 packs of sour diesel.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.220]  And it was all from out here somewhere.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.220]  And it was like, that's it.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.220]  It's over.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.220]  It's over.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:48.220]  If it's the same price on both coasts, what is there to be said anymore?
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.220]  And that was, like I said, seven years ago or something like that.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.220]  So the saturation points are getting...
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.220]  Oregon's a good example.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.220]  If you go to Oregon and see what...
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.220]  They have six years worth of weed in storage.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.220]  Six years.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.220]  And it's all just rotting.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.220]  And you know what I mean?
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.220]  Nothing's getting better.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.220]  Yeah, it's going to be the state of CBN for sure.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:11.220]  And just the fact that that's one...
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.220]  That's because they can grow pretty good there.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.220]  NorCal has become Southern Oregon, really, when it comes to the...
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.220]  Even the way the weather's moving.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.220]  Like it's all kind of moving up.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.220]  So the sweet spots are all up there.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.220]  And they just can grow too good.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.220]  And I think once it goes national, then Central California will control the market,
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:39.220]  as they do with all the other agriculture, too.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:45.220]  Yeah, once interstate sales go online, that's going to be a big-time game changer for Oregon.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220]  Well, they're the one...
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220]  I mean, they actually pushed for...
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.220]  They're currently pushing.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220]  They need to.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220]  To be able to sell out of state.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.220]  They're sitting on six years worth of rot.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.220]  And it's pretty awesome.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.220]  If they can pull that off, then that's really like the beginning of the end of the whole thing.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.220]  I mean, that's when it starts to crumble, because it'll just set precedence for other states to follow.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.220]  But now a lot of Oregon shops are doing is they're switching over to hemp licenses,
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.220]  because their hemp licenses are cheaper.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.220]  They don't have to deal with all the headache and all the bullshit and all the hoops.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.220]  So they're just paying $500 to get a hemp license and switching over.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.220]  I was there a few weeks ago, and it was pretty amazing to drive to the one farm that I had to go to.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.220]  I just passed probably 15 or 20 farms, and I didn't see a single person out.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:36.220]  And it was kind of eerie, because it was like, wow, there is a lot of harvesting to be done here and a lot of work.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.220]  And I don't see a single person out there doing any prep.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:41.220]  Like, no one kind of felt like they were ready for it.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.220]  Is it all frozen?
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220]  No, this is a few weeks ago.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.220]  So it was before that kind of snap came through.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220]  And we had it in Colorado.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.220]  We had one day, like we had just like all of a sudden out of nowhere,
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:58.220]  we had one day that dropped down to the low of 20 and the high of 38 and snow.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:06.220]  And then the day before was 70 degrees, and the day after was 87 degrees the day before and 78 degrees the day after.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.220]  So it was just this weird like one-day snap.
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.220]  There's a lot of hemp farmers losing money, fucking their stuff up.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.220]  They scale too big.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.220]  They don't know what they're doing.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.220]  I mean, I heard about two farmers in Oregon committing suicide.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220]  I don't know if you guys heard about that.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.220]  I don't know.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.220]  Was that real?
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.220]  I don't know.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.220]  But it should be a lesson for everybody, you know, that even if it's not real.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.220]  It seemed very orchestrated.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.220]  It was one of those stories where you're like, okay, maybe.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220]  It seems very dramatic.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.220]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.220]  I mean, you lose a bunch of someone's money like that.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.220]  I don't know.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220]  The fiber is strong.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.220]  No, you picked the right one.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.220]  Those stocks, yeah.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.220]  You definitely picked the right plant for hanging yourself.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:50.220]  That's what you want if you want to do it with your own hard-earned labor.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.220]  I mean, I paid money to the GoFundMe page.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.220]  Oh, so there was really a GoFundMe?
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220]  No, I'm kidding.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.220]  No, I saw that story, and I was a little bit like skeptical because it was almost like it was one of those deals where you're like, I was standing in line, and the girl turned around.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.220]  You read the whole thing, and then you realize this is just a troll-y thing.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.220]  Like what the hell?
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.220]  So what else in the industry have you thought of?
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.220]  What grinds your gears?
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.220]  Do you want to take a break?
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.220]  Sure.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.220]  Sure.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.220]  Sounds good.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.220]  Oh, thank you.
