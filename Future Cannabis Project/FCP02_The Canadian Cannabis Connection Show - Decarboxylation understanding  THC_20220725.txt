Hi guys, welcome to Canadian Cannabis Connection Show.
There's Jon Burfello.
Push-up time.
So, we're both going to be doing some push-ups.
I can only do five, but I know Mr. Toad is doing six a day and that's from a three-legged
man.
Okay, let me get over here.
Okay.
Make sure you touch the camera.
Make sure you touch the nose of the ground.
Make sure I'm hard.
And you stay consistent.
And get done.
All right, you just got to stay focused.
Make sure you get it done.
I mean, I really start popping off about 15, 16, I start slowing down just because.
You start feeling it.
Exactly.
And then you lose count and then you do an extra couple, one or two.
Yeah.
Okay, there we go.
Hey guys, so for the push-up challenge and well, I know Ken's trying over here.
Okay, yeah.
The whole thing is, is the stands don't really work that well.
Because they're these really crappy stands.
Oh yeah, well, you know, hey, you get what you can get, right?
It came with another stand for stuff.
Oh, Jesus.
All right.
Okay, we get it back up right.
This is four miles, right?
Yep.
I'm going to go off my toes.
Okay.
Sorry guys, technical difficulties live, you know.
Yeah, exactly.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry.
We're stoners.
We're a little bit crooked.
It's completely on an angle because he can just tell you by looking.
Oh my God.
Yeah, but I'm a little bit crooked.
John, I mean, come on.
I'm a crazy Canadian.
Okay, cheers everyone.
I hope you're having a great day.
You bet, guys.
Oh, here's the next thing.
See, instead of moving the camera, I'm going to move this stool.
This stool ran out of card.
Check this shit out.
That's how we start our day.
You ready for it?
Oh, yeah.
Let's get you up a little bit higher here.
There we go.
Cheers, Canadians.
Hi, 710.
How you doing, buddy?
I just had my phone in my hand, so I lost it.
Oh, right here.
The one that says,
Pond hand.
Hey, guy.
I want you to start your day with the ninja.
How we do this?
You got it.
That's how I start my day.
Get this out.
That's how we start it.
We have our celery.
We have everything in here.
We call it juicing power.
It's your juicing power.
So we're going to juice in the morning.
Can you see the carrots?
We got carrots, kale.
We got some kelp.
We got, you know what?
If you're not doing it,
you gotta do it.
Exactly, guys.
This is all about health and wellness.
And John is doing a total cleanse.
I'm probably, yeah, okay.
I don't know how my, I look, but hey,
I'm a crazy Canadian.
You can hear John using the ninja in the background.
He's on a juicing cleanse.
He's trying to cleanse his liver.
And he's going to be doing an ice challenge,
which means he fills up his tub of ice,
jumps in, and reinvigorates his entire body.
Things are going great in John's life.
He is improving his body, his health, his nutrition.
Well, you're trying.
More of these things than health, help me out.
If you use a lettuce, guys,
don't forget to add the cannabinoids at least.
Yes.
Okay.
This is where we're feeding our endocannabinoid system.
It's kind of like,
we got this juicing thing going on.
Like, we got to feed our ECF.
It's really important that you feed your endocannabinoid system.
So it's what I've been doing lately.
Okay.
Getting into the serious juicing of life.
Well, it's the essence of life.
And that juice gives us the biology
that exists in it.
And by juicing it,
and John's using a cold press juicing method,
which means there's no heat to kill any of the biology.
So it's giving us.
Yeah.
So if you guys have ever followed Kevin Jodry,
when he was doing his thing at the compassion,
they were juicing a lot of the cannabis leaves
and getting a lot of benefit from it.
So when you guys are growing
and you have some of those leaves,
you know, check out juicing it
because it is so, so healthy for you guys.
It's healthy for us.
Yeah.
And that's why John's doing it.
Yeah.
And I'm going to give you a little bit of a sneak peek
of what's going on.
Yeah.
And that's why John's doing it.
Well, it's that because I'm going to do cleanse,
which is a medical medium.
Okay.
Medical medium cleanse.
Yeah.
Let's grab the book.
Actually, just to cover.
Okay.
Cleanse the heal.
We're using weeds though.
Well, yeah.
Well, I mean, we're potheads, right?
You got to leave, right?
We're not potheads.
Well, that's true.
We're medical patients.
And that's where Medi-Kush that John grows
is such a wonderful plant
because it's his medicine.
It's the essence of the plant
that's helping him daily.
We're going to add a little bit of carrot in there too.
Along with kale,
a little bit of celery,
and some juice.
And we've got a lot of good things going in this little
thing here for breakfast.
Yeah.
You want to do a push-up challenge?
You know what, guys?
That's it.
Fantastic.
Now, the essence of the plant
is in that cold-pressed juice.
So John's getting those micro and macro nutrients
out of the juice
that he would have to consume
all of those fruits.
And there was a lot of stuff there.
Now he can consume the essence.
I missed this one.
And we're going to shift
back around to the kitchen.
There we go.
That's some green.
You bet.
We want to green the world, man.
How did you get your name up on the bottom?
Where's my name?
Okay, okay.
I'm feeling a little left out over here now.
Oh, no.
I got to, let's see here.
You're normally on two different cameras, buddy.
So like,
I know you are,
but I love you.
So we're going to put you in there, too.
No, we're not.
No? Okay, fine.
Anyway, guys, John's links are all in the description.
John Grafello.
All you got to do is look up John Grafello online.
You know, you're going to find him everywhere.
No, I'm not.
No?
I thought you were everywhere
I've been some, John.
No, where aren't you?
What country in the world has not written an article
on John Grafello's journey of healing himself with cannabis?
I don't know.
There's probably very many guys,
but John's been doing this for so long.
Well, thanks to Jason Wilcox,
and excellent Kurt Toussaint,
and John Conroy, Rob Loury,
and all the patients that fought for cannabis rights here in Canada.
I mean, I was just part of those people
that was part of the fight.
And because of my medical advocacy
and the work we've done in the industry,
and well, probably because of the intensity
of my injuries made me front page news.
And because everyone,
Morpheus was here with me.
Yeah, he's part of it.
And if you don't,
I haven't seen Morpheus,
he's been wandering around a lot.
Okay, this is like a limited edition.
Everybody wanted Block before,
and now he can't get great.
All right.
There goes Morpheus out the back door to go wandering.
Yeah.
You do that stuff?
Oh, yeah.
Well, Ken's been here for a whole week.
He hasn't left.
He showed up, he said,
I'm staying one night.
That fucking happens.
It's the coffee, it's the weed,
it's the company, actually.
This man, the passion.
What's that?
He said, I got to put you to work,
you have to stay.
And that's what we've been doing, guys.
John's doing a new series,
a growing on his channel,
on his YouTube channel.
And he's switching into some living soil stuff.
We're going back to living soil.
Yes.
Yeah, John started in the living soil
because growing,
that's what he did.
That's on YouTube.
We discovered we got to vinegar in 2015,
seven years ago.
We started with organic soils and compounds.
So we did that on soil mixes,
super soil mixes,
from stuff that we've been doing for years.
How I'm on my canvas cups and stuff like that
had all to do with living soils in a sense.
So when you go back to the days of growing,
and like I said,
we got lazy with bottom nutrients and water.
So when you go back to the old amendments
and exactly how growth happens,
we get better growth,
you get better turpey,
you get better quality.
And hey, you know what?
You don't grow better.
You grow better.
And proof's in the pudding, right?
Exactly.
Because if we kind of look at my growth
over the last decade,
where I was in the beginning,
I was in good shape,
and then I started getting into bottled nutrients
and the plants were getting fat
and they weren't tasting as well.
So I was also getting into bottled nutrients.
7-Eleven pizza subs.
Those are what we call bottled nutrients.
McDonald's, 7-Eleven pizza subs.
That's what we call bottled nutrients.
It's going to make you fat.
It's going to make you feel okay,
but it's not good for you.
Let me rephrase that.
Bottled nutrients are not good for your plants.
They look good and they can taste good,
but there's certain bottled nutrients
that are going to give you the best bang for your buck.
So really pay attention to what you have
and what you're putting into your plants
and what you're going to get out.
I mean, I'm not great.
I'm sitting here just drinking straight
our reverse osmosis water.
I'm going to have a great breakfast.
Yeah, baby.
So to really get into the medical medium
and taking a look at this whole thing
of juicing and juicing,
understanding celery juice,
the green drinks,
understanding yourself as a whole.
Ken's going to screw with the camera.
I'm going to try to level us up.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
We're kind of twisted.
Eating for health and not pleasure taste.
No, I eat for health
and I'm like, this is good.
That's just body going.
Yeah, this is what I need.
Give me more.
I don't like carrot juice to the whole idea.
And then knowing that I'm using
many cush, many lights.
I have to do some.
No, this was all made today.
It's a medical cushion.
Then medical lights.
So no, I don't like number five skunk.
He's crossed back into the old medical cush.
So I call it my many.
It's your medicine, baby.
I'm squishing.
That's the cannabinoids that work best for me.
And that's what works good for me.
So if you're a home grower
and you give this to yourself at home,
you can actually consume these leaves
maybe a couple of times a month
for those extra cannabinoids.
It's not something you do every day.
Something like the wheatgrass every day.
It's not into me.
Once or twice a week is a good time.
Get a little bit of green.
It's not a daily.
It's about balance.
It's not about anything about campus.
A thousand percent.
That's what we're talking about.
We're talking about juicing, raw juicing foods.
This is information is so good for this.
What I need for this man.
Cheers.
Cheers to the northern neighbors.
Nice to see him.
We're up here juicing the great white north.
Yeah.
I got the northern light number five skunk.
He's in this drink here right now.
So we're going to go north as far as we can.
Go with the northern lights.
Yeah.
John starts to lock earlier.
You can join him for the 5 a.m. club
and go on a walk with John.
And he does his pushups while he's out there guys.
I do them at 4.20 a.m.
And it's really important.
So I do 60 pushups by 6 a.m.
This is that I can start my living soil beds.
So Dan writes, I'm flipping my living soil beds today.
So that was a seven day bench.
Like I said, we're eight days in the bench.
So I'm flipping those beds today.
And I had Ken actually help me add the biology.
So we got the biology.
We got the lactic acid bacteria.
Your labs.
That would be one of the labs.
Yeah.
Water soluble calcium and a fish amino acid.
That's all I had with me.
So that's what we added.
So apparently there's supposed to be more.
There is actually like seven implements
that Cree Natural Farming has.
How often do I get to put these seven implements in?
I'd say once every two weeks.
And a lot of people do a foliar feed
up to flower and then they'll.
Because it's all about the biology.
Biology in the system.
This isn't a food.
This isn't feeding your plants.
This is feeding the biology.
The whole system is your plants.
Because the cell develops through biology.
You have to have biology for breakfast.
Let me tell you.
Damn right.
And yes, John has been making me drink that stuff.
And yes, it does taste sometimes like buckleys.
But it works.
You know.
I haven't got a can of push up challenge yet.
Yeah.
Finally.
And Mr. Toad, Leslie's brother.
Toad, I heard you doing push ups.
You're amazing dude.
I appreciate you.
You know, this is the most spinal cord injury.
If people don't know.
I broke my neck in four places.
I have a C6 burst fraction.
I'm plated between the C5 and C7.
And I'm bolted between the C3 to the C6.
So I'm front and back plated.
And for me, it's about weed.
It's what helps me every day.
It's what feeds my endocannabinoid system.
That's the best way of saying it.
I feel great because I use cannabis for pain control.
On a daily basis.
We're talking like all the time.
But I know how to regulate my cannabinoids.
Do you have any doubts?
I'm just, yeah.
I just do a lot of magic.
I think, Ken's been here and I'm walking in and out every hour.
Doing a massive dab.
What are you doing?
Taking 200 milligram caps.
Because you know, Sundays are my Mondays.
And Sundays are just Sundays.
And I'm here helping John.
Absolutely.
I'm going to be going to work.
We'll be talking about living soils.
We'll be talking about doing cover crops.
And a little bit talking about maybe not doing that right now.
A lot of work I want to get into.
And you know, just me being who John is.
And you guys have been watching me for over a decade.
I mean, I'm just all about making sure I have growth.
I need to ensure.
Every other week, OHN helps.
Hey, JDN, if you're down here, John, could you use some OHN?
What's OHN?
Oriental Herbal Nutrients.
It is made with a combination of different foods.
Whoa, slow down!
OHN.
Oriental Herbal Nutrients.
What's that?
Pardon me?
Ow.
I said ow, too.
Nothing hurt.
This probably went ow.
And it's taken away from the...
Oh, I missed it.
We were stoned and we missed it.
Lily, what was that?
And thank you.
A blessing to my wife.
Living Soil, the only way to go.
Check out Build a Soil 3.0.
I love his H2O Only.
Water only.
When you get to that point, and you can, it's brilliant.
Oh, that's right, JDN.
I did.
I planted some plants on the ground.
Water only?
Yeah.
Nature, if it rains, you know.
Oh, you guys should see the amazing trees in John's backyard.
And I'm not even talking to cannabis.
I'm talking, he's got grapes and plums and all this fruit.
Apples, plums, pears.
Apples.
Yes.
Pears.
I got a mulberry tree.
Yes, I've never had a mulberry in me.
I can't tell them they're on the right by him every morning.
That's why I can't find any.
Because he's eating them, right?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
That's the largest mulberry tree in the world.
Oh, well, there you go.
Awesome.
It's bigger than my house.
So what are you jazzing on, brother?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Okay, John's going to choose, and he's got quite the selection here.
Oh, there's Tim Treveaper.
Right there.
There's a closest one to me.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, it's cool, guys, right?
I'm a zigzag guy.
Yeah, yeah.
Speaking of speaking.
Oh, there you go.
Half price, guys.
There's a bedtannercanada.com.
Okay, well, there you go.
Bedtannercanada.ca.
It's a pretty good deal.
I'll hook your stuff up.
There you go, guys.
We got your four.com.
Like we got your four.
It only makes sense, right?
We got your four.com.
We got your four needs for your growing needs.
It'll be your growing chance.
Your screens, your bubble bags, your four main necessities, your candle clamps, your
four main things you're asking getting a solubles extraction.
That's what I wanted to talk about, guys.
So it's about growth, and it's about solubles.
Yes.
It's about the dryness.
It's about that concentration.
I didn't.
We're going to talk about.
Hold on a second here.
It's about the Barfello bounce.
Okay, the Barfello bounce.
And if you guys are going to know what we're talking about, Google it.
That's called first bounce.
Yeah.
Because they keep associating it with kid bouncing, so it keeps leading up.
Okay.
So, ta-da!
The Barfello bounce.
We have just remarketed that to the Barfello Bounce guys.
After.
You know, hashtag that.
The Barfello bounce.
Okay, let's get that out there, and let's spread it around.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, I want them to do it, too.
We got two of you guys here now.
Yeah.
34.
Right on, guys.
Thank you very much for showing up.
You know what's better?
When all of you hit share.
Yes.
Like, subscribe, share.
Don't like.
Don't like?
Why?
Oh, no.
I like them.
Share.
Okay, share.
Hashtag.
I'm kidding.
Do it anyway.
How about just cannabis?
Future cannabis project.
Hashtag cannabis, because that's what it's all about.
Okay, it took me five days.
Don't hashtag anybody.
Hashtag cannabis.
Yes.
Okay, there you go.
Hashtag cannabis.
It took John five days to figure out no, Ken's from Alberta, not Saskatchewan.
Saskatchewan's a little bit bad.
So, JD and he had me with you, brother.
Had me a province over.
So, where are we going to talk decarboxylation and how to do it?
For me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What I was doing was wrong and I didn't understand it and I want to make sure you guys understand.
I don't know if you guys caught this yet.
Maybe not.
Ken's telling me to get your CBD.
Or Yenifunk.
I brought it.
This is the one right here.
That's 50% THC.
It's 50% THC.
It's 50% THC.
It's 50% THC.
It's 50% THC.
It's 50% THC.
You know what's really nice about this?
Because as we're talking about this, it turns out it's a good old self-control of CBD.
I can use my Buster.
It's not funny, Jay.
You know, some of the people who like to be involved in some of this, in that place, go,
yeah, this is the weasel ground.
This is the shit.
I said, yeah, this is great.
Ken takes cows.
What are you looking for?
I was looking for my Buster.
Cool.
Okay, do you want me to tap and hold on that one?
No.
Okay, guys, I'm wrecking the place.
Okay, John's going to shoot me pretty soon here.
I don't know.
Okay, so let's get back to Ken.
Sell me a set of screens and I'll follow you up.
Well, you know what?
You can definitely go to, um, just go to FreshEggies.com.
Buy screens from Mark.
He hasn't even bought them.
I think they're from Amazon.
They're like a hundred bucks.
I had to leave, but I don't.
I think they just hashtag me like crazy.
All my videos attached to it because they, for one, I'm not going to sell a knockoff product.
My friend sells them.
I don't want to support it, but if you only got a hundred bucks, you can buy a screen.
I don't know how long they're going to last, what the quality is, but the quality screens
that I use every day are from FreshEggies.com.
You can go to screen printing place.
You can have these screens made.
You can have a 90, a 110, a 200, and a 304.
That's lines per square inch.
So L, I, not mesh sizes.
We did that with a pipe.
They brought me mesh.
That's not, that's wrong.
It's going to be for a bubble bag.
You look at 90, 120.
Those are different sizes when it comes to lines per square inch for making dry-sift.
Just so you know.
So, I like, um, first bounce, Perfetto bounce.
And that comes off of 110 that lines on the 200.
This is a very important part of it.
And, um, you know, from there you can actually then decarb.
And you can take that sift and you can do it several different ways.
So when it comes to product, if you're going to make, um, like an oil or, and you want
to make a butter, you can use this either in 8 for 1.
You can actually decarb the wheat by putting it into the butter or the oil into a deep
fryer actually.
And when you heat it and you bring it up to a certain temperature.
And we'll talk about temperatures.
It's in a video on how to decarboxylate.
It's on my channel, which is John Perfetto.
It's official on YouTube.
That's in the description.
And there will be a whole series on how to decarboxylate.
And I show you four different methods for baking it in the oven, for doing it on a stove
top, and then for doing it in an impression cooker.
Is that in the mini baking series?
All mini baking series.
So look that up.
So I'm showing you all different types of ways in how to decarboxylate.
This is what I learned back in 2006 from Dr. Paul Cormier.
He is the guy who found out how cannabis bind to the receptors.
And then after that we had Harper's Side, which was Steve D'Angelo, 2007, 2008.
Paul said he was a fly on the wall.
It's kind of funny.
Okay, hold on guys.
I got to ask, can I get a toker polka, please?
Why?
Because I want to poke down the end.
Okay, John.
You know, I'm a perfectionist.
I would like to be able to stand my joint up here and have it just sit there.
The whole thing is a toker polka.
It's going to be a little split when you have it like that, because all you're going to do is pull it up.
Ken's not the best roller.
Hold on.
I'm a living soil nerd, baby.
Okay.
I used to smoke a lot of cannabis when I was really young, like teens and early twenties.
But yeah, John knows.
Okay.
Okay.
I get the baby one.
Good morning.
If you could use a toker polka on that, it would have made a shitstorm.
Yeah.
I'd be wanting to use your toker polkas, you guys, but your bongs for a lot of people doing these poppers.
Okay.
We don't talk a little much about going to hit the poppers.
You don't want to talk about these are very, very popular amongst young people out there.
I missed 1020.
So happy 420 wherever you are in the world.
It says 1024.
Good enough.
We got a two, a four and a zero.
420!
See how that works.
We can make 420 anywhere that we want, whenever we want and celebrate, guys.
Positive emotion, positive energy.
Love this world.
Love this planet.
Love each other.
Love yourself.
You're the one that has to make the decisions in your life.
Okay.
Enough of that shit.
Why am I?
I'm just saying.
Blah, blah, blah.
It's Monday morning.
I love this guy.
I feel like you're in love right now.
You're at work.
You're listening to us.
You're not at work.
You're in pain.
You're doing something.
I'm not a dad.
Happy Monday, guys.
Blessings, everybody.
Oh, yeah.
Lily's sitting at home, running the back end, putting the comments up.
And I love that woman.
She is an angel.
I'm going to be home.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
You can't leave tomorrow because I need some stuff.
I'll help you stay until Wednesday.
John doesn't want me to ever leave because I keep helping.
It's more convenient.
Well, yeah.
I'm not going to be using the neighbors.
They just show up.
They just walk in the backyard.
Eddie shows up.
Mike shows up.
Oh, it's great.
Cheers.
And oh, sounds amazing.
Yes.
And thank you guys for great comments.
This is what the community is all about.
Interaction with you guys in our day.
This is our day.
OK.
John did his juicy because that's what he does at that time.
And we're just we're alive.
We're living.
We're alive.
We're real.
Phone grab.
Yeah, there you go.
And if you guys haven't seen these things, I've never seen one.
And it's like, what the fuck is that thing?
And I'm well, John showed it to me.
It's like, wow.
And he I think he's going to be on your website pretty soon, right?
Oh, there you go.
Oh, we'll see.
As that explains it.
I thought Ken was trolling a kid.
Your mouth with this book.
They're all over my head.
I've had these websites for a decade.
So you can go to Canada, go on Amazon, of course.
You know, look, I'm saved all the turps, though.
Turps.
Canada, man.
We're kind of man.
I got all those sites.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You go to Canada close to me.
Well, yeah.
You go to Canada, you go to Golan.
I represent the company.
It's because it's such a great product.
And so save the turf.
The big thing for me is about the research.
It's understanding how the turpines are evaporating.
Understanding the moisture content.
Understanding when you join smoke something at 50% humidity and how it affects your throat.
I'm going to find out why.
Yeah.
We're going to test that.
The next crop is going to be grown.
We're going to cure with different humidity levels.
And we're going to burn those cannabinoids, burn that product at 62%, at 55%, at 45%, at 35%.
These humidity maps will be in the jars.
This will be moisture tested.
It will be A.W. tested.
After water content inside the jar, it will be then tested on a machine, burned, rolled,
and smoked through a machine to a column.
And then we're going to take a look at it.
Hold that.
And you guys get to follow along.
The best thing is about business is everything to do with the companies and the people who
are working towards this and actually looking at what's really going on.
And what's really good about this is understanding the research, understanding the A.W.,
understanding the turpines, understanding the dysregulated turpines,
understanding the water activities, everything coming down to standardizing those turpines
for the medical patients so we get the same accuracy over and over.
I spent decades trying to standardize my medicine.
It comes down to one thing, saving the turps.
That's why it's on a shirt.
I saw a bag you have from Boveda.
Do you happen to have one of those close by?
Which bags?
The ones in Asia.
Yeah, and Mums Cup's coming up in August after the Unicorn Cup.
Yeah, August 26th, 28th.
Yeah.
Canada's future project.
Canada's future.
John Carter, right!
OK, thumbs up everybody.
Fiji water just got snow melt.
It's Canada Bud.
Nice.
OK, cool.
Oh yeah, I'm repping Fiji here.
This has been empty for days.
It's just being refilled from John's RO system every day.
My house is RO.
Yeah.
Oh, talk about a soft water for showering in.
It's beautiful.
Know the turps.
Or know your turps.
Yes, Chris.
Or Chris Cookie.
Yes, know your turps.
That's why John has grown the same strain for, what is it, 18 years now?
18 years.
He knows that plant so well.
It's like I grew my sour diesel for two and a half.
And you get to know the plant.
What's that?
Yeah.
Yeah, so I was talking to a gentleman, Maurice, and he's been growing the same CBD strain
which I know of for 25 years.
Well, we've got to bring that back up.
OK.
Bubble magic.
Yeah, and the yellow snow adds extra nitrogen.
Are you writing your name, Bubble?
OK, you've got to write your name, brother.
I think we made Bubble Hush in the Chikungun River and we actually had contaminants that
were coming down the river because we washed up on the river.
Yeah.
We see contaminants underneath the background.
And there was a lot of plastic in the river.
So we found this and stuff like that.
So it was amazing how much contaminants are in the snows.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
January 2020, small amounts of cannabis will be legal in Illinois for some years.
Well, that's fantastic.
Right on.
So, you know, we're certainly slowly legalizing around the world.
So we're going to take it around the world the green way with us.
Yes, the green way.
And that's John's thing.
The green way.
The green way of life.
Thank you, John, Ken, for holding the door open for us Canadian cannabis enthusiasts.
We may be slow to the punch, but we're watching, listening and building.
We come in slowly.
We are, baby.
We are a movement.
We are growing.
We're laying more candles.
Yeah.
There's a lot of us that didn't even know there was a movement happening like I didn't.
I was just going on with my life.
Right.
I was driving truck.
But now, baby, I'm in it.
One hundred and ninety nine percent.
I watched one of our videos.
Dancing.
This guy's deep too.
Yes.
It's kind of like your life.
It lasts forever.
And it's how you put into it.
And what you want is what you get out of it.
Yes.
And understand that.
So like when I said I want to see legalization, I want to see this plant being around the
world, where I can have access to it.
We're slowly seeing this.
The stuff that we all want.
You, me, others, people.
Legalization.
Legalization is like I said on the news.
It's hitting the ground.
It's bouncing a few times.
But it's there's nothing you can do about it.
East Coast 90Z?
Or 902.
Do you know Dale?
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Dale.
Hey, man.
Bless his brother.
He's awesome.
He's got some great people and the people that came down and brought his name to the
wheelchairs.
It's just like in those stories.
We all have the same story.
We all have the same story.
Your story is the same as mine.
Yeah.
I'm going to go back and forth across Canada, man.
I'm going to go to Scotland to hang out.
Can't turn into Bob Ross?
Is Tim Kristoff?
Is that that painter?
Because London, he's come down the stairs.
I'm sitting with some of his family.
And he says, Bob Ross.
And everybody turns and looks at me.
It's like, OK, what?
What have I done wrong?
Who's Bob Ross?
Right.
It's like, hey, cheers, Billy.
Yeah, some painter, dude.
I don't know.
And he can become a mass produced product, mass fully useful.
Damn right.
It's a food.
It's a fiber.
It's a fuel.
And it's my medicine.
Six basic human needs.
Right now, we're talking to fuel to food.
Come on over.
And that's what cannabis is.
Yeah, it's all it suits all of us.
Yeah, it can power cars.
It can give you the problem.
Three six and nines, which is you got more oils coming in a hemp seed than you do out of your fish oil.
So yeah, three six and nines is like three percent.
I did a little research on this back in the days and stuff.
We pulled it out of the file and kept it.
Talk about decarbonizing.
Talk about why we're heating at different times and temperatures.
Yeah, we're seeing different times and temperatures for different activation points for different strains.
Yeah.
So I know we've got a rough base point right now.
We're down to 325 to 280, down to 320.
Right.
We've gone to 260 and there's different times too, right?
So you can go for an hour and a half, go for 20 minutes.
We know things can be decarboxy at 325.
Yeah.
Well, you look at what you're doing on here.
There's a hot dab and then there's a cold dab.
And the cold dab is totally different than a hot dab.
These are volcanoes.
So we did preliminary experiments with a volcano.
It's a Dr. Romy experiment.
You'll find it on Cannabinoid Research and Development.
You can write this in.
Yeah, we did a preliminary experiment with a volcano with Dr. Paul Romy and myself.
And we spent a long time looking at decarboxy and how the cannabinoids were actually burning off.
We also did how much THC was left in your roaches.
And that was another $10,000 worth of testing.
It was pretty cool.
And we actually burned it down to look at the different ways of how the THC was decarbing,
how much THC was left at the end of the joint.
But it was like, you know, twice as much cannabinoids in the end of the joint as it was at the beginning.
We saw that breakdown, which we all know.
But understanding these methods and how things do decarb and why.
And then understanding we can decarb CBD to CBDA, but you're not going to decarb your THC to CBD.
And this is where Ken came down to see how thought he had some beautiful dieselated smoke.
And he had to put it out because it got too hot.
All that CBD he's been just eating.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And Ken came over after everything, oh, you're eating CBD?
That's pretty awesome.
Here, have this 50 milligram.
Yeah, didn't really touch it because all that CBD is being taken, right?
Hey!
I guess that CBD does block THC.
Okay, can I ask a question though?
Okay, if I did it in the oven so that the molecules could actually vaporize,
because I'm doing it in the jar which is holding the man.
Pretty simple.
Could I be doing it just in CBD?
You can convert CBD to THC, but I don't know the whole things of effects on it.
Okay, Dale, hit me up on my website.
Just go to the contact form, send me an email and we will set this up, brother.
I am coming.
I got invites to Nova Scotia to sit over and look at the ocean and smoke some wonderful weed.
And yes, I am.
I'm looking forward to this.
It's going to be a fantastic time.
Yes, yes.
Lauren, Kevin and it's really important for growers and the community to want to get involved
in this decade and this era.
The passion of these people.
I understand a lot of the people that we're talking about that we did a decade ago have passed.
Yeah.
And some of the greats in our industry are no longer here to lead the song.
So then we need some new blood, some new passion.
Yes.
People who want to take the song and journey.
You know, you're in your 30s or your 20s, get a little bit of that.
I'm just willing to learn and teach and understand and help others that help me
and help you help others and help the community.
Oh, I've learned so much from the unique of Ben Lifter.
I know Ken's been with me.
Yes.
Johnny's an apprentice.
Anybody need to apprentice to become a master grower?
He's the master of the master.
There's no such thing as a master.
Yeah, yeah.
He's good, though.
That's all we say.
People who have expertise and longevity of certain strains, of certain long patterns.
Yes.
We all run different patterns from the guy that grows down the street down in California
to the guy that grows in Neve.
And we all run different growing patterns.
We all have different techniques.
We all have different sources of our nutrients.
We all have different companies around the world.
It's not like these companies are in every part.
Does CBD and CBN isolate need to be decarbed?
The isolate's already decarbed.
OK, there you go.
The isolate's already decarboxylated already.
So no, stay human.
We've got a little bit of a hot temperature.
And like when these things are decarboxylated.
I'm thinking right now, guys.
OK, Joe might have to stretch this out, take a little walk.
So, yeah, guys.
So we got the Unicorn Cup coming up.
That's down by Selmo in the Kootenays.
I'm going to be there for that in London.
Then we got the Mums Cup a couple of weeks later in London.
We're going to be live streaming that.
We're working out the logistics.
It's a three day event.
And we actually may be able to share from beginning of the event
right to the end of each day of all the speakers and everything.
We're working on that to bring you a bunch more voices
and listen to multiple voices.
The more you listen and grow and more you understand.
And that's why I listen to John's voice.
He's my expert in cannabis.
Or I consider him, he doesn't consider himself to be that.
For me, it's all about respect.
And I respect this crazy guy.
I respect him.
I respect you guys.
It's all about caring, sharing, and community.
Lily, I missed that.
Do you want to grab that back up?
What in the...
I don't speak emoji.
What is it?
Grapes.
It looks like a cluster of grapes.
Because John's eating grapes.
He's got some growing outside.
Come on.
Talk about healthy.
When you have access.
I lived in the Okanagan for a while.
And the fresh fruits and vegetables that you can go down to the local farmer.
You guys, buy local.
Buy from Ontario.
Buy from your local food association.
Look at CSAs.
Try to get in touch with your farmer.
Grow relationships.
Damn right, Mr. Davis.
It's all that community that's going to help us through this bullshit that's going on.
Those are the connections.
Wine country.
Oh man, 710.
I'm not coming to see you, man.
Because I drank some ice wine a while back.
And shit, man.
That stuff is wicked.
That's like Mew Pee Street.
Okay.
That's good, though.
You got ice wine?
Okay.
John's probably going to go and grab a bottle of ice wine.
I mean, can you get...
Look at John's fridge.
It's cannabis infused.
Regenerative agriculture.
Anybody knows where this might have came from?
Recognize me now.
Recognize the name?
This is from Peter Steeve.
The own Rollingdale Gondaran.
And this is some of his...
I have some of his sweet tooth.
And some of his old ice wines and stuff like that.
That were all cannabis, you know, related.
But they weren't.
Yeah, I do have.
Yes, it does.
If you're here, too, they're saying CBD, Box THC.
Yes.
So, yeah, Dr. Lynn Ingham.
Yes, that beautiful woman.
She's been fighting this battle a long time, guys.
And we're taking it.
We're going to pick up the torch.
Every single one of us that believes in living soil and biology.
This is our fight, guys.
Good subject, Jesus.
Oh, man.
Jesus, you got...
I mean, you keep changing your name from here to here.
Yeah.
I don't know how many Jesus accounts Jesus has.
But he's a lot of people.
Blaze the lilac cookies flower great turd profile.
Okay, right on.
Yeah, there's so many flavors and aromas.
And, like, I like to use my nose.
Like, I've looked at...
I haven't done a lot of dabs.
But I've smelled pretty much every one that John has.
Because that tells my body, yes, I like this or I don't.
If I like it, then that's what I would want to consume.
Because my body's telling me, I'm going to like it.
I'm going to consume because my body's telling me there's something in there that's going to help me.
And it smells like shit.
Oh, Lily, put it back up, please.
John was reading it.
No, it's okay.
Oh, no, I was saying, okay, whatever.
Okay.
Wow, once in a while, I just get really sharp pains.
And it's probably related to just rigor on the whole side.
So it's coming in.
Sorry, guys.
Always be steady, falling short, and standing strong.
Like a kind of community hub.
Among teacher and international can see.
We've got to just, yeah, we got to find the right people and stick together.
CBD weekly binds to CBRs, but it's capable of antijog, I forget it, guys.
The effects of THC, even when the former is present in low doses.
By inhibiting the generation of endogenous anabenoid.
Okay.
Yeah.
See, this is why I need my wife to have a microphone.
Because I can read that.
Endogenetic?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, something like that.
I think you probably said endogenetic.
Without me even seeing it when you're trying to say it, I'm sorry.
He knows the language.
You know, it's as simple as that.
I like that man right there.
Yes, yes.
They do a celebration of life for that man in September.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So how many of you guys caught London's Wedding?
CBD, peace, yes.
Do not disrespect.
CBD intensified, the prolonged, its effect.
Okay.
It's about bumping the the.
Can have an off the receptors that exist with the THC when you take the CBD, it bumps those receptors.
If I'm right, and I believe I am.
Am I correct on that, John?
And happiness.
Holding regenerative agriculture movement back is political agribusiness.
Correct?
Oh, yeah.
See, we got what we got to do is we got to get the CBD.
We got to get the CBD.
We got to get the CBD.
We got to get the CBD.
Oh, yeah.
See, we got what we got to do is we got to come in the back door.
We got to slip in from the side and get a voice in there at the very grassroots.
It's about meeting the people themselves.
We can't advertise.
You got restrictions, but I can go out and talk to people.
John can go and talk to people.
I do in the safe way.
I used to do in the parking lot.
And just in the lineup.
Yeah.
And we had a conversation with someone in the lineup.
And then everybody ran.
I talk loud.
So I make sure people can hear me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because you got a lot to say.
But John's the one that's standing in the front of the line holding the sign going,
yeah, I am the man and you're not taking this from me.
We all have to be that.
Yeah.
And it's all about saving those Turks, though, right?
I feel like I'm just like a ruined dog.
OK.
OK, guys, John's got some voodoo.
So anybody out there that can send Johnson positive energy,
put a white light of protection around this.
This is how we get the pain.
This is this is me getting to pain right now.
So I love you all from Kauai.
Who done?
Thank you, man.
Yeah, we try to be positive.
We try to love and give joy and happiness because that's how we live our lives.
Like you got positive people, bring positive energy, live in that positive energy.
Like John's dealing with some real, real pain right now.
I can see it in his face.
So if you need to go lay down, brother, you go lay down.
See, this is a man that does not give up.
There's no retreat.
There's no surrender.
It's you move forward.
And if we all move forward as a mass, we all know you can see.
You got to consume it.
You got to educate.
We talk a lot about what we're doing here and stuff like that.
But I mean, what it really comes down to is it's grown to oneself.
Yeah.
And when you get into growing for yourself and understanding what you're getting from it.
So it's more of a one time.
Yes.
Yeah.
Campus cultures, renewalization and events.
You say we need to get more involved, more community, more events.
Legalization in Canada.
We can ask to turn on three events.
So, you know, three happy cats.
They're going to be having more events that are going to be cannabis related.
We're going to see more events throughout the industry, more legalization, stuff like that.
Yes.
Sure.
30 grams.
You can you can you can send 30 grams.
You can give away weed.
You can grow and give it away all day long.
Yeah.
JDN.
Yeah.
And the thing is, like the three happy cats, they've been around.
They've taken a break.
She's five kids.
Bless the young lady.
She's taking a break and spend some time with those children growing up.
And now she's back and she's arranged this event in like, you know, it's almost like
minutes from the first time I heard about it to bang.
She's got it happening.
It kind of.
And she's a woman with passion and she loves this plant and she loves this community.
So three happy cats.
So don't forget to.
She's on Facebook.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So check out three happy cats on Facebook.
She was here.
She gave some stuff away.
I think if you guys follow her, you could be on the stream and she could give you guys
some stuff.
So, yeah, check her out.
I'm going to be doing a presentation at the event and I'm going to do a talk on biology
at the event.
So if you can possibly make it, I'd love to see you guys there.
Yeah.
East Coast farmer market have been off you damn rights.
Yeah.
There's farmer markets everywhere.
I have a whole bunch in my area where I live in Alberta.
And that's it.
You go, you meet the farmer, you talk to the farmer, you know, become their friend.
You know, if you know how to grow, you'll share that knowledge with them.
It's about community.
It's about everybody.
It's funny.
I appreciate you.
Yeah.
What happens sometimes?
You're peaking.
Look like you're peaking out, man.
It's not peaking out.
It's pain out.
It is pain.
Yeah.
So because of the injuries and stuff like that, I was saying, you know, pain waves or
something like that.
It's like comes out of nowhere and nowhere.
I'd be a line.
A lot to do with spinal cord injury.
I know I have a.
I know I have a SCI.
And with that, you kind of you got to navigate through pain.
That's what it's about.
That's why I love canvas.
It's why I love the community.
That's why I love going to plant.
That was the gold side of the law.
You know, here's the whole thing.
So I'm thinking what I'm doing.
I'm outside trimming.
I'm like this.
I'm cutting, I'm cutting, I'm cutting, I'm running around.
As it looks, I'm getting a slouching.
I mean, frankly, getting plants ready because today is flipped.
It is enough.
South side things are starting to go into flower outside.
You have to start trimming your plants for your outdoor crops.
Believe me, if you do not do this right about now, you can get bigger yields.
Everything I've done enough of this in the past around my area, Pacific Northwest.
Get out there, trim up your plants, get them ready for the for August.
Somehow he's coming around the corner.
We're getting heat warnings right now.
So yeah, I don't want that oil saying why get things ready.
What I'm doing, I'm bringing a few of the plants inside because I'm going to put them in the flower today.
Vets have been vetting in four inch beds and I'm looking soils for seven days.
So another day or two, I'm going to flip them.
It's not seven to nine day badge bringing other plants.
You're just preparing for all of this for, of course, my medicine for the fall.
Yeah.
My lead for the fall and for the, for going into next year.
And I, and as you can know, I'm just finished off my last stuff right now.
Yeah.
A few drugs left and that was nine months ago.
I'm going to grow for the last nine months due to the severities of my injuries from what just happened.
Yeah.
The car accident, stuff like that changed me again.
So I changed to a mix.
I was going out of paused.
I adapted.
Yeah.
20% of the problem, 80% of the solution.
Yes.
And the farmer is the most important person in John being a farmer.
You're the most important person.
You are the farmer.
You are the grower of your life.
You are the farmer of your life.
Yeah.
And whether you're growing a plant or you're growing your awareness and your love for yourself, you know, it's the same thing.
It's all about growth and planting a plant, especially the cannabis plant gives you that, that interconnection to the world around you and to the biology that's around you.
And in that, I don't know any cannabis grower that is, is, doesn't want to give that product away.
They want to share.
And it's, it's, and then that sharing that passion for this plant is bringing us together globally.
And it's, it's about our species, you guys.
Like, it's not just.
Oh, you know what?
You know what's awesome?
My mom's growing plants.
So my mom, I went for a celebration of life.
And when I was in Nova Scotia, I got some seeds from there.
I planted those in mom's little, little place there.
And she's got three lovely ladies growing around here right now.
Mom's growing some weed.
Blessings to that too.
From Nova Scotia too.
Yeah.
Seeds, bread, and then growing bread out of love.
Yeah.
And of course I got people wanting them every day, right?
Mom's growing some weed this year because you all can grow four plants.
Blessings to all those that have went before us.
We will remember you forever and we love you forever.
Yes, we did a celebration of life for some close friends of ours at the Weeds, Glass, and Gifts little celebration of life party.
And that would have been for some dear friends of us.
Greg Williams, Randy Kane, Horatio Delbert, Jason Wilcox, Paul Hornby, Tracy Crew, of course, where she's passed some years ago.
But as we go through the things from Eastwood and then there was Cara.
These are just the seven of our close groups here in Vancouver in the last year.
Yeah.
Along with my dearest mom.
The pieces.
You know, it's really the only move forward and we have this beautiful family, which is the cannabis community.
And when you move a loved one in the cannabis community, there's thousands of others, people that hold on to him to appreciate and respect the world.
You are graced by the person who previously to us out this.
Yeah.
I know I'm bad.
I'm bad. I'm always after.
Have you done this yet, John?
I'm only here for so long.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
There's some smoke.
Yeah.
And see, this is how John deals with this pain.
He's consuming his medicine right now to put him back into that home.
No, no, he's getting high.
Okay.
So, I mean, cannabis helps us forget.
Helps us think.
Yeah.
It helps us unfocus.
It helps us focus.
So when we say it's a medicine, the homeostasis, it helps balance our system.
Yeah.
And life's about balance.
And yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is he down there?
Okay, guys.
This.
This is Mr. Morpheus.
Hi, Morpheus.
That's John's cat.
That's love, guys.
Pure, pure love.
And Morpheus loves John.
Okay.
There we go.
Check out Living Soil Conversations on the shoulders of giants.
Yeah, you guys are giants.
You guys are awesome.
Yeah.
And it's you guys that are the giants.
We're just out here.
That's what it comes down to.
And we're really going to look back at it as the future generations.
That's why I like cannabis.
The future is in your hands.
Yes.
We're only here to help facilitate what you need and what we've learned over the last
couple of decades.
And what I've learned through Prohibition, learning how to get into legalization and
understanding the movements.
Being able to keep those voices alive and keep growing forward in this industry.
So it's the community-based and it's about growth around the world.
I've said it.
I'll keep saying it.
And I'll say it once it's all said and done.
And I'll keep saying it more.
Going to Mars, baby!
Right on, Elon!
We're coming for you, brother.
Bob?
Yes.
Just go with it, especially in small pots.
Just go with a super soil, like a coot's mix.
I'm not an organic.
Still learning.
Should I start with a mega soil?
You know what?
Real easy.
I know where you are.
Follow me.
Go buy it.
It's easy.
You know why?
Because it's something I'm using.
I'm not going to recommend anything else that I don't know.
I can tell you I can recommend this product.
You can buy this right across Canada.
And I know you can.
It's going to be pretty easy.
Or you can make your own.
There's going to be other products.
But I mean, I've mixed soils like this in the past.
I'm seeing the growth right now.
Follow along.
See how the flowering goes.
And we're going to go from there.
I'm going to pull the microscope and we're going to take a better look at that.
And see what's going on with the soils.
Right, Morpheus?
And yeah, if you can and you have the availability of size, check out Shagolos' video with Leighton Morrison on horizontal soil.
Then you can do that, right?
You can totally get a big growth.
Make your own.
Go get your Pemos, go get your Plumbio, go get your Pedastics.
Go get all of these products.
Right on, Bubble.
Yep, definitely.
Omega-3, Vitamin C and turmeric.
Good natural anti-inflammatories.
I take 3,000 milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
I take Omega-3, 6, 9, and oils, of course.
Take your D3s, take K2.
For all you guys over 50, NDM Plus.
It's a cell regenerator.
It helps regenerate the cells that you will no longer generate anymore.
It makes you feel younger.
It gives you longer life.
Key, key nutrients.
Peptides.
These are all great to put in your smoothies.
Go green.
Celery juice, just started it.
I'm happy I started it.
I'm talking like a week ago, I should have started it 10 years ago.
It's a good thing to get into and look at your microgreens.
Look at feeding your own biology.
Look at that medical medium there that I'm looking at.
I'm going to follow through my Tony Robbins courses on like nostromia and health and wealth.
And wealth comes to health and that's what I'm going to be looking at.
As you can see, it's all about health.
It's all about wealth because once you get to that health, wealth in yourself,
well, then you can really start making some true wealth.
Well, yeah.
Wealth within yourself.
Wealth with your growth.
Wealth with the people around you.
Wealth with how you feel and grow.
And then there's money.
There's a different type of wealth.
And that's going to give you things that you think that you need.
But in reality, once you get the wealth that you truly have inside,
the money thing is really a big deal because it's already there.
It just piles up.
Oh, yeah.
Work on yourself.
Work harder on yourself than you do on your job.
Work harder on your growth than you do on yourself.
Honestly.
Read every day.
Read about life.
Read about growth.
I read cannabis books.
I've read a lot of them.
I'm back into reading a lot of other books on self-help.
Just helping yourself.
They can grow rich.
Yeah.
Napoleon Hill.
Message me, please.
I can give you a whole list of books that we're reading.
Today Matters by John C. Maxwell.
I wrote that.
I read that after my mom passed away.
And if you still have loving people in your life, do yourself a favor.
Today Matters by John C. Maxwell.
Because you matter.
Yes.
And today matters for every step in your life and everything that you do.
It matters to where you go, how you grow, and who you're growing with.
Stay in a higher peer group, guys.
Stay with those people you really want to be with.
The ones that empower you.
The ones that get you growing every day.
And when you get to that next level, go a little bit higher.
Because you don't want to stay at that level.
You always want to keep moving forward.
You see that with me over time on my videos.
I keep doing one of these.
Join me on the journey of life together.
We can only grow higher and more.
And for the future.
For the future of mankind.
For the future of this planet.
For the future of you.
For the future of your children.
We're growing here.
Together as one.
Because we as a community are going to take this to this next level of growth.
Yes.
Can't wait to see you at these next events, guys.
Okay, guys.
We look forward to it.
We love you all.
And we're at the hour mark.
And I want to say thank you.
Check out the Living Soil Conversations.

Putting in all the hard work.

At the gas station.
Get your voices out there.
