[00:00.380 --> 00:03.120]  Those might be my birds.
[00:03.120 --> 00:03.960]  Not mine.
[00:04.840 --> 00:07.320]  Should we just be quiet and listen to the birds?
[00:07.320 --> 00:08.800]  All right, we are live.
[00:08.800 --> 00:10.200]  Take it away, Brian.
[00:10.200 --> 00:12.600]  Yeah, happy Thursday to you Living Soil nerds.
[00:12.600 --> 00:14.880]  Just a small little IT issue,
[00:14.880 --> 00:17.920]  and of course Peter came through Hail Mary style,
[00:17.920 --> 00:19.540]  fixing things last minute,
[00:19.540 --> 00:21.500]  and then kind of working our way through
[00:21.500 --> 00:24.540]  some last minute stuff to make it work as best as we could.
[00:25.400 --> 00:29.660]  Professor Q, Mr. Quinn, I say this for a few people
[00:29.700 --> 00:30.960]  throughout this year,
[00:30.960 --> 00:32.780]  but the community is stoked
[00:32.780 --> 00:34.400]  to have you on the show today, brother.
[00:34.400 --> 00:37.960]  I've gotten a lot of DMs over the last few days,
[00:37.960 --> 00:41.280]  just excited to kind of hear and pick your brain, man.
[00:41.280 --> 00:42.900]  I know throughout the community,
[00:42.900 --> 00:46.040]  a lot of people have kind of watched your progression
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.040]  through things, like going through,
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.560]  going to different educational seminars,
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.520]  kind of also seems like behind the scenes, man,
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.080]  you're not afraid to reach out
[00:56.080 --> 00:58.820]  and kind of network with the right individuals,
[00:59.120 --> 01:00.840]  pick others' brains and stuff
[01:00.840 --> 01:04.160]  so that you start to just improve your skillset.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.400]  So that's why I reached out to you
[01:05.400 --> 01:06.320]  to have you on the show, man.
[01:06.320 --> 01:07.480]  There's so many individuals
[01:07.480 --> 01:10.520]  that want to kind of just learn from you today, man.
[01:10.520 --> 01:12.680]  So excited to kind of work with you,
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.400]  and hopefully we can talk about
[01:14.400 --> 01:15.840]  the fire swinging stuff as well,
[01:15.840 --> 01:17.860]  but I think more individuals want to kind of get into
[01:17.860 --> 01:20.400]  the natural farming Living Soil style.
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.280]  So I wanted to let Leighton have the mic for a second.
[01:24.280 --> 01:25.600]  I also wanted to thank Peter,
[01:25.600 --> 01:27.800]  and of course thank Ken behind the scenes,
[01:28.020 --> 01:29.980]  a lot of IT stuff that we have going on.
[01:29.980 --> 01:32.060]  So Ken's gonna also be helping out
[01:32.060 --> 01:33.780]  a lot more in the future.
[01:33.780 --> 01:35.900]  So thank you, Mr. Ken.
[01:35.900 --> 01:38.540]  Leighton, mic is yours, brother.
[01:38.540 --> 01:39.380]  All right, cool.
[01:39.380 --> 01:42.820]  You know, Quinn, I'm really excited to hear about your story
[01:42.820 --> 01:47.820]  and your adventure down the natural farming path.
[01:47.820 --> 01:49.500]  And I've seen you at,
[01:49.500 --> 01:51.100]  I don't know how many different events,
[01:51.100 --> 01:55.880]  Regen, I think you were at the Hive meeting with Dampure.
[01:56.860 --> 01:59.580]  So looking forward to really, you know,
[01:59.580 --> 02:01.140]  getting to know you a little bit more, my friend.
[02:01.140 --> 02:02.260]  So thanks for joining us.
[02:02.260 --> 02:03.620]  And Peter, as always, and Ken,
[02:03.620 --> 02:06.300]  thank you guys for all the work behind the scenes.
[02:06.300 --> 02:07.580]  So let's just dive right in.
[02:07.580 --> 02:11.260]  And, you know, I'd love to start with this.
[02:11.260 --> 02:15.380]  Five years ago, natural farming or Korean natural farming
[02:15.380 --> 02:18.120]  was just starting to heat up.
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.460]  People were talking about it.
[02:19.460 --> 02:21.620]  There was a lot of, you know,
[02:21.620 --> 02:23.980]  shit talking about the fact that, you know,
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.640]  it didn't work and it was causing problems in the soil.
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.560]  I didn't hear, I didn't have any bad experiences
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.200]  with the people that I had been working with
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.920]  or talking to about it.
[02:34.920 --> 02:37.880]  But tell me what your opinion was
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.080]  that when it first came out,
[02:39.080 --> 02:41.120]  were there a lot of guys or morons
[02:41.120 --> 02:42.580]  that were just using too much
[02:42.580 --> 02:44.880]  or not taking the time to make the preps correctly
[02:44.880 --> 02:47.580]  and having, you know, problems with it?
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.360]  Yeah, I think we got a really, like, scattered.
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.620]  I know I got a really scattered, like,
[02:54.620 --> 02:57.980]  kind of version of Korean natural farming at first.
[02:57.980 --> 03:00.980]  It was mainly through the Probiotic Alliance,
[03:00.980 --> 03:03.060]  like, farmer page right on Facebook.
[03:03.060 --> 03:06.720]  And a lot of people were putting labs on everything,
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.300]  which is, I mean, it's a decent strategy, honestly.
[03:09.300 --> 03:11.140]  And you, but you're kind of getting, like,
[03:11.140 --> 03:13.620]  labs over here and FPGA over there
[03:13.620 --> 03:16.180]  and maybe, like, a whisper of IMO.
[03:17.220 --> 03:19.740]  But it was, everything was really, like,
[03:19.740 --> 03:20.860]  ripped out of place.
[03:20.880 --> 03:23.600]  There was no, like, big holistic picture.
[03:24.760 --> 03:26.960]  And I ended up getting, like,
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.000]  the Master Cho book off of there.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.840]  And you could download it.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.760]  And that really was helpful for me.
[03:32.760 --> 03:34.840]  And that was around that time,
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.880]  the winter between 17 and 18, I think that was.
[03:38.880 --> 03:40.800]  So that was pretty cool.
[03:40.800 --> 03:42.800]  But yeah, it seemed like,
[03:42.800 --> 03:44.320]  I think there's a thing on the internet
[03:44.320 --> 03:46.080]  where everybody wants to convince you
[03:46.080 --> 03:47.760]  that what they're doing works.
[03:48.100 --> 03:51.700]  And sometimes it can be a little more people
[03:51.700 --> 03:55.420]  wanting to convince you that what they're doing works
[03:55.420 --> 03:57.380]  rather than trying to figure out what does work
[03:57.380 --> 03:59.060]  or what needs improvement.
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.900]  And it's really hard to sift through that stuff.
[04:00.900 --> 04:03.460]  And I got pretty just,
[04:03.460 --> 04:06.100]  I just wasn't really sure what to think of much of it.
[04:06.100 --> 04:08.260]  I started making labs and that was helpful.
[04:08.260 --> 04:11.900]  And there was so many directions to go down the rabbit hole.
[04:12.760 --> 04:14.340]  But after I read Master Cho's book,
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.540]  I kind of just put the internet aside
[04:16.560 --> 04:20.320]  and was like, I'm just gonna try to walk this path
[04:20.320 --> 04:21.240]  at least for a little bit.
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.420]  And I certainly got distracted
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.400]  and things certainly didn't go super great at first.
[04:25.400 --> 04:29.180]  But that was kind of the beginning of that for me,
[04:29.180 --> 04:30.720]  hearing a little bit about Elaine Ingham
[04:30.720 --> 04:32.760]  and a little bit about Master Cho
[04:32.760 --> 04:34.440]  and like a few of these,
[04:34.440 --> 04:36.400]  Soil Food Web, this, IMO that.
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.880]  And yeah, kind of just messing
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.600]  with the scattered fragments of information that we had.
[04:41.600 --> 04:43.300]  I mean, even Chris's videos,
[04:43.300 --> 04:45.900]  I don't even think I got into really until like 19.
[04:46.760 --> 04:48.960]  Even those, they're very sectioned.
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.080]  Like, oh, this is OHN and this is FPJ,
[04:51.080 --> 04:52.140]  but there really isn't a lot of talk
[04:52.140 --> 04:55.520]  about how to use or implement almost anything holistically,
[04:55.520 --> 04:57.180]  like as a complete system.
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.320]  So yeah, it was wild out there.
[05:00.320 --> 05:02.920]  Definitely people really hodgepodge things together
[05:02.920 --> 05:04.440]  with a lot of sub-irrigation.
[05:04.440 --> 05:07.240]  I got really into sub-irrigating stuff.
[05:07.240 --> 05:08.540]  I started my whole grow with sips.
[05:08.540 --> 05:12.400]  I had 72 sips and kind of went down that whole road
[05:12.400 --> 05:13.720]  with the earth boxes,
[05:13.740 --> 05:16.420]  which was a fun road in a lot of ways.
[05:16.420 --> 05:18.860]  It was really an uphill battle in a lot of ways.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.700]  So I feel like I learned a lot
[05:20.700 --> 05:23.440]  while maybe having mediocre success,
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.420]  but it taught me a lot.
[05:24.420 --> 05:25.960]  So I hope that helps.
[05:27.700 --> 05:30.620]  Yeah, and I think putting in the time and effort, Quinn,
[05:30.620 --> 05:32.900]  is where a lot of people,
[05:32.900 --> 05:34.540]  they say they're gonna do these certain things.
[05:34.540 --> 05:36.300]  They say they're gonna go to the advance
[05:36.300 --> 05:38.580]  or maybe you watch videos.
[05:38.580 --> 05:40.100]  Time does kind of go by.
[05:41.220 --> 05:43.620]  I feel like, sir, in just a few years,
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.440]  you've really kind of just put your name out there
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.560]  for somebody that I feel like the community looks to
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.000]  as like, wow, man, if Quinn's doing this
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.040]  and maybe other individuals,
[05:55.040 --> 05:57.160]  I know you got a shout out from Mr. Steensland.
[05:57.160 --> 05:58.920]  To me, he's one of the dudes
[05:58.920 --> 06:01.320]  that I've personally always looked up to.
[06:01.320 --> 06:05.800]  So to have him starting to represent individuals,
[06:05.800 --> 06:07.440]  like when he first came to my talk, man,
[06:07.440 --> 06:09.680]  I just felt like a certain way about things.
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.240]  It's like, man, that guy should be up here.
[06:12.060 --> 06:13.660]  You almost feel like that shouldn't be.
[06:13.660 --> 06:15.300]  But when you're starting to educate,
[06:15.300 --> 06:17.020]  you start to see that it doesn't really matter, man.
[06:17.020 --> 06:20.340]  Everybody has a unique approach.
[06:20.340 --> 06:22.740]  And so what a lot of individuals wanted to ask me
[06:22.740 --> 06:26.220]  to start kicking this off is more of your IMO approach.
[06:26.220 --> 06:28.660]  The community is starting to do that more and more
[06:28.660 --> 06:31.100]  as a group.
[06:31.100 --> 06:34.380]  Latent, when I had a reptile show this past Sunday,
[06:34.380 --> 06:36.820]  I had an individual named Ryan come up and give me some,
[06:36.820 --> 06:38.220]  actually, I still have it,
[06:38.220 --> 06:40.220]  gave me some IMOs that he's starting to make
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.720]  because of our shows.
[06:41.720 --> 06:43.600]  So I just kind of wanted to pick your brain
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.560]  to start off with that
[06:44.560 --> 06:47.400]  because so many people have had struggles
[06:47.400 --> 06:50.960]  and that can be a kind of a disheartening thing
[06:50.960 --> 06:52.200]  when you're first getting into this
[06:52.200 --> 06:54.280]  is to maybe make a few labs,
[06:54.280 --> 06:56.360]  decent labs when you're first getting into it,
[06:56.360 --> 06:58.720]  go out there, you're so excited with IMOs
[06:58.720 --> 07:02.400]  and maybe you get one successful box out of 10.
[07:02.400 --> 07:04.040]  Just seems like a lot of work,
[07:04.040 --> 07:05.360]  especially if you're newer to this.
[07:05.360 --> 07:08.000]  So appreciate any insights that you could also
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  kind of help the community
[07:09.500 --> 07:12.140]  just really understanding success with IMOs.
[07:13.380 --> 07:15.920]  Yeah, I feel like,
[07:17.380 --> 07:19.940]  I guess like a mantra that I always have on the farm
[07:19.940 --> 07:22.380]  is like right now is the worst you're ever gonna be
[07:22.380 --> 07:23.660]  at whatever you're doing.
[07:23.660 --> 07:27.540]  Whether it's making potatoes or it's making compost,
[07:27.540 --> 07:28.940]  this is the worst you're gonna be.
[07:28.940 --> 07:31.380]  So hurry up and mess it up.
[07:31.380 --> 07:34.740]  Like just get the mess up under your belt,
[07:34.740 --> 07:37.580]  get it out of the way and get over it and learn.
[07:37.580 --> 07:42.120]  So it's your first one is gonna be the worst one.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.420]  It might still be okay,
[07:43.420 --> 07:46.200]  but you're probably gonna just get better after that.
[07:46.200 --> 07:48.840]  So I think it's a lot of people think
[07:48.840 --> 07:51.160]  they're gonna figure something out where they're first,
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.980]  they're gonna just avoid all of that.
[07:52.980 --> 07:55.120]  And they're just gonna have their first one be perfect.
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.560]  And sometimes you get beginner's luck
[07:56.560 --> 07:58.480]  and you do have a good first one,
[07:58.480 --> 07:59.900]  but it's pretty unlikely
[07:59.900 --> 08:02.840]  and it's better to just get that experience under your belt.
[08:02.840 --> 08:04.280]  I really think.
[08:04.300 --> 08:07.740]  So yeah, so that's kind of like philosophically,
[08:07.740 --> 08:09.620]  I guess that's like my point of view.
[08:10.540 --> 08:13.820]  As far as like actual technical strategies and stuff go,
[08:13.820 --> 08:15.940]  don't change a lot of things.
[08:15.940 --> 08:18.500]  It's really a ton of variables.
[08:18.500 --> 08:22.060]  Like the more you learn and see it,
[08:22.060 --> 08:24.940]  the more you realize how many variables are at play
[08:24.940 --> 08:27.640]  on every given IMO box in every season,
[08:27.640 --> 08:29.460]  with every humidity, with every grain,
[08:29.460 --> 08:32.660]  with the depth of the space of rice to head space
[08:32.840 --> 08:35.240]  and the moisture outside and the aeration in the wood
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.160]  and placement.
[08:36.160 --> 08:38.600]  I mean, there's tons and tons of variables.
[08:38.600 --> 08:39.840]  Don't be thinking like,
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.440]  oh, I'm gonna use Amaranth instead of rice right away.
[08:43.440 --> 08:47.120]  Like really, I don't recommend trying to adjust
[08:48.040 --> 08:51.160]  a system that you don't successfully operate yet.
[08:53.240 --> 08:55.480]  It's a longer road to success.
[08:55.480 --> 08:57.620]  And I wanna see people have success faster.
[08:57.620 --> 09:01.440]  And these systems have been in place for decades
[09:01.820 --> 09:03.740]  and they're always improving and they're changing.
[09:03.740 --> 09:06.380]  But if you have success with the system the way it is,
[09:06.380 --> 09:07.440]  you'll be able to come to the table
[09:07.440 --> 09:10.180]  and help everyone find new solutions.
[09:10.180 --> 09:14.240]  Try not to make stuff up or hypothesize
[09:14.240 --> 09:16.540]  that you figured it out in three months
[09:16.540 --> 09:19.660]  what Master Cho didn't see in 80 years.
[09:19.660 --> 09:23.220]  Like it's pretty unlikely that you just like stumbled on
[09:23.220 --> 09:26.180]  to the new IMO.
[09:26.180 --> 09:28.420]  So, with that said, lots of boxes,
[09:28.420 --> 09:29.500]  like it's a numbers game.
[09:29.520 --> 09:31.560]  I started using one to two boxes.
[09:31.560 --> 09:34.280]  And as soon as I went back for my Soilsmith class
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.560]  in like 2020, it really hit me like,
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.400]  this is a numbers game, like put out more boxes
[09:42.360 --> 09:44.280]  because then you can throw out boxes.
[09:44.280 --> 09:46.280]  Like I can put out seven boxes and say,
[09:46.280 --> 09:48.160]  these three boxes aren't any good.
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.440]  And I still have four great collections left.
[09:50.440 --> 09:54.600]  So, I highly recommend treating it like a numbers game.
[09:54.600 --> 09:56.520]  That can be really helpful.
[09:56.520 --> 09:59.040]  And find some of those linear variables.
[09:59.540 --> 10:00.860]  Like you have dry rice to wet rice
[10:00.860 --> 10:02.500]  and you have everything in between.
[10:02.500 --> 10:07.380]  Maybe your first time you put out different amounts of rice,
[10:07.380 --> 10:10.660]  undercooked, regular, overcooked.
[10:10.660 --> 10:13.220]  You really wanna go for partially undercooked
[10:13.220 --> 10:15.780]  and then branch off of that maybe a little bit
[10:15.780 --> 10:17.180]  one way and the other way.
[10:18.220 --> 10:19.340]  Another thing is time.
[10:19.340 --> 10:21.420]  You can put stuff out for different times.
[10:21.420 --> 10:23.700]  I'm in a really cold climate up in Maine.
[10:23.700 --> 10:26.060]  So, something that I do for that,
[10:26.060 --> 10:27.460]  a lot of people are like, oh, try four days
[10:27.460 --> 10:28.580]  then try five days.
[10:29.080 --> 10:30.880]  I had to put collections out for two weeks sometimes
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.840]  because it's really cold up here.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.360]  It'll be 40 degrees at night
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.880]  and microbes don't really grow at 40 degrees.
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.020]  I'll put out a box that's just like the check on box.
[10:41.020 --> 10:44.080]  So, I have a box that maybe I don't keep the collection.
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.280]  Maybe I do, but what I will do is I'll use that box
[10:48.280 --> 10:50.940]  to gauge the timeframe for all the other boxes
[10:50.940 --> 10:53.680]  because shooting in the dark with these colder climates
[10:53.680 --> 10:55.400]  is really hard.
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.840]  So, that's something you can do to set yourself up
[10:57.860 --> 11:02.300]  a little fail safe because then you can look at that box
[11:02.300 --> 11:03.980]  and use that as a gauge.
[11:03.980 --> 11:07.100]  So, yeah, that's something that I do that really helps me.
[11:07.100 --> 11:08.380]  There's a lot of colder climate,
[11:08.380 --> 11:11.460]  like things that I've had to adapt and adjust.
[11:11.460 --> 11:13.300]  After I met Layton and he was like,
[11:13.300 --> 11:15.280]  put compost tea on everything.
[11:17.300 --> 11:22.300]  I took what he said to heart and Chris and Steve Reisner
[11:23.900 --> 11:26.800]  and Elaine Ingham, they were all just spewing
[11:26.800 --> 11:27.700]  all this information.
[11:28.560 --> 11:30.360]  I immediately went home just like saying biology
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.400]  over and over again in my head, like I need biology.
[11:33.400 --> 11:35.880]  And I went into the woods and like three feet of snow
[11:35.880 --> 11:38.680]  and ripped bark off of trees that have mycelium
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.320]  growing on it and did like an indoor collection
[11:41.320 --> 11:43.880]  with that in the middle of the winter,
[11:43.880 --> 11:46.240]  like negative 15 degrees out.
[11:46.240 --> 11:49.840]  So, you can always figure out a way to make it work
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.240]  with what you have, but don't assume that it's better.
[11:52.240 --> 11:54.780]  Like, it's not like that collection I did was better
[11:54.780 --> 11:56.320]  than a correctly done collection.
[11:56.340 --> 11:58.900]  So, start with what's simple and what works
[11:58.900 --> 12:02.300]  and get as close to the regular system as you can.
[12:02.300 --> 12:04.540]  And then you can work backwards to what you can do
[12:04.540 --> 12:06.500]  and what you're able to do and what you have available
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.900]  and what you need to do.
[12:08.900 --> 12:10.700]  Because we're not saying don't do things,
[12:10.700 --> 12:12.900]  but if you can do it the simple proven way,
[12:12.900 --> 12:16.260]  like start there, it's gonna make your time easier.
[12:16.260 --> 12:18.980]  So, that's like a little, I am a one,
[12:18.980 --> 12:22.100]  few tricks and tips and we can do twos and threes
[12:22.100 --> 12:23.460]  and keep going if we want.
[12:24.440 --> 12:25.840]  Well, while we're here,
[12:25.840 --> 12:28.360]  so when it comes to like box selection,
[12:28.360 --> 12:30.160]  have you tried messing around with more
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.440]  of like the leaf boxes or are you like a cedar individual?
[12:34.440 --> 12:36.840]  You like to kind of build that out, drill the holes?
[12:36.840 --> 12:38.540]  Yeah, I got a box right over here.
[12:40.160 --> 12:42.200]  Man, those were some bull bars guys.
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.080]  I hope they were paying attention about variables
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.280]  and rise, variable and depths, using that indicator box.
[12:50.280 --> 12:52.880]  That was fucking genius, dude.
[12:52.900 --> 12:54.020]  Sorry.
[12:54.020 --> 12:55.740]  Thanks man, I appreciate that Leighton.
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.700]  And it's a lot of it's inspired from a lot of tenacity
[12:58.700 --> 13:01.900]  that you showed at the conference of just,
[13:01.900 --> 13:03.220]  make it work, pay attention,
[13:03.220 --> 13:05.060]  like adjust what you got to adjust,
[13:05.060 --> 13:06.740]  but there's already systems in place that work
[13:06.740 --> 13:08.140]  and start there.
[13:09.060 --> 13:10.860]  So, this is all cedar.
[13:10.860 --> 13:13.460]  So, these are cedar deck boards.
[13:13.460 --> 13:15.980]  So, basically if you go and get a cedar deck board,
[13:15.980 --> 13:18.340]  it'll look like this, but it'll be eight feet long.
[13:18.340 --> 13:19.660]  You buy one of those.
[13:19.660 --> 13:23.160]  So, this piece of wood, this piece of wood
[13:23.160 --> 13:25.620]  and this piece of wood are all the exact same length.
[13:25.620 --> 13:28.480]  So, you're just cutting three pieces at that length
[13:28.480 --> 13:31.400]  and then two pieces at this length for both ends.
[13:31.400 --> 13:34.160]  So, you can sit there with three cedar decking boards
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.120]  and just do, you can just make 12 of one
[13:37.120 --> 13:38.160]  and eight of the other, right?
[13:38.160 --> 13:39.760]  Or whatever the ratio is, you know,
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.280]  and you can make a lot really fast and cut them all,
[13:43.280 --> 13:44.300]  be super efficient.
[13:44.300 --> 13:46.520]  I was a carpenter for years and a Mason
[13:46.520 --> 13:47.520]  and hardwood flooring.
[13:47.540 --> 13:50.500]  So, building and stuff is something that I like to do.
[13:50.500 --> 13:53.580]  And this is a really fun project
[13:53.580 --> 13:54.820]  because nobody gets to look at it.
[13:54.820 --> 13:57.740]  It's not finished carpentry, it's for microbes.
[13:57.740 --> 14:01.300]  I like to leave this like kind of slack here, you know,
[14:01.300 --> 14:03.580]  that little space there on both sides.
[14:03.580 --> 14:05.460]  I think it's a nice way to get airflow
[14:05.460 --> 14:07.060]  and then lots of holes, you know,
[14:07.060 --> 14:09.180]  and I probably need to add more holes to these.
[14:09.180 --> 14:12.140]  I was like hesitant at first,
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.860]  but you can even, if you want to get really fancy,
[14:13.860 --> 14:17.140]  you can do slats, like so sliver cut these,
[14:17.720 --> 14:18.840]  but table saws are, you know, they're tricky.
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.720]  So, but you could do smaller pieces on the bottom board
[14:21.720 --> 14:23.640]  and open it up and make it slatted like that,
[14:23.640 --> 14:25.240]  like kind of a laugh style.
[14:26.120 --> 14:27.200]  But these are awesome.
[14:27.200 --> 14:28.320]  They're simple, they're small.
[14:28.320 --> 14:30.360]  As you can see, it's not that big of a piece of wood.
[14:30.360 --> 14:31.960]  Like I think it's an eight by 11.
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.640]  And I have a little, I have a few posts on this
[14:34.640 --> 14:37.120]  on my Instagram, if you scroll down far enough,
[14:37.120 --> 14:38.920]  that shows like me screwing it together
[14:38.920 --> 14:40.720]  and all that kind of stuff.
[14:40.720 --> 14:42.320]  But yeah, I really like these cedar boxes.
[14:42.320 --> 14:45.160]  I started with pine boxes and when the IMOs paid for me
[14:45.180 --> 14:47.180]  to buy nicer boxes, then I did and I made them.
[14:47.180 --> 14:49.460]  So, you know, start with, start simple.
[14:49.460 --> 14:52.140]  And when the, you know, when everything,
[14:52.140 --> 14:54.340]  when the KNF pays for you to get nicer stuff,
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.220]  then do it, you know?
[14:55.220 --> 14:58.740]  So don't feel like you gotta have the fanciest box to start.
[14:58.740 --> 15:01.020]  The microbes don't really care how fancy your box is.
[15:01.020 --> 15:02.260]  You know?
[15:02.260 --> 15:04.180]  Well, and the slats that you have,
[15:04.180 --> 15:06.160]  like normally it does go across,
[15:06.160 --> 15:08.860]  there's spacing in between all of that main area.
[15:08.860 --> 15:09.940]  But since it heats up,
[15:09.940 --> 15:12.020]  I thought maybe you're onto something there
[15:12.040 --> 15:15.400]  by having it more of a thicker piece in the middle,
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.020]  because it did seem like when some individuals
[15:18.020 --> 15:20.080]  would build their boxes, they would have issues.
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.240]  And maybe that was because there was too many slats,
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.340]  maybe even too many holes.
[15:24.340 --> 15:26.380]  So maybe less is more with some of this stuff,
[15:26.380 --> 15:29.960]  because your box looks pretty dialed in, man.
[15:29.960 --> 15:32.820]  Because obviously there's a ton of variety of ways
[15:32.820 --> 15:34.280]  that you can do it.
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.240]  But usually I see like bigger holes
[15:37.240 --> 15:40.800]  and some of those individuals will have problems.
[15:40.820 --> 15:42.660]  So again, that would probably troubleshoot.
[15:42.660 --> 15:44.620]  But if that's tried and true, man,
[15:44.620 --> 15:46.640]  and you're going out there and hitting home runs
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.300]  with these IMO collections,
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.060]  then yeah, I wouldn't try to reinvent the wheel.
[15:52.060 --> 15:55.460]  Just start off with maybe pine boxes, like you mentioned,
[15:55.460 --> 15:56.620]  cheaper way to do it.
[15:56.620 --> 15:59.220]  Copy that style, make some money for yourself,
[15:59.220 --> 16:03.180]  and then obviously improve your skill sets and your tools.
[16:03.180 --> 16:05.980]  You know, guys, when I first did the IMO collection
[16:05.980 --> 16:09.980]  out here, I did it in, I believe it or not, cardboard boxes.
[16:09.980 --> 16:11.340]  And it worked fantastic.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.680]  And then I just took the cardboard
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.400]  and threw it right into my compost pile when I was done.
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.680]  So it's a disposable, reusable functioning component
[16:19.680 --> 16:22.720]  that you can compost and add the organisms
[16:22.720 --> 16:27.620]  right into your cured or semi-cured compost.
[16:27.620 --> 16:30.800]  So there's another trick that if you don't have money,
[16:30.800 --> 16:32.600]  I'm sure you can get some cardboard.
[16:34.840 --> 16:36.680]  And what do you think about,
[16:37.020 --> 16:40.500]  have you messed around with any of the leaf IMO type boxes?
[16:42.500 --> 16:45.140]  I'm not exactly sure what you, I guess I haven't seen that.
[16:45.140 --> 16:47.340]  What exactly, I've done, like,
[16:47.340 --> 16:49.540]  I've seen a lot of basket style ones
[16:49.540 --> 16:50.460]  that I think are cool.
[16:50.460 --> 16:51.300]  What do you mean by leaf?
[16:51.300 --> 16:52.940]  I guess that's what I'm saying, yeah.
[16:52.940 --> 16:54.020]  I might be saying the same thing.
[16:54.020 --> 16:56.300]  Like in a basket weed style.
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:57.540 --> 16:58.460]  So the basket stuff,
[16:58.460 --> 17:00.060]  I think that's actually more traditional
[17:00.060 --> 17:01.300]  is the basket stuff.
[17:01.300 --> 17:02.460]  The nice part about the cedar,
[17:02.460 --> 17:03.900]  I mean, like cardboard is perfect.
[17:03.900 --> 17:05.340]  Like all that stuff is, you know,
[17:05.340 --> 17:08.560]  whatever works, it's really more about conditions
[17:08.560 --> 17:10.260]  and less about the container.
[17:10.260 --> 17:11.480]  But the nice thing is a lot,
[17:11.480 --> 17:14.700]  I mean, if you have squirrels or rabbits or, you know,
[17:14.700 --> 17:15.960]  bears you lose, right?
[17:15.960 --> 17:17.940]  But these raccoons and some of this stuff,
[17:17.940 --> 17:20.320]  like you do wanna kind of build a,
[17:20.320 --> 17:21.680]  like if you can barricade it,
[17:21.680 --> 17:22.920]  you might have better success.
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.600]  You can certainly get away with a lot of things,
[17:24.600 --> 17:26.740]  but you put out a bunch of rice boxes,
[17:26.740 --> 17:28.320]  a lot of times animals, they notice.
[17:28.320 --> 17:30.800]  So being able to put that hardware cloth on the top
[17:30.800 --> 17:32.440]  and know like, like I've come back
[17:32.440 --> 17:34.920]  and seen boxes like thrown into new locations,
[17:35.460 --> 17:37.580]  but they still couldn't get into the rice.
[17:37.580 --> 17:39.500]  So sometimes it's like a, it's a, you know,
[17:39.500 --> 17:41.600]  you're battling different elements
[17:41.600 --> 17:43.260]  and sometimes those elements are animals
[17:43.260 --> 17:44.220]  that wanna eat your rice.
[17:44.220 --> 17:46.980]  So, you know, but you can get away with so many things
[17:46.980 --> 17:49.220]  and you should always try some different stuff.
[17:49.220 --> 17:52.500]  But yeah, like baskets, baskets are cool.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.620]  Yeah.
[17:53.620 --> 17:55.900]  And in all honesty, I did lose two,
[17:55.900 --> 17:58.660]  two out of the eight boxes I put out due to that.
[17:58.660 --> 18:00.300]  They got in there and chewed a hole in it.
[18:00.300 --> 18:02.460]  So I'm eerie on that one.
[18:02.460 --> 18:04.380]  Stronger, probably better.
[18:04.380 --> 18:05.440]  It's a numbers game.
[18:05.440 --> 18:07.040]  And I mean, that's, you still won.
[18:07.040 --> 18:09.320]  Like, I mean, you got six good collections,
[18:09.320 --> 18:10.640]  like that's all you need.
[18:10.640 --> 18:12.440]  Like that's, that's a huge win.
[18:12.440 --> 18:13.840]  And the time you save in the cardboard,
[18:13.840 --> 18:16.560]  if it means you can cook more rice, then maybe do that.
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.000]  Like maybe putting more, putting more numbers out
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.440]  is better than spending your time
[18:20.440 --> 18:22.400]  and your money on the boxes, you know.
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.000]  I think that's a great way of putting it.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.720]  It's, it is a numbers game.
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.080]  And so the diversity you get
[18:29.080 --> 18:31.920]  because you have such a bigger option
[18:32.140 --> 18:34.500]  of different choices and locations,
[18:34.500 --> 18:35.620]  you're going to be better off.
[18:35.620 --> 18:38.780]  So, you know, again, great, great way to look at it.
[18:39.860 --> 18:41.360]  You know, it's a numbers game.
[18:43.540 --> 18:46.780]  For your substrate choice,
[18:46.780 --> 18:48.100]  has, is it always rice?
[18:48.100 --> 18:49.580]  You're always rocking rice?
[18:49.580 --> 18:51.340]  Or have you experimented with something
[18:51.340 --> 18:54.540]  so that maybe for the more advanced viewers today,
[18:54.540 --> 18:57.220]  they could play around with some stuff?
[18:57.220 --> 18:59.580]  Yeah, I'm always rice.
[18:59.580 --> 19:01.900]  I am, like you said earlier, if you're hitting home runs,
[19:02.740 --> 19:03.580]  I don't think I'm hitting home runs.
[19:03.580 --> 19:04.520]  I think I'm getting base hits.
[19:04.520 --> 19:07.480]  Like I'm just trying to get men on the base, you know,
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.980]  and just keep men on the base and keep it moving through
[19:09.980 --> 19:11.320]  and trying to not strike out.
[19:11.320 --> 19:13.680]  I'm, you know, I get some white collections,
[19:13.680 --> 19:15.740]  a lot of collections that are more than 50% white,
[19:15.740 --> 19:18.280]  but I'm not having these huge two inch white,
[19:18.280 --> 19:19.660]  fluffy Hawaii blooms.
[19:19.660 --> 19:22.760]  It's just not what I'm getting in my region.
[19:22.760 --> 19:24.880]  So I just want to keep dialing in.
[19:24.880 --> 19:26.640]  I don't want to start changing variables now.
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.080]  I want to improve success
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.460]  with the variables I currently have.
[19:30.460 --> 19:33.220]  That said, I am probably going to do one or two collections
[19:33.220 --> 19:37.040]  with maybe 20% frass, try to do some of that IPMO
[19:37.040 --> 19:39.480]  and store those separately and label them separately
[19:39.480 --> 19:42.440]  and use them in a separate IMO three and IMO four.
[19:42.440 --> 19:44.440]  I'm not going to incorporate them directly
[19:44.440 --> 19:46.360]  into my regular IMO four,
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.820]  but I am probably going to put out at least one box
[19:48.820 --> 19:51.680]  or two boxes, you know, a season like that
[19:51.680 --> 19:53.720]  out of kind of my seven or eight boxes.
[19:54.660 --> 19:58.260]  So that's, as far as deviance and variations go,
[19:58.260 --> 20:01.240]  I'm going to go for that before I start messing
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.080]  with the rice.
[20:02.080 --> 20:04.560]  Cal rose rice is what's recommended.
[20:04.560 --> 20:09.560]  A short grain white rice is the most available food source.
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.800]  So to help people understand,
[20:11.800 --> 20:13.760]  it's a mechanical thing with this.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.680]  So when you talk about like a basmati,
[20:15.680 --> 20:17.200]  you have a long grain.
[20:17.200 --> 20:19.280]  When you talk about a Cal rose or like a sushi rice,
[20:19.280 --> 20:20.440]  you have a shorter grain.
[20:20.440 --> 20:22.960]  So the inside is really hard and uncooked
[20:22.960 --> 20:25.240]  and you get layers of differentiating,
[20:25.240 --> 20:27.220]  differentiating like cook levels.
[20:27.220 --> 20:29.760]  So the rice on the outside is really soft.
[20:29.760 --> 20:31.680]  Then you kind of have a medium normal, you know,
[20:31.680 --> 20:33.440]  and then on the inside, it's really undercooked.
[20:33.440 --> 20:35.360]  So you're getting these varying levels of starch
[20:35.360 --> 20:37.160]  and starch digestibility.
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.160]  And I think it's important to understand
[20:39.160 --> 20:40.600]  that that's like a mechanical thing.
[20:40.600 --> 20:41.520]  It's not necessarily like,
[20:41.520 --> 20:44.280]  oh, this rice has more nutrients or like any of that.
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.380]  White rice is a little easier for them to digest,
[20:47.380 --> 20:49.200]  but I have heard tons of people have success
[20:49.200 --> 20:50.240]  with brown rice.
[20:50.240 --> 20:52.440]  So, you know, if you want to have fun, that's cool.
[20:52.440 --> 20:54.100]  If you want to run a farm,
[20:54.100 --> 20:56.880]  I suggest like starting with what we know works
[20:57.540 --> 21:00.240]  the most repeatedly and trying to repeat it.
[21:01.620 --> 21:02.460]  Yeah.
[21:04.660 --> 21:07.140]  Yeah, the Cal rose short grain white rice,
[21:07.140 --> 21:10.040]  it's a little easier for them to digest than brown rice.
[21:10.980 --> 21:13.940]  Yeah, yeah, I think that's a covers that issue.
[21:13.940 --> 21:16.300]  And when it comes to the frass that you had mentioned,
[21:16.300 --> 21:19.540]  are you using like different varieties with that?
[21:19.540 --> 21:22.460]  Are you sticking with like black soldier fly larvae?
[21:22.460 --> 21:24.540]  Cause I'm playing around with frasses right now.
[21:24.800 --> 21:29.800]  I would think that you would be more knowledgeable
[21:30.800 --> 21:31.800]  on that than I would.
[21:32.800 --> 21:36.200]  I still, so that's like Steve Reisner's thing.
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.320]  Him and Chris did a lot of ping pong balling back and forth
[21:39.320 --> 21:41.200]  to develop some systems.
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.960]  And it seems like Steve has really pushed the envelope
[21:43.960 --> 21:46.600]  on those and kind of, it's been really cool to see them
[21:46.600 --> 21:49.760]  like those levels of brains working together
[21:49.760 --> 21:51.560]  to like push this stuff forward
[21:51.560 --> 21:54.160]  just in like a cooperative collective way.
[21:54.740 --> 21:57.540]  And I need to check in more with Steve as to like,
[21:57.540 --> 21:59.940]  if he has a variety of rice, how long he's cooking the rice,
[21:59.940 --> 22:02.780]  is he cooking the rice and the frass together?
[22:02.780 --> 22:04.260]  So I'm gonna touch base with him
[22:04.260 --> 22:06.180]  and maybe get a few more pointers.
[22:06.180 --> 22:07.180]  He's a friend of mine.
[22:07.180 --> 22:09.420]  He's insanely knowledgeable.
[22:09.420 --> 22:11.500]  I have so much respect for that guy.
[22:11.500 --> 22:13.300]  But yeah, he's really pretty far down
[22:13.300 --> 22:14.380]  the rabbit hole on that.
[22:14.380 --> 22:16.140]  And if he tells you to do something,
[22:16.140 --> 22:18.120]  it's probably for a good reason.
[22:18.120 --> 22:21.660]  I would love to hear you, Steve and Brian,
[22:22.200 --> 22:25.080]  like link up because you have such a good base
[22:25.080 --> 22:28.880]  of insect understanding that I think
[22:28.880 --> 22:30.280]  if he gave you the knowledge,
[22:30.280 --> 22:33.120]  you might be able to help everyone receive it better.
[22:33.120 --> 22:35.600]  Where if I get it, I might lose some of the,
[22:35.600 --> 22:37.640]  I don't really understand frass that well
[22:37.640 --> 22:40.440]  and the chitin and all that stuff's a little outside
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.300]  of my specialty.
[22:42.300 --> 22:45.960]  So maybe me and you and him can all get it in terms
[22:45.960 --> 22:47.400]  that can help everybody.
[22:47.400 --> 22:49.560]  I don't know, just spit balling.
[22:49.560 --> 22:50.400]  So.
[22:51.580 --> 22:52.420]  Yeah.
[22:53.940 --> 22:55.340]  Yeah, that would be interesting.
[22:55.340 --> 22:56.900]  I'll leave it at that.
[22:56.900 --> 22:59.020]  Chitin and stuff like that is,
[23:00.100 --> 23:02.740]  I'm starting to see really important for Soil Food Web,
[23:02.740 --> 23:06.540]  like just overall thriving.
[23:06.540 --> 23:08.980]  And so when you're mixing a different thing,
[23:08.980 --> 23:11.580]  sometimes at the beginning I was using crickets,
[23:11.580 --> 23:13.820]  but those really stink, man.
[23:13.820 --> 23:15.700]  I mean, there's a lot to that.
[23:15.700 --> 23:18.500]  And there's dubia roaches that you can use.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.960]  And then of course, coming down more,
[23:20.960 --> 23:23.320]  I feel like the high end version
[23:23.320 --> 23:26.120]  is the black soldier fly larvae.
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.200]  And to answer that question, yes, chitin is where it's at.
[23:29.200 --> 23:32.760]  Whether you're trying to build up the plant's immune system
[23:32.760 --> 23:35.000]  or build up that actual soil life.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.280]  It seems like springtails,
[23:36.280 --> 23:40.280]  if you mix frass with crab meal and shrimp meal,
[23:40.280 --> 23:44.040]  kind of add a lot of the more like crustacean type foods,
[23:44.040 --> 23:46.960]  the Soil Food Web just kind of takes off.
[23:47.460 --> 23:49.140]  And that's why I thought it was interesting
[23:49.140 --> 23:51.660]  that you had mentioned there's all these different pieces.
[23:51.660 --> 23:53.420]  We've talked about that many times on the show.
[23:53.420 --> 23:55.580]  That's kind of the point of going out
[23:55.580 --> 23:57.420]  or a way to do shows like this.
[23:57.420 --> 23:59.880]  Is so that you can hear it from individuals like yourself
[23:59.880 --> 24:01.460]  and each and every week,
[24:03.260 --> 24:04.580]  kind of saying the same stuff.
[24:04.580 --> 24:06.700]  Like it's all about building up your soil system.
[24:06.700 --> 24:09.740]  It's all about getting the diversity in there.
[24:09.740 --> 24:11.580]  Where back in the day,
[24:11.580 --> 24:13.860]  like Leighton kind of was alluding to,
[24:13.860 --> 24:15.220]  there was just so much out there
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.680]  that people probably, our little network including,
[24:19.680 --> 24:21.400]  we were trying to use Fox Farm
[24:21.400 --> 24:23.720]  and rebuild those kinds of soil systems
[24:23.720 --> 24:26.720]  and without adding the microbial life.
[24:26.720 --> 24:29.840]  So there's just so much information out there,
[24:29.840 --> 24:33.880]  but it was just, it was too watered down at the beginning.
[24:33.880 --> 24:35.980]  So I feel like that's where a lot of the mistakes
[24:35.980 --> 24:36.820]  came from.
[24:36.820 --> 24:38.960]  So putting time and effort, watching these shows,
[24:38.960 --> 24:40.200]  doing a little experiments,
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.580]  getting your mistakes out of the way,
[24:41.580 --> 24:44.600]  like Quinn was talking about at the beginning of the show.
[24:44.940 --> 24:46.820]  And you're gonna be miles ahead of Quinn
[24:46.820 --> 24:49.020]  and other individuals that have been rocking this stuff
[24:49.020 --> 24:51.300]  for years now on your own journey,
[24:51.300 --> 24:53.980]  because you're gonna have just so much more information
[24:53.980 --> 24:55.660]  and correct information,
[24:55.660 --> 24:58.620]  or at least information that's constantly improving
[24:58.620 --> 25:01.580]  than just watching forums, looking at people's photos.
[25:01.580 --> 25:02.780]  Of course, they're only showing you
[25:02.780 --> 25:05.020]  the best corner of the room back then.
[25:05.020 --> 25:09.140]  There's just easier ways not to show the full gamut
[25:09.140 --> 25:10.820]  of what's going on.
[25:10.820 --> 25:13.340]  Now with social media, everybody's showing their videos
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.200]  and showing how clean the room is.
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.320]  And again, that's a test to understanding mother nature
[25:19.320 --> 25:20.640]  better as a community.
[25:24.280 --> 25:25.780]  Well said, Brian, well said.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.960]  And as I always say, it's all about the biology, guys.
[25:30.960 --> 25:33.300]  Remember, it's all about the biology.
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.240]  Hey, don't forget the sand, silk, clay,
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.080]  organic matter, my friend, and a little chemistry.
[25:40.960 --> 25:43.640]  Oh yeah, but if you have the biology,
[25:43.660 --> 25:45.940]  it's not gonna be able to pull anything out of the sand,
[25:45.940 --> 25:47.100]  silk, and clay latent.
[25:47.100 --> 25:50.140]  So without the biology, it doesn't matter.
[25:50.140 --> 25:51.900]  Amen, amen.
[25:52.740 --> 25:54.340]  Preaching to the choir, brother.
[25:55.260 --> 25:56.980]  Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah.
[25:56.980 --> 26:01.300]  I've been known to yell biology at my friends pretty often.
[26:03.580 --> 26:06.780]  Everyone wants to figure out the perfect chemistry,
[26:06.780 --> 26:08.600]  and it's just, I'm not interested.
[26:08.600 --> 26:10.580]  I mean, it's important, don't get me wrong,
[26:10.580 --> 26:12.860]  but it's not my personal focus.
[26:12.880 --> 26:14.120]  It's not the journey I'm out on.
[26:14.120 --> 26:17.400]  I'm like, I'm trying to make the biology just free
[26:17.400 --> 26:19.120]  to do whatever it wants to do,
[26:19.120 --> 26:22.300]  and I'm happy to just hold on for the ride, more or less.
[26:23.520 --> 26:26.200]  Yeah, managing the systems instead of the system
[26:26.200 --> 26:29.040]  being so dependent on you is really the difference,
[26:29.040 --> 26:32.600]  and it gives you back your livelihood and family time
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.720]  and enjoying yourself.
[26:34.720 --> 26:37.640]  There's just so many benefits to learning this skillset,
[26:37.640 --> 26:38.960]  especially at a younger age,
[26:38.960 --> 26:40.420]  where you can just really take off
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.120]  and have a decade or two to really understand soil.
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.040]  Man, I'm gonna admire those individuals as the time go by
[26:48.040 --> 26:50.760]  that are gonna be able to do A to Z and learn those things
[26:50.760 --> 26:52.840]  and be able to not only farm their own medicine,
[26:52.840 --> 26:54.720]  make their own concentrates,
[26:54.720 --> 26:55.860]  but take care of their family
[26:55.860 --> 26:58.140]  with a little extra money in their pocket.
[26:58.140 --> 27:00.840]  Before we move on to kind of leveling up,
[27:00.840 --> 27:03.280]  so we're still on IMO1.
[27:03.280 --> 27:05.920]  We put out a lot of our collections.
[27:05.920 --> 27:08.240]  There's different views on this.
[27:09.220 --> 27:13.780]  How's your view when you see a rainbow collection,
[27:13.780 --> 27:15.060]  a rainbow bloom?
[27:15.060 --> 27:16.980]  Is that a failed collection to you,
[27:16.980 --> 27:20.900]  or is there still some worth to keeping that
[27:20.900 --> 27:23.180]  and kind of messing around with it?
[27:23.180 --> 27:25.380]  So to me, the only real failed collection
[27:25.380 --> 27:27.260]  is slimy collections.
[27:27.260 --> 27:30.220]  That's where I really put a hard line.
[27:30.220 --> 27:32.100]  Those are like putrefying microbes,
[27:32.100 --> 27:34.380]  and they can do all sorts of things.
[27:34.380 --> 27:36.980]  They can be impossible to stabilize with sugar.
[27:36.980 --> 27:39.560]  They can really give your piles hard times.
[27:39.560 --> 27:42.440]  So that's really the only like hard line for me
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.600]  is slimy, wet stuff.
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.120]  But color, I like diversity.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.440]  I mean, color's cool,
[27:49.440 --> 27:51.560]  especially when it's not just one color.
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.000]  If you're getting multiple colors, that is awesome.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.800]  I think that we have no ability to comprehend
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.440]  what those microbial communities are capable of
[28:02.440 --> 28:05.600]  when kept in community and brought to our farm.
[28:06.580 --> 28:07.500]  One of the parts that's important
[28:07.500 --> 28:08.480]  about Korean natural farming
[28:08.480 --> 28:10.140]  is we're not like saying we get it.
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.660]  We're saying we don't get it.
[28:11.660 --> 28:13.700]  Nature, can you come help us?
[28:13.700 --> 28:16.100]  And so to then sit there and nitpick
[28:16.100 --> 28:19.140]  which colors are bad and which colors are good,
[28:19.140 --> 28:21.520]  it's very relative.
[28:22.900 --> 28:24.980]  And I mean, we can get into one of those conversations.
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.340]  Like I don't have all the answers.
[28:26.340 --> 28:30.160]  Like I know green is considered to be generally trichoderma.
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.160]  What's that heat loving microbe?
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.060]  Sulfur.
[28:41.340 --> 28:43.640]  That crazy bacteria that runs away with the pile
[28:43.640 --> 28:45.700]  that you use for thermophilic composting.
[28:47.740 --> 28:49.620]  The thermophytes themselves?
[28:50.620 --> 28:52.500]  The actinobacteria, sorry.
[28:52.500 --> 28:56.980]  The blue one is the actinobacteria.
[28:56.980 --> 28:58.260]  So you can start to go through
[28:58.260 --> 28:59.820]  and catalog some of these colors.
[29:00.480 --> 29:01.320]  And I have heard warning signs.
[29:01.320 --> 29:03.280]  I'm not saying they're all perfect.
[29:03.280 --> 29:05.800]  But I'm not qualified enough to tell you.
[29:05.800 --> 29:08.680]  Like I've heard orange and red maybe be wary of,
[29:08.680 --> 29:11.780]  but like a lot of it is situational.
[29:11.780 --> 29:15.960]  So maybe if it's all one color and that color isn't white,
[29:15.960 --> 29:18.680]  then okay, maybe it's not so good.
[29:18.680 --> 29:20.920]  But I keep everything and I just grade it
[29:20.920 --> 29:23.620]  and just write down, oh, this is blue heavy.
[29:23.620 --> 29:28.320]  Like, oh, this was over 50% blue, 30% white, 10% green.
[29:28.340 --> 29:30.340]  And just write that down and maybe give it a score.
[29:30.340 --> 29:33.020]  Like I do everything like, oh, this gets a B minus
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.420]  or this gets an A minus.
[29:34.420 --> 29:36.640]  And then I use that amount accordingly.
[29:36.640 --> 29:39.000]  So I might use a quarter cup of an A plus.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.660]  And then, oh, I got something that's a C plus or a B minus.
[29:41.660 --> 29:42.660]  I only use a tablespoon.
[29:42.660 --> 29:45.760]  So you can use it in ratio
[29:45.760 --> 29:47.500]  because you want all that diversity.
[29:47.500 --> 29:49.580]  And the IMO3 pile done correctly
[29:49.580 --> 29:53.240]  is gonna select out all of the junk
[29:53.240 --> 29:56.060]  because you're creating the atmosphere you want.
[29:56.060 --> 29:59.580]  And in that 110 to 120 atmosphere,
[29:59.580 --> 30:01.460]  you're gonna be sporulating fungal bodies
[30:01.460 --> 30:03.100]  at such a drastic rate.
[30:03.100 --> 30:04.600]  They're gonna out-compete everything else.
[30:04.600 --> 30:07.000]  So you're still gonna maybe have that stuff,
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.800]  but it's gonna be in a ratio where it's not,
[30:09.800 --> 30:11.120]  those opportunistic fungi,
[30:11.120 --> 30:12.920]  they're not gonna have an opportunity.
[30:12.920 --> 30:15.480]  Whether they're opportunistic fungi or bacteria
[30:15.480 --> 30:18.520]  or anything, yeast that we don't want, whatever it is,
[30:18.520 --> 30:22.600]  they're in a ratio, they're present in a ratio
[30:22.600 --> 30:24.440]  that isn't alarming and isn't harmful.
[30:24.460 --> 30:26.820]  And that's part of some of these fail-safes
[30:26.820 --> 30:28.640]  that there are along these ways.
[30:28.640 --> 30:32.060]  When you go and you put your rice and your sugar together,
[30:32.060 --> 30:35.080]  that ability to stabilize quickly
[30:35.080 --> 30:37.380]  and not bubble over and need more sugar,
[30:37.380 --> 30:39.140]  that's a sign of quality as well.
[30:39.140 --> 30:42.160]  So there's a few things you can pay attention to
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.400]  along this road,
[30:44.300 --> 30:47.540]  but I can't give you necessarily super hard guidelines.
[30:47.540 --> 30:48.380]  It's like cooking.
[30:48.380 --> 30:51.020]  It's not like this steak is good and that steak is bad.
[30:51.020 --> 30:52.260]  There's a huge spectrum.
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.620]  And it really does take a long time
[30:53.640 --> 30:54.840]  to get those nuances.
[30:54.840 --> 30:56.980]  And I'm certainly still learning.
[30:56.980 --> 31:00.320]  And we're always having a living conversation about that
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.400]  because, I mean, Master Cho was light years ahead
[31:03.400 --> 31:05.200]  of probably where I'll ever be,
[31:05.200 --> 31:08.320]  but he also maybe doesn't know how Maine works.
[31:08.320 --> 31:10.240]  So maybe I have this little thing
[31:10.240 --> 31:11.800]  where I've got to take all his brilliance
[31:11.800 --> 31:14.040]  and just apply it to my weird scenario.
[31:14.040 --> 31:16.260]  And I get this kind of new information
[31:16.260 --> 31:17.520]  that nobody else has seen before.
[31:17.520 --> 31:21.120]  So don't be so afraid of colors,
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.760]  especially if you don't have any collections.
[31:22.860 --> 31:25.020]  If you're not sitting there with 10 white collections,
[31:25.020 --> 31:26.980]  then beggars can't be choosers.
[31:28.180 --> 31:29.660]  Work with what you can get
[31:29.660 --> 31:31.740]  because I wouldn't be throwing out anything
[31:31.740 --> 31:32.780]  if it's my first collection.
[31:32.780 --> 31:34.660]  Honestly, I'd be taking a lot of pictures
[31:34.660 --> 31:36.620]  and stabilizing it as fast as I can
[31:36.620 --> 31:38.940]  and putting it on a shelf and then talking to people.
[31:38.940 --> 31:40.300]  That's how I would go about it.
[31:40.300 --> 31:41.460]  I wouldn't be throwing out anything
[31:41.460 --> 31:44.340]  unless you got 10 things personally.
[31:44.340 --> 31:47.500]  Okay, are you using a microscope to check
[31:47.500 --> 31:50.420]  like Leighton's always talking about, scoping everything?
[31:50.440 --> 31:53.000]  So are you scoping the ones that the bad color
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.280]  and you seeing anything in there
[31:55.280 --> 31:58.720]  that's really bad for what you're doing?
[31:58.720 --> 32:02.080]  So I generally don't start scoping until IMO three,
[32:02.080 --> 32:03.600]  IMO four and liquid IMO.
[32:03.600 --> 32:05.320]  Those are when I start scoping.
[32:06.680 --> 32:09.600]  I, yeah, I don't, I've never actually mounted
[32:09.600 --> 32:12.760]  and scoped an IMO two.
[32:12.760 --> 32:13.600]  So that could be interesting.
[32:13.600 --> 32:15.480]  I've heard people say you don't see anything
[32:15.480 --> 32:17.600]  and I've heard people say it's dynamite.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.880]  You see all sorts of things.
[32:18.900 --> 32:21.300]  So I've got some depression slides
[32:21.300 --> 32:24.780]  that I wanna order soon so I can do some thicker mountings
[32:24.780 --> 32:27.140]  and get in that last lens.
[32:27.140 --> 32:28.200]  I think it's that 100X.
[32:28.200 --> 32:30.940]  When you slide it over, it presses up against the cover slip
[32:30.940 --> 32:32.860]  and it's really hard to get things to not move around.
[32:32.860 --> 32:34.420]  So I'm hoping some of these depression slips
[32:34.420 --> 32:36.300]  could help with that.
[32:36.300 --> 32:38.180]  So yeah, I generally don't bust out microscope
[32:38.180 --> 32:40.980]  until three and four because that three process,
[32:40.980 --> 32:44.620]  it sifts, it sifts out a bunch of that junk.
[32:44.620 --> 32:48.140]  So I don't know whether it's, I don't know enough.
[32:48.160 --> 32:50.680]  It's not my place to say this is good and this is bad.
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.440]  Like all microbes are good.
[32:52.440 --> 32:54.760]  And as long as we have them in the right proportion,
[32:54.760 --> 32:56.800]  then they can all come hang out and play.
[32:56.800 --> 32:59.840]  And that three kind of resets that proportion.
[32:59.840 --> 33:01.480]  As long as you have enough good guys,
[33:01.480 --> 33:05.080]  everything will kind of get set the way it needs to.
[33:05.080 --> 33:06.600]  Or at least that's my hope and my belief
[33:06.600 --> 33:07.500]  and my understanding.
[33:07.500 --> 33:09.920]  I don't have infinite amount of experience.
[33:09.920 --> 33:12.000]  So you're absolutely spot on.
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.440]  I mean, bottom line is that in the process
[33:16.460 --> 33:19.020]  of collecting all these different things,
[33:19.020 --> 33:21.420]  you're going to be getting some bio-stimulants,
[33:21.420 --> 33:24.820]  which feed the organisms that you're actually looking for.
[33:24.820 --> 33:27.420]  That white fluffy stuff is not mycelium.
[33:27.420 --> 33:30.100]  That's actually geese that are growing out,
[33:30.100 --> 33:31.760]  but they're the foundation.
[33:31.760 --> 33:34.840]  They're the successional step that's required
[33:34.840 --> 33:36.560]  to get to the sap robes.
[33:36.560 --> 33:37.880]  You're never gonna get a sap robe
[33:37.880 --> 33:40.220]  without having those basic foods
[33:40.220 --> 33:43.700]  and other diverse fungal species
[33:43.920 --> 33:46.160]  to provide the stepping stone
[33:46.160 --> 33:48.260]  for the ones that you're really after.
[33:48.260 --> 33:50.920]  And yeah, I've scoped IMO2s.
[33:50.920 --> 33:53.260]  I've scoped IMO1 collections.
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.340]  It's not something that you're really going to
[33:58.400 --> 34:00.640]  get a big bang out of, to be honest with you.
[34:00.640 --> 34:03.460]  The IMO3 is where you start to see,
[34:03.460 --> 34:04.640]  I forget what they're called.
[34:04.640 --> 34:06.780]  I think they're referred to as clubs.
[34:06.780 --> 34:08.920]  So you get these clubs and when they open up
[34:08.920 --> 34:10.920]  and they release all the spores,
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.400]  those are a good indicator
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.140]  that your IMO3 is on the right path.
[34:16.140 --> 34:19.540]  And Quinn, you're spot on about not stressing
[34:19.540 --> 34:20.900]  about the different colors.
[34:20.900 --> 34:22.400]  They're gonna shake out.
[34:22.400 --> 34:23.240]  As a matter of fact,
[34:23.240 --> 34:26.620]  the diversity may actually get you a better ground start
[34:26.620 --> 34:28.700]  or a zero to 10 start
[34:28.700 --> 34:31.480]  than one that's just a white fluffy collection.
[34:32.540 --> 34:34.940]  So, and yeah, as far as getting to a point
[34:34.940 --> 34:37.220]  where you're getting the diversity
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.760]  that you're really looking for under the scope,
[34:41.760 --> 34:45.480]  IMO4 is really gonna be where it's happening, not IMO3.
[34:45.480 --> 34:48.280]  So, definitely get your depressed slides.
[34:48.280 --> 34:53.280]  And another trick is, are you using oil with that specific,
[34:56.400 --> 34:58.320]  fuck, I can't even think of it, lens.
[34:58.320 --> 35:00.560]  Because that's an oil immersion lens.
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.160]  The oil immersion slides.
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.200]  I haven't, I've heard about it.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.040]  I haven't tried it.
[35:05.040 --> 35:05.860]  I've never done it.
[35:06.520 --> 35:09.440]  Like, it intimidates the heck out of me, to be honest.
[35:09.440 --> 35:11.360]  It's a nightmare.
[35:11.360 --> 35:13.580]  Whenever I talk about microscoping
[35:13.580 --> 35:16.000]  or teaching somebody an individual microscope,
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.880]  I go, don't worry about the fucking oil lens.
[35:18.880 --> 35:20.520]  It's a nightmare.
[35:20.520 --> 35:23.300]  Getting that adjustment just perfect.
[35:23.300 --> 35:24.480]  And what are you really doing?
[35:24.480 --> 35:27.760]  You're zooming in and looking at specific bacteria.
[35:27.760 --> 35:30.840]  The bacterial communities are changing so fucking rapidly
[35:30.840 --> 35:33.920]  that this is just a snapshot in one time.
[35:33.940 --> 35:37.620]  And by looking at it, you've changed it all already anyway.
[35:37.620 --> 35:40.700]  So, unless you're doing DNA sequencing
[35:40.700 --> 35:43.700]  or trying to count specific types of bacteria
[35:43.700 --> 35:46.960]  in a specific environment at a specific time,
[35:46.960 --> 35:48.620]  there's no need to go there.
[35:48.620 --> 35:50.180]  You can get everything else you need
[35:50.180 --> 35:55.180]  with the other three filters or lenses.
[35:57.380 --> 36:00.620]  I don't know what's wrong with my fucking brain today.
[36:00.640 --> 36:02.680]  I thought you were dabbing maybe before the show.
[36:02.680 --> 36:03.520]  Dude, fucking copy.
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.100]  Look how hard it is, dude.
[36:07.040 --> 36:08.040]  I'm losing it.
[36:08.040 --> 36:08.880]  All right, Quinn.
[36:08.880 --> 36:10.680]  So, we're dialed in,
[36:10.680 --> 36:13.040]  especially hearing you guys talk about
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.640]  not having the rainbow because for a snapshot in time,
[36:17.640 --> 36:20.200]  some individuals were calling that the rainbow of death,
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.160]  meaning that that whole IMO culture was not worth it.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.040]  So again, there's a lot of information,
[36:27.040 --> 36:28.740]  sometimes maybe misinformation,
[36:28.920 --> 36:32.440]  or people that maybe kind of just heard one thing.
[36:32.440 --> 36:34.240]  And I think Ken even talked about that,
[36:34.240 --> 36:37.000]  or how individuals will hear something
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.360]  and then do zero research on it
[36:39.360 --> 36:42.920]  and then just teach it to everybody else like it's gospel.
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.240]  So, that's why I think a lot of the forum stuff days,
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.960]  there was just too much noise, man.
[36:48.960 --> 36:50.400]  Not enough people actually doing it,
[36:50.400 --> 36:53.320]  just people throwing up some photos and saying.
[36:53.320 --> 36:56.340]  Well, Brian, it's funny that you should say that
[36:56.340 --> 36:58.400]  about the rainbow of death.
[36:59.340 --> 37:01.860]  I got my collection and I have a rainbow.
[37:01.860 --> 37:03.620]  First thing I did was I called Chris
[37:03.620 --> 37:05.340]  and I went down that rabbit hole with him.
[37:05.340 --> 37:07.780]  I'm like, look, everything on the forums,
[37:07.780 --> 37:10.140]  everyone's talking about don't use the colors.
[37:10.140 --> 37:11.900]  What is your opinion on it?
[37:11.900 --> 37:12.900]  He goes, it doesn't matter.
[37:12.900 --> 37:14.540]  Just apply it in.
[37:14.540 --> 37:17.220]  Again, you're mixing all of your IMOs together
[37:17.220 --> 37:20.660]  when you go to do IMO three, so don't stress about it.
[37:20.660 --> 37:23.500]  So, that's from Chris's mouth.
[37:23.500 --> 37:27.460]  He's not one to say, oh God, you gotta throw it out.
[37:27.460 --> 37:28.300]  He's not.
[37:28.300 --> 37:31.040]  The slime, yes, and Quinn's spot on.
[37:31.040 --> 37:33.380]  If it's a slimy one, don't use it.
[37:34.640 --> 37:37.840]  Yeah, and everybody wants to jump on
[37:37.840 --> 37:40.960]  and take everybody's ideas and market them as their own
[37:40.960 --> 37:42.600]  and make money off it.
[37:42.600 --> 37:45.320]  And that's not what we're about on FCP.
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.860]  We're about sharing all the information
[37:47.860 --> 37:52.080]  to give you guys the chance to create the best that you can.
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.120]  And there's more ways to get to the exact same end result.
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.020]  See, it's not just IMOs.
[37:58.020 --> 38:00.500]  It's this over here and this over here.
[38:00.500 --> 38:04.420]  It's combining them all and understanding the predator prey.
[38:04.420 --> 38:07.860]  You guys were talking about the rainbows
[38:07.860 --> 38:10.020]  and the different microbiology.
[38:10.020 --> 38:11.900]  You need the food source for the one
[38:11.900 --> 38:13.700]  before you can have the other.
[38:13.700 --> 38:16.360]  And that's where the biostimulant comes in
[38:16.360 --> 38:19.740]  to such great effect to feed what's already there.
[38:19.740 --> 38:23.540]  What we wanna find is the targeted IMO
[38:23.540 --> 38:26.640]  that say our plant needs extra calcium.
[38:26.640 --> 38:30.800]  We can target that particular IMO that has that biology,
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.560]  put it into the soil a week before we're going into flower
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.780]  so we have that extra calcium coming in.
[38:36.780 --> 38:38.920]  Because when you remove your fan leaves
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.880]  at your 21 day trim,
[38:40.880 --> 38:43.840]  you're removing that calcium the plant has stored.
[38:43.840 --> 38:46.560]  You wanna put the biology in to be able to give
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.640]  that calcium back to your plant at a faster rate.
[38:51.910 --> 38:53.550]  Beautifully said.
[38:55.210 --> 38:57.770]  Yeah, Ken's hopping on, throwing some gold bars
[38:57.770 --> 39:00.850]  and then going back into the wizard of Oz castle.
[39:00.850 --> 39:02.970]  Behind the curtain.
[39:02.970 --> 39:04.370]  The man behind the curtain.
[39:04.370 --> 39:07.450]  Gizdi, the person behind the curtain.
[39:09.770 --> 39:14.410]  All right, Quinn, so now we've learned our IMO.
[39:14.410 --> 39:16.290]  We're putting all that time and effort into things.
[39:16.290 --> 39:18.610]  Hang on, let's talk about location.
[39:18.630 --> 39:19.450]  Because that's another thing
[39:19.450 --> 39:21.870]  that people really struggle with.
[39:21.870 --> 39:23.670]  So Quinn, what is your experience
[39:23.670 --> 39:27.590]  on finding specific locations and how deep do you bury them?
[39:27.590 --> 39:29.990]  Talk about your procedure.
[39:29.990 --> 39:31.230]  Cool.
[39:31.230 --> 39:34.530]  Yeah, so my strategy is I always,
[39:34.530 --> 39:36.950]  I just try to find the biggest, healthiest tree.
[39:36.950 --> 39:38.590]  That's how I start, always.
[39:38.590 --> 39:39.830]  Not saying it's right.
[39:39.830 --> 39:41.070]  Just what I like to do.
[39:42.190 --> 39:44.470]  To me it has like, you're seeing the,
[39:44.470 --> 39:47.070]  you know, you're seeing like the trees in the forest.
[39:47.130 --> 39:48.730]  Like you're seeing the whole forest, right?
[39:48.730 --> 39:51.270]  Take a look at the whole forest, not just the ground.
[39:51.270 --> 39:54.050]  Try to get a feel for the lay of the land.
[39:54.050 --> 39:55.530]  Oh, the trees are small over here.
[39:55.530 --> 39:57.610]  Oh, they're big over there.
[39:57.610 --> 39:58.530]  So that's kind of how I start.
[39:58.530 --> 40:00.250]  I usually try to find trees that I'm like,
[40:00.250 --> 40:01.490]  ooh, I like this tree.
[40:01.490 --> 40:03.970]  Okay, is there mushrooms around this tree?
[40:03.970 --> 40:06.090]  Okay, maybe there is, maybe there isn't.
[40:06.090 --> 40:08.350]  But like, pay attention, look around.
[40:09.490 --> 40:11.250]  And then I'm gonna start like,
[40:11.250 --> 40:13.010]  I'm gonna find the tree and I'm gonna start searching.
[40:13.010 --> 40:14.570]  I'm gonna start moving stuff away,
[40:14.570 --> 40:17.630]  maybe rolling logs over and looking for mycelium.
[40:17.630 --> 40:20.510]  It takes a little while to get an eye for,
[40:20.510 --> 40:22.990]  is this mycelium, is this roots?
[40:22.990 --> 40:24.070]  And what the difference is.
[40:24.070 --> 40:25.210]  That takes a little bit.
[40:25.210 --> 40:28.830]  And the mycelium is a more brilliant white.
[40:28.830 --> 40:30.450]  It's just, it's hard to explain.
[40:30.450 --> 40:33.510]  It's just more vibrant, more marshmallow-like.
[40:33.510 --> 40:35.950]  It's a really marshmallow-y,
[40:35.950 --> 40:39.870]  like almost synthetic looking, just bright white.
[40:39.870 --> 40:41.550]  So look around for that.
[40:41.570 --> 40:44.610]  There's different styles of mycelium growth.
[40:44.610 --> 40:47.170]  You can get this spirally kind of growth
[40:47.170 --> 40:50.810]  and you can get this more 90 degree branching growth
[40:50.810 --> 40:52.910]  that looks a little more like a tree root.
[40:53.850 --> 40:55.010]  I don't know the difference.
[40:55.010 --> 40:56.330]  They're just things that I see.
[40:56.330 --> 40:57.450]  Let's get both of them.
[40:57.450 --> 40:59.930]  Because I'm not here to say, oh, I want saprophytes
[40:59.930 --> 41:02.730]  and I want, or I want mycorrhizal or, you know,
[41:02.730 --> 41:05.290]  I don't want saprophytes and I only want mycorrhizal.
[41:05.290 --> 41:06.530]  Like I don't have any opinions.
[41:06.530 --> 41:08.730]  I want whatever's making the forest
[41:08.730 --> 41:11.410]  that I'm in operate optimally.
[41:12.190 --> 41:13.910]  I don't have an opinion.
[41:13.910 --> 41:15.710]  I just want to bring as much nature as I can.
[41:15.710 --> 41:18.930]  So I'm looking for patches of mycelial growth
[41:18.930 --> 41:20.310]  if I can find it.
[41:20.310 --> 41:21.870]  And then I'm going to move away
[41:21.870 --> 41:24.790]  and I'm going to place the box like as directly in contact
[41:24.790 --> 41:26.150]  with that patch as I can.
[41:26.150 --> 41:28.350]  And then I'm going to skirt that leaf duff
[41:28.350 --> 41:29.990]  and all of that loose material,
[41:29.990 --> 41:32.190]  like that pre-O horizon, right?
[41:32.190 --> 41:36.150]  Anything that isn't actually humic material yet
[41:36.150 --> 41:38.270]  is I'm going to move loosely, put the box
[41:38.270 --> 41:40.150]  and kind of move back around the box.
[41:40.150 --> 41:42.090]  That's kind of my protocol.
[41:42.090 --> 41:44.810]  Something that Chris teaches is actually go
[41:44.810 --> 41:47.250]  and find a singular mycelial hyphae
[41:47.250 --> 41:48.650]  that has no substrate on it.
[41:48.650 --> 41:51.130]  So no wood, like clean it off, get it nice and clean.
[41:51.130 --> 41:53.170]  You can actually put that in the box directly
[41:53.170 --> 41:55.290]  on the rice for first access.
[41:55.290 --> 41:58.530]  And first access is a concept that we'll talk about a lot
[41:58.530 --> 42:01.930]  when you're looking at inoculum, you know,
[42:01.930 --> 42:02.950]  theory in general.
[42:02.950 --> 42:06.010]  So IMO 3 uses first access.
[42:06.010 --> 42:08.730]  IMO 1 uses first access.
[42:08.730 --> 42:11.350]  And it really gives that microbe
[42:11.350 --> 42:13.850]  and that type of microbe a big advantage.
[42:14.790 --> 42:19.790]  So something else to get people's noodles really cooking
[42:21.150 --> 42:24.670]  is I'm growing cannabis and a myriad of vegetables
[42:24.670 --> 42:27.110]  and trying to just steward the land that I have.
[42:27.110 --> 42:29.230]  I'm starting like a little food forest.
[42:29.230 --> 42:32.830]  I got a bunch of orchard trees coming this year for fruit.
[42:32.830 --> 42:35.470]  So, but also what are you growing?
[42:35.470 --> 42:36.870]  Like if you're growing cannabis,
[42:36.870 --> 42:38.470]  you definitely want fungal dominance.
[42:39.210 --> 42:41.370]  And I really like looking in the woods,
[42:41.370 --> 42:45.290]  but you can also go culture things in diverse places.
[42:46.770 --> 42:49.890]  The most extreme example is Steve Reisner.
[42:49.890 --> 42:52.950]  He's doing IMOs in aquatic atmospheres.
[42:52.950 --> 42:56.450]  Like he's doing underwater IMO collections.
[42:56.450 --> 42:58.670]  You can do prairie IMO collections.
[42:58.670 --> 42:59.930]  There's different protocols
[42:59.930 --> 43:02.150]  for doing those aquatic IMO collections.
[43:02.150 --> 43:04.170]  They're pretty freaking sweet.
[43:04.170 --> 43:07.410]  But also like if you're growing brassicas,
[43:07.410 --> 43:09.790]  IMOs from a fungal dominated forest,
[43:09.790 --> 43:11.130]  it's probably not gonna help.
[43:11.130 --> 43:13.210]  I can't even grow brassicas in my greenhouse.
[43:13.210 --> 43:15.190]  They all die immediately.
[43:15.190 --> 43:18.870]  So don't be afraid to match your collection,
[43:18.870 --> 43:23.070]  location and area with your crop that you're trying to grow.
[43:23.070 --> 43:26.150]  You know, it's not a one size fits all necessarily.
[43:26.150 --> 43:27.750]  I hope that wasn't too off topic.
[43:28.990 --> 43:30.630]  No, no, I think that was spot on.
[43:30.630 --> 43:32.710]  And again, you gotta remind people
[43:32.710 --> 43:35.750]  that brassicas are not fungally associated.
[43:35.770 --> 43:36.930]  They're not gonna do well
[43:36.930 --> 43:39.990]  if you put them in a fungally dominant soil.
[43:40.950 --> 43:44.290]  So that was an important little gold bar there.
[43:44.290 --> 43:46.970]  And as far as like doing different collections
[43:46.970 --> 43:49.610]  in different areas, oh, highly recommend it.
[43:49.610 --> 43:54.610]  You know, that area right between the field and the forest,
[43:54.730 --> 43:56.730]  I've had amazing successes there.
[43:56.730 --> 43:58.470]  And now you're getting the best of both worlds.
[43:58.470 --> 44:01.090]  You're getting the potential mycorrhizae
[44:01.090 --> 44:03.230]  coming out of the grasses,
[44:03.230 --> 44:06.930]  as well as the saprods coming out of the forest area.
[44:06.930 --> 44:09.210]  Now, do you cover the top?
[44:09.210 --> 44:10.570]  That's always been a big one.
[44:10.570 --> 44:12.950]  Are you keeping the top exposed?
[44:12.950 --> 44:16.530]  Yeah, so I do paper towel and then hardware mesh,
[44:16.530 --> 44:17.610]  like, you know what I mean?
[44:17.610 --> 44:19.930]  Like a metal screen that's really rough.
[44:19.930 --> 44:21.610]  So like a raccoon can't get in there.
[44:21.610 --> 44:24.570]  And then staple gun, staple gun everything,
[44:24.570 --> 44:26.850]  you know, get a hand stapler, staple everything down.
[44:26.850 --> 44:29.170]  And then I like use laundry baskets,
[44:30.010 --> 44:31.370]  which is something that I learned
[44:31.390 --> 44:34.790]  from one of my soil smiths at my first class in Connecticut
[44:34.790 --> 44:36.590]  in 19, I think that was.
[44:37.790 --> 44:41.110]  So taking those, taking like a laundry basket
[44:41.110 --> 44:42.650]  that has a lot of holes in the sides of it,
[44:42.650 --> 44:44.930]  but has a hard rigid, you know, bottom.
[44:44.930 --> 44:47.070]  So when you flip it up, it stops rain,
[44:47.070 --> 44:48.670]  but it still allows breeze.
[44:48.670 --> 44:51.710]  And then just throw a big rock or a log on it, you know,
[44:51.710 --> 44:52.710]  and they're easy to carry
[44:52.710 --> 44:54.230]  because you can stack a bunch of them
[44:54.230 --> 44:55.870]  and then put all your boxes inside of it
[44:55.870 --> 44:57.950]  and go in the woods, you know, with the big,
[44:57.950 --> 44:59.910]  just kind of just two hands full of stuff
[44:59.930 --> 45:02.570]  rather than like, I spent so much time setting up tarps
[45:02.570 --> 45:05.250]  and ropes and paracord and, you know,
[45:05.250 --> 45:06.750]  all that stuff when I first started.
[45:06.750 --> 45:09.210]  And it's, it makes you look a lot crazier
[45:09.210 --> 45:11.130]  when people see you doing stuff.
[45:11.130 --> 45:13.590]  And it, and it also is a lot more work.
[45:13.590 --> 45:15.690]  And I didn't find that the results were any better.
[45:15.690 --> 45:20.690]  So I highly recommend laundry baskets for the tops.
[45:21.290 --> 45:22.810]  Yeah, they work good.
[45:22.810 --> 45:27.030]  That was a huge gold bar that protects them from animals
[45:27.030 --> 45:29.750]  short of bears from getting to them.
[45:30.490 --> 45:31.330]  But I meant also,
[45:31.330 --> 45:35.090]  do you cover the top of the IMO collection box with leaf duff
[45:35.090 --> 45:37.570]  or do you leave the top closed?
[45:37.570 --> 45:39.050]  I did it when I started.
[45:39.050 --> 45:41.930]  And then after I went to the, my first class,
[45:41.930 --> 45:45.070]  Chris was doing that and I started doing it.
[45:45.070 --> 45:47.050]  It can be timely sometimes, you know,
[45:47.050 --> 45:50.410]  to like how much my ciliated material can you find.
[45:50.410 --> 45:52.730]  But if I can find my ciliated material,
[45:52.730 --> 45:55.410]  I will totally put that on top of, you know,
[45:55.410 --> 45:56.450]  usually just a few pieces.
[45:56.450 --> 45:58.930]  But if, I mean, if you got my ciliated material everywhere,
[45:58.950 --> 46:00.350]  if I find a log that's just covered,
[46:00.350 --> 46:02.870]  I'll always put that right on top of the box.
[46:02.870 --> 46:05.670]  So yeah, if it's available, definitely it's not a,
[46:05.670 --> 46:07.870]  it's not a, you know, do what you can, you know,
[46:07.870 --> 46:08.790]  kind of thing.
[46:08.790 --> 46:13.190]  But for the, you know, general application,
[46:13.190 --> 46:15.110]  you don't bury the box.
[46:15.110 --> 46:17.150]  You just bury the sides of it, correct?
[46:17.150 --> 46:19.450]  And leave the top exposed to the air.
[46:19.450 --> 46:21.950]  Yeah, so I'll take all the leaves and pull it
[46:21.950 --> 46:24.070]  and try to find the mycelium.
[46:24.070 --> 46:25.510]  It's usually right on that top layer
[46:25.510 --> 46:28.790]  in a good deciduous forest and just drop in that box.
[46:29.650 --> 46:32.810]  So basically on the physical hard ground that's myceliated
[46:32.810 --> 46:34.210]  and then taking all that leaf duff
[46:34.210 --> 46:37.170]  and covering it back up, but never usually,
[46:37.170 --> 46:38.770]  I'm not spilling it over.
[46:38.770 --> 46:42.690]  I'm not doming it over the box.
[46:42.690 --> 46:44.610]  You're not burying the box.
[46:44.610 --> 46:46.770]  You're leaving the top exposed.
[46:46.770 --> 46:48.770]  I don't want to like rip into that.
[46:48.770 --> 46:51.450]  I don't want to invade that mycelium.
[46:51.450 --> 46:54.490]  Like I don't want to dig into the ground to,
[46:54.490 --> 46:56.770]  like me personally, I'm not saying it's right or wrong,
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.830]  but I personally don't want to like dig into the ground
[46:58.830 --> 47:00.810]  and disturb, the whole point is like low disturbance.
[47:00.810 --> 47:03.310]  Like I don't really want to find the nicest patch
[47:03.310 --> 47:06.070]  of mycelium in an acre and then go digging in it.
[47:06.070 --> 47:06.950]  Like that just doesn't,
[47:06.950 --> 47:08.950]  that seems like kind of a dick move, right?
[47:08.950 --> 47:09.910]  Yeah, no, agreed.
[47:09.910 --> 47:11.470]  And just to clarify,
[47:11.470 --> 47:14.390]  I'm not suggesting people dig into the humus layer.
[47:14.390 --> 47:18.370]  You're really trying to just expose that humus layer,
[47:18.370 --> 47:20.430]  drop your box on top of it.
[47:20.430 --> 47:23.850]  And then personally, I did cover my boxes
[47:23.850 --> 47:26.310]  and I put a little flag in it so I could find it.
[47:26.850 --> 47:27.850]  And that was really, really important.
[47:27.850 --> 47:29.690]  Cause I went back and I'm like,
[47:29.690 --> 47:31.130]  fuck, I thought it was right here.
[47:31.130 --> 47:32.810]  And I'm looking around and I was like,
[47:32.810 --> 47:35.370]  finally I stumbled across the flag.
[47:35.370 --> 47:37.210]  And I'm like, fuck, this is nowhere near
[47:37.210 --> 47:38.530]  where I thought I put it.
[47:38.530 --> 47:40.650]  Because you can get disorientated
[47:40.650 --> 47:42.890]  when you're out there doing these collections.
[47:42.890 --> 47:44.690]  You know, you go there one day, you're all excited.
[47:44.690 --> 47:47.850]  You come back and you're like, fuck, where did I put it?
[47:47.850 --> 47:50.410]  So the laundry basket's a great way of, you know,
[47:50.410 --> 47:53.090]  quickly identifying where you did it.
[47:53.090 --> 47:55.770]  Personally, I did cover the top with the leaves.
[47:56.730 --> 47:58.370]  Again, I didn't dig the box in.
[47:58.370 --> 48:01.290]  I just got to that humus layer, placed the box,
[48:01.290 --> 48:04.130]  and then covered the whole thing up with the leaves.
[48:04.130 --> 48:08.570]  But if you've done it the other way and had success,
[48:08.570 --> 48:11.610]  audience, once again, there is no perfect right way.
[48:11.610 --> 48:13.190]  There's variables.
[48:14.090 --> 48:18.050]  I would say, you saying like, don't rip into it.
[48:18.050 --> 48:20.050]  You're not there to tear up shit.
[48:20.050 --> 48:22.490]  You're only there to try to gently collect
[48:22.490 --> 48:24.690]  or encourage the microbes to enter
[48:24.790 --> 48:27.830]  into your collection so that you can harvest them
[48:27.830 --> 48:30.710]  without doing harm to the area.
[48:30.710 --> 48:31.550]  But thank you.
[48:31.550 --> 48:33.430]  And I want to throw one other thing out
[48:33.430 --> 48:35.270]  that Leighton's mentioned many times
[48:35.270 --> 48:39.550]  on many different shows is the downwind side of the tree.
[48:39.550 --> 48:43.710]  So you've got the, you're not getting wind blown.
[48:43.710 --> 48:45.270]  Leighton can explain it better.
[48:46.230 --> 48:50.550]  So what it's called is using what's called the,
[48:51.950 --> 48:53.750]  oh God, see, dude,
[48:53.770 --> 48:55.130]  someone talked about hero dosing.
[48:55.130 --> 48:56.370]  Maybe it is getting to me.
[48:56.370 --> 48:58.810]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[48:58.810 --> 49:00.250]  Prevailing wind, all right.
[49:00.250 --> 49:03.330]  Prevailing wind is where typically
[49:03.330 --> 49:07.570]  the wind blows from or towards.
[49:07.570 --> 49:10.090]  So what you do is you walk into the woods
[49:10.090 --> 49:12.930]  and you look at wherever there's a stone wall
[49:12.930 --> 49:15.730]  or a tree or blowdown is what we call them
[49:15.730 --> 49:17.530]  and look on both sides of them
[49:17.530 --> 49:21.810]  and see which side has more of this stuff accumulated by.
[49:21.830 --> 49:25.590]  But if you put an IMO collection in that duff
[49:25.590 --> 49:28.190]  that the prevailing wind built,
[49:28.190 --> 49:31.030]  I guarantee you a wonderful collection
[49:31.030 --> 49:32.670]  without a lot of effort.
[49:32.670 --> 49:35.230]  So that's just a, that's a little trick.
[49:35.230 --> 49:37.490]  Gold bar, gold bar alert.
[49:38.470 --> 49:40.710]  And if you are newer to this,
[49:40.710 --> 49:44.150]  I've found that acorns, Marco's said this as well.
[49:44.150 --> 49:46.490]  Like if you're really trying to get a nice mycelium patch
[49:46.490 --> 49:49.190]  or feeling frustrated underneath acorn trees
[49:49.190 --> 49:53.650]  for whatever reason, seems to be an easier way
[49:53.650 --> 49:58.010]  to find success than maybe some other trees in the forest.
[49:58.010 --> 50:00.450]  And you know, what I love when mentioned
[50:00.450 --> 50:05.370]  was actually taking the time to look at the trees.
[50:05.370 --> 50:08.490]  Like I tell people, use your intuition.
[50:08.490 --> 50:11.170]  When you're out there, like just take the time
[50:11.170 --> 50:15.810]  to let your body talk to you, let the trees talk to you.
[50:15.810 --> 50:18.730]  Because they will not tell you,
[50:19.270 --> 50:21.910]  oh, collect here if there's a path.
[50:21.910 --> 50:23.270]  If you're paying attention.
[50:23.270 --> 50:25.430]  But if you're not, you're not in touch,
[50:25.430 --> 50:27.030]  then start medicating.
[50:27.030 --> 50:29.990]  Start figuring out your spiritual aspect
[50:29.990 --> 50:32.950]  or your spiritual side so that you can use your intuition.
[50:32.950 --> 50:34.550]  We all have intuition,
[50:34.550 --> 50:36.750]  just not everybody knows how to use it.
[50:36.750 --> 50:38.750]  Are those your boxes, Quinn?
[50:38.750 --> 50:40.310]  Yeah, yeah, those are my boxes.
[50:40.310 --> 50:45.310]  Yeah, that actually was a batch before I got my rice cooker.
[50:46.130 --> 50:49.930]  Like I went and bought the biggest Instapot to do better.
[50:49.930 --> 50:51.730]  That was actually all mostly burnt rice.
[50:51.730 --> 50:53.410]  And I still got, not burnt,
[50:53.410 --> 50:57.210]  but there was a solid brown bottom layer
[50:57.210 --> 51:00.650]  that was a little more beat up than I would like.
[51:00.650 --> 51:02.770]  And I think I still pulled like,
[51:02.770 --> 51:05.730]  I think I kept two or three of those out of the six.
[51:05.730 --> 51:08.990]  But still worth the time, worth my while.
[51:10.050 --> 51:11.970]  And I just label them accordingly to the quality
[51:11.970 --> 51:14.970]  that I feel like they are based on the limited information
[51:15.830 --> 51:17.870]  and understanding that I have about the process.
[51:17.870 --> 51:19.710]  And just keep at it, you know,
[51:19.710 --> 51:23.430]  just keep throwing boxes out two to three times a season.
[51:23.430 --> 51:26.150]  Chris always says three, like get a spring,
[51:26.150 --> 51:28.390]  get a summer and get a fall.
[51:28.390 --> 51:30.270]  Up in Maine, it's really cold.
[51:30.270 --> 51:32.350]  I tell people we don't really have summer,
[51:32.350 --> 51:33.750]  spring just kisses fall,
[51:33.750 --> 51:35.430]  and then we go back to Arctic winter.
[51:35.430 --> 51:37.870]  So, you know, sometimes it's easier for me
[51:37.870 --> 51:41.070]  to get like a shoulder of summer collections,
[51:41.070 --> 51:43.790]  but yeah, yeah, you can try different things.
[51:43.810 --> 51:44.650]  And if you're tropical,
[51:44.650 --> 51:46.570]  you might be able to get four collections, you know,
[51:46.570 --> 51:49.570]  you might be able to get collections in all four seasons.
[51:49.570 --> 51:52.210]  Yeah, and then there's a poor guys up in Canada
[51:52.210 --> 51:55.210]  that don't see much for green, you know,
[51:55.210 --> 51:57.090]  most of the year, you know.
[51:57.090 --> 52:01.650]  Yeah, yeah, it's tricky stuff.
[52:01.650 --> 52:04.330]  Something I do a lot of times is I'll put my boxes out
[52:04.330 --> 52:07.210]  and after like 14 days or like 10 days,
[52:07.210 --> 52:08.610]  depending on how I feel,
[52:08.610 --> 52:12.330]  and maybe I'm checking that the conditional box,
[52:12.330 --> 52:14.650]  you know, the indicator box,
[52:14.650 --> 52:18.090]  and then I'll actually take all my boxes into my grow room
[52:18.090 --> 52:21.330]  and finish them for 48 hours to get an actual bloom,
[52:21.330 --> 52:22.630]  because they're not gonna get any better
[52:22.630 --> 52:24.510]  just sitting out in 40 degree weather,
[52:24.510 --> 52:25.930]  but I can bring them inside,
[52:25.930 --> 52:27.130]  they're an outdoor collection,
[52:27.130 --> 52:29.650]  and I can just give them that humidity and that temperature
[52:29.650 --> 52:32.730]  to get them to proliferate enough to collect.
[52:32.730 --> 52:33.630]  So that really helps.
[52:33.630 --> 52:36.310]  I feel like that's a good for anybody up in Canada,
[52:36.310 --> 52:38.530]  anybody, you know, Maine, us Northern folk,
[52:38.530 --> 52:42.450]  like that really makes a big difference.
[52:42.450 --> 52:44.090]  And it's honestly not that much work, you know,
[52:44.090 --> 52:46.210]  you just put something out for 10 to 14 days
[52:46.210 --> 52:47.970]  and then bring it in somewhere warm,
[52:47.970 --> 52:50.570]  and you can have some pretty good results
[52:50.570 --> 52:53.850]  without really, I would say that's minimally
[52:53.850 --> 52:55.250]  augmenting the process.
[52:55.250 --> 52:57.070]  Like that's as little as possible.
[52:57.070 --> 52:59.570]  I ran that by Chris, that was actually Chris's idea.
[52:59.570 --> 53:01.970]  So yeah, and I just extrapolated on it
[53:01.970 --> 53:03.410]  and tried it at different times
[53:03.410 --> 53:05.850]  and it helps with the grow room because they're so humid
[53:05.850 --> 53:07.010]  and they're already so yeasty.
[53:07.010 --> 53:09.730]  I mean, it's already an IMO four filled grow room,
[53:09.730 --> 53:12.370]  so it doesn't hurt too bad.
[53:12.370 --> 53:14.770]  And no, you do not wanna rinse the rice.
[53:14.770 --> 53:16.050]  You just wanna cook it.
[53:16.050 --> 53:17.990]  All the aspects of the rice you can.
[53:19.250 --> 53:22.590]  All right, so now that we've talked about collections
[53:22.590 --> 53:24.690]  and how to collect and where to collect
[53:24.690 --> 53:29.190]  and what to look for when you're going to collect,
[53:29.190 --> 53:30.930]  let's talk about stabilization
[53:30.930 --> 53:32.530]  because this is something I think
[53:32.530 --> 53:35.210]  that I fear a lot of people fuck up
[53:35.210 --> 53:39.130]  and how important it is to get that collection
[53:39.130 --> 53:42.370]  banked into that sugar as fast as possible
[53:42.370 --> 53:43.850]  after opening the box.
[53:43.850 --> 53:46.050]  As long as the box is sealed, like you said,
[53:46.050 --> 53:48.810]  you can bring it home, you can put it in the greenhouse
[53:48.810 --> 53:50.330]  and it'll proliferate even more.
[53:50.330 --> 53:54.730]  But once you open that box, talk to the people, my friend.
[53:54.730 --> 53:55.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:55.570 --> 53:59.130]  So I usually have a big mixing container
[53:59.130 --> 54:04.130]  and then I might even crack open all the boxes
[54:04.490 --> 54:06.770]  and then start, just kinda put them in order
[54:06.770 --> 54:08.250]  of what I think their great ability is,
[54:08.250 --> 54:11.810]  potentially start taking notes, maybe make myself a video.
[54:11.810 --> 54:14.690]  And then maybe I'll start from best and go to worst
[54:14.690 --> 54:18.090]  and get that, throw it into a big mixing container,
[54:18.090 --> 54:20.370]  tear the weight, add sugar, mix by hand,
[54:20.370 --> 54:23.330]  never anything metal, wooden spoon or by hand.
[54:23.330 --> 54:25.410]  And then I usually just have two cases
[54:25.410 --> 54:27.050]  of half gallon mason jars.
[54:27.050 --> 54:29.410]  And usually I can fit a whole box
[54:29.410 --> 54:32.530]  in a half gallon mason jar, but sometimes I can't.
[54:33.490 --> 54:35.930]  You wanna mix it until it starts getting really wet
[54:35.930 --> 54:37.610]  and just everything should be broken up,
[54:37.610 --> 54:39.250]  but you shouldn't be smashing anything.
[54:39.250 --> 54:40.610]  These are living organisms.
[54:42.090 --> 54:47.090]  So yeah, you should be able to have the whole collection
[54:47.250 --> 54:52.250]  from time of crack to jar, easily stabilized in two hours.
[54:52.450 --> 54:54.650]  And then you can go back and sugar cap
[54:54.650 --> 54:56.770]  or add a little bit of sugar if you need to.
[54:56.770 --> 54:58.330]  But like I said before,
[54:58.330 --> 54:59.890]  if things are bubbling really vigorously,
[54:59.890 --> 55:00.890]  I didn't know this for a while,
[55:01.250 --> 55:02.770]  that's a sign of degradation.
[55:02.770 --> 55:04.730]  That's a sign of instability.
[55:04.730 --> 55:07.130]  That's a sign that there's some microbes in there
[55:07.130 --> 55:09.730]  that aren't gonna play well with others.
[55:09.730 --> 55:13.690]  So it's not unnormal for the whole thing
[55:13.690 --> 55:16.690]  to kind of grease down and the water to fill up.
[55:16.690 --> 55:19.290]  Like you'll kind of have solid sugar and rice
[55:19.290 --> 55:23.210]  and that'll kind of slump and you'll see the liquid level,
[55:23.210 --> 55:25.490]  like the honey, actually start to build.
[55:25.490 --> 55:28.010]  And certain ones that'll,
[55:28.010 --> 55:29.490]  maybe the liquid will come up halfway
[55:29.490 --> 55:33.050]  and then you'll have dry IMO two at the top
[55:33.050 --> 55:34.090]  and a certain amount of liquid.
[55:34.090 --> 55:35.650]  Some will completely submerge
[55:35.650 --> 55:37.810]  and the liquid will surpass the solid.
[55:37.810 --> 55:39.050]  So you're gonna see different things.
[55:39.050 --> 55:41.570]  And like, that's okay, there's nothing wrong with that.
[55:41.570 --> 55:43.930]  It's like, it's liquefaction that's really heavy
[55:43.930 --> 55:45.290]  and then bubbles.
[55:45.290 --> 55:48.010]  If you start after saturation is complete,
[55:48.010 --> 55:50.530]  you start seeing bubbles, you're making wine.
[55:50.530 --> 55:51.770]  Like you're making rice wine.
[55:51.770 --> 55:52.970]  That's what you're doing.
[55:52.970 --> 55:55.050]  Just like when you mix honey with water,
[55:55.050 --> 55:57.810]  there's so much yeast, it just starts turning into alcohol.
[55:57.850 --> 55:59.810]  You are making, you're fermenting,
[55:59.810 --> 56:01.330]  you're actively fermenting something
[56:01.330 --> 56:02.810]  that you're actually trying to stabilize.
[56:02.810 --> 56:04.370]  So that's what's happening there.
[56:04.370 --> 56:05.930]  That's that shift.
[56:05.930 --> 56:08.570]  Look for bubbles, just keep an eye.
[56:08.570 --> 56:12.370]  I usually would say like every two hours,
[56:12.370 --> 56:16.970]  maybe check stuff and so check on it like every two hours
[56:16.970 --> 56:19.030]  until you go to bed and then check it in the morning.
[56:19.030 --> 56:22.130]  And usually by the next day, it's pretty obvious.
[56:22.130 --> 56:24.850]  Like, whoa, that is just foaming.
[56:24.850 --> 56:26.330]  The top is foamy.
[56:26.330 --> 56:28.010]  Clearly it bubbled a lot.
[56:28.010 --> 56:29.770]  It's not getting any better.
[56:29.770 --> 56:31.210]  You know, I would say good rule of thumb,
[56:31.210 --> 56:33.890]  anything you can stabilize that night
[56:33.890 --> 56:35.650]  with a little more sugar, whether you wanna mix it in
[56:35.650 --> 56:37.630]  or just do a cake on the top.
[56:37.630 --> 56:40.050]  I would say that's probably like good rule of thumb.
[56:40.050 --> 56:41.850]  You know, maybe put, write something down like,
[56:41.850 --> 56:44.130]  oh, hyperactive, like maybe, you know,
[56:44.130 --> 56:46.130]  if you don't wanna use it.
[56:46.130 --> 56:48.170]  But if it's just that day and it's like,
[56:48.170 --> 56:49.450]  oh, that was just extra liquidy,
[56:49.450 --> 56:50.930]  that could just be more biology.
[56:50.930 --> 56:52.430]  Don't be afraid to add a little bit of sugar,
[56:52.430 --> 56:54.130]  but it's those aggressive bubbles
[56:54.130 --> 56:56.610]  that will try to run away with the whole thing
[56:56.610 --> 56:59.370]  and actually turn the whole thing into alcohol.
[56:59.370 --> 57:04.370]  And they will drastically affect the diversity
[57:05.330 --> 57:09.050]  within that jar and start getting rid of the things you want
[57:09.050 --> 57:12.370]  and start pushing everything to the stuff you don't want.
[57:12.370 --> 57:15.730]  So yeah, so I, you know, I hope that was rigid enough
[57:15.730 --> 57:17.850]  and structured enough that it helps everybody.
[57:19.810 --> 57:20.650]  Thank you for that.
[57:20.650 --> 57:25.570]  Yeah, that's probably where most people end up
[57:25.570 --> 57:27.690]  with poor results in their IML3
[57:27.690 --> 57:30.970]  is because they did actually collect something,
[57:30.970 --> 57:33.370]  but they didn't stabilize it appropriately.
[57:33.370 --> 57:36.570]  And you definitely wanna stabilize as fast as you can
[57:36.570 --> 57:37.410]  once you open it.
[57:37.410 --> 57:38.970]  That's critical.
[57:38.970 --> 57:40.610]  Brian, do you want to add?
[57:40.610 --> 57:43.610]  Just quickly rewinding some visuals
[57:43.610 --> 57:45.090]  to go with the stuff you were talking about.
[57:45.090 --> 57:49.090]  So there is the laundry basket that I also have
[57:49.130 --> 57:51.530]  for laundry purposes.
[57:51.530 --> 57:52.450]  Very similar.
[57:52.450 --> 57:54.690]  That's the one you were talking about, right?
[57:54.690 --> 57:55.930]  Yeah, those are my old ones.
[57:55.930 --> 57:57.810]  Those are actually the pine boxes
[57:57.810 --> 57:59.210]  with the original laundry basket.
[57:59.210 --> 58:02.130]  I mean, that's probably what, from 2019 fall.
[58:02.130 --> 58:05.450]  So that's like my pretty, that's pretty old school setup.
[58:05.450 --> 58:08.010]  Yeah, so now I have more gray laundry baskets
[58:08.010 --> 58:11.090]  because I do collections in state forests.
[58:11.090 --> 58:13.190]  So I try to be a little more ninja.
[58:13.190 --> 58:15.810]  That blue one can, I feel like it might get me caught
[58:15.810 --> 58:17.450]  and I don't wanna get caught, so.
[58:19.290 --> 58:21.250]  Now there's a gold bar.
[58:21.250 --> 58:23.730]  Collect in state forests where you know
[58:23.730 --> 58:26.930]  there's no pesticides, fertilizers, or anything being used.
[58:26.930 --> 58:29.210]  Yeah, legally can't be disturbed, right?
[58:29.210 --> 58:30.050]  It's good.
[58:30.050 --> 58:33.490]  Yeah, but like you said, you wanna do that stealth
[58:33.490 --> 58:36.730]  because I've gone out there and put all that work in,
[58:36.730 --> 58:41.090]  got to the car and the, not state,
[58:41.090 --> 58:44.450]  the ranger made us dump it all out right then and there.
[58:44.450 --> 58:45.930]  Oh.
[58:45.930 --> 58:47.290]  Yeah.
[58:47.330 --> 58:49.490]  Yeah, I would go with like a backpack,
[58:49.490 --> 58:51.170]  not just a five gallon bucket.
[58:51.170 --> 58:53.690]  Just, you know, learn from our mistakes.
[58:53.690 --> 58:54.690]  Oh, so wait a minute.
[58:54.690 --> 58:56.930]  You were in there duff collecting?
[58:56.930 --> 58:58.850]  Yeah, just going through, collecting stuff,
[58:58.850 --> 59:01.370]  leaf litters, just kind of playing around.
[59:01.370 --> 59:04.730]  Had a, each had a five gallon bucket of the stuff.
[59:04.730 --> 59:08.210]  Got down to the car and when we came out of the woods,
[59:08.210 --> 59:11.290]  this ranger was right there.
[59:11.290 --> 59:14.090]  Kind of just weird, dumb luck, I think.
[59:14.090 --> 59:15.050]  Yeah, that's brutal.
[59:15.090 --> 59:17.650]  You might be able to pretend you were having a picnic.
[59:17.650 --> 59:21.210]  Like if you put two IMO boxes inside a basket,
[59:21.210 --> 59:23.090]  you could, cause you're just putting something
[59:23.090 --> 59:24.050]  and then taking it out.
[59:24.050 --> 59:24.890]  You just be like, oh yeah,
[59:24.890 --> 59:26.130]  we were just having a picnic in the woods.
[59:26.130 --> 59:27.850]  Like you might be able to play it off.
[59:27.850 --> 59:30.450]  Like, you know, they might still catch you.
[59:30.450 --> 59:32.330]  Yeah, this dude was on it.
[59:32.330 --> 59:33.890]  And from what I understand with rangers,
[59:33.890 --> 59:35.570]  they have a lot of power.
[59:35.570 --> 59:39.330]  So I wasn't trying to get in trouble for it, you know.
[59:39.330 --> 59:40.770]  Yeah, I'm just playing with the feds, man.
[59:40.770 --> 59:41.690]  Not good, not good.
[59:41.690 --> 59:43.170]  Yeah, the rangers out there, those guys,
[59:43.650 --> 59:45.130]  they can peek into stuff, I guess.
[59:45.130 --> 59:46.890]  They don't necessarily have,
[59:46.890 --> 59:48.890]  you don't have to have the same rights, I guess,
[59:48.890 --> 59:51.690]  when you're out there in the federal forest,
[59:51.690 --> 59:52.530]  from what I remember.
[59:52.530 --> 59:54.530]  Just gotta put it in a picnic basket.
[59:54.530 --> 59:55.730]  There you go.
[59:55.730 --> 59:58.170]  So yeah, stealth is always key with this.
[59:58.170 --> 59:59.610]  You know, even from experience,
[59:59.610 --> 01:00:00.610]  when you're putting out those,
[01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:04.530]  maybe you do have the bright colored laundry bag or...
[01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.570]  Basket.
[01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.730]  Yeah, basket.
[01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.450]  Human beings will come in and mess,
[01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.530]  have messed with some of our IMO stuff out there.
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.450]  I think just out of pure curiosity,
[01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.210]  like what the hell is this?
[01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.690]  So yeah, you're just gonna,
[01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.410]  it definitely is a numbers game
[01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.930]  and the way that you can improve it
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.690]  and hopefully getting, instead of maybe just singles,
[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.370]  now you're getting doubles with some of the stuff
[01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.170]  that Quinn's breaking down for you.
[01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.370]  And I also personally think that I would have,
[01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.330]  more at the beginning, been more into this
[01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.130]  if I wouldn't have thought, you know,
[01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.730]  as soon as you see that rainbow,
[01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:37.090]  start a whole new collection.
[01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.810]  Because driving to the woods here in Denver,
[01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.050]  I mean, that's a commitment.
[01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.690]  That's probably more than likely an hour and a half,
[01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.090]  two hours one way to really get something decent.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.600]  And just quickly,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.120]  is this what you were talking about?
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.360]  Kind of like when you bring it home, is this stage two
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.040]  or is this like a different path,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.440]  like something different you can do?
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.080]  Yeah, so that's liquid IMO four.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.640]  And right now I'm doing a side by side with a large bubble.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.040]  Like the one on the right has large aggressive bubbles
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.160]  from a bubble snake.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.720]  And the one on the left has small fizzy bubbles
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.040]  from air stones.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.840]  And so I did a side by side to see
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.200]  what I thought was better.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.280]  I mean, granted, I only did like four or five slides
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.120]  of each one.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.360]  I could have been misled,
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.240]  but I liked the results from the more fizzy one
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.760]  with the gentler bubbles.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.840]  I felt like I had the same amount of sporulating heads
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.600]  in both, like spores.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.600]  But yeah, sorry, I felt like I had the same amount
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.600]  of spores in both, but the sporulating bodies
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.000]  and the fungal bodies were better preserved
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.400]  than the one on the left,
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.640]  which was the fizzier, smaller, gentler bubbles.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.080]  Still tons of oxygen.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.360]  You still want as much air as possible.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.800]  There's never too much air,
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.440]  but I was interested to see if the aggression
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.120]  of the one on the right would kind of mess with things.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.400]  And so I've moved towards smaller, fizzier bubbles.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.920]  It's a relatively anecdotal science experiment,
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.080]  but it's a science experiment nonetheless, right?
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.920]  Well, it's counterproductive to what the forums would say.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.200]  Back in the day, the forums would say
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.040]  the right one would be that there'd be more microbial life
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.320]  because it's a jousting and everybody's getting stronger
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.480]  and all this kind of stuff.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.840]  Well, all right, there's some truth to both of those.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.520]  So let's quantify some of this shit.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.680]  So it is understood in aquaculture
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.240]  that the smaller the bubble,
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.520]  the better ability it has to raise
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.520]  the overall dissolved oxygen in the water column
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.920]  that the fish are living in.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.760]  But on another note, the more aggressive the bubbles are,
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.680]  Brian, you're absolutely right.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.680]  The stronger it makes the organisms.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.040]  Now we're not talking about organisms.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.240]  We're talking about fungal hyphae.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.000]  So Chris and I talked way back when
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.160]  about trying to provide a substrate
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.000]  for the IMO3 to grow out hyphae.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.640]  This gets even more complicated.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.880]  So what Quinn's talking about is spore,
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.360]  sporulation and those club feet,
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.600]  which open up and release the spores.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.680]  That's something completely different
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.320]  than growing out fungal hyphae.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.040]  If you wanna grow out fungal hyphae,
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.280]  which to be honest with you,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.360]  there is very little science data to back up
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  whether a hyphae can re-up
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.760]  or grow out in a soil system.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.120]  Again, the cost of trying to do this testing
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.040]  would be insane.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.360]  It would be very difficult to repeat it based on nature.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.200]  Nature's never the fucking same.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.760]  So nobody's really wasted time doing it.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.160]  But we do know for sure,
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.480]  if you get good quality spores in a soil system,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.440]  you will be able to get the fungal hyphae
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.320]  to grow out in place in situ.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.260]  So again, what are you trying to accomplish?
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.240]  If you're trying to accomplish getting spores
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.720]  into the environment,
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.640]  then Quinn's experiment is the way to go
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.280]  because you're gonna get more viable spores.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.040]  If you're trying to grow out tea,
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.280]  you're trying to grow out protozoa and bacteria,
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.760]  the more aggressive bubbling
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.480]  is going to be more beneficial.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.680]  So you really have to be smart
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.800]  about the way you're approaching
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.080]  these two different techniques.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.000]  And the other thing is I hate air stones
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.880]  because I have to use them once.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.220]  The centers go anaerobic
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.080]  and they're a nightmare to try to clean.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.240]  I've tried soaking them in alcohol,
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.600]  I've tried bleach, I've tried everything.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.440]  At the end of the day,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.320]  you cut that stone or smash that stone,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.640]  it'll all be black in the middle.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.880]  So they're kind of one and done,
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.680]  which is not the wrong way to ship.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.480]  You definitely will see the slime on that
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.620]  if you let those go too long.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.720]  Like if you pull those out
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.640]  when you're maybe being too lazy with it
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.720]  or let it go too long,
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.400]  that's where that slime really comes from
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.920]  is where those air stones in the bottom,
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.960]  there's just nasty guck.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.720]  Caked up.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.200]  What's the longest that you'll do a Limo?
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.000]  Because isn't that usually a little bit shorter
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.320]  than if you're just doing like a regular compost tea?
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.320]  Yeah, so I am like not the compost tea expert by any means.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.560]  I did like a little bit,
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.980]  but I got into liquid IMO at the same time
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.060]  and quickly just moved in that direction.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.880]  So liquid IMO is 36 hours at 72 degrees.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.440]  So as the temperature changes of your water column,
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.600]  then the time changes.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.280]  So it's not a fixed time,
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.760]  it's a fixed time in correlation to temperature.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.660]  So Chris really pioneered all of that stuff
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.600]  to a level that I think a lot of people aren't aware of.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.120]  Like for example, Master Cho uses Chris Trump's recipe
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.720]  with no changes as the official
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.020]  Cho Global Natural Liquid IMO recipe.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.880]  So Chris really pushed a lot of that to a new level.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.720]  Leighton knows even more than me
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.040]  about how much he did to push that to a new level.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.440]  And a lot of that was because of Elaine Ingham showing him,
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.600]  hey, this is a microscope.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.920]  This is how you check his work.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.560]  And he was able to do experiments and check his work
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.340]  and get really far along that just a lot of other people
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.640]  hadn't put years into that he went and did.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.320]  So that's what we're going with.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.160]  And Chris still changes,
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.000]  he still fine tunes little things.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.880]  We just changed the amount of saltwater
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.440]  that we use from one to 20 or one to 30
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.160]  to actually now to one to 15.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.880]  We need more minerals to keep the fungi happy
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.560]  and that's something.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.480]  So there's a living element to all of these documents.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.360]  But I, you know, yeah, I encourage people to start
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.000]  from where we are and move forward
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.520]  and not try to change the stuff we've already figured out
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.200]  because you're just gonna spin your wheels a little bit.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.400]  Creativity is always good in art,
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.880]  but defiance for the sake of credit is a weird thing too.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.040]  So yeah, so 36 hours is the answer to the question,
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.720]  but that's kind of at room temperature or warmer.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.160]  A really cool thing that Chris shared with me,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.900]  I made the limo for the Regen Conference in Maine.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.240]  So like I made limo and me and Chris like demonstrated it
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.560]  in front of the class.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.600]  And like that was out of my IMO four,
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.080]  we, everybody drank it.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.440]  It was pretty hilarious.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.080]  So that something that you can do
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.920]  that he was explaining to me was you actually have
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.800]  the ability to alter the time based on the temperature
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.600]  of the water that you put in.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.880]  So if you, you know, it's, oh, it takes 36 hours,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.760]  but in 36 hours, I'm gonna be sleeping.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.400]  You can put in colder water and actually delay,
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.700]  do like a time release so that the clock
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:47.440]  maybe doesn't really start until it gets up to 65.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.680]  And then it's at full tilt when it hits 70,
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.520]  something like that.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.160]  So you can play with the temperature to your advantage
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.240]  to get that 36 number to kind of change
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.440]  and shift as you need.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.840]  So that's something that's new to me that was,
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.200]  it really put some power back in the farmer's hand
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.520]  because I mean, these, some of these piles
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.640]  and these brews, I mean, they run your life.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.720]  I mean, it's like, you're not sleeping
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.680]  in some of these piles.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.720]  I'm up all night and I love it.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.760]  And that's, you know, that's what we do.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.700]  But it's nice when you, you know, you can,
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.940]  you can get a little more control.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:23.280]  You can still respect nature,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.100]  but you don't have to disrespect yourself
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.220]  while doing it if possible.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.580]  There was a gold bar.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.640]  Temperature is a huge variable in all types
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.060]  of growing out any type of organism,
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:39.300]  whether you're doing a compost tea or a liquid IMO.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.800]  Yeah, the cooler temperatures,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.900]  you're gonna get very little results.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.820]  The higher temperature, that shit's gonna go anaerobic
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:48.860]  so fucking fast, it's gonna make your head spin.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.980]  I don't know about you, but anything over 85 degrees,
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.980]  you're in trouble.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:56.260]  You're really going to be needing to monitor it
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.180]  all the time or you're gonna lose it.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.660]  So yeah, room temperature is ideal.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.500]  I think Elaine did some work in Las Vegas
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.460]  a number of years ago for the Bellagio.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.900]  I mean, if any of you've ever been there,
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.600]  you used to see guys in these full body suits
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.160]  with masks and oxygen tanks,
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.760]  spraying shit in the middle of the fucking casino.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.120]  And they didn't want that anymore
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.200]  because everybody was like, oh my God, what's going on?
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.840]  What are they doing here?
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.800]  So she started teaching them how to use compost teas.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.400]  She got them through the whole process.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.000]  Well, these guys decided to change things to do it
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.240]  so it was easier for them and they brewed it outside
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.600]  in fucking 110 degree temperature
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.960]  and it almost killed everything.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.240]  So yeah, there's a big correlation
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.840]  between time and temperature.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.240]  Quinn, thank you so much for making sure
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.560]  that the audience hears that
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.800]  because that's gonna prevent a lot of hard lessons for sure.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.540]  That was a gold truck there
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.360]  because I remember when Dr. Elaine Ingham
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.720]  was talking about that stuff and working with the Bellagio,
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.400]  she was telling them that you have to make the tea
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.140]  within that same environment.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.920]  So a lot of individuals that were growing in their tents
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.160]  or in a basement that maybe had their teas
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.680]  outside of their actual grow room,
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.800]  we started to experiment with bringing everything
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.680]  inside that actual grow space.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.680]  So if it just happened to be maybe your environment
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.840]  is just a little bit different, whatever that was,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.880]  it seemed like there were less mistakes made
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.480]  when brewing that tea within that same environment
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.600]  you were going to apply the tea.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.320]  And I remember Dr. Elaine Ingham was talking about that.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.000]  That was one of the biggest issues
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.120]  is because she kept saying,
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.320]  well, you have to brew it inside the facility
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.240]  and nobody wanted to do that.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.360]  And now I've been to the Bellagio a few times, man,
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.600]  they're back to the bullshit
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.040]  like blue and white fertilizer stuff.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.320]  I'm sure it's, yeah, it's probably just all Montano.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.480]  I'd like to just take us back a moment.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.600]  And Leighton, have you ever tried using a Venturi
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.480]  instead of an Airstone to put the oxygen,
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.480]  the micronized bubbles into the system?
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.360]  So what I've done is I've played with
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.520]  pretty much every type of diffuser.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.360]  I've even made some different types of diffusers myself
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.680]  and I've gone back to cone bottom,
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.720]  straight piping in the water's oxygen
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.760]  and letting it diffuse naturally over the depth.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.800]  So I'm dealing with 120 gallons.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.400]  So like a 60 inch tall water column
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.960]  and I just bubble straight in
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.480]  with a three quarter inch tubing
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.720]  at the bottom underneath the T
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.200]  and just let it do its work.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.880]  And I've just found that it's simple,
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.760]  it's easy, easy to clean.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.920]  I don't have any kind of buildup in any type of diffuser.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.080]  And I still get, I get a good roll,
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.680]  a really good rolling bubble or boil,
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  but I still get an incredible result.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.600]  So I just backed off from screwing around
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.560]  with all different types of diffusers,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.800]  soaker hoses, you name it, I played with it,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.640]  drilled my own fucking holes.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.360]  And it just, it always ended up to be a problem
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.120]  cleaning and dealing with it.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.560]  So I just went back to keep it simple, stupid.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.880]  Hey Quinn, when you're messing with the Lemos
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.680]  and you're moving towards that,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.280]  like closer to that 36 hour,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.640]  do you play around with any like sugar boosts
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.280]  or do you just kind of keep it as simple as possible?
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.600]  I keep it super simple.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.960]  I don't really mess with Chris's recipes.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.560]  It just seems counterproductive.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.000]  So generally the theory would be in liquid IMO
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.760]  that the sugar is, so basically what you're trying to do
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.000]  is you're spiking it with sugar to get the bacteria
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.720]  to really get moving.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.080]  And that thermal mass, that critical mass
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.760]  is what gives the fungi the ability to really get rolling.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.760]  So once you've got the fungi rolling,
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  adding sugar doesn't really help them.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.080]  You're actually probably gonna tilt the scale
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.080]  back into the previous direction of the bacteria.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.640]  That would be my understanding of what's happening.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.840]  So I don't see how that could,
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.920]  I don't see how that could help, yeah.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.080]  Yeah, and that's another thing from the forums
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.600]  that used to be almost gospel latent
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.360]  and now we're starting to realize that we were adding,
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.600]  even back then we were adding
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.600]  the unsulfured blackstrap molasses
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.460]  at the beginning of the brew.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.260]  So a lot of things are continuing to change.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.060]  And I think the more that some of us understand soil
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:38.260]  or can pick a brain such as yourself, Leighton and Quinn,
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.940]  there's just better ways to achieve diversity
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:44.180]  than probably what used to be seen
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.340]  as kind of like the playbook.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.900]  You know, it's funny you should say that
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.940]  because when I was working under Elaine,
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.420]  she had all these different recipes, right?
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.500]  Like, oh, you gotta add kelp, you gotta add fish hydrolysis,
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.380]  you gotta do this, you gotta do that.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.300]  So I started playing with all of them
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.940]  and timing them out over periods of time,
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:07.820]  you know, whether it was 30 hours, 36 hours, 25 hours,
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.860]  whatever it was to see what was really going on.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.620]  After freaking years of doing this,
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.320]  I ended up going back to just blackstrap molasses,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.780]  that's it, brew it out 30 hours,
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.700]  I get incredible results every freaking single time,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.280]  again, in a responsible temperature environment.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  And then if I wanna add hydrolysate
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.240]  or if I wanna add feather meal or kelp or anything else,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.280]  just add it in right before application and then apply it,
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.080]  you're gonna get both the bulk
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.360]  from these other important components,
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.840]  but you're not gonna affect the biology
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.600]  because you will knock back diversity
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.040]  as you add these things in
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.800]  and let them stay in the water column
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.160]  for long periods of time, you change it.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.000]  And so there was a comment about screens,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.160]  dude, play with it, yeah, I did it, I tried everything,
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.880]  go for it, it can't hurt,
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.960]  but the problem is you gotta be diligent
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.560]  in cleaning your shit after,
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.920]  because if you don't clean it,
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:09.500]  that biofilm is going to support anaerobic organisms
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.720]  that you do not want in your column
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.240]  because they're again going to knock back your diversity.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.320]  So again, I'm encouraging people to try everything
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.540]  that they possibly can think of,
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.560]  but understand that you're gonna be
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.680]  that place called cleansing this is next to godliness,
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.960]  because you're trying to be God,
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.120]  you're trying to grow out biology.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.800]  So you really have to be clean, thorough and responsible
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.840]  and not get stoned and forget.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.720]  Yeah, almost like a, like close to OCD with it,
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.040]  like cleanliness has gotta be paramount.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.240]  I remember helping an individual
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.600]  where he just didn't have the work ethic.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.240]  So I helped him build up his tea,
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.320]  came back a week later and he'd sprayed it,
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.240]  just a few hours before I showed up
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.920]  and his plants looked ridiculous.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.920]  The whole house smelled like sewage.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.760]  So obviously, I'm sure most of you know
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.280]  that if it smells rank,
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.040]  like don't obviously don't spray that on your plants.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.760]  Like that's a throwaway, you need to start over.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.920]  But some people, I don't know, man,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.840]  they miss the boat with common sense sometimes
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.680]  with some of that stuff.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.200]  So if you were brewing something and it's gone,
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.320]  like five days or something, you forgot about it,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.960]  in my opinion, I would just throw that away.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.080]  Or yeah, just kind of maybe dump it outside or something.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.400]  But I definitely wouldn't be using that
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.400]  in a facility where I'm growing stuff to make money.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.400]  Yeah, you can dilute it and use it as a foundation
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.840]  for turning dirt into soil.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.400]  I've had tremendous luck using facultative anaerobes
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.240]  or oxygen tolerant anaerobes, and that's what you've got.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.080]  If it smells funky, well, I shouldn't say funky
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.680]  because fermenting, like if you take kelp
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.700]  and you ferment it in a bucket of water for five days,
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.300]  you get this funky smell.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.240]  It doesn't smell like shit,
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.560]  but it's something that your nose doesn't recognize.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.840]  So your body kind of goes,
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.060]  well, what the fuck is that shit, right?
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.720]  But if you scope that, oh my God, it's amazing.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.880]  But it smells funky.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:18.920]  It kind of smells musty, musky kind of,
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.880]  but it doesn't smell like shit.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.280]  Now, if it smells like shit and you did go all the way
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.560]  anaerobic and you're filled with ciliates,
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.160]  throw that on compacted soil.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.960]  It'll work great to start stimulating the existing biology,
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.800]  aerobic biology in some ways.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.340]  That's a good way to use up your lessons.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.180]  Ha ha ha.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.480]  Nice.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.040]  You guys want to kind of quickly,
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.960]  now I think a lot of individuals know
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.120]  if like three, four and five,
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.360]  you kind of want to just briefly talk about that, Quinn,
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.320]  and then we can kind of get more into
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.920]  building up living soil systems.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.640]  That's something else that I feel like
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.000]  you are extremely knowledgeable on.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.720]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.720]  So yeah, so three is basically growing out your culture
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.040]  and four is kind of like throwing a mixer.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.400]  This is my soil microbes.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.280]  They're going to hang out with my new IMO microbes.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.900]  So three is I keep it really simple.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.500]  Just half my weight wood to grain.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.980]  And I like Rice Bran.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.880]  It's pretty aggressive.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.960]  If you want to cut it 50-50 with something else, you can,
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.740]  but Chris has told me multiple times Rice Bran has fats
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.400]  that these other grains don't have.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.280]  And you need those fats to get the extreme fungal count
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280]  that we want.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.680]  So you can ignore him if you want,
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.720]  but that's the information that I have.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.640]  But if you want to cut it 50-50 with some oats,
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.760]  slow it down, you can.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.320]  Wheat is so heavy with glyphosate.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.280]  I really recommend staying away from wheat.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.900]  The problem with oats is they'll say they're one thing,
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.240]  but they're often not what they say they are.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.240]  Meaning crimped might be whole and rolled might be crimped
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.780]  and crimped might not be crimped very well
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.500]  and need to be tripled past.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.900]  So get your hands on the oats
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.820]  and see if there's exposed hull.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.500]  Like you really want them broken up.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.920]  You want exposed meat material, not just that hard,
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.400]  teardrop pin shaped shell,
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.340]  because that can actually create a lot of anaerobic pockets
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.120]  and lacks the ability to get hydrated.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.060]  So yeah, sometimes think about it in a mechanical sense,
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.540]  not just in a, oh, chemistry, oh, fat.
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.700]  Like what's going to hold water the way I want?
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.620]  What's going to be the texture of the way I want?
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.220]  What's going to fluff the way I want?
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.580]  What's going to move?
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.580]  What can I mix well?
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.100]  You're going to do a lot of mechanical work.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.060]  So think about the mechanical components,
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.940]  where you're mixing, what you're inside of.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.980]  Don't let your ground underneath your pile get soggy.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.800]  I've done that a lot.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.040]  A lot of people do that.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.100]  That is just a, that's a day ruiner.
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.740]  There's no coming back from that.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.460]  You either have to be able to move to a whole new location
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.640]  and then you still probably miss most of your moisture.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.060]  So I really like to mix in a secondary vessel
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.900]  and then make a wheelbarrow and then return back
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.900]  to my actual fermentation location, if you will.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:15.580]  Yeah, that's, yeah.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.980]  Can you expand on that a little bit more?
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.540]  Because I think this is really, really important.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.580]  So just kind of reiterate what you were doing.
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.460]  You said you blend it and then you bring in a wheelbarrow
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.700]  of something else to slow it down,
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.660]  to get the moisture level right.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.900]  Like really get started.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.300]  So I do a lot of my, I'm in a really cold climate.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.660]  So I do a lot of my collections inside in a cedar box
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.480]  that I built from scratch in my cellar.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.360]  And when you're doing something like that,
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.740]  you can't just move to a new location.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.660]  You're in that box.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:56.140]  And this is true for anybody that has a designated location
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.580]  and where they want to make their IMO three or four,
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.420]  whether that's outside or inside.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.700]  Once the wood in my box gets saturated
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.740]  or the ground that you're working on is saturated,
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.940]  the pile, how dry or wet it doesn't even matter
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.600]  because they can access all the water under the pile.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.740]  And it's indefinitely gonna just kick
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.700]  your whole temperature way out of proportion.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.420]  So what I like to do is I'll either take my box
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.060]  and I'll line it with a tarp.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.780]  So when I'm putting everything and hydrating everything,
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.140]  there's a tarp underneath it.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.940]  And I can actually get all the moisture into the pile
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.700]  and mix it for a half an hour.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.020]  Then I'll pull the tarp out from underneath.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.980]  And now everything is right where I want it
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.780]  on my box or my location.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.660]  You can also shovel everything up into a wheelbarrow.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:44.700]  You can put it in totes and hydrate things in vessels
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.340]  and in containers that hold moisture,
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.940]  not that drain and breathe and steal moisture
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.540]  and then move to your final location.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.440]  With these smaller boutique piles, I think it really helps.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.960]  You can certainly do it the other way,
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.160]  but you need a sprayer, you need to go slow.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.560]  A lot of things get hydrophobic and the water,
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.280]  especially when you're going from three to four,
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.160]  your starting material for IMO four
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.040]  is gonna be mostly hydrophobic.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.760]  All IMO three when it's completed well is hydrophobic.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.120]  So you're gonna wet it and all the water
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.240]  is gonna run right off it.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.160]  And it's gonna just sit on the ground
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.200]  or the bottom of whatever you're doing.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200]  And that's gonna give you a lot of trouble
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.120]  and you're probably not gonna be able
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.060]  to come back from that.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.260]  It's really hard to come back from that
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.700]  unless you can move the pile.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:32.900]  And even if you can move the pile,
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.900]  you just put all your nutrient solution
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.500]  that you spent all that time making,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.700]  your humic acid, your FPJ, your brown rice vinegar,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:43.380]  your OHN, your salt water, that's now all on the ground.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.380]  And you have to move to a new location
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.620]  with no nutrient solution.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.580]  So yeah, that's just like something
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.840]  that I've run into a bunch.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.040]  I've seen a lot of people do.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.620]  I've done wrong on more than one occasion.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.080]  But a pump sprayer can really help with that.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  You can slowly apply and mix.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.880]  And that's a perfectly acceptable way to do it
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.480]  with bigger piles.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.240]  Maybe get things wet a little bit
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.800]  and then start dumping water on it.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.080]  Don't dump all your water
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.420]  because it's not gonna stick to your pile.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.080]  So basically what you're doing is rehydrating it.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.520]  And dude, I'm so glad we're having this conversation
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.080]  because this is another part of the process
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.000]  that most people have failed it
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.200]  because they don't understand.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.120]  When it's hydrophobic, it's a bitch to get it back
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.240]  to the point where it's gonna start accepting moisture.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.280]  And if you get too much moisture,
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:33.000]  you're gonna be flipping that pile every three hours
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.120]  to try to keep up with it so that it doesn't go frigging,
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.460]  you know, completely thermophilic on you.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.920]  And if it goes over 120, you're losing diversity
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.080]  really, really quickly.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.800]  So that was some really big gold bars,
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.440]  dump trucks loaded of gold, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.100]  And in understanding how to transition two into three,
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.160]  it is not for the lighthearted.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.420]  And you know, temperature is everything.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.460]  And these things can, they can go fucking ballistic on you,
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.300]  out of control.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:07.540]  And if you don't rehydrate before you try to actually water
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:10.620]  it with your nutrients, like you said, they're gone.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.140]  They're just gonna blow right through it.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.260]  They'll be trapped in the bottom.
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.580]  The bottom will go anaerobic.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.940]  And like you said, now it's throw away and redo.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:20.460]  And that's a lot of work that you went through
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.320]  to get to that point to do the IMO three.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.160]  So you, again, have to be really thorough.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.320]  You gotta use your common sense, gotta take your time
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:32.120]  and do these steps, follow these steps
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.520]  so that you don't have a failure or a lesson, a hard lesson.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.080]  Yeah, Quint, that explanation, man,
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.160]  I think you might've created a new bar on here.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.860]  I would consider that almost like Jay-Z bars
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.000]  cause it was off the top of your head, almost freestylist.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.880]  And I think it's a classic, man.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.720]  People are gonna be rewinding that over and over again
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.960]  because that's another step in this process
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.800]  where especially at the beginning
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.080]  where a lot of individuals make a lot of mistakes.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.880]  So now you got gold bars, you got trucks latent
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.200]  and now Quint's created the Jay-Z bars
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.840]  which I hope other people will bring to the show
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.000]  when it's straight off the head freestyle.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.960]  And it's Ken approved.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:18.960]  No, that was really important.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160]  That was really important.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.480]  And again, these nuances that people don't really
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.060]  either get them or take the time to understand them.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.780]  And that's why I made you rewind that
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.560]  because that had to be beaten into their heads.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.160]  So thank you for sharing that at Jay-Z and at freestyle.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  All right, so you know what, before we go on
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  let's give the audience a chance to ask questions
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.280]  on either collections or IMO3s.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.560]  Go ahead, Quint.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.600]  Can we do five?
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.440]  We should do some five.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.200]  Well, we gotta go four first, right?
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.680]  Okay, so four questions.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.880]  And then I wanna talk about IMO5 a little bit
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.840]  cause there's a lot of misunderstanding.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.320]  We'll go into four and then five.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.240]  So if there's any questions asked now
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.960]  and if there aren't, let's go ahead
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.000]  and start talking about IMO4
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.280]  because this is another one that's so important.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.080]  And it's so similar from three.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.140]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.460]  Just remember it's by weight.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.180]  Soil is a lot heavier than wood chips and rice bran.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.260]  I know the first time I did it, I thought it was by volume.
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:28.580]  I just did two buckets of this and two buckets of that.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:31.540]  And it's the density of your soil.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:34.220]  Soil is so much more dense than wood chip and grain
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.440]  that it's gonna be more temperamental
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.660]  and the temperatures are gonna be more aggressive.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:43.460]  So just really have your foot on the brake, not on the gas.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.260]  Like maybe a little less moisture.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.380]  Just go a little slower
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.900]  cause you've already got the three.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.820]  You already did it.
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.100]  You just need to not fuck it up.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.600]  Like you don't need to do anything crazy.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.180]  You just need to get these microbes to hang out together
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.180]  and all the protozoa and all the nematode
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.420]  to meet all the fungi and be like, oh, hey, we're all buddies
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.220]  and then you can, then you win, you win the whole game.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.780]  So just go really slow.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.920]  And the density that you're changing
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.060]  of the pile makes a really big difference.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.380]  IMO4 can be really aggressive
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.340]  because like I have clay on my property.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.060]  So there's a ton of clay in my pile.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.180]  So the density and the air exchange is super duper low
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.680]  because the density is so high
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.540]  and the ability to hold thermal mass is way greater too.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.980]  All these variables, there's probably a ton more.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:30.800]  I don't even have the ability to understand.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.300]  But yeah, just go really slow with your four.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.060]  If your three went well and it's gonna parallel.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.900]  If your three was a handful and it was like,
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.420]  who I had to turn it all the time,
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.940]  your four is probably gonna be a little worse.
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:44.600]  So you should already know what you're in for
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.100]  going from three to four.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:50.320]  And I encourage you to go twice as dry
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.720]  as you think you should go.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.200]  However much water you think you should put on it,
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.640]  that's definitely the wrong amount.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.520]  Definitely do half as much as that.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.760]  You should barely even think it's wet.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.060]  You should be like, that's not wet,
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.960]  but technically it's not dry.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.080]  That's the correct amount.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.720]  Like just not dry, not even really wet,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.840]  but just where you're like, I guess this isn't dry anymore.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.080]  That's a good amount of moisture to start with
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.600]  because it's easier to stack your pile up higher
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.960]  than it is to do anything else.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.200]  I've left IMOs in the box and just forgot to put them away.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.280]  And I was just working out of my brew box
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:30.320]  for the whole season and mud season came.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.440]  So it gets rid, my basement is just,
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.640]  it's just a cellar, it's just gravel floor.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.680]  And it kind of will, it'll get wet, like not flood,
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.680]  but it'll hold a lot of moisture during mud season
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.660]  because the ground thaws and it pushes all the moisture
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.980]  out of the ground when the frost line is still frozen,
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.460]  all the water above it just kind of just starts seeping out
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.140]  because it reversed thaws, right?
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:51.040]  That's how a deep freeze works.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:56.260]  And just the humidity in the region of the pile,
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:59.000]  we'll turn the pile back on to full temperature,
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.340]  running away 120, 130 degrees.
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:05.980]  So just ambient moisture in the humidity in the air,
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.660]  the pile can turn on and kick off.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.860]  So you really don't need a lot of moisture.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.820]  You just need to not deprive them of moisture
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:16.220]  and they will do everything they need to do.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:19.660]  Damn, that couldn't have been more better said.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.860]  And like you said, clay.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:22.860]  So what is soil?
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:24.340]  Sand, silt, clay and organic matter.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.220]  What holds moisture?
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:30.020]  Organic matter and clay and silt to some degree.
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.180]  So you have three out of those four components
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.860]  that hold moisture.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.300]  So by doing just a little tiny bit,
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.540]  you're protecting yourself from the thing
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.340]  going completely sideways.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.660]  And then the moisture rolls in, a little fog comes in.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.220]  You get a really cool night and you get the humidity
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:49.820]  or the condensation in the morning.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:52.920]  Bam, you're back off to the goddamn races.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.020]  So let's back up and answer this question.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.260]  Can you see that there, Quinn?
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.780]  So you keep your IMO3 pile on pallets
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:01.980]  so that it's off the ground.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.460]  I fear the hard rain drowning my pile.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.620]  So it depends on what region you're in.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.500]  If you're in a dry desert region, do whatever you want.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.100]  Ideally on the ground is always best.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.860]  I do my piles inside, when I do my piles inside,
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.980]  which is usually, I do them in a cedar box
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.860]  that's raised off the ground that I built.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.180]  It's aerated, that has space between all the slats,
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.500]  just like my IMO box, so that it can breathe
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.820]  and pass gas and aerate.
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:34.540]  So if you can be on the ground,
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.780]  you should always be on the ground.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:37.860]  So you should always be on the ground
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.700]  when you can be on the ground,
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.420]  and you should never be on a surface
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.100]  that will create anaerobic conditions.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:45.220]  Never on concrete, never on rubber, never on plastic.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.740]  Absolutely never, ever.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:50.860]  I made a pile, the first pile I made, I made it on,
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.060]  what was it, it was like a sheet of plywood or something.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.220]  Terrible, like terrible.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.180]  The plywood was turned into Windex, whole thing ammonia.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.220]  So you really need to be on a breathable, natural surface.
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:07.760]  So wood is your best option that isn't correct.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.340]  Your correct option is the ground.
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:11.520]  So always start there, and if you can't,
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.340]  if you can't make that work for your farm,
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.080]  then move to like a raised wood, cedar ideally.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.420]  You could do pine.
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:19.900]  I really would stay away from plywood.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.580]  There's a ton of glue, and it's not actually,
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.300]  it has the ability to breathe.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:29.380]  It has the ability to exchange water and oxygen,
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.000]  but you don't actually have airflow.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.820]  You want something that has physical airflow,
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.180]  if it's not the ground, in my opinion.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.540]  So a slatted box is a good thing to do.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.540]  I hope that helps answer your question.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.860]  Get an EZ-Up, just cover, just buy an EZ-Up
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.980]  and cover your whole area.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.220]  So when rain comes, you're not in,
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.540]  you don't have any danger to worry about.
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.900]  The ground is good, and dig a boat around your EZ-Up.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.940]  So when it rains, it doesn't flood your pile anyway,
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:00.300]  because that's, Chris has this crazy story
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:03.700]  where he was making, he was making like 50 yards.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.700]  Like he had like a long four by two pile
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.980]  that was like, I don't know what it was.
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.580]  It was like, you'd have to ask him.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:12.940]  It was at least 40 feet long, multiple EZ-Ups.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.540]  And he was like, well, we're under EZ-Ups, we're good.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:17.700]  And it started raining, and the water just came down the hill
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.500]  and just started running into his pile,
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.620]  because it doesn't matter if it's covered.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.860]  If you're in the evacuation plan of the water,
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.160]  you're still in just as much trouble.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.880]  So dig yourself a little moat.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.400]  Yeah, you don't want added moisture.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.200]  So ground and a roof is kind of the two main things.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.040]  And we could talk indoor boxes,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.880]  but that's like a separate thing.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.600]  If you don't have to, I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.680]  And another thing that wasn't mentioned,
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.760]  which is really important, is you are trying
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.480]  to capture the indigenous organisms
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.760]  that live in the soil that you're building on.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.680]  So you don't want separation.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.720]  You want to be building on soil.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.760]  And plus, that's going to give you a little bit more
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.480]  of a buffer, because the soil has the ability
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.920]  to exchange gas and hold moisture a little bit.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.700]  It also has the ability to pull moisture back
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.160]  if you are overwet.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:13.640]  So it really just gives you a little bit more of a buffer
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.400]  than any of these other substrates.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.560]  So just keep that in mind.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.400]  But dude, Quinn, you're fucking knocking them
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.520]  out of the park today, brother.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.960]  Thank you for this.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:21.800]  Thanks, man.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.680]  Oh shit, you got Johnny asking you a question, brother.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.800]  Oh, here we go.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.400]  Mr. San Diego in the house, dude.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.720]  What's up, Johnny?
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.960]  Okay, so there's a few things here.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.600]  So yeah, so I'm a for indoor.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.680]  I mean, you're already doing it.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.500]  I already seen you.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.880]  We talked a while back.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.200]  You were crushing it.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.100]  So we got a few pieces here to this puzzle.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.940]  So I like to build that big cedar box.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.900]  And if you have a big, relatively slatted,
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:59.900]  breathable wooden box, you can definitely have a lot of fun
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.580]  building piles in there and just going normal recipe
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.400]  after that.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.560]  I like to use a burlap cloth as my top layer
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.420]  rather than like straw or hay,
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.060]  just because it's easier for me.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.580]  I'm not saying that it's better.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.340]  There are disadvantages to burlap,
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.220]  but I think the burlap that I get from my local store
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.980]  is, it works well and it's what I like.
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:28.620]  So when you're talking about building like one out of Pete
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:31.060]  and, oh, I'm an indoor grower.
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.180]  So I want to use indoor things.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.360]  It doesn't really work like that.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.500]  You do definitely want,
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.060]  I like to do two handfuls of peat moss,
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.900]  two handfuls of worm castings
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.500]  and two handfuls of whatever is in my beds,
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:46.560]  whatever my potting mix, soil mix is.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.540]  And I'm still doing over half,
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.640]  living soil from outside.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.300]  So I'm still, no matter where I plan on using this IMO4,
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:35:01.140]  I'm still using more than 50% of my total soil weight
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:04.100]  is still coming from outside, definitely,
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:05.420]  if not more than 50%.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:10.420]  So you could say it's 50% IMO3,
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:16.220]  50% IMO3 to, let's say 30% outdoor soil
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:25.380]  to 10%, maybe even like 5% peat,
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.660]  5% worm castings, 10% soil potting mix, right?
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.340]  Whatever your container,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.600]  whatever your preferred container mix is,
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.580]  whether that's like a scoop of horizon or whatever,
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.060]  your microbes are gonna be playing in.
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.060]  And that's something that I've talked to Chris about
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.300]  and he really likes that as a good train of thought
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:52.060]  for something that's gonna be growing inside,
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:52.900]  which is a little different
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:54.820]  than just making your IMO inside,
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:56.660]  but I feel like those two are connected.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.700]  So I kind of extrapolated over to the other one.
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.260]  I hope that helps, Johnny.
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.100]  Oh, that does.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:02.920]  That's amazing.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:06.820]  And again, you guys, this is by weight, not by volume.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:07.940]  So just be careful
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:10.700]  when you start bringing in other materials
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:13.460]  that weigh more, like the peat moss doesn't weigh anything,
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.180]  the worm casting, a little bit heavy,
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.700]  but that soil is very heavy.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.000]  So just be careful and follow the recipes,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.440]  but again, a wonderful gold bar.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.020]  Now, here's another one for you.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:30.460]  Did you, can you expand on why IMO3 is hydrophobic?
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.300]  And it seems to me that it should not be the case
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.780]  if you'd have established a significant amount of fungi.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.980]  If you can't handle this one, I'll fucking rip it up.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:41.100]  But I wanna hear your opinion first.
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:42.380]  No, that's a really good point.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.220]  Like fungi do have kind of like mycelium itself.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:49.400]  I feel like it's a little different of a feel,
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.780]  like all that crystallization
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.260]  on the outside of their structure.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:54.100]  I feel like it does take water better,
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:58.020]  but my main point is just the biology has such a need
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:01.660]  and a aggressive desire to grab every bit of moisture
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:04.240]  that it can and hold onto it with all of its might.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.420]  It's like generally its whole life goal
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.580]  is to find water and keep it, right?
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.820]  So as soon as water becomes scarce,
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.820]  the microbes fill themselves with water, all the water,
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.460]  every single drop of water in that atmosphere
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.220]  is gonna be inside the microbes.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.420]  And that's why our plants are gonna be more drought resistant
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.400]  because the microbes can slowly exchange that water
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.380]  with the plants.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:27.140]  So it's not that there isn't water maybe in the pile,
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.820]  it's that the microbes have it all
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:32.100]  and they have 100% of the available water.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.620]  But I cannot handle this question
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:38.980]  as to how different microorganisms
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:41.140]  may be more or less hydrophobic.
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.700]  I don't even have a two cents on that.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.400]  You should let me know what's up.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:50.400]  All right, so basically bacteria create biofilm,
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.180]  we all know that.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:54.340]  They do that for a couple of reasons.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.700]  First to protect themselves, give them a substrate,
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:01.700]  to divide and grow out more, also to hold some nutrients.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.100]  And more importantly, hold moisture.
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:09.100]  So when that biofilm comes under threat,
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.140]  the microbes actually do what's called going into cysts.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.780]  And basically what they've done is they've created
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.260]  a wax coating around the outside of them
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.020]  that sheds water but prevents any kind of ability
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.700]  for the environment to pull the moisture out of them.
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.820]  Just like what Quinn was saying,
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.660]  they steal everything they can and hold it inside of them.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:33.100]  So typically in cannabis cultivation,
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.780]  in what we call soilless medium,
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:39.340]  the cultivators will often have times difficulty watering,
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.060]  where you pour water on the pot
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:44.380]  and it literally just runs across the top and down the sides.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.060]  Now that's called hydrophobic.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:48.340]  And once things go hydrophobic,
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:51.700]  it's very difficult to get water to penetrate.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.900]  And the reason why that water ran off
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.580]  was because all of the bacteria
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:58.940]  that were coated all over that stuff insisted,
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.940]  and then now the water can't penetrate.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.660]  So that's why you have to rehydrate.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.020]  Rehydrating means soaking.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:11.020]  A lot of the IMO3 collections are dust.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.340]  They're dry as hell.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:15.420]  And again, it's not because you have fruiting bodies,
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.420]  you don't have mushrooms, you don't have mycelium yet.
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.820]  It's not there yet.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.020]  What you have is you have organisms
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:25.200]  that are going to be sporulating.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.600]  So there again, they're not very high in moisture value
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.080]  because they're basically in a cyst
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.560]  until they pop and release the spores.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.160]  And even the spores themselves
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.480]  are not holding a tremendous amount of moisture.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.060]  They're holding the bud of life
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.120]  that when it comes in contact with moisture,
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.400]  begins to grow, begins to fruit, begins to create hyphae,
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.880]  begins to again, breed out.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:53.240]  So the problem is, is that when you have something
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.800]  that's extremely hydrophobic,
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:59.760]  you've got to slowly introduce moisture to it
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.120]  to bring it out of in cyst form,
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:06.520]  to bring the moisture level back up inside of the pieces,
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.200]  inside of the organisms, inside of the wood chips,
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.960]  because those wood chips have soaked it up
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.700]  and it's not gonna be easily released.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.160]  And if the wood chips were soaking wet,
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.720]  now your pile would go thermophilic,
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.320]  out of control in a heartbeat.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.200]  So IMO3s are very, very dry and take time to rehydrate,
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.280]  which is why it's so important to use moist
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.320]  or at least soil that will stick together
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.080]  when you squeeze it.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.880]  Like you don't wanna use something that if you squeeze it,
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.400]  it just goes back to dust.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.560]  I mean, that's dirt.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.200]  You're looking for soil.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:47.200]  And in the work that I've done in IMO4 creation,
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:50.640]  you're looking for something that is not disturbed,
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.520]  something that is well aggregated.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.920]  So aggregates mean when you pull up the plant,
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.520]  there's a huge clump of soil
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.600]  and all these clods hanging off of it.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.520]  That's well aggregated soil.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.520]  If it's well aggregated,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.160]  you know you're gonna get the protozoa, the nematodes,
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.040]  the fungi, the diversity that you're really looking for.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.200]  So again, if you're adding some kind of soil to your IMO3,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.240]  you wanna get as clean a soil
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.840]  that is well-formed as possible to mix it.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.540]  So I kind of went off on a little bit of a tear there,
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.640]  but I wanted to remind people
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:26.760]  that common sense is you're gonna be your best friend
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.120]  and intuition is gonna be your best friend.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.960]  So get in touch with yourself.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.880]  But when you're going out to collect the soil
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.200]  to add to your IMO3,
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.680]  make sure that you're getting something
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.320]  that has some diversity
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:41.320]  and it's not just dust in your hand
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.960]  because you're just not gonna get where you wanna go.
[01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:49.470]  Using castings in IMO4, sure.
[01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.670]  Hell yeah, diversity, diversity, diversity.
[01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:55.470]  Did you wanna bang on anything, Brian?
[01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:57.590]  Oh, I was just gonna say, yeah, worm castings,
[01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:59.870]  that's, I mean, there's really, in my opinion,
[01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:03.190]  really nothing better than when you're mixing that with IMO,
[01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.390]  especially when you're playing around
[01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.410]  with a variety of different IMOs.
[01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:09.590]  That's, to me, this is next level,
[01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:12.510]  next level experimentation and thinking,
[01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:14.350]  especially if you're newer to this,
[01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:17.230]  being able to kind of start from the beginning
[01:42:17.230 --> 01:42:19.830]  and know that you need a variety of different sources,
[01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:20.810]  not just one.
[01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:24.630]  Yeah, like one of the thought patterns is like,
[01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:28.030]  all my beds have worms in them and I use worm castings.
[01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:29.670]  So it's like, it's not so much
[01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:31.830]  that worm castings are the perfect answer,
[01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:34.670]  which they probably are because they're in nature.
[01:42:34.670 --> 01:42:37.390]  So it's not like anything nature isn't, you know,
[01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:40.350]  all your living soil that you would have stole from outside
[01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:42.370]  would probably have worm castings in it anyway.
[01:42:42.370 --> 01:42:43.670]  But also I know that the environment
[01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:47.230]  that they're gonna go into is worm casting dominated.
[01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.350]  That's one of the reasons that I'm using worm castings.
[01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:51.830]  So if you're using, you know,
[01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:55.050]  biocomplete compost and insect frass,
[01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:56.270]  maybe don't use worm castings,
[01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.870]  maybe use biocomplete, you know,
[01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:00.510]  compost and insect frass.
[01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:02.050]  So tailor it.
[01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:04.650]  I'm kind of giving you a recipe to tailor to your system.
[01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:06.610]  I'm not saying this is the only way to do it,
[01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:10.010]  but you know, it's more chunks and extrapolation
[01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:11.870]  of what I use in my system
[01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:14.430]  and how I paralleled that in my IMO for,
[01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:17.230]  but never cut out that outdoor component no matter what.
[01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:21.270]  Yeah, that outdoor component is the key.
[01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:23.190]  And again, people, diversity, right?
[01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:26.470]  You can't hurt to be adding some castings in as well.
[01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:28.910]  I wouldn't do it on gravel.
[01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:30.710]  I would do it on ground,
[01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:32.510]  because if you do it on gravel,
[01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:35.230]  you're gonna lose a lot of the material down into the gravel
[01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:36.750]  and never be able to get it back out.
[01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:39.510]  So, and again, gravel doesn't hold moisture.
[01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:41.910]  It's probably gonna let a lot of air in there
[01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:46.150]  that could dehydrate or actually condensate.
[01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:48.950]  You just, you know, it could go either way on gravel.
[01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:52.570]  So well-draining soil, healthy soil would be ideal.
[01:43:54.190 --> 01:43:55.710]  There was another question out there.
[01:43:55.710 --> 01:43:56.630]  All right, here we go.
[01:43:56.630 --> 01:44:01.630]  What is the smallest you would make an IMO box?
[01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:05.570]  Yeah, so yeah, if you're talking about,
[01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:08.590]  I assume you're talking about like an IMO three
[01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:09.870]  or four brew box,
[01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:14.350]  or are you talking about an IMO one collection box?
[01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:15.310]  I'm assuming you're talking about-
[01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:16.430]  I think collection box.
[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:18.310]  I think they're talking about the collection box
[01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:20.030]  because it was a question from earlier.
[01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:24.190]  So how small could you actually make an IMO box
[01:44:24.190 --> 01:44:26.310]  to be able to do a collection?
[01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:27.850]  I have no idea.
[01:44:27.850 --> 01:44:31.110]  I don't know that there's a limit to how small.
[01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:31.950]  I think-
[01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:33.790]  The smallest one I did was this small,
[01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:35.650]  and it was just a little cardboard.
[01:44:35.650 --> 01:44:38.950]  It was no more than three quarters of an inch tall.
[01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:40.830]  I had to make, it was difficult to make sure
[01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:43.710]  that I ended up getting airspace on the top of it,
[01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.710]  but it worked fine.
[01:44:44.710 --> 01:44:47.230]  So size doesn't matter.
[01:44:47.230 --> 01:44:50.270]  Oh boy, did I go on?
[01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:51.390]  I'm not going there.
[01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:52.530]  I'm not going there.
[01:44:52.530 --> 01:44:53.370]  I'm not.
[01:44:56.170 --> 01:44:57.630]  But anyway, so yeah,
[01:44:57.630 --> 01:45:01.030]  but you're not introducing your IMO collection
[01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:02.430]  into your pot, dude.
[01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:03.790]  You got to grow it out.
[01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:06.150]  You got to turn it into IMO two to stabilize it,
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:07.590]  IMO three to grow it out,
[01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:10.530]  and then IMO four before you add it into your soil,
[01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:14.090]  or you can make a liquid IMO three and apply it that way.
[01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:16.730]  But generally it's going to be way better
[01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:18.570]  if you're making an IMO four
[01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:21.050]  and then use that as a top dress.
[01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.890]  What's that?
[01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:22.810]  What do you got there, Bri?
[01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:23.650]  Nice.
[01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:28.610]  IMO two collection that gentleman Ryan gave me on Sunday,
[01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:31.090]  but I was just kind of showing people how,
[01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:33.210]  I mean, you just need a little tiny bit
[01:45:33.210 --> 01:45:34.370]  once you've made this stuff.
[01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:36.370]  Now I get to go and play with this,
[01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:39.410]  and he's basically given me time, obviously.
[01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:41.770]  So two locations, one in a rainy area,
[01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:45.810]  summer rain of last year,
[01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:49.330]  and then this is in Carr, Colorado during the summer
[01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:50.610]  and a dry season.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.920]  I don't know if you could.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.280]  Just kind of wanted to show
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.720]  if newer individuals are seeing this,
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.040]  I mean, you don't necessarily need a ton of this.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.900]  So even if you're in an apartment
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.080]  or you have a small little tent grow,
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.480]  it's still time to play around with IMOs.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:10.800]  Yeah, like that's enough for a hundred pound pile.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.440]  I was gonna say, dude, we need to talk about that
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.760]  because people don't understand how potent that stuff is.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.960]  So please expand on that, Clint.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.280]  So I don't have real numbers,
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.200]  but like, I mean, you think about how many
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.480]  sporulating heads, how many colonies
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.400]  of microorganisms are in there.
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:34.960]  I usually go really overkill and I might use like two cups.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.400]  I have like over 20 collections.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.840]  So if I take a little bit of this
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.040]  and a little bit of that, a little bit of that,
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.960]  and that's like, okay, I might use three cups of IMO too.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.000]  But that's just because I'm trying to get some of everything.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.240]  A couple tablespoons is really all you need
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.360]  to inoculate hundreds of pounds.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.720]  I mean, easily two tablespoons,
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.120]  I would say is enough for a hundred pounds.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.920]  And that's like your minimum, definitely for sure,
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.200]  maybe starting point.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.440]  If you have to try less, you could,
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.760]  but you can certainly do a little more,
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.360]  but this isn't like, you're not dumping your whole jar.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.480]  You know, like you get a jar, a half gallon Mason jar,
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.160]  halfway full of IMO two,
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.840]  like that should last you for a decade, you know?
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.160]  Thank you.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.080]  And again, you don't need to be a moron.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.360]  All right, so I think we're okay
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.200]  to start venturing into IMO five,
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.080]  unless there's some more questions.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.920]  Could I hit the restroom before we do IMO five?
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.800]  Is that okay?
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:38.480]  You know what?
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.320]  IMO 12.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.720]  I'm gonna do the same thing.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.000]  I'll be right back.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:42.840]  Perfect.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.880]  Ken, you wanna talk to me?
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.560]  All right, there we go.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.800]  I don't know, I think-
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.280]  Well, I can't sing or anything,
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.440]  or I'm not very good at telling jokes.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.720]  So there's not too much I can do to stall.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.760]  Oh yeah, it's not a problem.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.560]  I'm sure we can figure out something.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.640]  I know that everybody was driven major love to Leighton
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.280]  for the horizontal soil system earlier.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.880]  I'm playing around with that in my fish tank isopods,
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:16.840]  just adding a variety of different things.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.920]  And then having the lava rock on the bottom,
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.280]  I've already seen improvements
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.640]  just with the oxygen levels for the compost and worms.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.560]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.040]  And you realize when you're in aquaponics,
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.360]  I used to put worms in my aquaponics bed,
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.040]  and I would find them in my deep water culture
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.040]  living quite happily and chewing on the waste from the fish.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:42.600]  As long as you have enough oxygen in the water,
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.040]  the worms actually breathe through their skin basically,
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.800]  and it can survive in water
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.080]  as long as there's enough dissolved oxygen.
[01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:57.110]  Yeah, and you really don't wanna get to that point,
[01:48:57.110 --> 01:48:58.830]  but when you're first getting into this stuff,
[01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:01.990]  it's a way for your stuff not to go anaerobic.
[01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.830]  Yeah.
[01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:04.110]  And I hope to talk to Quinn a little bit more
[01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:05.390]  about the differences on that,
[01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:08.990]  just a few years ago, there were two roads, Ken.
[01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:11.030]  There's obviously the natural farming road,
[01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:13.270]  and then more of like the living soil road.
[01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:18.270]  And some people had a belief set in stone system on one camp,
[01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:20.510]  the other camp had a set system,
[01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:25.590]  mostly probably pertaining to like anaerobic aspects
[01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:28.550]  to nature.
[01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:31.470]  So I wanna be able to kind of later pick Quinn's brain
[01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:32.310]  on that kind of stuff,
[01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:35.230]  because I think from now, Chris, Trump,
[01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:38.230]  and Dr. Laningham have kind of, I don't know,
[01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:40.550]  maybe seen more eye to eye on some stuff,
[01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:43.510]  but at first there was definitely two sides of things.
[01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.870]  And so I just kinda learned,
[01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.270]  I think he would be more dialed in
[01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:48.110]  to answer those questions.
[01:49:48.110 --> 01:49:49.070]  Oh, definitely.
[01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:53.590]  And people get set in one rut,
[01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:55.790]  and they don't wanna look at anything else,
[01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:57.790]  and that's not the way to do it.
[01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:59.750]  It's the way to look at everything,
[01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:02.150]  and then bring it into your operation,
[01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.830]  because if you're an apartment,
[01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:04.750]  it's gonna be different than,
[01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:07.550]  you know, you're Mr. Marco out on the farm.
[01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:11.070]  It's all, you can use it all
[01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:15.230]  just for your perfect situation in your life.
[01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:16.390]  And I'll jump back out.
[01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:21.910]  All right, yeah, so let's chop it up into IMO 5,
[01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:22.990]  and then while you guys were gone,
[01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:25.390]  I was giving a little teaser
[01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.150]  for talking more with living soil.
[01:50:29.190 --> 01:50:30.510]  Cool.
[01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:31.670]  Yeah, so five.
[01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:36.270]  So I think a lot of people,
[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:37.550]  so it's tough, right?
[01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:39.830]  I mean, Chris is teaching,
[01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:41.670]  trying to teach guidelines
[01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:44.430]  for relatively entry-level stuff
[01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:46.950]  in a way that's approachable for everybody, right?
[01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:49.390]  And we all don't know anything,
[01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:51.870]  and you know, it's like Michael Jordan
[01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:53.630]  is trying to teach first graders basketball, right?
[01:50:53.630 --> 01:50:56.110]  Like it's like, we don't really even know
[01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:57.470]  how much we don't know, right?
[01:50:57.950 --> 01:51:02.590]  So IMO 5 got kind of pigeonholed into this like,
[01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:03.950]  oh, it's like this, right?
[01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:06.630]  Because IMO 3 and IMO 4, they're very strict.
[01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:10.990]  Like the discipline for them is strict, it's straightforward.
[01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:13.110]  There's one primary goal,
[01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:16.270]  and there's a general path to get there
[01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:18.190]  with some variables that you're trying to keep everything
[01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:19.870]  inside a certain parameter,
[01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:21.550]  being like, you want it to be warm.
[01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.430]  You don't want it to go over a certain temperature.
[01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:25.070]  You don't want it to be under a certain temperature.
[01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:26.350]  You want it to move steady.
[01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:28.470]  You want to look at the slope of the pile.
[01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:31.910]  So not just what is the temperature,
[01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:35.390]  but what is the curvature and the acceleration
[01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:36.990]  that temperature is changing?
[01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:41.390]  Because that actually tells you who has a hold of the pile.
[01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:43.430]  Like that tells you, oh, actinobacteria
[01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:45.710]  have a hold of this pile because it keeps jumping.
[01:51:45.710 --> 01:51:47.830]  And every time I turn it, I get this bell curve
[01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:49.790]  that's so sharp, it looks like it wants to go
[01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:51.550]  to a million degrees and light on fire.
[01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:56.270]  So some of that stuff is, there's a lot of variables,
[01:51:57.190 --> 01:51:58.030]  but you're still trying to do everything
[01:51:58.030 --> 01:52:00.310]  in one band of completion.
[01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:02.670]  And there is not a lot of objectives,
[01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:06.590]  even though there's a lot of pieces to allow you to adjust.
[01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:08.350]  So where IMO 5 gets different is,
[01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:12.590]  IMO 5 is a very flexible tool for the farmer
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:15.470]  to process whatever they have an abundance of,
[01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:19.030]  or look at whatever they need for their farm
[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:20.950]  and work backwards from that,
[01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:23.430]  or work forwards from what they have an abundance of.
[01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:28.910]  So you can do static IMO 5s that have almost no moisture
[01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:33.350]  and have either no or lots of carbon or nitrogen.
[01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:37.150]  So you have these linear scales of high carbon IMO 5
[01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:39.390]  to high nitrogen IMO 5.
[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:43.630]  You have high temperature to long static.
[01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:47.110]  So you can do thermodynamic and you can do static IMO 5s.
[01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:49.110]  Both of these are acceptable.
[01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:53.230]  You have a huge range of abilities
[01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:55.630]  to adjust sizes of piles.
[01:52:55.630 --> 01:52:57.650]  You could do it wet and short.
[01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:01.070]  You could do it dry and huge.
[01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:05.050]  And you can adjust how long the pile is gonna take you,
[01:53:05.050 --> 01:53:07.830]  how much labor it's gonna take you to process the pile.
[01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:11.070]  Like this can be extremely tailored
[01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:13.190]  for every farm individually.
[01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:18.190]  And people learn that IMO 5 is a tool
[01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:22.990]  of high nitrogen, it's a high nitrogen input with IMO 4.
[01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:26.670]  You mix them together, you're getting this high nitrogen
[01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:29.990]  IMO 5, which is so true, super amazing.
[01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:32.350]  One of the best things, absolute gem,
[01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:36.270]  but it's not the only way to utilize IMO 4
[01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:40.110]  in the next stage and process something with IMO 4
[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:42.750]  to a completed compost that can be applied directly
[01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:43.870]  to your plants.
[01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:48.030]  And by high nitrogen, you're talking manures, correct?
[01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:53.030]  Or greens or seaweed, even fresh wood.
[01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:55.590]  When you get fresh wood, it has a lot more nitrogen
[01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:57.750]  than like aged wood, right?
[01:53:57.750 --> 01:54:01.510]  So you can intentionally process fresher wood
[01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:05.330]  to swing your, to, oh, I want 30% nitrogen,
[01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:06.270]  add some grasses.
[01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:09.370]  Like you can take all of the thermodynamic,
[01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:14.950]  all of your thermophilic style,
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:18.310]  thermodynamic composting styles from Elaine Ingham
[01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:20.510]  and mix those with IMOs.
[01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:23.550]  Like you can do lasagna with IMO.
[01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:26.710]  Like there's this, IMO 5 is not as rigid
[01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:28.550]  of a discipline as the others.
[01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:30.670]  That's where the fun comes in.
[01:54:30.670 --> 01:54:32.230]  That's where the art comes in.
[01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:33.670]  That's where the, what do I have?
[01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:34.510]  What do I want?
[01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:35.330]  What do I need?
[01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:37.030]  Because you still have a giant pile of IMO 4.
[01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:39.630]  So you're not asking for IMO 5 to be your inoculum.
[01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:42.130]  You're still gonna inoculate with IMO 4.
[01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:43.790]  You're always gonna have IMO 4.
[01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:45.790]  IMO 5 doesn't replace IMO 4, right?
[01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:47.350]  So be very clear about that.
[01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:48.470]  IMO 4 is its own thing.
[01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:49.790]  It's a completed process.
[01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:52.350]  In my opinion, it is like the crown jewel.
[01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:55.150]  And then IMO 5 may be more useful,
[01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:57.910]  but you don't replace, you don't,
[01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:59.670]  IMO 5 doesn't become your inoculum.
[01:54:59.670 --> 01:55:02.930]  So your IMO 4 is your soil foundation inoculum.
[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.450]  And then now IMO 5 can be your processed food
[01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:08.210]  that is microbial rich and available
[01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:09.950]  and that kind of thing.
[01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:11.950]  If that helps set like a bit of a stage.
[01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:14.190]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:16.670]  And I love the way you brought it.
[01:55:16.670 --> 01:55:19.150]  Seaweed, green wood chips,
[01:55:19.150 --> 01:55:21.470]  all these things that people are afraid to use.
[01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:23.050]  Right?
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:25.390]  Because if you put green wood chips on a plant,
[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:26.950]  you're gonna fucking kill the plant.
[01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:28.730]  Nitrogen is gonna get stolen out of it
[01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:31.430]  because the thermophytes are trying to break down the carbon
[01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:34.070]  and so they need the nitrogen to break the carbon.
[01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:39.070]  So by adding the IMO 4 into fresh green chips,
[01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:40.590]  you're not gonna hurt anything
[01:55:40.590 --> 01:55:45.270]  and you're actually going to create an organic end pool,
[01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:48.550]  nitrogen pool, that then will slowly release back
[01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:50.710]  into the soil without killing your plants.
[01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:54.230]  So dude, fucking cool bars everywhere today.
[01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:55.070]  This is a good one.
[01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.890]  Thanks man.
[01:55:55.890 --> 01:55:57.630]  And I still don't really understand all of that.
[01:55:57.630 --> 01:55:59.710]  So I really appreciate like what I know
[01:55:59.710 --> 01:56:01.510]  to be practitionerly true.
[01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:02.790]  And then you explained to me like
[01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:04.650]  why that's scientifically accurate.
[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:05.490]  Like I love this.
[01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:06.870]  So I really appreciate it, Leighton.
[01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:07.710]  Yeah.
[01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:08.550]  Good one.
[01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:12.430]  And that's why so many people are pushing this kind
[01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:14.810]  of style of cheerleading in a way is
[01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:17.590]  because as you're learning to kind of figure
[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:20.890]  these things out, you can also improve that system.
[01:56:20.890 --> 01:56:22.110]  It's not like you got to sit there
[01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:23.770]  and hover over everything.
[01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:25.910]  If you know that diversity is really at the end
[01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:29.490]  of the day, how you're able to trust the process,
[01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:31.070]  then you can make a few mistakes
[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:33.750]  and mother nature is going to correct that.
[01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:37.830]  I know when you're first kind of making mistakes,
[01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:40.110]  a little bit of vermicompost, maybe extra compost
[01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:44.110]  and some composting worms always usually fixed the problems
[01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:44.950]  for me.
[01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:46.670]  And if I had extra things, I could boiler
[01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:50.630]  with like some kelp with a little bit of yucca extract.
[01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:54.750]  So very minimal costs to fix those mistakes
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.870]  when they sometimes occur
[01:56:56.870 --> 01:57:00.230]  when you're first getting into natural farming.
[01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:04.950]  So when you're talking about ferments and alcohol
[01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:07.670]  of parts per million, they're really, really small.
[01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:11.270]  You know, I don't think it's even worthy of testing it.
[01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:14.730]  I mean, if you make a ferment and you drink it
[01:57:14.730 --> 01:57:18.070]  and it burns your throat, you made alcohol, dude.
[01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:19.270]  You didn't make a ferment.
[01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:23.390]  So, you know, that's important to take into consideration.
[01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:26.670]  And another thing is like, let's bounce back for a minute
[01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:28.470]  and talk about coffee grounds.
[01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:29.910]  Coffee grounds.
[01:57:30.590 --> 01:57:31.910]  I have so many people that are like,
[01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:33.870]  oh, coffee grounds, coffee grounds,
[01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:36.110]  you gotta use them and they're high nitrogen.
[01:57:36.110 --> 01:57:38.110]  Some people say they're low nitrogen.
[01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:40.170]  I consider them neutral.
[01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:42.630]  Like I use all of the coffee I make,
[01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:44.870]  I add to my compost piles
[01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:47.870]  and I never see temperature spikes with it.
[01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:50.150]  I do see a lot of worms that come in
[01:57:50.150 --> 01:57:52.470]  because of those coffee grounds.
[01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:54.510]  But generally speaking, yeah, coffee grounds,
[01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:57.310]  IMO four, IMO five, go for it.
[01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:58.710]  It's not gonna hurt anything.
[01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:01.550]  It's a food source for microbes.
[01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:04.290]  And because it's really C to N neutral,
[01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:06.550]  you're not gonna have to worry about spikes,
[01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:08.630]  at least in my experience.
[01:58:08.630 --> 01:58:10.030]  I don't know, Quinn, you fuck around
[01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:12.130]  with coffee grounds much?
[01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:12.970]  I really don't.
[01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:14.790]  I've had my worm bin now for about a year.
[01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:17.190]  So I'm still dialing it in.
[01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.650]  That's like my new fun project.
[01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:22.110]  I kind of have a question for you, Layton.
[01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:24.110]  Would you almost consider coffee grounds
[01:58:24.110 --> 01:58:26.270]  to be like the poor man's biochar, right?
[01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:28.510]  Because that's kind of a charcoal,
[01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:30.310]  like a dark roast is essentially
[01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:33.390]  a charcoal woody material, right?
[01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:34.230]  I mean.
[01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:35.110]  Dude, you're spot on.
[01:58:35.110 --> 01:58:40.110]  Slow release, all kinds of secondary metabolites, proteins.
[01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:43.070]  There's all kinds of goodies in those.
[01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:44.390]  Because think about it.
[01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:47.030]  That tree worked really fucking hard to make that bean.
[01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:48.310]  And that bean is really hard
[01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:50.030]  and you cooked it and ground it up.
[01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:54.150]  And yeah, so it has all these wonderful properties.
[01:58:54.150 --> 01:58:59.150]  And again, total potential for long-term nutrient release
[01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:05.790]  without creating any, what I want to call negative impacts.
[01:59:06.150 --> 01:59:09.350]  Now this is a good nugget for you, my friend.
[01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:10.830]  Mushrooms.
[01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:13.790]  Throw tons of mushrooms in your worm bin.
[01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:14.630]  All right?
[01:59:14.630 --> 01:59:16.970]  They do not go fucking nasty slimy
[01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:19.470]  like a lot of foods or fruits do.
[01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:24.870]  They release an amazing amount of nutrient
[01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:28.270]  and the worms fucking love them.
[01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:31.390]  And you're pushing now
[01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:34.790]  toward what I want to call a fungally dominant worm casting
[01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:39.710]  which basically doesn't exist except for one place
[01:59:39.710 --> 01:59:42.790]  that I found it, a friend of mine that I met at Rodale.
[01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:45.510]  But the way he gets it to be fungally dominant
[01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:48.510]  is he uses a tremendous amount of forest duff.
[01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:52.790]  He'll go into places like developments
[01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:55.110]  where they're fucking knocking down woods
[01:59:55.110 --> 01:59:56.990]  and doing all kinds of damage.
[01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:59.110]  And he'll go in there and collect a lot of the stuff
[01:59:59.110 --> 02:00:01.590]  before it gets destroyed or mixed in.
[02:00:01.590 --> 02:00:03.910]  And then he uses that as his bedding.
[02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:07.630]  And again, he's the only guy I've ever seen
[02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:09.930]  create fungally dominant worm castings.
[02:00:09.930 --> 02:00:11.630]  But this is a trick for you.
[02:00:11.630 --> 02:00:15.130]  Use spent mushroom substrates, mushroom blocks
[02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:17.710]  or just the mushrooms themselves
[02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:19.470]  especially if they've dried out a little bit
[02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:21.070]  and you're not gonna eat them.
[02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:23.630]  Toss those in your worm bin, they'll fuck you wild.
[02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:28.390]  So that's really encouraging
[02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:31.510]  because I actually like the dummy that I am.
[02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:34.910]  I took my IMO brain and started trying to feed wood shavings
[02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:38.110]  and IMO four to my worm bin
[02:00:38.110 --> 02:00:40.270]  and like lit the thing on fire damn near.
[02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:43.910]  I had all the worms like running around the outside
[02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:46.550]  and it's like up to 120 degrees.
[02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:48.270]  And I'm like, oh crap.
[02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:51.910]  So I've actually been like, okay, no IMOs in the worm bin.
[02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:52.870]  So this is good.
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:55.110]  Now I'll start feathering it back in
[02:00:55.110 --> 02:00:56.950]  and getting some other kinds of mushrooms
[02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:57.790]  going on in there.
[02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:58.630]  So thank you.
[02:00:58.630 --> 02:01:02.350]  Yeah, coffee grounds, your spent mushroom blocks,
[02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:06.750]  dried out mushrooms, even mushrooms that you foraged
[02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:10.230]  are wonderful food sources for those worms.
[02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:13.110]  And yeah, I've seen people have some serious issues
[02:01:13.110 --> 02:01:15.630]  where like literally the worms are all over the floor
[02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:18.470]  in the morning because they freaked out.
[02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:21.030]  There was too much, there's too much food in there.
[02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:22.630]  And they stink.
[02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:27.230]  Oh God, have you turned, have you made worm mush yet?
[02:01:27.230 --> 02:01:28.070]  I have a personal-
[02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:29.390]  I don't know.
[02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:31.150]  Oh, worm mush is the worst.
[02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:34.110]  I mean, it's like, oh, it reeks to hell.
[02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:36.510]  If you get it on you, you're fucked.
[02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:38.870]  Your hand's gonna stink for like three days.
[02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:40.190]  I don't care how much you scrub it.
[02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:42.310]  You gotta like literally skin yourself
[02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:43.750]  to get that smell to go away.
[02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:45.670]  Thank you, damn.
[02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:48.390]  No, I haven't seen that.
[02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:49.750]  I've got one of those hungry bins.
[02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:50.790]  So it's vertical.
[02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.310]  So you just feed the top
[02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:54.190]  and then you just extract out of the bottom.
[02:01:54.190 --> 02:01:55.430]  And I really like it.
[02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:58.590]  I mean, it's really made the learning curve really nice.
[02:01:58.590 --> 02:01:59.870]  A lot easier, yeah.
[02:01:59.870 --> 02:02:02.070]  Yeah, pass through bins are golden.
[02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:04.150]  You don't have to do half as much work
[02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:06.590]  and you get the worm castings out the bottom.
[02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:08.190]  Yup.
[02:02:08.190 --> 02:02:11.710]  Yes, alcohol is not a friend to your plant
[02:02:11.710 --> 02:02:13.190]  and more so the roots.
[02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:15.590]  And that's why we all preach
[02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:17.670]  about being careful about going anaerobic
[02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:22.670]  because you are creating an alcohol type of environment.
[02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:24.950]  So what happens in the thermophilic process
[02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:27.990]  is if it runs away on you,
[02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:32.110]  I believe it starts producing alcohol at 180 degrees.
[02:02:32.110 --> 02:02:35.110]  At 190, it can spontaneously combust
[02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:37.230]  because of the volume of alcohol
[02:02:37.230 --> 02:02:39.750]  that's been created in vapor.
[02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:41.110]  So that's the problem
[02:02:41.110 --> 02:02:42.830]  is that you're not creating like a drink.
[02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:47.070]  You're creating this alcohol rich atmosphere
[02:02:47.070 --> 02:02:50.030]  that with one spark, boom, goes crazy.
[02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:53.670]  And if you touch off a fucking compost pile, man,
[02:02:53.670 --> 02:02:54.910]  you can't open it up.
[02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:57.590]  If you try to stick a backhoe in there,
[02:02:57.590 --> 02:03:00.630]  it's gonna go off like a fucking grenade and cook you.
[02:03:00.630 --> 02:03:02.150]  If you try to apply water,
[02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:03.350]  the water's just gonna run off
[02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:06.390]  and you're gonna create an environmental fucking disaster.
[02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:11.390]  So yeah, be really, really careful about alcohol production,
[02:03:11.630 --> 02:03:13.870]  especially in compost.
[02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:16.630]  But even if it's not compost
[02:03:16.630 --> 02:03:19.550]  and it's like an aquatic environment,
[02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:21.910]  then those alcohols can be produced again
[02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:24.470]  as well as other enzymes
[02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:26.590]  that will eat the tissue of your roots.
[02:03:26.590 --> 02:03:30.150]  I mean, I'm sure you've all seen brown and black roots.
[02:03:30.150 --> 02:03:31.270]  That's what that is.
[02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:34.270]  That's decomposition of that root.
[02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:36.190]  And you're never gonna hit plant potential
[02:03:36.190 --> 02:03:37.950]  if you start frying off your roots.
[02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:40.490]  So that's why it's so important
[02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:42.490]  to not allow anaerobic conditions
[02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:45.130]  and not create environments that can create alcohol.
[02:03:46.530 --> 02:03:50.530]  So I could talk a little bit about alcohol in OHN
[02:03:50.530 --> 02:03:51.890]  and the role that it plays
[02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:54.810]  and why there is alcohol there
[02:03:54.810 --> 02:03:58.330]  and what it's doing, a little bit of that theory.
[02:03:59.250 --> 02:04:03.330]  So in OHN, sure, it's a lot of alcohol,
[02:04:03.330 --> 02:04:05.050]  but you're using it at one to 1,000.
[02:04:05.050 --> 02:04:06.530]  So you actually crunch the numbers.
[02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:09.570]  It's a very homeopathic amount of alcohol.
[02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:11.410]  What that alcohol is doing,
[02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:14.690]  so if you, you're familiar with people,
[02:04:14.690 --> 02:04:16.010]  they go skiing, they drink alcohol,
[02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:17.410]  it keeps them warmer, right?
[02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:21.370]  What it actually does is release a lot of your core heat
[02:04:21.370 --> 02:04:22.450]  to your whole body.
[02:04:22.450 --> 02:04:25.790]  So there's, I believe it's a Northern European country,
[02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:27.330]  like Switzerland or something.
[02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:29.470]  And if somebody gets stuck in an avalanche,
[02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:31.810]  they send a St. Bernard with a barrel of brandy
[02:04:31.810 --> 02:04:32.850]  around its neck.
[02:04:32.850 --> 02:04:34.930]  I might be messing up a little bit of these details
[02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:37.490]  and the dog finds you, you drink the brandy
[02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:38.850]  and you snuggle the dog, right?
[02:04:38.890 --> 02:04:40.570]  So the dog keeps you warm.
[02:04:40.570 --> 02:04:44.770]  The brandy takes the core heat that your body's inside.
[02:04:44.770 --> 02:04:46.890]  Like I don't care about my hands and my feet,
[02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:48.290]  I just need to not die.
[02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:51.130]  And the alcohol forces that to be dispersed.
[02:04:51.130 --> 02:04:55.210]  So it's like a circulant, right?
[02:04:55.210 --> 02:05:00.210]  It creates the ability for the alcohol to wanna,
[02:05:01.190 --> 02:05:02.770]  the alcohol moves the heat everywhere,
[02:05:02.770 --> 02:05:05.730]  like evenly throughout your body, which could be bad,
[02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:07.370]  but in this scenario, they're coming to get you
[02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:08.590]  because the dog's already there.
[02:05:09.330 --> 02:05:10.830]  So they're trying to save your fingers and toes.
[02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:12.710]  They know where you are kind of thing, right?
[02:05:12.710 --> 02:05:16.110]  So what we're doing with the alcohol, with the OHN
[02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:19.150]  is we're actually using the alcohol as a delivery mechanism
[02:05:19.150 --> 02:05:22.070]  for all these prebiotics, like the garlic and the ginger
[02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:24.550]  and the cinnamon and the Angelica and the licorice.
[02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:28.710]  So it's a delivery mechanism and medium,
[02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:32.430]  and it creates the ability for this to permeate
[02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:34.430]  the vascular system of the plant better
[02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:38.390]  and distribute all of these nutrients rapidly.
[02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:41.030]  So that's kind of what's going on there.
[02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:43.870]  And I implore everyone to remember the ratios
[02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:45.590]  that we're using these things at.
[02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:47.590]  You're talking about how much alcohol is in an FPJ.
[02:05:47.590 --> 02:05:49.830]  Well, none if you kept a breathable lid,
[02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:52.550]  or so little that when you dilute it one to 500,
[02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:54.630]  it's completely irrelevant.
[02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:57.470]  So yeah, so alcohol is totally present
[02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:59.790]  in some of these things, but when you're actually applying it
[02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:02.590]  the amount is really negligible
[02:06:02.590 --> 02:06:04.790]  and it actually does have a beneficial purpose
[02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.830]  when used correctly even.
[02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:08.790]  And thank you for quantifying that
[02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:11.430]  because that was Dr. Lane's biggest pitch
[02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:14.830]  about natural farming, K and F, whatever you wanna call it.
[02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:17.630]  When I first introduced her to Chris Trump,
[02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:19.110]  it was like cats and dogs.
[02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:21.110]  I mean, she was so out of it, like,
[02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:22.710]  oh my God, you can't ferment,
[02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:24.150]  oh my God, you can't use alcohol.
[02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:25.310]  And I'm like, Elaine.
[02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:27.390]  So late, that was my teaser.
[02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:30.070]  That dilution ratio's tiny.
[02:06:30.070 --> 02:06:32.110]  It's not negligible.
[02:06:32.110 --> 02:06:33.910]  It's not gonna cause any problems.
[02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:34.750]  What are you, I'm sorry,
[02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:36.590]  what were you talking about, Brian, teaser?
[02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:38.190]  That was my teaser for you guys.
[02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:42.390]  So there were two worldviews just a few years ago.
[02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.790]  One side, I felt like Chris Trump
[02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:47.150]  was obviously carrying the banner for that side.
[02:06:47.150 --> 02:06:48.710]  And then on the soil food side,
[02:06:48.710 --> 02:06:50.590]  obviously Dr. Lane Ehan was carrying
[02:06:50.590 --> 02:06:52.990]  the banner on that side.
[02:06:52.990 --> 02:06:55.190]  From my experience and seeing others
[02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:59.270]  that kind of chose to still listen to both camps,
[02:06:59.270 --> 02:07:01.670]  it seems like there were two roads
[02:07:01.670 --> 02:07:05.390]  and then those individuals created their own road from that
[02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:07.190]  where they weren't just tied down
[02:07:07.190 --> 02:07:08.870]  to one certain philosophy or the other.
[02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:13.870]  They were open to a variety of mentors, of educators.
[02:07:14.110 --> 02:07:16.110]  So I kind of wanted to get into,
[02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:18.750]  in your opinion, why that was.
[02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:22.030]  And I feel like Quinn, you kind of maybe
[02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:25.470]  kind of told the punchline before we got into this,
[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:28.950]  but why Dr. Lane Ehan had an issue with that.
[02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:30.590]  And then from what I understand,
[02:07:30.590 --> 02:07:32.390]  when they did speak late,
[02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:35.590]  she kind of, I guess, understands more from that side.
[02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:37.590]  And then Chris kind of understands more
[02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:39.430]  of where she was coming from is,
[02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:41.950]  I guess, the word on the street
[02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:43.630]  that they kind of found common ground
[02:07:43.630 --> 02:07:45.510]  after talking it through.
[02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:49.390]  Well, you know, it's funny how progression is
[02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:53.190]  and how people tend to throw up defenses
[02:07:53.190 --> 02:07:54.750]  when they're dealing with something new
[02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:56.550]  that they don't completely understand.
[02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:59.510]  They immediately poo-poo it or step back and say,
[02:07:59.710 --> 02:08:02.150]  I wouldn't recommend that without thoroughly
[02:08:02.150 --> 02:08:03.550]  understanding it.
[02:08:03.550 --> 02:08:08.550]  But Elaine went out to Chris's farm on Hawaii
[02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:12.390]  and taught Chris how to use the microscope.
[02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:16.430]  And that's where she first got the understanding
[02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:19.070]  of what the fuck is he doing?
[02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:21.030]  You know, this natural farming shit,
[02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:24.310]  this Korean natural farming, whatever you want to call it.
[02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:26.150]  And she pulled back hard and was like,
[02:08:26.150 --> 02:08:29.270]  oh my God, you're using seawater, using salt.
[02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:32.390]  You're using ferments, you're using alcohol.
[02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:35.910]  Now she didn't understand that the dilution ratios
[02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:38.230]  are insane, that it's not something
[02:08:38.230 --> 02:08:40.350]  that is going to harm anything.
[02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:45.350]  Again, it's using diversity to utilize nature,
[02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:47.630]  not take it away.
[02:08:47.630 --> 02:08:50.030]  I mean, there's nothing more incredible
[02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:52.430]  than to look at the giant redwoods
[02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:54.230]  along the coast of California.
[02:08:54.230 --> 02:08:57.150]  The reason they're so big is because of the fog
[02:08:57.150 --> 02:08:59.670]  and the salt water and the salt air.
[02:08:59.670 --> 02:09:03.990]  They're getting free nutrients, micronutrients on scale
[02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:06.270]  on a consistent basis.
[02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:11.270]  So once she, well, I don't know if I should tell the story,
[02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:13.190]  but.
[02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:17.150]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, let's go, let's go, come on.
[02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:18.470]  Oh man, she's gonna-
[02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:20.150]  Everybody leans in.
[02:09:21.190 --> 02:09:22.430]  She's gonna hate on me for this.
[02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:24.110]  Who's got the tea today?
[02:09:24.110 --> 02:09:26.550]  To be continued, dot, dot, dot.
[02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:32.390]  So, you know, we got Elaine up to the Regen Conference.
[02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:38.790]  You know, the environment is, let's say smoke-filled
[02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:42.270]  is a gentle way of saying that the potential
[02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:44.910]  for contact high was pretty real.
[02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:48.110]  And so, you know, there was a couple of times
[02:09:48.110 --> 02:09:50.030]  like when we were driving together,
[02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:53.630]  either to the venue or back or to the airport or back,
[02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:56.950]  whatever, that she was in an environment with Chris
[02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:59.910]  and I was, you know, being a, like,
[02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:01.150]  just trying to be a mediator,
[02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:03.790]  trying to be the guy in the middle to open her mind
[02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:06.550]  because look, Elaine went through a lot of fucking shit, man.
[02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:08.830]  She took a lot of crap.
[02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:09.870]  She got set up.
[02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:13.790]  She's had friends disappear, die mysteriously
[02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:14.750]  because let's face it,
[02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:17.310]  these chemical companies don't play nice
[02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:20.870]  and they do not want farmers to have alternatives
[02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:22.390]  to their fucking heroin.
[02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:23.510]  They don't want it.
[02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:25.030]  That changes the power game
[02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:28.310]  and it takes away their ability to manipulate
[02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:30.470]  and make money and survive.
[02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:34.110]  So yeah, there was a lot of really fucking ugly shit
[02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:38.070]  that went down when she started to bring the understanding
[02:10:38.070 --> 02:10:40.590]  that the soil is alive to the world
[02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:43.670]  because prior to that, it was, oh, chemistry and soil.
[02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:44.510]  There's nothing else.
[02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:45.870]  You don't even think about biology.
[02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:46.950]  There is no biology.
[02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:51.390]  So needless to say, I understand her defense mechanisms
[02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:52.990]  and, you know, believe me,
[02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:57.510]  I was so blessed because I had one-on-one experience
[02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:58.950]  with her for 18 months,
[02:10:58.950 --> 02:11:02.150]  pretty much three to four days a week down at Rodale
[02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:07.150]  in this very scientific world environment.
[02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:11.310]  And so, you know, not only do we get to go out for beer
[02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:13.910]  on Thursday nights and laughs,
[02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:15.870]  so I got to see her both relax
[02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:18.190]  as well as, you know, very strict and stringent
[02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:19.590]  in her teachings.
[02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:22.350]  So I got to know her on a level
[02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:26.070]  that probably the vast majority of people don't get to.
[02:11:26.070 --> 02:11:28.030]  So I could, I did have tools.
[02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:32.110]  I did have an inside track to trying to get her
[02:11:32.110 --> 02:11:34.070]  to open her eyes where, you know,
[02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:35.670]  perhaps a lot of people couldn't
[02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:39.790]  or she's too uptight and stressed to allow it to happen
[02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:43.350]  because of her past, you know, PST experiences.
[02:11:44.190 --> 02:11:47.590]  But needless to say, by the end of the car ride,
[02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:54.830]  she was a lot more receptive to allowing Chris
[02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:58.750]  to explain the fact that these dilution ratios
[02:11:58.750 --> 02:12:02.590]  were so small that it wasn't like pouring salt water
[02:12:02.590 --> 02:12:03.430]  on the plants.
[02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:08.350]  It wasn't pouring heavy alcohol fermented plant juice
[02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:10.310]  onto a plant.
[02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:13.310]  That's what kind of got her to back off a little
[02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:16.830]  and say, wow, you know, I never really thought of that.
[02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:19.510]  And then when she began to understand
[02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:24.110]  that this was actually a tradition that came from Japan
[02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:27.110]  thousands of years ago,
[02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:30.390]  that there was something more than a,
[02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:33.310]  oh, this is a pet rock or a new Gucci bag
[02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:36.710]  or a new somebody's made up something, you know,
[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:40.270]  that there was some documented history behind it.
[02:12:41.150 --> 02:12:42.830]  That really changed the game for her.
[02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:44.870]  And then I think that after that,
[02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:47.470]  she backed off on bashing natural farming
[02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:48.950]  or Korean natural farming
[02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:53.070]  because she understood that there was a lot of work
[02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:57.630]  and many thousands of years, and this wasn't bullshit.
[02:12:57.630 --> 02:13:02.350]  It was actually something that was a very valuable tool
[02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:05.470]  that again, compliments the soil food web.
[02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:09.430]  This does not deter from it in any way, shape or form.
[02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:10.510]  And again, I think that, you know,
[02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:11.910]  that's always been an issue, Brian.
[02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:13.750]  We've talked about this how many times?
[02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:16.270]  People want to jump in a camp, raise the flag
[02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:18.150]  and say, this is the only way.
[02:13:18.150 --> 02:13:19.790]  And that's not the case.
[02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:23.510]  And Elaine will be the first to say, it's about diversity.
[02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:27.430]  So if you have the opportunity to add something in
[02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:30.830]  that's going to provide something that you don't have
[02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:34.030]  or something perhaps your plants need,
[02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:38.190]  then you'd be crazy not to encourage it or introduce it.
[02:13:38.190 --> 02:13:40.150]  But again, this isn't being a moron.
[02:13:40.150 --> 02:13:42.070]  This isn't dumping fucking, you know,
[02:13:42.070 --> 02:13:44.470]  gallons of salt water on your plants.
[02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:45.670]  It's a ferment.
[02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:48.070]  It's you're using it responsibly.
[02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:50.870]  Okay, here we go.
[02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:52.630]  So what about dead leaves with mycelium
[02:13:52.630 --> 02:13:54.070]  for inoculating other stuff?
[02:13:54.070 --> 02:13:54.910]  Yes, great.
[02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:59.910]  But remember, you're almost better off to use new leaves
[02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:04.390]  because of the endophytic fungi that live in those leaves
[02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:07.030]  that will come out as saprophytes
[02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:09.230]  as they start to break down.
[02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:13.110]  So if you've got leaves that are already broken down
[02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:16.590]  into humus, yes, you're going to have mycelium, right?
[02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:20.310]  That we all understand that's an added value.
[02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:25.150]  But again, we have yet to document in nature
[02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:30.150]  that the hyphal fungi can turn into a new body,
[02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:33.310]  a new organism and grow out.
[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:36.910]  Now I've done so much work on this shit, it's not funny.
[02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:40.670]  And to be honest, the only real way I've ever seen
[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:46.350]  fungal dominated or grow out
[02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:49.470]  is because we had a tremendous amount of spore
[02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:54.470]  or we took compost or newer leaves,
[02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.670]  newer chips mixed with older chips.
[02:14:57.670 --> 02:15:00.670]  So it wasn't like I could ever state
[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:05.670]  that that fungal hyphae is an inoculant.
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:08.750]  The spores, we absolutely know they are.
[02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:12.110]  In mycorrhizae, you have what are called propagules,
[02:15:12.110 --> 02:15:16.110]  which actually live inside the tissue of the plant.
[02:15:16.110 --> 02:15:18.330]  Here again, that's why I'm saying compost,
[02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:21.550]  but do it with green leaves and brown leaves
[02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:24.630]  so that you are getting everything you possibly can
[02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:27.510]  and the potential for that to expand out
[02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:30.930]  and grow out and colonize your soil system.
[02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:33.990]  So leaves, leaves leave, level.
[02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:35.030]  Leaves are life.
[02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:36.950]  Quinn, you were doing some cheerleading over there.
[02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:39.190]  Did you kind of want to respond on that?
[02:15:39.190 --> 02:15:41.710]  Yeah, I lay in everything you just said.
[02:15:41.710 --> 02:15:45.470]  I mean, the story you told, the encounter,
[02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.390]  that was all amazing.
[02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:49.850]  And then I've been kind of like stuck on this thing recently
[02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:51.670]  where I feel like people are like,
[02:15:51.670 --> 02:15:54.230]  oh, well, you know, saprophytes do this
[02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:59.230]  and mycorrhizal do that and parasites,
[02:15:59.330 --> 02:16:01.290]  the parasitic fungi are these.
[02:16:01.290 --> 02:16:05.410]  And I think the lines are a lot less clear
[02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:07.450]  than we're told they are.
[02:16:07.450 --> 02:16:10.810]  And I think we don't really know who can play.
[02:16:10.810 --> 02:16:14.570]  Like a lot of parasites can be, you know, can be helpful.
[02:16:14.570 --> 02:16:17.150]  And we don't really know who's on which team
[02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:20.410]  and when they switch sides and what those teams look like.
[02:16:20.410 --> 02:16:24.330]  Can a saprophyte be a mycorrhizal that's also parasitic?
[02:16:24.330 --> 02:16:26.370]  Sometimes, like probably.
[02:16:26.370 --> 02:16:29.490]  I don't think we even have any clue
[02:16:29.490 --> 02:16:32.790]  as to what these microbes in community are capable of.
[02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:35.830]  And our categories are very much our categories.
[02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:38.230]  Those microbes didn't raise their hand and say,
[02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:40.590]  I'm saprophytic and he's mycorrhizal.
[02:16:40.590 --> 02:16:42.310]  Like we put those labels on
[02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:44.790]  and we have to be willing for those labels to evolve
[02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:49.790]  and to cover concepts and situational microbial expression
[02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:53.310]  rather than, oh, this is always like that, right?
[02:16:53.310 --> 02:16:54.590]  Someone isn't always a good person.
[02:16:54.590 --> 02:16:55.790]  They're not always a thief.
[02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:56.950]  They're not always a drug addict.
[02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:57.950]  They're not always a lawyer.
[02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:59.870]  Those are roles that they play
[02:16:59.870 --> 02:17:00.950]  at certain times in their life.
[02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:02.830]  And I think we're gonna see that with microbes,
[02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:05.670]  especially with these larger bodied,
[02:17:05.670 --> 02:17:09.030]  more complex microbes like fungi.
[02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:11.830]  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head on so much,
[02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:14.230]  but we should clarify something.
[02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:15.070]  Yeah.
[02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:18.430]  Saprophytes will always be decomposers.
[02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.630]  Mycorrhizae will always be miners.
[02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:25.350]  So a saprophyte will never actually break
[02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:30.350]  into a cell wall of a plant and exchange a nutrient, okay?
[02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:34.590]  They will provide or they will take up nutrient
[02:17:34.590 --> 02:17:37.510]  through breaking down, releasing organic acids,
[02:17:37.510 --> 02:17:40.670]  pulling nutrients out of woody lignin materials.
[02:17:40.670 --> 02:17:43.830]  And then as they get disturbed or eaten
[02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:48.830]  by anything from bacteria to micro-earth apods to moles,
[02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:53.150]  there's so many animals that actually eat the mycelium
[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:54.510]  as a food source.
[02:17:54.510 --> 02:17:56.830]  And then all of those nutrients leak back
[02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:59.910]  into the soil structure, plant available,
[02:18:00.470 --> 02:18:03.030]  but they don't have a relationship with the plant.
[02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:04.990]  Now get into the middle of all this shit
[02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:06.630]  and you get into endophytic,
[02:18:06.630 --> 02:18:09.430]  the endophytic phase of saprophytes,
[02:18:09.430 --> 02:18:11.270]  that gets really complicated because yes,
[02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:14.910]  now they are living inside of the plant tissue.
[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:17.430]  But again, they don't have the same relationship
[02:18:17.430 --> 02:18:19.430]  that a mycorrhizae does.
[02:18:19.430 --> 02:18:22.150]  But you're spot on about the understanding
[02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:25.830]  that we know nothing is the best approach
[02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:27.230]  under these circumstances.
[02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:28.950]  What we do know is there's mycorrhizae
[02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:30.390]  and there's saprophytes.
[02:18:30.390 --> 02:18:33.670]  But their relationship, all right?
[02:18:33.670 --> 02:18:37.750]  So when you see that fungal hyphae, that coating,
[02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:39.830]  now remember that white is a coating
[02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:43.950]  to protect the fungal body from sunlight
[02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:47.390]  or from pH changes.
[02:18:47.390 --> 02:18:50.270]  Some animal comes along and urinates.
[02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:54.430]  That white coating is to protect all of the cords,
[02:18:54.470 --> 02:18:58.070]  the thousands, hundreds of thousands of little tiny hyphae
[02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:59.830]  that are running through that,
[02:18:59.830 --> 02:19:04.070]  that are intertwined with mycorrhizae and saprophytes.
[02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:06.630]  It gets fucking complicated as shit.
[02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:10.870]  And we will probably, without supercomputers and AI,
[02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:13.510]  we will never truly be able to understand
[02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:15.870]  or unravel who's doing what
[02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:17.950]  and who's playing nice and who isn't.
[02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:20.430]  And then you get into the parasitics
[02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:22.350]  and how they can be,
[02:19:22.350 --> 02:19:24.750]  like a mycorrhizae can be a parasite.
[02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:28.390]  If the plant doesn't need these nutrients
[02:19:28.390 --> 02:19:33.110]  and the plant's getting sucked out of exudates
[02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:35.110]  from the mycorrhizae,
[02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:38.630]  then it's actually doing more damage than it's doing good.
[02:19:38.630 --> 02:19:41.470]  So that mycorrhizae can be parasitic.
[02:19:41.470 --> 02:19:45.390]  And the same thing is true with the parasitic fungi
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:47.630]  can actually become beneficial.
[02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:49.910]  It's been shown that in the right environment,
[02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:52.950]  Fusarium will actually begin to be a sapro.
[02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:56.670]  And I believe it's in conjunction with mycorrhizae
[02:19:56.670 --> 02:20:00.670]  or maybe it's in a very high fungally dominant environment.
[02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:05.070]  And this gets into another whole quagmire, F to B ratio.
[02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:08.310]  Soil food web F to B ratio is documented
[02:20:08.310 --> 02:20:13.310]  based on soil saprophytic fungi and bacterial relationship.
[02:20:14.390 --> 02:20:17.750]  Under no condition does the soil food web
[02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:21.230]  take into consideration the colonization
[02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:23.230]  of mycorrhizae fungi.
[02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:24.990]  So that's a huge fuck up.
[02:20:24.990 --> 02:20:26.110]  All right.
[02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:27.950]  When you send off for a soil food web,
[02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:31.190]  they will give you a little box to check to see
[02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:34.950]  if you want to test for mycorrhizae fungi.
[02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:37.910]  But under no conditions is that relationship
[02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:42.630]  of colonization ratio added back into the F to B ratio
[02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:47.470]  on what that soil or what that test result looks like.
[02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:50.390]  So we still have a shit ton of work to do.
[02:20:50.390 --> 02:20:53.590]  And understanding that we know nothing
[02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:55.910]  is the safest place to be.
[02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:58.230]  But understand that these little rules
[02:20:58.230 --> 02:21:00.750]  or these little nuggets that we do know
[02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:05.310]  are safe to take into consideration
[02:21:05.310 --> 02:21:07.670]  when you're looking at the bigger picture.
[02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:11.030]  But by no means are they at the end all be all.
[02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:12.910]  I mean, I've had to recorrect myself,
[02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:15.950]  I don't know how many fucking times in the last 12 years,
[02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:19.510]  because what I knew then just changed today
[02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:22.550]  because of this new information, this new white paper,
[02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:24.350]  this new study that came out.
[02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:28.230]  So again, don't ever consider yourself an expert.
[02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:31.710]  Consider yourself an expert student, right?
[02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:33.470]  You're a really good student.
[02:21:34.310 --> 02:21:35.790]  That's where you should be.
[02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:38.830]  Otherwise you only know this one thing
[02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:40.670]  in this point in time.
[02:21:42.110 --> 02:21:43.630]  Sorry, that just changed.
[02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:49.070]  That's the one consistency in life is everything changes.
[02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:51.710]  And if you're not willing to grow with it,
[02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:54.150]  you're gonna get stuck in that rut
[02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:55.830]  and then you're in trouble.
[02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:58.630]  So true, so true.
[02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:04.030]  I'm pretty like new with those,
[02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:05.670]  like what are the relationships?
[02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:06.750]  I mean, we kind of all are,
[02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:10.870]  but I really appreciate you putting lines to like,
[02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:12.950]  well, this is what we're pretty sure of.
[02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:14.030]  This is what we know.
[02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:15.630]  This is what we don't know anything about.
[02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:17.430]  This is what we know a little bit about.
[02:22:17.430 --> 02:22:18.990]  I really appreciate the time you put in.
[02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:20.350]  And I mean, I can't,
[02:22:20.350 --> 02:22:22.430]  I mean, I have trouble even just looking at white papers
[02:22:22.430 --> 02:22:24.550]  and extrapolating any kind of information.
[02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:27.310]  So I appreciate that next level of intellect
[02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:29.230]  and being able to dissect some of those things
[02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:32.150]  and bring it back to us, man.
[02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.990]  So-
[02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:36.790]  It took me years, years to learn how to read white papers
[02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:40.270]  because they're constantly referring back
[02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.710]  to some other study that someone else did.
[02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:44.430]  So in order to fucking understand it,
[02:22:44.430 --> 02:22:46.510]  you got to read a sentence,
[02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:51.510]  then chase back that what they quoted in that sentence
[02:22:51.550 --> 02:22:55.030]  so that you understand what that sentence actually meant.
[02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:59.030]  And so you're spending more time going back
[02:22:59.030 --> 02:23:01.070]  and looking at past studies
[02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:02.790]  to really understand this study.
[02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:04.270]  It's a mind fuck, dude.
[02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:06.910]  It's really a bitch to read those things.
[02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:10.390]  So what I learned to do was skim.
[02:23:10.390 --> 02:23:12.830]  So I read the abstract.
[02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:15.310]  I read sometimes the experimental setup,
[02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:17.470]  and then I read the conclusions.
[02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:20.670]  And then I'll go and start looking at the references.
[02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:23.310]  And as I see, oh, I've seen this guy referred before.
[02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:25.030]  I've seen this guy referred before.
[02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:27.150]  Oh my God, I've seen this guy referred so many times.
[02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:30.430]  Now I got to go back and read that paper
[02:23:30.430 --> 02:23:31.870]  because that's going to expand
[02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:34.910]  on what this paper sole focus was
[02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:39.070]  or what they're trying to push forward
[02:23:39.070 --> 02:23:41.110]  on the next level of knowledge.
[02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:46.110]  So they're basically foundational building papers.
[02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:52.710]  But dude, the stuff that came out in 2020 and 2021
[02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:58.910]  on the relationship of bacteria and fungi,
[02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:02.630]  both saprophytes and mycorrhizae,
[02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:05.790]  was just fucking mind blowing.
[02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:09.470]  So we now know on the outside of that hyphae,
[02:24:09.470 --> 02:24:13.510]  not the mycelium, but the individual hyphae
[02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:15.190]  that's inside the mycelium,
[02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:19.630]  there's a coating similar to the rhizosphere.
[02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:23.150]  So basically I'm assuming everybody understands
[02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:26.670]  the rhizosphere is a aqueous, liquidous coating
[02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:28.390]  around the outside of the root
[02:24:28.390 --> 02:24:31.750]  where all of the nutrient cycling really is happening,
[02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:34.110]  where the protozoa are eating the bacteria
[02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:36.470]  and releasing the pantry of the bacteria.
[02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:38.110]  So that's all the micronutrients,
[02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:41.830]  the nitrogen in some cases, the carbon in other cases,
[02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:45.550]  releasing it right into the plant's root zone
[02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:48.630]  where it can pull it in and use it.
[02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:53.190]  So now we know that there's a coating
[02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:56.710]  similar to the rhizosphere on the outside
[02:24:56.710 --> 02:25:00.030]  of both saprophytic and mycorrhizae.
[02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:05.030]  And not only is it a coating that supports biology,
[02:25:05.390 --> 02:25:07.870]  it's actually a highway.
[02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:09.790]  There's liquid going in both directions.
[02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:12.110]  So these bacteria can jump in here,
[02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:15.550]  get off at three train stops down,
[02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:18.230]  jump on the other side, come back one stop.
[02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:20.910]  So the plants are releasing exudates,
[02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:23.230]  communicating with the fungi,
[02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:28.230]  and actually calling in phosphate solubilizing bacteria,
[02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:33.430]  potassium solubilizing bacteria, nitrifying bacteria.
[02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:38.030]  So it's moving those organisms as well as the nutrients
[02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:40.630]  back and forth to these different plant groups.
[02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:44.630]  And that's the outside.
[02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:47.870]  We also now know that those bacteria,
[02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:49.670]  some of them are allowed to actually go
[02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:52.270]  inside of the fucking hyphae
[02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:56.590]  and move in that aqueous environment or liquid environment.
[02:25:56.590 --> 02:26:00.190]  And both saprobes and mycorrhizae are doing this.
[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:02.750]  And in conjunction with plants,
[02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:04.710]  telling them, different plants,
[02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:07.070]  not even the same fucking plants.
[02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:08.790]  So they're all working on a level
[02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:12.030]  that is just staggering to think about.
[02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:16.630]  It's like trying to comprehend how space is expanding
[02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:18.270]  and expanding into what?
[02:26:20.470 --> 02:26:21.310]  Right?
[02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:24.750]  So smoke a couple bong reps, do a couple dabs,
[02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:27.590]  and dive down that fucking rabbit hole
[02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:31.510]  of understanding how important fungi are
[02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:34.910]  in the soil system, in the Garden of Eden,
[02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:37.750]  and understand that they're the first ones to go
[02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:39.350]  in a disturbed soil environment,
[02:26:39.350 --> 02:26:43.110]  whether it's disturbed mechanically or chemically.
[02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:44.310]  They go first.
[02:26:44.310 --> 02:26:48.030]  And so that's why IMO is so important.
[02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:53.030]  And the foundation of natural farming is IMO.
[02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:54.710]  And I don't think,
[02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:57.550]  I think maybe a small percentage of people
[02:26:57.550 --> 02:27:02.070]  who actually either dive into natural farming or KNF,
[02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:05.350]  understand that, that it's all about the IMO.
[02:27:05.350 --> 02:27:08.270]  The other stuff is just a fucking bonus,
[02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:10.830]  is other tools that you can use.
[02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:13.710]  But if your focus is not on IMO
[02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:18.710]  and not on the foundation of restoring
[02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:22.670]  the microbial community back to the soil,
[02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:25.070]  then you missed the fucking boat, dude.
[02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:27.550]  And hopefully you just heard that rant
[02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:30.070]  because that rant proves and indicates
[02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:34.430]  how important fungi are in a healthy soil system.
[02:27:34.430 --> 02:27:36.650]  You're never gonna get that fucking highway.
[02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:38.430]  You're never gonna get that internet
[02:27:38.430 --> 02:27:42.190]  that allows this microbe to literally move three plants over
[02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:45.430]  in a matter of seconds, or come back to another plant
[02:27:45.430 --> 02:27:47.710]  because now that plant needs it back again,
[02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:51.910]  or grow out or colonize.
[02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:55.910]  So yeah, it's fucking crazy deep shit.
[02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:57.870]  Sorry, I didn't mean to go on that rant.
[02:27:58.790 --> 02:28:01.350]  Dude, that was some low level shit.
[02:28:01.350 --> 02:28:05.510]  That was next level painting of the universe, dude.
[02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:07.350]  That was awesome.
[02:28:07.350 --> 02:28:08.350]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:11.270]  That was, I didn't know any about that, about the coding.
[02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:13.150]  I didn't even know that multiple fungi
[02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:15.550]  could be bound in the same mycelium,
[02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:17.390]  like in a beneficial way.
[02:28:17.390 --> 02:28:21.270]  Like, I mean, that was unbelievable.
[02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:22.430]  That was just pure bonds, dude.
[02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:23.630]  That was great.
[02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:27.910]  Yeah, that mycelium is just to protect them
[02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:32.870]  and support their growth and their health in that too.
[02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:35.710]  It's bad-ass, dude.
[02:28:35.710 --> 02:28:37.510]  And like I said, the last couple of years,
[02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:41.030]  the amount of next level information
[02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:45.430]  that's come out about the value and importance of fungi
[02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:50.430]  really sends home a very loud ringing
[02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:55.510]  of how fucked up our soils are at this point
[02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:59.110]  and how the only way we're gonna come back from this
[02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:02.590]  is to really start getting IMOs
[02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:05.550]  as the foundation to agriculture.
[02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:08.670]  And whether it's industrial agriculture,
[02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:12.190]  commercial agriculture, food production,
[02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:14.790]  if you don't have these tools,
[02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:17.350]  you're never gonna get back to nutrient-dense food.
[02:29:17.350 --> 02:29:20.390]  You're never gonna get back to vitamins and minerals.
[02:29:21.350 --> 02:29:24.670]  And without those, how well are we gonna function, man?
[02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:26.670]  We're all gonna be fucking sick.
[02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:29.670]  So fungi for the fucking win, man.
[02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:33.750]  They're not only fungi, man, they are a fucking killer.
[02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:37.350]  And fungi are found in space, right?
[02:29:37.350 --> 02:29:39.070]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:40.430]  That's another mind-blowing for me.
[02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:43.670]  We're gonna have fish brew on,
[02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:45.430]  and we're gonna talk, because they-
[02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:49.430]  Take a heroic dose and think about that stuff.
[02:29:49.430 --> 02:29:50.270]  You're right.
[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:55.270]  So that relationship of aquatic fungi is,
[02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:58.270]  we're gonna fucking pop some corks
[02:29:58.270 --> 02:29:59.630]  when fish brew come on.
[02:29:59.630 --> 02:30:02.630]  They did some advanced level mRNA testing
[02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:11.030]  on their product based on my encouragement
[02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:12.590]  and barking at them that like,
[02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:14.990]  hey, you wanna make claims?
[02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:16.310]  You're gonna have to do the work, man.
[02:30:16.310 --> 02:30:18.710]  You're gonna have to find out what the fuck is in it.
[02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:20.990]  I'll tell you, that shit fucking works,
[02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:23.070]  and it works really, really well.
[02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.910]  Why?
[02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:26.910]  I can't identify all these different organisms.
[02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:28.950]  I can tell you that it's got a tremendous amount
[02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:31.270]  of flagellates, diversity,
[02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:34.430]  tremendous amount of amoeba, for sure.
[02:30:34.430 --> 02:30:36.830]  I've seen nematodes, I've seen fungal hyphae,
[02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:40.750]  I've seen spores, tremendous amount of bacteria
[02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:45.390]  from nitrifying bacteria to phosphate solubilizing
[02:30:45.390 --> 02:30:47.550]  to potassium solubilizing bacteria.
[02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:52.790]  It's just a fucking hodgepodge of diverse alpha test.
[02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:56.710]  I'm gonna save it till that session,
[02:30:56.710 --> 02:31:00.570]  but the level of fungi in their fucking product.
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:08.540]  So yeah, just as of 2020 or 19 and 20,
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:13.540]  I saw finally papers coming out from NOAA
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:18.900]  and that group in Cape Cod, the name is slipping me,
[02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:26.900]  who are studying the relationship of seagrass,
[02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:32.060]  mangroves, and other aquatic plants
[02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:35.640]  that live in the incredibly important buffer zone.
[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:38.900]  We call it the riparian zone
[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:43.340]  because it's not completely underwater all the time,
[02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:46.140]  and it's not completely on land all the time,
[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:49.700]  but where that line actually is is really difficult.
[02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.260]  You can't just draw a line
[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:54.260]  because water tables go up and down,
[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:56.440]  but there is an incredible relationship
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:59.820]  between these terrestrial and aquatic fungi
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:03.860]  that really there's no way to draw a line between two.
[02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:04.700]  What are they?
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:08.540]  I love Dr. James White and his talks,
[02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:10.140]  and I highly recommend for you
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:12.420]  that really wanna deep dive on this shit,
[02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:13.740]  read up on his work, man.
[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.100]  He has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt
[02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:20.780]  that an endophytic fungi living in a leaf,
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.940]  when that leaf falls to the ground,
[02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:25.100]  will end up becoming a saprobe,
[02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:29.500]  so it will come out as a decomposing fungi,
[02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:34.500]  whereas it was a symbiotic fungi living in the plant,
[02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:38.020]  and if that leaf falls into the water,
[02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:39.540]  it becomes an aquatic fungi.
[02:32:40.540 --> 02:32:43.780]  Yeah, this is fucking crazy shit, man.
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:46.080]  So everything that we knew prior,
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.620]  throw it out the fucking window.
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:51.020]  We have some foundational things that we've learned,
[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:54.820]  but you can no longer just pigeonhole this shit.
[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:56.820]  It's way more complex than that.
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:02.920]  I think part of the complexity is that we're just,
[02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:05.360]  we try to dial in each thing,
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.180]  where in all of life,
[02:33:07.180 --> 02:33:09.220]  you've got the biology that creates you,
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:11.940]  maintains you, and then decomposes you
[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:14.420]  to give it back to the next biology.
[02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:16.220]  I think that's how we've gotta really start
[02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:18.100]  looking at the whole system that way.
[02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:21.420]  And Brian had to take off to go pick up his kids,
[02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:23.140]  so that's why Brian's not here.
[02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:24.500]  That's why he's gone.
[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:28.340]  All right, so that is basically the problem
[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:32.140]  with traditional science, is that it's reductionist,
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.620]  and I understand the importance of it.
[02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:36.380]  You gotta understand how something works,
[02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:39.940]  so you gotta reduce it down to its smallest point.
[02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:43.660]  But I think what the beauty of what happened during COVID
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:46.340]  is that now you're having collapse,
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:51.340]  interdisciplinary groups of scientists that are saying,
[02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:54.300]  eh, what you learned over here
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:57.540]  really kind of fits a piece of the puzzle
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:00.900]  that I can't fix or figure out over here.
[02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:03.540]  And so by bringing all of these different disciplines
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:06.940]  together and having them work in a united,
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:12.100]  collaborative type of relationship
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:16.540]  to unlocking some of these more complex inner
[02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.700]  biological, chemical, geological processes,
[02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:24.260]  that is the future and has to be.
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:26.740]  So we've gotten to the point where we've reduced
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:31.660]  most of the shit down to very small, concrete,
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:35.700]  established fact.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.540]  It's now we gotta start building back.
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:42.140]  Now, get them into quantum particle theory
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:42.980]  and shit like that.
[02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:44.660]  We still got a lot of reductionists to do.
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:49.660]  But the biological and the relationship
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:55.460]  of biology to soil to plant, we need to span out
[02:34:55.980 --> 02:35:00.340]  to get a better grasp on what's really fucking happening.
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:02.780]  And that's where it gets crazy deep.
[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:08.220]  Yeah, like analyzing something in community
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:11.820]  is completely different and way more intensive
[02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:14.580]  than analyzing anything in isolation.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:17.460]  And there's a scientist over in Israel
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:20.580]  who is doing a lot of really cutting edge
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:21.820]  cancer cannabis research,
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:24.620]  like probably the best in the world by far.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:27.780]  And basically has the ability to run these essays
[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:32.540]  with multiple different cannabinoids in sequence.
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:35.260]  So he can easily alter the amount of THC,
[02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:38.100]  multiple cannabinoid constituents as well,
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:39.660]  and then actually go and try them
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:43.500]  on different patients immediately, like cancer patients.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:44.580]  And that's really cool.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:47.700]  And I think pharmaceuticals and a lot of things
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:50.140]  need to get into this multivariable.
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:51.820]  Like even just from reductionists,
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:54.260]  just going to multivariable,
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:57.060]  but still reductionist style is a big step,
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:00.220]  let alone go to like full community style.
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:04.500]  Scientific analysis is light years away.
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:07.260]  I mean, it's so much more work.
[02:36:07.260 --> 02:36:10.260]  So yeah, I've seen that and I've noticed that
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:12.340]  it's we need to do the reductionist stuff,
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:15.660]  but it's kind of dead ended us into a lot of things
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:17.140]  that hurt.
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:20.380]  It's kind of maybe what brought the sterilization mindset
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:21.820]  and some of that stuff.
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:23.660]  We get scared of things in isolation.
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:26.940]  Well said, my friend, well said.
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:29.460]  Yeah, and I think that in many ways
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:34.460]  that the future will push us to explore beyond,
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:38.500]  oh, well, this one compound will cure cancer.
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:39.580]  Oh, fucking shit.
[02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:46.960]  I don't even want to go down that rabbit hole,
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:47.800]  so I'm not gonna.
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:50.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:52.120]  Let's reel it back in.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:54.400]  So I don't know, audience,
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:57.800]  do you have any further questions about IMO5?
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:01.800]  And all right, I've confused ecto, mycorrhizae,
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:03.200]  health, cannabis.
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:07.240]  All right, so you have ecto and you have endo.
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.840]  One grows on the outside of the root tips
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:12.280]  and it's usually related to conifer trees.
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:15.080]  And the other one grows into the root tissue
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:18.360]  and has a relationship of harvesting nutrients
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:19.880]  from far away,
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:22.240]  where the other one is only harvesting the nutrients
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.320]  right around the nutrient zone of the root.
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:32.120]  So basically that fungi has created a relationship
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:34.760]  with the plant over millions of years
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.320]  to process nutrients right close to that root.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.640]  So it's basically,
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.600]  think about it as a different type of rhizosphere.
[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:47.120]  That's the simplest way to look at it.
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:48.760]  So there's endo and ecto,
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:51.640]  and I highly recommend you look into it
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.080]  to better understand how to talk about these guys
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:57.920]  because yeah, one of them does not associate
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:58.800]  with the cannabis plant,
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:01.120]  it does associate with the conifers,
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:02.880]  and the other one associates with,
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.200]  I think it's like 90, 85, 90% of the plants on earth.
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:08.600]  So there's a big difference.
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:12.400]  All right, will utilizing IMO negatively affect
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.300]  your ability to regulate,
[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:19.160]  regularly pass microbe testing in regulated gardens?
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:21.360]  No, yeah, no.
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:24.760]  They're testing on leaf tissue, not soil tissue.
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:27.920]  So unless you're spraying it on your plant and flower,
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:29.800]  which I highly recommend you don't,
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:33.160]  then you're not gonna have a microbial issue.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.720]  And you wanna expand on that, Quinn?
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:38.120]  Yeah, so I don't have testing in my state.
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:40.000]  It's not what we do.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.400]  Testing also isn't very helpful
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:43.720]  when you're looking at microbial.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:46.480]  It's very, it's reductionist, right?
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:48.600]  So you're talking how many E. coli are there,
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:50.360]  not how many E. coli are there in community
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.680]  in relation to how many fungi and bacteria and flagellates.
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:56.620]  So it's just, it's not a very good system.
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:38:58.920]  But will you pass or fail?
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:38:59.840]  I don't know.
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.480]  You should be careful with spraying foliarly liquid IMO.
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:07.240]  It's very, it's very alive.
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:09.760]  So that will probably cause you to fail.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.360]  IMO 4 in your topsoil will probably not cause you to fail.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:15.320]  And then there's a big sliding scale
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.960]  in between there, for sure.
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:20.200]  I don't know, and I don't want to run you,
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:22.800]  run your business into the ground off of a hunch.
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:24.880]  I have, yeah, it's not something
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:26.400]  that I experience in my state, luckily.
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:29.840]  And it allows me to be pretty aggressive with microbes,
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.200]  which I really like.
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:35.340]  Yeah, you know, I'm, again, really frustrated
[02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:38.320]  with the biological testing system.
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.920]  Basically, they test for E. coli.
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:45.440]  Well, the vast majority of the E. colis are good.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.880]  There's only one or two particular species
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:52.060]  that can negatively affect you.
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:56.880]  And this group of bacteria have been thrown
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:01.880]  into a shit storm and used as an indicator
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:06.640]  to tell us that, oh, you have anaerobic anaerobes,
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:08.760]  so you potentially have pathogens.
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:10.040]  Potentially.
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.240]  It doesn't mean you do.
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:13.220]  It doesn't mean that they're harmful.
[02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:16.460]  It just means that potentially you have pathogens.
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:18.420]  Again, science needs to come a long way
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.820]  in better understanding this.
[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:23.380]  And the fucking microbial labs for the cannabis industry
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:25.620]  are fucking run by idiots.
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:29.320]  They got tossed into this nascent industry
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:34.320]  where we want to test for microbial contaminants
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:35.940]  on cannabis plants.
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:40.260]  Well, do you know what lives on them prior?
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:43.020]  Or, you know, do you understand the morphology,
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:48.660]  the level of microbial companions and colonies
[02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:50.980]  that live on the tissue of a plant?
[02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:52.780]  And if you don't have that,
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:54.620]  you're gonna have a really sick plant
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:55.980]  that's not gonna function.
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:58.380]  Lot of work left to be done.
[02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:01.940]  You spray a fully-latched past health Canadian test
[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:04.860]  with an 80% margin outdoor hemp crop.
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:05.980]  Okay, we'll see.
[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:07.780]  What are they testing for?
[02:41:07.780 --> 02:41:10.540]  How sophisticated are their labs?
[02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:13.060]  Are their labs being cleaned and documented?
[02:41:14.420 --> 02:41:17.500]  Are the labs pro-cannabis or pro-hemp?
[02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:19.020]  All these things take into play.
[02:41:19.020 --> 02:41:21.380]  I mean, there was a lab that got busted out here
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:26.380]  in California for sending out clean tests on hot plants.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:28.820]  Chase the money, people.
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:33.660]  There are lots of people successfully using IMOs
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.180]  and passing at scale.
[02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:38.260]  It's just not me, so I didn't really wanna
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.100]  speak on it too much,
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:40.820]  but I can totally link you with a bunch of people
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:42.340]  that are doing that.
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:45.660]  It's pretty standard practice.
[02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:51.540]  Yeah, so again, know your market,
[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:54.460]  know your environment, know who's doing your testing.
[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:57.380]  If you are forced to test,
[02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:00.100]  I highly suggest you test three labs.
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:01.980]  I know it's cost a lot more,
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:05.020]  but what you'll see will horrify you.
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:09.500]  Some will pass you, some will fail you.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:13.500]  But if you fail on one lab and you lose your crop,
[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:14.740]  there's plenty of people out there
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:16.660]  that have gotten fucked hard.
[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:19.660]  And when they've tested multiple labs,
[02:42:19.660 --> 02:42:22.140]  one comes back hot, one comes back cold.
[02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:24.780]  Now you got a case to say, fuck you to the state.
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:26.260]  I'm not knocking my plants down
[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:28.180]  and turning them into fucking dirt.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.940]  You pay for the next test.
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.860]  Let's see how many tests we need
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:36.420]  to get a fucking one way or the other opinion on this.
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:38.900]  Yeah, it's a mess.
[02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:42.100]  Hey, Lane, can I go back and touch on the
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:46.340]  KNF Soil Food Web debacle real quick?
[02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:47.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:49.700]  I love to just get my two cents in.
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:51.460]  So it's important to understand that
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.460]  I don't think that any system is better
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:54.420]  than any other system.
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.700]  I don't think there's like a right way
[02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:57.380]  to work with plants and nature,
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:59.860]  and the other way is inferior, any of that.
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:02.740]  I think that the system that Master Cho created
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:04.060]  is a beautiful piece of art,
[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:06.380]  and I wanna have that piece of art
[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:08.340]  and I wanna keep it non-adulterated.
[02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:10.580]  So like I'm very traditional
[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:12.820]  and in the way that I practice KNF,
[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:16.020]  not because I think that's the only way to do a good job,
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:18.940]  but because I value what he created
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:22.260]  and I wanna see it in its purest form
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:23.780]  before I go messing with it.
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:25.380]  So that's like my stance,
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:27.380]  just so everybody knows that I'm not like,
[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:29.540]  oh, you're mixing things together, that's wrong.
[02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:31.540]  That's totally right, it's not my style.
[02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:33.100]  So that's that.
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:38.540]  One of the main issues that we have
[02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:41.140]  with soil food web people,
[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:43.540]  which I like the soil food web, it's dope.
[02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:46.820]  I would even go too far as to consider myself
[02:43:46.820 --> 02:43:48.180]  a soil food web person,
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:50.660]  even though I don't have any qualifications.
[02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:52.460]  I have lots of friends that have taken the classes
[02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:55.180]  and love them, and I've learned a lot because of that.
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.220]  Aerobic is everything.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:03.900]  That's the pillar of a lot of what Elaine does
[02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:06.100]  because plants are aerobes, period.
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:07.260]  Humans are aerobes.
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:10.500]  A lot of what we want in this planet is aerobes.
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:15.500]  And so that is this huge core principle that is so true.
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:21.140]  At the same time, fermentation is one of the most amazing
[02:44:21.140 --> 02:44:22.780]  processes on the planet.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:26.100]  And it has been storing food and preserving food
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:28.180]  since probably before farming.
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:30.380]  I would venture that we learn to store food
[02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:32.460]  before we even learn to grow our own food,
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:34.860]  because if you couldn't store it, why would you grow it?
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:36.340]  Foraging made more sense, right?
[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:40.260]  So fermenting food is older than humanity
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.220]  because fermentation happens naturally
[02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:44.100]  in all sorts of fruits and plants.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:48.180]  So fermentation is not aerobic.
[02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:52.300]  So this is like kind of the pillar of this contradiction
[02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:56.420]  that you have where KNF is aerobic when applied
[02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:59.660]  and in practice, but some of the ways
[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:02.580]  that we make certain things are fermented,
[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:03.900]  therefore they're anaerobic.
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:08.580]  So you get this like, well, anaerobic is bad
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:11.060]  and aerobic is good.
[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:13.380]  And it's like, yeah, aerobic is good.
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:16.820]  And anaerobic is bad for plants,
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.940]  on plants and around plants.
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:20.820]  Really nobody's arguing that.
[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:23.300]  But that doesn't mean that some of these facultative
[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:25.860]  anaerobes and some of these things aren't really important
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:27.500]  for unlocking and breaking things down
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:31.460]  and can't be done correctly in a way that benefits aerobes,
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.700]  which is kind of what we're doing.
[02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:36.180]  So I think there's a lot of debate around something
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:38.140]  that no one's really disagreeing about.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:41.380]  No one is saying that aerobic isn't the best thing
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:45.620]  for plants, but that doesn't mean that anaerobes are evil
[02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:47.580]  and they don't have a place in the world.
[02:45:47.580 --> 02:45:50.620]  They're very helpful for tons of things.
[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:52.580]  And fermentation is really beautiful
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:54.420]  and aerobic is really beautiful.
[02:45:54.420 --> 02:45:56.340]  And these two things aren't in,
[02:45:56.340 --> 02:45:58.820]  they're not perpendicular to each other.
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:00.620]  They actually are synergistic.
[02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:04.900]  So I hope that nobody thinks that K and F people
[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:06.700]  hate aerobic things.
[02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:09.660]  And I don't think that people that like soy food
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:11.140]  let's hate kimchi, right?
[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:12.220]  Cause kimchi is delicious.
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:15.580]  Like these two things don't need to be contradictory.
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:19.140]  Well said, brother, well said.
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:21.500]  And I love the fact you clarified that.
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:25.620]  And I challenged the audience to think about the fact
[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:30.620]  that there are definitely anaerobic pockets in your soil.
[02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:33.460]  Definitely.
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:39.580]  And if they were so bad, then your plant would die, right?
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:44.140]  If you get a torrential rain storm,
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.900]  how much oxygen is in your aerobic environment?
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:50.220]  Very little, right?
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:54.140]  They work in conjunction.
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:57.380]  They are yin and yang.
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:46:59.860]  You really can't do one without the other.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:01.500]  They're just as important.
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:06.260]  Am I suggesting you spray nasty smelling anaerobic shit
[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:07.100]  on your plants?
[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:08.860]  No, don't do that.
[02:47:08.860 --> 02:47:09.940]  But I will tell you this,
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:13.940]  if you've ever been in Vermont in mud season,
[02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:17.460]  all the corn farmers, holy shit.
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:18.420]  Wow.
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:21.660]  The fucking lagoons that they empty
[02:47:21.660 --> 02:47:23.220]  and spray on their fields,
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:26.340]  the nastiest smelling shit you ever smelled in your life.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:29.300]  And it takes your breath away, burns your fucking eyes.
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:33.940]  But that corn will come in just fine, right?
[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:37.840]  So again, you bottleneck yourself,
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:41.180]  you pigeonhole yourself into, you know,
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:44.380]  well, it has to be aerobic or it has to be anaerobic.
[02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:45.540]  You're fucking up.
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:47.900]  You're not taking everything into consideration.
[02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:50.220]  I just want to add that two cents.
[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:52.100]  It's all about balance.
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:55.860]  You know, if you go too far one way, you're gonna screw up.
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:57.980]  If you go too far the other way, you're gonna screw up.
[02:47:57.980 --> 02:47:59.820]  Remember what Leighton's always saying,
[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:02.060]  don't be a what?
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:07.380]  I love you, Ken.
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:12.100]  All right, so I say we open this up to the audience.
[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:13.780]  We're getting to the point of three hours.
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:18.780]  So we got about, I don't know, 22 minutes left with that.
[02:48:19.180 --> 02:48:23.380]  Yeah, anyone has questions on inputs, specific inputs,
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:25.340]  do's and don'ts or, you know, whatever,
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:26.380]  feel free to bring it.
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:29.380]  We could talk about like my setup.
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:33.920]  Like I have a 15 lighter and I have a 30 by 70 greenhouse.
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:36.880]  The greenhouse is pretty much just a season extender.
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:38.260]  So very little power.
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:40.660]  I just installed a few fans, but it's, you know,
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:43.500]  it's just a conventional hoop house.
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:45.460]  It doesn't have power, it's soil floors,
[02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:47.980]  hugel trenches that I built based on,
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:50.060]  actually what Leighton told me the first time I met him,
[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:52.380]  which he was like, spray compost on everything.
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:54.860]  He's like, compost tea, everything, spray it.
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:56.860]  You see something, spray the compost tea.
[02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:00.820]  And so I was like, oh, can I spray compost tea on stuff
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:03.140]  before I make it into a hugel mound?
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:04.380]  And he's like, of course, do that.
[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:05.780]  That's the best thing I've ever heard.
[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:10.100]  So I went and we chopped down a tree to put in a power line
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:11.300]  and I sprayed the whole tree,
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:14.980]  covered the whole tree in liquid IMO multiple times.
[02:49:14.980 --> 02:49:19.100]  And then that I dug hugel trenches, 70 feet long
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:21.380]  that were gonna where my greenhouse was gonna go over top.
[02:49:21.380 --> 02:49:23.340]  And all those trenches got lined with those logs
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:26.300]  that were already growing multiple species of mushrooms.
[02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:27.620]  So that's kind of like,
[02:49:27.620 --> 02:49:29.780]  was just a mixture of everybody's recipes
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:31.620]  and Leighton's inspiration that,
[02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:32.900]  then I threw a greenhouse over.
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:36.140]  So I'm on my, I've been working on those trenches
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:37.300]  for a while and I just,
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:40.500]  last year was my second harvest after I built the greenhouse.
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:42.380]  So I had like a first greenhouse harvest.
[02:49:42.380 --> 02:49:43.220]  It was really simple.
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:45.780]  And then a second really good greenhouse harvest last year.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:46.620]  That was great.
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:49.020]  Everything went to hash rosin and full melt.
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:50.220]  And I had a great time.
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:52.660]  Everybody really enjoyed selling that.
[02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:53.980]  So I'm like fully integrated.
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:54.900]  I'm on the market.
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:57.740]  I'm like in stores, you know,
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:01.940]  I'm playing by all the rules, I'm medical.
[02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:04.100]  And I also have my 15 lighter inside
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:06.780]  where I did sips for about two years.
[02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:10.860]  And now I've been doing four by eight, you know,
[02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:13.500]  grassroots beds for about two years.
[02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:14.700]  So that's kind of the rough breakdown.
[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:17.780]  If anybody's got questions on how I do that kind of stuff.
[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:19.820]  Thank you for sharing that.
[02:50:19.820 --> 02:50:21.060]  That's wonderful.
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:23.180]  And I love the fact that you, you know,
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:25.540]  took advice from a lot of different people.
[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:28.700]  And again, you know, diversity, diversity, diversity.
[02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:31.500]  That's the key to a great start.
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.780]  Then it's pretty much, you know,
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:37.180]  as we talk about stewardship,
[02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:39.300]  not telling everything what to do,
[02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:42.260]  but just being there to steward it, keep an eye on it,
[02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:44.220]  make sure things aren't running wild
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:46.660]  or getting out of balance and, you know,
[02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:49.660]  enjoying your time and your space.
[02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:52.220]  I think that's what it's supposed to be about
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:55.100]  because it ain't work if you love what you're doing, right?
[02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:56.500]  Yeah, I can hear it.
[02:50:56.500 --> 02:50:57.460]  I can hear it.
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:50:59.100]  I can hear it in your voice.
[02:50:59.100 --> 02:51:00.260]  You love what you do.
[02:51:00.260 --> 02:51:01.540]  You're passionate about it.
[02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:03.980]  And can't wait to try some of that.
[02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.420]  I'm gonna get back East, my friend.
[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:06.260]  Where are you?
[02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:08.140]  I'm pretty far North.
[02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:09.940]  I'm like Bangor area, basically.
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:11.420]  Little North of Bangor.
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:14.740]  Okay, I was a spoiled rotten brat when I was a kid.
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:18.380]  I summered for a month in Camden on Lake McGunter Cook
[02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:22.900]  and then a month in Fortunes Rocks down in Biddeford Pool.
[02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:23.740]  Nice.
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:25.300]  I know where you're from.
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:27.380]  We could almost call you Canadian.
[02:51:27.380 --> 02:51:29.180]  You're so far North, you know.
[02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:32.980]  I'm more North than Southern Canada.
[02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:36.220]  So yeah, there's something to be said for that.
[02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:39.020]  But yeah, it's nice up here.
[02:51:39.020 --> 02:51:42.100]  Somebody asked what books do I recommend?
[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:44.740]  As far as cannabis books go, I like Robert Connell Clark.
[02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:45.660]  He's my favorite.
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:47.860]  So there's a bunch of those books.
[02:51:47.860 --> 02:51:50.820]  I just got this book and it slaps super hard.
[02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:51.780]  I'm listening to the audio.
[02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:53.580]  So this is the Art of Fermentation.
[02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:55.700]  So that's like food storage.
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:57.900]  And also it has a lot of ancient history
[02:51:57.900 --> 02:52:01.260]  of like the origins of fermentation,
[02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:03.780]  which I think is super cool.
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:05.860]  Gives you a really good broad understanding of microbes
[02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:06.960]  and how they interact.
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:10.060]  K&F, there isn't really a good book.
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.540]  Like I said, I read one of Master Cho's books,
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:14.260]  but all the ones that are translated into English
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:17.700]  are notorious for not, not just,
[02:52:17.700 --> 02:52:19.580]  it's just not a good translation.
[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:20.820]  They can help and they're good,
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:22.940]  but when a practitioner tells you like,
[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:25.180]  hey, that's not exactly the correct translation,
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:26.660]  like listen to them, be respectful
[02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:30.960]  because those translations are notoriously bad.
[02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:32.640]  And that was something that Chris had to like
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:33.800]  really steer me straight on.
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:36.320]  Cause I was really like, oh, I'm sticking to the book.
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:37.160]  And it's like, well, yeah,
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.760]  but that's not the book cause you can't read Korean.
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:42.200]  And it's like, oh yeah, good point.
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:44.000]  So that's something to keep in mind.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  Yeah, I haven't dived into a lot of microbial books yet.
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.320]  Like I haven't read any of the teeming
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:54.520]  with microbes or anything.
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:56.300]  So those are still on my docket,
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:58.200]  but Robert Carl Clarke has three books.
[02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:00.600]  They're all really amazing.
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:03.520]  Marijuana Botany is probably the best one to start with.
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:06.040]  It's like overall has a lot of breeding.
[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:08.240]  It's like pretty breeding heavy, which I really like,
[02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:11.200]  has all the punnett squares and explains F1 generations
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:13.280]  and back crosses and really gets you going
[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:15.000]  on all of that stuff and understanding like
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.200]  recessive traits and how to lock them down.
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:20.560]  And you know, things like that also doesn't really,
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:22.560]  it's pretty rudimentary as far as like
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:26.160]  growing methodology goes, but that's okay.
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:29.000]  If you're already doing K and F and soil food web
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.520]  and living soil and microbes,
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:31.920]  you probably don't really need much help there.
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:34.040]  So the actual cannabis knowledge
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:36.640]  and the genetic knowledge is probably more helpful.
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:40.840]  Yeah, so I guess, you know, those are probably my,
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:43.600]  you know, my books I would start with.
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:46.140]  There isn't really good Korean natural farming book.
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:50.520]  One of my teachers, Sherry, she's an amazing teacher.
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:53.240]  She was taught directly by Master Cho,
[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:54.800]  been a huge inspiration.
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:57.920]  She's in the process of writing a small book,
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:01.880]  like intro kind of K and F structure book
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:03.880]  is really, really good.
[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:05.320]  Every time I read some of it,
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:07.440]  I get like anxious and have to go do,
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:09.920]  I'm like, oh crap, I gotta go do stuff.
[02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:12.440]  Like it's so rivetingly inspirational
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:14.320]  and like such a good call to action.
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:15.880]  And it's a really nice read.
[02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:17.500]  And it's very similar to Master Cho's book.
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:20.820]  It's not particularly long, like maybe 80 pages,
[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:24.480]  really light reading, really read smooth,
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:27.080]  not trying to be more complicated than it needs to be.
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:31.320]  It's a nice fundamental, like more of a manual,
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:33.640]  you know, more of a field manual.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:37.520]  Yeah, so those are, I guess, some of my book recommendations.
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:41.320]  Quinn, there's a question in the chat about JDOM.
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:43.680]  Do you do any JDOM solutions?
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.680]  Yeah, so I'm not like huge on JDOM.
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:49.840]  Generally speaking, I won't really let,
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:52.580]  allow people to bring JDOM things to my property.
[02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:56.220]  My property is like been, I've been doing IMOs for a while.
[02:54:56.260 --> 02:54:57.720]  It's kind of a step backwards.
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:00.060]  If I were to go to like a third world country,
[02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:02.180]  I would totally be using JDOM.
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:05.140]  It definitely has amazing places.
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:09.380]  You know, that said, I'm not here to say like,
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:12.240]  oh, JDOM is right and KNF is wrong or any of that.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:13.540]  But just, I really appreciate it
[02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:14.780]  when people keep them separate
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:16.980]  and are clear about which one they're talking about
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:18.340]  because they're not the same.
[02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:21.080]  And they're really not even interchangeable or overlappable.
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:23.900]  They're extremely different in many ways
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:25.880]  when you really get into practicing them,
[02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:27.540]  you start to notice that.
[02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:29.720]  What I have done, I've spent a lot of time
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.680]  on the pesticide applications of the JDOM portion.
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:38.680]  So KNF doesn't really have very many pesticide protocols.
[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:42.800]  So a lot of, Chris just teaches like,
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:44.160]  hey, we just adopt, you know,
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:46.120]  a lot of the JDOM pesticides, they work great.
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:48.860]  We can tailor them a little bit for what we need.
[02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:50.040]  So I got pretty into those.
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:53.440]  I spent about a year just like dialing them in,
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:55.840]  practicing that, making all the things.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.320]  I just stuck with the JHS.
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:02.000]  So the JDOM herbal solution, the JHS
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.460]  and the JWA, the JDOM wetting agent.
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:06.960]  What I was actually able to do
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:09.320]  that was helpful for the community
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.320]  was I was actually able to successfully jar my JHSs
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.780]  in mason jars for long-term storage.
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:22.520]  And I now have had lots of JHSs for over a year
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:24.920]  and was able to keep them for long-term storage.
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:27.240]  So I hope that that doesn't mean
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:29.240]  that people start immediately selling them,
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:32.760]  but also selling them isn't the worst thing in the world.
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:35.320]  But I do hope that that helps farmers
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:39.040]  have an easier time farming because, yeah,
[02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:42.600]  because it's really annoying when you make a bunch of stuff
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:45.560]  and spend a bunch of time and it all spoils.
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:47.200]  So yeah, so I hope that helps.
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.840]  And it's exactly as easy as you think it is,
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:53.960]  but it's just glass is really expensive in Korea.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.600]  So I think we were, somewhere in the translation,
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:56:57.960]  it was like, don't do this.
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:00.600]  And what they meant is kind of like that didn't work for us
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:01.760]  rather than don't do it.
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:03.520]  So basically, you know, boil your,
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:05.460]  make your JHS the normal way you would,
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:07.240]  boil it for a few hours,
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:09.800]  and then you can pour directly into mason jars.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:11.920]  As long as you pour slow, they won't crack.
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:15.720]  And then you can double boil those in a water bath
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:17.720]  and just can them like you regularly would.
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.000]  I did about two, three hour boil on each, you know,
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.400]  on each round of jars.
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.600]  And yeah, and they're still good.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:25.760]  They still keep.
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:27.600]  I drink them usually when I open them,
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:29.040]  which I might stop doing.
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  I did some experiments with some salt and some vinegars
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:33.440]  to see if I would have better.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:35.360]  So I did seven jars.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:36.520]  One was a control.
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:38.800]  The other one had two different amounts of salt
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:40.680]  and the other one had two different amounts of vinegar.
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:42.120]  Something along those lines.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:44.800]  I have it documented somewhere, I think.
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:46.160]  That was something I went over with Kobe.
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:49.120]  Kobe is my original, one of my original soil smiths
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:51.400]  and someone that's just been a huge inspiration
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:54.000]  and like a peer and a teacher at the same time,
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:57.320]  which just makes our relationship and ability to learn,
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.160]  I feel just like really impressive.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.920]  So he like, I threw out him some ideas.
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:03.960]  He threw me back some ideas
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:05.280]  and he kind of witnessed the process
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.000]  and make sure I wasn't gonna blow myself up.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:09.800]  And yeah, so that was really cool.
[02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:11.880]  The result was everything was null and void.
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:14.560]  All of them jarred and preserved fine.
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:17.440]  So there was no noticeable benefit
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:19.600]  between the salt vinegar and the controls.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:20.440]  So yeah.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:22.960]  Interesting, interesting.
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:23.800]  Well, thank you for sharing that.
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:26.760]  I mean, that's important for people to understand.
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:29.800]  And yeah, if you get into a pinch
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:32.360]  and you are in a living soil system,
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:34.840]  you have solutions with some of these
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:37.720]  to fight back the pest pressure.
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.560]  Whereas before you really didn't.
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:41.400]  You had to suffer it, you had to use sulfur,
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:44.200]  you had to use pesticides, whatever.
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:47.320]  So these are valuable tools
[02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:49.760]  and I recommend the audience pick up
[02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:53.400]  on your IG account so that if they get in a pinch,
[02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:55.120]  they can order some of this stuff
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:58.880]  and get it overnighted and deal with the pressure
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:00.400]  before it gets out of control.
[02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:04.760]  Yeah, well said, Leighton.
[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:07.160]  Yeah, and then reach out or whatever,
[02:59:07.160 --> 02:59:09.320]  or whatever, we'll get in touch.
[02:59:09.320 --> 02:59:12.200]  There's a big clubhouse every Wednesday.
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:13.440]  It's a K&F clubhouse.
[02:59:13.440 --> 02:59:14.640]  There's a bunch of them.
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:17.080]  I prefer the second one.
[02:59:17.080 --> 02:59:17.920]  The first one's cool.
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:20.680]  It's a little more, someone is teaching
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:22.360]  and everyone else is kind of going through them.
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:24.160]  The second one is more open.
[02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:25.000]  It's more community.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:26.120]  It has a little more of a,
[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:30.440]  we're talking across to each other rather than up and down.
[02:59:30.440 --> 02:59:31.480]  I prefer it that way.
[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:33.840]  Sometimes I prefer a teacher-student atmosphere.
[02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:36.120]  This is like everyone's a teacher-student atmosphere
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:37.640]  in the second one.
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:39.200]  So you can reach out to me and I can plug you in there.
[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:40.560]  And that's a great place to bring your questions.
[02:59:40.560 --> 02:59:42.600]  So it's not just like me answering them.
[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:44.480]  You're getting diversity.
[02:59:44.480 --> 02:59:46.480]  You're getting the community to answer them.
[02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:48.760]  That's a great place to be.
[02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:50.880]  The question I believe was about Bokashi.
[02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:53.360]  I have never made Bokashi.
[02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:56.040]  So I can't answer your Bokashi question,
[02:59:56.040 --> 02:59:57.240]  but I like Bokashi.
[02:59:57.240 --> 02:59:58.320]  I think it's awesome.
[02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.160]  I just haven't gotten there.
[03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:02.480]  Well, it's funny.
[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:05.440]  Bokashi, like fermentation, is an anaerobic process.
[03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:07.440]  So I would see, tend to think
[03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:09.800]  that they're probably very parallel.
[03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:13.920]  And was that clubhouse ask any K&F question?
[03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:14.840]  Yeah, so there's a few.
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:17.080]  She's like, ask any K&F question.
[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:21.080]  And then Kobe and like me and a bunch of people
[03:00:21.080 --> 03:00:23.480]  all moderate the one after,
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:26.600]  which is just like the K&F and JDAM something.
[03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:30.040]  I think it's like called K&F and JDAM class
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:32.880]  or K&F and JDAM conversation, something like that.
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:34.240]  And they usually happen back to back.
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:37.280]  So you can just do both in a row, which is what I recommend.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:39.880]  And I usually try to do both when I can,
[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:42.280]  but I especially try to be there for the second one.
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:43.120]  I really like it.
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:45.400]  Nice, nice.
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:49.680]  Yeah, that's a great resource for people
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:51.720]  who wanna hear a little bit more
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:55.000]  or get a little bit of a deeper understanding
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.680]  about the potential and the processes
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.400]  and the value of these things.
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.000]  So dude, I can't thank you enough for today, Quinn.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:03.360]  You've been an amazing guest.
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:07.080]  And then Ken, as always, thank you, brother, for chopping on.
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:09.120]  I love your inputs and your questions.
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:11.400]  I think you really kind of dig and probe
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:14.520]  a little bit deeper into areas that need to be discussed.
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:17.440]  So I think Peter's gone, right?
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:21.120]  No, Peter, well, I don't know if Peter's still around.
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:22.840]  His picture's still up.
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:25.160]  Brian's gone, but Quinn, I wanted to say
[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:26.440]  thank you very much, brother.
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:28.080]  That was fantastic.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:31.320]  And your last thing about the clubhouse,
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:35.240]  guys, listen to as many voices as you can,
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:37.760]  then make your own decisions.
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:39.160]  But I don't know if you guys want,
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.840]  there was a couple more questions.
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:42.280]  Are you guys ready?
[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:43.840]  I'm sure Leighton's ready for lunch
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:46.120]  and the dog's ready to go for a run.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:50.880]  Yeah, he's, three hours, I'm pushing it.
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:51.720]  Yeah.
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:55.200]  Might start chewing on your leg.
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:56.680]  Yeah, speak of the devil, right?
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.720]  He's like, dad, it's time.
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:02.280]  He knows, he's got a better clock than I do, right?
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.320]  So Quinn, if you wanna, that's your IG up on the screen
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:10.120]  at professors underscore Q.
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:13.600]  And yeah, people reach out.
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:15.080]  Quinn will help you,
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:17.080]  direct you to the right places on clubhouse.
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:18.840]  Don't be shy, people.
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:20.520]  You know, learn, learn, learn,
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:23.640]  and just don't ever stop learning.
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:26.000]  No, can't, you stagnate.
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:27.880]  That's no good.
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:28.720]  We're not fun.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:30.600]  Thank you guys.
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:31.760]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:33.640]  This is super cool.
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:35.720]  As Leighton was one of my first teachers,
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:37.800]  this is very surreal for him to give a crap
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:39.680]  about what I think.
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:43.640]  It's really full circle, so glad to help.
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:46.280]  And this stuff really works.
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.280]  Like I'm really running a, I mean, a very successful,
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.280]  very fun, very small boutique business.
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:55.120]  People go crazy about my products.
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:56.400]  They drive up from New York.
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:59.640]  I mean, people really enjoy this stuff.
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:02.200]  So the stuff really, really does work.
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:05.320]  And when you put your all into it, I think it shows up.
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:07.800]  And I think people taste it and they feel it
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:09.360]  and they notice it.
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:11.800]  So everybody keep after it.
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:12.760]  We're all doing great.
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:15.160]  And I'm still learning with everybody.
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:16.560]  So thank you guys for having me on the show.
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:17.560]  I really appreciate it.
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:18.560]  This is awesome.
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:20.560]  I'm sure you'll be back again, my friend.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:23.080]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:24.840]  Oh, there's Mr. Peter.
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:25.680]  There he is.
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:28.480]  All right, I know, Poe, I know.
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:30.200]  We're gonna get to go soon.
[03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:31.040]  I know.
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:32.320]  Are we wrapping?
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:33.800]  We are wrapping.
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:34.720]  Amazing.
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:36.080]  That was awesome.
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:37.120]  Yeah, that was a great show.
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:38.920]  Thank you, Quinn, and thank you, Ken.
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:43.160]  You were in Connecticut before?
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:46.160]  Me?
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:47.720]  Yeah, I've been pretty all over.
[03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:49.000]  I've pretty well traveled.
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:51.480]  I lived in Connecticut for a year.
[03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:52.520]  I lived in Florida for a year.
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:55.000]  I lived in Cali for like a year and a half.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.640]  Pennsylvania, I grew up in Pennsylvania.
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:00.360]  So I spent a lot of time there.
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:01.400]  You know, been all over.
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:03.440]  But me and Leighton saw each other
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:07.360]  at the Connecticut KNF class in 2019.
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:08.480]  That was my first class.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.560]  That was like another place we bumped shoulders.
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:14.520]  And yeah, I asked,
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:16.240]  because you had mentioned Connecticut earlier
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:19.320]  and my brothers between Rhode Island and Connecticut.
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:21.880]  So I was like, oh, cool, I should connect them.
[03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:22.760]  Oh, nice.
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:25.520]  Yeah, we have a pretty good New England,
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:26.480]  oh, the Cape Cod.
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:28.360]  I'll be at the Cape Cod class.
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:33.360]  Chris's KNF Cape Cod class, October 3rd through the 7th.
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:37.120]  So if anybody wants to come there and throw IMOs at me,
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.520]  I'll be there.
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:40.360]  And yeah, that'd be cool.
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:43.160]  So I recommend people go in if they wanna learn
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:44.480]  those five-day classes.
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:45.520]  They slap so hard.
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:47.560]  Like you learn so much.
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:49.480]  They're not, you can't get that stuff in a book.
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:51.080]  You can't get that stuff online.
[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:55.760]  It's smells and tastes and friends that last forever.
[03:04:57.560 --> 03:04:58.840]  Nice, nice plug.
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.000]  All right, Peter, what did you just pull out
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:03.680]  your lunch there, buddy?
[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:04.520]  I did.
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:07.960]  It's a chicken burrito,
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:12.400]  which I am very, very excited to destroy.
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:18.720]  Now just speaking of the Cape,
[03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:22.160]  Hota Erb will probably, I assume, be at that same event.
[03:05:22.160 --> 03:05:25.880]  And he's going live tonight, probably with Nick,
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:27.680]  and I'm totally blanking on the topic,
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:30.720]  but that's at six Pacific time night.
[03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:32.480]  Awesome.
[03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:34.000]  And that's all I got.
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:38.320]  Well then on no other housekeeping,
[03:05:38.320 --> 03:05:40.400]  let's go right into the count, Peter.
