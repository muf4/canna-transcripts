[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  And the toque was huge.
[00:01.360 --> 00:03.040]  That was a poor choice.
[00:03.040 --> 00:04.560]  This is London, and unfortunately, I
[00:04.560 --> 00:07.840]  took a very large dab moments before turning the thing on,
[00:07.840 --> 00:11.320]  and I did not take a sip of water first to settle myself.
[00:11.320 --> 00:13.080]  So how are you doing, Mr. Trees?
[00:13.080 --> 00:14.640]  How is your fall looking?
[00:14.640 --> 00:18.160]  It's freaking hot and smoky down there, no?
[00:18.160 --> 00:20.360]  Yeah, man, it definitely is.
[00:20.360 --> 00:24.040]  We finally just telling Coastal we were getting
[00:24.040 --> 00:26.200]  rain the last couple of days.
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.480]  And yeah, some stuff had to come in.
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.960]  Some stuff had to get covered.
[00:34.960 --> 00:37.680]  Drains had to get cleared that haven't been cleared forever.
[00:37.680 --> 00:39.360]  I started digging my trenches again
[00:39.360 --> 00:43.560]  to get my water to move around a little bit better.
[00:43.560 --> 00:45.040]  Everything got filled up.
[00:45.040 --> 00:46.360]  So I've been working my butt off.
[00:46.360 --> 00:49.320]  I was up on the roof, spraying the roof in little places,
[00:49.320 --> 00:51.400]  making sure I wasn't going to get any leaks, because, man,
[00:51.400 --> 00:53.040]  we're in the desert, dude.
[00:53.040 --> 00:53.920]  It doesn't rain here.
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.200]  So when it does, it causes a little bit of a ruckus.
[01:01.880 --> 01:03.560]  Kind of fun, but kind of scary.
[01:06.200 --> 01:07.120]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[01:07.120 --> 01:08.440]  I don't like it when it rains.
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.200]  That's always something.
[01:11.200 --> 01:12.760]  Yeah, I enjoy it.
[01:12.760 --> 01:14.720]  How's your outdoor crop been this year?
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.200]  I mean, you had that heat swell.
[01:16.200 --> 01:18.760]  You've got some rain recently.
[01:18.760 --> 01:21.440]  We had a really rainy, kind of shitty June.
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.000]  And I remember talking to a lot of the California farmers
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.240]  in June.
[01:26.240 --> 01:29.240]  And there was like, even the DM farmers are like, fuck,
[01:29.240 --> 01:30.080]  we have pithium.
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.480]  We have not pithium, but we have white powdery mildew already.
[01:33.480 --> 01:34.480]  We're in veg.
[01:34.480 --> 01:37.120]  It's been such a stressed out fucking time.
[01:37.120 --> 01:38.200]  It was so wet.
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.360]  It was so moist that it wasn't very good.
[01:42.360 --> 01:44.240]  And now it's quite the opposite.
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.240]  We're having a very late summer kind of roll through here
[01:47.240 --> 01:49.080]  on the West Coast.
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.240]  It seems to be happening here as well.
[01:52.240 --> 01:55.840]  We got a smoky day today, but how is it going?
[01:55.840 --> 01:56.840]  What's it looking like?
[01:56.840 --> 01:58.920]  Are you happy with your outdoor crop?
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.960]  I toured Sun Grown Mids Garden recently.
[02:01.960 --> 02:04.760]  And those plants are beautiful, huge, and happy.
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.960]  So I imagine the weather is not doing too badly for you.
[02:08.960 --> 02:10.200]  No, man.
[02:10.200 --> 02:13.280]  I've been real fortunate.
[02:13.280 --> 02:16.840]  I'm in a good magic place where things
[02:16.840 --> 02:19.360]  tend to grow pretty well.
[02:19.360 --> 02:25.800]  As long as I do a couple of things on time and in order,
[02:25.800 --> 02:29.240]  I usually have a pretty darn good turnout.
[02:29.240 --> 02:33.560]  I rarely have like, you know, bud rot problems or powdery
[02:33.560 --> 02:36.160]  mildew anymore.
[02:36.160 --> 02:38.400]  As soon as I eliminated, you know,
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.360]  budworm issues and stuff, that pretty much solved
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.920]  90% of my outdoor problems.
[02:46.920 --> 02:51.640]  I had a great royal cush, pure cush out there
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.480]  that got big and beautiful and super early and really,
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.480]  really impressive.
[02:57.480 --> 03:00.440]  I have a couple other things that I was really happy about.
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.120]  My green, I have a greenhouse that has some vegetables
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.840]  and some cannabis and stuff in there.
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.880]  And it was like 115, 116 degrees inside the greenhouse
[03:11.880 --> 03:13.920]  for a good week.
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.520]  And that pissed off some of the inside greenhouse plants.
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.840]  You know, you can't move enough air through there as cleanly.
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.440]  So nothing bad, nothing out of control,
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.760]  or no like rotten branches or anything.
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.200]  But you can tell that the plants just started,
[03:35.200 --> 03:38.640]  just leaves started getting tired quicker.
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.680]  And they're just starting to yellow up
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.120]  and wanting to finish up way too early and stuff like that.
[03:44.120 --> 03:45.600]  You know what I mean?
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.160]  It'll still be killer chronic.
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.040]  And I'm not worried about it in that regard.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.880]  But it's like, it could have been better
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.240]  if it was 85 degrees in there the whole time.
[03:57.240 --> 03:58.200]  You know what I mean?
[03:58.200 --> 03:59.640]  You can move a little bit more air.
[03:59.640 --> 04:00.520]  But we were hot, man.
[04:00.520 --> 04:02.280]  We had that heat wave come through.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.960]  And it was friggin' blistering hot.
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.160]  My phone has just been ringing off the hook from everybody.
[04:07.160 --> 04:09.240]  Like, my avocados are burnt up.
[04:09.280 --> 04:11.040]  My mangoes are burning up.
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.880]  Like, everybody's trees are just fucking,
[04:13.880 --> 04:15.240]  just wilting in the sun.
[04:15.240 --> 04:15.840]  You know what I mean?
[04:15.840 --> 04:18.080]  Everything is just getting torched, you know?
[04:18.080 --> 04:19.000]  So.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.520]  That's happening out here.
[04:20.520 --> 04:22.280]  We're like getting hammered.
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.400]  And I've told my wife, she's trying it for the first time.
[04:25.400 --> 04:27.880]  Grew pumpkins.
[04:27.880 --> 04:32.200]  And I've told her she needs to mist them every day.
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.160]  Not water them every day, but mist them every day.
[04:35.160 --> 04:37.280]  And it's the same thing with all the other plants we're growing.
[04:37.280 --> 04:39.680]  We're growing bananas and a whole bunch of other shit.
[04:39.680 --> 04:40.560]  And it's like.
[04:40.560 --> 04:42.360]  The swings in the temperature is the same.
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.320]  The temperature changes are just, yeah.
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.360]  Yeah, she was saying that swings in the temperature are insane.
[04:47.360 --> 04:50.080]  And it's like, yeah, it's just, it's way too much.
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.480]  And yeah, you have to just mist them.
[04:53.480 --> 04:56.200]  You have to mist the plants all the time.
[04:56.200 --> 04:58.840]  Maybe once or twice a day.
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.520]  Just a light mist.
[05:00.520 --> 05:03.880]  Just like fully or at least, not feed them,
[05:03.880 --> 05:06.480]  but just give them water.
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.080]  And it kind of is like, it eases them.
[05:09.080 --> 05:12.520]  It's like it massages them back to being healthy.
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.960]  But I feel like.
[05:14.960 --> 05:18.000]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.760]  I was just saying, I feel like that's the only way to really do it.
[05:21.760 --> 05:24.600]  Like, if you try to water them, you're just going to overwater them.
[05:24.600 --> 05:26.520]  So, you know.
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.760]  Yeah, it's like I can't keep any, you know,
[05:28.760 --> 05:30.480]  you can't keep enough water in the ground.
[05:30.480 --> 05:32.680]  You know, the hot air is thirsty air.
[05:32.680 --> 05:33.360]  You know what I mean?
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.880]  It just fucking sucks everything out of every pore here, you know.
[05:37.880 --> 05:43.920]  So it's like, you know, especially good mulch practices.
[05:43.920 --> 05:47.480]  You know, a lot of cardboard, a lot of mulch, a lot of, you know,
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.520]  a lot of compost, stuff like that really helps out in the garden when things are rough.
[05:52.520 --> 05:58.200]  But man, let me tell you, it has been friggin' hot and miserable.
[05:58.200 --> 05:59.440]  And there's not a lot you can do.
[05:59.440 --> 06:03.120]  Like, even with the trees, there's not a lot you can fix, you know, when it's just that hot.
[06:03.160 --> 06:03.640]  It sucks.
[06:03.640 --> 06:06.040]  You know, still light up there.
[06:06.040 --> 06:06.600]  Look at that.
[06:06.600 --> 06:06.880]  Ooh.
[06:06.880 --> 06:09.320]  Power, power cam.
[06:09.320 --> 06:09.480]  Yeah.
[06:09.480 --> 06:16.320]  We got some plants for you.
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.920]  You guys here.
[06:17.920 --> 06:18.200]  All right.
[06:18.200 --> 06:20.000]  Let me adjust this layout.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.960]  Boom. All right.
[06:24.960 --> 06:26.520]  Can you hear me all right?
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:27.760 --> 06:34.640]  So on the right here, we have one big old Acapulco Gold Barney Farms that I've been running for a while.
[06:34.640 --> 06:43.120]  And then in the back here, we have a whole bunch of various stuff from Ryan Lee Chimera Genetics.
[06:43.120 --> 06:53.000]  And then I have, this is my Acapulco Gold, the Golden Lemon Cross, very kind of cool, funky shape.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.920]  It's at about, I think about week 10 right now.
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.920]  But she's starting to shape up and thicken up on the bottom too.
[07:02.920 --> 07:05.240]  So she's looking pretty nice.
[07:05.240 --> 07:09.520]  Got like this lovely lemon smell and like lemon and wood.
[07:09.520 --> 07:19.010]  But we got like, these are my, let me see if I can, I'll reverse the camera so I can give you guys maybe a proportional.
[07:19.010 --> 07:22.850]  Can you hear me all right?
[07:22.850 --> 07:23.290]  Yep.
[07:23.290 --> 07:23.570]  Yep.
[07:23.570 --> 07:24.570]  You're coming through clean.
[07:24.570 --> 07:26.570]  Right.
[07:26.570 --> 07:28.570]  So.
[07:28.570 --> 07:29.330]  Hell yeah.
[07:29.330 --> 07:31.330]  There it is.
[07:31.330 --> 07:36.210]  That's level-ish with my head.
[07:36.210 --> 07:41.330]  So it's about, I don't know, it's tall, eh?
[07:41.330 --> 07:46.090]  Yeah.
[07:46.090 --> 07:51.620]  Come on, let's switch it back.
[07:51.620 --> 07:57.330]  That's a good little hedge right there for sure.
[07:57.330 --> 08:01.650]  Little peakers.
[08:01.690 --> 08:05.130]  Starting to form up.
[08:05.130 --> 08:13.410]  I've stripped it hard and it's pretty much been stripped all the way to like my chin height.
[08:13.410 --> 08:14.970]  Some leaf hoppers and stuff in here.
[08:14.970 --> 08:24.650]  But what's fun, and I got to be careful not to fuck myself up here and spread it around, but can you see what's going on here?
[08:24.650 --> 08:26.330]  Oh, look at that, little male action.
[08:26.330 --> 08:26.650]  Yeah.
[08:26.650 --> 08:28.010]  Yeah.
[08:28.010 --> 08:35.050]  All of these ginormous plants are.
[08:35.050 --> 08:37.130]  Oh, there's going to be donors, huh?
[08:37.130 --> 08:38.850]  Nice.
[08:38.850 --> 08:46.450]  So I've got like some really cool funky stuff in here and you can see some are further along.
[08:46.450 --> 08:48.690]  Some are a bit younger.
[08:48.690 --> 08:52.290]  I got a few.
[08:52.290 --> 08:52.730]  That's cool.
[08:52.730 --> 08:53.290]  What males are those?
[08:53.290 --> 09:00.770]  You got to live in a greenhouse because then you get to fucking sleep in the plants.
[09:00.770 --> 09:02.370]  Yeah.
[09:02.370 --> 09:05.730]  I've got a greenhouse full of them, so I don't need to do that.
[09:05.730 --> 09:08.170]  My wife would say.
[09:08.170 --> 09:09.610]  For guarding them.
[09:09.610 --> 09:10.250]  Yeah.
[09:10.250 --> 09:15.490]  Also, yeah, my wife would just say like, yeah, it's also works for guarding them too.
[09:15.490 --> 09:15.810]  Yeah.
[09:15.810 --> 09:16.090]  Yeah.
[09:16.090 --> 09:17.490]  That's it right there.
[09:17.490 --> 09:21.650]  There's been a lot of tent nights in my life.
[09:21.650 --> 09:23.650]  That's a.
[09:23.650 --> 09:24.250]  So he does it.
[09:24.250 --> 09:26.250]  So he's the Tiva.
[09:26.250 --> 09:33.850]  Right there, that's how in there, which is even locked over in the front is.
[09:33.850 --> 09:36.890]  Is pine, jack pine.
[09:36.890 --> 09:42.090]  We have snaz in the back corner here and we have some lemon cello in between.
[09:42.090 --> 09:44.970]  We got some wrapper weed.
[09:44.970 --> 09:48.370]  And in the back, we got velvet sky.
[09:48.370 --> 09:50.850]  Way in the back corner there.
[09:50.850 --> 10:00.250]  Kind of small comparison and like then we got this monster.
[10:00.250 --> 10:01.810]  Wow, that's killer.
[10:01.810 --> 10:03.930]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[10:03.930 --> 10:05.970]  It's it's fallen over a couple of times.
[10:05.970 --> 10:09.650]  I've come up in the morning.
[10:09.650 --> 10:12.170]  Yeah.
[10:12.170 --> 10:16.810]  It's so nice to check these out.
[10:16.810 --> 10:20.170]  Yeah, it's a little black pearls or some black princes or something.
[10:20.170 --> 10:25.710]  Yeah, those are cool.
[10:25.710 --> 10:34.110]  I like the I like I like those crimson black, those like the black crimmies and those funny little black and red ones, those ones are cool.
[10:34.110 --> 10:35.270]  Yeah, back creamy.
[10:35.270 --> 10:37.110]  You got it right on the button there.
[10:37.110 --> 10:37.790]  There you go.
[10:37.790 --> 10:40.630]  Yeah, there's a couple of different ones.
[10:40.630 --> 10:43.070]  But yeah, I've grown a lot of those different ones over the years.
[10:43.070 --> 10:44.190]  You know, they're good.
[10:44.190 --> 10:45.710]  I like them.
[10:46.710 --> 10:51.550]  I'll show you the inside of the greenhouse where there's a little bit more lighting.
[10:51.550 --> 10:54.910]  Dude, you're like full on sunny outside right now.
[10:54.910 --> 10:55.870]  It's wild how.
[10:55.870 --> 10:56.550]  No, it's not.
[10:56.550 --> 10:58.750]  How much how much farther along?
[10:58.750 --> 11:02.030]  Dude, it's pitch black outside.
[11:02.030 --> 11:04.590]  We get like 14 hours of light down here.
[11:04.590 --> 11:07.110]  You know, you're like ripping up there still.
[11:07.110 --> 11:09.190]  That's that's cool.
[11:09.190 --> 11:11.790]  How many hours of light?
[11:11.790 --> 11:12.910]  Like when does it go dark?
[11:13.070 --> 11:14.750]  How many hours a day do you get sunshine?
[11:14.750 --> 11:26.750]  But we're still we're still we don't have like we're eight to eight, essentially like it's going to set hard and quick and have much light soon.
[11:26.750 --> 11:28.270]  Gotcha.
[11:28.270 --> 11:29.150]  Eight to eight.
[11:29.150 --> 11:29.830]  Is that what it is?
[11:29.830 --> 11:30.350]  Gotcha.
[11:32.790 --> 11:40.790]  See the one variety I've been trying to it's so not dominant, but there she is.
[11:40.910 --> 11:44.910]  One purple one out of all my weight.
[11:44.910 --> 11:46.910]  That's cool.
[11:46.910 --> 11:49.510]  I got some.
[11:49.510 --> 11:51.590]  Abby, go inside, please.
[11:51.590 --> 11:52.830]  Go on inside.
[11:52.830 --> 11:53.430]  Go on.
[11:53.430 --> 11:54.750]  Go on.
[11:54.750 --> 11:55.270]  I don't know.
[11:55.270 --> 11:55.750]  Go on.
[12:04.220 --> 12:04.940]  Nice.
[12:13.020 --> 12:14.540]  Just trying to not create an echo.
[12:14.540 --> 12:15.140]  There you go.
[12:15.140 --> 12:17.980]  And then I got this is all freaking going nuts.
[12:18.060 --> 12:20.900]  These are just fresh pop and transplants.
[12:20.900 --> 12:21.940]  But can you hear me?
[12:21.940 --> 12:23.380]  Okay, still?
[12:23.380 --> 12:23.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:23.940 --> 12:24.940]  Doing good.
[12:24.940 --> 12:26.300]  I got my shoes on.
[12:26.300 --> 12:26.500]  Yeah.
[12:26.500 --> 12:27.300]  Indoor shoes.
[12:27.300 --> 12:29.100]  Can you see my bears?
[12:29.100 --> 12:30.140]  Oh, sweet.
[12:30.140 --> 12:33.860]  Yep.
[12:33.860 --> 12:35.180]  There you go.
[12:35.180 --> 12:36.300]  So is that some Mrs.
[12:36.300 --> 12:37.820]  Stripe, please?
[12:37.820 --> 12:43.220]  Yeah, some cool red variety.
[12:43.220 --> 12:46.500]  And then peppers are really nice.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.100]  No, I can't help you.
[12:48.100 --> 12:48.500]  We're out.
[12:48.500 --> 12:49.540]  You ate all of them.
[12:49.540 --> 12:52.500]  We ate all of the donuts.
[12:52.500 --> 12:55.020]  Here's a really cool.
[12:55.020 --> 12:56.140]  That sounds like my house.
[12:56.140 --> 13:00.580]  Here's a really cool freaking variety of donuts.
[13:00.580 --> 13:04.380]  There's always a couple of donuts held back.
[13:04.380 --> 13:07.020]  It's an old heirloom variety.
[13:07.020 --> 13:07.500]  Oh.
[13:07.500 --> 13:08.740]  Going nuts.
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.820]  That's sweet.
[13:09.820 --> 13:14.740]  I just harvested some of the huskless seed melons,
[13:14.740 --> 13:16.540]  the ones that have no shell, basically.
[13:16.940 --> 13:20.140]  They're perfect for making pumpkin seeds,
[13:20.140 --> 13:22.140]  like pumpkins that don't have husks on the seed.
[13:22.140 --> 13:23.460]  They're huskless.
[13:23.460 --> 13:25.740]  So I'm really stoked on melons, man.
[13:25.740 --> 13:26.820]  I love melons.
[13:26.820 --> 13:27.900]  Jalapeno, nice.
[13:27.900 --> 13:29.820]  Good work.
[13:29.820 --> 13:32.820]  Pretty good.
[13:32.820 --> 13:33.340]  I can't tell.
[13:33.340 --> 13:34.820]  You can tell they're in a greenhouse
[13:34.820 --> 13:36.300]  because they've got big fat leaves.
[13:36.300 --> 13:42.430]  I've got lots of them.
[13:42.430 --> 13:46.270]  Now you can tell your leaves are huge.
[13:46.270 --> 13:49.030]  Down here, the pepper leaves are so small
[13:49.070 --> 13:50.950]  because it's so fucking hot and dry.
[13:50.950 --> 13:52.270]  It's like a different world.
[13:52.270 --> 13:53.910]  You can tell they're in a greenhouse
[13:53.910 --> 13:57.990]  and loved a little bit with lights and stuff.
[13:57.990 --> 13:58.990]  The leaves get huge.
[13:58.990 --> 13:59.990]  It's filled with mice.
[13:59.990 --> 14:03.030]  I got some more of those peppers.
[14:03.030 --> 14:05.310]  I can't wait to grow some of those out.
[14:05.310 --> 14:10.110]  I got a whole bunch gifted to me from Mrs. Coastal.
[14:10.110 --> 14:14.870]  He got me two different types of red scotch bonnets
[14:14.870 --> 14:18.430]  from Jamaica that are heirloom.
[14:18.510 --> 14:23.670]  And then a whole bunch of heirloom,
[14:23.670 --> 14:27.030]  what are they called, habaneros.
[14:27.030 --> 14:28.550]  Like, of every different color.
[14:28.550 --> 14:31.830]  And then some other peppers.
[14:31.830 --> 14:34.230]  I basically have way too many peppers to grow.
[14:34.230 --> 14:38.750]  I literally, we're setting up four greenhouses.
[14:38.750 --> 14:40.830]  Because you don't eat peppers.
[14:40.830 --> 14:44.590]  I don't really eat peppers other than scotch bonnets.
[14:44.590 --> 14:47.190]  I'll eat scotch bonnets, but that's about it.
[14:47.190 --> 14:52.190]  But yeah, I'm going to take what she has done
[14:56.470 --> 14:57.990]  and I'm just going to go with it.
[14:57.990 --> 15:00.270]  And I'm going to make a ton of them.
[15:00.270 --> 15:04.150]  And so we've got like four greenhouses
[15:04.150 --> 15:06.270]  that we're constructing.
[15:06.270 --> 15:08.910]  So right now we got like one already done
[15:08.910 --> 15:11.630]  and we got like three more to go.
[15:11.630 --> 15:13.710]  And we're just going to jam on this.
[15:13.710 --> 15:17.070]  And yeah, I'm going to put controllers in it
[15:17.950 --> 15:18.790]  and everything else.
[15:18.790 --> 15:19.830]  But yeah, like we're already living in one of them
[15:19.830 --> 15:21.230]  just for fun.
[15:21.230 --> 15:26.230]  And I just, I can't say enough about her
[15:27.830 --> 15:31.550]  and like what she has kind of pushed as an idea.
[15:31.550 --> 15:36.550]  And she is the majority of like this team, I feel.
[15:36.870 --> 15:37.950]  I just never thought.
[15:39.030 --> 15:41.390]  But she doesn't want to be on the screen, so.
[15:44.150 --> 15:45.630]  You can hear her in the background,
[15:45.630 --> 15:47.670]  but then she hits like, I don't want to.
[15:49.230 --> 15:51.150]  She's just hitting the phone right now.
[15:51.150 --> 15:51.990]  That's good, man.
[15:51.990 --> 15:52.830]  That's good, that's good.
[15:53.990 --> 15:55.110]  It's good to have good people
[15:55.110 --> 15:58.390]  that support what you're doing, you know?
[15:58.390 --> 16:00.350]  Yes, exactly.
[16:00.350 --> 16:01.550]  That's good shit, dude.
[16:02.430 --> 16:04.390]  I'm getting, I did some Tabasco peppers.
[16:04.390 --> 16:07.070]  I did some chocolate ghosts again.
[16:07.070 --> 16:09.030]  I've been growing these chocolate ghosts
[16:09.030 --> 16:10.750]  the last few years, ghost peppers.
[16:10.750 --> 16:13.190]  I'm sending some seeds to Daga too, by the way.
[16:13.190 --> 16:14.670]  So there'll be some chocolate ghost seeds
[16:14.990 --> 16:15.830]  going up there.
[16:15.830 --> 16:16.670]  Ooh, fire.
[16:16.670 --> 16:17.510]  This would be cool.
[16:19.710 --> 16:21.190]  But yeah, lots of peppers, man.
[16:21.190 --> 16:22.870]  I did the Carolina Reaper.
[16:22.870 --> 16:24.710]  It didn't do very well for us out here.
[16:24.710 --> 16:26.710]  It's just got a few peppers.
[16:26.710 --> 16:28.110]  I'm gonna try to throw it in the greenhouse
[16:28.110 --> 16:30.430]  and dig it up and bring that one in.
[16:30.430 --> 16:32.070]  It was temperamental of the heat.
[16:33.310 --> 16:37.750]  But lots of jalapenos, lots of serranos, lots of shishitos.
[16:39.790 --> 16:43.390]  Some of these small little bell peppers, you know,
[16:43.670 --> 16:47.790]  that come in like a little bag at a supermarket,
[16:47.790 --> 16:50.030]  you know, like these little teeny sweet,
[16:50.030 --> 16:51.430]  like they look like jalapenos,
[16:51.430 --> 16:52.990]  but they're like mini bell peppers,
[16:52.990 --> 16:55.710]  you know what I mean, I guess, you know, different colors.
[16:55.710 --> 16:58.550]  My kids took out a whole bunch of seeds from those
[16:58.550 --> 16:59.630]  and we grew a bunch of those.
[16:59.630 --> 17:01.710]  And those peppers kicked ass this year.
[17:01.710 --> 17:04.670]  That was like one of the best varieties that we grew,
[17:04.670 --> 17:05.510]  which was really cool.
[17:05.510 --> 17:06.350]  It was interesting.
[17:06.350 --> 17:09.470]  Came right out of the bag of the stuff from the store.
[17:10.430 --> 17:13.030]  But every year, man, I try to, you know,
[17:13.030 --> 17:15.670]  I try to save my peppers and do the hot ones.
[17:15.670 --> 17:18.670]  I just did a video eating a ghost pepper.
[17:18.670 --> 17:21.110]  So I'll post that one up for you soon.
[17:21.110 --> 17:22.830]  We were doing a little ghost pepper challenge.
[17:22.830 --> 17:24.150]  It was fun.
[17:24.150 --> 17:27.110]  But the Tabascos are worse for me
[17:27.110 --> 17:29.070]  than the ghost peppers are, you know,
[17:29.070 --> 17:30.270]  the little Tabasco peppers.
[17:30.270 --> 17:31.230]  I don't know if you ever grew those.
[17:31.230 --> 17:33.710]  Those things are, those things can get hot
[17:33.710 --> 17:35.550]  when you eat them a little early, you know.
[17:35.550 --> 17:38.350]  They're like different types of heat in each one, right?
[17:39.070 --> 17:42.030]  And I find like there's different varieties
[17:42.030 --> 17:44.630]  that have like a unique kind of heat
[17:44.630 --> 17:47.470]  that other susceptible or people are susceptible to.
[17:47.470 --> 17:49.030]  Yeah, just different.
[17:49.030 --> 17:52.430]  Yeah, thin walled stuff and thicker walled stuff.
[17:52.430 --> 17:53.950]  Oh my God, yes.
[17:53.950 --> 17:57.430]  The heat that hits you, you know.
[17:57.430 --> 17:59.470]  There's all kinds of weird things that are just like,
[17:59.470 --> 18:01.270]  whew, you know,
[18:01.270 --> 18:03.390]  when some of the hottest ones just aren't, you know,
[18:03.390 --> 18:05.630]  they're not as hot as some of these things
[18:05.630 --> 18:07.350]  that don't even get rated, you know what I mean?
[18:07.390 --> 18:09.270]  It's like, wow, the black Cobra,
[18:09.270 --> 18:11.070]  that thing will ruin your day.
[18:11.070 --> 18:12.670]  And that's a nasty one.
[18:13.830 --> 18:16.710]  But yeah, peppers are fun, dude.
[18:16.710 --> 18:20.310]  Yeah, I don't like the thick walled peppers
[18:20.310 --> 18:23.350]  and I don't like like jalapenos, for example.
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.830]  They kind of tend to just, I don't know.
[18:25.830 --> 18:27.550]  They're not the hottest peppers.
[18:27.550 --> 18:30.790]  It's just, they kind of just, I don't know.
[18:30.790 --> 18:33.150]  They go to that point where I just feel
[18:33.150 --> 18:34.150]  like they're too thick.
[18:34.150 --> 18:37.830]  I'll eat a habanero before I'll eat a jalapeno.
[18:40.310 --> 18:42.070]  And it's not about a heat.
[18:42.070 --> 18:43.590]  There's like different variety.
[18:43.590 --> 18:46.670]  There's actually like a ton of different varieties
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.030]  of jalapenos.
[18:48.030 --> 18:51.110]  Like everything from like really spicy jalapenos
[18:51.110 --> 18:52.950]  to really not spicy jalapenos.
[18:52.950 --> 18:54.470]  So it's like, there's a-
[18:54.470 --> 18:55.710]  Giant ones.
[18:55.710 --> 18:58.830]  Yeah, it's your common grocery store,
[18:58.830 --> 19:01.670]  whitewashed jalapeno that you get
[19:01.670 --> 19:06.270]  and like the regular style market is spread
[19:06.270 --> 19:09.670]  for like low spice and mild flavor
[19:09.670 --> 19:12.950]  for your North American palate.
[19:12.950 --> 19:15.190]  You know, like, you know.
[19:15.190 --> 19:18.870]  Oh, I just don't like the fleshy peppers.
[19:21.670 --> 19:25.510]  I like them when they have like less flesh inside
[19:25.510 --> 19:27.590]  and they're a little bit like thinner,
[19:28.430 --> 19:30.470]  like Tyler was speaking about.
[19:32.310 --> 19:36.190]  Yeah, some of those super thin walled ones
[19:36.190 --> 19:37.030]  that are just like, yeah,
[19:37.030 --> 19:40.150]  it's just like a paper husk almost like outside, you know.
[19:40.150 --> 19:41.350]  Those ones are hot, man.
[19:41.350 --> 19:43.510]  Those ones are like the ones that I have a hard time eating
[19:43.510 --> 19:44.590]  because they're just usually like,
[19:44.590 --> 19:46.510]  they pack a scary punch, you know.
[19:46.510 --> 19:47.350]  I love them.
[19:47.350 --> 19:48.310]  Those are good.
[19:48.310 --> 19:53.310]  I love growing like jalapenos
[19:53.550 --> 19:54.990]  but not eating them when they're green.
[19:54.990 --> 19:56.910]  I let them, I like them to get overripe
[19:56.910 --> 19:58.470]  and I pick them when they're red
[19:58.470 --> 19:59.790]  and they start getting red, you know,
[19:59.790 --> 20:02.750]  some don't red up as easily as other varieties
[20:02.750 --> 20:04.190]  as, you know, London was saying,
[20:04.190 --> 20:06.070]  some go black before they go red.
[20:06.070 --> 20:07.750]  Some will actually turn red,
[20:07.750 --> 20:09.990]  but there's a variety that I grow
[20:09.990 --> 20:12.070]  that once they get like overripe
[20:12.070 --> 20:14.590]  and they start turning really red and bright colored,
[20:14.590 --> 20:17.030]  I'll snack on those things like cookies, man.
[20:17.030 --> 20:19.910]  I love them when they're like that, you know.
[20:19.910 --> 20:21.950]  Break them off and search them out.
[20:21.950 --> 20:24.790]  But anything hotter.
[20:24.790 --> 20:26.750]  One day I'll have a nice pepper garden.
[20:26.750 --> 20:27.590]  One day.
[20:28.590 --> 20:30.270]  It's on the way, man.
[20:30.270 --> 20:31.790]  It's on the way.
[20:31.790 --> 20:35.390]  My pepperoncini peppers are like a thin walled pepper
[20:35.390 --> 20:37.430]  and they don't have any fucking spice at all.
[20:37.430 --> 20:40.830]  They're kind of like very, very mild actually, frankly.
[20:40.830 --> 20:42.830]  And they're very thin kind of walled.
[20:42.830 --> 20:44.870]  I'm not a big fan of them,
[20:44.870 --> 20:48.550]  but they like make good for like adding into things
[20:48.550 --> 20:50.110]  for soups and broths.
[20:50.110 --> 20:54.110]  And you can like, they add a flavor profile
[20:54.110 --> 20:56.870]  that's unique and kind of nice.
[20:57.030 --> 20:58.950]  Every pepper has its place.
[20:58.950 --> 21:01.790]  Like every flower has its function.
[21:02.910 --> 21:04.030]  That's true.
[21:04.030 --> 21:04.870]  That's true.
[21:06.830 --> 21:07.790]  That is true.
[21:09.990 --> 21:11.150]  What's that flower can?
[21:11.150 --> 21:12.510]  What do you got there?
[21:12.510 --> 21:13.470]  What are all those?
[21:16.470 --> 21:18.310]  It's on the flower flower.
[21:18.310 --> 21:21.910]  I can get it if I can get some nice photo points.
[21:21.910 --> 21:24.230]  But I've got a Kender Har,
[21:24.230 --> 21:27.790]  I got that Acapulco Gold, that big ass giant plant.
[21:27.790 --> 21:29.470]  I have it pressed flower.
[21:29.470 --> 21:33.630]  I have the Keefe, or this is the Keefe version of it.
[21:33.630 --> 21:36.510]  And then I have some BC Des Baba.
[21:36.510 --> 21:38.870]  That was solvent based extract.
[21:38.870 --> 21:40.990]  That's like pretty cool.
[21:40.990 --> 21:41.870]  I thought I'd pull that out.
[21:41.870 --> 21:44.390]  But I actually do have like a ton of,
[21:45.430 --> 21:46.430]  here we'll do this.
[21:47.710 --> 21:49.030]  I got some nice buds.
[21:55.910 --> 21:57.270]  Yeah, I need to wash some stuff.
[21:57.270 --> 21:59.830]  I'm gonna wash some stuff this year.
[21:59.830 --> 22:03.310]  Have somebody wash it for me.
[22:03.310 --> 22:06.910]  Do a really meticulous job probably.
[22:08.550 --> 22:10.510]  I'm such a farmer.
[22:10.510 --> 22:14.790]  I don't have the patience to wash and make it so prime.
[22:20.480 --> 22:22.720]  All right, look at that.
[22:24.400 --> 22:25.240]  Those, yeah.
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.040]  Little foxtail, foxtails of power.
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.840]  I'm gonna back it up a little bit.
[22:33.840 --> 22:36.880]  Maybe you can get it like, hide your face.
[22:40.430 --> 22:41.590]  That looks, yeah.
[22:41.590 --> 22:42.430]  That looks good.
[22:42.430 --> 22:43.790]  That is beautiful.
[22:43.790 --> 22:45.750]  It does look good, yeah.
[22:47.550 --> 22:51.390]  That is like exactly the way weed's supposed to look like,
[22:51.390 --> 22:52.350]  I think.
[22:52.350 --> 22:54.750]  I hate weed that doesn't foxtail.
[22:54.750 --> 22:57.190]  I hate that chonky nug bullshit.
[22:57.190 --> 22:59.830]  I like the foxtailed out stuff.
[22:59.830 --> 23:02.110]  That is exactly what it should look like.
[23:02.150 --> 23:04.870]  So what I know about this specific chenille
[23:04.870 --> 23:06.830]  is it smashes really well.
[23:09.030 --> 23:12.710]  So we get a good volume out of a smash.
[23:13.830 --> 23:16.270]  So we're happy with that.
[23:16.270 --> 23:18.310]  We're gonna try smashing a whole bunch of it.
[23:18.310 --> 23:21.230]  It's got a really cool, funky kind of flavor to it.
[23:21.230 --> 23:22.270]  Like, I mean, that's,
[23:23.990 --> 23:26.150]  I like weird and unique things,
[23:26.150 --> 23:28.110]  and you have to be a little bit patient
[23:28.110 --> 23:29.910]  on the pruning of this.
[23:29.950 --> 23:32.350]  But, you know, like that's a big, beautiful,
[23:33.230 --> 23:34.550]  you know, gorgeous.
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.760]  It's fun, right?
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.720]  Like that's something special.
[23:40.720 --> 23:42.200]  It looked really neat in the growth.
[23:42.200 --> 23:43.200]  It's got some character.
[23:43.200 --> 23:44.240]  Yeah, it's got some character.
[23:44.240 --> 23:45.120]  It's got some flavor.
[23:45.120 --> 23:47.680]  And it only took about 50,
[23:49.240 --> 23:51.360]  I wanna say nine days it was at.
[23:51.360 --> 23:52.200]  You didn't really,
[23:52.200 --> 23:54.560]  I didn't really wanna go more than 60.
[23:55.480 --> 23:57.680]  It was really quick.
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.640]  Like, is that something that's typical?
[24:00.640 --> 24:02.360]  I know the ice cream cake background
[24:02.360 --> 24:03.840]  has a tendency to herm.
[24:04.960 --> 24:07.320]  You know, so I think there was some potential
[24:07.320 --> 24:09.320]  for that like late flowering stress.
[24:09.320 --> 24:11.840]  That was like, you didn't really wanna bring it.
[24:11.840 --> 24:14.520]  I tried bringing the first round to 70 days.
[24:14.520 --> 24:16.600]  What was the entire cross?
[24:16.600 --> 24:19.000]  Ice cream cake cross with what?
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.920]  With the Kenhama roof red, right?
[24:20.920 --> 24:25.200]  So the first round I brought it to 70 days
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.840]  and I had some pretty.
[24:27.680 --> 24:29.080]  Yeah.
[24:29.080 --> 24:31.640]  I had some bananas popping out, you know,
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.640]  and then, and this time I brought it to about 59 days
[24:37.040 --> 24:38.200]  and there wasn't anything,
[24:38.200 --> 24:40.120]  but like digging into it afterwards,
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.400]  I saw some things that were like kind of pre-forming.
[24:43.400 --> 24:46.040]  That being said, I had four or five other beautiful phenos
[24:46.040 --> 24:47.920]  that showed nothing, right?
[24:47.920 --> 24:50.160]  So, but this one happened to be the choice
[24:50.160 --> 24:52.320]  that had the shape and the pressability
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.320]  and the aroma profile that I was looking for.
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.560]  So it's like, okay,
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.360]  well, I leaned into that for a little bit
[24:58.480 --> 25:01.520]  and to see what came out of it.
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.360]  And it's neat.
[25:02.360 --> 25:05.760]  Like that's a funky plant and everybody I give it to say,
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.960]  that's something weird and unique and special.
[25:07.960 --> 25:11.720]  And that's exactly what I like when people come over.
[25:11.720 --> 25:13.080]  Like I don't want them to be like,
[25:13.080 --> 25:15.080]  oh, hey, that's the same old fucking weed
[25:15.080 --> 25:17.240]  that bro has down the street, you know?
[25:18.960 --> 25:20.320]  I'm gonna be like, oh, that's unique.
[25:20.320 --> 25:22.280]  That's different, you know?
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.880]  It's just a trait with the chem dog.
[25:24.880 --> 25:26.360]  I mean, seriously,
[25:27.200 --> 25:31.360]  the chem dog strains all of the chem stuff.
[25:31.360 --> 25:33.440]  So any sort of OG Kush,
[25:33.440 --> 25:35.920]  which also equates any cookie strains,
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.560]  which equates any gelato,
[25:37.560 --> 25:40.560]  which equates to any sort of sorbet,
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.040]  cake, yada, yada, yada,
[25:46.040 --> 25:48.560]  just name some sort of confectionary.
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.200]  It will all have this genetic trait
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.080]  where it will pop off pollen towards the end of flowering.
[25:57.080 --> 25:58.520]  And it'll do it at week,
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.040]  between like week six to week nine.
[26:05.680 --> 26:08.160]  It doesn't like clockwork.
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.440]  I mean, you will just end up with seeds.
[26:12.400 --> 26:14.480]  That's how I was able to get seeds
[26:14.480 --> 26:16.800]  out of a lot of different OG Kushes
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.800]  and kind of just save those off to the side.
[26:21.880 --> 26:25.920]  But I also realized it's like,
[26:25.920 --> 26:28.680]  anyone can rip your fucking genetics off
[26:28.680 --> 26:31.240]  if you run it like fully.
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.560]  Cause if you go for the full 70 days,
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.920]  it will have full term seeds.
[26:38.880 --> 26:40.600]  It's just a fact of life.
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.000]  That ice cream cake clone,
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.480]  I was one of my, I really like,
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.440]  I enjoy the hell out of smoking that thing.
[26:50.480 --> 26:54.560]  But because of like every third time,
[26:54.560 --> 26:57.400]  or if you had any type of weakness in your grow room,
[26:57.400 --> 26:58.720]  it was like, yeah,
[26:58.720 --> 27:01.680]  you get some lowers that would throw a harm or two,
[27:01.680 --> 27:03.160]  or it would be just,
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.760]  it was just, it was a liability of a plant
[27:06.760 --> 27:09.080]  that I really enjoyed the smoke of.
[27:09.080 --> 27:09.920]  You know what I mean?
[27:09.920 --> 27:11.280]  So I kept it around a long time,
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.440]  a lot longer than I kept any other thing like that
[27:13.440 --> 27:16.240]  that had any potential like that
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.040]  before I finally let the clone go.
[27:19.040 --> 27:21.080]  But that's something that I really,
[27:21.080 --> 27:23.800]  a good batch of that is really, really good.
[27:23.800 --> 27:26.600]  Like you can see the just B grade batches
[27:26.600 --> 27:27.680]  and blown out batches,
[27:27.680 --> 27:30.880]  but if you get like a really good quality batch
[27:30.880 --> 27:32.620]  of the cut that I had,
[27:33.720 --> 27:38.160]  it was really, really good, tasty, delicious,
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.000]  you know, happy, happy herb.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  So I didn't see too much intersex stuff in the cake
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  or the Pam, but I did see a few in the SFV.
[27:55.440 --> 27:57.200]  My plants get worked too, man.
[27:57.200 --> 27:59.040]  They get thrown around quite a bit.
[27:59.040 --> 27:59.880]  Like it's-
[27:59.880 --> 28:02.600]  But I expect, yeah, I expect that all of them.
[28:02.600 --> 28:04.720]  I think you can go back into one of the first episodes
[28:04.720 --> 28:06.760]  that we aired.
[28:06.760 --> 28:08.520]  And I said, out of all of them,
[28:08.520 --> 28:11.760]  I expect the cake to be the most, you know,
[28:11.760 --> 28:13.960]  the most danger in that realm.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.720]  Yeah, you called it right off the bat.
[28:16.720 --> 28:18.240]  Like you're like, this is the one.
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.600]  And you're like, this is the one that I made sure
[28:19.600 --> 28:22.120]  to get some in right away, right?
[28:22.120 --> 28:22.960]  Yeah.
[28:24.320 --> 28:26.920]  Can I ask a terrible question?
[28:26.920 --> 28:28.880]  I don't know if like you're okay with it.
[28:28.880 --> 28:30.640]  You don't have to answer it.
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.920]  How many did you run to do the selection?
[28:36.440 --> 28:37.960]  On what?
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.440]  The males?
[28:40.360 --> 28:43.640]  On the SFV and the KMRs.
[28:44.520 --> 28:47.680]  I didn't make any selections out of there, but I-
[28:47.680 --> 28:51.600]  No, no, I mean, out of, once the seeds were done,
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.920]  we probably went through, I don't know,
[28:53.920 --> 28:57.400]  probably 125, 130, 30 plants, something like that.
[28:57.400 --> 28:59.680]  You know, somewhere in that realm.
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.320]  The original pollination was done with just like,
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.320]  you know, the pack of seeds,
[29:05.320 --> 29:07.320]  all the males and all the females
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.680]  was just an open pollination for the Kandahar originally.
[29:11.720 --> 29:14.160]  And then all those males hit all those plants.
[29:14.160 --> 29:17.160]  So it was multiple males that hit the SFV,
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.000]  the cake, the Pam, all that stuff, multiple Kandahar males.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.760]  So it was a group of them instead of just one.
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.120]  So it's not like an isolated thing there.
[29:30.120 --> 29:32.640]  But yeah, there was quite a few of the SFVs
[29:32.640 --> 29:35.640]  and quite a few of the cakes we saw
[29:35.640 --> 29:38.280]  right when they were done, you know.
[29:38.280 --> 29:40.920]  At very end, like very end, like last fucking,
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.160]  like, hey, I'm going too far type of thing, right?
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.600]  Like you could probably harvest about a week or two early
[29:48.600 --> 29:51.620]  and not even a week or two, maybe a little bit extreme,
[29:51.620 --> 29:55.000]  but maybe five or six days before that point in time
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.360]  and be able to figure out the regularity of it
[29:57.360 --> 29:58.200]  and get it down.
[29:58.200 --> 30:03.200]  Yeah, I didn't, like the ones that I worried about
[30:05.440 --> 30:07.680]  or noticed were the ones that flowered early
[30:07.680 --> 30:09.080]  or that would herm out early.
[30:09.080 --> 30:10.280]  You know what I mean?
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.560]  Week two, three, week four, the lowers,
[30:14.560 --> 30:18.040]  the things that were like super hermaphroditic,
[30:18.040 --> 30:21.640]  you know, those are the ones that I look for and count.
[30:21.640 --> 30:24.480]  In the end, if you push anything long enough,
[30:24.480 --> 30:27.080]  they're gonna have rotalization
[30:27.080 --> 30:29.080]  or whatever you wanna call it.
[30:29.080 --> 30:30.920]  And that's what I have fun with doing.
[30:30.920 --> 30:34.120]  Like, let's push it as hard as far as we can
[30:34.120 --> 30:36.520]  and see where it gets to and see where,
[30:36.520 --> 30:38.160]  and then back off from there, right?
[30:38.760 --> 30:41.320]  There's nowhere to go but up from that point
[30:41.320 --> 30:44.200]  and if you're looking at more than once, right?
[30:44.200 --> 30:48.520]  Yeah, and it's like, even those, the ones that go late,
[30:48.520 --> 30:51.000]  they're like, those things aren't really a danger
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.280]  to anybody but themselves.
[30:52.280 --> 30:53.120]  You know what I mean?
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.400]  They can't, the flowers are all,
[30:54.400 --> 30:55.700]  got them all trapped in there.
[30:55.700 --> 30:58.440]  They can't really open up and drop a bunch of pollen.
[30:58.440 --> 31:01.640]  It's the ones that wanna, you know,
[31:01.640 --> 31:05.200]  change really early, like the week two, three, four,
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.560]  right when they're in their early arm
[31:06.560 --> 31:08.520]  or they're like jumping on you.
[31:08.520 --> 31:10.080]  Those are the dangerous ones.
[31:10.080 --> 31:12.720]  The ones that'll throw a couple, like waylate and flower,
[31:12.720 --> 31:15.600]  it has, you'll find a seed here.
[31:15.600 --> 31:17.040]  I didn't notice this earlier
[31:17.040 --> 31:18.720]  and I gotta cut you off for a quick second
[31:18.720 --> 31:19.800]  because Mr. Tate asked,
[31:19.800 --> 31:22.480]  where do you get red Kandahar seeds?
[31:24.920 --> 31:25.760]  In Kandahar.
[31:27.240 --> 31:32.240]  Yeah, you can like Indian Land Race Exchange,
[31:33.320 --> 31:35.680]  you know, ear resin, ear resin.
[31:36.840 --> 31:37.960]  Those guys over there.
[31:40.040 --> 31:42.280]  Full power selections.
[31:42.280 --> 31:44.000]  There's a couple of different people
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.520]  that hang out over there.
[31:45.520 --> 31:47.280]  You might be able to get some from.
[31:48.880 --> 31:50.040]  You know, I had, like I said,
[31:50.040 --> 31:52.400]  I did an open pollination with the Kandahar.
[31:52.400 --> 31:55.800]  So, if you can't find some, I can get you some too.
[31:55.800 --> 31:58.520]  But yeah, you gotta, I got mine,
[31:59.440 --> 32:01.840]  had the stamp from, you know,
[32:01.840 --> 32:03.960]  all the countries that it came from.
[32:03.960 --> 32:06.200]  So, it was pretty cool.
[32:06.200 --> 32:08.360]  It came from the Indian Land Race Exchange.
[32:11.060 --> 32:11.900]  That's pretty awesome.
[32:11.900 --> 32:14.740]  I think Ace, I think Ace Seeds,
[32:14.740 --> 32:16.300]  you know, I had a deal in there with him.
[32:16.300 --> 32:18.100]  He got some too at the same time,
[32:18.100 --> 32:18.940]  something like that.
[32:18.940 --> 32:19.780]  There was a couple places.
[32:19.780 --> 32:21.820]  Who's been around Ace Seeds?
[32:21.820 --> 32:23.300]  I, oh, I don't remember.
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.540]  I don't remember the name.
[32:25.660 --> 32:27.900]  But they've been around forever.
[32:29.860 --> 32:32.780]  So, what did you, what's developing well?
[32:32.780 --> 32:35.020]  Is there something surprising or new in the arsenal
[32:35.660 --> 32:37.140]  that's coming our way, Mr. Trees,
[32:37.140 --> 32:39.620]  that we should be excited for in the future?
[32:39.620 --> 32:43.700]  I've been working on lots of femme stuff.
[32:45.100 --> 32:46.540]  Been doing a lot of femme work,
[32:46.540 --> 32:49.540]  a lot of reversals, looking at funny stuff like that.
[32:49.540 --> 32:53.060]  The regular work that I've been doing this year,
[32:53.060 --> 32:55.100]  which is actually really, really cool,
[32:55.100 --> 33:00.100]  is the, it's an F2 of the Mac One
[33:00.820 --> 33:03.820]  and Santa's Cookies cross.
[33:03.820 --> 33:07.940]  So, originally I had the Mac One,
[33:07.940 --> 33:10.700]  I have the Mac One clone, it's a good clone.
[33:10.700 --> 33:13.460]  And I ran a bunch of Santa's Cookies,
[33:13.460 --> 33:16.780]  which is 1979 Christmas Bud,
[33:16.780 --> 33:18.740]  and the form cut cookies,
[33:18.740 --> 33:21.420]  you know, that makes up the Santa's Cookies.
[33:21.420 --> 33:24.900]  And I ran a bunch of those and made some pollinations
[33:24.900 --> 33:26.700]  and made some different crosses and stuff.
[33:26.700 --> 33:29.780]  And the coolest ones that came out of it was the Mac ones,
[33:29.780 --> 33:31.380]  the ones that I made with the Mac.
[33:31.380 --> 33:32.220]  Those are the ones that I was like,
[33:32.220 --> 33:35.420]  ah, dude, these ones are just far out, you know?
[33:35.420 --> 33:38.780]  Got all the frills and all the frost
[33:38.780 --> 33:40.300]  and all the good stuff coming off of them
[33:40.300 --> 33:42.820]  because of all the cookies that's in there and the Mac
[33:42.820 --> 33:45.340]  and, you know, this and that.
[33:45.340 --> 33:47.540]  And the plants that I pulled out of there,
[33:47.540 --> 33:50.380]  the female that I really liked,
[33:50.380 --> 33:52.220]  the number one female that I really, really liked
[33:52.220 --> 33:54.020]  out of all of them, it was like the number one owl,
[33:54.020 --> 33:55.740]  and I was like, oh, you're the one.
[33:56.820 --> 33:59.220]  That one got beat up by the pill bugs,
[33:59.220 --> 34:00.900]  like just eaten down to the,
[34:00.900 --> 34:03.860]  I planted out a bunch of them out in the orchard
[34:03.860 --> 34:04.900]  and the greenhouse and stuff,
[34:04.900 --> 34:07.060]  and they were large seedlings.
[34:07.060 --> 34:08.740]  They shouldn't have gotten eaten up by a lot of things,
[34:08.740 --> 34:10.420]  you know, and out of all the plants,
[34:10.420 --> 34:12.820]  that one just got its ass frigging handed to it
[34:12.820 --> 34:16.180]  by all these pill bugs just came from far and beyond
[34:16.180 --> 34:18.500]  the lines and came to just that plant
[34:18.500 --> 34:19.860]  and wanted to eat this plant.
[34:19.860 --> 34:22.780]  So it pretty much ate this plant down to nothing
[34:22.780 --> 34:24.220]  over two days.
[34:24.220 --> 34:26.060]  Then I was like, wow.
[34:26.060 --> 34:28.500]  And there were plants right next to it
[34:28.500 --> 34:30.780]  and they weren't getting fiddled with hardly at all.
[34:31.660 --> 34:35.340]  This plant was really special to these goddamn pill bugs,
[34:35.340 --> 34:36.340]  you know, and I was like, all right,
[34:36.340 --> 34:37.740]  so I'm gonna dig this thing up.
[34:37.740 --> 34:41.300]  So I dug it up and I brought it into the greenhouse,
[34:41.300 --> 34:42.980]  potted it up in a pot instead,
[34:42.980 --> 34:45.740]  and brought it back to health thing,
[34:45.740 --> 34:48.300]  came back and it's a beautiful plant.
[34:48.300 --> 34:52.580]  It's got really rough, super serrated, small leaves,
[34:53.620 --> 34:57.860]  extremely frosty, smells almost identical to the Mac.
[34:57.860 --> 35:01.300]  And at the same time, I also had some males,
[35:01.300 --> 35:04.300]  two males that I really, really liked.
[35:04.300 --> 35:07.780]  And one of them really had a lot of resin formation
[35:07.780 --> 35:09.820]  early on and as soon as it started to flower,
[35:09.820 --> 35:11.340]  it's got really velvety leaves,
[35:11.340 --> 35:15.980]  really, really beautiful structure,
[35:15.980 --> 35:18.140]  smells really similar to the Mac flower,
[35:18.140 --> 35:20.660]  which is really, really strange being a male.
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.260]  And then the other one that I had,
[35:22.260 --> 35:23.460]  really beautiful as well.
[35:23.460 --> 35:25.860]  It didn't have, had a little bit of frost later.
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.900]  I cut it back a little bit,
[35:26.900 --> 35:29.180]  pissed it off and put on a tiny little bit of,
[35:29.180 --> 35:30.620]  a little bit of frost,
[35:30.620 --> 35:32.460]  but it smelled really, really strong,
[35:32.460 --> 35:34.860]  just like the Mac1 clone too.
[35:34.860 --> 35:36.820]  So I took the two males that had like
[35:36.820 --> 35:39.740]  that identical type smell and the plant
[35:39.740 --> 35:42.500]  that turned out to be the winner,
[35:42.500 --> 35:44.840]  it was selected for me by the pill bugs.
[35:45.780 --> 35:50.020]  And I made the F2 out of the cross.
[35:50.020 --> 35:53.260]  I bred those together and those are done now
[35:53.260 --> 35:56.100]  and drying and the whole deal.
[35:56.100 --> 35:59.860]  So I'm excited to look at those
[35:59.860 --> 36:04.860]  because I really, really liked the plants on both sides,
[36:05.460 --> 36:09.260]  like both parents, the males and the females.
[36:09.260 --> 36:11.820]  I was really, really like stoked on, you know?
[36:11.820 --> 36:14.380]  So anytime that I have a good resin male
[36:15.340 --> 36:17.460]  or something like that that I'm stoked on,
[36:17.460 --> 36:20.460]  I always really wanna, really wanna grow those ones.
[36:20.460 --> 36:22.020]  You know, I'm always excited for those.
[36:22.020 --> 36:25.660]  So the F2 will be cool because it's opened up.
[36:26.180 --> 36:28.180]  So I'll get to see some of those eyeballs
[36:28.180 --> 36:32.220]  that are in there and other stuff, but yeah, that's cool.
[36:32.220 --> 36:33.460]  That's the most fun point.
[36:33.460 --> 36:35.540]  That's the most fun point.
[36:35.540 --> 36:39.340]  Everyone thinks, oh, it's gonna be more stable.
[36:39.340 --> 36:42.140]  Like that's when it goes crazy
[36:42.140 --> 36:45.700]  and then everything just opens up like crazy
[36:45.700 --> 36:49.740]  and you just get to have fun with all crazy sorts of crap.
[36:49.740 --> 36:51.900]  And yeah, that's-
[36:51.900 --> 36:53.100]  Yeah, it's super fun.
[36:53.100 --> 36:53.940]  I like those.
[36:54.180 --> 36:55.140]  Yeah.
[36:55.140 --> 36:58.020]  That's where you really get to make the decision
[36:58.020 --> 37:02.180]  where that strain that you're breeding goes.
[37:03.060 --> 37:08.060]  And it just, it really, I think as a breeder,
[37:08.380 --> 37:13.380]  it's the most exciting thing to like run an F2 generation.
[37:14.780 --> 37:17.220]  I mean, I've reached out to like F10
[37:17.220 --> 37:19.300]  and it's like, I just don't,
[37:20.140 --> 37:24.580]  I just, I don't think the F2 generation is like,
[37:24.580 --> 37:27.940]  people don't realize like that is where you have
[37:27.940 --> 37:31.620]  like so much fun getting to select so much stuff
[37:31.620 --> 37:35.860]  because it just, it just does so much.
[37:35.860 --> 37:40.500]  Like the thing that really like opens your eyes
[37:40.500 --> 37:42.980]  at what you're missing out in like the F1
[37:42.980 --> 37:46.660]  or the F3, whatever you're growing
[37:47.620 --> 37:50.860]  is when I was making the mutant stuff
[37:50.860 --> 37:53.860]  and I grew tons of the ABC
[37:53.860 --> 37:56.540]  and I was crossing that with the regular plants
[37:56.540 --> 37:58.580]  and growing the hybrids of those plants.
[37:58.580 --> 38:01.420]  And the first time that you cross ABC
[38:01.420 --> 38:06.420]  or that mutant plant with a regular leaf plant,
[38:06.420 --> 38:08.820]  that first cross is your F1
[38:08.820 --> 38:10.340]  and you grow out all those seeds,
[38:10.340 --> 38:13.540]  you don't find any mutants with that leaf trade.
[38:13.580 --> 38:16.980]  Like you can't, they're not in that population at all.
[38:16.980 --> 38:20.660]  You have to like breed all those together,
[38:20.660 --> 38:23.580]  like grow those all together, breed them together
[38:23.580 --> 38:26.020]  and then grow those seeds
[38:26.020 --> 38:28.180]  and then you'll find all the mutants
[38:28.180 --> 38:29.460]  that have been unlocked.
[38:29.460 --> 38:33.660]  So it's like you unlock things in the game as you go along
[38:33.660 --> 38:37.060]  and you know, the F2, you get to unlock
[38:37.060 --> 38:38.300]  a lot of those recessive traits
[38:38.300 --> 38:39.820]  and those fun things that you can kind of find
[38:39.820 --> 38:41.940]  in small percentages
[38:41.980 --> 38:45.180]  and you get to find those real cool things
[38:45.180 --> 38:47.060]  and the real shitty things
[38:47.060 --> 38:48.380]  and everything in between,
[38:48.380 --> 38:49.900]  which is really kind of neat, you know?
[38:49.900 --> 38:51.860]  And then depending on your selection,
[38:51.860 --> 38:55.340]  so you can dictate what other people see later on
[38:55.340 --> 38:56.980]  a little bit, you know, but-
[38:56.980 --> 39:01.700]  You're talking about the Australian cannabis
[39:01.700 --> 39:06.380]  that you're being nice about the Australian cannabis
[39:06.380 --> 39:09.420]  that has silly looking leaves, right?
[39:09.420 --> 39:10.820]  Yep, yep, yep.
[39:10.820 --> 39:11.940]  Okay.
[39:11.940 --> 39:13.260]  Yeah, the Australian, yeah.
[39:13.260 --> 39:16.100]  The Australian was the one I was working with, ABC.
[39:16.100 --> 39:17.420]  Giant bastard, yeah.
[39:18.380 --> 39:19.460]  Yeah, so-
[39:19.460 --> 39:21.300]  Well, there's way worse names, man.
[39:21.300 --> 39:25.660]  Like how many people submit Violator Kush to fucking like,
[39:26.820 --> 39:28.860]  it's just like, really?
[39:28.860 --> 39:30.940]  I get it, but come on.
[39:30.940 --> 39:32.940]  Like that's maybe not appropriate nowadays,
[39:32.940 --> 39:35.900]  but anyways, it is what it is.
[39:37.660 --> 39:40.420]  People can make up anything nowadays.
[39:41.020 --> 39:42.340]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[39:43.900 --> 39:47.340]  Nobody cares, especially like in the black market.
[39:51.780 --> 39:52.940]  That sucks.
[39:54.460 --> 39:57.420]  I just hit that Ken Nahar Maroof red stuff.
[39:58.660 --> 40:01.460]  The ice cream cake that I was just showing off.
[40:01.460 --> 40:03.260]  I just had to break up that beautiful nug
[40:03.260 --> 40:04.220]  and have a smoke of that,
[40:04.220 --> 40:06.260]  because it looks so beautiful.
[40:06.260 --> 40:07.700]  I'm fucking stoned, man.
[40:07.820 --> 40:08.660]  Yeah.
[40:08.660 --> 40:10.740]  It's powerful.
[40:10.740 --> 40:12.260]  My wife gets energized by it,
[40:12.260 --> 40:16.060]  but she always like responds weird opposite to me for a week.
[40:16.060 --> 40:17.300]  You can assume a fucking ton of it,
[40:17.300 --> 40:18.620]  but you always, like, she's like,
[40:18.620 --> 40:19.740]  oh, well, this gives me energy.
[40:19.740 --> 40:21.500]  I'm like, what the fuck's the matter with you?
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.860]  This doesn't do anything.
[40:22.860 --> 40:25.140]  Never done that to anybody in the world except for you.
[40:25.140 --> 40:27.220]  Like you're just a one person.
[40:27.220 --> 40:31.820]  So anyways, so it's, she gets energy from it.
[40:31.820 --> 40:33.940]  I get intensely stoned off of it.
[40:33.940 --> 40:36.020]  I mean, I've been smoking resins all day
[40:36.860 --> 40:38.700]  and rosins all day.
[40:38.700 --> 40:42.900]  And I just put in like maybe like 0.3 of a gram,
[40:42.900 --> 40:45.620]  ground it up and put it into my vaporizer
[40:45.620 --> 40:47.700]  and took a hit of it.
[40:47.700 --> 40:50.340]  Got beautiful flavor profile.
[40:50.340 --> 40:54.220]  Like it's like chocolate fudge and spices.
[40:54.220 --> 40:56.540]  It's like spice chocolate fudge.
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.380]  Like I don't.
[40:57.380 --> 40:58.620]  Yeah, there you go.
[40:58.620 --> 41:01.460]  Like seriously, like it's fucking delicious
[41:01.460 --> 41:02.420]  and really, really nice.
[41:02.420 --> 41:03.260]  So I'm good.
[41:03.260 --> 41:05.220]  I can't wait for it to cure out and settle up a little bit.
[41:05.220 --> 41:09.060]  And then really like I've got three jars
[41:09.060 --> 41:11.820]  and I'm gonna press them and smash the crap out of them
[41:13.060 --> 41:14.380]  and see what comes of it.
[41:17.100 --> 41:18.900]  The mum pressed really well.
[41:18.900 --> 41:21.500]  So we should get some good stuff out of that.
[41:21.500 --> 41:25.540]  I'm gonna save some as flour, but it was beautiful stuff.
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.780]  I'm really impressed with it.
[41:26.780 --> 41:28.020]  It was something different.
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.140]  Every time somebody tried it, they're like,
[41:29.140 --> 41:30.100]  ooh, that's weird.
[41:31.300 --> 41:32.140]  I like that.
[41:32.140 --> 41:32.980]  Oh, that's good, man.
[41:33.020 --> 41:33.860]  It was chocolate.
[41:33.860 --> 41:36.740]  Like I was loving that one that I got.
[41:36.740 --> 41:40.980]  It was like really good dark chocolate and spices.
[41:40.980 --> 41:42.420]  Just like you said.
[41:42.420 --> 41:43.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:43.260 --> 41:45.220]  It was like very dark chocolatey
[41:45.220 --> 41:48.620]  and it had those spices in there too
[41:48.620 --> 41:49.460]  that you're talking about.
[41:49.460 --> 41:52.180]  So that's cool you say fudge and spices,
[41:52.180 --> 41:53.020]  because that's exactly.
[41:53.020 --> 41:55.300]  Yeah, it's like an Indian spice fudge.
[41:55.300 --> 41:57.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:57.260 --> 41:59.540]  It's exactly what I was dealing with.
[41:59.540 --> 42:01.140]  It was really, really good.
[42:01.180 --> 42:03.220]  The one I had was like really carried too.
[42:03.220 --> 42:05.100]  And like that chocolate,
[42:05.100 --> 42:07.460]  it was like you were eating a dark chocolate candy bar,
[42:07.460 --> 42:09.700]  even a few minutes after smoking it,
[42:09.700 --> 42:14.180]  you really felt like you had this like chalky chocolate
[42:14.180 --> 42:15.020]  in your mouth.
[42:15.020 --> 42:16.660]  It was like really, really cool.
[42:16.660 --> 42:18.180]  My wife was tripping out on that too.
[42:18.180 --> 42:21.260]  She's like, that's really stuck with you for a while.
[42:22.260 --> 42:25.740]  But that was my favorite part of those ice cream cakes,
[42:25.740 --> 42:28.020]  with the chocolate and stuff that came out of there.
[42:28.020 --> 42:30.700]  Didn't expect so much chocolate and spice.
[42:31.220 --> 42:35.460]  I expected more dumpsters and foul stuff,
[42:35.460 --> 42:37.580]  but chocolate and spice is killer.
[42:37.580 --> 42:38.700]  I'm sorry, man.
[42:38.700 --> 42:39.740]  I love that stuff.
[42:39.740 --> 42:42.860]  And that's really cool and fun and weird to have.
[42:42.860 --> 42:44.940]  But I don't think in general,
[42:44.940 --> 42:46.820]  like your average person is gonna reach out
[42:46.820 --> 42:48.340]  and grab that go, oh yeah.
[42:48.340 --> 42:49.180]  You know what I mean?
[42:49.180 --> 42:50.020]  Oh yeah.
[42:50.020 --> 42:50.860]  Oh yeah.
[42:50.860 --> 42:53.300]  It's cool and really good,
[42:53.300 --> 42:57.460]  but it's not like, it's not a for every person smoke.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.700]  Nope, nope.
[42:59.300 --> 43:01.420]  I hope all that's where I was.
[43:01.420 --> 43:03.300]  I could put this down anywhere
[43:03.300 --> 43:05.460]  and like it would do really well.
[43:05.460 --> 43:07.220]  It's got a good timeframe on it.
[43:07.220 --> 43:10.660]  I bet you go like hydro or whatever the fuck fancy
[43:10.660 --> 43:12.300]  shenanigans that they're doing nowadays,
[43:12.300 --> 43:15.460]  you'd be able to kill it and put it out pretty well
[43:15.460 --> 43:19.820]  and have something that's unique and different
[43:19.820 --> 43:22.300]  in the market than what's actually out there right now.
[43:22.300 --> 43:23.940]  Cause a lot of the thing,
[43:23.980 --> 43:28.460]  like in up here it's that tangy fricking citrus,
[43:28.460 --> 43:30.740]  blossom, everything,
[43:30.740 --> 43:32.500]  sweet tangy citrus blossoms.
[43:34.020 --> 43:36.940]  Every single one of them.
[43:36.940 --> 43:40.660]  And this is so different and robust and out there,
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.980]  but not enough that it's like deterring.
[43:44.820 --> 43:45.660]  Like I could see,
[43:45.660 --> 43:47.100]  I always like going for this.
[43:47.100 --> 43:50.300]  Ooh, fudge, chocolate fudge spice.
[43:50.300 --> 43:51.140]  Yeah.
[43:51.140 --> 43:52.980]  If you can throw a little name on it like that,
[43:53.300 --> 43:55.140]  fudge spice or whatever.
[43:55.140 --> 43:56.940]  That sounds like a winner to me.
[43:56.940 --> 43:59.700]  Spiced fudge packers.
[43:59.700 --> 44:00.540]  Yeah.
[44:02.540 --> 44:05.740]  I'm sure the comments will light it up on that for sure.
[44:05.740 --> 44:09.940]  I think it's a lot better than Violator Kush just saying.
[44:09.940 --> 44:11.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:11.380 --> 44:12.220]  For sure.
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.060]  For sure.
[44:13.060 --> 44:13.900]  For sure.
[44:17.060 --> 44:18.460]  I think out of all the smoke,
[44:18.460 --> 44:20.420]  that was one of my favorite ones.
[44:20.420 --> 44:24.860]  That was one of my favorite combinations out of that stuff.
[44:24.860 --> 44:28.940]  It was just, it's so raw and so different.
[44:28.940 --> 44:33.740]  I was like, that chocolate really took me by surprise.
[44:33.740 --> 44:34.580]  It was cool.
[44:35.420 --> 44:37.820]  I think there's some variability to play with here.
[44:37.820 --> 44:39.500]  Cause I like, even if I pull out,
[44:39.500 --> 44:43.020]  like I have some of the first run too,
[44:46.230 --> 44:48.070]  and it's like, it's a little bit different,
[44:48.070 --> 44:50.270]  but like, oh no, this is the Octapokagul.
[44:50.270 --> 44:51.590]  Nope, this is not.
[44:52.150 --> 44:53.230]  Hey, there's Coastal.
[44:54.150 --> 44:56.350]  Just give me a second to click the button, Coastal.
[45:01.430 --> 45:02.270]  Coastal's gone.
[45:02.270 --> 45:03.110]  There's Peter.
[45:03.110 --> 45:04.030]  Hi, Peter.
[45:04.030 --> 45:04.990]  There he is.
[45:06.470 --> 45:08.630]  I tried to ninja in and it didn't go well.
[45:10.030 --> 45:10.870]  Oh, wait, am I?
[45:10.870 --> 45:11.830]  Oh Jesus.
[45:12.750 --> 45:17.750]  I thought I was going to be in the offscreen area.
[45:18.230 --> 45:20.230]  He's like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[45:21.190 --> 45:23.430]  You gotta turn off your camera for that one.
[45:23.430 --> 45:25.190]  I figured since...
[45:26.070 --> 45:27.830]  Wanted to be the voice of God.
[45:27.830 --> 45:31.310]  It was just the two of you Ed, come say a quick hello.
[45:32.950 --> 45:34.470]  How hangzit?
[45:35.470 --> 45:40.470]  We went out to family dinner
[45:40.590 --> 45:44.270]  and a four year old fell asleep on the ride
[45:44.270 --> 45:45.110]  to the restaurant.
[45:45.110 --> 45:47.910]  So it's Chinese, what is it?
[45:47.910 --> 45:49.110]  Autumn harvest.
[45:50.990 --> 45:54.150]  So we went to Hot Pot.
[45:54.150 --> 45:57.950]  She fell asleep, slept through all of Hot Pot.
[45:57.950 --> 45:58.790]  Oh no.
[46:00.390 --> 46:03.310]  Now she's up for the whole rest of the night, hungry.
[46:03.310 --> 46:04.150]  I hope not.
[46:04.150 --> 46:04.990]  I hope not.
[46:04.990 --> 46:07.510]  Yeah, it happens.
[46:07.510 --> 46:10.230]  I'm basically waiting to get the text
[46:10.230 --> 46:12.390]  that I need to come up and deal with her.
[46:12.390 --> 46:13.230]  Yep, it's coming.
[46:13.230 --> 46:16.750]  So anyway, she slept through dinner
[46:16.790 --> 46:21.790]  and then I was upstairs battling cockroaches in the kitchen.
[46:22.710 --> 46:23.550]  Awesome.
[46:24.750 --> 46:26.830]  LA cockroaches don't mess around, dude.
[46:31.710 --> 46:33.750]  Like every night in the middle of the night,
[46:33.750 --> 46:36.190]  I go down there and I like flip the lights on
[46:36.190 --> 46:37.550]  and I'm just like...
[46:41.030 --> 46:42.710]  See how many I can kill.
[46:44.150 --> 46:45.110]  God, yeah.
[46:45.150 --> 46:48.590]  There was one time we moved into a...
[46:48.590 --> 46:51.350]  We had to leave our apartment.
[46:51.350 --> 46:54.430]  Like, you know, it was like, oh, it's so hectic.
[46:54.430 --> 46:55.750]  And I found this apartment
[46:55.750 --> 46:58.190]  and it was just too good to be true.
[46:58.190 --> 47:00.910]  You know, like everything just seemed too good to be true.
[47:00.910 --> 47:03.670]  And I had two roommates at the time, we were just kids.
[47:03.670 --> 47:05.830]  And we had all of our shit loaded up
[47:05.830 --> 47:07.670]  and we get to this new apartment
[47:07.670 --> 47:09.550]  and we unload the trucks
[47:09.550 --> 47:11.550]  and we bring in the couches and the beds
[47:11.550 --> 47:12.630]  and we set it down.
[47:12.630 --> 47:15.350]  And right when we finished unloading the trucks,
[47:15.350 --> 47:18.670]  it was getting to be dark and the sun was setting
[47:18.670 --> 47:20.750]  and the sun went down
[47:20.750 --> 47:22.710]  and we were sitting there for like a little while,
[47:22.710 --> 47:24.550]  like smoking weed and being punks,
[47:24.550 --> 47:25.830]  whatever we were doing, you know?
[47:25.830 --> 47:30.470]  And then all of a sudden, like thousands of cockroaches
[47:30.470 --> 47:33.990]  like swarmed the walls and swarmed everywhere.
[47:33.990 --> 47:36.710]  And it was like, we were in like the mother's death,
[47:36.710 --> 47:39.070]  like nest of hell, you know what I mean?
[47:39.070 --> 47:42.270]  Like it was like the worst, scariest thing ever, you know?
[47:42.910 --> 47:44.950]  And immediately, like we looked at each other
[47:44.950 --> 47:46.310]  and we're like, we're not staying here,
[47:46.310 --> 47:47.230]  we're not living here.
[47:47.230 --> 47:48.510]  There's no way that we're doing this.
[47:48.510 --> 47:50.070]  And we'd already like paid for it.
[47:50.070 --> 47:51.870]  Like we were kicked out of our other place.
[47:51.870 --> 47:53.510]  And like, it was like this whole thing.
[47:53.510 --> 47:56.710]  But we still had two days before the landlord came back
[47:56.710 --> 48:00.230]  to the other place and like locked the doors or whatever.
[48:00.230 --> 48:03.390]  So we packed up all of our shit in like an hour
[48:03.390 --> 48:06.070]  and went back to the place where we weren't allowed to go
[48:06.070 --> 48:07.990]  and like tried to get the money back.
[48:07.990 --> 48:09.630]  And it was a whole thing, but it was like,
[48:09.630 --> 48:11.950]  we would rather like give up everything.
[48:12.230 --> 48:14.390]  I've never seen so many cockroaches at a place.
[48:14.390 --> 48:16.950]  It was like, I still wake up in the middle of the night,
[48:16.950 --> 48:19.950]  like, you know, like, wow, that was a wild time.
[48:19.950 --> 48:22.070]  You know, it was like, I don't know,
[48:22.070 --> 48:23.110]  it was like a fucking movie,
[48:23.110 --> 48:24.630]  arachnophobia or something, you know?
[48:24.630 --> 48:27.670]  I feel like I had them under control.
[48:27.670 --> 48:32.670]  And my wife like insisted on calling an exterminator.
[48:33.670 --> 48:35.910]  And I feel like whatever the dude put down,
[48:35.910 --> 48:40.750]  it was almost like a cockroach, like Viagra
[48:40.790 --> 48:44.510]  and like fortified combination.
[48:44.510 --> 48:46.790]  Because like after that guy came,
[48:46.790 --> 48:49.070]  they were worse than before.
[48:51.590 --> 48:54.630]  Yeah, so now I just want to deal with it myself.
[48:54.630 --> 48:55.630]  Yep.
[48:55.630 --> 48:59.350]  I'm dealing with the same problem with termites right now.
[49:00.790 --> 49:04.230]  My neighbor decided it would be a great idea
[49:04.230 --> 49:08.310]  to get like termite traps, like bait traps,
[49:09.190 --> 49:11.310]  like professional ones.
[49:11.310 --> 49:14.230]  And I'm like, why the hell would you want to draw termites
[49:14.230 --> 49:17.310]  to your fucking house, you idiot?
[49:17.310 --> 49:20.430]  And I was just like, this is the dumbest damn thing.
[49:20.430 --> 49:22.750]  And yeah, so then it started bringing termites
[49:22.750 --> 49:24.710]  to my fucking fence and all that stuff.
[49:24.710 --> 49:27.350]  So I'm seeing my fence getting eaten up.
[49:27.350 --> 49:31.710]  And I don't know what anyone does to combat termites,
[49:31.710 --> 49:34.230]  but I would love some advice on that
[49:34.230 --> 49:38.430]  because I really don't, I only just deal in weed.
[49:38.430 --> 49:42.710]  I don't deal with all this other shit.
[49:44.190 --> 49:48.790]  Like do any of y'all know anything about anti-termite?
[49:49.710 --> 49:50.950]  You gotta seal them out.
[49:50.950 --> 49:55.310]  You gotta use like a tar spray or some sort of a paint
[49:55.310 --> 49:56.950]  or something that seals them out.
[49:57.910 --> 49:58.750]  Like a wax?
[49:58.750 --> 49:59.590]  There's like a tree.
[49:59.590 --> 50:01.430]  Like what, like what melts?
[50:02.590 --> 50:05.870]  Like for trees, we use tree sealer.
[50:05.870 --> 50:09.110]  For the termite stuff, you can use like natural latex,
[50:09.110 --> 50:12.150]  breathable, funky tree sealers for different types of wounds.
[50:12.150 --> 50:14.550]  And then you can use like the tar
[50:14.550 --> 50:16.470]  I can cock my driveway with.
[50:16.470 --> 50:19.350]  It's just black tar spray, tree sealer stuff.
[50:19.350 --> 50:21.670]  And you use that for termites and other things
[50:21.670 --> 50:23.790]  that are in the main trunks and stuff to seal them out
[50:23.790 --> 50:25.350]  because they're not gonna eat through the tar,
[50:25.350 --> 50:26.190]  you know what I mean?
[50:26.190 --> 50:28.790]  The asphalt type material on there.
[50:28.790 --> 50:32.790]  So there's like a black tree paint
[50:32.790 --> 50:34.190]  or there's certain types of paints
[50:34.190 --> 50:37.950]  that are gonna be protective against that.
[50:37.950 --> 50:40.710]  But I don't know what you would do for a fence.
[50:40.710 --> 50:43.150]  If I had a tree or if I was dealing with a tree,
[50:43.150 --> 50:44.190]  I'd get that tree sealer.
[50:44.190 --> 50:45.270]  It's a black tree sealer.
[50:45.270 --> 50:48.470]  It comes in a little can or a paint bucket or whatever.
[50:48.470 --> 50:49.950]  And it's just this black tar.
[50:49.950 --> 50:51.230]  That's all it is.
[50:52.070 --> 50:55.470]  I'll paint that fence black if I have to anyway.
[50:55.470 --> 50:56.310]  So.
[50:56.310 --> 50:58.310]  Yeah, I'm sure they got,
[50:58.310 --> 51:01.190]  I'm sure there's other stuff.
[51:01.190 --> 51:03.710]  Do like a Flex Seal, like the Flex Seal type stuff
[51:03.710 --> 51:05.310]  that has like white color in it.
[51:05.310 --> 51:08.110]  You know, it's just something similar to that, you know?
[51:09.230 --> 51:12.310]  But yeah, you gotta get creative with the paint or something.
[51:13.310 --> 51:14.150]  Oh my gosh.
[51:14.150 --> 51:16.990]  Yeah, that's really helpful.
[51:16.990 --> 51:20.190]  I mean, it's just so crazy
[51:20.430 --> 51:22.950]  how this can just go from nothing
[51:28.150 --> 51:31.550]  to really, really insane in a few years
[51:31.550 --> 51:34.190]  just because somebody made a bad mistake.
[51:35.350 --> 51:40.350]  And I don't even know how to explain that whole situation
[51:46.590 --> 51:49.990]  with all that other than just like,
[51:50.790 --> 51:53.110]  I hate to even admit that there's any like termites
[51:53.110 --> 51:57.590]  because it's like, it's kind of shameful.
[51:57.590 --> 51:58.590]  You know what I mean?
[52:06.110 --> 52:07.030]  I like bugs.
[52:10.710 --> 52:11.990]  I think bugs are cool.
[52:11.990 --> 52:14.590]  I don't have to deal with termites very much up here.
[52:14.590 --> 52:15.430]  Like there's nothing.
[52:15.430 --> 52:17.990]  I can send my cockroaches up there.
[52:17.990 --> 52:19.070]  You can.
[52:19.070 --> 52:21.230]  Restaurants can get them pretty bad.
[52:21.230 --> 52:22.070]  So.
[52:22.070 --> 52:22.910]  It's possible.
[52:23.870 --> 52:25.830]  Earwig things pretty bad.
[52:25.830 --> 52:27.750]  That gets pretty out of hand here.
[52:27.750 --> 52:30.910]  If there's some wood or a lot of wood problems
[52:30.910 --> 52:31.870]  and stuff like that.
[52:31.870 --> 52:33.790]  Like it's definitely probable.
[52:33.790 --> 52:34.630]  Right now, what's-
[52:34.630 --> 52:35.470]  Dude, earwigs.
[52:36.310 --> 52:37.950]  Things start to get in.
[52:37.950 --> 52:39.790]  Like I got a greenhouse and it's warmer.
[52:39.790 --> 52:43.470]  It's 27 degrees in here right now,
[52:43.470 --> 52:44.990]  26 degrees in here right now.
[52:44.990 --> 52:48.590]  So it's like, it's a fucking 15 degrees outside.
[52:48.590 --> 52:52.390]  So it's like, oh look, there's a fucking spot with food too.
[52:52.830 --> 52:55.510]  So it's kind of an intense time,
[52:55.510 --> 52:57.670]  but the spiders come in at the same time.
[52:57.670 --> 52:58.990]  They bloom out right now.
[52:58.990 --> 53:01.910]  So it's kind of, it's a sit and wait approach
[53:01.910 --> 53:04.310]  and see if anything dominates altogether
[53:04.310 --> 53:07.430]  and kind of hope that it all goes to plan.
[53:09.350 --> 53:10.910]  I've fed the biology.
[53:10.910 --> 53:14.750]  I've kept the fricking, I've got lots of bugs in there.
[53:14.750 --> 53:16.990]  There's like, I've given lots of predatory bugs.
[53:16.990 --> 53:20.910]  I've seen every form of bug, every form of poop,
[53:20.910 --> 53:24.270]  every size of bug, you know, like there's like,
[53:25.950 --> 53:27.590]  there's bugs everywhere.
[53:27.590 --> 53:29.590]  And I feel like it's not a bad thing.
[53:31.550 --> 53:35.430]  So we're just gonna hold up and hopefully it turns out okay.
[53:36.710 --> 53:39.030]  We're still, it's funny,
[53:39.030 --> 53:40.910]  cause I feel like every time I go in there,
[53:40.910 --> 53:42.550]  I like do kind of a refresh.
[53:42.550 --> 53:45.790]  Like that's my breeding area for predatory insects.
[53:45.790 --> 53:47.750]  And then it kind of brings the predatory insects
[53:47.750 --> 53:49.630]  out here each round and they release.
[53:51.430 --> 53:52.870]  Yeah, it's dope.
[53:52.870 --> 53:54.390]  That kind of heart removed stuff,
[53:54.390 --> 53:57.550]  red stuff was bad-ass and it's absolutely delicious.
[53:57.550 --> 53:59.950]  So go to Mr. Tree's and check that out.
[53:59.950 --> 54:00.790]  Oh yeah.
[54:02.070 --> 54:04.390]  And he's in food, so he'll appreciate that.
[54:04.390 --> 54:07.950]  London, totally random topic.
[54:09.590 --> 54:13.590]  My wife was like, ask him about this
[54:13.590 --> 54:17.750]  cause he's from the food industry and he understands.
[54:17.750 --> 54:19.590]  Like those plastic containers that they-
[54:19.710 --> 54:22.790]  Plastic containers for like for food,
[54:22.790 --> 54:27.550]  for to go food, the clear ones for propagation.
[54:29.630 --> 54:34.630]  Instead of paying for like the normal like trays
[54:36.150 --> 54:39.030]  that you have to buy for like 20 bucks,
[54:39.030 --> 54:43.030]  you can get like $20 of like a hundred of them.
[54:43.030 --> 54:44.910]  Like I got some muffins from the bakery
[54:44.910 --> 54:47.030]  and I was like, this could work.
[54:47.030 --> 54:47.870]  Oh yeah.
[54:48.190 --> 54:51.030]  Are you like talking like muffin liners
[54:51.030 --> 54:52.990]  or are you talking like single use plastic?
[54:52.990 --> 54:55.910]  The plastic containers.
[54:55.910 --> 54:57.230]  Yeah, I don't know.
[54:59.110 --> 55:00.910]  Yeah, you could save a bunch of money,
[55:00.910 --> 55:02.350]  but you could also like,
[55:02.350 --> 55:04.790]  that's a lot of single use plastic
[55:04.790 --> 55:08.310]  that you just throw into the environment all of a sudden.
[55:08.310 --> 55:09.790]  Oh yeah, forgot about that.
[55:09.790 --> 55:10.630]  Good point.
[55:10.630 --> 55:13.070]  She just said good point.
[55:15.230 --> 55:16.870]  I didn't know, sorry.
[55:17.310 --> 55:19.110]  She said she's an asshole, sorry.
[55:22.430 --> 55:23.270]  I'm dead.
[55:23.270 --> 55:28.270]  So Tyler, I've been 50 pounds of that.
[55:31.350 --> 55:34.950]  I've been, can you see that?
[55:36.710 --> 55:37.550]  You're really-
[55:37.550 --> 55:38.750]  Quila extract powder.
[55:39.630 --> 55:41.230]  I can't even read it properly.
[55:41.230 --> 55:42.550]  Quileja.
[55:42.550 --> 55:43.390]  Quileja.
[55:44.390 --> 55:49.390]  And so I'm putting in little ounce sizes
[55:49.910 --> 55:51.470]  and two ounce sizes.
[55:54.150 --> 55:55.110]  What, you're muted.
[55:58.090 --> 55:59.050]  That's why you couldn't hear me.
[55:59.050 --> 56:00.250]  I was reading it to you.
[56:04.090 --> 56:04.930]  That's awesome.
[56:04.930 --> 56:05.770]  That's awesome.
[56:07.330 --> 56:12.330]  It came in today and it's the exact same size
[56:14.770 --> 56:16.530]  as the supplier, as Builder's Oil.
[56:18.130 --> 56:22.330]  So I've been packing up a little sachet.
[56:22.330 --> 56:27.330]  And then what also came in today was we got the-
[56:31.700 --> 56:33.660]  Oh, the root beer freeze.
[56:36.500 --> 56:37.740]  Those won't last long.
[56:37.740 --> 56:48.230]  No, and then we got this little dark,
[56:48.350 --> 56:52.470]  that says Lime Sour.
[56:53.590 --> 56:54.430]  Oh, no way.
[56:56.630 --> 56:57.470]  What's the number after that?
[56:57.470 --> 56:59.670]  Lime Sour number one, Sour Diesel,
[56:59.670 --> 57:04.670]  Skunk Tech selection, cross with Lime F5.
[57:05.830 --> 57:09.310]  Sweet, sweet.
[57:09.310 --> 57:14.310]  There's a little bit of a data entry in that there.
[57:15.070 --> 57:17.910]  And then we also have a whole lot of-
[57:19.950 --> 57:20.790]  Top Dog.
[57:22.510 --> 57:25.670]  Nice, nice.
[57:25.670 --> 57:27.470]  You're surrounded by fire, dude.
[57:27.470 --> 57:28.430]  That's good.
[57:28.430 --> 57:30.990]  It's gonna be a data entry day tomorrow.
[57:30.990 --> 57:33.150]  Yeah, I'm gonna bring you some stuff too.
[57:33.150 --> 57:36.070]  I got some cool stuff to bring you, stuff to restock.
[57:36.070 --> 57:39.150]  We got some new chocolate ghost pepper seeds
[57:39.150 --> 57:40.790]  coming your way too, which is cool.
[57:40.790 --> 57:41.950]  Excellent.
[57:41.950 --> 57:43.750]  Some weird stuff like that.
[57:44.190 --> 57:45.510]  Yeah, some thin stuff.
[57:45.510 --> 57:47.910]  Yeah, actually we sold out of the,
[57:51.750 --> 57:54.790]  well, pretty much most of the vegetable stuff.
[57:54.790 --> 57:56.670]  Nice, nice, okay.
[57:56.670 --> 57:57.510]  Got lots of it.
[57:57.510 --> 57:58.350]  It's been a good year.
[57:58.350 --> 58:01.030]  So I'll send you the list in addition to the Pam,
[58:01.030 --> 58:04.590]  which actually someone had asked for specifically.
[58:04.590 --> 58:05.790]  Oh, right on, right on.
[58:07.470 --> 58:10.430]  Won't be long, we'll see you in the next couple of days.
[58:10.470 --> 58:12.630]  Yeah, so I think,
[58:12.630 --> 58:15.390]  sanity tells me don't do it this Tuesday,
[58:15.390 --> 58:16.710]  do it next Tuesday.
[58:17.710 --> 58:19.990]  Okay, right on, right on.
[58:19.990 --> 58:22.110]  So I'm gonna be able to tell them.
[58:23.150 --> 58:24.390]  Do a little promotion then.
[58:24.390 --> 58:29.390]  Weekly Tuesday night throw downs in LA.
[58:30.070 --> 58:32.110]  Nice, and they know the Jits.
[58:32.110 --> 58:35.390]  They know who we are and what's gonna happen, right?
[58:35.390 --> 58:36.990]  All right, right on, good deal.
[58:36.990 --> 58:38.190]  I like that.
[58:38.190 --> 58:39.030]  He was like-
[58:39.070 --> 58:40.990]  The folks are like, what is going on here?
[58:40.990 --> 58:43.950]  He was like, I just don't want it to turn into
[58:43.950 --> 58:46.990]  the downtown trap events.
[58:46.990 --> 58:47.830]  Yeah.
[58:47.830 --> 58:50.750]  Where everybody has pounds and pounds on the table
[58:50.750 --> 58:53.390]  and everyone has the lights and the microscopes.
[58:53.390 --> 58:56.430]  It's ridiculous, yeah.
[58:56.430 --> 58:58.510]  Don't blow it, don't blow it, you know?
[58:58.510 --> 59:00.430]  Yeah, that's good.
[59:00.430 --> 59:02.590]  That's cool, that's way cool.
[59:02.590 --> 59:03.430]  That'll be fun.
[59:05.230 --> 59:07.030]  Get some good footage and stuff there too,
[59:07.030 --> 59:08.950]  you know, some cool stuff.
[59:09.870 --> 59:10.710]  That'd be cool.
[59:10.710 --> 59:13.510]  Yeah, no, so there's like a stage, it's outdoor.
[59:13.510 --> 59:17.190]  And actually I can show it.
[59:17.190 --> 59:19.990]  We're gonna have another band, that same band comes?
[59:19.990 --> 59:22.790]  Or another band, we're gonna do-
[59:22.790 --> 59:24.790]  I think we have to go smaller.
[59:25.790 --> 59:27.430]  DJ style?
[59:27.430 --> 59:30.030]  One, no, no, no, more like the stage is,
[59:31.270 --> 59:32.550]  it's very small.
[59:32.550 --> 59:35.030]  Like remember that was like an eight piece band?
[59:35.030 --> 59:36.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:37.590 --> 59:38.430]  All right, hold on, let me see.
[59:38.710 --> 59:39.950]  Like Jewel or something?
[59:41.950 --> 59:44.910]  That's what I tell them, like,
[59:44.910 --> 59:47.830]  the acoustic guitar player solo.
[59:47.830 --> 59:49.230]  Yeah, totally, totally.
[59:49.230 --> 59:52.910]  Jewel with her guitar, that's right.
[59:54.830 --> 59:56.190]  That's right, that's right.
[59:57.990 --> 59:58.830]  I'm glad you got that.
[59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.190]  I'm so glad somebody was with me there.
[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.550]  That's good, that was good.
[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.830]  Yeah, that was 100%, because it's like,
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.830]  behind it are like apartment,
[01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.670]  like apartments basically.
[01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.510]  Got me?
[01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.750]  Yeah, I totally get that we can't be like
[01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.030]  blowing it out at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.870]  Totally.
[01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:23.270]  I was like, the acoustic set.
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.110]  Acoustic set.
[01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:24.950]  Totally.
[01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:27.790]  That's cool.
[01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.630]  Let me see if I can upload.
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.470]  No, that'll be fun.
[01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:33.550]  See if StreamYard can handle.
[01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:39.390]  So do we wanna talk some like KMR characteristics
[01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.310]  and any of that stuff?
[01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.150]  Like-
[01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:43.830]  You're trying to keep us on topic?
[01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:47.830]  Not if you don't want to.
[01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.750]  Go for it.
[01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:54.310]  I'm just really excited about it.
[01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:58.310]  And I can go on about some of the other breeding projects
[01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:03.310]  I'm doing, but as far as Tyler's stuff,
[01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:09.070]  basically I'm seeing like out of nine,
[01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:12.150]  two were the good ones.
[01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:16.230]  That includes females and males.
[01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.670]  That tells me that the, not just the Y chromosome,
[01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:23.550]  but the X chromosome, like I said before,
[01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.750]  the X chromosome was also a culpatory
[01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:31.110]  in the plant having issues.
[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.230]  With growth patterns,
[01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:40.150]  because the good ones were really good
[01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:42.550]  and then the bad ones were really bad.
[01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.430]  But that's the point of a test grow.
[01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:49.430]  And I completely do not have anything
[01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:53.110]  to complain about with it.
[01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.310]  It is what it is.
[01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:59.550]  And the current stuff is awesome.
[01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.070]  It is frosty.
[01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:03.110]  It is happy.
[01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.910]  It is really, really nice.
[01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:13.070]  What I noticed is it made the Kandahar
[01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.230]  really like leathered things up,
[01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.470]  made things a little bit more edgy,
[01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:23.470]  more tough looking, a little more leafy,
[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:26.790]  but added some sort of, you know,
[01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:30.190]  like power was really what I got out of that.
[01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:32.590]  Power and spice.
[01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:34.630]  But the plants were tough looking.
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:37.510]  They're much more like a durable,
[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.550]  like angry leaves.
[01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:46.550]  Yeah, angry leaves is a good way I can describe it.
[01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.870]  That's one thing that was unique across the whole,
[01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:53.910]  everything was that way with all the crosses.
[01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:57.590]  It brought that angriness, you know.
[01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:02.910]  But I didn't have any like major, you know,
[01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:09.430]  like disease issues or anything.
[01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.270]  But yeah, like the ones that didn't wanna grow
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.110]  or the ones that wanted to be funky,
[01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.870]  they were funky the whole way through.
[01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.270]  And then the ones that were really, really good,
[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.830]  you know, turned out to be like those chocolate ones
[01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.550]  and those really flavorful, enjoyable smoke.
[01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:25.510]  But the plants themselves, they had some toughness.
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.390]  And some angry leaves, you know,
[01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.870]  is the best way I can describe it.
[01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:35.310]  So definitely not the prettiest of plants
[01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:39.030]  when it comes down to it, but full of power.
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:44.830]  We can get them all on dagga.garden,
[01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:47.830]  all of the Ken Harmer plug.
[01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.350]  I think we ran out of some of them, right?
[01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:54.790]  But do you have more of everything?
[01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.950]  I have little bits of everything, yeah.
[01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:59.150]  I don't have a ton more of everything,
[01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:01.510]  but we have little bits of everything, yeah.
[01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.670]  And then I brought them with the space.
[01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:10.070]  The Pam Kandahars are gone.
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.070]  The Pam 15 Kandahars are gone.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.670]  The ice cream cakes are still here.
[01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.230]  The SFEs are still, still have some SFEs
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.430]  and some ice cream cakes.
[01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.670]  Still, so I'll bring some of those too.
[01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:29.990]  Yeah, and I also like made a few crosses of haze,
[01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:35.430]  purple haze to original haze, the purple phenotype
[01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:40.430]  to the Kandahar, Red Maroof and SFV cross
[01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:48.390]  for a few folks on FCP.
[01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:53.390]  And then the rest for a charity for the,
[01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:59.830]  Heather and that whole situation
[01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.270]  that like, I just can't even imagine.
[01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:09.110]  So yeah, whenever that gets put online.
[01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:13.150]  So that's, so the stuff you sent me,
[01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:15.870]  there's the pollen, which you wanted me to get out
[01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.390]  to these guys, right?
[01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.790]  Yes, the pollen is just for the folks in FCP.
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:29.870]  And then the seeds also to these guys.
[01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.190]  And then additionally.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.760]  Basically any seeds that are left
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.760]  from getting sent to these people,
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.840]  they get sent to the charity.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.400]  So the Heather charity.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.320]  So you want me to send them to Brian?
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.400]  Yes, and your.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.000]  Okay, got it.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.520]  If that's possible, I don't know how this is all gonna work,
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.520]  but my goal is to just try to, yeah,
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.160]  do what I can within this community to help.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.280]  Well, did they go up for auction
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.920]  or is this just something you wanna,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.320]  because the next, we're actually doing a fundraiser
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.400]  later this month if you wanna put them up for that.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.920]  Then whatever you wanna do,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.120]  I just want them to help people that need help.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.200]  Okay, well, the third one would be
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.400]  the medical patients and veterans.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.720]  I'm cool with helping everybody.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.840]  You're very open-minded is what you're saying.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.840]  You're very flexible.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.560]  Yes, yes.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.960]  As long as they go towards a good cause.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.760]  Okay, I now, Ming Bai, as we say in Chinese,
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.320]  I now understand what I am to do
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.480]  with the stuff you sent to me.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.080]  I just, I don't feel comfortable selling,
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.360]  like having you sell the pollen to people
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.440]  because if it goes bad, you need to like heat.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.640]  I know, I'll try to get it out to these guys quickly
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.200]  and then I'll see what I have left over
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.200]  and figure out who else to hand it out to.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.720]  Yeah, yeah, I just, I didn't wanna like put that
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.240]  on the market because I felt like that would just
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.920]  kind of be a little bit sketchy.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.680]  So, but thank you for like everything you do
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.120]  within this community.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.120]  And it really, it really drives all these other people
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  like a lot and it pushes what we all do every day
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.400]  when we have like this kind of forum to like go to
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.600]  and deal with and like, I don't know.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.160]  No, I hear you.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.880]  I feel, yeah, no, I love, I mean,
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.400]  the stuff that makes me the happiest, like,
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.320]  was it, I'm totally blanking on when it was.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.800]  I don't know if it was this morning
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.000]  or if it was some other yesterday,
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.560]  but someone who had received a package
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.120]  for the Patients and Veterans Program was like watching
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.080]  and I was like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.880]  Like that's the stuff that makes me happy.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.200]  And I think a lot of this stuff is just a function
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.240]  of having like the time and personal,
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.160]  but like, I feel like we have a situation where like,
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.880]  if I can get on top of having other people
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:46.040]  and like being like, can you, like here in LA
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.840]  to have someone just help pack up care packages.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.480]  You know, it's like, we could do more.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.120]  Like the only limiting factor is just having someone
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.100]  or like people sent, like you sent stuff in, right?
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.080]  You know, other people have sent stuff in.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.560]  Tony as a breeder sent a ton of stuff in
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.400]  and it's like, that's the inventory for the care packages.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.960]  And I'm sure Tyler would, when I meet with you,
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.280]  can we allocate some of them to veterans and patients?
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.240]  Yeah, always.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.400]  Yeah, you know me, man.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.440]  I'm a charity guy.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.500]  I always wanna give and help out and make sure people,
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.760]  you know, get help, get stuff for free,
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.640]  get a little leg up, you know, I love that.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.280]  You know, it's the best thing in the world.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.280]  We can help each other, you know, it's just,
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.880]  it's like a circle, just like everything else in the world.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.720]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.720]  Just do good, good breeds good.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.960]  You know, I always say that, good does good, you know?
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.360]  So that's cool.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.160]  I'll give you a ton of stuff for that, that's great.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.000]  Awesome, all right.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.120]  Let me quickly phase out my seven year old
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.180]  who's going to bed, I'll be back.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.640]  You guys wanna watch some sneak peeks
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.300]  of the Unicorn Cup fireside chat
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.840]  that I have kind of hidden in my back pocket right now?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, throw something up.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.280]  What other things did they put in those care packages?
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.400]  Give me half a second to clean up my dab thingy.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.840]  You guys can.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.720]  Dab thingy.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.520]  Oh.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.840]  There you go, there's a little teaser.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.990]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.150]  Show it to me again, show it to me.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.070]  Come on, show me that plant pot.
[01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:39.270]  Come on, show it to me.
[01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:40.230]  Woo!
[01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:45.430]  Shit, I gotta do the same thing now.
[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:49.870]  That's all kinds of stuff.
[01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:52.550]  Femme stuff, loving it.
[01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.190]  Gotta check it out.
[01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.710]  Those are some lifeguards.
[01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:01.230]  Those are always amazing.
[01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:03.630]  That's the lifeguard and the cowboy caviar
[01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:06.430]  and some other stuff like that up there.
[01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:10.710]  I'm behind, I need to get planted.
[01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.670]  That's what I'm gonna do today and tomorrow.
[01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.070]  I'm gonna be potting things.
[01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.870]  Getting them ready.
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.870]  I had to do a fucking ton of that the other day.
[01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:22.350]  Here, I'll show you.
[01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.550]  Yeah, I've been lazy, I gotta do it.
[01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:26.710]  I gotta do cleaning.
[01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.070]  I've been lazy.
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.470]  I've been busy, it's been hot.
[01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.510]  I don't wanna be working on any of that stuff when it's hot.
[01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:35.350]  Oh, there you go, boom!
[01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:36.630]  Did not do bad here.
[01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.270]  Boom, yeah, no, I got a lot of shit.
[01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:41.390]  Let's start reading through.
[01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:45.030]  So I got, I gotta make sure I have the names,
[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.870]  so I'm not gonna say them.
[01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:48.150]  So I got some dragonfly, earth medicine,
[01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:52.310]  stock, some skunk number one,
[01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:57.030]  open pollinated from 710 Canuck,
[01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:58.470]  who got it from Todd McCormick,
[01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:00.590]  who did the open pollination.
[01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:02.430]  He followed up with the pollination.
[01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:07.070]  Purple Bubba, we got Derwin Skittles,
[01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.630]  where else?
[01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.670]  More dragonfly stock.
[01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:15.030]  There's some neat stuff in here, shit.
[01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.590]  So I'll fucking move some stuff around.
[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.430]  Where are we at?
[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:24.310]  All right, all right, GMO Haze.
[01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.950]  Oh, that's it, that's a fun one.
[01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.830]  Infinity Lemon Haze.
[01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:38.110]  Skunk one, Derwin Skittles.
[01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:47.900]  Skunk one, dragonfly, dragonfly.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.340]  Look at it, look at it, fly on the dragonfly.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.020]  Look at that, there you go.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.260]  Skunk one, see, I love bugs.
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.100]  Proof.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.940]  Yep, bugs are good.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.100]  Oh, shit, like stepping on stuff and breaking things.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:03.300]  We got the Derwin Skittles,
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:08.300]  trying to see Solo Burger, GMO Haze there too.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.860]  Where did you go?
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.340]  I've got some,
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.420]  these are Red Lebanese Pucks that are really little.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.700]  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.540]  But these guys are coming along, which is nice.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.980]  I think there's a Red Lebanese Puck there in the back
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.780]  from Crickets and Cicadas.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.340]  And then yeah, just some fun fucking badass stuff
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.940]  to play with, which is really cool.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.060]  I'll give you guys some, take that terrible screen off.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.900]  I'm getting ready to run some of those Red Leb Pucks
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.940]  myself here.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:45.780]  Are you?
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.060]  So I'm looking, yeah, I'm looking forward to,
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.900]  tell me how they do.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.220]  Some of that Red Leb side, you know?
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.940]  Send me a text message, tell me how they germ.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.380]  We'll talk in the background about it.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.740]  I wanna know how they do.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.140]  Yeah, so I'm talking in the background,
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.100]  getting mine from a different place.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:00.940]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.540]  There's some things going on there,
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.460]  like flights and stuff and air and temperatures
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.980]  and summers and fucking shit.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.820]  Oh, I know, I know, I'm like that.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.460]  I would love to know if you have a different
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.860]  set of circumstances and how your experience goes.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.340]  I have you zoomed in, I'm sorry.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.780]  But do you guys want the sneak peek?
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.500]  I could do the sneak peek thing.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.540]  Is the sound coming through for you?
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.500]  No.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.660]  No sound, I can see it really nicely.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.140]  I look sick, so, you know, there you go.
[01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.490]  So we're doing the fireside chat,
[01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:41.370]  and what's happening is Kevin Jodry's talking about
[01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.730]  Canadian handling of cannabis product.
[01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:58.870]  Nope, can't hear him anymore again.
[01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:00.710]  No.
[01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.390]  No sound.
[01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:06.230]  I can kinda hear it in the background once you show up.
[01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:08.230]  I can kinda fuck around here, just a second.
[01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.590]  I think it's from your end.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.540]  All right, we're gonna try that again.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.140]  Share screen.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.580]  You see the tents out there, man?
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.620]  You guys are partying out there, that's cool.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.260]  That's like, where was that?
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.380]  In the Kootenays, like right in the Kootenays.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.180]  Yeah, that's cool.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.860]  I can probably, what I gotta do is
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.300]  Bears are jumping out at any minute, right?
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.100]  You know, that's cool.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.860]  Yeah, no, we're out in the fucking sticks.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.220]  There's no cell phone connection.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.340]  There is no zero.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.460]  That's what I mean.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.700]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.260]  Like, Jesus Christ, you guys are.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.900]  And then also the packaging,
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.500]  you can't have fun faults.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.180]  You can't have anything that looks like it was a cartoon.
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.620]  Remember that that's exactly,
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.300]  I've brought all the equipment
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.300]  and all of it's set up on like a zero budget.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.500]  And we're in the middle of nowhere.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:10.860]  Guys that it's a dangerous thing
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.820]  that children need to be protected from.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.540]  And that's what's led us to where we are right now.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.380]  I think.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.100]  That play out through, yeah, that played pretty well.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.860]  No, that's cool.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.820]  How long are you guys out there?
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.780]  How long is that going on?
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.780]  Like a couple of days, the whole weekend.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.820]  Yeah, this was a three hour conversation.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:35.100]  So government handles distro for you, so it's distro.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.660]  The issue though is that
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.900]  they're definitely not handling that product gently.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.420]  And so you're having distro
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.460]  that's destroying the quality of your consumption.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.300]  Okay, let's see here.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.780]  And that's not the cultivator's fault,
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.060]  but no one knows how to blame anybody but the cultivator.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:48.940]  But what we are,
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.860]  it's the distribution straight up steals your money.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.380]  I'm talking straight up steals your money
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.380]  and folds up and leaves and you have zero.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.660]  The only company that I can trust is a giant one.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.140]  And everyone trips on dealing giant companies.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.700]  They're the only ones that pay.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.740]  Every one of these other distro screws you.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.420]  And all they have to do is make a single error.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.860]  They make a single error
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.980]  and they lose a license for 24, 48, 72 hours.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:14.860]  They have to unload their entire business and then get.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:16.740]  So you make any errors in lab
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.020]  or you make any errors in distro,
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.540]  you just, I mean, we're talking tiny errors.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.420]  You're destroyed.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.860]  Fucking great quote, eh?
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.460]  Yeah, yeah, the general man.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.660]  Piece of shit.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.300]  Here, there's a good one here, you see.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.640]  That's radical, man.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.160]  You can tell you guys have been there for a while.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.760]  Like everybody's like barefoot.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.320]  They've got like sandals on.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.920]  Yeah, dude, and they all just showed the fuck up.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.960]  They're like hanging out.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.800]  Yeah.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.960]  A lot of them do different things.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.120]  There's me in the background.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.040]  So when you go to dispensary for missions like land,
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.680]  you can have a different experience.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.160]  So yeah.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.480]  Can average individual go there?
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.840]  Oh, and when you link up with the first nations,
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.320]  you wanna do something different,
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.880]  which I think really does help.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.880]  And they have the ability to create their own laws
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.360]  and their own abilities through packaging
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.280]  and working with farms and stuff.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.280]  So there is a way to affect federal laws through that
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.400]  to show them with maybe different taxation
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.440]  and different brackets and different ways of working
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:33.440]  at farms, direct sales that can make a change.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.520]  Well, and just to touch on that.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.560]  Smoking six star hash.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.480]  The first nations are actually not working
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.400]  with the feds at all.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.160]  They've totally decided that they're not gonna have
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.280]  anything to do with the feds.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.680]  And then when you ask the feds,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.160]  plenty of meetings with the feds are like,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.400]  hey, what are you guys gonna do?
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.200]  That's cool.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.040]  Was that Daniel?
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.960]  Was that Daniel Montero?
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960]  Is that GW?
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.560]  GW Smoke Break Daniel?
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.520]  There too or is that somebody else?
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.840]  No.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.080]  That dude looked like him.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.640]  Yeah, cool.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.480]  I couldn't tell.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.080]  I couldn't see it go around again.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.360]  I was like, damn, everybody made it there.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.200]  That's cool.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.000]  That's neat, man.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.360]  It was him.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.640]  It looked really cold.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.480]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.080]  You guys looked like you were in Hawaii.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.920]  I mean, was it hot outside?
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.760]  So hot.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.600]  It looks like.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.440]  Oh, gotcha.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.280]  It looks cold.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.200]  It makes me feel cold when I watch this.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.040]  And we've been working really hard to give her a place
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.560]  in the world.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.120]  And a lot of us, all of us here
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.680]  have been incredibly already successful at that.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.520]  I gotta realign this one up.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.640]  So now we really need to discuss,
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.440]  you know, are we saving ourselves
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.880]  or are we saving cannabis?
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.360]  Because if you ask me,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.880]  I believe that cannabis is.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.880]  It's like off by like 10 second.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.520]  Like 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.640]  I think that she.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.480]  It's cold, right?
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.320]  I recognize it.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.040]  There's me running around like a dink.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:19:59.880]  There we go.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.600]  Forth already.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.760]  I'm not saying to let go
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.840]  because I'm gonna be the last one holding on for sure.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.600]  But I also think that it's important for us to recognize
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.440]  and not have so much ego that it's not about us.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.800]  It's about the plant.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.840]  It's about the medicine going forward.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.680]  And she has different.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.120]  And there's me forgetting where I am on camera.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.480]  Modalities that she needs to walk through
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.680]  and different doors that she needs to be.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.240]  And maybe the legacy market is not one
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.920]  that's gonna get her to the next stage
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.040]  that she wants to be either.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.600]  Not saying that the legacy market is gonna be done
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.120]  and we're gonna stop growing or anything like that.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.720]  But just like Josh said,
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.320]  if cannabis is the gateway drug,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.520]  then that's the gateway to ayahuasca ceremony.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.080]  That's the gateway to MDMA.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.400]  That's the gateway to LSD therapy,
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.240]  mushrooms, psychedelics, all of it.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.360]  Which we do now have the ability to jump onto
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.680]  and say, oh, maybe it's not just about the cannabis plant,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.640]  like Josh was saying,
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.280]  but it's about all of the plants that change our lives.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.680]  And that we now have this ability in Canada,
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.680]  2.5 grams of any psychedelic plant.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.160]  Like, holy, we can really.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.120]  And a lot of the legacy market people
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.960]  are the people who have been doing plant medicine ceremony
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.720]  for 30, 40 years already.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.320]  And we already have been sitting with our friends
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.720]  in psychedelic therapy for so long.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.760]  And a lot of the doctors that are taking it on,
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.920]  much like the corporate cannabis industry
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.600]  that came in in the beginning,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.480]  are gonna also bastardize the message
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.960]  that that plant medicine has.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.160]  So I think that we need to pull up our overalls
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.520]  and get out there and start ushering in
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.000]  all of the rest of the plants
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.760]  that need to follow after cannabis.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.840]  Boom.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.120]  I don't really like that audio back up
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.960]  because that is fucking terrible.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.600]  But yeah, it was pretty cool.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.160]  Very fun.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.320]  A lot of editing work that needs to be done.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.040]  Josh and Kelly are amazing people.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.540]  I can't hear you, Mr. Trees, you're muted.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:19.860]  Oh, I said, it's cool to be able to go places like that,
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.700]  you know, and just hang out with the people, you know,
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.180]  and just be with people that are passionate
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.020]  about what's going on, you know, it's cool.
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.740]  Some of the best times ever.
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.140]  It was amazing to meet people
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.940]  that I didn't even know about in the area
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.660]  that were like so passionate about it
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.820]  that I found out I knew, like Shannon Ross
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.860]  was one of the people and she's a farmer
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.020]  that was like part of the organic movement.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.860]  What was that?
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:50.180]  The farmer that's part of the organic movement
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.540]  in BC when it came to farmers.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.700]  Oh yeah, there he goes.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.660]  You're Canadian, I'm Canadian.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.020]  Fucking Canadian.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.420]  What is this?
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.260]  What is he doing?
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.180]  I don't know, he's sitting in a bench.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.360]  I'm more Canadian than you.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.200]  I know.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.880]  The only light I have in here
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.720]  is like a laundromat bright light.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.920]  And I have like, kind of like white paper
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.160]  trying to like, cause the like cover for it,
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.720]  which doesn't really do much anyway.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.600]  Like I don't think we ever had it.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.840]  Anyway, it's a very bright light.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.720]  But the lights on the timer went out, so.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.160]  You go dark, man.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.360]  It's like, oh shit.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.760]  You get whatever light you could get.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.960]  The vibe in the garage just changed dramatically.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.880]  That's cool, that's cool.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.000]  There was a couple of years in college
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.280]  where the only lights I saw were HID lights.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.840]  I did not see the light of day for a very long time
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.440]  and it burned my eyes out.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:13.240]  I literally like have like a thing in my eyes now.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.440]  Like everyone else needs those fancy sunglasses,
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.560]  but I don't really, I can't even see it anymore.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.880]  I mean, it just is,
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.480]  my eyes are just so messed up at this point, but.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.480]  Yeah, I'd never suggest doing that for anyone.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.360]  That was like probably the, yeah, safety.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.840]  She said safety first.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.920]  Those really fit your face nicely, Peter.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.200]  They really fit your face really nice.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]  They're really good.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.040]  Yeah, that's what everyone needs when they go in the.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.080]  You mean Chad, if you're trying to tell.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.160]  Those are sick.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.280]  Yeah, you just immediately went to Hawaii.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.800]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.640]  Like they're automatically like.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.320]  It says bride tribe.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.240]  It was for.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.760]  Bride tribe.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.920]  What do you call it, a bachelorette party?
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.240]  That's sweet.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.520]  Rolling with the bride.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.520]  The only sunglasses I have are all like,
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.920]  I either get them at events
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.200]  where like they give out the free sunglasses
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.880]  or like this type of stuff
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.720]  where they're the extra bridesmaid sunglasses.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.840]  I have a hard time wearing sunglasses.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.680]  They give me headaches
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.720]  when I look through the lenses too long.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.960]  So I just, I always bear it and deal with it.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.080]  I'll probably pay for it later,
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080]  but I don't like wearing sunglasses.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:35.960]  I wish I could.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.860]  They got blue eyes too,
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.180]  so they get burnt up real good.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.300]  If I'm out at the pool or something
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.580]  for like two, three hours at the beach,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.060]  it's like, god damn, dad's gotta go.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.500]  I can't see shit, you know?
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.220]  It's time.
[01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.510]  Yeah, you don't look like you
[01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:58.110]  and the sun play well together.
[01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:01.070]  I cover up.
[01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:03.190]  I hang out in the sun.
[01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:04.030]  That's right.
[01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:05.190]  I hang out in the sun,
[01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:07.030]  but not by choice.
[01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:08.630]  I try to cover it, hide from it.
[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:17.350]  The more 80s they look, the cooler they are,
[01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:19.790]  I feel, at this point.
[01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:20.830]  That's right.
[01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.270]  Everyone always told us,
[01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:24.990]  oh, you can't have pink or purple.
[01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:27.150]  I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm gonna have a pink
[01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:29.470]  or purple freaking set of glasses,
[01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:33.230]  like sunglasses that are just crazy as hell.
[01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:36.310]  I'm very comfortable in pink.
[01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:38.150]  Pink shirts, pink shorts.
[01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:38.990]  Me too.
[01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:40.270]  Pink glasses.
[01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:41.830]  I'm good with it.
[01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:42.670]  Pink toenails.
[01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:43.670]  Gotta be comfortable.
[01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:46.230]  My toenails are burning turquoise.
[01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:47.550]  With the water.
[01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:50.510]  That's the only excuse there.
[01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:52.030]  I'm good with that.
[01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.870]  That's cool.
[01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:53.710]  That's good.
[01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:54.550]  That's a good dad.
[01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:55.390]  That's a good dad.
[01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:56.230]  You're good.
[01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.550]  Let's see if we can get the toenails on camera.
[01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:58.390]  There it is.
[01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:00.550]  There you go.
[01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:02.110]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:03.070]  You gotta get him back up.
[01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:04.790]  I didn't enlarge the screen.
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:05.630]  We're good.
[01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:06.950]  You gotta give me a head job, Peter.
[01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:11.070]  We're not in my feet hole screen.
[01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:12.710]  I gotta put him in a cup
[01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:15.470]  so I don't get touched in the balls by my sons.
[01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:16.390]  It's okay.
[01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:17.510]  It's all good.
[01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:21.870]  I'm very modest about my former foot modeling days.
[01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:29.230]  Can't you tell I'm trying to be elusive with my sunglasses
[01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:32.070]  so that people don't recognize me after showing my feet?
[01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:35.390]  Who is that guy?
[01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:42.070]  Are we in the middle of that scene in Zoolander?
[01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:47.070]  Where are all you guys with London?
[01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:54.230]  You already harvested the stuff from Tyler, right?
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:57.830]  Yeah, and smoked it and ran a second round and smoked it.
[01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:02.550]  Wow, you are a go-getter.
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.510]  I'm already on round two.
[01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:07.830]  You got it done.
[01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:09.150]  You got it done.
[01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.550]  You got it done.
[01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:11.590]  I got it done.
[01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:13.750]  I took the ladies and I ran them
[01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:17.790]  and I took cuts of all of the ladies
[01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:21.390]  and I had about 10 of each, 10, 12 of each.
[01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:23.390]  And I gave away all but five of each of them.
[01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:25.710]  And I picked the one that was the best
[01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:27.870]  and I just ran that again.
[01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:31.030]  And then now I got to shit to no other stuff
[01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:32.190]  that needs to go down.
[01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:38.430]  Where's Corey tonight, by the way?
[01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:42.470]  Oh yeah, he's in Maine somewhere.
[01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:45.070]  Yeah, he's in Maine sleeping.
[01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.910]  Midnight.
[01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:48.270]  You know, it's all good.
[01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:50.430]  He's coming up on it.
[01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:53.070]  He's coming up on his harvest.
[01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:57.190]  The next tester thing going?
[01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:04.190]  Well, that too, but the next CogU conversation
[01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:10.190]  and then nerds, because I think Rotten Skateboards
[01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:14.710]  is about to, actually he's harvesting this week.
[01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:16.990]  So, oh fuck, he may have already.
[01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:18.750]  Actually, it's the end of the week.
[01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:22.070]  So he most likely.
[01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:23.390]  This week's over.
[01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:24.230]  Right.
[01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:25.070]  Yeah.
[01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:28.870]  Which was what we were shooting for.
[01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:30.990]  So evidently that's not gonna happen.
[01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:32.830]  But I'm excited.
[01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.070]  That's not gonna happen.
[01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:37.510]  But yeah, and then to get the next one,
[01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:39.270]  whatever that may be, going.
[01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:43.670]  Yeah, I got some secrets coming, so that'll be fun.
[01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.070]  It'll be fun to pick something fun.
[01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:47.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:48.790]  I'm gonna go through it.
[01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:50.390]  It's gonna be pretty cool.
[01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:52.350]  We'll do something really interesting.
[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:55.110]  Something, I've been thinking about it.
[01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:57.350]  So get ready.
[01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:58.190]  Buckle up.
[01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:01.830]  So London, are you appreciating the joys of editing video?
[01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:06.350]  I've done editing before and it fucking sucks ballsack.
[01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:10.630]  But, it's absolutely, absolutely terrible.
[01:30:10.630 --> 01:30:12.350]  But the content's pretty fucking good.
[01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:15.350]  And the good thing is, is I tried to pay as little attention
[01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:18.910]  to what was actually happening while it was happening.
[01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.950]  So it was like, it was content that I would watch.
[01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:25.030]  Now I'm just being forced to watch it 18,000 times
[01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.870]  while I edit it.
[01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.990]  Yeah, that's the joy of doing something live
[01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:32.270]  is there's zero post-production.
[01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:35.790]  Which, when I discovered that, I was like,
[01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:37.550]  oh my God, this is so much easier.
[01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:39.670]  You know what I mean, Tyler?
[01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:41.550]  You've seen, like, I even still have one of you
[01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:42.710]  that I'm like.
[01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:44.910]  It's somewhere in there.
[01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:49.030]  How hard do I wanna, I basically wanna pass it off
[01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:50.950]  to other people and be like, all right,
[01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:54.190]  here's the backlog of shit that I never got to.
[01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.230]  Most expensive fucking thing ever.
[01:30:57.230 --> 01:31:00.190]  It's so expensive for editing too.
[01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:01.750]  He's got magic.
[01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.630]  He's got magic sitting there, you know,
[01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:06.510]  and just can't, you know.
[01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:07.350]  Pure fire.
[01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:09.430]  Just can't pull it out of there, you know.
[01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.670]  Pure fire, you know.
[01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:13.390]  So, yeah.
[01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:15.190]  Yeah, I also, yeah.
[01:31:15.190 --> 01:31:16.830]  Do you remember at Tom's house?
[01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:21.830]  And then at the townhouse, you and Eric.
[01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:27.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.990]  How big is the file, Peter?
[01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:31.590]  Of which one?
[01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:34.350]  The recording that you need to edit.
[01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.750]  There are many recordings I need to edit,
[01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:38.590]  and many of them are like.
[01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:40.390]  Of Mr. Tree's specifically.
[01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:45.030]  There are two, but there are like multiple cameras
[01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:47.910]  and multiple audio files.
[01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:50.870]  And that's where my motivation is like.
[01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:51.710]  That's a good one.
[01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:52.550]  Good job.
[01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:53.390]  I'm like.
[01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:55.470]  Because there's a lot of us talking, you know.
[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:57.470]  But it's like all syncable, and it's like,
[01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:00.670]  how long is the actual thing?
[01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:03.590]  Is the actual like recording?
[01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:05.750]  I'm a long form kind of guy.
[01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:09.750]  So I think the one at Tom's was like a couple hours.
[01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:11.830]  Probably an hour or two, yeah.
[01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:15.950]  Yeah, so the one at the townhouse, Otis edited it.
[01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:20.950]  But I feel like he used like the audio.
[01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:29.310]  I was like, I had a microphone in front of each person,
[01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:31.230]  and they're both talking into the microphones.
[01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:33.630]  Yet we're not hearing them through those microphones.
[01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:35.510]  We're hearing them through like something else.
[01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:37.350]  And he was like, oh.
[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:38.350]  And then I was like.
[01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:41.630]  So can you lose the good audio?
[01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:44.190]  Or did you just lose track of it?
[01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:48.390]  I think it was like.
[01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:52.270]  Probably just selected the wrong audio.
[01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:53.110]  Related.
[01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.950]  Yeah.
[01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:58.230]  Like if I opened all that stuff up,
[01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:02.790]  I'd be like, here's the audio from mic one.
[01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:05.630]  Here's the audio from mic two.
[01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:09.190]  But then even like when we did this at Tom's house,
[01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:14.190]  and I come home, I have those little body pack receivers.
[01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:20.630]  And then it's not a flash drive.
[01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:22.910]  It's like the super tiny one.
[01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:26.310]  So then I have to like pull a bunch of those
[01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:27.950]  out of like all these devices,
[01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:30.670]  and like put it in another super tiny thing.
[01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:33.310]  And then I need to like pull each file to my laptop,
[01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:34.630]  and then I need to organize them.
[01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:37.310]  And then it's like, all right, that's just the audio.
[01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.790]  Now let's move on to the video.
[01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:40.510]  And it's like, all right.
[01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:41.350]  And then.
[01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:46.310]  Yeah, I'd love to do one of these sessions
[01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:48.950]  where I just show the timelines of some of the videos
[01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.110]  I've edited in the past.
[01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:55.110]  Where like audio levels I'm like constantly adjusting
[01:33:55.630 --> 01:34:00.630]  of like four microphones, six microphones sometimes.
[01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.830]  It's.
[01:34:04.670 --> 01:34:05.510]  Yeah, that's fun.
[01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:06.550]  That's easy for me.
[01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:08.270]  I'm like, I don't know how to do it.
[01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:11.390]  I can't even, I just, I'm out of the whole,
[01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:14.590]  I don't, I can barely turn on a computer.
[01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:15.550]  You know, so.
[01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:17.190]  My motivation for any of that,
[01:34:17.190 --> 01:34:21.110]  like I've done so much of it over the past like 10 years.
[01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:22.310]  And then at some point I was like,
[01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:23.910]  I just can't do this anymore.
[01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:25.030]  Yeah.
[01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:27.070]  It's all good.
[01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:29.670]  There'll be more goals, you know, we'll get some more.
[01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:30.510]  That's right.
[01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:31.630]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:32.470]  You just gotta mind.
[01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.790]  When do you least expect it?
[01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:34.630]  That's right.
[01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:37.150]  Some Mr. Tree's knowledge droppings.
[01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:42.150]  Big, stinky knowledge droppings from Mr. Tree.
[01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:45.070]  That's cool.
[01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.910]  That's fun.
[01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:48.310]  Yeah.
[01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:49.150]  Oh, this is fun.
[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.310]  No, so that's why like the Tuesday night stuff,
[01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:53.750]  I'm psyched, because if you,
[01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:57.950]  you can be like holding court with people.
[01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:59.310]  Like I liked when you and Eric
[01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:01.190]  were just smoking each other's weed, right?
[01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:02.030]  Like we're all just like.
[01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.870]  Yeah, just hanging out.
[01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:04.710]  That was cool.
[01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:05.630]  That was way cool.
[01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:07.910]  No, I really, yeah, just hanging out.
[01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.830]  Like I said, getting together with cats, man,
[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:10.670]  is always fun.
[01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.030]  So if you can bring microphones and stuff,
[01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:14.390]  that's always fun for everybody.
[01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:16.390]  And everybody gets to join in, you know.
[01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:17.670]  Everybody can watch and hang out.
[01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:18.510]  It's cool.
[01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:19.710]  It's like we're all smoking.
[01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:24.150]  The editing is a pain in the ass.
[01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.870]  Yeah, it's exactly.
[01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:26.950]  It's a nightmare.
[01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:27.830]  It's not fun.
[01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:30.310]  But there's like one,
[01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:31.630]  there's one I know that's in there
[01:35:31.630 --> 01:35:33.430]  and somebody asked me what's wrong with this plant.
[01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:36.390]  And I'm like, oh, that plant's being over watered.
[01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:37.230]  And they're like, really?
[01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:38.470]  And I like walk over to the plant,
[01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:39.430]  pull it out of the pot.
[01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:43.150]  And it's like just pouring water off the bottom of the plant.
[01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:44.750]  It's just drowning, you know.
[01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.790]  The whole time I was like, there you go.
[01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:48.950]  It was exactly what was there.
[01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.310]  There's cool stuff in there.
[01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:02.550]  I don't know what you guys wanna do,
[01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:05.510]  but I got a little one that I gotta go help out.
[01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.990]  Yeah, we can call it.
[01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.830]  I gotta do the same thing.
[01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:09.270]  My headphones gonna run out of juice.
[01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:11.670]  So then I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do.
[01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:19.990]  Let's wrap it and then be back in a couple of weeks, I guess.
[01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:24.070]  See if we can drag Corey and them out
[01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.070]  and see how that goes.
[01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:27.550]  Yeah, you should have some conju on stuff
[01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:28.390]  coming in by then.
[01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:29.710]  That'd be cool.
[01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.270]  See what he's got going on.
[01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:33.990]  I was kind of hoping you'd be here
[01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:36.390]  and you have some stuff ready to go for this one.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:40.620]  Oh, there you go.
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.700]  My headphone finally dies.
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.540]  Okay, guys, well, we're gonna summarize it
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:57.740]  and do the ciao.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.540]  So say ciao, Mr. Trees.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.420]  Where can we get ahold of your stuff?
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.340]  Daga.garden.
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:06.180]  That's the new name.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.100]  Well, for random one-off things and cool stuff,
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.140]  there's some new work.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:16.760]  There's gonna be some stuff going up in Daga
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.600]  in the next week.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.920]  So be checking, be looking, be fun.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.000]  Any questions, anybody has problems?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:26.920]  Let me know, man.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.520]  Anything, any questions, any problems ever?
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.200]  Not happy, just let me know, man.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.680]  Let's work together.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.680]  Fuck yeah, they're good beings.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.040]  Coastal, you got anything you wanna say before we go?
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:48.960]  Just I really, really want people to support Daga.garden
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.920]  and they really do a lot for the community
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.920]  and every time you spend even a few bucks on some seeds,
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.120]  you're really doing a lot more for the community.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.800]  And it just, it really is a huge deal
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.320]  to really just try to support Daga.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.760]  So that's all I wanted to say.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.200]  It's funny because what you just said
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.000]  is kind of paraphrasing what my wife was saying
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  into my ear for those five minutes.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.000]  She was like, I fully support what you're doing here.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.240]  I'm totally psyched you're in the basement.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.400]  Doing what you love.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.200]  Yeah, none of those things came out of her mouth.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.400]  We have-
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.360]  That's great, I love it.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.640]  We're on our first week of school for my eldest.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.680]  So it's like first ever school ever, ever school.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.360]  So we're adjusting and-
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.680]  That's big dude, yeah, good luck.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:08.840]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.280]  Yeah, I feel like three kids is just like my face
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.880]  getting speed bagged all day.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:17.680]  Once they start out populating you,
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.200]  then you start like, I feel like that's worrisome.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:22.880]  Once they're buddy dude.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.040]  There's more of you than there are of them.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.920]  Maybe you made a poor decision.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.360]  They can revolt.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.200]  I always say it works.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.560]  You know, they can win.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.960]  They can revolt and they can win.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.120]  They can out vote you.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.360]  I had one choking me out
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.560]  and the other one pounded me in the balls the other day.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.880]  So it's like, you gotta take your choices, you know?
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.320]  Yeah, at this age,
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.440]  that's why I definitely appreciate having three girls.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.480]  But it's not like the teenage years
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.440]  where like you and I are gonna just be inverse.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.920]  You're gonna be like, life is good.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.520]  Now I'm gonna be like, the stress is just starting.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.360]  Oh my God.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.960]  Teenage daughters.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.080]  Don't give me a heads up about that.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.480]  I had two of them.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.520]  I had two girls and they're already terrors.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.320]  One of them, I don't know how she climbs on stuff.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.760]  It's like fucked up, man.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.600]  The other day I found her.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.240]  She's like free handing the oven.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.200]  She's like almost made her way on top of it.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.000]  Just like grabbing the,
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  she's like climbed up on like fucking ninja.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.320]  Like how?
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.520]  How does the baby do that?
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.480]  She's a year.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.600]  She's a year old.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.080]  How is this baby supposed to be able
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.760]  to have this grip to climb?
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.600]  Nuts.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:52.440]  She like grabs on to things.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.280]  She can't.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.520]  I'm getting very tired, Peter.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.120]  And I got a ton of programming coming up.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:58.960]  It's great.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.880]  We have a lot of really great shows coming.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.840]  But I'm very excited about it.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840]  You guys gotta check out.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.760]  We got the SIFT coming with Ron Harrington.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.200]  I know he's sending you some beans, Peter, right?
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.320]  Good question.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.240]  I don't know.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.080]  I got a-
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.120]  He mentioned something.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.240]  We've got Simon from Serious Seeds.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.560]  That, do I have the name right?
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.680]  The guy who's behind Serious Seeds.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.520]  He's been talking,
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.240]  come on the show we were talking with Joe.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.920]  We're gonna do the SIFT.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.960]  And that's gonna start in October.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.520]  End of September we have the Butterfly Sessions
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.760]  which is an all female show.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.600]  It's pretty cool.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.680]  We got a Glass show.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.520]  And they're like,
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.200]  these guys are going so hard, Peter.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.040]  They're getting like,
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.600]  getting three cameras set up in their space.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.480]  They're gonna have an artist go in
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.360]  and they're gonna be like talking and training.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.200]  And they're like,
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.040]  what else can we do?
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:52.880]  What else?
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.720]  They're like,
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.400]  they're so fucking eager and excited.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:56.240]  And they're like-
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:58.640]  I like when people motivate to make the production good.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.600]  They're like,
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.800]  I'm gonna do three cameras.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.640]  Yeah, they're like,
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.680]  we'll do one on a phone
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.840]  and then we'll have two off of our computer.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.720]  So I might need your help to make sure that they get good.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.680]  I do love that a phone,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.040]  cause historically you'd have like,
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.880]  like I have a video mixing board
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.280]  then I have like multiple cameras that can plug into it.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.960]  Or you could get like a wireless video transmitter receiver
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.200]  so you can be untethered.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.920]  But like being able to also have a camera
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.560]  makes like the production people are like,
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.400]  holy shit.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:35.400]  Like they just cut to the stage camera.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.680]  Like at Emerald Cup,
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:37.520]  I brought a,
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.160]  just like a phone up to the stage.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.000]  And we were like-
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.840]  It's a mic in a camera.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.160]  We're probably not supposed to be broadcasting the,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.840]  like, cause it's like big name bands.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.720]  We're like broadcasting live onto YouTube.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.560]  And I'm like,
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.160]  I hope Tim doesn't notice this
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.120]  and tell us to cut that shit out.
[01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:05.650]  That's all I gotta say.
[01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:06.690]  That's the shit.
[01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:07.610]  I don't know more.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:13.340]  All right.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.940]  Well, everyone have a good night.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.180]  I gotta go.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.500]  My kid bailed too.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.540]  Like I knew I watched it happen, man.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.460]  And I know the greatest thing is nobody will let it,
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.180]  make a shortcut of this later on.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:28.660]  But like I'm watching my wife pulls out these pillows
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.060]  from the couch that she's removed for some reason.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.380]  I don't know why she's removed the pillows from the couch.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.580]  But she's removed the pillow from the couch
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.340]  because it looks cooler and it's funky
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.420]  and now it's lower.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.660]  So it's more functually or something.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.020]  I don't know.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.060]  Shit happens.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:42.900]  It gets weird.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.740]  Okay.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:45.820]  So now we don't have pillows on the couch.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.180]  We live like weirdos.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:48.020]  So anyway.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.780]  Is your oldest still awake?
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:51.620]  What?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.460]  Is your oldest?
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.300]  No, my youngest is,
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.940]  she's been in a lot of trouble over the last whole week.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.460]  Just horrendous trouble.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:57.300]  So anyways,
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.140]  the pillows are on the floor
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.060]  and my youngest is standing on top of them.
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.100]  Right now.
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.780]  That's not gonna go well.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:07.340]  That's not gonna go well at all.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.940]  And then all of a sudden I turn around
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.380]  and the kid's just fucking face down in the floor.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.420]  Like fucking fell off the pillow,
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:16.380]  went straight down.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.540]  I'm like, oh fuck.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.380]  There's like nowhere I was gonna stop that.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.820]  And oh, it was bad.
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:22.900]  And yeah.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.340]  So I gotta go deal with that situation right now.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.700]  But yeah, the kid's got a really hard head.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.060]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.160]  It's like, I'm good, but yeah.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.280]  My headphones are dying.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.120]  So if I click out, don't.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.240]  And I'm just gonna smile and nod.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.840]  Yeah, exactly.
