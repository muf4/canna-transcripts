All right back in our lives Future Cannabis Project FCP02. Soil Born
Addiction says we're working on the 24-7 stream these days. Loyalty Cannist, long
time no see. Thanks for joining us Nolly. But we are live and we're gonna have a
fun conversation tonight. Chat you're definitely part of it. Everybody watching
on the replay you're part of it because we're talking about community. We've got
a pretty freaking awesome one. There's a lot of things that I love about it and
it keeps getting bigger every day. And it kind of the cool backstory, well I say
it's cool, but the backstory to the episode is you know there's a lot of
fun community members that we have around here. Somebody that you've
probably seen in chat, Chris Guerrero, Christopher Guerrero. He's in chat a lot.
Yep he sent me he sent me a DM the other day and I get you know I get links from
people saying like dude shows awesome you know watch this or check this out.
Sends me a link and I click on it and I see you guys and you guys are sitting
there doing some pretty cool things. You were doing some seed giveaways. I love
the rubber ducky races but you know it's kind of one of those things that it shows
how wide and how great that the cannabis community can be. You know it was just he
sent me the link I clicked on the link I connect with you guys I see you guys
doing great things. Things that I believe in. Things you know conversations that
you were having are things that I absolutely support yet we've never had
the chance to talk before. So it's cool when we can you know get the like-minded
individuals together and just kind of you know shoot the shoot the crap. So I
want to want to introduce you guys real quick here. Sorry for the long-winded
explanation but you know this this shows about community and I caught you guys
doing some awesome things. So I wanted to bring you on here and maybe talk about
some of the other things that you guys are doing as well. But first we got up at
the top we got Aaron UltraFire Genetics coming from the last place with light on
this earth at this hour. How you doing tonight buddy? Hey what's up what's up
Chad. Thanks for having me on Chad. Yeah yeah my pleasure. And down in the bottom
there we got Universal Element Genetics. How are you doing tonight sir? I'm doing
good I'm doing good. Glad to be here. Thanks for having me. Yeah yes definitely.
Smoke to that. So you know okay so the other day it was more than just duck
races which I absolutely love. Can you tell me a little bit about you know what
what you guys were doing there and why you think you know that might have been
a good thing or what what prompted you to get on and do some of those things?
Well I was... Oh God. No go ahead that's fine. So I was there to support Joe
Universal Genetics. You know he's been going through some hardship and I just
wanted to extend my support to him by you know sweeten up the deal on the duck
race to throw in you know a bunch of packs. So that's what I did.
Basically like you know people have been kind to me personally and they've helped
me out so I wanted to give back you know to the community and to you know to
people. We do these kind of things all the time. Team Urban Grow is our
team. We got about 30 like-minded individuals that are always willing to
help teach people how to grow or you know help them get their grow started.
Walk them through any kind of issues that they're having. We do giveaways all
the time. We give away seeds to veterans and people with terminal illness so that
they can get their medicine for free. You know our captain the guy who started
Team Urban Grow, Tom, he actually you know makes RSO and FECO for veterans and
people with terminal illness. He takes some of his entire grows and
dedicates it to this and people you know have donated trim and CBD lines
to this cause also. And yeah so I mean it our whole team is all about
helping people out and we it's all love and that's one thing that we really love
and appreciate about this community the cannabis community in general is that
it's all love you know that people keep that hate in their back pocket and they
are out here showing love. Well that's good man it's easy to be petty I mean it
really is but you know we don't always have to be and there's a lot of people
who kind of rise above that. They might have been through some other things in
their life to emphasize what's really important to them but you know I say a
lot of times too you can kind of tell or you know judge character by the words
that people choose to use. There's a lot of positive and there's a lot of
negative connotations with words and it helps me to surround myself with people
who are more focused on like a positive light. You know there's a lot of stuff in
life that each of us can go through but with a good community or you know
just people to talk to people to lean on and you might not even have to be
necessarily talking about what what your issue is but just having somebody there
to be able to talk to is a huge thing and I think that's a big plus for this
community and I see it you know repeat itself frequently even just through you
know folks like yourself going live doing a show. I can't see you know say
how many times I've been in a bad mood or whatever and just want to turn on one
of the cannabis you know YouTube shows and and just feel like I'm with company.
Yeah absolutely yeah it's it's uh it's nice to have other people who love to
nerd out about cannabis to talk to you know what I'm saying like because I try to talk to
people in my life and they're like yeah man I get it you're obsessed with pot.
We've got a good guy who I met through the show Mr. Magpie he you know echoed
the same thing he's like man I can't have more than like a two or three
minute conversation with anybody I know before their eyes kind of glaze over and
they start and you start getting the yeah yeah that's cool all right you know
type conversation so we do we got some pretty wicked back and forth in the DMs
writing writing books but yeah just you know being you know growing for a while
it wasn't all it well it wasn't something that you really talked about
openly I still rarely you know anybody in the neighborhood I don't really even
admit to smoking pot but that's that's on me so you know I never really talked
about it I don't have the the person down the road where I could go like yo
bro this let's go get a cup coffee let's let's go catch some let's go catch some
waves so so the internet has been a big thing and it's it's really kind of how
you use it so I'm glad more people are using it for in the right way not all
not all internets is bad absolutely and it's a good way to spread good
information like I see your show man I see you you are you're giving you know
platforms to you know people out here spreading good information you know and
I think that's awesome thank you and what are you gonna say
there Aaron or did you have something to say there oh yeah I mean I you know I
made a promise with the guy upstairs that you know I would go and help people
so if someone reaches out to me and they need help they need seeds I'll just I'll
send it home you know so that's that's kind of what I've been doing lately yeah
that's awesome and you gotta you know you you live it that's you know another
thing it's you get the idea of you know this this would be good or this would be
right it's another thing to put it into action and you know you guys are
definitely fast fast on the action there so let's actually maybe let's let's
just get a little bit to know maybe you guys or maybe your journey into cannabis
or with cannabis a little bit more because again you know we can meet a lot
of a lot of cool friends through here so maybe we'll start with you Aaron well
we'll go alphabetically on this one you're like damn I'm double a I'm always
first why yeah it happened in college a lot too well for me it all started when
I was about nine years old my dad was working for Hawaiian Airlines and he was
he was commuting to Maui Kahului Maui every day so my parents thought hey what
you know what better idea than to move to Maui so we moved to Maui and before
we even had the shipping container unloaded my dad's like well I gotta
commute back to Oahu so so we were we were on we lived in Haiku Maui had about
two acres of land and that's where I really got into tropical plants and and
fruit trees so we we had two acres that was just completely landscaped I mean we
had islands of landscaped plants you know every single palm tree with tea
leaves and banana trees and it was it was amazing but uh you know it rained
like it rained like two or three inches a day out there in Haiku so in my spare
time every day I was pretty much mowing the lawn with a push mower and yeah it
was pretty crazy but yeah that's kind of where everything started for me I
learned about compost and mulching and from there I I just kind of kept going
and I started growing cannabis sneaking it behind my parents back kind of thing
around 12 years old and and then I fully got into it maybe about 2015 when I got
out of military so it sounds it sounds like you might have you know been
exposed early on to kind of like an organic style of growing or at least
working with the lands is that oh yeah yeah yeah oh big time yeah like if I
could show you my house it's like the only house with tropical landscaping in
my neighborhood so yeah that's awesome I mean obviously it's not tropical up in
Washington so when I visited Maui just the you know the vegetation is amazing
but I you know it's clear as day just the size of a lot of the leafs on the
plants over there are just mind-blowing to me the biggest solar panels I can
think of coming off of a plant so that that had to have been fun working with
that special kind of climate and being able to do some of these special type of
plants over there aside from cannabis yeah the upcountry like I lived in Haiku
so it was like kind of like in the lower the lower portion of the mountain that I
lived on and if you went a little higher up you can get up into like Kula or
Makawa it's it's a little bit more like a mountain elevation you know so it's
cool dryer okay dryer than the two or three inches a day yeah it's pretty wet
but it's warm rain right oh yeah yeah yeah definitely it's warm yeah yeah and
I mean that's I lived about I don't know we could hear jaws do you know the surf
break jaws yeah yeah yeah I could hear it the break from my house so Wow yeah
that's pretty cool that is cool I live I live near the ocean myself I can open
the door and hear if it's high tide or low tide but oh well there's some really
famous surfing beaches over there and jaws is actually out though in the water
a ways that's not that's not running up on the beach right no no yeah it's deep
water now don't you uh don't you live by famous break well I live I live right
by one of the best places to surf in the state but by no means it would it be a
famous break so okay yeah everything is no everything is short and on top of
each other here so and and you're wearing I'm wearing a four or five
wetsuits I've never surfed without a wetsuit how about that oh man yeah you
should come out here and check out like check out the 80 degree warm water all
right well I'm done hearing about that area what kind of brought you into
cannabis or maybe kind of started you on the road there well I learned how to
grow from both of my grandmothers early not not cannabis per se but they were
always both needed help you know planting flowers and their gardens and
things like that so so I got my green thumb early and often from them but then
you know I was introduced to cannabis because of my I had a kind of a rough
upbringing I was I was you know on the streets and not not like living on the
streets like homeless but you know I ran the streets and you know got into bad
situations and stuff but uh anyway so you know I smoked and I started growing
just so I could grow my own smoke and then I was a regenerative breeder for a
while just just to keep you know seed stock so I could grow next year and then
about six years ago I started getting into actual line breeding and working
lots so my son and I we had set out to create a genetics company and my son his
his mother struggles with with PTSD and borderline personality disorder and
fibromyalgia and things like that so and and my stepfather actually was suffering
from chemotherapy with cancer and so so we had a lot of people that were
personally affected by these kind of things and and cannabis they found
relief with cannabis so you know my son he's just so was so intelligent man
straight-a student I on enroll his entire life and he's he's always just
been absolute beast man but he actually passed away in July and so I decided to
carry on the torch and try to you know make make his dreams a reality and and
set out to create medical strains to help people with different illnesses I'm
a veteran myself so I suffer from PTSD and I'm actually I live in a legal state
and I'm I have a medical license so I you know I'm a legal grower and I just
uh you know I want us I want to make these dreams happen and I want to to
finish the thing that we started together and and I feel closer to him
when I'm able to you know to work on our dreams in that situation so so yeah
that's you know that's what got me on this path and wanting to you know in
this direction I'm sorry to hear that that's it's it's taken the words away
from me but you know it's for a lot of us being in the garden is kind of like a
Zen time it's kind of a meditative time it's a contemplative time for for you
know a lot of people you know it's like the bathrooms the place where you don't
get interrupted and sometimes that's where you get some of your best thinking
done but if you you know if you have the garden the gardens a better place to do
that you know I'll find myself just kind of looking into the plants just staring
at the plants for a while and and you know I hope that brings some relief to
other people too it's something that a lot of people people in the community
echo is that gardening is you know it's kind of good for the soul I guess for
lack of a better term so you you have some breeding projects that you've been
working on you know line breeding is pretty fascinating that's something that
I enjoy seeing people do I always like to see people take something and make
something different or take something that they really enjoy and lock that
down and kind of solidify it what what kind of things you know what are you
drawn to were you you know after the gas or were you after a blueberry or a good
profile what what kind of things have you been working on or or want to work
on so the most recent that I have done I'd actually just harvested I grew out
of Skittles female and then I crossed it with another project that I've been
working on for several years it's called quad og and the quad og is is four
different prolific ogs crossed together so I crossed two I crossed the SFE og
with the og Kush and then I took the I took the damn trying to think Tahoe the
Tahoe og and I crossed that with the rude boy og okay right so then I took
those babies and I crossed them together so that's where you get the
quad og so it's a quarter of each into that and I've been working that line but
I got I got a really good mail from that line I collected the pollen and then I
put it on this Skittles plant that I had that had a is really fruity terpene
profile and so all of the the quad ogs have been gas obviously and it's it's
really really stank gas too it's it's powerful it's some it's some really
frosty shit man it's it's good but what I was thinking with making the cross was
if I could get that gas in there with the fruits then that you know and then
both of them have a whole bunch of frost so if I could get all of that together
in one then I would have something good for some concentrates so is that is that
kind of the end goal do you smoke a lot more flour do you smoke a lot more
concentrates or how do you kind of break that up my smoke more flour typically
but I mean I already have several flour strains so my thinking in putting this
together was I thought it would it'll make for a good flour strain as well but
I believe it'll be good for concentrates that's cool the skittle the skittles was
something I was after to not too long ago I picked up a cross I had some
skittles in it and I was really hoping for kind of a fruity profile something
that you know what it would knock my socks off something I could work with
something that I could you know try to pass on and move forward with but that
cross gave me nothing but oregano turps it didn't work out for me yeah well it's
it's it was from ethos it was called temple runs well actually okay so runs
not skittles I'm sorry but it was called temple runs it was a temple cush times
the runs and it was an f1 so I was hoping through that you know I would get
some of the the parents from side from the runs usually f1 it's it's kind of an
even mix there so I was hoping I would get that yeah I was hoping I would get
that representation but I just didn't find it and I have a few more that I
could go through but Washington we have limited plant counts so you know sticking
you know what I say to plant count yeah well I like to like I just did a big
black truffle times banana cush line so I'll take those like right now I got
like you know a good amount going and of the f1s and then even before I even
open pollinate I'll just grow them to look at them to see if they're what they
are and whatnot and if if I feel like they're worth breeding I'll open
pollinate them that whether it's like a 10 10 seeds or a thousand seeds I'll
open pollinate the f1 that way I don't bottle open up the gene pool and not
bottleneck it you know so and then the f2 f2 I'll pop a bunch of the f2s and
you know then I can start getting selective on what I want because how do
you know what you want until you pop them and grow them so yeah you have to
you have to you know in my opinion you have to grow them out you have to go at
least a couple well I prefer to at least go a couple cycles with the plant to you
know get a feel for you know how it wants to grow what it wants to do what
maybe some of its constraints are some of the things that you know might be
worth passing forward it's one of those things it's it's it's getting easier
these days with access to better genetics to kind of get something that's
gonna be good no matter what with with frost but yeah I forgot where I was
going with that but yeah you have to run them a couple generations to really get
a feel for if this is oh if this is something you want to breed because you
don't want to waste your time with an eight you know especially you know like
universal elements you mentioned line breeding it takes time and if you're you
know working with the eight out of ten that's it's a lot of wasted time so you
do got to pull that fire and you know ultra fire genetics ultra fire is is a
is a good descriptor for what you're doing I I came across some of your
genetics and you've got a lot of fun ones in there so do you have anything
the favorite that you're working with there's something maybe new or something
old yet you're working with yeah so that black truffle times banana cush I got
from my friend Lori out here she she had a banana cush may mail I think it was
and she crossed it with her friends prize the black truffle and by 808
genetics and the the f1 offspring were phenomenal so she grew like she grew
like a hundred of the plants and there was there was hardly there was maybe a
little variation like you said 50 50 but some really good phenos in there so she
gave me one of her it was like a number 34 35 male and I hit it with my member
s4 that I've been working for a while by ethos and the gas candy s3 by a pocket
farms so yeah and a chocolate Tina that was by exotic Mike some fireman and what
else Clementine that was a f2 that I was
working across it what else oh and then I've been I've been working a paradise
circus line like crazy so I got that to f3 right now and that's a lot of my
crosses have the paradise circus in it now what can you tell us maybe a little
bit more about paradise circus maybe a little bit with the growth profile or
the nose or the smoke oh yeah absolutely so the paradise circus is a tropical
kind of cookies crossed with Tina and basically the phenos are like it's like
a 5050 variation of you're either gonna get a Tina leaning feet you know which
is like reeks of orange I mean it's like like almost like a citrus sap or just a
rotting orange smell or it's gonna be like a cookies like cookies and cream
kind of you know a tropical kind of cookies smell to it it's a good really
root oh yeah really really really really rock-hard buds the calyx to leaf
ratio is excellent I they grow like really well in a sea of green you can
like two foot plants with pretty tight inner node spacing they can handle like
upward of 1500 ppm no problem well I'm sure a lot of orders you know I'm a salt
grower but I feed the shit out of them so I'm with you I speak ppm NBC yeah yeah
well my friend days and confused man he's growing some member berry right now
on his flood table and he's pushed it to like 2300 ppm Wow
yeah you never know I mean we were talking before before the show started
and I was telling you about some of my commercial experience and yeah man you
you run it until you find the line yeah yeah that's what we're doing and that's
it's exactly what he's doing he I think he put it in at night 1900 and then it
it uh as it does the water got evaporated out it the salt went up I
think it jumped up to like 2300 or something yeah yeah dry back that's can
be an issue in those situations but usually it's going in cocoa too so you
can always just keep that wet and just keep throttling it with food right right
oh yeah it's insane so so yeah but yeah the Paradise Circus man it's got like
one one Fino has like pink trichomes it's it's pretty crazy yeah really
really pretty plant and you know I liked it so much that I worked it you know I
kept if you if you like something so much then you should you should you know
preserve it by honoring it or honor it by preserving it you know you should
totally try and keep it yeah yeah now universal elements what kind of have you
been what have you been drawn to you know you were talking about the quad OG
and how that brought a lot of gas and the Skittles was bringing you some fruit
but if we were to go into your drawer right now what would be the first what
would be the first jar that you'd probably grab to load a or roll a joint
with I would say I got some Hindu Kush I got I got some Hindu Kush I got some
Maui Wowie got I got some Kim dog right here nice that's one of one of my
favorites is the chem families and this is some vanilla Kush is what I've been
smoking on you there's not much left that last blood that you're saving yeah
but no I got a few other lines as well man I got let's see I got a white widow
og that I'm doing you know hunt on right now I'm working on the f2 generation of
that one and then I got the Mac daddy that's on f3 that's a granddaddy purple
cross with the Mac that's some straight gas as well actually you had you had
another one too it was it was we were talking about those as the Mac Pearl and
I was like oh you know that interests me because it was the it had that sensi
kind of reference to it I was like yeah the early Pearl man that was back in the
day man that was one of my favorite strains growing up you know so once I
decided to get into a real breeding project man it was one of the things
that I wanted to seek out so I gotta plug myself in here yeah no worries I
do that often actually I'm half battery I might as well just do it right now so
well all right everybody's plugged in but yeah anyway the early Pearl man was
it was one of the first bags I ever bought for $100 when I was when I was
younger man you know I come from the era where you got brick weed and it was
there was all kind of you know seeds in it and you never knew you know what it
was gonna be like but uh you know then then came the era of good weed you know
and you know that was the first bag that I thought was worthy of $100 and I
love that shit so I was like I'm getting it I'm working with it and so I did a
big female hunt on it I found a keeper female and then and then I bred it with
the OG nice nice hey Chad yeah so what do you what would you call a true f1
like how many generations would you have to in read that just I'm just
curious what you would say so to be loose with it if I were to take two
parents and put them together their offspring would be f1 in the like
correct taxonomic sense it would be a hard place to get to starting with a lot
of the current genetics the f1 I mean polyhybrids is what we're working with
really so to get to like a real you know true breeding f1 there'd have to be a
lot of work how many generations that's gonna take good question you know
usually things can can get around f5 but that's that's the proper term the way
that it's usually applied and in most cases in in cannabis I was having a
conversation with Trevor sun-grown mids the guy's brilliant the guy is
definitely on that that academic level of understanding this and you know I I
kind of I was I was halfway joking but I'm serious it's like there's cannabis
breeding and then there's plant breeding now they're both the same but cannabis
breeding tends to use a lot of its own language and kind of classific
classifies itself in its own way and this f1 is a perfect example but a lot
of times in the cannabis community when you say an f1 it's universally
understood oh okay well that's the first generational offspring from two parental
lines right so that that's that's a long answer but how about yourself what where
where do you kind of fall in on that one yeah so you make you know yeah like
you said you're bringing the two parents together you make your f1s you in breed
those you make your f2s you're in breed on make your f3 I I don't know I was
thinking like f5 usually and then back cross it to like the parent plant like
hopefully or if not the f1 at least I would say but yeah so six generations I
yeah and that that sounds you know typically about right to me I think I've
heard like DJ short James loud kind of say about you know by about the time
that you get to f5 things are again if you started with something that wasn't a
totally just frickin octagon polyhybrid you'll get there and usually about five
generations to something that is consistent and homozygous spread across
yeah because you're now you're narrowing every generation after the f1 after you
open pollinate you're narrowing down selectively narrowing down each each
generation you're selectively breeding for some sort of trait that you're
looking for right so and then as you get to f5 it should the gene pool should be
pretty inbred and like tight to where you want it right so I think that's you
gotta watch them breeding too much because you'll lose vigor yeah that's
what that go ahead Aaron that's why you open pollinate the f1 I mean you don't
want to get too selective with 10 seeds you know I mean how how selective can you
be right and that's what's really interesting me about like mr. soul the
brothers Graham a lot of people know the story of Cindy 99 and the back crossing
and cubing and getting to a particular destination and you know one of the
things I liked about your Mac Pearl was I know that the early pearl is it's a
cultivar that's been around for a long time a lot of the EU you know Amsterdam
genetics they they tend to focus or have been more focused on stability as far as
like reliability homozygous equal representation amongst all plants they
tend to focus or their breeding seems to be focused more on that versus you know
the new new where you know RF you know RF to could have like 20 different
expressions from 20 different seeds so when you go into when you start with a
line like that this is something that I kind of did with some sensi stuff as
well you know what the representation of that plant is going to be because it's
consistent you've grown it out you know what it's gonna look like you know what
the traits are so when you make that first cross and you get that you know f1
you're able to really see that particular plants influence on the plant
whether it shows up or whether it doesn't and that kind of helps you
select for traits that you want instead of starting you know with a whole bunch
of mishmash I have a mishmash and something totally solid so when I put
them together I can see the different expression so that's something that I
thought was really cool about the Mac Pearl is that you have that solid line
in there to then make future judgment or future selections off of and that
helps and that's really how you know mr. soul did the Cindy 99 the cubing
that's how he explained it he's like getting elite get something that's man
put them together you know what the elite is select so right exactly and
that's that's what I've been doing I tend to you know like to work with older
lines because I've like you said I've worked them I've grown them out a lot I
know what they're like and I know what they you know what they smell and taste
like what they smoke like and you know so I know what I'm looking for when it
comes to all these lines I've been a smoker and a you know an avid advocate
for marijuana my whole life so absolutely I I know all these old lines
and I love to work them I'm working with some skunk right now I got some Hindu
kush I got some bourbon poison you know I'm trying to to get all these old
school terpenes back you know that's exciting those are those are classic you
know and they're classic for a reason I'm glad that you're doing that because
I have you know everybody has that fondness for some of the older things
and not everybody's chasing the new stuff I kind of I've been more in your
world where I'm trying to just nail down some things that that I've liked
and that I've wanted and that I'm working towards but there's also the
side now just having some more access to genetics some of the newer strains that
have been around I'm kind of you know I'm tempted with this too but again if
if we find that you know older one that we know in and out and it's it's pretty
steady across the board make some seeds with the newer stuff go from there try
to try to build something new I'm personally want to try to bring bulk
back I'm bringing bulk back I think we sacrificed and it's not just biomass but
you know I you don't really see many big donkey dick colas on a lot of these
newer cultivars that are freaking dripping with trichomes that you know
the old Afghani never was probably never will but yeah there's blend blend
the two worlds I guess a lot more I'm doing that I got some brand new stuff
that just came out from Dutch blooms I got some of his stuff that I'm about to
start working I got some mean ho and mean girls right now going and they're
interesting man there's some interesting looking plants I'm excited
to work with them that's awesome and Aaron you said you're you're bringing it
you were dipping in the cookies pool you like your bakery no no no I mean well I
do but I mean saying everything is cookies nowadays that's why it's like
smaller buds and you know stuff like that yeah smaller buds they're sticky
they're good if anybody who is a regular knows I loved it not cookies but
yeah it really is in everything man it really is a guy I love the tropicana
cookie though don't yeah don't tell anybody but so do I
I think so too less yeah so how about how about yourself Aaron with the old
school strains I know you're working with a lot of the newer ones going back
what would be a good old school strain and is there anything specific to the
islands that you you know have come across over the years that's just would
blow the the mainlanders minds oh yeah there's a widow on the big island it's
called 98 Aloha white widow it's it's unreal it's like you take one
token you're gone but um it smells really really strong like a chemically
smell and it's like it's really really greasy but yeah that's some of the best
shit I've seen around and my buddy has a Maui wowie he's been growing it for like
ten years but he just he won't give it up to me so yeah so until I get that
it's you know but yeah I haven't really grown too much landry strains out here
yeah and I'm I'm a indoors so Landry strains really are not on my list you
know maybe maybe if the shorter Afghanica's I could go with shorter
flowering time shorter stature but long flowering lanky plants just don't go
over in a small tent oh yeah no I totally understand and we have perfect
growing conditions out here so I can you know whether you have a greenhouse or
not you can just throw plants wherever so I got my plants all around all my
seedlings and shit so it's cool it's just protect them from that from that
daily downpour the little wind tunnel and you probably be good right yeah I
live on the west side so we don't get a lot of rain by the time the rain comes
from the east it kind of comes from the east and it gets pushed up the mountain
and as it pushes up the water condenses and it it kind of falls and then it
moves and once it goes over towards the west side it dries out there's no more
rain left because this is the dry part part of the island so okay do you do
kind of remember that and I'm you know forgive me if I'm wrong but it's a
heliocola it's the mountain oh that you're referencing oh no I live on
Oahu so that's like oh okay that's Maui I'm thinking of sorry yeah yeah that's
yeah that's my but uh it's the koala mountains so okay it's yeah it was a
trip somebody told me you could actually snowboard in Hawaii and I was like what
no so we went up there and my big thing is we almost ran out of gas so I was in
neutral for like 45 minutes on the way down the mountain the whole way I was in
neutral it was something you guys didn't need to know about but I thought I'd
blurt out anyways that's funny as hell dude that's where I first learned how to
surf was at the bottom of that hill do you know that little town do you remember
that little town at the bottom of the hill not very well no okay well there's
a town called Paia and I learned how to boxer at this beach called Baldwin Beach
so it's pretty cool it's awesome now he's a cool place beautiful place indeed
yeah beautiful place it was a it was a fun vacation long story short we
volunteered to get bump off of our flight back so we stayed a few extra
days flew back first class put up in a hotel that Britney Spears was staying in
at the same time like dude if you can ever get bumped off your flight
volunteer yeah yeah were you able to find smoke out there yeah amazingly at
the last day yeah I was with a friend's mom and I've got some stomach issues and
by like you know after a few days I was I was just not liking life and she
finally had you know called a friend who had lived on the island found a friend
and it was just like a little little couple nugs but they were amazing they
tasted just like spicy hash like I don't don't there was no name to it but I'm
tasting that taste now it was it was pretty amazing that's awesome yeah how
about yourself Universal Elements have you tried going the outdoor route or
have you been kind of like me inside for most of the time I I'm a I prefer
outdoor over anything you know there's no substitute for natural sunlight or
you know the actual ground I mean I'm an organic grower I do indoor as well but
you know I had to where I live man there's it's harsh climate in the winter
so I can't really grow outdoors man I envy you guys living out in the
you know out by the islands and stuff man that'd be awesome to be able to grow
year-round outdoors that's that's awesome yeah we're so yeah I like to do
outdoors when I'm able to I'm actually working on a new project right now for
for a medical strain I'm crossing the pre 98 Bubba Kush with the cherry wine
strain nice the pre 98 I got from Cali connection and then the cherry wine I
got from regenerative seed companies you know through Dutch blooms and Kevin
and all those guys so yeah I'm excited to work with a man I'm doing the phenol
hunt now I'm gonna find some some good you know versions of each and then make
a good cross that's awesome but my reasoning behind it is the pre 98 is
supposed to be really good for for a lot of different ailments and illnesses and
the cherry wine is supposed to carry about 14% CBD on average so my thinking
is is if I can cross the two and get you know something good in the mid-ground
it has a bit of both of that you know like a one-to-one and you know that
would be beneficial yeah it would be huge I'd totally be something that you
know catches my interest because you know like Bubba Kush, Katsu Bubba, the
Burmese Kush those do my stomach very well and and I do like CBD as well so
yeah no that that sounds like a great combination are you able to actually get
testing on on the plants to find cannabinoid levels because I have a
harlequin that I crossed into a few things and I've worked with it but I
have no way to go test does this actually have CBD in it and you know
what I'm passing on so I'm pretty kind of blinded there with the CBD and the
there which is why I've never done anything with it there are laboratories
here where you can get testing done but it's definitely it's not cheap yeah
yeah cheap price yeah prices is definitely one thing is in Washington
you have to have a license you have to be a licensed producer to get the test
so it's just a no go here. It's like 50 bucks out here I think it's like 50 or 60 bucks
yeah now tell me a little bit about that maybe UltraFire because obviously
they're the islands there might not be you know the option to or what is
the option because you can't really send it to the mainland are there is there a
good enough variety of testing facilities within reach where you're at
okay good because sometimes that infrastructure lacks behind the industry
you know everybody's like gotta grow it gotta sell it oh we tested to somebody
open a put a sign up yeah you can get a COAs out here I think I think they're
under a hundred bucks but I'm pretty sure they're they're here they test it
here I think I don't quote me on it but I think so and I know that the you know
the the group of islands there they have medical and soon to be rec is that is
that right I don't know you know right now there's a few dispensaries on the
island and they no one else they you can't sell to the dispensary and they
pretty much are monopolizing on everything they have the dispense free
and they grow their own and they charge like you know four to five hundred an
ounce so it's not really helping the people yeah so the black not at all
really yeah the black markets doing really well right now yeah I mean
they're they're trying to use a supply and demand model but they don't realize
the supply is greater than them well we're living a legal market but paying
illegal prices you know so yeah I mean for four or five hundred dollars an
ounce is just mind-blowing to me here yeah and that's what's like helping
people that's supposed to help people I mean what if you smoke two to three
ounces a month who can afford that yeah and RSO not only that but it's not
covered by insurance well that's what I mean yeah so I mean yeah so you had
mentioned earlier you mentioned 808 genetics and that came to me through
somebody else who's in the community and I don't see him in chat tonight but a
Smiley's Garden is another grower he's out of Michigan cool dude he does his
the organic takeovers hangs out with the in the effin talking shit with the
that's funny I said effin but yet I still said shit okay the fucking talking
shit with Eagle Shell so he's on there a lot but you know and that was a great
place it still is a great place but for community too I met a lot of cool people
there and they expose a lot of stories of people but the reason I brought that
up is is you know kind of like you guys were doing you know every now and then
they'll do giveaways and Smiley was given away some genetics and there was
one called turn it was a GMO times oh shoot I have it written down but it was
for made away genetics and I actually happened to win that one so I was like
oh yeah cuz it was you know I hadn't had any GMO or anything yet but you
mentioned the 808 genetics so you had good experience there yeah so that's my
friend Laurie her and her husband Derek they they're like big 808 genetics
growers so and the friend apparently was too so they uh they crossed their black
truffle and the banana cush and I mean so far so good I haven't seen any of the
f1s that I made yet I'm growing them right now but you know when you start
with good genetics that are good like you know they're good you're gonna get
good stuff you know you're gonna get a good f1 yeah yeah fire fire fire in fire
out so exactly exactly yeah I mean you it's it's hard to start with like
something shitty and expect expect the world from it you know you got to work
the fuck out of it this is true this is true so what what universal elements
have been some of your challenges or some of the things that maybe surprised
you with with the line breeding or things that you saw as far as like
expressions is there any anything that you know for someone who's thinking
about it or hasn't done it might be like oh that's good to know well one thing is
that in the in the f1 stage there is what I found is is there's usually you
know like five to ten different variants so each each individual plant
will be slightly different than the other ones and what you want to do is
try to link up all of the all of the traits that you can you know in one
plant so if you see the frost and you see the growth patterns that you want in
one plant and then you see you know the terpene profile in another plant that
you want that has the same growth pattern and cross those two together so
you can you can double up on on the growth and then you get hopefully across
with that growth and then the terpene profile as well as the frost so and so
what you have to do is grow out all of those and then look for those traits
individually in those plants that you choose and then find the ones that are
stand out above the rest you know the unicorns so to speak the ones that are
just completely you know beautiful and they smell funky and they got great big
giant buds and you know the golden ticket man you know what you do is you
just keep breeding that golden ticket so that you know you amplify those traits
down that line now has there has there ever been anything or a particular trait
that you looked for or that you found in kind of a stud male or was or has
selection really been from the offspring that it makes you'd be like yeah this is
a really dominant male or this is a really recessive male that's always
something people like to ask and there there definitely isn't a right answer
but there's a lot of things that people do look for well typically I look for a
good terpene profile and a good growth structure when it comes to the males
that's you know that's what I look for the most I want it to smell really good
and I want it to look like it'll it'll be vigorous and and have nice big fat
branches to support big fat buds and then in the females you know I'm looking
for also similar things the terpene profile the frost blood structure you
know the growth all those things that are beneficial as far as you know a
grower when they're going pot you know you want it to to be basically you put
it in the ground and the shit grows some fire you know like a lot of people they
don't know too much about what they're doing when it comes to growing so you
know you want something that's gonna be fire no matter what but it's gonna be
extra fire if you put a little love into it yeah basically I do breeding because
I love pot and so when I'm breeding I'm breeding for things that I would smoke
myself things that I would enjoy smoking you know I look for I like gas I like
fruits but I also like flowers I like some skunk you know I mean so I like I'm
a connoisseur I like to bounce around a little bit I like a little bit of
everything so when it comes to breeding I do the same thing like like I crossed
the cheese I got a UK cheese and I crossed it with the granddaddy purple
from the Ken Estes and and I my thinking behind that was more of like a wine and
cheese kind of vibe right you get the fruits from the granddaddy perp right and
then you get that kind of cheese funk from from the cheese right you mix that
makes the two so that was my thinking and making that love I like that I'm a
gun and going on a cheese hunt soon so that's awesome to hear yeah yeah yeah
my buddy my business partner was infatuated with cheese man who loved the
cheese and he actually got murdered a few years ago he got robbed but I started
working cheese to make a line in his honor so that's why I started working
with cheese. That's cool of you that's cool of you and you had you were gonna
throw in on that too Aaron? Oh yeah so I was gonna say how do you collect
your pollen Chad I just want to see what your method is because I got a
pretty good method so that's good my method is the most basic method in the
world it's called shaking the shit out of your plant I have been taught how to
store and save pollen I have read how to store and save pollen I have watched
videos how to store and save pollen never viable for me so I have to when I
do things it's all about timing for me because I'm on a perpetual harvest here
but if I time it to where I have the plants that I'm gonna seed and my male
if I start well so I'll start the females a week ahead of the male so if I
start those basically two to three weeks before I put my current batch into
flower while the while the batch that's in flower is starting to flower and just
get its pistols the male has already dumped on the females I intended to seed
and then it's just a balancing act of timing so I actually don't save pollen
I've just been really unsuccessful in it so I'd love to hear how you're doing it
okay so if you take a male plant which I do what I'll do is I'll wait for the
plant to really flower out and wait for it you know wait for a couple of little
premature male pods to open you know little pods and once all the other pods
are looking pretty fat I'll go ahead and I'll cut it I'll take that branch and
I'll cut the branch and I'll take the branch and I'll put it in like a foiled
box okay I'll put the whole branch on on the foil in the box and I'll cover it I
won't seal it because it has to be able to breathe okay and within a few days
all that pollen will drop onto the foil and all you do is lift the branch up and
it's just piles of pollen dude you scrape it all up okay that's all I do
and after you do that that same male plant it'll flush like four or five
times for you so where you cut it it'll shoot out like ten more flower bracts
branches and you cut those do the same thing you can do it like five times man
I get tons and yeah it's crazy so I will try that because I just I'm waiting on
seeds to finish I had the the Westport grape juice and I had a Burmese squash
that I put some of the Sunday Funday pollen on which was a sour tangy times
mimosa so I put those on. Mimosa's fire man I love that. It's one of those it's one of
those flavors that smacks you in the face like there is there is no this
might be mimosa it's it's either like this is mimosa or no it's it's not right
that's cool I love that too so that'll be fun to see come out but I also have
I've been going through the Twin Peaks which is a chem 91 to a chem sister
back cross two from skunk VA had a couple males there one showed kind of
earlier than the other so I took that one out but I am getting ready to put
that on the Westport's grape juice because that one I've been stressing and
growing for more than a few runs now and I feel pretty confident in it to
start making some seeds and then give those to testers in different
environments and really find out how it how it can handle some different
stresses I'd love to try to get some of the the chem introduced into there as
well again because the chem 91 is one of my favorites all time so I kind of you
know I'm a little excited I've got the females from that flowering right now
everything seems to be going good there but we'll see what I get I might be
jumping the gun with that male there but again that's more just kind of a
preservation for myself just to ensure I might be able to dig through some more
chem 91 stuff in the future and find that you know elusive thing that I'm
looking for and you had mentioned open pollination which is is a great way for
preservation and I'm curious like how how that works for you are you using
males from a different cultivars or are they yeah just like five males from the
same strains how do you run the the f1 gets open pollinated so I'll take like
you know I'll take whatever males I have and I'll just pollinate them with the
the females and I'll make you know the f2 generation after that so okay yeah
because yeah that's a you know a lot of the some of the other folks that come on
the future cannabis project they have large outdoor farms and then they'll do
that with you know land races and in big big square footage I guess is what I'm
trying to say and that's what I always think when I think open pollination I'm
just picturing like you know the 20 by 20 grid outside and just like a couple
of males on the corners or in the center and just letting them do their thing
well I'm taking a few males and I'm just basically going around and selectively
hitting like all the plants you know and I label them each male gets you know a
number and I live alone so but they're they're open pollinated in a sense that
everything is getting pollinated with each other you know I mean so yeah see a
comment in chat here says sub cool said males have a lot to do with flowering
time possibly I have no idea I do like sub cools work and that is some of the
first gear that I you know I always say my first pro gear that I started with
with some of the older TGA strain so that's cool
my charger real quick yeah no worries yeah I still got my earphones on see we
we've already plugged in we were ahead of the game right oh no no I'm just I'm
just busting balls here it happens all the time I'm good for at least one
talking while my mic is muted per show so just let me know when that happens we
haven't hit it yet so I did an open pollination project myself and I took I
took 15 different females like all different cultivars and I took five
different males and I put them all in the same tent and just and just let it
do its thing man and and so I took I took all those seeds and I gathered them
together and that's what the unicorn hazel is so that's why I called it the
unicorn haze because there's so much fire in that tent there was there was
DNA genetics kosher kush there was there was a wedding cake also it was a really
really far you know the wedding cake really purple cakey sweet there was a
Hindu Kush in there there was a Durban poison there was there was the Mac Mac
was in there I had a granddaddy purple there was a cheese there was a bunch of
them man but I got them all wrote down but anyway it was it was a lot and so
I'm really excited to pheno hunt through those and I'm excited for anybody that
gets a pack of those to the pheno hunt because you know there's so much fire
packed into those beans so there's any number of concoctions can come out of it.
Now how how did the Mac grow for you I've never grown it myself a lot of
people tend to say it grows slow or it's slower in veg and also sometimes it's
hard to kind of get pregnant like it's it doesn't like to take pollen that much
did you have any kind of experiences like that with your with your cut that
you had? Well the Mac that I had was actually a male oh okay and it was it
grew out it was pretty vigorous at first but you know as you know males are quick
to you know to go to pollen so I separated it right away and then
collected the pollen and then later used the pollen to pollinate but yeah it was
it was a vigorous grower and you know it was nice the seeds that I got out of it
after after I pollinated it and grew them out it was just covered in frost it
was there was like it was mostly bright green like a neon green with purple
specks covered in frost and lots of gas. Nice, I'm a gas fan. I'm sure you know how much
time goes into growing the seed the seeds and then de-seeding the bud and
then going through hand selectively going through every single seed and
squeezing every freaking seed man I mean my fingers hurt at the end of the night
they like my fingertips are hurting dude so yeah I just try to make sure I
give out the best beans like I'm meaning they they're hard and germinate
nothing no none of that popping garbage kind of stuff yeah. Yeah none of the
squishy stuff I just smile as I look around because I in my remodel I found a
shoe box that I had stuffed some seeded stuff with that I haven't de-seeded yet
and I'm like oh I forgot about this one. Skunk number one times Afghani. Oh that's
that's like Christmas Christmas right there man. Yeah I'm like now I've
misplaced it again I need to finish cleaning the wife is out of town so I
have a couple more days to clean right? Make everything look nice. Yes yes I uh oh I go I go
full bachelor pad meaning yeah yeah so cool I see Spidey. What's some good shit you guys have been working with like what's some of your
favorite new genetics that you got or are you anxious to grow? Right now I've
really been focused this last year with the it started as a Welch's grape juice
but that that had to change so it's Westport scrape juice now I'm really
excited about that one it's something that it produces good bulk for me
compared to other things that I've grown it lets off a whole bunch of trichomes
and it has just nice amazing smell like it really is almost that 10 you know
we're talking earlier it's like don't bother with the 8 out of 10 work with a
10 and so I've just been doing different things growing it this past year this
I've got one right now that's in a one gallon container trying to kind of
stress it that way I've got one where I've just been like loading it with food
almost trying to overload it and see what it does so it stayed it stayed
solid so in my environment at least which is why I finally okay I made a
cross with it and then you know give those out to other people who aren't in
my exact same environment and you find a little bit more of the real truth plus
you're able to do things in larger numbers that way is when you kind of
crowdsource and you community source it and that's the thing
well any plant can grow in a perfect condition you know like any
plant can grow really well in a perfect condition you give it a perfect
condition it's gonna grow perfect but like what you're doing is you're
stress testing it by you know over feeding it or stressing it in a smaller
pot or you know those are all good tests to bring out that intersex trait that is
recessive really so you know you're trying to bring out those recessive
traits that otherwise won't show itself in a perfect environment so that's
pretty cool yeah it's and you know you guys you know too and this is kind of
why we originally you know got together is you guys were doing awesome things
for the community one is just spreading the seeds you know that goes back to the
old saying of overgrow I love the fact that you know any anybody with you know
disability with veteran status no questions asked here you go enjoy call
me when I have a question anybody I mean if someone needs help I'm gonna help them
so it's not it doesn't matter if they're a veteran or they're I mean that's kind
of who we help for the most part but if someone hits me up and needs help I'm
gonna help them so that's cool and it's cool that you do you know that you work
with a lot of you know veterans because there's a lot that listen to you these
shows and there's a lot that probably don't have maybe the cannabis friend or
resource or somebody that they can reach out to just to talk about it or you know
again you share a lot of common experiences so it's nice to talk with
somebody who can understand the same experiences and that's it is it's
invaluable and you guys had kind of mentioned that on on the talk on your
live cast webcast I don't I'm old so I don't even know what they call it on the
Instagram you're not that old live streams live live live stream okay yeah
the live streams but yeah you know you're talking about that and that's
important and I and I want anybody you know maybe listening tonight these are
guys to reach out to you man yeah I want to remember is is all about is all about
helping the veterans and so any any one of us on team urban grow but if you you
know reach out to our captain Tom he Tom Green thumb he is you know he's our
leader he's the one that started the whole movement and got us all together
the dude's super positive man he's a great dude he's he started this whole
thing where he said if every time that you feel like you want to be negative or
you want to you know lose your cool say something nice instead of something mean
so it we're in a place where you know somebody who cuts you off and you'd want
to be like you know you say have a good day yeah you know or something like that
so so he's that started this whole positive movement right and then we got
we got our friend that's on our he's one of our team urban girl members his name
is Robert long and he's suffering from he has cancer he's he has also seizures
the guys he's dealing with he's dealing with a lot of things so hashtag team
Robert long that's a thing that we started with team urban growth to help
him to you know show him support and and show him that we're here for him we all
actually shaved our faces as well and in our heads and Tom even shaved his
eyebrows man because he's going through chemo and then we just wanted to show
him that we love him and that we support him and that we're here for him so yeah
you know hashtag team Robert long yep and it's awesome and awesome them yeah
when you know everybody could come together and rally for each other it's
you know it's it's a human a human condition to need to need some some
input some assistance sometimes that's a real thing and you know mental health is
something that I like to mention and bring up on this show and you know it
goes beyond just talking about I'm happy that there is kind of a conversation or
now that people are more just like yeah you know you should talk about mental
health but to really be able to talk about it or to really be able to find
people like yourself just to you know go back and forth with again we're all
gonna have ups and downs on our journey that's just the human condition and to
be there at the different times it is a great thing so you know again I
appreciate what you guys do there oh yeah absolutely I mean if we can all be
nicer to each other in this day and age man will probably be a lot better you
know we can help each other just not you know everybody's so mean these days man
it's like can't we just trying to put that energy into something more
productive you know so it can be and it's nice that we no longer really have
to put up with that in the cannabis community if that's your jam oh there's
plenty of places that will you know you get your fill there but before you know
sometimes in the days of the forums it was kind of a mixed bag you had to take
a lot of the bad with the good but these days there's so many outlets and there's
so much content there's so many like-minded people that man if that if
you don't want to put up with the bullshit you don't have to you just need
to look a little bit further because there are there's really positive places
out there and that is one thing that I love about the community that you don't
have to suffer through it anymore you can't find those people that are just
you know like you know what sometimes shit sucks but we're gonna make
something out of it we got it you know it life is what you make of it so yep
yep exactly you have to be resilient like the cannabis plant yeah yeah you
can't kill that plant man I mean basically it as long as that root zones
intact you can't kill that plant right and I mean you don't as long as it has
water and the root zones intact you can't kill it you can try and many have
almost succeeded but yeah so and that's another thing that you guys do that I
wanted to mention that's huge to me is talking about or talking for new growers
again pre-show I had mentioned the other day my mom asked me you know well
what's the difference between medical weed and regular stuff to me that is
such a like weird question because I automatically assume we all know the
difference we're all past that but we're not especially in other legal states
especially for the people who have lived through the reefer madness and a lot of
older generation honestly I think are the demographic that could benefit the
most from cannabis right there's definitely a lot of education that
needs to be out there a lot of different people on different levels from from
different perspectives and different backgrounds that are all trying to learn
and grow their own medicine and and not only that but learn how to you know
understand it as as a movement or a culture the the cannabis culture is
that's that's the greatest thing about the cannabis community and culture is
that everybody it's all love everybody works together you know it's not like
any other culture out here it's all love and it's it's everybody's happy because
they're medicated you know I'm saying oh there it's what you make it they're not
all not everybody's nice I mean there's there's some mean people out there you
just gotta you know put yourself in the right spot so and I don't have any mind
man if somebody's hating I keep it moving I don't pay him no line because
it's it's in most cases it's something they have going on in their life not not
me specifically or something that they're mad at me about or whatever you
know and I've learned this through my own experience through things that I've
suffered with right you know I can see people's pain in them and and I don't
hold a grudge you know to them for it I feel like if you're spending time and
energy focusing on hate for other people you're not focusing on the goals in your
life and the things that should matter to you and your family
right sorry hazard hazard of the occupation right
joking but no worries but yeah you know we're able to break it down to someone
who might be a new grower you know I do a homegrow show on Saturdays here and we
talk to the people of all experience levels and just kind of you know what
what has your experience been what are some of the lessons that you've learned
or something that you wish you knew that you know now so maybe to kind of flip
that script on you guys because again a lot of people that watch these shows are
they're on their growing journey already so some of the some of the basics some
of the things that we take for granted we don't necessarily cover as much I
actually am I'm gonna shamelessly plug I'm starting I actually have already
started it but I have my own YouTube channel now if you just search Chad West
port in YouTube it actually be a real help because I need subscribers I can't
go live yet I think I have like 48 subscribers but hook up something can't
you can't you run off something yeah yeah I mean I probably can but I
honestly this is the first time I've ever mentioned it and I've already had
I've got like you know five six videos up already it's just something I've
quietly been doing and I've quietly been a massing stuff but again it's geared
kind of towards a more inexperienced grower crowd it's not something that you
know I would do on this channel just because it's it's not needed here to be
perfectly honest it's not needed here but I know that it's still needed so
it's all short format type stuff so if anybody out there is listening if you
want to help a brother out maybe just click the subscribe button help me get
to a hundred just search Chad Westport Earth Creeper right on I appreciate that
loyalty organics right on guys I appreciate that I'll get off the get off
the blatant self-promotion here for a second back to the original point back
to the original point though thank you man it's again that that's my goal is to
get people growing and get them growing they're making their own medicine and
they don't have to be dependent on on big business yeah and then and then tune
in to the future cannabis project and learn you know some more of your options
and some more of the advanced stuff but yeah my my purpose is to get just people
growing at first because I I believe in the plant like we all do and we all have
seen the same benefits so I want to flip the script on the home growth side
for you guys for a newer grower coming into it whether maybe one or two lessons
that you've learned through your experience and maybe something that you
know now that you didn't know that you wish you knew and we could start with
you Aaron on that one well you know maybe have some of these new new new
growers out here yeah sure sure okay so I've killed a lot of seeds over my time
here okay yeah over the over the years and we know seeds are not cheap man I
mean no you're talking it could be you know five dollars ten dollars a seed or
whatever but anyway I killed a lot of seeds so I figured out how to kind of
get over that hump and what I do now is I use you know the root the root rapid
root plugs you know the rapid rooter plugs or whatever I'll take those and
I'll kind of stretch the hole out a little bit and then I'll drop the seed
in there just like drop a dry seed in there I won't germinate a towel or
nothing like that stick it in about halfway down the plug and then I'll take
the insert the tray you know like the 72 plug insert the clone dome and
everything and I'll I'll fill that 72 tray up with seed each one gets a plug
and then I'll put about a half inch of water at the bottom just regular old
water just enough so that the water will come up to the eyelet of the the sleeve
and when you put the dome on what happens is that water just kind of wicks
up I guess like osmosis into the plug and it keeps that plug nice and moist
but it's able to breathe so it doesn't get waterlogged like it would in soil
those those plugs are they can get wet but they breathe real well so they germ
super good and I'll put my dome on and a light on top of the dome and within four
days I'll have you know plants growing above the above in the light already so
yeah nice yeah that that is frustrating man germination it's not always user
error you never know how the seeds were stored or anything so it can get
frustrating sometimes but if you're picking up newer genetics yeah I mean
what what kind of germination rate do you expect from like a pack of new
genetics I personally think like you know at least 80% 100% the goal but
there's it's a plant you can't always control everything but I don't know what
what do you kind of expect or what do you see from newer genetics well I just
did a big seed pop of the black truffle times banana cush multiple strains I did
a hundred I did two trays so 72 in each tray so 144 and out of 144 136 terminated
or 139 but I had less than 10 that didn't germinate so that's awesome yeah
yeah yeah yeah I'm there with you buddy it's the that was my first hit of the
freak show so I need to let it be in the jar I just actually took it down it was
it was doing a two-week hang dry and I just couldn't wait so I just loaded a
little bit now I need to let it cure one of them the the one one is super
gassy like touch it gas smell it gas it's amazingly gassy this one was a
little bit more pine and berry wasn't as strong of a profile they both grew a
little bit differently one had the morphology more of the ABC the Australian
bastard cannabis that's kind of it has weird lease but it's more of like a
pom-pom and then the other one had the true like freak show representation of
like the least looked like ferns weird yeah that's what I was going after they
got that so they selectively got that freak show right by selecting the
weirdest mutating offspring I guess you'd say off each inbred offspring is
that how they did that yeah and I don't know the full story behind it and I could
be completely wrong here but it was something like 20 generations to lock in
these traits because you're absolutely right it's a it's a completely recessive
way super unseen recessive trait that they kept bringing out bringing out and
finding and locking down and passing forward I believe it was shapeshifter
that did that but that is a true example of what you can do with a focused
breeding program and enough time because again no you this the freak show does
not happen overnight guys in a consistent manner so I mean it's probably
the you know the line breeding like you were doing down there it's a timely
process well you're narrowing the gene pool like if you keep inbreeding
something and you keep selecting for that specific trait that you want you're
gonna eventually narrow it down and it can't get I mean it can't get more G
outside genes right so I'm guessing that's kind of how that works I guess
yep just keep selecting for that trait I mean you get them you can see the you
know the male and the females how they're growing early on to know whether
okay it's you know I see that trait in it let's cross these two back again and
try to keep you know adding more of that more that more of that until you
get it the absolute representation there and so each generation amplifies the
trait until it becomes homozygous yep exactly and then again I think it took
something ridiculous like 20 20 generations but again we've never seen a
plant like this either it's something that's super special I'm excited about
all the research that they're able to do now in the legal states you know I think
that that's what we've been lacking all along from a breeding standpoint is is
real research yes yes and once it goes federally legal knock on wood hopefully
soon universities will be able to dive deeper into it now they're kind of
figuring out ways to creatively skirt that system and in perform studies but
you know once once you lift that wall yeah they're they're ready to go so let
let's get back for a second real quick universal elements I wanted to ask you
about the first starter growers something that you may have learned
along the way that you didn't know then that you wish you did or maybe just a
couple lessons you learned that could benefit a new grower if you had any
input for them just something something simple for for a novice there um well I
would say don't overthink it you know a lot of people just they they overdo it
and they they act like I'll tell you my friend Tom is one I told you about
earlier is a perfect example he told me the first time that he got a plant he
brought it home he felt like it was a baby he said he he was terrified he
didn't know how to treat it or what to do with it you know he said he was
terrified he was gonna screw it up you know and and and I can relate because
that's you know it's a life that is in your hands and if you screw it up then
it's it's lost life you know so and if it's something you mean it means
something to you know like a cannabis has always meant something to me when
I'm growing it I'm passionate about it I put my all into it so I would say
don't overthink it don't over water you know make sure it has at least eight
hours of sunlight eight to eleven hours of sunlight ideally don't put them out
you know in full Sun when they're when they're too small or it'll burn them up
don't use a whole bunch of nutrients early on because they don't really need
it you know keep it simple you know a little bit of airflow a little bit of
water a little bit of nutrients when it's in you know when you're in your
veg phase you need lots of nitrogen right I would say products that really
have helped me that that I appreciate like super time is one that I use I use
it to it helps me to germinate seeds it boosts my productivity when it comes to
cloning I get pretty much a hundred percent on my clones and all I use is
is clone X and super time I get my clones in the clone X and then I put
them in my in my cloning machine aeroponic phone machine and then I just
run water and super time through there as far as nutrients I use a nectar
for the gods and I've found a lot of their products to be useful it's it's
made my girls way better than when I first started you know when I first
started I was using you know like shit you buy at Walmart you know like miracle
grow and dr. earth and stuff like that you know and but yeah I started using
the nectar for the gods and that's it's been really good I like their whole
line I'm using the advanced line right now that's pretty cool so was it it's
soil not cocoa right yeah it's oil okay they actually have their own line of
soil that I use and if I can't find their stuff then then I'll use you know
like happy frog typically and that's something that's you know it's usually
you can find I mean I live in an out here area now so I have to drive even to
get to the small store that doesn't carry things I luckily I have an
appointment the other day to out the the one store that's about an hour away
usually carries the soil brand that I'd like so I always load up the trunk when
I go by there I'm gonna have to do that again but yeah that also teaches you to
learn proper planting and crop rotation too because if you just took a whole
bunch of clones and they're ready for bigger pots but you have enough to fill
a couple three gallons that can put you in a tricky situation you actually just
gotta be prepared for a situation I couldn't I couldn't find any any soil
everywhere I went because it the season you know it was just gone there was no
lawn and gardens anywhere the one soil that I was able to find was some local
soil and it I got it home and I opened the package and it would look like it
had been dug out of a field and just put in a bag it was mud essentially like
clay mud I'm like what is this and I can't work with this man it probably was
too you made me just think of like the bottled water where it's like a company
with the freakin like municipal city water tap filling up a bottle put in a
label on it there you go they probably I'm sure there is somebody out there
just like local natural organic soil some dude in a field with a backhoe in
a bag yeah but that's all clay yeah that's and that's that brings its own
challenges clay in itself so yeah so what what advice would you maybe give
you can sell a sell poop on the side of the road man you put a sign up someone
would buy it right I always I always joke cuz I used to be when I was much
younger I did a lot of sales and the selling was like man I could sell a
ketchup popsicle to a lady in white gloves so yeah there's a lot of good
ones out there I wanted to maybe ask you guys for maybe a couple of resources
maybe websites that have helped you guys or organizations that have helped you
guys or help someone that's close to you for maybe someone out there who again is
is struggling a little bit you know they whether they need an ear whether they
need a professional so what you know maybe some of the things that have
helped you guys if there's anything that comes to mind oh yeah well honestly I've
I've learned everything off YouTube just different people like who is it mr.
griff mr. grows it and yeah canoe can you know just basic they have all sorts
of intermediate videos and obviously you're doing videos do so that'd be a
good source of information there thank you thank you yeah but trial and error
everything is it's if you if you learn through your own mistakes it'll make you
a better grower if someone caught if you get coddled by someone you're you're
never gonna make those mistakes you know so it's better to make mistakes and
learn and yeah definitely sometimes learning the hard way is is a good way
it's it's you know again it's what you make of it but yeah yeah learning her
mistakes sometimes are the best teacher well you don't have to learn I mean you
you obviously I mean we have like YouTube and stuff but if you can learn
from someone else's mistakes then you don't have to make those mistakes
firsthand but if you do make those mistakes it's okay because you'll learn
from them and be better the next time you know so yeah and how about you down
there universal elements did you have any you know websites or shows that's
that you that have been helpful for you there in the girl journey well I mean
YouTube obviously there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff on there man I
like your show I like I like all the future cannabis project shows I like
Canucks grow stuff I like mr. grow it stuff I like I like that science in a
pot dude that dudes pretty cool I like some of his experiments that he does
that I find that interesting I love science so anytime to you know put a
little experiment in there I like experimental growth stuff and I'm
always doing research that's been my partner in in learning how to grow as
far as like what I know now as far as knowledge I'm constantly looking for new
sources I read books I got Ed Rosenthal books that I've got and I've been
reading I got who else I got this right here Jeff Lohenfeld nice and reading his
stuff I haven't seen that one yet I'll have to check that out yeah so you know
I'm constantly looking for new information any kind of new you know
experiments that have been done any you know new information on cultivars or
chemovars anything that I you know has been scientifically proven to help with
different types of deficiencies it I'm going way way deep with this sorry I'm
high I forgot the question supposed to help new growers yeah so YouTube is a
big one man you know way the way of leaf I think is another website that's pretty
good I like I like leafly they got some good information on there leafly yeah
man I don't know no that's a good list that's a good healthy list right there
I'm looking everywhere for information man you know I listen to scientists I
like you know microbiologists and soil soil experts I you know I listen to a
little bit of everything man just because I feel like the more I can
understand about all aspects of growing the better I can do my job as far as
understanding the genetics and the plant itself and how it works and how it's
representing itself and and it's phenotypical expression within my
environment or within other environments and back to what you were talking about
earlier as far as testing genetics in in all different areas I'm really excited
because my grow group our grow group team urban grow is about to do a grow
off challenge with my genetics oh we're gonna be all over Instagram with with my
genetics yeah so we're growing out the highway cheese mac one frost that I made
all right tell tell us tell us about that what were what was it about the
parents that you're like you know what you two should get together well the
the highway man it was just it had the most unique terpene profile I've ever
smelled on a on a plant and I've smelled a lot you know I mean I've been in I was
in the black market long before you know I was in the legal market and and so I
smelled every kind of you know weed that came out you know it all seemed my
hands at some point and I smelled it or used it smoked it whatever so I have a
nice palate when it when it comes to these kind of things and man I'm sorry
I'm high I forgot the question no worries we were talking about the two
parents that you combined for the grow off string oh yeah yeah okay so it had a
really unique terpene profile it had almost like a pineapple terpene profile
it was just really really fruity and and funky man and I dug it and so what I was
thinking was is if I put some of that cheese funk on there that I could get
some some of the fruit and the cheese together right that was that was my
original thinking and the two plants were both exactly what I wanted as far
as the parents the male was the cheese and and the female was was the highway
man so I crossed them and then I grew out that lineage and then I worked the
line I got into an f3 and then and with the with that progeny I grew that out
and it had everything that I wanted out of it it had that that pineapple funk
the big giant bud structure the nice vigorous growth and that little bit of
cheese funk in there as well so then when when I had came across the Mac one
and I was lucky enough to get a male out of that I grew it out and I collected as
much pollen as I could and I used that pollen from that for the for that cross
so so I crossed that with with the highway cheese and then so that's where
you get the mix them so my idea about it was is I wanted to take that little bit
of cheese that little bit of fruit and then add a little bit of gas and try to
get the best of all three worlds so I'm excited to see what everybody's you know
expression is going to be in their environments all over the United States
and in Canada so that is awesome and that hits like three and again it's the
team urban grow grow off that you're doing Wow that hits that checks all the
boxes that'll be cool man good good luck with that and that's exciting that's a
that's a really cool moment to see your work out there as well getting grow by a
bunch of you know other people there's there's another person that's in this
community a guy he goes by the American one but he's he's very generous as well
and there's a lot of his his work around the the world actually at this point now
but you know it's like every time I see somebody post one of the picture of is
like Amy aces the Amy aces is a strain that he a lot of people have grown out
known for it's like I root for that man it's like hey I know that plant so I
think it's gonna be extra cool in your shoes to kind of be able to see what
other people are doing with your work that's that's an awesome thing so
congratulations on that thank you yeah I'm really excited about it man I
couldn't be more ecstatic and there's a lot of really great growers in our group
so it's gonna be an exciting competition to say the least because if you see some
of the buds that these guys are producing you know from all different
genetics from all over the world so so you know you can see on their pages
obviously the stuff that they're producing and then for me to see them
post my stuff and to grow it out and see it basically a giant pheno hunt man
all across all across America and Canada so that's really cool sweet yeah I
wanted to come back up to you ultra fire genetics too because you dude you're
like I said before man you're playing with fire there so what is something
that you're working on or that you're just looking forward to something that's
getting you excited that people should be on the lookout in this next year
because I know you got a bunch of you got a bunch of pots there working with
thanks for asking man yeah I got um well I have a bunch of sunken treasures
high Mac and max stomper so I think and I got all I got that from heritage seed
bank those guys are awesome over there so yeah I'm gonna probably go ahead and
work those and open pollinate them to get a big seed stockpile and then you
know and then go from there but yeah that and I'm just trying to see which
crosses are gonna be good to work so I have a lot of work I have a lot of work
already for me right now all by itself but um I always looking at taking on
something you know unique or or awesome yeah when it when it hits you you'll
know it when you see it you're like that's what I'm looking for it's like me
going to the swap or swap me I don't know what I want but I'm there and when
I see it I'm like that's coming home oh yeah well and then when you when you do
a when you do a big bean hunt like 150 300 400 beans and you do them in solo
cups or one gallons but I like solo cups because um you can see the expressions
dude you can see the expressions I'm not looking for yield I'm looking for Fino
typical expression and I want to see it amongst a big population so that's what
I do I'm glad I'm glad to hear that now I'm thinking on an absolutely much
smaller scale you know 10 10% of that but that's actually something that I'm
recently gonna be coming up to like I'm not popping anything right now because
I'm going to the Netherlands Amsterdam at the beginning of next year so the
person who watches my house is not a plant person like at all so there is no
guarantee anything I have will survive I've only taken one other vacation and
that was to the Netherlands two years ago and I came back and I was like so
that said though there's a lot of things that I'd like to really start to dive
into and start to work so when I get back that was kind of the plan is almost
to do you know again much smaller scale 10 to 15 plants 15 is my limit but just
set up one of the smaller tents and roll with solo cups just plant a couple of
each you know get them short or you know old enough where I can take a clone but
as soon as I'm able to clone it just throw them all into flower so I can kind
of see you know you're not getting the full range of you know how the plants
gonna grow although you can deduce you know nodal spacing the size of the
leaves and just the amount of leaves from that but in my mind that was
probably one of the quicker ways to work through a lot of stuff is doing that
small solo cups just you know old enough to take a clone and then flower it and
be like okay you're a seven you're at eight oh you're a ten you you advance to
the next round so that kind of sounds like what you're doing yeah exactly
you know you can get it what is it like I shoot for one plant per square foot
but with solo cups you can get like four per square foot so and that just gives
you a better chance at hitting the lottery you know what I mean to see what
you got you're not gonna really know what you got until you pop like a
thousand of them you know I mean you don't know what you got really yeah and
you know hopefully one day it's the original goal was to pick up a license
here or in Oregon and get my craft cannabis on but you know it's just not
the right time oh yeah always moving forward always moving forward always
working towards the goal but there's gonna be some more shakeups here in the
fairly near future and I'm not one of those people with a bankroll I can just
afford to lose it the first round and then come back the next round so I've
got a time my entry properly you have a lot of support slowly that's why I'm
sitting here working my lines and trying to make everything perfect that way when
when it's time I can mass-produce and you know be on a bigger platform right
like cuz I mean I don't want to be known for like oh he's got a good you
know OG kush or he's got a good this or that I want you know people to be like
that's the guy who did this you know and that's where longevity in breeding and
making plants goes is the further you do it the longer it takes but the more
original something you can work towards and that again is I think what's gonna
differentiate the craft cannabis because there's enough people who can
grow very freaking good out there so you're gonna have something more than
just very good you know beautiful looking plants I'm super excited about
where the industry's headed when it comes to breeding because there's we've
never had more tools as far as cannabis breeding we've never had more act like
you were saying earlier more access to genetics more access to you know
technology and and not only that but then the legalities of it with within
several states and then we're we're on the turn of you know ending prohibition
altogether and opening up the full legal market so all of these things are really
exciting and the best thing about it for me is that once that opens up the supply
and demand is going to be out of whack ridiculously because if you think about
right now think about when you're trying to find really really fire seeds from
really reputable good breeders like like mean gene from Mendocino for instance
like his beans are hard to find because as soon as the shit comes up it's gone
everybody wants some shit so you know supply and demand the more that's out
there and readily available then you know the less value that it holds so
when you find something that's special like that like a craft grower or craft
breeder who really knows their shit and you can find some good quality stuff
then you know that's that's something that's it's worth holding on to or
reproduce definitely you know there's with with all the breeders out there's
so many choices for consumers there's so many choices for them and as a as a
person new newcomer on the on the market and all that or whatever you got
to kind of figure out how to stand out and make yourself you know stand out
amongst everybody because dude I mean what you got to wonder why does someone
want to grow mine over the that guys you know so you need to stand out some way
definitely and the and you know quality and work will you know build longevity
because that's that should be our goal or you know of a true breeder is is
longevity in the game not here today you know on the main stage at the next you
know cannabis cup and then gone tomorrow right which there's there's a lot of
with any industry there's a lot of people that will do that but that's not
what I think any of us are about I think we've truly connected with the plant we
we know that the mission and the purpose that it can serve and we're out
there for the long haul so I see that I respect that so yeah thank you I see it
too man you're a damn good grower man some of those what is that your your
West scrape or what was it yeah the Westport scrape juice yeah that I saw the
post you put up man that I think looks super nice I appreciate that thank you
it's taken me aback yeah so again I immediately I'm like okay I got to try
multiple runs you know again this wasn't just an overnight process but I got to
try to stress this you know three three ways from Sunday and it's past so I'm
like okay right I can work with you again I don't want to you know for
people who are making medicine and who can only grow a few plants or they have
a small plant count I don't want to be the person that gives them the Herme and
then they don't have medicine for a while they don't have uns you know
sensimilla unseeded plants whatever I take that you know I take that stuff
seriously because it's for a medical patient they're not it's it's not a joke
can't waste their time. Absolutely. Can't waste their time. You can mess up a whole
garden one little a couple a little male flowers early on will screw up a
whole garden. Yep yep. Cool guys. No I just gonna say as long as you don't
breed with a Herme plant then you got a good a good leg up already so. Yep test
you know test them and then once you're happy get them out test them in different
environments and again it's cool seeing your stuff out there so Universal
Elements genetics that contest is gonna be pretty rad too so that's exciting and
again that's the team Urban Grow Tom Green Thumb is the kind of the head
