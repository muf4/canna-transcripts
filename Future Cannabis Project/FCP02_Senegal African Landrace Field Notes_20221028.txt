Howdy! Okay, next field notes. We're in our African sativa section now. So this is
Senegal. This is from Senegal. This is an African landrace and it's
October 23rd. And this one, I would say these are getting very close to harvest
time. We may be harvesting within like five days or so. But I'm really impressed
with the Senegal as a potential production plant because it really
actually has very thick chunky colas. It actually finished October 23rd. It's not a
crazy finish time. And yeah, it's not super late. Nice chunk and the smell. It's
just all different kinds of perfumes and astringent sort of mothball cleaner
smells. I wouldn't say really sweet. Smell that one more time.
Yeah, it's like soft but kind of, yeah, like a cleaner kind of smell with some
perfume in there. And then here's the other one from Senegal. So we'll take a
look at this. This one has very similar, just a little more, maybe slightly more
torpedo spear shape. This one has the more pleasant African sativa sort of
grassy. Actually it very much smells like this. May sound a little weird but if you
cut a parsnip or a carrot but really a parsnip and a fresh astringent parsnip
smell, that is actually very, that's the smell that's coming off of here.
A freshly cut raw parsnip. Anyway, again, this could make a nice production plant
actually. Nice chunky sort of modern looking colas and it's actually
finishing up October 23rd. So I'd say by Halloween we'll be harvesting this. So
very excited to sample. So anyway, Senegal. Cool.
