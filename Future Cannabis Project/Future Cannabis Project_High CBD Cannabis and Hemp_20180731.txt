[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Lo and behold, when the first labs come out, that was Steep Hill was first, then Pure Analytics.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.800]  Pure Analytics comes out, Samantha Mill is a brilliant scientist, so I meet her and she
[00:10.800 --> 00:12.600]  says, hey, I can do predicative work.
[00:12.600 --> 00:16.720]  And I'm like, nice, let's look into predicative work and find out what's going on.
[00:16.720 --> 00:20.200]  We start to take a look at what's taking place with Lawrence's work and what we're doing
[00:20.200 --> 00:25.120]  with the cantonic line, and we start pulling out the outliers that let us breed these lines
[00:25.120 --> 00:27.480]  to get a greater stability.
[00:27.480 --> 00:32.800]  Lawrence ends up passing away from cancer, he gives me his whole collection, I then diffuse
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.680]  it into the cannabis community so that it's in the hands of individuals and I put on all
[00:36.680 --> 00:41.760]  these programs on how to cultivate and then I put them in touch with extractors that had
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.840]  the ability to do medical extraction so that all these patients would be self-sustaining.
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.960]  I wasn't a medical guy prior.
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.980]  I'm a historic black market cultivator, technician, trafficker.
[00:56.100 --> 01:02.140]  I take over a dispensary 11 years ago and I get humanized from the experience because
[01:02.140 --> 01:06.140]  I see real need for medical stuff and I'm like, well, these people are absolutely dying.
[01:06.140 --> 01:08.740]  It tripped me out because I'd never been around people who were dying before.
[01:08.740 --> 01:14.360]  I see people die from gunshots and I see not slow death and I did not know what it looked
[01:14.360 --> 01:17.980]  like and I didn't realize that you could replace so much medicine from cannabis.
[01:17.980 --> 01:20.340]  Thank you.
[01:20.340 --> 01:25.580]  I went on this run, so I'm involved in the foundation of modern CBD and I say, hey, this
[01:25.580 --> 01:26.580]  is going to be awesome.
[01:26.580 --> 01:32.140]  Then, lo and behold, they start to mine Kentucky hemp, Chinese hemp because people say, hey,
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.980]  we can just use this and it works.
[01:33.980 --> 01:39.020]  It does work to a degree, but the efficiency isn't the same and the overall spectrum of
[01:39.020 --> 01:41.460]  benefits isn't the same because you're not receiving.
[01:41.460 --> 01:46.120]  They want to give you CBD alone, but CBD has to have some THC present in order to be optimized
[01:46.120 --> 01:47.120]  for uptake.
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.580]  Yeah, because the way the receptors release and recover it, you get a longer recovery
[01:52.580 --> 01:55.500]  rate, longer cycle grade in the body if we have THC present.
[01:55.500 --> 02:01.060]  What's the, like hemp just has no THC at all in it?
[02:01.060 --> 02:05.620]  Below .3, but it's not that it doesn't have any THC present.
[02:05.620 --> 02:08.940]  It's just that hemp wasn't selected for smoking purposes.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.540]  Oh, sorry.
[02:10.540 --> 02:14.460]  Hemp wasn't selected for smoking purposes, fiber purposes only.
[02:14.460 --> 02:20.100]  What I realized as just this revelation was that none of us smoke land-race cannabis.
[02:20.100 --> 02:23.280]  As much as people think it's land-race, it's not.
[02:23.280 --> 02:29.860]  They took land-race populations and they chose the plants they wanted to use for their patches,
[02:29.860 --> 02:35.340]  propagated it, cultivated it, and then they kept the males they wanted to pollinate the
[02:35.340 --> 02:39.780]  seed for next year into the females they wanted to use for next year.
[02:39.780 --> 02:42.980]  As soon as man touches that shit, it's a cultivated variety.
[02:42.980 --> 02:44.660]  Land-race is naturally occurring.
[02:44.660 --> 02:50.180]  What they could do in Afghanistan, Africa, is they could go Tibet, is they could go into
[02:50.180 --> 02:54.780]  land-race populations and find the outliers that lived through the drought that year,
[02:54.780 --> 02:56.100]  lived through the locust.
[02:56.100 --> 02:59.620]  The ones that lived through the locust, they could then add to the genealogical population.
[02:59.620 --> 03:04.420]  The ones that survived this new pathogenic issue, add it to the genealogical population.
[03:04.420 --> 03:09.880]  So I get the genealogical information present, but fundamentally, that cannabis was used
[03:09.880 --> 03:11.700]  as medicine.
[03:11.700 --> 03:13.760]  It was used in CBD form.
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.120]  If you're equatorial, and just because I got to see so much data, I started going,
[03:19.120 --> 03:20.200]  I got you.
[03:20.200 --> 03:24.720]  Everything that we consider psychoactive on spiritual use, stuff we want to heady weed,
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.360]  that all comes from zero to 20 on the equator.
[03:27.360 --> 03:30.760]  That's where people had incredible lifestyle, where you had plenty of water, you didn't
[03:30.760 --> 03:35.520]  have to worry about freezing to death in the winter, it wasn't over 90 degrees, because
[03:35.520 --> 03:36.880]  it's never that hot on the equator.
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.280]  I used to work on the equator, so it's not that hot, it's just incredible sun intensity.
[03:41.280 --> 03:47.080]  Then you start to get above 20 to 40, and it's in the 30s that we're talking Afghanistan,
[03:47.080 --> 03:52.240]  Pakistan, where you have some of the most savage weather known to mankind, and no water.
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.440]  I started realizing that it breaks down really pretty well, where the easier your life was
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.640]  is where you cultivated spiritual, cerebral cannabis.
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.920]  The more you moved away from the zero, towards the 40, where basically it ended all normal
[04:07.920 --> 04:15.480]  cannabis production, you started having CBD dominant cannabis, or one to one ratio cannabis.
[04:15.480 --> 04:18.600]  Not hardier, better for you to consume.
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.720]  Hardier in a sense that it works in that environment, but not hardier if you bring it down to the
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.280]  equator, because it has to have an ability to work with all stuff we're talking about
[04:28.280 --> 04:31.680]  over the 30, and that range is high desert.
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.280]  Because high desert is considered, and a definition, less than 10 inches of rain a year.
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.080]  I need to have a different type of root system, and I need to have a different type of leaf
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.760]  structure to be a more efficient radiator, and I have to have an ability to control desiccation
[04:46.760 --> 04:52.120]  more, so higher trichome levels, because triches really do help desiccation, the drying out
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.680]  of the flower.
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.280]  Then lo and behold, how do you hold flower in Morocco?
[04:58.280 --> 04:59.280]  You can't.
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.760]  When I started getting into hash making, probably like, let me see, that would have been around
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.800]  say, 99, 2000, I started doing all my water process back then.
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.080]  I had a lady who had lived in Morocco for about four years, and she was showing us what
[05:12.080 --> 05:13.080]  we were doing.
[05:13.080 --> 05:15.760]  She goes, you guys are not letting this shit dry out enough.
[05:15.760 --> 05:17.640]  She said, you have to take it to zero.
[05:17.640 --> 05:22.560]  I started coming up with my own drying systems in pizza boxes, and then I used big commercial
[05:22.560 --> 05:24.480]  coffee grinders to do the micro planing.
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.680]  When me and Brandon hook up from 3rd Gen, he was dying, because I was using coffee grinders
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.920]  to micro plane 15 years ago.
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.320]  What it did was it let me make really high quality bubble, and we had access to truck
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.120]  loads of shake at the time coming out of all the huge massive indoors, so it was a waste
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.120]  product.
[05:41.120 --> 05:46.440]  I had all these massive operations where we would run all the ice water hash through the
[05:46.440 --> 05:49.080]  systems and then run it through the filtration.
[05:49.080 --> 05:52.920]  Then we would dry it in the pizza racks in the house, and then micro it, and then run
[05:52.920 --> 05:56.600]  it through die presses that I had welders whip up for me.
[05:56.600 --> 06:00.800]  Once the material, once they get tired of that varietal, I would just repress it in
[06:00.800 --> 06:01.960]  a new die.
[06:01.960 --> 06:04.920]  I would throw it in a brand new die, repress it again, and it would come out as a brand
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.400]  new product as far as the store was concerned.
[06:06.400 --> 06:08.280]  They'd be like, oh my God, that's a much better product.
[06:08.280 --> 06:09.640]  Same product in another form.
[06:09.640 --> 06:11.560]  It's kind of like the turkey bag phenomenon.
[06:11.560 --> 06:13.520]  You bring it to them in one turkey bag, they don't want it.
[06:13.520 --> 06:16.440]  You go back in the house, bring it back in another turkey bag, they'll take it.
[06:16.440 --> 06:17.440]  They'll take it.
[06:17.440 --> 06:18.440]  Exactly, they'll take it.
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.480]  They don't know the difference.
[06:20.480 --> 06:23.680]  We know that, so we would deliver a really high quality product, but you start to see
[06:23.680 --> 06:25.680]  the nuances of perception.
[06:25.760 --> 06:30.880]  The point was, she was telling me that they have tins, the way they tin up the hash in
[06:30.880 --> 06:36.080]  Morocco where they're holding it for years with no mold, no holdability.
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.960]  I started realizing, I got you.
[06:37.960 --> 06:42.600]  It's because the flour degrades so quickly in these very low humidity environments that
[06:42.600 --> 06:48.040]  they can't hold flour, and that's why hash production was valuable for these individuals.
[06:48.040 --> 06:51.240]  If you were to look at the hash from any of those countries, it would have a way more
[06:51.240 --> 06:52.760]  balanced chemotype.
[06:52.840 --> 06:55.880]  You'd see a much more dominant CBD ratio.
[06:55.880 --> 07:00.920]  Not disproportionate, but more like a one to one or a one to .5.
[07:00.920 --> 07:04.680]  When I started getting all the Pakistani genetics getting shipped in from the Pakistani hash
[07:04.680 --> 07:10.640]  fields, the first thing I did was propped it all up and then sent it to the lab so I
[07:10.640 --> 07:13.360]  could start to take a look at it on Predicative.
[07:13.360 --> 07:15.360]  Then it let me understand what was inside.
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.920]  That's when I started realizing this hypothesis.
[07:17.960 --> 07:23.000]  I started being able to put together a lifetime of doing this and saying, whoa, the data says
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.160]  this which makes sense for what we think, therefore that's what it is.
[07:28.160 --> 07:31.760]  I know that with all these varietals that came through, all the original Afghanis, if
[07:31.760 --> 07:33.800]  you run all those originals, they're like 9%.
[07:33.800 --> 07:36.000]  They got low numbers, man.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.400]  We skewed them, and then unfortunately the storefronts are obsessed with numerics, and
[07:42.400 --> 07:45.880]  it completely screws up the reality of cannabis.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.880]  It screws it up.
[07:46.880 --> 07:49.120]  It seems like it's leveling back out.
[07:49.120 --> 07:50.120]  As the fruits come in.
[07:50.120 --> 07:54.000]  The fruits are coming in because ... But that's terp levels now.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.080]  Now it's skewed terp levels.
[07:56.080 --> 08:02.240]  I have stuff that's 2.6 on a total terp that's ungodly quality that you would say it has
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.480]  five times the terp levels of a 5% because the numbers don't quantify it.
[08:06.480 --> 08:09.920]  It's like saying, I always use, yeah, you're pretty, but you're not a nice person.
[08:09.920 --> 08:13.240]  Yeah, you can add 100 pretty points, and you keep adding pretty points.
[08:13.240 --> 08:14.240]  Keep adding them.
[08:14.240 --> 08:15.240]  Keep adding them.
[08:15.240 --> 08:16.960]  I'm not going to get mad at the fact that you suck to be around, so I'm good.
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.640]  Just get the fuck out of the car.
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.120]  That's how it is to me with cannabis where there's no reality.
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.640]  It's the only way to perceive this stuff in real life is to understand that there's things
[08:27.640 --> 08:31.000]  that you can use in context to understand where we're going wrong with what we're doing
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.880]  now.
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.080]  As the reality comes in, and people become more educated, it'll be a lot easier.
[08:37.080 --> 08:41.160]  That's why when I get to mess around with Abrams where at first they were aggressive
[08:41.160 --> 08:42.720]  when this ... Just like the wine industry.
[08:42.800 --> 08:48.040]  I get all these top wine execs come in, and they attack me on judging weed because they
[08:48.040 --> 08:51.240]  go, we want to take over the industry and how Somali is running.
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.720]  I said, the key difference between you and I, my friend, is that you're judging flavonoids
[08:55.720 --> 08:56.720]  and ethyl alcohol.
[08:56.720 --> 09:04.400]  No matter what alcohol you're playing with, it's the same basic booze, ethyl alcohol.
[09:04.400 --> 09:07.360]  You can put it in your mouth and spit it out.
[09:07.360 --> 09:12.080]  You can't spit out the cannabinoids, and it's in the cannabinoids that the effect is dominated
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.760]  by, so you have to be able to.
[09:13.760 --> 09:17.560]  Eventually it traumatized them because they said, you basically have to be a career weed
[09:17.560 --> 09:19.080]  smoker to be able to do it.
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.680]  I said, yeah, because I got to be able to smoke 40 varieties and tell you that was the
[09:23.680 --> 09:26.160]  one that worked.
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.800]  When I hang out with normal individuals, they're like, you're a drug addict because they watch
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.800]  me smoke so much.
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.400]  I'm like, no, I'm not a drug addict.
[09:33.400 --> 09:39.320]  It's just that I can function normally on high levels of intoxication, and I can discern
[09:39.560 --> 09:42.920]  This was the one that worked, and if you put them all back in the cookie jar, I'll still
[09:42.920 --> 09:47.720]  pull the same one out over and over again because that's what we do for a living.
[09:47.720 --> 09:48.720]  It's not me.
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.720]  It's other people like me.
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.600]  If you're a career, you're a career.
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.160]  The wine guys finally were like, all right, all right.
[09:54.160 --> 09:57.640]  Then we had a better relationship because they weren't being so adversarial because they're
[09:57.640 --> 09:58.640]  very intelligent.
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.360]  Most of them are PhD scientists and viticulturalists and sommelier, and so to them, they're like
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.520]  the top of the food chain in how things are perceived.
[10:07.520 --> 10:10.160]  I can smoke with them some reefer, and they're on their hands and knees begging for me to
[10:10.160 --> 10:13.160]  take them home so I can put them into a cot.
[10:13.160 --> 10:16.840]  I'm just like, you ain't judging anything, buddy.
[10:16.840 --> 10:22.440]  We know that to be true, and you need to be able to say, hey, these are the things that
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.480]  happen in the public is the same way.
[10:25.480 --> 10:30.280]  When I get academics to come in, each individual that comes into cannabis wants to disprove
[10:30.280 --> 10:31.880]  what you do.
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.480]  Because you're not one of their peers, you must not be as sharp.
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.880]  Therefore, a lifetime of doing this at every level humanly possible doesn't mean anything.
[10:42.880 --> 10:45.160]  We know this from this.
[10:45.160 --> 10:50.600]  What they find out is that they're mistaken, and then you end up building a relationship
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.560]  so now you can actually share.
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.080]  Because I don't pretend to be a scientist.
[10:54.080 --> 10:55.080]  I'm not.
[10:55.080 --> 10:59.760]  I am fascinated with science, and I use scientists, but I'm a field operator.
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.840]  That's what I'm about.
[11:00.840 --> 11:06.480]  I'm about getting product to the table, and I'm about helping farmers get product to the
[11:06.480 --> 11:07.000]  table.
