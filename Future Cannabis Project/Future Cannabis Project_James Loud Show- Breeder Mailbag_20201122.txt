[00:01.470 --> 00:07.830]  Welcome, boys and girls. We are live. Thanks for joining us for episode eight of the James
[00:07.830 --> 00:14.830]  Loud Show. This is kind of the, I view this as like the housekeeping show. This is the
[00:14.830 --> 00:22.070]  mailbag episode, right? So we're going to answer some audience questions. So good morning.
[00:22.070 --> 00:28.350]  Hey, good morning, everybody. Welcome to week eight of the James Loud Show. Thanks for tuning
[00:28.910 --> 00:33.310]  So yeah, we don't have a special guest. I'm the special guest this week, I guess.
[00:33.310 --> 00:34.830]  And I guess I'm the one asking questions.
[00:34.830 --> 00:39.150]  Yeah, Peter's going to ask some questions. We got some stuff. I had some breeding tips.
[00:39.150 --> 00:44.190]  We had some people that were going to be on the show that kept delaying, confirming, and
[00:44.190 --> 00:49.790]  then last minute they canceled. So I figured this was a good time to get them.
[00:49.790 --> 00:53.350]  Now you're getting a taste of what I go through like five times a week.
[00:53.670 --> 00:59.590]  Oh, I bet. I bet. I bet. Yeah, there's a lot of flaky people in the cannabis industry.
[00:59.590 --> 01:05.030]  He's getting potheads. There's a mix of both. But yeah, I mean, there's a saying,
[01:05.830 --> 01:12.870]  under promise over deliver. And I try to live by that. You can't always do it. And planning
[01:12.870 --> 01:17.990]  is something that comes in. We all have great expectations.
[01:18.950 --> 01:23.190]  Marshall, you're good enough. You're smart enough and doggone it, people like you.
[01:24.550 --> 01:29.750]  Yeah. So let's start off with some tips. If you guys have questions, ask away. But I had a list of
[01:30.710 --> 01:34.390]  quick breeding tips that'll help you become a better breeder potentially,
[01:35.910 --> 01:42.630]  or at least put you on the right path with stuff. So I think the first and most important thing with
[01:42.630 --> 01:49.030]  breeding is becoming a good grower. I think you need to learn how to grow for a lot of reasons.
[01:49.030 --> 01:54.870]  But as far as expression of the plant, if you're not growing that plant optimally, then you're not
[01:54.870 --> 02:00.470]  going to be producing stuff that's discernible as far as terpene profile, structure. You're not
[02:00.470 --> 02:06.070]  growing in that ideal situation. So really learn how to grow before you start breeding. A lot of
[02:06.070 --> 02:10.070]  people just want instant gratification. They want to do it right now. It's a trendy thing to do.
[02:10.630 --> 02:16.790]  The best breeders are really good growers. All my friends that are amazing breeders are good growers.
[02:16.790 --> 02:22.870]  They're not all smokers, but most of them have smoked in their life. So be passion driven.
[02:22.870 --> 02:26.230]  And that applies to everything in life. Be passion driven, whatever you do.
[02:27.190 --> 02:33.590]  Be passionate about it. Follow through. Under promise, over deliver. Those things will take
[02:33.590 --> 02:41.670]  you far in life. Another thing, so the next tip I have is besides smoking a lot, I think in smoking
[02:41.670 --> 02:49.590]  your product, one thing you can do to find interesting phenotypes and blends is actually
[02:49.590 --> 02:59.030]  taking two varieties. You grab a jar of this, a jar of... Here's some lava cake. So this is lava
[02:59.030 --> 03:02.950]  cake. This is Pamelina. You want to cross these together. If you're a grower, that means you're
[03:03.270 --> 03:07.670]  growing this stuff. You want to breed them together. You can make feminized seeds by reversing one of
[03:07.670 --> 03:14.710]  them or reversing both of them and trying to flip flop. I think that what you do is you smoke a 50-50.
[03:14.710 --> 03:19.110]  Then you smoke one that's leaning towards one of the parents and one towards the other. And you're
[03:19.110 --> 03:23.430]  going to get an idea of the terpene combinations that are possible. This isn't something that
[03:24.070 --> 03:28.550]  is guaranteed. It's not something that you'll always see in the progeny, but it's something
[03:28.550 --> 03:35.510]  that will give you an idea of compatibility. So I'm big on compatibility, plant compatibility,
[03:35.510 --> 03:41.590]  and breeding with intention. I think there's some people that just breed to breed and they put this
[03:41.590 --> 03:48.950]  on that and they get results. You're going to get results regardless, but it's like, what kind of
[03:48.950 --> 03:52.710]  results are you looking for? Are you breeding with intention to get a specific result or are you
[03:52.710 --> 03:58.550]  breeding for that mystery? We're finding stuff. Yeah, and it's all of a sudden, whoa, that's
[03:58.550 --> 04:07.030]  amazing. And you will find stuff doing that as well. So plant compatibility, I think I talked
[04:07.030 --> 04:13.190]  about growing before you breed and that'll take you a long ways. I mean, just learning the plant,
[04:13.190 --> 04:17.670]  it takes years to really... Some people get it right off the bat. They understand growing and
[04:17.670 --> 04:22.230]  they have a green thumb and then there's other people. I don't necessarily believe in the brown
[04:22.230 --> 04:27.910]  thumb. People talk about the brown thumb and the fact that they can't grow. I think growing is a
[04:27.910 --> 04:33.430]  skill that can be learned by anybody. I feel like my brother had a green thumb right off the
[04:33.430 --> 04:39.350]  bat when we were kids. Whatever he did, he's successful at growing. And it took me years
[04:40.310 --> 04:43.270]  to understand the plant and to get good results. I've failed a lot.
[04:44.230 --> 04:50.150]  Failure is a good thing. I think a lot of people think negatively about failure, but as far as
[04:50.710 --> 04:55.430]  don't make the same mistake again, learn from your mistakes, but failure can be your best friend.
[04:55.430 --> 05:01.990]  Do you remember any specific moments when it clicked? Your brother, he was like,
[05:04.070 --> 05:10.070]  Larry Bird worked really hard to become a good basketball player. Some people have natural talent.
[05:11.350 --> 05:16.870]  Yeah, and my brother, he could have been the Michael Jordan of growing and probably breeding
[05:16.870 --> 05:21.190]  too. My brother has a really good palate, but he chose a different path in life.
[05:22.390 --> 05:27.190]  And me, I really feel like I've had to work for it. I've grown shitty bud, but I've always
[05:27.190 --> 05:33.350]  smoked really high quality stuff. So don't set your expectations low of yourself. Constantly
[05:33.350 --> 05:40.230]  strive to be better. As far as when I was younger, I would say in my 20s, it really clicked
[05:40.950 --> 05:48.150]  when I got over a pound of light one time. Because we were getting like, I was using 600s.
[05:48.150 --> 05:52.550]  And so that's a little bit different ratio if you're thinking of converting 1000 watts. But
[05:52.550 --> 05:58.950]  the first time I got over a pound with a 600 watt light was like, oh man, I know what I'm doing.
[06:00.150 --> 06:06.230]  But also I've always smoked. I've grown to smoke for myself. So I think that's another one is like,
[06:06.230 --> 06:09.990]  make sure you're smoking your product. If you're growing and you're really passionate about it,
[06:09.990 --> 06:15.590]  you should be smoking your product at the end of the day. And you should be trying to grow a
[06:15.590 --> 06:19.430]  product that you would want to smoke that's good. And I think no person in their right mind would
[06:19.430 --> 06:24.710]  be using pesticides and all this other garbage on it if they're smoking it themselves. So I had an
[06:24.710 --> 06:31.990]  aunt with AIDS, full blown AIDS, and she was a very big proponent in the 90s of organic cannabis.
[06:31.990 --> 06:37.510]  Before we were talking about organics, she was telling me organics, not spraying stuff,
[06:38.150 --> 06:45.110]  keeping it as natural as possible. And she was using organic inputs inside for her stuff with
[06:45.110 --> 06:50.390]  soil. I mean, you wouldn't necessarily call it organic, but it's organic inputs. She's not using
[06:50.390 --> 06:59.830]  salt. Which seems kind of, I mean, obviously now lots of people are growing in soil, indoors and
[06:59.830 --> 07:05.430]  tents, but it seems like back then that was probably like the peak of indoor hydro, like
[07:06.150 --> 07:11.270]  89% of all indoor grows would be hydro. Everybody used three part. Yeah. I mean,
[07:11.270 --> 07:15.350]  not everybody, but we had like dark energy, which was organic and we had some other organic
[07:16.550 --> 07:21.590]  additives and stuff like that. But a lot of us were using three part in the early 90s,
[07:21.590 --> 07:27.750]  especially. And then some brands started coming out and early 2000s, there was this
[07:27.750 --> 07:34.150]  influx of all kinds of nutrients and amazing things. But it's something that you learn how
[07:34.150 --> 07:39.990]  to do over time and you just build on it. It's like, as long as you're improving and getting
[07:39.990 --> 07:46.230]  better, I mean, I still feel like I have so much to learn. I would say I'm a great cultivator
[07:46.230 --> 07:51.030]  on one level, but it's like new technology comes out all the time. So we're really learning
[07:51.910 --> 07:57.430]  about the plant and optimization. It's like, we're talking about stuff today that we weren't
[07:57.430 --> 08:03.990]  even talking about 10 years ago. So many things. I mean, LED lights have made a huge jump as far
[08:04.070 --> 08:09.990]  as quality. I thought they were garbage, but even genetics. I mean, I think we've made progress
[08:11.110 --> 08:15.110]  on some level, we've made progress with genetics. And on another, I think we've taken away from the
[08:15.110 --> 08:21.590]  cannabis gene pool by diluting it in some way. So I think that there's a lot of people that talk
[08:21.590 --> 08:25.750]  about how good the weed was in the 90s. And then there's other people that are saying, oh man,
[08:25.750 --> 08:30.470]  it's nothing like it is today. But that's not true. The stuff was tasty and maybe it didn't
[08:30.470 --> 08:36.070]  have as high of THC, but as far as quality, I mean, I think there was a lot less growers back
[08:36.070 --> 08:42.390]  then. So now we have so many growers and there is good and there's a lot of shit. 90% of it's
[08:42.390 --> 08:47.350]  garbage in my opinion, it's on the market. But back then there were more passionate growers.
[08:47.350 --> 08:53.430]  It was also illegal. So with that whole illegal side of it, people that were doing it were taking
[08:53.430 --> 09:01.430]  high risks. But we also use weird shit. I mean, I think we use Avid and stuff and didn't even
[09:01.430 --> 09:06.070]  think about it back then. I tried to stay away from it. Definitely all my friends dipped their
[09:06.070 --> 09:10.550]  clothes in Avid. That was just the thing that you did. And that's the thing that you do not do now,
[09:10.550 --> 09:18.870]  typically. So, but yeah, I mean, it's interesting cannabis over the last 30 years
[09:18.870 --> 09:25.110]  and how it's really kind of changed and evolved. And the younger generation didn't understand,
[09:25.110 --> 09:30.070]  I think, not saying like I'm an old man that understands everything, but the younger generation
[09:30.070 --> 09:34.950]  doesn't understand for the most part, all the struggles that we went through. And I mean, even
[09:35.670 --> 09:42.230]  quality of stuff, you see some of these strains. Let's go to number one. Romulan is the great one.
[09:42.230 --> 09:47.670]  So there's, in fact, the last couple of years I've been talking to the son of the guy who
[09:47.670 --> 09:53.510]  created the Romulan and stuff like that. That's close to these, these genetics are a lot more
[09:53.510 --> 09:58.550]  stable than the stuff today. The stuff, perms, we have issues. And those are things that,
[09:58.550 --> 10:02.870]  I feel like that have been taken away from the gene pool, the quality, especially the
[10:02.870 --> 10:08.230]  hermaphrodite stuff. It's like that can be bred in or it can be bred out. If you're conscious about
[10:08.230 --> 10:12.150]  it, you're going to create something better quality that has less intersexual traits,
[10:12.870 --> 10:15.030]  you know, that requires somebody breeding with intent.
[10:17.510 --> 10:23.190]  So let's see, what kind of other tips do we have to go in there? Or you got a couple questions
[10:23.190 --> 10:30.470]  for me, Peter? I mean, I have a million questions, but I'm trying to hold back on my habit of
[10:30.470 --> 10:36.870]  jumping in and asking questions that bring it in a totally different direction. So you're,
[10:36.870 --> 10:41.110]  you had 23 breeding tips. So have we, have we covered them all?
[10:41.110 --> 10:47.510]  Not at all. We're like three. So, you know, and I think there was some questions that kind of tie
[10:47.510 --> 10:53.590]  into the, the tips that I have as well. You know, and I feel like starting small is the best way.
[10:54.710 --> 11:00.070]  You know, if you're starting with a tent, you know, reversing plants or, you know,
[11:00.070 --> 11:04.710]  selecting males, you know, there's so many things that you can do with selecting males. I feel like
[11:04.710 --> 11:09.350]  the stem rub is what a lot of people use. And the stem rub is good. I go, I like a greasy stem
[11:09.350 --> 11:14.230]  on the males, but I'm looking for specific things. If I'm trying to select a male,
[11:15.190 --> 11:18.950]  and sometimes I select three males, sometimes I select five males for different traits.
[11:18.950 --> 11:23.430]  But what I do, I mean, I like three because then you can have, of a cross, you can have something
[11:23.430 --> 11:28.070]  that's in the middle of something that leans towards one of the parents and something that
[11:28.070 --> 11:31.590]  leans towards the other parent, whether it's structure. You know, there's, there's traits
[11:31.590 --> 11:37.190]  that you look for, like structure and with a male, you know, just for structure, what you're
[11:37.190 --> 11:41.590]  looking for typically is not something that's short and squatty. It's the same as the female.
[11:41.590 --> 11:47.990]  I just think of like how men and women, men are a little bit taller than women. I think they've
[11:47.990 --> 11:54.470]  said that the optimal male is six inches taller than a female as far as humans are concerned,
[11:54.470 --> 12:01.510]  like when they're talking about pairings and genetics. So I feel like plants, you want
[12:01.510 --> 12:05.830]  something similar to that, you know, that's what I'm looking for if I'm if I'm inbreeding, right?
[12:05.830 --> 12:10.710]  So that's with regular seeds. With females, obviously, you know what the what it's going
[12:10.710 --> 12:16.470]  to contribute in the sense that you have two females going on each other, that pollen from
[12:16.470 --> 12:23.110]  one. So each parent, though, whether it's the donor or receiver, can pass on different traits.
[12:23.590 --> 12:31.110]  So terpene profile is more dominant with the male, but it's you can still still get terpene
[12:31.110 --> 12:40.230]  profile passed on through the receiver. So as far as flowering time, flowering time is passed on
[12:40.230 --> 12:48.870]  through the male. So if you have something that's really long, like a long, long flowering variety,
[12:49.590 --> 12:54.630]  any of those cultivars that are like 14 weeks, you would want to take that and you would want to put
[12:55.510 --> 13:00.550]  a donor on that that has a shorter flowering time, that'll reduce your flowering time.
[13:01.430 --> 13:05.830]  And that's that's a you know, that's something that I've I've seen work great with something
[13:05.830 --> 13:11.430]  like sour diesel, blue dream, you want to shorten the flowering time but take something like
[13:12.070 --> 13:16.310]  blue dream and sour diesel are very different in the sense that blue dream is super stable.
[13:16.870 --> 13:22.870]  I feel like, you know, blue dream gets a bad rap because it doesn't get people that high. But in
[13:22.870 --> 13:28.390]  its day, it was it was an amazing cultivar. And I still think it has a lot of breeding potential
[13:28.390 --> 13:34.790]  because of the stability of the plant. I don't think blue dream can really be improved upon
[13:35.430 --> 13:41.030]  for itself. I mean, you can breed it into other things. We have a dementia, which is amnesia
[13:41.030 --> 13:47.590]  times blue dream. And that is a unique in its own way. But blue dream is so stable, it's actually
[13:47.590 --> 13:54.470]  really hard to reverse where sour diesel has intersexual traits. It was a chem dog bag seed,
[13:54.470 --> 14:00.070]  actually, from the chem 91. And it grows very similar to that. But it does have intersexual
[14:00.070 --> 14:05.430]  traits. But it also has a lot of traits that I absolutely love. So it has the terpene profile
[14:05.430 --> 14:10.390]  that I love, you know, and there's the fox tailing and airiness of it, I don't necessarily like,
[14:11.030 --> 14:15.670]  but the yield, you get a high yield similar to what you get with blue dream. And you get an
[14:15.670 --> 14:20.630]  amazing terpene profile. It's something that me personally, I've been smoking for the last 20
[14:20.630 --> 14:26.630]  years over 20 years now, and I still I still can't get enough of it. I still get it. I grow outdoor
[14:26.630 --> 14:31.190]  of it, or I have my friends to grow outdoor and I get some off of them. But I really enjoy the
[14:31.190 --> 14:39.830]  effect of it. So let's see. Next one optimal plant health. This goes back to being a good grower
[14:39.830 --> 14:46.470]  again with breeding. I think as a tip, you want your plants as healthy as possible always. And
[14:46.470 --> 14:50.310]  the other reason you want your plants as healthy as possible is because typically, if you're making
[14:50.310 --> 14:55.910]  seeds, you need to go longer than your typical flowering time. So if you have a 70 day variety,
[14:56.550 --> 14:59.910]  you're going to need to take that 70 day variety and you're going to need to go an additional
[15:00.710 --> 15:06.070]  20 to 30 days, sometimes even a little bit longer. And what you're looking for is the plant to
[15:06.150 --> 15:11.110]  actually naturally go yellow on its own. And I and that's with giving it additional nitrogen at the
[15:11.110 --> 15:19.110]  end. And so I'm a big fan and proponent proponent of using nitrogen fish. You know, there's a
[15:19.110 --> 15:23.430]  product called alpha fish by Greenstone. I think I got the Greenstone shirt on right here. They
[15:23.430 --> 15:28.950]  have a product, it's a powder product called alpha fish, and you can find it online. And it's stinky.
[15:28.950 --> 15:33.750]  And you know, if you have friends and family that live in the grow that you may not want to use it
[15:33.750 --> 15:39.190]  indoors. If you're living in the property, if it's a warehouse and you're, you know, working
[15:39.190 --> 15:43.750]  for a big company, it's no problem, but it's some sneaky stuff. But what it does is products like
[15:43.750 --> 15:48.870]  that as they keep it green into flower, and then even towards the end where you'd normally be
[15:48.870 --> 15:53.590]  harvesting, you can keep that plant green for an additional amount of time and then the plant will
[15:53.590 --> 16:00.790]  naturally finish on its own and those seeds will yield higher amounts by going that additional 30
[16:00.790 --> 16:07.590]  days. So yeah, that goes let them go long. That's my next tip, which is let them go long,
[16:07.590 --> 16:14.870]  keep them going until you see that green going yellow. I think that's super important as far as
[16:14.870 --> 16:20.470]  if you're concerned with yield. You know, some people you can do the scratch test, you can scratch
[16:20.470 --> 16:26.070]  the shell casing off of the seed and if the seed brown, you know, that's another way to tell.
[16:26.870 --> 16:37.190]  But I prefer going with the yellow. So tip number 11. Don't sell untested seeds.
[16:39.750 --> 16:45.190]  Yeah, I think that's a super, super, super good tip. And I think it's something that I've learned
[16:46.070 --> 16:48.950]  from my mistakes. You know, there's companies, there's some of the biggest
[16:49.590 --> 16:52.790]  companies, I'm not going to mention any names, but they're no longer seed companies,
[16:53.510 --> 16:57.270]  because they sold untested seeds and they didn't have a germination rate. I mean,
[16:57.270 --> 17:03.110]  the germination rate was so low, it was almost zero. So, and I've learned from my mistakes,
[17:03.110 --> 17:09.510]  selling untested seeds in the beginning that, you know, part of my friends, we had some seeds and we
[17:09.510 --> 17:15.430]  decided to sell them. Well, it wasn't that they had low germination rates, it was that it was shit,
[17:15.430 --> 17:21.350]  it was garbage. There was hermaphrodite issues, intersexual traits that weren't good.
[17:23.590 --> 17:26.550]  So those are like the mistakes, you know, you can make the mistakes like me, I think
[17:27.270 --> 17:31.670]  we got a bad rap a little bit for it. This was 10 years ago, but you learn from your mistakes.
[17:32.310 --> 17:36.790]  I'll never sell stuff if untested again. And you know, it's like, I work with groups and I
[17:36.790 --> 17:43.190]  collaborate. And that's always the thing is testing seeds and testing seeds is so important because
[17:43.190 --> 17:47.990]  that's where the real breeding happens. I think people think of breeding as putting the pollen on
[17:48.550 --> 17:52.790]  the receiver and that's breeding. Well, real breeding is actually doing the phenol.
[17:53.350 --> 17:59.030]  You're doing the selection process. And sometimes that's overlooked by a lot of people coming into
[17:59.030 --> 18:03.590]  the industry wanting to be breeders to make a quick buck, but really, you know, and of course,
[18:03.590 --> 18:06.950]  that goes back again to being a good grower because then you can do better selections.
[18:07.910 --> 18:19.030]  So tip number 12, test, test, test. Yeah, test your seeds. It's important to test everything,
[18:20.230 --> 18:28.070]  you know, and also run it multiple times. So I think that if you grow it from seed and you're
[18:28.070 --> 18:32.470]  basically going to sell seeds for somebody that's going to populate a huge field and just grow those
[18:32.470 --> 18:37.430]  plants out of seed, you just need to grow one out and test it. But if you're trying to sell stuff
[18:37.430 --> 18:42.070]  that people are going to collect, you know, and what I was referring to is like auto flowers.
[18:42.070 --> 18:46.550]  So auto flowers, you can't keep a clone alive. So you have to grow it out and whatever you get is
[18:46.550 --> 18:51.990]  what you get. But now with photo period, what you need to do is you need to grow it out a few times.
[18:51.990 --> 18:56.070]  So even though you've had your selections, you might get rid of shit that's harvested, right?
[18:56.070 --> 19:00.630]  So let's say you pop 100 seeds, you create this amazing strain that you think is going to be great
[19:01.270 --> 19:06.070]  and pop 100 seeds. Now with those 100 seeds, you're going to, if it's feminized, then you have
[19:06.070 --> 19:12.230]  100 to pick from. If it's regular, you got roughly 50, maybe more, maybe less. But what you need to
[19:12.230 --> 19:17.990]  do is you test those out and you look for outliers. You look for ones that are amazing. And then you
[19:17.990 --> 19:23.430]  basically pull, you get rid of all the garbage. Now you're going to find a bunch of garbage.
[19:23.430 --> 19:29.350]  And I like using that 100, you know, 100 to 500 is a good number to start with. If you can afford
[19:29.350 --> 19:35.670]  it, if you have the space, I think larger progenies are better, obviously, because then you
[19:35.670 --> 19:42.390]  have more to pick from. But it requires a lot more work, but you're selecting that 1%. So, you know,
[19:42.390 --> 19:49.670]  with 100, I might keep 10, I might keep five, I might keep just a few that are amazing. But you
[19:49.670 --> 19:54.070]  know, you probably would want to keep at least five. Then you take those five and you grow them
[19:54.070 --> 19:58.470]  out a second time from clone. Now the expressions you get off a clone is going to be different.
[19:59.430 --> 20:02.790]  Then it's slightly different. You know, there's different branching, but you can also get
[20:02.790 --> 20:08.790]  different chirping profiles and almost different structure coming off that clone. And I use the
[20:08.790 --> 20:14.230]  Pluto as an example, sticky farms. Good guys. I love these guys. Well, the bar is amazing,
[20:14.230 --> 20:19.830]  but they figure out three or four times before they actually selected one winner. It was amazing.
[20:19.830 --> 20:24.870]  And there's nothing wrong with that. I think that's the best way is to put time and effort
[20:24.870 --> 20:30.070]  into it. Simon from Serious Seeds, some of you guys may know him or have heard of him. He created
[20:30.070 --> 20:37.270]  the AK47, the Calumet's. It took him five years to create stable lines of seed. Yeah. And amazing
[20:37.270 --> 20:47.110]  genetic. He, in my opinion, is a true leader. So let's see. So I'm testing seeds. Yeah, we got that.
[20:47.270 --> 20:54.470]  Transparency of lineage is also important. I think this is one of the biggest ones. And
[20:54.470 --> 20:58.550]  there's a lot of confusion because you can go buy a clone from somebody or you can get seeds
[20:58.550 --> 21:03.190]  from somebody and they say it is what it is, but you don't really know unless you're going to the
[21:03.190 --> 21:08.710]  source, the person that created it. And I mean, I think it's important also that you have the
[21:08.710 --> 21:15.510]  right phenotype because if you have a great example is like JVZ, which is a great example
[21:16.230 --> 21:22.230]  of like JVZ's wedding cake. So JVZ has a variety of wedding cake that you guys have heard of,
[21:22.230 --> 21:27.590]  I'm sure. He sold seeds in it. Well, that's something that there's probably 30 plus phenotypes
[21:27.590 --> 21:33.190]  out there that I've seen over the last whatever, but the real, his real cut, and there's a couple
[21:33.190 --> 21:38.310]  other ones that are absolutely amazing. Those are the winners. Those are the outliers that people
[21:38.310 --> 21:43.990]  have selected. And then there's a lot of ones that I feel like are inferior and it's not like
[21:43.990 --> 21:48.950]  a bad thing. This is what happens with everybody's stuff. But just because you have a cut of
[21:48.950 --> 21:54.310]  something doesn't mean it's the real one. And so that's, and that's kind of what makes really good
[21:54.310 --> 21:59.990]  seed companies amazing and other seed companies not so good. And that's how you can increase the
[21:59.990 --> 22:04.870]  quality of your gene pool that you're creating, or you can take away from it. But you know, it's
[22:04.870 --> 22:10.550]  like if you were to buy a wedding cake and just, just randomly picking anything, or if you open
[22:10.550 --> 22:15.830]  pollinate, let's say you open pollinated any variety, you know, that open pollination is good
[22:15.830 --> 22:21.510]  for doing a seed raise, but it's not necessarily good for improving the quality of your gene pool.
[22:23.510 --> 22:35.510]  So number 14, second run, third run, fourth run, be passionate. So unless you're planning
[22:35.510 --> 22:38.470]  on selling a seed crop, we were kind of talking about that early, like with autos,
[22:39.110 --> 22:46.150]  you know, test, test, test, get the next ones, get feedback from your friends, get feedback from
[22:46.150 --> 22:52.470]  other people. Give your smoke out, ask people what they think of it. You know, I think it's so
[22:52.470 --> 22:57.590]  cannabis is so subjective. You know, it's I think cannabis is one of the most just like food,
[22:57.590 --> 23:02.870]  cannabis is subjective. So what I like maybe isn't what the next guy likes. I have a background as a
[23:02.870 --> 23:09.030]  chef. So I'm used to cooking for other people. So I am constantly thinking what would most people
[23:09.030 --> 23:12.950]  like, it's not always about what I like, because if it was what I like, I'd be reading just cat
[23:12.950 --> 23:17.350]  piss, and sour diesel and a couple other things. Probably, you know, I mean, there's a lot of good
[23:17.350 --> 23:22.310]  stuff. And I'm always trying to find that new new, but I'm constantly trying to evaluate the
[23:22.310 --> 23:26.790]  direction the market's going in and what people like. So it's not about just breeding for me. I
[23:26.790 --> 23:31.110]  mean, you can make it about just whatever you like, and that's fine. But I feel like, you know,
[23:31.110 --> 23:34.870]  because it's so subjective, you should constantly be trying to get feedback from other people.
[23:36.230 --> 23:40.710]  Especially if you're going to make seeds, you know, for sale for sale to other people, you know,
[23:40.710 --> 23:46.150]  you know, I think there's a lot of value in getting feedback. So
[23:47.750 --> 23:53.590]  and actually, just quickly on that point, kind of who's your goat who's in the inner James Loud
[23:53.590 --> 24:00.710]  circle of people you regularly kind of hand stuff out to and get feedback from and can you give some
[24:00.710 --> 24:04.630]  examples of some of the feedback they gave you based on their like various power?
[24:04.630 --> 24:09.990]  Sure, you know, I mean, with all our all my friends, we're always constantly sharing everything new,
[24:09.990 --> 24:15.430]  because it's just one of those things that I grew up that same way. We always share,
[24:15.430 --> 24:21.430]  share our flower, share our seeds, get feedback on stuff. But some of the stuff is like, you know,
[24:21.430 --> 24:27.270]  it's just another gelato, you know, so I think that's, that's the most common one lately. Oh,
[24:27.270 --> 24:33.270]  you got another gelato. Great. That's like, but, you know, I think my one of my good friends made
[24:33.270 --> 24:39.110]  a point the other day, it's like, when chem dog came on, you know, chem dog, sourdough,
[24:39.110 --> 24:43.510]  so OG, how long were those things on top, those those three varieties, you know, we're not talking
[24:43.510 --> 24:48.230]  about all the other stuff that was available at that time, just those three varieties were on top.
[24:48.230 --> 24:52.630]  And if you think of the next latest and greatest after those three that kind of dominated the
[24:52.630 --> 24:59.590]  market, I would say that it would be Girl Scout cookies in like 2009 2010, it started popping up,
[24:59.590 --> 25:05.990]  and then the gelato hit. Now, who knows how long it's going to be? Do we need another gelato? I
[25:05.990 --> 25:11.110]  don't know. Do you want the thing is, is like, reading another gelato, that's an interesting
[25:11.110 --> 25:15.030]  thing if you're breeding one, so you have your own version of it, is it going to be genetically
[25:15.030 --> 25:20.950]  different? I doubt it. It'll be a slight variation, you know, and that's okay. There's nothing wrong
[25:20.950 --> 25:26.230]  with that. And gelatos are good. And that's what's trending out. Purple weeds back. I don't know how
[25:26.230 --> 25:31.990]  that happened. But the purple weed is a, you know, in full effect, people are excited, people are
[25:31.990 --> 25:36.470]  excited about the trend of the purple weed. You got to have color, you got to have smell, you got
[25:36.470 --> 25:42.070]  to have gas, as far as like that you got, it's got to be loud. It's got to have gas, it's got to have
[25:42.070 --> 25:46.230]  some sort of floral, you know, all this stuff that's coming out right now is very similar,
[25:46.230 --> 25:50.710]  who knows how long it's gonna stay popular. That was my point. It's really hard to say.
[25:53.590 --> 25:57.270]  So what were we talking about again, Peter? I lost track.
[25:57.910 --> 26:02.790]  I think we were on 15. Well, yeah, it was basically share it with your friends,
[26:02.790 --> 26:08.630]  get their feedback. And then, yeah, and so, yeah, exactly. Get their feedback. I mean,
[26:08.630 --> 26:12.070]  you should be asking your friends. What do you think about this? What's your opinion?
[26:12.710 --> 26:17.910]  You know, do you like the taste of it? You know, what could I add to it? What could I do to make
[26:17.910 --> 26:22.150]  it better? You know, constantly talking about stuff, you're constantly educating yourself anyway.
[26:22.790 --> 26:27.910]  So asking questions, asking the internet, looking on Instagram and all that stuff is great. But
[26:27.910 --> 26:32.790]  really getting down, you know, if you have a circle of people that have access to the good
[26:32.790 --> 26:38.790]  stuff is like constantly talking about it. And pretty much, I know all our wives and girlfriends
[26:38.870 --> 26:43.110]  and significant others are probably sick of us talking about cannabis all the time, because I
[26:43.110 --> 26:47.110]  feel like that's something that I've been doing for my whole life. So we get all excited and we
[26:47.110 --> 26:51.510]  just talk about it for hours and hours and hours. I had a dinner party with a couple friends last
[26:51.510 --> 26:58.150]  night. And it's like, these friends aren't into the breeding stuff. But it's like, they love
[26:58.150 --> 27:03.670]  talking about weed and food. You know, and I met these guys when I was a chef. They're both smokers.
[27:03.670 --> 27:07.990]  So we talked a little bit about it. But I get together with some of my weed friends. And it's
[27:07.990 --> 27:12.070]  like, we can't quit talking about weed. We'll talk about it for eight or 10 hours. And it's
[27:12.070 --> 27:18.790]  just because it excites us. And I think that's important to get that level of passion going with
[27:18.790 --> 27:27.430]  whatever you do. So we are that was good feedback. Yeah, this this one is your definition of exotic.
[27:27.430 --> 27:33.270]  The James Loud definition. The definition of exotic cannabis. I think this is important.
[27:33.270 --> 27:41.190]  It's a trendy and rare. So exotic, typically, like the exotic market now is whatever's trending
[27:41.190 --> 27:47.990]  in rare and that has a lot to do with social media. So exotic cannabis is, is basically from
[27:47.990 --> 27:53.110]  Instagram and from the following and from that's where that's where it's all set. Now that stuff is
[27:54.070 --> 28:00.150]  it's interesting. So in the sense that what's popular today, three weeks from now may not be the
[28:00.710 --> 28:05.350]  popular exotic, it could still be considered exotic. It's if it's rare and high demand.
[28:05.910 --> 28:11.270]  And all those exotics are going for top dollar. You know, you can fetch a premium for exotics.
[28:11.830 --> 28:16.150]  But again, there's this big rename game going on. I don't know if you guys are all aware.
[28:17.110 --> 28:21.430]  But everybody's renaming stuff, especially so I'm in California. So in the metric market,
[28:22.710 --> 28:28.630]  you know, everybody's renaming stuff and repackaging stuff is their own. I see three or
[28:28.630 --> 28:33.190]  four versions of the same genetics called different things. And that's pretty common.
[28:34.230 --> 28:38.310]  Can you give an example of something specific and all the various names of it?
[28:39.830 --> 28:42.150]  No, because I don't want to really throw anybody under the bus.
[28:43.110 --> 28:48.390]  And then then then then how about without saying what people renamed it just an example of a
[28:48.390 --> 28:55.110]  cultivar that has been renamed many times. 33 has been renamed 50 different things in the
[28:55.110 --> 28:59.830]  California rec market and probably hundreds of different things in the traditional market.
[29:00.390 --> 29:04.390]  But, you know, and that's just gelato 33 is so many different things. And it's like, that's a
[29:04.390 --> 29:10.950]  cookie strain. Yet everybody calls it their own. It calls it something different. You know, and
[29:10.950 --> 29:16.550]  that's sometimes that's the price of being famous and being being big and get getting to think
[29:16.550 --> 29:21.750]  something that on that level out there. I mean, gelato when it first came out, I thought it was
[29:21.750 --> 29:27.030]  great. I didn't think it was going to be what it is today. I really honestly and I know sure.
[29:27.030 --> 29:34.230]  Bansky, I know Mario pretty well. We've been friends for over 10 years, maybe about 10 years.
[29:35.750 --> 29:39.670]  And, you know, that that's a winner, man. That's a winner in my book. I remember, you know,
[29:39.670 --> 29:44.390]  the Sherbert. The funny thing is, I thought the Sherbert was the one and I honest to God thought
[29:44.390 --> 29:50.550]  the Sherbert was, you know, when he showed me Sherbert for the first time, I was I was blown
[29:50.550 --> 29:55.670]  away. I thought it was absolutely amazing. I thought that was going to be the next cookies.
[29:55.670 --> 30:00.870]  And I guess it kind of was the next cookies for a second. Girl Scout cookies kind of put San
[30:00.870 --> 30:04.390]  Francisco on the map for because it was like a real Bay Area thing. You know, it's like
[30:05.270 --> 30:11.270]  cookies was Bay Area. At the time, it was like, oh, oh, gee, was in L.A. cookies was in the Bay
[30:11.270 --> 30:15.990]  Area. If you went over to the East Coast, it was sour diesel and chem dog. And it was like sour
[30:15.990 --> 30:21.270]  diesel was in New York. And then if you went up to Boston, went up to the Boston, anything up there
[30:21.270 --> 30:31.830]  was like sour diesel or chem dog. So. Yeah, so that's a good one. Let's see. Make sure your
[30:31.830 --> 30:38.070]  shit is better than 90 percent of everyone else's. That's the truth. If you're going to do it,
[30:38.070 --> 30:43.110]  don't do it just to do it. I mean, there's a lot of guys. There's 99 out of 100 guys are just
[30:43.670 --> 30:47.270]  doing it, creating stuff that's inferior. You want to be that one percent. And that goes through
[30:47.270 --> 30:51.910]  everything in life. Try to be that one percent, whether you're a chef, whether you're a grower,
[30:51.910 --> 30:55.510]  whether you're a breeder, extract artist, it doesn't matter. You want to have stuff that's
[30:55.510 --> 30:59.430]  better. And I mean, I strive for that point zero one percent. That's that's what I'm looking for.
[30:59.430 --> 31:03.590]  I want to be the best in the thousand. Doesn't mean you're going to be, but at least strive for
[31:03.590 --> 31:08.790]  that. I mean, at the very least, strive for it because you can set yourself on another level
[31:08.790 --> 31:12.310]  where you're not competing with that 99 percent. If you're in that one percent,
[31:12.950 --> 31:18.070]  you can compete with that point zero one percent. Really strive for that. And there's only a handful
[31:18.070 --> 31:25.350]  of guys doing it. I mean, cannabis is not easy to grow. Cannabis is not making seeds is easy.
[31:25.350 --> 31:30.710]  Breeding isn't easy. These things are are difficult. These things take time to learn.
[31:30.710 --> 31:34.950]  These things take a lot of time to learn. Yet you can do them after the first time and you can be a
[31:34.950 --> 31:40.470]  grower. You can make seeds and all of a sudden you're a breeder. You know, it's all about taking
[31:40.470 --> 31:45.910]  the time and doing it right and competing with yourself. So we got we started breeding in the
[31:45.910 --> 31:51.030]  early 70s using Mexican, Colombian and Thai vaccines. In 76, we got the Indica strain from
[31:51.030 --> 31:58.230]  Steve Murphy. Awesome. That's great. That's Greg McAllister tuning in from Hawaii. Greg McAllister,
[31:58.230 --> 32:03.670]  we need to get you on the show one of these days, man. He he he likes lurking in the chat. He's very
[32:03.670 --> 32:10.790]  content and retired, as he likes to tell me. I think, you know, I think Shcherbinsky told me
[32:10.790 --> 32:13.910]  three years ago he was going to retire. I don't know if he has or not. You know, I haven't talked
[32:13.910 --> 32:23.190]  to him in a minute, but it's funny. So 18 is don't listen to the naysayers. That's a big one.
[32:23.990 --> 32:27.830]  There's going to be people, you know, and that, you know, some of these tips are like life tips,
[32:27.830 --> 32:32.230]  too. I think if I would have listened to people's advice throughout my life, all their advice,
[32:32.230 --> 32:39.350]  I wouldn't be here today. Loud seeds wouldn't be a thing. I wouldn't be doing what I do. I've had
[32:39.350 --> 32:45.110]  people tell me that seeds will never sell. My genetics are going to be good. And I said,
[32:45.110 --> 32:49.590]  sure, being retired. No, he's not retiring. He probably can retire, but he's not retiring.
[32:51.030 --> 32:55.030]  But don't listen to the naysayers. There's tons of people out there that are going to say,
[32:55.030 --> 32:59.110]  you know, you're not going to be successful at this. There's haters all over the place.
[32:59.110 --> 33:04.150]  Do what you love doing and be passionate about it and you'll be successful and just keep doing it.
[33:04.150 --> 33:09.350]  If you love it, just keep doing it. Loud seeds. Honestly, I had when I started loud seeds,
[33:10.230 --> 33:15.110]  you know, loud seeds was like me myself. You know, I had helped breeding with my partner, Luke,
[33:15.110 --> 33:19.990]  but I did it for the first little bit on my own. And I had everybody around me telling me that
[33:19.990 --> 33:24.630]  loud seeds was going to suck and I was never going to make any money. And why am I wasting my time
[33:24.630 --> 33:29.670]  with breeding when I could make so much more money growing wheat? And the thing is, is like
[33:29.670 --> 33:33.910]  seed sell for 10x. Like if you have a room, you can get 10x, but it takes, it's a long play.
[33:35.430 --> 33:38.630]  And I really feel like there's only a handful of people making money doing it. It's like
[33:39.590 --> 33:44.630]  anybody can make seeds, people that are breeding or doing it right. There, you know, there is,
[33:45.350 --> 33:50.070]  there is opportunity to become extremely successful with it. But it's just like being
[33:50.070 --> 33:55.430]  an artist. I mean, a handful of people are successful and a lot of people fail. So
[33:57.750 --> 34:04.230]  reversing plants. I got a great tip on reversing plants. Practice, practice, practice. Not all
[34:04.230 --> 34:09.510]  plants reverses easily. Know what you're using. I use a nano silver to reverse my plants right now.
[34:09.510 --> 34:15.030]  The recipe is going to be in my book. Maybe, just maybe I'll get my buddy Tim who came up with the
[34:15.030 --> 34:18.230]  recipe that's on the book. We'll get them on the show and we'll, we'll talk about it maybe in a
[34:18.230 --> 34:24.710]  couple of weeks. But practice reversing your plants, practice reversing your females that
[34:24.710 --> 34:32.070]  you're going to use. I think practice is one of the most important things. You know, don't expect
[34:32.070 --> 34:36.710]  good results from your first time. Yeah. And that kind of goes with everything, but really don't
[34:36.710 --> 34:43.030]  expect those results that you're going to get this bad-ass reversal. Sometimes you'll spray it. And
[34:43.350 --> 34:48.230]  for me, it's like we spray over there. I have a new way of doing it. That's guaranteed almost.
[34:48.230 --> 34:54.470]  But with what I used to do with colloidal silver or STS, it didn't always work. You know,
[34:54.470 --> 34:59.510]  SFVOG was a perfect example of something that does not like reversing. Doesn't mean you can't
[34:59.510 --> 35:04.150]  reverse it. You know, now I have a method that does it. But if you were planning on making seeds
[35:04.150 --> 35:07.430]  and all of a sudden you're reversing stuff and you're basically going to intermingle these
[35:07.430 --> 35:11.990]  plants and not use the pollen and brush it on or spray it on or whatever you do,
[35:12.550 --> 35:15.990]  if you plan on intermingling and you have this window set up, if it doesn't reverse,
[35:15.990 --> 35:19.910]  basically you're just going to be growing flower. Or if you get a partial reversal,
[35:19.910 --> 35:25.590]  then you're going to have very few seeds rather than a lot of seeds. So practice, practice, practice.
[35:29.270 --> 35:35.590]  Another one. Great tip. It's another life tip. Set yourself up for success by planting properly.
[35:36.470 --> 35:41.750]  I think a lot of us, we don't have a lot of time always. And I think it's important
[35:43.430 --> 35:47.350]  that we're properly prepping everything. Get your shit together before you're doing it.
[35:49.190 --> 35:55.270]  Planning is such a part of growing. Also taking notes. I think in this day and age, a lot of
[35:55.270 --> 35:59.110]  people have a hard time taking notes for whatever reason. We have these smartphones. We got these
[35:59.110 --> 36:05.590]  smartphones right here. You use it. There's so many different tools. I use a tool called Evernote.
[36:06.230 --> 36:14.950]  I use that a lot. This program is amazing. I have 1,190 notes in my Evernote. I also use Google
[36:14.950 --> 36:23.590]  Docs on my phone with Google Drive. I think proper planning, calendars, you can use your calendars.
[36:23.590 --> 36:32.070]  All those things are important. And go back to those questions. Oh, no. Reading tips. Okay. Here
[36:32.070 --> 36:37.910]  we go. Person plan. Yeah. Let me see. What number are we on right now? Let me go back to my...
[36:40.550 --> 36:46.230]  21. Three more. 21, 22, and 23. It's the home stretch. Okay. Set yourself up for success. That
[36:46.230 --> 36:50.230]  was the last one. If you have a small space... Oh, this goes into one of the questions that we
[36:50.230 --> 36:56.630]  got earlier. But if you have a small space, what should you do? My honest opinion is if you have a
[36:56.630 --> 37:02.710]  small space, you should do one seed run a year and then use the rest of that year to test out your
[37:02.710 --> 37:10.630]  seeds. Or you breed outdoors and then you use your room for testing. There's a lot of ways to do it.
[37:10.630 --> 37:15.830]  But really breeding... It's not about making seeds all the time. It's about testing and finding
[37:15.830 --> 37:20.710]  shit. It's about testing and finding outliers, testing and finding new varieties, seeing what
[37:20.710 --> 37:28.630]  works, what doesn't work. Again, that goes back to being a great grower. Number 22. Phenohunting
[37:28.630 --> 37:35.350]  is the real work. End of story with that. It's like phenohunting is everything with breeding.
[37:35.350 --> 37:39.670]  You can make seeds and be a breeder or pollen chuck or whatever you want to call it. But really,
[37:39.670 --> 37:45.510]  it's all about finding those keepers. Doing that selection process. Even with autoflowers, really,
[37:46.070 --> 37:53.590]  magic is in the selection process. My buddy Nick, it's all about our selection. I've done
[37:53.590 --> 37:59.190]  seeds with him and with the autoflowers. It's really going around the room and spending a lot
[37:59.190 --> 38:04.550]  of time in there smelling and looking at structure and taking notes and marking plants. Especially if
[38:04.550 --> 38:09.270]  you have a bigger room, you really have to mark your plants with plant tags. You can do whatever,
[38:09.270 --> 38:15.190]  however you want to do it. But going through and knowing that room. Odie from Homegrown Natural
[38:15.190 --> 38:20.710]  Wonders, one of my good friends, he's maybe one of the best at it. If you ever have a chance,
[38:20.710 --> 38:27.670]  anybody, talk to him about it. I've worked with him on doing selections. It's like spending time
[38:27.670 --> 38:31.590]  with your plants, love your plants, hold your plants, whatever you want to do. But know your
[38:31.590 --> 38:38.230]  plants and get your selections from your room. Big or small, know those plants. The last one.
[38:38.390 --> 38:43.990]  There's 2,000 seed companies. Less than 10, I think, are actually producing commercial quality,
[38:43.990 --> 38:50.950]  amazing genetics. The other thing is, those 10 companies, half of them are producing seeds for
[38:50.950 --> 38:56.150]  everybody else, too. You look at the whole European market, I would say there's only
[38:58.550 --> 39:02.310]  20, 30 companies at the most. There's thousands of companies over there. There's thousands of
[39:02.310 --> 39:05.830]  people that are selling their seed companies, but they're just buying and reselling.
[39:05.910 --> 39:12.070]  I sell bulk seeds. I think there's nothing wrong with that. Know your seed, know your breeder,
[39:12.070 --> 39:19.190]  make sure people are legitimate. That's it for my tips for today. We filled up what?
[39:19.750 --> 39:25.590]  45 minutes in tips. It's not bad. I'm overwhelmed with questions.
[39:26.710 --> 39:33.670]  Literally, you've been talking and I've been copy pasting good jokes.
[39:34.470 --> 39:48.230]  Good God. I need an assistant. You want to pick one from the ones I sent you before we started,
[39:48.230 --> 39:53.350]  or you want me to just start firing away? Randomly asking stuff. It doesn't even have
[39:53.350 --> 39:56.470]  to be about weed. We could be talking about whatever. Pokemon.
[39:56.790 --> 39:59.030]  Pokemon. Pokemon.
[40:06.480 --> 40:10.960]  Give me a second, everyone, because I have eight pages of...
[40:13.680 --> 40:20.240]  Here was one. This was in the Discord, or I think it was... I actually don't remember where this one
[40:20.240 --> 40:27.200]  was from. Henry asked, what is the difference in using what's a strain? Basically, it doesn't
[40:27.200 --> 40:33.440]  matter which one's the mom and which one's the dad when you're breeding, or if you reversed it.
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.840]  Would you get a different result if the sexes were switched? Then someone else, King Fisher,
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.680]  clarified the question. I think Henry is asking, will you get a different result in the F1 if you
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.960]  breed, say, a male aphid cross with a female skunk compared to a female aphid cross with a
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.840]  male skunk, or is one side of a cross dominant over the other depending on which sex the male
[40:55.840 --> 41:02.400]  or female... Basically, just... I kind of said it earlier, but each parent, whether it's a donor or
[41:02.400 --> 41:12.480]  receiver, is going to pass on specific traits. It's not an easy... You can't pull it apart,
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.440]  but timing always... Donors are going to... The donor or the male is going to pass on
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.440]  flowering time. As far as structure, you're going to get structure. The funny thing is,
[41:23.440 --> 41:30.000]  this is why selecting males is so tricky, is it's not all about what the male looks like. It's what
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.560]  it's going to pass on. That male passing on structure, it's not going to pass on the structure.
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.920]  If it's a female, it's not going to pass on the same structure. It's going to be a shorter plant.
[41:39.920 --> 41:45.200]  It's going to be more girthy, not as stringy. These are things you all have to be aware of.
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.800]  Also, knowing your cultivar. If, let's say, your plant is jack dominant with that
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.600]  terpenoline limonene, it doesn't matter whether it's in the donor or receiver,
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.880]  99% of the progeny probably will have some of that terpene profile in it. It's just a real dominant
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.000]  thing. Adam Dunn and I have both worked with stuff like that a lot as far as with jack,
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.800]  but it seems like the more you mix this stuff together, all these complex polyhybrids,
[42:10.800 --> 42:17.600]  you end up getting jack. It's that... Not even jack, but the terpenoline limonene terpene profile,
[42:17.840 --> 42:24.800]  that hazy stuff that we're familiar with, this haze, that is an interesting one.
[42:24.800 --> 42:30.000]  But then you take that in the F2, a little bit off topic, but you take something like sour diesel,
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.640]  spicy jack. Spicy jack definitely had jack in it. This is the original loud that we had,
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.160]  but in that F1, they all had jack. They had some amazing structure, but they had a little bit of
[42:40.160 --> 42:46.160]  jack with a sour gas. But then in the F2, we get a loudberry. Loudberry has no jack. It has
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.560]  straight fresh berries with gas. There's a lot of different ways to do it. But yeah,
[42:52.560 --> 42:58.160]  to answer the question, yeah, sure. Definitely, you get traits passed on from both parents.
[43:00.560 --> 43:07.280]  Terps from the pops, but also terps from the mom. Flowering time is an important one.
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.720]  Vigor from both plants. I think vigor comes from heterosis. Those familiar with heterosis,
[43:14.720 --> 43:20.960]  hybrid vigor, that comes from using diverse genetics. If you're taking a gelato and just
[43:20.960 --> 43:27.680]  making another gelato, that's important to know that if you're doing gelato on gelato or chem on
[43:27.680 --> 43:31.600]  chem or any of these things on each other, you're not introducing genetic diversity.
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.720]  To get genetic diversity, you actually have to introduce heterosis, which is genetic diversity
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.480]  from two different plants that have two different lines. Cross those two things together, you're
[43:40.480 --> 43:49.570]  going to get something that is more vigorous. Peter, what's next?
[43:51.410 --> 43:56.290]  Okay, well, this one actually came in a while ago. I made a little slide for it.
[43:56.290 --> 43:57.810]  Oh, no. Perfect.
[43:57.810 --> 44:02.370]  I have eight-year-old beans that won't pop. The ones that do will not grow past the first leaves.
[44:02.370 --> 44:08.770]  Do you have any info on getting old beans to sprout? That is from Derek in Canada,
[44:08.770 --> 44:10.930]  hence the Canadian maple leaf.
[44:11.810 --> 44:13.570]  Derek in Canada, just send me your seeds.
[44:18.290 --> 44:22.450]  The thing is, there's no guarantee with stuff. If the stuff has been out in the sun, or it's been
[44:22.450 --> 44:27.010]  in the humidity, or it's gotten hot and cold and hot and cold for several years, yeah, you might
[44:27.010 --> 44:33.010]  not get any germination. If you have a big bag of them, there's a chance that you can get them to
[44:33.010 --> 44:39.330]  pop. There's TC labs that actually will get your stuff to germinate potentially and actually can
[44:39.330 --> 44:46.370]  test the genetics of it. We had an interesting one a while back. If you look up in vitro
[44:47.330 --> 44:52.610]  techniques, there's a guy, Purple Caper. He does some in vitro germination I think is real
[44:52.610 --> 44:57.810]  interesting. Tips, if you have a bunch of seeds to play around with, and you're just trying to do
[44:57.810 --> 45:03.970]  something basic, and you need those seeds to pop, I think scarification. You use a matchbox. What
[45:03.970 --> 45:07.890]  you're doing is you're scratching the surface of those seeds. You're scarring the surface of those
[45:07.890 --> 45:15.890]  seeds before you soak them. If you're using old seeds, always use something like hydrogen
[45:15.890 --> 45:22.290]  peroxide or bleach with a soak. I think it's a 5% bleach. I don't use bleach. I use hydrogen
[45:22.290 --> 45:28.690]  peroxide at a 6 to 1 ratio. I believe you could sterilize the surface of those seeds with bleach
[45:28.690 --> 45:34.610]  with a 5% solution. Hydrogen peroxide works great. That's what I do. I do a 24-hour soak.
[45:35.410 --> 45:40.690]  You'll get a higher germination rate regardless. If you have something old, that's great
[45:41.490 --> 45:47.890]  basic stuff. K&F Seed Soak. Perfect. Greg McAllister, you're coming on the show, man.
[45:48.450 --> 45:51.250]  Or we just give you your own show. I'd be okay with that too.
[45:52.130 --> 45:57.410]  Or he can just—he doesn't even need to come on. He just needs to answer the questions in the chat,
[45:57.410 --> 45:59.890]  and we'll post the answers on screen.
[45:59.890 --> 46:03.650]  Perfect. What do we got next, Peter?
[46:04.210 --> 46:11.490]  Actually, this was John from Raise Cannabis posted a while ago, and I thought it was an
[46:11.490 --> 46:20.210]  interesting topic. It was a picture of his favorite pheno of Han Solo hash plant with the bud clone.
[46:20.210 --> 46:25.250]  Comeback. Reveg is an interesting process as it happens quite differently from one plant
[46:25.250 --> 46:28.530]  to the next in my experience. Can you talk about reveging?
[46:29.570 --> 46:32.770]  It's so funny you asked that. We were talking about Odie from Homegrown Natural Wonders.
[46:33.890 --> 46:39.330]  He was from TGA originally, and he does Homegrown Natural Wonders. He works for the Dutch consulting,
[46:39.330 --> 46:44.050]  and I have to give him 100% of the credit because I thought the whole revege thing was bullshit.
[46:44.050 --> 46:49.330]  Him and Short Brooks, who I'm good friends with both guys, they kept telling me—they
[46:49.330 --> 46:52.690]  even sent me some pictures. I'm like, eh, no. The whole revege thing, you need to take
[46:52.690 --> 46:57.330]  copies of your clones, grow the plants out, and then you have your backup as your copy.
[46:57.330 --> 47:01.250]  They're like, no, you can't do that with 20,000 seeds. It's like, well, I don't work with 20,000
[47:01.250 --> 47:07.410]  seeds. I went down to Harborside when they were doing selections, and they do a revege process.
[47:07.410 --> 47:12.930]  They narrowed, I think, at Harborside—they did it in Wilcox. Short did it in Wilcox like 20,000
[47:12.930 --> 47:18.210]  and then does a revege. In Harborside, where I went down, they did 8,000 seeds.
[47:18.850 --> 47:24.930]  They did their selections. They kept 400, and they did a revege. What you do with the revege,
[47:24.930 --> 47:29.730]  which I'm totally sold on it because I saw it firsthand, is you trim off most of the buds on
[47:29.730 --> 47:33.730]  your plants. You'll have your plant. You'll trim the buds off. You want to make sure to leave some
[47:33.730 --> 47:39.810]  of the leaf. Ideally, you want to do it as soon as you can to revege. The further you wait,
[47:40.370 --> 47:47.330]  the longer it takes. Also, the lower chances. If you go further, your chances decrease.
[47:48.370 --> 47:52.930]  Taking off most of the bud, you can leave—basically, with the internodes, you can
[47:52.930 --> 47:57.730]  leave the buds, the small buds, but take the main stuff off and make sure there's actual leaf.
[47:58.690 --> 48:03.410]  You're looking at plant material on there that they can basically sprout. You'll sprout new
[48:03.410 --> 48:09.490]  shoots right out of those old plant material—or not plant material, but out of the plant.
[48:10.850 --> 48:16.050]  At the nodes, you'll get new shoots. With those new shoots, you will get new growth that you can
[48:16.050 --> 48:23.010]  take clones off of. It's relatively simple. You basically just put it back in veg under 24 hours.
[48:23.090 --> 48:30.930]  I believe they do 24 hours. You do that for the first week. Then you go back to whatever your 20
[48:30.930 --> 48:37.650]  hour or your veg room is at. I think that's pretty self-explanatory.
[48:38.850 --> 48:46.210]  Yeah. Here is actually the—this was John's comment.
[48:47.250 --> 48:47.730]  Oh, nice.
[48:47.730 --> 48:57.550]  Anyway, then related to that, Sean asked genetic drift with revegging.
[48:59.950 --> 49:04.030]  I always thought there was the possibility of epigenetics and genetic drift.
[49:05.150 --> 49:10.830]  Any of that stuff is possible. With what I saw at Harborside, I would say that
[49:12.430 --> 49:17.310]  regardless, you get good results. There may be some genetic drift, and it may be
[49:18.270 --> 49:24.190]  more genetic drift on stuff that's less stable. I think that trial and error—I
[49:24.910 --> 49:29.470]  think it's a good way, especially—the revege process to me is if you're doing large scale.
[49:29.470 --> 49:32.830]  If you're not doing large scale, you don't necessarily—or I guess if you don't have a
[49:33.550 --> 49:36.430]  bedroom. If you're doing it anyway, you need to have a bedroom.
[49:38.350 --> 49:41.870]  Even at small scale, if you're going to have moms alive, you're going to have to have a bedroom.
[49:41.870 --> 49:46.190]  It makes more sense to me at small scale that you would take a clone, put that clone in your mom
[49:46.190 --> 49:51.150]  room, mom that out so you can take cuts off it later. At scale, if you're talking about 8,000
[49:51.150 --> 49:55.470]  plants, he's right. You can't keep 8,000 plants alive, copies of 8,000 plants. That's just too
[49:55.470 --> 50:01.550]  much of a responsibility on a nursery to be successful. The revege process is the only thing
[50:01.550 --> 50:08.030]  that's good. Then having people walking and tagging, at that scale, you can't have one person
[50:08.030 --> 50:14.030]  doing the phenohunt. There's not one person that can be successful, I feel, at doing an 8,000 seed
[50:14.030 --> 50:21.710]  phenohunt. Me, I like it. I personally feel like if one for every 500 to 1,000 plants, you can do
[50:21.710 --> 50:30.110]  that successfully. To go through and walk 8,000 plants and your nose gets burned, there's too much
[50:30.110 --> 50:35.390]  time and there's too many things that you're looking for unless that's your sole job. Even
[50:35.390 --> 50:39.310]  still, I feel like that 1,000 plants per person is a good number for phenohunting.
[50:40.270 --> 50:42.510]  Chris Bounds And then related,
[50:44.030 --> 50:45.310]  reveging a male plant.
[50:45.310 --> 50:48.110]  Dr. Jack Kruse Yeah. Has anyone been able to
[50:48.110 --> 50:57.070]  revege a male plant? I've never done it. Tissue culture, male plants and tissue culture have
[50:57.070 --> 51:04.590]  problems. I think a lot of males just tend to auto flower too. Even at 24 hours worth of light,
[51:04.590 --> 51:11.230]  you can get the auto flower. Is it possible? Possibly. Is it possible to tissue culture?
[51:12.110 --> 51:17.470]  I think there's things you can do with tissue culture as far as hormones are concerned and
[51:17.470 --> 51:23.550]  nutrition that you could potentially be able to do with tissue culture regardless. As far as I've
[51:23.550 --> 51:27.670]  never done it personally. Chris Bounds
[51:27.670 --> 51:31.270]  Just things to keep in mind when you're trying to revege.
[51:31.270 --> 51:33.910]  Dr. Jack Kruse Overfeeding it nitrogen is helpful,
[51:33.910 --> 51:36.630]  but overwatering a reveger is a big no-no.
[51:36.630 --> 51:37.270]  Chris Bounds Correct.
[51:39.270 --> 51:44.150]  Nitrogen, if you're a breeder, nitrogen is your friend. I think that's something to always
[51:44.150 --> 51:49.670]  remember. There's not too much nitrogen, but a healthy dose of nitrogen in the flower cycle
[51:49.670 --> 51:55.430]  when making seeds gives you better seeds. It's not like your typical grow where you definitely
[51:55.430 --> 52:00.230]  want to go low on the nitrogen in flower because you're not looking for buds, you're looking for
[52:00.230 --> 52:06.150]  seeds. How many plants revege faster after pruning away most of the previous growth like
[52:06.150 --> 52:12.150]  cutting back roses and chili bushes? Yep, I agree 100%. That's exactly how you want to do it. You
[52:12.150 --> 52:18.230]  want to get rid of the flowers. You want to basically have a smaller plant that most of the
[52:18.230 --> 52:22.950]  plant material is gone. But yeah, it's pretty much that simple. And I think it's really easy.
[52:22.950 --> 52:24.390]  Dr. Jack Kruse And then there's a
[52:24.390 --> 52:25.670]  clarification question.
[52:26.230 --> 52:29.030]  Chris Bounds So genetic drift, if we're talking about,
[52:29.910 --> 52:35.350]  yeah, I mean, I would say, put that question up one more time here. Does he mean expression of
[52:35.350 --> 52:40.150]  phenotype is genetic drift? Yeah, genetic drift is a weird thing because like, you would,
[52:41.350 --> 52:46.230]  genomics would be able to tell you about actual true genetic drift and even epigenetics,
[52:46.230 --> 52:54.310]  they don't show up with, with the genomics testing necessarily. But it's phenotypes,
[52:54.310 --> 52:59.910]  it's phenotypes, phenotype change. Sure, the plants could change potentially the expression
[52:59.910 --> 53:05.030]  can change. I think that's really what we're talking about is the expression of the plant
[53:05.030 --> 53:09.270]  changing, but it also changes from seed to clone, you know, and then from clone to clone,
[53:09.270 --> 53:14.790]  you're with sexual maturity. I think that's the key we're looking for. There is sexual maturity
[53:14.790 --> 53:20.950]  after the plant has been alive for so long, it reaches sexual maturity, and it will express
[53:20.950 --> 53:26.310]  itself. You know, from there on out, it'll express itself similar. And and then in terms
[53:26.310 --> 53:31.670]  of things like lighting, what's your kind of light strategy during the revenge process,
[53:31.670 --> 53:37.430]  you guys are 24 seven with super low light. I, you know, I've heard that you can do it like that
[53:37.430 --> 53:42.950]  for a week and then turn your lights back but 24 hours a day. Sure. I like 24 hours with auto flower
[53:42.950 --> 53:48.470]  to you know, I grow my auto flowers on 20 hours late typically, after the first week with auto
[53:48.470 --> 54:02.160]  flowers. Okay, give me one second. All right, so everybody hold tight while I scroll through the
[54:02.160 --> 54:18.320]  questions. And we're going to be doing a question. I'll talk a little bit about Black Friday. So
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.240]  we're going to be releasing some seeds into the ganja farmer seed company brand with Marlon Asher.
[54:22.880 --> 54:28.240]  In fact, I might have a special guest next Friday. We'll see on the James Ladd show, we're going to
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.920]  do a early morning, it's going to be a short one, but we're going to talk about some of the Black
[54:31.920 --> 54:38.160]  Friday specials. And loud canna genetics is one of my new partnership companies. We will be
[54:38.160 --> 54:42.960]  releasing the glue lotto. In fact, I think the blue lotto is available right now on the site.
[54:42.960 --> 54:49.440]  Peter could probably send set a link up. Yeah, daggett.love. If you're interested in the glue
[54:49.440 --> 54:55.040]  lotto, loud canna genetics, we're releasing some stuff on seeds here now and on daggett.love with
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.840]  Peter, Black Friday specials and they're going to be cheap. You're going to be able to get five
[54:59.840 --> 55:06.080]  seeds for I don't know how cheap they go, but they're cheap, real cheap. So tune in and then
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.920]  we'll be probably doing some giveaways. I think that'd be fun to do some giveaways on Friday.
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.360]  You want to pack a glue lotto? Oh, the other one that we got is the candy peel gelato or the purple
[55:15.360 --> 55:20.400]  tan gelato, whatever you want to call it. I guess the real name is the purple tan gelato, but
[55:21.440 --> 55:26.560]  either way it has a, you know, it's an interesting one. That was with OG Steve, my buddy. He gave me
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.360]  a purple tangy male, made some seeds, gave him some seeds, but we'll be releasing some of this
[55:31.360 --> 55:42.950]  stuff for Black Friday and it's available at daggett.love right now. So blind joke. Sorry.
[55:42.950 --> 55:47.270]  Yeah. There's a lot of seeds in here. Does anybody know how many seeds? If you get that right,
[55:47.270 --> 55:53.270]  I'm going to send you a pack of the purple tan gelato. You'll get a 10 pack or I'll give you a
[55:53.270 --> 55:57.830]  12 pack. How's that? 12 pack of the purple tan gelato. If you can guess the right amount of
[55:58.790 --> 56:07.350]  the seeds in this bag. How about this? And since I don't want to come back into the chat,
[56:08.550 --> 56:17.030]  if people can post it on the discord, which I just posted a link to, and we'll sort it out
[56:17.030 --> 56:23.670]  after the show, whoever gets closest first in the discord chat, we'll get that pack over to you.
[56:23.910 --> 56:34.230]  But, and also Sir Lance a lot, Mr. Lance Lambert says hi. And he also, he's in charge of our
[56:36.790 --> 56:43.990]  giveaways and something that we can give away if we want to right now is
[56:44.230 --> 56:51.670]  a pipe, a peacemaker, which there's Lance's in his backyard with his
[56:52.790 --> 56:59.670]  dank Lance flower that he, I assume grew this season. So we'll give that away at some point.
[56:59.670 --> 57:04.790]  I got to, we got to figure out some fun ways to give shit away. So if like, if we always want to
[57:04.790 --> 57:13.270]  do what hat to James wear last week, you want to do that one for this? Sure. Well, first, do you
[57:13.270 --> 57:16.470]  remember what hat you wore last week? Cause neither of us last time, remember the hat you
[57:16.470 --> 57:20.870]  wore the week before? Yeah, we were both wrong on that, but that's okay. We had some winners anyway.
[57:21.830 --> 57:23.670]  So do you remember? I don't remember.
[57:26.470 --> 57:28.310]  All right. Hold on.
[57:32.150 --> 57:35.430]  Go ahead. I can find out what it is. Hold on one second.
[57:36.710 --> 57:42.230]  Yeah. We already have a San Francisco loud seat hat. I guess a couple of people.
[57:47.280 --> 57:57.600]  So for the seed guesses, click on that link and guess there. And then I'll go through it
[57:57.600 --> 58:05.360]  after the show and James will confirm who is closest. Yeah. Everybody's guessing the San
[58:05.360 --> 58:14.240]  Francisco hat. So we need a different, how about, are you into like Bay area sports history?
[58:15.040 --> 58:21.040]  Me into Bay area sports history a little bit. Okay. So how about like a Bay area history
[58:21.920 --> 58:32.560]  pop quiz question? Like a Warriors, Giants and A's. Oh yeah. How many times have the Giants won
[58:32.560 --> 58:39.840]  the world series in the last 50 years? Okay. First person to answer that correctly. There we go.
[58:40.160 --> 58:43.040]  And I know which hat I was wearing last week now.
[58:44.560 --> 58:45.360]  Oh, the week before.
[58:47.760 --> 58:50.720]  Okay. So who can answer the Giants?
[58:53.280 --> 58:59.320]  All right. We have three from Mr. Snagged in. Duras said four.
[59:00.680 --> 59:02.920]  I started, Rob said five before that.
[59:04.520 --> 59:12.170]  And then we have a couple of twos. So basically we have two, we have one and then seven for Kat.
[59:12.410 --> 59:17.370]  So basically I think we have every number. So what's the correct answer?
[59:18.170 --> 59:23.450]  Well, they won 50 years ago and then they won the 2012, the 2000.
[59:25.290 --> 59:26.890]  They won three times in the last 10 years.
[59:28.650 --> 59:30.010]  But we said 50. So.
[59:30.010 --> 59:32.250]  I said 50, they won four times.
[59:32.250 --> 59:38.890]  Four times. Okay. So the first four, if other people can help me out, it looks like it was DurasBase.
[59:42.170 --> 59:47.690]  Okay. So DurasBase, I'll pop my email address in there and you can,
[59:49.770 --> 01:00:00.530]  Peter, at, congratulations, DurasBase. Lance Lambert is standing by to ship you your
[01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:08.530]  Peacemaker pipe, which as many times as you drop it will not break on you.
[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:13.890]  Well, that Peacemaker pipe is great. If your wife loses her spatula,
[01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:16.690]  it's a nonstick silicone bong. You can actually stir food with it.
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:29.250]  Okay. So back to the regularly scheduled programming. So Blind Joe Death,
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:35.970]  I think this was in the Discord, asked, can we talk about the advantages of using multiple
[01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:40.210]  males and females in a breeding project versus using one-to-one breeding?
[01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:45.010]  Do you ever mix pollen from multiple males or do you always like?
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.410]  Yeah. So I do all kinds of stuff, but I don't know. I wouldn't say that I'm the first person
[01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:52.930]  that did it, but I'm one of the first people that's been talking about it for a long time
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:59.650]  about using different donors on different females. Open pollination is one thing where you basically
[01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:04.850]  randomly pop your seeds and you open pollinate to do a seed raise and then you get a ton of
[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:11.330]  variation. I don't like doing that for the most part. I mean, if you're working with land-raised
[01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.530]  genetics or feral or something like that, and you want the most amount of diversity, that's great.
[01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:20.050]  But for selling seeds, you're not going to have a lot. Like if somebody buys a 10-pack,
[01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:25.650]  they're not necessarily going to get a good thing. Now using three different males for,
[01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:32.370]  you can use one, two, three, four, five different donors or males that represent different things
[01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:37.170]  in the lineage of their parents. That's a good thing because then if you're selling F1s,
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:44.210]  you're getting multiple possibilities. You're increasing your possibilities by three times the
[01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:51.570]  amount. I think that's great, especially with F1s. I wouldn't do that at F2s, F3s, F4s. If you're
[01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:57.090]  back-crossing, those things aren't important. What you need to do is your selection, find the best
[01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:02.290]  male possible, and maybe even use that male multiple times. So I think that's a good thing.
[01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:06.930]  But if you're using an F1 and you're doing it for the first time, there's nothing wrong with using
[01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:13.250]  three. Adam Dunn and I have a line, the sage against the machine. And so with that, I used
[01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:19.890]  three different males that were sage and sour males on different cultivars. I did that because
[01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:25.730]  there's a lot of interesting genetics in that sage and sour cross. It has the big sir holy,
[01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:32.210]  which is a haze, and it has the OG kush. And so that is what makes sage. And then that sage was
[01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:37.730]  put on the sour diesel, and that's what the sage and sour is. And I love the sage and sour. I think
[01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:43.090]  there's some really interesting and awesome phenotypes, and they have all kinds of uniqueness
[01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:50.690]  about them. You get the calyx and the bud structure from the sour with the OG turps and a little bit
[01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:58.850]  of that haziness lime in there. And so with the males, I went for smell and structure. So I did
[01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:03.810]  one that was an OG, definitely a squatter plant that definitely leaned more towards the
[01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:10.530]  Afganica indica type plant. And then I had a big, huge hazy one because I was hoping that some of
[01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:15.250]  the seeds would get some yield and some of that terpene lean. And then I went for one that was
[01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:21.330]  kind of in the middle. So I did that, and we have those seeds available on seeds here now, I believe.
[01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:27.650]  I'm not sure if we're sold out or not, but sage against the machine. And I put that on the GMO,
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.890]  and you get some really interesting funk on there. I think that is a fun one.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  So Peter, what else do we got for questions?
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:49.480]  Yeah, let me actually post it so everyone can read. Well, all right, so I can't post the whole
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:56.360]  thing, but if breeding in multiple tents, what practices can you use to ensure that there aren't
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.080]  any cross-pollination, only have one room available? Basically, he only has one room
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.400]  available to breed, grow. Each tent has exhaust filters, intake is unfiltered.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.280]  You know, take your plants outside and pollinate them outside. And then don't reintroduce,
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.080]  leave them outside for a couple of days. It's ideal in the summer when it's dry.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.280]  But I would suggest taking them out of the environment where you have the chance of
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.280]  contamination. You can even, you know, this is the thing, you can take one plant out. Let's say you
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.160]  want to make seeds with one plant. You can take that plant out of your garage or out of your
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.640]  closet or out of whatever and away from your other plants. You can take that pollen, you can
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:40.600]  pollinate it, or you can mix those two plants together. They can do the little, you know,
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.920]  outside. You put the pollen on, then you can let it go for like three or four days, and then you
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.040]  can reintroduce it back into your room and not have to worry about cross-pollination or not even
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.960]  cross-pollination, pollinating your other plants. And what you want to do is you want to neutralize
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.040]  it with water. H2O neutralizes pollen, if you didn't know that. That's why breeding in a, you
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.480]  know, as far as doing the breeding part where you're putting the pollen on, you want to have
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.920]  real low humidity. Pollen travels further with low humidity. That's why regions like Colorado have
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:15.640]  such bad problems with cross-pollination from hemp, is because the drier it is, the further
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:21.160]  that pollen can fly. So remember that when you're applying pollen in your rooms, make sure to blast
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:27.720]  your dehues on that one day to get as low humidity as possible for when you're doing the pollination.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:38.140]  If you can't take them outside, would a HEPA filter do that? It would, but you got to remember
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:43.100]  these are like particles. You got to change your clothes going in and out. You want to also,
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.020]  the other thing, you can also spray your plants down with water that you don't want to get
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:51.580]  pollinated if they're in a different area or a different tent. But yeah, HEPA filtration will
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:57.260]  filter. I'm pretty sure HEPA, yeah, I mean HEPA will filter out pollen. But pollen, you know,
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.180]  as long as it's humid too with your plants, water neutralizes that pollen.
[01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:10.530]  All right. This has been asked in a couple different ways, and I feel like
[01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:16.130]  you get asked every episode. If I never got asked this question again, I'd be totally okay.
[01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:21.490]  But yeah, how do you select your males? The five characteristics, stem rub.
[01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:29.570]  So males, it's a tricky thing. I go by, it's depending on what you're breeding for.
[01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:34.930]  100%. There's no one definitive answer where I can give you those five traits. It's like,
[01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:39.410]  what am I, am I breeding autos? Am I breeding autos for a specific reason
[01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:45.730]  as far as am I breeding to inbreed? So I want something, like if it's two things that I'm going
[01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:54.930]  to take an F1 male and an F1 female, or feminized, it doesn't matter. But if I'm taking those,
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:59.330]  what do I look for? If it was female and female, I'd look for two identical ones or take one and
[01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:03.250]  self it and put it on itself. If I'm doing regular seeds, I would look for something that's
[01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:10.930]  slightly taller with similar branching, similar leaf pattern, similar grease on the stem, stem rub,
[01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:17.410]  stem smell. I do love the stem smell on plants. Root smell is another thing. I don't know if you
[01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:21.010]  guys hear about root smell, but the root smell, like if you have really good cannabis, your roots
[01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:26.290]  should smell terpy. There's terpenes in the roots. Not that I'm going around smelling everyone's
[01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:38.450]  roots, but it's there. So. So do you agree with this advice? If you plan on inbreeding a line,
[01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:44.130]  starting with multiple males on the first run helps maintain stability multiple generations
[01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:52.770]  down the line. No, I mean, I think that that probably there is some truth to that.
[01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.770]  I personally feel, you know, it's like if you're working with any of these breeding
[01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:01.330]  companies that are working with genomics, you're not necessarily working with a progeny
[01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.770]  and then taking multiple things and going for that for stability. I found stability
[01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:12.450]  from using stable genetics and then breeding as far as if you're talking about,
[01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:18.530]  there's there's multiple ways we're talking about stability, like heterozygosity or homozygosity,
[01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:23.810]  which is what you're trying to achieve is the homozygosity, heterozygosity would be the F1,
[01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:31.010]  and that's phenotypical variation. You know, I'm OK with just using one donor and one receiver when
[01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:37.570]  I'm doing inbred lines. If I'm breeding IBLs, I'm definitely, you know, you can do multiple IBLs.
[01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:44.690]  There's a thing called parallel lines if you're breeding to do inbred lines that you want to
[01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:50.290]  cross together for heterosis. This is something that's used in agriculture, something I really
[01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:54.210]  touch on in my book and I think is important. You know, there's a couple of different ways to add
[01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:59.410]  heterosis from your inbred lines, because what happens is as you go through the breeding process,
[01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:04.770]  each inbred line definitely gets weaker and weaker in the sense of like hybrid vigor and
[01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:10.930]  resistance to pests and disease and things like that. So as you go through generations, you know,
[01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:17.650]  you're F5, F6, F7, F8, your plant is getting weaker to a degree. And so one thing you can do,
[01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:24.930]  one thing you can do that I think is really good is you can use parallel lines. You can start at
[01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:30.210]  the same beginning and breed something that's very similar down the line. So you're breeding F5,
[01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:35.970]  F6 on both of these two lines, and then you can cross those together. Then you get heterosis,
[01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:41.330]  you get hybrid vigor. And what that does is it increases plant health, quality, growth, vigor,
[01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:47.970]  all those things. There's another way, it's not necessarily cheating, but there's the BX,
[01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:53.090]  so the back cross, the cubing, whatever you want to call it. What that is all about is taking your
[01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:59.330]  F1 that you've selected for, you keep that here. Then you create your IBL, which is your F1s
[01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:04.210]  through F7, F8, F9, wherever you're going with that. And then that generation, when you go to
[01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:11.410]  make seeds, you take that, put it back on the F1, or put the F1 on that, either way. But ideally,
[01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:15.650]  you take that, you put that on the F1, and then you make your seeds. Now you have heterosis that
[01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:20.290]  way. And so that little bit of hybrid vigor might be all you need to make a really awesome,
[01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:26.210]  stable seed, especially if we're talking for ag production. Hybrid vigor, that's right.
[01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.170]  Super important term.
[01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:34.770]  Okay, so let me because I want to keep it on. I could go to a totally different topic. But
[01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:40.650]  someone asked what you meant by stability.
[01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:48.890]  Oh, yeah. So what does he mean by stability? Stability is heterosis, and I had trust.
[01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:52.970]  Stability is is not necessarily intersexual traits. I think a lot of people when they hear
[01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:59.130]  the word stable, they think of hermaphrodites. And that's actually a trait. So a trait is
[01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:04.410]  different than stability in the sense that trait is something that can be bred in or out of,
[01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:10.970]  you can increase the intersexual traits or decrease the intersexual traits by breeding.
[01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:17.530]  But stability actually comes to basically phenotypical variation and phenotypical variation.
[01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:24.490]  Basically, each time you breed it, you're breeding more of a homozygous plant. And so
[01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:29.770]  through the inbreeding process, you get less phenotypical variation every generation.
[01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:37.290]  And so you can achieve it typically have seven, you know, using genomics, some people never achieve
[01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:43.290]  it. So auto flowers, it's tricky. You know, that's another one that I think is amazing,
[01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:47.050]  but also tricky. Because you can't keep your plants alive.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:56.960]  When you do a pheno hunt, do you do tests or just on the plants that pass your stem rub test?
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.640]  Oh, no, man, it's not. The thing is, is with the stem rub, a lot of people
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.920]  think that it's something initial, it's something that you need to smell,
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.640]  smell and identify with throughout the life of the plant. So I'm here with your progeny,
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.080]  you want to grow it all up, you know, there's there's going to be outliers in both directions,
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.760]  there'll be stuff you want to call and you want to get rid of right off the bat, you'll see like,
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.360]  fuck, that structure is terrible. Oh, that that has a weird funky mutation. Let's get rid of that.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.840]  Sometimes mutations are cool. But I typically get rid of mutated plants. Some stuff triggers
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.080]  faster and flower and into flower and slower, you know, with the seedling. And I think those
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.520]  are important things to identify. There's like, you're trying to take stuff and
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.200]  force them into flower faster for breeding purposes. But, you know, it's like those,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.000]  those things are interesting things to look for. Sorry, I was multitasking there.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.640]  There is another on the kind of similar. So here was a comment. What are your
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.280]  test male on multiple girls to see where it passes the best shape? Most wanted? Yeah,
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.480]  dude, that's the best way to do it. Testing on multiple things. Use that pollen on a lot of
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.520]  things to see, you know, multiple pollen from multiple males in that progeny or reversing
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.800]  plants and using those different plants that you reverse to, you know, test them on all kinds of
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.880]  stuff. But yeah, I mean, male with the male selection, it's best to test it on stuff and
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.120]  see the outcome. You know, and this is why it takes so long to do good breeding. It doesn't
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.720]  just happen overnight. This is something a lot of stuff can take multiple years. So you got to be
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:44.040]  really vigorous and passionate about it. So for me, it's vigor, flower time, node spacing,
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.600]  morphological structure in general, but it's good rule of thumb in selecting a male
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:14:00.540]  that is more female in its characteristics. Great. Awesome. I love the bluntness of your answers.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:11.340]  Yeah, James loves a good stem ribbon. I, you know, I love touching my plants. I love being
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:18.060]  with my friends. I like smelling plants. There's something, you know, it's nostalgic to a degree,
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.340]  like going through rooms and other people's rooms where you're smelling stuff that you haven't
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:27.260]  smelled in 20 years. I get excited about not only finding new stuff, but also finding old stuff that
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:32.620]  I haven't seen in a long time. That really gets me juiced. You know, and some of the stuff I
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:38.780]  thought was shit back in the day, I think is amazing now. A power plant, which if you would
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:43.340]  have asked me in 1997, when I thought of power plant, I would have told you, you can fucking
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:49.260]  throw that cultivar away, get rid of it. There's no, it's not great. I saw some power plant and
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:52.860]  the first thing I smelled, I was like, fuck, that's power plant. And we smoked some of it.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.940]  I'm like, I fucking like this. This is, it's really good. You know? And so I think there's
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:06.200]  like that, that whole discovery side. That's awesome too. Have you ever dumped a bunch of
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.600]  pollen into water and then shaken and sprayed plants? No, I have not. Now, and maybe that works.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:18.600]  I mean, did pollen bags like in marijuana botany for sure. We got pollen bags in my book. I got
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:26.680]  pollen bags in my room here. I think I definitely got pollen, but yeah, all the bags are great.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.480]  You can, you can do, you know, just to touch on that really quickly. Pollen bags are great
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.600]  because you can take one plant with pollen bags, load a little bit of pollen in a bag or brush the
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:42.120]  plant, put a pollen bag over the top of it, tie it. You can do, as long as you tag them correctly,
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.400]  you could do 50 strains, not 50, but you can probably do 10 strains on one plant fairly easily
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:53.400]  on a big size plant. I know a lot of outdoor growers that go around and do that with certain
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.760]  stuff to make a lot of different varieties. It's really simple. You can probably type in plant,
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.480]  the pollen bags in Google and something will come up where you can get them.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.680]  They do polyethylene ones, and then there's cloth ones. One of the other ones my friend uses, you
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.360]  know, for bigger buds is like a paper. I learned this a while back, but it's a good one. You take
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:20.600]  a paper, paper bag for bread. The kind you get bread from the stores in, the long paper ones.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.360]  You take that and you can put the pollen in. One of my buddies used to do is he used to take the
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.560]  pollen, put it all the way at the end and kind of curl it up and you slide it over the bud. You
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:36.200]  basically tie it with a tie or plastic, whatever. And then you open that up and you shake it. And
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:43.930]  that'll pollinate that area without getting anything on the rest of the plant. When you
[01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:53.450]  pheno hunt, do you care about size of ovules? I mean, ovule size, sure. You know, these are
[01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:59.130]  little things that, you know, is that something that's a main concern for me? I think,
[01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:05.210]  you know, calyx size and calyx structure are the most, you know, you can go detailed on the
[01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:13.450]  ovules, whatever, but it's like calyx. And then as far as calyx size and structure density,
[01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:19.850]  these things, the density, you know, and then node spacing. I mean, I think these are all important,
[01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:24.730]  you know, and it's just so individual to a plant. If I'm breeding something that's a sativa,
[01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:29.690]  whatever you want to call it, a tropical equatorial variety, I want something that has
[01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:35.130]  more node spacing than something, if I'm breeding an OG, you know, or something that's more of the
[01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:41.770]  afghanica. So I think another thing people should consider is geographical location. Where are you
[01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:47.290]  breeding for? What does that environment need for the plant to be successful? What does that plant
[01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:52.410]  need for it to be successful in that environment? So if you're breeding something that's tropical
[01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:57.050]  equatorial, you want to open bud structure. Now, that's not something you necessarily want in some
[01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:02.010]  really hot regions because it just, you know, it'll foxtail and it won't be high quality. But
[01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:07.610]  if you go to the Caribbean, you have to have open bud structure. So breeding for your environment,
[01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:11.130]  I think, is huge. That geographical location, especially if it's out there.
[01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.490]  And there was a geographical location question.
[01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:25.850]  Nice. Rapid to basket. Okay. Tropical areas with 12-12 all the time. Any good tips about strains
[01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:30.970]  good for breeding there? That's just basically what I talked about. I think it's super important
[01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:37.130]  to breed for region. Open bud structure is important. You know, there's so many things.
[01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.730]  You can make your own hybrids. Just make sure you're starting with something that's
[01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:46.250]  either acclimated to that environment or something that's suitable as far as bud structure. You know,
[01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:51.290]  especially tropical equatorial. It's 12-12. You don't want something that goes into flower right
[01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:58.330]  away that you end up with a plant that tall. You know, I think knowing your varieties, testing your
[01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:02.330]  varieties out there, but that doesn't mean that you can't have something that represents some
[01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:08.570]  part of OG Kush in the Caribbean and have it do well. You just need to do some complementary
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:13.610]  breeding with some of the local stuff or some of the stuff that'll do well in that region.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.520]  Genotype testing. What do you want to know about genotype testing? So as far as,
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.240]  I guess we can talk about genomics and genotype testing. You know, I had Energine on my show a
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:38.200]  while back. They touched on it for sure on genomics. Genotype testing, it's the future
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.560]  of cannabis. I mean, it's used in agriculture now. Everybody's going to be breeding with genomics
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:49.560]  eventually. Not everybody, but the big breeders will all be doing that. And as far as the benefits
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:57.320]  of genomics is plant patents and also accelerated breeding. What that means is you can identify
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.000]  plants when they're this big. Well, when you can get a leaf sample off, you can take that plant,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.840]  you can send it to get the genetics tested, the genomics, and it'll test the DNA and they'll
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:18.520]  sequence the DNA and then you can breed towards markers. And my dog's going crazy. A little baby
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.400]  schnauzer. But, you know, and I think a lot of people, you know, if you can't afford to do that,
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:28.760]  another great solution, if you're tuning in is, you know, terpene profiles. If you get THC,
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:35.240]  data driven breeding is super important if you can do it, if you can afford it. Knowing your THC
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:41.080]  percentages and your cannabinoid profiles. Genomics is huge for drug discovery and it's huge for
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.240]  patents and accelerated breeding, but it's not something that everybody needs to do. And it's
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:51.320]  not really attainable. You know, Energine, you know, they're charging $100,000 per variety if
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.400]  you're trying to make a strain. Not everybody has $100,000 to throw at something like that.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:05.920]  So, what else we got, Peter? So, what do you call it? This is a great question. But yeah,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.600]  what do you call open bud structure? The one that is more hairy or the other one? It's not
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:19.040]  about hairs. Open bud structure has to be with the density of the calyx and node spacing typically.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.760]  But you can have node spacing on something that's definitely like Girl Scout cookies,
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.680]  that's terrible node spacing, but a tight bud structure. If we're talking about a
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:34.400]  open bud structure, what I'm talking about is sour diesel, hazes, stuff that's definitely
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.640]  equatorial, tropical. And what that does is it has enough space in the node, not in the node,
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.280]  in the calyx, it has enough space to actually allow moisture to come in and out. The reason
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.240]  it has an open bud structure that it does well in those regions is because with that open bud
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.240]  structure, you can get moisture in and moisture out. Whereas if you have something that's really
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:00.000]  tight, I can even use a sativa, which most people would consider a sativa in this day. Blue Dream
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.920]  is something that definitely has some leaning towards it. They call it a sativa, but it doesn't
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.680]  have an open bud structure. It has this real tight bud structure. What happens is if you get
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:16.480]  moisture inside of it, the moisture penetrates into the bud. What happens is you'll get bud
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.840]  rot, you get botrytis, you get powdery mildew. These things are the things that are really
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.360]  mildew. These things are in the air all over the place. But what happens is you'll get bud rot.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:33.120]  I've had these amazing colas that were literally this big. You go to grab them and you start
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.880]  messing with them a little bit and the top comes off and it's all rotted in the middle.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.160]  Maybe it wasn't the right region to grow in. Maybe you got some moisture in,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.320]  a little bit of rain, who knows? But open bud structure is super important for that reason.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:52.480]  Okay. We got,
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.540]  when deciding to breed, do you pick a male or female first? Is there a more important sex?
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:09.460]  Which sex is more? I would say male is more, it's not that there's one that's more important.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.660]  It's like saying men are more important than women or women are more important than men.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.900]  It's just not the case. They're both important. They both impart different things.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:23.140]  Typically males, as far as what you do is you to really do a selection of males is not like,
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.780]  that's the one you take that one and you put it on stuff and you test it out. And that's when you
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:33.380]  know it's the real one. You can use stuff like identifying traits that you have in mind that
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:39.620]  are going to work well. But that all happens in the plants actually mature. Males mature faster
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:44.900]  than females. So I guess you would be doing the males first, but it's not something that you
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:48.100]  would be doing the males first, but it's not something that they're just as important. One
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:53.460]  is just as important as the next. And really at the end of the day, quality genetics is on top of
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:58.340]  that is just as important too. Cause if you just buy seeds from anybody and you're reading shit,
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.900]  you're going to get shit as a result. Shit times shit equals more shit.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:09.060]  Ever seen the unicorn male that makes trikes and glands before
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.580]  blowing paw. I, I, nothing unicorn. I've seen that several times that you get some
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:20.500]  good girl scout cookies. Uh, not the girl scout cookies male, but the female man is just frigging
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.460]  super tricone heavy that we used to work with. And then, you know, girl scout cookies reverses
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:30.660]  real easily. But, uh, yeah. And that, cause that's, cause the intersexual traits are the less
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:35.940]  stable. It's interesting topic. I'm going a little bit off topic, but, um, stability, we're talking
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:41.540]  about stability and then we kind of went into intersexual traits. Well, stuff that's less stable,
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:47.140]  these complex polyhybrids are actually a lot easier to reverse. And so, you know, colloidal
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:52.740]  silver stress, all these things, a little bit of stress can reverse some stuff. Uh, humble seed
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:57.220]  company has a great cultivar called blueberry muffin. I don't know if you guys are familiar
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:03.620]  with it, but I really like it. It's interesting. And that thing is not stable, but it's great.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.460]  But man, you want to talk about a plant that reverses and looks beautiful and amazing.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.300]  Um, then you talk about something like blue dream. That's definitely like super stable
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:18.020]  that you have a harder time. And what happens is we're using ethylene blockers
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.460]  and these ethylene blockers being silver, colloidal silver, STS,
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:28.100]  uh, nano silver, all these different things. They, uh, they block the ethylene and basically
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.500]  force the, the, uh, female plant to become male. And then you have feminized pollen.
[01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:42.050]  Hold on. I was just looking, I have a bunch of packs of blueberry muffin. Uh,
[01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:47.930]  yeah, so I'm not really super skipped on all the different things I've seen other than the
[01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:55.050]  keeper, Fino, the one that we got, um, uh, you know, but that goes, yeah. And that's another
[01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:59.930]  interesting topic. I feel like, uh, if somebody sells a bunch of seeds, that doesn't mean you're
[01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:04.650]  going to get that one winner, but there's definitely a, for Fino hunting, you can find a
[01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:11.370]  lot of stuff. BBM number four is, uh, no, I don't think it's arguably the best cut on the market
[01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:15.930]  right now. Not even, not even though it's great, but then, you know, we're talking about stuff
[01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:21.130]  that's subjective. It's just like saying caviar is the best food. Blueberry muffins. Good. But
[01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:27.690]  okay. So I can tell you why it's not. It's because if you look at the price per pound of a blueberry
[01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:32.730]  muffin pound, we bring up and yield a lot. So if it was the best, everybody would be growing it.
[01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:37.370]  It yields a lot, but it's not nearly as good as some of these other rare exotics. You look at
[01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:42.730]  some snow Montana doesn't yield nearly as well, but that stuff will fetch, you know, that stuff,
[01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:51.050]  I believe, you know, goes for, you know, in the traditional, probably like a 4,500, 3,500,
[01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:55.770]  somewhere in between those two. And then even on the, the package, it's like those guys get top,
[01:26:55.770 --> 01:27:00.890]  top dollar for their stuff. The blueberry muffins not getting that. So to say it's arguably the best,
[01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:04.090]  I would tend to respectfully disagree with you on that.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:16.660]  Duraz, I just connected to you as Sir Lancelot, who has the unbreakable bong you seek via email.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:25.780]  So this is a super important question. Jane Doe wants to know, so you were talking cat piss before,
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.500]  what's the stinkiest strain Mr. Loud has on the market? So my whole neighborhood just
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.860]  reeks of herb and my neighbors want to come over when pandemic is over.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:42.580]  Let's see, the stinkiest strain I have on the market right now, I would say it's the GMO
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:47.700]  timespage and sour has a real funk to it. If you want like a BO sort of funk that kind of smells
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.420]  like armpits and dirty feet, you definitely get some of those phenotypes in there. And some people
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.980]  love it and some people hate it. It's kind of like the cat piss. I absolutely love the cat piss.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:01.860]  If I can find it, you know, everybody says they got it, prove it. You know, I would offer a thousand
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:08.020]  bucks up for anybody that can bring me the true cat piss cut. I mean, bring me some smoke. I'd be
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:14.340]  just totally blown away. DM me. I just, nobody has the cat piss anymore. It's gone. Even the people
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:20.100]  that I believe say that they have it, it's gone. It's cat piss. And the thing is, is so cat piss
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:25.140]  sounds disgusting, but it has an ammonia characteristic. It's like ammonia and skunk.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:31.460]  It's not really fuel-y, but it's really, it was really skunky. And really like a 10th of a gram,
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.180]  you know, like how big a 10th of a gram is. You could have it in your top pocket, in your coat,
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:40.260]  in your backpack. You go into your parents' house, because this was when I was a kid living at home,
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.580]  it's like everybody would smell it. You accidentally drop it in your car, you're smelling it for a
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:50.100]  week and you can't find it. Some of the terpene profiles we had back in the day were more intense.
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:56.580]  And, you know, I think there's flavonoids are probably the more correct term than just terpenes,
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:02.580]  because they could be chemical reactions and other things. And flavonoids that are actually
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:11.300]  putting off those scents. Okay, let me pull up Fat Rabbit's question. Give me one second.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:19.950]  And boom. So Fat Rabbit, I want to make F2s. Yep.
[01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:27.230]  Chosen a male, but can't decide. A few females, should I pollinate all of them or just make one
[01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:33.950]  or two choices? Depends on your space. Depends on, you know, I think make, I commend you on making
[01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:39.470]  F2s, man. I love it. I'm glad you're making F2s. Don't make F2s to sell. I don't know why these
[01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:45.550]  companies are selling F2s. I think making F2s in small amounts is great, you know. And, you know,
[01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:49.790]  the other thing you can do is have multiple, you could have two males. If you're not sure on the
[01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:53.550]  males, even you could take and you could pollinate half your plant with one poll and half with
[01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:59.550]  another. You can kind of go through your room and do that. But selecting one male and one female,
[01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:05.470]  if you're looking for, you know, if you think about your female as opposed to your male,
[01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:08.430]  your male is going to be here. Your female is going to be here in height.
[01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:15.070]  So what you're looking for is similar node spacing, similar leaf, like leaf pattern,
[01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:21.070]  leaf structure. The blades on the leaf are similar. You're going to look for
[01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:30.110]  stem rub, obviously, structure, vigor, them growing about the same, but yet the male is
[01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:34.110]  going to take off and be a little bit thinner and the females will be more girthy.
[01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:40.590]  You know, but there's nothing wrong with also saving stuff. And so you can revisit it if you
[01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:45.310]  don't get it right, being able to go back, having extra seeds so you can go back, you know, because
[01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:49.870]  the thing is, is like, there's been a lot of breeders and myself included where we've done
[01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:56.190]  IDLs. And the truth is, is we probably is not uncommon. Someone says catfish, I'm not talking
[01:30:56.190 --> 01:31:04.670]  about catfish. It's maybe an A5 is not uncommon. You can prove it to me. I'll give $1,000 to
[01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:10.350]  anybody that can bring me some real catfish like we have in the Bay area. Yeah. This guy's talking
[01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:15.550]  remember catfish back in the eighties and nineties. This is the one. And if you think you have it,
[01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:21.230]  send me a message. We can go smoke. If you have it and you have access to that clone,
[01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:28.190]  I will give you $1,000. Peter had a guy. Yeah, but see, okay. So this is back to,
[01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:32.590]  there's, there's everybody says they have catfish. Scott reach has a catfish. There's
[01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:36.510]  the catfish I'm looking for came from the Bay area in the early eighties and nineties.
[01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:41.950]  There's only one real catfish. I've gotten buds of catfish from at least 20 people over the last,
[01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:47.550]  you know, 15 years. And they've given me catfish buds or we smoke catfish together.
[01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:52.030]  And sometimes it might even smell like it. It has the amount, but then when you burn it,
[01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:56.830]  the true catfish, if you can't fire the roach up the next day and it still tastes like
[01:31:56.830 --> 01:32:01.710]  ammonia and skunk and real funky, it's not the real deal. The stuff we had was $60 an eighth.
[01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:04.990]  It looked like shit in the bag. Literally it looked like garbage,
[01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:10.830]  little shreds in the bottom of the bag and you could take it and you, you smoke it. There was
[01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:15.470]  nothing like it, you know? And it's like, still, I could tell, I could tell it from one thing to
[01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:21.070]  another. You could bring me stuff. I can tell you if it's the real catfish. Yeah. And so used to
[01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:25.070]  have, you know, someone got kicked out of bars for having a sealed bag in your pocket. That's
[01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:31.630]  how catfish was. I mean, it was foul too. So what else we got Pete?
[01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:41.390]  So hold on. We got a, so key lime pie backyard asked is inbreeding the same as back as an
[01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:44.670]  inbreed and back cross or they, they mean the same thing.
[01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:51.630]  No, no, no. Backcrossing. You think if you're putting it back on itself, no,
[01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:58.430]  backcrossing BXN cubing is another term for it. What you're doing with that is you're,
[01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:04.030]  you're breeding towards one parent. Whereas inbreeding is you're breeding that same line
[01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:09.630]  down, which is IBL and inbred line. So with the IBL, you're breeding for the same thing.
[01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:14.350]  And then with a back cross, what you're doing is you're taking and making a cross. So you're taking
[01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:19.550]  a plus B, whether it's donor receiver, you're taking it and then you're putting B back on a,
[01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:24.430]  because you're breeding for that specific plant, whether it's for the structure of the terpenes,
[01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:28.590]  whatever trait you're going for, you're trying to reinforce those traits. And that's what you're
[01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:32.750]  doing within inbreeding too, but it's just a different process because instead of breeding
[01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:39.150]  within that cross you're breeding back on the parent. Now you can do a BX three, BX four.
[01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:45.950]  And as you keep doing it, you're, you're basically trying to outbreed one of the plants. I mean,
[01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:51.150]  that's one way technically, you know, if we're talking about, you wanted to make a sour diesel
[01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:57.070]  seed, which nobody's done before, because I tried and I failed. And I think there's a lot of people
[01:33:57.070 --> 01:34:03.550]  we have BXs. I was the original BXer with my partner. We did a seven, a sour where we were
[01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:08.350]  trying to make sour diesel seeds. That was really our intention. We had tried to do some feminized
[01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:13.870]  stuff, but BXing is a process that you do to reinforce traits of one of the parents.
[01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:20.670]  If you are trying to do traditional IBLs, an inbred line is the combination of genetics,
[01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:25.150]  selecting those traits, and then inbreeding those through generations to have a stable line.
[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:26.590]  That's what that is.
[01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:34.510]  As, as people are reminiscing, vape, a misses Northern lights from 97.
[01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:41.230]  Yeah. Yeah. The NL was good, man. And you know, it's like, I believe, you know, I've heard all
[01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:48.910]  kinds of stories, but I honestly believe that cat piss came from an A5, regardless of the stories
[01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:52.110]  and the, you know, whatever the hell's angels are the ones that lost it. They got in a gunfight with
[01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:58.190]  the police in early 2000s and they lost their cut of it. And they were the last ones with it.
[01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:02.030]  Unfortunately, we didn't have tissue culture and cool stuff like that.
[01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:10.350]  Watching James Lachow is detrimental to my stash. As I keep rolling more and more joints,
[01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:15.630]  fascinated by weed talk. Awesome. That's what it's all about, man. I enjoy doing this. I'm
[01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:19.630]  going to keep doing it until it's not fun anymore. So you guys are tuning in. This is great.
[01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:27.150]  When growing meals separately to collect the pollen, how long do you need to run it in flower
[01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:32.910]  to use get usable pollen? The initial poem that comes off is usable, but you know, you, I would
[01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:40.990]  say it's so all of this is cultivar dependent. All this is, you know, certain plants, they start
[01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:47.790]  kicking flower. You know, it depends on if you're going from seed or from clone. So if you flip it
[01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:55.310]  from clone, you know, these plants, they start opening pollen up, but that's why you like, I
[01:35:55.310 --> 01:36:00.670]  also like starting my stuff like a week before sometimes. So if I'm using my donors or my mail,
[01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:04.110]  that's going to, I'm going to start a week before. So like week three and a half, but they'll
[01:36:04.110 --> 01:36:08.030]  continue to kick on pollen and that poem later on, you know, we kind of talked about it on the show
[01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:13.070]  before and touched on it, that pollen, you know, later on, you're getting more pollen. What you
[01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:17.230]  really want is a good dump. So I don't even really try to touch my plants or flip my plants or take
[01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:22.830]  pollen until there's a good amount of pollen, but like on a 70 day cultivar, you know, week, week,
[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:27.310]  four, week, four and a half, sometimes is where you get that real big hit upon, or if you hit the
[01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:33.230]  plant, the dust just flies and that dust will fly across. You can hit from one side of the other
[01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:38.510]  and you'll just see this cloud of pollen. And you know, it's a, you know, it's just hitting on all
[01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:42.670]  those things. And you know, it's like such a small amount of pollen will go a far way.
[01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:51.230]  Can you talk about more, can you talk more about the different generations, please? F1, F2,
[01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:57.550]  differences between them. Thanks. Yes. F1, F2. Like if you guys are getting into breeding,
[01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:06.430]  this is super important. F1, a true F1. Yeah, this is great. You basically have two stable lines,
[01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:11.470]  two inbred lines, you know, a lot of land-raised stuff that has, you know, if we're talking about
[01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:18.190]  land-raised stuff that has multiple generations that has, we're talking about homozygosity. So
[01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:22.670]  something that's homozygous means that it has no phenotypical variation. Something that
[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:30.270]  that is heterozygous has phenotypical variation that, you know, depending on how many lines it's
[01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:34.910]  been bred with, you know, there's a lot of phenotypical variation. And so what we're
[01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:39.470]  talking about with a true F1, you know, we use the term loosely and I'll explain that in a second,
[01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:44.910]  but a true F1 is two lines that are brought together, you know, and then what that does
[01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:51.230]  is it adds heterosis and you get typically within your progeny and the progeny is the seeds. So
[01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:58.590]  we're talking about stuff that is 50% in the middle and then 25% leaning towards both parents.
[01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:04.750]  And this is just Mendelian genetics. So this is basically what you get in, you know, sometimes
[01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:09.390]  traits are more apparent and more dominant. And then we have stuff that's also more recessive.
[01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:19.150]  So that's what a true F1 is. Now, if we're talking about a F1 hybrid, you know, F1 complex polyhybrid,
[01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:24.750]  that's something with multiple lines. So what happens is if you take that F1 and you put it
[01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:31.870]  together with another F1 before you've stabilized it, now you have what's called an F1 polyhybrid,
[01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:37.790]  right? And so you introduce that one more time to some different stuff. Poly, you have more than
[01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:42.670]  five lines and it's a complex polyhybrid. And what that does is you have genetics all over the
[01:38:42.670 --> 01:38:47.630]  place. Doesn't mean that it's not going to be great. You're not going to find winners. You're
[01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:53.790]  not going to have stable, stable, stable genetics and the fed not, not hermaphrodites, but stuff
[01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:59.470]  that within the progeny is going to blow off a whole bunch of different phenotypes, right? And so
[01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:07.550]  now we have this F1, this F1 hybrid, this F1 complex polyhybrid. Now, how do we stabilize
[01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:13.310]  that? And so the trick with that is taking two plants, crossing them back together and doing
[01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:19.070]  selections. Now, what I was talking about earlier with the 50%, and this is Mendelian genetics,
[01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:24.590]  you can look it up. It applies to genetics. Just general genetics is very genetic, basic genetic
[01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:30.750]  principle. You get 50% with the F1s. It's in the middle, 25% that lean towards each parent. So that
[01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:36.670]  makes the a hundred percent. Now with the F2 generation, what that does is with those gene
[01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:43.470]  pairs, that's when you get the recessive traits. So F2 is actually the hardest and the easiest,
[01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:48.910]  depending on what you're looking for to do the selections. That's where you find the most
[01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:54.190]  interesting stuff. And so that's where the real magic begins with breeding and pheno hunting.
[01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:59.550]  You'll get stuff that's not great. A lot of the stuff in F2s, like I don't like selling F2s.
[01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:07.230]  I've never been, I don't think I've ever sold F2s other than maybe one time in my whole life.
[01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:12.750]  F2s, I have a stash of F2s, but F2s is where you get the recessive traits.
[01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:17.950]  Right. And so with those recessive traits, then you look for stuff that's similar. So you find a
[01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:23.550]  male and female that have those recessive traits. And with each generation, now we're talking F3,
[01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:29.230]  you breed those two together. You're looking for either what you found in the F1 or something
[01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:33.310]  recessive that you found in the F2. And you're breeding specifically for that, trying to find
[01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:39.390]  those things. Now with genomics, it's really easy to identify because we can test the genotype.
[01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:44.350]  All right. So if you're able to test the genotype and you're able to drive your breeding with
[01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:50.030]  markers, then that's a whole different thing. But DJ Short and a lot of these guys, they've
[01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:57.950]  been doing it for years. We do it with the estimated guesses and basically just from
[01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:03.790]  learning how plants work and learning those cultivars, you breed towards those goals. And so
[01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:09.470]  each time you find that your progeny will be more stable. In fact, less phenotypical variation,
[01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:15.790]  we're talking about homozygosity again. So each generation gets more stable. You can breed in
[01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:22.510]  seven generations a fairly stable line. You keep on going back past that, it gets weaker and weaker.
[01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:29.150]  So another thing I want to touch on with the F1 is S1. So S1 is a self. So if we're talking about
[01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:36.270]  selfing, selfing is a super important tool when you're making feminized seeds. And this is one
[01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:43.550]  of the biggest things with reinforcing and reinforcing or actually reducing the amount
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:48.110]  of intersexual traits because we're talking about traits again. So selfing is the big thing because
[01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:53.310]  you have gene pairs on both of the parents. Now when you cross and you self, so we're going to
[01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:57.470]  take stuff, we're going to put it on itself, right? For instance, we're going to reverse the pollen on
[01:41:58.510 --> 01:42:03.230]  name your favorite strain, blueberry muffin, best strain in the world. We're going to take that,
[01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:08.270]  we're going to reverse it, we're going to put it on itself to make an S1. Actually, that would,
[01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:13.790]  yeah, so that would be an S1. So that S1, you're getting rid of 50% of the alleles and alleles are
[01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:20.910]  genes, right? So by putting on itself, you're actually basically getting rid of 50% of the
[01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:25.470]  alleles. So if you're breeding towards something like homozygosity, where you want to breed a
[01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:29.790]  stable line, you can actually achieve that faster through selfing. Now there's some other issues
[01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:36.350]  that come into play with selfing. But the biggest, the biggest problem with selfing is if you don't
[01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:41.870]  have something that has, if you don't have something that's stable in the sense of intersexual
[01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:46.270]  traits, if you have something that has lots of problems with hermaphrodites, it gets a little
[01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:52.110]  stressed out, it pops bananas. Well, you put that on itself or if it's even recessive, and you don't
[01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:56.270]  see it, but the second you put it on itself, now you have a problem. Then your progeny is going to
[01:42:56.270 --> 01:43:01.870]  have hermaphrodites. You could have, you know, bananas, whatever you, those bananas that it had
[01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:06.270]  occasionally, now you got problems with bananas. So you want to make sure that when you're selfing,
[01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:11.790]  you're working with strong genetics that have low intersexual traits. Now, sometimes that may
[01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:18.270]  require inbreeding to reduce it and then selfing. So there's all kinds of different approaches.
[01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:22.670]  You know, I, I use the term there's, there's so many different ways to skin a cat.
[01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:29.070]  There's, there's not one perfect way to do all this. There's basic principles. And, you know,
[01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:34.510]  it's, you, you make your own, your own roadmap and you go through these and it takes years kind
[01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:40.110]  of to develop what your breeding program is and what kind of approach, but there's no, I mean,
[01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:44.030]  the wrong way to do it is just to polish it. But other than that, if you start applying,
[01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:51.550]  you know, if you start applying data, if you start applying principles, like principles and technique,
[01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:56.190]  I mean, those are, those are great ways to get going with breeding and also test, test, test.
[01:43:57.630 --> 01:44:03.470]  What else do we got? Okay. We got all sorts of stuff. I think people want to like the,
[01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:12.590]  uh, the, uh, three stooges 24 hour marathon back in the day, they want a 24 hour James
[01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:15.150]  Loud answering questions marathon. I don't do that at all.
[01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:23.870]  So pistachio farms picked up a pack of gluado. He says, thank you. We'll get those shipped out.
[01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:30.350]  We'd love to put your picks up on the show. Uh, anybody that sends picks and you, you have the
[01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:35.390]  flower from seed you bought for me, any of the lines or any of the collaboration projects I've
[01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:47.310]  done, please. So, uh, we have a whole bunch of, um, just people asking about stuff, uh, like
[01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:56.190]  Bubba 76. And then someone else asked about, no, I was on the show though. You know, I'm a big
[01:44:56.910 --> 01:45:02.190]  bubble fan. So there was, there was some interesting strains that were going around in
[01:45:02.190 --> 01:45:08.510]  the late nineties, early 2000s, along with like the leaders, which were the chem dog, the sour,
[01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:13.710]  and the LG back then there was also bubble cushion map master coach. And there was a phenotype called
[01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:25.470]  the Henry Kissinger, the HK, which was a just ridiculous master coach. Um, yeah. So, uh,
[01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:29.870]  pre 98 bubble was just a, it was a winner and that was an exotic back then. I mean,
[01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:35.230]  that was what we considered exotic. That stuff was going for top, top dollar. Same thing with
[01:45:35.230 --> 01:45:39.630]  that master coach. The master coach was kind of floating around the LA scene quite a bit.
[01:45:39.630 --> 01:45:43.630]  And they had this interesting branching, like kind of like a Christmas tree branch where,
[01:45:43.630 --> 01:45:48.030]  you know, like, uh, one of those, not the Douglas first, but one, like the silver tips where they
[01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:52.110]  branch out. And then they, the, basically the Calix actually kind of pop off and there's
[01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:56.990]  interesting bud structure where the, the Calix kind of shoot out of the side. It looks like a
[01:45:56.990 --> 01:46:02.830]  little Christmas tree, but, uh, I missed that one. That's another one. Find me. You got that.
[01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:08.750]  Let's go smoke it. And then, uh, someone asked about the green grapes from Sacramento.
[01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:15.950]  I'm not familiar with green grapes. Yeah. There was a strange, yeah, there's a, there's a great
[01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:23.150]  GDP, big discussion of what's what two different, totally different plants. Anybody wants to argue
[01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:26.510]  it, we can argue it all day. I used to grow a great faith and I used to grow GDP.
[01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:31.310]  What we have is Ken's GDP, which was a super dark, smaller plant that would take forever to
[01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:37.630]  bench. And then we had this monster grape, a plant, um, obviously the one, yeah,
[01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:41.550]  really early in the chat, someone, when you were talking about, you know, uh,
[01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:44.750]  stuff coming from the Bay area, someone mentioned GDP.
[01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:50.670]  Oh yeah. GDP, Ken Estes. You know, I had a Eric from dungeon vault. That's how we met was at Ken's
[01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:56.990]  booth when I grabbed some guy for trying to steal my logo. So that's Ken Estes's memory of me. I'm
[01:46:56.990 --> 01:47:02.190]  sure like they grabbed the guy and yelled and like had everybody with their mouths open. He was a
[01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:09.390]  little kid. I was probably 30 and he was probably 16 or 17. I didn't hit him. Didn't do anything.
[01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:14.110]  I was pissed. That's funny. Uh, and then here's another one for you.
[01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:22.350]  Tom Hill times 18 Pakistani. I don't know. I, you know, Tom Hill rest in peace, man. Um,
[01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:29.150]  I believe Tom Hill passed earlier. The time just flies by, but Tom Hill has definitely done
[01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:33.950]  amazing stuff. Um, you know, Casey Burns, way of North Mills and they're all part of the,
[01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:41.710]  we're part of the same collective up there. Yeah. Casey Burns, big shout out to him, uh,
[01:47:41.710 --> 01:47:46.670]  from sticky farms. Those guys grow kill. They grow the really good stuff. They've got the Pluto and
[01:47:47.710 --> 01:47:54.110]  Pablo and Casey is just really good guys. So I got a pre-nanny bubble coach times Appalachia
[01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:58.990]  called tiger's milk by Bodhi. See, yeah. Bodhi's got some fire, man. I'm, you know, another shout
[01:47:58.990 --> 01:48:05.230]  out to Bodhi. Bodhi's got some good stuff. Uh, his mother's milk and he's got tiger's milk. I'm
[01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:11.710]  a big, I haven't seen the tiger's milk. I should definitely get in touch about the, I heard he has
[01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:17.790]  a female that's very similar to cactus GDP that I had about eight years ago. Yeah. GDP, you know,
[01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:22.350]  I've seen it. People still have the cut. It's not, it's not rare. And it would actually come
[01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:27.470]  back to the problem is nobody wants to grow it commercially because it's a small, small plant.
[01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:32.590]  You know, if we're talking about stuff, it's edges really slow. I used to vege it for 31 days.
[01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:38.670]  You know, whereas other stuff, my sour diesel, I would have edge for with, with CO2. When I was
[01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:44.030]  growing sour diesel, I would vege that for two and a half weeks max. So sour diesel will double
[01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:49.310]  and sometimes go two and a half times the size once you flip them into flour. So you've got to
[01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:56.710]  be really aware of those kinds of things. I'd love to own some gluonocetes. It's that simple.
[01:48:56.790 --> 01:49:01.990]  Dagadah love. You want to get some seeds? Go buy them at Dagadah love. We got plenty of seeds.
[01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:07.510]  Do we have any auto flowers over there too? I think we might even have one auto flower variety.
[01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:13.910]  I, I, I got to put it up. But yeah, that'll, that'll be up. We'll get that up after the show.
[01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:20.390]  Perfect. Yeah. Someone mentioned Alaskan Thunderfuck.
[01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:24.470]  Yeah. That and Nuska and the Thunderfuck were amazing. I don't know. Like,
[01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:32.470]  those are real nostalgic streams for me. Same thing, Maui Waui. Real Maui Waui was this velvety
[01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:36.150]  bud. We used to get in the Bay Area and we used to pay 60 bucks for an eighth and it was like this
[01:49:36.150 --> 01:49:42.390]  neon color green. We'd get big chunky buds that were like, they're big chunky buds and they were
[01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:48.230]  velvety and like they, they, I think they kind of, we didn't get them cured out super. They were
[01:49:48.230 --> 01:49:53.750]  super fresh. They were flown in and $60 an eighth for this stuff. But man, it fucking got you high.
[01:49:53.750 --> 01:50:00.630]  This stuff was, it was no joke and it tasted amazing. Yeah. It was a silky smoke and I'm,
[01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:05.990]  I'm big on those. I mean, I haven't, I haven't smoked real Maui Waui in a long time either.
[01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:18.320]  That's another one that fantastic. So yeah, that's a great question right there. Does seed
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.040]  production require intense light like regular flower production or can you use less intense?
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.240]  I feel like the intensity is such a, it's an interesting thing. Canopy size is super important.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.720]  You know, I've bred for many years using 600 watts and I feel kind of that's what the,
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:45.200]  the LEDs, most of them are like that 630 as far as watts. There's nothing wrong with using 600
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.920]  or those. Do you get more seeds if you use a thousand? If your plants are bigger, you do.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.640]  But also you get smaller seeds. The more intense the lights, the smaller the seeds get.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:00.880]  So if you're using a thousand watts as opposed to using the sun, for instance, then you're going to
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:05.280]  get bigger seeds out in the sun, smaller seeds because the calyx swell up and so the seeds can't
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:12.640]  expand as much, I believe. So there's, there's like, that's another one. There are several ways
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.840]  to skin a cat. They all work. Canopy size is super important with seeds. So fill in,
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:24.800]  filling up your canopy. East coast headband, but it's, it's old, but still kicks ass. I like
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:29.520]  anything headband that's good is probably, you know, anything hippie like that, man. I love,
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.920]  I love headband. Good headband. It's funny because headband is one of those ones. Like there's so
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:38.080]  many different headbands. You're talking about the headband that was a re renamed Oji Kishka.
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.240]  You're talking about the East coast headband. You're talking about the headband that like,
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.520]  DNA genetics have a headband. That's the seven Oh seven times the sour diesel that
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.920]  shit's fire too. I really liked the one that we want to cup with, which was the,
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.080]  which was the renamed Oji Kishka that we were told lies about by one of our friends.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:01.280]  Won't go into that right now, but we had, we had told people it was something else,
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.960]  but the truth is, is it was a chunky Oji Kishka that was from Josh D and Mojave.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.840]  I have a few Thunderfuck varieties. I played not 15 years have pops over
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.440]  waiting for spring on them. Yeah. Yeah. What, what do you have that, you know,
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.560]  it's almost, it's like stuff. I mean, you can only do so much every year and stuff that you
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:30.400]  loved, but you know, just don't have the time right now or. Oh, I got thousands.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.560]  Right. I literally have thousands of varieties, not having had millions of seeds, but
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.680]  thousands of varieties of different stuff. And like, I just don't, there's, there's not enough
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:45.600]  time in the year. I have some Acapulco gold, uh, hybrid seeds and some, some true.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:51.120]  Oh, we use. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you were talking about a while ago, right?
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.920]  Yeah. Casey Burns was talking about it too. And, uh, you know, I have friends back in the day
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.040]  where you put the stuff in the top of it and roll it up, you put it over and then open it and shake
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:13.010]  it. Yeah. That's awesome. Easy money. Easy money. As they say, keeping turf profile, but changing
[01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:19.170]  growth structure and bigger. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's, it's the thing is, is like, is your turf
[01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:25.090]  profile recessive? There's a, there's questions you got to ask yourself if your turf profile is
[01:53:25.090 --> 01:53:33.810]  recessive. Um, you know, I think you got to do some searching, looking for it in the F2, uh,
[01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:39.890]  is, is ideal. You're not necessarily going to find it in the F1 sometimes. So that things like OG
[01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:46.130]  Kush, that's her profile could be elusive. Gas can be elusive. And the way to do it is to
[01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:51.890]  use larger progenies when you're doing your selections, uh, also looking forward to the F2
[01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:58.770]  and then trying to stabilize it. Uh, you know, I think structures in vigor is so important now,
[01:53:58.770 --> 01:54:06.610]  especially on a commercial ag aspect. Um, these things need to be considered. Obviously yield and
[01:54:06.610 --> 01:54:11.410]  vigor is super important and you can reinforce those, but yeah, using, doing your selections
[01:54:11.410 --> 01:54:15.010]  with bigger progenies, it really depends on if you're just trying to make a seed where they're
[01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:20.130]  all, they all have gas or you need gas and just one where you're doing a selection. Um,
[01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:22.450]  so many different possibilities.
[01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:33.990]  Give me one second. I just had something queued up. Uh,
[01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:42.990]  so Chris, I think either Chris asked us a while ago or someone else asked it, but just, uh,
[01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:44.590]  since you, you know, the area.
[01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:52.750]  I do. What would you grow in Sacramento Valley with? It can't get to,
[01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:59.870]  I think it can get right. Yeah. It should be where it can get to 110 days, 10 days of the
[01:54:59.870 --> 01:55:05.310]  year and above 95. The rest, what would be the best genetics to grow outdoors? Thank you. Well,
[01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:12.110]  the problem is, is above 105, almost all cultivars was shut down. Um, you don't want them to go above
[01:55:12.110 --> 01:55:16.430]  105. So I would say tomatoes are the best thing to grow. You know, I think there's other vegetables.
[01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:20.510]  If you're going for yourself, I mean, being able to move them indoors or putting shade cloths up,
[01:55:21.150 --> 01:55:28.030]  uh, those things you want to consider, um, something like a blue dream will grow really
[01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:32.830]  well in an environment like that. It's going to be nice and dry over there. Um, you know,
[01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:37.150]  some of these cultivars, like, you know, not that everybody's a fan of blue dream.
[01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:40.750]  There's probably a lot of other stuff. Uh, amnesia haze might work.
[01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:46.510]  Um, that I think those are, those are pretty accessible. Marlon and I have some tropical
[01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:50.830]  stuff that I think might work well in those instances that we'll probably have on for
[01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:58.110]  black Friday. So, uh, stay posted and, uh, yeah, you, your seeds might be there on a black Friday
[01:55:58.110 --> 01:56:12.160]  coming up in five days. Dagger.love. Yep. I think you're okay. What is the best clone gel or hormone?
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.360]  So, so just, how about you just generally your cloning strategies? Like, are you dipping them
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.920]  in something? And, uh, yeah, you know, it's like everybody has that. They all work to a degree. Um,
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:31.440]  clone X is basic and simple. You know, it's like I grew up, you know, before all this shit. So,
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.440]  you know, I don't know if you guys know, but people didn't necessarily use cloning gel back
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  in the day. You know, that maybe late nineties, it was a thing, but you can clone, um, without it,
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:47.120]  just, uh, basically using your tray, using a controlled environment. You know,
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:54.560]  you don't need to use domes. Aloe plant juice is awesome. Um, there, there's so many different
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.920]  products that you can use it as long as it works. I mean, I think clinics is the most basic and
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:02.080]  simple and straightforward. It's super easy. Just make sure you're not dipping it in the bottle.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:06.880]  You're pouring it into something like a shot glass and dipping it. Um, yeah. And I've always
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.200]  cloned in rock wool, but there's so many other mediums you can use as well. Rockwell is just
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.840]  pretty straightforward. Uh, yeah, I, I, I actually, I, I haven't used clone X in a long time.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:24.800]  I just stopped. Clone X is poison. You know, it's, it's personal preference. You don't have
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:30.560]  to use clinics. Aloe gel. You know, that's a great one. Yeah. We have a lot of aloe, uh,
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:39.660]  comments. Greg McAllister, what are you using? We'll get a,
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:48.700]  uh, yeah. Chris said he's a victim of autocorrect. He did mean Ken where it can get to 110. Um,
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:58:00.790]  okay. Hold on. Uh, Ace Boogie asked when beginning as a breeder, what type of S
[01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:06.390]  standard operating procedures did you neglect? Like what do you do now as a standard operating
[01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:14.150]  procedure that when you first started, uh, washed my hands all the time. Uh, you know, I think
[01:58:14.150 --> 01:58:17.590]  there's so many different little things, you know, I was breeding in a time where it was
[01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:23.350]  not as scientific. It was very hippy dippy. Uh, you know, I grew up grateful dead fan.
[01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:31.110]  My, my crew is all about the dead. Um, SOPs are super important now. I mean, it's all about
[01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:35.350]  operating procedures, regardless of what you're doing. If you're trying to do it to scale
[01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:40.470]  and do it as a business and even like consulting. So I work as a consultant
[01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:46.950]  setting up SOPs is super important. Um, one that I will tell you guys that I think is probably the
[01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:51.590]  most important and overlooked thing right now. And this goes back to even the cloning that we're
[01:58:51.590 --> 01:58:56.870]  kind of just talking about is using clean tools that are sanitized with bleach or something that
[01:58:56.870 --> 01:59:02.950]  will actually kill viroids. Hoplite and virus that it's not even hoplite virus. Hoplite viroid
[01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:07.510]  is something that is going to be a big problem for us. It's already a big problem for us. A lot
[01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:12.390]  of cultivars are infected and nobody knew it. It's been around for a long time. And we were
[01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:16.070]  talking about sour diesel earlier. That's kind of where it started to my knowledge,
[01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:21.190]  at least expressing itself. And it doesn't always express it doesn't have on one plant.
[01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:25.910]  It might express on half of the plant and not on the other half. Some super happy, healthy plants,
[01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:30.710]  it doesn't express it all the way you can stop, you know, and you can, you can, two plants can
[01:59:30.710 --> 01:59:35.830]  touch each other. You can get hoplite and passed on like that, but using dirty tools, that's the
[01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:41.670]  best way for hoplite and virus. So wear gloves, wear gloves in your room, whether you're using a
[01:59:41.670 --> 01:59:49.030]  exacto or whatever, make sure they're, they're clean between each, each plant. So I think those
[01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:57.550]  things are important. That's the biggest one. A bunch of stuff. Someone was back on the Sacramento.
[01:59:58.590 --> 02:00:07.950]  Just started indoors in December outside in March. Yeah, that's awesome. Jack Doe. Good job. Yeah,
[02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:12.590]  I think starting in December, you know, I kind of I have plants in the ground year round because I
[02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:17.470]  was curious as to what you know, I don't have big plants right now. But I have some small plants. I
[02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:25.630]  got this 43 day cultivar that I'm kind of working on. That's super purple anyway. And so I figured
[02:00:25.630 --> 02:00:30.350]  I'd just do a little quick run and make some seeds with it and see what pops off. So we reversed it.
[02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:35.070]  And we also have it as a receiver on some of this stuff. So I'm selfing it and I'm doing some
[02:00:35.070 --> 02:00:39.710]  interesting things, but it has all the qualities of a good gelato. And it finishes in 43 days. So
[02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:44.750]  we'll I'm hoping to have seeds of that and also some auto seeds. We're going to do auto line with
[02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:48.750]  it, which that takes forever, but we'll have those eventually. And then I'll probably have
[02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:55.310]  some gelato crosses or gelato seeds of it something similar within the next six to eight months.
[02:00:57.710 --> 02:01:02.350]  And Chris, who is in the Sacramento area who asked that question,
[02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:10.270]  shade cloth. What type of shade cloth would you use? You can use something basic. There's all
[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:14.350]  kinds of different materials. I would just go to your growth shop and wherever you buy your
[02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:22.430]  stuff from and talk to them about or even like if you have any big ag shops around that,
[02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:26.750]  Sacramento has all kinds of stuff, but you just want something basic to keep the shade. It doesn't
[02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:33.390]  have to be greenhouse material necessarily. And keeping fans on your plants when they're hot like
[02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:38.510]  that and just the basic material. You could have like a basic greenhouse that has over the top,
[02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:43.470]  just the shade cloth on the walls and have it open so you can blow the air right through.
[02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:49.070]  It depends on your scale too. What are you doing? You could just, if you have one plant,
[02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:56.510]  you could just move it into a cooler environment in the shade or under lights. I mean, it's really
[02:01:56.510 --> 02:02:02.670]  tough growing outdoors when you have variables. And maybe even as a tip, if you want to start
[02:02:02.670 --> 02:02:07.470]  breeding, making your own seeds and breeding outdoors every year, get your seeds acclimated.
[02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:11.390]  You can acclimate a variety. Let's say you find something you like, you could just make seeds,
[02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:16.670]  selfing it, or you could buy a regular pack of seeds and make seeds each generation. And every
[02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:26.160]  generation will become more acclimated to that environment. This was a little misworded question.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:37.420]  Let's see if we can. In testing, do you run seeds on top, take clones and further look into the
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:43.820]  pressure? I do numerous things and I also do stress testing. And so, but like as far as topping,
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:48.620]  I like to see what plants do on their own, but I also, it depends on what you're breeding for.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:54.380]  And if you're breeding for sea green type canopy, yeah, I mean, I would say you definitely want to
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:03:00.380]  top your plants because you're going to do it regardless. If you're growing for complete
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:05.660]  canopies where you're looking for 45 tops per square meter or whatever you're doing,
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.180]  you definitely want to top the plant. But now if you're growing for outdoor, I love seeing what
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:15.100]  the plants just do on their own because some of them will branch out, it'll grow up like
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:20.540]  Christmas trees, other will branch out and they just get super wide. Some plants just naturally
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:26.460]  grow like their top domes. So it just really depends on what your goals are and what you're
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:32.220]  doing. All right, let's make this the home stretch, the last two or three questions. We have
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:40.460]  your seed testers. What are your expectations? You know, my seed testers, a lot of times,
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:45.740]  I'm pretty loose with it. I want good growers to grow my seeds and do it their way.
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:50.460]  Grow journals are great. I'm not usually typically looking for their grow journals.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:57.980]  And most of my friends test them and they're tested on large scale stuff too. So we're testing
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:03.500]  large numbers of them. I give them out to companies too that are popping them and seeing how they
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:08.700]  perform. But yeah, I mean, I think those things are important for you. For my testers, I don't
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:13.100]  have people that test my stuff typically that don't grow amazing cannabis. I feel like you're
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:19.580]  not getting the full expression of the plant. I give away seeds to people time to time that
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:25.420]  want to grow them. But as far as actual testers, we're testing stuff in different environments.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:30.780]  So we're testing stuff under HPS, LED. We're testing stuff with rockwool as opposed to cocoa
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:38.060]  or soil. If I'm breeding for outdoor stuff, we're doing outdoor testing. You do your testing for
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:42.780]  your environment. So if you're breeding stuff that's going to be used outdoors, you should
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:48.700]  test it outdoors. If you're breeding stuff for indoors that is going to be used large scale
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.060]  in rockwool, you should probably grow it in rockwool if you're doing your testing, if you want
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:05:03.040]  to get the results that yield similar to what you tested. We have a... This was... We can add a
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:11.120]  feminized line, right? And an auto. The glue auto is feminized. Oh, it is feminized. It is, yeah.
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:17.520]  All right. I would say 90% of what I do is feminized seeds. I do that for commercial
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.800]  viability because the thing is, is it's nice. You got these... A lot of home growers that want to
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.240]  buy seeds and that's cool. And that would be fine for regular seeds. But on a large scale,
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:33.120]  I'm trying to produce seeds that are going to be for acres or I work with companies that they
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:37.280]  have acres. They want me to help them produce seeds for acres. And how that works is you got
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.960]  to have feminized seeds. No one wants to separate the males. So a lot of what I do is try... I try
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:49.520]  to create good, stable stuff that can be... You can produce an acre, you can produce five acres,
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:57.230]  10 acres and get good results. We can wrap on this one.
[02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:05.710]  The mystery machine. Juicy fruit times mystery. So those ones are real interesting.
[02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:11.950]  We call it the mystery because those are donors from my backyard. They're just...
[02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:18.430]  They're volunteers that came up. We know the juicy fruit. But as far as what the actual donor is,
[02:06:19.070 --> 02:06:25.470]  I don't know. We had volunteers, they were made... Those were the ones that were the freebies that
[02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:31.070]  you're referring to. Terpene profile. You should get some amazing fruity stuff out of it. Those
[02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:38.430]  are regular seeds. Big Mike gets a glory shot. He was the one who asked the last question.
[02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:45.710]  Oh, nice. Yeah. So they were made in my backyard two summers ago. I always... I do small breeding
[02:06:46.670 --> 02:06:52.830]  projects all over. And those ones are... Yeah. All my auto flowers, everything I made auto flower
[02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:58.750]  in my whole life, I've never made a regular auto flower. So if you've ever seen stuff from me,
[02:06:58.750 --> 02:07:03.310]  it's going to be feminized as far as auto flowers. But going back to the mystery machine,
[02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:07.470]  you're going to get some fruit terps. You'll get some bubblegum fruity terps, hopefully.
[02:07:07.710 --> 02:07:18.640]  Good plant structure. A lot of heterosis with that one. So I guess that's it.
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:26.800]  I mean, we could... I mean, I have there like 50 more questions, but I figure we can save it. I
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:34.400]  think every couple episodes, we can just do the mailbag. Yeah. Can we get a vote on the
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:40.480]  mailbag idea? I mean, of the 500 and something people still tuned in two hours in.
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:48.400]  500 people? Okay. I'm really excited about all this as far as like, yeah, I had a lot of fun
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:53.600]  today. It's usually... I do a lot of these interviews. I give these guys questions in
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:59.280]  advance just so you guys know how I operate. I think a lot of shows, people shoot the shit and
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:03.360]  they talk. Well, I like getting technical guys on and I want to make sure they have
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:07.680]  technical questions that they can think about beforehand. So I'm not catching them off guard.
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:14.480]  I've done that before. But I like having technical people on the show. And so this is kind of fun
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.840]  where we're just talking and hanging out. This is fun for me. So I hope you guys all had a great
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:25.040]  show. What's the consensus, Peter? Oh my God. That was...
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:37.120]  Yeah. So yeah, this is kind of what we did. We had some, I mean, by in advance, it was like 15
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:43.360]  minutes before showtime. But yeah, I've been pulling real time questions in. I've been pulling
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:51.200]  questions that were asked on the Discord on... I didn't even check Instagram. But anyway,
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:58.560]  the questions are coming from all over the place. Alex says, first time watching. It's been
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:08.000]  brilliant. Love listening to James. He is so knowledgeable. Paul likes the mailbag idea.
[02:09:13.150 --> 02:09:23.920]  Let's see what else. They like our flow as I'm rapidly trying to queue shit up.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:32.960]  So yeah. All right. So we have Sir Lancelot is going to get Duraz Base his bong. James,
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:44.320]  we will check the Discord to see if any or who got closest on the... Can you hold that bag up again?
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:45.440]  It's a mailbag.
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:53.580]  And that's of what?
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:57.180]  Some auto-flowers he's been doing.
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:07.420]  Got it. And so we may... Friday, if we do something, what time of day works best for you?
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:12.700]  I don't know. We got to think about it. Probably same time, 11 in the morning.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:19.660]  We'll let everyone know. And then someone made a guess in the YouTube. Let me send you... Here's
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:26.220]  the breeding Discord. So just put your guess in on that link. Not here, because I'm not going to
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:39.500]  watch two and a half hours of this video just to see people's guesses. Yeah. What?
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:42.860]  Show us your beanbag.
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.700]  Yeah. I mean, I got...
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.740]  And what's that?
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:11:03.540]  These are some gelatos. S1s in the 41. But I got drawers and all kinds of seeds all over the place.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:09.540]  We got seed fridges full. Oh, just because someone asked, I feel like I can go into
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:14.420]  you know, preserving seeds. I think it's real important, real quick before we get off the air.
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:17.300]  Someone had asked that question. I never got around to it.
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:22.260]  Yeah. And actually, I think we had a lot of those. But yeah, go for it. I'll start
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:25.940]  posting stuff as you're talking. We'll touch on it real quick. But yeah,
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.780]  I mean, harvesting seeds, what you want to do, there's two different concepts with harvesting
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:35.620]  seeds. You can either hang your plants. You can hang those plants. After you harvest,
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:40.980]  you hang them up, and you dry them out. And then you strip them off and you homogenize the material
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:45.300]  with your hands, or they have machines that do it. But you basically break up all this,
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:51.780]  you take the husk off the shell. So you're basically taking that and then you can either
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:57.620]  pick them out by hand, they have machines that do it. But the other approach would be to actually
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:02.500]  strip the plant material off of the branches. So you're dealing with that. You can put them
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:06.420]  in paper bags, you can put them on a screen, whatever the material is to dry it out as quickly
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:11.620]  as possible. You can turn the room temp up in your room to 90 degrees to dry it out really fast.
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:16.820]  Then you homogenize the material and you separate the seeds. You want to keep that in paper,
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:21.300]  you don't want to seal that bag. I have a friend that lost, his germination went from 100 to 50%
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.940]  by actually taking and putting his seeds in the fridge after he used a seed separator,
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:31.140]  not knowing that the seeds are still not cured. So what you have to do is a minimum of a month
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:38.260]  in paper, then you can put silica packs, the desiccant packs, and you put the desiccant packs,
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:44.340]  you can put the seeds then in the fridge in desiccant. And they will hold for a very,
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:47.860]  very, very long time, but you want to make sure they're fully dry, four to six weeks,
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:53.700]  minimum desiccant, super important. Get rid of all your plant material and just have seeds in there.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:59.620]  Separating your seeds, you can grade seeds, seeds are graded. So you have A through D
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:06.180]  for grading and D are the ones that are just light. The seed separators actually get rid of
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:09.620]  all those for you, but if you're doing it by eye, they're like white or yellow seeds that
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:15.300]  you can squeeze them and break and they pop really, they won't germinate. Then there's ones
[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:19.540]  that are just not fully mature. That would be like the C grade that actually are hard,
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:23.060]  that are matured enough to germinate. And you can test those with the germination test
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:31.220]  and see. And then there's stuff that would be like viable, good seed, which would be the B,
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:36.900]  which may or may not have tiger stripes or striping, and it may not be a hundred percent
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:42.900]  fully mature in that level, but they're still viable and get to near a hundred germination.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:48.740]  And then you have the perfect seed that has zero flaws, that has tiger striping or marbling.
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.060]  And those are the A grade seeds. So sometimes I like to separate my seeds,
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:14:00.420]  especially with smaller stuff in batches. Otherwise I just use the A and B and then the
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:05.300]  C and D grade seeds and I separate those completely and put those together if I'm doing large scale.
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:12.900]  Yeah. And I think you covered most of what was in some of these questions.
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.980]  I mean, you pretty much covered all of that.
[02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:22.500]  Yeah. I think I covered all of that. Stripping, drying them out. You want to dry them out quickly.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:27.940]  You want to fully dry them before you start fucking with them. The drier they are,
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:32.660]  the easier it is to homogenize that material and get the shell right off the seed.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:37.700]  All right. Well...
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:43.780]  Special guest was fun.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:51.780]  All right. Well, thank you everyone. Have a good... It's 1.20 in the PM in the Pacific
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:57.460]  time zone right now. Everyone enjoy your Sunday. I'm going to go see what football
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.980]  games are on right now and...
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:00.980]  I'm done.
[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:01.300]  Yes.
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:03.620]  Yes, have a good one.
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:06.660]  All right. See you everyone.
