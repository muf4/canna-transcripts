[00:00.440 --> 00:10.600]  All right, and we are live and Tyler is going to join us imminently.
[00:10.600 --> 00:14.680]  So thank you everyone for waiting.
[00:14.680 --> 00:21.600]  I thought Trevor who's been posted actually I can pull that up on Instagram.
[00:21.600 --> 00:31.160]  A slew of like breeding books from like what how old is the oldest one like late 1800s
[00:31.160 --> 00:35.160]  or are they all early 1900s?
[00:35.160 --> 00:41.040]  The breeding stuff is 1800s when you get into like tactonomy and stuff and Linnaeus then
[00:41.040 --> 00:44.960]  you start getting into the 1700s.
[00:45.160 --> 00:51.720]  The breeding stuff really it's mostly 1800s forward.
[00:51.720 --> 00:53.520]  And of course the internet doesn't load.
[00:53.520 --> 00:54.520]  Hold on.
[00:54.520 --> 01:03.760]  But yeah, so I thought if I can cue this up.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.880]  I like this guy.
[01:05.880 --> 01:08.600]  Yeah, R.A.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.600]  Fisher.
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.440]  He's the mathematician who really he did what Mendel did for quantitative genetics.
[01:17.440 --> 01:23.440]  Essentially, he took what Mendel had done for the simple inheritance of traits and peas
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.840]  and made it.
[01:26.840 --> 01:33.840]  He essentially translated it in a way that synthesized Darwin's theory of evolution and
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.320]  Mendel's theory of inheritance and explained how inheritance can happen over an entire
[01:40.320 --> 01:47.120]  population and actually all of that stuff through those two theories.
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.120]  So then can we start with Mendel?
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.760]  I think most people know kind of Darwin's theories.
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.120]  But what what are what is Mendel known for?
[01:55.120 --> 01:57.960]  OK, so like the inheritance.
[01:58.200 --> 02:03.200]  Yeah, Gregor Mendel was a 18th century or 19th century.
[02:05.280 --> 02:13.280]  Austrian monk who he basically studied botany in the 1840s and then in the 1860s conducted
[02:13.280 --> 02:20.640]  a series of experiments and in those experiments, he used garden peas and he took true breeding
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.360]  garden peas for different traits.
[02:23.440 --> 02:28.720]  He then hybridized those and noticed that the population that he grew out from those
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.800]  was all uniform for one particular trait.
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.760]  He listed all of this, made columns, statistics, did all of that.
[02:38.760 --> 02:45.680]  He then hybrid or took those and selfed plants from that F1 generation.
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.440]  He made the F2s.
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.640]  He grew those out and he noticed that they started to display traits that they weren't
[02:53.640 --> 02:56.680]  displaying in the F1 generation.
[02:56.680 --> 02:59.320]  He did this for a number of different traits.
[02:59.320 --> 03:05.280]  He expanded it out to do it for multiple traits for dihybrids.
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.600]  And he did the math on all the generations and found that there was a uniform segregation
[03:10.640 --> 03:19.640]  in the F2 generation showing that there was, as he came to conceptualize it, a dominant
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.840]  and a recessive allele that was being transmitted from generation to generation.
[03:25.840 --> 03:34.720]  He did all of this work, published it in 1865 and it got ignored.
[03:34.960 --> 03:42.720]  Basically, nobody looked at it again until some other people who were somewhat associated
[03:42.720 --> 03:50.600]  with him, like the guy whose grandfather had taught Mendel, helped rediscover his work.
[03:50.600 --> 03:57.800]  A dude whose professor had been in correspondence with Mendel at the time he was doing his experiments,
[03:57.800 --> 03:59.040]  helped to rediscover it.
[03:59.320 --> 04:07.560]  These other people working with plant breeding in and around the 1890s, 1900, helped rediscover
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.160]  Mendel's work.
[04:09.160 --> 04:15.880]  They did so by confirming it and then going back and being like, hey, has anybody else
[04:15.880 --> 04:18.480]  thought of these ideas before?
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.880]  They found out, oh yeah, we weren't the first to discover this.
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.640]  That rediscovery happened simultaneously amongst three different people in 1900, on the year
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.680]  1900.
[04:29.680 --> 04:36.960]  That really set off the revolution in scientific plant breeding.
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.480]  It created the field of genetics.
[04:40.480 --> 04:50.280]  From there, there was pretty much 20 years of pretty heated debate between the Mendelians
[04:50.280 --> 04:58.040]  and the Darwinian evolutionists because they had different ideas just about how the mechanics
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.120]  of the process all worked out.
[05:00.120 --> 05:02.120]  It wasn't until people like R.A.
[05:02.120 --> 05:11.960]  Fisher and Seawall Wright in the 1920s came together and were able to prove through really
[05:11.960 --> 05:20.000]  advanced complicated statistics that these two theories were perfectly compatible.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.320]  That was Mendel.
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.680]  One of the other key figures after Mendel, pretty much initially after the rediscovery
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.120]  of Mendel's work, was Wilhelm Johansen.
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.120]  Wilhelm Johansen was a Danish plant breeder.
[05:35.120 --> 05:39.400]  He wasn't classically trained.
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.920]  He had taken a pharmacology exam.
[05:42.920 --> 05:48.400]  That was the only formal education he had taken.
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.080]  He did work with peas.
[05:51.080 --> 05:59.320]  He took peas that he bought in 1900 and did a series of breeding experiments with them
[05:59.320 --> 06:03.560]  for the next three years where he inbred the line.
[06:03.560 --> 06:09.880]  He was able to demonstrate the pure line theory, which was essentially that each of the beans
[06:09.880 --> 06:16.840]  that were a different size within the population of the beans, if you grew them out, they stayed
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.080]  their weight essentially stayed constant.
[06:20.080 --> 06:27.000]  It didn't show in the next generations any variability in the weight.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.760]  But if you take the whole population as a whole, it would revert back to a mean.
[06:31.760 --> 06:37.560]  And so there was variability between the whole group, but within the individual lines, there
[06:37.560 --> 06:39.840]  wasn't any variability.
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.000]  He tested his theories.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.160]  He looked at environmental influences that were affecting the weight of the beans and
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.800]  the yields and things like this.
[06:49.800 --> 06:55.640]  And he really developed the key concepts that we use every day.
[06:55.640 --> 06:57.840]  He's the guy who came up with the idea.
[06:57.840 --> 06:59.880]  He coined the phrase gene.
[06:59.880 --> 07:01.840]  He coined the phrase genotype.
[07:01.840 --> 07:04.200]  He coined the phrase phenotype.
[07:04.200 --> 07:10.080]  He developed the conceptual distinction between those two ideas.
[07:10.160 --> 07:17.560]  And he's also the dude who developed the idea that a phenotype is the result of the interaction
[07:17.560 --> 07:25.520]  of a genotype in an environment and that that environmental, he was pretty firm that environmental
[07:25.520 --> 07:30.040]  inherit or environmental influences weren't heritable.
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.560]  Obviously we now know through epigenetics that there is heritability through environmental
[07:34.560 --> 07:36.360]  influences.
[07:36.640 --> 07:43.120]  But he did a very good job of working on the statistics and the math to demonstrate which
[07:43.120 --> 07:46.680]  variables were being caused by what.
[07:46.680 --> 07:55.200]  And so pure line theory then was essential to what later was developed with George H.
[07:55.200 --> 08:04.120]  Shull and Edward M. East in 1909 and a guy named Nils Nielsen.
[08:04.120 --> 08:09.040]  There was a bunch of dudes named Nielsen that worked at the Savlov Breeding Institute.
[08:09.040 --> 08:15.120]  And that was a Swiss breeding institute in the early 1900s that did a lot of, they pretty
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.880]  much invented the, or coined the phrase, the pedigree method.
[08:19.880 --> 08:28.960]  And so all of these people in the early 1900s came together working individually, but on
[08:28.960 --> 08:36.040]  the same subject matters and doing experimental breeding with plants and animals that allowed
[08:36.040 --> 08:44.280]  them to really devise the foundational bedrocks or the conceptual apparatus that we use every
[08:44.280 --> 08:51.680]  day whenever we're talking about cannabis breeding and inheritance of traits.
[08:51.680 --> 09:02.040]  So yeah, those were the really key figures in the first sort of decades of breeding.
[09:02.040 --> 09:11.680]  After that, it really became more of a way of devising systems and strategies of breeding
[09:11.680 --> 09:19.120]  to produce outcomes, specific outcomes, be it the various forms of pedigree breeding,
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.600]  back-cross breeding, et cetera.
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.440]  Do you see the comments?
[09:29.440 --> 09:31.920]  I have not, no.
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.720]  So Ben says Mendel lucked out.
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.600]  Can you read that?
[09:37.600 --> 09:40.400]  Only trade simple inheritance deal with...
[09:40.400 --> 09:47.600]  Yeah, so Mendel definitely, Mendel lucked out, but Mendel also did experiments with
[09:47.600 --> 09:54.440]  other plants that didn't conform to the simple inheritance of quantitative, or excuse me,
[09:54.440 --> 09:56.040]  qualitative traits.
[09:56.040 --> 10:03.480]  So the peas were an example that conformed to very simple independent assortment and
[10:03.480 --> 10:13.280]  segregation, the F2 generation uniformly segregated into a three, one ratio of dominant and recessive
[10:13.280 --> 10:14.280]  phenotypes.
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.440]  It made it really easy for him to do the math.
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.360]  And this was a huge, this was the crux of the debate.
[10:22.360 --> 10:29.600]  He probably just left the entire issue of botany and plant breeding and went on to be
[10:29.600 --> 10:35.640]  a Catholic monk who focused on the bureaucracy of monkeying because he took over the rectory
[10:35.640 --> 10:37.680]  or some shit in his town.
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.080]  So he left plant breeding shortly after.
[10:41.080 --> 10:42.680]  He hung up his cleats.
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.440]  Like Barry Sanders retiring early or something.
[10:46.440 --> 10:47.440]  Yeah.
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.440]  So he...
[10:48.440 --> 10:49.440]  Smart move, man.
[10:49.440 --> 10:50.440]  Smart move.
[10:50.440 --> 10:56.960]  He worked with other plants that didn't conform to this because he was looking at inheritance
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.240]  that was a qualitative trait as opposed to a quantitative trait.
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.760]  Excuse me.
[11:03.760 --> 11:05.760]  Switch that.
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.560]  Quantitative traits are traits that are controlled by multiple genes and they don't conform to
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.720]  the simple math that he was able to demonstrate.
[11:15.720 --> 11:20.400]  Instead of getting a discrete segregation, you'll end up with a curve.
[11:20.400 --> 11:27.520]  And so Wilhelm Johansson was able to demonstrate that these traits actually do, while they
[11:27.520 --> 11:34.880]  don't conform to the math that he was, that Mendel came up with, they do actually conform
[11:34.880 --> 11:41.240]  to the theory of inheritance, which is that there is a discrete unit that is transmitted
[11:41.280 --> 11:43.720]  from generation to generation.
[11:43.720 --> 11:50.480]  And that if you keep a pure line like Johansson did, you'll maintain that genotype from generation
[11:50.480 --> 11:52.440]  to generation.
[11:52.440 --> 11:59.760]  Then even for a qualitative trait that's controlled by many genes.
[11:59.760 --> 12:06.800]  Then Nils Nilsson was able to demonstrate up in Savlov that the grain color of wheat
[12:06.800 --> 12:10.360]  was controlled by up to three genes.
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.720]  So again, he was able to demonstrate that it was a qualitative trait and that it conformed
[12:15.720 --> 12:21.280]  to Mendelian theory or Mendel's theory of inheritance.
[12:21.280 --> 12:31.080]  And Edward M. East did a study with nicotine or tobacco in 1916 that demonstrated that
[12:31.080 --> 12:37.600]  the flower length was also a qualitative trait that conformed to Mendel's theory, albeit
[12:37.600 --> 12:39.520]  not the statistics.
[12:39.680 --> 12:48.440]  It wasn't until R.A. Fisher came along in 1918 and really did all the super advanced
[12:48.440 --> 12:50.720]  mathematics that you have to do.
[12:50.720 --> 12:57.960]  And R.A. Fisher is one of the, he is an enormous figure in the field of statistics.
[12:57.960 --> 13:04.800]  He came up with all sorts of, the way that you do randomized studies and experiments
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.880]  is based off of statistical analyses that he did.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.160]  The whole idea of P values and P hacking that's been a problem in repeatability of
[13:14.160 --> 13:20.560]  studies and the fact that they find, they'll basically find anything that has a P value
[13:20.560 --> 13:27.200]  of 0.5 and be like, oh look, there's a statistically significant P value here.
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.720]  So we can now publish this study sort of thing.
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.160]  He's the guy who came up with all of that statistical analysis.
[13:35.160 --> 13:48.160]  And he really took the, he did the math for quantitative genetics that Mendel did for,
[13:48.160 --> 13:53.520]  he did the math for qualitative genetics that Mendel did for quantitative genetics.
[13:53.520 --> 14:01.480]  So that's, and I invert qualitative and quantitative a lot because I use it in the opposite context
[14:01.480 --> 14:08.200]  most times than it's used by these cats.
[14:08.200 --> 14:15.160]  So yeah, that's why Mendel's theories, like he definitely lucked out, but we all lucked
[14:15.160 --> 14:22.760]  out that he lucked out because he fucking, you know, he was right even though it didn't
[14:22.760 --> 14:30.640]  necessarily conform to the more general type of inheritance that we see, which is multiple
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.440]  genes controlling an individual trait.
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.400]  And that's why the Darwinians were like, dude, you took, like, this is all bullshit.
[14:39.400 --> 14:41.400]  Like you can't explain height.
[14:41.400 --> 14:47.040]  Like you take a tall person and a short person and you don't end up with like three tall
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.680]  people and one short person, like in a couple of generations.
[14:51.680 --> 14:53.120]  It doesn't conform to that.
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.240]  Like this isn't how these genes work.
[14:57.240 --> 15:05.760]  So they looked at the math and said, you can't look at just the phenotype distributions
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.200]  in populations and explain them through Mendel's math.
[15:11.200 --> 15:12.280]  And they were right.
[15:12.280 --> 15:13.280]  You couldn't.
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.720]  And luckily a bunch of people spent a lot, two decades basically arguing about this shit.
[15:19.720 --> 15:28.160]  And they figured it out though, by like 1927, essentially all, all of the theoretical, like
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.320]  baselines and fundamental stuff had been figured out.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.320]  Yeah.
[15:32.320 --> 15:39.960]  You know, I just think it would be cool is to have a conversation with like a grape breeder,
[15:39.960 --> 15:52.960]  a cannabis breeder, like a plum slash peach slash whatever breeder, like a hops breeder.
[15:52.960 --> 15:58.400]  And all crops have their own different breeding methods and reproduction methods.
[15:58.400 --> 16:04.960]  Some hybridized F1s is the way that you go and other crops in F1 isn't going to get you
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.080]  any of the gains that you would see that we do in outcrossing species.
[16:11.080 --> 16:15.960]  Typically F1 hybrids are best in outcrossing species.
[16:15.960 --> 16:16.960]  Yeah.
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.320]  Now they're doing like in corn and stuff, like they're doing like the double haploids
[16:21.320 --> 16:23.720]  and all that type of breeding and shit.
[16:23.720 --> 16:28.960]  They're like kind of, you know, stopping the whole process of, of the line breeding altogether
[16:28.960 --> 16:38.920]  and kind of looking for the, the mutants and using the, you know, what is it?
[16:38.920 --> 16:45.120]  Inducer plants that only send partial genes over or no genes at all so that they can find
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.440]  the, find the ones that they can kind of mutate and jump, jump, you know, kind of like cell
[16:49.440 --> 16:50.440]  free and stuff.
[16:50.440 --> 16:51.440]  So it's cool stuff, man.
[16:51.440 --> 16:52.440]  That's cool.
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.720]  You can get lost in all those books and videos and funny stuff.
[16:57.720 --> 17:00.840]  I spent all my time driving around listening to crazy shit like that.
[17:00.840 --> 17:02.840]  My wife thinks I'm fucking nuts.
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.840]  Yeah.
[17:03.840 --> 17:04.840]  Yeah.
[17:04.840 --> 17:10.360]  No, those, the Oregon CBD cats, they've really done some stuff.
[17:10.360 --> 17:16.320]  Like when I, when I hear about that sort of stuff, like I've always, I mean, I was late
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.200]  to the game on a lot of things, femmes and different stuff like that, just because I
[17:21.200 --> 17:25.240]  was like old school, hippie, like all organic sort of thing.
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.080]  And like, I thought that that was a unnatural way of breeding.
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.440]  Now that I've gone in, I've done a lot more research and reading on general breeding.
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.880]  I figured out how that stuff works and understand it better.
[17:38.880 --> 17:44.120]  And I also understand like, well, I'm not comfortable to do the shit that they're doing
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.920]  because I mean, it's above my pay grade, but like, it's impressive.
[17:48.920 --> 17:55.320]  The, uh, triploid plants that they're moving out, the minor cannabinoids, the ways that
[17:55.320 --> 18:05.760]  people are like, there's a lot of talk on the gram where, you know, we like to, we've
[18:05.760 --> 18:13.120]  been denied access to academic resources and our plants been significantly neglected by
[18:13.120 --> 18:14.720]  academic research.
[18:14.720 --> 18:21.400]  And so to a certain extent, like if you want to find a lot of literature on cannabis, a
[18:21.400 --> 18:27.960]  lot of it predates 1930, which is like really, you know, for most subjects matters, like
[18:27.960 --> 18:30.880]  that's not normal.
[18:30.880 --> 18:37.160]  And so we have to go back and, you know, it's surprisingly well studied for how far back
[18:37.160 --> 18:43.840]  we have to go, but there's limited analysis and there were limited techniques of analysis
[18:43.960 --> 18:44.800]  at the time.
[18:44.800 --> 18:51.280]  And so we're, you know, playing catch up, but there are people out there who are doing
[18:51.280 --> 18:57.960]  applied breeding, applying these same ideas that were figured out between, you know, 19,
[18:57.960 --> 19:07.160]  well, 1865 and 1927 and applying them and doing incredible stuff.
[19:07.160 --> 19:13.080]  There's really good work that's being done by breeders who are doing back crossbreeding,
[19:13.240 --> 19:16.520]  line breeding, pedigree breeding of different types.
[19:17.600 --> 19:23.160]  I think that it's going to be really interesting to see, like, I'm not entirely sure all of
[19:23.160 --> 19:31.560]  the methods that Oregon CBD is using, but their accelerated breeding techniques of using
[19:31.560 --> 19:38.360]  essentially small tents with pollen containment and doing really rapid generation advancement
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.160]  is like single seed descent is the method.
[19:44.160 --> 19:53.800]  If you want to increase low heritability traits in a population and maximize your ability
[19:53.800 --> 19:59.640]  to select for low heritability traits, you want to use single seeds descent as your method
[19:59.640 --> 20:05.960]  for breeding. And that looks like what they're doing in their rapid accelerated breeding
[20:05.960 --> 20:15.480]  method. And that right there is a technique that, you know, you don't hear talked about
[20:15.480 --> 20:24.720]  very often and you don't hear about breeders throwing around actual breeding methods and
[20:24.720 --> 20:28.120]  bringing the science because all this stuff has been figured out.
[20:28.120 --> 20:34.000]  Like every one of every single breeding strategy that we can deploy has already been thought
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.920]  out. And the, you know, theoretical maximums for average inheritance is already been figured
[20:41.920 --> 20:43.880]  out by mathematicians.
[20:43.880 --> 20:46.320]  And now, granted, those are just theoretical.
[20:46.320 --> 20:51.720]  We still have to go out into the field and demonstrate and prove that our crops conform to
[20:51.720 --> 20:55.400]  this and that these are breeding methods that are actually successful.
[20:55.400 --> 20:56.600]  But motherfuckers are doing it.
[20:56.840 --> 21:05.520]  Like Oregon CBD has proven that you can very rapidly isolate very minor cannibinoids and
[21:05.520 --> 21:10.120]  increase their frequency in the population and the amounts that you're getting of these
[21:10.120 --> 21:12.640]  minor cannibinoids in a very short amount of time.
[21:12.640 --> 21:17.840]  And they're doing it through these methods and these techniques of scientific breeding.
[21:17.840 --> 21:20.280]  It's not it's not rocket science.
[21:20.280 --> 21:25.880]  We just haven't been able to, you know, be in the game for quite a long time.
[21:25.880 --> 21:30.480]  And I really like the other thing I do want to give a shout out to all the different people
[21:30.480 --> 21:37.760]  who have done it, because like anybody who's been breeding on any level and producing fire
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.840]  is like one, we're like fighting a massive uphill battle.
[21:44.280 --> 21:51.240]  And the fact that we're doing this with as many limited resources, restrictions and like
[21:51.240 --> 21:55.440]  barriers to our success is really quite impressive.
[21:55.440 --> 22:02.360]  The fact that between, you know, the 1960s to now and the rate at which we've magnified or
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.200]  increased THC through just recurrent selection is really impressive.
[22:07.480 --> 22:14.400]  Like nobody had a fucking GC or like a few cats did, but most people weren't testing their shit.
[22:14.400 --> 22:16.680]  They were just smoking that shit and selecting that shit.
[22:16.680 --> 22:22.160]  And they were successfully doing it in ways that are, you know, I mean, if we were to graph
[22:22.200 --> 22:28.080]  this shit, it may look like some of the increase in yields that you get for hybrid corn where, you know,
[22:28.080 --> 22:36.040]  there's the chart where it shows the open pollination methods from like Civil War to like the 1930s
[22:36.040 --> 22:41.360]  about. And then like the double crosses come online and those increase yields.
[22:41.360 --> 22:45.200]  And then the single crosses come in the 60s and just fucking yields go through the roof.
[22:45.200 --> 22:50.720]  And then genetic modified organisms kind of keep yields going because like we're fucking just, you
[22:50.720 --> 22:52.440]  know, sucking on fumes now.
[22:52.440 --> 22:55.560]  But like that trajectory has happened.
[22:55.840 --> 23:02.800]  They did all of that with scientific breeding methods, with academic university research at every level
[23:02.800 --> 23:09.720]  supporting the breeders and the institutions and massive industries behind them doing this.
[23:10.320 --> 23:16.040]  We've been doing this in our garages and our closets and our fucking backyards and figuring out how to
[23:16.040 --> 23:20.440]  do it. And, you know, same is true for CBD.
[23:20.520 --> 23:29.360]  Where I remember in 2010 time period, we would get Project CBD and O'Shaughnessy was asking people to
[23:29.360 --> 23:35.320]  fucking send in reports or any verified 2 to 4 percent CBD plants.
[23:35.720 --> 23:43.680]  And like Ringo's 15 percenter when he had that sour tsunami tested 15 people like, oh, holy shit.
[23:43.720 --> 23:50.160]  Like that was like a 30 percent CBD back in the day or like 30 percent THC for us now.
[23:50.720 --> 24:00.720]  And so like that sort of thing where from in 10 years, people largely without use of equipments are able to
[24:00.720 --> 24:07.840]  very rapidly increase minor cannabinoids that just fucking 10 years ago, people were like, no, that's like
[24:08.040 --> 24:12.200]  an upper threshold is 15 percent and people are pushing 20.
[24:12.200 --> 24:21.200]  So that's something that I think, you know, we need to respect what people have done, how people have done it,
[24:21.240 --> 24:30.120]  recognize that the germplasm we have is been improved significantly and we're all able to fucking select
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.880]  fire from all different breeders and seed companies.
[24:34.240 --> 24:40.320]  But we also like the more we apply these methods, the better things will get.
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.240]  I think the proof is already there in the pudding.
[24:48.760 --> 24:54.120]  It can only go so far, you know, you got to you got to up your game just like everybody else up their game, you know.
[24:54.160 --> 25:03.440]  I mean, Tyler went places when you talk to friends in the citrus world where you're like, I can breed like
[25:03.440 --> 25:12.880]  three generations in a year and they're like, how long is a citrus breeding program to get like to the next generation?
[25:16.480 --> 25:22.960]  Well, any any tree or a fruit production tree is going to be somewhere between five and 10 years for
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.520]  bearing, for running through selections and stuff like that.
[25:26.560 --> 25:34.440]  You can you can get stuff going and you can start grafting and trying to push things on old, older, older rootstock.
[25:34.440 --> 25:42.800]  I mean, but realistically speaking, you're looking five years, five, eight years easy dedicated in one, finding one good plant.
[25:43.240 --> 25:51.520]  So you got to do it on scale, you know, peaches like the the plurals, the nectar plums, the, you know, the
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.520]  pecatums, all those cool hybrid fruits, you know, that are just like, you know, they're pollen crosses.
[25:56.520 --> 26:03.400]  But you got to go through you got to go through lots of different numbers to find the ones that are tasty, that are, you know,
[26:03.400 --> 26:05.960]  resistant and hang on the tree that ripen right.
[26:05.960 --> 26:10.120]  And it takes them a long time depending on what type of tree they are, what type of fruit would they bear on?
[26:10.880 --> 26:13.640]  Like you're breeding persimmons or figs or something like that.
[26:13.640 --> 26:21.000]  That's, you know, those types of plants will fruit on like new growth or, you know, new wood.
[26:21.280 --> 26:28.680]  So to speak, we're like a plum or something like that, like spurs or an apple or a pear like spur fruiting.
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.840]  So those take a lot longer to develop.
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.240]  So years down the line, you know, those those will take a little bit longer to see the fruit and taste the production.
[26:37.520 --> 26:40.880]  And even even more so like fruit tasting contests and stuff.
[26:40.880 --> 26:47.480]  So say you got like, you know, you just got a regular fruit or new fruit or whatever, and you're going to go to a contest or enter a piece of fruit.
[26:47.720 --> 26:59.800]  They're always entering those older trees, those those 20 plus year old trees that have been around and had the practice developing those fruits and put in the time and built the relationships in the soil and things for the ultimate flavor.
[26:59.800 --> 27:09.000]  They always say, don't judge a young tree on its fruit too early because it hasn't had the hasn't had the chance, hasn't had the opportunity to tap in and get all the practice yet.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.080]  So that's the way I look at it.
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.160]  So it takes time, man.
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.160]  What's the sweet spot for like an orange tree?
[27:17.160 --> 27:27.440]  You said 20 years, but like, is it 20, like 15 to 30 or and then does it just like like a grade like for production?
[27:27.440 --> 27:31.040]  Like, yeah, like it's peak production age, I guess.
[27:31.040 --> 27:38.240]  So I always say once you get a tree planted, you set the timer for about four years.
[27:38.240 --> 27:41.440]  You're four, you're five is when the magic starts to happen.
[27:42.440 --> 27:55.720]  By the time that tree like age of the actual tree is 15, you know, 12, 15, getting into its teenage years, that's when you're getting lots of, you know, lots of good vigor, lots of good production.
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.200]  But when it really gets old, that's that's when the spurs are developed.
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.040]  That's when those old habits, that's when the vigor dies down a little bit and production kicks up in a lot of them.
[28:04.040 --> 28:14.360]  So some some trees, depending on where you are, like like a typical city tree, fruit tree or ornamental tree, live 35, 45 years, something like that.
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.520]  You know, but you know, like redwoods and things could live 2000 years.
[28:18.520 --> 28:20.480]  Other trees could live several hundred years.
[28:20.480 --> 28:28.520]  It kind of just depends on the environment, the way it's cared for, all those all those factors.
[28:28.800 --> 28:38.760]  So the older the tree, the healthier the tree is, your production can can be strong well into your hundreds.
[28:38.760 --> 28:47.440]  I've seen historical orange trees, Washington navels and things like that planted 90 years, 100 years old, beautiful fruit.
[28:47.440 --> 28:49.480]  And the oranges taste great.
[28:49.720 --> 28:57.240]  Delish. Some of the best tasting fruit you've ever you've ever had, you know, and these things have been around for 60 plus, 70 plus, 80 plus.
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.280]  I've seen more than I can count, you know, on that on that on that standpoint.
[29:01.520 --> 29:08.480]  Some of the best fruit I've ever tasted has been from the oldest trees, avocados, plums, citrus.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.600]  That's where the magic happens.
[29:10.600 --> 29:18.480]  And that makes all the sense when I was talking about the contest, because the older the tree, the better the the quality doesn't work that way.
[29:18.480 --> 29:21.160]  And shorter, short crops like cannabis and things.
[29:21.160 --> 29:27.520]  But, you know, when you're in the tree game, it takes it takes the time, but you get the reward down the line in a different way.
[29:27.560 --> 29:32.240]  You know what I mean? So it's just they they start kicking.
[29:32.240 --> 29:34.600]  They want to produce. It depends on the type of tree, too.
[29:34.600 --> 29:43.600]  So some some trees like avocados, they're more shy to produce basically because of their flower cycle, A types and B types.
[29:43.600 --> 29:46.360]  And we can go into crazy detail on that.
[29:47.040 --> 29:54.800]  And like size and vigor and all these things like some trees like like peaches and apricots and plums and things.
[29:56.440 --> 30:03.360]  Peaches, more so persimmons, figs, they'll fruit a lot earlier and want to be early to the party when they're kicking on things.
[30:03.560 --> 30:06.760]  Some things will take five, six years to really start to produce well.
[30:07.200 --> 30:10.800]  Pomegranates being one of those, avocados being one of those.
[30:10.960 --> 30:14.200]  A little bit later on, they start getting into production mode.
[30:14.440 --> 30:20.080]  But there's things you can plant today that, you know, later this summer you could have fruit on the tree.
[30:20.360 --> 30:30.520]  You know, a peach being one of them, you know, a little young whippersnapper, a bare root tree that's, you know, four foot tall stick with a couple of little broken branches on the side.
[30:30.520 --> 30:33.160]  You plant one of those properly and get it going by this summer.
[30:33.520 --> 30:35.640]  You know, you might have a peach hanging on the bottom of it.
[30:35.640 --> 30:38.000]  And by next summer, you'll be rocking and rolling.
[30:38.040 --> 30:40.560]  You know what I mean? You start getting some stuff hanging on there if you do it right.
[30:41.040 --> 30:43.640]  You know, so other stuff doesn't happen that quick.
[30:44.200 --> 30:52.280]  Do you guys see that question?
[30:58.870 --> 31:15.550]  So if you want to isolate, if you're just a garden in your garage without any fancy laboratory equipment, testing stuff like that, learning to reverse plants and self your plants is going to be the best way to isolate the traits you're looking for.
[31:16.190 --> 31:22.950]  So a good way to look at it is if you have a plant you love and you self that plant.
[31:24.470 --> 31:29.910]  You just kind of fixed half of the gene pool or half of the genes, you know, half of the genes are in that plant.
[31:30.310 --> 31:31.470]  You have 100 percent genes.
[31:31.710 --> 31:32.670]  You self that plant.
[31:32.670 --> 31:35.190]  You just kind of fix half of those genes.
[31:35.510 --> 31:39.390]  If you self that plant again, you fix half of those genes again.
[31:39.390 --> 31:45.030]  So now you're up to 75 percent of the genes you kind of want to look into isolate, so to speak.
[31:45.030 --> 31:47.310]  Right. You keep going.
[31:47.470 --> 31:56.070]  You can you can lock down that plant and pretty much get a, you know, you know, homo, you know, homozygous or heterozygous plant.
[31:56.670 --> 31:58.870]  Whatever way you want to look at it, you want to go scientific.
[31:58.870 --> 32:00.950]  We can get the words out and I'll get my dictionary.
[32:00.950 --> 32:03.230]  But basically you want to plant is going to be the same.
[32:03.550 --> 32:05.390]  Start selfing it over and over again.
[32:05.790 --> 32:12.710]  You're going to lose some vigor, but you're going to isolate those traits you're looking for quick as you know, like the home breeder.
[32:13.670 --> 32:15.910]  You can you can do two separate lines in that way.
[32:15.910 --> 32:22.310]  A lot of times I'll do that. I'll run two separate things from the same and I'll kind of take them similar or different directions.
[32:22.310 --> 32:30.310]  And then later on, you can recombine those and you can get some vigor back into your into your plant and still retain a lot of the traits you're looking for.
[32:30.790 --> 32:33.190]  But really, you're just looking like you've got a plant you like.
[32:33.190 --> 32:34.950]  You want to like isolate some of those traits.
[32:35.390 --> 32:38.630]  Start just just start learning how to self your plant properly.
[32:39.430 --> 32:43.150]  If it's a plant worth selfing that's stable and we've gone through all that crap.
[32:43.190 --> 32:45.630]  We're not talking about all that right now, but you got a plant you want to.
[32:46.070 --> 32:50.110]  That's that's how you fix half of the half of the pool to kind of like strengthen that up.
[32:50.110 --> 32:52.550]  And then you can go farther either way you want to go from there.
[32:53.110 --> 32:54.670]  That's the way I do it anyway.
[32:57.390 --> 33:02.790]  Can you guys all talk about like you talked about different breeding strategies and.
[33:03.790 --> 33:10.150]  Can you guys actually all talk about how you like what strategies you employ individually?
[33:10.870 --> 33:11.830]  Mr. Toad salute.
[33:12.550 --> 33:13.590]  Hey, how you doing, brother?
[33:14.870 --> 33:18.990]  Well, I can tell you how I started from my experience.
[33:19.670 --> 33:24.350]  I began breeding from a medicinal point from the patient standpoint.
[33:24.470 --> 33:30.430]  My grandfather was diagnosed with throat cancer early in the 90s, and they wanted to remove his throat.
[33:30.630 --> 33:37.550]  And part of his they wanted to pull his tongue out and remove his lower jaw and insert radioactive rods into his throat.
[33:38.630 --> 33:42.950]  And at that time, we had just got busted from cannabis growing.
[33:42.950 --> 33:44.150]  We were growing cannabis for him.
[33:44.150 --> 33:47.590]  We had 12 plants and we were growing that to treat his cancer.
[33:47.590 --> 33:52.910]  And when we got busted, he he ended up dying that year and we didn't have any cannabis.
[33:52.910 --> 33:55.470]  And the man screamed for cannabis as he was dying.
[33:55.470 --> 34:21.070]  So when I did get a chance to get back to the plant legally, the first thing I did was instantly start growing for medicinal purposes where I made sure everything that I was growing for went through some form of a patient's hand where that person I knew their medical condition, what they were using prior to the cannabis, what kind of cannabis they did use if they were using it.
[34:21.430 --> 34:26.470]  And that way I would be able to try to gear everything that I was using toward specific ailments.
[34:27.030 --> 34:32.550]  I started early on, like I said, with cancer, with some MS patients, a lot of PTSD.
[34:32.870 --> 34:37.070]  And that's where everything I read through was for that type of stuff.
[34:37.270 --> 34:43.630]  My father was a veteran who was 100 percent disabled from exposure to Agent Orange.
[34:43.910 --> 34:50.790]  And my brother or my mother had a lot of depression growing up and as an adult.
[34:50.790 --> 34:54.670]  And then she ended up having a four state cancer as an adult also.
[34:54.670 --> 34:58.870]  So I used my cannabis to steer all my breeding that direction.
[34:58.870 --> 35:03.590]  And once I started working in a collective, I had 4600 patients.
[35:03.590 --> 35:10.510]  And what I did is I took around 400 of those patients and I used them kind of as my my information group.
[35:10.510 --> 35:12.950]  Right. I would send cuts to them with no name.
[35:13.710 --> 35:20.590]  The only thing they knew was that it was going to be something that was similar to what they thought they were using prior.
[35:21.310 --> 35:23.070]  But I would give them a call of what they used.
[35:24.070 --> 35:26.350]  Say they were using a bubble cushion, I'd give them a bubble.
[35:26.670 --> 35:33.550]  And then I would take a cross of my work with a bubble to see if I was retaining any of the qualities of the plant and medicinal side.
[35:33.830 --> 35:38.470]  Or if I was adding things extra to it or it was actually becoming worse.
[35:38.470 --> 35:39.830]  That's how I would end up finding stuff out.
[35:39.830 --> 35:42.350]  So I would end up getting a lot of seniors, a lot of veterans.
[35:42.790 --> 35:49.830]  And these people would come back and give me information on my lines because to be able to actually test that.
[35:50.270 --> 35:51.670]  This was in the early 2000s.
[35:52.030 --> 35:54.510]  It was kind of out of place and it was way too expensive.
[35:54.510 --> 35:58.030]  We would have put that cannabis and the seed lines so far I reached for anybody.
[35:58.150 --> 36:00.910]  It just was just not something I was into.
[36:00.910 --> 36:08.310]  So all I did was make sure everything that I was breeding went through a group of patients that was as large as I could get.
[36:08.310 --> 36:15.470]  So I like I might have 40 people running one set of clones and seed lines and another 41 in a different group.
[36:15.470 --> 36:19.310]  That way I would have a information pool that would come back to me.
[36:19.310 --> 36:21.430]  So all the patients would write down what they did.
[36:21.790 --> 36:24.150]  They tell me how easy the plants were to grow.
[36:24.470 --> 36:27.830]  They'd let me know if it relieved any of their ailments.
[36:27.830 --> 36:30.670]  Did it antagonize anything that they were after?
[36:30.670 --> 36:33.070]  Like the PTSD is a real hard one to mess with.
[36:33.070 --> 36:41.710]  Like you can give the same line to two different people and the condition that's causing their PTSD could be antagonized by the same medicine.
[36:42.230 --> 36:48.430]  So to be able to understand what these people were going through, I could only learn that through actual hands on breeding.
[36:48.430 --> 36:49.710]  And that's what I was doing.
[36:49.710 --> 36:58.190]  So the people that I worked with, these veterans ended up becoming kind of to the point where they didn't want to do this anymore because they felt they were getting stuff for free.
[36:58.230 --> 37:05.590]  So once I told them that all the information they were bringing back to me was helping so many more people, they ended up bringing more veterans to me.
[37:05.590 --> 37:12.470]  And I ended up with, like I said, at the end, I had about 400 guys, gals that were all.
[37:15.750 --> 37:17.790]  The glitch in the Matrix is back.
[37:19.430 --> 37:22.390]  Tony, you're you're frozen.
[37:24.110 --> 37:25.750]  Tyler, you can hear me, right?
[37:25.990 --> 37:26.990]  It's not I can hear it.
[37:26.990 --> 37:27.830]  I can ever tell.
[37:27.830 --> 37:29.110]  I'm like, maybe I'm frozen.
[37:29.110 --> 37:31.110]  Who is in my mind?
[37:31.110 --> 37:31.550]  The zone.
[37:34.430 --> 37:35.430]  Tony's back.
[37:36.230 --> 37:37.230]  All right, you're back.
[37:37.670 --> 37:38.310]  No worries.
[37:39.030 --> 37:39.750]  Sorry about that.
[37:41.470 --> 37:42.630]  Not sure what I got in.
[37:43.590 --> 37:45.110]  So was so.
[37:45.110 --> 37:53.830]  OK, so you have a focus in terms of like what you want to be breeding in terms of medical value and different conditions.
[37:54.150 --> 38:00.430]  But now can you talk about kind of like because earlier Trevor was talking about kind of different breeding strategies.
[38:00.910 --> 38:02.870]  And can you guys kind of talk about.
[38:04.030 --> 38:08.150]  Are you talking about selling lines and going into back crossing and stuff?
[38:08.190 --> 38:09.150]  I do that quite a bit.
[38:09.150 --> 38:13.110]  My angel line I worked with since 2005 when I made the line.
[38:13.590 --> 38:17.950]  The first thing I did was I self all three sister Fino's that I kept.
[38:18.910 --> 38:31.910]  Then I self the male also and had him tested so I would know what he'd be offering to me on the male side of things, because the male has a larger mega base of data of genetic code to pass when he's breeding.
[38:31.910 --> 38:37.070]  So in the cannabis, the male side actually offers you more information than the female side can.
[38:37.110 --> 38:40.710]  So that's a good idea to always introduce males in your breeding at some point.
[38:41.230 --> 38:47.070]  But when you're selfing a plant, it's a it's a real quick way to start to lock in traits that you're after.
[38:47.070 --> 38:56.950]  If you know how to do good selection, as long as you don't start picking bad and bottleneck in the line, you can start to lock in traits extremely fast instead of going through F generations of plants.
[38:57.750 --> 39:04.270]  You can also take those self lines and start to back cross into the original parent lines and lock in traits that way.
[39:04.470 --> 39:17.350]  Or you can go through selfing a male and self a male in cannabis, you're going to be able to start pulling out male and female seeds, which then you can start to cross on their selves, which will help you lock in more traits.
[39:17.350 --> 39:18.950]  That's what it's all about in cannabis.
[39:18.950 --> 39:21.430]  But what you don't want to lock in is all the bad stuff.
[39:21.430 --> 39:25.870]  So you got to go through a large selection when you're doing your S1's or your S2's and so on.
[39:26.310 --> 39:33.150]  Because if you're doing a small pool, you're never going to see the outliers in that line, which can throw that line in a bad direction.
[39:33.150 --> 39:35.510]  You're going to start line breeding in a very small pool.
[39:35.750 --> 39:38.230]  And that's not a good idea when you're selfing your plants.
[39:38.230 --> 39:38.750]  You need to have a...
[39:39.470 --> 39:41.550]  For me, I would go with a very large selection.
[39:41.550 --> 39:48.270]  If you're going to go to a small selection, go to F gen and pull out some F2's that kind of look alike and start working that way.
[39:48.990 --> 39:53.230]  But if you really want to lock your line in, you need to make it a true breeding line.
[39:53.230 --> 39:54.870]  The only way you're doing that is through inbreeding.
[39:55.030 --> 39:57.590]  You know, that's the only thing that's going to work that way.
[39:58.390 --> 40:06.160]  So I release a lot of F2 stuff.
[40:07.160 --> 40:12.360]  And if you're just looking at basic Mendelian type stuff, right?
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.720]  Like recessive traits are usually good stuff in cannabis.
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.240]  Like we're usually looking for recessive things are usually pretty cool.
[40:20.440 --> 40:21.320]  Sometimes they suck.
[40:21.800 --> 40:26.840]  But sometimes it's like that recessive thing that's hard to fucking find, you know, that is never hard to pop up.
[40:26.840 --> 40:28.360]  That's the one you always want to find, right?
[40:28.840 --> 40:36.440]  And then initial cross, your F1 cross, you're just like going off the basic like Mendelian garage fucking knowledge type stuff.
[40:36.960 --> 40:39.600]  That most of the recessive traits are going to be covered up.
[40:39.640 --> 40:43.120]  You're not going to see a lot of those in that first F1 cross.
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.440]  So you're going to get a lot of good stuff and there's cool stuff, especially if you're dealing with good parents.
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.480]  And cannabis has way more genes and fucking chromosomes and all kinds of shit going on.
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.640]  And so you got more options.
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.920]  But in that first generation cross, you're not going to get as many recessive things popping out.
[40:58.360 --> 41:04.520]  So when you F2 that, all your recessive things start popping out a little bit more freely.
[41:04.800 --> 41:13.120]  So I like to release the F2 stuff like, you know, the bacon grease is F2 or the the Flamingo Ringo is an F2.
[41:13.320 --> 41:15.560]  I released a lot of F2 things.
[41:15.920 --> 41:23.640]  And then the F2 generation, you're going to open it all up so you can you can kind of look at everything, the good, the bad, the ugly in cannabis.
[41:23.880 --> 41:38.600]  So usually you find some good fucking shit in the F2 generation and that's the breeders, you know, batch to look for stuff, to find the cool things to work on, to create your fucking breeder plant and yada yada itself and move on.
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.000]  But essentially to like share the love and to like trying to give back.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.960]  I try to I try to release those open populations.
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.040]  I call them open populations.
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.080]  I don't know if that's correct or not, but I call them open populations.
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.840]  So you can really see see what's in there, the recessive in everything.
[41:53.080 --> 41:55.800]  So that's kind of like my breeding strategy.
[41:55.800 --> 41:58.120]  I go through, I find some stuff.
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.880]  I usually look for resin males.
[42:01.120 --> 42:02.320]  That's one of my favorite things.
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.960]  Lots of my stuff is that I release is resin male oriented or resin male that I found and kept for a long period of time.
[42:09.680 --> 42:11.200]  I'll make an F1 cross.
[42:11.680 --> 42:14.520]  Sometimes I'll release that, you know, in some cases.
[42:14.520 --> 42:26.400]  But most of the time I'll do a real run through the F1s and I'll pull up, you know, a winner or two or three, you know, on either side and I'll make an F2 cross there.
[42:27.600 --> 42:38.800]  And then those are the seeds that usually get put out to the world because that's where you're going to see all the magic that like, you know, that first two or those first three were kind of holding, you know, and you're going to find cool stuff that's better than the parent.
[42:39.280 --> 42:42.080]  And you're going to find stuff that's worse than the parent in some cases.
[42:42.120 --> 42:48.600]  But usually, you know, if you're working with good shit, you know, another thing, good breeds good.
[42:48.640 --> 42:50.520]  That's another thing I stand by, you know what I mean?
[42:50.520 --> 42:53.920]  So usually, you know, I mean, fuck, you got good shit.
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.880]  You've always got good shit in the pipe.
[42:55.920 --> 42:59.880]  You know, it's hard to pull out a dumpster.
[42:59.920 --> 43:00.440]  You know what I mean?
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.520]  Every once in a while you'll find one, but it's harder and harder if you're really working with good shit.
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.120]  So that's what I like to do.
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.240]  I like to do F2 stuff.
[43:07.280 --> 43:08.760]  I like to send F2 stuff out there.
[43:09.280 --> 43:11.200]  Love it, hate it, I don't know.
[43:11.360 --> 43:11.840]  That's what I do.
[43:12.680 --> 43:20.000]  Well, no, but it's interesting because like that's not what you would send to a commercial facility at scale that wants consistency.
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.360]  That's for like somebody who's like, I'm excited to see where this goes.
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.920]  I have no idea what to expect this season, but it's going to be interesting.
[43:27.840 --> 43:28.360]  No.
[43:29.120 --> 43:33.600]  And that's why and that's why I talk about like shelving and back crossing.
[43:33.600 --> 43:41.120]  I do tons of back crossing, you know, you know, BX one, two, three, four, you know, different things with the PAM.
[43:41.120 --> 43:48.160]  I do all kinds of weird stuff where I'll do an out cross and then a bunch of back crossing and then an out crossing and a bunch of back crossing again.
[43:48.160 --> 43:51.280]  And just, you know, I just I do weird, funky stuff like that.
[43:53.040 --> 44:10.440]  But usually speaking, if you're going to do it for a commercial or you want to run hundreds and thousands in a field and hectares of shit, you better have a fucking, you know, uniform line with one phenotype and one hermaphrodite for every fucking four thousand plants.
[44:10.440 --> 44:11.800]  You know what I mean? That's that's it.
[44:11.800 --> 44:16.200]  And you can't do that without without science at that point.
[44:16.200 --> 44:22.760]  You can't do that without the testing and the and the skipping generations and the chemicals and the fucking laboratories.
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.160]  I mean, you can do that, but it's going to take a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of love.
[44:27.160 --> 44:30.600]  And you're not going to be pushing out strands every year to the market that way.
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.400]  It's going to be a different way.
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.040]  So me, I've always been I like fun stuff.
[44:38.040 --> 44:40.120]  I'm always like top of the seats, man.
[44:40.120 --> 44:43.800]  I'm a seed popper. I like finding cool stuff and all kinds of seeds.
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.960]  I like seeing crappy stuff.
[44:45.960 --> 44:47.240]  I like seeing hype stuff.
[44:47.240 --> 44:48.840]  I like I just like pop it seeds.
[44:48.840 --> 44:51.000]  I pop bag seeds on the regular.
[44:51.000 --> 44:57.080]  If there's a bag seed anywhere and it came out of something tasty, I'm popping it every single time or I'll pop three or four.
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.320]  I don't care if I waste time, space, effort to complete her whatever.
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.600]  I always pop seeds because that's the hunt, the chase, the fun.
[45:06.600 --> 45:08.120]  That's that's what's fun for me.
[45:08.360 --> 45:13.160]  And I can always find stuff and I have stuff that I'll never get lost.
[45:13.160 --> 45:14.280]  And that's just the way that it is.
[45:14.280 --> 45:15.240]  But it's always the chase.
[45:15.240 --> 45:16.360]  I'm always popping seeds.
[45:16.360 --> 45:27.720]  So I like getting really good shit and making some F2s and making something that I really love that I'm sitting in my jar, like my jar.
[45:27.720 --> 45:28.920]  What does that say?
[45:28.920 --> 45:31.240]  That's fucking bacon grease right there, man.
[45:31.240 --> 45:31.800]  Right.
[45:31.800 --> 45:32.600]  It's my shit.
[45:32.600 --> 45:34.120]  You know, so it's in my jar.
[45:34.120 --> 45:34.680]  I'm smoking it.
[45:35.240 --> 45:36.600]  I have some of that at home.
[45:37.480 --> 45:39.720]  So, I mean, this is the number 12.
[45:39.720 --> 45:41.160]  This is my favorite one right here.
[45:41.160 --> 45:42.200]  I'll have to get you some of this.
[45:42.200 --> 45:44.600]  This one's at number 12, the tall spear.
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.200]  This one's the this one's the resin fucking arms.
[45:50.200 --> 45:50.760]  Pretty bad.
[45:50.760 --> 45:52.440]  That's the one I made the F2 with, you know.
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.720]  So, yeah, that's what I like.
[45:55.720 --> 45:56.920]  And I like giving that out.
[45:56.920 --> 45:59.080]  And then somebody might find something better than what I got.
[45:59.080 --> 46:00.920]  And I'm like, yeah, dude.
[46:00.920 --> 46:03.880]  And then they can play with that or run with that.
[46:03.880 --> 46:05.800]  And that's fun because they like the chase.
[46:06.120 --> 46:09.160]  And it's all about the chase for me, you know.
[46:09.160 --> 46:15.800]  But I have definite focus to make things, you know, it is what it is.
[46:15.800 --> 46:18.920]  But I like I like I like to chase.
[46:18.920 --> 46:21.800]  I'll always be making crosses that are just like, what the fuck?
[46:21.800 --> 46:22.920]  What's going to come out of this?
[46:22.920 --> 46:24.200]  You know, I love that.
[46:24.200 --> 46:25.320]  That's like fucking fun.
[46:26.440 --> 46:29.160]  Well, it's like I mean, for me, it's like music.
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.000]  Like I used to DJ a lot.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.440]  And, you know, I didn't want to play like all the big club hits in the top 40 songs.
[46:36.440 --> 46:40.920]  I wanted to find cool shit that no one had ever heard and introduce.
[46:40.920 --> 46:45.400]  And if you can get people like bopping their heads to shit they've never heard before
[46:46.040 --> 46:52.280]  and they trust you like or they're on the dance floor, if it's like a more like a club like.
[46:53.560 --> 46:54.600]  That's a good feeling.
[46:56.280 --> 46:58.840]  Versus being like, here's the Drake song.
[46:58.840 --> 47:05.480]  And here you like here's every top 40 hip hop song and like every EDM like house anthem and every,
[47:06.600 --> 47:07.320]  you know, whatever.
[47:09.880 --> 47:11.480]  Totally agree with that, man.
[47:11.480 --> 47:12.040]  That's it.
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.360]  I got I have an old CD case full of shit that like, who the fuck is this?
[47:16.360 --> 47:19.080]  You know, it's like, yeah, that's never heard of this.
[47:20.040 --> 47:25.880]  It's funny because like I tried to DJ a couple of times here.
[47:25.880 --> 47:31.000]  Like actually Nick, he was supposed to DJ one night and then he had technical difficulties.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.560]  And I was like, fuck it, I'll DJ.
[47:34.840 --> 47:40.440]  And I started playing stuff, but I want to get all my vinyl from Rhode Island.
[47:42.040 --> 47:44.360]  It's all in my parents basement right now.
[47:44.360 --> 47:45.400]  And they're begging me.
[47:45.400 --> 47:48.600]  They've been begging me for like 20 years to get it out of their basement.
[47:48.600 --> 47:49.400]  I'm like, yeah, I don't know.
[47:50.200 --> 47:51.800]  But I have to ship it all to L.A.
[47:51.800 --> 47:58.760]  But in that collection, there's all this shit that's like Shazam would never pick it up.
[47:58.760 --> 48:03.640]  Or like the YouTube, like they wouldn't recognize any of these songs.
[48:04.680 --> 48:07.480]  And so I want to start playing that stuff.
[48:07.480 --> 48:10.120]  Be like, all right, let's have our musical interlude.
[48:11.400 --> 48:12.920]  Yeah, I had an old couple.
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.120]  I used to take care of their orchard and taught them about their trees.
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.560]  And they became like my grandparents for a lot of years.
[48:19.560 --> 48:22.360]  And they ended up, you know, Meyer ended up dying.
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.040]  He gave me his record collection and I've never owned a record player.
[48:26.840 --> 48:30.120]  You know, I have appreciation for records, but I never had that.
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.000]  So like I had all these records in there that I had never heard of.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  It was like the craziest, most ridiculously old music.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.800]  And lately I'm dusting off some of that stuff.
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.480]  And, you know, it's radical.
[48:45.480 --> 48:47.160]  So we'll have to link you up.
[48:47.240 --> 48:54.520]  Even stuff like I used to love playing like Ray Charles, I Got a Woman.
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.240]  And then Kanye West came out with his song.
[48:57.240 --> 48:59.160]  And I was like, fuck, because I used to play that.
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.440]  And people would be like, oh, my God, this Ray Charles song I can dance to.
[49:02.440 --> 49:03.240]  And it's awesome.
[49:03.240 --> 49:05.480]  And like, good choice, DJ.
[49:10.680 --> 49:11.400]  I do. Yeah.
[49:13.160 --> 49:14.200]  I, people, I.
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.320]  Yeah, I do have techniques.
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.160]  And I actually chat, I reached out to Thievery Corporation to be like,
[49:21.160 --> 49:25.080]  do you guys want to play on a weed YouTube channel?
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.520]  A bunch of appreciative stoners who would enjoy your music.
[49:32.280 --> 49:34.120]  Yeah, Thievery Corporation.
[49:36.600 --> 49:39.160]  I mean, I like a lot of I like everything.
[49:39.160 --> 49:40.680]  There's good music and everything.
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.280]  Like, I like a lot of old school Jamaican dub.
[49:44.280 --> 49:45.880]  I like old hip hop.
[49:46.840 --> 49:47.960]  I'm not really that big.
[49:47.960 --> 49:49.400]  If it sounds good, it is good.
[49:49.400 --> 49:50.200]  You know what I mean?
[49:50.200 --> 49:50.760]  That's true.
[49:51.640 --> 49:53.080]  It is, you know, sounds good.
[49:53.080 --> 49:53.880]  It is good, you know.
[49:53.880 --> 49:56.120]  Don't make it complicated.
[49:56.120 --> 49:57.560]  Smokes good, it is good, you know.
[49:57.560 --> 49:58.120]  Yeah.
[49:59.480 --> 50:01.000]  Cruder and Dorfmeister.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.320]  Yeah, someone's talking about Thievery Corporation.
[50:04.200 --> 50:05.640]  Cruder and Dorfmeister.
[50:07.640 --> 50:08.200]  Lee Perry.
[50:12.170 --> 50:14.570]  But was so good.
[50:14.730 --> 50:22.170]  But, well, so Tyler, you have, speaking of some of the stuff you were showing off,
[50:22.170 --> 50:23.690]  you have some seeds, right?
[50:24.650 --> 50:28.090]  Yeah, there's still a couple of packs.
[50:28.090 --> 50:30.090]  You got some packs.
[50:30.810 --> 50:33.130]  Over there on Dogged.love.
[50:34.570 --> 50:35.370]  There's not many.
[50:36.250 --> 50:41.690]  There'll be another, you know, another Baking Grease F2 drop, you know, later on.
[50:42.170 --> 50:45.770]  Not for a little while, but what's there is there.
[50:46.570 --> 50:51.370]  Peter, a long while back, he said, hey, when those are ready, I want them.
[50:51.370 --> 50:53.770]  So we're gonna, we put them up.
[50:53.770 --> 50:55.050]  So we got them up there.
[50:55.050 --> 50:58.490]  There's also the thing I'm really excited about.
[50:59.690 --> 51:04.730]  I popped, immediately when I popped the F2 generation of the Baking Grease, was the Bacon Dog.
[51:06.330 --> 51:09.530]  Anybody who knows me knows that I like to, I love the Dog Walker.
[51:09.610 --> 51:14.490]  And I decided, shit, man, I pulled out that Master Baking Grease stud that I loved.
[51:14.490 --> 51:16.090]  It was one of the sneakiest in the garden.
[51:16.730 --> 51:17.850]  He hit everything else.
[51:17.850 --> 51:21.370]  So I, of course, it hits the Dog Walker.
[51:21.370 --> 51:24.570]  So that made the Bacon Dog.
[51:25.370 --> 51:26.810]  Seeds came out beautiful.
[51:27.610 --> 51:29.210]  It's really cool, really interesting.
[51:29.210 --> 51:33.210]  Like the Bacon Dog seeds are, they're smaller.
[51:33.210 --> 51:37.610]  They look like more of a, like a Congo.
[51:38.570 --> 51:42.810]  Like a Congo friggin' land race seed, you know, like size-wise, they're pretty cool.
[51:42.810 --> 51:48.410]  They're a little bit smaller, really dark, really awesome, killer stuff.
[51:48.410 --> 51:49.450]  There wasn't a lot of them.
[51:49.450 --> 51:51.130]  It was a small Dog Walker clone.
[51:51.130 --> 51:55.210]  So I was just kind of an extra, hey, we gotta do this because I love the Dog Walker.
[51:55.210 --> 51:57.770]  And you know, who doesn't want Bacon Grease and Dog Walker together?
[51:58.570 --> 52:00.890]  So that was the Bacon Dog.
[52:00.890 --> 52:05.050]  Bacon Dog plants are coming out crazy, stouty and just nasty.
[52:05.050 --> 52:06.330]  They just fucking reek.
[52:06.330 --> 52:08.490]  A lot of reekage in veg.
[52:09.450 --> 52:10.650]  Cool technique that I do.
[52:10.650 --> 52:12.410]  I try to tell everybody it's kind of funny.
[52:13.370 --> 52:15.850]  Dirt Man Dan was making fun of me the other day about it.
[52:15.850 --> 52:18.810]  But you know, in addition, you know, your Stead Rub and stuff.
[52:19.370 --> 52:25.130]  I'm always ripping off a fan leaf and I'm smelling the blood, the chlorophyll of what's
[52:25.130 --> 52:25.850]  coming out of there.
[52:26.570 --> 52:33.210]  And in a lot of my stuff, you'll get some funky stuff coming out of there.
[52:33.210 --> 52:39.930]  You'll get some really sharp, rancid, skunky, sharp, pickly garlic stuff.
[52:39.930 --> 52:43.210]  You'll get some fruity stuff and some smells like nothing.
[52:43.210 --> 52:44.090]  Some smells like plant.
[52:44.810 --> 52:47.290]  A lot of stuff smells like plant and you waste your time.
[52:47.290 --> 52:49.850]  But I found some crazy superstars.
[52:49.850 --> 52:54.970]  Pam 15 was one of the ones that kind of stood out to me early when I was doing that stuff
[52:54.970 --> 52:55.610]  to her.
[52:55.610 --> 52:58.170]  And she turned out to be a keeper of mine.
[52:58.170 --> 53:02.650]  And so, yeah, so when you're running my stuff, that's just one of the things I'm always doing.
[53:02.650 --> 53:03.370]  You should do it too.
[53:03.370 --> 53:03.770]  It's fun.
[53:04.570 --> 53:07.610]  Rip off one of them family, smell the blood, smell the chlorophyll.
[53:07.610 --> 53:08.810]  It smells really, really good.
[53:08.810 --> 53:12.490]  You eat it, you taste it, you know, it's kind of morbid, but it's delicious.
[53:13.850 --> 53:17.210]  Only one molecule different in chlorophyll in our blood.
[53:17.210 --> 53:20.890]  It's the oxygen and nitrogen, you know, so they're just like you and me, man.
[53:20.890 --> 53:21.690]  It's doing the same thing.
[53:22.330 --> 53:24.250]  You know, it's got the same function for the most part.
[53:24.250 --> 53:25.690]  So pretty cool.
[53:26.570 --> 53:28.170]  Bacon dogs, stout.
[53:28.810 --> 53:34.890]  They're less lesser of the of the tall jumpiness of your bacon grease, your bacon grease, you're
[53:34.890 --> 53:41.450]  tall, you're stretchy, you're branchy, you're heavy yielding, your spears, a lot of cool
[53:41.450 --> 53:44.890]  Pam 15 traits, some cushiness.
[53:46.010 --> 53:47.290]  That was a funny story.
[53:47.290 --> 53:50.570]  My wife, I brought in this jar number 12.
[53:50.570 --> 53:51.130]  I love this.
[53:51.130 --> 53:54.330]  This is I love this one that I made here.
[53:54.330 --> 54:00.330]  And I put it in the in the little smoke room and my wife comes in and she has two other
[54:00.330 --> 54:01.370]  jars that I put in there.
[54:01.370 --> 54:07.850]  You know, there's some there's some Pam F3 and there's some some regular dog walker.
[54:07.850 --> 54:11.610]  And there was a couple of other things, some SFE stuff and some weird stuff that we did.
[54:12.650 --> 54:18.970]  And I put this jar kind of hidden behind the this little box, you know, you know, kind
[54:18.970 --> 54:20.170]  of selfishly.
[54:20.170 --> 54:25.610]  And I keep finding this jar pulled out in all the other jars, which is like, hey, what's
[54:25.610 --> 54:26.170]  going on?
[54:26.170 --> 54:26.970]  You keep getting in.
[54:26.970 --> 54:28.570]  She's like, I like that bacon grease.
[54:28.570 --> 54:30.250]  I'm like, I know I like it, too.
[54:30.250 --> 54:31.450]  And it was just a funny thing.
[54:31.450 --> 54:33.210]  But it's tall, it's stretchy.
[54:33.850 --> 54:34.570]  It's good smoke.
[54:35.210 --> 54:35.710]  Happy.
[54:36.730 --> 54:41.610]  The bacon dogs are very dog walker frame and very mean.
[54:42.570 --> 54:47.850]  Lots and lots of extra frost, lots of extra turps coming off, especially in veg.
[54:48.650 --> 54:54.490]  You can see a couple of pictures of them out of the small group that I've that I got going
[54:54.490 --> 54:55.450]  a bunch of one gallons.
[54:55.450 --> 55:00.170]  We didn't, you know, me and my buddy and his friend did some one gallons of them to try
[55:00.170 --> 55:01.610]  to try to look at them.
[55:01.610 --> 55:08.970]  They were all pretty cool, very kind of dog walker ish on bud structure and kind of very
[55:08.970 --> 55:10.090]  cameras and content.
[55:10.970 --> 55:11.770]  It's a good one, man.
[55:12.410 --> 55:14.410]  So there's a couple of those packs up there.
[55:14.410 --> 55:16.090]  And then there's some sports bra up there.
[55:16.090 --> 55:17.610]  So we had to put some more sports bra.
[55:17.610 --> 55:18.330]  Those went away.
[55:19.050 --> 55:21.530]  Those everybody picked those ones up.
[55:21.530 --> 55:28.250]  And the sports bra is a Munson Pam one, the first generation stud from the Pam.
[55:29.050 --> 55:32.650]  And yeah, everything's been awesome.
[55:32.650 --> 55:35.930]  I mean, Munson do key, you know, he puts in the work.
[55:37.290 --> 55:38.410]  It's skunk.
[55:38.410 --> 55:40.330]  There's body odor in there.
[55:40.330 --> 55:42.490]  They're excellent outdoor plants.
[55:43.050 --> 55:47.690]  Extreme yielders, but they got some good turps.
[55:48.410 --> 55:51.770]  There's been some talk of some resin males being found in there.
[55:51.770 --> 55:57.690]  There's been some keepers that have been run to three times out of the batch of seeds that
[55:57.690 --> 56:00.330]  a single batch of, you know, pack of seeds out there.
[56:00.330 --> 56:03.050]  I've got nothing but good reports on sports bra.
[56:03.930 --> 56:05.370]  That's got two different mommies.
[56:05.930 --> 56:11.610]  That's got a Munson seven female, which is dumped in hash.
[56:12.250 --> 56:17.930]  It was an excellent washer, body odor, funk, garlic, just a killer fucking plant.
[56:18.650 --> 56:22.650]  And it was more tall, got the frame.
[56:22.650 --> 56:24.250]  And it wasn't weak.
[56:24.250 --> 56:25.530]  It was very sturdy.
[56:25.530 --> 56:30.170]  It held the weight, but it had a frame, you know, you need to cage that bad boy.
[56:30.810 --> 56:34.410]  And then the other phenotype that was prominent was the short, squatty,
[56:35.290 --> 56:37.210]  northern light dominant type thing.
[56:37.450 --> 56:42.730]  Heavy indica, little extra leafy, but just nasty little gas, little gas rag plants.
[56:43.770 --> 56:47.530]  I selected one of those type and then I selected the Munson seven,
[56:48.330 --> 56:50.090]  pollinated them both with the same male.
[56:51.050 --> 56:54.010]  And then those are the seeds in sports bra.
[56:54.010 --> 56:58.170]  So you get a little diversity there and the two cool females with the pan.
[56:58.170 --> 57:00.970]  So those are pretty, pretty cool plants.
[57:00.970 --> 57:01.930]  Got it.
[57:01.930 --> 57:05.770]  So just quickly, I got to go put my two year old in her bed.
[57:05.770 --> 57:07.930]  So I'm going to throw a question at you guys.
[57:10.410 --> 57:14.490]  And then if you guys can handle it for five minutes without me.
[57:23.830 --> 57:25.110]  And Trevor, you are muted.
[57:27.110 --> 57:28.070]  Trevor, you're muted.
[57:29.910 --> 57:31.270]  Trevor, you are muted.
[57:31.270 --> 57:32.310]  Trevor's mute.
[57:35.270 --> 57:36.150]  Yeah, go ahead.
[57:36.150 --> 57:37.670]  You got anybody else want to talk to me?
[57:39.430 --> 57:40.470]  Trevor, you're mute.
[57:40.470 --> 57:41.510]  Can you wait?
[57:41.510 --> 57:42.630]  You guys can hear me, right?
[57:43.510 --> 57:43.750]  Yeah.
[57:44.550 --> 57:45.750]  Trevor, now you're unmuted.
[57:46.310 --> 57:47.350]  Okay, go for it.
[57:47.350 --> 57:47.910]  I'll be back.
[57:48.710 --> 57:48.950]  Cool.
[57:50.150 --> 57:54.310]  The reason you're going to want to use something like an old Afghani one line
[57:54.310 --> 57:56.710]  is because it's particularly inbred.
[57:57.350 --> 58:00.790]  The Afghani one line was something that Mel Frank brought
[58:01.510 --> 58:06.870]  and he transferred it over to Dave Watts and Dave Watson then brought it over to Amsterdam.
[58:06.870 --> 58:10.710]  It's something that's been highly inbred over many, many generations.
[58:11.670 --> 58:16.070]  And on top of that, it was land-raised genetics to begin with.
[58:16.070 --> 58:20.710]  Now, land-raised genetics are not highly homozygous or stabilized,
[58:20.710 --> 58:24.790]  but they are highly acclimatized to their ecotype.
[58:24.790 --> 58:31.430]  So while they may not be absolutely like an inbred line,
[58:31.430 --> 58:37.190]  they are, however, very stable and they're very uniform in their yield outputs,
[58:37.830 --> 58:40.310]  particularly in kind of marginal conditions.
[58:40.630 --> 58:44.710]  That's kind of why land-raised genetics are the way that they are.
[58:44.710 --> 58:49.430]  They've developed to be in an equilibrium in a particular environment
[58:49.430 --> 58:52.790]  and survive and produce well in that environment.
[58:54.630 --> 59:01.030]  So those genetics, which were taken and were inbred for quite a number of generations
[59:01.030 --> 59:07.990]  subsequent to making it to the United States, are a good selection because they're very homozygous.
[59:07.990 --> 59:11.510]  The term that breeders will use is highly prepotent.
[59:12.070 --> 59:18.870]  So if you're taking something that's like an F7 or F10, it's very, very homozygous.
[59:19.430 --> 59:24.070]  It's just based off of the theoretical averages.
[59:24.070 --> 59:30.710]  You're reaching 80 to 90% or greater homozygosity in your line by the time you've reached F7.
[59:30.710 --> 59:36.150]  So then when you outcross that, it's going to outcross in a very predictable way,
[59:36.150 --> 59:41.030]  even if the thing that you're outcrossing it to is a polyhybrid clusterfuck.
[59:41.670 --> 59:47.270]  While you will have greater variation because of the polyhybrid clusterfuck,
[59:47.270 --> 59:52.550]  you're going to have less because you're not polyclusterfucking polyclusterfucking.
[59:52.550 --> 59:58.870]  So that's really why you're going to want to use something like a stabilized inbred line
[59:58.870 --> 01:00:04.790]  that's gotten to ideally something like F7 or F10 to do your outcrossing with
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.870]  and use as a breeding line.
[01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:14.150]  That also is going to give you plants that when you do see the outliers on there,
[01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:18.310]  it's going to let you recognize what's coming from the plant that you crossed into it,
[01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:23.670]  even if it is a polyhybrid because of how dominant those plants are going to breed from being so
[01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:29.510]  inbred. The fact that you could add like an SFVOG to Afghani number one, and you're going to see
[01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:35.030]  the outliers from the SFV real easily, even though they're going to show up more rare.
[01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.190]  The terpene profile and such might come across, but you're going to get a lot of the structure
[01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:45.990]  from that inbred line to come across quite a bit. And very often, like if you use deep chunk from
[01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:52.310]  Tom Hill's work or the Afghani number one, or some of the hazes or some Colombian lines out there,
[01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:56.390]  you put those into these polyhybrid lines and you're going to get a lot of phenotypes that
[01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:01.910]  show up as those homozygous lines that are showing all those dominant traits. This way,
[01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:07.270]  you're going to be able to pull out the, if you want to see, say you put green crack in the
[01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.910]  Tom Hill's deep chunk, you're going to get a whole bunch of deep chunk that comes out of there,
[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:16.310]  which in my opinion is better for breeding. But if you want to start line breeding towards
[01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:20.870]  something that's going to be a different structure of green crack, but with a different terpene
[01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:26.070]  profile, you'll be able to see that easily by using those plants that are already highly inbred.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:31.990]  That's why you should pick up seed lines from people that are true breeding lines. If you do
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:36.710]  want to do real breeding that way, if you want to just line breed in different directions though,
[01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:41.990]  F2s like Mr. Tree's tells you guys about is an awesome way to go because you get a different
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:46.630]  plant out of every seed that's easy to see out of those. That way, when you pop that open,
[01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.310]  you're going to see the parental lines, the grandparent lines. You might even see some
[01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:55.990]  plants that start to throw up an atavism on you, what are older lines that pop up from the,
[01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:59.510]  that weren't even expressed maybe in the grandparent line. It's something from that
[01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:04.710]  out of the genotype, but isn't bred into that line. So say maybe they're all green and suddenly
[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:10.230]  one plant out of a thousand turns out like magenta or something. This could be an atavistic trait
[01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:15.510]  that came from one of the grandparents of that line. That's why popping large populations of
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:21.350]  seeds is where you find the outliers. And don't just rely on seeing like a leaf shape in the
[01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:25.110]  first three or four sets of leaves. Because I see a lot of cats out there, they'll pop seeds.
[01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.870]  The plant will be about this tall and they're already claiming it's a mutant because the leaf
[01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:36.550]  looks a little deformed because the pericarp on the shell was so tight around the damn seed
[01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:41.830]  that it just kind of deformed some of that leaf as it was popping out. So you have to pop enough
[01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:45.350]  seeds out of lines to find out if you actually do have the true mutant out of there. Then you
[01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:49.910]  have to breed with it to see if it starts to pass that as a dominant or recessive trait.
[01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:56.070]  It takes numbers. It takes time. It takes patience. It doesn't take a lot of skill until you build
[01:02:56.070 --> 01:03:00.390]  that up. But in the beginning, if you just listen to everybody else that's doing it correctly,
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:05.030]  you can start from the beginning spot very easily and line breed your own stuff from something
[01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:10.150]  someone else already used into a direction that's completely different than everyone else because of
[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:19.670]  your own personal taste. That's how we got thornless cacti and white blackberries and stuff.
[01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:23.910]  Somebody saw an interest in a plant that no one else did and used the same genetics already
[01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:29.190]  available to us and we end up going in a direction no one else thought of ever going. You become a
[01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:35.510]  person that's an expert in breeding to other people because of the small experiments you did
[01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:40.230]  in your own garden. That's how you take all these other people's work and make your own work
[01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:46.230]  work better for you. Stop using all these polyhybrid lines that you think are inbred
[01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:51.830]  just because they were cousins and start using genetic lines that breed true. Just because the
[01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:56.230]  name on the pack says the two brothers and sisters was used does not mean those lines
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:01.590]  are going to read true for anything other than the name on the pack. You have to understand that
[01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:07.270]  when you buy them. Don't get mad at the breeder when you think the breeder has unlocked in traits.
[01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:13.110]  Each one of those plants is carrying a combination of close to 30,000 genetic combinations it can
[01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:18.230]  pass in breeding from the male or the female or your two females you use or two males be it.
[01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:25.830]  There's no way for any breeder to lock all those in without multiple generations of cross breeding
[01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:30.470]  and inbreeding, selfing, knowing what they're actually doing with the plant in high amount
[01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:39.910]  of numbers. If you have an Afghani and you're trying to find that to breed it to
[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:47.030]  contiguate, I always, well not always, but I like to look for plants that are
[01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:51.830]  completely opposite in growth pattern and growth shape. That way when you breed
[01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:59.590]  your Afghani to this fucking tall ass, behemoth, land race thing or not land race
[01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:05.830]  but a taller sativa type plant or a stretchy thing or a funny leaf shape or you pick
[01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:11.350]  something that's completely different, you can pick out the offspring easier in the
[01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.710]  generations because you're looking for the short, squatty ones. And all the ones that are
[01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:19.670]  fucking short and squatty are going to be more likely the ones you should keep your eyes on.
[01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:24.310]  Complete opposites are a friend of mine a lot of times.
[01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:33.830]  So the question about how to select for quantitative traits has been coming up a lot.
[01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:42.470]  Benjamin's been asking it. So there are a number of ways that you can select for a quantitative
[01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:54.470]  trait loci. THC is a QTL. So we have all collectively selected for THC simply by
[01:05:54.470 --> 01:06:00.950]  smoking cannabis and getting very high off of it and being like, yeah, that's the one.
[01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:09.910]  And doing that year after year after year after year. And all sorts of like, the one
[01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:16.710]  is the new flavor of the month, you know, with clone only is going around. Many of us have had,
[01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:25.270]  you know, the GMO is throwing lots of 30s out. The ChemD is throwing 30s out. Those OG ChemD
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:33.830]  crosses are throwing 30s out. There's a number of things that have a particular QTL that is
[01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:41.270]  throwing incredibly high concentrations of THC. Now, we only got there through a process of
[01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:49.430]  identifying individuals that were particularly high THC individuals, saving those individuals,
[01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:56.070]  and then breeding those individuals with other high THC individuals, and doing that recursively
[01:06:56.070 --> 01:07:04.390]  for the last 30 years. And so by getting the additive variants of additional,
[01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:13.750]  like, you know, we found the D. And it's like, okay, the D has a super high cannabinoid
[01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:19.590]  content. We found the SFV, we crossed those together, we got the motor breath, okay,
[01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:29.190]  those have it. The cluster fuck that is the Gorilla Glue line, all of, you know, the chocolate
[01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:38.070]  diesel, the cysts, the whatever, the sourdough, like the whole all the different like, chems and
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:42.950]  a few other outliers that came together to make the Gorilla Glue, that's throwing 30s. There's
[01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:51.350]  other things that seem to have this particular QTL. And we've just passed all those around to
[01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:56.710]  each other. I know like my breeding when the question was, what was my breeding strategies?
[01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:02.390]  My breeding strategies for a long time, like during the medical process, when I was like,
[01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:07.270]  working with clubs, and I had really cheap access to testing because I was getting it through
[01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:14.390]  different clubs, I was able to do a lot of cannabinoid testing at like, stupid cheap prices.
[01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:21.430]  So I did a lot of it. And every year I selected for the thing that had the most content of the
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:27.590]  things, whatever it was, if it's THC, I'm like, okay, here's the thing that's got the most THC,
[01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:33.510]  if it was CBD, here's the thing that's got the most CBD. If there was like a really particular,
[01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:39.590]  unique terpian profile, I was like, well, fuck, okay, this one's got that terp profile. So I'm
[01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:44.550]  now going to breed with this one to try and see what happens when I cross this terp profile with
[01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:52.550]  another profile and see if I can start to really magnify terps on terps on terps. And so that was
[01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:59.590]  just polyhybrid pollen chucking. I don't know. I mean, like I had the books, but it's not like I
[01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:06.630]  was like, super serious about breeding in the way of like, I'm a scientist and I'm going to create
[01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:12.790]  you know, an inbred line and an F1 hybrid and it's going to, you know, comport to these standards
[01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:21.350]  that are determined by different, you know, academics or governing bodies that figure these
[01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:25.990]  things out. So first I was just pollen chucking doing that kind of shit and selecting based off
[01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:30.630]  of those purpose or those sorts of things. I think everybody else was also doing that.
[01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:38.870]  And so we were able to get particular traits and magnify them. I mean, we've taken plants that were,
[01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:45.990]  fuck, we look at the old land races, we've pretty much gotten everything down to about
[01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:55.270]  eight to at most 12 weeks. It's all frosty as fuck. It's very, very potent. And it lunks.
[01:09:56.070 --> 01:10:04.790]  You get fucking weight off of a lot of shit. And those traits are traits that we've continually
[01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:11.430]  selected for collectively in this mass sort of breeding experiment, where we were just people
[01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:18.310]  fucking going about our thing, being like that one. That's good. And then sharing that with some
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:24.790]  other people and being like, ah, I had an accident and there was some, you know, seeds were made,
[01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:31.990]  or like I did a thing and some seeds were made and or like, hey, I'm actually fucking really
[01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:36.550]  hella into this stuff. And I'm DJ short and I'm going to actually like line braid and create
[01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:42.150]  separate pure lines from like four or five building blocks that are my initial starting point.
[01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:47.590]  I'm only going to work this shit for the next 30 years. And like the fact that they did that,
[01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:54.550]  and that other people have done that, and that we've all just kind of shared this shit together.
[01:10:54.550 --> 01:11:02.390]  That's how we've gotten the QTLs that produce the traits that we really all desire and have.
[01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:09.030]  Now, how do you do that in a specific breeding program? Now, the best way to do that is to
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:13.830]  deploy breeding strategies that are going to get you to the end goal that you want. And the only
[01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:18.390]  way you're going to find that out is if you do it because like the dudes that fucking invented
[01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:26.070]  backcross breeding, the whole reason they did it, Harlan and Pope, they wanted to take some rough
[01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:32.470]  on like fucking rough seeded barley, and they wanted to make it smooth seeded barley. And they
[01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:37.270]  made an F2 hybrid with some Manchurian barley with their commercial variety of barley that they were
[01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:44.470]  growing here in the States. And they tried to line breed it, they did enormous population selection,
[01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:49.510]  but the heritability of the trait in the F2s was just so low that you couldn't possibly find
[01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:58.630]  the actual characteristic in any of the fucking F2 or the different line breeding. So they said,
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:02.870]  fuck, this doesn't work, what are we going to do? And so then they decided to make a backcross.
[01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:10.550]  And they took the initial barley that they had, the Manchurian barley made an F1 hybrid,
[01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:17.430]  and then recurse recurrently selected a offspring to breed back to the original
[01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:22.950]  recurrent parent, selecting constantly for that single trait that they wanted,
[01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:29.030]  while trying to get that single trait intergrossed into the trait that they wanted. That was a
[01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:37.350]  single trait. Now, I do believe that was a QTL. It was even if it wasn't a QTL, it was a trait of
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:42.550]  such low heritability, it was necessary for them to use this method as opposed to another method.
[01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:51.190]  And so that's just what we got to do. What is our trait? Okay. I got this plant, and I got this
[01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:57.830]  plant, and I want to accomplish this goal. We have our germ plasm, and I don't care what it is.
[01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:03.360]  Well, hey, now.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:05.920]  Holy cow.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.480]  Peter comes in and we leave him.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.080]  I'm back.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.280]  Right. Yeah, he's right.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.760]  Trevor, whatever you were saying, it was amazing. And then you cut out.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:24.560]  I'm going to run back. My two-year-old, we have this thing where I come into her crib, and she's
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.400]  like, five minutes, and then it's like another three minutes, and then another two minutes. So
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.080]  I got to go back up. But anyway, keep going.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:05.200]  Afghan this or some land race that. I'm not Dave Watson 30 years ago with access to these
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:13.440]  round work genetics. Who the fuck am I? I'm just some kid in California. It turned out I was a kid
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.200]  in California with access to a lot of fucking fire genetics that I just let slip away or that I just
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:28.000]  hybridized the fuck out of. And they're gone. Whatever that, the Urkel crosses that were made,
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.120]  the OG crosses that were made, yeah, they've got some of the traits, but they're not the thing.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:43.200]  And it's cool that I did it, and I bred, and I enjoy the things that I have. But don't let the
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:52.000]  idea of, oh, you're not a breeder, stop you. Just fucking make seeds, make selections, and
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.480]  continuously select for the things that you think are desirable and produce the outcomes and results
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.520]  that you want. And you're going to find, just as we all did collectively, that like, oh, fuck,
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:11.120]  that kind of worked. We concentrated all sorts of cannabinoids, which is not a simple Mendelian
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:19.840]  trait. First, D. Mehar back in 2004 came out with his study trying to explain the inheritance of THC
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.600]  and CBD, and he had a theory of codominance, and the theory of codominance that he explained
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.440]  seemed to make sense. It was kind of a simpler explanation of the phenomenon as he was seeing it.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:40.080]  And he also made like a caveat, like, hey, I could be totally wrong, and this could actually be a QTL
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:47.040]  and not actually some Mendelian trait that's inherited according to a more complex codominant
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:55.120]  inheritance model. And sure enough, they, you know, another study by Van Backel came out, I think,
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:02.720]  like, I don't know, some years later, in the last 10 years, I believe. And it was like, yeah, here's a QTL.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:10.240]  And then McKernan and those cats over at Medicinal Genomics, they did more work and have really, like,
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:17.760]  figured out the entire THC and cannabinoid synthase sort of, like, genome. And the work that he published
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:24.880]  or talked about in 2019 at their study really showed what we've done. And it's a word, I'll
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.680]  fucking butcher it because it's some crazy genetics, fucking science word, but there's, like,
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:37.840]  re-transposedons or some fucking shit. Like, I just totally butchered that, but whatever, not a scientist.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.960]  The fucking, essentially, it's like a cut and paste sort of function in a genome that it's kind of what
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:52.080]  we did, like, the way we upregulated synthase for THC was, like, by constantly selecting for this
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:17:00.480]  copy and paste gene that kept showing up and encoding for THC. Now, we lost a lot of the minor
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:07.840]  cannabinoids in the process. So there used to be in other, you know, more land-racy varieties,
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:16.000]  you would have more CBC, CDLs, you know, all the different cannabinoids. And those got lost as we
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:24.320]  upregulated for THC. Now, we can do the same thing with those other cannabinoids and select for those
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.400]  and upregulate for those cannabinoids the same way that organ CBD and anybody who's doing hemp
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:40.560]  breeding right now where, you know, CBG, THC, CBD, fucking THC delta 8, like, all of, we can use the
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:47.760]  same techniques to upregulate for other minor cannabinoids. You just need the germ plasm.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:54.160]  You gotta have something with the genes. You can't just invent them. And then you need to
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:00.320]  recurrently select over many generations for the thing. And you can be hybridizing,
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:08.560]  or you can be line breeding, selfing, full-sib, you can do cousins, you can do half-sibs,
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:14.560]  like, there's all sorts of different breeding models. But the thing is the constant selection
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:22.880]  for the trait under selection, you know, you gotta be like, I want this trait, and I wanna repeat it.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.640]  If it's multiple traits, it's like, I want this trait, this trait, and this trait, and go to work.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:37.760]  And the results are incredible. Like, even just pollen chuffing, you get great results.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:46.800]  Like, just do the work, make the crosses, grow them out, and, you know, you will find that
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:54.560]  your ability to select cannabis that works in your environment is something you're probably
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:02.240]  best qualified to do. You shouldn't buy other people's seeds. Everybody else's seeds, like,
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.840]  I'm always fucking tied to, like, Chuck, get every seed you can get, you know, and grow them,
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.760]  because everybody's seeds are fire. Like, I get so much fire from so many cats, and it's one of
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:21.680]  those things that, like, it's worth the risk and the cost of, you know, taking the ride.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.680]  CHRIS BROADFOOT If you don't have a lot of space,
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.080]  and you need to do selections, and you wanna breed something, like, just like he said, don't,
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.120]  you know, don't stop. Breed everything you can. Breed everything you can. So, if you only got,
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:43.920]  if you can only do 10 plants, look at 10 plants, make some seeds, make a whole bunch of seeds,
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.080]  grow 10 plants, select your best out of that 10 plants, kill the rest, plant 10 more seeds,
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:56.560]  or plant nine seeds, select the best, kill that one, or kill the other one if that one is better
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:02.640]  than the other one, and you can either keep one or two, and you work that same pile of seeds
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.120]  to actually look at the entire population, you know, 10 at a time. And there's something to be
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.680]  said about being able to keep your eyes on something. Like, if you're looking at 3,000
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.400]  plants, it's hard to look at every single one and pay attention to every single one and see
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:22.960]  every single one for what it is. But if you're looking at 10, 20, you know, 25, 6, whatever it
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.440]  is, you can pay attention to each one to kind of learn them, you know, more intimately. Select the
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:35.600]  best, kill the rest, plant more out of that same group, select the best, and you start breeding the
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.600]  best of the best out of there together. And then you've got that batch of seeds, you can start
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.160]  doing that same thing over and over and over again. And you know, you can back cross to what
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.960]  you're keeping, you can keep those generations, but you're doing it 10 at a time instead of
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.240]  thinking that you're looking down the tunnel that I have to plant 1,000 plants, you know what I mean?
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.480]  So if you can, fucking do it, because that's the best way to go. You can look at everything, and
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.320]  that's great. You can keep your eyes on it, you know, numbers of the game. But you know, if you
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.480]  want to do it, you want to put some heart into it, you want to really look at something, you know,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:12.000]  something to be said about, you know, 10 at a time, 20 at a time, you know what I mean? So that's good stuff, you know.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.840]  Yeah, man. Like they're talking about back crossing and stuff. I've done it, I've back crossed him
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:30.000]  through an out cross. I used a blue cheese back in 2006, I believe it was. The blue cheese I used
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.840]  to cross him out to the angel. And I made a line, this is it right here called space cheese.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.200]  I know it's going to be hard to see, but this space cheese is the line I'm working right now.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.880]  But with that space cheese, I used him to make my original angel back cross number two. It was my
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.680]  second angel back cross that I made to the public. And from there, I took that same plant, and from
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:55.280]  the progeny, I continually back crossed the angel male. I did that six different times where I ended
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:03.280]  up with angel back into the line seven different times to get the line I wanted from him to breed
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.440]  true for what I'm using him for. Like other people want to even dig into anybody's stuff. So like he
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.440]  was saying here earlier, there's fine with everything. You don't have to use two breeding
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:18.160]  strains right away. You can take a polyhybrid and use that to line breed into something that can
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.600]  true breed if you do enough time with that plant. You don't have to start with land-raised stuff.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.040]  The only reason you're starting with that land-raised stuff is you're going to get into
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.160]  the cannabinoids and the terpenoids that we've lost, that we gave up through fucking locking
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.360]  into we only want this one profile for smell, and we want this one structure for growing,
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.560]  and we want to have this one cannabinoid just to get high. Until we ended up with medical cannabis
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:49.440]  and realized that the other cannabinoids are what's going to help the rest of us that are truly sick,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.440]  you know, get through the day instead of just getting through it mentally by kind of zoning
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:59.600]  out from getting too fucking high. That's where we became smart and started to realize that we,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.480]  it was there already. We'd forgotten about it and we just have to dig into it. So like I said,
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.200]  get enough seed stock to find what you're looking for available. Like if you're going to dig into
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:14.640]  an SFV to try to make a high CBG line, you probably got to pop a million seeds to find
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:20.960]  that outlier out of that line because it wasn't bred into that certain plant, right? That cultivar
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.040]  doesn't have it. They made that for a different reason, right? If you want to dive into that,
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.360]  you find genetics that have that available in it. Like there's some autoflowers that carry it.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:35.040]  There's different hemp lines that aren't autoflower that will carry it. I've got an
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.760]  autoflower Slovenian line that's high CBG that produces almost no THC that can be used to put
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.280]  into other lines to start to carry that cannabinoid. If you understand breeding or testing,
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.720]  you know, it's kind of hard to pick that up to just smoking that plant. So you'd end up having
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.480]  to do enough testing on those lines to be able to find out if the germplast you're working with
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.360]  off that line actually contains the cannabinoid and the profiles you're looking for. Once you
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.480]  start finding that and start to breed it constantly, that testing number has to go,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:10.000]  goes down dramatically. Once you get into an F3 or an F4 or even farther than that line,
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.040]  that plant's automatically always going to breed for those certain profiles that you basically
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.920]  bottlenecked into the line. So another breeder might look at that plant and not get any THC
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.120]  out of it and say, it's got bottlenecked until a point he doesn't want to use it.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.240]  But another person that's looking for a specific medicinal quality of that plant doesn't care about
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:33.840]  the shape of it, doesn't care about how many months it took for it to flower. He just wants
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:38.640]  to put that plant in there so that he can actually get a larger amount and be more efficient for the
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.200]  cannabinoids he's trying to produce. So like if you're trying to pull CBG out of your facility
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.480]  and you put in a bunch of SFVOG, because you just have the access to that and you end up with
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.080]  1% of the whole facility pulling CBG because of the way you grew the plant, instead of dropping
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:01.920]  a cultivar that already puts up maybe 10% or 12% CBG, and you just raised the efficiency of your
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.920]  facility so high that you'd go from being a failure to being so high of a success that you
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.360]  won't know what to do with your damn self. And it all comes down to understanding the plants that
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.240]  you're working with. You could find this in an outlier in almost any plant because cannabis
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.120]  is related to itself. So don't worry about the shape of the leaf. Don't worry about where your
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.840]  friend said he got it from. Worry about what that plant can prove in a chemotype report if you're
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.560]  going to want to breed for specific cannabinoid profiles, especially if you want to get away from
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.560]  THC because you want to start breeding with the ones that are going to lock in those traits.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.040]  You don't want to just mess with one that you feel like has got CBD because it didn't get you
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.400]  as high as its brother or sister. If you really want to start pulling specific
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.960]  terpenoids and traits, you also need to test for the thyles. You need to test for cannabinoids,
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.280]  terpenoids, because if you don't have specific ratios of each one of those, that plant actually
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.560]  doesn't smell or taste like you think it would just because it's going to carry a bunch of
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.800]  limonene on it. If that limonene isn't accompanied by a different cannabinoid or a different terpenoid,
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.120]  it may not even express itself as lemon on the plant. It might come across more orange.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.400]  It might even express itself as lime or something. You only know this through testing. You find that
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:19.440]  type that does it. You can't just find the one plant and go, this one's doing it. It might be
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.080]  a recessive trait in that plant and not even breed true for it. Once you get into the F2s and you try
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.560]  to breed the F2s into something else, and then all of a sudden it just disappears. And it's because
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:35.520]  that plant wasn't carrying the traits actually that you wanted. Both alleles weren't in there.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.800]  It just was not available. So like you said-
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.680]  I was trying to do lots of CBD projects back in the day. And the good thing people don't do enough
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.640]  of is test your mails. If you got a mail, you can't smoke your mail. So you don't know what the
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.920]  hell, how heavy it's going to make. It's not pretty. It's hard to do it. So a lot of people
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.320]  don't know you can test your mail, but you test your mails. You test the leaves, you can test
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.080]  the flower stocks, anything, grind up, put it in the tester, it tests. So when you're doing CBD and
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:13.520]  stuff, I was looking, made a cross, one to one cross, get one high CBD plant. You only got what
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.640]  you're working with. So the other one was high THC, but you got one high CBD plant. So you cross
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:26.560]  it together. In that group, you got a mix of all kinds of stuff. And the ones that you think are
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.600]  going to be CBD dominant, you don't know on the mail side. So all the plants that you pull aside,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.400]  you've got to do your testing. You got to know who's who. So testing a mail, you can pick any
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.240]  mail out of that group. You just can't think that it has high CBD. You have to actually test that
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:49.360]  fucking mail to find out if this is the one that has like 6% CBD or 7% CBD or 4% CBD or whatever.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.520]  Then it's carrying that trait that you're looking for because you can't smoke it to do it. And
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.880]  that's a good way to like find what you're looking for quick. If you just, if you want to do one or
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.600]  two tests and you do your little sort and you pick out your males and you already know what
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.120]  your females are doing. And for the most part, you can test each one. You can test what, but
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.280]  always test the mail. If you're using a mail and you're making males and you can afford to do it,
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:22.560]  do a terpene, do a cannabinoid test. I mean, do a, do a reversal on it with some stuff, learn how
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.680]  to do a reversal on it, do some weird stuff with it, but definitely test those things, man. Those,
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.520]  that'll tell you valuable information. You know, that's how they find a lot of,
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.280]  a lot of superstar breeders. You know, you find the breeder males that way. Ah, this one's the
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.600]  superstar. He's carrying everything I need. Boom. You keep that fucker around, breed with him,
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.600]  you know, make a million babies, you know, so, but test your males, you know.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.000]  Yeah. So you could take some Ethafon and actually alter the Ethalon and Driboic acid pathways in
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.360]  that plant. And some, you guys could read up on a guy named Mohan Ram. He does, he has a lot of
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:01.680]  information that he's written about reversal of males. So if you use Ethalon on a male,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.480]  you can actually reverse a male. He'll start to produce different cannabinoids, terpenoids,
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:13.040]  and thiols that he did not produce while he was in his regular flower state. It's kind of a poor
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:20.560]  man's way of, of actually seeing what that plant's going to try to produce when he, if you actually
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.560]  made some S1s of him, you're going to start to see some of the terpenes pop out of that when you do
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:29.040]  that reversal on the male itself. He'll start to give you this, the bud, a little bit of bud
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.600]  structure will pop out of him. He'll produce a ton of more trichomes, especially if you already
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.040]  had a resin male, he's going to pop out crazy. He's going to look frostier than your females.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.160]  It's going to be crazy. The bract on there will be so covered in trichomes that you think it's
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.000]  absurd and you could actually smoke it once it's treated with Ethafon. It's not going to hurt you.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.680]  It's not like doing the females when you treat it with silver, you don't want to mess around
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:57.760]  smoking silver treated plants. But you treat that male. Now you can take that male and inbreed
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.760]  them on itself because he's going to offer both male and female seeds. And she has X and Y
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.400]  chromosomes available. Now you take those and start doing your line breeding through an inbred
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.760]  male, and you'll be able to pull out all kinds of crazy stuff out of your line that was not
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:16.240]  available before. And again, like I said, with the larger megabase, genetic information, you end up
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:22.080]  having availability now to pull a female out that actually had more genetic possibilities than if
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:28.000]  you would have just used a clone of his sister. She just doesn't have that available to breed.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.920]  So when she goes to pass genetics across it, it's not actually going to be there. Some of them
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.960]  that might be only available on the male side of that plant. And so you guys take some, you can go
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:47.040]  down to Ethafon. It's made by a man. I was going to, I'm trying some stuff called Florel.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.640]  Yeah, Florel. Well, that's the active ingredient in Florel.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.800]  Yeah, that's what I thought. That's the Florel.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.400]  What we're doing is producing ethylene on the plant.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:56.900]  That's right.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.920]  So it'll produce the ethylene on the plant and ends up making the ratio of the amount of ethylene
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:10.960]  that that male has in him raise up and increases above the GA3 level. And it starts to show as a
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.280]  female. That's what's happening. It's a trait that's the part of actual, like the gender of
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:23.840]  the plant. Some traits in the plant are directly caused by traits that are only expressed through
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:30.480]  male or female side of the plant. Like having a bud structure and more trichome production.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:35.520]  Those things are what are expressed through a female for breeding. A male doesn't usually do
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:40.080]  that, but you can force that to a male by making him think there's too much ethylene in a system.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.640]  So he starts to show as a female, even though he's still truly a male genetically, you don't
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:50.320]  actually switch any of the genes. All you've done is alter his ethylene pathways.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.760]  His hormones. Yeah.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.760]  Yeah. It's just hormone driven. That's why people like the pop seeds and in their room,
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.360]  they grow them. They've only been growing them for like three weeks and they start flipping them.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:05.200]  Those plants aren't even sexually mature. They're not even acclimated to that environment. So all of
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.880]  a sudden that plant starts throwing a homophrodites because it doesn't understand the environment that
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.480]  you have it in. And then you start getting angry at the breeder because you said he didn't lock
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:19.200]  in traits and you didn't even take time to take clones off that plant to see what's going on.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.200]  You've got an annual plant that you trying to force to live forever and you're expecting no,
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.560]  uh, no stress from that. What you're doing, you know, and then when you went to flower and put
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.760]  72 hours of dark on it to try to force it into flower, that's another stress jumper.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.880]  And no one wants to talk about that. You're trying to stop the amount of
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.680]  Florigen that's produced in the plant and altered the way that they PF, you know,
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.720]  the photo Chrome red and photo Chrome, uh, is altered in the plant so that it'll actually
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.200]  start to flower. It's not just triggering a 12 and 12. You get a plant to flower and
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:57.120]  with more lights than that, you know, you can, even my Hayes, you can run my Hayes under 13
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:03.120]  hours of light with the correct spectrum above it so that you can turn off. You just have to
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:11.440]  understand the plant. I'm trying to read and talk at the same time. I do a bunch of stuff. I start a
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.960]  whole bunch of seeds under 12, 12, all the time. You know, I just started them all a bunch of them
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:20.480]  on 12, 12 and look at, you know, you can look at seeds and, you know, just dig it up and they just
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.760]  mature when they get just enough, then just flower out and you can look at things, you know,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.400]  the way it is. You can read that too much, but you know, it's all hormones at that point,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.920]  you know, and then you're, you're, like you said, you're taking a plant that's expected to live a
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.400]  long time and you're fucking, you know, keeping it on 12, 12, confusing the shit out of it and
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.640]  throwing it 18 after a while, flowering it out and it doesn't know where the fuck it is. So,
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.520]  but that's how you find those, those hermaphrodites and those, those weak links
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.360]  and those ones, those ones that make it through all that shit. You know what I mean? And come
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.120]  out shining, smelling fucking sweet on the outside, man. Those are the, those are the
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.800]  keepers, man. Those are, those are good fucking things to keep around, you know?
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.760]  So, he wants to know if the floral I was talking, that's exactly, I can't remember what it was,
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.520]  but someone put up the name and wanted to know if that's the product I'm talking about. Floral
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.000]  is what you would use on a male to revert a male. It will not work on a female. It will slow down
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  hermaphrodites on a female though. If you've got a female that's throwing pistil at flowers,
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.040]  that you'd be able to, you can spray it with floral and it will stop that, uh,
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.840]  pistol formation from happening. But you need to know when that's going to happen and spray prior
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.040]  to it happening. If you do not spray prior, it's just going to throw up a pollen anyway.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.200]  And all you're doing is wetting that stamina flower and hoping that the sepals don't drop
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:41.840]  any live pollen. But if you, if you catch that with a hormone correctly, it's not going to
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.680]  actually make those stamina flowers. Cause what's happening is it drops the amount of
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.760]  ethylene it's producing at a certain point. For some reason, it could be any reason in that room.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.480]  It could have got hot. One of your light bulbs might be losing a spectrum that it does not like.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.960]  Maybe you added a new bulb and it didn't like that. It could be anything that just made that
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.520]  plant say, what the fuck? And all of a sudden it starts to alter the amount of ethylene it produces
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:08.800]  and the ratio of ethylene to GA3 in the plant starts to become more even or sway the other way.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.160]  And that's why you get that pistol formation. It's not because that plant's truly minocious.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.960]  If it was minocious, it would have been throwing pistol at flowers. As soon as it went into flower,
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.480]  that would have been what all the types in the whole line would have done. It wouldn't have
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.120]  been just one. It wouldn't have been just two. You would have bought 10 seeds and all 10 of them
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:33.040]  would have been minocious. You know, they would start throwing stamina flowers at like day 17 and
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:36.560]  they would pollinate their self because that's what those lines are supposed to do.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.880]  If you got a hormone for that plant, you need to know if it's a hormone driven
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.360]  or if it's actually a genetic trait in that plant.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.560]  That floral, you know, they use it. You can buy it like a lot of regular old nurseries and stuff
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.480]  will have that stuff. They use it for like all of the trees and stuff. We use it for making
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.680]  flowers. So the olives don't make olives and drops get all over your driveway and stuff.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.480]  You can spray those trees with the floral and it keeps those flowers from forming and forming
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:10.000]  all over and knock all that stuff down, keep it from going on. So that's the first time I'm
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.920]  messing with reversing my male. I'm going to reverse him and pollinate him like you said.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.640]  I've been doing some reading and some funny stuff. I'm going to start going in that path
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.800]  right now. So that's why I was like, I have that shit in my truck. You know, normally I don't use
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.760]  it all the time and it's sitting there. I'm going to reverse the males and fuck around with that.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:33.760]  That's my current fun science experiment that I'm, you know, that's where we all grow. You know
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.640]  what I mean? You don't like, like homeboy was saying earlier, you know, you don't, you don't
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.560]  know unless you fucking do it. You got to try. You got to fucking, you got to put your hands on it.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:48.080]  And you got to, you got to see for yourself, you know, and someone here asked about STS.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:55.520]  I see STS and nano. If you're reversing a plant, I prefer to use STS myself. I've shown people
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.400]  on my YouTube channel, which is four, four, big bone, four, four. There's a three-part video
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.160]  step-by-step to show you how I did my Icarus OG female reversal. I step you how to make
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.760]  the actual STS product. That way you can store it and use it on your plants. And it's going to
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.360]  actually, it's not going to be as dangerous as for me as colloidal silver is actually kind of
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.080]  dangerous for you, right? If you got kids or pets around, or if you're just a clumsy ass fucking
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.320]  grower, you get that shit on you and you turn fucking blue. You just don't want to fuck around
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:36.240]  with that. It's also less effective at a female. So what you're end up doing is damaging the plant
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:42.080]  more than you do altering the hormone levels of the plant when you're using colloidal silver.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.920]  So that's why I use STS. I got my stuff right here. One sec.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.160]  Yeah, I do a SPS, man. I've done everything under the sun. I've done stuff.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:38:01.040]  There's a part A and a part B when you're making your STS, right? So this, I can walk you exactly
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.600]  through how to make enough of this stuff to reverse of 2000 plants easily. I mean,
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.640]  it takes almost nothing. It shows you how to treat it, but you kind of need to know your cultivars.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.960]  Some cultivars are going to be able to reverse a lot easier, which they're not actually reversing.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.040]  They're going to be able to have pathways altered easier. That's what I'd like to get people to
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.840]  understand is you're not actually reversing anything. You're just altering ethylene pathways
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.680]  in a female. So that you'll show pistolet formation and drop sepals that will give you
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.040]  pollen that is viable. And even when you do, you do this treatment, you may end up with
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.520]  bracts that never open up that you need to collect and dry. So you can actually access
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.840]  the pollen that's inside the sepals that are in there because some of these males
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.600]  are these females. They grow such a tight bud structure that when they go to flower,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.760]  they don't actually open up. So they just kind of stay closed in on themselves. So what you do is
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.360]  take some tweezers and pick those off, stick them in a jar, dry them with some desiccant. And that
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.760]  way you'd be able to pull some of the pollen off there. I've shown videos of how to do that also,
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.880]  but what you really need to do is learn how to reverse your plan. If you want to start inbreeding
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.080]  and locking some traits, then you need to know how to do a selfing. You need to know how to self
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.200]  a plant and then back cross it to the original parent that has the traits that you're more
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.080]  interested in locking into. Or if you find something in the F2 or F3 or whatever generation
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:31.360]  you found it in, you found a special plant, it's a female and you want to keep it. FTS is the way
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.000]  you want to go. You want to make yourself some of this stuff, keep it stored in dark bottles,
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.760]  keep it somewhere cool where it'll last for quite a long time. Learn how to mix it together. Learn
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.800]  from someone that knows how to do it, that can show that they've done it. That's why I say,
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.880]  go look at my videos. There's other cats out there that'll show you. But I tell you exactly
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.200]  how to make the exact product that I use that made my reversed femmed Icarus OG line that I released
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:02.240]  mid last year that I was working on. It's pretty much gone by now, but that's the one that my
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:08.480]  wax packs is showing that extremely serrated female that's coming out of this cross to an
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:15.280]  inbred packing Chitral and Cush. So that plant itself shows multiple different mutations through
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.480]  variegation and leaf structure. So it's been, it showed up when I did a reversal on it and that
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.480]  plant's showing quite often in there. So like it's at 70% showing that mutation in some of the plants
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.320]  that it's coming out of. So like that goes back to trying to breed more two lines. You're looking
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.400]  for something that breeds true that package of Charlie Cush from Kennel Biogen or other sources
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.200]  is something that will breed true for what it has in there. If you're looking for some colorful
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.000]  plants, there's plants in there that are going to be magenta and reds and purples and blues.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.520]  There are some green phenos because of it being a land race line, which isn't going to be a hundred
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.920]  percent true breeding for every trait, but it's true breeding for the genetic potential of that
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.040]  line because it hasn't had anything that came in and tainted what's there. So a lot of people
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.960]  think they're going to get a land race line and every seed that pops out of that's going to be
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.600]  a highly identical with the same cannabinoid and terpenes. And it just doesn't work that way.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.640]  That thing's been inbreeding with its brothers and sisters and its cousins for, for a millennia,
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.760]  man. If it's truly a land race line, even if it's a heirloom line that someone's worked on for like
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:29.920]  40 years and they open pollinate it every year, what happens is the seed that's come out of there
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.360]  is variations of that genetic potential. So you can line breed very easily out of those.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.400]  You just have to understand what you want out of the plant, not what everybody else wants. Like
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.360]  what's hot right now is skunk. And you try to whip out something like blueberry and try to breed
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.680]  just straight skunk out of blueberry. You're going to be the last dude in line to breed blue
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.440]  berry. You have to go into the lines that actually have what you're looking for. Terpene profiles,
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.840]  the structure that you want. Are you looking for a timeframe to finish in? It's just what you're
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:08.160]  after really. But learn how to make some STS and quit fucking with collodial silver. Quit trying
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:13.760]  to turn into a smurf, man. That shit's good for fucking maybe killing some bacteria on your cut.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.120]  But like if your kids get around that shit and get it all over them, they're going to be fucked up.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.320]  If they drink it, it's not very good for them. Trust me on that shit. Like you really don't
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.640]  want to try it. I tried so much shit back in the day, man. I went through mixing colloidal
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.920]  silver. I bought this, that kind, that other kind. I did to really gas and mixtures I did.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:40.320]  And you know, it's all about STS. And then once you get onto the STS, it works. I mean,
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.560]  you guys can see right now, I have the dog walker OG is reversed on my IG right now. That's a
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.840]  reverse, you know, dog walker OG going. That's STS did that. And it's hardly any damage on that
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.000]  one, which is really nice, you know? So some of that stuff will fuck up your plants really bad.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.120]  And I mean, that's fun to play with. And every batch is just, it just is what it is, man. You
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.400]  know, but yeah, what throw up your, uh, your YouTube again, Mr. Toad, where with that video,
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.840]  what was that again? One sec, I'm going to. Yeah, good, good. Thank you. A lot of people love that,
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:16.160]  the number four, four, big bone four, four. That's my YouTube channel. I've got some videos
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:22.240]  on there on soil making, uh, pollen collect ghetto pollen collecting tech. Cause I haven't put my
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:30.800]  better one on there, but it does have my exact recipe on how to make it. And you will, I plant,
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.800]  I'd show it being used on a plant. I, I sell seeds that came from the plant that I pollinated in that
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:42.560]  room. Right. It's not, it's not a, maybe it's, it will work on your plants, right? You're going to
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.920]  need to understand your own plant. Cause if you have a girl that doesn't reverse easily, like my
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:55.840]  space, Cush line that I used to use, it did not like being reversed at all. I tried using collodial
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:03.040]  silver. I tried GA three and like the number two, I only got to reverse one time in 14 years. And I
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.480]  must've tried like six or seven times on her. The number one would reverse easier than the number
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.960]  two. And the number three was spotty. Like it would, it would reverse, but it wouldn't give
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.640]  me much pollen at all. Out of those three lines. When I reversed the male, the male reversed for
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.760]  me a lot easier because it's a lot easier to put ethylene on that plant. And he, he, he just,
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:33.120]  he showed me better. He came back at 11.54%. THC when I tested him, I only had him tested for THC,
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:40.480]  CBD and CBN at that time. So it was a ghetto test. They weren't, it was a mobile testing lab that
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:44.400]  came through the place I was running. So I just did a small testing on them. They didn't even
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.800]  know I was testing the male that they were like, what the fuck kind of bud is that? I'm like,
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:54.880]  just test it for me, man. I want to know what's going to come up on my line. Right. And I started
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.040]  talking to him and the guys, you're testing a male. I'm like, yeah, man, I'm a breeder, dude.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.840]  I'm trying to breed cannabis. I don't want to just know what the shit is because I smoked it. I want
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.320]  to know what's inside that plant, man. So I reversed it. I'm going to try to dig into the seed line
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.880]  that comes out of it, but he didn't want to try. He didn't, he didn't actually make the seeds that
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:19.040]  I wanted because of him not actually giving me so much, you know, pistol information. And at that
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.840]  time I wasn't smart enough to stop spraying him. So I was continually spraying them and I was just
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.160]  killing all the pollen that was coming off of there. I wasn't even thinking in my head, I need
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.800]  that pollen to drop on those pistols to get me some more seeds. So as I continued to spray him
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.000]  to try to get him to reverse even further, I was just stopping the germination process or the
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.520]  pollination process on him. I learned that on him and ended up making seed with the number two
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.280]  female. I did that three different times. I've got three different batches of seeds from her
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:53.360]  made on her, her sisters herself, just to see what she would do. That's kind of how I found
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:59.280]  out how the line would breed was by reversing all of them at the same time and then crossing them
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.440]  on the lines that I had here. So at that time I was carrying probably about 12 different plants
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:12.160]  and I pollinated all 12 plants with all three females that I reversed. And then that would tell
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:17.360]  me what was coming out of the line consistently since it was a hybrid. It's not a true breeding
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.920]  line. The original space coach came out of there by breeding it to other plants and knowing what
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:28.000]  they did. So when I put it on like a Chernobyl that I know has got mold resistance and pest
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.480]  resistance and I put my line on it, if the seeds that came out of that all of a sudden were pest
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:38.080]  magnets, I know my plants are pest magnet. That did not happen. I ended up still keeping plants
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:46.960]  that were all retaining pest magnet, no pest and no powdery mildew, buds didn't mold. So that started
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.640]  to try to tell me that the plants either have some of the same alleles to pass through and
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.720]  they're recessive or it actually has some of them as being dominant. So then I would cross it to some
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.360]  plants that I knew that were going to mold all the time. And then I find out that half those crosses
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:08.720]  coming from there stop molding. So I find out my plants contain a trait that keeps other plants
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.600]  from molding if I breed. So that's how I find out that this is a trait that comes across as a
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.080]  dominant trait in the breeding line, even though it's a polyhybrid. Like I said, you can make
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:25.040]  true breeding lines out of hybrid plants. You just have to work with them long enough or do enough
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:30.000]  testing. I prefer to work with them because I like smoking weed and I like talking to people
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.720]  about the weed. So like going to a lab and shit, I'm just waiting for a dude to bring me a result
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:39.360]  and we don't really talk about anything. So I'd really rather talk to your best friend that's
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.720]  got cancer and shit. And he tells me that this will help relieve his pain and he started to be
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.320]  able to eat better, you know, or your grandmother who all of a sudden started to use a taco that was
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.720]  made from a plant that contains specific cannabinoids that now all of a sudden doesn't
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:01.120]  have any arthritis pain. I prefer to have that as my information than to have just test results
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.040]  because test results can be skewed. They can be, you know, they can be misread. Like I said,
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.280]  you can say, oh, it's got lemon right there. It says lemonine. I'm going to be able to breed
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.720]  all kinds of lemon strains just because of that test report that that plant has lemon on it.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:21.040]  And it may not be a, you know, perfect. We got a glitch in the measure. Your audio
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.720]  is coming in all glitchy. Oh, I'm sorry. Now it's good. Let me move over here.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.240]  That's it. It goes in and out.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.560]  Where you're you're in. Where in NorCal are you? Shasta County. Okay.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.200]  I'm basically the last big town in Northern California. Big time. We ain't big at all here.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.960]  Small as shit. I'm right by Shasta Lake over here. Yeah.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.840]  We got a question for you. You see that? I was just trying to read. We have three THC
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:14.800]  victory seeds. That would be the best. Are they males or do you have what you see? You have three
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:21.520]  seeds. Are they male and female? What do we have there? If they're from the same line, you want to
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:26.400]  just cross all the males and all the females you get from it and open the population up and start
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.040]  doing the same with the F2s and get as many seeds as you can out of there to start popping it and
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:36.080]  seeing what can come out of that line. Also, I would reverse all three of them. If there's three
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.480]  seeds, if there's a male and two females, I'd reverse both females and the male like I did with
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:45.840]  my breeding lines. Don't just keep one. If you're going to make some collodial silver, reverse all
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.880]  your plants when you can do it. Just stagger the timeline that you're doing it. Pollen needs,
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.000]  you know, you need about two weeks in between reversing a plant to be able to have the room
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.240]  cleaned out and start pollinating another round if you want to put it in the same room. Just
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.880]  pollinate them in different areas. That way you don't cross contaminate the lines. Or use pollen
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.680]  bags. That's even a better idea, you know. But a lot of people don't want to buy them. They use
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:16.480]  them for maize breeding. They're long bags that have an opening in the front that you can reclose
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.080]  where you can dump pollen in through the top of that thing and be able to pollinate specific
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.920]  branches with different pollen. You know, tree breeders use this, corn, wheat. I mean,
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.040]  there's a lot of different breeders that are using pollen bags, you know. Cannabis breeders are kind
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.720]  of the new school dummies of the whole breeding scene for real, man. Even the best breeders out
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.400]  there really are not doing it the way plant breeders are really doing this shit, man.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.680]  We're out here making stuff just because we read about it in the book somewhere and the name sounds
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:51.360]  kind of cool together. That's what a majority of the breeding in cannabis has been for quite a
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:57.760]  while. Besides commercial, you know, big old warehouses of breeding. But back then you still
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.800]  had to have something that was fucking high THC, that smelled a specific way and finished in a
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:09.040]  specific time. The breeding was very narrow-minded for what was happening. Other breeders for plants
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.360]  are trying to do something completely different than the way we breed plants and cannabis,
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.040]  right? All we're trying to do is market it as fast as we can to get it to market as
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:21.760]  many people as we can as soon as fast. You know, just boom, get it out. Let's do it because something
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:28.000]  else is coming. Tomatoes have been here for 120 years that we're eating. We got heirloom tomatoes
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.480]  that every year your grandma goes and buys and puts in the garden. Nobody's going to be buying
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.400]  some of these hybrids in 100 years, right? They won't even remember half of these damn plants.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.520]  Some of them will still be here even though they've been bred for high THC. Like Kim D's
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.280]  already been here 30 years, right? It's already been here a third of that time, you know? So if
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.440]  you really want to breed, get into some of the stuff that's really there or learn to line breed,
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.960]  like just line breed into what you want. But like he's asking what would he do? I would reverse all
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.280]  of them. I would cross all of them on their self. I would open the population up and increase the
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.840]  amount of seed stock that I have because three seeds aren't going to do anything for you for the
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.960]  one generation, really, unless you have a big ass male.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.600]  It's just the two of us, right? You got to breed them. You got to breed them some way you can. I
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.880]  don't know the question. My phone died, but I dove to get charger and it works perfectly now. I
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:35.840]  didn't even, you know, breed it outside and make as many as possible. Yep. Make as many as possible.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.520]  So someone asks your process for reversing a male.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:49.600]  Well, we talked about that earlier. You use a product called Ethafon or Florel. Florel is the
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.120]  commercial name, but the actual product that's being used in those products is called Ethafon.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.640]  Ethafon is an ethylene producing product. Once it's sprayed on the plant, the plant produces
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:06.800]  ethylene. They use this in ripening fruit. It's used by a lot of different horticultural
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:16.400]  fucking people besides cannabis. But like there's a man named H-Y Mohan Ram. He has a lot of papers
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:25.360]  written on reversals of male that talk specifically about using this. It's Ethafon. E-T-H-A-P-H-O-N.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.840]  Ethafon. I believe that's how you spell it. You can pick it up at your hydro shop, man.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.480]  Yeah. That's what you're talking about right there, Florel Nugs. And what you're going to do,
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.720]  just depends on the male that you have, right? Some males are going to need a higher concentration
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.880]  and sprayed longer. That's why I said, you need to know what your plant does specifically. And
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.960]  only where you're going to need that is start to spray that plant. But you started a baseline.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:52.640]  Don't start too strong. I would start at around 50 to a hundred parts per million maximum. I'd
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.000]  start spraying that male 10 days to seven to 10 days before I go into flower with him while he's
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.640]  in veg one time a day. And then when he goes into veg, spray the same one time a day until he starts
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.960]  to show pistol at formation. Once you see pistol, stop spraying him. He doesn't need to be sprayed
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.440]  any longer. A lot of people will continue to spray and do what I did and made the mistake of
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.160]  killing the pollen that went come off of him. But what you do now, you've sprayed your male,
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:24.560]  you have altered the ethylene pathway in him. He starts to produce more ethylene and the ratio of
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:30.720]  ethylene to direct acid in a system raises, and he starts to show pistol at formation now. So now
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:37.200]  you take a clone of that same male and let him start to drop pollen in the same room on that
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:43.680]  male. And now you have a self version of that male. That male is going to give you a specific
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.040]  amount of seeds. You may have a male that's highly fertile and gives you a lot of seeds.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.200]  You might get one that might only give you 10 or 20 seeds. So once you learn that, that means you
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.080]  got to put 10 or 12 of those in a room to get yourself a hundred seeds out of that line to open
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.200]  up enough seed stock to be able to breed that line or to see what he offers. If you get a hundred
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:07.040]  seeds and pop a hundred and 25 of them all show what you were looking for, you have a plant that
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:10.320]  is not going to breed true for any of the traits you're looking for. And you're going to have a
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.800]  harder time. You're going to fight the other traits that are showing dominant in that line.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.640]  That's what selfing is going to show you. You can self a Kim D and end up seeing maybe nine
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.680]  different phenotypes pop out of that plant. Now you can line breed out of a Kim D, make your own
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:31.200]  Kim D from selfing by going through that way. Outcross it to something that has been used,
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:38.080]  regular seed stock, like maybe a Kim crossed to whatever, a NAFGU or something, or to deep chunk,
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.360]  and then take that outcross and start crossing back into the original parent. And I'm only using
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:47.200]  the Kim D name because everybody knows that, but it could be your own specific strain that you
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.320]  created, something from Mr. Tree's here, Sungrow Mids, any one of your favorite breeders. You take
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.520]  one of his seed lines or her seed lines and learn how to line breed them in the direction you want.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.320]  Learn how to reverse that plant and learn how to breed with that plant. Instead of trying to
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:08.000]  breed with 25 different males and 25 different females and calling yourself a breeder, learn
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:13.920]  what your plant can do. Learn what's going to come out of it. Make your line a true breeding line
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.480]  instead of just making a polywog stew, man. A lot of us out there offering polywog stew,
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.600]  they're killer for line breeding out of, but they're not true breeding for nothing, man.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:30.000]  They really aren't. You got to make a little polywog stew, but don't be, you know,
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:35.920]  I love the polywog stews. I love them, man. But like, if we really want to be serious about what
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:41.200]  we're talking about, other horticultural breeders do not breed anywhere near the way we breed.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:47.120]  They use two true breeding lines to create a new F1 that can be replicated year after year by using
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.240]  the parental stock. You know, that's why I kept parents for 15 years here. I had plants for
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:59.040]  years, man, until I got my health issues and lost everything. At one point I had 176 different moms
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.560]  that I kept on stock. You know, I was collecting plants from every direction that I could,
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.440]  just so I could learn about the one line that I used to use to breed with, my space coach line.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.760]  I bred that thing to every plant I could, just so I could learn what it could do, because I didn't
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.520]  have access in my area to any kind of testing. I had to drive three hours one way and three hours
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.920]  back for every test report that I needed to do. And at that time I just could not do that kind
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:29.280]  of stuff. I was running a club 10 hours a day. I had an edible company that I had to run. I ran
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.320]  a clone facility where we were doing 4,400 clones every week or every month. I'm sorry.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:39.600]  I mean, I was so damn busy that there was just no way I was going to be able to be making those
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:45.760]  trips all the time. My trips down there were for collecting genetics and for actually doing
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:49.760]  businesses through my sister clubs that my owner owned. He had two different clubs down in
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.560]  Sacramento and one in Vallejo. And we used to have to go down there and do work for those places and
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.720]  shit. But other than that, I was like, man, I can't be driving down to the Bay Area just to
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:03.200]  get shit tested, dude. You guys need to let me mail in my samples in some kind of vacuum seal
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.360]  container. And I'll gladly pay for every damn test. But if I got to keep making these drives,
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:13.040]  dude, you guys are crazy. You're just out of your mind, dude. It's just, I'm in a bad spot where it
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:17.040]  was for me. A lot of people live in areas you can get testing and it's awesome. But when you live
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.600]  out in the boondocks, man, that stuff will kill you, brother. It'll kill you pretty quick.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:27.200]  I mean, I got to drive aways myself, man. It ain't fun. That's why I test mails and stuff
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.920]  and things that I'm like, fuck, I can't smoke this. I know nothing about it other than
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:38.800]  the stem rubs and all the things that I can see with my eyes and touch my eyes. But that's why
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:43.520]  I do a lot of the mail testing because I got to drive a while. It's hard to do. It's expensive
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:50.560]  shit. So anybody's got a laboratory, they want to help me and Mr. Toad out, man, help us out, bro.
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:56.720]  I tried buying my own equipment. I tried everything, man. I tried everything I could.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:01.520]  And it always came back to where I had to use the human as the equation that made what my
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:05.920]  breeding became. I'm not saying my breeding was anything other than what it is, but like
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:11.040]  I did it my way because that was the only way I could do it. That's why, that's how you do it.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.200]  You just fucking do it, right? You're never going to end up with any seeds in your pocket if you
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.600]  don't cross something to something else. That's how we all did it. We all were chucking shit at
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.000]  one point and we still do. I got seeds getting chucked right now for just because I want to
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.880]  have some extra seeds or something on the sideline just in case. That's what we're all doing.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:33.360]  Maybe that one trick on the side is where that one special plant comes out.
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:41.040]  Got to be looking. That's for sure. My Pam, man, she don't reverse very, Pam one does not reverse
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:47.040]  very easy. Pam 15 will reverse a lot easier with other things. She will not reverse. Pam one is
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:52.240]  like, fuck, she will not reverse. And if she does, she'll spit out three or four flowers. She'll
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:57.520]  even four fucking buds. You can start three weeks before fucking flower and then you put her,
[01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:02.960]  spray her once or twice a day in some cases. And she'll still be a little fucking honoree,
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:08.240]  little bitch. And she'll still put on flowers. And if she does put on any frigging pollen,
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:13.040]  it's just like one or two little fucking flower fucking pistols and they like stall out and they
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.240]  never have anything that's of any value. It's like, you can't even get it out. It's a waste
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:24.960]  of time, you know, but, but the, you know, but the stronger the stuff. So I'm trying different
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:28.800]  mixtures. That's what set me on the path. I've been like, I've tried colloidal silvers and all
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:40.160]  the jubilee. Have you tried using GA3 and STS, but not like together, but that's one of my new
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:47.600]  mixtures that I'm like, while you're in the plant with a small amount of GA3 to boost the amount of
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.120]  GA3 in the system, as it starts to go into that flowering stage, maybe not just together,
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:58.000]  try doing them in stages too. That's what I was thinking. That's been like one of the new
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.560]  mixtures, but those are the fun things. You know, you learn what your fucking plant likes to do and
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.120]  doesn't like to do what she's easy. And you do, you do that to Pam 15, you know, one of her
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:11.840]  offspring, one of my keepers. And she just so flip like this, like, you know, so you want me to,
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:15.520]  you want me to flip? No problem. You know, dog walker flips like this. You know, so many that
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.560]  are just like flipping them and do what you need them to do. But it's, it's like, it's, it's crazy.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.760]  It's, it's fun. You know, it's nice to hear. And it's like, you know, it's nice to hear other
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:31.440]  people say, huh? Is the Pam one really stable and flower? Like she does not homomorphic that
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.920]  easily at all. She, no, she does not. Yeah. She's super stable. She breathes real, real,
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.320]  real strong and real, you know, real dominant on, on everything too. You know, when she's,
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:45.040]  she doesn't produce much GA three. Yeah. She's, she's, she's, she's one of those ones,
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.200]  but you know, her offspring, other things, I mean, you know, you can play, but she's,
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:53.040]  she's weird. I've been, that's what, that's what taught me how to reverse with the Pam one. So I
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:57.040]  was having so many problems. I'm like, what the fuck? Like this, you know, she just doesn't want
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.320]  to flip like the other stuff, you know? So I'm like, I'm going to try these recipes to start
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.800]  mixing my own. And that's how you learn, you know, like, like, you know, like sun grown with sand,
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.680]  you know, you got to put your hands on it. You just got to do it. You know, I got to do it to
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.880]  get it. No matter where you're at. Does she grow in a more apical growth, like more of a single
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:18.720]  cola or is she highly branching that plant? She is, she's big branching, big time brancher,
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:23.520]  you know, she'll have one single cola. Like when the clown shows, she'll straighten out and you
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:28.720]  put her outside that old clown, right? You know, she's seven, eight, you know, some nine, something
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.200]  like that. It's seven, eight, nine years old, somewhere in there. Um, but she'll straighten
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.280]  out when she put her outside and she'll have the crystal get into that Christmas tree shape. You
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.800]  know what I mean? She'll do it, but she's good fucking branching dude. She's, you know, she's
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:46.080]  stout and strong. You can't, you know, she doesn't need a lot of cages and she's, she's gorgeous when
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:51.200]  it comes to that. But in, in a tent situation or something like that, there's, it's a branchy,
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:57.920]  you know, situation for sure. She squats out and branches out. It's odd, it's odd, you know,
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:03.200]  she just doesn't reverse nearly, nearly as easy as the others, you know, and it's just funny. I'm
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.560]  glad that, you know, they're to hear other people talk about that.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:13.720]  And they want to know what do you do after backcrossing? Keep backcrossing,
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.240]  just keep backcrossing the plant that has the traits you're looking at. That's what it's all
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:22.280]  about. You might have to backcross five times. You might have to backcross 10 times. It all just
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:29.320]  depends on what you're starting with and how, how are the alleles that are in that plant dominant?
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.600]  Are there two or they're one, right? And is the plant that you're breeding into, does it carry two
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.240]  or does it carry one? That's basically what it comes down to. It's like you got two boxes of
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:44.200]  crayons and you're trying to make one box and you have to match up colors, right? And if you don't
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:49.800]  have two of that color, that color don't go in the box. So, you know, you got 200 boxes and they're
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.280]  all fucking missing some colors in there. So you got to reach in. This one's got baby blue and this
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.400]  one's got baby blue. I get baby blue. This one has fucking canary yellow, but this one doesn't,
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.920]  there's no yellow coming in this cross as a dominant trait. That's kind of a real easy way
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.680]  of putting it, man. Instead of getting real technical on there, you're basically looking
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:19.640]  for the marbles that match. Yeah. So to get a little bit more technical on it, the reason
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:28.280]  like we backcross things kind of for our own reasons that don't really make sense. Like when
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:35.080]  Tony says that, you know, we don't do shit the way that other breeders do shit. Backcrossing is
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:45.160]  an example. We backcross to try and create clone only varieties in seed form. It's really just a
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:54.360]  form of trying to take like Gorilla Glue number four, create a seed line and then market those
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:05:00.520]  seeds as like, Hey, here's Gorilla Glue in seed form. That's kind of how it was presented,
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:06.360]  particularly back in the day when like Mr. Soul and other people came online and were talking
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:15.320]  about cubing as a method of taking a clone only variety and fixing all of the genetic material.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:24.440]  Now that's true in theory. If you take like Seawall Rites theoretical,
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:34.640]  what is it? The theoretical maximum for inheritance or homozygosity or like the number
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:40.960]  of alleles from the recurrent parent that you gain every year. Yeah. By like the fourth generation
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:48.400]  in theory, you're at like 90% of the genetics of the parent plant that you keep backcrossing to.
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:56.720]  However, there's this phenomenon called linkage drag. So the distance from one gene to another
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:03.040]  gene on the chromosome kind of determines the degree to which they move together. A lot of
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:09.200]  times they'll move in chunks and segments during meiosis. And the next, every time, you know, you,
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:14.160]  you take the two sides, you bring them together from the male and the female and the backcross.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:22.160]  And when that happens, you're essentially moving chunks of chromosomes. You're not really moving
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:30.000]  individual, you know, this one allele, this one gene, like it can happen, but it's not really
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:37.280]  like that. So what happens is if there was zero linkage, there was zero selection,
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:46.560]  and you take this mathematical equation, then in that scenario, you would have after four
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:53.360]  generations, 90 plus percent of the recurrent parents genome in the offspring of the backcross
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:07:00.400]  you've created. However, there is selection and there is linkage. And there is the phenomenon of
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:07.760]  linkage drag, which is bringing traits that may or may not be desirable traits from the donor parent
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:14.640]  into the recurrent parent. So you got your gorilla glue number four. If you want to do a backcross
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:19.360]  with it, and you just want to put it into seed form, it's a really good idea to use something
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:26.080]  that's really, really closely related and similar to that gorilla glue number four, because you're
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:33.440]  not creating a whole bunch of new variety in the hybrid that you've created. You're essentially
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:39.840]  creating something that's more akin to like a cousin or a F2 almost as opposed to like a full
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:46.640]  true outcross. So when people like Mycotech did that, that was a good form of selection.
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:55.760]  When Tony Green, Gene's, he's done some pretty good work. He's really, I'm impressed with what
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:03.360]  he's done. He made an inbred, what's called a recombinant inbred line and a rail is what
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.400]  you'll see them as like, well, shortened as, and he took essentially one inbred line and another
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.920]  inbred line and then cross those two inbred lines, but they were both separate gorilla glue inbred
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:24.400]  lines. And so that was a really like, that's a good real world breeding experiment that somebody
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:31.760]  did where they took scientific foundations and applied it to a breeding project and saw it
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:37.280]  through. And I mean, I've never grown the guy's stuff. I've seen the pictures. He's got some
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:45.520]  plants that look absolutely phenomenal, very, very glue like. So when you're doing, that's kind of
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:52.640]  what we've done. And it's a thing. It's just not as common as what you would find in the regular
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:59.360]  breeding world. Robert Allard, he wrote principles of plant breeding, which is like a foundational
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:06.640]  textbook. He would kind of refer to that as like a true, like if you take a plant and do a
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:14.080]  back crossing so many generations that you've really truly taken a clone only and put it into
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:21.520]  seed form and the population's incredibly uniform and it breeds true. He believes that that is a true
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:30.000]  back cross that is like real and true unto itself. He also thinks that that's not really practical
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.880]  and most people don't do it and it doesn't make sense in the agricultural setting, typically
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:42.800]  speaking. It does make sense in a different context, which is the integration of new traits.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:50.480]  And that's really what most back cross breeding is for. They're saying, okay, I want, you know,
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:57.200]  smooth seeds as opposed to rough seeds, or I want disease resistance. And really the technique is
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:04.960]  most generally applied to disease resistance breeding. You've got some germplasm that has
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:11.760]  proven disease resistance. You want to take that trait and put it into the background of another
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:20.480]  elite cultivar. And so now you've got like powder mildew resistant gorilla glue number four,
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:27.920]  and you do a back cross project that is specifically designed to only transfer that specific
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:36.480]  allele or set of alleles if it's a QTL that will actually produce the resistance trait in the
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:43.040]  offspring and then breed it. And there's a different method if it's a recessive or a dominant
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:47.440]  trait, there's different ways that you will do it. If it's recessive, it requires a lot more
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:53.440]  selfing in between generations of back crossing, but it's all been laid out. It's all been
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:59.760]  theoretically proven and demonstrated across a whole host of different crops from barley to wheat
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:08.400]  to rice. It's very common in rice species or breeding. And that's what you do. That's,
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.600]  you're saying like, okay, I have this trait and I want to get this trait into something that's
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:22.720]  already proven to be good, but lacks the particular trait of interest. And that's something that we
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:29.120]  don't really do as much. Like you don't see that really as the, cause we don't have the,
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:37.440]  we haven't targeted traits as well, so to speak. It's not like we're like, aside from auto flowering,
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.200]  I think auto flowering is probably one of the few instances where this breeding method has really
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:50.640]  been applied and we're like, okay, here's a targeted trait. I can do this thing and demonstrate
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:59.760]  and prove and see very clearly that I've taken and stabilized this, you know, recessive trait
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:05.760]  in a population through back crossing and selfing over multiple generations. So that's,
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.400]  when you're back crossing, that's what you're doing. If you're doing it, there are two different
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:15.520]  types of selection. There's foreground selection, which is the trait you're trying to introgress.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:23.200]  Then there's background selection, which is the trait that, or is the whole host of traits
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:29.200]  in the genome of the recurrent parent. So the plant that you have that you're trying to
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:37.760]  recreate with one single new trait is background selection. So you're trying to get as much of that
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.960]  reproduced with only the genetics that produce the one trait of interest.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:52.400]  That's back cross breeding. And yeah, people we've done, I don't mean to knock it. People
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:58.320]  have done really good back cross breeding. I think people have successfully demonstrated that they
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:06.960]  can take a clone only variety and put it into seed form in a relatively stable form with good
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:13.840]  results coming from, you know, the people who want to buy these types of seeds. It's just not
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:20.320]  really what's as common in the seed industry. And that just has a lot to do with the degrees
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:28.960]  of development of the cultivars and the seed industry themselves. Like in rice, like they've
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:34.640]  got elite cultivars. They've got agriculture, like there are thousands of acres around the world
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:42.480]  under cultivation of very specific, elite fucking varieties that are yielding X amounts. And then
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:48.160]  there's a problem and they're like, oh shit, now we got to deal with this thing. Oh, how can we
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:54.560]  deal with this problem? Let's get this straight into it. That's why that's kind of explains the
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:14:00.880]  difference. There's not a right or wrong way. It's just different. And I think that people have done
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:07.600]  a really good job with back cross breeding. So yeah, I haven't seen any of the comments.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.850]  They're all hurling insults at you.
[02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:18.130]  I don't. I'm joking. I'm joking. I just let it ride.
[02:14:20.850 --> 02:14:25.250]  They can comment on me. You got a comment. Hit me up, man. I like that.
[02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:27.730]  Hit me in my DMs.
[02:14:30.690 --> 02:14:32.610]  We got comments.
[02:14:32.770 --> 02:14:33.410]  Comments.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:47.920]  Outcrossing to a sibling, like, yeah. So full sibling breeding, you're going to get more of the,
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:56.080]  it's typically not referred to outcrossing, but I see how it can be considered that. Because
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:02.320]  you're getting more of the genetic material from the sibling than if you were to just use
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:10.560]  selfing. And so if you self it, like Tyler was mentioning earlier, and Tony's mentioned as well,
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:17.440]  you're going to be getting about 50% of that genome reproduced in each successive generation.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:24.800]  And you're going to amplify homozygosity by selfing at a faster rate by selfing than
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:30.480]  full sib breeding. Because when you're doing full sib breeding, you're doing that at a theoretical
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:37.600]  rate of about 0.25%. So you're only getting about a quarter of the rate of homozygosity
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:43.200]  each generation. So that's why it takes about seven to 10 generations to reach the same level
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.560]  of homozygosity by sibling breeding relative to selfing where it's like three to four generations.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:56.880]  Yeah. Someone here says twins. That would be a good way to go too. If you got a polyembryonic
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:02.720]  seed that gives you males and females, breed with that mother. I made the mistake two years ago.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.120]  I found triplets in my Scorpius and one of them was a male. And at the time I was breeding with
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:12.800]  the Redwood and I just came back to growing again, being handicapped and just lost my legs. So I
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.120]  didn't have the space to take care of more males than one. So I threw the male away from that
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:22.880]  triplet. And I've also had a male pop out of regular twins. But if you can get twins and
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.320]  you get a male and a female out of there, breed out of those things, because they're going to be
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:32.560]  the closest thing you can get without actually selfing one of those damn plants. And hopefully
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:38.000]  you get one of those twins as an actual replication of the mom. And then the other
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.360]  one is going to be a combination of the two plants that created it. So if it was a self-plant,
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:50.240]  that's what's weird. I've seen what looked like a male come out of femmed twins. It was weird.
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:54.800]  I don't know if that thing... It had to have been pollinated by something else, man. Someone that
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.240]  told me that they were feminized seeds and I ended up getting a twin out of there that showed
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.920]  a male. And I'm like, man, you must not know shit about breeding, brother. I don't see how you get
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:05.600]  a male out of twins that you feminized. You got some stray pollen somewhere, dude.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:13.040]  But if you know 100% for a fact that it isn't stray pollen and it was like a regular seed,
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.920]  grow a male, female that created that seed and you end up with a male out of there and a female,
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.400]  breed them suckers. You're going to have a way better luck at inbreeding that line that you want.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.760]  It'll just be... And it's going to be rare because I can't think of anyone else that's
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.720]  women breeding with twins. I use twins in my breeding, but not to breed together.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.560]  I've used the 707 twins that I had and I've used crosses that I've made with that.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.520]  But I only did that to test what the male side was doing. I use twin females to tell me what my male
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:52.480]  was going to show because those two twins are going to show me what's coming out of that line
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:18:00.160]  more than if I just used like two different lines that weren't related at all. I like doing weird
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:05.520]  stuff, man. I like, you know, I've always been like the shoot from your hip and play around.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:10.800]  I make fruit tree varieties. I'm rubbing pollen and mango trees and fucking apple trees and all
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:17.360]  kinds of shit walking around. I'm making seeds of corn and I just do wild shit when I'm walking
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.880]  out there. But when I do lots of back crossings and stuff, I'll go back cross to PAM 1 and then
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:30.640]  I'll go through that stuff and then I might back cross to PAM 15 and I'll keep it all on the same
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:35.280]  line. Then I might out cross it to a resin male and a completely different line and then come
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:42.640]  back to a back cross someplace else. And it's just like all those seeds, you know, it's a fun way to
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:49.920]  go. But when you keep coming back to the same mom and you can really isolate things by playing and
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:58.240]  just running through them and jumping around, it's taught me a fuck load about what plants do.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.720]  And my favorite thing is to find out what males do and who passes who and who's a good male for
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:09.920]  this and who's a good male for that. And I recently just killed a PAM, it was a PAM F3 male that I was
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:16.480]  selected to make the F4 generation and he made everything pineapple and this turf profile that I
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:22.240]  just, it's one of my least favorite ones in the line and he passed out. He was like the master of
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:28.720]  that turf profile. Everything of every type of strain he touched, he put on that turf profile.
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:34.400]  So he just got killed and I have to go back to the drawing board and look at the F3s again and see
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:38.480]  what males I can pull out and see if I can get something to, you know, change that up a little
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:43.600]  bit. Cause that's, that was a wrong turn, you know, so just fun. It's fun to play around. So
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:50.080]  But that's interesting. Is that something you don't personally like, but someone else may like it,
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:56.160]  right? Yeah. Oh yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Definitely. I've got tons of, I got bags of seeds like that,
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:59.840]  you know, where I'm like, I don't, I don't really like it. I wouldn't enjoy it. And like,
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:03.200]  people are like, dude, I love that. Like, what are you gonna, you know, it's like, I,
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.200]  I'm not going to have time to work that. I don't, I don't like it. You know,
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:12.240]  it's not something that I do. So, and sometimes that happens, you know, where you find something
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:18.480]  and you kind of figure out like with my males, you take one male and you breed them with,
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:25.920]  you know, six or seven, you know, different types of females. And you look for the similarities
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:30.960]  between its offspring and you can kind of see kind of what kind of what the male kind of brings to
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.960]  the table. I mean, it's not, it's kind of a rough kind of ugly way to look at it, but it's like,
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:40.960]  that's how, that's how I see a lot of what, what he does and what he brings. And just after doing
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:45.600]  it for a long time, I found that male, like that, that recent milk. So I wanted to make these at
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:49.520]  fours and I've been trying to make it and I keep going to, you know, but I'm not going to continue
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:54.320]  that one with that, but it's, it's just fucking cool, man. I'm happy to be here talking about this
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:02.240]  shit. I have a totally random question, which, and, and other people have asked this and I was
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:10.800]  like, that makes me curious. How come like breeders sell seeds and you can.
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:22.960]  That's my Scorpio triplet. The two, the two big ones were females and that little tiny one was
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:29.920]  a male, but I ended up letting the male go. It was a bad mistake. It was bad. That's a Maui
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:39.120]  Waui crossed my angel. That's radical. But my question was going to be how come no one
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:44.800]  sells pollen? Go ahead.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:55.920]  I'm just on the, on the internets. I've seen it, I think on Strangely and some other cats have
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:02.480]  posted, I think Sunleaf Labs, I think maybe was somebody who was thrown up. I could totally just
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.360]  have pulled that out and been wrong, but like, I know I've seen some cats throw pollen up.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:14.480]  There's definitely like pollen's been traded for years and years, you know, like people will,
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:22.320]  if you got a good male, a lot of times people will either trade the males or try and keep the males
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:29.280]  alive and use them for breeding projects together. Or, you know, I've definitely shared pollen with
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:37.840]  friends. I used to just grow a stupid amount of males and just collect the pollen to collect the
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:45.520]  pollen. A lot of it was lost in the fire, but you know, that shit happens. But yeah, that's,
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:53.360]  that's something that I think, there's another dude up in Oregon who like, that's all he does
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:59.760]  is like males, like he grows males in massive quantities. I talked to him at,
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:05.360]  at- How does it prove- What's that?
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:11.120]  How does someone prove on, if they're growing a massive amount of males, that any of those males
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:17.920]  have any proof of breeding? How did that person prove that the F2s or F3s, any of the traits that
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:22.160]  are said that the male's carrying without actually breeding those out is what I would
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.440]  ask a person that's growing males and offering pollen.
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:33.920]  No, so the dude that I, up in Oregon, he's got like, he basically has a pollen bank. I don't
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:40.960]  know the degree to which, like how he's releasing it, but he sounded, he was the first person that
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:47.760]  I've ever met who's like so much more juiced on males than like females and cannabis. Like the
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:57.120]  dude was 100% all about it. And I think because of it, he had something where he had produced more
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:02.880]  seeds or something than anybody in the state of Oregon. And it doesn't stop before they close
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:11.200]  their metric thing. So like he has like the most vast collection of seeds that are in metric. And
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:18.080]  he's not like a phylos cat. He's like a crazy dude. He's like, I like fucking, I like to fuck
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:22.640]  with big ones. I like big ones too. I was just wondering, because I've seen cats that are out
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:28.320]  there selling pollen that I've never seen like make a seed or like even show it grow. And then
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:33.440]  they're offering pollen dudes for a hundred dollars a vial. And then they're pretending
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.040]  that they've got an SFV male or some shit. And they're like, well, what are you talking about,
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:41.440]  dude? Like that's a clone only line that you're selling. I've seen a hundred people selling
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:46.560]  cherry pie pollen from a male of a cherry pie. And like, for me, when it comes down to it,
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:55.120]  the amount of grains that a, you know, one male plant can produce, like every one of those flowers
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:02.640]  can produce 300,000 grains of pollen. Each one of grain pollen can make a seed. So how is somebody
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:09.120]  selling a vial of pollen from a proven male for anything less than the price of maybe, you know,
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.920]  10% of what they mathematically can make from the amount of seeds that you got to get paid off of
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.720]  a proven male. Otherwise you might as well just breed for that person and give them a seed stock
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:26.880]  and a proven P1 stock in the atmosphere we're in now to give that out to people for these pennies
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:32.800]  on the dollar is kind of, uh, it's kind of odd. I mean, if that cat's really got a large seed
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.360]  stock like that, to me, I would think he would want to hold his pollen back as much as possible
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:42.800]  and offer the seeds to folks because that pollen is just going to turn into a hundred different
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.720]  new seed banks. There's a hundred different dudes and open a seed bank in three months because they
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:50.560]  just put some clones in a room and drop that pollen they bought off a dude. And now they're
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:55.600]  fucking brand new seed breeder in the new state that just went medically legal because nobody
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:00.480]  there has been, they've been too scared to even go public and ask people questions. Like when I
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:06.000]  met my buddy brain man, that's been testing for me for like 12 years now. Um, when he first, I'm
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.560]  the first dude he talked to publicly about cannabis on Facebook, right. And even anywhere publicly,
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:14.320]  because in the state he was in, he was afraid of going to jail for saying the word cannabis and
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.880]  shit. And he saw me talking about cannabis so much. One day he hits me up in the direct message
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.640]  and asked me something about growing. And I'm like, here, dude, I'll send you all the seeds
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:27.120]  you want. You ain't got to worry about shit, dude. He's afraid to buy seeds. He's afraid to talk
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:31.200]  about it. So I'm like, just grow what you can tell me what it does for you. Cause the cat had
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:35.600]  real bad PTSD and some other medical conditions. So it was actually helping him out, but this was
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:42.400]  before Michigan even went legal. So he was scared to hell know what to do, but he never cloned a
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:49.040]  plant. He never was breeding plants. All he wanted to do was grow females and grow medicine. So
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.440]  that's what he started doing for me. And then he ended up, he'd be testing for all kinds of people
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.440]  when they found out what the, like what he actually put into testing a plant. He didn't
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.240]  just send you a picture and go, it was cool, man. Like he told you the plant was pest resistant,
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:07.840]  mold resistant. Like he would literally try to get him to die in a room where he would let it get
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.680]  down to like 28 degrees in the room, consistently and shit. And I'm like, dude, you're crazy as fuck
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:20.240]  like nobody's going to grow my weed in the middle of 28 degrees. Right. I really don't need to know
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.440]  that one, but like I'm testing that dude, there's people that live here that might need your shit.
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:30.720]  I'm like, all right, dude. So for years, he's got them in his basement,
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:37.520]  the room that's got fuck an ice block coming through the wall and shit every year. It's
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.360]  fucking ice damn on the wall. And it's probably pictures of this shit. I'm like,
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.040]  there's fucking ice hanging on your wall in the groomer, dude. How the fuck are you doing that
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.880]  shit? It's like, I don't give a fuck. The plants make it and the bad ones. I did. That's all I
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.280]  cared about. You know? So that's how he got into fucking, just fucking around with cannabis. So
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.320]  there's all different ways to start getting into it. You don't have to do it scientifically. You
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.240]  don't have to do it like the next dude. Oh, you got the next guy. As long as that's not your
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:08.480]  hustle, you're good to go. Cause eventually you'll be able to fucking offer your stuff to somebody
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:12.960]  for something, trade money, whatever it is. But don't let that be the reason that it started
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:17.520]  your shit because we're going to fucking just start slaying the people. That's what I fear
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.520]  about selling pollen because every vial is going to, you can put that on one plant and you got
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:27.360]  yourself 20 or 30,000 seeds. Like if you know what you're doing, put that pollen on the correct time.
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:32.320]  You got seeds for fucking pollen is like, you know, it's one of those things where you gotta,
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:36.480]  you got, if you're going to buy it, you should have like a paper of like,
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:43.680]  this male's tested like results. Like what is cannabinoid ratio is like pictures and,
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:51.120]  you know, tangible evidence of this male's certification of authenticity, shit like that.
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:56.160]  And then being stored properly. Like you don't store pollen properly. It's wet. It doesn't,
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:01.200]  you get it where it goes or they open it and it's a real humid day or it's cold. And they,
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:07.040]  you know, I mean, pollen's a dangerous, very, you know, volatile thing if you're not like
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:10.400]  familiar with using it. And if you're going to be buying pollen, you're probably not super
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:18.320]  familiar with using it. So it's more dangerous. You know, it's very fine. And those males that
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:21.760]  you're growing are worth a lot. Like you're saying, man, I mean, you're wasting space.
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:27.200]  You're wasting fucking time. If you're selling a real fucking male, it's got, you know, good
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:31.920]  qualities that you want to breed with that you've tested and you've spent time growing and putting
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:39.440]  through the ringer and all those things that you do. Then you got to collect the pollen. You've
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:43.360]  got to make sure you fucking store it right. And then you go out and sell that, share it. And it's
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:47.200]  like, man, that's it, you know, that's, that's worth something, you know? So, and then that's
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:51.520]  worth a lot of work. You're holding like direct, like, you know, direct work.
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:54.320]  Yeah. That's something like you can pass on to the next generation.
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:58.800]  Yeah. I'll share and give pollen to anybody and stuff. But, you know, it just, it's like,
[02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:03.200]  it's really hard to know whose pollen is what and why would you do it and what you're doing?
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.520]  And it's just like, was it a clean room? There's just so many fucking variables that like, you
[02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:10.960]  should just grow your own fucking plant, learn how to grow your own male and collect your own
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:15.680]  pollen. And that's why I put that post up the other day with fucking a couple of male flowers
[02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:20.880]  bent over in a fucking dish with, on fucking, you know, parchment paper, you know, collecting
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:25.040]  pollen after a few days, right before the open, you know, stupid stuff like that. So you can just
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:29.760]  collect it and get used to get your hands dirty and making some fucking seeds, you know? So,
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:33.600]  but yeah, it's, you know, selling pollen will eventually be a thing, I think,
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:38.400]  you know, with all those certificates and like, you know, and like the vapor packs and like all
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:43.760]  guaranteed fresh and all that shit. I guarantee it, you know, one of these days there'll be some
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:47.280]  weird shit like that, but. Yeah, but that's, it's just odd to me that.
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:53.200]  I don't know. I say you find your own male. I like finding them.
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:56.160]  I prefer to buy the seeds and dig through them.
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:58.480]  I'll give you seeds.
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:02.960]  Yeah, man. I'd rather dig through the seeds and start line reading the way I want to go
[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:07.920]  instead of using someone else's work. Like I held my male for fucking 15 years, right? I had it
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:13.680]  tested. I reversed it. I bred it to 144 different girls. So I knew what it could do. You know,
[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:19.520]  I could steal blood pictures from every one of the crosses if I needed to. So when something
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:23.760]  hit, I was like, can I get some of that pollen? And you're like, well, like you can get it. I
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.720]  crossed it on a bunch of other females while it's available in 10 seeds in a pack. Right.
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:31.920]  And they're always like, well, what do you mean? That's kind of stingy. And I'm like, well, man,
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:37.520]  you know how much work I've put into carrying this plant around with me for 15 years and testing it
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:42.800]  and crossing it and how many people I ran it through to make sure the medicinal side of it
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:47.360]  worked for what I said it could do. And then you want to buy a vial of it for a hundred dollars.
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:53.680]  And it's like, well, that's kind of odd, right? You know, it's just it's just the odd thing to
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:57.840]  think that that's what people are going. I grew up like if someone's a senior or a veteran or
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:01.840]  really sick, I'm like, here's some pollen, dude, make your seeds and grow them. But usually someone
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:09.040]  that's dying just needs the plant. They don't have time to start making seeds. So I'd rather
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:14.880]  just leave them the plant if they want to grow it. You know, with the business side of cannabis
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:19.520]  right now, like you're saying, it has to be tested. There's got to be a certificate on the plant.
[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:24.960]  And the chemotype needs to be tracked. It should have breeding proof on it. If it's going to be
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:30.000]  used for breeding, because people are going to pick it up and instantly start making a seed
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.120]  company. It happens every day. You can go on Instagram and see people getting into fights
[02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:38.880]  over them that were trading pollen because one of them put the pollen on a female. He wasn't
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:45.200]  supposed to and started this company. It's just a plant. What are we fighting over, dude?
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:54.320]  Yeah, that is one of the things that's unique and peculiar about cannabis breeders like.
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:05.200]  You're not. Essentially, when the MSP was found, like the you posted that about the
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:13.600]  a male sterility, Tony, in cannabis, when they found that in corn, it wasn't like,
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:20.800]  oh, shit, don't let this out. Don't tell the next guy. It was like, well, we found this trade
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:27.600]  and we can fucking read it into every male line. It comes from the female line, but they
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:33.840]  read it in every male line. And then it just became like so fucking ubiquitous that like
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:39.760]  all fucking corn had it. And then the fucking southern corn blight happened and it happened to
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:46.640]  like be the thing that attacked that one fucking thing. And like we had to be like, oh, shit. But
[02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:55.920]  that like while a cautionary tale is still an example of the fact that like we're particularly
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:04.240]  territorial and possessive of like the males in particular, because the thing that we found that
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:09.440]  is like the hard thing to find, like most motherfuckers can find a keeper female if
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:15.200]  they get access to enough seeds, like you get enough seeds, you go through enough. Eventually,
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:20.560]  you're going to find something that's unique and above and beyond other things in your growing
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:27.600]  environment in particular. And so that's something that it's like anybody can pick a female,
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.240]  not anybody can pick a male one because most people aren't growing them into because a lot
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.120]  of people don't have experience growing them and haven't seen what they do when they're given the
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:42.720]  opportunity to really express that their full potential, the frosty like I've never reversed
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:50.000]  the male, mostly because I was like anti chemical for a long time and was like, oh, that's bad and
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  not organic, but not like now, if I was growing out a bunch of males, I'd fuck with that shit
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:04.560]  hella hard. But the point is, is that when I see people doing reversals with males or
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:12.320]  selecting for males, like that is something that is very peculiar to our particular way of breeding.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:19.040]  And it's true, there's a lot about like, that is the thing that most breeders are able to do who
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:26.320]  are over and above your average breeder. So your average breeder who's making seeds and hitting
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:35.600]  every elite clone is they're generally selecting subpar males, the really true good breeders are
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:42.320]  the people who are selecting very good males. And hell, I don't give a fuck how you want to breed
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:47.920]  if the commercial market demands that you make polyhybrids and hit that to every elite clone on
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.760]  the market just so that you can have the fucking this and that and the thing that's like, because
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:57.200]  most people are buying off of progeny and names, then like do what you got to do to make your money
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:05.760]  and like what's out there. There's value to that. It's not necessarily the way other breeding is
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:13.600]  done. But it's recurrent selection, like we talked about earlier for particularly high value traits,
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:20.400]  or really a suite of high value traits that we've selected for that's flowering time,
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:27.760]  yields, and the ability to do this shit monocrop indoors as well as like absolutely key. So
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.400]  those sorts of things, like yeah, you'll run the risk of hybrids, you'll get lots of variation,
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:40.480]  or excuse me, of herms, not hybrids. You run the risk of getting herms because things haven't been
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:47.120]  locked down and we haven't really even I mean, fuck scientists have like, one of the more study
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:53.440]  elements of the cannabis plant is sex determinism. And you read plant like studies even recently,
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:58.640]  they're still like, that shit's kind of a fucking mystery. You know, it's like part of it's the
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:05.440]  chromosome part of it's the X autosome fucking dosage relationship. And so there's these other
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:12.080]  parts of the genome that are determining sex that are independent of the actual chromosomes.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.440]  And then you have all these environmental variables. Speaking of QTLs, fucking there's
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.840]  a really good paper on the subject by this person named Faux, I don't know, F-A-U-X,
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:34.000]  I think is how it's spelled. Faux or Fox, 2014. And they identify a, they do genetic genomic testing
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:39.920]  of some minocious cannabis plants and some diocious cannabis plants. And they demonstrate
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:51.200]  that these cannabis that there is a QTL that controls for sex expression in cannabis that is
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.520]  in addition to the chromosome. And that this QTL is tightly linked with light sensitivity.
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:08.080]  Everybody knows that shit herms because of fucking lights. Yeah, that paper, great paper.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:13.040]  And everybody knows that one of the main environmental factors that can cause your
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:21.920]  shit to herm is light leaks. Well, this paper kind of demonstrated that there is one, this QTL
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:29.040]  that helps to determine sex determination in cannabis and two, that it's tightly linked to
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:36.080]  sensitivity to disruptions of the photo period. So that kind of explains a lot about what we know
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:43.440]  about hemp, but they still, or excuse me, of cannabis and hermaphrodites, but they still
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:51.840]  don't know all of the ins and outs and haven't figured out the evolution of monocy versus diocy
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.360]  and how that happened. There's a fucking really cool paper that just came out like December 29th
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:06.000]  on the subject that looks at the evolution of diocy, of sex determinism in cannabis. And
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:15.120]  they're like, fuck, it's complicated. It's not a simple, straightforward answer. So point being,
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:23.920]  yeah, science is really cool. And cannabis is just now being scienced in a really
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:32.000]  intensive way. It's cool to go back as we started this whole thing, like 100 years and look,
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:37.360]  and I'm going to do a bunch of posts all about the history of cannabis and in the scientific
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:43.760]  literature for different topics. But it's right now, like every day cutting edge shit.
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:52.800]  There's new studies that have come out just this year that are really shitting light, even if
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.640]  they're not solving the mystery of things like sex determinism, hermaphroditism, how that's
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.640]  actually happening. But the more that we understand these things, the more we'll be able to apply them
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:09.200]  in our breeding. And eventually we might be able to get out of breeding hermaphrodites.
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:16.640]  Also, another thing that got brought up, somebody said, reference, why does everybody call polyhybrid
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:23.840]  cross the polyhybrid in F1? So there's kind of really the reason for that is because
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:31.520]  there's in and out crossing population where you have really high degrees of heterozygosity.
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:38.640]  It's assumed that when you don't really know the lineage of the plants and you can't really prove
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:44.560]  the pedigree and be like, yeah, this is inbred because they share these lines of descent.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:52.080]  They just kind of say like, fuck, because there's so much additive variance every time a polyhybrid
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:59.200]  is made. So every time a new gene pool, so you take like, you know, your OG, you take your
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:05.360]  chem, and even if they may be slightly related, they're also somewhat distinct. And then you take,
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.240]  you know, fuck, like, I'm going to go to the old ones. If you take your Northern Lights,
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:16.560]  you take your fucking Haze and you take your skunk and they're all from different variety,
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.520]  from different gene pools. And then you start mixing all of them together. And then you start
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:27.200]  mixing in your OGs and you start mixing in your chems and you start mixing in your cookies and
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:32.160]  your ERCLS and all these different things. Essentially, all you're doing is continually
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:38.080]  hybridizing and increasing additive variance through the hybridization process. So you're not
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:43.920]  actually inbreeding, even though they may be fucking cousins to a certain extent. And even
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:51.120]  though there's like this massive set of star phylogenies of like this clone only and that clone
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.960]  only and this clone only are like connected to fucking everything that everybody's growing.
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:05.440]  They're also so intensely hybridized that they're not actually in a state of homozygosity that is
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:10.560]  really discernible. And so when you have an outcrossing population like this, they just
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:16.320]  kind of shrug their shoulders and they're like, well, they're basically all F1s, even though there
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:25.040]  is some degree of relation and there may be some amount of homozygosity within this F1 population
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:34.400]  more so than you would have in like a true F1 population, so to speak. Now, the real difference
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:40.400]  here is that we just get additive variance. We get lots of variation. We get lots of phenotypes.
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:46.960]  We get lots of difference coming up in these crosses because we're not working with line
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:53.600]  bred varieties that have then been hybridized that cross and segregate in predictable ways.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:43:01.600]  And so that's really the distinction. So when George H. Schull did his pure line experiment
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:09.920]  in like 1903 to like 1909, he basically inbred a bunch of corn. And then after it was super
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.920]  inbred, he then hybridized that and was like, holy shit, all the offspring are super uniform
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:22.400]  and they yield way more than the fucking inbred lines that I was just growing. Other dude, E.M. West,
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:28.800]  he did the exact same study or experiment, essentially found the exact same thing
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:35.600]  at the exact same time, though independently. And him and his student were like, yeah, this works,
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:41.200]  but it's not practical because your inbreeding depression is so great that you're not really
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.640]  producing seeds in an economical way. So they're like, well, fuck it. Let's do double crosses where
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:53.280]  we take this sort of F1 and this F1 and then we cross those. Well, there's more additive variance
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:44:00.800]  and more hybrid vigor in the offspring or in the parent material, excuse me, because they're
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:06.160]  already there to F1s and then they're crossing them. And so there's more variation in the
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:13.520]  offspring. There's increased yields, but it doesn't perform the same way that single crosses
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:22.400]  would about a decade later. And it just took things like CMST, the fucking Texas male sterility
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:28.480]  in corn that they were able to breed into every other line that then made it economical because
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:34.160]  otherwise you'd have to go through and detassel all the fucking corn. So like, it was technological
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:40.400]  advances. It was a number of things that made it like improved inbred lines. These things made it
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:49.040]  so that it was practical, but then do true F1 hybrids. Now, what we've experienced is instead,
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:56.960]  just a situation where because it's an outcrossing population and because we have constant new
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:05.280]  plants, it was the different varieties that were coming in through the export markets of the 60s,
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:10.720]  70s and 80s. And then more of the hybridization process that happened in the Western,
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:18.320]  sort of cannabis world from the 60s to the present. All of those things have just largely
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:23.600]  focused on additive variance as opposed and recurrent selection for a certain set of traits
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:30.080]  without actually doing the line breeding, except for a few exceptions. Watson with the skunk one
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:38.720]  and a bunch of other shit that's now just with GW Pharmaceuticals. And then other folks with
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:47.680]  EJ Short with his lines. There are other people who have done line breeding. I mentioned Tony
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:53.120]  Greenbeans earlier. He's done some interesting line breeding. Tom Hill did some really good work.
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:58.640]  So there have been people who have done line breeding, but it's been few and far between.
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.440]  And once we get it, we then just, you know, everybody makes a fucking hybrid of it. And very
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:10.640]  few people keep that shit pure. And once you hybridize something, you're really, it's almost
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:17.040]  impossible to, it basically is impossible to return to the unhybridized state.
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:23.920]  Even if, but yeah, even with selection, like independent assortment and segregation's a bitch
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:40.400]  on that level. Well, I, I'm ready for bed. And does anyone support that idea?
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:47.760]  Yeah. Yeah. I got, I got, I got wrestling in there, so I'm sure she'll be happy.
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:54.640]  So, so just quickly tomorrow morning, we're going to kick off kind of the world tour. We're going to
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:04.560]  do a South African spotlight that is at 10am Pacific time. I believe on FCP2.
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:10.400]  Which has been just lurking in the background. And then tomorrow afternoon, we're going to do a
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:22.960]  BOG fundraiser. That's 2pm again, Pacific time. So thanks to the 350 people who are
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:30.880]  still watching at 11 at night Pacific time. I like this. I mean, I basically Trevor,
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:36.240]  I saw your post and I was like, I just like to hear him talk about what he learned from
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:43.520]  reading those books from the 1800s. And I was like, I'm going to go with that.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:46.320]  I'm going to go with that. I'm going to go with that. I'm going to go with that.
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:49.760]  Talk about what he learned from reading those books from
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:54.320]  the 1800s and not have to read them myself.
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:06.560]  So I appreciate it. We'll, we'll get this Motley crew back together soon.
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:14.320]  Mr. Toad, thank you. Tyler. Tyler has some beans available.
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:19.760]  Get them while you can, man. I don't, you know, don't make a lot.
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:27.520]  At that website right there. Maybe we'll see some Mr. Toad beans there soon. And Trevor,
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:35.680]  do you have stuff available, Trevor? I mean, I don't really sell seeds.
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:46.480]  I got seeds, make seeds. People want seeds. I might have seeds. I don't know.
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:54.560]  I've never really done this for like selling them and don't like it someday I may, but yeah,
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:49:04.160]  if people want seeds, hit me up. Yeah. I mean, I definitely, you know,
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:15.760]  on a final note the fire relief we've been doing that it's definitely, you know, the holidays hit,
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:26.160]  there was some unwanted authorities involved in law enforcement. Yeah. So that's been, you know,
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:32.320]  that really sucked, but people are plugging away and getting things back online. And I do have
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:40.000]  seeds available through there. I just put in a bunch of 88 G13 hash plant seeds that a buddy and
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:48.080]  I, we just increased them. So there wasn't really any selection. It's just a increase on long
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:55.280]  maintained line. And I wanted to put them in to just like throw them in as like freebies to people
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:50:00.720]  who went over and above and we're really getting down for the options and everything. But a couple
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:06.960]  of packs have been put up. So like some will be thrown in as freebies for people who, you know,
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:13.920]  really throw down for the auctions. Others will be thrown in as independent, like little things
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:19.040]  that get put up for auction. And I've got more stuff if people are interested, like I can put
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:25.440]  it up through that or whatever. I kind of though, you know, I consider myself a pollen chucker. I do
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:31.920]  not consider myself like a breeder because I don't have the space currently. And it's not like
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:38.800]  before I was doing this shit in a scientific way that I felt comfortable selling to the public. So
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:44.160]  like that's where I stand on it. But if people are interested, I'll let things out just so people can
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:50.560]  grow. So it's always about the space, man. Sometimes the knowledge backs up the breeding,
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:56.480]  man. So when you can back up what you're talking about there, like you do, that puts a lot of weight
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:51:00.800]  behind anything that you've put pollen on, man. You know, that's one thing I'll say. You don't
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:05.600]  have to have 10,000 square feet to do your breeding. You don't have to have 4,000 people to
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:09.680]  run your plants through. You just have to have the knowledge of what the hell you're doing
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:14.000]  to get out of the plants what you want out of them. So respect to what you're doing, man. I'll
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:20.480]  tell you that. Everyone, I want to say, because there's a lot of people in here that help
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:26.080]  out when I did some raffles for Bog to raise some money. I just want to tell anyone that's on here
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:30.720]  face to face so you guys can see me. Thank you for everybody that helped out on that.
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:34.560]  And if you couldn't get on that one, make sure you guys tune in tomorrow to help out because
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:42.400]  Bog, he was a pioneer in breeding for the early days for all of us. If you haven't read his book,
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:46.560]  go get his book, man. I can't remember the exact title. Dude, I had it right here. I think I shared
[02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:53.760]  it the other day. One second. The man did a lot of breeding. And we've been talking about
[02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:58.560]  Gorilla Glue tonight, but that line wouldn't be here if Bog wouldn't throw pollen on a plant.
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:05.280]  Chucking can always lead to something special. But if you guys can help, I want to say please
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:08.800]  do. And if you already have, I want to tell you face to face, thank you, man. I can't shake your
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:20.150]  hand. I wish I could. I love you. We got the glitch.
[02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:25.510]  We got the thank you, though. So that's good. There he is.
[02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:31.830]  At his back. I'm trying to find his book right here. Bushy old growers books. I can show
[02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:37.590]  everybody. Bonanza of Green. If y'all can get a hold of that thing, man. Read his book. It's
[02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:41.590]  early days. Let me get this picture to load. They had it on Amazon. Oh, man, they don't want to show
[02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:48.470]  me on Amazon. One second. I got to go to the next page. One sec. Bonanza of Green, written by
[02:52:48.470 --> 02:52:57.950]  Bushy old grower. Here we go. That would be the cover. It fully illustrated. Do it yourself guide
[02:52:57.950 --> 02:53:03.310]  to growing the highest quality medicinal marijuana indoors by Bushy old grower. A lot of people
[02:53:03.310 --> 02:53:07.070]  didn't know he wrote this. A lot of people don't know that he used to spend a lot of time on the
[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:13.150]  forums answering people's question from how to grow the plant to how to pollinate a plant to
[02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:18.350]  where can I go to buy seeds, even if they're not yours? The cat was one of the pioneers. So
[02:53:18.350 --> 02:53:22.350]  everybody in here that's been asking questions about breeding, he was a dude that asked questions
[02:53:22.350 --> 02:53:28.110]  early. And he probably might be one of the reasons why you're asking questions today. So
[02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:31.870]  just remember, if it was your family, you'd want the same kind of help. So tune in, guys.
[02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:40.190]  All right. And with that, we'll call it a night.
[02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:42.510]  Thanks, everyone.
[02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:44.910]  Right on. Thanks, everyone.
[02:53:46.430 --> 02:53:47.870]  Peace out.
