[00:00.760 --> 00:08.340]  And we are live. Thanks for waiting everyone. This is episode 13 of the James Loud show.
[00:08.340 --> 00:10.340]  There is Mr. James Loud.
[00:10.340 --> 00:16.480]  How's it going everyone? Happy Sunday. Happy holidays. Hope you guys are all well. Today
[00:16.480 --> 00:23.080]  we have JJ from Top Dog Seeds. JJ has been breeding for a long time. He's been breeding
[00:23.080 --> 00:29.440]  with a lot of authentic genetics. I feel like he breeds with intent and passion. He's one
[00:29.440 --> 00:36.510]  of the greatest breeders out there in my opinion. I'm glad to have him on my show. Welcome JJ.
[00:36.510 --> 00:44.150]  JJ may be slightly frozen. We've been doing tech support for 15 minutes.
[00:44.150 --> 00:50.390]  Sorry guys. We got some technical issues that we're trying to get over.
[00:50.390 --> 00:58.870]  So JJ, if you can hear me, maybe kill your camera. There's literally a button that says
[00:58.870 --> 01:09.870]  stop camera. But James, why don't you... Yeah, I think he'll be back in a second.
[01:09.870 --> 01:14.950]  He'll be back in a second. We had some questions. Oh, there we go. We got JJ here now.
[01:14.950 --> 01:23.170]  So JJ, can you hear me? JJ?
[01:23.170 --> 01:26.090]  Blink if you can hear us.
[01:26.090 --> 01:29.090]  Move if you can hear us.
[01:29.570 --> 01:34.570]  You're breaking up.
[01:34.570 --> 01:47.920]  Yeah. So do you see the stop camera icon, JJ? Press the stop camera button. And then
[01:47.920 --> 02:00.690]  you'll be... And then unmute your microphone. You did mute microphone, but stop camera.
[02:00.730 --> 02:06.810]  Well, now everybody else gets a little taste of our... I felt like they were missing on the tech support
[02:06.810 --> 02:14.010]  the real time. And we're going to do a tech support show with my mom, who is 84 and German.
[02:14.010 --> 02:31.290]  And that's going to be the entire episode. So JJ, the stop camera, just tap on it.
[02:31.290 --> 02:32.290]  Can you hear me?
[02:32.290 --> 02:34.810]  I think I can hear JJ and Becca.
[02:35.050 --> 02:36.290]  And I can hear him.
[02:36.290 --> 02:37.290]  Yeah.
[02:37.290 --> 02:56.400]  Rustling. JJ, can you hear us? All right. Carry on. He's back.
[02:56.400 --> 02:59.880]  I can't see you guys, though. But OK.
[02:59.880 --> 03:25.480]  OK. So JJ, can you hit the stop camera icon where it says stop camera?
[03:25.520 --> 03:27.680]  Do you see the stop camera? Can you hear me?
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.120]  All right. James, take it over, part three.
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.040]  OK, guys, well, we're waiting for JJ.
[03:42.040 --> 03:47.720]  We got some questions to answer from some of the people that have been watching the show.
[03:47.720 --> 03:50.120]  We have a guy that says I bred 10 strains.
[03:50.400 --> 03:54.080]  Male donor was regular 10 pack seeds, Durban poison.
[03:54.560 --> 04:00.440]  Great strain. One of those 10 seeds I got regular female Durban poison and the rest are
[04:00.440 --> 04:03.040]  feminized. I don't really understand that.
[04:03.080 --> 04:06.120]  So you get out of 10 seeds.
[04:06.120 --> 04:08.880]  I got a regular female and I got the rest are feminized.
[04:09.600 --> 04:12.400]  You wouldn't know if they were feminized if you got a 10 pack of seeds.
[04:12.680 --> 04:14.520]  It just that part doesn't make sense.
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.840]  And he says, I made this garden outdoors because of the late season this past season.
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.520]  I didn't have time to kept taking seeds from the plants and weekly I would be tossing them
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.680]  out in the garden. Of course, all came out female except for male Durban poisons.
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.640]  So this is a very confusing thing, because if you have a male, if you have male pollen
[04:34.640 --> 04:37.800]  going on plants, your seeds are going to be regular.
[04:37.800 --> 04:42.360]  And I think anything below it used to be 90 percent, but I would say 95 percent.
[04:42.360 --> 04:49.520]  If you have intersexual traits expressing male, that would be a male.
[04:49.800 --> 04:51.400]  I wouldn't consider those feminized seeds.
[04:51.760 --> 04:57.160]  You know, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, feminized seeds were 90 percent feminized.
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.440]  And that was acceptable. But it's not acceptable anymore.
[05:00.120 --> 05:05.320]  And personally, I feel like ninety nine point five or better should be feminized.
[05:05.320 --> 05:11.120]  I mean, you know, ninety nine point five, which is or even greater, which is like a one
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.920]  in five thousand would be ideal for expressing intersexual traits.
[05:15.920 --> 05:18.520]  But that can be perfected over time and bred in.
[05:19.160 --> 05:20.600]  So let's see what else.
[05:21.600 --> 05:28.000]  So and the next part was when you label them, male donor goes first or female.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.600]  So just think of it like if you're getting married and on the wedding invitations, it's
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.560]  always the woman's name first and then the man's name plus his last name.
[05:37.600 --> 05:40.200]  So it's the female and then the male.
[05:40.800 --> 05:42.200]  That's just basic nomenclature.
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.280]  So another I don't have the names for these strains yet, so I call them as they are for
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.880]  right now. I still have the pollen and tall pollen and short pollen.
[05:52.880 --> 05:54.080]  Durban poison kept it.
[05:54.400 --> 05:56.000]  I'm growing two plants, Kilimanjaro.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.840]  One has shorter node spacing and another has longer spacing, smaller leaves on the one
[06:00.840 --> 06:05.160]  with shorter spacing and huge leaves on the one with longer spacing.
[06:06.040 --> 06:10.840]  Great. I suppose the one with longer node spacing is ideal for expressing intersexual
[06:10.840 --> 06:15.640]  intersexual. So the one with shorter node spacing is ideal for outside and the one
[06:16.040 --> 06:18.040]  shorter for inside.
[06:19.640 --> 06:21.120]  It just depends on what you're trying to do.
[06:21.120 --> 06:26.760]  I mean, I think, you know, I think the longer like the taller ones are going to be longer
[06:26.760 --> 06:29.360]  flowering varietals and the shorter ones are typically shorter.
[06:29.360 --> 06:34.440]  But, you know, with with these kind of things, it's it can be over all over the place.
[06:34.880 --> 06:38.960]  Some people like growing longer flowering varieties indoors and some people like growing
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.240]  outdoors. It all depends on your climate.
[06:40.640 --> 06:43.280]  So because they're all originally outdoor varieties.
[06:43.280 --> 06:49.080]  Right. So you look at, you know, some places that are humid, you would want plants that
[06:49.080 --> 06:53.400]  have larger node spacing with an open bud structure.
[06:53.400 --> 06:55.040]  We talk about open bud structure a lot.
[06:55.040 --> 06:56.400]  Some people complain about it.
[06:56.720 --> 07:03.560]  But if you think of geoclimatized varieties, you would want something that has an open
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.120]  bud structure if you have a lot of humidity.
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.720]  So the moisture can go in and out of the plant without causing mold or botrytis, because
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.440]  what happens is that moisture gets captured in the calyx inside the bud.
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.320]  And when it's captured inside the bud, then it sits there.
[07:18.320 --> 07:21.960]  And if there's mold in the air, you get mold in the bud.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.000]  It's just that simple.
[07:25.040 --> 07:27.840]  You know, you can get bud rot, botrytis, there's several things.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.520]  Let's see. Lots of questions here.
[07:32.520 --> 07:38.160]  So anyway, if that doesn't answer your questions, you have other stuff, please send those.
[07:39.400 --> 07:40.120]  I guess we can go.
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.960]  Or put them in the Discord.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.320]  I love that we have the Ask James Loud channel in the Discord.
[07:47.680 --> 07:48.960]  Oh, my God. Lemon Man.
[07:51.120 --> 07:54.400]  And one, two, three.
[07:54.840 --> 07:55.800]  We got Chuck here.
[07:56.000 --> 07:56.880]  What up?
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.720]  What up, Chuck? How you doing?
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.760]  I'm good, brother. I'm sorry, you guys.
[08:00.760 --> 08:02.560]  I was having a hard time logging in, man.
[08:02.840 --> 08:04.440]  Are you a Broncos fan?
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.720]  You know what? I am a Broncos fan.
[08:06.760 --> 08:09.440]  After being there for 11 years, you're damn right I am.
[08:10.520 --> 08:15.560]  So Chuck and I are good friends, just to give you a little history on Chuck and I.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.320]  We've been hanging out at Cannabis Cups for a long time.
[08:19.760 --> 08:26.320]  We bump into each other in random places like Barcelona, Spain, Amsterdam, Colorado.
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.960]  I end up seeing him at airports, all kinds of places.
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.240]  We've been good friends.
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.200]  It's great when you bump into people randomly, like your paths are supposed to be crossed.
[08:38.480 --> 08:39.480]  How are you doing today, Chuck?
[08:39.600 --> 08:40.760]  I'm doing good, brother.
[08:40.760 --> 08:44.080]  I'm out here in Vegas right now with the family for Christmas, man.
[08:44.120 --> 08:44.800]  How are you doing?
[08:45.160 --> 08:48.640]  I'm doing good. We're having a little bit of technical difficulties with JJ.
[08:49.160 --> 08:53.120]  I think he's working some of those out, but hopefully we'll get him in.
[08:53.120 --> 08:56.160]  He's a great guy to have on the show.
[08:56.200 --> 08:57.240]  Thank you for coming on.
[08:57.400 --> 09:05.640]  I guess we can dive right into talking about your history as the Lemon Man and how that came about.
[09:06.280 --> 09:08.400]  I think there's a lot of good history there.
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.440]  And with the skunk and the skunk variety that you have, I mean, so go ahead.
[09:15.240 --> 09:16.320]  Tell us about your skunk.
[09:16.400 --> 09:21.200]  And actually, before you start talking, can you turn your phone 90 degrees like a TV?
[09:21.600 --> 09:22.600]  Let's see here.
[09:24.480 --> 09:26.280]  Oh my God, that is amazing.
[09:26.280 --> 09:27.280]  Are we better now?
[09:27.280 --> 09:28.640]  We are. We are.
[09:28.680 --> 09:29.560]  Muy bueno.
[09:29.640 --> 09:30.920]  OK. OK.
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.440]  We all got technical difficulties going on.
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.600]  Welcome to the stoner world.
[09:36.120 --> 09:37.880]  And look at that, now you're full screen.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.560]  Bam. Look at this.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.360]  Here we go.
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.040]  Doug Life.
[09:42.200 --> 09:42.920]  Doug Life.
[09:43.520 --> 09:47.240]  So, yeah, man, I mean, the Lemon Skunk originated from Vegas.
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.920]  My family, my crew, we all grew it out here back in the day, probably like mid to later 90s.
[09:54.680 --> 10:00.040]  It originated from California, but it was basically an original skunk number one, you know?
[10:01.160 --> 10:09.640]  Yeah, so there was a bunch of skunk number ones, I think, just to give people an understanding like Exodus, the cheeses, cheeses and skunk number one variety.
[10:09.920 --> 10:10.920]  Michigan skunk.
[10:11.240 --> 10:13.040]  There's a bunch of different skunk number ones.
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.480]  And it's because it's a complex polyhybrid.
[10:16.600 --> 10:21.680]  Well, it's a complex hybrid that has a lot of stuff in it that you get these different expressions.
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.320]  And so there's some that are skunky, some that are sweet, some that are lemony.
[10:25.360 --> 10:26.400]  And we got JJ.
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.320]  How you doing, JJ?
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.040]  Sorry about that.
[10:30.040 --> 10:31.640]  I had to run down into my bed.
[10:33.080 --> 10:33.840]  No problem.
[10:34.240 --> 10:35.040]  Glad to have you.
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.160]  JJ, I was having technical difficulties, too, brother.
[10:43.080 --> 10:43.800]  We're all good.
[10:44.720 --> 10:48.120]  So with skunk number one, you know how these things go.
[10:49.280 --> 10:50.280]  Yeah, for sure.
[10:50.720 --> 10:51.400]  We should have.
[10:53.560 --> 11:01.240]  So, JJ, do you see the stop camera icon on the on the bottom of the screen?
[11:02.960 --> 11:06.600]  Tap on that so that your audio only.
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.560]  Just stop your camera and then the audio will get all the bandwidth.
[11:15.080 --> 11:15.760]  Of your.
[11:16.960 --> 11:18.680]  Bonded T1 lines.
[11:21.080 --> 11:21.600]  Right.
[11:23.920 --> 11:24.520]  There we go.
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.040]  OK.
[11:27.240 --> 11:27.760]  Good.
[11:28.720 --> 11:29.920]  OK, go on, James.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.880]  OK, so we're talking about skunk number one.
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.320]  I just saw someone says this since he still sells skunk number one.
[11:35.320 --> 11:43.640]  Well, the sensei skunk number one that they're selling is not the same skunk as what Chuck has or is the Michigan skunk or is the cheese necessarily?
[11:43.960 --> 11:51.080]  You know, Buddha, our good friend Buddha Milo found a seed that was that turned out to be the cheese.
[11:51.080 --> 11:54.440]  And that was in a sense, a pack of skunk number one a long, long time ago.
[11:54.880 --> 11:56.920]  And these are all different expressions.
[11:56.920 --> 11:59.040]  And you can't find that old skunk number one.
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.200]  And the skunk number one you had was actually from California.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.120]  Correct, Chuck?
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.080]  Exactly.
[12:04.080 --> 12:10.480]  And honestly, bro, if I think back to it, I guarantee it originated from a pack from, you know, sensei back in the day.
[12:10.480 --> 12:11.000]  Probably.
[12:11.000 --> 12:11.360]  Probably.
[12:11.360 --> 12:11.880]  Oh, really?
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.720]  Back and forth thing.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.120]  That's that's my guess.
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.920]  I mean, when I first hit Amsterdam, Buddha's skunk was kind of more cheesy, as you described.
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.440]  Mine was more citrusy, you know?
[12:22.720 --> 12:36.320]  And it's funny because even out of all the seeds from the lemon skunk that I've seen, different phenos, I honestly feel that the male dominated the female because I've never really seen the original citrusy one.
[12:36.320 --> 12:38.960]  It was always more cheesy, more skunky.
[12:38.960 --> 12:39.720]  You know what I mean?
[12:40.040 --> 12:40.440]  Yeah.
[12:40.840 --> 12:43.080]  So, yeah, yours doesn't have that cheese at all.
[12:43.080 --> 12:45.040]  It's definitely it's got funk.
[12:45.080 --> 12:46.800]  It definitely has a lot of funk to it, man.
[12:46.800 --> 12:48.320]  It has this beautiful aroma.
[12:49.080 --> 12:56.400]  You get lemon and citrus and then you get this overpowering skunk and the smoke is always real, real creamy and strong.
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.320]  So exactly, exactly, man.
[12:59.320 --> 12:59.760]  Yeah.
[12:59.920 --> 13:09.120]  So, you know, it's like you say, there's a lot of different expressions, you know, but this one, that's why it made its name for the lemon skunk, because it just it was so citrusy.
[13:09.120 --> 13:17.880]  And, you know, we were talking about it in Vegas last night, me and some friends, you know, you'd walk to the bus and I mean, you'd stink up the whole block.
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.040]  You know, you'd get on the bus and you'd have 10 people asking you where a bag is, you know?
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.960]  So it was loud.
[13:24.080 --> 13:25.040]  It was loud, bro.
[13:26.120 --> 13:27.560]  Yeah, extremely loud.
[13:27.560 --> 13:28.400]  That's a great way to put it.
[13:28.400 --> 13:35.200]  So you've been curating or holding on to that strain and, you know, producing flower with it for how many years?
[13:35.440 --> 13:36.600]  Oh, shit, man.
[13:36.600 --> 13:39.520]  I mean, this has been going on, like I said, probably mid 90s.
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.240]  So let's just say 95.
[13:41.480 --> 13:43.400]  So that'd be 25 years at least now.
[13:44.040 --> 13:44.800]  Pretty amazing.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.200]  You know, I mean, it's it's still running strong and.
[13:48.560 --> 13:53.520]  Oh, it's been bred into all kinds of other stuff besides, you know, I think DNA has bred into it.
[13:54.480 --> 13:54.880]  Yeah.
[13:54.920 --> 13:57.880]  And it's just a great all around strain.
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.680]  Yeah, no, for sure.
[13:59.680 --> 14:00.440]  For sure, man.
[14:00.440 --> 14:03.320]  It's it's it's one of the legacy ones for sure.
[14:03.400 --> 14:05.000]  You know, for sure.
[14:05.400 --> 14:07.120]  So let's get into JJ.
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.640]  We got you there still, JJ.
[14:11.240 --> 14:13.720]  Yeah, he needs to JJ unmute your mic.
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.120]  JJ hit the leave studio button accidentally.
[14:22.560 --> 14:23.680]  Oh, shit, man.
[14:23.680 --> 14:26.080]  We're all having technical difficulties today.
[14:26.440 --> 14:27.080]  What a day.
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.600]  Seriously, what a day.
[14:28.600 --> 14:30.160]  Well, here he comes.
[14:30.640 --> 14:31.560]  JJ, you're back.
[14:31.560 --> 14:32.320]  Can you hear us?
[14:32.640 --> 14:33.440]  I can hear you.
[14:33.440 --> 14:34.080]  Can you hear?
[14:35.680 --> 14:36.480]  Fantastic.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.840]  We can hear you, JJ.
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.480]  So, JJ, well, let's let's talk about your history with cannabis.
[14:44.680 --> 14:46.320]  How long you've been in the industry.
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.760]  Everyone's waiting to hear from you.
[14:48.280 --> 14:49.960]  You know, I I love your work.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.360]  Everybody loves your work.
[14:51.360 --> 14:55.080]  I think you've done some really great things with the Chemdog legacy.
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.720]  Do we lose him again?
[15:06.300 --> 15:08.180]  He may be on like a 10,000.
[15:08.260 --> 15:10.820]  He may be on like a 10 second delay.
[15:15.070 --> 15:16.310]  Or or not at all.
[15:16.470 --> 15:19.670]  Or JJ, if you can hear us.
[15:22.270 --> 15:24.390]  It's like he's on a mission to Mars and we're.
[15:26.990 --> 15:27.830]  It's major time.
[15:28.070 --> 15:31.790]  So I'll tell you guys a little bit about some of the stuff, you know, JJ's done.
[15:31.790 --> 15:36.950]  And with Loud Seeds, we released Sour Diesel a long time ago.
[15:37.790 --> 15:42.670]  And we had Sour Diesel seeds that were what I thought would be a good expression
[15:42.670 --> 15:44.110]  of Sour Diesel, that.
[15:45.350 --> 15:48.830]  They were OK, you know, for their day, they were good.
[15:48.870 --> 15:50.150]  We had our seven a sour.
[15:50.150 --> 15:51.190]  We had some really good stuff.
[15:51.190 --> 15:57.550]  But as far as capturing Sour Diesel and structure, you know, I feel like we had
[15:57.550 --> 15:58.710]  some problems with the.
[15:59.190 --> 16:00.150]  Oh, you there, JJ?
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.280]  We're getting part of them.
[16:05.360 --> 16:06.280]  JJ, can you hear?
[16:07.280 --> 16:08.600]  JJ, can you hear us?
[16:08.600 --> 16:08.960]  Can you hear?
[16:12.460 --> 16:14.180]  So we can hear JJ now a little bit.
[16:15.540 --> 16:18.580]  So he's he's I just missed it.
[16:18.580 --> 16:19.180]  He's died.
[16:19.540 --> 16:21.140]  He's dialing into his Russian.
[16:29.560 --> 16:35.000]  JJ, you're laughing my mom for for at least technically confident.
[16:38.370 --> 16:40.210]  I think JJ is gone again.
[16:40.690 --> 16:41.890]  Here comes JJ.
[16:43.650 --> 16:44.690]  There's JJ.
[16:47.210 --> 16:47.890]  You got your back.
[16:52.000 --> 16:52.640]  OK.
[16:54.360 --> 16:54.760]  I mean.
[16:56.680 --> 16:57.480]  We can hear you.
[16:58.240 --> 17:01.680]  So how you want to talk about your history with cannabis?
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.480]  Can you hear me?
[17:11.520 --> 17:11.920]  We can.
[17:17.080 --> 17:22.120]  So, um, well, I guess, you know, if you want to start
[17:22.120 --> 17:28.840]  from the very beginning, I first smoked weed probably when I was about 30.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.520]  I was my neighbor.
[17:34.920 --> 17:36.920]  It was a Christmas day.
[17:37.080 --> 17:38.360]  It had snowed.
[17:39.880 --> 17:42.440]  Me, Mike, to shovel snow to make money.
[17:43.120 --> 17:47.120]  And before we went, he pulled out a joint.
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.560]  We smoked and shoveled snow and we couldn't fit up.
[17:51.720 --> 17:58.240]  And I just remember just feeling all loopy and just kind of selling for the first time.
[18:06.340 --> 18:06.900]  Can you hear me?
[18:07.500 --> 18:12.180]  And then I and then the Derns, you know, what?
[18:12.220 --> 18:18.900]  After that, I probably smoked, you know, one or two more times in like seventh, eighth grade.
[18:19.220 --> 18:24.620]  And I really didn't start on my regular cannabis use till I was in high school.
[18:25.020 --> 18:33.300]  When I got into high school, I started smoking every day and yeah, I mean, I just, I just
[18:33.300 --> 18:39.660]  started from there, you know, you know, and, you know, when you're, when you were smoking,
[18:40.260 --> 18:45.180]  you know, you, you would get weed and you would sell it, try to make a couple bucks,
[18:45.260 --> 18:47.060]  you know, to go and buy more weed.
[18:47.460 --> 18:53.660]  So, you know, you know, my first real experience was, you know, kind of buying weed to
[18:53.660 --> 19:00.500]  smoke and then selling weed to be able to make money to buy more weed to smoke.
[19:00.940 --> 19:05.700]  You know, and you get together with a few friends and you know, you know, you pull all
[19:05.700 --> 19:08.100]  your money to all your lunch money together.
[19:08.420 --> 19:12.940]  And, you know, I remember getting, you know, like $5 and we went out and bought a
[19:12.940 --> 19:18.980]  nickel bag and we smoked like three or four bowls, got all stoned.
[19:19.540 --> 19:26.260]  And then we were, we bumped into these older guys at this party and like, Hey, does anyone
[19:26.260 --> 19:27.860]  have any weed to sell?
[19:28.140 --> 19:31.460]  And we were like, yeah, we have, we pulled out the bag and the guy was like, Oh, I'll
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.300]  give you 15 bucks for it.
[19:33.340 --> 19:35.860]  And we were like, wow, that's fucking great.
[19:35.860 --> 19:39.260]  We got five bucks each, you know, and went back, bought more weed.
[19:39.700 --> 19:46.940]  So, you know, really my first experience was, you know, really kind of selling weed.
[19:46.940 --> 19:59.260]  And as I got older, you know, I started meeting other people that were more involved
[19:59.260 --> 20:06.900]  in the game. I worked my way into, into New York City and started buying weed there,
[20:06.900 --> 20:08.980]  bringing it back to New Jersey to sell.
[20:10.340 --> 20:15.380]  And, you know, I just, you know, just from the experience from going in and out of the
[20:15.420 --> 20:22.020]  city, I just really started, you know, I just really was really intrigued by the whole
[20:22.020 --> 20:23.900]  thing, the whole experience.
[20:24.940 --> 20:34.380]  And eventually I went up to Central Park and I started selling weed.
[20:34.420 --> 20:41.780]  And the first person I met out there, I just walked out there and there was some hippie
[20:41.860 --> 20:47.500]  with his girlfriend listening to the Grateful Dead on a little boom box.
[20:47.500 --> 20:49.340]  And I was like, oh, these guys must be cool.
[20:49.860 --> 20:55.140]  So I went there and I tried selling them weed and, you know, not, you know, I didn't know,
[20:55.140 --> 21:02.340]  but I was trying to sell weed to the biggest kind of dealer out in the park.
[21:02.340 --> 21:03.900]  And he kind of laughed at me.
[21:04.020 --> 21:05.820]  I was like, well, take a look at what I had.
[21:05.820 --> 21:08.580]  And I was like, oh, you know, I was like really impressed.
[21:09.540 --> 21:18.300]  You know, I started hanging around with him and one day some guy walked up and he was a
[21:18.300 --> 21:21.420]  grower and I didn't know many growers back then.
[21:21.420 --> 21:30.340]  So I was with my dealer friend and he's like, you know, this is my harvest.
[21:30.380 --> 21:33.060]  He had, I don't know, like two or four ounces.
[21:33.100 --> 21:38.220]  And so the one guy bought a couple ounces and didn't have enough for the rest of the
[21:38.220 --> 21:41.020]  weed. He turned to me and was like, you want to buy it?
[21:41.020 --> 21:42.660]  And I was like, yeah, sure.
[21:42.660 --> 21:44.860]  You know, so I scooped that up.
[21:45.700 --> 21:50.780]  And then a couple of weeks later, you know, I was in a park and my friend wasn't around.
[21:51.220 --> 21:57.300]  And then walking across the park was, you know, was the grower guy and this was the
[21:57.300 --> 22:03.020]  weasel. And then so I called him over and he's like, oh, where's Ben?
[22:03.260 --> 22:04.300]  And that was our buddy.
[22:04.300 --> 22:06.180]  And I was like, oh, he's not here today.
[22:06.620 --> 22:07.860]  I was like, what do you have?
[22:07.860 --> 22:09.860]  And he's like, you know, you open up his bag.
[22:10.220 --> 22:12.500]  And I was like, well, I'll take it all.
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.580]  I was like, I'll just cash you out.
[22:15.060 --> 22:18.740]  And, you know, our relationship kind of started from there.
[22:19.140 --> 22:28.300]  And, you know, the weasel, you know, he was out in Staten Island and he was the one that
[22:28.300 --> 22:33.020]  really, you know, he was the first one to inspire me.
[22:33.020 --> 22:41.220]  He was one of the you know, wasn't the first grower that I knew, but he, you know, he was
[22:41.220 --> 22:46.100]  the one that went and got the chem dog, you know, and the super skunk.
[22:46.220 --> 22:51.980]  And he brought that down to New York.
[22:52.700 --> 23:02.300]  But before that, he was selling this skunk one, two and three, and that was him and a
[23:02.300 --> 23:07.700]  friend went down to RFK and RFK Stadium to see the Grateful Dead.
[23:08.300 --> 23:12.020]  And they bought a bag and found some seeds in it.
[23:12.060 --> 23:14.060]  And, you know, some kind bud.
[23:14.060 --> 23:18.260]  And so they they they dubbed that the RFK.
[23:18.820 --> 23:26.180]  And that was what what the weasel was selling back then when I first met him was skunk one,
[23:26.180 --> 23:27.860]  skunk two, skunk three.
[23:27.860 --> 23:35.620]  But it wasn't it wasn't the the scentsy skunk or it was, you know, he just he just called it
[23:35.620 --> 23:37.900]  RFK one, two, three.
[23:38.780 --> 23:47.380]  And so that was the first ones that he had, and he had met Chemdog at a fish show, and
[23:47.380 --> 23:54.860]  then those guys traded clones and he brought the Chemdog down and started started breeding
[23:54.860 --> 24:02.340]  with it. And so, you know, initially I was just, you know, I just sold weed for these guys,
[24:02.340 --> 24:11.260]  you know. So I, you know, from, you know, from selling weed, I knew what sold and what
[24:11.260 --> 24:19.780]  didn't. So I was able to kind of tell those guys, steer them in the right direction of what
[24:19.780 --> 24:22.460]  what was going to what was going to work right.
[24:23.020 --> 24:31.020]  So, you know, so it kind of gave me a foresight, you know, on the quality of weed that that
[24:31.020 --> 24:34.220]  people liked and that I personally liked.
[24:34.700 --> 24:41.140]  And, you know, when I started growing, you know, I just I wanted to set the set those
[24:41.140 --> 24:49.900]  standards because I remember, you know, those guys who, you know, bring weed down to me and
[24:50.740 --> 24:52.980]  it would be, you know, a big hit.
[24:52.980 --> 24:55.980]  And then I'd be like, well, what happened to it?
[24:55.980 --> 24:57.540]  And you're like, well, we lost it.
[24:57.540 --> 25:02.860]  You know, something happened, whatever, whatever, you know, and I just be like, man, you
[25:02.860 --> 25:04.540]  know, it was lost forever.
[25:05.580 --> 25:13.140]  So, you know, when I started growing, you know, my my initial thing was just to try to
[25:14.820 --> 25:20.340]  try to preserve anything that, you know, any of these clone only strains that, you know,
[25:20.340 --> 25:22.260]  that we were able to get.
[25:23.020 --> 25:30.660]  And so, you know, I you know, we had the sour diesel and the chem dog and all these
[25:30.660 --> 25:33.100]  others, but we never had any any male.
[25:33.100 --> 25:38.780]  So when I when I first started growing and started breeding, it was this from my own
[25:39.220 --> 25:43.340]  personal self preservation.
[25:43.620 --> 25:47.500]  We had all these clones and didn't have no way to breed them, really.
[25:47.500 --> 25:51.980]  So, you know, I was always a big fan of sensei seeds.
[25:51.980 --> 25:56.980]  So I figured, well, you know, I'll start with sensei.
[25:57.660 --> 26:03.820]  And, you know, back then, you know, the chem dog was the best thing that we had.
[26:03.820 --> 26:07.540]  You know, back then we didn't know what it was.
[26:07.740 --> 26:11.500]  You know, it would be the pinnacle that it is.
[26:13.340 --> 26:16.020]  Because back then we saw a lot of great things.
[26:16.340 --> 26:20.780]  And so, you know, we just thought that, you know, it was just another thing that, you
[26:20.780 --> 26:26.220]  know, that we had, you know, we I was sure, you know, plenty of other people around the
[26:26.220 --> 26:30.180]  country had something that was just as good, if not maybe better.
[26:30.180 --> 26:32.500]  So, you know, we only worked with what we had.
[26:32.500 --> 26:36.820]  So, you know, I you know, my friend went to Amsterdam.
[26:36.900 --> 26:41.020]  You know, I arranged for him to get some seeds from sensei.
[26:41.340 --> 26:46.540]  And this was back when they had the the card packs with the cellophane.
[26:47.100 --> 26:57.940]  So these were the the the early to mid packs before they changed into the box packs.
[26:58.300 --> 27:01.500]  And before the fire, when the genetics were still good.
[27:01.980 --> 27:06.620]  Right. I was just going to say that was when the genetics were really still good.
[27:07.540 --> 27:14.700]  So, you know, I wound up getting, you know, the Afghan one and Hindu Kush and, you know,
[27:14.700 --> 27:23.020]  a few others, you know, and, you know, I wanted to cross it into the Khamdi and, you
[27:23.020 --> 27:28.260]  know, and just try to make the best male, the strongest male that I could.
[27:28.260 --> 27:37.060]  So, you know, after growing out the Hindu Kush and Afghan one, I decided that the
[27:37.060 --> 27:44.020]  Afghan one was, you know, the right choice because it had a really strong stem, you
[27:44.020 --> 27:45.460]  know, had that thick stem.
[27:45.500 --> 27:47.700]  It was really a single Kola plant.
[27:47.740 --> 27:53.540]  You know, the bud structure was was was really tight where the Hindu Kush really had a
[27:53.540 --> 27:57.900]  little bit more of a sativa tip to it.
[27:58.300 --> 28:06.380]  It was, you know, the buds were a little bit more fluffy and the stems weren't as strong.
[28:06.380 --> 28:09.540]  And so, you know, I decided to go with the Afghan one.
[28:10.220 --> 28:16.980]  And so I just cross that into the Khamdi and then, you know, back crossed it two times,
[28:16.980 --> 28:19.660]  you know, and created the trade dog.
[28:20.140 --> 28:26.020]  And that was, you know, the that was, you know, I figured that was going to be the pinnacle
[28:26.020 --> 28:30.140]  male. I was, you know, I was going to keep back crossing it.
[28:30.140 --> 28:37.180]  But, you know, then I decided, you know, at the time I had gotten the Khamdi four and
[28:37.180 --> 28:42.940]  that's when I crossed the trade dog into the Khamdi four and that, you know, created the
[28:42.940 --> 28:43.780]  star dog.
[28:45.620 --> 28:52.780]  You know, and when I first made that, you know, you know, I had sent some seeds back to
[28:52.780 --> 28:58.700]  Joe B. because he was the one that had made arrangements for me to get the Khamdi four.
[28:59.060 --> 29:04.740]  So I sent Joe the Khamdi, the star dog seeds, which I made with the Khamdi four.
[29:05.260 --> 29:10.260]  And he started spreading them around up in Humboldt.
[29:12.060 --> 29:15.460]  A few of the guys up there got it.
[29:15.860 --> 29:22.100]  And I had also gave my friends some seeds and they got in the Kyle Cushman's hands.
[29:22.780 --> 29:30.340]  And so it was really the people in California that blew up the star dog initially.
[29:31.140 --> 29:32.380]  I think Kyle won.
[29:34.300 --> 29:40.740]  I think he won. I don't know if it was first or second place in the San Francisco Medical
[29:40.740 --> 29:44.700]  Cup. And that might have been in 2010, I believe.
[29:44.780 --> 29:46.500]  I'm not sure.
[29:47.100 --> 29:56.940]  But, you know, and once that started, it really started to pick up steam and just really made
[29:56.940 --> 29:58.220]  a name for its own.
[29:58.220 --> 30:01.100]  It really wasn't what I did with it.
[30:01.100 --> 30:05.740]  It was what everyone else, what they did with it.
[30:07.660 --> 30:11.820]  Yeah, you really bred Gats at an early stage into a lot of stuff, I feel like.
[30:12.380 --> 30:15.420]  And there was several Finos of that star dog.
[30:15.820 --> 30:21.660]  We had like there was the Guava, star dog Guava was one of my favorites back back in the
[30:21.660 --> 30:23.860]  day. And then there's the Corey Haim and all the other ones.
[30:24.060 --> 30:27.900]  Were you the one that named those or were those ones named by people that had popped the
[30:27.900 --> 30:30.180]  seeds and found the Finos themselves?
[30:30.500 --> 30:36.020]  Well, I found the Corey Haim Fino and I gave that to AJ.
[30:36.540 --> 30:44.460]  And he happened to be cutting and harvesting it that the day that Corey Haim died.
[30:44.900 --> 30:49.060]  And so he was like, yo, this shit is fucking fire.
[30:49.460 --> 30:52.900]  So he was like, yeah, this is the shit that killed Corey Haim.
[30:53.300 --> 30:57.140]  So that's kind of how the Corey Haim got its name.
[30:57.620 --> 31:06.420]  And I had given my name, I mean, some seeds to a friend of mine and he had given them to
[31:06.420 --> 31:08.380]  Andre Grossman.
[31:09.020 --> 31:17.420]  And he was. He was a freelance photographer for High Times, and Andre had a small
[31:17.420 --> 31:21.700]  apartment up in the Bronx and he grew the Strawberry Cough.
[31:22.140 --> 31:25.460]  And the Strawberry Cough came from Kyle Cushman.
[31:25.820 --> 31:28.060]  And it was kind of like the.
[31:29.500 --> 31:36.660]  It was the High Times office strain, office strain, more or less like anyone that was in
[31:36.660 --> 31:42.220]  Goodwood, the High Times crew could pretty much go up to the office and arrange to get a
[31:42.220 --> 31:45.220]  cutting of the Strawberry Cough.
[31:45.220 --> 31:47.980]  And most of the times it came from Andre.
[31:48.540 --> 31:53.100]  So he had gotten those Storedog seeds and popped them.
[31:53.580 --> 31:58.980]  And he was the one that had found the Guava, the Guava Fino.
[31:59.700 --> 32:12.060]  Earlier, we had pop seeds and found a different Guava Fino that we had lost.
[32:12.700 --> 32:20.380]  But what had happened was the person that called named it the Guava wound up getting a
[32:20.380 --> 32:22.460]  cutting of the second Guava.
[32:22.780 --> 32:24.700]  And he was like, this is it.
[32:24.700 --> 32:25.540]  This is it.
[32:26.140 --> 32:34.380]  And so when I wound up getting it, you know, it was already dubbed the Guava by some other
[32:34.380 --> 32:44.460]  people. And then Andre also wound up getting some original New York City diesel seeds and
[32:44.460 --> 32:58.740]  he had he found the D9 and the D12, which the guys up in Seattle, Coltivar, Jason and
[32:58.740 --> 33:01.300]  those guys, you just had them on your last show.
[33:01.300 --> 33:03.100]  They run those Finos.
[33:03.620 --> 33:09.540]  Those Finos also came from Andre.
[33:10.700 --> 33:13.780]  Nice. Yeah, they do a good job with them up there.
[33:14.020 --> 33:14.780]  Real good job.
[33:15.780 --> 33:16.980]  Both of those choice.
[33:17.420 --> 33:22.940]  So so back in the day when we got the Chem 91 cut out of Oregon, we had the West Coast
[33:22.940 --> 33:25.700]  Dog, which was called the Dog, D-A-W-G.
[33:25.980 --> 33:29.620]  And then we had the Chem 91, but it wasn't called Chem 91 back then.
[33:29.860 --> 33:36.100]  It was called New York City Diesel and unmistakable Chem 91 with a different name.
[33:36.100 --> 33:38.060]  But there was also another New York City diesel.
[33:38.620 --> 33:42.180]  Yeah, Stonemans, Stonemans, New York City diesel that was completely different.
[33:43.180 --> 33:51.820]  All right. Well, we know when we had the Chem 91, when I first came down to the city, I
[33:51.820 --> 33:56.340]  was selling the bud and people would be like, oh, you know, what do you have?
[33:56.340 --> 33:59.180]  And I go, oh, yes, it's called Chem Dog.
[33:59.180 --> 34:05.900]  Or, you know, and back then, like, you know, people, you know, oh, what is it grown with
[34:05.900 --> 34:11.820]  chemicals or it smells like it's sprayed or treated or, you know, all these
[34:11.820 --> 34:15.780]  conspiracy theories started, you know, going around.
[34:15.900 --> 34:24.300]  So, you know, A.J., you know, he used to be like, yo, man, you got that diesel shit, that
[34:25.220 --> 34:26.980]  cock diesel, you know.
[34:26.980 --> 34:34.300]  And so it was really just it was really just a catchphrase, you know, diesel meaning
[34:34.300 --> 34:39.140]  strong, something super strong, you know, and you know, and that's and that was just a
[34:39.180 --> 34:41.940]  catchphrase back in New York City back in the day.
[34:42.460 --> 34:48.820]  But but it stuck because, you know, it was diesel and you could smell the fueliness to it.
[34:49.140 --> 34:54.740]  And so, yeah, you know, so that's where we started calling it the diesel.
[34:56.820 --> 35:01.700]  Yeah, that stuff was strong and good, good, heady smoke.
[35:02.700 --> 35:09.300]  So so you've worked with all the chem dog varieties, chem D, chem CIS, did you have the
[35:09.300 --> 35:11.780]  chem CIS as well and all those.
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.260]  Yeah. And what was your favorite?
[35:14.260 --> 35:16.820]  You prefer the you I mean, you work with the chem D.
[35:16.820 --> 35:22.220]  I feel like the chem D kind of has the strongest nose, but they're all they're all
[35:22.220 --> 35:31.260]  amazing. Yeah, I mean, probably I like chem D, 91, chem 4.
[35:31.900 --> 35:40.140]  Sister, the sister is kind of like the redheaded stepchild of the chems.
[35:40.500 --> 35:46.300]  You know, she doesn't really get much attention or credit, but, you know, she still has that
[35:46.300 --> 35:53.100]  garlicky, chemi smell very similar to the to the chem D.
[35:53.100 --> 35:56.540]  But, you know, a little bit more on the sativa tip.
[35:57.100 --> 36:05.940]  She doesn't have quite as strong as of a punch as the D does, but she's still
[36:05.940 --> 36:07.060]  respectable.
[36:08.060 --> 36:10.220]  You know, part of the gorilla glue.
[36:11.340 --> 36:14.620]  So, you know, the gorilla glue without it, right?
[36:14.940 --> 36:20.500]  Yeah. And then, you know, and the gorilla glue is kind of because.
[36:21.500 --> 36:28.500]  Sometimes you can, you know, come out really chocolatey or sometimes, you know, you get
[36:28.500 --> 36:32.820]  that the chem will really come through a little bit more so, you know, depending on the
[36:32.820 --> 36:38.420]  conditions and how it's grown in the nutrients and all that, I think, you know, you can get
[36:38.420 --> 36:39.860]  a little bit different every time.
[36:41.940 --> 36:46.740]  Yeah, it's that's the beauty of the plant to grow and grow with different food and
[36:46.740 --> 36:48.420]  different lights, different spectrum.
[36:48.420 --> 36:50.020]  You can have different expressions.
[36:50.900 --> 36:56.340]  And yeah, the chem 91, man, it's like just one of those unmistakable things that goes
[36:56.340 --> 37:00.100]  goes back to really the elite people.
[37:00.420 --> 37:03.540]  You had to be in the know to get it and very few people had it.
[37:05.780 --> 37:09.380]  So as far as your naming, you have top D.A.W.G.
[37:11.380 --> 37:13.380]  That was in tribute to the chem dog.
[37:13.460 --> 37:20.260]  Well, you know that and I didn't you know, I didn't I wanted to distinguish myself, you
[37:20.260 --> 37:30.820]  know, apart from chem dog, the person as he was doing.
[37:32.500 --> 37:41.700]  Cross, he was doing some with some of his own stuff, the snow or the snow dog.
[37:42.580 --> 37:50.580]  The snow dog, the candy cam there, you know, there are a few other ones that he came up
[37:50.580 --> 37:55.700]  with. So at that time, I just wanted to make sure that my brand was going to be different
[37:55.700 --> 37:56.580]  than his.
[37:56.580 --> 37:58.660]  Nice. Yeah.
[37:58.660 --> 38:02.900]  And just so every listening, the chem dog is spelled D.O.G.
[38:02.900 --> 38:05.380]  Top dog is spelled D.A.W.G.
[38:05.380 --> 38:08.980]  And the the strain chem dog has always been D.O.G.
[38:08.980 --> 38:10.740]  And there was a big confusion for a long time.
[38:10.740 --> 38:13.460]  And I think even Ketzer going around is the D.A.W.G.
[38:15.540 --> 38:19.140]  Yeah, and it's partially because it was so illegal back then.
[38:19.140 --> 38:21.940]  I think, you know, we didn't have a lot of stuff written down.
[38:21.940 --> 38:24.100]  We didn't want to take pictures of our grows.
[38:24.100 --> 38:27.060]  We this is before the Internet really kind of took off even.
[38:29.540 --> 38:33.380]  So and then you were on the you were on message boards back in the day, too, as well.
[38:33.380 --> 38:34.020]  Right, JJ?
[38:36.020 --> 38:37.620]  Yeah, I started on over.
[38:39.140 --> 38:39.640]  Yeah.
[38:42.740 --> 38:45.700]  So tell me a little bit about your breeding process.
[38:45.700 --> 38:50.820]  What's your approach to breeding and what are you kind of doing with varieties now?
[38:54.410 --> 38:58.410]  Well, you know, when you're going to breed, you know, you have to have a vision,
[38:58.410 --> 39:04.170]  you know, on, you know, what, you know, the outcome is going to be or hopes to be,
[39:04.170 --> 39:08.970]  you know, and, you know, I you know, when I was always mostly into, you know,
[39:09.050 --> 39:17.130]  you know, preservation, you know, getting elite cuts and trying to preserve them and trying to get
[39:17.130 --> 39:22.650]  some kind of representation of that original clone.
[39:24.010 --> 39:31.690]  So, you know, you know, so, you know, a lot of it starts with the male that you choose,
[39:31.690 --> 39:37.130]  you know, and a lot of this stuff that I did was, you know, chem related.
[39:37.930 --> 39:44.490]  Now the trade dog, you know, was, you know, pretty much the staple in the pinnacle, you know,
[39:44.490 --> 39:52.730]  of my line, you know, so when I bred that male, I kind of just, you know, threw it into everything
[39:52.730 --> 40:01.850]  that was kind of chem dog and, you know, and I also outcrossed it into other strains.
[40:02.330 --> 40:11.690]  But like, you know, in the in the in the sour diesel, you know, project, using the trade dog was,
[40:14.010 --> 40:20.090]  you know, you know, it was similar but different in a way because it grew, you know, it was it was
[40:20.090 --> 40:30.490]  gassy and chemy, but it also grew, it grew shorter. So when I did the initial cross and trade dog and
[40:31.450 --> 40:38.490]  the sour diesel, that was the sour dog. And, you know, most of those plants grew kind of short,
[40:38.490 --> 40:44.330]  you know, there were a couple stretchers out of the bunch, you know, so, you know,
[40:44.330 --> 40:49.290]  if I wanted to, you know, find something to get more representation, you know,
[40:49.930 --> 40:55.050]  you know, for the mom, you know, you know, then I back crossed it, you know, and, you know,
[40:55.050 --> 41:00.730]  then the selection of the male, you want to, you want to select the male that's going to be taller,
[41:00.730 --> 41:09.530]  is going to be, you know, more represent, you know, representing the sour diesel. And so,
[41:09.530 --> 41:17.530]  you know, then, you know, I back cross that, you know, and just keep continuing the process until,
[41:18.330 --> 41:23.690]  you know, you find, you know, you start getting a little bit more stable results.
[41:24.330 --> 41:30.410]  You know, right now we're finding two different type of phenos, the tall stretchy one,
[41:31.050 --> 41:41.370]  and a little bit shorter one, and they both smell like sour, but the stretchier one,
[41:41.370 --> 41:53.610]  the bud structure was more sourish, the bud, the calyxes kind of had those bumpy calyxes,
[41:53.930 --> 42:01.290]  on them that, you know, look just like the sour, where the shorter phenos were,
[42:02.410 --> 42:10.570]  the buds were a little bit more tighter, and, you know, and also there was a little bit more gassier
[42:10.570 --> 42:18.570]  where, you know, the other ones were more sour. So, you know, a lot of it goes, you know,
[42:18.570 --> 42:25.290]  starts with the male that you select, and then, you know, if you're not finding that you're,
[42:25.290 --> 42:32.570]  you know, getting a light plant, you just got to keep back crossing into what you're looking for,
[42:32.570 --> 42:40.570]  and once you find that, you can, you know, start working that. So, you know, I found, you know,
[42:40.570 --> 42:46.490]  on the back cross three, you know, like I was saying, we had two different phenos, so,
[42:47.290 --> 42:55.610]  you know, I've, you know, we inbred with that, the more sativa pheno, and we'll,
[42:55.610 --> 42:59.050]  you know, we'll see what, you know, starts coming out of that.
[43:01.530 --> 43:08.010]  Nice. So, yeah, let's talk about your sour BX. We'll get to Chuck in a minute. We've actually,
[43:08.010 --> 43:13.050]  you know, Chuck, what do you feel about, you want to talk about your history at all with the
[43:13.050 --> 43:17.610]  Chemdog and any of the gas? I know you got some history there for sure.
[43:18.890 --> 43:23.530]  I mean, honestly, bro, that was just some of my favorite strains smoking back in the day,
[43:23.530 --> 43:27.930]  you know what I mean? Like when you guys talk about going to fish shows, Grateful Dead shows,
[43:27.930 --> 43:32.410]  stuff like that, I mean, you had all kinds of different strains there, and
[43:32.970 --> 43:37.850]  chem was always one of the heavy hitters for sure, you know? I think chem's been used in so many.
[43:37.850 --> 43:41.130]  Yeah, well, and the big thing with Chemdog is when you're going into a dead show,
[43:41.690 --> 43:47.770]  you can smell who's smoking the Chemdog, you know, the varieties of stuff at dead shows were just
[43:47.770 --> 43:52.490]  crazy strong weed, you know, and then it's like, who the fuck's got that? Where did you get,
[43:52.490 --> 44:01.210]  use your nose to find it. Exactly. So, you went to a bunch of dead shows too, Chuck.
[44:04.770 --> 44:09.890]  No, man, I was a little too young for the dead, but definitely got to experience fish, you know?
[44:10.530 --> 44:16.690]  So, fish was one of my boys from Vegas actually brought me to my first fish show.
[44:17.250 --> 44:23.490]  So, we got to experience the parking lot for sure. Yeah, parking lot was half the battle.
[44:23.490 --> 44:26.690]  Then you got to make it in if you're not too fucked up. Parking lot,
[44:29.570 --> 44:34.450]  shakedown street, shakedown street. So, tell us more about the Lemon Thunk, Chuck.
[44:35.250 --> 44:42.170]  Yeah, I mean, you know, honestly, bro, it got brought over to Amsterdam and probably around
[44:42.170 --> 44:49.050]  2000, I'd say five. You know, it was caught up with a lot of other genetics over there.
[44:49.050 --> 44:52.890]  I mean, there was a lot of good shit that was floating around and coming in and out.
[44:52.890 --> 44:57.850]  And I would say, I guess it was 2007 is when it won its first cup at the High Life.
[44:58.410 --> 45:03.050]  So, like I said earlier, it was originally grown in Vegas and, you know, that's where the family
[45:03.050 --> 45:09.130]  and the crew had it out here forever. You know, it was like I say, it was just such a unique
[45:09.130 --> 45:14.170]  flavor and, you know, it stunk, man. A lot of people didn't want to grow it because it just
[45:14.170 --> 45:19.210]  blew the block up. I mean, it really was loud. I mean, you'd go in the house and get out of the
[45:19.210 --> 45:24.490]  car and, you know, the neighbors could smell it for sure. So, you know, and I was over in
[45:24.490 --> 45:29.290]  Amsterdam at the time with all these different genetics and I was sitting there trimming with
[45:29.290 --> 45:34.810]  DNA one day and a couple of mutual friends of ours, a guy named Bear, and I looked over at Bear
[45:34.810 --> 45:40.010]  and I said, hey, man, I got something that compete with all this shit. And he goes, well, prove it.
[45:40.010 --> 45:45.770]  So, you know, we got it over in 2005 and I guess it took a couple of years to kind of get integrated.
[45:45.770 --> 45:50.890]  But then it won the High Life Cup in 2007 and got first place. How's Bear doing, by the way?
[45:54.580 --> 45:58.980]  Bear's good, man. Bear's good. I haven't got to talk to him in a while with this whole COVID
[45:59.060 --> 46:05.460]  shit going on, but he's doing good from what I hear, man. You know, so good, good guy. One of
[46:05.460 --> 46:11.220]  my biggest mentors, you know, along with Richard from Sheldon Black, you know, I'd say those are
[46:11.220 --> 46:18.980]  two of my biggest mentors over there. I guess I got to call out Steve, Deno's, Mr. Melegrano.
[46:22.180 --> 46:27.700]  I love it. I love it. He's awesome. I want to bring him on, hopefully very soon.
[46:29.220 --> 46:35.700]  Oh, I'm sure he would love to, man. I mean, listen, Richard was the guy that had graphics
[46:35.700 --> 46:41.140]  pipes back in the day. You know what I mean? So it's funny to think when I met him,
[46:41.140 --> 46:46.740]  he was working with Roar. So, you know, Roar, he was, you know, all over, man. Roar was probably
[46:46.740 --> 46:53.300]  one of my first nice pieces I ever hit. So, yeah, man. Good, good dude. Good, solid guy, bro. Like
[46:53.300 --> 46:59.620]  I say, one of my biggest mentors in this whole thing. Nice. So, but anyhow, getting back on with
[46:59.620 --> 47:04.820]  the lemons. So, yeah, 2007, it won its first cup and, you know, it just started blowing up, man.
[47:04.820 --> 47:08.820]  I mean, you know, once things start winning cups, of course, it attracts a lot of attention.
[47:10.260 --> 47:15.380]  You know, that was, you know, I guess back in the day between high times and the internet. And of
[47:15.380 --> 47:19.780]  course, you know, you had a lot of Canadian magazines too, but I mean, there wasn't a lot
[47:19.780 --> 47:24.420]  of marketing like there is now, you know? I mean, it was, as we know, pretty underground culture.
[47:25.060 --> 47:29.860]  So it was almost better without the marketing, to be 100% honest, the weed spoke for itself.
[47:29.860 --> 47:35.220]  Exactly. I agree with you 100%. I agree with you 100%. The weed speaks for itself, you know?
[47:36.020 --> 47:41.380]  We all know good weed and, you know, I guess getting to see different weed from, you know,
[47:41.380 --> 47:45.220]  all over and especially hitting Amsterdam, you got to actually go in the coffee shops and,
[47:45.940 --> 47:50.420]  you know, try out and see the real stuff. Not that all of it was real, but I guess if you knew
[47:50.420 --> 47:54.580]  your shit, you knew it was fake and what was not, you know? If you knew the right person to go to,
[47:54.580 --> 47:58.420]  you could find good stuff anywhere, you know? Amsterdam was no exception. There was really
[47:58.420 --> 48:02.420]  good stuff if you knew the right people, especially hash wise, but like going to see Soma.
[48:03.140 --> 48:08.500]  We're all friends with Soma. Yeah, Soma from Soma's Sacred Seeds. Go into his house in Amsterdam,
[48:08.500 --> 48:11.780]  you could always get good stuff. And if you brought some with you, you could trade it.
[48:12.420 --> 48:17.380]  Yeah, yeah. That was never a problem, was it? Sit around the table and figure it out, you know?
[48:17.380 --> 48:24.820]  So, yeah. What a good dude too, man. I mean, I was blessed to be able to be around, I guess,
[48:24.820 --> 48:30.980]  all the top of the top at the beginning, you know? Yeah, I mean, it was such a small subculture.
[48:31.940 --> 48:37.620]  100%. 100%. And as we know, you know, it takes time to network in like everywhere. So,
[48:38.340 --> 48:44.260]  you know, Amsterdam's not a very inviting place, but, you know, I guess, honestly,
[48:44.260 --> 48:48.660]  man, if it wasn't for Bear, I probably never would have got plugged in the way I did.
[48:50.020 --> 48:58.980]  Hey Chuck, the Lemon Skunk, that hasn't really been, that cut hasn't been released outside your
[48:58.980 --> 49:05.380]  family other than Amsterdam, is that correct? Yeah, that's correct. That's correct. I mean,
[49:06.180 --> 49:10.980]  you know, when it got out to Amsterdam, it started getting spread around quite a lot. I mean,
[49:10.980 --> 49:14.900]  it was definitely a big commercial crop and people loved it because it was a dumper.
[49:15.860 --> 49:20.820]  But I think a lot of people ran through so many genetics. I know a lot of people lost it. I mean,
[49:20.820 --> 49:26.900]  I'm sure there's a few people that might have it, but as far as the original goes, I've never seen
[49:26.900 --> 49:30.740]  it before. There's people that claim to have it, but they've never shown me any weed.
[49:30.820 --> 49:34.660]  Right. And I know that there's someone in Denver that claims to have
[49:35.300 --> 49:44.100]  the Lemon Man Skunk and one of his crosses. And yeah, I don't think that's true.
[49:45.380 --> 49:51.700]  Yeah. I mean, this is a hard one. I mean, like I said, I kept it preserved here and it was up in
[49:51.700 --> 49:59.620]  Santa Barbara for a while. And now it's actually down in LA. So yeah, between the family, there's
[49:59.620 --> 50:03.620]  between the family, there's not much left. I mean, there's not many people that it could be
[50:03.620 --> 50:15.780]  in the hands of. Yeah. So really, the only breeders that really got that was Greenhouse and DNA,
[50:15.780 --> 50:23.060]  correct? Correct. Yeah. DNA got it first and then Greenhouse got it second. So yeah, that was a
[50:23.300 --> 50:33.300]  DNA did a Lemon Skunk, but the Greenhouse did the Lemon, did the Haze. So there was a Haze version
[50:33.300 --> 50:40.020]  and a Skunk version. Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly how it was. They did. That's when the Super Lemon
[50:40.020 --> 50:48.260]  Haze came on the scene. So yeah, that was, that was, it definitely started, you know, being used
[50:48.260 --> 50:54.740]  for a lot of breeding projects for sure. So that was the basis for the Super Lemon Haze and the
[50:54.740 --> 51:03.140]  Amnesia, I take it? Not Amnesia. So Super Lemon was just the Lemon Skunk and the Super Silver Haze.
[51:04.900 --> 51:09.380]  The Amnesia Haze, Amnesia was always kind of similar to like Super Silver Haze, but they
[51:09.380 --> 51:13.780]  were definitely different. Oh, I thought they were sisters. Yeah. That's what I was going to say. I
[51:13.780 --> 51:19.300]  mean, they, that was what I heard they were. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it was when I just
[51:19.300 --> 51:23.300]  think of seeing them side by side, definitely, you know, a little bit of a difference. It's kind of
[51:23.300 --> 51:27.940]  like all the other, they grow differently for sure, but I definitely feel I've grown them side by side
[51:27.940 --> 51:33.300]  because they finished in almost the same amount of time and they definitely have similar structure,
[51:33.860 --> 51:37.940]  but they do definitely have distinct features. So I would say there's a good chance they're
[51:37.940 --> 51:43.220]  sisters. Yeah, for sure. For sure. No, they were, those are two popular strains over in Amsterdam,
[51:43.220 --> 51:49.140]  for sure. You know? So JJ, do you, have you grown a lot of Haze too?
[51:50.980 --> 51:59.700]  Yeah, I'm actually doing some Haze project and I see that someone asked the question,
[51:59.700 --> 52:07.940]  is it possible that I could speak about the PIF S1? And the PIF S1 was given to me as a cutting
[52:08.580 --> 52:18.420]  from what I understand, it was a seed that was found in a bag of PIF that was grown in Massachusetts
[52:19.380 --> 52:25.700]  and yeah, my,
[52:30.660 --> 52:36.820]  I don't know, the PIF S1 kind of fell short of the original, just in, I mean,
[52:36.900 --> 52:42.420]  it smelled just like it and everything, but when you smoked it, it, you know, it just didn't have
[52:42.420 --> 52:48.260]  that psychedelic trippiness to it, you know, cause I think it might've had a little bit more indigant
[52:48.260 --> 52:56.740]  in it. So, but it definitely was PIF. So, you know, I took that and started, I crossed it into
[52:56.740 --> 53:05.860]  a bunch of different things. Right now I'm, I did a, I'm doing a, the black Haze and that was
[53:05.860 --> 53:16.020]  crossed into the Mango, the Mango Nigerian. And so a lot of this is really focusing on the A Haze,
[53:16.660 --> 53:26.740]  the more pissy, PIF-y one, if you want to call it that. And the thing about the A is, you know,
[53:27.220 --> 53:38.180]  you only have the, you know, you have the A5 from Amsterdam. And when I met Chuck back in
[53:39.140 --> 53:47.700]  2012, I had met Karma and we were all, we would, we all went to Barney's for breakfast and we were
[53:47.700 --> 53:55.220]  sitting down and Karma had mentioned to me that he knew someone that had the A5 and I was like,
[53:55.300 --> 54:01.460]  really? I was like, yo bro, you got to get that cutting and work with it, you know? And so,
[54:02.500 --> 54:08.660]  you know, he, he listened to me and he wound up getting it and doing some work, doing the work
[54:08.660 --> 54:15.860]  that he's doing with it, with it now. And you know, so I knew that that was the same, the same,
[54:15.860 --> 54:23.620]  you know, similar to the, to the, the New York City PIF. And, and I think from what I understand,
[54:23.620 --> 54:30.020]  the A5 was never commercially released. I think, you know, a handful of people had it, right?
[54:30.020 --> 54:36.100]  A handful of people had it. That was it. I mean, it might've been one of those deals where
[54:36.100 --> 54:43.540]  maybe Steve got this, you know, had gotten like a rare, you know, a crop, you know, whatever it was,
[54:44.180 --> 54:51.060]  a rare release. And, you know, so there was people that, you know, obviously had it in Amsterdam
[54:51.620 --> 54:59.220]  and then obviously it made its way to Florida somehow. And so, you know, those two strains are,
[54:59.220 --> 55:05.300]  you know, unmistakably the same, you know, A5 haze if you, you know, if you know your hazes.
[55:06.020 --> 55:09.620]  Oh yeah. And it's, so just, just to let the people that are watching
[55:09.620 --> 55:15.780]  know a little bit more about the A5, it's a, it's one of Neville's A5s. So, and the A5 was,
[55:15.780 --> 55:21.940]  it's one of Neville's hazes. The A5 was a real, it had ammonia. I mean, it had strong ammonia and
[55:21.940 --> 55:28.180]  it was super strong, heady, racy sativa weed that would definitely make your heart, you'd have the
[55:28.180 --> 55:34.100]  heart palpitations. But, but one of those unmistakable, like almost foul, if you weren't
[55:34.100 --> 55:37.700]  a connoisseur, you wouldn't want to smoke it. It was one of those things, like if you don't
[55:37.700 --> 55:44.500]  like ammonia and that pungent terpenelline limonene with that, that strong ammonia,
[55:44.500 --> 55:48.500]  cat pissy kind of ammonia, you know, it was something very special.
[55:51.140 --> 55:56.740]  Yeah. So, you know, you know, and everyone pretty much, you know, sees a lot of the C haze, you know,
[55:56.740 --> 56:04.740]  which, you know, which is more of that Thai floral haze and, you know, which is, you know,
[56:05.460 --> 56:12.100]  it's nice, you know, but it just doesn't have that same, you know, pissiness, you know, and then,
[56:12.100 --> 56:17.060]  and then you have the Neville's haze, which is a cross of the two. And, you know, when you can
[56:17.060 --> 56:24.740]  get different phenos of Neville's haze, which will be a little bit more A leaning and some that are a
[56:24.740 --> 56:30.580]  little bit more C leaning. So, you know, and some that you get a little bit of both in the mix.
[56:33.140 --> 56:41.300]  Yeah. You know, definitely, you know, something that's made its mark and it's something that,
[56:41.300 --> 56:46.900]  you know, it's not, you know, widely available. And those are the kinds of things that I like to
[56:46.900 --> 56:52.260]  work with, you know, and, you know, a lot of that, you know, came out in some of the mango work,
[56:52.260 --> 56:58.420]  you know, that Mr. Nice did and stuff, but it just didn't have the, you know,
[56:59.140 --> 57:03.860]  just didn't have the trippiness to it, you know, and I, and I guess that just goes back to,
[57:04.580 --> 57:11.780]  I don't know if it's the NL5 or the, this something that's more haziness to it, but,
[57:11.780 --> 57:18.660]  you know, if you smoke that, that New York, that New York piff, you know, some people swear that
[57:18.660 --> 57:27.220]  it's, that it's treated, it has been sprayed or it's treated or. Yeah. And when you're real high
[57:27.220 --> 57:31.220]  like that, it's easy to believe somebody telling you that it's been sprayed or treated because it
[57:31.220 --> 57:35.460]  gets you so frigging high, you know, and that's another, it's like one of those, one of those
[57:35.460 --> 57:40.420]  varieties that just doesn't have a ceiling. It's like you smoke it and you can keep getting more
[57:40.420 --> 57:45.220]  high. A lot of the stuff today has a ceiling. So no matter how much do you smoke, if you're smoking
[57:45.220 --> 57:51.300]  joints, you don't really get that much higher. Some of those, you know, old school haze varieties,
[57:51.300 --> 57:56.100]  there's no ceiling. You keep getting more high and more high. And some people get more paranoid
[57:56.100 --> 58:01.060]  and more paranoid. It's just depending on how you, how you take it, you know, and someone's
[58:01.060 --> 58:07.620]  talking about LSD. I feel like some of those almost give you a full on psychedelic LSD high.
[58:09.540 --> 58:12.100]  You know, that's the beauty of some of them, but they're not forever.
[58:12.900 --> 58:18.020]  A lot of it has to do with your tolerance too, because, you know, if you're someone that don't
[58:18.020 --> 58:25.060]  smoke Sativas on a regular basis, or if you're not a regular smoker at all, and you smoke some
[58:25.140 --> 58:31.620]  Sativas, you might have a bad experience. But once you get seasoned a little bit, you know,
[58:31.620 --> 58:37.620]  that kind of calms down after a while. But, you know, I call it, you know, kind of like when you
[58:37.620 --> 58:45.620]  overdose and that's what happens when you smoke too much weed and your body, you know, you kind
[58:45.620 --> 58:52.260]  of go into overdose and you kind of get that anxiety and you start freaking out. And, you know,
[58:52.260 --> 59:00.100]  the same thing happens when you eat too much edibles. Yeah. Yeah, I like edibles sometimes.
[59:00.100 --> 59:04.500]  I've really got into the Delta eight lately. Have you guys tried Delta eight?
[59:05.700 --> 59:11.220]  No, I'm just hearing about it now. I'm not an edibles person. They just, you know, an edible,
[59:12.100 --> 59:16.500]  you know, that's more of a commitment, you know, is it, you know, it's gonna, you know,
[59:16.500 --> 59:23.460]  you'd be high for six, eight hours, depending on your tolerance to, you know what I mean?
[59:25.140 --> 59:30.820]  It could be a bad experience. Yeah. Some people, you know, I have friends that eat 500 milligrams,
[59:30.820 --> 59:35.460]  it doesn't affect them. And me, I'm like Delta nine, if I eat like 10 milligrams of Delta nine,
[59:35.460 --> 59:41.460]  I'm good. And I've always been more of a smoker, a joint smoker, preferably I do dabs too. And
[59:41.460 --> 59:45.940]  I do, you know, all kinds of other stuff. But for the most part, when it comes to smoking,
[59:45.940 --> 59:50.340]  I like flour, but this Delta eight is as close as you can get to smoking flour. You can take a
[59:50.340 --> 59:55.460]  bunch of it and it gets you really relaxed. I could sleep on it. I've been taking it for
[59:55.460 --> 01:00:04.760]  medical benefit. I just, I feel like Delta eight's a great molecule. So let's talk a little bit about
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:12.600]  the sour JJ and your sour BX. So I did a sour BX three with my partners back in the day, we released
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:18.440]  the seven, a sour because you crossed it back. And the problem is I feel like we started from
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:24.360]  the wrong point. We had a spicy Jack sour diesel that we used and the spicy Jack really imparted
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.560]  the tropenoline limonene, which I don't like. And I feel like you started from a much better place
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.920]  and just even looking at the photos and seeing the stuff you've done online, I haven't seen any
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.480]  of the flour in person, but I feel like you are definitely on the right track with creating a
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:46.200]  sour diesel seed where you get something absolutely relative or not representative of the sour diesel.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.320]  Yeah. Well, you know, that just, you know, like I said, going back to the original cross,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:57.400]  you know, using the trade dog, you know, and then, you know, just trying to stick with, you know,
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:04.040]  the stuff that was more sour dominant in growth, you know, and it's really trying to get that,
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:12.840]  get that sativa, you know, to try to get that, you know, to try to lock that in. And, you know,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.680]  and, you know, and going back, you know, you know, two or three times with the sour has its,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.760]  you know, good points and it's bad points, you know, cause now you're starting to bottleneck
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:31.480]  those genetics and, you know, and as everyone knows, the sour is prone to hermaphrodite,
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:39.320]  you know, it's known to throw late, late manners that are usually non-sterile, you know, but it's
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:45.640]  in the gene pool, you know, so, you know, we've been finding, you know, you know, some, you know,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.960]  we have gotten a few reports of some manners and found some, you know, and that's, you know,
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.320]  with that line, I just feel that it's just, you know, part of the territory, you know,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:04.920]  you know, just as long as you're not getting well in just, you know, kind of just touching on that
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:13.320]  subject, you know, you know, if you, if your whole room manners, then it's not the genetics
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:19.880]  because to be able to get, you know, you know, you get a pack of 10, you know, and you get, you know,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:27.160]  seven, seven male or seven females and three males and, you know, and if everything goes awry,
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:34.600]  then that tells, tells you something in your room has gone awry, you know, usually I find
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:41.560]  if it's in the, in the genetics, you know, you're going to find one or two consistently
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:50.440]  popping out with other females that don't harm on you. So, you know, a lot of people, you know,
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.160]  I get messages, you know, saying, oh, your genetics suck, my, you know, all your seeds
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:02.760]  harmed and this and that, but, you know, it's not in the genetics because, you know, if you think
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.360]  about it, the odds of that happening, you know, and that would mean that that would happen across
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.400]  the board, you know, every person that got a seed, you know, there would be a really high
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:20.040]  hermaphroditic rate to it and, you know, most of the time that doesn't, you know, that's not the
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.680]  case, you know, because, you know, we, you know, I grow out the seeds most of the time myself first,
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:33.320]  you know, just to test them. So, there's a big misconception, I think, on a lot of people's part
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:40.520]  on popping seeds and getting hermaphrodites. Right. Yeah, that's a tricky one because,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.320]  you know, I mean, I think those intersexual traits can be bred in and out, but if people have
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.800]  unstable environments, you know, things that cause high stress, whether it's overfeeding,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.680]  or underfeeding, there's so many, you know, there's so many factors that can cause stress
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:07.720]  that can be problematic. I, you know, it just, it really depends. I do some stress testing on my
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:13.640]  seeds in my varieties to see when I'm breeding it, you know, larger populations for selection,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.600]  but it looks like, oh, we lost you for a second, now you're back.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.080]  Looks like your screen froze up. So, with those, are those sour BXs, are those regular or feminized?
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:34.440]  Regular. I pretty much, all my work is regular. I don't really do, I've never done a feminized line,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.120]  I've never done an auto line, and, you know, just getting back, you know, for me, it was always about
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:47.080]  self-preservation, really about furthering the genetics to the next level, you know, you know,
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:54.680]  you know, you can, you know, with the, you know, there's, with the feminized seeds, you know,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.320]  they have a purpose, but I think in the long run, you know, in my opinion,
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.440]  I'd rather just go with national, natural selection.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:15.400]  Nice. So, someone was saying something about a bag, bag seeds being bad, and, you know,
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.520]  they used to be good. What's your opinion on bag seeds? I'm a, I'm a big fan. I feel like bag,
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.960]  we wouldn't be here talking today if it wasn't for a bag seed, you know, the chem dog bag seed,
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.120]  you know, I feel like that's kind of something that really pushed with, you know, talk about
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.320]  the butterfly effect, we'd probably be in a different place doing different things.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.680]  And there's a lot of strains, I would say most of the strains that are popular, the most of the
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.400]  genetics that are popular are from bag seed, even, even still, and some people have claimed they bred
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.880]  them and haven't bred them, but a lot of the stuff, bag seeds are important, and you can find
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:55.160]  good stuff in bag seeds. Yeah, well, you know, you know, if you get a good, a good bag of weed,
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:03.240]  and you find a seed in it, you know, that's a, that's a good thing, usually. So, you know,
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:10.600]  a lot of, you know, a lot of our best strains are, have been, you know, have been done by accident.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:17.160]  So, you know, back in the day, you know, we didn't really have much, we didn't have the
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:24.360]  choices that we have today, you know. So, you know, back then, you know, you'd get a, you know,
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.480]  a bag of kind budded, you know, you didn't even know what strain it was, or what name it was,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:35.080]  you're, you know, the guy was just selling kind bud, you know, and you bought a bag and found
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.920]  four seeds in it, you know. So, you know, you didn't know, you know, what you had to begin with,
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.840]  where, where today, you know, you can be a little bit more selective, you know, you,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:55.560]  you know, the strains that you're gonna have, you know, but there's always a needle in the haystack
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.880]  everywhere, anywhere, you know. So, I mean, the next best thing is, is from a seed, you know,
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.520]  you know, that's what, that's where the next best thing is going to come from, obviously,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:15.640]  is from the seed. So, you know, so that's why I encourage people to make seeds and also to,
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:23.480]  to germinate seeds, because that's where we're finding our, our, our next best things from.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.920]  You know, if we just, if we just keep, you know, passing the same, the same clones around,
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.280]  you know, you know, look what happened to Amsterdam.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.120]  Genetic depression, totally.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:43.800]  Everything turned into haze over there, you know, I mean, I think, and we started happening with
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.680]  cookies and OG here, and now we got gelato everything, and so we're kind of in the same
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:54.120]  place with, we're heading towards genetic depression here, you know, I see it happening
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:59.640]  on the West Coast, at least. Well, you know, there's certain people, you know, not with my
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:05.880]  genetics anyway. For sure. Everyone's got their own niche, you know, I mean, and a lot of people
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:13.720]  just ride that hype train and, you know, it works for them. So everyone's got to figure out what
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:19.720]  works for them. And, you know, like I said, I like to be creative, you know, you know, I like to fall
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:28.040]  back on some of the old stuff and create new stuff. And, you know, the building blocks of,
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:34.120]  you know, or yes, of yesterday, or the building blocks of today, you know, there's a lot of
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:42.520]  a lot of stuff out there, you know, old seed bank stuff. And, you know, there's people sitting on
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:48.760]  genetics still, you know, there's gems out there, if you, you know, you just got to look for them.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:56.360]  And, you know, you just got to have a mindset of thinking outside the box, and trying to create,
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:04.520]  you know, and now with all these land races that are available, the Afghan select guys,
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:12.040]  and, you know, the Indian exchange guys. And so, you know, you're getting now the world is opening
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:19.560]  up now to where you don't have to travel to a lot of these countries to get the seeds from
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:26.760]  Afghanistan, or India, you know, you can just order them online, as a matter of popping the
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.960]  seeds, and trying to find something that's unique and different. And trying to, you know, try but
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.240]  people, the thing is, people don't want to do that work. There's a lot of work, you agreed,
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.400]  you know, you they just want to get, you know, just want to get a cookie or a gelato cut,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.400]  and get some, you know, get a mail, get, you know, a pack of seeds from,
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:57.560]  you know, exotic or archive or whoever, and this, you know, start, you know, chucking away.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.840]  Yeah, so I want to touch on something you said earlier, about people breeding with your
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.600]  seeds. And I've always been a fan of people breeding with my gear. And, you know, I feel
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.680]  like you got to give the breeders credit that you use to create stuff. But there's some people that
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.920]  are hating on people using their stuff for breeding. And it's like, the second it's sold,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:23.240]  the second you sell somebody seeds, it becomes public domain, or given seeds or whatever. So
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.960]  I feel like, you know, seeds are meant to be bred with these varieties are meant to be bred with,
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.640]  if you have a cut, you should breed with it. I think there's nothing wrong with it. And,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.480]  you know, obviously, giving people credit for their work that you're working with and trying
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.360]  to be honest and transparent. That's important. But you have no problem with people buying your
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:49.080]  seeds and breeding with them? No, but I do have, you know, breeding and copying people's work are
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:55.320]  different. You know, if you want to take a pack of my seeds and out cross it into whatever strain
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:02.040]  you want, I have no problem with that. But when people take a star dog, just take a pack of star
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:10.680]  dog and then, you know, they have to them. And then and then they try to go in and sell, sell
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:18.520]  them and undercut our prices, then, you know, that's not cool. You know, you know, I used to be,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.680]  a lot a lot, you know, I'm trying to just, you know, let it go now, because it's, you know,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:34.760]  there's so many people out there, you can't go chasing down everyone, you know, you know, it's
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.880]  not a good look after a while. So, you know, it is what it is, you know, everything is just, you know,
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:50.920]  there's no, there's no more ethics or respect really in in, in anyone can just, you know,
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:58.920]  pull up on IG and become a breeder. So it is what it is now. You just got to accept it.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.400]  Yeah, Chuck showing off your junk. How you doing there, buddy?
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.080]  Oh, I didn't know if I lost you guys.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.320]  No, how are you doing?
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.680]  I'm doing good, man. I'm doing good. Like I say, spending the holidays here in Vegas,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.840]  heading back to Denver here in a couple days. So that's about it, man, trying to get through
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.320]  the COVID year. It's been a crazy year for all of us. But I'm stoked, man. You know,
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:36.520]  JJ is a good friend of mine. You know, it's we got a good relationship going on. Verde Natural,
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.120]  you know, that's my place back in Denver. And, you know, we're gonna do some fun feno hunting.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.760]  So it's gonna be some really good projects ahead.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.480]  Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you. You guys are working together on some
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.240]  feno hunting and some projects.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.440]  Yeah, man, JJ is coming in and, you know, the whole crew is really stoked and,
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:01.080]  you know, utmost respect and, you know, it's really gonna be fun, man. It's probably gonna
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.400]  be something that, you know, a lot of people aren't doing right now, right? Most people are
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.760]  just growing for production, especially in the dispensary world. So to actually do some real
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.640]  feno hunting and, you know, have the space to do it, it's really gonna be a cool project. It's
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.040]  gonna take some time, of course. But once the ball gets rolling, it's gonna be fun.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:28.280]  Yeah, for me, it's a unique, you know, opportunity because, you know, how many people,
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:35.720]  you know, get access to be able to feno hunt, you know, a few hundred plants in one stream.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:45.080]  You know, me and Chuck, you know, met back in, you know, Amsterdam back in 2012.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:52.280]  You know, so we've had, you know, a good personal relationship, you know, since then.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.440]  And, you know, when this opportunity, you know, we always talked about, you know,
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:02.040]  working together, but, you know, sometimes, you know, you just, you know, for whatever reason,
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.080]  the intentions are there, but, you know, you just can't put it together for whatever reason,
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:16.120]  you know. And, you know, these guys now, you know, down at Verde, you know, they got like a bunch of
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:23.000]  indoor grow that they're doing, and then they have, you know, this connected greenhouse space,
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:30.440]  you know, that they're gonna be able to do a bunch of research and development.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:42.680]  And Julian of Dabologic, you know, he's someone that has a lot of passion and is into, you know,
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:49.320]  looking for the best, you know, hash producing strains. You know, these guys have, you know,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:56.040]  mountains of data, and, you know, and they're really trying to, you know, pin down, you know,
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:03.000]  genetically, you know, the combinations and, you know, different things that, you know,
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:13.880]  make more hash production. So, it's, you know, to be able to get into something that, you know,
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:24.600]  where you can actually collect data, have data to, you know, look back on and start to see a pattern
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.440]  into what works, you know. Most of us have just been in, you know, maybe, you know, 10 or 20 light
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:41.320]  room, and, you know, maybe, you know, 100, you know, no one's really had, gets the opportunity
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:47.480]  to go through that many plants and collect that data over a long period of time is really,
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:53.880]  really the bottom line. So, that's really one of the things I'm really excited about it.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:03.560]  So, yeah. So, we got a question, Chuck, from one of the viewers about your soil program over
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:13.960]  at Verde Natural. Doing living soil down there. So, we reamend our soil. You know, it's Cassandra
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:21.080]  Maffie was the one that brought that in. That was basically her formulas. She was up in Humboldt
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:27.160]  growing for a long time. Really, really cool girl. So, we've kind of just ran with that program
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:33.080]  since we got the new facility. It's, you know, to me, you know, everybody can grow in a million
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.720]  different ways, but at the end of the day, I think soil is nice because the plant gets to take what
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.560]  it wants at its times. It's not like mainlining, you know. I think a lot of people, you know,
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.920]  they want to go for yield, but then they use all these steroid products and synthetic garbage,
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.040]  and you know, you get what you put into it at the end of the day.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.280]  Optimal plant health.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.200]  Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, it's, I think, like I said, a lot of people these days,
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.320]  it's just commercial and, you know, how quick can they do it? And, you know, what's the biggest
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.680]  yield? And, you know, it's all about numbers and not quality driven.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.200]  No, and I think all this boils down to intention at the end of the day. What is your intention? If
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.640]  your intention is to make a ton of money, you know, pushing yield, you want to push, you want
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:27.320]  to get five pounds per thousand watt under a four by four, you know, then maybe using your rock wool
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:33.800]  with micro dosing your food, that's, you know, when you're talking about those things, maybe
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.600]  that's your thing. But if you want to grow good quality medicine that you would smoke yourself,
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.160]  maybe you would grow living soil. You know, it's just really about intention. And I feel like
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.840]  that goes across the board with all the things that we do. What are the intention?
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.200]  And what is the intention of the outcome? What are we trying to get out of it?
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.800]  Exactly. And I think, I think that, you know, like I say, a lot of people these days,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.200]  they like the automated systems. I mean, it's work, you know what I mean? It's a lot of work.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.080]  It's definitely more labor intensive, I guess, would be the key term. So, you know, it's like
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.960]  you say, how do you want to do it? And, you know, for me, it's, I want everybody to smoke what I
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.040]  would smoke. Right. Well, and with with living soil, especially for pheno hunting, I guess,
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.760]  you want to pheno hunt in a type of environment that you're going to be producing your flower in.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:28.280]  So I think the beauty of living soil is also for the expression. So you get the best expression of
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.920]  the plant, in my opinion, everyone has their own opinion. But I feel like the expression of the
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.760]  plant, you're going to get a better expression in living soil, if you really want to know what
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.480]  the best phenotype is grown in living soil. You know, it's a little more work, you might not get
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.920]  as much yield, you get great yields off living soil too, though. But, you know, as far as it
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:51.000]  also costs a lot less money once you have the soil in there as far as for input. So.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:57.960]  And a guy that's very famous, I'm sure you know, Jeff Lowenfield, he's got a really good book. And
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.920]  if anybody wants to, like, you know, look it up and research, he's definitely one that's got some
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:11.360]  wonderful information, very intelligent person. Yeah. Okay. So I got a question based on someone
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.760]  said something about F2s. JJ, what's your opinion on selling F2 seeds to people? You sell F2s?
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:29.520]  I sell F2s, sure. Nice. And, you know, and just, you know, going back to the living soil and all
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:34.080]  that, you know, because that, you know, that's translating into, you know, these guys have,
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:42.880]  you know, the, you know, the only solventless pen, you know, in Denver right now, they have, you know,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.640]  this, you know, rosin pen, and they got the texture down to where it's soluble and smokable.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.320]  And so, you know, you know, you so you're going from, you know, total organic flower,
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:02.240]  you know, pressing that down into rosin, and then process processing that into,
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:10.080]  into the pen. So, I mean, these guys are, you know, on the cutting edge of technology,
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:14.880]  and I believe they have that whole thing patented, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:22.640]  Yeah, it's pretty mind blowing these live resin pens. And yeah, even yeah, that's these,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.040]  you know, where you get the flavor. It's like nothing else. I mean, the terps that you can
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.640]  capture, I think a lot of terps, typically, so if you're using something like, like,
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:41.660]  it just comes out with better expression. Huge fan. What about you, Chuck? What's your opinion?
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:48.780]  They're nice. They're nice. You know, like I said, as far as like JJ was saying, the DabLogic pens
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:53.260]  that they're doing, you know, at Verde, a lot of people don't realize DabLogic is,
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:59.020]  you know, basically processing Verde's flour. So, you know, like I tell everybody, at the end
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:03.420]  of the day, you could be the best hash artist, but if you don't have the right material to process,
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:09.420]  you can only kind of get what you get. You know, these guys are definitely taking their time. And,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:14.620]  you know, I'm not much of a pen person, but I will tell you, they are my favorite pen in the world,
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:20.460]  by far. And anybody, you know, I turn them on to, they say the same thing. The solvent list is,
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:26.220]  you know, it's going to take off. You know, most of the times you hit a pen and it's just kind of
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.260]  like, ah, you know, you taste the food grade turps in it. You don't even get high off of it. It's
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:37.340]  almost like hitting a jewel pen or something. So, you know, for me, I still love to smoke my flowers,
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.700]  but, you know, these pens for convenience, I mean, it's almost like taking a dab off of a rig.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.100]  Yeah, totally.
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:51.020]  So, but, but yeah, man, there's, there's a lot of good things that are happening. And,
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.100]  you know, like I said, thank God that, you know, JJ's coming on board. I mean, it's,
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:22:01.740]  it's really going to be fun to have, you know, his expertise and, you know, it's, it's, you know,
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.580]  there's not a lot of people that are doing the work the right way, you know, as we know, I mean,
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.980]  look how many seed companies are on the internet right now. You know, back in the day, you know,
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.220]  we all knew, you know, the ones and stuff like that, but now everybody and their mother is a
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:14.940]  seed breeder.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:20.220]  Wow. Cause anybody can make seeds and everybody's not, everybody's breeding F1s. There's a handful
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:25.820]  of people that are doing the work like JJ. You know, it's like, you gotta, you gotta back cross,
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:30.540]  you gotta inbreed. You have to take it to that level and see what the, the progeny that you're
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:37.100]  creating, what that expression is like. And I feel like we can kind of touch on selecting,
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:43.500]  selecting males. You, you talked about, you know, the stem. And I think one of the mistakes people
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.700]  make the most when selecting males is, you know, they're, they're breeding it onto something and
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:54.140]  then they're losing the terpenes. And a lot of the terpenes come from the male. So if you do a bad
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.700]  selection, you're going to have stuff that's less terpy than both the parents. Especially, you know,
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:03.580]  with regular breeding, feminized breeding, you can kind of tell what you're imparting on, but with,
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:09.100]  with using males, you really have to understand selection. Do you want to talk about, you know,
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:16.220]  selecting males a little more, JJ? You know, you ha you know, when you, when you select the male,
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:23.020]  you know, and you know, you have a clone only. So, you know, obviously you don't have a male.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:30.060]  So, you know, you gotta, you know, you gotta find something that is comparable or that's not going
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:37.660]  to be over dominant, you know, cause really, you know, when I was picking my male, not, you know,
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:42.220]  there were certain traits that I look for, you know, you know, a lot of it was with the structure
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.260]  and everything like that. But, you know, you also, you gotta like what you're saying,
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:52.860]  take into account terpenes, you know, you know, luckily for me, when I did the Afghan one,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:24:00.060]  the Afghan one is not, you know, a terpene dominant strain, you know, it's, you know,
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:07.820]  it's got that piney kind of methanol, you know, so when I cross that into the chem,
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:13.740]  you know, the chem dominated it, you know, pretty quickly. And then once you start back crossing it,
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:18.700]  you know, and that now it kind of becomes chem, you know, but, you know, so when you, you know,
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.420]  when you're doing an out cross, you know, you gotta, you know, you gotta look at these things
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.620]  and, you know, and you gotta have a vision on, you know, what, what, what your outcome is going
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:34.380]  to be. Do you want, you want to bring, you want to bring, you know, if you're using a certain strain,
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:41.020]  do you want to bring in a different terpene profile mixed with that strain, or are you looking to,
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.900]  or are you just looking to reproduce that strain? You know what I mean? So, you know,
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:52.460]  there's a lot of things that, you know, that come into account on what your final outcome is going
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:59.900]  to be. So, so yeah, you know, that, you know, that's, you know, like I was saying, you know,
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:06.940]  a lot of it has to go with the domination of the male of that strain's terps in general. So,
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:14.700]  you know, if you, if you're looking for, you know, something to add or whatever, you gotta take that
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:21.420]  all into account in what, in what you do. And then when you pick your male, you know, you gotta pick
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:31.260]  the male that, you know, that's going to, that you think is going to resemble, that best resembles
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:36.380]  the strain that you're, you know, you're working with. You know, so if you're, you know, just,
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:42.940]  you know, if you're looking at something that's a little bit more sativa or like a sour diesel,
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:48.140]  you'd be looking for a more stretchier male to use.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:57.740]  Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I think these are parts of true breeding and then also testing your work
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:05.340]  and working off your own work. Those are all important things. Let's see.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:11.980]  We got some interesting comments going on here. Politics. Yeah. We can keep politics out of the
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:17.020]  chat. I'd be a fan of, you know, I mean, I believe you're entitled to your opinions on politics. I
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:24.700]  don't want to get into politics. Right. Let's just talk weed. Yeah. So, so actually I have a JJ
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:32.220]  question. So venues in Manhattan or Brooklyn or elsewhere in the eighties and nineties, what were
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:41.340]  the, what were the spots you were going to, to listen to bands? Down to the wetlands. We used to
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:52.760]  go, used to go down there. I'm trying to think of some of the clubs, you know, well, one of my,
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:58.200]  one of my favorite places was Madison Square Garden. That was one of my favorite places to
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.720]  go see the Dead play. It was at the garden, you know, cause you know you know, seeing the dead
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:13.240]  and take over Manhattan was just incredible. You know, if anyone ever went on tour,
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:20.120]  you know especially out West, you know, it was like the town just became in, you know,
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:26.680]  overrun with dead heads. But you know, when you had the, when it came into Manhattan,
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:35.240]  Manhattan was able to absorb, absorb all those people somehow. And so it was just a really
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:45.480]  different dynamic to see. Yeah. Dead shows prior to 95 were pretty amazing.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.840]  You know, I mean, I can remember just going into like a, you know, a parking lot and,
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.880]  you know, where you park your car, you know, and there was, you know, with the tanks and
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:05.880]  all kinds of stuff going on. Eventually, you know, eventually the motorcycle police,
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.960]  just they all on Harley's, he just raided the place and just started circling all around,
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:18.040]  just getting everyone out, you know, kicking everyone out of there. But you know, you give a
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:24.280]  dead head a little crack and I'll just, you know, they'll take whatever you give them, you know,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:30.920]  and make something out of it. So, Oh yeah. And which parks were you in? Were you in like
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.400]  Washington square park or what was kind of like your go to park? Yeah. I mean,
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.800]  originally Washington square park, you know, I mean, we used to go down there and buy weed and
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:47.880]  then buy acid and then drop acid. You know, the park used to be open all night long. So it used
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:54.920]  to be able to sit on the park benches and drink quarts of beer and smoke weed and drop acid and
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.080]  just laugh and just have a good old time, you know, and then I, you know, made my way up into
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:07.960]  central park and it was a little bit, a little bit rougher up there. Now you had to be on your toes.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.320]  You had to be street smart. You know, guys would come up to you and walk up to you to, you know,
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:20.360]  they try to rob you. They would try to test you, you know, you know see what you're made out of.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:28.600]  And so, and that's really where I made my bones was up, up in, up in central park. And, you know,
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:36.120]  they used to sell acid up there and all kinds of stuff. It was like a walking drug, drug supermarket
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.120]  up there, up in Sheeps Meadows back in the nineties.
[01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:49.210]  Nice. Good times. Yeah. We had Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
[01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:55.530]  Yeah. It was the same kind of scene because we actually, you had people that would float back
[01:29:55.530 --> 01:30:02.730]  from central park to the, you know, Golden Gate Park. And, you know, people used to tell me,
[01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:06.010]  oh, it's the same thing. It's the same thing. You got to go. You got to go.
[01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:14.250]  Yeah. Eating acid in Golden Gate Park and getting lost. Good times.
[01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:19.610]  I mean, it used to be, you know, it used to be hippie circles with people with us, you know,
[01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:26.250]  playing guitar and drums and whatever instrument they had, you know, and, you know, we used to
[01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:33.690]  make a big circle and people used to walk around selling beers and, you know, whatever you wanted
[01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:41.130]  was right there. Yeah. It's funny because I would never do that today, but when I was like 14,
[01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:46.650]  15 years old, we would go into the city and it was no big deal to go get acid off of somebody.
[01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:51.770]  We had no idea who they were. They could, you know, they could have robbed us. Luckily, like,
[01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:55.210]  I mean, I ended up getting ripped off in New York one time for a bag of weed.
[01:30:56.330 --> 01:31:00.890]  Dude sold me like it was dirt and sticks for 60 bucks.
[01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:08.330]  Yeah. I mean, they used to have, you know, they used to have the real paper out there,
[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:15.210]  but it was just, it wasn't coded though. So they had stuff that looked real and it just,
[01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:20.090]  this wasn't, you know, this, this wasn't coded with the acid. So,
[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:22.970]  you know, they, you know, it depended on who you were.
[01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:32.650]  Right. Yeah. But good acid back in the day. I mean, I took acid a bunch of times before I even
[01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:37.770]  smoked weed because I thought for some reason it was less dangerous and, you know, it turns out
[01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:42.250]  neither one of them are dangerous, but, you know, at a young age, I thought smoking was bad for your
[01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:50.890]  lungs. So. Yeah. Acid is a real commitment, you know, I'd say. Yeah. I'm more of a shrooms guy now.
[01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:56.330]  Well, yeah. Now in Denver, you guys are, you know, here in Oakland, we have, you know,
[01:31:56.330 --> 01:32:00.970]  we've passed decriminalized the mushrooms at least. And you guys are the same way over in
[01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:03.770]  Denver as well, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's decriminalized.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:09.610]  Nice. Yeah. Big things changing. Yeah. With mushrooms, it's like you can take a small
[01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:12.810]  amount and you get a nice little body, how you take a little more, but it's like a four or five
[01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:18.410]  hour commitment at the most. And shit, I've taken acid where it's like a 12 to 24 hour commitment.
[01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:25.370]  And the thing about acid is, you know, you know, when I was a kid, you know, you'd always take it,
[01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:31.290]  you know, like, you know, before, you know, early in the evening, you know, so, you know,
[01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:37.930]  by the time, you know, by the time you went home, you know, three, four, five o'clock,
[01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:44.170]  you know, you're still laying in bed, you know, you're, you're kind of speeding out a little bit.
[01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:49.370]  And, you know, the sun is coming up, the birds are chirping, you know, and you're,
[01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:56.010]  and you're still trying to go to sleep, you know, and so, you know, I just had too many experiences
[01:32:56.010 --> 01:33:01.530]  like that. And I was like, you know, I think acid is what, you know, but when you get really good
[01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:05.770]  clean acid, it's different, but like what you said, you don't know what you're getting.
[01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:10.170]  Yeah, we got a little bit of everything, strychnine acid where your back would hurt.
[01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:17.050]  Right. My jaw would always, my jaw would always bother me. And also with the mask on,
[01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:22.090]  if you ever had, if you ever done mask on, it used to be, that used to be really bad too.
[01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:27.930]  Yeah, get you sick. You get like, waist, like, yeah, stomach, stomach turning.
[01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:31.290]  Right. Yeah. But it always fucked with my jaw though, like.
[01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:38.730]  Yeah. Yeah. That's the worst, the jaw on the back. We'd have, I'd have back pains. And I remember
[01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:44.250]  staring at my popcorn ceiling when I was a kid, I'd go home and sneak in before, before the sun
[01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:53.610]  came up and then try to get asleep, staring at the popcorn ceiling, but good times. So yeah. So
[01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:57.450]  do we got any questions from the audience? I think we got about 12 minutes left. I'm sure people have
[01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:05.850]  some interesting questions. So someone, someone asked JJ, will you be bringing a real Hayes back
[01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:16.570]  or is there Uptown Brown as close as it gets? Right now I'm, you know, I'm bringing that,
[01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:27.290]  I'm doing a different version of that really. I did the, the A, the A5 male from Karma across
[01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:34.650]  that into the PIF S1, and that's going to be the female. And then the male is going to be
[01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:44.010]  the Mango Nigerian times the Black Hayes. So I'll be crossing those two together as well.
[01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:51.370]  What my next cross is going to be. And then I have also a version, also I have, you know,
[01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:59.130]  the, the C Hayes also. So I took the original Hayes, cross that into the Chem D, you know,
[01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:07.290]  and then I took a male of that across that into the, the PIF S1, but the female that I had have
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:17.370]  comes out more, it's more C dominant. So, you know, I might cross the, I might cross the A back
[01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:23.450]  into that. I just wound up getting the Strawberry Cough clone. So I'm going to probably be doing
[01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:32.250]  some work with that also. So but right now I kind of want to just, you know, shore up those A5
[01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:38.970]  Hayes genetics and, and so, you know, in, in, in different crosses.
[01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:46.370]  So JJ, I got a question for you real quick now that we're talking about this stuff before we
[01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:50.770]  get into some more questions that I'm sure everyone wants to know. How many plants do you
[01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:56.610]  work with at a time? Like if you're making seed, are you pollinating one plant, 10 plants? How big
[01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:00.290]  of populations are you typically working with when you're doing a lot of this back crossing
[01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:09.570]  and selection? Well, it depends, you know, I mean, because usually what happens is if I'm doing like
[01:36:09.570 --> 01:36:22.610]  a sour diesel project, you know, I will, you know, I'll take a bunch of clones, maybe, you know,
[01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:30.130]  like 10 sour diesel clones, you know what I mean? And then I'll pop, you know, I'll pop, you know,
[01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:37.970]  20 seeds or, or, you know, somewhere in that range. And then I'll select, you know, I'll select the
[01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:44.850]  male out of that, out of, you know, that, so that would be like what I'm breeding for. But at the
[01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:52.050]  same time, I'm, I'm running a bunch of clone only strains. So, you know, I will just throw one,
[01:36:53.650 --> 01:37:00.530]  one plant of our original New York City diesel or a plant of, of whatever into that room,
[01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:08.850]  whenever that breeding is going to happen. So, you know, on one aspect, you know, I'm, you know,
[01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:16.850]  I have a breeding project in mind that I'm doing, but then on the other side, I have a bunch of clone
[01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:25.170]  only strains that are just kind of laying around that I'm, that I'm keeping and whatever's ready
[01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:32.770]  to flower at the time, I'll just throw in, throw in there and, and do, and do the cross. So,
[01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:38.130]  depending on what, depending on what it is and what, what the outcome is going to be.
[01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:41.650]  And in some instances, it's just going to be like a one-time
[01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:48.370]  cross or a one-time chuck. And then I just keep moving on
[01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:50.690]  with the project that I'm working with at hand.
[01:37:51.010 --> 01:37:56.450]  So, do you, do you collect pollen or do you, you collect pollen and apply it or do you
[01:37:56.450 --> 01:38:03.730]  intermingle your plants? No, I, usually when I, when I make a, a breeding, I like to collect pollen
[01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:10.690]  and usually what I, what I usually do is, you know, I'll wait till the male is, you know,
[01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:18.370]  good and, you know, a lot of the, you know, flowers are open and then I take a piece of tin foil and I,
[01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:27.330]  you know, I cut the branches one by one and I, and I, I tamp them out on the tin foil,
[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:34.210]  you know, and that, that collects the pollen. Then, then I separate, you know, I separate the
[01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:40.130]  vegetative matter out, you know, I let it, you know, let the pollen sit out for a day or two,
[01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:46.530]  let it dry out and cure, sift it, make sure it's clean and not contaminated.
[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:50.930]  Then I'll put it in a vial and then I put it in the freezer.
[01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:56.130]  Nice. And how long have you used pollen after it's been collected?
[01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:04.530]  Um, usually around a year. It's, it's kind of hard to say. It depends on how you store it. You know,
[01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:12.930]  you gotta, you gotta, it's best to put rice in, in, inside the pollen itself so there's no
[01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:20.050]  condensation in the freezer, you know, and, and also wherever that vial is going to go,
[01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:26.610]  you should have that in like an airtight thing with rice in it because, you know, in, in freezers,
[01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:34.050]  you know, they, they, you know, they turn on and off and they automatically defrost. So when they
[01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:39.410]  do that, you know, you'll, you'll, you know, that's why you get condensation in, in, in,
[01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:45.970]  in that wall. If you get any, any condensation is gonna, you know, it's gonna ruin the pollen. So
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:51.330]  it depends on how you store it. Yeah. So Peter, what else we got?
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.560]  Well, Dual Field Bandits decided that he needed to ask this question in all caps because we haven't
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:12.240]  been answering it. So F2s. So, so the FOT, the, the mother and the FOT, let me find the previous,
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.400]  but basically like what's the father donating?
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:28.640]  What's the FOT? F2s, how do they represent the parents percentage wise?
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:34.000]  Two different questions there. Well, what the parents pass on if you're talking about males
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.440]  and females or F2s, what you get in F2s where you get, because F2s is where you get recessive
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.040]  traits. With the F1 hybrids that people are breeding with all these lines in them, you're
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.160]  gonna get, you know, the Mendelian, you can look at a chart and you're gonna get 50% in the middle,
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.800]  25% leaning towards each parent. But the thing is, is there's traits that are dominant and traits
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.160]  that are recessive and you may not get those recessive traits. Yeah. Some, some recessive
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.120]  traits won't even express in that original cross. You get those in the F2 generation where you'll
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.960]  start seeing outliers that have recessive traits that are, you know, that are good or bad. You can
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:19.280]  have both. But as far as, you know, that that's what the F2s, so you get, you get the real
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:26.880]  interesting stuff in the F2s, but it's also the most unstable genetics wise. So it requires a lot
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.800]  of work. And so me personally, I don't sell F2s because I feel like I save the F2s for myself.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.280]  That's where the stuff is that I have to go through. And most people, if you buy a 10 pack,
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.080]  I don't know if you're going to get a good F2, you know? So I like making sure that, you know,
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:48.960]  me personally, that I sell seeds that have, you know, you get stuff interesting in the 10 pack,
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.560]  but I've, I've always been worried about selling a 10 pack of seeds or a five pack of seeds and
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.560]  having people be disappointed. And you see the F2 comments.
[01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:10.510]  F2 is louder. Yes, it is. What's your take on that, JJ?
[01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:19.630]  The F2, you know, F2s, the mango Nigerian, you know, that's one line that I sold an F2 of.
[01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:26.990]  And, you know, the hay, you know, the haze and, you know, was just so dominant that,
[01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:36.270]  you know, they pretty much came out, you know, pretty uniform. The star dog I've, I've done the
[01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:47.070]  F2s. I've, cause I, I used the purple, the purple male, and I used a purple line and then I F2'd
[01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:54.510]  that. And then I used the purple male and cross that into the core heme and made the, the star
[01:42:54.510 --> 01:43:04.270]  dog IX, the N cross. And that, that one in particular, there were some phenos that were
[01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:13.950]  found in some Denver dispensaries that, that, that tested, I don't know, like 30 and like 28%
[01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:23.950]  THC. So they, they were actually getting higher test, test results out of the F2s than we did out
[01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:30.990]  of the, out of their initial cross. Cause the Cory and the Guava, they test usually around,
[01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:41.310]  I don't know, 22, 23%. So, but I don't do a lot of F2s, but, you know, in some instances I have,
[01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:49.150]  depending on the cross, but, you know, I, I know, you know, I'm very, I'm, I'm careful
[01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:56.350]  about that. And it, you know, depending on, you know, what the initial out cross is,
[01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:04.750]  you know, and, and really that just really just goes back to, you know, using your, your, your,
[01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:11.230]  your male, you know, what your out cross male is. And, you know, that's really where, you know,
[01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:17.070]  that's where the building, building blocks begin, you know, cause if you, you know, you start a
[01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:26.030]  foundation built on something that's, you know, not, not stable, then, you know, it's just going
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:32.430]  to work its way up the line at some point. So, you know, luckily for me, I started most of my
[01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:42.670]  stuff from Sensi, you know, even the, my Hayes line originally started from NL5 Hayes. I crossed
[01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:49.390]  that into the Nigerian, then I back crossed it into the Nigerian. So that really made, really
[01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:56.430]  made what my Nigerian line was, you know, and then I crossed that into the Mango Hayes.
[01:44:57.310 --> 01:45:03.550]  And, and then I just, you know, then I just kept crossing that into other Hayes.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:07.380]  Nice.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.020]  You know, but the Mango Nigerian, you know, like I said, we, you know, we have to that and
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:20.500]  you know, that, you know, you know, the, the mango on that was pretty dominant.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.500]  So we, we didn't find any, any issues with that.
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.180]  Yeah. So we have somebody in the crowd that they're talking about. F2s are usually a broad
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:37.540]  spectrum of all phenos, but the less inbred P1 and P2 are the less variations you will see.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:41.940]  Ideally, you should be working with true hybrid from homozygous parents,
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:49.300]  basically, or parental lines. So the thing is, is you, you know, you should be ideally that's,
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:55.940]  that's, we're talking about agriculture. So as far as those F2 varieties but you take it back
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:03.300]  a step to those F1s, nobody who has F1s that are homozygous, nobody. You tell me even unless you're
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:07.780]  working with a company like Energine that we had on there, you're not working with homozygous
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:14.340]  varieties. Homozygous, maybe if you're talking about land race varieties, but even still those,
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:19.220]  those things that we're talking about homozygous, if you actually look at the genomics behind it,
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:23.300]  they're, they're not homozygous. They're not true homozygous because what happens with true
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:28.740]  homozygous is we're talking about with Energine is when you have these stable lines and you have
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:34.180]  a true homozygous plant that you breed with another true homozygous plant, you get a,
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:39.220]  you get heterosis, which is hybrid vigor, but you get one expression. So you're going to have one,
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:44.580]  no phenotypical variation with that true F1, but you're going to have something that's in the
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:51.620]  middle of both of the parents. So as far as like, yes, you're right about the F2s, you know, you,
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:57.940]  you get expressions from the lineage that comes from both of the parents and, and the recessive
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:03.460]  stuff that may not be expressing in the F1, but you know, it, it's tricky and we're learning more
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:07.540]  about this every day. You know, I mean, if you look at all the breeding books, they're going to
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:12.980]  say when you make an F1, 50% are in the middle, 25% lean to work to each parent. And that's what
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:17.700]  we've been told. But if you watch my show with Energine, go back and watch it if you haven't,
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:27.540]  we definitely go into that. So I think that's it for questions, guys. I really appreciate everyone
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:34.100]  for coming on. Chuck, JJ, it's great having you guys on the show. Anything else in closing,
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:43.050]  Peter, you want to say? All those packs you've all been patiently waiting for.
[01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:54.010]  My little fingers have been packing them up and my pace is, keeps on increasing. And
[01:47:54.970 --> 01:48:01.290]  by the end of today, I will have packed many, many packs to be shipped.
[01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:05.370]  So packs are going out. So I see someone they bought from the Future Cannabis Project
[01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:10.810]  or 30, $320 worth of products. Yeah. It's going out.
[01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:17.210]  It's your order is probably packed up today and shipping tomorrow, which is a Monday. Today's a
[01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:26.890]  Sunday. The post office is not functioning today, but yes, as I like to describe it, the constipation
[01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:38.330]  is switching to just super regular shipping. Too much fiber could be bad.
[01:48:40.090 --> 01:48:46.490]  We've gone from constipated to whatever the opposite is. And I appreciate everybody's
[01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:52.490]  patience and to the people who are chill, the people who were calling us scam artists. I saw you.
[01:48:54.250 --> 01:49:01.130]  We are not scam artists. We are doing the best we can and we appreciate
[01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:11.850]  the patience. We appreciate JJ and Lemon Man who both came on. JJ, we did. I was so happy that we,
[01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:21.450]  again, the constipation, we plugged through to technical. We could see you and hear you,
[01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:28.730]  which was amazing because at first we couldn't. And your New York stories are amazing. I had many
[01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:35.690]  more, mostly music and venue questions, but we can save those for later.
[01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:41.290]  I'd love to come see you guys out in Colorado. We could do another show. I think we could do
[01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:46.810]  it was a great show and people were really receptive to it. So I'd love to do one in person.
[01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:49.850]  We'll see how this vaccine goes and this COVID stuff.
[01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:55.930]  By the way, are you rocking a General Hydroponic shirt?
[01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.010]  I am. I have an old school General Hydroponic shirt and I have my grassroots hat. This is my
[01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:07.610]  psychedelic grassroots hat that I absolutely love. Oh yeah. And then I've been smoking on my bellows
[01:50:07.610 --> 01:50:10.970]  just so you guys can see this. I'm not getting sponsored by anybody. I'm just showing good
[01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:16.570]  products. I want to bring the founders of that on because I love that. Yeah, wait.
[01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:23.290]  So we got the bellow. I'll fill it up with a little more smoke and then you can drink your
[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:32.970]  dab. It's like a cappuccino cup. It actually is kind of like a whiskey snifter, like one of the
[01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:38.490]  old school ones, but for tasting whiskey. But yeah, I think it's great. And the guys from bellow,
[01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:40.970]  I've been talking to them. They are going to come on the show hopefully next week.
[01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:48.970]  Oh, fuck. All right. You're ahead of me. Yep. All right. Well, somebody just mentioned that I need
[01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:56.170]  to pack their seeds up. So yes, I need to do less shows and more packing for all the people who are
[01:50:56.170 --> 01:51:04.010]  waiting. But you will get some James Loud genetics in your hand shortly. The wait is over.
[01:51:05.210 --> 01:51:17.050]  The constipation, the Metamucil has been taken. And if I could turn my camera around, I would.
[01:51:17.050 --> 01:51:23.130]  Actually, you know, do you guys want to hold on one second? All right. Give me, let me amuse myself.
[01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:58.510]  We see some packaging. Yeah, we got an influx of orders. We had no idea you guys would want to buy
[01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:02.510]  so many seeds and I really appreciate everything. We're going to be doing something special
[01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:07.710]  for all the people that got seeds in the last month. Peter and I will be announcing after people
[01:52:07.710 --> 01:52:12.590]  get the seeds. We want to make sure everyone gets their seeds before we do another big thing. But we
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:18.430]  got some interesting stuff in store for everybody. So I really appreciate everyone tuning in and
[01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:20.910]  tuning in and we'll talk to you guys very soon.
[01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:25.710]  Oh, Lemon Hut. Wait, let me unmute you guys.
