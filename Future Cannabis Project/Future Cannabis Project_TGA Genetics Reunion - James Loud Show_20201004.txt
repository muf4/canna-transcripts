[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  How you doing?
[00:00.840 --> 00:01.780]  Three.
[00:01.780 --> 00:02.620]  Good, brother.
[00:02.620 --> 00:04.420]  All right, we are now live.
[00:04.420 --> 00:05.900]  Welcome, everybody.
[00:07.180 --> 00:09.780]  That is what we're talking about.
[00:09.780 --> 00:12.340]  And James, let me pass it off to you.
[00:14.340 --> 00:18.180]  James, who is our show host, is jumping back on.
[00:18.180 --> 00:21.940]  So everyone, give him a second while I help Jill also log in.
[00:23.580 --> 00:25.420]  Should we be wearing masks?
[00:25.420 --> 00:26.260]  Yeah.
[00:26.260 --> 00:27.080]  Yeah.
[00:27.080 --> 00:27.920]  Yeah.
[00:27.920 --> 00:28.740]  Yeah.
[00:28.740 --> 00:30.920]  I have some Mexican wrestling masks.
[00:30.920 --> 00:31.760]  Yeah.
[00:36.120 --> 00:38.160]  Yeah, let me, hold on.
[00:40.580 --> 00:41.420]  Sorry.
[00:41.420 --> 00:42.980]  All right, let me just quickly,
[00:42.980 --> 00:46.420]  everybody give us one second.
[00:46.420 --> 00:48.660]  I'm gonna rename someone.
[00:50.740 --> 00:51.740]  I'm back.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.940]  Okay, there we go.
[00:52.940 --> 00:55.420]  I was just passing it off to you.
[00:55.420 --> 00:57.220]  So why don't you take over again?
[00:58.140 --> 00:59.780]  Hey, how's it going, everybody?
[00:59.780 --> 01:03.780]  Welcome to week two of the James Loud Show.
[01:03.780 --> 01:06.700]  This week we have the Green Avengers, TGA Genetics.
[01:06.700 --> 01:10.420]  We have some of the founding members and the original guys.
[01:10.420 --> 01:13.940]  I'd like to introduce Jinx.
[01:13.940 --> 01:16.900]  We've got Pat or Dirt Diggler.
[01:16.900 --> 01:20.720]  And we got Shane and Ray here on the line.
[01:20.720 --> 01:22.100]  We're waiting for Jill to connect
[01:22.100 --> 01:24.020]  and she should be on in a few minutes.
[01:24.860 --> 01:29.860]  You guys have been definitely a force in the US
[01:30.180 --> 01:33.860]  as far as seed go, as far as doing fruit forward genetics,
[01:33.860 --> 01:35.420]  kind of before everybody else.
[01:36.380 --> 01:39.380]  You guys wanna start by telling me
[01:39.380 --> 01:42.020]  how the Green Avengers got their name
[01:42.020 --> 01:44.100]  and how you guys got started?
[01:44.100 --> 01:44.940]  Sure.
[01:45.900 --> 01:48.460]  I met Sub via a friend who introduced me
[01:48.460 --> 01:53.220]  to a group of people who were on chat rooms back in the day
[01:53.260 --> 01:55.780]  that were all weed related and marijuana related.
[01:55.780 --> 01:57.740]  And this guy named Joe introduced me
[01:57.740 --> 01:59.820]  to this guy named Sub or Monty.
[01:59.820 --> 02:03.300]  And Monty was still on the East Coast at that time.
[02:03.300 --> 02:06.860]  And he had a lot of different little grows going on
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.540]  and he always had his hands on a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:10.500 --> 02:14.140]  And his vision was to ultimately start a seed company.
[02:14.140 --> 02:17.300]  And it's funny, his motto was,
[02:17.300 --> 02:20.820]  he wanted to follow drop seeds, not bombs.
[02:20.940 --> 02:23.340]  It's funny, you could see that on the logo of the seeds
[02:23.340 --> 02:26.180]  or that the planes dropping the bombs for TGA.
[02:27.780 --> 02:31.620]  But yeah, he had a long bring in coming up
[02:31.620 --> 02:35.020]  and he started making some seeds.
[02:35.020 --> 02:36.180]  There was a guy named Squid
[02:36.180 --> 02:37.580]  that he was living with at the time.
[02:37.580 --> 02:40.020]  And that's where the Danny boy was made
[02:40.020 --> 02:44.580]  and the Jax Cleaner BX1, which was Jax Cleaner Blueberry.
[02:44.580 --> 02:48.940]  And he was making those seeds, those seeds got finished
[02:48.940 --> 02:51.580]  and then he got some trouble for smuggling clones.
[02:51.580 --> 02:54.100]  And he went to jail for a little while.
[02:54.100 --> 02:57.020]  And during that time when he was in jail,
[02:57.860 --> 02:59.460]  he just kept on pushing his vision.
[02:59.460 --> 03:02.020]  He just wanted to grow weed and have a seed company.
[03:02.020 --> 03:04.860]  And so he's getting all buff, getting healthy in jail.
[03:04.860 --> 03:06.860]  He's teaching all these convicts
[03:06.860 --> 03:09.460]  how to grow weed in the joint.
[03:09.460 --> 03:12.860]  And at that time he was still on the internet
[03:12.860 --> 03:16.420]  and he was talking with Jill and he was talking with me.
[03:16.420 --> 03:19.420]  And he had introduced me to Jill
[03:19.420 --> 03:21.380]  who needed some help with her grow room.
[03:21.380 --> 03:24.460]  And at that time, nobody was talking about growing.
[03:24.460 --> 03:29.420]  It was really close and nobody spoke about what we were doing
[03:29.420 --> 03:32.300]  when you go to the grow shop back in the day,
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.340]  they would be filming all the license plates
[03:34.340 --> 03:37.220]  and shit like that, like American Egg and whatnot.
[03:37.220 --> 03:39.180]  One of the local grow shops in Portland.
[03:39.180 --> 03:42.660]  But so I ended up meeting Jill just by helping her
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.740]  rebuild her grow room.
[03:43.740 --> 03:46.260]  And at that point in time it was all medical
[03:47.100 --> 03:51.500]  and Jill and I started growing the Danny boy and the JCBX.
[03:51.500 --> 03:56.220]  And at that point in time, we had got sub out
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.980]  and he came out to Oregon.
[03:59.820 --> 04:04.220]  At that point, on top of his game,
[04:04.220 --> 04:06.100]  he was sober, he was just being ripped.
[04:06.100 --> 04:09.380]  And his was straight, he wanted to look at a seed company.
[04:09.380 --> 04:13.860]  He wanted to grow genetics and really routine.
[04:13.900 --> 04:16.620]  And that's how he kind of got it started was his early days
[04:16.620 --> 04:18.020]  and that guy had a vision.
[04:22.280 --> 04:23.120]  Awesome.
[04:26.480 --> 04:27.320]  Hey, how's it going?
[04:27.320 --> 04:28.560]  Is Shane cut right there?
[04:28.560 --> 04:29.400]  Oh yeah.
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.640]  My screen's freezing a little bit,
[04:31.640 --> 04:33.400]  but yeah, no, that sounds awesome.
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.080]  Do we get Jill on the line, Peter?
[04:35.080 --> 04:36.320]  Yep, she's on.
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.280]  And Jill, if you can turn your phone 90 degrees
[04:39.280 --> 04:42.720]  so it's more like a TV landscape.
[04:42.720 --> 04:43.560]  Yeah.
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.880]  Landscape, horizontal, it's horizontal.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.240]  You know what, I think your screen's locked.
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.360]  So like it doesn't rotate you.
[04:56.880 --> 04:59.400]  Hold on, let me see.
[04:59.400 --> 05:00.240]  There we go.
[05:02.120 --> 05:08.440]  I wasn't sure if I should comment on that first shot or not.
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.440]  All right, perfect.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.280]  Yep.
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.000]  Okay, awesome.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.320]  So we got Jill on the line here.
[05:17.440 --> 05:18.920]  So yeah, Jill, did you catch any of that
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.360]  on the start to the-
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.680]  Anything you wanna add to that?
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.120]  I originally met Sub on overgrow.com
[05:31.120 --> 05:33.680]  and we started talking there
[05:33.680 --> 05:37.160]  and he had ended up getting in some trouble
[05:37.160 --> 05:40.840]  and he had to flee to the UK.
[05:42.160 --> 05:45.320]  And then he ended up getting a job at a company
[05:46.160 --> 05:49.080]  and then he ended up in Canada
[05:49.080 --> 05:50.160]  and they picked him up
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.840]  and he'd got transferred back to the United States.
[05:53.840 --> 05:55.440]  And during that time, he was like,
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.520]  Sonny said he was with Squid.
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.400]  And so I had been talking to him
[06:00.400 --> 06:03.360]  and he ended up getting picked up right
[06:03.360 --> 06:04.520]  on some speeding charges,
[06:04.520 --> 06:06.760]  right as he was getting ready to come out and visit me.
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.840]  So I ended up going to Wisconsin,
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.560]  picking up his things
[06:11.560 --> 06:14.120]  and bringing them back to Oregon with me.
[06:14.120 --> 06:17.760]  I had his parole transferred to Oregon
[06:17.760 --> 06:22.400]  and TGA started in the grow room that I had pre-existing
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.640]  that was in the house that I was renting
[06:24.640 --> 06:27.920]  for my children and I back in Salem, Oregon at that time.
[06:28.880 --> 06:29.720]  Awesome.
[06:29.720 --> 06:31.920]  So how did the Green Avengers get their name?
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.200]  The name TGA is the Green Avengers
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.360]  or Team Green Avengers.
[06:38.360 --> 06:39.560]  That was the name that Sub
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.360]  and some of his other friends
[06:41.360 --> 06:43.680]  had already recently thought about.
[06:44.520 --> 06:45.360]  I'm trying to remember Doug.
[06:45.360 --> 06:47.320]  Doug Weiser was one of the people he was.
[06:49.440 --> 06:51.720]  Influenced by like the Avengers comic books
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.880]  where they had all the best superheroes get together
[06:53.880 --> 06:55.320]  and form a team.
[06:55.320 --> 06:56.160]  Yeah.
[06:56.160 --> 06:57.000]  Yeah. Awesome.
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.320]  Excellent.
[06:59.320 --> 07:01.080]  So with each one of you guys,
[07:01.080 --> 07:03.240]  how did you guys get started
[07:03.240 --> 07:04.920]  in cannabis cultivation and breeding?
[07:04.920 --> 07:05.880]  We'll start with you Jill,
[07:05.880 --> 07:08.520]  since you're just talking.
[07:08.520 --> 07:10.280]  I just, I started,
[07:10.280 --> 07:12.160]  my children were very young
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.000]  and I have scoliosis.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.920]  So I was smoking it for my pain in my back
[07:17.920 --> 07:21.360]  and it was pretty expensive as a single mom.
[07:21.360 --> 07:23.080]  So I started growing.
[07:23.080 --> 07:25.560]  My ex-husband, my children's father and I,
[07:25.560 --> 07:27.840]  we set up a grow originally
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.160]  and we had grown for several years before we split
[07:32.160 --> 07:34.200]  and I continued to do so.
[07:35.080 --> 07:36.160]  And as a single mom,
[07:36.160 --> 07:37.920]  I had to continue to grow,
[07:37.920 --> 07:39.400]  to support that.
[07:39.400 --> 07:43.680]  But I had met some patients along the way.
[07:43.680 --> 07:44.680]  One of them,
[07:44.680 --> 07:48.240]  the most influential one was a lady named Lou Anne.
[07:48.240 --> 07:51.280]  She was, she had MS
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.520]  and my children's father had,
[07:53.520 --> 07:55.920]  was helping them set up their grow.
[07:55.920 --> 07:59.560]  And that's where I received the orange velvet from.
[07:59.560 --> 08:02.360]  She came to me named Melvin.
[08:02.360 --> 08:03.600]  And as I grew her out,
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.080]  she had such beautiful black foliage.
[08:06.080 --> 08:08.240]  You know, it looked like velvet.
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.880]  She smelled so strong, like orange.
[08:09.880 --> 08:12.400]  So it's just a no brainer on the name there.
[08:15.160 --> 08:16.000]  Awesome.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.320]  So Jinx, you had the nine pound hammer.
[08:19.320 --> 08:21.840]  You know, I think that's one of the more popular strains
[08:21.840 --> 08:24.520]  that I've grown from you guys that I absolutely love
[08:24.520 --> 08:28.480]  and I've done some work with and my partners as well.
[08:28.480 --> 08:30.080]  How did you get your start
[08:30.080 --> 08:32.040]  for cannabis cultivation and breeding?
[08:33.040 --> 08:35.080]  Well, as far as like starting growing,
[08:35.080 --> 08:36.520]  I mean, I started when I was younger
[08:36.520 --> 08:40.080]  and I mean, it was as a young guy,
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.040]  like I think I was 20, you know, I sold bud,
[08:43.040 --> 08:44.560]  you know, it was just something I did.
[08:44.560 --> 08:46.240]  And then I knew this other guy,
[08:46.240 --> 08:48.800]  he would never admit it, but I knew he grew bud, you know?
[08:48.800 --> 08:49.680]  So we finally, you know,
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.360]  cause when I was a kid, you didn't admit it.
[08:51.360 --> 08:52.200]  You know what I mean?
[08:52.200 --> 08:53.520]  Not even to your best friend
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.080]  cause it was just too much trouble and stuff.
[08:55.080 --> 08:57.000]  So I finally got this guy and he said,
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.440]  I'll show you how to grow
[08:58.440 --> 09:00.360]  if you give me half your first crop.
[09:00.360 --> 09:01.480]  Seemed fair to me.
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.160]  And then, you know, I mean, as a kid,
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.200]  it was all about money.
[09:04.240 --> 09:05.480]  You know, if I, you know,
[09:05.480 --> 09:07.080]  I was buying weed and reselling it.
[09:07.080 --> 09:09.160]  So to grow it and resell it,
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.920]  obviously made a lot more sense and a lot more money,
[09:11.920 --> 09:14.960]  you know, allowed me to quit my conventional job
[09:14.960 --> 09:17.400]  and pursue other things that I was interested in,
[09:17.400 --> 09:19.040]  like tattooing and, you know,
[09:19.040 --> 09:20.480]  glass blowing and stuff like that.
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.200]  So, I mean, it was, you know,
[09:22.200 --> 09:24.120]  I wish I had some, you know,
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.040]  some great story that I needed to help somebody
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.080]  or something about that, like I said,
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.440]  but I was just a kid and I was, you know,
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.840]  I was after some money.
[09:29.840 --> 09:32.680]  And then as far as breeding me, my buddy Brent,
[09:32.680 --> 09:35.840]  we'd had a few plants that had shown up male
[09:35.840 --> 09:37.480]  and we did the old paintbrush thing
[09:37.480 --> 09:40.840]  where we just painted a couple little buds
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.600]  and we got some seeds and we barely even grew them out.
[09:44.600 --> 09:46.760]  Cause like, I didn't know much about seeds.
[09:46.760 --> 09:48.320]  Like I'd seen a few things, you know,
[09:48.320 --> 09:50.960]  whenever I could come across a High Times Magazine,
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.720]  cause in Seattle it was really hard to get one.
[09:52.720 --> 09:54.480]  It was, you know, it was almost like buying porno
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.600]  or something for a young guy, you know,
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.840]  you couldn't find them.
[09:57.840 --> 10:00.480]  And I just set the seeds aside, tell you the truth.
[10:00.480 --> 10:03.680]  And then once I started working for Sub,
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.080]  I decided to do my own breeding, which I used the Gooberry,
[10:07.080 --> 10:09.800]  which was one of the ones that we had paintbrushed.
[10:09.800 --> 10:12.440]  And I did at times Pat's Jesus OG.
[10:12.440 --> 10:14.600]  And I talked to Sub and Sub was like,
[10:14.600 --> 10:17.520]  I don't sell other people's seeds.
[10:17.520 --> 10:20.480]  I could be wrong, but I think I was, of all of us,
[10:20.480 --> 10:22.480]  I think I was the first one that he distributed
[10:22.480 --> 10:25.120]  our other people's seeds.
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.080]  Oh, actually Pat, cause I had the Jesus OG.
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.800]  So I guess Pat was probably first.
[10:28.840 --> 10:32.680]  But I started just giving them out free
[10:32.680 --> 10:34.200]  whenever I did TGA sales,
[10:34.200 --> 10:37.000]  cause I would go from, back then it wasn't a recreation,
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.040]  it was medical.
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.040]  So I'd go from co-op to co-op
[10:40.040 --> 10:41.880]  and I would give them a handful
[10:41.880 --> 10:43.400]  of these free nine pound hammers.
[10:43.400 --> 10:46.000]  So if you bought a pack of TGA,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.640]  you got a free pack of nine pound hammer, you know,
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.760]  just to kind of promote,
[10:49.760 --> 10:52.240]  cause I was a new rep and stuff like that,
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.400]  just to kind of get things going.
[10:53.400 --> 10:55.680]  And then with the power of social media
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.440]  just kind of started blowing up.
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.000]  And that's when Sub actually called me
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.480]  and was like, let's do something with this,
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.360]  this nine pound hammer.
[11:01.360 --> 11:03.240]  How can we work this out?
[11:03.240 --> 11:06.080]  I had my own packaging, Jinx Proof Genetics,
[11:06.080 --> 11:08.840]  then it had, you know, TGA in the corner there.
[11:08.840 --> 11:11.440]  And it just kind of rolled from there.
[11:12.560 --> 11:13.960]  What year was that roughly?
[11:15.880 --> 11:18.520]  I'd say it's been nine or 10 years now.
[11:18.520 --> 11:19.920]  You know, it's been a minute.
[11:19.920 --> 11:23.000]  Unfortunately, since this whole epilepsy thing started,
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.480]  my memory is super bad.
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.120]  So I couldn't tell you exactly,
[11:26.120 --> 11:28.720]  but I know because where I lived and where I live now
[11:28.720 --> 11:30.040]  and how long I've lived here.
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.400]  So I would say about nine or 10 years now.
[11:33.400 --> 11:34.720]  10 or 11.
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.600]  But yeah, maybe more now actually.
[11:36.600 --> 11:38.080]  I've been saying that for a couple of years.
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.160]  So of all the guys out here,
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.160]  my story is the favorite of how I connected with Sub.
[11:46.160 --> 11:49.920]  Cause to be totally honest, I had no idea who Sub was.
[11:49.920 --> 11:53.760]  And somebody brought me a pamphlet from a co-op
[11:53.760 --> 11:55.000]  and I was like, wow, look at this.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.120]  This guy just selling seeds
[11:56.120 --> 11:58.520]  and it had a Ace of Spades and plush berry.
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.480]  And I was like, look at this, pink weed.
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.440]  You know, I'd grown some pretty purple stuff,
[12:02.440 --> 12:04.640]  but I'd never even seen pink weed before.
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.200]  So, and I went to his website
[12:06.200 --> 12:08.160]  and it said available in Washington.
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.640]  Well, I called every co-op in town
[12:10.640 --> 12:12.200]  and none of them had his stuff,
[12:12.200 --> 12:14.080]  even though it said available in Washington.
[12:14.080 --> 12:17.920]  I finally found one co-op that had his stuff.
[12:17.920 --> 12:18.840]  They're way into Tacoma.
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.920]  I live Seattle, it's pretty far.
[12:20.920 --> 12:22.000]  So I tried to talk to him and he said,
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.120]  we don't talk about strains on the phone.
[12:24.120 --> 12:25.840]  So basically I had to drive to Tacoma
[12:25.840 --> 12:27.080]  and see what they had.
[12:27.080 --> 12:30.120]  I get out there, they have one pack of seeds,
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.600]  one pack of seeds.
[12:31.600 --> 12:34.040]  And it wasn't either one of these pink strains,
[12:34.040 --> 12:35.320]  it was Kaboom.
[12:35.320 --> 12:36.440]  And no disrespect,
[12:36.440 --> 12:39.520]  but like Kaboom was the one strain I didn't want, you know.
[12:39.520 --> 12:41.600]  But I bought it anyways.
[12:41.600 --> 12:44.520]  And I, you know, I got stuck in rush hour traffic.
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.360]  This was, you know,
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.080]  ended up being an eight hour adventure all day long
[12:48.080 --> 12:50.280]  for one pack of seeds I really didn't even want.
[12:50.280 --> 12:53.640]  So when I got home, I sent Sub an email
[12:54.320 --> 12:55.960]  and I told him my story and stuff.
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.880]  And I was like, this is kind of bullshit.
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.960]  You know, you have a website that says, you know,
[13:00.960 --> 13:03.240]  your seeds are available over Washington and they're not.
[13:03.240 --> 13:05.280]  You know, and at the end of the email,
[13:05.280 --> 13:07.400]  I told him if you ever want a real estate rep,
[13:07.400 --> 13:10.440]  you let me know, I get shit done, you know.
[13:10.440 --> 13:12.800]  And then like five minutes later, he calls me
[13:12.800 --> 13:13.920]  and I was shocked.
[13:13.920 --> 13:14.760]  You know, I was like, well,
[13:14.760 --> 13:17.560]  here's this like famous dude all calling me five minutes
[13:17.560 --> 13:20.720]  later and we started talking and he's like, bro,
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.080]  do you know how many emails I get every day?
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.000]  And I was like, well, I'm assuming a lot.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.280]  He's like, I read yours because the title of the email
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.480]  said Subco sucks in Seattle.
[13:33.240 --> 13:34.720]  Cause I was kind of pissed off, you know,
[13:34.720 --> 13:36.160]  on this whole day adventure.
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.280]  So we started talking and he told me how it works.
[13:38.280 --> 13:40.360]  And you know, he's like, you know,
[13:40.360 --> 13:41.520]  I don't just send seeds out,
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.360]  you gotta buy them and go resell them.
[13:43.360 --> 13:45.760]  So I was like, I crop in two weeks, you know,
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.000]  I'll send you enough money to get started.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.160]  And I did.
[13:49.160 --> 13:51.640]  And he sent me the seeds and he never showed up.
[13:51.640 --> 13:54.360]  So I called him and I was like, bro, like, you know,
[13:54.360 --> 13:55.960]  I'm going on faith here.
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.880]  And then he's like, well, I'm gonna go on faith
[13:57.880 --> 14:00.040]  and I'm gonna resend your order.
[14:00.040 --> 14:01.280]  And he sends my order.
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.960]  That's funny cause the postman stuffed it in the,
[14:04.960 --> 14:07.160]  at an old school traditional mailbox
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.000]  and he stuffed it in there.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.240]  I could not get it out
[14:09.240 --> 14:11.200]  cause he stuffed it all the way in the back.
[14:11.200 --> 14:13.520]  I literally had to take a hammer and bust the sides
[14:13.520 --> 14:17.480]  of my mailbox open to get this box out.
[14:17.480 --> 14:21.400]  And then the neighbor comes like three or four hours later
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.360]  and he's like, hey man, I got one of your packages
[14:23.360 --> 14:25.960]  and it was the original subco order.
[14:25.960 --> 14:27.640]  So then I called sub and I was like, hey man,
[14:27.640 --> 14:30.800]  I got your original order.
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.280]  I could send it back or you can basically, you know,
[14:33.280 --> 14:35.040]  leave it here and I'll pay for it.
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.360]  Which was great because it instantly started us off
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.560]  on a good relationship.
[14:39.560 --> 14:41.400]  You know, he's like, I could have easily kept that box.
[14:41.400 --> 14:43.480]  He would have never known, you know,
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.200]  all said and done, it was probably 10 G's.
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.040]  You know what I mean?
[14:46.360 --> 14:49.440]  It started us off on a nice trusting relationship
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.480]  cause he didn't know me at all, you know?
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.920]  And so I took him out, went from every co-op in town
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.960]  and I killed it cause nobody had seeds,
[14:57.960 --> 14:59.240]  let alone TGA seeds
[14:59.240 --> 15:01.320]  cause everybody else in town knew who he was, you know?
[15:01.320 --> 15:03.440]  And I came home and I sent him a picture.
[15:03.440 --> 15:05.440]  I just had a stack of money, you know?
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.480]  Cause every single co-op picked him up, you know?
[15:08.480 --> 15:10.280]  And I was like, see, I told you bro.
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.160]  That's that started the subco Jinks relationship,
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.480]  obviously Jill and some of the other folks
[15:18.480 --> 15:21.480]  came in long as well and ended up going to shows
[15:21.480 --> 15:22.440]  and meeting in person.
[15:22.440 --> 15:25.680]  And we became pretty good friends as well as Jill,
[15:25.680 --> 15:27.280]  as well as the rest of the crew.
[15:30.240 --> 15:32.520]  I've met a lot of crews from other seed companies,
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.680]  I'm not gonna drop any names or anything,
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.600]  but there's not a person on this crew
[15:36.600 --> 15:39.520]  that isn't just awesome, you know?
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.680]  That isn't just fun, isn't just great, especially Pat.
[15:44.280 --> 15:45.640]  I mean, I'm just gonna call it out.
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.200]  Like sometimes people bring up Pat and I'm like, bro,
[15:49.200 --> 15:51.560]  if you don't like Pat, you're an asshole.
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.600]  There's just no way not to like this guy.
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.520]  You know what I mean?
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.480]  I mean, Pat has always been super cool to me.
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.360]  And then I met Odie, same thing, just a great guy.
[16:01.360 --> 16:03.520]  I've only met Shane a few times like at shows,
[16:03.520 --> 16:04.440]  you know, stuff like that.
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.280]  He'd already kind of was doing his own thing by then,
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.200]  but yeah, it was just such an awesome crew
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.640]  and we're definitely a family and Jill too.
[16:14.640 --> 16:16.520]  When I'd visit, I'd always bring my son and my wife
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.480]  and it wasn't business, it was a nice fun time
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.320]  and stuff like that.
[16:21.320 --> 16:24.120]  So I was, you know, and then like I said,
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.160]  I just kind of kept going from there,
[16:25.160 --> 16:27.080]  creating my own strains and distributing sub
[16:27.080 --> 16:29.960]  and that was basically the beginning
[16:29.960 --> 16:31.960]  of the Jinx Proof Subcool story.
[16:34.600 --> 16:36.280]  I think it was about-
[16:36.280 --> 16:37.440]  So yeah, so Pat.
[16:37.440 --> 16:38.840]  12 years before he passed.
[16:40.360 --> 16:42.120]  Wow, excellent.
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.360]  Well, yeah, so thanks for that.
[16:44.360 --> 16:46.640]  And then Pat, how'd you get your start?
[16:46.640 --> 16:48.960]  You know, you've come a long way since the subcool days
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.760]  with Heroes of the Farm and everything that you've done.
[16:52.960 --> 16:54.400]  How'd you get your start with the cultivation
[16:54.400 --> 16:56.200]  and on the breeding side as well?
[16:56.200 --> 16:59.640]  Yeah, I mean, it's been a long, long road.
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.560]  I mean, I'm definitely young, but I started,
[17:01.560 --> 17:02.960]  you know, I'm the youngest of five kids
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.360]  and I started smuggling weed at 10.
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.520]  I look at 10 year olds now, I'm like,
[17:05.520 --> 17:08.440]  yo, you're way too young, don't do that shit.
[17:08.440 --> 17:10.480]  But you know, I was definitely the guinea pig
[17:10.520 --> 17:11.560]  of the last children.
[17:11.560 --> 17:14.880]  And so by eighth grade, I started kind of hustling
[17:14.880 --> 17:17.400]  and, you know, it was just kind of a facet
[17:17.400 --> 17:19.720]  of how I made money, smoked for free.
[17:21.240 --> 17:24.160]  And then in 2004, I ended up coming out to Mount Hood
[17:24.160 --> 17:27.000]  by myself, Windell Snowboard Camp.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.560]  And, you know, after 10 days of being in Oregon,
[17:29.560 --> 17:31.560]  I went home and told my mom I was moving
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.640]  and my grade sucked.
[17:32.640 --> 17:34.200]  So I had to go to community college
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.600]  to get accepted into Portland State.
[17:36.600 --> 17:39.640]  And as my mom always said, I kind of minored in school
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.720]  and majored in snowboarding.
[17:41.720 --> 17:43.880]  And after like 10 days of living here,
[17:43.880 --> 17:45.920]  I met this dude, Micah,
[17:45.920 --> 17:48.280]  and it was one of those introductions where I was like,
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.000]  yo, this dude's either full of shit or the real deal.
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.400]  And he was definitely the real deal.
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.280]  And we started, you know, moving a lot of weight
[17:55.280 --> 17:58.640]  and I just wanted to be able to grow, you know, weed.
[17:58.640 --> 18:00.760]  So I ended up, you know, buying a light,
[18:00.760 --> 18:04.440]  putting it in a bathroom, you know, did our first grow.
[18:04.440 --> 18:06.880]  Weed in Portland was worth $4,000 a pound.
[18:06.880 --> 18:09.600]  Was able to sell it for 4K, you know, out of my kitchen.
[18:10.440 --> 18:11.440]  And, you know, being a young broke kid
[18:11.440 --> 18:12.720]  with nothing from the East Coast,
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.680]  I was like, yeah, we're gonna get another light.
[18:14.680 --> 18:18.640]  And one light turned into two, you know,
[18:18.640 --> 18:19.740]  kind of like Shane was saying,
[18:19.740 --> 18:21.520]  back in the day you couldn't get information
[18:21.520 --> 18:22.840]  in hydro stores.
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.760]  So I got kicked out of a lot of hydro stores,
[18:24.760 --> 18:26.300]  not knowing how to talk, you know,
[18:26.300 --> 18:28.680]  then you learn to talk tomatoes and all this shit.
[18:28.680 --> 18:32.180]  And I finally met Trace Myers in Northern Light and Garden.
[18:32.180 --> 18:34.320]  And, you know, he was all about pot
[18:34.320 --> 18:36.960]  and he was, you know, 20 years older than me
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.040]  and kind of, you know, one day I showed up there
[18:40.040 --> 18:41.720]  and I was going to buy a six light garden,
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.920]  you know, it was my second garden.
[18:42.920 --> 18:44.240]  I was super excited, you know,
[18:44.240 --> 18:47.220]  and a corn coil ballast was 250 bucks back then.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.640]  So, you know, you're spending $700
[18:48.640 --> 18:50.480]  for a thousand watt fixture.
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.080]  And, you know, I started moving soil that day for free
[18:53.080 --> 18:54.680]  cause I just got a big Fox Farm oil.
[18:54.680 --> 18:57.440]  There's a, I can't talk, a soil order.
[18:57.440 --> 18:59.760]  And so he gave me an employee discount,
[18:59.760 --> 19:01.980]  which back then it was 40% off.
[19:01.980 --> 19:03.800]  And I was like, you call me anytime.
[19:03.800 --> 19:06.740]  And I just really befriended the staff and kept showing up.
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.360]  And I always wanted to know more.
[19:08.360 --> 19:10.260]  And eventually they hired me at minimum wage,
[19:10.260 --> 19:11.140]  which I'll never forget.
[19:11.140 --> 19:14.140]  Cause it was 887 at the time, which wasn't shit.
[19:14.140 --> 19:15.980]  But I definitely wasn't in there for the paycheck.
[19:15.980 --> 19:17.220]  I was in there for the information
[19:17.220 --> 19:19.860]  and the employee discount, to be honest.
[19:19.860 --> 19:22.260]  You know, I sat there in that store for four years.
[19:22.260 --> 19:24.820]  And, you know, when I got there, no one trusted me.
[19:24.820 --> 19:27.660]  I didn't know shit and I had to, you know, learn a lot.
[19:27.660 --> 19:31.260]  And I always asked more and I used the shop to my advantage.
[19:31.260 --> 19:34.200]  Eventually I got, you know, recruited out, you know,
[19:34.200 --> 19:36.840]  by advanced nutrients and my territory, you know,
[19:36.840 --> 19:39.600]  was Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska.
[19:39.600 --> 19:41.600]  And that's what really opened my world up.
[19:41.600 --> 19:44.440]  And through that, I started going to all the shops.
[19:44.440 --> 19:46.280]  Northern Light and Garden had three different branches
[19:46.280 --> 19:47.100]  at the time.
[19:47.100 --> 19:49.240]  The Salem branch was one of them, you know,
[19:49.240 --> 19:50.360]  and one of the big, you know,
[19:50.360 --> 19:52.040]  people that are not on this podcast
[19:52.040 --> 19:53.360]  that I just got to give a huge shout out.
[19:53.360 --> 19:54.440]  Cause without him, you know,
[19:54.440 --> 19:55.960]  a lot of us wouldn't probably be together.
[19:55.960 --> 19:59.960]  Especially me is Dioxide, Joel, you know,
[19:59.960 --> 20:03.360]  solid friend still, solid dude, you know.
[20:03.360 --> 20:05.080]  And he was actually, you know,
[20:05.080 --> 20:06.560]  the one that introduced me to Sub,
[20:06.560 --> 20:08.680]  which it's a really fucking cool story
[20:08.680 --> 20:09.680]  and something that, you know,
[20:09.680 --> 20:11.400]  I'm humbled by and take great pride in.
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.320]  And he hit me up and it was just like, hey, you know,
[20:14.320 --> 20:18.040]  Sub was doing a book signing at the Third Eye
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.160]  and Jack Herro had just passed and Mark had come to him
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.720]  and he was all upset because, you know,
[20:23.720 --> 20:25.480]  the original seeds from Sensi Seed,
[20:25.480 --> 20:27.520]  the males and the female weren't the same
[20:27.520 --> 20:28.720]  cause they had lost them.
[20:28.720 --> 20:32.320]  So any of the recreations weren't the original Jack.
[20:32.320 --> 20:33.720]  And Joel hit me up and was like,
[20:33.720 --> 20:35.240]  I know you have the real cut.
[20:35.240 --> 20:39.680]  I'd gotten out of Bend, I think in 2007, I would say.
[20:39.680 --> 20:41.560]  And it was the real deal.
[20:41.560 --> 20:42.880]  And so he was like,
[20:42.880 --> 20:44.720]  would you be willing to give it to Sub
[20:44.720 --> 20:45.800]  to give back to Mark?
[20:45.800 --> 20:48.160]  It's actually in Weed World 91,
[20:48.160 --> 20:50.840]  the story of Sub giving it back.
[20:50.840 --> 20:53.120]  So I basically showed up,
[20:53.120 --> 20:56.240]  gave a plant to Joel, gave a plant to Sub
[20:56.240 --> 20:59.120]  and you know, Sub and I just started talking, you know,
[20:59.120 --> 21:01.480]  and through Joel, you know, we decided that,
[21:01.480 --> 21:03.560]  hey, let's do some breeding.
[21:03.560 --> 21:06.920]  So they gave me the original Space Queen male, Space Dude.
[21:06.920 --> 21:08.800]  And you know, that's kind of what launched
[21:08.800 --> 21:10.560]  into my breeding world.
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.760]  Unfortunately, my very first crop,
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.440]  like three days before I got married,
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.760]  at 56 days in harvest,
[21:15.760 --> 21:18.480]  someone broke in and stole the whole fucking thing.
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.680]  So I had to start that whole project again.
[21:20.680 --> 21:23.080]  And the thing that I always respected about Sub
[21:23.080 --> 21:25.360]  and that I really don't respect about a lot of breeders
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.840]  these days is he made you fucking test everything.
[21:28.840 --> 21:30.120]  And after breeding it,
[21:30.120 --> 21:33.280]  he made me test all of my shit for over a year.
[21:33.280 --> 21:35.040]  You know, it wasn't just like a hit and release.
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.560]  There you go, it's done.
[21:36.560 --> 21:38.760]  It's how's it go outside, you know,
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.320]  indoors, greenhouse, all that.
[21:40.320 --> 21:43.160]  So, you know, we put a lot of work into it.
[21:43.160 --> 21:45.520]  And, you know, in that time period, you know,
[21:45.520 --> 21:47.880]  California kicked off the very first Cannabis Cup
[21:47.880 --> 21:49.720]  and, you know, I was fortunate enough, you know,
[21:49.720 --> 21:53.240]  I was there, I got to work with Sub and Jill, you know,
[21:53.240 --> 21:55.560]  and I was there for the very beginning
[21:55.560 --> 21:58.200]  with Dioxide, Sub, you know, Jill.
[21:58.200 --> 22:00.160]  And we had a really, really cool thing, you know,
[22:00.160 --> 22:02.200]  in terms of kind of one of the things that Jake said
[22:02.200 --> 22:03.520]  is we had a great group.
[22:04.640 --> 22:08.400]  You know, I think that at times,
[22:08.400 --> 22:11.960]  ego's gotten away with us all and it's unfortunate,
[22:11.960 --> 22:14.120]  you know, and Sub's passing definitely taught me
[22:14.120 --> 22:16.520]  a lot of personal lessons because, you know,
[22:16.520 --> 22:19.720]  it was, there was shit that was said and left unsaid
[22:19.720 --> 22:21.840]  that, you know, I don't think either of us meant
[22:21.840 --> 22:24.840]  because deep down Sub was a fucking super solid person.
[22:24.840 --> 22:27.280]  And his mission was to literally, you know,
[22:27.280 --> 22:30.280]  share his information and pass along these genetics.
[22:30.280 --> 22:32.480]  And, you know, he definitely changed the game
[22:32.480 --> 22:36.760]  and, you know, I'm very appreciative, you know, to all that.
[22:36.760 --> 22:40.080]  And where the heroes of the farm kind of name came up
[22:40.080 --> 22:42.000]  is I had bought my farm now
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.600]  and it was a distressed piece of property,
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.400]  you know, tweaker zone, and I kept fixing it.
[22:45.400 --> 22:47.560]  And the original property owner, it was,
[22:47.560 --> 22:50.640]  his wife was like, oh, you guys are heroes of this farm.
[22:50.640 --> 22:54.160]  And I, Sub was up my ass about coming up with a name
[22:54.160 --> 22:55.840]  and I just threw it out there.
[22:55.840 --> 22:57.160]  And I kind of hated it at first
[22:58.040 --> 22:59.120]  because I didn't want people to think I had some ego
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.040]  because I'm definitely no hero.
[23:01.040 --> 23:03.960]  You know, I've had my ego and been beaten down
[23:03.960 --> 23:08.160]  time and time again by the lessons taught by this plant.
[23:08.160 --> 23:09.840]  But, you know, and eventually, you know,
[23:09.840 --> 23:12.400]  it's something that I feel is suiting and fittable
[23:12.400 --> 23:14.200]  for, you know, what we got going on.
[23:15.280 --> 23:16.920]  And that's kind of a little bit of a history
[23:16.920 --> 23:19.360]  of where I got started and how I got started,
[23:19.360 --> 23:21.560]  you know, with Sub and Dioxide and the team.
[23:22.560 --> 23:23.760]  Awesome.
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.040]  So Ray, you want to share every, you know,
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.640]  how you got started, you know, in the beginning?
[23:29.640 --> 23:32.280]  Because you're originally from Oregon, I think.
[23:32.280 --> 23:34.200]  I was born in Portland,
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.640]  lived in Battleground, Washington for a while.
[23:38.720 --> 23:40.560]  Or was it Shane born in Oregon?
[23:40.560 --> 23:42.520]  I always get you guys confused.
[23:42.520 --> 23:44.800]  I was born in Colorado, actually.
[23:44.800 --> 23:49.200]  I moved from Colorado to Oregon in 2003.
[23:49.200 --> 23:50.360]  Nice.
[23:50.680 --> 23:52.760]  I wound up meeting...
[23:52.760 --> 23:56.000]  My starting with TGA was through Dioxide.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.160]  Joel, I wound up meeting him.
[23:57.160 --> 23:59.640]  He was working at the local growth store.
[23:59.640 --> 24:02.680]  So I didn't know who he was or who TGA was
[24:02.680 --> 24:03.640]  or anything like that.
[24:03.640 --> 24:07.240]  We had did some crossing and made some crosses
[24:07.240 --> 24:10.440]  and was showing them off a little bit at the growth shop.
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.320]  And he's like, Joel's like,
[24:12.320 --> 24:14.840]  hey, do you mind if I take and show this to somebody?
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.840]  I'm like, no, absolutely.
[24:15.840 --> 24:17.720]  So I brought him in some nice buds the next day.
[24:17.880 --> 24:20.360]  And then he came back.
[24:20.360 --> 24:22.240]  He's like, wow, everybody's super impressed with that.
[24:22.240 --> 24:24.040]  And I'm like, cool, that's awesome.
[24:24.040 --> 24:28.200]  Then we threw it outside and it's a semi-autof...
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.640]  The Oregon diesel is a semi-autoflower
[24:30.640 --> 24:33.360]  that sets in pretty quick and early.
[24:33.360 --> 24:36.360]  So it was done September 1st.
[24:38.560 --> 24:41.400]  So he came out, Joel brought him out
[24:41.400 --> 24:44.800]  to do a video shoot, a photo shoot.
[24:44.800 --> 24:47.680]  And that's actually the first time that I had met Subcool.
[24:48.720 --> 24:50.640]  They came out to my house and did a shoot
[24:50.640 --> 24:55.360]  and we wound up being a cover and then we'd rolled,
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.640]  I forget which edition,
[24:56.640 --> 24:59.640]  but that was our first interaction was with that.
[25:00.560 --> 25:03.320]  From there on out, we just did some work with things
[25:03.320 --> 25:04.880]  and just stayed friends with Dioxide
[25:04.880 --> 25:06.400]  and talked with Sub and Miss Jill.
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.960]  And we wound up getting ahold of some seeds from Jamaica
[25:10.960 --> 25:12.760]  that everybody was kind of pretty excited about.
[25:12.760 --> 25:15.120]  So we did some work with those.
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.400]  Turns out that, yeah, the Jamaican is very,
[25:17.400 --> 25:19.080]  very outdoor plant.
[25:19.080 --> 25:21.640]  And when you bring it inside, it likes to herm.
[25:21.640 --> 25:24.280]  Outdoors, it does fine and does great,
[25:24.280 --> 25:26.480]  but indoors, yeah, not so much.
[25:26.480 --> 25:28.680]  The memory on it is fantastic.
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.600]  But the lineage and the crosses in it,
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.320]  if you do take the time to find one that doesn't herm,
[25:34.320 --> 25:35.680]  are fantastic.
[25:35.680 --> 25:37.880]  But either way, that line never went anywhere.
[25:37.880 --> 25:38.960]  So we did some other work.
[25:38.960 --> 25:41.840]  We found a male, my son Donovan found a male
[25:41.840 --> 25:44.560]  in the time rack that they were having us test.
[25:45.680 --> 25:47.560]  And was like, hey, let's do some breeding with this.
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.800]  So we talked with Joel and he's like,
[25:49.800 --> 25:51.400]  yeah, absolutely, please do.
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.360]  So we went ahead and did some crosses.
[25:55.520 --> 26:00.520]  The first ones were like Dr. Who, Mickey Cush,
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.400]  Sweet Irish Cush, or I mean, Quantum Cush,
[26:04.400 --> 26:06.440]  sorry, Sweet Irish is the mom.
[26:06.440 --> 26:07.280]  But yeah, either way.
[26:07.280 --> 26:09.440]  So we wound up doing a bunch of seeds
[26:09.440 --> 26:11.840]  and doing a lot of testing, like Pat said.
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.720]  Sub was huge about testing all over the place.
[26:15.360 --> 26:17.840]  We had to send out so many thousand for samples
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.240]  and testers and wait for words back
[26:20.240 --> 26:22.160]  before we do anything with it.
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.160]  So it was a time consuming task for sure.
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.680]  But yeah, so things went good with that.
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.240]  We moved on with the time rack male
[26:36.240 --> 26:37.600]  and made several crosses.
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.400]  They also gave us the JTR male
[26:40.400 --> 26:41.640]  that they were using for everything.
[26:41.640 --> 26:43.640]  And we did some lines with that as well.
[26:44.600 --> 26:47.320]  We wound up losing the JTR male.
[26:47.320 --> 26:49.720]  And so we didn't further those lines at all,
[26:49.720 --> 26:53.440]  but time rack, we did a few more things.
[26:53.440 --> 26:55.800]  And we also pulled a Dr. Who male
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.240]  and came out a few other things after that.
[26:58.240 --> 27:03.240]  But the comradery between the TGA group was fantastic.
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.320]  The first time I met Jinx was when he was doing
[27:06.320 --> 27:08.960]  his school of danks.
[27:08.960 --> 27:11.600]  Those were fun, fantastic, loved doing them.
[27:11.600 --> 27:12.800]  Can't wait to do more.
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.320]  But we did a couple of those.
[27:15.320 --> 27:16.680]  Yeah, there's your shirt.
[27:16.680 --> 27:19.640]  Yes, I still have my shirt in my closet.
[27:19.640 --> 27:21.440]  I treasure them, I don't wear them.
[27:21.440 --> 27:23.720]  I don't need that, just wear it for the show.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.040]  That's awesome.
[27:26.040 --> 27:28.480]  If I was in Oregon, I could do that,
[27:28.480 --> 27:30.000]  but I'm down in Cali nowadays.
[27:31.320 --> 27:34.040]  But yeah, other than that, I met Shane a few years back
[27:34.040 --> 27:36.480]  and he and I kind of pretty much hit it off right away.
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.040]  We were doing work for the Oregon legislation
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.880]  on breeding there for Oregon.
[27:44.120 --> 27:46.480]  Met him and we kind of hit it off quite well
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.600]  and started traveling to High Times Cups together.
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.400]  He came out to the Denver 2014, 2015,
[27:53.400 --> 27:54.920]  one of those two, the big one.
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.280]  And hung out and really enjoyed himself quite a bit.
[28:00.280 --> 28:01.160]  But we've been hanging out
[28:01.160 --> 28:03.000]  and working together ever since then.
[28:05.870 --> 28:06.710]  Awesome.
[28:08.950 --> 28:10.110]  Go ahead, Jinx.
[28:10.110 --> 28:12.350]  Oh yeah, so yeah, well, thank you for that.
[28:12.350 --> 28:14.630]  And then Shane, you wanted to talk about
[28:15.030 --> 28:17.430]  how you got your start with everything?
[28:17.430 --> 28:18.270]  Sure.
[28:18.270 --> 28:22.630]  So I got my start about 30 years ago when I was 16
[28:22.630 --> 28:25.150]  is when I grew my first plant.
[28:25.150 --> 28:26.950]  It was just some random seeds
[28:26.950 --> 28:30.070]  that I think I even pulled out of my mom's stash.
[28:30.070 --> 28:30.910]  My parents were hippie,
[28:30.910 --> 28:33.030]  so I kind of grew up around weed.
[28:33.030 --> 28:35.590]  When I was knee high, I remember everybody
[28:35.590 --> 28:38.830]  using paper plates to sift seeds from the weed and shit.
[28:38.830 --> 28:40.750]  Just in all those aromas in the air,
[28:40.750 --> 28:43.110]  it was just something that I just kind of grew up with
[28:43.110 --> 28:44.150]  and I liked.
[28:44.150 --> 28:46.470]  I started smoking pretty young.
[28:46.470 --> 28:49.150]  But the first plant I grew, it ended up being a male.
[28:49.150 --> 28:50.230]  My mom was laughing.
[28:50.230 --> 28:52.550]  She was like, oh, you're growing weed or whatever.
[28:52.550 --> 28:53.790]  That was my first plant.
[28:53.790 --> 28:54.630]  Of course it was a male.
[28:54.630 --> 28:58.230]  But after that, I just continued to want to learn
[28:58.230 --> 29:00.590]  how to grow weed and read it in high times
[29:00.590 --> 29:03.110]  and be inspired by the strains that were in there
[29:03.110 --> 29:05.110]  and the new things that are going on.
[29:05.110 --> 29:06.870]  And you look at Ed when he first came out
[29:06.870 --> 29:08.870]  with his lab coat and he kind of looked fancy
[29:08.870 --> 29:11.510]  and it was just as exciting time.
[29:12.350 --> 29:14.670]  At that point in time, I was doing a lot of little
[29:14.670 --> 29:16.550]  spotty outdoor grows by road tracks,
[29:16.550 --> 29:18.470]  wherever we can do it.
[29:18.470 --> 29:21.790]  Eventually I started working in a hemp shop.
[29:21.790 --> 29:25.910]  And during that time, I was getting treated
[29:25.910 --> 29:27.430]  kind of like a criminal because a hemp store,
[29:27.430 --> 29:28.590]  and of course you're selling weed,
[29:28.590 --> 29:30.110]  all the products are high THC.
[29:30.110 --> 29:32.510]  This is the 90s.
[29:32.510 --> 29:35.150]  And I was introduced to a friend.
[29:35.150 --> 29:38.470]  And then one night I ended up getting a phone call
[29:38.470 --> 29:39.870]  from Jack Hare.
[29:39.870 --> 29:41.590]  And Jack was on the phone.
[29:41.590 --> 29:42.830]  We were talking about hemp and all that.
[29:42.830 --> 29:45.550]  And he told me to stop getting treated like a criminal,
[29:45.550 --> 29:48.070]  stop selling hemp and his books and things
[29:48.070 --> 29:50.070]  and come get involved with medical marijuana.
[29:50.070 --> 29:54.590]  And that's when Prop 250 in California is being set up.
[29:54.590 --> 29:56.790]  But that was my original inspiration to really
[29:57.910 --> 30:00.110]  get out to the West Coast and just be a grower.
[30:00.110 --> 30:01.670]  So I ended up in Oregon.
[30:01.670 --> 30:04.030]  I was doing some little grows there
[30:04.030 --> 30:06.190]  and had a tight group of friends.
[30:06.190 --> 30:09.030]  And not too long after that is really when I met Sub.
[30:10.030 --> 30:11.790]  I never really thought about breeding
[30:11.790 --> 30:12.830]  up until that point in time.
[30:12.830 --> 30:15.270]  Sub was the person who really inspired me
[30:15.270 --> 30:18.150]  to make my own strains and using these cool genetics
[30:18.150 --> 30:19.470]  that we had at that point.
[30:21.150 --> 30:23.510]  That's kind of what started my fire with it.
[30:23.510 --> 30:27.550]  And ever since it's always been about how to make it better,
[30:27.550 --> 30:29.950]  how to do it better, how to do it bigger.
[30:29.950 --> 30:31.470]  Trying to take this to the next level.
[30:31.470 --> 30:34.110]  And that's to this day what I continue to try to do.
[30:35.110 --> 30:37.470]  I'm glad I'm on the right track.
[30:37.470 --> 30:38.670]  Good stuff.
[30:38.670 --> 30:42.270]  And as far as TGA, Sub had this knack
[30:42.270 --> 30:44.390]  of finding amazing people to work with
[30:44.390 --> 30:45.910]  and be part of the crew.
[30:45.910 --> 30:48.470]  And coming back, like Odie said,
[30:48.470 --> 30:51.470]  around 2015, I kind of resurfaced.
[30:51.470 --> 30:53.270]  I was hiding out and I was doing things.
[30:53.270 --> 30:56.510]  I was putting honey bees in some of the dispensaries
[30:56.510 --> 30:59.070]  in Portland and doing a couple of things.
[30:59.070 --> 31:01.070]  But they were all just like low key.
[31:01.070 --> 31:03.750]  And then I finally just decided to just man up
[31:04.390 --> 31:05.790]  and just kind of come back full circle
[31:05.790 --> 31:07.270]  and get back in the scene.
[31:07.270 --> 31:09.390]  And just me and everybody else,
[31:09.390 --> 31:11.270]  they'd become part of the TGA family.
[31:11.270 --> 31:12.750]  I mean, these people were all amazing.
[31:12.750 --> 31:13.910]  I was just blown away.
[31:14.830 --> 31:16.670]  I love people here.
[31:16.670 --> 31:18.670]  There are a lot of other people that are in this channel
[31:18.670 --> 31:22.270]  that are part of the team that, it's exceptional.
[31:22.270 --> 31:24.270]  And that's one thing that Sub really had.
[31:24.270 --> 31:25.550]  He had that passion.
[31:25.550 --> 31:27.270]  And he just kept on wanting to grow weed.
[31:27.270 --> 31:28.910]  He wanted to get seeds out there,
[31:29.750 --> 31:33.430]  teach people how to grow better cannabis, super soil,
[31:34.110 --> 31:35.230]  just drive it, make an army of people
[31:35.230 --> 31:37.990]  who are just growing weed and overgrowing the planet.
[31:37.990 --> 31:39.990]  And that's been his mission and his mission
[31:39.990 --> 31:41.710]  with Share With Me, and that's still my mission.
[31:41.710 --> 31:43.310]  Just keep on pushing.
[31:43.310 --> 31:45.310]  That's where we're going next.
[31:47.750 --> 31:48.590]  Awesome.
[31:49.670 --> 31:53.390]  So how do you guys feel about the Grateful Dead?
[31:53.390 --> 31:55.310]  I feel like as an industry,
[31:55.310 --> 31:56.870]  our whole industry has been affected
[31:56.870 --> 32:00.630]  and there's large contribution from the Grateful Dead.
[32:01.590 --> 32:03.750]  How has it impacted you guys growing up
[32:03.750 --> 32:05.190]  and also growing plants?
[32:05.190 --> 32:06.670]  You wanna start with that Shane?
[32:06.670 --> 32:09.030]  Yeah, I started going to dead shows,
[32:09.030 --> 32:11.150]  I think I was 13 when I kind of got introduced
[32:11.150 --> 32:12.630]  to that whole culture.
[32:12.630 --> 32:14.270]  Before that, I was looking through the records
[32:14.270 --> 32:15.590]  and my parents' collection.
[32:15.590 --> 32:17.150]  I always loved their album art.
[32:18.310 --> 32:20.190]  But after I started going to shows
[32:20.190 --> 32:22.590]  and then shortly around that time,
[32:22.590 --> 32:25.550]  that's when I got looking, seeking for that kind bud,
[32:25.550 --> 32:26.990]  always looking for that good weed.
[32:26.990 --> 32:29.310]  That's where I came across blueberry at that point in time.
[32:29.310 --> 32:30.390]  And that was a game changer.
[32:30.390 --> 32:33.390]  When the blueberry popped up on a lot of the Grateful Dead,
[32:34.550 --> 32:36.270]  the amazing weed back in the day,
[32:36.270 --> 32:37.590]  just those memories of it.
[32:38.910 --> 32:40.990]  Yeah, the Grateful Dead has always been an influence
[32:40.990 --> 32:42.270]  in my life and what I do.
[32:42.270 --> 32:45.310]  I have several strains that are named after dead songs,
[32:46.230 --> 32:48.310]  like Supplication and Smokestack Lightning
[32:48.310 --> 32:50.310]  and all kinds of weird things, as does Ray.
[32:50.310 --> 32:53.430]  And some of us, we definitely love the dead.
[32:54.630 --> 32:55.510]  Awesome.
[32:55.510 --> 32:57.310]  You wanna add anything to that, Ray?
[33:03.360 --> 33:04.680]  I think you might be muted.
[33:04.680 --> 33:05.960]  I think you might be muted.
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.680]  Yep, Ray, you're...
[33:07.680 --> 33:08.520]  Lower left.
[33:09.800 --> 33:12.680]  Unmute yourself, yeah, lower left.
[33:12.680 --> 33:14.480]  Tap on that audio icon.
[33:14.480 --> 33:16.320]  Gotcha, I think I got it.
[33:16.320 --> 33:17.360]  Can you hear me now?
[33:17.360 --> 33:18.200]  Yep.
[33:20.240 --> 33:25.240]  Yeah, no, it's just keep going and keep doing what we're doing.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.320]  I mean, everybody here is definitely a great crew of people.
[33:29.760 --> 33:32.440]  How about Grateful Dead impacting what you do?
[33:32.440 --> 33:33.280]  I know you listen to it.
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.560]  Well, yeah, we have a few strains
[33:37.200 --> 33:38.640]  about on the Grateful Dead.
[33:38.640 --> 33:41.000]  Catch a Grey was one of our first ones.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.080]  That was a Super Silver Haze cross,
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.480]  but either way, yeah, the Grateful Dead,
[33:46.480 --> 33:48.080]  I started going following them.
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.320]  I followed them 89 through 95.
[33:50.320 --> 33:52.360]  Last shows were in Vegas.
[33:52.360 --> 33:53.840]  It was such a fantastic time.
[33:53.840 --> 33:56.520]  Every time it was a traveling community
[33:56.560 --> 33:59.240]  and the love and commodity was fantastic.
[34:00.160 --> 34:03.120]  Met a lot of really cool people back in those days, for sure.
[34:03.120 --> 34:05.000]  It's great memories.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.360]  I think Pat does more of a fish head, to tell you the truth.
[34:08.360 --> 34:10.000]  I got Jerry on my body.
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.840]  I got him coming out of the Magic Hat and the Deadbolt.
[34:12.840 --> 34:17.840]  And I got this and after I did my next packaging with,
[34:21.800 --> 34:24.160]  after I kind of split ways with Sub
[34:24.320 --> 34:26.720]  inside my interior packaging gold foil,
[34:26.720 --> 34:29.080]  it was kind of a steely logo and said,
[34:29.080 --> 34:31.240]  one drop or seed could change your life.
[34:31.240 --> 34:33.360]  And I still find that to be true.
[34:33.360 --> 34:34.200]  Yeah.
[34:36.680 --> 34:39.480]  Jinx, you have anything to contribute to Grateful Dead?
[34:39.480 --> 34:41.520]  Were you a Grateful Dead fan?
[34:41.520 --> 34:43.320]  Honestly, I wasn't.
[34:43.320 --> 34:45.160]  I was a rocker as a kid.
[34:45.160 --> 34:48.960]  It was all about Zeppelin and Sabbath and ACDC.
[34:48.960 --> 34:52.760]  When I was about 14, my mom did take me to the movies.
[34:52.800 --> 34:55.480]  When I was 14, my mom did take me to see the Grateful Dead
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.360]  because my mom was a total hippie.
[34:57.360 --> 35:00.000]  Like my dad was like a biker, my mom was a hippie.
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.120]  And it was a cool show.
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.760]  I wanna say it was in the Cow Palace in San Francisco.
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.080]  And I couldn't tell you what tour it was.
[35:08.080 --> 35:10.280]  Like I said, I was probably 14,
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.880]  back when you could still buy a sleeveless concert shirts.
[35:15.760 --> 35:16.960]  I had one, it was purple.
[35:16.960 --> 35:18.000]  I can't remember what was on it,
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.560]  but I definitely had a good time.
[35:20.600 --> 35:25.040]  I was never the kind of guy to put on a Grateful Dead record
[35:25.040 --> 35:25.960]  or anything like that.
[35:25.960 --> 35:27.840]  It's just, I don't know.
[35:27.840 --> 35:31.360]  I just never really had friends that were into it
[35:31.360 --> 35:32.240]  or stuff like that.
[35:32.240 --> 35:34.360]  My dad, mostly grew up with my dad.
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.000]  He was more of a credence, Janis Joplin kind of guy.
[35:40.480 --> 35:41.800]  Wasn't a lot of exposure to it.
[35:41.800 --> 35:44.200]  Definitely got mad respect for them and stuff.
[35:44.200 --> 35:46.800]  Has it influenced my work or anything like that?
[35:46.800 --> 35:48.640]  No, definitely not.
[35:48.680 --> 35:50.640]  Would I name a strain after them?
[35:50.640 --> 35:52.800]  Probably not, because if I did, it would be fake.
[35:52.800 --> 35:53.640]  You know what I mean?
[35:53.640 --> 35:57.200]  So I did recently come out with a limited edition.
[35:57.200 --> 35:58.600]  I called it Ride On.
[35:58.600 --> 36:01.760]  It was just like, I just came from a show in Oklahoma.
[36:01.760 --> 36:03.520]  And if you like bought two packs of seed,
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.160]  you got these packs of seeds for free.
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.640]  And they were definitely named
[36:06.640 --> 36:09.000]  after the ACDC song, Ride On.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.840]  So that's probably,
[36:10.840 --> 36:12.600]  I have a few strains that are hard to find
[36:12.600 --> 36:14.320]  and they were named after Andrew Wood,
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.960]  who was the singer of Mother Love Bone,
[36:17.560 --> 36:19.520]  who passed away and then they became Pearl Jam.
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.480]  So I was a pretty big Andrew Wood fan,
[36:22.480 --> 36:23.640]  just the whole Seattle thing.
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.800]  But the Grateful Dead thing, like I said,
[36:25.800 --> 36:27.200]  I mean, mad respect.
[36:27.200 --> 36:28.040]  I've seen them.
[36:28.040 --> 36:30.520]  It's just, I never really,
[36:30.520 --> 36:33.360]  this never really grabbed me like it does so many people.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.440]  I remember one of the first times I took acid as a kid,
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.000]  it was all about Pink Floyd.
[36:42.880 --> 36:45.280]  And I wasn't a huge Pink Floyd fan either.
[36:45.320 --> 36:47.400]  And we're sitting around and we're all just,
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.880]  we called it frying.
[36:48.880 --> 36:50.320]  You know, we're all just frying.
[36:50.320 --> 36:51.680]  And someone was like, put on some music.
[36:51.680 --> 36:54.200]  And someone put on like a heavy metal album or something.
[36:54.200 --> 36:56.120]  And it sounded so bad.
[36:56.120 --> 36:57.480]  It was like these guys were trapped
[36:57.480 --> 36:59.800]  in this little tin can or just,
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.080]  cause everything's so different.
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.960]  And someone was like, put on Pink Floyd.
[37:02.960 --> 37:05.520]  And it was like, you know, like Uma Guma or metal,
[37:05.520 --> 37:06.560]  one of those old records.
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.280]  And we were like, nah, nah.
[37:08.280 --> 37:10.160]  And then the second they put that on,
[37:11.360 --> 37:12.840]  we were just like,
[37:12.840 --> 37:15.200]  we were just tripping, tripping.
[37:15.200 --> 37:16.600]  You know, I never tripped.
[37:16.600 --> 37:17.920]  I mean, all the visuals and stuff,
[37:17.920 --> 37:18.880]  like I said, as a kid, you know,
[37:18.880 --> 37:20.240]  all that with the acid and stuff,
[37:20.240 --> 37:23.880]  but I'd never straight just tripped on music like that.
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.480]  You know, like it was just straight in the,
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.400]  you could practically see it, you know what I mean?
[37:27.400 --> 37:30.720]  So I guess for me, it was a little more, you know,
[37:30.720 --> 37:32.600]  as far as the psychedelic and stuff like that,
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.800]  it was a little more along the Pink Floyd lines.
[37:34.800 --> 37:38.240]  So just grateful that I just never really,
[37:38.240 --> 37:39.720]  like I said, I'm not against them or don't like them
[37:39.720 --> 37:42.480]  or anything, it just never really entered my life hard
[37:43.120 --> 37:45.440]  or anything like that, even though I have seen them.
[37:45.440 --> 37:47.760]  So that's about it.
[37:48.720 --> 37:49.560]  Awesome.
[37:49.560 --> 37:51.120]  Yeah, I think a lot of people came for the drugs
[37:51.120 --> 37:53.560]  and stayed for the music and vice versa.
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.560]  Jill, I know there's been some impact in your life
[37:58.560 --> 37:59.720]  with the Grateful Dead.
[38:00.680 --> 38:03.200]  Actually, I'm right on line with Jinx on that.
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.480]  I enjoy them, but I'm not a deadhead at all.
[38:08.480 --> 38:09.840]  More into the old rock
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.000]  and definitely it would be a Pink Floyd
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.640]  if I was tripping a little bit, so.
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.920]  Awesome.
[38:17.920 --> 38:19.480]  Excellent.
[38:19.480 --> 38:23.000]  So let's talk about fruit forward varieties of cannabis.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.160]  And I feel like you guys were the first seed company
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.040]  to consistently breed like fruit forward and dessert turps,
[38:30.040 --> 38:32.040]  you know, real turpy sweet stuff
[38:32.040 --> 38:35.720]  before anybody else really bred it
[38:35.720 --> 38:37.200]  as a seed company, at least.
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.280]  I mean, there was like Calio from the late 80s and 90s.
[38:41.280 --> 38:42.520]  I got to try that in the 90s.
[38:42.520 --> 38:43.960]  That was the first time I tried anything
[38:43.960 --> 38:45.800]  with real bright orange turps.
[38:47.280 --> 38:49.200]  You know, I guess we could start with Jill.
[38:49.200 --> 38:50.680]  How do you feel about fruit forward
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.600]  and how did that kind of evolve in the beginning?
[38:54.600 --> 38:57.520]  Well, our main male is a Space Queen
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.440]  and that's very cherry flavored.
[38:59.440 --> 39:04.240]  And I had the Orange Velvet, very, very orange.
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.120]  And actually Orange Velvet is one of the base
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.600]  orange strains behind many of the orange strains
[39:10.600 --> 39:12.160]  available on the market.
[39:12.160 --> 39:15.600]  Originally I had made an OVBX
[39:15.600 --> 39:18.080]  and I believe that Crockett had used that
[39:18.080 --> 39:20.600]  as the mother of Tangy originally.
[39:20.600 --> 39:23.720]  So that's where our flavors came in
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.040]  was the orange and the cherry.
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.600]  And then we, ouch, my cat just bit me.
[39:30.600 --> 39:33.720]  Then we started with, we got some great flavors in there
[39:34.160 --> 39:35.040]  and we went from there.
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.160]  And of course, like we were talking about Dioxide earlier,
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.760]  he was one of the main breeders with TGA.
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.960]  He made a strain called Chernobyl.
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.640]  And during his testing phase, he had some seeds
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.200]  and he had given those to Danny from Uplifted Farms.
[39:53.200 --> 39:55.880]  Danny grew those out and he found a phenotype
[39:55.880 --> 39:58.480]  that he named the Golden Ticket.
[39:58.480 --> 40:00.000]  Later it got passed around
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.120]  and by Pome the Grower was renamed Slimer.
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.320]  So that was one of our lime flavors.
[40:07.320 --> 40:10.880]  So we have quite a few different flavors,
[40:10.880 --> 40:13.320]  fruit flavors in the TGA family.
[40:13.320 --> 40:16.680]  And I am bringing back a lot of those in my Jillybean line.
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.680]  I have a Jillybean Black Cherry
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.720]  and Jillybean Grape, a Jillybean Lime.
[40:22.720 --> 40:25.600]  And I have several more new ones coming out
[40:25.600 --> 40:27.240]  along that fruit line as well.
[40:28.240 --> 40:30.920]  So Ray, what do you feel about Fruit Forward?
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.000]  I know you're a big fan of it with your Dr. Who
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.120]  and some of those phenos that kind of went both
[40:37.120 --> 40:38.880]  in that kind of funky direction
[40:38.880 --> 40:42.800]  and also in that like a sweet candy direction.
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.600]  Yeah, I know I'm a big fan and smoking strains
[40:47.600 --> 40:49.560]  that when you walk back into the room an hour later,
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.360]  you're like, wow, that smells fantastic.
[40:52.360 --> 40:54.720]  And I found that in a lot of the fruit strains.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.080]  When I first started working with them though,
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.680]  there wasn't much potency to them.
[40:59.680 --> 41:02.000]  So that was one of the things we really had to work on
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.200]  was bringing potency into colors and fruit flavors,
[41:07.360 --> 41:09.120]  which wasn't that difficult.
[41:09.120 --> 41:12.920]  But yeah, fruit flavors are fantastic.
[41:12.920 --> 41:16.080]  I wanted to do dessert limes forever.
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.120]  And that really just made a great fit for the whole TGA team
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.000]  because we all kind of really like those Fruit Forward limes
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.320]  as you call them for sure.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.640]  Yeah, Shane, you wanna add anything to that?
[41:30.640 --> 41:33.840]  Yeah, in the original days that was subs goal
[41:33.840 --> 41:37.000]  and the goal of TGA was just to have a menu
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.840]  full of all these beautiful turp varieties,
[41:39.840 --> 41:42.160]  whether it was lemons or strawberries, cherries,
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.240]  I mean, that was the goal.
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.080]  Back then there really wasn't gas
[41:45.080 --> 41:48.520]  and that kind of evolved shortly after.
[41:48.520 --> 41:51.000]  That really wasn't something that was in our arsenal
[41:51.280 --> 41:53.960]  were the gas strains that we refer to these days.
[41:53.960 --> 41:56.320]  I used to call that narcotic back in the day,
[41:56.320 --> 41:57.200]  just because it always,
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.640]  you knew it was gonna get you ripped
[41:58.640 --> 42:01.000]  and it just did something to your mind.
[42:02.440 --> 42:04.920]  And it really wasn't until like the mid 2000s
[42:04.920 --> 42:07.760]  that I got introduced to some of the gas strains.
[42:07.760 --> 42:10.880]  But no, it's always been about terpenes and to this day,
[42:10.880 --> 42:12.840]  I wanna be able to open that jar.
[42:12.840 --> 42:14.880]  I want somebody 30 feet over that way
[42:14.880 --> 42:17.360]  to kind of get that whiff and be like, what the hell is that?
[42:17.360 --> 42:19.160]  And then I wanted to transfer to that palette
[42:19.160 --> 42:20.280]  and that's something that we all love
[42:20.560 --> 42:21.840]  to share those just beautiful varieties
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.840]  that are very flavorful and turps rule the world, man.
[42:26.880 --> 42:27.800]  They're good stuff.
[42:29.200 --> 42:32.360]  Yeah, so Pat, you have a bunch of diverse genetics
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.960]  that you've worked with over the years.
[42:33.960 --> 42:35.160]  How do you feel about fruit
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.720]  and then evolving into kind of what you're doing now?
[42:37.720 --> 42:39.280]  You know, it's kind of like what Shane said.
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.080]  I mean, so it was original goal and kind of not an argument,
[42:43.080 --> 42:45.360]  but always the discussion of topic that we had was,
[42:45.360 --> 42:47.320]  he was all about the fruit and he really,
[42:47.320 --> 42:48.400]  at the time we had started that,
[42:48.400 --> 42:50.400]  I had started kind of working with gas.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.280]  He wasn't about the gas.
[42:52.280 --> 42:55.720]  You know, it's my personal flavor palette.
[42:55.720 --> 42:57.400]  You know, one of my other really good friends
[42:57.400 --> 42:59.520]  that bred dog walker, you know,
[42:59.520 --> 43:02.080]  anything that that thing touched or we touched with it,
[43:02.080 --> 43:03.080]  you know, it would really,
[43:03.080 --> 43:05.640]  it would just jump our numbers way up.
[43:05.640 --> 43:08.640]  So, you know, once I kind of got over, you know,
[43:08.640 --> 43:10.520]  the fruit forward phase,
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.080]  my goal was to take a lot of those fruity genetics,
[43:13.080 --> 43:15.760]  capture the look, some of the turp profile,
[43:15.800 --> 43:19.200]  get the numbers up, but bring that gas into it.
[43:19.200 --> 43:20.600]  So that's really when I started working
[43:20.600 --> 43:24.360]  with the Scooby snacks and started kind of, you know,
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.160]  the way it was created, it was on an accident.
[43:26.160 --> 43:27.520]  So there was no mail of it.
[43:27.520 --> 43:31.040]  So then I basically took the time wreck
[43:31.040 --> 43:32.920]  and then I crossed that with Girl Scout cookies,
[43:32.920 --> 43:35.680]  the same Girl Scout cookies that went into the dog walker
[43:35.680 --> 43:37.080]  to make the Scooby.
[43:37.080 --> 43:40.240]  And then I made Mystery Machine, then Guinness.
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.960]  And once I had that Guinness, anything I touched with that,
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.040]  it really just, it kind of project that Scooby in the gas,
[43:47.040 --> 43:50.080]  got all my numbers up and just really added
[43:50.080 --> 43:53.320]  something very unique to what we had going on.
[43:53.320 --> 43:57.240]  You know, personally, the fruit stuff, I love it,
[43:57.240 --> 43:59.200]  but it just doesn't get me high.
[43:59.200 --> 44:00.240]  I smoke way too much weed.
[44:00.240 --> 44:03.720]  So I do like a little bit more of the narcotic,
[44:03.720 --> 44:04.840]  as Shane would say.
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.800]  So, you know, definitely I love all the fruit stuff
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.800]  and my early lineage, you know, with Galactic Jack,
[44:12.840 --> 44:15.960]  Mary and Barry, you know, Mary and Barry eventually
[44:15.960 --> 44:17.080]  is what went into Skittles.
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.600]  Again, you know, people love to rename shit.
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.360]  AKA Head Dog is now the Flawn.
[44:22.360 --> 44:24.200]  You know, once things get out,
[44:24.200 --> 44:26.360]  they always morph into other people's stuff, which is cool.
[44:26.360 --> 44:28.720]  It used to piss me off, but it's humbling now.
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.400]  You know, I'm definitely more of a gas person,
[44:33.400 --> 44:35.280]  but you know, you've got to take
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.000]  all these different cultivars to make and create new things.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.880]  You know, I just think it's what you hunt.
[44:41.040 --> 44:43.600]  My biggest passion over the last couple of years
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.160]  is just mass scale hunting.
[44:45.160 --> 44:48.320]  And that's what recreational has done for a lot of us
[44:48.320 --> 44:49.960]  and working with myself.
[44:49.960 --> 44:52.720]  And I know these guys have worked with Jord.
[44:52.720 --> 44:56.360]  We've been able to hunt over the last five years at a scale
[44:56.360 --> 44:58.600]  that has really allowed us to find
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.000]  more elite, unique genetics.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.400]  And then with, you know, I know all of us
[45:03.400 --> 45:05.160]  where we started, we're definitely more old school,
[45:05.160 --> 45:06.760]  you know, stem rub.
[45:06.760 --> 45:09.600]  You know, I remember when testing first came out
[45:09.600 --> 45:11.280]  and I brought a list of testing,
[45:11.280 --> 45:15.920]  I think it was to the 2012 San Francisco cup.
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.320]  And, you know, Sub was blown away
[45:17.320 --> 45:20.560]  about all the information we had from Pat Marshall's lab,
[45:21.360 --> 45:23.040]  you know, Sunrise Analytical.
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.040]  And, you know, that was really the kind of the 2011, 12 era
[45:27.040 --> 45:29.680]  where I started going to a completely different direction
[45:29.680 --> 45:30.760]  in terms of that.
[45:31.640 --> 45:33.800]  But it was one of those things that once Sub
[45:33.800 --> 45:35.120]  saw kind of what I was doing,
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.360]  he actually kind of pushed me in that direction.
[45:38.360 --> 45:40.000]  But originally, like Shane said, you know,
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.320]  the fruit forward was definitely really the goal of his
[45:43.320 --> 45:46.320]  and, you know, us working for him and with him,
[45:46.320 --> 45:48.760]  you know, we all kind of tried to, you know,
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.440]  create what he was looking for so we could be distributed.
[45:52.440 --> 45:54.960]  But definitely the way that that man could describe,
[45:54.960 --> 45:57.640]  you describe something, you know, he'd smell something
[45:57.640 --> 45:59.640]  and, oh, cherries and this and that.
[45:59.640 --> 46:02.520]  It was always cool to see him dissect something
[46:02.520 --> 46:04.360]  with his passion.
[46:04.360 --> 46:05.200]  Awesome.
[46:05.200 --> 46:07.720]  Hey, so we got a question from one of the viewers
[46:08.080 --> 46:10.560]  that asked, Pat, did you cross the space dude
[46:10.560 --> 46:13.240]  to the GSC a couple of years ago?
[46:13.240 --> 46:14.960]  Yeah, yep.
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.520]  That was one of the ones that I gave out as freebies.
[46:17.520 --> 46:19.240]  It was a one and done.
[46:19.240 --> 46:21.040]  It was the same Girl Scout cookies
[46:21.040 --> 46:23.440]  that went into Scooby snacks.
[46:23.440 --> 46:26.080]  The same one that went into Girl Time.
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.000]  I don't even know if there was ever a name for it,
[46:30.240 --> 46:32.000]  you know, but yes, I did.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.520]  Awesome.
[46:33.520 --> 46:36.080]  So Jinx, you wanna talk a little about Fruit Forward
[46:36.080 --> 46:39.640]  and kind of how it's evolved over time with you?
[46:39.640 --> 46:41.880]  Yeah, for me, I've always enjoyed it,
[46:41.880 --> 46:46.440]  except for I've never been a huge fan of the lemon bud,
[46:46.440 --> 46:48.800]  which seems to be so popular.
[46:48.800 --> 46:51.520]  I mean, I'm kind of a guy that gets like that
[46:51.520 --> 46:53.760]  with anything anyways, when something gets popular,
[46:53.760 --> 46:55.720]  I'm like, eh, you know, like I'm over it.
[46:55.720 --> 46:57.680]  And, you know, there's some great strains, obviously,
[46:57.680 --> 47:00.240]  that are just so lemon dominant,
[47:00.240 --> 47:02.160]  but to me, it's just not that special.
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.320]  For me, with my strains on the hammer,
[47:05.320 --> 47:07.320]  if you get the goo berry side,
[47:07.320 --> 47:09.920]  I mean, it's just straight berries, no doubt about it.
[47:09.920 --> 47:13.840]  I mean, there's several phenols of the hammer,
[47:13.840 --> 47:15.000]  of all the strains I've ever done,
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.840]  it probably has the most phenols.
[47:17.840 --> 47:20.080]  If you get the Jesus OG Don one,
[47:20.080 --> 47:22.200]  it's definitely not fruit at all, you know,
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.720]  but I always kind of joke with the goo berry from the hammer
[47:26.720 --> 47:29.520]  that I did, I also did Jesus OG
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.400]  when I created my mother tongue,
[47:31.400 --> 47:34.960]  which had the electric watermelon in it.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.160]  And the electric watermelon and the goo berry,
[47:38.160 --> 47:40.160]  or the berry goo berry dominant,
[47:40.160 --> 47:43.760]  I would smoke those strains if they didn't get you high,
[47:43.760 --> 47:45.600]  because they're just so fun to smoke,
[47:45.600 --> 47:47.480]  it's just like, you just can't believe it, you know,
[47:47.480 --> 47:50.440]  it's like smoking a piece of candy or something, you know,
[47:50.440 --> 47:53.520]  but the goo berry is a Afghani dom,
[47:53.520 --> 47:56.320]  so it does get you plenty stone, you know,
[47:56.320 --> 47:57.600]  and same with the mother tongue.
[47:57.600 --> 48:01.320]  The mother tongue, I love some of the feedback I get,
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.960]  because it's so silly if they get the watermelon dominant,
[48:05.640 --> 48:06.480]  I get somebody write me like,
[48:06.480 --> 48:08.600]  I feel like somebody just slapped me in the face
[48:08.600 --> 48:10.280]  with a piece of watermelon.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.720]  Some of the replies are just so funny and stuff like that.
[48:14.720 --> 48:17.760]  So I definitely, I enjoy the fruit stuff,
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.560]  but I also enjoy the dinky, you know, gassy stuff.
[48:21.560 --> 48:24.760]  It seemed for a while, for a minute there,
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.200]  all the baked goods took over, you know,
[48:28.200 --> 48:29.800]  once the cookies came in,
[48:29.800 --> 48:31.800]  and all the strains are named after baked goods
[48:31.800 --> 48:34.120]  or different kinds of cookies and stuff like that,
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.680]  which, you know, I've incorporated some of that stuff,
[48:36.680 --> 48:38.280]  but it's not really my deal.
[48:38.280 --> 48:40.200]  I'm definitely more of the dinky, gassy,
[48:40.200 --> 48:43.360]  or on the fruit side things are my favorites.
[48:45.600 --> 48:47.240]  Pat touched on the testing too,
[48:47.240 --> 48:50.520]  which was a big deal with sub two,
[48:50.520 --> 48:55.080]  and I've seen some companies throw up pages,
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.360]  like I'm taking these down and these will, you know,
[48:57.360 --> 48:58.880]  I'll be available soon,
[48:58.880 --> 49:01.400]  and then the seeds will be available in like two weeks.
[49:01.400 --> 49:03.880]  I'm just like, there's no way those were tested,
[49:04.640 --> 49:05.480]  you know what I mean?
[49:05.480 --> 49:07.360]  You know, especially with the power of social media,
[49:07.360 --> 49:09.360]  it takes so much, it'll make you break you,
[49:09.360 --> 49:10.200]  you know what I mean?
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.440]  So it's testing is extremely important.
[49:12.440 --> 49:14.160]  400 strains a year.
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:15.320 --> 49:16.400]  I mean, you know, like I say,
[49:16.400 --> 49:17.920]  there's no way they're ready in two weeks.
[49:17.920 --> 49:20.920]  So I test myself,
[49:20.920 --> 49:22.840]  but I also like to get other people to test,
[49:22.840 --> 49:25.800]  and I like to, I usually get about eight to 10 people
[49:25.800 --> 49:26.720]  to test the strains.
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.200]  Sometimes there are people I don't even know
[49:28.200 --> 49:30.040]  from social media,
[49:30.040 --> 49:31.760]  and we're having a problem doing that
[49:31.760 --> 49:33.280]  because these people, if you're a tester,
[49:33.720 --> 49:34.680]  you get free seeds,
[49:34.680 --> 49:36.680]  but then you'd never hear from them again.
[49:36.680 --> 49:38.880]  You know, so now Rose Incorporated, this thing,
[49:38.880 --> 49:41.000]  if you're a tester, we don't know,
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.960]  you don't know what you're growing until you're done.
[49:43.960 --> 49:46.880]  And you followed your obligations on being a tester,
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.080]  pictures, description, you know, how it grows,
[49:50.080 --> 49:52.680]  problems, pluses, minuses, stuff like that,
[49:52.680 --> 49:54.640]  which was a pretty good idea of her,
[49:54.640 --> 49:56.080]  because obviously everybody wants to know
[49:56.080 --> 49:57.600]  what they're growing, you know?
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.520]  And when I pick my testers,
[49:59.520 --> 50:02.560]  I pick some of the best growers I know,
[50:02.560 --> 50:05.640]  but I also pick a couple of the worst growers I know,
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.640]  and I take the feedback of the worst growers more serious.
[50:09.640 --> 50:13.840]  Like if this guy, you know, can get this strain eight weeks,
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.360]  no nanners, great turps, and it's chronic,
[50:16.360 --> 50:18.440]  then, you know, you got a good strain there,
[50:18.440 --> 50:21.120]  you know, compared to somebody like Pat or Odie
[50:21.120 --> 50:23.160]  who totally knows the science and, you know,
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.640]  can solve a problem instantly or see it coming
[50:25.640 --> 50:26.800]  or, you know, something like that.
[50:26.800 --> 50:28.800]  So we kind of do it like that.
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.640]  You know, like I said, I almost value the, you know,
[50:33.640 --> 50:37.360]  info from the not so great growers more, you know, so.
[50:39.240 --> 50:40.080]  Awesome.
[50:40.080 --> 50:42.200]  So as far as high times,
[50:42.200 --> 50:44.640]  because I know you've won a handful of cups,
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.960]  how do you feel like the cups have influenced
[50:46.960 --> 50:51.400]  or impacted you as far as the industry goes?
[50:51.400 --> 50:53.240]  I have personally never won a cup.
[50:53.240 --> 50:54.400]  My strains have.
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.240]  You have, well, yeah.
[50:55.240 --> 50:57.600]  But I've never actually won a cup, to tell you the truth.
[50:57.640 --> 50:59.440]  I've never even entered a cup, to tell you the truth.
[50:59.440 --> 51:00.720]  It's just not my deal.
[51:02.040 --> 51:04.400]  You know, when the Hammer won,
[51:04.400 --> 51:08.840]  it definitely made a big impact, positive and negative.
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.840]  You know, I mean, it's a huge community.
[51:10.840 --> 51:12.200]  So it brought on a few haters,
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.680]  but it definitely, you know, boosted sales
[51:14.680 --> 51:16.680]  and made people realize more what it was
[51:16.680 --> 51:19.320]  and were asking me about it and stuff like that.
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.400]  So it's definitely not a bad thing.
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.960]  You know, there's a few other guys
[51:22.960 --> 51:25.480]  that won smaller cups with a few of my strains,
[51:25.480 --> 51:26.760]  not like the High Times Cup.
[51:26.760 --> 51:29.720]  The Hammer won the High Times Cup in Michigan
[51:29.720 --> 51:30.720]  and it was pretty big deal.
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.640]  It was pretty funny because I was in my booth
[51:32.640 --> 51:35.240]  and people kept coming by and congratulating me.
[51:35.240 --> 51:37.360]  And I never go to the award ceremonies.
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.720]  Sometimes I find them a little long and drawn out,
[51:39.720 --> 51:41.160]  even a little boring.
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.800]  And plus I'm not in my booth, you know what I mean?
[51:43.800 --> 51:46.720]  So I was just like, what are these people talking about?
[51:46.720 --> 51:49.040]  Congratulations, Jason.
[51:49.040 --> 51:51.880]  Some guy comes up to me with a bottle of his Hammer
[51:51.880 --> 51:53.400]  and his first place trophy.
[51:53.400 --> 51:55.440]  And I was like, oh, okay, here we go.
[51:55.440 --> 51:58.680]  So it's kind of funny, but you know,
[51:58.680 --> 52:00.440]  I have mixed emotions about the cups.
[52:00.440 --> 52:01.880]  You know, some of them I think are pretty cool.
[52:01.880 --> 52:04.040]  I was at a house one time
[52:04.040 --> 52:06.160]  and all three of these guys were judges
[52:07.400 --> 52:10.880]  and they sat down right then and there
[52:10.880 --> 52:12.280]  and smoked all the weeds.
[52:12.280 --> 52:14.440]  Like they're supposed to be judging all week long
[52:14.440 --> 52:16.680]  but they'd been doing shit and playing around, you know?
[52:16.680 --> 52:20.200]  So they literally sat down and smoked like 30 kinds of weed.
[52:20.200 --> 52:22.040]  I was like, how can that, you know,
[52:22.040 --> 52:23.560]  how could you judge anything, you know,
[52:23.560 --> 52:25.280]  aside from maybe flavor, you know?
[52:26.120 --> 52:26.960]  So, yeah.
[52:26.960 --> 52:28.680]  That one got me really high.
[52:28.680 --> 52:33.680]  Yeah, that last one, you know, 30th bong, it fucking killed me.
[52:33.680 --> 52:38.080]  So, you know, it's kind of funny how it works
[52:38.080 --> 52:39.840]  or who organizes it, you know?
[52:42.880 --> 52:44.840]  With competition, you always invite
[52:44.840 --> 52:48.200]  a certain unwelcome attitude too, you know?
[52:48.200 --> 52:50.560]  Because, you know, for me, it's not about competition.
[52:50.560 --> 52:52.240]  It's just about creating some great product
[52:52.240 --> 52:55.440]  and being able to, you know, high five each other
[52:55.440 --> 52:56.280]  and stuff like that
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.440]  without being competitive towards each other, you know?
[52:59.440 --> 53:02.480]  So just like Jill O'Brieffer once said in school,
[53:02.480 --> 53:05.800]  how about more art and theater instead of sports, you know?
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.400]  So I kind of look at it like that.
[53:07.400 --> 53:09.680]  So, you know, I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do
[53:09.680 --> 53:12.200]  and the competitions are what bring people to the cups
[53:12.200 --> 53:13.040]  and stuff like that.
[53:13.040 --> 53:15.880]  But like I said, amongst a tight circle of growers,
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.120]  because, you know, not just TGF,
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.880]  I've made some great friends that are breeders
[53:18.880 --> 53:20.240]  and, you know, in companies like that.
[53:20.240 --> 53:23.720]  I feel no need to compete with them, you know?
[53:23.720 --> 53:24.560]  So.
[53:25.960 --> 53:26.800]  That's kind of where-
[53:26.800 --> 53:29.680]  Jill, you wanna add anything to that, Jill?
[53:29.680 --> 53:32.640]  I have not personally entered any cups either,
[53:32.640 --> 53:37.560]  but Jilly Bean has won very many placings in high times
[53:37.560 --> 53:39.160]  as well as other cups as well.
[53:40.840 --> 53:41.680]  Yeah.
[53:41.680 --> 53:44.320]  So that's helped quite a lot, you know?
[53:44.320 --> 53:46.520]  It's getting the name out there.
[53:48.320 --> 53:49.160]  What's that?
[53:49.160 --> 53:50.920]  It definitely helps sales, I'm sure.
[53:50.920 --> 53:51.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[53:53.440 --> 53:54.280]  Excellent.
[53:54.280 --> 53:56.080]  Anyone else wanna add anything to that?
[53:57.200 --> 53:58.680]  What was the first cup?
[53:58.680 --> 54:00.880]  Was that God's Pussy or the Vortex?
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.040]  That was God's Pussy.
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.680]  Yeah, the terror.
[54:05.320 --> 54:07.000]  Shout out to God's Pussy, right?
[54:08.440 --> 54:09.440]  Nice name.
[54:09.440 --> 54:11.120]  Yeah, no, he did it.
[54:11.120 --> 54:13.280]  Again, another remake.
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.520]  Frenchie Cannoli called me out
[54:15.520 --> 54:17.440]  because I have a strain called Cookie Puss
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.480]  and he thought, you know, which there are a few,
[54:19.480 --> 54:20.640]  there's one company out there
[54:20.640 --> 54:23.960]  really uses some very vulgar names for their strains.
[54:23.960 --> 54:25.080]  You probably all know who they are.
[54:25.080 --> 54:26.000]  I'm not gonna call them out,
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.320]  but I mean like pretty vulgar strains.
[54:29.400 --> 54:32.640]  Frenchie Cannoli once called me out about the Cookie Puss
[54:32.640 --> 54:34.880]  and it's Cookies Times Cat Piss,
[54:34.880 --> 54:36.440]  which is where the name comes from.
[54:36.440 --> 54:38.640]  But also Miss Rose grew up on the East Coast
[54:38.640 --> 54:41.920]  and out there there's a cake store called Carvels
[54:41.920 --> 54:43.200]  and they have an ice cream cake
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.960]  and it's called a Cookie Puss.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.120]  And on the East Coast,
[54:46.120 --> 54:47.600]  they refer to your face as your puss.
[54:47.600 --> 54:50.480]  Like you've all heard the expression sour puss.
[54:50.480 --> 54:52.480]  Like what's up sour puss?
[54:52.480 --> 54:53.320]  And that's where the name,
[54:53.320 --> 54:57.400]  it has nothing to do with female genitalia.
[54:57.400 --> 54:59.840]  It has to do with a little bit of Rose's history
[54:59.840 --> 55:03.000]  being from Jersey and the combination of the name
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.160]  and stuff like that.
[55:04.160 --> 55:06.080]  So kind of funny.
[55:06.080 --> 55:08.640]  I would say, you know, in terms of cups,
[55:09.800 --> 55:11.720]  cups are kind of what gave me when I was,
[55:11.720 --> 55:15.040]  I went to the 20th Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.320]  and I was I think 22 or three
[55:18.320 --> 55:21.680]  and I saved up a bunch of money and traveled to Europe
[55:21.680 --> 55:24.160]  and I got to see DNA come in
[55:24.160 --> 55:27.160]  and they had the gray area and the LA Confidential
[55:27.160 --> 55:30.720]  and it was really the year that DNA won their first cup.
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.080]  And I remember going around Europe and being like,
[55:34.080 --> 55:37.560]  I bought the Cannabis High Times judges pack
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.960]  and all they gave you is a fucking pamphlet
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.320]  to go to 21 different series.
[55:42.320 --> 55:43.440]  And I went to all of them.
[55:43.440 --> 55:46.680]  And I think I spent like $3,000, $3,500
[55:46.680 --> 55:48.760]  buying every single entry.
[55:48.760 --> 55:50.480]  And by the end of it, I was just like,
[55:50.480 --> 55:52.400]  a lot of this shit is trash.
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.680]  And as a young kid with an ego, I was like,
[55:54.680 --> 55:57.680]  I'm gonna go home and I can do better than this.
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.280]  And, you know, so, you know, cups definitely kind of,
[56:01.280 --> 56:03.800]  at a time I look at them kind of like social media.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.200]  When I first started going to them,
[56:05.200 --> 56:06.840]  I thought it was awesome.
[56:06.840 --> 56:09.320]  And then, you know, 12 years into it,
[56:09.320 --> 56:10.800]  I just realized that a lot of them,
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.280]  I felt like were purchased by these bigger companies,
[56:13.280 --> 56:15.120]  these bigger sponsors.
[56:15.120 --> 56:17.320]  You know, we finally won some cups
[56:17.320 --> 56:19.880]  at the Portland High Times Cup last year.
[56:19.880 --> 56:21.720]  I wasn't even there.
[56:21.720 --> 56:24.280]  My crew, you know, they took the cups home,
[56:24.280 --> 56:25.520]  a couple of third places.
[56:26.520 --> 56:29.800]  You know, it was cool for the camaraderie and the staff
[56:29.800 --> 56:33.240]  and, you know, people, you know, taking pride in ownership.
[56:33.240 --> 56:34.800]  But I think we could all probably agree.
[56:34.800 --> 56:37.040]  I feel like we live in a Cannabis Cup
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.080]  with the people that we associate with.
[56:39.840 --> 56:41.760]  I mean, I've seen some of the best pot on, you know,
[56:41.760 --> 56:44.000]  the planet through the people, you know, on this page
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.920]  and my friends that I associate with, you know.
[56:46.920 --> 56:51.920]  So I don't personally feel that cups are important anymore,
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.840]  you know, especially with the way High Times is.
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.240]  But back then cups made or break you or could break you.
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.480]  You know, when you look at Cali Connection, DFA, Crockett,
[57:01.480 --> 57:03.600]  like a lot of these bigger companies, you know,
[57:03.600 --> 57:06.720]  they invested a lot into the cup and, you know,
[57:06.720 --> 57:07.920]  it paid dividends for them.
[57:07.920 --> 57:10.520]  So I think that, you know,
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.560]  there was definitely some really cool stuff about the cups,
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.480]  but, you know, I don't really care to compete.
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.760]  You know, I just kind of put my head down and do the work.
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.240]  And, you know, I just, I like, like Shane said earlier
[57:22.240 --> 57:24.600]  in the podcast, you know, when you open a jar
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.000]  and someone turns their head and they're like,
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.400]  what the fuck is that?
[57:27.400 --> 57:29.760]  You know, that's pride in ownership, you know.
[57:29.760 --> 57:32.280]  To me, it was always about sharing in the experience.
[57:32.280 --> 57:34.120]  And, you know, when we all got together,
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.920]  we all have backpacks full of jars.
[57:36.960 --> 57:39.000]  Oh, look at this one, look at this one, look at this one.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.360]  And we'd get so fucking high, you couldn't see straight.
[57:42.360 --> 57:43.800]  But, you know, that was always one
[57:43.800 --> 57:44.920]  of the cooler things about it.
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.680]  So I think cups definitely play their place.
[57:46.680 --> 57:48.600]  They've made a ton of people,
[57:48.600 --> 57:51.200]  but I've also watched cups do crazy fucking things
[57:51.200 --> 57:53.800]  to people where, you know, they're getting tattoos
[57:53.800 --> 57:57.640]  of their cannabis cup and I'm a fucking cannabis cup winner.
[57:57.640 --> 57:59.600]  Ah, all right, cool, dude.
[57:59.600 --> 58:00.960]  You won a fucking competition.
[58:00.960 --> 58:04.240]  Like, I don't know, winning's great, you know.
[58:04.240 --> 58:05.760]  Not everyone should get a trophy,
[58:05.760 --> 58:06.720]  but at the end of the day,
[58:06.720 --> 58:08.240]  that just because you got a trophy one time
[58:08.240 --> 58:10.200]  doesn't mean your shit don't stink.
[58:10.200 --> 58:11.680]  One of the high times cups,
[58:11.680 --> 58:14.080]  they were actually tattooing there.
[58:14.080 --> 58:15.800]  I don't know if you remember that.
[58:15.800 --> 58:18.120]  And like, I mean, I'm a retired tattooist.
[58:18.120 --> 58:20.880]  That is not a place to get a tattoo.
[58:20.880 --> 58:23.200]  If you want that thing to heal clean and disease,
[58:23.200 --> 58:26.040]  you know, cross-contamination free and stuff like that,
[58:26.040 --> 58:29.480]  it's not a place to get a tattoo.
[58:29.480 --> 58:31.840]  But kind of touching back on the competition thing,
[58:31.840 --> 58:36.480]  the thing I did like about cups is connecting with people.
[58:36.480 --> 58:37.320]  You know what I mean?
[58:37.320 --> 58:40.120]  Because there's people on my social media
[58:40.120 --> 58:41.200]  who I've talked to for years,
[58:41.200 --> 58:44.600]  especially fellow autism parents and stuff like that.
[58:44.600 --> 58:46.320]  And I feel like I know these people,
[58:46.320 --> 58:47.160]  you know what I mean?
[58:47.160 --> 58:50.160]  Like, you know, a few of their letters to me
[58:50.160 --> 58:52.160]  have almost brought me to tears and stuff like that,
[58:52.160 --> 58:53.640]  especially, you know, that.
[58:53.640 --> 58:56.800]  And then being able to actually connect in person
[58:56.800 --> 58:57.760]  and give them a hug.
[58:57.760 --> 59:01.600]  And, you know, when I was going through my epilepsy,
[59:02.360 --> 59:03.200]  you know, the doctor finally said,
[59:03.200 --> 59:04.960]  hey man, it's time for brain surgery.
[59:06.040 --> 59:08.400]  And there is nothing you'll ever hear
[59:08.400 --> 59:10.240]  that just stops the world.
[59:10.240 --> 59:12.840]  Like you need brain surgery, you know?
[59:12.840 --> 59:14.200]  I mean, there's no part of my body
[59:14.200 --> 59:17.120]  I wouldn't rather have surgery on, like no part.
[59:17.120 --> 59:18.320]  You know what I mean?
[59:18.320 --> 59:19.720]  People's like, well, what about down there?
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.760]  I was like, well, that don't work without a brain.
[59:21.760 --> 59:22.600]  You know what I mean?
[59:22.600 --> 59:25.480]  And, you know, I had this kid come up to me
[59:25.480 --> 59:29.360]  and his, I don't even know how to say this politely,
[59:29.360 --> 59:31.920]  his head looked like someone took a chainsaw to it.
[59:31.920 --> 59:34.800]  He'd had, you know, major brain surgery
[59:34.800 --> 59:37.720]  to where they cracked his skull open, you know,
[59:37.720 --> 59:40.160]  and cut giant pieces of his brain out.
[59:40.160 --> 59:41.480]  You know, I never met this guy and he's like,
[59:41.480 --> 59:42.880]  hey, I've been seeing what you're going through
[59:42.880 --> 59:45.440]  on social media and stuff and check out my head.
[59:45.440 --> 59:46.440]  I'm still alive.
[59:46.440 --> 59:49.680]  I've had, you know, two or three major brain surgeries.
[59:49.680 --> 59:51.800]  And it was just such a big deal to me.
[59:51.800 --> 59:54.320]  It just like, you know, it's like somebody just
[59:54.320 --> 59:56.840]  pulled the plug on the bathtub of stress.
[59:56.840 --> 59:57.680]  You know what I mean?
[59:57.680 --> 59:58.760]  Like, look at this dude.
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.000]  Like the brain surgery I had was nothing.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.720]  It was a teeny little hole they drilled
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.800]  in the back of my head and used a laser.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.640]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.520]  And like, you know, things like that.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.640]  It was just me and that dude,
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.960]  we're like friends to this day.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.880]  We, you know, we live chat, you know,
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.240]  we talk through the videos so we can see each other
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.720]  on Instagram and, you know, stuff like that.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.080]  And I totally consider him a brother.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.360]  And, you know, it was because of a cup, you know,
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.120]  and he felt compelled, you know, to come up to me
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.840]  and, you know, and do that for me, which it was a big deal.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.760]  You know, and like I say, other people too,
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760]  fellow autism parents or just, you know,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.240]  folks that always chime in on your social media
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.960]  and you almost feel like you know them
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.240]  or, you know, stuff like that, you know, so.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.920]  I think what you just described there
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  to sum it up is community.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.600]  I think it was a lot kind of like what we were talking
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.040]  about earlier with the Grateful Ben.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.280]  You know, the Cups had a great cannabis community
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.720]  and that's where Sub fucking shined.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.200]  You know, walking that dude, you know, like,
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.560]  hey, hey, like that guy was fucking alive at the Cup.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.640]  He lived for them.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.360]  And people would be, by the end of it,
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.720]  like I remember at the first Cup, and I know Jill,
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.760]  people were like, Sub fucking who?
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.760]  And by the end of the days of the Cups that he went to,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.400]  I mean, he had stacks of people
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.280]  and a lot of the connections, you know,
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.040]  that I have, that you guys have,
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.240]  they're from the community of the Cannabis Cups.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.120]  So yeah, I think that was the best part
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.360]  about the Cannabis Cups and competitions
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.120]  is it brings us together and it puts us, you know,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.320]  to be on this computer screen and in person
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.720]  to have the conversation.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.440]  And there's so many humbling moments in there
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.480]  where, oh, you made this and I did this
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.400]  and you changed this and this changed my game.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.280]  And, you know, I was able to make money on this
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.640]  and, you know, I was able to pay my bills or, you know,
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.360]  there's so many of these stories
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.600]  throughout our entire group and industry.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.520]  You know, it's a hell of a community.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.720]  Yeah, I've seen people approach Sub
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.400]  before they're even talking to him
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.400]  and had like tears streaming down their face
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.760]  because they just couldn't believe,
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.000]  like, I'm about to talk to the man, you know what I mean?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.440]  And he was good about it.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.680]  You're like, hey bro, what's up?
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.480]  You know, not a, there's definitely, you know,
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.320]  like any industry, you got your rock stars
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.720]  and, you know, your stuff like that.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.600]  But that's what I realized.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.280]  Cause like I said, I really didn't even know who Sub was.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.160]  That's, you know, the first cup I went to him,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.600]  I was just chilling in his booth and I was like,
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.120]  damn, this dude is somebody.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.080]  Like, look at the effect he's had on these people,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.440]  whether it's like, dude, I'm the best scorer because of you
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.680]  or, you know, this or that, or like saying, you know.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.200]  He was an influencer before there was influencers.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.560]  You know, cause, and he was willing to do it.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.320]  When I was a kid, you didn't talk about growing weed.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.000]  I'd grow weed for years.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.320]  I grew weed for two years before I admitted it
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.400]  to my girlfriend, like straight up.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.240]  Like you just didn't, you know what I mean?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  Like guys I'd known had been busted
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.960]  by their ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, you know,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.720]  be like jealous or narcan or same thing you're saying.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.440]  You know, I sent other people to the growth stores.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.320]  I didn't go to the growth store
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.720]  and I'll buy no damn thousand watt light.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.600]  Are you crazy?
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.480]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.560]  I swear to God on our, go ahead.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.840]  I'm when you couldn't have,
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.360]  you couldn't have people over at your house.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.160]  You couldn't have friends socially.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.280]  Oh no.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.440]  My kids were just little and in school
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.520]  when I started growing.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.320]  So it was really scary being, I had medical,
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.920]  but knowing that my kids went to school
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.880]  and they were going to be asked at one point,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.920]  play a drug, you know, a drug cop that comes in, you know,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.480]  they try to get them to report the parents.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.440]  Do your parents grow weed?
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.040]  Do your parents do this?
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.440]  So it was very, I had to be very careful
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.440]  how I handled the situation that my children knew
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.080]  that I wasn't doing anything wrong,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.880]  respected what I was doing,
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.160]  but I couldn't hide it from them
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.800]  because I didn't want them to feel
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.080]  like I was doing something much worse.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.640]  So they actually were able to be part of my grow room
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.960]  and meet the patients and see what the cannabis would do
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.400]  for these people, you know,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.840]  and like, you know, Jinx with your son,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.840]  just a rice-sized piece of RSO can make him quit stimming
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.480]  and feel more normal.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.680]  So I've seen it stop seizures.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.560]  A lady that I was working with, she would get seizures
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.680]  and we just put a little drop of tincture under her tongue
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.440]  and she would quit seizing.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.800]  So for my kids to grow up learning the medicinal effects
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.640]  of cannabis is wonderful.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.600]  And my oldest daughter is still making RSO right now
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.600]  for their name is Danny Lyons on social media.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.880]  Her name is Sue, an adult autistic boy.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.680]  I think he's 25.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.960]  He's comfortable and he has swelling on the brain
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.600]  and pandas.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.440]  And so this RSO greatly helps him.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.400]  And my son-in-law is actually working
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.080]  to try to add different herbs in
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.320]  that will help with the swelling as well
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.720]  and help him with his dietary
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.480]  because his stomach doesn't work right.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.600]  And that's part of his problems.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.840]  So cannabis is wonderful as far as medical treatment
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.720]  for so many people.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.200]  And what you were saying about there were certain times
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.760]  usually towards the end of your crop,
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.760]  you couldn't have people over.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.000]  Well, to all the young guys watching this show,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.840]  they didn't have no damn carbon scrubbers back then.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.680]  No.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.760]  And you had to be aware of your electricity.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.880]  How do you have somebody come in and help you wire?
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.880]  We had to know how to do these things ourselves.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.040]  No bubbler buckets.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.080]  You couldn't walk in.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.440]  We had to go to the fish store and go to the plumbing store
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.080]  and learn how to do these things ourselves.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.440]  So, yeah, it was a different story back then.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.280]  Yeah.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.640]  And all the turps and all that.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.960]  When I was younger,
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.320]  we actually sought out strains that did not stink.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.000]  So you could have a basement.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.800]  One time I grew the true Northern Lights.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.520]  I'd be like a half mile from home and just be like, shit,
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.360]  that's me.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.480]  You know, that's me.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.240]  So we would literally seek out the most chronic strains
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.920]  that had the least smell,
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.760]  so you could actually get your work done
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.640]  without getting in trouble.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.080]  Because back then it was trouble.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.360]  I mean, once it became a medical and stuff like that
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.840]  in Washington, it was no big deal.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.680]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.400]  You might get a slap on the hand or don't do that
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.760]  or certain things.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.440]  But back then, guys were going to prison over it
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.280]  and stuff like that.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.120]  So.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.720]  It was a very real thing.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.280]  The respect back then that we had for one another
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.760]  was much greater than the respect people have now.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.600]  So many people are so quick to turn on each other
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.760]  in these days and before we could do things
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.600]  with a handshake.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.280]  And I really miss those times.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.120]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.960]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.920]  I will say one of the things that Jill touched on,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.240]  you know, about wiring and, you know,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.600]  going to the fish store is, you know,
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.280]  the way I personally feel about cannabis is two things.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.280]  One is it breaks boundaries between people where,
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.880]  you know, I'm the youngest person in this chat room,
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.440]  but I've got friends that are doctors, lawyers, you know,
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.960]  just not the iconic pothead.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.280]  And, you know, it was the joint
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.760]  that opened up the conversation
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.600]  to find commonalities inside of each other.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.560]  And then the other thing is cannabis is the biggest teacher
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.840]  that I've ever personally had.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.960]  You know, I'm not a huge fan of school, you know,
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.960]  but it's taught me how to educate myself,
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.960]  how to become the electrician, the plumber, the builder.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.920]  You know, when we were building grow rooms back in the day,
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.120]  you know, we were going into people's houses
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.000]  that we were renting
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.200]  and we were doing some crazy shit,
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.320]  rewiring whole panels, you know,
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.440]  oh, we can't use the dryer,
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.880]  we can't use the baseboard heat.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.160]  You know, it taught you about keeping your mouth shut.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.480]  And yeah, you know, I mean,
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.080]  I can't tell you how many friends
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.040]  that I personally have, young and old,
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.160]  that have seen, you know, jail time,
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.320]  left my house with five packs and, you know,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.680]  are getting set up and, you know,
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.760]  now you've got to keep them at an arm's distance.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.880]  So, you know, cannabis was definitely,
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.280]  and has always been, you know,
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.320]  I'm sure I speak for all of us,
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.440]  a massive, massive teacher,
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.240]  much beyond, you know,
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.760]  the cultivation of the plant and plant nutrition.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.920]  That's for damn sure.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.760]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.640]  There wasn't no YouTube
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.440]  you could just jump on and learn anything.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.640]  You get on YouTube right now
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.160]  and learn how to wire your room.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.800]  You know, hard-wired into a, you know,
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.560]  a water heater timer or whatever.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.960]  It wasn't none of that.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.360]  You know, and-
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.520]  You might get lucky with a Jorge Cervantes video
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.720]  real, real, real early in my game,
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.560]  where he's like,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.400]  you can microwave this weed when you're done.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.920]  I'm older than you.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.600]  There was no internet back then.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.440]  No shit.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.560]  There was no computers, nothing like that.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.560]  It was just homeboys
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.720]  and hopefully people you can trust, you know,
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.440]  and, you know, making it worth their time
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.760]  by giving them a few ounces when the crop was done
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.000]  or, you know, or something like that.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.920]  Cause obviously you shouldn't be playing with electricity
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.440]  if you don't know what the hell you're doing.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.480]  You know, what you said about your education.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.800]  Never let your schooling get in the way of your education.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.640]  That's for sure.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.480]  Right.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.120]  So are there any strains you guys want to talk about?
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.840]  Maybe their history and significance?
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.080]  I mean, I'd love to hear about the Vortex.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.400]  The Vortex was Apollo 13.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.360]  And we still have, I still have that cut today.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.480]  And we crossed that with the Space Queen
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.520]  to make the Vortex.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.400]  And, you know, I saw,
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.920]  I believe it was Matt Rise at one time,
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.280]  had to pull over and vomit on the side of the road.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.920]  It got him so high.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.280]  So it was one of those that would really,
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.400]  it would really get to you if you were a new smoker.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.120]  And I'm really excited to bring that one back soon.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.160]  Awesome.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.480]  And that was God's pussy.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.440]  You know it's good.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.640]  Shane, we haven't heard from you in a while.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.840]  You want to share with us, you know,
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.400]  any of the genetics that you worked with?
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.240]  Sure.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.800]  I don't know, probably one of my favorite ones.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.560]  Well, I love the Lemon Freeze.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.360]  That was, you know, one of the more,
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.440]  my first release of one of my first strains.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.880]  That, you know, I worked pretty hard on that.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.280]  But probably my favorite series is the Black Russian series,
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.400]  the Double Purple Doja and the Black Russian,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.280]  the Black Russian BX2,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.600]  which is Double Purple Doja
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.000]  back to the Black Russian F2 father.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.160]  I don't know, there was something special about that.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.200]  I put a lot of time and love in that.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.440]  And at a time, we were talking,
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.720]  doing, you know, working on like back crossing and cubing,
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.680]  but that is actually a back cross
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.120]  and a cube towards the male,
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.720]  which is a little, you know,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.600]  different than what a lot of people were doing
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.320]  at that point in time.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.480]  But those genetics, you know, they're really,
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.360]  there's something in there that they're just, you know,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.000]  there's a lot of good vibes, a lot of good energy,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.280]  but there's a lot of good turps, a lot of good colors.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.720]  You know, to this day, I, you know,
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.920]  I see a lot of amazing things come out of those genetics.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.920]  You know, I made in recent years
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.440]  with the Black Russian BX2 father,
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.920]  mother actually that I selected out from that generation.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.280]  And that's the mother of the applesauce.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.240]  So those genetics, they've been, you know,
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.800]  they've made their way through my rounds
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.920]  and then a lot of other people enjoyed them.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.960]  So those are some-
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.160]  I liked your neon super skunk the best.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.000]  Oh, I'll tell you what.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.320]  And, you know, people talk about roadkill skunk, Jill.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.720]  And I always refer right back to that cutting,
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.960]  you know, that super skunk.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.320]  Oh my fucking God.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.400]  It was just insane.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.280]  You'd open that jar and either you wanted to vomit
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.800]  and hate it or you would love it.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.480]  Yeah, it was just an incredible, incredible cut there.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.120]  That was super skunk.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.040]  And I do want to make sure that we give credit to Nebu
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.120]  for that Black Russian,
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.560]  because originally it was Black Rish Gaya.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.000]  He had given that to me a few years before I met Sub.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.280]  Yeah, Nebu's a good guy.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.640]  Yeah, and then, you know, a lot of people,
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.520]  it was actually a Black Russian F2
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.040]  rather than just a Black Russian
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.040]  as all people do exactly the F2 of that.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.760]  So do you want to share a little bit about your methodology
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.840]  for backcrossing and what you're selecting for typically?
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.920]  I mean, you're talking about using male
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.200]  in your BXing or your cubing.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.560]  When I was working on that stuff,
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.880]  it was all around color.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.040]  You know, I was trying to find,
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.160]  really produce dominant seed stock
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.240]  that would have reds and purples
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.240]  predominantly in there.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.320]  You know, just working with purple genetics,
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.600]  it doesn't work that way.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.720]  If you're going to cross a purple to a green plant,
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.280]  most of your seeds are going to be green
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.560]  and really trying to get that to be a dominant trait.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.200]  That was really what I was focusing on that,
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.600]  as well as structure.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:16.960]  And then over time,
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.520]  it's been trying to increase that potency,
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.480]  as we are all discussing.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.840]  You know, a lot of the older fruitier strains,
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.720]  they test a lot lower.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.160]  In fact, when purples were first being cultivated
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.640]  in a lot of the Dutch programs,
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.720]  if there was a purple plant that would pop up
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.560]  in their hunts, they would call them,
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.480]  they would kill that plant because it had lower potency.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.040]  You know, and I, working with those genetics,
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.880]  I always wanted to work with purple genetics
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.800]  and it was a blessing that Jill brought them to us
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.280]  and I was able to work with them.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.080]  And that just really stimulated my thinking with it.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.880]  And, you know, I knew there was something special in there,
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.240]  like why are these purple plants?
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.920]  So there's, you know, it may not make me high,
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.480]  but it makes me feel good.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.520]  And at that point in time,
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.760]  that's really when I started looking into, you know,
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.920]  research, what causes the purpling in plants
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.360]  and it's the anthocyanins
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.240]  and all these huge antioxidant rich powers that,
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.240]  you know, the purples have.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.040]  When you look at purples in food,
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.720]  they're like pomegranates, blueberries,
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.800]  all these wonderful things,
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.960]  these super fruits that we love.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.680]  And why is it any different with cannabis?
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.480]  And so that was one of my big stimulations and drive
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.080]  to just keep on working with purples
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.640]  and try to make purple a more dominant trait
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.040]  in generations that I kept on creating.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.440]  Awesome.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.040]  Yeah, so let's go talk to Pat real quick about,
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.200]  you know, I think we can talk about genetics.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.960]  I would love to hear kind of about outliers
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.280]  and large populations.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.800]  You guys, I know Shane, Ray,
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.520]  you all have used large populations for breeding.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.600]  How many in a progeny do you feel is necessary
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.880]  to find the outliers?
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.040]  I know it's different every time,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.320]  but you wanna talk a little bit about that
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.920]  and, you know, your pheno hunting?
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.160]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.920]  You know, typically now,
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.520]  say if I'm doing like a three gallon container
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.640]  in my houses, you know,
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.720]  it's anywhere from 3000 to 3,200 square feet,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.960]  you know, so I can fit anywhere from, you know,
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.200]  1500 to 1800 plants in one of those houses,
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.800]  you know, and usually I like to do three,
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.920]  you know, strands per house.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.040]  So depending on that, it's anywhere from five to 600,
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.200]  you know, and that way you can really see
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.960]  the different phenotypical expression
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.800]  and, you know, every project's a little bit different
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.360]  depending on what, you know, goal I'm setting.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.560]  One of the things that definitely after the first time
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.880]  I visited Jordan Wilcox, you know,
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.160]  we were sitting in there, it was the craziest shit ever.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.240]  I know Ray and Sonny both remember this,
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.200]  but it was monsoon season.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.760]  When we were in the greenhouse,
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.960]  you could literally see the fog layer
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.840]  just roll into the house and it rose 30% in humidity.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.680]  And then eventually the lightning
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.360]  actually struck the greenhouse.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.800]  And I mean, all of us jumped.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.240]  It was absolutely insane.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.160]  But in that, you know, there was definitely, you know,
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.400]  atritis, molds, mildews,
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.600]  and they were looking for, you know, resistance.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.520]  You know, so one of the things when I came home,
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.160]  I started locking up a conleys
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.520]  and I would shut it for 12 hours, no fans,
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.440]  you know, no de-hues, anything.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.000]  So I'd open it up and it'd be 95, 100% humidity.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.240]  I intentionally molded almost an entire crop.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.200]  But what I was looking for in say that particular hunt
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.960]  was the mold resistance in the stuff
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.800]  that I was searching for,
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.440]  because I live in probably one of the worst
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.600]  growing climates ever.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.400]  You know, I'm 38 miles from Mount Hood.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.840]  I'm wetter than Portland.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.400]  I'm at 1100 feet.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.680]  And powdery mildew and atritis have always crushed us.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.320]  You know, so by searching for those things now
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.880]  over the last five years of really doing it,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.960]  we have a resistance to the stuff that we have here
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.880]  that I don't see those same issues anymore.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.080]  You know, you can do bigger hunts,
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.080]  but personally I like to try to do about,
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.680]  you know, 500 at least.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.160]  You know, people get lucky if they pop 10 packs.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  We've all gotten lucky.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.440]  But when you get into these real large scale situations,
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.840]  you know, some of the stuff that I've cultivated
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.080]  that I'm talking about,
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.840]  you know, when I pass it along to the California crew
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.360]  that I run with, you know,
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.440]  my shit does terrible in San Luis Obispo,
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.560]  but it kills it in Humboldt, you know,
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.440]  and some of the more coastal regions.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.800]  So, you know, regionally speaking,
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.280]  you know, it depends on kind of where you're going,
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.520]  but I definitely think that for me personally,
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.560]  like 500 is a good number.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.160]  And then again, each project,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.320]  I searched through different things.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.160]  You know, sometimes it's mold resistance.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.280]  Sometimes I'm trying to put gas onto something,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.320]  you know, and one of the things
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.040]  that I do really appreciate now is the science behind it,
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.480]  where before, you know, we're using our senses,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.920]  you know, what's it smell like?
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.240]  What's it look like?
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.040]  Eventually what's it smoke taste?
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.880]  You know, what's the highlight?
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.680]  But now we actually get to use the science
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.320]  where we can take samples, you know,
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.560]  either through plant tissue or actual flower samples.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.280]  And we can find, you know, for us, you know,
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.640]  it's unfortunate where Oregon, especially, you know,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.720]  California and a lot of rec markets,
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.000]  the average consumer, the first thing they go into,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.240]  and it's changing slowly, but when it first started,
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.560]  it was what's the highest THC?
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.760]  And then it became as the brokers for the dispensary,
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.320]  you know, they're trying to negotiate five, $600 per pound
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.240]  if you're below 25% THC.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.080]  So then all of these fictitious numbers
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.960]  were started coming up, oh, 38%, this, that,
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.360]  you know, people are keeping product,
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.440]  you know, and it became very hard and disheartening
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.200]  when you have, you know, a lot of the shit that we all,
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.080]  the fruit and the purples and the things
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.880]  that built this company,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.560]  they would have never made it in a recreational market
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.720]  had that been the labor.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.000]  So some of the things that we had to do
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.440]  over the last couple of years is breed for THC.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.560]  You know, so obviously I'm breeding for resistance,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.480]  you know, nose, look, appearance,
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.720]  but those numbers are really important in Oregon.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.240]  So we had to jack all our numbers up.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.320]  So maybe this one plant over here
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.640]  blew everything out of the water
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.840]  if I was just using my senses,
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.200]  but unfortunately it was 20% THC.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.680]  You know, I remember when we started seeing 20%
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.400]  and 22 and 23% THC,
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.920]  and now people in Oregon scoff at 20,
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.400]  anything less than 25, which is absolutely ridiculous
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.480]  because the complexity of cannabinoids
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.840]  are not understand, understood yet
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.120]  about how they work with our receptors.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.640]  And, you know, if you're a new smoker and you,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.800]  hey, it's cool now, so I feel comfortable
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.560]  and I haven't smoked, you know, ever,
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.360]  or maybe I used to smoke, you know,
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.480]  in high school and college and I'm 60
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.440]  and you go in and you ask, you know, for the highest THC,
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.280]  you may end up with a quick panic attack.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.480]  So it's done a disservice in some instance, in my opinion.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.840]  So we, you know, we definitely have been working
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.480]  on trying to, you know, we launched a whole campaign
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.360]  of use your senses where, you know,
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.800]  when you go in and buy a bag of weed, open the jar,
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.880]  what does it tell you?
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.960]  But people didn't really, you know,
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.240]  unfortunately with bud tenders, you know,
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.600]  I have personal opinions on if you're a bartender,
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.040]  you know, and I come up and I'm like,
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.720]  hey, you know, I want a vodka and orange juice
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.240]  and you give me a vodka and Coke,
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.640]  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.760]  You know, but with bud tenders, they don't really know,
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.320]  they're not necessarily educated.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.880]  So they use the piece of paper, you know,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.400]  and it's all personal preference.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.280]  So I think across the board,
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.320]  a further education about these things needs to happen,
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.600]  you know, and if someone is suffering from high anxiety,
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.120]  a high THC isn't gonna be good for them.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.720]  Why don't you give them some CBD, you know,
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.760]  with a little bit of THC, a one-to-one
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.680]  or something like that.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.200]  So, you know, as a new industry,
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.720]  I think that people really need to continue
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.840]  to educate themselves.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.120]  And I think we all need to work together
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.960]  to continue to educate the consumer.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.160]  And it's through experience, you know,
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.520]  this may work really good for you, this may not.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.560]  And it's also, you know,
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.720]  every crop's a little bit different
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.920]  depending on how long you run it, nutrient input,
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.360]  you can give, you could literally give the same plant
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.520]  to each one of us and depending on where it's grown,
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.880]  who's it grown by, what's it grown with,
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.000]  we're gonna come out with multiple different expressions
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.840]  of that plant.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.360]  So, you know, it's just one of those things
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.400]  where every project I usually set out
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.520]  with a different goal and then we hunt
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.240]  and kind of search based on those goals.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.840]  You know, at a Seattle Hemp Fest one time,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.360]  Sub used to come chill at our booth
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.840]  and Ed Rosenthal was all right across the way
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.800]  and Jorge Cervantes would show up.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.560]  He'd always be in this weird like disguise, you know,
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.240]  like literally like Halloween outfits
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.080]  and nobody knew who he was.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.200]  But like, we had that discussion
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.120]  because that's when it was all first starting to happen
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.200]  with these 30, 36 and all three of them were like,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.560]  the plant can't even support those kinds of numbers,
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:07.080]  like that kind of, you know, trichomes and stuff like that.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.560]  So Sub used to joke like, whoever's passing out these tests,
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.000]  get your shit tested there, you know what I mean?
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.760]  Like roll in with your 12% and then, you know,
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.640]  leave with a nice test that says 28%, you know what I mean?
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.880]  You know, I kind of agreed with him, you know,
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.320]  because I had a Hit Girl and Mother Tongue tested side by side
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.280]  before you had to be a legal farm to do that here in Washington
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.680]  and the Hit Girl like dominated the Mother Tongue, you know,
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.400]  I mean like twice the sugar on it
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.720]  and it came 2% lower on the test and no way,
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.120]  unless they mix up the butter, so like, it was impossible,
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:46.960]  you know what I mean?
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.160]  But so I don't know how much faith I even have
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.080]  in some of this testing anyways
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.200]  and I agree with what Pat said too,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.200]  like Rose's brother had a liver cancer
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.000]  and he asked me to get him some weed
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.720]  and I gave him some and he was like, fuck that.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.880]  He was like, I was sitting on the edge of my bed,
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880]  he ain't smoked since the 60s, you know what I mean?
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.520]  He's like, I was sitting on the edge of my bed
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.120]  praying to God for it to be over.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.240]  It was literally.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.240]  You know, and there's so much to that
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.520]  because for example, jelly bean,
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.600]  it doesn't come in really high,
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.480]  but it has, its fame came because it's,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.080]  originally I made Agent Orange for the veterans
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.720]  because my dad had passed from cancer
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.720]  caused from Agent Orange, so that was my tribute.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.640]  So I had made that originally for the veterans,
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.560]  but jelly bean became the favorite
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.880]  because of the different range of cannabinoids and terpenes
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.520]  and how they work together.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.880]  It's great for PTSD, anxiety, depression
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.640]  and of course it also goes into PMS and endometriosis pain.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.800]  So, you know, if you were to go into a dispensary
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.240]  and you don't know anything about it,
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  you might not pick it because it's lower on the scale,
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.560]  but the relief it provides medically
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.920]  is something that, you know, can't be argued.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.600]  And one thing the tests do help with
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.800]  is it does show us the terpenes and the cannabinoids.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.240]  Even if the THC content is elevated,
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.840]  you can still get a feel of what's in the plant
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.120]  that might be the combinations that are good for you.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.800]  So, and I think the reason that bud tenders
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.080]  have so much trouble with being able to learn
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.680]  different strains is we have so many,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.800]  you know, vodka and Coke, that's easy.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.360]  Vodka and orange juice, that's easy.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.680]  But the strains are made from so many different things,
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.600]  so many different new crosses put together
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.320]  and it's not consistent enough for them to learn it.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.880]  So we need to come out with some sort of testing.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.800]  So they have, you know, different cannabinoids
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.400]  more readily available to the bud tenders
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.480]  so they can help the patient.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.640]  Well, there needs to be some sort of testing
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.400]  and education for the bud test, for the bud tenders.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.240]  Because around here, Washington,
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.080]  we have stores like every block.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.760]  We have a place here where two stores face each other.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.960]  Like they're 30 feet apart, you know what I mean?
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.280]  There's just that many,
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.880]  and it's usually bubbly, good-looking young people,
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.120]  you know, whether it's some, you know,
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.520]  hot little chick or some handsome, you know, dude,
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.120]  and they really couldn't tell you anything, you know?
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.280]  And there's nothing wrong with being an attractive person,
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.520]  but give them some education or, you know,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.360]  make them research this or even, you know,
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.320]  there's jobs where you have to pass a little test
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.680]  to get the job, you know,
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:30.880]  and there's nothing wrong with that,
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.600]  or, you know, sit down and, you know,
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.640]  watch these YouTube channels for a week,
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.160]  or, you know, once you've hired them,
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.560]  because like I say, on average,
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.920]  most of them don't know anything.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.000]  They're just attractive people, you know?
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.160]  I mean, especially here, at least, anyways.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.680]  You know, usually chicks, you know?
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.400]  So, yeah, there's no-
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.080]  We almost need to develop a new language.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.480]  I mean, I think it's kind of like learning a new language.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.880]  There's this education process,
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.200]  but it's like for people to fully understand it,
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.440]  it's a whole language that you need to understand,
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.440]  and we're very comfortable with it,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.400]  but I think a lot of people don't understand
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.960]  the gist of everything.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.160]  So you walk into a store and you say,
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.240]  Tricorme says what?
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.080]  Yeah.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.000]  They say what?
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.600]  You might be in the wrong store.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.560]  So we got a question from one of our viewers.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.760]  They would like for you guys
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.440]  to talk about the Chernobyl strain.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.360]  I know you guys kind of touched on the golden ticket
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.200]  and the Slimer.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.720]  I've grown Slimer personally.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.800]  I've bred with Slimer.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.480]  I crossed it with a purple tangy.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.800]  Came out with some really unique chirps and some color.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.240]  Who wants to touch on Chernobyl?
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.600]  Where it came from, kind of the process behind it?
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.120]  It came originally from Dioxide
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.480]  when he was working with TGA,
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.760]  and he was one of the breeders
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.680]  that contributed the most strains to TGA
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.360]  that weren't part of his own company.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.160]  So he was actually TGA.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.080]  Like he didn't have his own company.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.680]  And Chernobyl was one of his first,
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.200]  and like I was saying earlier,
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.680]  he had given those original test seeds
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.200]  to Danny from Uplifted Farms.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.320]  Danny grew some out.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.560]  He came out with the golden ticket
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.600]  and it wasn't supposed to be passed out.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.640]  It was a specific phenotype.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.320]  It got into different hands.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.760]  Coma the grower got it and renamed it Slimer.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.120]  And that's why it has both of the names,
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.920]  but it's the same phenotype of Chernobyl.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.000]  Awesome.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.760]  Yeah, when I became a rep for Sub,
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.520]  I went and I popped like everything.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.840]  I gotta check this stuff out.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.400]  And Chernobyl and Jillybean were definitely the best
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.320]  as far as a chronic.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.440]  The Jillybean killed it as far as the yield went,
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.560]  but the Chernobyl was just frosty frosty.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.560]  I believe I had the blood wreck dominant one
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  from what I'd known and stuff.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.440]  And Dioxide is probably the most undercredited,
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.320]  under known part of TGA.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.720]  And that's by choice.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.880]  Like if you try to take a Instagram picture with him,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.600]  he's like, no, no, I don't do that shit, bro.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.080]  Nobody know nothing about that.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  So most people barely even know who he is
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.280]  aside from maybe hearing his name
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.160]  kicked around a little bit.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.720]  We can plug his business.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.600]  He owns the OG collective dispensaries in Salem, Oregon.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.720]  So if you wanna meet Dioxide, that's your best chance.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.800]  Yeah, he could walk through a cup
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.440]  and maybe not even one person be like,
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.680]  Dioxide, unless it was one of us.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.560]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.720]  So, you know.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.640]  But that was his choice.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.560]  I mean, that was-
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.760]  Absolutely his choice.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.520]  You know, social media has its place.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.960]  I, you know, my social media has gotten pretty popular.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.440]  I joke with Rose that when I go to cups,
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.560]  I need a black hoodie.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.440]  Cause you know, you guys know I'm all about the orange.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.400]  I'm always wearing my orange hat, my orange hoodie.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  I was like, I need a black hoodie
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.800]  so I can go to the bathroom.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.640]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.920]  Cause people stop you, you're about to pee your pants.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.760]  You know?
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.600]  It's pretty funny.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.960]  It's strange to get used to too.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.040]  I'm still, you know, I still don't get used to, you know,
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.880]  people wanting you to sign something
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.280]  or getting emotional because they've met you.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.120]  I mean, with the autism thing, I get it.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.320]  But with just the straight follower,
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.280]  I hate using the word fan, but you know, fans,
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.800]  it's, I mean, I know you guys have all experienced it too.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.000]  You're all pretty popular guys.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.040]  So it's strange to get used to.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.480]  It was strange for me to watch the first few times
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.560]  I hung out with Sub.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.720]  Look at this guy.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.840]  Like he literally got like a tear rolling down his face.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.640]  It's pretty funny.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.000]  When someone asked for your autograph,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.240]  you're like, what do you want this shit for?
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.520]  I didn't even know what social media,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.200]  I had to give my phone to my 16 year old employee.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.280]  I was like, what's that?
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.120]  Instamathingamajiggergrammion?
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.080]  What the hell he was talking about?
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.280]  But you know, you realize the power of it too.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]  And there's a lot of power for good too.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.760]  You know, we do a lot of auctions for 22 Mini
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.040]  and for autistic kids.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.680]  And because of having a large social media,
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.600]  you know, it's created a lot of money
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.880]  and helped a lot of kids and veterans
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.800]  and stuff like that too.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.560]  So it definitely has its place and you know,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.040]  some abuse it, some use it, you know what I mean?
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.040]  You know, on the regards of the Chernobyl blood wreck,
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.720]  a lot of people think that it is train wreck in Trinity.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.520]  I know that some of us know differently.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.120]  So how about we discuss that for a moment?
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.960]  Since you know, Chernobyl is being brought up right now.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.800]  Yes.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.200]  What'd you say?
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.040]  Blood wreck came to us from-
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.880]  I said, I drew blood wreck out in the mist in 2009.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.400]  And that thing, fucking, I made a bunch of super soil
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.960]  and it was just pissed the entire,
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.240]  everything else was thriving and that thing was just pissed.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.360]  So it made me hate it.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.280]  She's different.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.320]  I still hold her.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.080]  She's difficult to grow.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.200]  And she did come through dioxide
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.520]  and came from a guy named Scotty and it's a train wreck.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.720]  Yeah.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.440]  The hit girl is Hammer Times blood wreck.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.480]  And I got the blood wreck from dioxide.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.960]  So I knew it was legit.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.440]  At the time, especially in Seattle,
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.560]  there was a big problem with people renaming strains
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.520]  because clones were a huge industry.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.360]  And I was at a store one time
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.320]  and the guy did it right in front of me.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.080]  And I just pulled out all the tags
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.520]  and put new tags in with new names.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.880]  So you kind of had to be careful with that.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.520]  I was like, you're not even gonna go in the back room
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.840]  and hide it.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.560]  So I was always excited that I got it from dioxide personally
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.600]  because I figured it must be pretty legit at that point.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.240]  But it can be a hard strain to get your hands on too.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.680]  People tend to hoard it.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.880]  So Shane, was there Trinity in there?
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.200]  That's always been my question.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.000]  Ray and I have discussed this a little bit
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.200]  and does it have the train wreck or the Trinity in there?
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.720]  I mean, Ray, what do you know about that?
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.360]  You know, I'm not quite sure.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.520]  Our buddy Earl Dabbs, who everybody here knows,
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.400]  did a back cross with it.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.320]  He used our time wreck mail,
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.240]  back crossed it to the blood wrecks.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.120]  We call it the blood wreck VX2.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.760]  I haven't really played with those seeds very much,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.480]  but he did some and they were pretty nice.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.160]  I'm not exactly sure as far as if it has
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.240]  any Trinity in it or not.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.200]  And I just know that you and I have had the discussion,
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.840]  it's come up before, like people, you know,
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.000]  I inquired, you know,
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.800]  is there actually train wreck in that or not?
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:36.800]  So I was wondering if anybody else here-
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.160]  It came when it was given to us,
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.120]  actually, I'm sorry, it came from Grant,
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.320]  a guy named Grant, when it was given to us.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.280]  It's actually what ended subs friendship with him was this.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.880]  So it wasn't dioxide, it was Grant,
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.320]  but Grant introduced us to dioxide.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.760]  And so it came to us as train wreck.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.000]  Because the story-
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.960]  But it came from Scottie, it went from Scottie to,
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.560]  I'm sorry,
[01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:12.190]  dioxide got it from, I'm sorry, Scottie.
[01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:16.830]  I was always told that it's an extremely hard pheno
[01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:18.470]  to find of the train wreck.
[01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:21.190]  I mean, I don't know, I don't know the actual history,
[01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:24.310]  but that's kind of the gist or the rumors
[01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:26.270]  or the stuff that I always heard
[01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:29.310]  that it was a very hard pheno to find of the train wreck.
[01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:31.550]  But I honestly have no idea.
[01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:34.790]  She's blood wreck because she bleeds red.
[01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:35.630]  Yeah.
[01:32:35.630 --> 01:32:36.470]  That's why we went,
[01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:38.910]  I believe we were the ones that named her blood wreck,
[01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:41.190]  she just came as train wreck.
[01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:43.150]  And it definitely doesn't have like
[01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:46.030]  the traditional gassy kind of train wreck nose.
[01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:47.910]  It's a very unique terpene profile.
[01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:52.270]  And like Jill said, it literally had a red hue to it.
[01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:53.910]  Like a lot of times when you're washing hash,
[01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:55.110]  you'll see purples and stuff
[01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:57.550]  and all the different pigments come through.
[01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:59.630]  That's where the blood wreck name came from.
[01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:00.750]  Very, very unique.
[01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:04.230]  And it's not typical to any other train wreck version
[01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:05.910]  out there, that's for sure.
[01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:07.110]  Yeah, I didn't actually know,
[01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:08.590]  but I assumed the name came
[01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:13.070]  because when I was doing the leaves were like a maroon,
[01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:16.910]  which looked like blood, like after it's dried,
[01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:18.230]  like you get some blood on the ground
[01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:21.070]  or like it starts to dry, it's not that red blood red.
[01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:23.030]  It's that kind of maroony and all those.
[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:25.390]  I don't know that, I just always kind of assumed that
[01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:27.110]  because mine definitely had that color.
[01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:28.230]  It wasn't, like I said,
[01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:30.310]  it wasn't the biggest yielder in the room,
[01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.110]  but it definitely was just frosty as hell.
[01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:34.390]  You know, it was just chronic
[01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.230]  and it was very popular back then too.
[01:33:37.670 --> 01:33:39.230]  Yeah, she's nice.
[01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:42.270]  Let's talk a little bit about a dragon's blood, Ray.
[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:45.470]  You know, with your organ diesel,
[01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:47.390]  it's one of the beautiful characteristics
[01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:50.790]  besides it being a semi-auto that triggers
[01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:52.790]  on anything less than 20 hours of light
[01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:54.430]  or what, 22 hours of light.
[01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:58.110]  The dragon's blood, did you breed specifically
[01:33:58.110 --> 01:34:00.910]  for that trait or is it something
[01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:02.830]  that just you guys stumbled upon?
[01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:08.190]  If you're talking about the organ diesel bleeding purple,
[01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:10.750]  yeah, no, that's just something that it does.
[01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:14.270]  I haven't figured, we didn't have to,
[01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.430]  I haven't figured out where it comes from,
[01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:18.830]  but you know, as Shane says,
[01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:20.790]  all purples are due to anthocyanins.
[01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:22.670]  So then at that point,
[01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:25.110]  the anthocyanins must be fairly strong in that,
[01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:26.790]  which it comes out purple,
[01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:33.230]  but yeah, it's kind of an interesting effect for sure.
[01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:36.790]  And I've also noticed that it kind of depends
[01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:40.150]  on how old the plant is and where you top it at,
[01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:43.110]  whether or not it bleeds, if it bleeds purple or not.
[01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:47.710]  So with the progeny, when you make a new process with it,
[01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:53.230]  do the crosses display the same traits
[01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:56.790]  or is it a percentage of the progeny or?
[01:34:56.790 --> 01:35:00.590]  Yeah, so we see about 30%, one third of them
[01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:03.270]  still do the semi-auto trait,
[01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:06.230]  you know, which isn't bad,
[01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:09.750]  but which is fantastic in different gardens for sure.
[01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.430]  If you got to beat a cold snaps or rain weather
[01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:13.830]  or whatever that affects.
[01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:19.630]  But yeah, we do see that pass along in progeny, absolutely.
[01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:21.510]  So if you don't mind, I have a quick question
[01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:25.550]  with the anthocyanins, Ray and Sonny,
[01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:29.430]  what about the, you know, get your plant cold,
[01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:31.310]  it'll turn purple.
[01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:32.790]  Or you can use some purple meter
[01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:34.430]  or whatever it's called, you get the-
[01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:38.030]  Yeah, like does it affect the anthocyanins
[01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:39.710]  or is that just a-
[01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:44.470]  Sure, I mean, anthocyanins like a true purple,
[01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:46.510]  which is going to turn, you know,
[01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:50.190]  when flower setting at day 14, 17, 21,
[01:35:50.190 --> 01:35:52.470]  when everything's just coming into term,
[01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:54.910]  you know, when they're purple at that point in time,
[01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:56.710]  that's true anthocyanins.
[01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:59.870]  And yes, they're anthocyanins at the end of flowering,
[01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:02.950]  but you know, whether you're reducing it through pH
[01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:05.870]  or colder temps, I'm sure that is,
[01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:08.750]  you are influencing the same characteristics, you know,
[01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:12.990]  but as far as, you know, the content of anthocyanins
[01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:14.910]  and the cardinoids in the plant,
[01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:16.110]  they're going to be a little bit less
[01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:19.590]  than a true purple plant, obviously,
[01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:21.590]  but the same thing.
[01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:24.870]  And it's the same thing in flowers and, you know,
[01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:27.630]  vegetables and fruits and all that, you know,
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:28.470]  it's the same.
[01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:32.550]  So does that get passed on fairly easily
[01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:34.550]  or is it something you'd have to really select for?
[01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:36.030]  I mean, I guess another thing
[01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:37.230]  for the people that are watching,
[01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:40.390]  you know, what we're talking about is purple sap.
[01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:43.070]  You know, when you take a stem and you snap it
[01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:44.030]  and squeeze a little bit of sap,
[01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:46.830]  we're talking about actual purple red color,
[01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:48.270]  you know, that's very unique.
[01:36:50.110 --> 01:36:52.230]  As far as a trait, I mean, that's, you know,
[01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:56.630]  to breed that and to try to get that to be stable
[01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.670]  in your progeny, you know, your seed stock
[01:36:58.670 --> 01:36:59.510]  as you're growing up,
[01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:01.550]  that's going to be a really hard one to lock down.
[01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:04.670]  I mean, that's not a very common trait, you know,
[01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:06.790]  and even as Ray was saying, you know,
[01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:08.790]  the third of the progeny, you know,
[01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:10.670]  having the semi-autoflowering,
[01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:14.190]  so even less are going to have the chance
[01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:17.030]  to produce purple sap like that, the plum sap.
[01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:20.750]  So, yeah, I mean, as far as trying to lock that trait down,
[01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:23.510]  I want to see somebody do it, you know?
[01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:24.870]  Really interesting.
[01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:26.670]  That's a challenge in itself.
[01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:29.550]  I think you'd have to use multiple types
[01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:32.310]  of analytical testing and other testing
[01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:34.790]  to help you narrow that down quicker
[01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:36.350]  or else you'd just be shooting in the dark
[01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:39.310]  for quite a long time trying to lock that trait down.
[01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:44.230]  So, Sonny, what did you think when those products came out?
[01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:46.670]  I think one of them was called Purple Max.
[01:37:46.670 --> 01:37:47.670]  The Purple Max?
[01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:49.350]  I just laughed.
[01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:50.790]  I was like, well, you need that shit
[01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:52.150]  to make your plants purple.
[01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:55.910]  Well, I didn't know for a fact,
[01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:58.590]  but some people were talking about like,
[01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:00.710]  I don't even know what was in that bottle,
[01:38:00.710 --> 01:38:03.270]  but supposedly it was like not a good thing.
[01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:05.390]  Like it was some kind of pretty harsh chemical.
[01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:06.750]  It had a lot of cars in it.
[01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.030]  I got taken off the market,
[01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:11.510]  but one of the things with purple in plants
[01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.470]  and when people try all these temperature fluctuations
[01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:15.830]  and a lot of this stuff,
[01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:17.710]  it's different from what we're talking about here
[01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:20.150]  because chlorophyll being the predominant pigment
[01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:21.830]  comes through, that's green.
[01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:26.830]  And some strands, they have the purple trait to it
[01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:28.470]  and others don't.
[01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:29.870]  You can drop your temperature.
[01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:31.350]  You could water with ice water
[01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:34.630]  and Jack Herro isn't gonna express that.
[01:38:34.670 --> 01:38:37.270]  So when you have a lot of these products come through,
[01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:39.470]  there's a lot of shit that went,
[01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:42.190]  I mean, I sat in hydro stores for a decade.
[01:38:42.190 --> 01:38:43.550]  There's a lot of products that came out there
[01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.150]  that are just absolute bullshit.
[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:48.030]  That being one of them,
[01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:51.550]  but a lot of it's just genetic characteristics
[01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:54.390]  and traits that are passed on through things
[01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:56.630]  and not all cannabis can just do that.
[01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.590]  It's not something like, oh, it's autumn
[01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:01.430]  and all our leaves are gonna turn yellow and purple
[01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:02.670]  and all this shit.
[01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:06.670]  So they're very two different characteristics
[01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:08.030]  of what we're kind of talking about
[01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:10.870]  where people would get very, very confused.
[01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:14.230]  And I've seen a lot of people drop room temperatures,
[01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:16.990]  drop water temperatures, change their pH,
[01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:18.590]  add more potassium.
[01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:20.470]  There's definitely tricks that you can do
[01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:24.790]  that can bring out and really express those pigments.
[01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:26.390]  But usually at a plant's life cycle,
[01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:28.150]  when the chlorophyll is dropping off
[01:39:28.150 --> 01:39:30.630]  is when those pigments that are already laying dormant
[01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:32.470]  in those plants are truly expressed.
[01:39:33.710 --> 01:39:35.350]  Yeah, I find most plants,
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:39.830]  buds that are partially purple are way more chronic.
[01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:41.750]  Like a couple of you guys were saying earlier,
[01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:44.590]  like the super purples just weren't that potent,
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:46.630]  but there's that bag appeal.
[01:39:46.630 --> 01:39:49.150]  I do this little thing on my social media every day
[01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:50.790]  where I open up a little box
[01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:53.870]  and I say it's time to select a NUG Dijor
[01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:55.350]  from the random NUG box.
[01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:56.390]  And that's what it's about,
[01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.710]  is picking out a nice bud for the day.
[01:39:58.710 --> 01:40:00.350]  Every time the comments are like,
[01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:02.990]  oh, I got that purple one in the corner.
[01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:06.190]  But if I held those right up to the camera,
[01:40:06.190 --> 01:40:08.070]  you'd see like they're not half as chronic
[01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.910]  as the other ones,
[01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:10.630]  or the ones that have just like little streaks
[01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:11.470]  of purple going through,
[01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:13.510]  like the straight purple purple,
[01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:15.270]  it's not even half as chronic.
[01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:18.230]  I mean, a lot of you guys may remember like the Zen,
[01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:20.150]  the Afgui cross.
[01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:21.830]  I mean, that was,
[01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:24.230]  that as soon as it flowered, it was purple.
[01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:28.310]  And it was dark, dark purple, almost looked black.
[01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.670]  Wasn't that great of a smoke?
[01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:31.470]  I absolutely love the hash.
[01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:34.150]  That was one of his favorite, you know, hashes of smoke,
[01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:36.750]  but you know, definitely not a very potent genetic,
[01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:40.550]  but that was a trait that just instantly appeared
[01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:43.990]  versus coming out at the plant's end of the life cycle.
[01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:45.630]  You know, I'm very impressed.
[01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:48.790]  I used a purple Afghani and I did a reversal on it
[01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:52.710]  and made some feminized hybrids with it,
[01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.710]  a headband and an OG Kush,
[01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:59.430]  and of course an S1 and with the G13 as well.
[01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:04.470]  And I would say 60, 70% of those are purple
[01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:07.310]  and of all four of them.
[01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:11.710]  And I would say that probably about 30% of them
[01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:12.630]  bleed purple.
[01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.430]  And it's real heavy in the budding.
[01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:20.590]  It's not, and some of them,
[01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:21.990]  it has the purple and green mix,
[01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:24.830]  like Jinx was saying, I believe,
[01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:26.550]  for the nice pretty bag of pill.
[01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:28.430]  And then some of them are just straight purple.
[01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:33.430]  So it's got quite a bit of the purpling in there.
[01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:36.590]  Yeah, those purple Afghanis can be pretty pungent
[01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.590]  and strong, like pretty high.
[01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:42.470]  Yeah, well, the hammer is Afgoo berry,
[01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:45.350]  which is Afgoo-y times a berry Kush.
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.390]  And it gets super purple, but it's super chronic.
[01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:50.070]  Like it'll ruin your day.
[01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.910]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:52.030]  That's for sure.
[01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:55.310]  So, but you know, everybody has something different.
[01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:57.070]  Some people bag of pill means a lot to them
[01:41:57.110 --> 01:42:02.110]  and maybe they're subliminally getting higher
[01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:06.470]  because of enjoying that color and that presence,
[01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:09.230]  just like when a hot chick walks by or something,
[01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:10.430]  I don't know.
[01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:12.790]  Yeah, yeah, blackberry Kush back in the day
[01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:15.670]  was an amazing looking bud that had awesome bag of pill,
[01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:16.950]  but it didn't really get you high.
[01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:18.830]  And then once we got analytical testing,
[01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:22.270]  it all made sense because it tested it like nine to 10%.
[01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:23.190]  Right.
[01:42:23.190 --> 01:42:24.510]  Yeah.
[01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:27.030]  Which was strong weed for some of us old guys
[01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:28.710]  when we were kids.
[01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:30.990]  That was so bomb, you know?
[01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.830]  Yeah.
[01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:32.990]  You know, like brother,
[01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:34.590]  Rose's brother I was talking about,
[01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:36.350]  you know, when he had sitting on the edge of the bed,
[01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.950]  praying to God for it to be over.
[01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:39.790]  He hadn't smoked weed since the sixties.
[01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:42.870]  Like his chronic was, you know, probably 4%.
[01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:44.030]  And he, you know, he hated it.
[01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:45.670]  Like say he had cancer
[01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:47.510]  and that's why he started smoking weed again.
[01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:50.110]  I mean, obviously it wasn't gonna save him at that point,
[01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:53.270]  but you know, after that, he asked me,
[01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:55.270]  like, if you go to a store
[01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:58.510]  and you see the worst weed you've ever seen in your life,
[01:42:58.510 --> 01:43:00.310]  like, would you grab me some of that?
[01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:04.230]  Is that just the generation he came from, you know?
[01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:05.910]  That was, I did get him some of that.
[01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:08.150]  It was just, you know, like practically trim, you know,
[01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:09.550]  that was perfect for him.
[01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.510]  So it's probably 2%.
[01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:12.350]  Yeah.
[01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:16.190]  I was gonna ask you guys about
[01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.110]  indoor versus outdoor breeding.
[01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:20.310]  Now, about two years ago,
[01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:24.590]  I bred the same varieties indoors and outdoors
[01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:26.870]  I had to move some of the plants indoors
[01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:28.230]  because I ran out of space.
[01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:29.990]  And then I had to,
[01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.070]  I ended up moving them all in
[01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:32.110]  cause they got cold together.
[01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:36.230]  But the ones outdoor actually had a larger size seeds,
[01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:37.590]  like significantly larger.
[01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:39.350]  Way bigger, way bigger.
[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:43.350]  And Odie, all his seeds from the Homegrown Natural Wonders,
[01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.590]  everything I've ever seen is like this massive seed.
[01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:47.430]  Whereas like the indoor stuff,
[01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.550]  you guys wanna talk about your preference
[01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:53.550]  on breeding indoor versus outdoor and benefits to both?
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:54.910]  Pat, we can start with you.
[01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:57.230]  Yeah, I've definitely done, you know,
[01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:59.430]  breeding in greenhouses, you know,
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:01.030]  breeding straight outdoor plants
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:02.990]  and then breeding an indoor.
[01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:05.110]  You know, one of the biggest things, you know,
[01:44:05.110 --> 01:44:08.470]  when we had, you know, say our six plants outside
[01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:10.950]  that would have yielded, you know, five pounds,
[01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:14.070]  one of them hit over 70,000 seeds out of one plant,
[01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:15.790]  which is absolutely insane.
[01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:20.270]  The size of the seed, I probably still have them,
[01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:22.790]  but it was almost double the size.
[01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:27.270]  Deep, dark, tiger striped, absolutely amazing process.
[01:44:28.150 --> 01:44:33.070]  You know, in terms of, you know,
[01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:34.550]  expression that comes out of it,
[01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:37.070]  you know, from what I've seen, it's the same, you know.
[01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.390]  So outside, you know,
[01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.710]  especially some of the breeders that I know in the industry
[01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:43.710]  that have been doing it this way forever,
[01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:46.190]  you know, from a cultivation perspective,
[01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:47.870]  you get way more bang for your buck
[01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:51.230]  with way less, you know, input in electric, you know,
[01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:54.230]  and just all of the overhead that kind of goes in with it.
[01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:57.550]  Also, a lot of these, you know, guys that are doing it,
[01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:00.350]  you know, you're trying to grow things, you know,
[01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:02.150]  from a regional standpoint.
[01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:03.710]  So when you're doing that outside,
[01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:05.550]  especially if it's a plant that's, you know,
[01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:08.510]  good for your zone, it can then pass that on
[01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:11.630]  and kind of stabilize that out for your next generations.
[01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:14.310]  You know, greenhouse is where we make
[01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:15.630]  a lot of our seeds now.
[01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:19.510]  You know, it's the best of both worlds.
[01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:23.350]  You know, I'm not having such an ecological footprint,
[01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:24.950]  you know, in the summer,
[01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:27.270]  and the yields are definitely up there.
[01:45:28.110 --> 01:45:31.430]  You do always, you know, have to, environmentally speaking,
[01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:33.110]  you've got to spend some money to get, you know,
[01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:34.150]  especially where I'm at, you know,
[01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:37.310]  the humidity and dehumidification in control.
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:40.830]  But the sun is a very, very powerful thing.
[01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:42.830]  You know, when you look at what that thing kicks out
[01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:45.550]  in peak density versus a thousand watt, you know,
[01:45:45.550 --> 01:45:47.190]  you can't compete with the sun.
[01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:49.430]  But, you know, obviously in indoor,
[01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:51.550]  you always have, you know, more control.
[01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:55.470]  So, you know, I just, I think that, you know,
[01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:58.270]  depending on what your goals are, you know,
[01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:00.470]  and also, you know, I think an important part is
[01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:03.710]  what we're seeing in Oregon quite a bit, you know,
[01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:05.590]  there's so many people in Southern Oregon
[01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:08.790]  that are impacted by hemp fields right now
[01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:10.950]  that are either having, you know, hermaphrodism
[01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:13.870]  or people are just straight have nails in them.
[01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:16.790]  And, you know, that cross-pollination, we have, you know,
[01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:18.950]  we don't know how far that drift goes,
[01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:21.510]  but, you know, it could be up to five miles.
[01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:23.630]  And I've seen, you know, our old vineyard
[01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:26.630]  time and time again, you know, get cross-pollinated
[01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:29.670]  and you don't know where that source is coming from.
[01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:31.870]  You know, now with everything that we've got going on
[01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:33.710]  with the hemp industry, you know,
[01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.070]  I don't breed, you know, THC outside anymore
[01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:38.030]  because if I do have that cross-pollination,
[01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:41.270]  that's gonna be a world of hurt for us.
[01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:43.590]  So we try to isolate it and control, you know,
[01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:45.550]  our pollen quite a bit,
[01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:47.630]  but there's definitely massive benefits,
[01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:49.190]  but you just have to be aware of, you know,
[01:46:49.190 --> 01:46:50.950]  I don't wanna be that guy that, you know,
[01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:53.070]  I'm breeding outside and I just screwed my neighbor
[01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:54.670]  and his livelihood up.
[01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:58.790]  So, you know, nature, sun, powerful thing.
[01:46:58.790 --> 01:47:01.910]  I think that you can do absolutely amazing work.
[01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:03.470]  You know, you just kind of have to be aware
[01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:05.190]  of what you're doing, why you're doing it,
[01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:06.550]  and your intentions, because, you know,
[01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:08.630]  there's just a lot of people that have seen devastation
[01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:10.550]  over the last, you know, three, four years,
[01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:11.830]  especially down in Southern Oregon.
[01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:13.310]  I know it's happening in California
[01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:15.030]  and California has actually done regional zones
[01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:17.070]  but you can't do hemp for that reason.
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:19.590]  But unfortunately I've seen a lot of loss
[01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:21.270]  and, you know, it's nothing, you know,
[01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:23.030]  I grew up in the East Coast smoking, you know,
[01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:24.830]  Mexican brick weed, you know,
[01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:27.030]  and there's nothing worse than a bunch of seeds
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:29.870]  that you can weed that are not intentional.
[01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:34.350]  Ray, do you wanna touch on that a little bit?
[01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:36.510]  Yeah, I mean, hemp or pollen
[01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:39.470]  could actually travel up to 2000 miles
[01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:42.390]  just based on, you know, how moist your climate is.
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:46.590]  If it's a dry wind, it can travel for quite a ways.
[01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:49.030]  You know, I was one of the people who right in the years
[01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:52.270]  initially educating the Department of Ag in Oregon
[01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:54.470]  about, you know, cross pollination
[01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:56.070]  and how it's gonna go down.
[01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.230]  And that's, and originally they wanted us
[01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:00.230]  to all grow from fem stock.
[01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:02.470]  That was the way that they explained it to me.
[01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:06.350]  And I was like, no, hitting the letter on, you know,
[01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:08.950]  all the pitfalls of working with feminized seed.
[01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:10.830]  But, you know, if you're gonna be breeding
[01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:13.390]  outside these days, it really is a challenge.
[01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:14.710]  It really, no matter where you're at,
[01:48:14.710 --> 01:48:16.830]  because so many people are actually growing.
[01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:19.950]  I mean, you have no way to control what, you know,
[01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:21.230]  what can vector on your plants.
[01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:23.230]  You know, is that pollen the pollen you put on there?
[01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:26.510]  Is it, you know, is it from your neighbor down the road?
[01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:27.670]  You just don't know.
[01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:28.510]  So really these days-
[01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:30.150]  Growing in the off season.
[01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:30.990]  What's that?
[01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:33.150]  Growing in the off season.
[01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:35.430]  Ooh.
[01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:36.270]  Say it again.
[01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:38.670]  I think there's a lot of benefits
[01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:40.470]  to growing in the off season.
[01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:42.590]  Seed cultivation.
[01:48:44.110 --> 01:48:46.230]  I just, you know, there's, it depends on the region too.
[01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:49.150]  I think California, Oregon, Colorado, you know,
[01:48:49.150 --> 01:48:51.950]  you're in danger if you go in the regular summer
[01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:52.910]  full term season,
[01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:55.830]  you're running the risk of cross contamination.
[01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:57.590]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:00.870]  But one of the benefits from a seed outside,
[01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:04.070]  they just have so much protective coating.
[01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:09.070]  And for some reason, I feel like the seed stocks viable
[01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:12.830]  for a lot longer than sometimes what's produced indoors.
[01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:14.910]  It just seems like a heartier seed stock.
[01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:19.150]  Your beans are a lot, you know, they're dark, they're oily.
[01:49:19.150 --> 01:49:19.990]  They have, you know,
[01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:22.510]  they're ready to be stored for quite a long time.
[01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:23.630]  They don't crush easily.
[01:49:23.630 --> 01:49:24.470]  They're dense.
[01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:25.830]  Yeah. They're amazing.
[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:27.510]  When you have a really good outdoor, you know,
[01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:29.830]  successful, you know, breeding project going on
[01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:31.630]  when it comes to that.
[01:49:31.630 --> 01:49:33.750]  And I think the size of the seed,
[01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:36.230]  really that's dependent on the varietal.
[01:49:36.230 --> 01:49:37.390]  You know, it's genetic.
[01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:38.750]  You know, we know that.
[01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:40.670]  But I don't think that growing outside
[01:49:40.670 --> 01:49:42.510]  is gonna really produce bigger seeds
[01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:46.030]  than what that same variety would do indoors.
[01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:49.750]  Well, the one thing I would say about that is pistil though,
[01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.230]  because a lot of times when you have that outdoor expression
[01:49:52.230 --> 01:49:54.350]  your pistil and your vacuole is a little larger.
[01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:56.750]  So when it does accept that pollen, you know,
[01:49:58.150 --> 01:49:59.110]  I definitely kind of,
[01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:01.670]  cause I did the same exact plants side by side,
[01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:03.950]  time by time, same like process.
[01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:06.470]  And, but when you looked at the overall expression
[01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:07.470]  in the outdoor flower,
[01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:09.790]  it was larger when it received that pollen.
[01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:11.510]  So maybe that plays in, but you know,
[01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:13.390]  that's just me being a speculator.
[01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:15.910]  I would say my thought on that would be that
[01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:18.430]  if you take a plant grown indoors and outdoors,
[01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:20.550]  if you're growing under high pressure lights
[01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:23.590]  that are intense lights, you're gonna get a,
[01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:25.110]  you know, much denser bud.
[01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:27.190]  And so the seeds aren't gonna get as big
[01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:29.910]  because the calyx gets so much more swollen
[01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:32.630]  on indoor crops than outdoor crops typically.
[01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:35.350]  So, I mean, that's my experience going with,
[01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:37.550]  you know, I've only, I haven't done other tests,
[01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:40.550]  but I've done side by side that one time, two years ago.
[01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:44.150]  And I mean, significantly different seeds, same shape,
[01:50:44.150 --> 01:50:47.350]  but actually bigger seeds outdoors.
[01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:49.390]  Well, and it also with the fluorescent,
[01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:51.630]  you'll get a smaller, lighter seed that the breeders
[01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:53.270]  that worked with us that use fluorescents,
[01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:55.350]  there's definitely a difference between the seed,
[01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:57.990]  the appearance of the seed between fluorescent,
[01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:00.790]  metal halide and outdoor.
[01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:03.150]  The color and the size,
[01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:05.910]  maybe not quite as much difference
[01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:10.190]  between the high pressure or the high pressure sodium
[01:51:10.190 --> 01:51:12.790]  versus outdoor versus fluorescent
[01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:14.510]  versus high pressure sodium.
[01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:16.870]  But most definitely on the fluorescents,
[01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:19.470]  they're much lighter and smaller.
[01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:20.310]  And they actually-
[01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:21.910]  It's the same thing.
[01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:22.910]  You know, that's one of the things
[01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:25.710]  when I made a bunch of seed with the LEC630
[01:51:25.710 --> 01:51:27.510]  when they came out and I actually gave him the sub,
[01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:28.590]  he was like, oh, these aren't done.
[01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:30.350]  And I was like, no, they have a hundred percent germ rate.
[01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:32.030]  They're just a lot lighter.
[01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:35.230]  You know, so all the seeds were viable,
[01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:36.190]  but he was just like, no, no,
[01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:37.830]  they don't have deep dark tiger striping.
[01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:39.550]  I'm just like, they're just grown
[01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:41.350]  under a less dense lighting.
[01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:44.190]  And yes, absolutely, Jill's 100% right with that.
[01:51:46.670 --> 01:51:50.070]  So let's kind of talk about what you guys are doing now.
[01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:52.430]  Jill, you want to talk about your new projects?
[01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:59.470]  I just released a feminized line from my purple Afghani.
[01:52:00.230 --> 01:52:02.510]  Those have come out really good through the year
[01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:04.710]  now that they've been running.
[01:52:04.710 --> 01:52:08.470]  I'm working on finishing out testing on jelly bean line.
[01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:11.250]  Like I had said earlier, I have some flavors.
[01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:13.870]  I'm using a jelly bean mill
[01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:17.150]  and crossing it with several different things.
[01:52:17.150 --> 01:52:19.310]  And so I have some in testing right now
[01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:21.390]  and I have more still coming
[01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:24.850]  than I'm going to be making from that as far as regular.
[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:29.690]  I have a collaboration with the Gorilla Glue family.
[01:52:29.690 --> 01:52:31.930]  So we have jelly glue.
[01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:33.890]  Right now I've made it in regular
[01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:36.810]  and this fall or winter,
[01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:38.850]  I'm going to be doing a feminized run
[01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:42.610]  and making a lot of the jelly bean candy flavors,
[01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:47.290]  fruit flavors, feminized as well as jelly glue feminized.
[01:52:47.290 --> 01:52:49.490]  And then I'm going to go back and work
[01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:50.890]  on the Agent Orange line
[01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:54.770]  and a few of the other old TGA strains.
[01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:58.690]  I just finished, I'll have released at the end of the week,
[01:52:58.690 --> 01:53:00.930]  Plush Fairy with the original parents
[01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:04.090]  and Queen Anne's Revenge with the original parents.
[01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:07.650]  And I just, it's,
[01:53:08.670 --> 01:53:10.810]  I call it previously known as Quirkle.
[01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:13.170]  It's still the same cross.
[01:53:13.170 --> 01:53:15.090]  It's a different phenotype of purple Urkel.
[01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:18.350]  This one came from CSI Humboldt as his breeding mom.
[01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:21.530]  So I would assume it to be as good or better
[01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:22.930]  but it still has to go through testing
[01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:27.330]  because it's different mom, same male and also the flave.
[01:53:27.330 --> 01:53:28.890]  I'm using a peach Romulan now
[01:53:28.890 --> 01:53:31.610]  which came from Radio Ridge Nursery.
[01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:34.250]  So of course that has to also be in testing
[01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:39.250]  and a new cross with T-1000 and Space Queen as well.
[01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:42.330]  Awesome, so where can people get your seeds
[01:53:42.330 --> 01:53:44.450]  if they're interested in purchasing them?
[01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:48.290]  I have a website and on my website, there's a vendor list
[01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:50.930]  and all of those vendors should have stock
[01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:53.490]  and if they don't just let them know.
[01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:57.890]  Awesome, so Jinx, let's talk about autism awareness.
[01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:59.370]  You know, you've been doing that for a long time.
[01:53:59.370 --> 01:54:01.650]  If you wanna dive into that and also Oklahoma,
[01:54:01.650 --> 01:54:03.650]  I heard you've been working in Oklahoma.
[01:54:07.150 --> 01:54:09.830]  I think you're muted, lower left-hand side.
[01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:13.390]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:16.030]  Yeah, definitely, that's always been a passion of ours
[01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:18.630]  since our son became autistic.
[01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:21.150]  A lot of people don't know that a lot of children
[01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:23.190]  aren't born autistic, they become autistic.
[01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:25.670]  It's a very common thing,
[01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:27.030]  and I think that's one of the things
[01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:28.790]  that's really, really important.
[01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:30.910]  I mean, when we started out,
[01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:33.790]  I think it was around the time when my son was born.
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:38.790]  I think my son, Jinxie Jr. was 100% typical child,
[01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:40.750]  beyond typical, you know what I mean?
[01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:42.830]  As far as what he would eat, what he would do,
[01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:45.350]  you know, meeting all the mile markers and all that.
[01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:48.590]  And then one day we noticed he just started changing,
[01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:50.470]  he stopped eating, like even now,
[01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:52.630]  he only eats a couple of things.
[01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.950]  He's a big deal, you know what I mean?
[01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:57.310]  Then all of a sudden we noticed he wasn't eating anything.
[01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:59.470]  And a lot of autistic people call it the brown diet.
[01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:00.910]  They only eat things that are brown,
[01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:05.110]  chicken nuggets, cookies, French fries, stuff like that.
[01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:09.670]  So, you know, there wasn't a lot of info on it.
[01:55:09.670 --> 01:55:14.670]  So, you know, with the mercy of the internet
[01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:18.150]  and stuff like that, we just started researching ourselves
[01:55:18.150 --> 01:55:20.550]  because doctors were trying to give us pills
[01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:21.630]  that were just not good.
[01:55:21.630 --> 01:55:23.350]  One of them was the Risperdal,
[01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:26.470]  which makes men grow lactating breast, you know?
[01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:28.790]  And Fight Club, that's the drug
[01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:31.590]  that Meat Loaf mentions he's using, you know?
[01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:32.670]  What do they call them?
[01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:34.070]  Big Tits Bob or whatever.
[01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:36.150]  And, you know, so we were about to give our kid that.
[01:55:36.150 --> 01:55:40.110]  So we started indulging in the internet,
[01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:42.830]  the cannabis community and stuff like that,
[01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:46.110]  and just trying to deal with it ourselves.
[01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:49.670]  Because of that, we started to run into so many families.
[01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:51.910]  If you mention autism somewhere,
[01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:55.230]  somebody will say, oh, my cousin or my friend's kid.
[01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.470]  I mean, it's an epidemic now.
[01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:59.870]  So we were running into so many families
[01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:01.910]  that weren't as fortunate as us.
[01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:04.830]  So that's when I approached Sub,
[01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:06.750]  like, you know, let's do a charity show.
[01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.190]  And like, you know, I was showing you guys earlier,
[01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:09.110]  Odie knows what's up.
[01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:12.150]  That's my, you know, some cool school of day.
[01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:16.270]  And me, Sub, Jill, Odie, Dioxide,
[01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:17.990]  you know, a bunch of us, we put together a show
[01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:20.470]  where you paid 60 bucks to get in.
[01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:22.350]  Sub was gonna teach you just about everything
[01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:23.790]  he knew about growing.
[01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:26.190]  Odie and, I'm sorry, Pat,
[01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:28.190]  I can't remember if you were there or not.
[01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:30.510]  Oh, he's muted, sorry.
[01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:31.870]  Sorry, Pat, you're muted.
[01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:33.670]  I wasn't there at that.
[01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:36.950]  No, I was out of town, but definitely I very clearly
[01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:38.750]  remember Dioxide and everyone going out to it.
[01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:41.110]  Yeah, fortunately my epilepsy makes me forget everything.
[01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:43.190]  But we did this awesome show.
[01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:47.110]  Bob Snodgrass showed up and Blue Glass.
[01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:49.670]  We'd have like recesses from the show.
[01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:51.470]  We had this upstairs where you could go smoke.
[01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:55.230]  It was kind of like a rooftop with a big fireplace.
[01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:56.550]  You know, it was just such a good time.
[01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:00.790]  And I think the first time we raised like $35,000
[01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:03.870]  and instead of paying for the venue,
[01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:06.830]  through the money we raised, like we had sponsors,
[01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:08.350]  like it kind of like a mini cup.
[01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:10.310]  You could have a booth there and stuff like that.
[01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:13.590]  So none of the money got taken away from the kids,
[01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:14.630]  you know, stuff like that.
[01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:16.950]  And it was very successful.
[01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:19.910]  I waited about a year and I looked at Sub,
[01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:20.910]  I said, let's do it again.
[01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:21.830]  He's like, let's do it.
[01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:22.870]  And we did it again.
[01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:25.990]  And it was super awesome and all that.
[01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:29.390]  Most of that money, a lot of autistic kids are nonverbal.
[01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:32.550]  Like my son has an iPad and it's got a little program on it
[01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:34.750]  where he could push pictures
[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:38.030]  and the computer will then say those pictures.
[01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:40.430]  Like he like, I want chicken nuggets.
[01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:41.550]  I want chicken nuggets.
[01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:43.470]  Like you can even add pictures.
[01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:44.870]  Like I could take a picture of Pat
[01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:47.830]  and he could be like, you know, I want to see Pat.
[01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:50.150]  And autistic kids tend to mimic.
[01:57:50.150 --> 01:57:52.750]  So now my son, a lot of those things he was typing to me,
[01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:55.110]  he now comes up and says to me, you know,
[01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:57.510]  he's still nonverbal, but he's verbal.
[01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:59.470]  He can communicate.
[01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:01.870]  And he won't sit down and have a conversation with you,
[01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:03.550]  but he can figure out how to tell you something
[01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:05.190]  that's because of that.
[01:58:05.190 --> 01:58:07.990]  You know, so that was our main thing was, you know,
[01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:12.070]  helping getting that iPad and the program is 350 bucks,
[01:58:12.110 --> 01:58:15.030]  you know, so getting that in the hands of nonverbal kids.
[01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:18.950]  And if, you know, if your kid is five, six years old
[01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:22.670]  and you've never heard them speak, it's a big deal.
[01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:24.070]  You know, it's a huge deal, you know?
[01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:25.750]  So that's where we started.
[01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:29.270]  And, you know, the autism community
[01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:32.790]  or the cannabis community was so giving, you know,
[01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:36.510]  before this Rose and I tried to do charities
[01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:38.830]  and we tried to hit up businesses and stuff like that.
[01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:39.670]  And it was terrible.
[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:40.510]  It was offensive.
[01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:41.870]  It was brutal.
[01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:43.710]  I mean, like I say, that first show, you know,
[01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:46.870]  in a week and we raised $35,000, you know,
[01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:51.230]  I do a lot of auctions, you know, people donate me stuff.
[01:58:51.230 --> 01:58:52.950]  I'll throw in some packs of seeds, you know,
[01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:54.910]  pads started before too, we'll have an auction.
[01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:57.590]  And we'll easily get up, you know, seven, 900 bucks,
[01:58:57.590 --> 01:58:59.110]  you know, and then there's, you know,
[01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:00.990]  there's two more iPads or, you know,
[01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:02.790]  we don't only help autistic kids.
[01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:04.350]  We don't only do iPads.
[01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:08.790]  We had a guy, his daughter had cerebral palsy
[01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.150]  and she was probably six, I would guess.
[01:59:11.150 --> 01:59:12.990]  And had never walked ever.
[01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:15.190]  So we got him this thing called a Firefly
[01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.550]  and he puts it on like a pair of pants
[01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:20.630]  and it's got these big tubes and he drops her in there
[01:59:20.630 --> 01:59:22.270]  and he can walk around with her.
[01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:24.190]  You know, he sent us a video.
[01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.710]  The kid is just like, you know, she's never walked
[01:59:26.710 --> 01:59:29.030]  and now she's walking, you know, so it's,
[01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:30.990]  and it's all because of the cannabis community.
[01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:32.990]  Whenever we go to shows, you know,
[01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:35.550]  we put out this little glass house
[01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:36.750]  and if you want a sticker,
[01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:38.750]  you got to drop a dollar in there, you know.
[01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:40.750]  Stickers are expensive, you guys know that.
[01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:43.390]  But, you know, it's very common for somebody to come up
[01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:45.150]  and drop a hundred bucks in there and, you know,
[01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:45.990]  stuff like that.
[01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:47.550]  And, you know, like I said,
[01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:50.150]  there's no community that we've dealt with
[01:59:50.150 --> 01:59:54.750]  that was just so giving like the cannabis community.
[01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:56.510]  And, you know, I would imagine we're up
[01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:59.110]  to about $150,000 now that we've raised for kids.
[01:59:59.110 --> 02:00:01.070]  We're a legal 501c3.
[02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:03.710]  So all the money gets reported where it's going
[02:00:03.710 --> 02:00:04.550]  and stuff like that.
[02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:07.150]  So there's no kind of, you know, hubbub with any of that.
[02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:08.750]  It's been great.
[02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:10.790]  Rose hates it.
[02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:11.750]  It's kind of funny.
[02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:15.470]  Y'all know I do my positive videos every day.
[02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:17.270]  You know, if any of you have ever been on my page,
[02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:18.150]  you've seen that.
[02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.070]  There's only one negative video,
[02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:24.590]  eight, 10 years, whatever it's been.
[02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:27.710]  There's only one negative video and we're at a show
[02:00:27.710 --> 02:00:29.270]  and I was talking to this guy and I was like,
[02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:32.710]  yeah, man, we got this big house here and it's full of...
[02:00:33.710 --> 02:00:36.190]  The fucking thing was gone.
[02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:38.750]  You know, some tweaker or something stole it.
[02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:40.590]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:42.190]  So I made a video and I was like,
[02:00:42.190 --> 02:00:44.470]  you motherfucker, I'll fucking kill you.
[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:49.230]  Rose called me, was like, honey, please take that video down.
[02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:51.430]  I was like, I'll never take that video down.
[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:53.870]  You know, the good thing was
[02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:55.310]  because having a decent social media,
[02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:57.150]  a bunch of people showed up the next day
[02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:59.670]  and made like some very generous donations
[02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:01.990]  and got that house full back up again.
[02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:04.390]  So, you know, it's pretty cool.
[02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:05.430]  We enjoy it.
[02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:07.030]  I call it crack for the soul.
[02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:08.750]  You know, I mean, I love it.
[02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:11.670]  A lot of times we get to drop the iPads off
[02:01:11.670 --> 02:01:14.830]  or whatever we're doing for these people in person.
[02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:16.390]  You know, so you get to meet the kids
[02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:17.910]  or the family and stuff.
[02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:20.590]  And it's always just so rewarding.
[02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:22.070]  And, you know, these people will be family
[02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:25.390]  and friends for life and, you know, it's so awesome.
[02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:28.190]  And I never would have been able to do it
[02:01:28.190 --> 02:01:31.510]  without the cannabis community.
[02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:34.190]  You know, and I made a video one time too,
[02:01:34.190 --> 02:01:37.310]  thanking Sub because, you know, nobody knew who I was
[02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:40.190]  and Sub gave me that stage to stand on, you know,
[02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:42.270]  which started all this and, you know,
[02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:44.750]  I'll forever be grateful for him for that.
[02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:47.150]  And, you know, and because of that, you know,
[02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:49.070]  created my own social media and got things rolling
[02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:50.990]  and, you know, we'll do it till the day we die.
[02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.830]  I don't care.
[02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:52.670]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:52.670 --> 02:01:55.270]  So, but on the other note,
[02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:59.110]  cannabis can be very productive for kids with autism,
[02:01:59.110 --> 02:02:01.430]  you know, used correctly and stuff like that.
[02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:04.950]  Mellowing out, a lot of autistic kids
[02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.150]  have what's called meltdowns
[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:07.870]  where they're just freaking out, you know,
[02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:12.350]  and some anxiety, some good RSO or some clear oil
[02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:14.030]  will totally help that.
[02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:16.310]  And, you know, just like a little dose in the morning,
[02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:17.590]  you don't wait till it's happening.
[02:02:17.590 --> 02:02:19.590]  Kind of like you'd take a daily vitamin.
[02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:23.470]  Eating, I noticed, you know, snuggling,
[02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:24.310]  the kids are way more,
[02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:26.110]  a lot of autistic kids don't like to be touched.
[02:02:26.110 --> 02:02:26.950]  You know what I mean?
[02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:31.070]  Like way more snuggly, just, you know, so many benefits.
[02:02:31.710 --> 02:02:34.190]  Like I said, we get so many letters
[02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:35.990]  from people who have also been affected by it,
[02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:38.030]  not just by us, but in general, you know,
[02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:40.350]  helping their kids with cannabis and stuff like that.
[02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:42.750]  So it's been a great thing.
[02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:45.070]  And the funny thing about this shirt
[02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:47.470]  is obviously that's a picture of Sub
[02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:49.670]  that I went and visited at one time
[02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:51.230]  and he got a tattoo of it.
[02:02:52.110 --> 02:02:55.110]  He put a baseball, backwards baseball hat with TGA on it.
[02:02:55.110 --> 02:02:56.310]  And he's like, you know,
[02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:58.590]  I always thought that kind of looked like me.
[02:02:59.110 --> 02:03:02.670]  I was like, you big dummy, that is you.
[02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:06.550]  I mean, look at the little soul patch.
[02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:09.270]  It was so funny.
[02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:11.030]  He's getting a tattooed on his arm.
[02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:14.750]  So James, where can people go
[02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:16.670]  if they want to hear more about autism
[02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:21.670]  or find out where they can donate money or time?
[02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:23.790]  There's, if they want to donate to us,
[02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:26.230]  our, like I said, we're a legal 501C.
[02:03:26.230 --> 02:03:28.510]  We're called Northwest Families for Autism.
[02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:30.230]  There's a link in our bio.
[02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:32.070]  We do have a Facebook page.
[02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:33.750]  You can always hit up Ms. Rose.
[02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:36.870]  I believe there's a link in her bio or just DM me.
[02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:40.430]  You know, we're not always looking for donations.
[02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:43.230]  We're also, you know, looking for people in need.
[02:03:43.230 --> 02:03:44.070]  You know what I mean?
[02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.910]  A lot of these kids we've helped
[02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:47.070]  have been people that have DMed me and, you know,
[02:03:47.070 --> 02:03:48.910]  and have asked, sorry.
[02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:52.670]  There's a, also we have a new website,
[02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:55.070]  jinksproofsdankbank.com.
[02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:56.670]  There's a link in that website also.
[02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:57.750]  So you can donate there too.
[02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:59.550]  So, but like I said, it's not just about money.
[02:03:59.550 --> 02:04:01.070]  It's also about finding these kids
[02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:02.830]  and people that need the help too.
[02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:04.710]  So, you know, we just love it.
[02:04:04.710 --> 02:04:05.550]  I love it.
[02:04:05.550 --> 02:04:06.390]  You know what I mean?
[02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:09.110]  Like, and it's not only about autism, it's about kids.
[02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:09.950]  You know what I mean?
[02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:14.830]  We donated four iPads to this family that has four kids
[02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:19.150]  and every single kid in that family is deaf, 100%.
[02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:20.310]  They can only talk to each other.
[02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:23.070]  Only 1% of the planet speaks sign language.
[02:04:23.070 --> 02:04:25.430]  But now with that app, you know,
[02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:27.350]  they can now speak to their friends,
[02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:29.350]  to people at school, to, you know,
[02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:31.150]  and it's so awesome.
[02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:32.710]  I just love it.
[02:04:32.710 --> 02:04:34.550]  It's changed me a lot too.
[02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:35.390]  You know what I mean?
[02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:39.510]  So, but yeah, the sites in our social media
[02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:41.550]  are the best places to find out how to donate.
[02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:43.070]  And it's not just money too.
[02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:44.430]  People donate stuff.
[02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:45.790]  Every time I see Mammoth P,
[02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:48.830]  they give me one of them big old bottles that cost $400
[02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:53.350]  or Fishit sent me a case or Glassblowers have sent me glass.
[02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:56.110]  You know, fellow seed breeders have sent me packs of seeds
[02:04:56.110 --> 02:04:57.230]  and it all adds up.
[02:04:57.230 --> 02:04:59.230]  And, you know, like I said, I do those auctions
[02:04:59.230 --> 02:05:01.430]  and it turns out to be a good deal.
[02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:04.710]  And, you know, you feel pretty damn good doing it.
[02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:07.110]  You know, like I said, I call it crack for the soul.
[02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:09.230]  Awesome.
[02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:12.630]  Well, so Pat, let's get into some of the stuff
[02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:13.590]  about Heroes of the Farm.
[02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:16.710]  I know you've been breeding a feminized regular
[02:05:16.710 --> 02:05:19.270]  and also hemp seed.
[02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:20.750]  Do you wanna share with us a little bit
[02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:23.870]  about your current stuff that you're working on?
[02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:24.710]  Yeah.
[02:05:24.710 --> 02:05:28.950]  So over the last year, I've still, you know,
[02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:32.830]  we don't really have a bunch of distributed stuff right now.
[02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:35.750]  I have a huge safe full of seeds
[02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:38.030]  and a bunch of stuff in testing.
[02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:41.310]  Ray's son, Mushmouth Donovan, Donnie,
[02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:43.510]  he and I have done a couple of projects
[02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:47.790]  over the last year of regular stuff, you know,
[02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:49.550]  and we're just gonna start searching through it
[02:05:49.590 --> 02:05:51.070]  this winter and spring.
[02:05:51.070 --> 02:05:54.470]  But we created probably 12 different new varieties,
[02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:58.950]  stuff that is already in-house, some homegrown stuff.
[02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:02.990]  We used Irish Cush on that, or I'm sorry, Irish Stout,
[02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:08.190]  which basically is a Guinness cross with red rocket.
[02:06:08.190 --> 02:06:11.230]  We hunted out a pretty amazing male of that
[02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:15.110]  out of, I think it was about four or 500 plants.
[02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:16.790]  It was a hard selection.
[02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:20.110]  And then I've got another spot that Donnie ran.
[02:06:20.110 --> 02:06:21.950]  So we've got a laundry list there.
[02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:24.790]  And then I know you know Nick Strumberg.
[02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:29.430]  Nick is absolutely one of the most intellectual people
[02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:33.630]  and intelligent breeders and plant people that I know.
[02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:36.030]  You know, he owns Beacon Hemp.
[02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:38.030]  You know, he's got a lot of different auto varieties,
[02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:40.910]  not only for THC, but also hemp.
[02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:43.870]  You know, and him and I kind of cultivated a relationship
[02:06:43.870 --> 02:06:48.870]  through my interaction with Dennis Hunter and Canna Craft,
[02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:51.030]  a little bit of the Cookies family stuff.
[02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:54.870]  He was the head cultivator for them.
[02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:58.030]  And we were doing a massive hunt of a bunch of my gear
[02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:59.310]  and five other breeders stuff.
[02:06:59.310 --> 02:07:00.870]  And it was awesome to see an acre
[02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:03.950]  of all these different genetics.
[02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:07.230]  It was really cool that a lot of my stuff stood out.
[02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:10.110]  And through just talking about IPM
[02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:11.790]  and all of our different techniques,
[02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:15.550]  we really kind of formed a good relationship and friendship,
[02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:19.550]  which eventually kind of, you know, two years ago bred,
[02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:22.070]  you know, or led us to breeding some hemp seeds
[02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:23.390]  for Beacon Hemp.
[02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:27.310]  He's been working on his hemp line since 2013.
[02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:30.270]  I've got obviously a lot of greenhouse space.
[02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:32.630]  So we started, you know, just kind of working a few
[02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:35.190]  of his different lines while at the same time,
[02:07:35.190 --> 02:07:37.590]  kind of creating some of our own.
[02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:41.030]  So Auto Tsunami, you know,
[02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:44.230]  I've got a list of them that we've been working on.
[02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:46.990]  One of the really cool things that him and I just did
[02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:49.990]  is we just worked with Oregon State
[02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:52.670]  and they came out through a certification process.
[02:07:52.670 --> 02:07:56.150]  And we have the first two auto hemp varieties
[02:07:56.150 --> 02:07:59.590]  that are certified in the nation by Oregon State.
[02:07:59.590 --> 02:08:01.030]  We're just threshing them right now
[02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:03.990]  and they're going to go out to do the final certification
[02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:05.830]  and testing process.
[02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.190]  So that's a pretty cool process, you know,
[02:08:08.190 --> 02:08:10.870]  to have the university come out here.
[02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:13.430]  You know, it's fortunate that it is in Oregon.
[02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:17.750]  It can really kind of only happen in Oregon currently.
[02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:21.310]  So, you know, they came out six times, you know,
[02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:23.550]  they basically, they expect, they, you know,
[02:08:23.550 --> 02:08:25.270]  inspect your crop to make sure
[02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:28.990]  you don't have mass variation, you know.
[02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:30.270]  And then the other thing that, you know,
[02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:33.750]  we do is you have to have basically third-party testing
[02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:37.230]  for fem rates, you know, for germination rates.
[02:08:37.230 --> 02:08:41.030]  So you send out basically a 500 gram seed sample,
[02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:43.150]  you know, and they basically do all of the testing.
[02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:46.470]  So it's not like, oh bro, they're fem, just trust me
[02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:49.390]  because we all know how that works, you know.
[02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.430]  And with the feminization techniques that, you know,
[02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:56.030]  he's developed that he's kind of taught me, you know,
[02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:59.430]  we were able to really get a solid feminized.
[02:09:00.590 --> 02:09:03.470]  I think a lot of people, especially on this page,
[02:09:04.150 --> 02:09:04.990]  you know, we all knew originally
[02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:07.070]  how sub felt about feminization,
[02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:10.270]  but at that time period, you know,
[02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:12.310]  there was a lot of bad technique going on.
[02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:14.150]  I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding
[02:09:14.150 --> 02:09:19.150]  that if, you know, a plant herms that it's feminized,
[02:09:19.230 --> 02:09:21.950]  that can lead to a lot of more problems.
[02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:23.870]  Some of the stress techniques, you know,
[02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:24.990]  obviously don't work.
[02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:26.750]  And there's a few different sprays that you can use
[02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:28.790]  that basically are a polyethylene blocker
[02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:30.910]  and block out the chromosome.
[02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:35.030]  So essentially you come out with feminized seeds.
[02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:37.070]  Using those same techniques, you know,
[02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:39.710]  Nick and I are developing some other lines.
[02:09:39.710 --> 02:09:41.590]  We're starting the heroes journey.
[02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:44.350]  It's, you know, kind of California
[02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:47.150]  and a couple other states to be able to legally
[02:09:47.150 --> 02:09:50.550]  to distribute, you know, where I've kind of backed off
[02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:53.870]  on some stuff is with the OLCC, you know,
[02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:56.150]  they are watching this and you think
[02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:59.830]  they're not watching your page, they are, you know.
[02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:02.430]  So we are trying to get into these markets
[02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:04.390]  where we can get into legal nurseries
[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:06.390]  so we can do distribute this stuff, you know,
[02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:08.670]  without having to look over our shoulders.
[02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:13.630]  So right now, you know, 8541 is basically,
[02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:16.110]  that's part of the address of my old house.
[02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:19.350]  It is a Raspberry Cush times Guinness,
[02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:23.550]  which is basically, you know, the back cross of Scooby,
[02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:26.510]  which would be mystery back into Scooby.
[02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:29.430]  And again, that mail is just amazing.
[02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:33.910]  8541, we hunted out of, I think, you know, about 500
[02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:38.110]  and we just came out with this really amazing stable plant.
[02:10:38.110 --> 02:10:40.590]  It captured exactly what I was looking to do.
[02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:42.670]  It brought out the bag appeal
[02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:45.230]  and the look of the Raspberry Cush,
[02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:46.710]  but it brought our numbers up
[02:10:46.710 --> 02:10:49.830]  and added a little bit of a fruity funk to it.
[02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:51.030]  And pretty much, you know,
[02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:55.390]  in terms of the stabilization rates with that,
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:56.670]  it's been absolutely awesome.
[02:10:56.670 --> 02:11:00.830]  So we've got a lot of different gear out testing right now,
[02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:02.230]  working on some new logos
[02:11:02.230 --> 02:11:05.070]  and we'll probably realistically launch, you know,
[02:11:05.070 --> 02:11:07.870]  this winter or very beginning of spring next year,
[02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:11.350]  but definitely some larger scale products or projects
[02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:13.750]  where, you know, we're working with a lot of growers
[02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:16.510]  in California for full facilities,
[02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:18.710]  because, you know, one of the things
[02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:21.310]  that's really been an issue in the industry
[02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:24.070]  is HPLVD, the hoplate and thyroid.
[02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:26.390]  You know, as soon as I saw it
[02:11:27.110 --> 02:11:29.190]  in the Dark Heart article last year about it,
[02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:30.870]  I was like, oh, I've seen that.
[02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:32.830]  Like I've seen it time and time again,
[02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:35.710]  brittle stems breaking, you know, you've got a plant,
[02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:37.870]  sometimes it's the entire plant,
[02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:39.830]  sometimes it's just a few branches,
[02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:42.270]  but it's passed on through, you know,
[02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:44.670]  dirty, you know, tools, cuttings.
[02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:47.310]  It also can be passed on, you know,
[02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:49.510]  through plants rubbing against each other.
[02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:51.350]  So when we've, you know,
[02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:54.390]  constantly been passing these cuts around globally,
[02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:55.670]  it becomes an issue.
[02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:58.230]  And if you look at, you know, any other industry,
[02:11:58.230 --> 02:12:01.510]  they're either going from seed or plantlet.
[02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:04.150]  You know, there are some good companies out there now
[02:12:04.150 --> 02:12:06.710]  that are offering, you know, plantlets,
[02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.230]  but they're usually pretty expensive.
[02:12:08.230 --> 02:12:10.270]  So a lot of growers are actually going
[02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:12.750]  towards the feminized seed route, you know,
[02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:16.270]  to avoid those issues, less IPM,
[02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:19.270]  and you get, of course, the seed vigor,
[02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:20.990]  but it's definitely a process to get there
[02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:22.830]  to do it correctly.
[02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:24.990]  And, you know, I have absolute confidence
[02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:26.630]  in our technique.
[02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:29.830]  You know, Nick has his degree from UC Davis,
[02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:31.030]  so does his wife.
[02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:32.830]  You know, they both worked for General Hydroponics
[02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:34.390]  for a long time.
[02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:36.870]  Absolute, you know, ton of different experience
[02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:38.230]  in cultivation.
[02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:41.150]  So him and I kind of teamed up on some projects.
[02:12:41.150 --> 02:12:44.750]  We're working basically the head dog right now
[02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:47.630]  into an auto line, doing some collabs with, you know,
[02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:49.790]  the Runts family.
[02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:51.510]  So we're just kind of, you know,
[02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:55.070]  continuing working our line while at the same time,
[02:12:55.070 --> 02:12:57.350]  kind of going with the same techniques
[02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.630]  that I learned from Sub,
[02:12:58.630 --> 02:13:00.270]  where you've got to test everything.
[02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:02.670]  You've got to, you know, do it all.
[02:13:02.670 --> 02:13:05.310]  You know, I haven't been posting as much on social media.
[02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:06.790]  I'm just kind of over it.
[02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:08.910]  So you haven't been seeing a bunch of weed pictures
[02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:10.510]  and, you know, all the shit that I'm doing
[02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:13.710]  just because I just find it kind of a negative space.
[02:13:13.710 --> 02:13:15.190]  You know, I love sharing information
[02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:16.750]  and doing things like this,
[02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:19.430]  but people don't look, you know, to have conversations.
[02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:21.470]  They look to just kind of tear people apart
[02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:23.110]  and then pick that one thing and,
[02:13:23.110 --> 02:13:25.670]  oh, you said that, that's not right.
[02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:27.550]  And a lot of the conversation we've had today,
[02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:29.630]  you know, about, let's say,
[02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:32.470]  what about outdoor seeds versus indoor seeds?
[02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:33.790]  You know, we're all having, you know,
[02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:36.270]  our own hypothesis and speculation on this
[02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:38.030]  because the science is not caught up
[02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:39.630]  to what's actually going on.
[02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:42.790]  And I look forward to the continuation of the science
[02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:44.830]  and the discovery inside of the cannabis plant
[02:13:44.830 --> 02:13:47.110]  because she is not done teaching our community,
[02:13:47.110 --> 02:13:47.950]  that's for sure.
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.060]  Good stuff.
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.540]  Yeah, Nick and his wife are both amazing people.
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:55.220]  Yeah, it's rare that you have a couple
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:59.060]  that's just so highly skilled, especially with,
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:01.300]  you know, I saw Nick from the early stages
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.740]  of his feminized breeding to where he's at now.
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.580]  And he's just, you know, pushing boundaries on stuff,
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:08.020]  especially, you know, all the stuff I've learned
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.860]  from auto flower breeding is from him,
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:12.540]  passed down directly from him.
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:15.900]  It's like, I've learned so much stuff from him.
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:17.980]  Yeah, I saw your Skywalker this year
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:21.900]  and how to buddy's ranch and good work.
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.900]  Stuff, I mean, it's like, yeah.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.260]  And it's just getting better and better.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:29.780]  And I feel like that's how auto flowers,
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:31.660]  definitely auto flower for both hemp
[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:35.780]  and for high THC varieties, they're just improving
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:37.500]  and they're gonna get better and better every year.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:40.540]  The further we go away from that original root or Alice,
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:42.260]  things are just getting more amazing.
[02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:45.220]  And, you know, we're seeing stuff that tests at 26%
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.940]  cannabinoids and I mean, on scale,
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.660]  everything my buddy just did at yours was at 22%
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:52.740]  that he had tested.
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:57.740]  And it looks an absolute high quality flower, you know,
[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.460]  and when you look, especially at our region, you know,
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:02.860]  we're trying to avoid the rains
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.940]  and we're trying to get in and out.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.900]  And, you know, everyone that grows these, you know,
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:10.300]  in Oregon, we always grew in strength and size
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:12.060]  and Callie always grew in strength and numbers
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.420]  and strength and size is not the way to grow.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.660]  It's, you know, you can,
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:18.780]  if you look at your overall canopy density, you know,
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:21.780]  I can plant in, you know, either earlier or late,
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.660]  but with a lot more plants and end up with a lot,
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:26.980]  you know, a lot of product with a lot less problems
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:28.100]  with a lot less input.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:30.540]  So, I mean, I definitely am a massive believer
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:32.660]  in the future of the auto flowers
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:35.140]  for both sides of the industries.
[02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:37.820]  Yeah, yeah, we've done some amazing stuff together.
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:40.060]  You know, it's just, I can't wait to see what's next,
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:40.900]  you know?
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:43.500]  Yeah, yeah, Nick and Jen are absolutely awesome people
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:48.100]  and they're not, you know, known widely on the social media
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:51.300]  but if you are in Callie and, you know, you're in the scene,
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:53.500]  you know, they've done an absolute great job
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.340]  and, you know, they're definitely, you know,
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:58.020]  they're two people to look out for, for sure.
[02:15:58.020 --> 02:15:59.740]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:02.340]  So Ray, let's talk about you for a minute.
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.180]  Ray is one of the most passionate people
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:07.060]  as far as cannabis goes that I know.
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:11.260]  You know, I was there when Shord and Ray and Shane
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:15.380]  and Paul were doing the large-scale pheno hunts
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.180]  at Harborside where they were doing over,
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:20.260]  I think, 8,000 seeds they had germinated
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:24.060]  and I've worked with Ray again this summer on some projects
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:27.780]  and I just really feel that he has everything
[02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:29.700]  as far as passion for the sacred plant.
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:32.300]  That guy loves walking through gardens,
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:34.180]  loves smelling every plant.
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.060]  You know, I have slight allergies to it
[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:38.260]  so I can only do it for like about two hours at a time
[02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:40.740]  at the very most when I have to take a good break.
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:43.420]  Where Ray will just sit out there for hours
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.020]  smelling plants and smoking.
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:51.660]  So Ray, do you want to talk about, you know,
[02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:52.900]  what you're doing currently
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:55.740]  and are you ready to go to the Caribbean and work with me?
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.700]  Yeah, I can't wait till we go down to the Caribbean,
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:01.300]  for sure.
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:03.300]  Right at the moment, not a lot,
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:06.540]  still doing some testing, looking for some things.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:10.060]  We recently lost our males from our last project
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:12.180]  so we're kind of starting over
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:14.660]  and moving forward on a few different things.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:19.100]  So relooking and going through multiple strains
[02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:21.060]  that we made, just some one-offs.
[02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:22.420]  They won't be made again
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:24.260]  or could be made again kind of thing.
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:26.700]  So other than that, just, you know,
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:28.060]  having fun down here in Cali,
[02:17:28.060 --> 02:17:31.100]  getting to work on some larger scales.
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:32.700]  That's always exciting.
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:37.220]  Yeah, you know, enjoyed that little project
[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.940]  that we were doing up north there.
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:40.620]  That was a lot of fun.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:41.780]  And yeah, so hopefully soon
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:43.180]  be on some more of those with you,
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:47.060]  but, you know, just kicking back and chilling
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.620]  and enjoying life a little bit.
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:50.500]  Awesome.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:52.900]  So where can people go to buy your seeds?
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:59.340]  So Vagabond Seeds is a good place.
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:03.100]  So is Seeds Here Now, of course.
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:04.940]  We've been with them for a long time.
[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:07.660]  But that's pretty close to about it.
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:08.500]  Because like I said,
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:11.460]  we haven't made any new seeds this year
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:12.980]  and because we lost our males.
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:15.460]  So once all seeds of the Doctor Who
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:17.980]  or any of those are gone, that's it.
[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:19.780]  There are no more.
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:22.300]  We may be working some of those lines again,
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:24.220]  but the originals are done.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.940]  So let's talk about the Doctor Who real quick,
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:29.020]  because I love talking about the Doctor Who.
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.940]  It's a great cultivar.
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:32.500]  And, you know, it's like my,
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:34.180]  I didn't see the grape high chew.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.420]  You're one of the selections that you had
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:38.340]  that I saw from you for the first time,
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:40.660]  maybe a year and a half ago.
[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:44.740]  I was used to the more funky Doctor Who that had that,
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:49.460]  you know, it was definitely not the sweeter side.
[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:51.900]  So do you want to share a little bit
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:53.620]  about what went into the Doctor Who,
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.500]  you know, your breeding with that?
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:01.060]  You know, that was just something we were doing,
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:04.660]  my son Donovan wanted to do and my son Ray wanted to do.
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:09.020]  They were just big fans of the strains that we were using.
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:12.740]  So the time wreck to our mad scientist,
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:16.700]  the mad scientist was a sweet tooth by medicine woman,
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.180]  which medicine woman was a very well-known organ strain
[02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:25.420]  created for fibromyalgia and worked great for it
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:26.740]  and great for pains.
[02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:33.180]  But with the crossing of back to the mad scientist
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:37.100]  to the time wreck, Doctor Who just kind of was natural.
[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.460]  We all were big fans of it.
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:40.660]  But as far as the breeding of it,
[02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:44.580]  we were really medical.
[02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:45.980]  We did a lot of testing.
[02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:47.540]  We all used, they're an organ,
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:52.220]  we all used Pat over at Sunrise Analytical, Pat Marshall.
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:54.580]  You know, we all figured one lab was better
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:57.580]  than using a bunch of different lines, at least.
[02:19:57.580 --> 02:20:00.340]  If there was a skew, it was a consistent skew.
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:01.220]  It didn't matter.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:04.380]  You weren't looking, trying to compare five different labs
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:06.540]  and wondering why these numbers are so off.
[02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:09.580]  With using the same exact lab all the time,
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:11.620]  which Pat joined us at,
[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:13.380]  and there were several of us that all there,
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:15.460]  like I said, in Oregon that used them,
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:18.060]  we were able to follow along
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:22.220]  what we were hoping to pass along in our crosses.
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:25.300]  So science of it really helped us do a lot of that.
[02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:31.060]  With the Doctor Who, we were definitely looking
[02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:34.540]  for more medicinal relaxation
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:36.700]  that the mad scientist was known for,
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.660]  but with a little bit more oomph to it.
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:43.140]  So that's where the Time Wreck side came in.
[02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:45.700]  It was more sativa dominant, pretty quick.
[02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:50.020]  And yeah, they wound up blending well together.
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.140]  So with the Time Wreck side is where you get more
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:56.540]  of that sour, funky, rotten kind of thing going on
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:00.140]  to where with the mad scientist, yeah, not so much.
[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:03.940]  But there you also have the G13 in the lineage
[02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:05.460]  on the mad scientist side.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:09.700]  So there's some funk in the lineage and in the grandparents
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:12.500]  and it all just seemed to come out pretty well together.
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:14.420]  Awesome.
[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:17.100]  Awesome, well, thank you very much.
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:22.100]  And Shane, so we've been on a bunch of panels together,
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:23.860]  also with Ray.
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.620]  You have Sunny Chiba Seeds.
[02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:27.940]  What are you up to now with your seed company
[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.180]  and consulting and everything else that you're doing?
[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.980]  Well, as far as the seed company,
[02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:35.380]  I was doing some drops there for a while
[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:37.620]  and I have actually been down to drop
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:40.540]  for over a couple of years now, over two years really.
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:42.820]  So I've been making stuff.
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:44.620]  I've been doing a lot of little microbreeding
[02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:46.820]  and some larger scale projects,
[02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:49.540]  but you know what I've been doing
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:50.900]  for the past couple of years,
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:53.540]  driving the big shows on large scale cultivation.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:58.260]  So really recently this year, I got a new place
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.220]  and I had a little lab that I put together.
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:02.220]  And so it allowed me to really focus
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:05.180]  and start growing from seed again
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:06.820]  and bringing back my genetics.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.460]  So really that's what I'm doing right now.
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.700]  But I've been just trying to make it about
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:13.100]  what do I enjoy about cannabis?
[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.260]  It's not what the market wants or anything else.
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.420]  It's what do I want?
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:18.060]  So this year I've been having a lot of fun
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:21.700]  just going through stuff and finding old friends.
[02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:24.380]  I have like a black cherry lemon freeze
[02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:27.380]  that's beautiful, just the black cherry freeze.
[02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:28.740]  Just a few different things like that
[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:29.820]  that I've been whipping around.
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:33.020]  I have a airborne G13 by lemon freeze.
[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:36.100]  I have a black cherry by the purple paki,
[02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:40.180]  all males I'm working with, several other things.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:42.940]  So right now it's just making a lot of different things
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:45.740]  and bringing some of the old stuff back.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.180]  Eventually I'm working towards doing drops again,
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:51.260]  but right now it's just enjoying the genetics
[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:53.820]  and hunting and doing my job.
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:57.500]  Recently I joined a new facility
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.900]  running over 420,000 square feet.
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:02.060]  So it's huge, it's an undertaking.
[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:03.380]  It eats up most of my day.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:08.380]  I have a good team and a solid grower who is a co-driver,
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.340]  but trying to do some stuff there.
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:13.220]  We have an amazing genetics there
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:15.420]  to help that place go to the next level.
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:19.140]  And like Pat was saying, none of us are masters in this.
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:20.380]  You hear that word all the time.
[02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:22.380]  I'm a master breeder, master grower.
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:23.820]  There are no masters.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:26.100]  In agriculture, there's only a head grower.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.620]  Every day, my motto is if I'm not learning something
[02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:32.540]  every day, I'm not doing my job.
[02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:35.140]  That's what keeps me, my passion burning for Canada.
[02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:37.220]  I love the plant, but how do we make it better?
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.180]  How do we do it better?
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:42.420]  And right now we're still all figuring this stuff out.
[02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:44.980]  It's a blessing to be a ROMET now.
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:46.420]  I'm surrounded by agriculture.
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:49.180]  So I get to work with people from Driscoll's
[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:50.220]  and all these other companies.
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:51.900]  I get to pick their brains.
[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:53.580]  And at the same time, they're kind of like,
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:54.420]  what are you doing?
[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.740]  What are you, what are you growing up to?
[02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:57.380]  But no, it's a blessing.
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:00.620]  And trying to, just trying to breed better genetics
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:03.140]  for the area I'm in now,
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:06.740]  like the Valley here in Salinas is, it's brutal.
[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:08.140]  It's just as bad as Oregon.
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:09.380]  We have fog every day.
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.740]  The humidity is 100%.
[02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:12.700]  The next thing you know, it's a hundred degrees
[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:14.260]  and it just swings all over the place.
[02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:17.660]  So selecting varieties that perform here,
[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:19.820]  that perform well in this region.
[02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:23.060]  That's another thing that I'm trying to do right now.
[02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:25.420]  Just trying to ride my passion
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:27.020]  and keep on doing things better and better.
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:29.260]  And when I do a new drop here
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:32.540]  and start releasing some old stuff, it'll be out there.
[02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:35.100]  Do you want to talk briefly?
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.100]  There's a couple of things I want to ask you about,
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:40.100]  but a black cherry soda, we can start there.
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:42.100]  We have one of our listeners is asking,
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:44.460]  can someone speak on the black cherry soda?
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:46.820]  So black cherry, black cherry is,
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:48.700]  the original black cherry is Danny Boy
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:50.940]  by the black Russian F2.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:54.060]  And then the black cherry two,
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:55.660]  it also had a couple other names.
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:25:00.220]  That's a black cherry by the black Russian VX2.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:05.700]  And the soda, that clone was hunted out
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.620]  and selected by somebody else.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.060]  But yeah, that's the genetics that are behind it.
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:16.060]  And Danny Boy, for example, is airborne G13 by Cinderella 99
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:20.700]  by, oh, I just want to think for a moment.
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.260]  Brothers Grimm.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:23.660]  Well, it's Brothers Grimm, it has Cinderella.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:26.300]  I'm just trying to think of Ortega by the Cinderella.
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:27.380]  Yes, Ortega.
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:28.620]  That's Danny Boy.
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:31.660]  That cut came out of Southern Oregon
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:34.100]  when Joel Dioxide was working with our other buddy,
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:35.460]  Eric Hopper.
[02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:38.060]  That's where that ended up coming into the equation
[02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:41.820]  from in, I think 2008 or nine.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:44.980]  Awesome.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:49.020]  So Shane, also let's touch on the lamb's bread
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:50.340]  that you've been working.
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:51.900]  It's funny, one of the listeners last week,
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:53.540]  I was talking about lamb's bread
[02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:54.620]  and how it isn't around anymore.
[02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:57.700]  He said he has seeds and he wants to send me some seeds.
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:58.620]  I said, fantastic.
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:01.140]  Here's my mailing address.
[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:02.620]  He's sending me some seeds.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.260]  You've worked the lamb's bread.
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:06.500]  In fact, the only thing that I've seen comparable
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:08.740]  to the lamb's bread in the last 20 years
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:11.660]  was one of the cultivars that you created.
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:12.940]  You want to touch on that?
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:15.380]  So that was the Smokestack Lightning.
[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:21.260]  The lamb's bread that I worked with to create that
[02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:22.500]  was really special.
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:25.940]  Just quite different from a lot of the other lamb's breads
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:27.420]  I'd seen over the years.
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:30.220]  I'd seen a lot of misname or rename things
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:32.260]  that just weren't quite that.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:33.580]  And that's just one of those strains,
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:36.180]  like when you see it, you know it.
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:38.700]  You know that variety, you're like, oh, that's it.
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:42.300]  And so the Smokestack Lightning,
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:44.900]  that has, that's as skunky as its father,
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:46.700]  which is Exodus Chee,
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:49.580]  with a little bit of Northern Lights number five
[02:26:49.580 --> 02:26:51.220]  and Uzbekistani lamb racehead.
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:56.260]  And that mail, lamb's bread,
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:58.500]  that's what Smokestack Lightning is.
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:00.340]  Yeah, and you called it out right away.
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:03.100]  You know, when you saw that, you're like, oh, okay.
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:05.860]  Yeah, it's a very unique chert profile.
[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:08.860]  It's, yeah, it's very, very unique.
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:11.900]  And it's the only time I've seen it in the last 20 years
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:12.740]  when I've seen, you know,
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:14.940]  cause I feel like a lot of what's going around
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:16.500]  in California as lamb's bread
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:19.140]  is actually a cultivar called the Hassan,
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:20.860]  which I'm not sure the lineage of it,
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:22.860]  but it's not related to lamb's bread at all.
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:26.500]  And Josh Freeman is the one who gave it to me
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.740]  and I was growing it for a long time.
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:29.500]  And I've seen lamb's bread from three other people
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:32.340]  in the last 20 years, and it's all been Hassan.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:34.620]  So it was like really special to actually see
[02:27:34.700 --> 02:27:36.180]  that it's been bred into something,
[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:37.700]  at least that chert profile.
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.860]  It's got a muskiness that's very unique.
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:43.540]  Right, it's a little spicy and musky and yeah, just.
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.380]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:47.220]  And that plant by itself, it's just longer growth
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:48.820]  and a little bit of smaller flowers.
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:52.020]  It's really distinctive and it's nice to breed it.
[02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:53.820]  It's something to get, add some more structure
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:56.940]  and then try to retain that profile.
[02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:59.980]  Yeah, I love seeing things that have actually carried on
[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:02.500]  and been, you know, not necessarily improved upon,
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:07.020]  but at least taken and used by individual breeders.
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:10.220]  You know, it's like, it's rare to see stuff like that.
[02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:12.180]  It's not something that unique, you know,
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:14.580]  Marlon and I are working on the Orange Hill.
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:16.220]  That's gonna be something we need to select for,
[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:20.900]  but the plant has a tendency to have lots of seeds in it.
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:22.580]  So we have to go through a lot of seeds
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:24.260]  to find something that doesn't.
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:25.100]  Right.
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:28.980]  But so we got a couple of questions for you guys.
[02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:31.860]  Boom Farm said, Dioxide made half the menu.
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:33.220]  Where's Joel?
[02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:34.060]  Right?
[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:36.580]  Joel doesn't use the internet.
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:38.180]  Joel doesn't have social media.
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:41.140]  And honestly, Joel wouldn't have come on
[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:42.340]  even if you asked him to.
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:44.140]  I was just gonna say, he wouldn't come on here
[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:45.300]  if you begged him.
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:47.420]  Yeah, he'd tell you all to fuck off.
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:48.540]  Not that like fuck off,
[02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:50.460]  but I mean, he just hates the internet.
[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:52.540]  And he doesn't, he's always asking like,
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:53.420]  what do you got going on?
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:55.180]  I'm like, well, I got this, this, and this.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:56.540]  He's like, I'm not on IG.
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:59.820]  And once in a while he'll get on his wife's, but he is,
[02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:04.060]  his whole thing when him and Sub started working together
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:08.300]  was he didn't, we were still in the fearful stage.
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.940]  Even when I first came out, I'd opened a hydro store.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:14.140]  I had signed all these pages if they knew anything,
[02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:16.820]  we were growing weed or dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:18.540]  So Sub was the face.
[02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:22.140]  And so that's just Joel still is Joel
[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:23.180]  and hides in the shadows.
[02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:24.900]  But I mean, he's out there, he's crushing it.
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:27.460]  I know he's got a big collective.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:28.620]  He's got multiple,
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.940]  I think he's got five different dispensaries now,
[02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:32.340]  a couple of different grows.
[02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:36.900]  So he's still very actively involved in cannabis,
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:41.060]  but he's just kind of in like the Salem area
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:42.700]  and he's doing what he does.
[02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:46.540]  Even if he did commit to coming on the show,
[02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:48.060]  all of us that know him no damn well,
[02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:49.340]  he'd be two hours late.
[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:50.180]  Yeah.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:52.220]  He would be showed up on time.
[02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:55.020]  Getting that guy on the phone,
[02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:56.500]  he'd be like, call me tomorrow around noon.
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:58.540]  It might be two or three days till you talk to that guy.
[02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:00.340]  He's like, I'll be at your wedding.
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:02.420]  Instead he went to the High Times Cup in Seattle.
[02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:03.260]  So, yeah.
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:09.700]  So you guys have any advice for younger generation,
[02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:11.860]  the younger generation of cultivators and breeders
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:13.900]  for starting a seed company,
[02:30:13.900 --> 02:30:16.340]  the ones that are passionate about cannabis?
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:18.820]  They can take your comment.
[02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:25.260]  I get that question or that DM every day.
[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:27.420]  And it's a hard thing to answer
[02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:30.140]  because there's so much more to it than people think.
[02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:33.700]  It's a tough business.
[02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:35.500]  Every time I go to a cup or a show,
[02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:38.980]  there's two or new seed companies.
[02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:41.300]  And then next time I go to a show, they're done, they're gone.
[02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:43.020]  I mean, it's a lot of work.
[02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:44.500]  It's a lot of dedication.
[02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:49.500]  If you're not comfortable with social media, good luck.
[02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:53.380]  Unless you have a ton of money to run ads in magazines.
[02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:58.300]  You know, you gotta be 100% committed
[02:30:58.300 --> 02:30:59.540]  and you gotta do your thing.
[02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:00.380]  You gotta be strict.
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:01.620]  You gotta be disciplined.
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:05.260]  I always call them kids because I'm 53 now.
[02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:07.740]  So anybody under 40 is like a kid to me.
[02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:10.500]  But when these kids write me,
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:12.220]  a half time I really don't know what to write them
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.060]  without sounding like a jerk.
[02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:14.900]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.420]  It's like, some of us got in when the getting was good.
[02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:20.460]  Some of us got lucky by starting with guys
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:22.140]  like Jill and Sub.
[02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:23.100]  Sorry, I didn't mean to call you a guy,
[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:24.780]  but people like Jill and Sub
[02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:27.540]  where we kind of instantly got a pedigree.
[02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:28.380]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:30.700]  Because I remember when me and Sub hit it off real quick.
[02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:32.500]  You know, we're real close friends right away.
[02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:36.100]  And people were like, who the hell is this jinx proof dude?
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:39.780]  You know, kicking it at Sub's farm, kicking it in his booth,
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:40.980]  doing shows with him.
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:43.980]  It's kind of the, not always what you know,
[02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:47.020]  but who you know, and just putting your nose to the,
[02:31:47.020 --> 02:31:48.300]  you gotta be committed.
[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:51.180]  You know, it's so much, I've been to so many shows
[02:31:51.220 --> 02:31:52.660]  and I don't always want to go to shows.
[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:54.300]  A lot of times I'd rather be at home
[02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:55.940]  kicking it with my wife and my boy.
[02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:59.820]  You know, but you know, it's there.
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:03.660]  I don't know if there is any solid straight like path
[02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:06.820]  you can send these people on, except just do your thing.
[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:07.740]  Keep your nose clean.
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:10.700]  One of the biggest thing I offer to people
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:12.660]  is don't fight on the internet.
[02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:15.060]  You know, you get all these people fighting and bitching.
[02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:17.580]  Like if you try to fight with me on my internet,
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:18.820]  you get the block button.
[02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:20.620]  You know, I got no time for that.
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:21.900]  You know what I mean?
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:23.180]  It's just stupid.
[02:32:24.220 --> 02:32:26.340]  What about things to read for, directions to go?
[02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.020]  You know, I think there's all kinds of important things
[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:30.660]  like, you know, if someone else wants to even touch
[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:32.700]  on that, Pat, maybe, you know,
[02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:36.460]  everyone seems to be breeding OGs and certain things.
[02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:38.100]  What directions should people go?
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:41.860]  Well, I think that first off, you know, what's your goal?
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:42.820]  Why are you breeding?
[02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:45.260]  Because if it's just for money, get the fuck out.
[02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:48.940]  I mean, that's not why I got into growing cannabis at all.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:51.700]  Now, has it been, you know, a profitable thing?
[02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:53.420]  And has it given me everything that I've had
[02:32:53.420 --> 02:32:55.940]  and taken it away at the same time, time and time again?
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:57.540]  Yeah.
[02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:59.500]  Cannabis is a teacher, like I said earlier,
[02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:01.260]  and it will give and take from you.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.380]  So, you know, first off, you know,
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:06.100]  hopefully you're truly passionate about it.
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:07.700]  And if you have the passion, you know,
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:10.940]  then you can learn the disciplines that it takes,
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.860]  you know, and in business, you know,
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:16.260]  especially in the new era of this, you know,
[02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:20.260]  they've got a lot of information that we didn't have.
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.260]  You know, when we did do this, you know,
[02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:24.660]  we were all sitting down with lawyers, like, you know,
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:27.340]  and all the lawyers were like, you guys are fucking crazy.
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:29.220]  You know, it's still a schedule one narcotic
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:30.900]  in the same class as heroin,
[02:33:30.900 --> 02:33:34.300]  but it is, you know, very widely accepted now.
[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:37.140]  So I think that first off,
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:38.940]  hopefully you're passionate about it for the plant
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:40.260]  and the right reasons,
[02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:44.180]  and then, you know, have a direction of your why, you know,
[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:47.700]  and you don't have to go in a direction necessarily of like,
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.540]  this is the way that the market's going.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:51.780]  You know, if all of us went the way
[02:33:51.780 --> 02:33:54.060]  that the market was going, we just have the same thing,
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:56.300]  you know, so, you know, what is your,
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:59.580]  what's your goal in your terpene profile
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:01.060]  with your production?
[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:03.180]  And if you can answer those questions,
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:05.260]  then you can start to kind of find your reasoning
[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:08.300]  and your why, but it's a commitment, you know,
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:11.260]  in terms of, you know, finding the right stuff
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:13.940]  and then breeding it, you know,
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:17.580]  you're looking at anywhere from a minimum of a year
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:19.980]  to a year and a half, maybe two,
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:22.660]  before you actually have a product line
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:24.340]  that you should release into the market.
[02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:26.700]  You know, there's breeders everywhere, you know,
[02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:28.660]  pollen chuckers, whatever you want to call them.
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:31.380]  We all start chucking pollen to get somewhere,
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:34.580]  but it's about how you hone your skills,
[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:36.420]  how you do test everything, you know,
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.700]  how you send it out to small, big growers,
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:39.660]  like Jinx was saying,
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:42.060]  I love the fact that you send them to the shittiest growers,
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:44.380]  because that's the best thing that you can do.
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:48.620]  And I just think that, you know, really having a direction,
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:51.340]  you know, business and life is not easy,
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:54.820]  but you guys have so many more available platforms
[02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:57.660]  than we do, but it's also about using your platforms
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:58.860]  and your skills properly.
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:01.420]  I mean, I've had to learn myself how, you know,
[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:03.300]  I'm super nice until I'm not.
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:06.620]  And, you know, if you scrap in the IG play yard,
[02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:08.380]  you know, sometimes your accounts get taken.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:09.940]  I experienced that firsthand.
[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:13.580]  Sucks to be stolen from and it being on the public,
[02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:15.340]  you know, like, oh yeah, but then, you know,
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:18.500]  there's nothing looking back in those conversations
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:20.940]  and that shit talking that gained me anything
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:22.460]  besides a lesson.
[02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:25.260]  So I think how you interact with people,
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:27.300]  how you treat people, you know,
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:29.300]  that's what brings the business back.
[02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:31.420]  You know, why people love Jinx, you know,
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:33.220]  is because he's always super positive.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:37.260]  You know, he offers something different
[02:35:37.260 --> 02:35:40.180]  from anything that anyone else on this page
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:41.980]  right now talking offers.
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:43.980]  So how are you gonna be unique?
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.180]  How are you gonna be different?
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:47.580]  And what's your mission and goal?
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:51.460]  And stay true to yourself, you know, and it's work.
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:54.940]  You know, I'm young, but I'm 15 years deep
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:58.260]  into the cannabis game, you know, just in cultivation.
[02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:01.700]  I'm two and a half decades deep into selling pot.
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:06.500]  And, you know, I'm 10 years actually in like eight days
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:11.540]  into breeding, you know, so it's a long journey and road.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:14.940]  And if you sign up, you know, just respect the plant
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:16.980]  and take pride in it and it will,
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:19.380]  it can give you everything that you ever wished.
[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:21.060]  Awesome.
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:23.940]  So Shane, you wanna talk about a little bit
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:25.900]  about pheno hunting being more important
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:27.820]  than actually making seeds?
[02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:30.820]  I feel like we've had that conversation.
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:31.660]  Yes.
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:35.020]  First of all, I wanna say what Pat said is,
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:38.100]  my first answer is when somebody talks about breeding
[02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:40.740]  is have goals and everything that Pat said,
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:42.860]  that's perfect, you've said it very well.
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:47.460]  Pheno hunting, you know, making a plant is one thing
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:49.940]  or making a new strain is one thing,
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.220]  but, you know, hunting them out and growing lots of seeds
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:54.860]  and being able to see what those plants
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:57.700]  actually have produced and what you have created,
[02:36:57.700 --> 02:36:58.740]  that's everything.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:02.900]  You know, and running plants on numbers, you know,
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:06.460]  it's always do no less than a hundred seeds.
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:08.580]  You know, that's gonna give you a good range
[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:13.580]  of what that new progeny is actually gonna, you know, be.
[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:18.220]  And, you know, up to 500, I think there's kind of a limit
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:19.780]  though, with how many you should run.
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:22.940]  I mean, who has the space to run, you know,
[02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:25.220]  a thousand or 10,000 of them at a time?
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.580]  I mean, it could be done, but that's a lot.
[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:30.940]  You could test a lot of other varieties in there.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:37.420]  And, you know, it's finding outliers,
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:39.540]  you might not find them in those first 500.
[02:37:39.540 --> 02:37:43.460]  I'll tell you what, the Haichu, the great Haichu from Odie,
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:47.140]  there's one that, you know, we've seen the Dr. Who run
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:49.740]  over and over and over thousands of them,
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:53.460]  but there's one expression that we just haven't
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:55.380]  really seen again, we haven't found it.
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:58.940]  Like that, the great Haichu is immaculate, you know,
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:00.540]  and then you look at all the other Haichus
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:02.180]  and you kind of come close to it,
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:05.100]  just that one and, you know, tens of thousands
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.620]  of those seeds being germinated.
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:08.260]  So it's interesting.
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:13.180]  And Odie, how many seeds were germinated to find that?
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:14.580]  That was out of-
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:17.740]  Realistically, that was out of like the first 30 or 40.
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:20.220]  That's amazing, that's amazing.
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:23.460]  But it can be thousands to find one Fino you're looking for.
[02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:24.300]  It could.
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:29.300]  I had a kid send me a picture of a nine pound hammer he has
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:31.220]  and it's black.
[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:35.580]  I mean, it's black, like a black crayon and it's so frosty.
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:36.980]  And I actually wrote him back, I was like,
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:38.380]  where are you at, bro?
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:39.460]  I was hoping he was close
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:41.660]  because I was gonna hit him up for cutting.
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:45.140]  Yeah, I've only seen the black one twice ever.
[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.700]  I mean, I've bred so many hammer seeds, you know,
[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:50.340]  it's like, just, you know, you can pop 10,000 seeds,
[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:51.660]  doesn't mean you're getting that black one,
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:53.980]  doesn't mean you're getting that gooberry, you know,
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:56.740]  and another thing comes up,
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:00.620]  and another thing kind of stemming
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.940]  from what Sonny and Pat were saying
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:04.740]  is to have some integrity too.
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:09.780]  Some of these people are rebreeding other people's strains.
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:13.580]  There's a huge company that's all the shows now,
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:14.620]  I'm not gonna drop their name,
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:17.140]  but they're breeding other people's strains,
[02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:20.300]  the blueberry, the this, the that, the white widow,
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:21.180]  they're not their strains,
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:22.500]  they're F2ing them or whatever.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:24.540]  It's like, I just wanna go over there
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:25.660]  and kick their booth over.
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:27.700]  It's just, it's not cool.
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:30.020]  These people work hard.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:33.660]  You know, 10 years ago, it was a normal model, right?
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:36.580]  Where everybody had to have a sour diesel and everybody,
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:38.220]  that's the European business model,
[02:39:38.220 --> 02:39:39.500]  but we need help from that.
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.660]  So even if you are doing something that involves it
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:43.740]  and you feel like it's a good representation,
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:45.540]  call it something else, make it great.
[02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:47.700]  You know, put whatever your company's name is
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:48.540]  in front of it.
[02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:49.860]  You know, I think, I agree,
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:51.580]  there's just so many ways to do it.
[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:53.500]  Like, you're not gonna make another blueberry,
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:56.340]  let's call it, you know, blueberry, whatever.
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.780]  Yeah, but you know, and people write me all the time,
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:00.100]  like, hey bro, I got a pack of hammer,
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:02.020]  do you care if I cross it to this?
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:04.060]  I absolutely do not care.
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:05.660]  You bought your seeds, do whatever you want with them,
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:06.780]  I don't care.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:10.060]  But like F2 them and release them as your brands,
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:12.700]  you know, nine pound hammer, like that's just BS.
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:14.060]  And it happens a lot.
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:18.380]  You know, there's companies, like that's all they do.
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:19.220]  You know what I mean?
[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:20.660]  And it's just like, it's ridiculous.
[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:23.500]  And then you get flooded with all these messages
[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:24.940]  and stuff about this and that,
[02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:27.700]  either telling on them or asking you about them.
[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:29.780]  And it's like, I don't have time for this crap.
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:31.980]  And it's just, you know, it's just, you know,
[02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:32.900]  have some integrity.
[02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:35.620]  And in my opinion, you're not a real breeder
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:37.620]  until you've come up with your own strain
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:39.300]  and bred it to something.
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:40.260]  You know what I mean?
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:41.820]  Obviously you have to start with something
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:43.580]  cause you're not just gonna pull seeds out of ears,
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:46.140]  but you gotta, you know, find two strains you love,
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:48.980]  breed those together, breed them to something
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:50.100]  and then come up with your own strain
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:51.900]  and start breeding that, you know?
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:53.580]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with, you know,
[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:54.660]  going out and getting, you know,
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:57.700]  I've bred my strains to other people's stuff,
[02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:00.100]  but, you know, to just rebreed it or have to,
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:02.900]  and you know, it's just, it's very frustrating.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:03.900]  It's very offensive.
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.820]  And it's just, you know, it's just-
[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:07.940]  And there's efficacy, like Jinx was saying,
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:11.380]  in terms of, you know, look, as soon as I release my seeds,
[02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:14.980]  you have the permission to do whatever you want to it.
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:17.820]  Where I get, you know, my gears grind a little bit
[02:41:17.860 --> 02:41:20.580]  is when I make something, I hunt something,
[02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:23.340]  the cut goes out and it gets renamed.
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:24.820]  And then it goes into their line
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:26.460]  and then it's this, this, and this.
[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:29.860]  And then you find out like, no, that's actually this.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:32.420]  And it's just like, hey, give credit to where credit's due.
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:34.620]  None of us, none of us made cannabis.
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:38.860]  I mean, we are, we've searched as a collective community
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:41.380]  globally to find what we have.
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:43.220]  And there's just ways that you can do it.
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:45.380]  So, you know, Jinx hits me up,
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:47.100]  yo, do you mind if I cross this with this?
[02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:48.860]  I'm like, no, dude, more power to you.
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:51.220]  I've had people like breed a bunch of shit
[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:52.900]  and then send me half their seeds,
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:54.140]  which I never asked for it.
[02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:54.980]  Oh, can I give you some?
[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:55.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:56.940]  I'd love it for my collection.
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:00.220]  So I encourage people to work with other people's gear,
[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:03.860]  but before you can have a company, you need to, yes,
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:06.260]  originally take some other people's gear
[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:09.380]  to then make your own thing and then take your own thing
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:11.900]  and then make that into the next person's gear.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:13.780]  So I couldn't agree with that one more.
[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:17.660]  Yeah, I mean, my first marketed strain was a nine pound
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:22.660]  hammer and the father was Jesus OG, Pat Strain.
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:23.620]  You know what I mean?
[02:42:23.620 --> 02:42:25.100]  I would never deny that.
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:28.260]  Which to correct that, the Jesus OG,
[02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:30.140]  that is actually dioxides.
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:30.980]  Oh, okay.
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:32.980]  So, yeah.
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:35.380]  And so originally when we did my original package,
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:38.380]  there was some other genetic names that he was working on,
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:40.260]  Shovelhead, Jesus.
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:43.540]  So there's a few of them, but that one was his.
[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:45.500]  So I just want to make sure that no one thinks
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:46.900]  that one is mine.
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:47.740]  Jesus OG.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:49.260]  So it did not get released under your packaging
[02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:50.180]  or was that straight?
[02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:52.260]  No, that got released under my packaging.
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:53.100]  Okay, that's what I thought.
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:55.140]  When I originally got brought into TGA
[02:42:55.140 --> 02:42:56.860]  and the first Heroes of the Farm packaging,
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:42:58.660]  we added a bunch of his shit onto there
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:00.380]  because we'd been working closely together,
[02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:02.180]  but that was one of his creations.
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:05.860]  So again, I think you see, I didn't do that, he did.
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:07.540]  And I just want to make sure that he definitely
[02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:08.620]  gets the credit for it.
[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:09.460]  Yeah.
[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:12.180]  Now you made me look like one of those guys.
[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:15.020]  No.
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:17.820]  Something else I want to say on the breeding is,
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:20.220]  I would think that people should take
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:21.580]  a little bit more time.
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:25.220]  People will come up with a seed company,
[02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:28.140]  they've only had a couple of grows under their belt.
[02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:30.500]  They don't know yet how to select a phenotype
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:32.900]  and they haven't ran into issues yet.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:35.300]  They haven't had to go through any of those things yet
[02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:38.580]  to understand what to look for in a phenotype
[02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:40.900]  to cross to another phenotype.
[02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:42.980]  And it takes time.
[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:44.260]  You need to grow for a while,
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:45.500]  you need to breed for a while,
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:49.260]  you need to be able to do these things.
[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:52.220]  And when you do get to the breeding part, be patient.
[02:43:52.220 --> 02:43:54.860]  You can't just make the first strain
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:55.780]  and throw it right out there.
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:58.260]  You can make a couple of new strains,
[02:43:58.260 --> 02:43:59.500]  and only one's going to survive,
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:01.100]  one's going to make it through.
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:04.500]  And that's something that I don't think people think about.
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:07.260]  They just make something or they have an accident
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:10.500]  in the room and all of a sudden they're a company.
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:14.580]  And also like Jinx was saying on the genetics,
[02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:17.420]  I have given out testers to people before,
[02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:18.620]  they get 10 seeds,
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:20.660]  the first male they found out of my test pack,
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:22.420]  they want to cross it to something.
[02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:26.140]  I'm like, no, no, these are not even released yet.
[02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:27.340]  You can't do that.
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:28.620]  I'm going to be blamed for that
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:30.100]  if you come up with something new
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:31.380]  and it doesn't turn out good
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:32.980]  because you've crossed it to something
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:35.180]  that was in testing that you got from me.
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:39.220]  So I think they need to know what they're working with
[02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:42.060]  also before and know why they're working with it
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:43.340]  and what they expect from it.
[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:46.660]  And with its pairing of whatever they're pairing it with,
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.380]  is it going to go good together?
[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:50.580]  What do you expect the outcome to be?
[02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:52.420]  And I think there needs to be a lot more thought
[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:53.260]  put into it.
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:54.740]  And also, like you said,
[02:44:54.740 --> 02:44:56.700]  respect for the people that came before you
[02:44:56.700 --> 02:44:58.580]  for the breeder that made it,
[02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:03.100]  for the help that you get from the older breeders
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:03.940]  that have been in the game.
[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:06.820]  Just be respectful of the plant and the breeders.
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:08.740]  Yeah, and I agree
[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:11.140]  because we've had the same thing with testers.
[02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:14.060]  Like some of them didn't even realize like, it's not cool.
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:15.340]  Like, check it out, bro, I'm breeding.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:16.660]  I got this male and I'm breeding it.
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:18.940]  It's like, we haven't even released that yet.
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:20.340]  And you're breeding it?
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:22.060]  You know, it's not even past test.
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.700]  So that's why Rose came up with the thing.
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:25.220]  Like, if you're our tester,
[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:28.220]  you don't know what you're growing until you're done.
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:30.940]  And if you've completed what we've agreed on,
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:31.860]  it's pretty simple.
[02:45:31.860 --> 02:45:34.460]  We just want some pictures, some profiles,
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:37.300]  maybe a little grow advice to do this, to do that.
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:40.860]  And at that point you get to know what you have.
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:41.700]  You know what I mean?
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:44.180]  Because like I said, it was a real pain in the ass.
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.620]  You know, so, but, and it's worked too.
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:48.860]  Every single one of those people is reporting
[02:45:48.860 --> 02:45:51.380]  and sending pictures and you know, so.
[02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:54.740]  Thank you to Rose, I'll use that.
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:45:58.700]  That's all the time we have for today guys,
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:01.700]  but I really appreciate each one of you coming on.
[02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:02.660]  It was a great show, man.
[02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:03.700]  I really appreciate it.
[02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:06.380]  And thank you all so much.
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:07.820]  Tune in next week.
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:09.020]  I'm not sure who the guest is,
[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:12.420]  but we should be announcing something in the next 24 hours.
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:16.540]  But look at this, we have a consistent time slot.
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:19.140]  Amazing, consistency, I love it.
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:21.300]  So yeah, thanks to that, we had,
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:24.020]  I think we peaked at like almost 700 people,
[02:46:24.020 --> 02:46:26.300]  but I think we still have around 600 watching right now.
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:28.820]  So appreciation to everyone.
[02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:30.700]  Sorry, we didn't get to all your questions.
[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:33.860]  I was trying to keep track of as many as possible,
[02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:37.220]  but I think everybody needs to go eat some lunch
[02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:38.580]  on the West Coast at least.
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:41.860]  Respect to everybody on the panel.
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:43.380]  Good seeing you guys.
[02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:44.820]  Good seeing everybody.
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:45.660]  Yeah, you too.
[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:46.980]  Be safe.
[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:49.180]  And with that, I will kill the live stream.
