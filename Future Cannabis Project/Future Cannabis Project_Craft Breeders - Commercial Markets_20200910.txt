All right.
All right.
We are now live on YouTube.
And so let me just
we had some technical difficulties
so I had to quit.
Clear my cache
and just
everybody give me one second
to invite all these speakers back in.
Oh, wow.
Okay. So
give me a minute. We will be
talking about that
in about 20 seconds.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Third time. It's like the fifth time.
So give me
one second as
people come back in
the room.
It's been a long day.
Long couple days.
We will get an update
on the fires
in NorCal.
I know Doc and Matt are both in Humboldt
and Dan is in the
kind of Bay Area.
Oh.
As people
trickle in the room, just give us
one minute.
All right.
Doc, can you hear me?
I can hear you.
So give me a quick update
on the fires.
You had
ash coming down,
right?
It's been ash here for three days,
Peter. It's like I'm about a mile
off the coast.
I'm in northern Humboldt and about a mile
off the coast as the crow flies
in and we've been getting ash for
at least three days
now where it's really just been orange
skies and as somebody
else alluded to earlier,
here in northern
California, that's orange skies all
day. At 1030,
I had lights on in the living room.
I didn't even open my
greenhouses today because I didn't want to ash
getting on stuff again.
Everything outdoors is not
covered, but it's fine particulate
matter on sticky hairs and it's just
the wrong time of the year for it to be happening
for a lot of us with our outdoor plants.
I've reached
out to some friends that are in other portions
of the country that
do what we do on scale and one of my
friends, she suggested getting
an air compressor
out with a blower and trying that to blow
stuff off. I'm going to give that a whirl tomorrow and
see if that works at all.
It's
brutal, Peter. It's really brutal
outside. The air is real still.
It didn't get very warm
here on the coast. Thank goodness we have
moisture. It's been really
just about 80
miles. I know Garberville's
under watch. They're evacuating
in Alder Point,
which is about 90 miles south of me.
The line's
getting real thin. It's moving up the
101 corridor.
It's just real, for those of us that are
up here in it, it's a real, this is
the heart of the time of the year for a lot of people
for being outside, for plants coming in
and stuff like that.
The ones of us that are craft people,
this is something that's
really personal to us when it gets to this time
of the year of how the quality comes out.
It's going to affect some
of the quality of some of the flowers that are full sun
outdoor right now. You can see it happening.
Anyway.
Still glad to be here
though. Glad to be here, hanging out and visiting
with these great people. Great hanging out with
all these folks. I get to meet everybody a little
bit more.
Nat, we were just talking about the fires
and what you're seeing
in Europe. How far off the
coast are you and Humboldt?
Well,
the farm is,
as the
crow flies, it's like only
30 miles or something, but
it's quite a drive.
To get to what I think
you're asking is, are we
in immediate danger out
there? Fortunately
we are not, but I
do have
some really close
friends that tomorrow I
think I'm going to be
back and helping people
evacuate and stuff like that.
Of course, depending
on what the wind decides
to do, but
it's been a hell of a...
I mean, this
recent fires
is just sort of par for the course for
this year, but I'm just
devastated for the folks
that lost it all.
We were
talking about maybe having
Shapeshifter of the
Freak Show creator
join us tonight.
We're going
to be having a
GoFundMe, I think, because
he had the fire
came and
fortunately it didn't
get his home,
but it
got a lot of the property there,
and so he's going to need some help.
Well, let me
know, because over the weekend we raised
over $10,000
for two farmers
and a non-profit, and then
yesterday we raised about
almost $7,000
for Nick Risen
for his medical bills.
I think there are going to be a lot of fundraisers
in the next couple
weeks. Anyway,
with that,
Dale, you were
actually, well, I'll start with
Dale. Dale, you were about to say something. First of all,
this is what we're talking about for anybody who's
just tuning in.
We've been
dealing with a lot of small breeders,
and Nat,
you're a giant in the breeder
world, but you're still tiny,
so everyone kind of is
a small craft breeder, so
how do you guys
and the people you deal with
navigate
this
commercialization of the industry
and ideals versus
people who don't share
those ideals? I just want to
have Dale start with a comment you were going to make,
and then we'll get into it.
Well, in the context of
all the bad things that are happening,
it's a little flippant, but I
was just going to say that I've hung around
with Nat enough, just enough
to see how he's constantly
busy. He's constantly working,
constantly on the phone, constantly posting
things. The guy is
so
busy, but he's also
so recognized,
and it reminded me of a line from
a Kanye song, actually,
where Jay, who's a guest
on the song, says, I'm not a businessman.
I'm a business man.
That's Nat
to me. Nat's a business.
It's been fun
to watch that the couple
times I've gotten to hang out with Nat.
I think maybe a lot of people are like
that. What they have,
shit they've created.
They've worked
really hard to get what they've got, and
part of what they do with
their time is to help other people get where they're
going. I know that about
Nat.
Anyway.
Just quickly,
for me to... Go ahead,
Nat. How can I respond?
I have
an amazing team. I've
got Ben
who
crushes it on a whole bunch
of our outreach,
and of course is an amazing
breeder himself. Then I've
got my family, and
my daughter,
and then my wife, and everybody.
It's not
a...
In no way is it just
like a... Thank you, Dale.
I love you too, and I can't imagine...
I feel like a lot safer
knowing that you're out there
advocating for
us
all breeders.
It's a comforting
feeling to know that Dale's
out there, and his team
is out there doing it.
You don't view Dale as the antichrist?
No.
I don't understand.
Before you answer that question,
let me just end up the conversation with
what inspired me
to have this conversation was
actually with Jordan when I was
hearing
all the different constituents
who came together to help
this small breeder who I think,
correct me if I'm wrong, never really
had any intention to...
He just wanted
to mind his own business up on the hills
in Humboldt.
That changed, and
he had
Dale help him on the
protection side.
He had Nat
help him on the
breeding side. He had
Dan help him on the
protection side.
I think it was really
cool to see
both of you
with slightly different roles
bringing product to market, which is
Freak Show
in clone format.
I thought it was cool to see
what it takes for a small
breeder, at least
one path forward.
I think we can maybe touch on some
others, but whoever wants
to start, I'll start.
I'll start with you,
because I think you're
going to have a lot to say.
Well,
Shapeshifter,
aka Jordan,
was...
We met at
a really small event
up in Crescent City.
It was a Cannabis Cup.
We had known
of each other, but we
knew that he
had kind of created
or been
gifted by
whatever
metaphysical...
But he
thinks aliens came and dropped off
that variety
on his place up there.
He was looking to
figure out the right way
to bring it to the world.
When
he met us and he
kind of caught
our vibes and
grooved with us,
it didn't take him long to say,
I think that you
folks are the right folks to
propagate
this wild genetic
and get it out there.
But you are right,
that he didn't...
It's
interesting having Doc
on here too.
If we lose these
amazing
sort of
original cannabis community
type folks
because
the whole prospect
of getting
licensed and
putting yourself out
there, signing
your name on a document
that says, I grow
cannabis,
if we lose that
aspect of the community,
then I think
that would be tragic.
And so I think that
when we
form companies
that...
Dan and I
know how incredibly
challenging it is
to deal with all the licensing
and
I think it's kind of...
It's a wonderful
thing to be able to incorporate
people that have
the kind
of knowledge that goes
back before
all the
bullshit that we
have to deal with now and
can sort of remind us
what it's really all about and
keep us from getting
lost in
red tape.
You really...
You hit it on the head too, brother.
I believe it. And part of
me coming into the light with
Dell support and moving into this
has strictly been
him helping me to have the
courage to say, and what you said is the truth,
I now have my legal name on
federal frickin' documents
and I'm an old school...
I went to prison over this plant in the mid
80s over a miniscule
amount of cannabis by most
people's standards, three quarters of an ounce
to think that they would take your time
over that by today's standards
is ridiculous, but it happened to me
and it's like...
Well, I did change my game. I didn't stop
growing. I just didn't let people have access to me
anymore. You had to be
in my circle of friends
to even have access to me and
these older growers
that you referenced,
we're that old school mindset
of we don't talk about it,
we don't put our name on things, my
40 year old kids, we don't
discuss cannabis.
Maybe
how do we get it to do
my agreement with Dell's
help and like I've said
on the radio, your local
you know, it's like I'm gonna find out
if I'm either gonna do it or not
gonna do it. It's either gonna happen or
they're gonna handcuff me and
whatever, you know, at this stage they can't really
do much to my old beat
up, blown up old ass anymore.
It's like they're not taking a lot anymore.
So that's how
I'm approaching it now and I know
I have reader
friends that are really good
at their craft, that they're kind of waiting to see
what happens with me
over the next 12 to
24 months. How things
are going to go.
You know, can I get my
seeds
into
hands where people will control them
correctly and that kind of thing
and you know, are we gonna go
beyond letting just flower out and let
clones come out on stuff
other than through controlled sources
which is, it freaks me out.
You know, I mean, that's not my thing.
I'm a cannabis breeder and self
taught and I just
want to have Dale and his team helping
me because I don't want to get caught in that
having to figure out
if, you know, all the stuff that
you guys are doing right now, it freaks
me out and why I'm
so appreciative
of the blood, sweat and
tears you put into it, brother. I know what you put
into it, you know, and even though we haven't
been sitting in the same
room at the same times, I've been
watching what you do and keeping abreast
of what's happening
in our community as a whole because
the craft community to me is
very, very special. It's very dear
and you guys have mentioned that
we've lost that
and maybe, I don't know, maybe you
do. I don't think it happens very much
anymore, you know, when harvest time was coming
in where family came around
and it was generationally from
eight to ninety-eight and everybody was
there and we dropped plants and the girls
fixed food and there was music and it was just
it was a family event. That kind
of environment has gone away. I know
it's gone away. It's dollars and
cents and, you know, and the
craft thing that we are
trying to, I hope,
keep and keep
alive in our community
here in Northern California
but also around the world, teach out this
heritage craft of, you know,
grow your own and grow it correctly
and from a place of love
and those type of things.
That's what I'm hoping that
we can continue to put out
and get away from the
down and dirty and quick and,
you know, it's all money motivated and
it's just that that's not
I think a lot of what
you said earlier too,
Nate, is there
a lot of old true craft breeders
are not money motivated, you know,
it's more about the plant than anything
else and getting it into the right hands
and they are apprehensively
watching, you know, nobody would engage me
two years ago with Dale on talking
some of the things we're discussing this
afternoon and,
you know, in January he and I were on
KMUD having this conversation about
how to craft breeders protect themselves
and Sunshine
who wouldn't engage me a year ago
about what I was doing literally after I got off the
phone said, now what are you doing old man?
And I stopped and said, all right, this is what I'm trying
to do. So, you know, these
things, the doorways are starting to open
there and people in the community and
in the real, you know, in the
what I consider the heritage craft
community, it's like there's a lot
of people that are sitting and waiting right now.
You know, they really want to see a few
more testers come out the, you
know, that we can do this,
you know, we can do it successfully, we
can do it with the right kind of ethics,
which, you know, that's real big
to me personally. Again, why
I am aligned with Dale Hunt is because
he's one of the most compassionate
ethical people I've ever been
around in my life. And it's just I know
where he
where he
comes from.
Yeah.
That's what it that's what it means
to me is it's very
personal to me. So
something about taking it and creating
it and you put it out to other
because I'll take them what I
consider my main my
flagship, my Blackberry Pineapple
cross, you know, I had the privilege
of being on the team that worked on the original Mendo
Pineapple back in the 80s, you know, and
the Green Mountain Growers group and nobody
knows who the fuck those people are, you know, we're all
dead or in our eight 70s and
beyond, you know, it's like that
group of people they crafted a lot
of the fine strains that come out of Mendocino
County, you know, they're all bunch of old people
are gone now, you know, and taking
that with a craft
Blackberry Pineapple and
selecting it very well. And this
one I've been working on for the last eight years is
just really to take it out and give it to other
me specifically give it to other
veteran men and women and have them go
it relieves my head trauma
and it makes my aches go away.
I want to make sure that gets out
and that's why I'm doing it. I mean, that's
just the bottom line for me. That's my
main focus right now is to
get that plant into
the medical channels
they love my old
blue dream old man
old man Scott cross that I did
17 years ago people loving the hell
out of that one too for some reason.
I thought it was just old man. We did. Nobody
really want anymore, but it's really good for
clearing your head and making your back quit hurting
to so that getting both of those
two out and getting them where
they are accessible to people in
the medical community is a real big
it's really important to me right now
and protecting our heritage craft
here in Humboldt and Mendocino
and Trinity and
Northern California in general, but
when I talk about heritage craft, I'm
really referencing the true old
Emerald Triangle. That's how I look at
this and ladies and
gentlemen, you know, if you're not familiar the true
Emerald Triangle really is like Northern
Mendocino and Humboldt County
and interior
Western Trinity County. That's
really the heart of the Emerald Triangle
and you know over the last
20 years basically we've allowed
it to more anything north of San
Francisco all the way to the border and
that's just not the truth of the matter.
You know something I want to also make
sure that we continue to preach
the truth out. You know what really is
what really what is it? What
is it really? You know what it is heritage craft
what what do we represent
as the Emerald Triangle? Yeah
at least why I'm putting myself out
here and I'm hoping that other men and women
craft readers that are
in my age range and older will step
up because of me stepping out into the light
and saying hey I'm here doing this too
you know a little small scale trying
to make a little dent in it.
Anyway that's why
I'm sitting here this evening
to hang out with you guys and get to know
Nate to put face to face and
meet you brother I wanted to put face to face
because I know we're on the same turf
you know we're in the same neighborhood we know
we know a lot of the same friends we
have a lot of the same circles of friends it's
just we haven't been in the same place at the same
time. Just quickly Dot
we're gonna correct it early it's Nat
not Nate.
That's okay.
You can call him Nate
though. I think that
people you know sometimes
it does take someone
to have that kind of bravery
and it sounds like you're
you know willing to be a little bit of a
canary in the coal mine for the
the other folks that
are you know
watching to see how it works out
and I know you're in good
hands with Dale
and so I think that it'll
be a good I think that
the coal mine will treat you
well enough I hope I think so.
Well kind of
Nat Dan and Dale can you guys
kind of talk about the
you know the docs
of the world the smaller but
very old school breeders
who you know
what are the
conversations you're having with those people
who have something special and unique
and you know you guys are
good I would put you
up against anybody as evaluators
of cannabis uniqueness
and you know what are the
conversations like when you talk to them
about you know coming out
of the woods.
Well
I could talk about that
a little bit you know
and for us that's you know
our space in the industry
has been a little bit different and we've
kind of come out of the old school
especially Oakland
cannabis community here
and you know my
path into cannabis was
out of activism
been around longer than most
in the industry but not as long as most on this
call I think
but when we
got into the space you know one thing that stood
out I think that probably we can all
reflect on and remember
and appreciate was
this time when we were all
in a movement and
part of that for most of us was this
kind of sharing
economy right
you know and we
when I was just learning the
ropes and especially when we were starting to learn about
nursery and making great plants and
finding great genetics we had
a lot of help from people that
frankly had every reason
today they would have been my competitors
right but back then they were
like my comrades in
the movement right
it was about hey how can I
share this knowledge
how can I help
just quickly is someone banging on sticks behind
you I'm sorry that's my old dog
sorry about that
see what I can do
let me see
it's okay
there we go yeah bring him
in maybe he just wants
a little
helps
but yeah you know
so that's I think that lesson
is really stuck around for me we got a lot
of help up in the space
people teaching us the ropes
and
genetics was a big part of that back then right
it brought to us
great genetics in space and the
reason we all did that
back then
I lost it
but the reason we did that is it
like back then it was like no one knew
who was going to be around from day to day right
you know anyone
could get popped at any time and
you know if you had great
genetics more
than taking pride of
ownership which none of us did at the time
or even really more
than making money off of them or anything
else it was like this is a
product that we want to make sure
continues to exist in the world somewhere
right
and so I think
like obviously that's changed so
much today right but
part of the work that we do is trying to honor
that that kind of spirit
and it's interesting how it's changed because
now it's about like well hey we've got this
huge stable of great genetics
people have done phenomenal work I mean
you can't think of any other comparable
any other crop where
people have done who have really
done craft breeding in the way that
they have with cannabis and made such phenomenal
improvements in the crop right
and so now I think you know kind
of the way we try to repay
that you know
sort of like represent that
community that sharing economy
that community of collaboration
is by
creating these like
collaborations where we can help make
sure that people do have access to market and be
and you know now it's about you know can
we recognize this work that people have been doing
for a long time and make
sure that they participate as the
business of cannabis
starts to develop and grow
and I think it's just
anyway we're glad to be
part of it and it works really well for our business
we're able to have an awesome you know
great library of genetics
and hopefully we can help
give back to the
broader community as we do that
so I mean you and Nat
are both I mean you're
commercially established
in the California market but you're both
craft breeders and none of this is
so old so you know
you guys are in that bucket can
you talk about your collaborations
between Dark Heart and
Humboldt Seed
Company and kind of like your own
like each of your journeys and then
kind of
how you're collaborating with others
and how you see the docs and the
and the shape shifters of the
world entering the
the market
yeah I have to say
I mean it's been like honestly my honor
working with Nat and
finding Nat and Ben and the Humboldt Seed team
over the last couple of years
you know
it's one of
those things people don't you know
people who get into cannabis now they don't have a lot of
you know we talk to so many people
especially business facing people these days
you really have to try
to it's so hard to explain
right I'm like close your eyes and imagine
a different time in a blank space
one of the things like I tell people
I worked with people
for years I mean I probably worked with people for
almost a decade in the cannabis
space who literally never knew my name
right
so
meeting Nat and Ben
and the rest of the Humboldt Seed
crew for me it's like
this is one of the cool things about coming into
the permitted
and you know well the regulation
part isn't so good but the legal side is
nice one of the nice things about
it is we're actually like so
many of us have been operating
for so long with this
innate distrust
and this like separation and always
being sort of
even when we were sort of like medical
right there was still this element of
I don't really want I don't certainly don't want
people to come to my farm I don't want to
know too many people I don't have too many
connections right because those
are all sort of liabilities
and so in this new market one of
the things that I've really enjoyed
and you know just a really
nice part of it is like we're sort
of able to like really meet
it sounds so weird to say but like we're sort of able to
really like meet and
and get to know each other in
a way that like we just didn't have
the opportunity before so
you know when I met Nat
and Ben one of the cool things was
to be able to do that and see
like just like how much we had in common
how much common experience
even like not knowing each other in
the space or elsewhere
just to kind of compare notes on our
on our common journeys
in the space and it's like I
don't know to this day we're still like always
kind of like retracing our steps
sometimes and it's like I think maybe we were
in the same place at a certain time and we
just never anyway so I'm getting
it aside but it's really been our
pleasure working with you Nat and I'll turn it over
to you because you probably talked about it a little bit better than me
You're
muted Nat
Oh weird okay well you
two Dan and
you know you're absolutely
right it was
I remember when we did
first start kind of
in talking about sort of
developing the
the relationship that we have
as a business
relationship we did we realized
you know oh I think we were at that
same protest
and we were you know
at the similar rally
and you know all of the
different kind of activist stuff
that
I think you know
and it sounds like like Doc as
well and you know
I know Dale's a great guy
but I think that that's
that kind of stuff
makes this whole
transition into
you know I always
cringe but into this industry
that we are in right now
feel a little bit more
comforting and sane is that
you know we can
trace our steps back and it
it did a lot of the
time it it's pretty you know
rootsy like just
our common
threads like you said and
you know
Dark Heart Nursery
I have to give a
ton of credit to
Dark Heart for really
being this incredible
platform
for a lot of small
breeders not
just you know Humboldt
Seed Company but I mean just
literally I can't even
begin to list
off how many different
folks or companies or individuals
whatever you want to call it you guys
actually you know
gave
a wonderful platform
to to get their
life's work
out into
into the
public and I think that that's when it comes
down to it I know that it's
hard to sometimes
you know sort of
give up this thing that you
feel like I mean
you're not really giving it up but like
I had a breeder call me one time
is actually the guy from
from Family Tree
Seed Company and
and he just said you know I have
this variety that
I've kept to myself
I haven't shared it with a single person
but it's just amazing and it's
and he just asked me like how did you
get to a place
personally where you
felt like it was okay
to share and it wasn't gonna get
you know
stolen or just
used and I
what I said was just
hey you know if you
created something that is so
amazing what makes you think
that you won't just be
able to do that again and again and
again and you know
you're obviously a creative
spirit and
I think that creativity wants
to be shared and
so I just encouraged him to
put it out there
with the world because how are people gonna
know you know
like
if what's his
name Banksy never
you know
spray painted in a public
place you know we would
not get to see how
awesome his
graffiti
I love the analogy
I gotta grab a charger for my phone
but keep talking I'll be right back
So Dale why don't you jump
in and talk about
you know kind of
when you're talking to breeders kind
of the variety of reasons
why they may want to
protect themselves
and try to find people who can help
them bring cultivars
into the commercial market
and feel like they're not going to be
screwed over that's one of their
reasons for wanting to protect themselves
you know I'm
sure there are a lot of people in this
audience that are
maybe too young to relate to
this but they might still relate to
it because of their own experience on the other end
of it and
where I'm going with this is as Nat
was talking about the
kind of the hesitance and the concern
that a breeder has
to take something that
they were involved
in bringing to the world
and that is extremely special
to them but
that is so special that it can
change the world or it can help a lot of people
that they feel a lot of concern
about how do I put that into the world
in the right way without
having it get ripped off
or
taken bad advantage of or
whatever without it really
meeting its purpose and
what that sounded like to me a lot is a
parent sending a kid off to college
right and
if you
have ever had the luck of
being able to have a kid that wants
to go to college and not all of mine
do but you know when you
send a kid off to college what are you thinking
about you're thinking damn
I hope this is a safe place
I hope they have good friends
I hope they have
good classes and I hope that they
get to realize their dreams of
having of doing something
great and in
a lot of ways it's similar
it's not the same
but it's similar you know you put
like Doc was saying you put your life
into making something
special and you know it's
special and you'd like other people to
A. appreciate it
B. not steal it
C.
really benefit from it
and you kind of like
to have some
recognition for all the work that you did over
those years
the work that
we do in my firm
in my law firm is really
about
it's not about
minimizing access
it's not about
extracting ridiculous
fees it's really about making
it so that a plant breeder can get
paid for their life's work
and people can enjoy their work
and that it's
safe to put it out there
you know if every
if half of the kids that went to college
came home in a pine box because
college is so dangerous people wouldn't send their kids
to college right
but if you have a pretty good confidence
that it's going to be a good experience
and that you're doing
a responsible thing by putting it out
there and that you'll be glad you did
send your kids to college and
advice you know again this
analogy breaks down and I could
I could have people tell me all the ways it breaks
down but our job
in the IP space
is to just make
it
help people get what they
where they want to go and we don't tell
them where they should want to go but
if they want to get a special
cannabis variety out to
help a lot of people who
could benefit from that
and they also wouldn't mind getting paid for
all the decades of work that they've done
that's
kind of what we do we help them
figure out the right mechanism
legal mechanisms to protect
it so it won't get ripped off
we help them make good
deals with people that
they already trust see
the thing is a good
agreement isn't really
meant to protect you from somebody
that you already know you can't trust
it's really just to spell out things
to somebody that you already do respect
and trust that you want to work with
so there's no ambiguity and there's no
misunderstandings and if somebody
you know inherits
the company or
steps into a different role
it's more than just a handshake
it's really clear it doesn't have to
I was just on the phone with a
client today about the fact
that sometimes
lawyers it
seems like they want to win a deal
instead of make a deal
that will have long-term value for both
parties and they actually mess
deals up because they're trying to make
sure they can squeeze in every advantage for their
client and I just don't
I believe in doing
doing the right thing for my
clients and helping them make good
deals but the good deals are the ones that
last for a long time and the people
are glad they made
five years in ten years in whatever
and so
the other thing I want to say is just
along the lines of
what
Matt and Dan
were saying is that
my
favorite thing about working in this industry
is the people I meet
and I realize you know I
came to this as a patent attorney
and a plant scientist I wasn't
raised in the cannabis
community like some people and
I've been in it for seven
years now but that's
that's a
just a ripple compared to the time that
some people have in the industry
and but what I've noticed is
I can't claim
that this is mine
but I've seen it
it's really a community
with a culture
that is finding its way in
an industry and what we have
to do is we have to sort it out
you know we can't change the fact that it's an
industry as soon as government makes it legal and
starts taxing it there's going to be big interests
that come in and
grab their seat at the table no matter what
but if we can
grab a few seats at the table or a lot of
seats at the table for people who've
been in it for a long time and who really have
good values
and preserve
that sense of community and culture
and have it not just be an industry
that's it that's a hell of a goal and
that's one of the goals that we have
and it gives me tons
of satisfaction to
feel like we're
all of us here
are making
some progress towards that goal that it's not just
a heartless industry
so Dale
can I come at you with some
audience fastballs
absolutely okay
so
here's a tequila drink
yeah here's a toast
CD Soul Shine growing
the growers
have common thread but the IP
lawyers are outsiders injecting
themselves no offense to anyone IP
lawyers were never there until investor money
they need they feed on
gummed itself into our culture
and then follow it up with just
look at the history of big ag like
Monsanto the IP theft and money
games we don't want that do we
I agree
we don't want that
and one of the things that I've
talked about before is that
big ag is going to be here
there's nothing we can do to
stop them all we can do is not bring a
knife to a gunfight
we have to be
we have to
protect our own and I
realize I'm not worthy to call this my
own or our own but I'm doing
what I can to help
I would invite anybody who
who is concerned about big ag
to look at my blog on plant
law.com I've written a couple
things about standing up to big ag
and
and how to
basically what
that seat at the table can look like even
we cannot keep big ag out
what we can do is make sure that they don't
dominate the entire industry
in talking
about patents
I realize if
this whole community
and culture has been nothing
but persecuted by the federal government
for almost the entire
time people have been doing
this and then suddenly
a lawyer you've never met
comes in and tells you
yeah
here's this federal agency the U.S.
patent and trademark office
and I can help
you get federal rights if you think
get away with this federal
agency
I don't want to deal with the feds
I don't trust the feds
and all I can say is
take a look at it
I'm not going to tell any
I love educating
people and helping them understand things
but I'm not going to try to change anybody's mind
if they have strong opinions
but what I can say
is and this is also something I blogged
about
is that the federal
agency is
a very hostile
agency
and we have a lot of
enemies that are just obnoxious
and are not our friends and they're really
our enemies
the U.S. patent and trademark office
even on the trademark side
they're really hostile to
to cannabis
if you file
oh look that's cute
I'm naked in the
kitchen sink
Peter you're not supposed to mention that
not you
Dale I'm talking to the baby
I don't have a kitchen sink that big
carry on Dale
okay
so it's understandable that
people think that every part of the federal
government is their enemy and
that all lawyers are their enemies and I
I'm not offended by that because
I think that's honestly true
I mean although I know a lot of
really good lawyers in this industry who are
trying to help
but the one thing about the patent
side of the USPTO
is that okay
I'm just going to take a second here and explain the reason
that you can't get a federal trademark
on
something that touches the plant if
it's not hemp is that
the trademark statute requires
that you use something in commerce
and you can't legally use it
across state lines
and since you can't legally use it across
state lines you can never provide the evidence
you need to qualify for a trademark
and that's why they're just not
they're just not even going to entertain it
on the other hand the patent statute
even though it's the same office the patent
side of this of the USPTO
has a different statute and their statute
just asks
is it new
is it obvious is it adequately
it's eligible for a patent and the USPTO
has been allowing cannabis related
patents since the 40s
it's never had a problem
think about this the USPTO
is not about
legality or even or safety
you know you can if you have
if you invent some new drug
you can get a patent but that does not
substitute for the FDA clearance
to make sure that you can sell that
drug you know the pharmaceutical
you can
so having a patent
is not the
same as the federal government saying
this is legal go use it
the USPTO does not look at
legality or safety they leave
that to other agencies like the FDA
and the EPA and
the FBI and the DEA all of our favorite
agencies right but
my message is the USPTO
is not
the patent side
of it is not your enemy
when it comes to protecting your rights
the other thing I would say is that
some people just hate the notion that
anybody would patent the plant the plant is
sacred and the plant is
a special creation
a special thing and I
don't disagree with that but let's look at
okay you've got creative people
you've got people you've got artists
who create a great
painting they've got copyright
protection on that from the moment they create
it it's automatic they don't have to file for
you got an author that writes a book
it's copyrighted the moment they create
it they don't have to file anything they can
file registration if they want to do certain
things but they've got copyright
protection automatically
same thing with with a musician
and so copyright
protection is automatic and it makes it so that people
can do open source and licensing
and things and still have some protections
and still get paid and they don't have to
hire a lawyer to do that
the problem is that kind of protection
is not available for plant varieties
so if you're a plant breeder and you
work every bit as hard as a musician
or a movie producer
or an actor or an artist or
an author
and all you want to do
is get paid for your work and have it be respected
and protected the same way as any
other creative person but you can't
use copyrights the only thing that's
available to you is either
a whole hell of a lot of trust and only
working with good people or
if you really want to put it out there in the
world and have some confidence
that it's going to be safe
you get some intellectual property protection
and since it's not automatic like a copyright
you get a patent
of some sort and that's
what we do to help people
so I would also say
this whole thing about the lawyers came
in when the investor money came in I came in
when somebody asked me to give some
advice about cannabis intellectual
property for a non-profit
it took me years of being in this
industry before I ever had a paying client
I've been doing
my firm now for not
quite two years and
we haven't made a profit yet
we've got a great team
and we make payroll for them every
week and I'm proud of that but this
is not if I wanted to
chase the money I would have gone to one
of the big firms that was recruiting me when I started
my firm and this is I intend
to be successful and I will be successful
in this firm will be successful because we're
working with great people but
if I were about chasing the money I'd be
doing something different than this.
Yeah Dale I'd love to chime up on that one
too because
you know from like the farmer's perspective
I think you know I heard that part about
the lawyers came in when
the money came in right
and
you know like what rang through my head
is like well like of course right
because what happens when the money comes
in is people start grabbing right and
that's what we saw and so yeah the lawyers do
come in and
a lot of times the lawyers come in and they start
grabbing right but
you know there's a difference
between that and I think that's the clear that's people
see that that's obvious right and we all know
it and hate it
especially in this context right so grabbing
something that they didn't earn they didn't make they don't
have any right to in the first place right
but I think
our response to that and what you know I
think like it or not our response to that
is we've got to have we've got to have lawyers
representing us and our people and representing
the work that they've done and
you know someone said
you can't bring a knife to a gunfight
right and it's the same kind of thing right you know
we're trying to make the work that you're doing
and the work that we should be doing in the
space is you know that
that legal work and patenting
work if that's the right Avenue
to make sure
that we can that we can protect because
we are in a new environment we're
different than it was before people
will take it and they'll take it not because
they want to make sure that the world
has it and has access to the medicine
and everything else they'll take it because they want it
in their in their
in their portfolio right
I completely agree
with that and I'm not going
to monopolize this whole conversation
but there is one thing I wanted to mention that
builds off of what Dan just
said that I think is really important
there are patents of all kinds of different
scope some patents are as narrow as
a copyright the only
way to infringe that patent is you make a direct
copy of somebody's genetics
there are some other patents that are still limited
to a particular variety
that somebody made and it's
just different ways of protecting that variety
so it might be that you could infringe
that patent by making
clonal copies or by making seeds
or by using it in a breeding program but
if somebody created something and
they're putting it out there to help the world
or to just get paid and there's nothing
wrong with getting paid if you
just spent your life building something like
Doc has for example
but those are still patents that
nobody's going to accidentally infringe
and frankly
I think the accidental infringers
that do $10 worth of damage
they're never going to be sued
by anybody ethical anyway and if
they are sued by somebody unethical
I've got a whole bunch of people
who feel like I do that we would
come to your defense and do what we could to help you
there are other
patents that are extremely broad
and aggressive and that people can
accidentally infringe and I'm not
in favor of those
and so an analogy I've used
before is if you
if you're standing in a school zone
and some 18 wheeler goes by 90 miles
an hour
you would be
you'd be pretty pissed off
that doesn't mean
that everything
that would drive through that school zone
is the same though you could also see
some you know a family car
going slow or a moped or something like
that or a bicycle and
you wouldn't get those things mixed up
you would base it on wow how dangerous
is that how irresponsible is it and
how much harm is it going to do and
I don't expect people to know this until
they take a close look but that's why I blog on
this topic
not all patents are the same some are
ridiculously broad aggressive
and harmful
to everyday people
like the ones that we're talking to and
about others are just
a way if the only available way
of protecting what you've spent your life
creating and I
don't mind people hating the first
kind but I get a little defensive
when they hate on the second kind without really
understanding the difference because what they're
really doing is they're
attacking the only
way that somebody like my friend doc
can really protect what he's created and
get paid for it
so Dale just quickly
can you talk about a particularly
egregious
plant patent either application
or actual something that's
been approved
at least provisionally
that's come across your
radar? Well the one
there are two that everybody
talks about and I've talked about before
and they're examples
of the kinds of things that get people all worked
up
one is well
and it's actually a family of patents there are a few
patents that are chemotype patents
and if you want to read about this more you could go
to plantlaw.com and
find the blog that is titled
can I patent a chemotype
and these patents
claim things
their claim their main claims are this broad
it's basically here is a
ratio of
CBD to THC
and yes there is tequila
in this class so hopefully I'll hang in
there with the art with being somewhat articulate
but so there's a certain ratio of CBD
to THC and
there's a profile
of terpenes that is
not mercine dominant
and you know if you're
and you know if these guys were really the
first to ever create
a cannabis plant that had those
characteristics and they could show
how you would do that reproducibly in
a lot of genetic backgrounds
they may well be entitled under the patent
laws to that kind of a claim
because they would have contributed that
to the so-called as the Constitution
says the progress of science and the
useful arts but
what a lot of people have told
me is okay they're describing
Jamaican lion and a lot of other
things that have been around for a long time
before they ever filed their patent
now if that's true that patents
not valid but it sure is getting
a lot of people worried because they look at that and say
I mean I've had numerous
people ask me
how do I make sure that I'm not infringing
this patent
because I've got this THC to CBD
ratio I've got this different kind of
terpene profile
what the hell what do I do
and sometimes
the only answer is
I don't believe that patent
is valid and if you get sued
on it we'll be here to help you defend
it and there might be a whole army of people
will be here to help you defend it because
they would like to see that patent ruled invalid
in court now it's interesting that patent
has not been asserted in court
and I'm happy about that
I think that it might be that
the people who got that patent
did not know that what they
were claiming really wasn't new
and that they did it in good faith and that they
spent a shit load of money on a patent
that they only later realized
might not be valid I don't know
I don't know their intentions
or their business plan behind that
that's one example another example
is the one that was litigated
in Colorado until the
plaintiff went bankrupt
this is the United
Cannabis versus Pure Hen Collective
and
the plaintiff has since gone bankrupt
yes was that like in
the past couple months?
it's been relatively recent and
there are different flavors of bankruptcy
just like there are different kinds of patents
some of them are damn
we're done we're out of here you guys sort
it out and then there are other kinds of bankruptcy
where it is just give us
a minute back off you creditors
let us catch our breath let us get our act together
and we'll be back to fight another day
I don't actually know which
form of bankruptcy the plaintiff
entered into
but I know that at least I think I
know that the case is not currently
active is it finally settled
I don't even know that so
that's not really the point the litigation
status is not
the point of this discussion
it's really answering your question about
over broad patents this patent
had claims to any liquid
formulation that has
cannabinoids in it
where one of the cannabinoids
is 95% of the
total cannabinoid amount so
that's not the same as
a liquid formulation is 95%
pure cannabinoids
it's basically it could be as dirty as you
want the way this claim is written it
could be any liquid formulation
that has cannabinoids in it if
it's 19 to one or
more of a particular cannabinoid
and they have a claim where the cannabinoid
that is dominant is CBD
and they have another claim where the dominant
one is THC they have another one
where it's THC plus CBD
and somehow that got through the patent office
and I'll come back to that if we have time
but
then they found somebody to sue
and I think their goal again I'm just
I don't know
any inside information about this
precedent people behave
I think they were hoping to roll up
one relatively
small defendant
and tell them to surrender and take a settlement
and then go tell the rest of the world look
we've already succeeded this you better
take a license or you're next and I think
it was just you know it was a plan to
at least recoup their costs for this patent
but you know this plaintiff
this defendant fought back gallantly
and
another thing that's interesting a lot of people
say oh the patents are a waste of time because
the federal courts are never even going to let you enforce
a patent well this one sure did
the judge never threw it out
because it was a cannabis patent
the judge
even heard some procedural motions about
whether the case ought to be
thrown out for other reasons and the judge
ruled on those things so
you know you can't find precedent
from one trial court but at
least it's an indication that there's no automatic
impossibility
of enforcing a cannabis related patent
there's a lot of things in there that are
fact specific but bottom
line is
when patent examiners
get let's say I'm filing
a I'm looking for broad claims
ridiculously broad claims the
patent examiner's job is to do a search
of prior patents and prior
academic literature and anything else they can
find that was published and use those
things as a basis for the rejection
so if they can find what I'm claiming
in a published any kind of publication
they can say I'm rejecting
you because this isn't new
I'm rejecting you because this is obvious
now here's the problem
if I file an application
for a new jet engine or something like that
and the examiner is looking for
what I say is new they can
look at tens or hundreds
of thousands of prior patents
and tens or hundreds of thousands of prior
academic papers on
aeronautics or whatever the hell
and they've got no shortage
of literature that they can cite
to reject those claims think
about the cannabis industry I file
I file some crazy broad
claim in the cannabis industry
and the examiner is looking for okay
I'm going to look at all the prior patents well
the patent office has been issuing patents
on cannabis since the 40s but it
adds up to a few thousand at the very most
um uh
they look for prior
academic publications might even be
fewer of those that could be
on point because most universities don't dare
do cannabis research because it can imperil
their entire federal funding so
the point is the examiner has
certain tools that they use to reject
an overbroad claim they
don't have those tools in the cannabis industry
their hands are kind of tied so
they allow claims because they don't
have any good basis for rejecting them
but we as a community and I
just you know I
like to imagine that I could
be a contributing part of this
community even though I didn't grow up in it like some
people did but we
have the opportunity to if there ever is
a patent like that that is brought
in a way that just really puts a lot of people
at risk we can gather
our own knowledge about
what happened before that filing date
even if it didn't get published by
an academic or an prior patent
we can bring that evidence
to bear to try to invalidate
that patent and that will be definitely
one of the fights that I want to fight
and I know I won't be alone in it
that if there ever is a patent that
people know in their gut is
fraud to be valid and is
harmful to the community and the industry
that we'll
gather up the evidence to knock that
patent out and that would be
I don't, it wouldn't be about
getting paid it would be about making
a difference and
I wouldn't mind getting paid for that
but that's not the point the point
is that
the
overbroad patents hurt the perception
of all patents and
that makes it so that if
somebody thinks wow I wish there were some
way I could protect this thing I've spent
decades creating and working
on they already are under
attack from people who
have good intentions but
don't know those kind of subtle nuances
of maybe not even
so subtle of the difference between
overbroad patents and ones that are
a very appropriate
analog of a copyright so
that's a long ass speech for me
and I'm gonna sit back and
shut up and
I bet it's Mia's turn
to say something and she's been really
patient. We're gonna have our
art history interlude.
Oh no I just feel like I've been
basking in the knowledge
should we take some more questions
from the audience Peter?
Well I have a couple questions
and I have a mic so
Dan and Nat like
Nat because someone asked
you know I think
you are a very above board
practitioner
because like if you go to the
Humboldt Seed Company website
you can't like buy seeds right off the site
correct? So in terms of
you know if I'm in
Oklahoma and wanting to buy
your genetics like
because this is you
as a breeder who you know you're selling seeds
you could be selling clones so like
your business
model for getting your
seeds out there
and then kind of you know
I was talking to Mojave Richmond about
kind of the rename game
you know how do you protect
yourself against someone from
taking the
Humboldt Seed Company library
growing
it out making seeds
themselves and renaming it
giving it a sexy
sexier than purple panty dropper
which has since been renamed right?
Yeah
It's been acronymed
That was like my
early 20s that that one
kind of blurbed
out which was terrible but anyway
you know I think
that for one thing
I'll just caveat a lot of
of the patent stuff
with there is
to a degree
what do they say
imitation is the most
sincere form of flattery
and I really
do think that you know
people tend to
kind of get really
heated about
the whole
patenting discussion
and
for
like why I kind of gravitated
towards Dale
you know we initially
met when we were on the
board of directors of a non-profit
and the non-profit
Wait hold on didn't you guys
meet with me in Las Vegas?
Well I think
that was the first time we had met in person
Right right right
when you guys were like you're on the board
of
Yeah
so anyway we
we were engaged
in a fight and we
still are engaged in a fight
that is I mean there are
like Dale said there are thousands
of cannabis patents out there
that already exist
so if folks
are thinking to themselves like oh
patenting cannabis sounds like a slippery slope
well shoot
you know it's this is
I mean there's you can't really
ignore the
reality that's happening
all around you and
expect that it's just gonna
you know go away or change
on its own you have to actively
get up and try
to you know do something
to enact change and
make the world a better place
and it
oftentimes unfortunately
that
that
involves being
at least
well you know
like having a good understanding of
the system and how
you know you have to
to dismantle it you've
kind of got to understand how it
works and to get out
and stop some of these like
really really greedy
people and
you know what we're seeing this
we're seeing this phenomena where we have
like this literal like
ridiculous consolidation of
wealth that's happening
where you know
the Bezos's and
the you know Buffett's all
these Trump's all these people are getting
so rich and it's
just like we're headed down this path of
of like Hunger Games
reality and
and I know
now I'm getting completely off
tangent but
you know the even little
bits of trying
to get in there and sort of monkey
wrench that
reality by you know
like what
Dale has another well that we're working
on another non-profit that
Dale's sort of spearheading called the Ethical
Data Alliance and that
organization
I'm going to totally butcher this probably
but one of the things that
that group has set it out
to do and I'm a supporter and
occasionally able to plug in
but is
to just be
very aware of what's happening
in the cannabis space
to try to keep
these overly
broad patents and
you know
things that could really
come back to bite us all in
the ass later on
to try to get out ahead of them
and stop them and like one of the ways to do
that is to you know
work with the patent office
to make sure that
they know that
you know lo and behold
a lot of these things that you know
and I'm just
kind of creating sort of this
cliche evil
but like a Monsanto
like company that is
so well funded and
so well funded that
they can't just jump in
and apply for a bunch
of ridiculous
overly broad patents
and then get them because the patent
office doesn't know
shit about cannabis
we have to
actively do things
to stop that and so
you know if we just pretend
that none of this is happening
and you know
we're just sort of like idealist
ideology
and not
addressing what's real
then we're going to end up in this
situation of like
you know that farmer in the
Midwest
to no fault of their own
but that farmer had
was saving
I was going to bring the same example up so let's
hear it. Was saving his
own seed from
a corn grain mill
for since time
immemorial let's just say but
since his whole life and maybe even
his family and
that was how he particularly
grew corn every
year was to save
seed and a lot of people that's
just a choice some people would rather it's
easier for them to just buy seed
some people want to save seed but I think
that it's kind of like that's an inherent
right that you should be able to save
when you enforce
something completely different on people
around you. What I was going to say was
like we're
playing against either
a currently existing
Monsanto type company or a
Monsanto type company that's going to enter
the space that has
a team of lawyers who like
are super brainy
and we're like okay so these are the laws
well according to those
laws we could take our pollen
and an open top convertible
and just drive through Iowa
and impregnate everybody else's
corn and then sue them and
basically take over their farms
and we have a war chest to execute
this like legal business
offensive strategy
and so if you want to put your head
in the sand and pretend like
they're not coming
and
that poor guy
ended up getting
sued by Monsanto
because he was growing the corn that he
had saved from his own crop
and they even
won. They actually
won and he was not allowed to
grow his own corn from his own seed
because it possessed
the traits that
blew from their field
into his.
It's super cliche to be
talking about Monsanto
and all that but
what Dale is
diving into is not
headed in the direction
of creating
tons of little Monsanto
is like Doc
is not that.
He looks like it though.
Hey Peter
can I jump on part of
the way that you opened this
conversation because I think
that's an underlying
part of this too. We're talking
about patents a lot but what
I heard in the conversation you said is like,
what stops someone from
coming in and grabbing some Humboldt
seeds, calling it something
different and
putting it on the market, which is
an old school concern for us
and other breeders. There's always
this grab a strain, call it something
different and you're off to the races.
I think
there's
all types of intellectual property protection.
We've got patents, we've got
trademarks and
some of them are less formal too.
There's
trade secrets and
other forms of protection
as well.
I think we can't
underestimate this.
Some of that protection is
just inherent in the work
that some of these
breeders are doing. I think that's a good example
of that. When I look at it and you say
why doesn't someone grab
some Humboldt, why doesn't someone grab blueberry
muffin and call it something else
and put it back on the market?
To me, the reason is that
they could do that and they
wouldn't be Humboldt Seed Company and it wouldn't
be blueberry muffin.
That's
a coy way of saying that
the value... But that gets to
the brand value.
That's right. That's exactly right.
Actually, I'm not saying...
Coca-Cola has brand value but
they still protect that
ingredient list,
right?
Sure, but
some types of that protection may not be
in patent.
Trademarks is part of it.
Coca-Cola is protected.
Some types of protection
even for strains,
but I think it's more about
the name and the brand around the strain.
We've talked about this a lot.
Sometimes certain parts of
the breeding
space, even like in ornamental crops
for example,
sometimes that's a very... Cannabis is
a very fast breeding cycle,
right? Many breeders
are coming out with a new varietal every couple of months
or certainly every year.
Sorry, I know my dog is walking around again.
But
a lot of times,
those breeders don't even...
They can't
even take the time to patent
those varietals. If they do, the patent
is going to come down the line
at some point.
What they'll do is they'll trademark
the trade names associated with those
varietals. It doesn't matter that it's
this new
Marigold, right? It matters that it's
Marigold TM,
right? Because that's what everyone
knows it by. That's what all the customers are going to
go to the garden center and ask for.
By the time anyone creates
a new brand that matters in the space,
they're going to have a new one to launch.
Cotton candy
grapes are
definitely patented, right?
Cotton candy grapes?
We talked
about this.
Typically what they'll do is they'll
patent both, right?
You get the patent and you patent
ABC3204F
varietal, right?
Then you call it cotton candy
grapes and you trademark cotton candy grapes.
Then you're covered on both ends
is the normal
in the ornamental space. That's what we see most frequently
for sure.
Dan, with you,
you breed
a lot of different
varieties of
plants. I'm not a big fan of
genetics, but then I saw
you're selling Chili Verde clones.
That was HBK, right?
Then do you have some
of Nat's stuff in your
nursery?
How do breeders
trust you?
Can you talk about
that?
I should ask Nat, not me.
Nat, do you want to make Dan
uncomfortable and make him answer the question
of why you trust him?
You're muted.
I didn't want my loud dog
to be in the background.
I'm just kidding, Dan.
It sounds like a horse
is walking around the wood floor.
It's so funny.
Every time you start to talk,
he's like, I'm going to go for a walk now.
We actually
went to Dan and said,
Dan,
we have this
variety, this strain
that we feel is
special.
We have this amazing
platform to
reach the masses.
Would you do us the honor
of
putting this
genetic into your
production library?
Then we caveated that with
just a little proposal of
look,
we're going to
do a
little bit of research
on it.
I kept reiterating
that it's not about
the finances of it.
Honestly, I don't
even really need
like reporting
or anything like that.
But I think
that because we
put some effort into
it,
we were able to
get into where
we
highlighted
Dark Heart Nursery
as a very
valid place
to get this
fairly new
and exclusive
and unique
strain.
And
I think that
we're going to
benefit you
and us
mutually and that it
will be really
symbiotic and that
this kind of a thing
might take off.
We actually came up with a little
agreement.
I don't even know where
that document is.
It was basically
basically
saying,
you know,
we never
need to
have and go
see an arbitrator about it.
Because if it's not working
for both of us,
then what's the goddamn point of it?
If it's not
helping Dark Heart
to have
validated,
and if Dark Heart's
not, you know, getting
the genetic out to the world
and bringing us,
you know,
bits of credit and things like that
and helping us to, you know,
I mean, the whole goal is to get
more people to grow cannabis.
And when it comes down to
it, we want to see everybody,
if they want, we want
them to be able to have access
to cannabis
seeds or
clones. And I think that's
why a lot of us have joined
into the sort of nursery
space or the breeding space
is because we
think that it's a really
fun thing to do. It has
medical value
for sure, and it has
recreational value.
And I mean, shit, you know,
like Dan took us down
to go to the, you know,
where you go and look at all the different
nurseries that do their
thing in the spring.
And we just had so much
fun that weekend because
you know, we're just sitting around thinking
about, you know, Grandma
Betty,
you know, goes every year and gets
the new marigold that she's excited
about. And why
wouldn't she want to also pick up the new,
you know,
new auto flower so that she
can just grow it on her patio.
And then next thing you know,
she's using
it to make some topical
to heal her
aching muscles.
I like Grandma Betty.
I like to remember sometimes, you know, that
when I got into the space, some of you might
remember this, the catchphrase
was overgrow the government, right?
So
I kind of took that as a personal mission.
And I think we're,
we did a good job of that back then.
And now we're overgrowing the government.
That's right.
But yeah, you know, and Nat,
thank you for sharing that.
I think, you know, to your point,
you know, one thing that's
like always been important to us is,
and actually kind of to the point about different
ways to protect your work, right? Like
one thing that we saw in the space as we
started to set up more formal agreements, again,
that's kind of like a nice thing about, for years,
you know, it was like,
we've got strains. I don't know where we got. I couldn't
tell you where we got them. You know, we collected
them over the years. They were out there
and we picked them up.
And I don't know, and
maybe I should, but maybe I never will
know who bred them in the first place, right?
But
one of the cool things about this market is now we
can know, but also, and you know, Dale
will, I think, attest
to this, like there's these big pools
of genetics
that have been on the market that people
have created and may not be eligible
for formal patent
protection and stuff like that, right?
And so as we started to look at
how to engage with breeders, it became,
it's one of the reasons that it was always important
to me to say like, look, I don't care
how much you like me or anything else, like I want
for us to have a real
agreement where we say, you know, we're
going to grow your stuff and we're going
to pay you for it. And
you know, that, because that
kind of contract protection has
value in it as well, right? And especially
in the absence of
maybe having access to some of the other
types of intellectual property
protection.
Yeah, that's absolutely true. I'll just jump in
here and confirm that.
There
are so many ways of making new cannabis
varieties and there are so
many new and really
good varieties out there. The ones
that get patented, it's a small fraction.
And I always
tell people it's not whether it's patentable,
it's whether it's worth patenting.
Do you want to spend your money on this?
Or, you know, it's
got to have kind of a long
lifespan of viability, of high
value and likelihood of
being abused before
you really want to spend your money on a patent. But
if you got something as special as
for example, many of the things
that DACA's created, they're going to
still be special and in demand in 20
years. Then if
it's not too late to patent it, you
probably want to.
But yeah, there are a lot of
great things that never got patented
and are been around the block
too many times to be patented. And
in those cases, you just try to pick people
that you, if you still have any control
over the genetics at all, you try
to pick people to work with
that you believe you can trust.
You have good agreements that can
kind of touch all the bases
of the things that make a good long-term
partnership or even a good season
by season partnership.
And
then you recognize that
in that system, in any
system, nothing's perfect. There's going to be a little
there's no amount of
money somebody could spend on security
to make sure that not a
single reproducible cell
ever leaked out
in somebody's sock or whatever.
These things happen. And so
you recognize that when you
have an agreement, you can
enforce, reach a contract
against the party that you made an agreement with.
But you can't go get the rest of the world
if something slips out.
And that's the reason, that's what, that's the extra
help that patents give.
It gives you enforceability against people
you never made an agreement with.
And those are often the ones that are doing you the most
harm. But having said
that, you can, you
don't have to run and hang your head
because in
the end, you're going to be in sorrow or shame
because you don't have a patent. You've got something
special. There are ways of still
getting it out there and making
good deals and being smart about it.
And that's really the way
most cannabis varieties
are being handled. So
patents are just one
slice of the,
one of the many options that people have.
Yeah, you know what,
I appreciate
that, Dale,
you've really taken this,
you
kind of carry this
weight on your shoulders a lot
of
this subject, which does tend to
be heated. And I think, you know,
like if Doc, Doc, I hope you're still
with us. I want to hear from you a little bit because
you know,
like Dan said, a lot of
these varieties were probably
put out there by people that
just, you know,
didn't feel comfortable
because of the legality
issues. And you know,
sometimes it does take
someone like
Dale to be,
you know, sort of
an usher for folks to
maybe get their
stuff out and get their, get
themselves some credit a little bit, you know.
It was for
me for, I
mean, and just I
can only use myself as an example
of my relationship with Dale and what
got me to take the
step out and, you know,
move forward with what I'm trying to
work with. And that's really protects
something that I've worked on my whole life. And it's like
with our
relationship specifically, I mean,
that had to be trust, you know, he's come
and met me in numerous places
in various portions of California
over the last year, you know, I mean,
and people up
in this area, you know, you get it. I made
him drive all the way to northern end of Mendocino
County and meet me at the
Peg House the first time because, you know, I
didn't know who he was really well. So, you
know, just to come down and meet him on
neutral territory, you know, and then
it's over the last year we've spent
time becoming closer and closer
and now we speak on a regular
basis weekly
where, you know, we're either, I'm either texting
him or we're communicating on a pretty regular
basis now where I know he
has my best interest at heart
and I want to address something that was brought up
earlier in this conversation about
why
I, my thing
is more than anything is I don't
want, okay, I'm totally
anti big agriculture.
I, you know, I'm a Mendocino
boy, you know, we're the first people in
the union to ban genetically
modified organisms. I know what
fighting Monsanto is like
spending many, many years in
the military and seeing them be
in that community. I
have a firsthand experience with them
and seeing them do that. I
truly believe when schedule
one happens and it's not a matter if
it's a matter of when declassification
comes, all the big corporations
are going to jump in with both feet and
all little mom and pops. If you don't have your
stuff protected, they're going to come
get your seeds are going to sneak onto
your land as you guys alluded to
with the corn thing is to say
they have the wherewithal, the
legal, the evil doers
that will go out and go take your stuff
from you. My arrangement
with Dale is to help me be
prepared if that does happen, because
especially on my medical
chemo bars that I'm that I
work on that they stay open
to and part of our agreement. How do I
how can you do that? I'm
giving him the rules of how
it's going to be applied
how humanity has access to
my plants. He's given me
complete say so on everything
everything that we do is run between
me and his team. You know
again, the most ethical
most open, honest,
caring, kind, one of the nice sweetest guys
again, I love him like a brother
you know, and he has done a world
of good for me personally
having the face to step out
and be an exposing me to
the medical professionals that you know
quite honestly, they don't want
weed from freaking the University
of Mississippi. They want weed from Humboldt
County to test on their
patients and you know now I'm
getting off topic here, but now
Dale's interaction in my life has put me
in places with Nathan
or excuse me with Ethan Russo and
with Sue Sisley that weren't there
a year ago and they're both tops in their
medical fields now have access to what I'm
working with and we're all kind of working
on a common thread on one of my
PTS strains that I've worked on
excuse me, chemo bars that I'm working on
so that's why I'm doing is because
Dale's giving me the ability to protect
what I've spent really you know, I've spent
almost 50 years of this craft
now and it's like that's part of what
I hope other young, other
old mom and pops that are true
one of a kind that we
all believe are in this area that we live
here in Northern California, you know that
80% of some of the finest genetics
on the entire planet are in this little
bubble, we'll step out and take that
just take a step, step out into the light
you know, engage him when he comes
up to K-Mud and is on the radio
talking, you know, be involved in the
community that I'm
trying to bring him into here
in our little, you know, our little bubble
that we live in up here, that's much
anyway, that's
I'm going to try to get up there in a couple weeks brother
and I'm just going to
say one thing about what you just said
I definitely
help you, you know, make good deals
but you were dictating
the terms about what this, what prices
get sold out to veterans and I really
respect that
veterans who need your medicine
are going to get a special pricing
and you know, that's
the shot that you call. It's
critical Dale and again
to answer people because I
had this conversation on Sunday
Sunshine Johnson showed up in my backyard
on Sunday and we did her can of a show
on live in my backyard
and that was one of the conversations that we had
was just that is how do we do
that? I'm setting the rules with
Dale's help on when
if you're going to have my flowers
in your distribution system, if it's
going to be in your dispensary, whatever that you agree
to our terms that when someone walks in
that is a veteran, they get special
pricing regardless of what you charge
civilians that come in to purchase that same
medicine. When a veteran walks
in or a first responder
or someone that really uses this plant
for post traumatic stress that
they are given what what my
wish is that they can receive
it at a fair economical
price and again I've done
this craft for a long long time.
I don't really want to debate
dollars per gram and all that kind of
nonsense. I know how this thing
slices down and there's a point in there
where there's still money to be made
at being
at being fair to that
particular thread in our community
and that's my driving force for being
involved in this and again
I want to protect what I'm doing
I don't look at this as trying
to keep it away from I'm doing
defensive plant patenting. That's how I'm
looking at this as I'm defensively
protecting myself for what I believe
is going to happen in the next 24 months
because the one standing
around and watching and waiting for it to happen
it's going to happen and as soon as schedule
changes ladies and gentlemen and we
all know it's coming. It's not a
matter of if it's a matter of when
that's going to open up the floodgates
and they're going to come rolling through this
area and try and sweep up everything
that's not protected. They're going to try
and take it from you and that's at least how I
feel about this and you guys
alluded to it like you said
Peter you know this
coming in on other other
agricultural crops where they could see an
opportunity to exploit the farmer and
take control of it and
that's just the matter of fact this
is a cash crop. It's
moving into that segment. It's
going to be decriminalized and
legitimized at some point in the
next 24 months probably
36 tops. It's going to happen.
That's just I'm being prepared.
I'm being
prepared. I'm trying to prepare my
the best way I know how to prepare
myself if something goes wrong and someone
tries it you know somebody comes in and tries
to take something I've worked my life on and
slap their name on it.
Try and change it and take
it away from the people and make it where people
can't have access to it and that's
again it Delves is allowing me to write
the rules you know he's allowing me to say
how it's distributed who gets it
what the price points are
the people that are getting it or have to agree to
that. I mean it's just things that I don't want
to get bogged down in. That's what
he does you know.
I respect your mission and your
you know, you know I know your
community and it's
it's really what your mission is
rock and it's
I mean we're lucky to be able to work with you.
All of us are lucky to know you and
know you and
so yeah it's uh
it's 2 it's 2 important brother
it's 2 important you no we there's
too much you know and we this group
specifically this is craft you know we're
not talking about commercial we're talking about
craft and this thread is
too important to let commercial
craft quality over mass production.
At least how I look at it.
Well, you know, I think it's like Doc's got, you know, this, it's a medicine and he's
got something that he knows can help with PTSD.
And I think that's incredibly special.
Somebody was commenting on like a thread about genetically modified cannabis this morning.
And I love that agave.
But anyway, so, you know, there's going to be this effort to sort of, you know, buy the
big pharma and big ag to just standardize cannabis and from a medical perspective, essentially
breed it so that, you know, there, I think that they would like to have this one kind
of cannabis that, that they own, as far as like they own the, they have a patent on the
varietal they have, you know, they've trademarked it.
They've got the drug administrate.
What's it?
No, they've got their, go ahead.
What DEA or who are you talking about?
Not that they've got approval for that food and drug administration.
So, you know, they would like to have, I think this, you know, water certain varietals that,
that they would then, you know, kind of try to advertise it as these are the things that
solve these well-known ailments that, I mean, we all know cannabis has proven medical benefits
and it's, it is.
Yeah.
Therapeutic qualities.
Yeah.
Therapeutic qualities.
And, and I think that, that they would like to just narrow it down and, and have, you
know, these be sort of the commodity that they control.
And someone made it, what I thought was an excellent comment on this thread.
And that was since when do diseases and ailments since when are they stable and consistent?
You know, that's, I think the beauty of cannabis and it's being a natural medicine is that
there are so many diverse things that, that it can help heal and the diversity of cannabis.
And it's, you know, the different effects that it has, you know, is kind of right in,
in step with the unfortunate huge amount of ailments that we have in our modern society.
And, you know, PTSD being one of them and, you know, the, it's, the numbers are growing
all the time.
And you know, I think that, that fortunately cannabis is such a thing that it does kind
of buck that, you know, sort of capitalist, you know, the, the pressure to turn it into
just like a single molecule drug that it, that will, you know, solve everything.
Cause we know it's got, you know, there's so much about the entourage of all the cannabinoids
and all of the terpene and all of the different the, the whole makeup of the plant and the
different strains that, you know, I, I do think that we don't, we, there's a lot that
we need to worry about.
And I believe in what you're doing, doc, getting out ahead of it.
And I believe in Dale's efforts with, you know, breeder's best and the ethical data
alliance.
And but I do think that fortunately, you know, cannabis doesn't want to fit into that.
You know, the little box that they are used to fitting drugs into.
Right.
Right.
Are we ever going to get beyond that point too?
You know, I think maybe even at this stage of it, it's like, because I know, and I've
had this conversation with Dale and I'm sure you guys have as well.
It's like, there's more than one way around the ball to accomplish this for, for everybody
to protect themselves on however they think is best.
You know, that's, I would rather, and I really, especially with my older friends here that
have been doing this a long time, that sit and watch and be quiet, you know, I'm just
not going to say anything.
And we just turned to, we just don't say anything about it.
And just if we, if they keep taking that approach, I believe in five years, they're going to
be run over, you know, and I don't believe that, you know, are we, are we going to lose
all those one of a kind?
Are we going to lose all those craft, true, one of a kind mom and pops?
And, and Dan, I don't know how far you are up in this way, but you know, you literally,
we get it a little bit now, like Terroir and stuff about from valley to valley, we have
strains of, you know, and, and genetics that breed over on each other because of the open
pollination thing, you know, not so much on what we do because we control our male pollen
pretty tightly.
I mean, I know how I practice with my boy farm, you know, it's just sealed isolated
area and I'm an old man screwing around, you know?
So my point is, is I see that we can, we can, you know, we can have an influx, an input
on where this goes as far as what, what genetics are kept viable.
I don't want to see any true one of a kind go asleep.
Like, you know, me being fortunate enough to go back and resurrect Raselberry Cush a
couple of years ago, it's like, was a major, major, I take that very personally, you know,
it's like to, because I mean, I don't know if you guys, you know, Dave's been gone for
10 frippin years, man.
And most people don't even know that that came from burnt ranch in the interior of Humboldt
County.
It's like, you know, just to even go back and go see Deb, his wife, who's 90 something
now, you know, and I haven't seen her in four years.
Is she even still alive?
You know, just all these things that, that stuff that just goes away.
And that, that was almost gone, you know, and now I've had an opportunity to bring it
back, stabilize it, breed it back, do a little selecting and pull out some really cool stuff
for it to try and isolate some stuff in this true one of a kind Humboldt County original,
true one to one CBD THC original, double purple, double indica that was, you know, was a mythical
unicorn just three years ago, even, you know, that was something that people talked about
that nobody knew where the hell it was from anymore.
But now it's coming back where there's seeds coming out, you know, hopefully this next
year seeds will be coming back out on it and plants will be available for people to have
plants to grow this thing again.
And to me, to Dan, I'm where you are.
I think we should be teaching people how to grow their own medicine, you know, that's
grow their own intoxicant, their own medicine, whatever they want to call it, their own recreational
drug of choice.
Okay.
You know, that's how I look at this now at this stage of my life.
I think what you guys are doing is admirable.
You know, I really, I feel quite honestly, brother, I feel so much better after sitting
on this panel with you and hearing your aspect of it.
I feel so much better about knowing that you're trying to carry on heritage and really preserve
what it is to do what we do here.
And it isn't a mass produced thing, even though you're ramping it up on scale, it's still
not a mass produced thing.
As we know, because we do it, each harvest is different.
Each batch is different.
It's all one of a kind.
It's all hand done.
That's the thing that I hope that as we ramp this thing up and you guys are doing, you
know, 100,000 square feet light under it, that you're still keeping that same kind of
heritage of, you know, the people that are handling the plants understand that, you know,
watch the old man walking around with a pair of scissors when he's in there because he's
leafing all the frippin' time.
You know, why are your buds big and fat and frosty?
Because I work my flowers all the time.
And I see in this craft, you know, 21 steps and they want to omit 14 through 18 because
it's a lot of damn handwork.
Yeah, it is.
Right?
So anyway, I've rambled enough.
I'll let somebody else talk for a while.
We haven't heard from Mia yet.
So I'd like to hear what she has to say.
Mia, what are you dabbing on right now?
Oh my gosh.
I'm dabbing on some Purple Punch.
I was loving the YouTube chat earlier when everyone was sharing what they're smoking
and helping each other identify turps.
It's amazing watching this community right here.
But this, let's make sure that focuses.
These are my Purple Punch.
And I do want to say, I don't know who mentioned it, but whoever was loving creamy turps, especially,
I'm right there with you.
My favorite flavor as well.
My favorite tombra.
Right.
So I think Nat's phone died, so he's probably charging it up.
But let me go.
All right.
Let's, while you dab.
Doc, I'd love to know what you were smoking earlier.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah.
Sister, I'm smoking my own flower.
Oh, I know that.
But like, what strain is it, if I can ask?
Actually, I just brought in my early run of my early Blue Skunk.
So it's coming out of about a five week cure right now.
So I'm doing some sampling of it.
And I'm old school.
I cure for a really by, again, something that craft and heritage are what I consider heritage
to what Peter's talking about in this thread is what something that we do specifically.
And I've talked to a lot of us as we're low and slow and we, we cure for a really, really
long period of time.
And again, right now I'm like in week five, just now starting to pull a little bit of
it out to see how it is developing in flavor and profile.
And it's really, really good.
It's real smooth.
Very aromatic.
If you like Blue Dream, this is very cerebral like Blue Dream is and I crossed it with,
again, one of my mentors, Dave, old Dave, what was called old Dave back in the day,
double indica that I labeled as a Mendocino skunk or a Mendocino skunk OG.
So anyway, that's my Blue Skunk that is part of what I'm working in bringing out to the
masses right now.
And that's what I'm working on right now.
Yeah, quality control, quality control.
Absolutely.
And just a regular pipe or what's your device of choice?
One more time.
Was that, was that just a regular like spoon pipe?
I didn't get to see what, what you were smoking out of.
What's your device of choice?
You know, I, I like glass just because it's, you know, it's just my preference.
I keep, I, well, okay.
In my personal regime, I have a little Tupperware that's full of alcohol and salt that I throw
my glass into.
And instead of buying the stuff that you make that they sell in the bottle, which is basically
alcohol and sodium salt, I make my own and I keep it a little thing and I clean it like
every day as I'm going through it.
So right now with the time of the year it is, I'm sampling a lot of stuff coming in.
So it's really important for what I'm doing specifically flavor profiling and things like
that right now.
So, you know, I'm keeping up on what's happening in my own backyard, in my own, you know, in
my own patch right now.
So between you and Dan, what are you pheno hunting and Dan, what are you pheno hunting
and from the personal collection are you smoking?
So talk about some pheno hunting you're doing right now.
Oh, well I'm playing with this orange cross that I've been tinkering with for four or
five years now that's like smoking a orange Julius that seems to be real popular.
So that's a real popular one.
And honestly, my very, my flagship strain, my pineapple blueberry or excuse me, pineapple
blackberry crush cross is just hard to beat.
Yeah, I again, I had someone that I have hold very dearly in my heart, sunshine Johnson,
the legend herself in my backyard on Sunday, and she was completely enamored with the number
one as well.
So that's a beautiful flavor profile.
You know, it's very, very, some loopy fruit right now, brother.
She's a she's a rock star, man, you know, loopy fruit and wonderlust.
You know, she's it again, we practice the same crap, but we talked about a little bit
earlier before I was laughing with with Nate on the thing is about the or excuse me, not
on the thing that we had some of the things that heritage crosses over.
I had some friends at her house, and she literally were out in her curing room, and she pulls
out a cardboard box full of buds, you know, sitting in a big old box cardboard box, 12
inches deep full of buds.
But let these guys are friends of mine go through and look at and they're almost floored
over but I laugh because it's the same practice of how I do it.
And she literally word for word said it was and I know her background and stuff is like,
where she learned it from was the same thing as we use cardboard boxes, we use paper brown
paper sacks, it's just part of our curing process of rolling and manipulating the flowers
that we all do the way we do it.
That is completely away from how commercial functions and I believe part of it, Peter,
honestly, is that's part of the unique flavor profiles that we are able to capture and what
we do.
You know, I really believe that that's a lot of it.
So, you know, for me personally, my number one that I have right now that's coming out
my blackberry pineapple cross is just it's a phenomenal, phenomenal smoke.
It's gorgeous.
It's sexy in the field.
It's good looking to look at it smokes like heaven.
It's divine and what it does to your mind and in about 20 minutes, if you got achy back
and achy joints, you go all of a sudden my back doesn't hurt, you know, and it's good
for three to four hours or two to four hours depending on what your tolerance is.
And Dan, so Nat, you are sideways right now.
Welcome back, Nat.
I thought I plugged it in, but I guess I hadn't and then it died.
Now what Dan's next, but we're just kind of talking about like what from what you grow
are you smoking right now and kind of what kind of give us an update on your pheno hunting.
So starting with Dan.
Well, Nat will have a much more interesting update for us.
We don't have any pheno hunting going on right now, but we do have our first and our breeding
program is so matured compared to what these guys have going on.
But we do have our first little cross in the ground right now.
So we're excited to, you know, kind of have our first generation plants coming out.
And yeah, probably be more like three or four months from now, we'll be starting to look
at what's coming out from that and what do we like and what don't we like.
And if anything, I'll make the chop.
But yeah, it's a long road.
You know, we're.
What's the parentage?
Well, right now it's kind of a we're doing kind of a broad.
I mean, I think we've got, you know, 15 or something, 15 or 20 crosses going on just
to kind of expand out the first generation.
Yeah, exactly.
We did have so our head breeder Kay did a fun project internally and she circled a survey
of the science team and they said everyone made their everyone made a had a pet cross
they did.
So we're going to it's an internal competition.
We're going to see if anyone's cross stands out this cycle.
But yeah, no, for us, it's very early days and not, you know, not nearly to the place
where we're selecting a major hit or anything like that.
But hopefully one of these days we'll have we'll have something in the ballpark of what
you guys have done.
Now, we're really, really interested over time, you know, in in developing some some
great hybrid seeds in the space.
But we know that's going to be a long project.
So Dan, yeah, yeah.
His land says I'm smoking on some Romulan.
I grew this season that cuts from dark art.
Super tasty.
Rob says dark arts has some wedding cake purple punch crosses this year, I think.
Yeah, that's that's right.
There was the Romulan was it was a good hit this year.
Absolutely.
That was that was awesome.
We're glad to be able to bring that into the lineup.
And I think the wedding cake crosses were from another partner that we work with, Purple
City Genetics, another local partner in in Oakland, had some those are probably the seedlings
where we're real keen on seeds long term.
Of course, we offer clones.
That's been our core product forever.
And we offer teams this year now, too.
But, you know, we're really bullish on seeds moving forward.
We offered some to retail this year and hope we can continue to grow that.
I just really believe in growing from seed in the long term.
And I think, you know, I tell people, look, we've been growing clones for 13 years and
it's a pain in the butt.
Talk about the market, because, I mean, for someone to walk into a dispensary and buy
some clones, what's kind of the clone versus like from a consumer standpoint, not a commercial
like I'm going to buy 5,000 schemes.
You know, and we're learning so much about it.
And I'm mostly learning from you guys on the call.
I've learned so much from Nat and his crews, especially, you know, we're always like, hey,
we think we know seeds.
And you guys are like, I don't know what you're talking about.
It's what's going on.
But, you know, some one of the OK, so let me tell you what we're learning, what's so
cool and it's neat about offering kind of different configurations this year is that
we're learning something that I learned way back in my community gardening days, which
was like right plant for the right place.
Everything starts with the right plant for the right place.
And that's about getting the right string for the right place.
It's also about getting the right type of plant for your growth.
And so, you know, clones are still really important.
So our biggest, still our biggest product.
And there's some very important reasons that you might want to select clones for your garden.
You're still going to get the most uniform expression of the plants from a clone.
Right.
If that's if that's if that's important to you, then you're going to go there either because
it's really important to you that you get exactly the smoke that you want or exactly
the medical effect that you want.
You're going to you're going to probably want to look for that clone.
Right.
Sometimes it's also important.
Maybe people have super uniform indoor grows and stuff like that.
And then for them, that clone is really important.
Right.
And then the other thing about the clones is cycle time.
Right.
Those clones are mature, fully mature, and they are ready to flip as soon as you give
them the right the right lighting cycle.
Right.
So if you want to maximize your turns or you're in the right time of year and you want to
make sure they go into flower right away, those clones can be really important for you.
Right.
But for the same reason, sometimes clones are a bad choice.
Right.
You know, for three years, we worked with backyard growers who would buy clones and
maybe they would buy them a little bit too early in the season or sometimes here in the
Bay Area, we get a lot of overcast days and it's not quite in the sunniest spot of your
garden.
Those those clones, because they're fully mature, they might flip into flower early
on and then you got a problem where they're they're reveging mid cycle.
And that's never a good scene.
Just never works out for growers.
And it's honestly like I tell you what, you know, as backyard growing is picked up and
I got like more of my neighbors and stuff like that, tap me on the shoulder like, Dan,
what's going on with my plants?
I tell you what's the number one thing I see with backyard growers, reveging plants in
you know, May or something like that.
They come out, what's going on with these things?
Or, you know, like more like June, probably they come out and like, what's going on with
these plants?
They're super funky, right?
They're reveging.
There's the clones that went out there too early and didn't get enough light, whatever
they get, they're popping out of it.
So now it's cool because the seedlings are a great solution to that.
Right.
So, you know, any seedling you buy any seedling and you've got a lot more flexibility planting
that plant early in the season.
It'll perform a lot better in circumstances that aren't quite ideal.
And you know, because it's got that, I call it, I don't even know if this is the right
term.
I call it like a window of juvenility, right?
You plant that seedling, it's not sexually mature.
It doesn't matter what you do with the light cycle.
It's not going into flower for a while.
Right.
So it gives the, it gives the grower a lot more flexibility with when they plant it and
they can have much better experience, much bigger yield.
It'll hit the, you know, once the lighting is right for it, it'll go right into the veg
cycle and then when it's ready to flower, it'll, it'll be done.
And you know, the other part, you know, the other place that seeds go, because seeds is
not like a monolith, right?
It's like what kind of seeds now, right?
Femme seeds, you know, conventional seeds, femme seeds.
One thing we're excited about now as well as auto seeds, right?
So a product that's like really near and dear to my heart that we worked with Nat on was
what we called the easy pot this year.
Right.
And so, okay, we addressed the early flowering thing, but then we still got, well, maybe
it's, you know, then maybe you had still have a very long crop cycle and stuff like that
or, or, so there were some other dynamics there.
And so we thought, what, couldn't we use these auto flowers to make like just a no brainer
product like anyone on earth, big, you know, big space, small space, whatever.
You could just take a plant home, set it and forget it.
And you're going to have a nice, a nice harvest at the end of the cycle.
Right.
So we, we worked with Nat and we got some cool auto flower genetics.
I think, I think the magic melon was the, was the big hit this year.
Is that sound right Nat?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got it.
So first of all, this is the easy pot we're talking about.
This is it.
So, you know, what we did with this is we said, okay, auto flower, we're going to get
out of flower genetics.
We're going to put them in these, you know, nice looking pots, arguably.
I think they're nice looking and they're not ugly.
They're not ugly.
All right.
I'd be, you know, it's dark heart branded dark heart color profile.
And we put yeah.
So we put a little slow release fertilizer in there.
And you know, for us, what we say is, look, if you've got small space, not a lot of time,
you're just interested in the plant and you want to see how it grows.
This is a good product for you.
You grab it.
Maybe you've got a balcony.
I mean, we've even seen people growing it like in a sunny window inside all sorts of
stuff.
Right.
But it's really like what we wanted to create was the simplest, the simplest way to get
started growing.
And, you know, and the idea is you could literally just come home every other day or something
like that, hit it with the garden hose and you'd be all right.
You know, about eight weeks later or something like that, you would have a great yield.
And so far, so far, so by the way, this is the magic melon that I.
So within four days, I went from putting the seeds basically in a solo cup of water to
this.
And I got 11 out of 11 seeds popping and germinating.
But between I think we I think Nat's phone died a second time.
But for for you and kind of on behalf of a Nat, like for you, what's the breakdown between
like the retail market versus direct to cultivator, like the commercial sales versus through the
retail channels as a business?
And you're talking about seeds and clones and then on behalf of Nat until he comes back
like in California specifically, what percentage of farms are I mean, excluding the farms that
just have their own moms or their own seeds, but like farms that source stuff from other
people like you or Nat.
What percentage are they buying seeds and planting from seed or buying clones or buying
if they're buying seeds, like what percentage of farms are buying feminized seeds versus
regular seeds?
And so I'm just kind of like, how is the market big, big, broad brushstrokes?
And where is it trending?
Like you mentioned autos, that's a whole nother auto femme, feminized auto, right?
Like, yeah.
You know, so I'm going to give you my impression, because actually, you know, at the end of
the day, we actually don't have a ton of data.
So, you know, it's going to be kind of anecdotal on my experience.
But, you know, we're seeing the, you know, of course, the retail market.
Well, one, I mean, I've been really impressed with the retail market this year.
You know, that's like kind of retail has been our bread and butter since we got started.
People will remember back in the day, the retail dispensaries were like the only permitted
part of the supply chain.
So everything went through there, right?
We sold clones through retail and people would buy 1000 off the shelf and start their commercial
growth.
It's just how it used to work, right?
And a lot of people thought that retail nursery space would go away after legalization, after
it became more limited.
But we've been really happy to see, especially this year, people at home with COVID and everything.
People have been really passionate about growing and cannabis is a great crop to grow.
And I think that we've really seen a resurgence in interest and people coming out, looking
for the plant, developing a relationship with the plant and bringing it into their homes
or backyards.
There's people like, I just love coming out of that horticultural space.
I just sort of love when people just enjoy the plant.
Even when like the weed and consuming the plant, sometimes it's secondary, right?
They just love growing the plant.
We work with folks like Joanna Silver, who's like, look, it looks great.
I like growing it.
It's fun to grow.
It smells great.
Like that's, you know, it's perfect for my backyard garden, right?
So that's been great.
And in that market, we're seeing just a lot of opportunity to innovate and offer new products
that are just more, you know, it's not about commercial or backyard cottage industry stuff.
It's like just like enjoyable.
What's fun to grow?
And stuff like that.
One of the reasons why stuff like the freak show is so cool to us, right?
It doesn't have to be a huge commercial hit.
It's just really interesting and fun and great to look at.
Looks cool in your yard.
And why wouldn't you want to have a couple of those in your yard, right?
Yeah, so that's kind of the retail side.
The commercial side, you know, I think is what we're seeing is, you know, kind of that
again back to that question of like right plant for the right place, right?
So we're really seeing sort of different interests develop in different segments for different
types of plants and different plant configurations, right?
Indoors are still by far the biggest hit in indoor grow.
Although one dynamic there is that a lot of indoor growers are now really interested in
teens, right?
You know, we, which, you know, in order to improve crop turnover, that's now with our
new production facility and Half Moon Bay, we're now able to offer a lot more of those.
So that's been kind of an emerging market for us.
And definitely as we see a lot more people interested in that.
So at a commercial level, the desire for teens as their starting material versus...
Yeah, especially for the indoor growers, it's just, you know, it really helps improve crop
turnover and then, you know, they can get a couple more cycles in a year and save some
space on veg.
That's a big hit for them, right?
You know, the interest in seedlings, I'm seeing a lot from especially like outdoor and field
growers, right?
I think that market will continue to develop.
It's really kind of emerging in the last two years.
You know, we've done some of our first really big seedling orders and we're all kind of
experimenting with it, trying different configurations, when to transplant those and what are they
going to look like.
But I think that over the next few years, especially for those larger scale outdoor
growers, we'll see a lot more interest for the seedlings.
That's mostly been in, almost entirely for that type of grower and feminized seed, for
sure.
And now we're getting more interested for the feminized autos.
But again, that's really early days, I would say.
We're seeing like a lot of dabbling, right?
People trying a small, you know, a little bit of acreage of autos to see how it works
and then maybe we'll try it next year.
I'm really bullish on that in the long run, though.
I think that some of the varietals are not like fully mature yet, but in the next couple
of years, I know Nat's working on a lot of autos and stuff like that.
As those autos start to develop, I think we'll see that really become more.
I call, you know, let's see, Dale, you're gonna have to start my timer on trademarking
this, but I have a, you know, I call autos like the, I call it the auto debt, right?
You know, it's like, hey, we used to spend all this time and labor and capital on light
debt, right?
And for me, the autos are just the perfect replacement for that.
It's like never pull a tarp again is like my motto with autos, right?
Well, what I thought was cool was Breeder Steve was talking about how like the country
of Columbia is kind of like 12-12 all year long.
So literally all you just have to do is pull plants out of the light assisted greenhouse
outside and it just finishes off like any month of the year.
Nat, Dan was just talking about you adding more autos to the lineup and kind of between
the two of you, because people are like in the chat, you know, some people look down
on autos, some people, but like, where's the role of an auto?
Like let's go from home grower to commercial cultivator.
So we are actively really working on autos.
I think, you know, it went from five years ago, you know, starting to play with autos
for us and not being super impressed.
And then immediately starting to make crosses of autos into, you know, some of our favorite
genetics from our own library.
And you know, honestly being pleasantly surprised at how well the trait transposes over into
what we call, you know, photo period or normal for at least for the US normal plants.
And so I kind of try to describe it to folks as just sort of like, and mind you, this is
not something that we're doing with CRISPR or any kind of gene editing, but essentially
just copying and pasting the auto trait into, you know, our favorite photo period type varieties.
And without a doubt that takes a lot of work and it definitely takes generations.
You know, sometimes we can do it in three or four generations and sometimes it seems
like it takes longer depending on the genetic.
But you know, there's other different methods that we're working with.
Intragression is kind of when you do what's kind of like a sort of goes against your gut.
It's counterintuitive to think that you would, you know, take crosses of autos and then just,
you know, even if you find a progeny that did inherit both the auto trait and the dank
trait, let's just say, just to not call it good and put that individual back into the
original dank plant, let's just say, and that's referred to as intragression.
And so we're playing with that just to sort of keep the genetics that we want to make
auto flower versions actually make sure that they're really true to form and not just,
you know, kind of a sort of mashed potato auto of, you know, the original auto flower
mixed with the one, the target photo period line.
And so we're finding that that is well worth our effort because it's pretty frickin'
awesome to be able to just, like Dan said, to just plant a seed and, you know, not have
to buy a whole bunch of plastic that, you know, is required for light depth.
I mean, you know, if you've been around to enough grows and humble, that's I think
like, you know, I'd say generally, you know, for the most part, the cannabis industry
folks try to reduce waste as much as possible.
And we try to, you know, be environmentally conscious.
But, you know, that in my opinion, tends to be one of sort of our weak spots is all the
plastic that's associated with light depth production.
And if we can get away from that, then, heck, I'm all for it.
And, you know, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using traditional breeding practices
and selection to try to, you know, create auto genetics that have the same, you know,
cannabinoid content and the same terpins and are just as dank as photo periods.
But you don't need plastic and you don't got to, you know, you don't have to fucking
be up at 6 a.m., you know, pulling that tarp over and then, you know, be back at 930 when,
you know, you're trying to.
So I don't know that that cider is kicking in and and my phone kept dying on you.
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know why the charger was not working, but I think I got it fixed.
Long story short, there's absolutely nothing that's inherent in auto genetics that says
that they can't be just as good as any photo period variety.
And that's a common misconception that I felt strongly about up until about a year and a
half, two years ago.
And I finally just, you know, I had to accept the reality that that these things can be
just as good as photo periods.
A hundred percent just as good.
There's nothing that like I said, there's nothing that's inherent about autos.
And, you know, I see you looking back at the the Magic Melon autos there, Peter.
I mean, that's something that we're proud of.
But it's not, you know, like for anybody that's that has grown it, that's not like the final,
final, you know, we kind of are constantly balancing as a steed company, you know, trying
to sort of being perfectionists.
And then that whole, you know, sometimes done is better than perfect.
But it's like that.
I'll tell you the weight that we feel on our shoulders sometimes by, you know, creating
these things that people are going to base their whole economic situation for themselves
and their families and, you know, potentially the communities.
Just having that.
It's a lot.
It's pressure.
And I don't we at Humboldt Seed Company do not take that lightly.
And, you know, sometimes it's just like you brace yourself.
And we but we always we're doing a lot of R&D.
We always do R&D.
And if you got if anybody wants to check it out, there's a couple when Dan was talking
about the feminized and and growing them at scale.
We early this spring, we did a 5000 plant R&D project at a local farm here in Humboldt
called High Grow.
That's H-Y-G-R-O, High Grow Humboldt.
And you can actually, you know, if you don't believe it, you can take a look and see that
the 5000 fem seeds in action.
And Don Carlos, actually, the reggae artist, kind of helped with that project a little
bit and did some some pheno hunting.
Then we grew we continued doing R&D there and we did Don Carlos because we named the
strain after him.
We did those and feminized and we didn't do quite 5000, but we did we did a thousand or
two.
And then we did the Slightly Stupid, the band.
We did a project with them there where we grew out there two strains we made for them.
But, you know, long story short is that this stuff is, you know, there's not a lot of data
on how how these things will perform.
And we just, you know, we take it really seriously.
So we just like to get out there and get as much trial and hopefully not too much error
out of the way before we are endorsing these things at like significant scale for.
Yeah, it's it's pheno season, right?
Are you you got any you looking at any killer strains right now or what's what's coming
down the pipeline?
Oh, yeah. You know it.
Give us a sneak peek.
What I know you got some killer flavors up there.
Folks are not aware we did that project in 2018 that that Dark Heart was a big partner
in in that effort and bringing it to fruition.
You know, I also got to I'm missing it this year.
I'm like, dude, COVID is killing the is killing the phenohunt season.
Well, you know, and I can't get through it without mentioning, of course, Hendrix Nursery.
Those guys are also a big help.
And, you know, really any of the nurseries that we do work with.
But, you know, Dan and.
A lot with the whole thing, one thing we ended up doing was putting out a film, I call it
a film because it's it's like 45 minutes of content and all all this this phenohunt thing.
And the goal that we that we did that year with 10,000 plants that we actually hunted
through. And when I say hunt, that means.
The kind of the big effort of it is taking the cuttings to to make sure that you have
the plants, if one is what we've kind of been lent my business partner, Ben kind of
coined the phrase the unicorns.
And so I like that.
So we were hunting for a unicorn.
And if you're interested in in seeing the nitty gritty of that effort, it's it's on our
website. And I imagine you can probably get to it through your guys's website, Dan.
But we'll see if it's not on there.
Well, I think it's one of two.
It's one of two pieces of content on our YouTube channel.
But you can you can't miss it.
You can go to either of our YouTube channels or our website and and see it.
But what's on this year's menu?
You got you got you got anything cool or what's you know.
Definitely. What are you excited about?
So that you know, the 10,000 was just ridiculous.
I mean, you remember how insanely exhausted we were by the time we did the fun part, you
know, like we we had we invited I don't know.
Well, at the end of it, it was kind of the party had swelled to around, I think, 80 people
that we had up at the farm.
And we did not have 10,000 plants at our farm.
We had a huge amount of plants that year at our farm to look through.
But but what we did was the Fino hunt was the tour.
We went to all the different farms where we did, you know, have all those cuttings.
And it was great because we kind of timed it to do the the event was right when everything
was sort of at its peak of beauty and turpins.
And so people from all different walks of the of the industry, dispensary owners, we
had distribution, we had blah, blah, blah.
Oh, we're losing Dale.
We love you, Dale.
Thank you.
OK, cheers.
I'll sign it off anyway.
So and yes, I have a good night.
I'm good seeing you.
Thanks.
Good to see you again.
Yeah, Dale, I'm going to have to save the because someone remember that question I
forwarded to you about the Apache Foundation.
So I have to save that for next time.
But it's basically like the copy left versus copyright models and the Apache Foundation
model and things like that.
So we can talk about that later.
Yeah. All right.
Cheers, everybody.
Good night.
Night, Dale.
Night.
Long story short, we we have this rating system.
We call it the Fee Type Mega Hunt rating table.
And what it does is it puts all the different components that make up great weed strain
into kind of like this numeric form.
So then all of these participants that we didn't we actually couldn't look at all
10,000 plants that weekend, but we were able to look at 4000 of them.
So we went from farm to farm and and everybody that participated was able to kind of
briskly walk through these fields with all 100 percent individual plants.
So nothing from clone.
Everything was just 100 percent unique out there.
And with these rating sheets and like iPads, we had a couple of that.
But, you know, so people are just filling out forms and smoking lots of weed and walking
through fields. And we did, of course, we found some strains that have since become,
you know, 100 percent just killer strains.
And they're still out there in the world today, like, you know, Magic Melon and Vanilla
Frosting and yada, yada, yada.
So long story short, though, this year we I learned from from my mistake and 10,000
sounded like a pretty cool number to shoot for.
But I I kind of realized that, you know, 5000 or 2500 was was more of a.
How about 25,000?
Dude, soon enough.
That's coming when, you know, the real problem we would be doing that like right now,
I'd be gearing up for that next spring if I didn't know how I would pay ever pay the
taxes that are in.
That's what I really think.
I wish that there was some more support from the state to, you know, doing some of this
cutting edge.
And I'm not trying to be bragging or anything.
Well, they don't they don't make it easy.
You know, one of the things and, you know, I used to work on this a lot and I tried to
you learn a lot of ugly lessons when you get your hands dirty and in the lawmaking side
of this industry.
But, you know, there weren't a lot of voices at the table when the regulations were made
around cannabis for nursery and breeders.
Right. Yeah.
One of the things that I really regret to this day that we we push really hard on and
we lost was this.
There's this bit about, you know, like nursery producers, which technically are seed
producers and a lot of breeding and stuff like that.
That's kind of the license you have to have usually do a lot of that.
You can't, you know, one of the and this killed me.
They specifically made it so that like when you make a seed crop, you can't sell any part
of that seed crop other than the seeds.
Which is just brutal, I think, you know, it's like you can't make you can't make extract
from the from the, you know, from the material.
You can't you can't take any of the flowers out of that or anything.
You're really you know, it really makes it hard to be, especially if you're doing
especially if you're doing generational research work and you're not just throwing out
first generation seeds, it makes it really hard to have a viable economical model for
on the breeding side. Yeah, so that's that is annoying and we've kind of well, that's
a whole nother topic, but we should talk about that because we kind of figured something
out, Dan, but the.
And when we talk about it here is that.
It's 250 of our closest friends watching.
It's not really I don't know, I could maybe I should be putting my foot in my mouth, but
there is there is a way that you can use that byproduct.
And but but as we all know, who's who's done enough breeding that.
It to have really fully mature seeds, your your flower is is well past its prime, and
so I always kind of compare it to like, you know, if you're breeding roses, if anybody
knows what a rose seed looks like, it's it's inside this rose hip and there's not a
single petal left on one left.
Yeah. Yeah.
And so it's like I have tobacco here and there are these basically the flowers and then
behind them are these balls that are forming.
Right, right.
And so, you know, you have to it's different stages of the the game is, you know, you
kind of need to go out and make your choice as to what your most beautiful rose is and
and write that down and keep track of it, because you certainly could never, you know,
go and and do a pheno hunt on on rose hips and know what the what the rose itself look
like. So anyway, we this year we're doing twenty five hundred plants and we've got some
absolutely amazing new cultivars.
Last year we did around twenty five hundred also.
And there's some content on that pheno hunt.
I think it's also on our website, but certainly on our YouTube channel and some of the
things that we we found from that one, we have this this wonderful, amazing brand new
strain that we're about to release.
I think this is actually the first time that I've ever even said the name in public.
So here it is, folks.
We've got it.
Yeah, we're calling it.
He did not just.
Mike dropped.
We'll wait for this is the cliffhanger.
Nat, can you hear me?
You and your charger.
Because I was going to I had a bunch of people had questions for Nat.
Ryan Houghton asks, has anyone seen the original Ercol cut around?
Sorry, Ryan. Ryan also asks Dark Heart, tell us about your sour D cut, mass skunk cross
with the original sour D.
Oh, man, I don't know that I could go that deep off off the off the top of my head.
But yeah, no, I mean, that's our D cuts been with us for years and years.
I think it's you know, it's something it's funny.
It's some of those old school strain sour diesel, blue dream and stuff like that.
People will have really strong opinions about.
And, you know, is it is it this cut is that cut?
And, you know, at the end of the day, especially for the ones that we've had forever.
I say, look, it's it may or may not be the, you know, the blue dream that, you know, in love
or the sour diesel that, you know, in love or from some other source.
Oh, now I'm losing myself.
We I can hear you.
All right, let's hear you.
You guys still there? I think I went dead.
No, no, we can hear you.
Oh, you've got me. I don't have you.
OK, good. I'll just keep wrapping that.
But yeah, no, what I tell him is is look, I don't you know, I couldn't tell you if it's what if it's the sour
diesel, you know, from somewhere else.
But people come to know it as dark as the dark heart version.
Right. I mean, it's you know, when when you buy sour diesel from us, it's the same sour diesel you've been
buying for years when you buy blue dream.
It's the same sour diesel we've been offering for 10 years or more.
And usually that means it's the one that's that's made its ground.
So it's not the same thing.
But it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
it's the one that's that's made its rounds around the industry, you know, although not always in such a good
form. So we're pretty proud of that.
We've become kind of a staple, especially for the trains that we have that are the really long running, the
real long running kind of workhorses of the industry, as I think of them.
Well, I'm supposed to do something with Mojave Rich.
I'm going to have a look if you ask me another question.
Once I figure this out.
Can you hear me?
I'm back. Look at that.
All right. It works again.
So I was going to say I'm going to do something with Mojave Richmond in the next week or two on the origins of sour diesel.
I will I will be attending that.
All right. Well, there are a bunch of questions for.
Someone said, if you hate sour, you haven't smoked sour.
Someone said, if you hate sour, you haven't smoked sour.
Oh, you know what? I see one popping on here that I think I should address.
I fear doing it in Nat's absence, but I do think there's a question.
About the asphalt plant, Venom OG asphalt plant and and all gas OG.
And it's a good question because there's a bit there was some now I'll have to address some of it, but they are all I hope I'm not mistaking.
I'm pretty confident this is true.
They are all the same plant.
We still sell it as Venom OG.
I know that it's, you know, Nat's calling it.
I know now all gas.
So, gee, I think to avoid some of the confusion with another Venom OG that's on the market.
But and I don't remember there was a there's a story about for a hot minute.
We were calling it the what was the other one?
Asphalt plant, I think, was like an interim name, maybe.
But I believe they're all three of the same same string.
Can you talk about kind of the the Dark Heart model like.
It's a global market with a bunch of local markets, right?
So what's your strategy outside of California?
Well, you know, it's interesting, I mean, we don't we don't we our nursery doesn't really reach outside of California, at least not by our doing.
But, you know, I mean, so our focus is still on California, there's still so much we have to do in California and we're still bullish on California generally.
You know, I hope that one day in a legalized market that I think this is right.
I think California will become the biggest exporting state to both throughout the country and throughout the world.
So, you know, I think our first and primary focus is on helping growers succeed here in California.
And I think that when we do that, that'll help them be the winning the winning farmers, you know, in the whole global cannabis agricultural ecosystem.
You know, that's what we want.
So there are then kind of the medium term thought process would be that there is intrastate commerce and stuff that's grown in California, like a Merlot, like if you think of wines coming from specific regions,
will have value versus setting up like the Dark Heart franchise in Oklahoma, the Dark Heart for franchisee in Massachusetts and Illinois.
And, yeah, you know, we look at those things sometimes, but we've been we've we haven't jumped off on any of those ventures yet.
You know, it's easy to get distracted by the shiny object and we want to kind of make sure not to do that.
And we know how, you know, a nursery is a really operationally intensive business.
Right. So it's not something that we would just lightly slap our name on and be off to the races.
We know how much work goes into doing a great job as a nursery.
And, you know, market has to have a certain size and and be, you know, a certain level of development for it to even kind of make sense to run a nursery.
Right. So we've been we've been cautious about it so far.
And frankly, like, you know, every spring we still run out of plants for growers.
So, you know, our focus is still on, you know, making sure we can we can address the market that we've got here in California.
You know, I will say one thing we're proud of in our first service that we can offer, you know, we'd like to help growers everywhere.
And the first way we can do that, which we're pretty proud of, is our plant sciences team.
So we are offering some, you know, some of your audience might have seen, hopefully some people on the call, have seen our work in plant pathology, especially identifying and curing a disease called Hoplite and thyroid.
You know, we so we've got full diagnostics.
By the way, did you watch where I brought Jeremy on with the banana Fusarium expert?
Oh, man.
You want to hang with this guy and just ask him intelligent questions that I can't ask him as a non plant scientist.
I heard the report back.
Yeah, it's a it's an interesting story and one that, you know, as someone who was who was an early anti GMO activist back in my 20s, something I struggle with.
Right. It's an interesting story that plant Fusarium one.
There's a yeah, we're going to run out of we're not going to have Cavendish bananas anymore.
Right. So anyway, it's a.
It's a cool story, but yeah, no.
So so we're so with that team, one of the things we're able to do, of course, here in California, we've been able to not only identify Hoplite and thyroid and also eliminate it out of the plant.
So we do that for ourselves internally.
We offer it as a service throughout the industry to other growers, people that run their own mother blocks, other nurseries.
It's just kind of, you know, we make a little bit of money doing that.
But I think especially we feel strongly that this is a major problem for the industry and we want to and we want to make sure that we can help solve it for the industry.
And so, you know, we can take that work to throughout the country.
Right. We can take in the samples and help people diagnose the Hoplite and thyroid and help give them some consultant services to understand how to eliminate it in their own their own commercial grows.
And I have to say, people are just becoming aware of this.
It's it is amazing.
I think we're still at I'd have to check with Jeremy, but I think we're still at the point where, like every single site we've tested has at least some amount of Hoplite and thyroid presence.
And for anyone who doesn't know that we're talking about is the pathogen that causes dutting.
I'm sure anyone that's grown plants in the last five or 10 years knows what that's all about.
So huge, huge, devastating impact on these grows.
It's cool. We're able to start not only solving it here in California, but elsewhere in the country.
So just quickly, before we lose Nat, Nat, literally just as you were about to say the name, you cut out.
So can I can I I emailed it to you, Peter, and maybe you could share the screen, but I just want to say something about.
Hoplite and diploid virus and dark heart and.
This is I thought that this was so ironic that, you know, Dan and Jeremy and that team did this amazing work in essentially diagnosing.
This this dutting problem that was like omnipresent all over.
I mean, in particular, I think, you know, probably had some likely, you know, likely relationship to where a lot of hops have been historically grown in Sonoma and like Southern Mendocino.
Of course, you know, like Hoplite.
I'm not trying to like put any blame or call anything out.
But but the irony of it was that these guys discovered that the fact that the plant that cannabis could get Hoplite and diploid virus and and also worked on developing a way to clean it up out of, you know, precious genetics that that folks might have through tissue culture.
And but one thing that I've just noticed is that there's been a lot of excuse me, a lot of people have like somehow come to this conclusion that that dark heart was like the the reason or the place that that Hoplite and came from because they were, you know, kind and forward thinking enough to figure out how to solve it.
And so that's sometimes just the cannabis industry is kind of like that, you know, like don't don't blame the messenger is sort of what the lesson I think that folks need to learn, because really, you know, these guys were sort of leading.
And so, you know, it's just it's funny how sometimes it works out like that. But I just wanted to clear the air that Dark Heart did not like spread the Hoplite.
But anyway, did you get the my my new strain name? I did. So you ready for it? Ready to announce? Yeah, go ahead. Can you share your screen?
Jelly Rancher, it's I don't know, I might get in trouble. But, um, we might change the logo a little bit. But it's such a wonderful, beautiful, beautiful name. And I'm just so excited to be able to share it with you.
We might change the logo a little bit, but it's such a wonderful, new genetic, we actually found it two years ago. And it was really hard to, you know, to wait to release it until we had really good stable seeds. But one thing that I find special about it is that it, it, it tests pretty high. So it tests in the upper 20s.
And, but it's it is kind of a sweet, more like fruity kind of dessert strain. And it's just absolutely gorgeous as far as trichome density. And there's just a lot of really redeeming qualities about it.
And also, I personally I find that some of the, you know, more sweet strains don't carry sort of like the paranoia molecule, whatever that is. And, and so it's for me, it's something that I've just started, you know, like, really smoking a lot of it in the in daytime. And just whenever, you know, in social situations,
it works really well for me. And, and I never end up, you know, bouncing off the walls. Yeah, getting to, you know, I don't go hide out and clean up my bedroom, because I just got too ripped on it. So it's still, it's still way strong. And it's an early harvest too. So if you're have to deal with, you know,
unknown conditions in the month of October, and you want to grow it full term, it's great for that, because it comes out of the ground and in like the end of September, but it still tests really high. So that's kind of an unusual combination. And it was really hearty and a sturdy one too.
So that's just one of them. I know Ben's working on some amazing, exciting stuff. Normally, we kind of have a cyclical release timeframe where we come out with a big catalog once a year. And that's often comes out like right at the Emerald Cup. Of course, this year, both we don't have an Emerald Cup.
Well, we do have an Emerald Cup. But we've, but the Emerald Cup, the timing has changed. And, and it's only going to be the, the competition part of it. So we won't have the, the great big social event, which of course, you know, we'll all miss that a lot. Because that's, for a lot of us, just, you know, one of the times where we can be sure that we're going to be able to all hang out together.
But, you know, we still just so folks know there still is the competition, but they've moved it now to, I think, January. So I think that a good portion of it is happening in January, then maybe the awards are in February. I don't really remember exactly. But I know you can go to their website and check that out and find out more stuff.
The one thing that's kind of big news is they actually added a, an indoor for the first time. So that's going to have an indoor portion of it. So if you've always wanted to be part of the Emerald Cup, but you're an indoor grower, now this is your chance.
Is the indoor category literally just under the broad category of indoor, not like indoor hydro, indoor living in soil? It's just indoor?
I think that they're kind of just sort of like easing into that, you know, because I think a lot of folks have really kind of appreciated the fact that the Emerald Cup has, you know, given such sort of credit to the, to the outdoor flower.
And just the fact that, you know, of course, outdoor flower, I would, I would say is certainly a little bit more healthy for the planet and things like that. So I think, you know, Tim Blake, the founder has always been sort of proud of that. So I know it probably took a lot for him to move over.
Yeah, I'm sure it did.
But, you know,
I don't really have an opinion on it. I think that,
that, you know, it's, it's a great competition. And I know this, like the, the Emerald Cup is certainly without a doubt,
a really unbiased type of, of competition. If that's like,
it's not like a high times cup, a pay to play, a pay to win.
Yeah, well, yeah.
That's right.
You can say no comment.
Before I forget, and fuck I feel like I just forgot the question I've been waiting to ask.
Between all, so, so Dan, Nat and Doc,
as breeders, if you think about your genetics, like I'm a musician,
like, as you add new genetics, every season or whenever you add new genetics to your lineup, like,
what percentage of what you sell out on the market is kind of like an old go to, like, like, I don't want to say a one hit wonder, but like,
like what, like, like, do you have like a Rolling Stone, like Rolling Stones, Sympathy for the Devil,
which they wrote in the 60s, you know, which is like, makes the bulk of your money, but then you come out with new stuff like Rolling Stones new albums are kind of like,
it's nice that they're putting out new albums. No one's like, oh my God, that, that song from their like 2015 album is in their pantheon of, of hits.
So kind of like between all of you, what are your expectations for like your old classics versus new, new cults of ours coming on the scene?
Well, I think that's a really good question. And I know this.
Every year we try to sort of retire a few genetics because we will otherwise would end up with this just absolutely ridiculous seed catalog and I kind of just feel like that's can be kind of counterproductive because,
you know, everything you, we put out, we really want to give it our all and we want to give it a lot of attention.
And the tendency is to, if you're tired of something a little bit to maybe not like, you know, give it your full gusto.
And so we will and do regularly retire genetics and we certainly will be doing that this year.
But, you know, the hard part about it is that without a doubt, you know, folks are going to be not happy about that and they're gonna, you know, immediately say what happened to blah, blah, blah, strain.
And, you know, I mean, if I had it my way, I would just, you know, totally just like give any of those older, I would just like literally just have a seed swap here in Humble and just tell people, well, come on down and we'd love to just give you a bunch of those.
So that you'll have them until they don't germinate anymore or whatever, because, you know, like what, what we're putting, I kind of feel like we're only really, we only need to be compensated for what we're actively working hard to give to the world.
I never really felt like, you know, I'm, I'm actually happy just being a seed company that makes seeds and that's the service. Like we're not, you know, trying to set ourselves up so that we can just sit back and, you know, float around on a yacht in the Caribbean and the money just rolls in.
I actually enjoy making seeds and I really enjoy, you know, having people have a good time growing them. And so I don't ever see that changing. I hope that the laws and regulations around cannabis relax and particularly about the seeds and particularly about, you know, people growing for themselves.
And, you know, I think Dan and I'm sure Doc, like we can all really probably agree that like we do what we do because we love doing it and we enjoy this plant so much. We want to share it.
And yes, we do certain things because they make money and they keep the, the ship afloat. But, you know, at the end of the day, we want to, you know, get people excited about going and growing cannabis and getting outside and enjoying nature.
And I always say cannabis is like a garden gateway drug. Sometimes like the young people around me that, you know, the 21 year old that have never had any interest at all in growing anything or being gardeners or farmers or whatever. They, of course, take great interest in growing cannabis.
Next thing you know, they're growing their own cherry tomatoes. And it's like,
it's not just the 20 somethings, Nat. It's like, I've got neighbors who'd be like, oh man, I, I grew a, you know, I picked up a couple of clones this year and, you know, I got them. They're really big. And I, you know, now, well, it's getting towards the end of the season.
So I put a tent in my basement. I swear to God, by the second year, they've got a full blown grow and their, their wife's divorced then. It's a whole thing, right? It's like,
Right, exactly. And they're, and you never know, they might try the salad too. They might grow their own.
They might do some salad. Or sometimes maybe they get rid of the salad greens so they got more room for a couple of plants.
Yeah, without a doubt. But
So just quickly, Rob said, did you retire strawberry cheesecake? Why is it clone only at Dark Heart? And then Nick said, Nat, your genetics are bomb. You gave me 18, 13 foot plants, blueberry muffin, Bigfoot glue, Cookie Monster and train wreck. Thank you so much.
Well, thank you for the support. We that's amazing to hear that. I love it.
Strawberry cheesecake. Did you not or is that that one gone?
Well, no, you guys, I think you still have the occasionally you'll do some like special releases with the cuts of it. And we actually do have plans to come out with it as a seed line. So it was a, it was a clone only that Dark Heart had pretty much exclusively for quite some time. And it, it did have a kind of a certain
cult following. And now I believe that Ben is working it up as a seed variety. So yes, good question. And that's on its way.
Nice. Another another like a like a Dark Heart pre release.
The real the real deals coming down the pipe.
Is that for me or Nat doc?
Well, for both of you, I guess is my question. I mean, because I do I do cold storage. And I mean, I'm working on stuff and pulling things out literally right now that I'm getting ready to play with it would from the 70s. You know, I'm not going to be able to do it.
I'm curious if you're talking about killing genetics off to make room for things. Are you storing stuff for long term or just like you're just killing stuff off?
Yeah, I'd love to answer that question for us. And I think Nat probably has a different answer for them too. One, one thing we're really, you know, we've had a lot of people come to us and say, well, I'm not going to do this.
I'm not going to do this. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing.
And over here, I remember probably six years into the company or so we looked at it. We're like, guys, we can't have we just like we don't have the resources to do this. And we're like, well, we're not going to do this.
But no one wants to get rid of any of them. Right. So it's always been a challenge for us thinking about what we let go of. And I think that's a really good thing.
And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing.
And over here, I remember six years into the company or so we looked at it. We're like, guys, we can't have we just like we don't have that much space. We can't have like 50 varieties.
But no one wants to get rid of any of them. Right. So it's always been a challenge for us thinking about what what we let go of. One thing that's really cool. We started a tissue culture lab back in kind of like 2014 or so.
And, you know, we've played with a lot of tissue culture. People talk about it like it's just one thing. Right. But it's actually like many, many different things, has many, many different applications, many different ways to use it.
And we've played with most of them. We've used it for production. We use it. One of the things that's still very, very important to us about tissue culture is the disease eradication, what we call the clean plant program.
That I think is probably the most important thing. But the other thing that's that's now is a really critical asset for us is using tissue culture for the genetic storage. Right.
I guess that was part of my question. Are you using that?
We do. Yeah, we do. Right. So it's cool now is like, you know, because it's still important for us to have like a, you know, we just we can do a much better job as a nursery when we have a more limited menu. Right.
But what's cool with the tissue culture lab is we can have sort of a limited menu, maybe only have 25 varietals or something kind of in production at a time.
But we can have, you know, I think we've probably got something like 200 varietals at the lab. Right.
So we can rotate those 20, 25 varietals and not be afraid that we're going to lose them forever and kind of offer a fresher menu more frequently, even though it might not.
Hey, that strawberry cheesecake might not be available this season. But if you wait till your next crop cycle, we might have some for you. It'll be back in the lineup. Right.
I'm even thinking from a medical application of things that you could go back and stuff that was in your library that you didn't have. And now all of a sudden you realize, hey, we have that in there and it has a medical medical application because it has that compound.
And you could come back and revitalize that again and make access to it. You know, yeah, that's that's how I'm looking at it. I hate to see something just to be to go by the wayside, especially when we have such really, really fine genetics in our area here.
I hate to go to the wayside. Yeah.
And we'll even offer that. It's not a huge thing for us, but we do have a couple of customers who we do that like as a service for. Right. So, you know, be like, hey, we'll store your genetics for a certain monthly fee or whatever.
And when you if you need it, if some for some people, it's just like a backup. Right. Like, well, my guard never dies or whatever. I've got, you know, I know I've got these stored somewhere.
And, you know, sometimes it's more of like a production thing. Look, I need to make some moms like twice a year. So, you know, I'll call you up and you'll make them from my specific genetics out of the tissue culture lab.
In the specific current environment, like someone like you, Doc, a fire rages through. I mean, how does someone kind of preserve and save their genetics?
Well, me personally, I keep seed stock of everything, you know, in a concrete basement. I mean, really, that's the bottom line is, you know, cold storage. I keep fresh seed stock of everything. I try to breed this stuff that I'm working with.
I try to not let anything set for more than five or six years. You know, if I accept that, I really love. Yeah.
But I mean, like all the redundancy is on site. Like, you know, you may not be able to get down there quick enough of a fire rips through.
Oh, of course. Of course.
Do you have a friend who stores stuff too, like as backup or?
Well, I keep I mean, yeah, I mean, for me personally, I have stuff that I have in my home. You know, I keep my I have backups and everything in a refrigerator.
You have cold storage, a basement where I have stuff in my basement. That's where my lab is, where I personally work at, you know, and stuff that goes outside.
If that was to go up, I mean, yes, it's a tremendous loss, but I have backups of everything, you know.
Granted, if it burnt my home to the ground, then it's a different you know, it's a different story. What can I get out the door with?
Believe me, brother, if it burns my house down, this kind of got way bigger problems for where I'm geographically located at.
I mean, honest to God, you know, I'm on the north end of the bay. It's wet up here. It's like it would have to go through Eureka.
It would have to go through frickin Arcata to get to me to burn up and around me.
So and I not that I'm thinking those kind of thoughts, but if it did happen, I would try and pack all my seed stock out with me in my old pickup truck when I went rolling down the road.
So another nice thing about seeds, they're kind of nature's time capsule, right?
You can roll with them quick and heck, I wouldn't be surprised if you had them in a refrigerator. They might survive that fire, even if it did happen.
Brother, that's what my thoughts are, you know, I mean, you know, for just being doing it old man style the way I do it, you know, it's, you know, just keep them in the fridge.
Got the silica packs with them. And if the whole house burns down the fridge, usually they're still standing.
And then I, you know, again, you know, I'm not to make light of it, but, you know, I have fire proof safes in my home, that kind of stuff, you know, rated stuff for where I keep a lot of that kind of stuff too, you know, formulas and recipes and things from over the years.
Yeah, but I really, my thing really was Dan was with the tissue culture thing is, is that yours? And I guess what you're saying is, I thought was true is the viability to store stuff long term, if you needed to come back into your Rolodex, so to speak, and pick something out for working with you can do that, right?
Yeah, that's right. That's right. We can. Yeah. Yeah, we don't, we're playing with cryo preservation, but it's not like a main thing for us yet. I don't think we've quite like lined it all the way up. But yeah, in our normal library, just through like regular tissue culture cycling, we'll maintain them in population.
Yeah, we've actually played to with, you know, there's some other cool stuff at the lab, like embryo rescue for seeds, right? Some of those old seeds that are hard to that are hard to germinate or long germinate. Sometimes we can recover those two. So that's kind of a cool thing as well.
I'm doing a little of that right now on some of that 70 stuff.
Playing with a little doing some hard with stuff that old. It can be.
Yeah, most of it, quite honestly, when it got there, it didn't survive a pressure test, you know, and the little bit that did survive, I've got a little bit of, you know, little magic dust to play with that I'm going to soak it in and see if I can't get them to pop, you know, and take it from there.
You know, I think really a lot of what I realized, too, is, you know, the the steps that you go to and that I personally practice in my own lab in my own space, you know, is that the things that we do to make sure that we can keep things going, you know, that I don't.
I don't know. I don't see a lot of people really practicing the craft hardly anymore other than, you know, what happened with Humboldt seeds and what you guys are doing and then a little bit of mom and pops like what happens here in the triangle.
Yeah, I wish there was more of that happening. I'm afraid we're going to lose that art if we don't, you know, if we don't teach it out, we don't pass it out. I'm afraid we're going to lose that art form that craft, you know, in what.
Hey, Doc. One thing that this brings up is I had not quite taken it to the to the end zone, but there's there's some money that some grant money that is available right now throughout California to, you know, help, of course, help some of the small
smaller family and and help some of the, you know, minority stuff and just different kind of sort of philanthropy type grants that one might be interested in writing.
And I had I had some interns that were helping us out and we got started on it. We never quite made it to turning it in. But these are like revolving grant cycles. And and if anybody out there is listening, I think a really cool thing to do in in California right now would be to.
And I don't care where it happens. I mean, I'd love to see it in Humboldt, of course. And and I've even got a place in mind. There's an old bank that is a dispensary bought it and there's a vault inside of the bank.
But and they're not using it. Well, it's available for this project. But the project is is I thought of having a nonprofit, maybe like Dale's Ethics Data Ethical Data Alliance, but a cannabis nonprofit that could cry.
People could go and deposit seed stock and we could cryo freeze it. And, you know, supposedly when you cryo free seeds, if they haven't been frozen before, they can last for, you know, an undetermined amount of time and still come out and germinate.
And Dan, maybe, you know more about whether that's actually the case or not. But I think it would be really, really cool to have a nonprofit that would just simply catalog and, you know, kind of like that thing in Norway where we've got all the different species of seeds.
I think cannabis and maybe I'm just a kook, but I think cannabis deserves something like that of its own. And it would be really great to have that and just have this wonderful library of all sorts of different genetics.
And, you know, maybe people could check them in and occasionally people could even check them out as long as there was enough and and maybe it could sort of fund itself a little bit. But but the idea wouldn't be for, you know, capitals, you know, raising capital or money and gains or anything like that. You just really would be keeping those really, you know, genetics.
The heritage ones, the heritage part of it alive. Yeah, really. I think it's that point, you know, we're getting to that point now where like what you guys are controlling and especially what I'm seeing where you have such a you have such a control over it now on the stuff that you have it.
If you put it back where people can come back to it at a different time period where it might have relevance again, you know, I mean, like, I don't know what I do. You know, I go back to like old school blueberry white rhinos, you know, the cornerstones of everything that I work with over the years, you know, and it's just tried and true stuff, you know, it's like that's just how I build or have built and continue to build stuff.
I sourced stuff from Morocco from the Katama Mountain range specifically for its hash production stuff that I worked with two years ago, trying to get things that you know off the African continent and I'm wondering if you guys are like, are you going and pulling in land race stuff? Are you getting old building block strains and trying to build stuff from the ground up again?
You know, and I mean, no disrespect or anything in that format. I just everything that I see as of late seems to be a knockoff of a Girl Scout cookie, you know, that is crossed with a Girl Scout with something else and it doesn't really go beyond that anymore. Like, and I'm, you know, again, I have it. Nobody else has it. You know, I'm working with a Malawi gold that was gifted to me female that I was able to come back in and cross with a Casey brains mango original male poly.
And here last year and it's a phenomenal it's going to be a beautiful strain when I get it out and let it I've got some buddies veteran buddies of mine that are test running it right now on their little grows, you know, so that's kind of where it's.
Anyway, I'm wondering if you know if you guys are doing that kind of stuff or even considering working on things of building stuff up from the ground up again.
You know, you kind of hit the nail on the head there doc and I think that what now is talking about kind of addresses some of this to you know, I read an article a while ago. I probably couldn't find it if I looked again, but someone did a study and they determined that cannabis had like the most diverse gene pool of like any commercially cultivated crop on Earth. Right.
And, you know, kind of processing that a little bit. What I think it's about is every other commercial crop has been intensively bred for commercially for, you know, typically decades, if not, you know, like 100 years or something, sometimes hundreds or thousands of years even right informally.
And what that sounded it's really narrowed down the germ plasm into very specific commercial traits and what you'll often see breeders doing in those crops is, you know, in order to overcome the challenges that they're confronting whether it's pests or diseases and stuff like that is they actually now because it's become so narrow have to go out and really hunt to find these
to find these wild race, these wild genes and stuff like that that might start to bring some of these qualities back into the plant. Right. So one of the things we should think about, and I think that's that's what you're bringing up here is as we start to breed more and you know, we know there will be some major winners and people start to focus on those.
You know, we have an opportunity now we have this big germ plasm right and and it could be bigger and we need to make sure that we keep it big.
But how do we make sure we don't lose that as we start to as we start to select for more specifically commercial genetics and that's what that's about is like not said, making sure we have
To the extent we're able to create some banks and germplasm banks where we have these even varietals that we maybe think are not interesting right now. Right. How can we make sure to preserve those
And to your point, Doc, bring cast a wide net when we're doing that and make sure that we're really bringing in true representations of land restraints from across the world and and just have a really, really broad
Repository of genes of, you know, genetics for for the industry, you know, in many, many years into the future because
Those crops, they're working backwards to create that we have an opportunity to hold on to that now and we should, you know, it'd be a shame for us to not do that.
Yeah, if anyone out there listening feels like they're really interested in, they have the skill set for grant writing.
I'm willing to, you know, help try to form a team to get that done. And I think we could help you know with some startup money to and
You know, I think it would be important that it would be something that is kind of owned by the people and and really truly a
Nonprofit and I think that you could maybe develop some kind of rules of engagement and it would give and take, but I
I would love to see it happen. We started it. So we do have a partly written proposal and there is a revolving grant fund that that would likely I think fund it. So it's not
Just a total, you know, crazy idea. So if anybody's interested. That's something that they want to do it, you know, could potentially
But it would really have to be
Someone who just wanted to see this happen for the preservation of exactly what Dan was talking about. Just, you know, the preservation of diversity.
Of the genetics.
We're seeing it every day, guys. You know what I'm saying. It's like they didn't know it yesterday and tomorrow they're going to discover something else. All of a sudden, you look back and you're like, Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
I think it's going to be a big thing.
We're seeing it every day guys. You know what I'm saying. It's like they didn't know it yesterday and tomorrow they're going to discover something else.
With the medical research that's finally coming out. Now is the test for coming out to these these medical professionals have been using we're seeing it every day, guys. You know what I'm saying. It's like
I don't want us to lose those things.
That's what I'm afraid is gonna happen
is we're gonna lose a lot of the heritage part of this craft
and at least the people that I, you know,
I mean, the old craft people is like,
we've used building blocks, we use land races,
we go back and take tried and trues
and we start from scratch and work
and back breed and inbreed and keep going and going.
You know, like the one I've worked on right
for the last eight years.
I know that you do it, Dan.
And I know Nate does it,
just what he was saying,
head damage, I get stuck.
Going out and spending the time
to how many man hours it takes to go
and find a particular one you're looking for
out of that group and focus on that
and find those traits again.
And just the steps that we take to get it to that point,
you know, and can it be repeated over and over again?
Most people don't get that.
It's like, I find it humorous, you know,
these young growers and they crossed two together
in this F1 and they think they built something.
It's just the start, you know,
it's just the start of a long process.
And I don't want us to lose the things
that I know that are still out there.
You know, I don't want them to be gone 20 years from now.
You know, when you guys are getting to be old men
and I'm dusting a jar somewhere,
I don't want it to be that it's gone, you know.
I want it to continue on.
That's what I'm afraid we're gonna lose
in the next two decades if we don't do something about it.
Yeah, anyway, my two cents.
Well, I really appreciate that you feel that way
because I think that that's absolutely important,
right there with you.
And, you know, it's funny because that,
the whole land race,
it's a romantic kind of a word.
And right now I think there's a little bit of a buzzword.
And when it comes down to it though, really,
you know, I think that we have to just,
in some respects,
one of the things that I actually kind of blame
a little bit on why we're moving towards,
more towards monoculture in cannabis varietals
is the way that the state put together
the requirements for test results to be on the packaging.
And I think that the reason they did that was,
it had something to do with public safety
and wanting people to know how much THC
was in the cannabis they were consuming
so that they could make choices
about what they were gonna go and do
and operating machinery, all that kind of stuff.
And, but really the ironic thing about it is,
all of us know, and there's been some studies
that have came out recently,
that oftentimes it's not like the real driving factor
behind the effect of cannabis is not so simple
that you can boil it down and put it on
that labeling requirement that says,
blah, blah, blah amount of THC.
And so in my mind, I'm kind of like,
boy, the state is in a way kind of almost like,
presenting something that is in a way
almost kind of dangerous in that,
if it's a low THC percentage,
you might think that you're fine to go
and do a certain activity.
And, but then there may be this entourage of turpins
and different things that,
we all know as experienced cannabis consumers
like have a oftentimes a much stronger effect
than the just simply the THC.
And there's even new cannabinoids that they're discovering.
Like you just mentioned earlier, Doc,
that it turns out that they actually are,
I think one of them they said was 30 times more
psychoactively powerful compared to THC.
And it's like this unknown, previously unknown
people on a chronic, like we didn't know,
and, but I'm not saying I'm not blaming the state
and I'm not saying that the state's liable for,
but I do think it's kind of a bold
and somewhat damaging way of describing cannabis.
I mean, if I was the state, I would wanna have,
at least like confidence intervals that,
take away their like liability for saying,
this is about to get you this stoned.
It's like, well, really?
I mean, because do you know that or, I don't know.
So I would like to see the,
I mean, it would be great for me because,
unfortunately we all live in this world where we have to,
there's no escaping the reality of the fact
like there's commerce exists and commerce drives
business and drives,
it's a huge driver for really doing this.
And we would do it to some extent,
even if there was no money involved.
We probably couldn't do it to the extent that we do it
if we weren't getting any money from it.
And so we have to take all of that into account.
You can't just say, well,
we have to take all of that into account.
You can't ignore the fact that for us,
if we go and all we release are like really low THC strain,
that we're not gonna do a lot of business
with big commercial licensed cannabis farms.
And so we have to address that, but do we love,
do we like that?
No, that's like probably sort of my least favorite part
of it is going after a specific molecule.
I wanna follow my nose and follow my heart
and breed cannabis because it gets me,
it has this effect that I would like,
I figured other people are gonna like it too.
And that's what-
And we did it that way 10 years ago too, brother.
I'm using these CBD, THC and all these words
that weren't in my vocabulary just three years ago.
Even for me, it just,
Peter and I had this conversation the last time
we were talking, how do you, what do you go on?
I get went strictly on that.
What my friends tell me when they are smoking it,
what my own personal reactions were.
That's what everything has been for me up until just
the last few years.
It's like, I'm becoming more buzzword savvy,
hanging around you guys and being around
the medical professionals that have the correct phraseology
to add it to my repertoire of words now.
Just when I'm describing cannabis,
that's really that all it really is.
But for me personally, the breeding part of it is just,
it's what you said, it's the love of the plant.
It's the getting your nose in it,
the seeing it develop that I,
going back and trying to take as what I do,
I don't know how you do it,
go back and take it, cutting off of that plant
to try and save her so I can come back
and breed her again with male pollen out
of that same stock of seed stock.
That's my approach.
Right, okay, so that's how I find this now
is what would you do, what I do, what Dan does.
And the few of us that do do this
from a point of the love of the plant, brother,
that's how I'm looking at this now.
It's like, what I'm here, I don't even know, man,
I'm not even supposed to be here anymore.
I'm only here to teach this plant.
It's the only reason why I even know now, quite honestly,
is to share what I've been doing for this long,
almost five decades now, amazing, beyond words to me,
to think that it's that, that I started in the 70s,
1972, my first cultivator here, my first plant,
my first joint 50 years ago, how crazy is that?
It's just, that's how far it's gone.
Now I look at it now where, when we get to that point
when you're passing the heritage on to the next generation,
and I look at it, because brother, you've been doing it
for, rookie at it, you've been doing it
for a couple of decades now, man.
That's just how the matter of the fact is.
You're better at the craft than I am, quite honestly,
because you've been able to morph it
into a business for yourself.
I'm still in my backyard tinkering with stuff
in an unknown variable until a couple of years ago,
nobody even really knew who the hell the group of us were.
They know who we are, but we're in the background
in the old, the old Jesus I'm referred to now
by you younger guys, men and women.
It's like, there's a group of us that are out there though
that are still doing it, they're not on Instagram,
they're not on social media, they don't,
they don't even really, I laugh,
they say, come, come, and you get it
because you're here, man.
But I explain to people that aren't there,
our technology is 1989 flip phones.
They go to Walmart and get a card for their flip phone,
but they're the ones that are out like I have done,
learning it from the grassroots up,
learning it before there were books.
There wasn't a catalog or a guide
to tell you how to sex plants.
We learned it all the hard way.
Why am I good at what I do, man?
I've made more mistakes than most people
and lost things, things that I've lost that I wish,
and why I guess when you said you let things go, brother,
he's like, things that I wish I could bring back now
that I know that are gone.
Yeah.
Well, Doc, I know I'm getting a little tired,
but man, I would absolutely love to have you come up
and visit the farm and who knows,
maybe Dan wants to get out of Dodge for a minute,
but you're open invite.
We'll get Doc and Jordan together.
Yeah, all right.
Well, why don't we wrap it on that?
All the South Africans and Europeans are just waking up,
so they're like, what's up everybody?
I have my cup of coffee, good morning.
Guten tag.
I told him an hour, man,
and it's always like it's three hours later.
Yeah, maybe turn this into a telethon, Peter.
You're gonna have to start taking,
get an operator and start taking
Nick and Colin's fire relief, right?
We're gonna take some pledges.
Yeah, no, go ahead.
Well, I wanna hear,
it's been all us kind of old geezers up here talking.
I wanna hear what you think.
Is it Mia?
Mia, yes.
By the way, Mia, were you born in 1989?
Were you alive yet?
No.
Wow.
You're making us feel old.
Mia, thank you for-
What were you saying?
I just, I said, thank you for just hanging out
and being so patient with us.
And I'm really curious, how do you think?
What do you feel?
I feel like personally,
I come from a culture where cannabis is really not a thing.
And I was born and raised in Hong Kong.
And then when I came to the US, we had saved my life.
And I think that because we as humans have biodiversity,
preserving biodiversity in the medicine we have access to,
like you were talking about,
is a critical part of treatment.
Because after I had my own personal experience,
I'm like, fuck, there's so many people out there
probably like me.
And they can't all just have the white bread of cannabis
forever for everyone.
So yeah, I've just been,
I feel like I've just been soaking up the knowledge.
I'm like, oh, this is all relevant.
I feel like I'm gonna bring up all of these things
at parties when we can have parties again.
Hell yeah, hell yeah.
Well, you're also an open invite to come and hang out.
Thank you.
And-
Oh, and sister, if you're gonna go all the way to him,
I'm just a little bit farther up the road than he is.
So come all the way up.
I've always dreamed of visiting North Carolina.
We'll make the road trip from LA.
Man, that's a hike.
That's a hike, yeah, that's a hike.
Amazing spot as well too.
And Dark Heart is growing all the time as well,
both literally and figuratively.
So they have like a gorgeous spot.
And I'm sure Dan would love to,
let's just make sure that we all exchange
contact information after this.
You know, Nat, you mentioned earlier,
we did an event together.
It was that last year maybe called Spring Trials.
Yeah.
I've been doing that event for years
because one day I wanna throw a version of that
for the nursery and the cannabis industry.
We haven't been able to do that.
And for years we couldn't do it
because you didn't ever had people over to your place.
And then we were in Oakland and we didn't have the room.
We finally got our greenhouse.
We finally got the space for it.
Now it's COVID, so we can't do it.
But as soon as we get out of that,
we wanna have that event.
And now what that's about is like getting,
you know, getting your partners together,
your breeding partners, your commercial growing partners,
your retail customers, and getting them all together.
You know, usually at the beginning of the crop season
and saying like, this is the new gear, right?
Seeing it live, right?
These are the new strains.
These are them growing right there.
This is what they're gonna look like.
This is what the weed's gonna taste like.
This is what it's gonna smell like.
This is what's gonna be on the shelves and dispensaries,
you know, six or nine months from now, right?
So anyway, we're gonna throw that party one of these days.
We'll see when the world will let us do it.
That sounds amazing.
I'm gonna hold you to that
because that sounds like a lot.
Right on, well, you better be there.
And with that, we will call it a night.
We'll kill the live stream.
Thank you everyone.
And thank you guys for,
I don't think anyone expected to go till midnight,
but we did.
Yeah, thank you, Peter.
And thanks everyone for watching too.
