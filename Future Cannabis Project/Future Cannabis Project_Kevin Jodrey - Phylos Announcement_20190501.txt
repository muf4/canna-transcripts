[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Some news dropped about Phylos Bioscience and for a number of years now they've been collecting,
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  they've been creating the galaxy of genetics.
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.000]  Maybe you can talk a little bit about sort of how they came out and what they've been doing
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  and what the news is this week.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  Alright, let's see. This is pretty interesting.
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  So Phylos originally, Mowgli, gets tied into I want to say one of the museums of natural history
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  and they want to do mapping of cannabis genome.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  They want to start to be able to see this picture in a more clear fashion.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  Rob Clark from Cannabis Botany, a very famous cannabis,
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  I want to say he's a scientist because he works in scientific levels, but culturalist too.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  So Rob Clark comes to me and says,
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  Hey, we're about to create this galaxy to start laying out the outliers of cannabis
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  so we can start to see relationships between varietals and we can start to get a better look at what's going on.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  And I was like, cool, and we'll be able to use the data down the road to help us understand breeding
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  and help us understand resistance and help us understand the plants at a better level.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  So I agreed and I contributed material to the galaxy that was directly from Afghanistan that someone brought me.
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  So I knew I had material that no one else had in circulation so that it could start to lay out, I say, the fringes of the galaxy.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  And what I knew was that cannabis was protected by the illegalities.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  And so when I got to speak to people decades ago, the reason why there was no competition for us
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  was because the federal illegality made it unfeasible for any major company to get involved
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  because it was too risky, just like it is now.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  Until it's federally legal, a large company could lose asset forfeiture of their investment in material and their infrastructure.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  So that's why none of these major players are here yet.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  That's why they're buying into Canadian companies because Canada has a system that's a little more stable.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  They don't have the same risk.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  So the American giants are buying Canadian companies, Apria, Atomabaro.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  They buy into Kronos. They put like 1.8 billion into a Canadian company.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  That gives them now an ability to operate and wait.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  You just saw another Canadian company, Canopy.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  I just think they just hit up Acreage where they're going to tie in, you know, I think 3.5 billion.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  They're going to buy them as soon as it goes federally legal.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  So that gets tied in.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  The point of that is that there was no other companies coming in to do this type of work.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  So to me, there was this opportunity to take a look at the plant material.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  And I went and met Philos's crew and met Mowgli and Ralph, the COO, and met all the scientists.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And it was pretty straightforward.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  They're trying to assemble data.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  And down the road, that data would get used in breeding.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  And it's clear what genomics companies do.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  And I didn't have any fear of them, and I still don't.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Because I know they're not taking your material and then replicating it through code.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  They're not taking it into a gene gun and spraying it onto a cucumber so they can then create your Sally's perp.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  It's information that lets them see into this thing.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  And I think that what needed to happen, and I think that they're going to do this soon,
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  is to release the disclaimer that you'll receive that says, none of your material is ours.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's just that I don't think that they saw the blowback coming.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  I don't think they realized people were going to panic so much.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  And I think the panic is really more based off of the minimalization of the cultivator today.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  Where for 95% of us, we're all being compressed.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  So we don't feel like we're valid because we're not a multi-billion dollar company.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  And we don't have security.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  And we're trying to figure out how to get product into stores.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  We're trying to figure out how to even get the license.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Most people don't even have real licenses right now.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  So I think I lose my license for my farm at the end of this month.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  But I know I'm going through the annual because I'm talking to CDFA.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  And we're just getting a few little dates straightened out for contractual stuff.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  But the bottom line is, none of us have any kind of real legal security.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  And we have very little market penetration.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  And most people that do are getting buried financially where they're actually losing money.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  And so they're terrified.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  And so when someone says, we're taking your material and we're going to utilize this info,
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  I think that people believe that they're going to steal the tools that you use.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  But they don't have that ability.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  That ability will be taken from you by bigger companies who will do utility patents
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  that will just cover broad swaths of material.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  And even though utility patents can be challenged in court,
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  you happen to have a lawyer that you can go and have them challenge it for you.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  And I think that that's very important to understand because you have to get some form of movement.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  And so Phylos creates a company that looks at the genome.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  They then create a service that you can utilize as a cultivator.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  So as a cultivator, I can hire them to start to look at my breeding lines.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  And from the information they've gathered from looking at 4,000 or 5,000 different varietals,
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  it gives them the ability to understand what they're trying to look at when they're looking at your work.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  So then you can create lines that you can patent, that you can license.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  And people are screaming about this, but if you're in corn or wheat or any other commoditized crop,
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  which cannabis is now, that's how it works.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  And if you don't understand that, then you'll eventually be in a situation where nothing on your farm is yours to use without paying someone else.
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  And I just think that that's the world we're in.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  The world we were in was really nice.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  We all got to basically do what we chose.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  But we're not in that world anymore.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's been completely changed.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  And it really was going to happen no matter what, no matter what special bill was written for the little people.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  It doesn't work like that in America.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  America doesn't write bills for little people.
[05:53.000 --> 06:01.000]  It writes bills for major companies that consolidate and work, and cultivators are very victimized by that.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  And so I think that when Philo says, we're going to be doing this, everyone feels minimized.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  They're going to take your plant material.
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.000]  They're going to steal it.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  But they're going to steal it now.
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  They're going to use the information to give them information.
[06:12.000 --> 06:15.000]  But basically, you have to work with them for these projects.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  So when they announce they're putting together a massive facility,
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.000]  a lot of that is to do breeding work with breeding partners that they're in relationships and partnerships with.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  And I don't see the problem with that.
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's just business.
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  Okay, so I mean, a lot of the concern when they first came out with seeking samples of plant material to sequence,
[06:35.000 --> 06:43.000]  I think it was back in 2014, at the time, cultivators were wary and have always been wary of biotech.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  And that idea that they could steal their heirloom varietals.
[06:50.000 --> 06:58.000]  And so Philo's at the time seemed adamant that they would never be entering into the breeding space.
[06:58.000 --> 07:08.000]  And so I think that's part of the concern is they have now sequenced thousands of varietals over 80 countries.
[07:09.000 --> 07:17.000]  And breeders and growers have paid to have these sequenced.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  And now the announcement is that they intend to partner with plant breeders and tissue culture nurseries.
[07:24.000 --> 07:32.000]  And they're claiming to have a more in-depth genotyping method that they plan to use in these ventures.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  And that's called a SNP.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  SNP? Can you talk about what that is?
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  It's just a more accurate view.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  The thing is that there's many ways of looking at the genome.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  And I'm not a geneticist.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  So you mind, I'm a cultivator who looks at this from a very simple perspective.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  So I don't claim to be a geneticist by any means.
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.000]  But it's utilizing scientific tools to take a look at the chromosome and find out where on the plant is the markers.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  Where are the indicators and the triggers that make things occur?
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  And by taking a look at tremendous numbers of plants, it allows it to happen.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  When you send your DNA into anybody, it's data.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Why do you think that they want the data? So they can look at the data.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  But your heirloom varieties aren't being stolen because they can't replicate it from the code.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  But it lets them take a look and understand what to see and what makes things what it is.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  So it gives them a huge database tool to utilize for projects.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  But it's not stealing your shit.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  I'm someone who's involved in breeding projects with them where I pay them.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  And I have them look at my material so that I can then get information back.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  So that I can then understand what I'm looking at.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I don't have any fear of it.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  And I knew from the beginning that at some point all this material would have to go into breeding.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  Because that's what genomics companies do.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  It's kind of like 23andMe. Everybody's angry that they took the data and used it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  Well, what did you think they were going to do with the data?
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  And for me, the galaxy did two things primarily.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  It got stuff into public domain.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  Which is what I wanted all these varieties that I had collected over the years to be.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  So that this way it at least allows there to be a stamp in time that says this variety was being used prior to you saying you created it.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  And so finalists can't take it either.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  Because they didn't create it. They just mapped it.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  And I wanted to make sure that cultivators who had some of these killer varieties that we've been playing with for years
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  had at least some ability to keep cultivating them.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  And finalists was a great marketing tool to show customers' product.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  It let them see relationships with things.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  It allowed us to take a look at varietals and see relationships.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  Until you have a million samples, you're going to have missing data points.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  And so you're going to see interrelationships that don't make sense.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  And you're going to see incomplete pictures until the technology comes forward.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  And I think that as you go forward, you'll see more and more tech.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  But the bottom line is you either utilize technology or you don't.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  And if you think anyone that's in business is there to do charity, well then they're not a philanthropic group.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  They're in business to do business.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  And I think people had to understand that from the beginning that when you work with companies, they have an agenda.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  But when I spent time with the scientists, I never felt in any way threatened by them.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  They wanted to do what they want to do, which is map and then assist breeders in projects.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  I don't see what that's such a traumatizing event.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  And to be honest, 90% of the people that are screaming about, you're taking my genetics,
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  where did you get the damn things from?
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Who did you get it from? Somebody gave it to you.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  I created it really from thin air.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  And so you're really reusing someone's stuff anyways.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  And so what material isn't available at ready source?
[10:54.000 --> 11:02.000]  There's nothing really that has the true value that a patented line would hold for us in the future.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  And I think that when I speak to grow groups, I tell them all the same thing.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  You all have to get together, combine your resources, create a common line, something that works for you regionally.
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  It allows you to have something that all of you can cultivate for differentiation that can't be touched by other people.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  And it's not about I have a magic clone.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  It's about I have a reproducible line that has some form of unique characteristics.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I don't think people realize how many patents are out there right now by these major groups.
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  It's unreal.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And so people are like, they're going to steal my material.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  You already lost half the stuff you have because you don't realize it falls under a utility patent.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  And so everybody's worried about somebody mapping something.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Well, it's already been taken.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  But nobody's really looking at that.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  And for me, I've been looking at that for a long time where I realized they're going to come and take everything.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Because that's how it works in ag.
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  And we're in ag.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  We're not in illegal drug dealing anymore.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  We're in ag.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  And in ag, big companies do this.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  And to me, Phylos was a group of scientists that when I spent time with them,
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  and I watched them in their personal lives, and I watched them how they behave, to me they're reputable.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  And they've never not been reputable.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  I've never had an issue with them.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  And I'm not part of Phylos as a company.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  So me pushing their product and me pushing using the Galaxy for the way I used it,
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  it benefited most every single person who used it because it allowed them to understand what was connected to what.
[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000]  It gave them some good ideas about the amount of hereditary traits that would move forward through homozygosity, heterozygosity,
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  how much was fixed and how much was variable.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  And it allowed people to use the Galaxy as a killer marketing tool because public loves the damn thing.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  And so you use the tools in front of you at the time.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  And for me, the people that I deal with at the company, I think they're scientists, but I think they're reputable scientists.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  I've never had an issue with them, and I don't have an issue with them now.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  Did I think they were going to breed down the road? Yeah, because that's what genetics companies do.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  And did I think they were going to steal anybody's data? No.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  But did having the data give them an idea of what to look at? Sure.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  And that's part of the trade.
[13:12.000 --> 13:25.000]  So can you explain more how you see them using the data that they have and how it will perhaps change the game going forward?
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Well, it's not just them. It's all the medicinal genomics, too.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  That's Kevin McKiernan. That's a competitor company.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And McKiernan's a genetic genius, too.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  And I think they've done the Jamaican lion or some strain they've really gone into.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  But if you take a look at enough material, it lets you start to get a bigger picture.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  A bigger picture helps you understand a smaller picture.
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.000]  So if they have an idea of what things look like and unique traits and qualities,
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  when they look at your stuff, they can say, hey, we've seen this before. These are the markers.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Because you have to remember, there's no book to follow.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  It's kind of like micropropagation.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  Micropropagation is very easy with a laboratory and a scientist if there's a recipe.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Most plants have recipes, the formulations to do the propagation.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  With cannabis, there is no book to follow.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  So that's where everybody struggles is trying to create the proprietary formulas to replicate the plant.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  And once that happens, it's simple.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  But right now, none of this is in play.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  And so for me, this is a race.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  And the race is I need to find a company that can take information they have
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  and then let me take the work that I'm doing on my hill and have it studied
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  so that I can actually try to create something that's unique, differentiate enough
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  so that I have an ability to hold it.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  So it's just a tool, a bigger picture tool they can use to refine a smaller picture.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  All right. Well, thank you.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  That helps to understand more about what's happening with that big announcement
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  because it did seem like on the surface a reversal from what they've been saying in the past.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  Well, I think that when they said they're not a breeding company,
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  they're saying that we ourselves are not going to create the plants and then sell them.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  And they're not.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  They're working with you. They're working with people like me.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  In the process of this, they can get plants,
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  and then I can release these plants to them to put through nurseries and move into the world.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  But Phyllos is not creating their own plants.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  They're helping you breed. They're a breeding tool.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  It's like the calculator doesn't do the math.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  You have to do the math. The calculator just makes it easy.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  And that's how I see science. It's tools.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  And I wish it was different in the sense that we could all just do what we did like we did prior
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  because it would be lovely.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  But we're not there anymore.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  We're so far past that that people have a hard time understanding
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  that the scope of the competition that's coming in to take over cannabis production globally
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  is so big and so funded and so intelligent that you are absolutely about to get stuck into a meat grinder.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  And if you look at like Steve Hill, Reggie Godino from Steve Hill has been saying this for years.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  So Steve Hill does genetic analysis.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  And I respect Reggie in terms of he definitely knows what he's doing.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  He was a Monsanto breeder.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  And so that's where most scientists go to work is at big companies.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  You don't go to school and spend a couple hundred thousand dollars on an education to get a Ph.D.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  so you can go work at the corner store.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  You go to where the money is.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  So he was basically, you're saying, trained at Monsanto.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  He wasn't trained. He was a Ph.D. who worked at Monsanto.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  He didn't get trained at Monsanto, but he went to work for Monsanto.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Because what does Monsanto do? They breed plants.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  And then he moved to working for Steve Hill for a number of years.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  Doing a similar program to what Philos is doing.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  So he can clearly tell you what they can take and what they can't take, what they can use and what they can't use.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  So he's been probably one of the more vocal proponents of you can use the services, we can't steal your material.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  It's just that he didn't get the, and like I said, I respect Reggie because he's a brilliant guy,
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  but he didn't get into the public the way the galaxy did because the galaxy caught you visually.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  So the galaxy created this incredible push.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  And it was a wonderful tool because it allowed the public to get caught up in it too,
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  which has been crucial because you need marketing tools.
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  I think also that Reggie, I recall, was talking about patents being a reality.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  Years ago.
[17:26.000 --> 17:34.000]  Being a future reality, whereas Philos was more focused on this is how we're going to protect you from having your material patented.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  So I felt like there were much different perspectives coming out of each company.
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  And when I talked to Philos, never once did I, because I'm not paid by him.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  So what was my benefit of using it?
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  My benefit was I needed the tools.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  I needed the tools to help me look into the genome better than I could.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  I had this guy from NASA say, well, it's not as accurate as it could be.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  And I said, well, then what company should I use?
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  And he goes, well, there is none.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  We have to do it privately.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  And I said, well, that's lovely.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  That means nobody can use the technology.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  So therefore it's worthless to the grower.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  So anything you can't use is worthless.
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.000]  Things that you can use at least have some, they have a value because you use it at the time.
[18:16.000 --> 18:24.000]  And I never saw Philos as a malignant group because their desire was to do this so they could get the information.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  So down the road they could be involved in breeding projects by helping growers breed.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  That seemed pretty clear to me the whole time.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  So I'm listening to this and I'm like, never once did I ever think that they weren't going to use the material.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  I just knew they couldn't use your material and take your code and reproduce your plant from a dead piece of plant material.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  And I know they make special equipment in life that can do all these incredible things,
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  but the odds of a small biotech company doing it are pretty small.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  You know, that's Syngenta level.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  I don't think they're a $40 billion company.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  So, and when they come in, when Syngenta comes in, which they will,
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  you have a problem because they're going to sweep through this thing with a broom.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  And we're all going to be growing the same kind of products.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  And they may not be GMO, they might not have other organisms melded into them,
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  but they'll definitely be patentable and enforceable.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And if they come to the store and they test your product and they find out it's the same product, you have a problem.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  And who is this company you're talking about?
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  Just Syngenta and Monsanto and Dow Corning, any of these massive major BASFs,
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  all these major companies that are tied into global ag.
[19:34.000 --> 19:41.000]  So we're, in the future, you're seeing a future where we're going to have much less variety in cultivars.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  Oh, completely. I've been saying this for years.
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  And as soon as everybody got compressed, because you can only hold six plants at your house,
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  so how much of a project can you run if you don't have a license?
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  None.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  And if you have a license, what can you do?
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  You have to make sure you make money because a license is a savage.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  So, you know, it's a real one.
