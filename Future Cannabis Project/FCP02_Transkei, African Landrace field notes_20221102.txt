Hey, field notes again, we already started covering the transci. We showed you another
feed note. Now we're at the other side of the garden. So this is from our African sativas.
Today is October 23rd. I want to show you up close here. This plant is actually, in
my opinion, it's very close to being ready for harvest. So if you want to come in close
on some of these buds, see what the final bud structure looks like. So probably can
go for a few more days, but it's just very, very crystally, but they're tiny, tiny, tiny,
teensy little, almost like pixie dust trichomes. So when you look at it at first, you're like,
where's the crystal? And then you look closer and you're like, oh, it's totally crystal
coated, but they're just tiny little trichomes. So, and the smell, oh my God. Oh, it's like,
it's piney. Also like a fresh parsnip, a little bit of parsley and dill. So very savory herbs,
but then also there's kind of a thicker, creamier, almost like chocolate, almost like
chocolate mint. But with, that's amazing. But also with like parsley and fresh parsnip,
like an astringent thing going. So very interesting. So this is the furthest thing from fruity,
modern cannabis flavor. This is very savory herb, piney, astringent with a little chocolatey
yumminess in there. So really amazing. Very excited about this one. We're going to be
harvesting this this week. Again, this is Transkea.
