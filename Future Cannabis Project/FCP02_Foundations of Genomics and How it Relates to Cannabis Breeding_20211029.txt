and future cannabis project fcp o2 back in your lives oh thanks guys for being
here with us we're happy to be back with you everybody's joining us tonight
tonight if you're catching it live Elka's already thumbed up this Trevor
people love you dude this is gonna be fun I already lost my spot so thanks for
joining us we're off to a romping start this evening yeah as you kind of guessed
it the title gives away a little bit about what we're talking about tonight
it is the kind of the foundations of genomics how it relates to cannabis plant
breeding and we have you know the perfect guest to kind of be on here and
do that with us we got Trevor sun-grown mids putting in the hours today to join
us today so thank you very much man I appreciate that yeah no I really I
appreciate the invite Chad yeah my pleasure it's you know a lot of people
here have probably heard you you've been all over the future cannabis project and
more recently you've even been on a lot of the clubhouse conversations about
breeding here on the fcp o2 channel and I absolutely love those sessions and I
believe it was last week you know you it was great you're basically saying
before all of this you could still do this with a pencil a paper and a
calculator and that really you know it made me think because again we're we
love new fancy toys and techniques and granted a lot of this stuff isn't new it
may be new coming into the cannabis application but a lot of these are
established methods and I wanted to bring you on to kind of talk a little
bit more about it a lot of us know you know it's funny I was thinking the other
day a lot of us know enough to almost kind of be dangerous it's like well
genomics what is that well you know it's the study of the genome and that sounds
pretty freaking smart for somebody who doesn't know much more than that but it
goes a lot deeper than that and you have a great way of explaining things in
my opinion that at least make me understand it and I kind of almost think
if I can understand it everybody else can too so I wanted to bring you on and
really kind of focus on some of the the building blocks or some of the basics so
you know a person like myself can really understand how these terms are applied
how they're used how it relates to cannabis take take some of the you know
the voodoo out of the the breeding and whatnot so sorry that that honestly I
feel is something that for too long it's been kind of this mysterious black box
of like how do you do it like everybody gets to Mendel and it's really simple
and it's like okay that makes sense but then after that it's like it doesn't
translate and people have a hard time bridging from the really introductory
stuff that we've maybe learned in like Robert Clark's marijuana botany book to
then being like well how does this translate to the general like you know
here we are like you'd mentioned genomics and it's almost like we've been
plopped down in a world of incredibly advanced technologies with a plant that
hasn't been developed the same way that all of the other plants were developed
and then like genetic genomics got applied to them you know hundreds of
years after there was systematic breeding or you know about a hundred
years after really systematic breeding had already been undertaken and so you
know we've got a really unique plant and a community that actually is
thirsting for this information which is really cool there's like posting
information about genetics and really getting into the nitty-gritty that's
where I find I get the most feedback the most engagement with people on
different platforms and so I just I think that that's it's great to see
just that the community's actively engaging in a scientific dialogue and
like a process of learning and applying the science absolutely you know it's
almost like you know the new toys it's a lot of us we want to play we want to
kind of push it further a lot of cannabis growers were always that kid
who just kind of wanted to go to the next level with everything but you know
there there are some hazards to doing this if you don't have kind of the
background or the foundation just genetically speaking lock up narrowing
gene pools these types of things it helps to have the larger picture again
it's just more tools to guide you but the scientific approach I love it I like
I like that level of stuff you know the consummate student everybody is that's
you know I was in music before this you'll never know everything there is to
know about music plants no different so I enjoy that before before we get
started to you know another kind of cool thing you do is I follow you on
Instagram just wanted to real quickly touch your breeding the culture series
that you've been writing that is very awesome everybody you know you can
definitely follow his Instagram and check that out there but please can you
can you tell us a little bit about how that came about or how you go about it's
it's almost like it's awesome time capsule of historic breeders yeah um it
really came about from just wanting to wanting to explain a lot of these
concepts and like get into the ideas of different like breeding theories but
doing it in a way that was more accessible and understandable so looking
at actual breeders in the cannabis field who have worked with the cannabis plant
the different underlying like methods or ideas that they had behind their work
and you know I feel like it's one of those things where learning this
information gives us the tools to understand what we're already doing
because so many people are already breeding and are already applying this
stuff in a way that like sometimes our ideas have been off placed and I mean
you guys had a great conversation on here the other night about the different
taxonomy of independence ativa and like a lot of the different issues that come
up with like an underground sort of counterculture interweaving with
scientific concepts and trying to like use those concepts to figure things out
and like sometimes we figure it out correctly sometimes we must apply things
but like sometimes it's not our fault like really if you look at it and like
1970s countercultures really like diving in you got Mel Frank and Robert
Clark and David Watson and these different individuals and they go to the
scientists and they look at the scientific papers and they're like well
Robert Schulte says there's this three breakdown of indica sativa ruderalis and
like they apply that taxonomy and then that taxonomy gets applied into the
counterculture and gets like reappropriated in these different ways
and relay contextualized and then 30 years later it's like oh shit it turns
out like Robert Schulte's was wrong and it was really just awesome human being
who was trying to get his like his students and like people who are getting
busted for cannabis off by saying cannabis indica cannabis ruderalis
aren't cannabis sativa so legal technicality get out of jail free card
based off of this like scientist expert witness and I think that ended up
losing eventually through the court system but like that was the motivation
honestly and so it's like yeah I just I feel like that's one of those things
where it's really cool for us to be able to have these scientific like knowledge
base and apply it and if the science is wonky or weird then like our
applications may be wonky or weird but that doesn't mean that the endeavor and
the effort itself is like not worth it yeah that doesn't invalidate everything
yeah you're trying to do there and the you know that is it's I think that was
one of the points that we all kind of came to is just contextually you know
how is it being used and yeah sometimes there's just you know what it's the best
thing we have at the moment so until we can replace it which is the important
factor of science you know to come up with a lot of the terminology and
terminology in that in that context is so important because there's so many
facets to it that you have to be very specific you know I enjoy research
papers as well a lot of the language is dry I make sure I have Google dictionary
next to me but yeah there's an absolute reason for a lot of the terminology and
that's what we're trying to get down to and tonight too that's what we'll be
digging into a bit is the terminology behind this stuff yeah and it may get a
little dry I definitely while I was writing it as like wow this is this is
dry material but it really does get into the historical development of
essentially all of the ideas that are at the foundation of plant breeding both
in terms of like conceptual principles and then also methodological application
of those and hopefully we can weave enough cannabis in there to make it a
candidate yeah well you know I think we have you know the right crowd too
because a lot of people will see how it's applied even though it's you know
an agricultural study we'll see how it's applied to cannabis or we'll be
able to relate that to connect the dots so yeah I think I think we we have the
right crowd and if not I'm interested actually I know we've I've already
gotten good feedback from from doing this like really yeah buddy so we're
excited to have you on but you know again I keep delaying the getting into
it I just kind of wanted to ask you know a little bit more about yourself just
you know because I always hear you spit knowledge I never hear hear much about
sun-grown mids what was kind of your background like how did you get into
this road because you've definitely dedicated you know a large portion of
your brain to to this information were you growing like peas in the pea patch
as a kid or what how did this kind of start um I grew up and my mom was like
she went to a hippie boarding school and like she basically like ran away as a
kid and then like convinced her parents to send her to a hippie boarding school
which exposed her to a lot of countercultural influences kids at the
school their parents rented the cabin that Hunter Thompson lived in and so
like they basically spent time up in Aspen and Woody Creek or Willow Creek or
whatever it is like in that realm and so she's like they were all deadheads and
like very engaged in sort of like the post 60s you know they were like they
were children of the 60s so they were like in the 80s or whatever 70s and 80s
and like into the hippie counterculture and Colorado was a really like hot spot
for that and so my mom was involved in that always been around cannabis pretty
much my whole life my stepdad was involved in like used to import cash
from Spain into Europe because he was like a British expat and like so my
whole life have been in like involved in it and it just by the time I was like
12 I was trimming and by like 16 I was growing and a lot of that was like I
like yeah we just it was a way of making ends meet and like surviving and that
was like kind of like making it through my entire childhood like in one way or
another cannabis basically like put food on the table or a roof over the
head and by the time I was a teenager I like it was just it is what it was like
there was yeah and so I was also homeschooled at that point because I
got in tons of fucking trouble like lots lots of trouble as a kid
problem with authority or yeah like school I just yeah I didn't work well
with the whole school system and it wasn't like in because I would get in
trouble then it would create like interfaces with authority for my mom and
like it's just not a good scene I got like placed with my grandparents for a
little while and like it was one of those things where I had to be
homeschooled to keep from like causing like too much shit to come down and so I
got homeschooled for all of high school and I grew weed like as school credit
like gardening for high school that's pretty amazing man nobody nobody has
figured out how to work that into their curriculum yet but so so it was it was a
regular crop before you knew it as kind of how you know it today I don't imagine
then yeah like then it was just like you know chores well it wasn't really
chores it was more like there was the it was a form of employment more like
because I was trimming and like having like seasonal work as a result of it
like doing laborers like a kid like finding jobs at like places just you
know to be around it and to like I pretty much immersed myself because I
was homeschooled and I lived on a dirt road and like there was a hippie commune
down the road everybody on the road basically grew weed and there was like
not really much reason to go to town or to interact with outside society I also
Calaveras County is a very conservative Republican area and there was like these
two hippie enclaves on either side of the county and I've lived right next
door for like large parts of my life and so it was like and we knew everybody and
like we were all friends and stuff and so there's that aspect and then like I
kind of have an obsessive like if I get interested in something I want to know
everything I can about whatever subject it is and I was always more interested
in genetics and breeding and knew that that was like the thing that made the
difference between like that person's are first the other person's are like
yeah there was pretty technical growing skills but like it was a lot of times
they're like the people who had the better or the people who were really
interested in the genetic side that's interesting so so did you actually get
to see breeding projects in practice when you were younger to kind of see
they're like oh a and B I could get to see with a little bit of work yes and
no I mean like back in the day early when it was like gorilla patches there
would be like a dedicated gorilla patch of just like open pollination of like a
lot of different shit and then those seeds would be used for the next year
but then all the other gorilla patches would be left for like your sensing
production so to speak and like that was a breeding method and it was one that
was just super haphazard and resulted in like you know it's just open pollination
random and you'd see the populations move all over the place and that's
really what like that's what led me eventually to be like there's got to be
a better way but then I also when I read like Robert Clark and like they straight
up told me early on like clone production wasn't really how we got
down we didn't keep clones we were off the grid nobody had power like the way
that people reproduce their shit was through seeds and male-female
reproduction and the vans were very frowned upon it was very like hippie
organic and so you know I basically like I've read Robert Clark's book and
thought okay I have to find some landrace genetics to be able to have a
p1 to then be able to start a breeding program as opposed to recognizing like
that's one way of doing it it's a very effective way when you take germplasm
from very diverse places bring them together and start making hybrids you
can get some really interesting and unique things but that's not
technically what a p1 is like p1 just means parental generation number one
like it's a way of denoting a generation within a population that you're
breeding so like you take your p1 generation where you cross two plants
you create a hybrid generation that's your f1 generation and then you have
every subsequent felial generation after that and like the corn breeders of a
hundred years ago they weren't starting with pure landrace genetics they were
starting with this huge mixed population and started inbreeding that mixed
population down to pure lines and then hybridizing those and finding oh shit
f1 hybrids this is how we do this and like demonstrated the science so I feel
like you know I my early experience with breeding almost discouraged me from like
making the dive because I was like oh I don't have the right germplasm to start
this process and the right germplasm is any germplasm with traits that you like
that you want to mix together or traits that you want to improve that's it like
you you got something and you want to improve it then start making breeding
experiments designed to try and improve it you got some things that you like and
you want to keep it breed to keep it like it's just it's one of those things
where it's like you don't have to have some magical beans that are hard to find
you can really just start with the tools you got and a lot of people you
know started with bag seed particularly in areas where it's not okay like it is
where we are but you know you kind of said just like the open pollination and
that was more of a way of just preservation that's how I kind of got
started making seeds again I I did not know about breeding breeding was not
something that I set out to do because again it wasn't even a thought in my
mind the only thing in my mind was I'm not gonna have access to more clones or
seeds in the future I was able to get some males why don't I start making some
seeds and then that you know it's it's again it's a jump-off point for a lot of
people but you do have to start somewhere so I'm glad that you explained
that part yeah yeah so yeah let me we could get into this here I really
appreciate you kind of you know sharing some of the backstory it sounds
interesting because again it's a it's a plant it's not a fast-moving crop so
there's only so many chances and opportunities you get to play with it and
experiment within a lifetime so you know being able to start early I think
was probably a benefit to you you know and again that that kind of helps you
know I'm here in the back of my mind you know the the breeding the culture series
you go you have a depth a wealth of information you know it didn't start
with legalization so that's that's pretty awesome and that's a that's a
step up so do you appreciate that yeah yeah and so and you've just been a you
know kind of a self-motivated almost kind of self-taught person it sounds
like when it comes to this did you did you ever seek out any formal training
I've done some like I've done plant breeding seminars at UC Davis that was
like in 2015 and like I mean I went to college and just did college for a long
time because I was like I was interested in just studying stuff and it was kind
of like I can grow her and go to college and fuck around like it wasn't really
like I have no degrees I don't have any like credentials that I can point to but
I spent eight years in college so I have a lot of credits and a lot of good
experiences to again you know a lot of a lot of that experience for me wasn't
necessarily what I learned but it taught me how to go about learning if I wanted
to learn something in particular the resources where to look the methods
structure I guess for lack of a better word yeah yeah same thing where a
research skills were learned in like academic space like being able to just
spend time doing that and doing it just for personal enrichment without like
feeling like the grade attached to it necessarily mattered like really let me
just dive into subject matters that I like and to really focus on things and
ironically like I avoided math and a lot of the sciences at the time and did much
more like history philosophy and like the the social sciences and looking back
on it I I regret that choice only in so far as like I've had to like you say
kind of like self-taught go back and be like so yeah yeah so that's I that's
definitely something that I think is a valuable valuable tool just to like
pursue and do on like the low key if you're not interested in getting a
degree right right well you don't even need a degree these days just kind of
check out your Instagram and start clicking through some of the links you
have and folders you have up there I know I've got one of the textbooks
pulled up on my laptop right now actually I am that person I just ordered
a soil science book from 1992 the other day on eBay because it was like four
dollars and change I'm like well it'll be funny to see what they say yeah yeah
now yep oh boy there goes the phone let's see here meet myself nope okay
wife picked it up awesome good catch wife sorry about that so yeah we let's
go ahead and we can get into kind of the presentation here that you've put
together and then I you know I'll have some questions I'll probably throw some
questions at you towards the end too but yeah thank you thank you for kind of
sharing a little bit I could turn the I could turn this talk into a whole just
two hours by itself and that's cool that's cool I think you're you're down
in California I thought for some reason I thought you're up in Washington but
down in sunny California yeah all right so should I should we do the share
screen or should how should we do it yeah yeah go ahead and if you hit share
screen there we're gonna figure this one out on the fly because everybody in
chat knows this is future cannabis project and we do it on the fly that we
do all our tech on the fly so and then go ahead and then you can full screen
your presentation there and then I'll be able to add it in here so let's see
here I can go to add to stream and we have this view and we have that view oh
I yeah I can't see it with it up on my screen but it's good to go oh yeah okay
you probably couldn't so we're good to go everything looks good there sweet so
intro to plant breeding history oh please read it it's not this is what we
came for
discoveries of the principles and methods of plant breeding and genetics
so we're here's like a quick intro of some of the first ideas we're gonna go
into there's Mendel and his experiments that discovered the laws of segregation
and independent assortment and we'll go into discussion on the difference
between qualitative traits which is what Mendel really researched and quantitative
traits and this is really the bridging of the gap where people have it's like
Mendel's informative or a tiny subset of traits that aren't really applicable to
what we generally do quantitative traits is really where the like meat and
potatoes of plant breeding and genetics lies and then we'll talk about Wilhelm
Johansson's experiments with beans that demonstrated the pure line theory he
coined the terms genotype phenotype and demonstrated the gene environment
interaction that produces phenotypes we'll talk about Nilsson L and EM East
Edward M East and oh all plant breeders seem to go by like initial initial last
name is like seems to be a convention in the plant breeding world because it
seems like about 90% of people will have that naming convention yeah goofy
aside then we'll talk about heterosis which was really like the foundation of
plant corn breeding and the development of f1 hybrids we'll also talk about
transgressive segregation which is a unique form of a similar type of
phenomenon but it happens in later generations and like the f2 or later
and it's actually where heterosis is like the phenomena of hybrid vigor where
you take a you have a essentially heterozygous genotype it's cool but it's
not fixed so if you make an inbred cross from that an f2 be it whole sibling or
selfing you're going to get variation in that population whereas with
transgressive segregation what you get is a fixed genotype associated with
traits that are of a greater expression or a more extreme expression than the
parent material or the f1 material so it's like it's an f1 hybrid with a fixed
genotype is kind of how to think about it and we'll get into some of the other
key ideas that were happening at the time that really kind of found push the
study of like experimental plant design and like plant studies and add a model
organism research and the development of population genetics which is really
founded on theoretical mathematics of like essentially statistics and also
the work of some individuals named Thomas Morgan and Alfred Scrutavant who
came up with chromosome theory and the linkage map that's everything on this
page right here basically shows the theoretical foundations that are
necessary for doing plant breeding and were like the basis for everything that
happened up to and through the modern genomic revolution so when they develop
genetic markers back in the day they use the techniques and the data sets that
these individuals use to do all this stuff. And that's you know that's so huge right there just that slide alone is kind of the
blueprint for going out and studying a lot of this I mean the first one that
you list Mendel's experiments and that's usually the first one that people hear
about and that they come across so yeah please do tell us a little bit more
about Mr. Gregor Mendel. Yeah Gregor Mendel was a he was an Augustinian monk who in 1865 he gave a
presentation verbally over a couple of months and that presentation also had
his attempting paper which was then published in 1866 and in it he laid out
the results of his experiments that he had conducted evaluating the inheritance
of specific traits in garden peas. He looked at seven discontinuous traits.
Discontinuous traits is another way of referring to qualitative traits or
Mendelian traits. They're the traits that are controlled by a single gene and so
what Mendel was able to do through this experimental design he set up he took
pure breeding self-pollinated peas with different traits crossed them together
and then performed a series of crosses from the those F1s that he initially made
to see how inheritance populations mapped over multiple generations and
that's where we get the classic laws from Mendel the law of segregation the
law of independent assortment the it's not necessarily a law it was more of an
observation and he didn't characterize it in such way but the the dominant
recessive relationship is also something that he identified and he did this just
by growing having a plan from the beginning setting out how to test a
hypothesis and then testing that hypothesis with data and demonstrating
that the plants were actually inheriting traits even though in the F1 generation
he wasn't seeing the expression of particular traits he was able to see
them in the other in the next generation in the F2 and when he did the math he
was able to identify the ratios that you would get or just a very simple
bi-allelic frequency where you have a single dominant and a single recessive
gene so to speak and and that like that this set of discoveries really laid the
foundation for scientific plant breeding in the field of genetics and it happened
shortly after Darwin's paper on evolution and natural selection had been
published and Mendel's Mendel's research was not really it was overlooked the
significance of his experiments because he was using simple traits and peas and
because very quickly after the discovery of like Darwin's discoveries his cousin
Francis Galton developed ideas did large regression analysis and showed
that there were continuous traits within populations so people didn't think that
like these discrete traits in peas and the inheritance of those mapped on to
human species and like that wasn't even really acknowledged or addressed for
about 30 years because the paper just was ignored it went completely
unrecognized got rediscovered in 1900 by multiple different researchers Hugo
DeVries who was a he was a researcher who was doing research in mutation and
believed that mutation was the basis for speciation in evolution and basically
ended up finding Mendel's research and seeing that it was very similar to his
own Carl Corenz was another individual who his professor had been in
correspondence with Mendel during the time of his research and he ended up
finding Mendel's research and then Eric von Teschemark was I think his
grandfather had actually taught Mendel botany when he was like at university
and he ended up rediscovering Mendel's work all at the same time and that
rediscovery laid the foundation for you know plant breeding and genetics but it
took about 20 years for 30 years for a really incredibly contentious debate
between the Darwinian slash biometricians they were Carl Pearson and
Francis Galton were kind of like the progenitors of that school of thinking
and they just did very very detailed scientific statistical analyses of
continuous variation in human populations and looked at Mendel's work
and said this no this doesn't work and it wasn't until Ronald Fisher and C. Wall
Wright and JBS Halliday in the 19 teens and 20s came around and really mixed
figured out the mathematics to put Mendelian inheritance and simple traits
how you could explain complex traits controlled by multiple genes if they
were inherited through a Mendelian process and how these continuous
variations that you see in large populations are the result of the
inheritance of multiple different in Mendelian inheritance of multiple
different genes and so that was that's really like the the foundation it really
feels if you go back and read old papers from the 19 teens and 1920s it's a lot
like reading old forum debates where there are people in internet forums are
the same concepts and making the same scientific arguments that either side
may yeah wow that's that's awesome that's funny that does make me want to
go back and look at it yeah yeah no it's cool like and you know some yeah like
academic like shade can be kind of funny you know like they were definitely
different camps and they were pretty sectarian and their beliefs a lot of a
lot of people scientists and breeders the same we get very invested in our
position and anything that challenges it you know is hearsay or it can't be true
because it flies in the face of what we think so what the Mendelian his work was
kind of met with a little skepticism because it doesn't sound like it really
caught on that quick to 20 years yeah no I mean it was completely ignored and it
wasn't that it was like it was distributed apparently there was some
sort of arrangement between different universities and academic institutions
at the time where it got distributed in the number of different copies to
different places Darwin apparently had a copy of it he may it's not clear if he
actually read it or not but it's one of those things where a got distributed and
nobody really paid attention because it just seemed like well one he he was
writing you know in a what in German so unless you spoke German you probably
weren't gonna read it and then it was also a combination of math and like he
was doing statistics and it was kind of early days for statistics and
unfortunately he was people kind of will say oh well Mendel didn't like he just
got lucky and it's like he didn't get lucky chose the seven traits that he
chose specifically to demonstrate the principle that he was trying to
understand and so he picked the right traits because apparently in his notes
he had a list of like 16 different traits and he like got rid of all those
other ones and was like no these seven they seem to work in the way that I
think they work so I'm gonna focus on these and I don't understand how those
other traits work so I'm just gonna focus on this to see if this demonstrates
the the hypothesis of inheritance and so we're all very lucky that he did that
but it definitely it did not catch on for really until 1900 and then it became
two very bitter camps of the Mendelians and the biometricians and it wasn't
until some people who were incredibly skilled at math were able to figure it
all out and put the pieces together that it all it works out. Wow yeah have a fast
enough computer to figure it out. Cool all right sorry sorry to interrupt you there.
No no that's that's legit and and feel free please interrupt me and add like
you know dialogue and like any input here because this will get dry but we
are going hopefully by the end of this we'll have a firm grasp of the
principles of plant breeding and how we can apply those in cannabis and so like
we're here we have qualitative versus quantitative traits I've gone into this
a bit already but qualitative traits are classic Mendelian genetics where the
traits have a discontinuous distribution and are typically determined by a
dominant recessive relationship. There can be more complex versions of that
like co-dominance and complete dominance and stuff like that but typically you'll
see a very simple straightforward distribution like this one where there's
one recessive, two heterozygous and one homozygous dominant in the population
distribution and that's what Mendel identified and found in his studies for
the different traits that he looked at. When you add more genes you get more
combinations and with quantitative traits that are controlled by the
interaction of multiple genes with each one has a small effect and the
environment also influences these traits much more. There will typically be a range
of overall trait expression that is continuous and the first person to
really demonstrate this was Nilsen L and the top graph over here that shows three
gene pairs that maps to the actual math that he found in the gene that controlled
wheat color or the color of the kernels of the grain and wheat and so this next
shows the different studies that essentially established this. First you
have Herman Nilsen L who was the director of the experimental breeding
station in Sävla, Sweden. They did a lot of very important work in the late 1800s
and 1900s establishing the pedigree method and the bulk breeding method and
doing like their pedigree records were some of the most extensive and oldest
and were able to be used to prove and demonstrate a lot of different Mendelian
inheritance dynamics and populations but he published research on the inheritance
of grain color and you can see the distribution at the bottom of the chart
matches the same as the previous chart when you've got three genes that control
a trait you'll see a population distribution that's like this in the F2
generation where you've got 1, 6, 15, 20 across same on the other side. Then after
him Edward M East conducted similar research analyzing inheritance of
corolla length that's flower length in nicotina or nicotiana. He did that in
1916 and it really confirmed the same principles. He also talked about
transgressive segregation in that paper and it was one of the earlier papers to
mention that phenomena but both of those demonstrated that quantitative traits
even though you have more gene pairs they still conform to the same
principles of segregation and independent assortment. And the dude who
really like ended the debate and like finished it was Ronald Fisher. He
published a paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of
Mendelian inheritance in 1918 and essentially he looked at human
populations and said if we take the principles of Mendelian inheritance as a
given and we look at this continuous variation in this population here's the
math that could explain how you could get to that end result. And he like
Ronald Fisher's work in mathematics is really hard to overstate. He he helped
establish experimental design and like almost all of the different statistical
analyses that are at the foundation of most modern sciences. He really worked
out the math on a lot of those and so he was the person who took the theory of
Darwinian evolution and the theory of Mendelian inheritance and proved
mathematically that they work. And ever since then that's been known as the
modern synthesis. And while it's important to the evolutionary theory
it's also incredibly important to plant breeding and his ideas on variance, his
different ideas on inbreeding and all of those different ways of doing different
mathematical analyses of variation within a population are the foundation
for how we are able to actually take multiple an individual trait that's
controlled by multiple genes and very uniformly accomplish significant gains
in terms of the overall values for that trait in the population. So were it not
for the development of the mathematics that him and some other folks that we'll
talk about helped develop, this idea of developing inherited like breeding for
quantitative traits would not be as effective as it is. And this was done as
we'll see like long before the advent of you know marker assisted breeding. So
quick summary, Mendel analyzed inheritance of qualitative traits. He
conducted his experiments in these. He used a well-designed set of experimental
crosses and math to demonstrate this. Subsequent theoretical and experimental
works extended that idea to more complex inheritance of quantitative traits. That's
really where the bulk of interest and the bulk of focus if you're a plant
breeder should be. Like it's very cool to do experiments with Mendelian traits to
understand the modes of inheritance and how these like basic principles work and
for like as proof of concept. But the vast majority of traits that we like be
it biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, yield, pretty much sexual
stability, any one of these traits is a multifactorial or a quantitative trait.
Also Mendel used the term factor. So early papers oftentimes use the term
factor or factorial and when they do that they're referring to genes. That was
the term that was used before for this guy Wilhelm Johansson. Wilhelm Johansson
developed the pure line theory. He basically did a series of experiments to
see how inheritance of bean size happened in a heterogeneous population
of beans. And so this graph shows what his experiment was. He had a mixed
seed source. He sorted them by size and then planted those seeds and tested to
see how big they were and the variance within those populations. And he
basically out of that experiment he was able to demonstrate that when a
heterogeneous population is subjected to inbreeding it segregates into separate
homogenous subpopulations of pure lines. So these individual pure lines become
homozygous for the particular traits that he was studying. And that
essentially he demonstrated that selection was ineffective in those pure
lines for producing variance within those traits. The phenotypic variance
that he was seeing when he did this experiment was the result of the
different environmental effects in those seasons. And he couldn't
essentially take one of these smaller beans and just create like a bigger bean
or one of these bigger beans and create a smaller bean within this population
because the traits for each one of these expressions was locked in. And there
could be some variation but that variation was just a phenomena of the
environment that was happening in that particular growing season as opposed to
an inheritable trait that he could then continuously increase the size or
decrease the size based on selection. And this also reconfirmed Mendel's theory
that a continuously varying trait can be inherited in a quantitative, in a
continuous fashion. So the entire population can continuously produce this
range of phenotypic variation. He then coined the term gene and later develops
the distinction between genotype and phenotype and this is where we get the
genotype environment interaction. So with his experiments he was able to
demonstrate that the expression that we're seeing in observable
characteristics can change while the underlying gene may not change and we
need to measure that range of variation. And that's how you're going to be able
to tell the heritability of a particular trait. If a trait is only responding to
an environmental variable then it's more than likely not a heritable trait. If the
trait is responding to genetic variance then you have a range of heritability
and you can change the ratios and the overall genetic composition of the trait.
So real quick because genotype is one that sometimes garners a lot of
confusion for people because genotype sometimes people you know think that it
is locked in you know the gene is the gene it's going to express itself the
same every time. It's the phenotype where you get the variance or the expressions
but with this variable of the environment it sounds like there is
actually a little plasticity to genotype whereas my environment, your environment,
the same genes will still be a little bit different. Am I kind of framing
that correctly? So he's basically saying genotype is constant and not changing
when you're dealing with a pure line. So when you're dealing with a truly
homozygous individual for a particular trait and that trait is there isn't any
variance in the population for that trait. Every individual has the same
genotypic variance. They're all homozygous dominant let's say.
And we can just say it's purple.
Okay yeah they're all purple. So that purple as a genotypic expression let's
say it's homozygous, it's a fixed trait. That is something that you're not
going to get any additional purple because of the genetics. You can cross
those plants in that population or self that individual and you're not going to
get any increased purple. But you may one year get a more extreme expression of
purple because you know your diurnal temperatures are much colder and
purpling is a phenotypic expression that is at least in part related to an
environmental characteristic of cold temperatures. So in an environment where
you've got colder temperatures one season you may actually have a much more
dark and extreme purple expression. But then in the next season when it's much
warmer that environment is less conducive to the expression of purple
traits. And so as a result even though you've got the exact same underlying
genotype the next season's purple expression is nowhere near as extreme as
the other years. And when you like measure those and evaluate them from year
to year like if you were to do a breeding program for a purple specific
like purple and gold you would want to score your trait on a continuum of like
not so purple, kind of purple, yeah okay it's purple, oh that's purple, fuck that's
purple. And so a plus five is like fuck and that's what you want but if you're
selecting just on that you're not accounting for the environmental
variables there and you see the five and you're like oh yeah no it's purple it
produces just like the deepest darkest purples every time. But that was just a
phenomena of one year's environment or maybe multiple years environment and not
necessarily the result of a fixed genetic variable or a not necessarily
a result of a genetic variable as much as a environmental variable which
produces variability within your phenotype. And so and like each one of
these creates different levels of variance so you can have genetic
variance you know homozygous, heterozygous or additive, non-additive
when you're dealing with more quantitative traits you're not really
dealing with dominant, recessive. As much you're dealing with a more complicated
math scheme of variance which is something that Fisher developed and so
in that situation your genes create some degree of variance, the environment
creates some degree of variance, the interaction between those two then
creates another level of variance that can be in addition to just the genetic
variance. So you can have genetic variance and when they do the equations
they have ways of quantifying each of these different levels of variance and
interactions between different types of variance and that's what produces your
phenotypic variance. It's the complex interaction between not just gene and
environment but gene, environment, gene, X environment. It's like the equations when
they write them out have an extra bracketed level of complexity based on
the interaction and that's really what had Wilhelm Johansen not developed these
theories or like done this experiment and presented all of this we wouldn't
have that conceptual apparatus and like every study subsequently that is really
looked into and refined these ideas has kind of stemmed from this initial
conception of the distinction between the expressed phenotype and the genotype
and then trying to figure out what's the variance at play there. Awesome, thank you.
Yeah so it does sound like just kind of you know again please correct me if I'm
wrong again but but the genotype is kind of fixed then it is what it is with some
variance to it as you're saying but that environmental factor is more of
it's either going to amplify the effect of the said genes or turn it down. Yes.
Okay. That's really a great way of framing it because that's what happens
if you have up regulation and down regulation for particular things and so
you know like if you're growing herb in suboptimal conditions you're not going
to have up regulation for all of the biosynthetic pathways that you're trying
to up regulate for to produce the terpenes to produce the cannabinoids
because you aren't producing you aren't providing the environmental inputs that
the plant needs to express those things and so a lot of times all like the
genotype is are they set parameters whereas the environment then determines
the range of expression within the parameters created by the genetic
material essentially so like if you if you don't have the genes for you know
some minor cannabinoid or for high ratios of a particular cannabinoid
you're not going to get it by just crossing that population together you
gotta add variance into the population through genetic variance and you know
there used to be ideas that you could just take a variety from X location and
then move it to another location and that change in environment would then
result in higher cannabinoid production and it or if you take it up into a
higher elevation you're gonna get higher cannabinoid expression and that's going
to be an inheritable trait and that doesn't appear to be the case like you
may get a higher expression within the relative parameters that are set by the
genotype you're not just gonna be like hey I got high THC fucking cannabis out
of nowhere when you're rocking like true industrial hemp genes you know like that
kind of mutation is rare and it's not like and that's what that would be that
would be a mutation and you mutated genetic variance through mutation is a
very rare thing it does happen but it's not like yeah it's not very common don't
bet the farm on it exactly yeah okay and so yeah that was Wilhelm Johansson's
pure line theory and like really this kind of showed that you go down a
particular Avenue you can fix a trait but you may not be able to get increased
expression within the trait if you just go down that single Avenue you know if
you fix the weights the the size of the bean you're not gonna magically start
producing bigger beans by starting with material that has a fixed genotype that
isn't that's that doesn't have that within its genetic range of expression
so then these cats George H Schill and EM East independently discovered the
phenomena of heterosis which is hybrid vigor and essentially they took in
bread lines they kind of built on this idea from Wilhelm Johansson of taking an
inbred line and making just separate pure lines out of it and by
intentionally selfing over multiple generations because corn's a outcrossing
species but it also like it has like a weird ratio of selfing and outcrossing
because it's a windblown species that has like it's diocese or like it
pollinates itself but it also is receptive of other pollen sources and so
they intentionally through mechanical like interventions created inbred lines
as you can see these inbred lines are very small relative to their hybrid
offspring and that was largely a result of the inbreeding depression that gets
experienced when you start fixing delterious recessive it's usually
attributed to recessive traits but when you inbreed long enough you start seeing
a depression in the overall yield and expression of the traits but what they
demonstrated was that if you then cross these together you produce hybrid
offspring that exceeds the trait expression or the yield or the the
parental material and this was really revolutionary because breeders had been
using a open pollination mass selection process for selecting corn for years and
years and years and this graph right here shows right in this area there was
essentially zero gain in yields from 1860 to like 1920 and that was because
using mass selection in an open pollinated crop wasn't actually they
weren't able to get the increases in the quantitative trait that is yield just by
this open pollination process instead they had to work these inbred lines and
then develop the hybrids and it took a little bit of time because at first they
weren't economical and they did double cross as like a intermediary stage
because literally the inbred lines didn't produce enough seeds to like plant
all the corn across the you know the country and or world so like they just
didn't have enough actual seeds produced by the inbreds and the hybrids to like
when you take two inbred lines and then make the cross you weren't they weren't
able to get enough seed to meet the demand and it took them a number of
years and a lot of it had to do with the labor cost of detasseling and so once
they got cytoplasmic sterile lines of corn that's really here on this line
and that's when f1 hybrids from single crosses of inbred lines became the
Norman plant-earned maize breeding and like these yield gains are fucking insane
like that's it's pretty incredible what plant creators were able to do and
there are all sorts of drawbacks with this this is definitely a resource
intensive method of crop agriculture and also you know the camera talked about it
a couple weeks ago but they basically by taking this approach ended up
breeding in a susceptibility to a blight that ended up wiping out corn production
in huge areas yikes yeah yeah yeah monocropping that's a different subject
exactly yeah but like this is like where we're here yeah with cannabis or
yeah just in general okay yeah the cannabis like population and like I mean
we've gotten some gains like this in terms of particular traits like I'm
sure if you were to map THC in particular you would see THC concentrations
that would map on a graph somewhat similarly to this we've had enormous
increase in cannabinoid concentrations that said we're still dealing with a
largely open pollinated population structure that has been there's been
selection for particular traits and that trade architecture is definitely like we
see it it's pretty ubiquitous but because it's been this process of
introgressing whatever the new new is and like constantly being like okay
we've selected this thing now everybody's gonna use this thing right
doing that for 30 years makes it so that like you know we've got a population
structure here and if we start doing the inbreeding and then doing the
hybridization particularly with cannabis being an obligin outcrossing species
which we'll get to a little bit here but like that that reproductive system makes
it so that hybrid breeding is really kind of the end goal and the like not
the end goal it's it is the commercially most like it will put you
on this kind of trajectory and make viable commercial products that can be
grown in large-scale agriculture and can be monocropped essentially and that will
be economically a boon to certain individuals and corporations that do it
yes yes that doesn't mean that that's the only way like that is one way and it
will produce incredible gains but it has incredible drawbacks and that's that's
what I kind of was getting at with the chimera right like this is one model
it's not the only one do you think that inbreeding depression has anything to do
with why we may be at that low baseline right now or does that kind of play into
it later because no that definitely plays into it that's like we have a
weird it's like we have inbreeding depression but we've ameliorated that by
constantly intergressing new things and like outcrossing it so much so that we
have a highly heterogeneous population that's just been skewed for particular
traits so what we have is mass recurrent selection for cannabinoid profiles some
solid selection on terpenes but largely that's a crap shoot and then like yield
and like flower time like those are the primary traits that people have really
skewed the genome of the plant and kind of developed some bottlenecks in terms
of trade expression and on some levels it's good because we're seeing some
skewed higher expressions but what you're gonna see is that you're not
going to have as good gains in those traits as you will with other things and
where we haven't really like fucked around is yield and so like we're down
here in yield because we've got all these different traits but we haven't
put them onto a thing and uniformly established like okay this is the art
the trade architecture and the plant structure that produces the best yields
and the best in this like regional agronomically important area like the
Central Valley of California or Mendocino or dry yeah yeah and and so
that's something where like there's for most other crops like there's a corn
belt that like stretches the world there's a cotton boat they're like
particular areas that these crops are grown in based on their environmental
characteristics and the crops are bred to do best in those environments and
they've been specifically like the characteristics of the plants as they're
being like developed and like brought to market are for the environments that
they're being produced and like with us we haven't even begun to scratch the
surface there yeah we're just starting that conversation of you know again I my
goal is to get things for people in tents low ceilings indoors limited space
something that's gonna put out there but to kind of play off what we've already
been learning earlier you know the yield and stuff the yield that you had
mentioned the kind of the structure you mentioned those are all qualitative
taits traits that that would kind of fall under Mendel's dominant recessive
because we're able to physically see this one yielded more than that one
well no they're quantitative because we can we can look at all the yields on
every single plant and be like okay this one was like way down here on the low
end this one's way up here and when you map all of them out you're probably
gonna see a distribution that's closer to a bell curve and it's a much bigger
range of variability typically with yield than there is with like typically
a qualitative trait is a yes-no thing so is it purple is it not purple is it
auto flower or is it photo period is it is it the the mutants are great examples
as well you don't need you don't need data really like you said it is the yes
no whereas yield yeah I guess that would be a better way of tracking it you know
I'd rather have data from a thousand plants versus the 20 I could see
physically like yeah well these are the yielders over here yeah yeah and you'll
usually see that like or like with that type of breeding essentially what
happens is every generation you doing this phenotype analysis and the tracking
of the data on yields and so you'll be like okay the parent population has this
continuum for the yield and the mid parent like yield expression is X and
then the next generation you'll grow out the population and you'll look at the
mid offspring so like what is the mean for the parents what is the means mean
for the offspring in terms of yield you compare those and that right there is
the response to selection that's and that will tell you the heritability or
the response to your effort to improve that trade so if you get you know the
mean for the parent on yield is like X and it then increases to whatever in the
next generation to Y well then you've demonstrated that your selection in that
generation was a good positive selection for that particular trade
you've improved yield let's say and that's every generation you're doing
that and like that's how that's how traits are improved on quantity on the
quantitative level and a lot of that is establishing like a threshold where
you're like okay we're gonna take the top 5 to 10 percent of the elders in
this generation we're gonna keep the seeds from those and we're gonna
propagate them in the next generation and keep doing that that's typically
like the intensity and the accuracy of your selection is oftentimes a function
of the threshold that you're creating for like how many of the population are
you going to use to create the next population thank you and like this graph
kind of shows a crazy example so this is transgressive segregation and what you
can see in this picture is this right here is one of the parent plants this
right here is one of the other parent plants and this is tobacco they
hybridized those two plants and produced this plant and you can see that
there's clearly a gain from here to here like this one's relatively equal but
like they get a good gain on relative to one of the parents and this is an f1
hybrid where heterosis is being exhibited relative at least to this
in the f6 generation so this is after six generations of inbreeding this is
the transgressive segregant that emerged in the f2 population that they just
continued to inbreed that far exceeds all of the other its parent and
parent populations this is how you can significantly increase and fix
particular traits in this instance it's bigger and yield so transgressive
segregation like I said is a similar phenomenon to hetero heterosis but it
happens at later stages so this quote from Goulet in 2017 quote transgressive
segregation is distinct from heterosis because it manifests predominantly in
the f2 generation and later in nicozis indefinitely once established this shows
that like this plant was a transgressive segregant in the f6 generation but it
had already shown itself by the f2 and it was by selecting the transgressive
the one or not one but like by by selecting the individuals there may be
more than one that are the most extreme in phenotypic expression that exceeds
the parents is essentially within the like f2 population is a transgressive
segregant and is something that is worth one identifying and two breeding with
because you've essentially fixed the genotypic value for that trade and it's
inheritable from that line you can you know you keep selfing it it's going to
continue to produce that trade and you're not going to get variance within
that trade and like this should be exhibiting significant in breeding
depression but it's not because of the transgressive segregation dynamic and
it's a very complex like essentially they think it's a complementary gene
action combined with epistasis that makes it so that even though you have a
homozygous genotype the overall gene interactions produce this extreme
expression and these are the different papers that look into it it was
predicted by am East and described by him JP Blottsy wrote a book on evolution
and it was then more like researched in the 1950s and really kind of like
empirically demonstrated by HH Smith who was the person who did the research in
1950 on tobacco there's research into tomatoes on the transgressive
segregation and if you go into the forums or you read anything by DJ short
if you read anything by Tom Hill they're oftentimes talking about the
phenomena of transgressive segregation and how you want to have your selection
frequencies at you know five to ten percent of a very large population you
want to track that population for the traits that you're most interested in
particularly for these quantitative traits and a great deal of like detail
so that you can be like okay here's the threshold like these plants are the top
10% yielders or the top five or if you want to be extremely selective the top
1% of yielders and that's how you're going to be able to track transgressive
segregants and also track the response of the traits that you're selecting for
from one generation to the next. Chromosome theory we talked a little bit
about this with Chimera on the the breeding roundtable and it was really
interesting to hear him talk about just how chromosome theory emerged and also
how Alfred Strudivant was a 19 year old student who literally just took home a
huge stack of data from fruit fly breeding experiments and while looking
over the data identified some patterns and essentially what he did he was able
to calculate the crossover rate for traits within a population and they had
mutants so they had a white-eyed mutant that seemed to be a male sex length
trait because they had that one individual that showed up with a
mutation that was a recessive sex length trait that made it so the offspring I
believe the females had white eyes as well. He was able to track that trait
throughout the population. He was then able to track the other traits that the
population was also had and through that he essentially did the math and found
that it happened in a very unique or a very predictable and consistent pattern
and the closer a trait was to another trait on the chromosome determined the
likelihood that a crossover event between the two traits happened and
because it was so consistent you could actually map it and essentially in 1913
he created the first genetic map so when people talk about genomics or you know
marker assisted breeding or you know understanding the actual like where the
placement of a trait is in relation to another trait on the actual chromosome
the mathematics for figuring that out and developing those ideas were first
developed by a 19 year old in 1913 so when we talk about like having a pencil
and paper and a calculator like that literally is how this stuff was figured
out and you know like granted I personally lack the statistical
background to like do the math but I know a guy and the internet you know
like the cool thing about all these things is now that they exist we're able
to a lot of times input these formulas into like we can input data into a
formula that already exists in an internet like website that you can find
and you can figure out the these types of data and or these types of like you
this one's a little unique I mean genetic mapping is very like involved
and they literally spent like the better part of the 1900s like mapping all sorts
of like mice maize barley and all these things and really extensive detail and
then like in the 1990s genomics came around and they're like fuck now we can
do this in like 10 minutes yeah gotta start somewhere but that actually really
does blow my mind that it goes back that far yeah me too I was the same thing
like I we got dropped into the genomic like you know I grew up in a post DNA
world where like you know CSI blah blah blah like DNA you feel baby or some shit
and like it's crazy to think that it goes back to the early 1900s and that it
was really just people taking huge amounts of data and analyzing it for
patterns and then being able to translate that into actual material
reality like here's how this math shows how chromosomes are the mechanism on
which DNA and they didn't have DNA at that point but like they knew about
genes and they knew that there were these chromosomes and they're like okay
these chromosomes are doing some shit they're carrying these things and these
things genes or alleles seem to be ordered in a very like systematic way
and that's something that we can you know all we have to do is recognize that
if we take data and apply the techniques that have been developed by these
individuals before us and use the equations that are here on the internet
we can actually do all that shit ourselves and really like as a
community apply these tools in a way that we maybe haven't you know
individually it's it's very interesting the way like these things work because
there are certain individuals who are like way ahead of the curve and have
this shit figured out and have been doing it for years and then some of us
are like wait what like I want to fuck around and find out too. It sounds
extremely complicated but I guess once you get the formula you kind of you see
the big picture but that is kind of mind-blowing that something that big can
be used on an individual level and that's actually practical to be able to
do that to steer something that a lot of us are trying to do. Yeah yeah yeah and
that's like that's something where I feel like we when we stop at Mendel or
when the discussion stops at like very simple inheritance of discrete traits it
ends up missing the well yeah it's a more complicated discussion and yeah
there's a lot more math and yeah that's kind of why I stopped going to college
but like now that I love cannabis and I am actually interested in variation
within a population and okay fuck it I'm gonna like dive in and try and learn
statistics and not just statistics but like the history of the development of
these ideas and how I can practically utilize them in my own life and so like
now I'm all like it's my jam like yeah I fucking love statistics and math and
just looking at variance and analyzing data like data is something that I now
find very interesting and a large part of that has to do with just learning
about breeding as like an entry point into mathematics. And the practical
applications yeah definitely it's it is funny what what lengths you go to to
learn or further your knowledge when you're interested in a subject I'm not
gonna not gonna claim to be like the great you know youth student or high
school student or anything like that but when it came to you know not too long
ago going back to school for the sustainable ag stuff motherfuckers on
the honor roll like straight A's like I'm like where did this happen already
you know it's like I called my mom right away I'm like look at my report
card so yeah I hear you there. Totally yeah yeah and that's I mean you know
it's one of those things where a lot of us like people who got into cannabis in
our it's you know prohibition made it so that like we all learned about cannabis
either from our friends or at a very early age I happen to be like in it in
it and like I honestly it was when I met as a like 12 year old some other kid who
like was a suburban sort of like normal person and he was like oh yeah steal that
shit we can get high I was like wait what? I'm into farts and shit like okay
I'll be down and that's when I realized that you could get high and then once it
was found out that I was getting high and shit it was like well fuck it like
okay like you better make some fucking trimming money sort of thing out of it
and like stop stealing fucking people's weed dumbass. It was kind of like the vibe on it
and so like for me I feel like so much of the counterculture was kind of like
anti-authoritarian anti-system and so like a lot of that manifested in my
early years of being anti-school but now like I fucking loves that shit and
like you know it's why I did eight years of college like these this type of
information is something that makes it so that if we have this knowledge we can
apply these concepts and we can understand like where they come from
without it just being like you know some something that feels like oh you have to
millions of dollars or some academic training like you really don't and like
you talk to a lot of academics and they're they're very surprised at how
conversant and engaged and knowledgeable cannabis breeders are even if cannabis
breeders don't know the you know the exact terminology the fact that plant
they're engaging in plant breeding and have experience with making hybrids with
populations they're oftentimes they're more like wow the the stereotypical
like dumb stoners like disabused immediately and you get into some really
great conversations with academics in the plant breeding space in particular
but yeah so that's kind of all of the stuff we just went over Oh last last
theoretical idea population genetics this was really the foundations of this
is like the next level shit where they really started to understand all of the
different mathematics for understanding like population dynamics and it first
started with a very simple equation it was found by two different people it's
the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and this idea is that when you have a population
that's a very large completely random mating population you're gonna maintain
a constantly allelic frequency so if you just use the traditional Mendelian
sort of inheritance and trade expression you're gonna have the
homozygous recessive the heterozygous the two heterozygous and then the one
homozygous dominant and that type of allelic frequency will continue
throughout the entire population over generations so if you don't have any
environmental natural selection if you have zero artificial human selection if
every individual in the population theoretically can mate together and
there aren't any in there aren't any barriers to reproduction then and I
think there's one other there's like for like there are four requirements that
are theoretical but that will maintain a population in equilibrium and so this
was important because it was kind of demonstrating that like yes you could
have a distribution of variance in a population that maintains like can stay
as constant even though you have different types within the population so
you can have the homozygous predominant recessive and the heterozygous and they
can stay in a constant frequency in a population assuming all things are equal
and you have random mating that's not what happens in any population and they
fully understood that but it was essentially a way of demonstrating
mathematically that Mendelian principles were at least theoretically possible in
a population that maintains some consistency because that was kind of a
question with the synthesis between Darwinian theory and Mendelian
inheritance it was kind of like well that's the case then you're gonna have
speciation and variation that leads in divergent tracks that happens way too
much and we just don't see that and so they demonstrated that the consistency
that we do see in terms of this distribution of frequency is a product
of math and then Robert Fisher or Ronald Fisher I've talked a lot about him he
he really is one of the people who puts statistics on firm theoretical grounding
and applied it to tons of scientific applications we use analysis of variance
in for quality quantitative trait inheritance analysis experimental
design is a way of checking for environmental variables or different
variables that might bias your research results so if you actually look at
breeding programs they're typically done on a plot design where there will be
however many different plots with X number of plants in each plot and there
will be a check at certain intervals and essentially they'll be able to through
that map and determine whether or not variance that you're seeing within the
trait expression is the result of placement within the experimental
design or within the the actual environment or if it's a product of some
genetic variance and he's yeah so he was really important he also is like he
was a bit of an asshole and definitely like some controversial views and was
like human see wall right another population geneticist like they went
hard at each other yeah they weren't invited to the same
fundraisers and then a JBS Haldane was an evolutionary biologist he published
ten papers that really put Mendelian inheritance and Darwin's theory of
evolution into same thing is what Fisher had done before him but just looked at
other traits and demonstrated mathematically how Mendelian theory
Mendel's in theory of inheritance applied to all these other traits he
also did the first genetic linkage maps in mammals and in humans and he also
he's yeah he's the guy who developed the rate of mutation he was the first person
to calculate that and recognize that there's kind of a uniform rate of
mutation that happens within the genome and that you can kind of like that's now
used for regression analysis and genomic dating so like when they say oh this
comes from X time period usually what they're doing is they're analyzing the
rate of mutation of the genome over time and using that as based off of Haldane's
work to say okay this is this is how much time period has elapsed from you
know when this population either existed or like now sort of thing this was
brought up I know for that the recent study out of China talking about the
early days of domestication that was a molecular clock analysis that was based
off of the rate of mutation okay yeah I did I did read that one that was pretty
that was interesting yeah trying to you know again answer the age-old question
where did it all come from exactly yeah and that's like and there are different
ways of doing that calculation and so that's something that can like it
creates variability in those dating and also becomes like you know that's a the
experts will debate over those sorts of things but really the person who that
tracks back to is Haldane and that's also how like they developed these ideas
about evolution and like for a long time it was like is mutation the result of
speciation or is it some other variable and it found that like it's a some other
variable but it was largely through his work and the last population geneticist
is Seawall Wright and this dude is very very important to the whole breeding
world he developed the concept of the inbreeding coefficient and so like when
we say like selfing increases homozygosity by X we figure that out by
using the mathematics that he developed for checking what the using a pedigree
chart and the lines of descent within a pedigree chart you can essentially trace
back and identify how much what the probability of homozygosity for an
individual in a population is based off of their their pedigree chart and their
relations and he he demonstrated it for selfing populations for full sib
populations so that means like the quote-unquote traditional F2 where you
have a male and a female sibling and you cross those two that would then produce
a inbreeding coefficient of 0.25 so essentially if you have a population
where you have a homozygous and a homozygous parent so two homozygous
parents you cross them you create a heterozygous offspring you then take the
heterozygous offspring and self it you're now going to have an inbreeding
coefficient of 0.5 where 75% of the ensuing offspring should be homozygous
25% should still be heterozygous if you do it with the siblings you're only
going to get a it has an inbreeding coefficient of 0.25 so you're really
only going to get increase of like 60% as opposed to the full 75% that you'll
get for the selfing and back crossing as well. So well no actually okay if we're
talking selfing I'm just trying to think if I don't know if you know the story
of Cindy 99 and Mr. Soul. Yes yes so this is yeah yeah a great example of this
discussion. Okay. But yeah go on go on like laying that out. Oh well yeah I was
because as you were talking that was kind of what was coming to mind because
I've liked that idea of being able to have something that's super elite that
you like but being able to get it more like that down the road by adding in
something that is easily identifiable and not elite and then you keep going
down and you were hitting the numbers but then you also said selfing and I'm
like well no I don't remember selfing being part of his process. Yeah yeah no
he was that was like oh there was there was beef back in the day on the internet
between the uh the selfers and the and the back crossers but it was it was
definitely Mr. Soul, Vic High and a number of other people were very very
big proponents of the idea of doing back cross breeding and there it was
presented as a very simple straightforward process of after four
generations or quote-unquote cubing that you would essentially take a population
where you went from a initial generation of the hybrid of a 50-50 split then you
would increase that by 25% of your recurrent parents so you go back to the
Cindy 99 let's say or the princess I think so you take your f1 offspring and
you breed that back up to those recurrent parents so now that offspring
is supposedly 75% of the parents genome then you take that and you take the
offspring from there and breed them back to the parent you do this for each
generation and every time you get like 25% 12% 6% you know 4% etc gain or 3%
excuse me all the way to 99% and then in theory by having made these back crosses
to the recurrent parent you'll have 99% of the parents genome after about four
or five generations theoretically it's true and seawall rights in breeding
coefficient is the basis for that idea but there are complications and that has
to do with linkage so when we talked about strudel bond and he was able to
calculate the distance between different traits on the actual chromosome when the
chromosomes are inherited during meiosis the crossovers that happen if
the traits are really close to each other there's typically not a separation
between the two traits and so they're inherited together a lot of times and so
while theoretically the inbreeding coefficient would result in I actually
here's the numbers if you have a highly highly inbred recurrent parent so not
princess but like a super inbred recurrent parent and you inbreed it for
multiple generations this graph shows right here what that would be so you
start out here you make your f1 hybrid you have a heterozygous genotype you
then take this and you back cross it to the parent about 75% of the population
is going to be demonstrating the parent like the homozygous parent traits again
you get to 87 93 96 98 by like generation 6 but if you're dealing with
highly like repeated back cross to a random bred individual over here so you
have a not a homozygous not an inbred line but just a random line these are
the kinds of inbreeding coefficients you're working with and as you can see
by generation 10 you're basically at 50% recapturing the gene oh wow because
that's usually if you're starting today as far as cannabis that's what you're
starting with we're starting okay interesting that's awesome math right
there yeah this charts really really helpful and it it shows different
breeding systems so here you've got the full brother sister or the offspring
younger parent and apparently in like a lot of crops the younger parent creates
a different variable than the older parent when you make inbreed like do
this inbreeding method I don't exactly understand the principle there I haven't
researched that one but selfing this chart also shows the selfing inbreeding
relationship and this is another way of expressing it so when you use selfing
for inbreeding you're going to increase the amount of homozygosity to 50% of the
first generation then by the second generation you're getting to like 75 up
around 80 still in the 80s and then into the 90s by generation 5 to 6 and 5 6 7 8
this shows the actual breakdown of the genotype so here generation 0 you have a
heterozygous population heterozygous for this genotype then you inbreed it you
self it once now you have a 50% homozygosity heterozygosity then here
and you can see even the numbers that you would have breaking down on the
fractions in the actual genotypes in this graph and so here you've got 28
homozygous to 8 heterozygous to 28 homozygous so what very quickly starts
to happen is your population starts to differentiate into this extreme over
here and this extreme over here while this starts to reduce in number and so
like by generation 7 you're getting 8128 homozygous for both dominant
recessive and only 128 heterozygous so there is that variability will still
continue to persist and you'll get to 99% but this is after you know seven
generations of selfing which is the most intense form of inbreeding and what this
rate of heterozygosity is this little fraction over here is referred to as
residual heterozygosity and even going 20 30 50 generations down the line
they've found that there will still be some tiny residual amounts of
heterozygosity even within extremely self lines that's awesome we got a Peter
Peters joining us in the chat he's he's actually saying the little present
button in the upper right hand corner next to the yellow share it's like if
you press that then it might actually or the present button oops my bad no that's
okay yeah I'll take it off full screen here let's see
bump bump okay that happens sorry sorry to throw you out there oh no it's all
right I'll get it
makes a different view for you it's kind of the same let's see here if I go to
full screen yeah it's a little bit bigger over on this end I don't know how
easier it is for you you can go back to the old way if it's easier to oh no this
is fine sorry the okay so yeah we just yeah we're good so um yeah and this is
where like we've already kind of jumped ahead but these are the ideas here and
like when chimera was on the breeding panel he kept stressing the importance
of understanding the reproductive system of cannabis and that's something that I
definitely think is important and there's a reason why even though it
seems kind of rudimentary like it's fundamental to the process and
understanding that is really key and so like these are the basic reproductive
systems that you have for the species you've got out crossing which is
cannabis cannabis is a naturally out crossing species you've got selfing
species so like barley or a lot of the cereal grain crops are selfing crops
peas are selfing crop and these are plants they're autogamous they they
pollinate themselves 90% or more of the plant kingdom is minocious meaning that
they produce both sex parts and are able to pollinate themselves typically
speaking cannabis where you have a diocese species that's when pollinated
it's able to do very lots of intercrossing within the population a
sexual reproduction is another form of reproduction certain plant species also
have this like potatoes tubers different things like this have ways of
reproducing themselves there's this is a unique form in like the actual like in
in nature cannabis isn't an asexual reproducer but we are able to do a
sexual reproduction through cloning and micro propagation and also selfing
through chemical manipulation so it's each one of these is applicable to
cannabis even though it's an out it's an obligant out crossing species and each
one of these types of reproduction then has implications for the species if you
have simply a system of asexual reproduction and we're completely
dependent on clones and then I don't know a fucked up virus shows up and
starts wiping out crop production like hoplite and that creates a very a crop
species that is very much at risk of pest and pathogen pressure and a
industry and production that is put at risk because of these types of pressures
selfing with an out crossing species results in inbreeding depression and so
you'll get more deleterious outcomes in terms of the population but that can be
offset by things like heterosis and the fact that you can use those inbred lines
as breeding material but it's like you know there are without a doubt some
genomic consequences of choosing a path of extreme inbreeding and it can result
in just individual plants that may not be as productive plants or families that
may not actually continue to be viable because they're simply not able to
survive they'll either be infertile or they won't yeah they'll literally die
off and those are forms of there's a I always forget the term for this one but
there are barriers to inbreeding essentially and in out crossing species
and they can be greater or lesser and in cannabis it's an intermediary so cannabis
is a dioecious male-female species it has male and female sexual organs on
separate plants it's anamophilous so it's a windblown pollen and this came up
on the breeding roundtable apparently I was looking at some studies and Camara
had mentioned that in Spain and France they're able to estimate the size of the
Moroccan hash crop based off of pollen that flies and like flows into Spain and
France from Morocco I believe those are the studies that have stated that
windblown pollen can move up to 300 kilometers kilometers so that's that's
pretty enormous area and the as a result cannabis is in its natural state is just
incredibly diverse and heterogeneous you have the possibility of different
populations that are separated by hundreds of kilometers interbreeding and
so that's something that our cannabis is typically a very heterogeneous very
heterozygous type population and the overall population health is typically
in that genetic state so when we put it into an intensive inbreeding program
you're gonna see a lot more recessive deleterious outcomes because those
recessive alleles while they may be deleterious in a crop like in an
intensive agricultural setting they create plasticity within a heterogeneous
population so they may produce suboptimal outcomes on lots of years but
when the environment shifts or when different variables shift in the
environment it makes it so that the population as a whole now has more
diversity to be able to adapt to new environmental conditions where it may
have greater fitness so recessive like deleterious alleles can exist within
these type of populations whereas in cell phone populations they've already
done a lot of the genome cleaning so to speak of getting rid of these deleterious
recessives because and there are also versions of deleterious dominant but
like most of these are recessive traits and those get weeded out in a lot of
cell phone populations where they don't necessarily get weeded out in
outcrossing populations so so I'm not necessarily say that you're picking
aside on this argument but if somebody was making the argument that cell thing
has its advantages that's sounds like one of the advantages it could add to
its list yeah yeah it versus an outcross yeah I mean you're gonna in selfing and
one of the reasons why it can get a bad rap is that you are going to see
deleterious outcomes and you are gonna see plants that aren't very viable and
don't produce necessarily what a commercial producer is looking for but
that process of getting rid of like on one level you can do selection against
those deleterious outcomes and on another level those deleterious outcomes
will start to cull themselves as well which is something that you want to do
like in your breeding programs having undesirable recessive traits is not
something that's necessarily good and if it doesn't affect fitness like the
mutation breeding the mutation breeding may improve fitness in certain
environments it appears I know high-grade mutants has posted a lot of
stuff about leaf morphology and how cannabis research also is another one of
those IG handles but he's talked about how the he's got the freak show line
that he's been working with for years and it has a really unique fern like
leaf morphology and how that leaf morphology while it may not be the best
leaf morphology for a plant that's out in full Sun where it's able to get the
full advantage of direct sunlight it may actually help to have that more
buried like intricate leaf pattern that is able to then catch the patchy
sunlight that's coming through a canopy because it's not wasting a bunch of
energy on this massive leaf that isn't actually ever going to get direct
sunlight acting like a big massive solar panel sort of pattern but is instead
just going to catch these little spots here and there and so it saves on
overall energy by doing this leaf system now that could be a totally beneficial
trait in certain systems and then not so much of a beneficial trait in other
systems and the fact that we have that is a good thing like that adaptability
for the species like who knows where we're gonna be climactic like 30 years
from now 100 years from now and so having that built-in mechanism is a good
thing so where selfing can on one level get rid of recessives or eliminate
deleterious traits it can also fix and stabilize and maintain those traits as
well or that may be adaptive in another environment of context and that's where
when like Kamear talks about it it's very important to both be able to use
these tools like selfing that will put us down very intensive in breeding
channels while also maintaining overall allelic frequency in populations so that
in the future when unknown things happen as they are guaranteed to happen
we will have variability that can adapt to these new environmental systems or
dynamics so selfing good and also open pollination good that's one of the
things where it's like yeah yeah that next slide is exactly that like random
mating occurs when and we kind of talked about this with the party Weinberg
equilibrium each member of the population has a chance to produce
offspring and every female gamete is likely to be fertilized by any male
gamete in that situation allelic frequency will remain the same levels of
heterozygosity and homozygosity will remain constant and genetic relationships
will also remain constant over every you'll get an inbreeding coefficient of
zero essentially that is the best breeding system for maintaining a wide
range of traits it and all of the genetic diversity it's not a way of
improving a population for a specific select trait and like that's what we did
for years like it was random open pollination maybe a little bit of
skewing based off of like I chose a subset of my population but I let like
X number of males and X number of females make seeds and then use those
the next year that's a somewhat constrained version of open pollinating
it's not the true perfect Hardy Weinberg because you don't have a large
population but because you have multiple different pairs in the grouping and
because it's randomized within that group you're maintaining a huge amount
of diversity within that population and you're not doing any positive selection
so would that be a way if you had a you know a bunch of different cultivars
there would that be a way to kind of open things back up yeah exactly that's
like when we Kev's been on a number of the roundtables the last couple weeks
and he's talked about his work with the Afghan population that he got I think
from Indian land race I could be wrong but um Indian land race exchange is
super awesome people who are out there collecting in in Afghanistan throughout
South Asia and and Central Asia and he's taken the seeds that he has and he's
just doing an open pollination with them just to maintain that population and
there used to be like this was one of the other forms of like massive biting
in like you can find old forum posts of people being very upset that breeders
were breeding and going down the rabbit hole of selfing or back crossing or
intensively inbreeding varieties without also doing the just the broad open
pollination because by doing that it's that's how you get down into the
bottlenecks that you're seeing like when I went to UC Davis the professors
basically when they talk about breeding for pest resistance and most of the
traditional crops nowadays a lot of times they start the discussion with
genetic engineering because they're like fuck we've already exhausted the germ
plasm we went down these bottlenecks lost a lot of the diversity and now we
don't really have any like there's just nothing and like we checked and there's
not resistance in the population for this thing so now we're fucking creating
these new GMO crops just to find some resistance and that's why this right
here even if it sucks and it's crappy and it doesn't produce like a commercial
or like this is the cannabis I want to smoke it preserves that genetic diversity
that is going to be the thing that gets us different traits that we need that we
don't know we need right now the starting point you always can go back to
the starting point yeah definitely non-destructive editing basically yeah
to bring it back to a music term non-destructive editing yeah but no that
fully like that conceptualizes what we're talking about here is that like we
definitely we want to do non-destructive editing we want to get that first like
it's there and then you can fucking tinker and go down from the different
lines and the different variations and create bottlenecks and the bottleneck
doesn't bottleneck isn't bad in and of itself the bottlenecks only bad when
there's no way of going down another route or having more diversity and you
can't always get more diversity within a population if you already gone down the
bottom and so like when Wilhelm Johansen went down with the pure lines of peas
that he was making he was like well fuck I could cross these two peas in this
family together and I'm not going to get any increases in yields or variation in
my trade I'm stuck like there's no more advance I can do if I want to get any
more increase I'm gonna have to get that genetic variation from somewhere else
and then so the other assortive mating systems are there's genetic assortive
mating and this is when you're doing inbreeding this is selfing, full sibs, half
sibs to be clear a half sib is when you take one parent and breed it to a lot of
different things so so much of cannabis right now is half sibs like whenever
somebody releases a line and it's like we took this male and crossed it to 30
elite cuts all of those offsprings are half sibs and so or I mean inbreeding
with them is like breeding with a half sib and so back crossing is another very
common example and like lots of people do back crossing but with each one of
these you're gonna have a different inbreeding coefficient so with selfing
you're gonna have a 0.5 inbreeding coefficient with full sibs it's gonna be
a 0.25 I think it's a 0.8 or excuse me 1 8th so I suck it like I said I suck it
but it's like we have calculators yeah these days we're lucky yes I'm sorry
no no totally that's I cheat all the time when it comes to numbers but um so
according to and I would encourage anybody who can get this book RW Allard's
principles of plant breeding is an absolute banger the dude explains this
in a way that is incredibly clear and concise and he does it in a way that
like it really synthesizes all of the history of our relationship with plants
and like since we've been cultivating them so it's really really helpful and
but he says genetic assortative mating thus serves to reduce heterozygosity
increase fixation over wheels of the same locus and when combined with
effective selection promote fixation of favorable multi locus genotypes as well
as stabilized phenotypes to the extent that they are under a genetic control so
we when you look at THC like you can see that we've done that so through genetic
assortative mating we and this is more we'll actually get to this one on
phenotypic assortative mating but like we've gone down that road and really
stabilized that phenotype or that chemotype as a lot of people will like to
refer to it throughout a lot of cannabis at this point and we've done that
through a form of either back cross breeding or like sort of adaptations of
these ideas and then inbreeding without selection produces increasing
variability between families so essentially here he's saying that when
you inbreed you're gonna create this extreme over here for the recessive
trait this extreme over here for the dominant trait if we're just using
traditional Mendelian sort of like dichotomy and that's gonna just be
divergent and without selection you're not actually doing anything but creating
divergence once you start applying selection then you start driving genetic
and phenotypic similarities that are essentially what you can see like
through the mass selection process that we've been doing with cannabis we've
driven it towards a particular trait architecture through continual selection
and by everybody basically breeding the same five to fifty plants over the last
thirty years they're all a mixed population with relative rates of
inbreeding that have undergone this sort of assortative mating so we're not it we
don't have a population that's in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium but we don't have
an inbred population because we've just done this let's select a that one let's
intergress this new one let's do half-sib breeding let's do back cross
breeding let's do selfing like because it's all of these things done by
different people it's all this collective gene pool with relatively few
starting points it's all inbred to a certain degree but it's all still very
heterozygous and diverse because it hasn't been just intensely put
into any one of these methods like I've looked at a lot of different breeding
and the only person I've seen that has done like s4 s5 seems to be GW
pharmaceuticals Horta farm if you look at their papers they're talking about
s5 and some of them and that's like the most intensive inbreeding that I've seen
on the commercial market you'll see s1s for sale which are you know ostensibly
in f2 they've got huge R&D behind them now and yeah jazz pharma or GW pharma
yeah yeah so exactly where they're like what they've done is like they've gone
down these and I'm sure other like I'm sure Oregon CBD and people that are in
the like hemp space and breeding for those sorts of agronomic trades are
really doing this type of work but in the light commercial you know you go on
to a seed bank like we're dealing with a population that's been subjected to a
lot of this different variation in terms of like these different breeding systems
with a set of a few like you know a handful of cultivars but nobody's gone
as intensive so we kind of got this in a patchwork system but it's honestly based
off of the next form of breeding which is phenotypic assortative mating this is
what we've done it's basically where you breed like to like on the basis of
phenotypic expression and so we you know you pick the cookies and the candy
you're picking two high THC high potency varieties and the variation that you
have there is more in like color and those sorts of expression but they're
both relatively similar in terms of their chemotype profile and so when we
keep breeding og chem D cookies or you know the all of the chems and we take
the things that were before them in terms of the northern lights and the
skunks which probably play into these more recent cultivars that were
using now we've just been selecting for like to like phenotypes so you know
those same half sib lists of C releases that people are doing they've largely
been selected on the basis that this is a high potency variety and here's every
other major high potency variety that's in circulation and being grown
commercially and I'm just gonna cross them all together and that process of
constantly making selections on that basis drives extreme types and so you'll
really see a bifurcation in a population and this is something that we've seen a
little bit with like the CBD varieties that were saying like they've got an
extreme CBD the ACDC's the the canna tonics things like this they're over on
one side and if you just continually select based off of phenotype for high
CBD or if you just based your selection off of high THC you'll create a
divergence between the two whereas if you cross them you're gonna get more of
a variety in between and the intermediary types will express
themselves but when you just go to the extremes and pick like to like then
you're gonna make it so that you have a vast divergence between the phenotypes
and no intermediary expression and that's kind of what we did to a large
extent like some people maintained thick or like those mixed chemotypes but not
really like those mixed chemotypes were really a oh shit I found a CBD variety
that was in the population and hadn't been bred out and now I'm going to cross
that with a high THC variety that's in my you know repertoire and that's where
we got a lot of the mixed chemotypes and so this right here these are the two
forms like this is mostly what we've done but we've done it using these
different assortative mating systems be it selfing, full-sib, half-sib or
back-crossing at least on the commercial market like we're doing this selection
process in these breeding methods and yeah so we've gone over inbreeding
coefficient these different systems then here's where we get into like actual
breeding programs so mass selection this was this is the oldest form of breeding
this is something that everybody's done forever and that's what we just talked
about where you're doing phenotypic based selection there's a positive form
and a negative form where you're actively positively selecting for good
traits that you like THC, yield, flowering time, 8 to 12 weeks these were the traits
that we were currently selected for in the cannabis population at least in drug
cannabis breeding. Negative selection is like okay here's an off type or here's a
runt or here's a plant that isn't producing the phenotypes that were
positively selecting for. Negative selection is just the elimination of
those entirely from the breeding population and so that's something where
you'll see negative selection was very popular with regard to like auto traits
people used to respond like if you had a line that was expressing auto flowering
people would just be like no we're gonna call that from the line or negative
selection against like CBD varieties and positive selection instead for high THC
varieties at least in drug markets. Then so this is just basic breeding it's not
really systematic it's just saying we're going to select all of the phenotypes
that are good we're going to reproduce them and use them for the next year. This
is literally how plant domestication happened and how people bred plants
probably for about 10,000 years until the 1800s. Pedigree method is a system
of breeding where records are maintained on the individuals in the population.
This was first developed in the 1840s and 60s by a seed company in France. It
was a family-run company known as the Bill Morland or Bill Moran seed company.
They introduced genealogical selection that's what they called it or the
isolation principle. It was later termed pedigree selection by F.P. Hallett in the
1860s he was an English plant breeder guy. The Swedish seed association
in Slavlov they really like took this shit to the next level and
collected extensive pedigree records on tons of crops for years and years and
years and that data set was really helpful in Nielsen L demonstrating the
quantitative traits are inherited according to Mendelian inheritance. H.H.
Love in 1922 first described pedigree breeding and bulk breeding in the United
States and this is the key difference. This comes from George Acquah
principles of plant breeding and genetics or genetics and breeding
excuse me. A key difference between pedigree selection and mass selection or
pure line selection is that hybridization is used to generate
variability for the base population unlike the other populate other methods
in which production of genetic variation is not a feature. So this is
the key distinction is hybridization happens in pedigree breeding and it's a
way of creating variation where the other methods are really just methods of
pure inbreeding going down the line.
This system is illustrated here in this chart by it's a paper by Robert Clark and
Mark Merlin but it shows the pedigree chart and the histories of supposedly of
the breeding of skunk number one and it shows that at first you have a hybrid
cross between Mexican, Afghan, and Colombian. The number one female and the
number one male were selected and then the number 13 male the number two male
in a subsequent generation and so on and so forth and you can literally track the
the males that were used in the pedigree for the creation of what became the
skunk one line and how after supposedly five to nine years of inbreeding at like
F9 or something they then started doing oops their yield tests and their
combining ability tests so this is where they then took specific plants crossed
all of them together and saw which combinations between which males and
which females produced the best end results and that's how supposedly they
created the skunk one. I keep saying supposedly because like you know all
kinds of controversy there and people say it was done this way in that way I'm
just saying that this chart shows how they claim it was done and it definitely
shows like this is how you can do comprehensive pedigree plant breeding
and maintain these kinds of records and show the lineage of a variety that you
breed and that if you go through this type of method that this is how you're
going to be able to produce the inbred vines that could then be used for create
as breeding stock for a hybrid breeding program or for something along those
lines and that's that's that's you know what they've done and what they've
demonstrated you know Robert Clark and David Watson and Florida Farm for better
or for worse regardless of whatever people's opinions of their politics or
like business operations are like they've proven that you can take
cannabis apply these breeding methods and produce a very valuable product line
that can then be monetized and put into like the pharmaceutical pipeline and so
you know I'm not I'm not putting a value judgment good or bad on that I'm just
saying that like value judgment on like they were successful in doing what they
like set out to do and have proven proof of concept and so we can all learn from
that at least even if we're like pharmaceutical companies
yeah and bulk selection is similar but bulk selection is where you essentially
just maintain a much more open and diverse population so it really you can
see here in these generations where you have bulk plots and very limited
selections being happening in these early plots you just grow out a thousand
f2 plants you get seeds off of them and then you take all those seeds you
combine them all together and you do that for multiple generations and then
once you're at like f5 you start doing selection and the reason for that is
this was a breeding method that was applied to barley and was also part of a
massive UC Davis did a really really long very extensive breeding program
with composite crosses and it's also been known as evolutionary breeding
method where when you do less selection early on you allow natural selection to
have an impact on the direction of the breeding program and that makes it like
it's useful for creating adaptive varieties and it's also useful for
maintaining a bit more genetic variation within a population so that you don't
cut off different avenues that you can go down in terms of the breeding program
later on so this is another way of kind of melding those two ideas of maintaining
and capturing genetic diversity while still at later points doing intensive
selection and that's what you see more down in the f5 to the f6 generation
where here yield trials are being done and selection is being done on those
individuals that produce the desired outcomes this is something that you
would want to do if you were breeding crops specifically for a particular
place so if you're you know that your cultivators are growing in this and like
you said tents like you know you were right yeah you'd want to like make sure
that you're doing your yield and your test grows intense you wouldn't want to
be doing those out in you know massive field grows because a massive outdoor
field grow is probably going to have a lot different set of variables
influencing on an environmental level that are totally independent of the
breeder selection the outcome of the genes and the phenotypic expression but
more importantly the genes in this instance and that's the thing where you
know it's really important to breed in your end environment if I'm an outdoor
breeder it may not necessarily be the best situation to take my stuff and grow
it indoors in certain instances because of the different environmental pressures
that are happening out there's those that are happening indoors indoors
light leaks are such a huge issue and breeders are oftentimes hopefully
selecting against those plants that are more susceptible to lightly firm issues
and so that's you know just an example where this is something that is a
breeding method that captures some of that natural environmental selection and
helps to influence the population dynamics that way as opposed to just you
know an individual person doing artificial selection that may not
correspond to environmental dynamics
pure line method is this is the form of breeding that William Johansson really
helped to establish and it's just selfing it's taking an individual line
and it could be a mixed line and then you would select the individuals within
that and self those and get them to a state of pure homozygosity that's it's
really just a system it's the simplest most straightforward process of in
breeding you're just selfing your line you select an individual plant you self
it you take its offspring you self all of those so on and so forth down the
line and that sorting process will eventually leave you with essentially
two homozygous distinct lines that process got added to by saying the idea
of single seed descent and this takes it one step further it's a way of really
rapidly doing this I'm not entirely certain but I've heard the Oregon CBD
people talk about rapid breeding advancement and I think this may be the
method that they're using the idea for single seed descent is that in an f2
population you take one seed from every plant and you do that continually for
multiple generations you're going to rapidly increase homozygosity of every
one of the possible homozygous combinations that you can create in the
population for both quantitative and qualitative trait inheritance and so
this way you're not going to lose any of the possible genotype combinations and
it's really the fastest way that you can move an entire population to fixed
homozygosity without losing only like frequency or like specific alleles that
could be made homozygous that's pretty darn amazing I'm gonna come back well
I'm gonna come back to all of this but you know yeah this one this this theory
is really something that took plant breeding and like so much of plant
breeding is based on shortening this you know like this but 10 f10 like
theoretically if you're an outdoor grower that's 10 years like assuming you
know artificial environmental manipulation and so like that's a
fucking long time and so plant breeding is all about how do we advance our goals
and our objectives in the shortest amount of time and all of this math and
all of these methods and principles are really just about reducing those that
time frame okay I'm seeing I'm seeing the answer here in the slide I was
thinking okay you know you said a single seed from each generation does there
have to be a male is it same male no okay I see here that itself so every f2
through f5 generation you self that and then take the single seed to kind of
follow the roadmap here yeah it's complicated because essentially in
reality you would have to do a clone and a side-by-side so that you could have
your clone that you're for seed production or you know your you do your
plants for seed production and then you'd also do your plants for testing
and seeing how they produce as phenotypes so every one of these because
we don't have a selfing variety or selfing species and we have to do it
artificially essentially what we would have to do is run a trial with all of
these plants grown for production just to see how they express in a production
context while also doing a selfing on the side to then do this breeding or if
we're we don't give a shit and all like we've already decided like variety and
a and B are the shit and we're gonna fucking go down this rabbit hole then
you would just be you have your bulk population yourself yourself yourself
yourself look at what's in there and that's really the idea here is you're
just trying to create a population that's as inbred as possible without
losing the frequency or individual combinations that are existent within
the population and once you've gotten all of them homozygous roughly speaking
you know we talked about residual hetero zygosity but the vast majority of the
lines are gonna be homozygous by f6 and as a result you're then making your
selection like let's just say this corner right here is the like 5%
threshold well like you're selecting over here so to speak you know for that
like 5% or 10% threshold of the most ideal best in the population and if you
had transgressive segregants that were emerging here or in any of these
previous generations you're not going to be losing those transgressive segregants
by accidentally crossing them with something else in their population
you're gonna keep those as a constant in that population each time and then
you'll be able to track and identify like fuck you know we took this plant we
selfed it here and in each one of these generations when we look at the test
plot it's expressing on the like you know the 5 to 10 percent in the extreme
or exceeding the parent lines clearly this is the transgressive segregant for
whatever the specific trait of analysis is so we're going to select this one and
this is the one that is the inbred breeding elite that we're going to be
using once we go to commercial production of like making a hybrid
out cross with it or and that's when you get into your doing test cross and
you know on the previous chart with the skunk number one where you test your
specific combining ability and your general combining ability of your new
variety that you've developed down here that's super inbred you then hybridize
it and see what the yield of the offspring are and the pairings that are
the best end up being the ones that become commercial offspring or
commercial offerings interesting to the thing that I always get curious about
and I don't know if it's even part of the equation here but a lot of times
we'll hear as you inbreed it further and further down the line though you're
losing the vigor yeah is it so in the goal here to reach like the f6 they have
10 is that something that's even accounted for in the equation or is that
you know not part of the goals on the list so it is but the way that it's
evaluated to a certain extent is by looking at the parents and then the f1
offspring so if you have variety a and variety B you're gonna look at the
what's the yield data variety a what's the yield data variety B that should be
a known quantity before you start like for inbred varieties of corn like mon
187 is like a variety of corn and then be something or rather it's got a number
like those are two inbred vines that are used in a lot of breeding when they
cross like they're of known yield variables when they cross that offspring
and the hybrid offspring that results it then has a mean yield that it produces
and then every one of these generations if you're doing the the test plot and
actually looking at the production in a commercial sort of setting you're gonna
see that the yield mean you know you're gonna have your mean of the population
but then you're gonna have your extremes in the population and those extremes are
that's what you're testing each generation and so even though you're
getting a lower and lower and lower yield most likely unless you're dealing
with the transgressive segregant you're still going to be able to test those
yields back to the relative to the previous generation and then once you
out cross it then you'll be able to test it back to this f1 this parent and this
parent and say okay we inbred this line we then crossed it with this other
variety and that cross produces a yield that exceeds the f1 hybrids and the
parent material so is now technically an improved line and like that's what they
did with corn like every time they got another dot on that chart showing
increased yields and like different varieties that came online that was the
result of them basically being like okay we can reach this point in corn
yields now let's make another inbred line and select for trade or for a yield
and improve upon what we've already developed and they were able to do that
you know in a linear fashion I think that's what that is again no
statistician here people but yeah so they were able to create incredible
gains in corn yield through this type of breeding method where they would in
breed it intensely and then out cross it and then trend to the extent that that's
kind of like that rule is broken it's with those transgressors because even
they're fixed and have a homozygous like they should be suffering from inbreeding
depression because of the because of epistasis and epistasis is a very
complex like gene interaction thing where all of the genes can produce
particular results even though there isn't necessarily like a change in the
genotypes but the all of the genotypes in a population could be relatively
similar but you can still have some variation that happens as a result of
epistasis this is an idea that is complicates Johansson's idea about pure
lines but it still works together and it's all because of the linkage between
different traits and their complex interactions on like on a quantitative
level and so epistasis is something that can end up making it so that you can get
epistasis and complex gene interactions produces transgressive segregants which
even though they're homozygous still express traits that exceed their parents
and don't necessarily conform to inbreeding depression and this shows
back-crossing and this is like a breeding method that we've kind of
discussed it really shows like you have your recurrent parent this is your
princess in the I believe that's what mr. soul referred to his keeper cut that
he found as a bag seed and they had a pollen donor he made his f1 then you
take that and you cross that f1 with the recurrent parent and you theoretically
recovered 50% of the genome you back cross it again theoretically recovered
79% and so on and so forth until eventually you've got 92 to 99% of the
genome recovered they've added a selfing here at the end of it and the reason why
you would do that is because by selfing after you've done a lot of back crossing
if there is heterozygosity within the population by selfing it you're reducing
the overall heterozygosity that you're going to have within that population and
you're going to create a much more uniform and like less diverse population
by getting rid of that residual heterozygosity and the the variation that
isn't gotten rid of through back-crossing whose back-crossing doesn't eliminate
all all of the variation if the recurrent parent is
heterozygous then by back-crossing you're not necessarily moving away from that level of
heterozygosity it will constantly be a feature of the breeding program and so by selfing in
later generations or between each back-cross you're essentially developing a way of getting
rid of that level of heterozygosity and increasing the amount of fixity in your genotypes.
And just for like the main reason back-crossing, Chimera talked about this, in cannabis people do
back-cross breeding for a reason that isn't really it's not the way that scientific plant breeders
back-crossing typically speaking. Back-crossing is typically done to introduce foreign genes or
introgress foreign genes or traits from one line into another so you've got a commercial variety
that is really good for all these different reasons and it's got success on the commercial
market but it's pottery mildew susceptible or it has some other agronomic trait that makes it
undesirable. If you have germplasm that has the desirable trait you want to take that desirable
trait from this other perhaps undesirable germplasm and put it into your commercial variety.
Back-crossing is the way to do it and they call that introgression and the first time it was done
in plant breeding even though it was much it had been practiced in animal husbandry for years and
the genetics had been the like the inbreeding coefficient and different things like that had
already been worked out. It was used in plant breeding in 1922 by H.V. Harlan and M.N. Pope
and they wanted to take a strain of barley that was I think it was like rough on so like they
had rough seeds and they wanted to make it smooth or vice versa. Either way they took this variety
of barley and they tried to breed the trait just using traditional mass selection where they were
F1, F2, F3, F4 they tried bulk selection they did all these different inbreeding using sibling
and selfing and different techniques like that and they couldn't get to a stabilized expression
of the trait in the population. So they decided that we have this plant that has the trait that
we want and we have our commercial variety let's just take that plant that has the trait cross it
to our commercial variety and instead of doing sibling or selfing F generations down the line
let's back cross it to the parent plant of the commercial variety that we have that's running.
And so they did this process and they were able to then create a let's just say smooth on variety
of barley so it no longer had the rough seed it now had a smooth seed and that was a trait that
they were going for. It was one or the other and that proves the method that you could take a
trait that was unresponsive to traditional breeding methods and use this back cross method
as a way of breeding or introgressing that trait into the genetic background of the commercial
variety. And now the way that it's really used is in disease and pest resistance breeding and like
or genetically modified organisms like they back crossing is essential in that breeding process but
really what they've done is and that involves a whole bunch of like obvious genetic modification
and stuff like that that happens in on a molecular level prior but then in the actual field the
process of breeding that trait into a population is done through back crossing.
And that's really like you don't see plant breeders saying like okay I've got you know
this variety and I want to now put it into seed form so I'm now going to do a back cross project
which is kind of how the whole idea developed in the cannabis world.
Yeah.
So yeah those those are the basic principles and concepts of breeding. I had some other stuff
that I wasn't able to throw in that really gets into the more advanced like there's the breeders
equation and the actual statistical methods for doing a lot of this stuff and like the key thing
though is that with all the stuff that we've talked about if you have data and these methods
you will produce the results that have been experienced in every other crop and you don't need
millions of dollars you don't need a scientific degree all you need is a interest in the subject
matter a willingness to dive into it and apply the concepts to this plant that we find super
fucking awesome. Well that you know that is this might just make it a good break point then
I mean I would definitely love to keep picking this up and keep going. I know that I need to go
back and hopefully a lot of other people you know will go back and review some of this material and
just wrap our heads around it a little bit further. A lot of this a lot of the conversations that we
hear on a daily basis we participate in a lot of that is filtered into these topics and these
concepts so I love it and I appreciate it so much that you put these together and yeah I would
definitely love to keep going on it if yeah yeah at some point if you're if you're able. I'm down
to come back and to dive back in and there's definitely like all of the next essentially
the next section that I had like at least mapped out is really just the application of all of this
stuff in a more specific and like detailed way and I feel like you know it's a totally a good point to
to take a break but if people want this one like the slideshow presentation or whatever
I'm gonna put that in the file that I've shared with you and on that Dropbox there's a
Google Drive Dropbox I've got a file that Chad and I have shared and we'll share it with like
the listeners and people who are interested in this and you know there's the thing about like
I was able to do this because I put together that Dropbox that Dropbox has all of these ideas all
of these papers and all of the material and like you can just dive in and if there's a part of this
that you found useful you can get into this slideshow look at that and then go into the file
and the Dropbox or the Google Drive and really dive into these subjects deep and get an
understanding for them. There's you know there's a glossary and a dictionary that has all of these
terms defined it's in the textbook section there's like intro there's multiple introduction
introductions to plant breeding to population genetics all of these subjects and so even though
it may feel like daunting or kind of like hard to get your access point into it this material's all
been organized and available and you know yeah I'm down to down to engage in these discussions.
Just yeah I mean just start somewhere when it comes to those folders and I mean nobody
listening right now that hasn't looked at these folders has no idea how big of a like gift this is
to everybody. I freaking just jaw dropped when I got in there I'm like I'll be busy for the next 20
years. Yeah yeah it's awesome it's really like it's there's a grand I have not read all of it
like I want to be clear like it's not like I've read every one of these papers I just see a paper
I'll read the abstract or I'll find books and I'm like this is useful for my weed shit and like
it was just a huge Dropbox file that was disorganized for the last several years and
then I was just like fuck it like I have to get some semblance of what's in here and when I did
that yeah yeah it's it's just made a lot of things like I was able to put this together
while doing a whole bunch of shit this week and it was easy because it's all just there.
Like you want to learn about back cross breeding there's a section on that you want to learn about
you know the biggest thing I feel like is the the mystery is this idea of quantitative traits
and if people just dive in on that and get past the Mendelian P thing and get into the like
how is yield actually a trait that we can improve on that's where we're gonna see just
enormous gains in breeding. And this is the right time again you know it's still it's still such an
infant mainstream industry and I'm not talking about you know mainstream as in big companies
I'm talking about mainstream as in the sheer number of people that are doing it these days.
So we're at a good point to start off right set the record straight I mean we could go down the
rabbit hole inevitably of you know markers and different traits that might be put into
different things and how we need to you know open source breed now or you know get not the
the galaxy something similar to the galaxy you know that's always there but yeah I will definitely
keep this going I can I'm having computer issues now like I still see the bulk selection slide
over the screen but faintly behind that I do see us this is kind of a every now and then recurring
video card issue I have so I can't really see chat unfortunately because I'd love to get I'd love
to get them some of their questions up for you but that in itself just makes us we'll have to do a
part two so everybody can save them up if they can't you know go back I'm gonna go back I'll
watch this again and again poke around in that directory I just you know my first thing I did
is genomics I wanted to learn more about it there was I think it was like 496 page textbook in there
I said okay I'm starting here so yes yeah sorry no totally and I'm down to do like
you know you you reached out and were like hey I want you to come on and do genomics and like
explain it in the simple terms and tell people how like with pencil and paper they can do this stuff
and I was like fuck that's like that's literally like the whole fucking story
can you just a to z this and you know 30 minutes with commercial breaks for me please
well yeah and it's like all of the the genomic stuff that we have in terms of markers like you
guys did it great the other day where you like you defined what a snip was and you like you got
into like the the real specifics on like what's a genome-wide association study what's a snip
and I was like after I did all this I was like but I haven't said snip once uh there's no markers
there's no like this isn't genomics quote-unquote but it's it's what you need to do to be able to
do that without those things in terms of like the high-powered computer technology that runs
genomics was you know a 19 year old in a fucking doing his homework and being like well like
I think there's a link here between these different traits and their inheritance and like
that's something that you know I'm totally down to come back on and talk about snips and like
actual the the very specific like because all these different markers are used for different
things and some of them are really good for doing like you know a phylos or medicinal genomics or
some of those people have done where it's like phylogeny like what's the associations between
this population some of them are really good for being like this trait some of them are really like
economical or and like affordable but don't have like the throughput capacity or some have a
massive throughput capacity but have limitations on the length of the reads that you can do and
like all of these different variables that I'm I'm down to talk like genomics genomics as well as
this yeah yeah because I would definitely love to get into that as well in the future because
I think that is gonna kind of you know dictate a lot of the future of what we may see on the market
not only in the flower but also in the seed market in the future because this work is being done I
mean we've already mapped you know like you said certain alleles for THC for CBD certain pests or
IPM resistance yeah those those things are always be already being worked on but for you know somebody
in the majority of our situations we need that foundation I like the big picture but we also need
the foundation and this is where it all starts so I'm glad that we did kind of go this route
and that's you know what a lot of people here are interested in that's that's why they that's why
they love the they love the topic and I'm no different so yeah well we could definitely
expand into that too because I'm always always curious I've got a million and one questions for
that but for tonight I you did a great job of actually answering I have a bunch of things
written down here but as as this went on I knew to hold my questions to the end but yeah you kind
of nail them yeah is there is there anything that you kind of wanted to maybe mention that I didn't
ask you or that you didn't get to tonight that and sometimes the answer to this is no but if there
was anything that you thought you might have left a cliffhanger for somebody or just just good
resources you've already put a few out there but let me I'm gonna punch in your oh god can I I'm
gonna try to punch in your Instagram here let's see if I can uh yeah um my screen is so horrible
well one thing about the uh if people have questions about the Dropbox uh it's I don't
think I saw I got the chat up I don't think you need uh um to have a Dropbox account necessarily
to be able to access it um I think you can access it without having an account um and there's a
torrent I don't know anything about these things I remember they gave computers viruses along that
road I don't know how to use it but I know that Frackler on IG is a homie and he was like hey
send me your like Dropbox file and I'll put it up on this torrent thing and everybody can like
crowdsource download and do cool distributive network sort of stuff that I don't necessarily
understand but uh there's that link and there's also a Google Drive link so if people have issues
hit me up I will try and help you get the access to it and I just want like it's purely education
like I want everyone to be able to access this information I also encourage everyone to
you know purchase these books purchase like you talked about finding a old soil science book for
four dollars like yeah I spend a lot of time like my absolute favorite reading book is not digitized
I referenced it before Principles of uh yeah there we go Principles of Plant Breeding
Robert W Allard this is the second edition this book is sorry for the plant it's Kron
it's the best plant reading book I know of and I have multiple other open source plant
reading books that are from college courses or that are available online and they're great they're
very informative I don't know how dude does it like he explains these things in a way that is
incredibly intuitive and clear and he also you can find tons of papers by Robert Allard online
he did tons of reading at UC Davis um this the work that they did was pretty interesting um
Coit C.A. Sennison I think that's how you pronounce his name he did he was a guy who really
developed evolutionary breeding method and it's cool to see somebody who's tracked a population
for I think he got up into like F100 or some shit like yeah no but crazy and the amount of data that
he tracked on this cross in this population and Robert Allard does a lot of work with the same
populations and like demonstrating in different graphs of like the inbreeding dynamics that
happen with it and so that's you know I would just encourage people to to seek it out and also
if you ever have the opportunity to go to a university extension um program like the
you don't have to have a degree to go to UC Davis and do the plant breeding program
and I assume because of COVID it's probably online these days um right but uh that's something
that is really helpful like I was given the tools and the ability to understand a lot of
these ideas about genomics and stuff and like what a SNCC was I remember during the whole phylos
debacle um a grad student from a university who was like doing work and looking to get into the
cannabis industry after after his academic thing um look do you even know what a SNCC is and I'm
like bro like one I've got Google so like even if I didn't I'd fucking Google it but like two like
yes I fucking know what a SNCC is and then like said it back to him and it was like okay like
right maybe you know something and it's like that's something where I just feel like
having these the language and the lingo is really like it's very technical and it like you got to
learn all these acronyms and shit but it's worth it and it empowers you so that when people think
shady shit and try to run a scam because a lot of like genomics right now to a certain extent is
like here's this shiny new tool here's all the bells and whistles we can sell you this product
that is a lot a lot of fucking money but like what's the practical outcome you know could I
just do a simple math equation and hang out with my plants you get a better result
no you're you're not wrong there you're not wrong and yeah that's for you know the show
uh that we did the other day where I did I talked about the single nucleotide polymorphisms
I'm like looking I'm like where did I write that down but yeah I you know I had to look that up
because that was that was in the just the the header paragraph of the study we were looking over
and it's like you know I probably said it last night it's like I know how to pronounce this word
but what does it really mean and so yeah that's why I looked it up and snips is a much easier way
of getting there so when you do know that term you don't need to go through the tongue twister and
you can just keep going through it so again to reinforce the point of terminology being pretty
pretty handy oh yeah and snips everybody loves snips because it's like you know simple you can
just call them snips fucking rflp like fuck that shit like nobody wants to talk about those markers
like it's not fun like what the fuck is like I have I it's in there and I'm dyslexic so I maybe
like superimpose something but like it's one of the markers but I like can never fucking remember
what the fuck it stands for yeah yeah so yeah and another couple more things nom de fume um
coop uh is on mr nice forum but like nom de fume on instagram he's really the person who I got that
like who told me like he kind of disabused me of the notion of genomics as being like the be all
and end all and just kind of like you know fucking do your maths bro and pull out a paper and you can
do it and he's somebody who I encourage everyone like follow him I'm sure he doesn't want me
blowing him up he's kind of like a low-key cat but like dude's fucking brilliant and uh I'd also
I just saw a border so I say borderline or bodily air I don't know I thought I saw in comments
bodily air I'd say shout out to bodily air he's a long time overgrowth cat I'll tell you like if you
guys can see my my phone here that's what my screen looks like right now I don't know if that's focused
but yeah I'm like I'm kind of hosed I can't see anything that's going on really I can hear you
and I still see a few buttons so we we can keep going well yeah uh restriction fragment
length polymorphism chimeras drop in science in the comments so like oh awesome fucking
and everyone go follow breeding cannabis um breeding cannabis chimera he's he's really
if you he should be on here like I mean the guy is like he is
if he's in the comments right now heck yeah because he's another person that uh I've really
enjoyed listening to on these breeder panels that have been going on the clubhouse lately on the
fcpo2 yeah no that was like
huge huge moment when you came on the other couple weeks ago chimera that was great just
loved listening to it and going back to it and listening to it repeatedly and uh so there's
there's just there's people in this field who are giants and we stand on their shoulders as
like is the common saying and seek them out like all of them like I don't care how we feel about
them like you know I know there's differences of opinions on different people and there's
different camps and like all of that is yeah it's one of those things yeah exactly and like
knowing it is and like going back to uh
the I did the breeding the culture series or I'm doing it in part to understand the
thinking and the logic and like what motivated these individuals and trying to do it from an
unjudgmental standpoint and instead learn and understand and like sit back and be like a fan
and appreciative of all these other breeders and that's something that I feel like we you know you
mentioned the tribalism sort of like the the dynamics of that we get into and it's like
it's so much you know it's good to understand people and try and like get out of yourself
and recognize them for their own terms and their own merits and so that's something that I hope
that the series can do and that we can really like you know look at the different methods and
compare and contrast without it coming off as being like judgment yeah and you know even if
some people are judgmental about you know I'm not a huge fan of it but that doesn't mean you can't
look past it to look at a particular aspect and in this case some of it is this you know the science
aspect of it so yeah it's it's all it's all for the better of everybody yeah and a shout out to
Kevin McKernan as well who's been mentioned in the comments like the work that medicinal genomics is
doing is incredible if you can his 2019 medicinal genomics presentation he goes really in depth
into their research into the Jamaican lion genome and what's really cool about that is they went and
they sequenced the male genome and really spent a lot of time focusing on the y chromosome and so
because of that like the y chromosome it's heteromorphic chromosome so the y chromosome
is larger than the x chromosome and so there's additional genetic material it's not entirely
what that is a lot of it's just repeats and like noise and non-recombining areas that aren't
necessarily that important or significant but like other parts of it potentially and Kevin
we'd let you be awesome to hear him talk about it but he gets into some of these specifics on like
there are some sex-linked traits or some genomic markers that indicate that there could be
good genetic variants on connected to the male chromosome and but then there's also tons of other
stuff that's just not relevant and particularly like it's not recombining it's just part of the
sex chromosome filler that's interesting because I did hear Mr. Toad talk about that or reference it
and also too I did reach out to Kevin McKernan the other day just as a kind of a hello and he
totally got back to me and said hey yeah you know I've done stuff with Future Cannabis Project before
so that that might be a possibility I'd love to put some of these you know other other peoples
together it's like you know it's like kind of when you're talking to your hero and then your hero
gets his heroes it's like well yeah bring it on yes no start doing it totally like I feel like
Kevin and Ryan Camara like there are people in this field who you know as a self-taught educated
sort of person who was like home-schooled and went to like community college like doesn't have a
hard sciences background or a mathematics background you know I listen to people like
them or Matthew Gates where they have the they know the specificity of the usage of terminology
they're very precise and exacting and they understand the material on on a much more
higher level than myself and you know I'm still don't let that discourage anybody like go hard
on that shit and like just because I don't necessarily have the background they do I feel
like beyond amazed and honored to have been able to interact with all of them and like
I've seen them as friends and colleagues in this cannabis space so like thank you guys for just
you know for being peers like all like the the fact that you're doing a study like the study
paper reviews just the format of that the study group that's what it was called yeah yeah
fucking love it like I I so much like all anytime you want me to come on like I'm totally down
because you know even if I'm not academically trained I love reading scientific papers
yeah and you know I don't you know you don't have to have letters behind your name to be an
intelligent person either so yeah I totally don't subscribe to I don't subscribe to that
but it is to to your point about these people you know an analogy is people love seeing you
know sports star sports stars perform well they love their craft they love how they do it they
love that you know there's a difference between the minor league and the major league teams
um yeah when you do get to talk to or listen to people like that it is it's inspiring it's like
you're like damn I want to have that type of command of the affirmation and stuff so yeah I
get where you're going and it is it's you know like I said man it's been really fun listening to them
and yourself sir well thank you thank you and yeah uh that uh chimera 100 percent uh I am I'm
totally down to plan the action course of like I'm that means a lot and I just I want to thank
Peter and you and everybody who's really dedicating themselves to spreading this information and even
you know I disagree with it at times like I feel that this this thing is something that's bigger
than all of us and so thank you yeah yeah my pleasure man and I really wish I could see checks
I feel like I'm missing something but I will go back when my computer recovers damn video cards
damn apple I'm switching I'm done yeah okay yeah well let's yeah let's let's wrap it up here with
the promise of we're gonna be back and I think we'll we'll be back with an expanded cast and we'll
we'll just freaking keep keep nailing down keep driving down into it because again we're all about
we're all about education uh and it's great that we could come together to do it so thank you for
your time tonight especially after your marathon day of driving yeah yeah it was good seeing you
today Peter I was down in LA back up and sat super stoked to uh be home yeah cool and uh also
got my homie shirt on uh Santa Cruz Cannabis Co. uh Adam is a homie and uh I hope he's watching
or will watch it later and like shout outs to all the homies everybody who it's part of this thing
we do yep yep we'll ride on guys and thank you chat uh for joining us and everybody who's gonna
watch this on the replay uh we sincerely appreciate that and thanks for hanging out tonight so with
that uh I will end the broadcast thank you Trevor appreciate it yeah likewise take care
chat everyone thank you you're awesome
