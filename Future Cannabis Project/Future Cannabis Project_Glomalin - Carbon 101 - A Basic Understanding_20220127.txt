[00:00.000 --> 00:02.460]  And you guys are live
[00:03.600 --> 00:05.600]  Welcome
[00:05.880 --> 00:09.440]  Happy Thursday living soil nerds shout out to Peter
[00:09.440 --> 00:16.220]  I know that he's shortly gonna be on an airplane going out to visit his father. I believe that his father's turning 91
[00:16.720 --> 00:22.400]  So that's pretty cool, man. We also our guest host today obviously is London. So we appreciate you filling in sir
[00:22.980 --> 00:27.200]  Always helping out the community. You can check out his shows also on future cannabis projects
[00:27.480 --> 00:33.680]  Just a lot of time and effort goes into his show so this community is continuing to grow a lot more
[00:34.400 --> 00:37.520]  Shows if you will, you know, there's basically two channels now
[00:37.520 --> 00:43.440]  so a lot of variety out there and please continue to let others know about this channel because I think that's
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.120]  really the main thing that has allowed us late in just one year with Peter and
[00:49.120 --> 00:54.800]  Chad Westport in London and James Loud and a variety of other people
[00:54.960 --> 01:00.240]  so where a lot more people are using this as a kind of a gateway or a way to peek into
[01:01.400 --> 01:08.680]  Deep diving deeper into complex subjects. I know for a few months now. I've been behind the scenes trying to get
[01:09.280 --> 01:14.120]  Somebody that really understands glomilin. It's something that was just discovered in
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.760]  1996
[01:15.760 --> 01:17.320]  By Sarah, right?
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.560]  so for you kind of extra nerds out there kind of
[01:20.760 --> 01:25.300]  You know, maybe we should research a little bit more on that and about miss, right?
[01:25.800 --> 01:28.320]  But for the most part it seems like this is a new phenomenon
[01:29.080 --> 01:35.120]  Relatively speaking. It's something that a lot of us don't understand and you know to be candid with all of our viewers
[01:35.600 --> 01:41.360]  No one felt comfortable to come on and talk about this until I kind of reached out to Layton and said well
[01:41.360 --> 01:43.960]  Let's do like at least a one-on-one or you know
[01:43.960 --> 01:48.120]  a one-on-one version of this with just myself and you and
[01:48.320 --> 01:55.460]  We'll try to talk about this complex subject and break things down on a very basic level and then hopefully with this show and maybe
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.920]  Continuing to reach out we can find somebody that really understands what's going on
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.840]  on a deeper level there because it is pretty magical and it's something that seems like it is
[02:05.800 --> 02:09.360]  Self-created and again, it comes back to carbon and how that you know
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.400]  We were using more of an analogy that it's like the currency if you will the soil food web
[02:14.400 --> 02:16.080]  So once we built that rhizosphere
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.640]  That's why I wanted to kind of take it to the next level and understand what happens once that rhizosphere is built
[02:22.080 --> 02:29.280]  What happens when our muscular mycorrhizal fungi is now president and what starts to be created when that goes on?
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.720]  So I wanted to start there Layton and again, I appreciate you buddy taking complex subjects
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.000]  and being billing being willing to talk about this and
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.120]  You know the beauty of this is it seems like not too many people really even understand this
[02:44.120 --> 02:47.380]  So if we say some stuff that eventually isn't right, you know
[02:47.960 --> 02:54.120]  We were kind of talking yesterday about some old gospel and some things that used to be tried and true in the cannabis world that
[02:54.240 --> 02:57.520]  Things have changed but for the most part it seems like this
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.960]  You know this rabbit hole that we're about to go down is one that no one seems to understand
[03:03.960 --> 03:10.400]  but at the same time people are on all of it and just what is kind of created with these glues and how things are
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.660]  Be able to kind of hold on to one another so I wanted to let you kind of maybe talk about our muscular
[03:16.040 --> 03:21.680]  Mycorrhizal fungi first and kind of explain what that is and maybe piggyback from last week about the rhizosphere
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.120]  And once everything is created now how things kind of maybe go more into that fiber optic network
[03:27.480 --> 03:30.920]  Where there's a life everything's alive and thriving and now it's more about
[03:31.920 --> 03:34.960]  Storing carbon storing nitrogen that kind of stuff
[03:36.920 --> 03:38.920]  No shit, here we go
[03:42.570 --> 03:46.010]  It goes back to what we talked about last session
[03:46.010 --> 03:50.730]  Where does the plant end and where does the soil begin or vice versa and there is?
[03:51.290 --> 03:52.450]  no
[03:52.450 --> 03:54.950]  true answer to that question, so
[03:57.250 --> 04:02.330]  Let's we'll start with carbon we're gonna be dancing all around carbon today, but we're not going to actually
[04:03.530 --> 04:07.210]  Dive down that rabbit hole because it's a really deep one
[04:07.210 --> 04:14.370]  so with the basic understanding that every living thing on this planet has a carbon to nitrogen ratio and
[04:15.290 --> 04:22.290]  that carbons the individual atoms bond together to create carbon chains or molecules
[04:23.010 --> 04:25.510]  So that gets really complex real quick
[04:29.050 --> 04:31.570]  Reeling it in and understanding the difference between
[04:33.370 --> 04:40.730]  Endo and ecto my car eyes ease. So these are ancient strategies at least 400 million years old
[04:41.850 --> 04:44.450]  in evolutionary processes where
[04:45.770 --> 04:47.770]  the one
[04:48.090 --> 04:50.090]  endo
[04:50.130 --> 04:57.250]  Created a relationship with the inner part of the plant so it goes inside the root where it exchanges
[04:59.890 --> 05:01.730]  Complex
[05:01.770 --> 05:03.810]  Compounds and the other
[05:07.210 --> 05:12.650]  Disassociated to some degree with the plant in the essence that it doesn't go inside the cells
[05:13.490 --> 05:19.170]  It actually coats the outside of the roots and it's really kind of cool. You can see it by the eye
[05:20.290 --> 05:22.290]  Whereas the endo you cannot see
[05:25.010 --> 05:29.250]  Mycelium means a cord so more than one body
[05:30.250 --> 05:32.250]  So if two
[05:32.250 --> 05:34.250]  my car eyes II
[05:34.570 --> 05:39.210]  Individual hyphes wrapped around each other that would be considered mycelium
[05:39.890 --> 05:45.010]  So those are some of the beginning definitions of this complex topic
[05:45.730 --> 05:47.730]  So yes, you're absolutely right
[05:48.690 --> 05:51.370]  1996 was the first time that
[05:52.130 --> 05:53.490]  this
[05:53.490 --> 05:55.290]  glue
[05:55.290 --> 05:59.410]  For lack of better words was discovered and began to get studied in
[06:00.890 --> 06:07.250]  basic reduction science we try to take everything apart down to its finest piece and
[06:08.810 --> 06:14.930]  Now we've established something but in this process or the discussion of gondolin
[06:15.090 --> 06:21.650]  You got to pull way back out and and understand that it's way more complex and more
[06:22.650 --> 06:24.130]  geo
[06:24.610 --> 06:27.130]  Chemical reactions that's happening
[06:28.410 --> 06:30.890]  And I want to give a big shout out to my study group
[06:31.290 --> 06:36.050]  Craig tester and Lee Folson who on some point I will get them
[06:36.410 --> 06:39.810]  Together and we can probably go a lot deeper down this rabbit hole
[06:40.570 --> 06:42.570]  Unfortunately, both of them work
[06:42.650 --> 06:46.570]  Are in college so they don't have the opportunity to do it during the day like this
[06:47.010 --> 06:49.810]  So it would probably be a clubhouse at night or something
[06:49.850 --> 06:54.330]  We'll figure out when and and we can go a lot deeper down this rabbit hole
[06:54.970 --> 06:57.050]  So I'm gonna stay very general today
[06:58.250 --> 07:00.250]  So what we do know
[07:00.330 --> 07:07.010]  what we do know is that glomulin is on both the inner and outer shells of
[07:07.850 --> 07:12.010]  Mycorrhizae our vascular mycorrhizae. So the endo the ecto
[07:13.290 --> 07:17.850]  Ecto does not make and nor do sapophytes or sap robes
[07:17.890 --> 07:22.490]  So this is specific to a am fungi and
[07:23.810 --> 07:28.570]  We believe or we know that the properties of glomulin are
[07:29.970 --> 07:31.970]  both
[07:31.970 --> 07:37.530]  Water highly water resistant and highly adaptive to bonding
[07:38.810 --> 07:43.210]  So glues, so here's here's another great example of trying to understand
[07:44.010 --> 07:46.010]  some of the properties of this
[07:46.010 --> 07:49.410]  You know when you take a piece of wood and you glue it together with
[07:50.250 --> 07:51.850]  regular wood glue
[07:51.850 --> 07:57.970]  Sometimes you get an interaction where the glue actually penetrates into the fiber of the wood
[07:57.970 --> 08:03.450]  And when you snap that glue joint some of that wood will be stuck on the other piece of wood
[08:03.450 --> 08:07.810]  So that's like a molecular bond. That's where the bond is is very strong
[08:08.850 --> 08:14.770]  Another example that is welding. So when you weld two pieces of metal together, it's very difficult to bond
[08:14.890 --> 08:17.130]  it's very difficult to get them apart and
[08:18.530 --> 08:21.730]  Glomulin has that ability in soils
[08:22.930 --> 08:24.650]  it can take
[08:24.650 --> 08:29.170]  clay particles silk particles organic matter whatever and
[08:29.690 --> 08:33.050]  Create this incredibly strong bond that is both
[08:35.610 --> 08:41.970]  Essentially waterproof or very very water resistant but also provides a lot of
[08:42.450 --> 08:48.650]  Incredible interactions between the carbon which is perhaps the organic matter
[08:49.610 --> 08:51.610]  as well as
[08:51.650 --> 08:54.130]  the roots themselves and and
[08:55.170 --> 09:01.370]  They in turn help support the creation of aggregates or micro or macro aggregates
[09:01.690 --> 09:05.850]  Now this is where it gets really fucking complex again. It's it's a
[09:06.650 --> 09:08.650]  geo bio
[09:08.850 --> 09:10.850]  chemical reaction
[09:11.170 --> 09:14.530]  Chemical reaction that's happening. That's occurring. And so
[09:15.050 --> 09:20.650]  What happens is this glomulin will help to create these aggregates the aggregates themselves are?
[09:21.490 --> 09:26.530]  Less likely to dehydrate so therefore they are better at holding
[09:27.610 --> 09:31.650]  water in inside them, so we're into like a
[09:32.970 --> 09:34.970]  hydrophilic
[09:35.690 --> 09:41.810]  Area where where we're actually holding moisture in and this gets back to why
[09:42.330 --> 09:44.330]  Aggregation is so important in soil
[09:45.250 --> 09:49.010]  aggregation provides pore space for gas exchange
[09:49.010 --> 09:54.650]  So that's oxygen to penetrate down into the soil and co2 to escape the soil
[09:56.090 --> 09:58.090]  as well as
[09:58.570 --> 10:04.530]  You know providing infiltration of water, which is really important. So the water doesn't just run off the soil
[10:04.530 --> 10:11.250]  it actually infiltrates in and then it gets absorbed into these micro and macro aggregates, so that's why
[10:12.370 --> 10:20.130]  You know, this is this is the the fungal component of biofilms. Now. This is where it gets really fucked up
[10:21.330 --> 10:23.330]  the latest work
[10:23.530 --> 10:24.970]  I'm studying
[10:24.970 --> 10:27.290]  this phenomenon called glomulin
[10:28.130 --> 10:30.210]  it's kind of clear now that
[10:30.930 --> 10:32.850]  There are a lot of
[10:32.890 --> 10:41.130]  Interactions outside of this one material. I can't say when you extract glomulin from soil. Oh, hey take it easy, buddy
[10:42.810 --> 10:49.930]  That it's just glomulin because it isn't they when they extract it they found that there's a lot of humic
[10:52.570 --> 10:55.970]  Particles or molecules mixed in with it that are
[10:56.930 --> 10:58.850]  basically not removable
[10:58.850 --> 10:59.970]  so
[10:59.970 --> 11:06.130]  this is again, where do you where do you define the end of the word glomulin in a
[11:07.250 --> 11:14.050]  System where you've extracted it and this gets even more complex when you start talking about extracting glomulin from spores
[11:14.850 --> 11:17.330]  really interesting study done in China in
[11:18.290 --> 11:23.570]  2018 I believe where they extracted glomulin from spores and from soil
[11:24.330 --> 11:27.210]  It's kind of complex in the soil. You have to use a
[11:27.730 --> 11:31.130]  An acid an old tremendous amount of heat I think it's about
[11:35.850 --> 11:43.010]  That shows you how resistant this is it's very highly water resistant very heat
[11:44.610 --> 11:45.930]  Resistant
[11:45.930 --> 11:50.290]  and provides a very complex association between
[11:50.930 --> 11:54.170]  not only bacteria and biofilms, but also
[11:55.090 --> 11:58.270]  Eukaryotes live in those biofilms and are also
[12:00.490 --> 12:05.410]  It's indicated that they are their excretion is also part of this geo bio
[12:06.090 --> 12:07.650]  chemical reaction
[12:07.650 --> 12:10.570]  That's occurring. So back to the study
[12:10.890 --> 12:14.730]  They they took not only glomulin harvested from soil
[12:14.730 --> 12:19.090]  But also harvested from spores and they fully sprayed it
[12:20.810 --> 12:22.650]  Oranges and
[12:22.650 --> 12:27.050]  What was really cool about this was they had a tremendous increase in
[12:28.170 --> 12:29.930]  fruit size and color
[12:29.930 --> 12:36.490]  But the real industry interesting thing is they had a wicked increase in nutrient density in foods
[12:36.970 --> 12:43.090]  Now to actually extract this and and try to do this on a commercial scale would be you know
[12:43.210 --> 12:46.330]  Just ridiculously expensive and not realistic
[12:47.330 --> 12:51.250]  Maybe in the future there will be ways of doing this more cost-effectively
[12:52.250 --> 12:56.610]  But you know here again this goes back to trying to answer some of the most important things
[12:57.050 --> 12:59.610]  For the future of all humanity is how do we get?
[13:00.490 --> 13:05.770]  nutrient dense foods and so that goes back to having you know a really
[13:06.290 --> 13:10.050]  Biologically diverse and rich system that allows these geo
[13:10.690 --> 13:11.850]  bio
[13:11.850 --> 13:13.850]  chemical reactions to occur
[13:15.010 --> 13:19.050]  Producing secondary tertiary, etc. Metabolites that are allowed
[13:19.650 --> 13:21.650]  The plant to
[13:21.730 --> 13:25.850]  Absorb those nutrients that we so desperately need to get back into our food chain
[13:26.810 --> 13:31.690]  So I thought that was really cool. And again understanding that these are in
[13:32.330 --> 13:34.330]  obviously no till
[13:34.570 --> 13:41.050]  Circumstances, so if you're tilling you're destroying your mycorrhizae network and you're never going to really get that
[13:41.930 --> 13:46.410]  Potential or a plant potential or benefit from from the Association?
[13:47.410 --> 13:49.090]  So
[13:49.090 --> 13:56.290]  back to glomulans, so we know it's on the inside and the outside of the filament called the hyphy of
[13:58.130 --> 14:00.130]  The mycorrhizae the am
[14:01.010 --> 14:03.010]  We also know that
[14:04.130 --> 14:09.570]  Bacteria can penetrate or is sometimes allowed to penetrate that that hyphy
[14:10.210 --> 14:14.770]  So from the outside to the inside or vice versa similar to endophytes
[14:15.490 --> 14:17.490]  Or endo end of Phidic
[14:19.650 --> 14:26.850]  Endophytic back to a biology so they're there again, these are very very complex processes that we're just starting to learn so
[14:27.570 --> 14:33.650]  Who's in charge of glomulon production? Is it the is it the relationship between the fungi and the bacteria?
[14:34.050 --> 14:36.450]  I would tend to say probably
[14:38.330 --> 14:40.410]  Can one happen without the other I
[14:41.290 --> 14:45.770]  Don't know the answer to that and I don't think science has the answer to that
[14:46.770 --> 14:49.450]  But obviously like earlier stated
[14:51.090 --> 14:55.450]  Inside the spore is there no whole nother world that we have yet to
[14:56.570 --> 15:04.330]  Begin to explore because we just don't have the technology or tools to do it. So obviously there's some some pretty complex
[15:05.490 --> 15:07.490]  relationships that we
[15:08.170 --> 15:12.250]  May never be able to explain hopefully hopefully at some point in time
[15:12.250 --> 15:16.530]  But if it's not too late that we do get to a point where we can
[15:16.970 --> 15:22.490]  really understand more about those processes and I truly believe that that'll go back to
[15:24.130 --> 15:28.810]  Interdisciplinary science not not reductionist science when when groups of
[15:29.490 --> 15:34.530]  Individuals come together. I think that that will be the the thing that turns this
[15:35.370 --> 15:37.370]  these mysteries around
[15:37.490 --> 15:40.490]  Lots of a lot more so than just reductionist approaches
[15:41.290 --> 15:42.570]  so
[15:42.570 --> 15:47.970]  That being said we have this compound. It's very complex compound that is
[15:48.570 --> 15:53.250]  a huge benefit to the relationship between plants and soil
[15:54.090 --> 15:56.090]  and is absent in
[15:57.330 --> 15:59.410]  present-day agriculture for the most part and
[15:59.890 --> 16:05.590]  Even if you know, there's a big push out here in in SoCal because it's such so heavy ag
[16:06.270 --> 16:12.510]  Industry in this area to introduce my car I see to field crops, but I think that
[16:13.190 --> 16:20.510]  The push to sell products is greater than the understanding or realization of these products. In other words the farmer
[16:21.030 --> 16:25.430]  You tell him hey you sprayed this my car. I see you're gonna get a 30% increase in you know, blah blah blah
[16:25.430 --> 16:26.190]  That's water
[16:26.190 --> 16:27.270]  It's all true
[16:27.270 --> 16:32.670]  but then they till the field and you've got to use it again and the other side of that coin is that
[16:32.950 --> 16:36.110]  We know it takes pretty much 90 days
[16:37.190 --> 16:43.310]  for a complete association to occur, so that's the association of the penetration into the root and
[16:44.110 --> 16:47.310]  Then the filaments go out and they start collecting
[16:48.750 --> 16:55.390]  The nutrients that they dissolved with their acids and the food that's provided to them from the plant in the form of exudate
[16:55.390 --> 16:57.310]  So again, this is bio
[16:58.350 --> 17:00.750]  Geochemical processes so very complex
[17:01.750 --> 17:09.350]  And so for the most part, yeah, there's a lot of these ag companies are starting to introduce
[17:09.910 --> 17:11.910]  my car I see products into
[17:12.750 --> 17:16.270]  You know regular agriculture, which is which is good
[17:16.270 --> 17:24.110]  but I just I think that they missed the point that you've really got to push beyond just introducing biology or
[17:24.150 --> 17:29.390]  Organisms into the soil you've got to change the practice of tillage and that's going to be a
[17:29.910 --> 17:33.670]  bit more complex because the ag is is
[17:34.190 --> 17:36.190]  in order for a company to
[17:36.710 --> 17:39.750]  Be successful. They obviously have to make a profit and
[17:40.310 --> 17:47.350]  So when you look at no till practices and the small margins that these farmers have to make a profit
[17:47.670 --> 17:51.790]  it's very difficult to tell them to leave their field field to follow or to
[17:52.310 --> 17:56.070]  Put in a cover crop and wait three months and then
[17:57.950 --> 18:02.470]  Roll it or crimp it and use that plant residue as a
[18:03.230 --> 18:05.230]  organic mulch and or
[18:05.950 --> 18:10.470]  Allow the the soil underneath to continue functioning
[18:11.390 --> 18:15.750]  Got a highly biological level. They just they're just not going to probably do that
[18:16.750 --> 18:18.350]  so
[18:18.350 --> 18:20.350]  the chances of
[18:20.870 --> 18:22.870]  The chances of
[18:23.350 --> 18:27.790]  Traditional ag to ever get to the point where we go back to nutrient-dense foods
[18:28.190 --> 18:31.870]  the value of those foods would have to increase to the point where
[18:34.070 --> 18:36.070]  Those farmers could
[18:36.110 --> 18:39.390]  Have these types of practices where they're not
[18:39.910 --> 18:47.150]  Pushing that soil that dirt to just never-ending production of one plant after another after another after another
[18:47.910 --> 18:49.190]  so
[18:49.190 --> 18:54.670]  again, you know, I'm going off topic a little bit, but I want you to understand that the
[18:55.830 --> 19:02.230]  value of this particular compound in soils because again it creates this aggregation
[19:02.870 --> 19:06.910]  It creates gas exchange. It creates water holding capacity
[19:07.750 --> 19:13.750]  But that's where the magic comes in again. It's it's what's happening inside that aggregate
[19:14.550 --> 19:20.510]  You're dealing with a whole nother universe of interactions between all of these microbes
[19:21.230 --> 19:26.270]  Not just the bacteria and the fungi but the bacteria of fun that protozoa nematodes, etc
[19:27.110 --> 19:33.110]  You know another comparison that might be beneficial to you the audience is the understanding of worms
[19:33.870 --> 19:35.870]  worms in many way
[19:36.110 --> 19:37.670]  excrete a
[19:37.670 --> 19:40.550]  Substance a glue that's that's similar to glomulon
[19:41.390 --> 19:48.710]  That helps bond the particles together and and a prime example of that is the worm cast the casting itself is
[19:49.070 --> 19:50.190]  a
[19:50.190 --> 19:52.190]  microaggregate and that
[19:52.590 --> 19:54.710]  microaggregate can form into a
[19:55.870 --> 20:00.670]  Macroaggregate very quickly because it's already got some surface area for other
[20:01.750 --> 20:09.590]  microbes to colonize and biofilm and expand expand expand and that's you know, just part of of this
[20:11.110 --> 20:15.350]  Combination or symphony of all of the organisms working together
[20:16.670 --> 20:18.670]  another interesting
[20:20.590 --> 20:24.110]  Component of glomulon is its ability to uptake metals
[20:24.430 --> 20:29.790]  so we know that there's I think somewhere between a
[20:30.230 --> 20:34.750]  Few and as high as 10 to 11 percent
[20:35.590 --> 20:36.830]  iron
[20:36.870 --> 20:44.030]  In glomulon and now there's also other metals and this also brings in a more complex conversation about
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.550]  mycorrhizae am
[20:48.350 --> 20:49.870]  harvesting
[20:49.870 --> 20:52.270]  toxins heavy metals from soil and
[20:52.830 --> 20:54.830]  tying them up
[20:55.150 --> 20:59.110]  But if you have a dynamic accumulator like a cannabis plant
[20:59.750 --> 21:01.750]  the potential for that
[21:02.190 --> 21:08.710]  Cannabis plant to pull up all of these tiny little pieces of metal that have been bonded together
[21:08.910 --> 21:12.230]  By the mycorrhizae in the form of glomulon
[21:13.390 --> 21:19.430]  Could potentially have some some risks or some cross contamination that could occur
[21:20.230 --> 21:26.590]  but back to the point that it is believed that the iron is what helps this
[21:27.590 --> 21:33.510]  Glue to bond and be both heat resistant and water resistant at a very high level
[21:34.270 --> 21:36.270]  and also it's it's
[21:36.870 --> 21:42.550]  interesting to think of it as like say structure, so we all know if you have a
[21:44.030 --> 21:49.470]  Chasm and if you had a giant iron beam you could slide that beam out over that
[21:49.950 --> 21:55.430]  Cavern till it got to the other side where it would now hold weight and so
[21:55.950 --> 21:59.950]  when looking at the ability of mycorrhizae am
[22:00.470 --> 22:02.390]  specifically to
[22:02.390 --> 22:04.950]  Grow out or traverse an aggregate
[22:05.470 --> 22:09.190]  There's pore space in there so that that mycorrhizae has to grow
[22:09.830 --> 22:17.350]  across that chasm so that iron may be the critical component that allows it to
[22:19.470 --> 22:23.950]  Defy gravity for lack of better words and and span to you know
[22:24.510 --> 22:26.510]  two banks
[22:26.550 --> 22:28.990]  inside a very microscopic world
[22:30.430 --> 22:34.390]  So as you can see this is this is not an easy subject
[22:35.470 --> 22:37.350]  Yeah, exactly
[22:37.350 --> 22:43.510]  It's really complex. And again, we we're just starting down the understanding of
[22:44.030 --> 22:47.110]  these interactions these you know geo
[22:47.870 --> 22:49.870]  Biological chemical
[22:50.750 --> 22:58.070]  Interactions that are are causing these kinds of things to happen and these interactions are only occurring with AMF
[22:58.310 --> 23:00.430]  Right. Um, no, I mean
[23:00.950 --> 23:02.350]  so
[23:02.350 --> 23:04.350]  Glomlin can be made from other
[23:04.430 --> 23:07.190]  Well back to the conversation last week, right?
[23:08.270 --> 23:10.030]  the rhizosphere
[23:10.030 --> 23:12.030]  rhizosphere could be as
[23:12.070 --> 23:18.790]  Great as the amount of moisture being held in the soil or as small as just a slimy coating on the root itself
[23:19.510 --> 23:24.110]  right, so that interaction between the bacteria
[23:24.910 --> 23:31.430]  Penetrating the outer wall of the fungi and interacting with the cytoplasm on the inside
[23:32.390 --> 23:36.030]  You know, that's again. It's it's really fucking complex
[23:36.830 --> 23:38.830]  so
[23:38.910 --> 23:44.910]  Back to the question, where's where's the plan and in the soil begin? Where does the where's the fungi?
[23:45.950 --> 23:47.950]  stand alone and I
[23:48.910 --> 23:54.910]  Don't think we can have an answer to that. I mean, we know it has to have us it has to have a host plant
[23:55.150 --> 23:57.110]  We know that for a fact
[23:57.110 --> 24:01.590]  But once that host plant and the fungi start to interact
[24:02.310 --> 24:09.830]  Who's to say what's happening with the cytoplasm on the inside or the biofilm on the outside again that
[24:10.830 --> 24:15.710]  Fungi has to have its own rhizosphere. I mean we've seen that in films showing
[24:16.590 --> 24:22.350]  Biology traveling back and forth on the outside of that filament, right?
[24:22.350 --> 24:25.710]  So, you know again this gets super complex
[24:25.710 --> 24:30.870]  but for the lack of a better understanding on a layman's terms is that
[24:31.590 --> 24:34.870]  Glomlin has this incredible ability to bond
[24:35.430 --> 24:41.750]  soil particulate together to create micro and macro aggregates, which is the key to a
[24:42.710 --> 24:45.230]  successful plant soil interaction
[24:45.790 --> 24:48.350]  You can't have one without the other you just can't
[24:49.070 --> 24:55.950]  And that's like that is the utopia that's being built right? Is that do you feel like that's the right kind of yeah
[24:55.950 --> 25:02.470]  Eyes on this is that I mean go back a thousand years when we had, you know, incredible diversity
[25:03.150 --> 25:04.630]  and
[25:04.630 --> 25:06.990]  interactions between plants and animals and humans
[25:08.470 --> 25:14.110]  You know, that's that's why the Garden of Eden was here was because of these
[25:14.870 --> 25:16.590]  very complex
[25:16.590 --> 25:20.550]  again, geo bio chemical reactions that were occurring
[25:21.510 --> 25:25.310]  That allowed the evolution of all things on this planet
[25:26.350 --> 25:31.750]  So the storing of carbon is basically mother nature's way of like, all right, everybody's rich now
[25:31.750 --> 25:33.870]  They like the the superhighways built
[25:34.350 --> 25:41.790]  We're storing things or continuing to branch out. We're going deeper. That was something that dr. Elaine Ingham had mentioned that
[25:42.390 --> 25:50.190]  You know before we mess with the old growth forests those those trees would go down so deep obviously mirroring one another
[25:50.790 --> 25:54.870]  But nowadays with any kind of conventional things that's being sprayed
[25:55.710 --> 26:02.190]  She had said that maybe the the roots go down a couple of feet at best and then branch out because of how polluted how
[26:03.310 --> 26:06.590]  Like impaction and all that kind of stuff that's created over the years
[26:07.950 --> 26:14.430]  Compaction. Yeah, so when this compaction happens, that's actually the way that mother nature combats that stuff from what I understand
[26:14.430 --> 26:18.230]  Is that it's using the glomlin. It's using the mycorrhizal fungi
[26:19.030 --> 26:22.070]  specifically the AMF to start to create that
[26:22.590 --> 26:28.030]  Wonder that magic again, like you had mentioned like and it really does seem like magic because once everything is created
[26:28.550 --> 26:35.430]  Dr. Laney have talked about how it's really hard for disease and pests to really infect anything because it's such a superhighway
[26:35.430 --> 26:37.430]  Everything is moving. Everybody's
[26:37.950 --> 26:42.670]  Feeling great and with a little money in their pocket that is really hard for the bad
[26:43.470 --> 26:47.670]  Bad world if you will to be able to even notice what's going on because there's just so much
[26:47.790 --> 26:51.710]  Good microbes working in a symbiotic relationship. Is that a fair assessment?
[26:54.430 --> 26:56.430]  I think I think it's more complex
[26:58.430 --> 27:00.430]  Studies have shown that
[27:00.670 --> 27:03.590]  You know some of these fungi can actually be pathogenic
[27:04.670 --> 27:08.350]  in numbers and so, you know if the plant
[27:10.350 --> 27:14.470]  Associates with this mycorrhizae and the mycorrhizae goes out
[27:14.590 --> 27:20.070]  Or fuel or the mycorrhizae fueled by the exudates from the plant
[27:20.070 --> 27:26.790]  So that could be up to 20% of the photosynthesis that happened the energy that was created by the plant
[27:27.790 --> 27:31.750]  To go out and explore and grow out and harvest nutrients
[27:31.750 --> 27:36.750]  Well, if that mycorrhizae gets to a point where it can't find what the plant wants
[27:38.030 --> 27:42.870]  It's now pathogenic. It's now using the plant to produce nutrients
[27:42.870 --> 27:44.870]  It's now using the plant's energy
[27:46.390 --> 27:50.270]  To continue to grow its own biomass
[27:51.350 --> 27:53.350]  With no return to the plant
[27:53.830 --> 27:58.310]  so that's pathogenic and so that happens a lot in nature and
[27:59.190 --> 28:05.270]  you get into the discussion of like fusarium fusarium in the
[28:06.750 --> 28:08.750]  highly saprobe
[28:08.790 --> 28:10.190]  Saprobe
[28:10.190 --> 28:15.790]  Environment can actually reverse and become a saprobe and start feeding back other
[28:16.750 --> 28:19.950]  parts of the soil feb soil food web nutrients
[28:20.550 --> 28:23.430]  So, you know again, it's just a very very
[28:24.230 --> 28:26.230]  complex and delicate
[28:27.750 --> 28:29.750]  Arrangement that's happening and
[28:30.750 --> 28:37.630]  So to say you just can't be you can't be more open-minded or we need to be open
[28:37.710 --> 28:44.310]  Really open-minded about how complex this subject is and not try to reduce it or narrow it to one scenario
[28:44.550 --> 28:47.430]  Because as we all know there's exceptions to all the rules
[28:48.350 --> 28:50.350]  in nature and outside of each
[28:50.990 --> 28:52.070]  so
[28:52.070 --> 28:55.070]  in a living soil system, let's say all
[28:56.190 --> 28:59.990]  Conditions are ideal. How long would it take for all of this to occur?
[29:00.550 --> 29:03.070]  Are we talking years? Does this start off after?
[29:03.830 --> 29:06.270]  if if you look at a
[29:07.030 --> 29:13.670]  Decimated site Mount St. Helens, right? She blew up man. She took out half the mountain
[29:14.510 --> 29:20.310]  How long did it take for that site to recover to the health that it has now?
[29:21.270 --> 29:23.790]  yeah, it was years brother and and
[29:24.590 --> 29:28.510]  even now you couldn't go there and say that
[29:29.030 --> 29:34.790]  It was exactly the same way as it was before the eruption
[29:35.590 --> 29:37.590]  So again, it's like
[29:39.630 --> 29:42.790]  Where does it start and where does it end and I don't think that
[29:43.510 --> 29:49.470]  There I think this is more like a figure eight dude. It's not a line. It doesn't start an end
[29:49.750 --> 29:53.870]  It's interwoven and and where the eight comes together
[29:54.510 --> 29:57.110]  You have a cycle on the left and a cycle on the right
[29:57.110 --> 30:01.670]  But you also can change cycles that you can go to the yin or the yang of it
[30:02.310 --> 30:08.910]  So it's it dude, you know, I told you man I told you this was fucking gonna be a hard conversation to have
[30:09.590 --> 30:12.910]  well, I again I want the audience to know like nobody really wanted to
[30:13.550 --> 30:18.350]  Speak on this in a manner of where they would have to answer questions or speak on it like how you are today
[30:18.550 --> 30:21.030]  There's so much unknown. So I
[30:22.070 --> 30:26.190]  Mean, I know we don't really understand anything from a soil scientist point of view
[30:26.190 --> 30:30.790]  But 1996 seems pretty new just to hey, by the way
[30:30.790 --> 30:35.710]  There's all this other world that we just kind of figured out and that's what I think is really cool
[30:35.830 --> 30:36.430]  You know
[30:36.430 --> 30:40.550]  maybe I didn't understand when I was younger about how important the rainforest is and that you know,
[30:40.550 --> 30:43.630]  There's probably a variety of things out there that we don't even know about
[30:45.230 --> 30:47.230]  So
[30:47.350 --> 30:49.830]  You know, that's the interesting thing is that I
[30:50.430 --> 30:55.630]  And Afrin can talk on this. I think we have we have we believe
[30:56.470 --> 30:58.470]  That we have identified
[30:59.030 --> 31:01.030]  about 5% of
[31:01.550 --> 31:02.710]  the
[31:02.710 --> 31:09.590]  Fungal species on the planet. Wow, but the interesting thing is as we discover more
[31:10.750 --> 31:16.830]  We're realizing that that's actually a lower percentage because there's a lot of them that we haven't even discovered yet
[31:17.310 --> 31:19.870]  So again, where where where where do we?
[31:20.350 --> 31:27.390]  How can we make such grand claims when we know so little and you know that goes back into bro science and
[31:27.430 --> 31:34.030]  Greg bitch slapped me hard this morning. He gave me a cho slap because he's like basically look, you know
[31:35.910 --> 31:37.110]  We
[31:37.110 --> 31:39.830]  Cannot be so narrow-minded
[31:40.350 --> 31:44.830]  To think that that this one interaction is causing everything
[31:45.350 --> 31:50.630]  It is it's it's it's so fucking complex that you know, you take one
[31:51.150 --> 31:55.590]  One component you take the fish out of the river you take the deer out of the forest
[31:55.990 --> 32:01.790]  you've changed everything because now, you know that fish isn't eating the aquatic plants or other fish and
[32:02.550 --> 32:06.230]  Releasing nutrients that are available to the plants and vice versa
[32:06.230 --> 32:11.270]  The deer is not eating the leaves and pooping and leaving that behind for the microbes. So
[32:12.270 --> 32:14.430]  Pulling one thing out in a reductionist
[32:16.310 --> 32:18.310]  Traditional approach
[32:18.710 --> 32:20.110]  You've changed everything else
[32:20.110 --> 32:26.190]  I love the saying by observing you've changed it and and it's kind of fucked up to think about like
[32:26.270 --> 32:32.510]  You walk out into nature and just the fact that your presence you have changed the environment
[32:32.510 --> 32:37.430]  You've changed everything some of the animals have scurried away. You've compacted the soil underneath your foot
[32:38.110 --> 32:43.950]  Just you breathing the air and stealing the oxygen out of that environment and changing it
[32:44.990 --> 32:46.030]  so
[32:46.030 --> 32:52.270]  Again, that's the way you really need to approach conversations like this where we know so little that
[32:53.070 --> 32:59.150]  Don't try to reduce anything try to look at try to look zoom out and look at the big picture, right?
[32:59.550 --> 33:01.550]  and and then
[33:01.830 --> 33:06.990]  Go back at it with the approach or understanding that all these tiny little
[33:07.270 --> 33:11.630]  Interactions are adding up to all of these big big things that are happening
[33:12.710 --> 33:17.870]  So yeah, it's this is a deep one dude that carbon carbon rabbit holes even fucking deeper
[33:19.990 --> 33:25.510]  It's just pretty interesting how you know, once everything is stabilized everything's alive
[33:25.510 --> 33:30.550]  It's kind of like I guess anything in nature now it needs to store things squirrel away
[33:30.550 --> 33:33.150]  You know nuts for in case for a hard winter
[33:33.590 --> 33:39.750]  and the the plant even at the soil level seems to be doing that and then when I started to learn more about like I
[33:40.430 --> 33:44.550]  guess for a lack of a better terms considered like the old growth forest and how
[33:44.950 --> 33:46.510]  Everything is put, you know
[33:46.510 --> 33:51.630]  All the energy especially in weeds is put at the top of the soil and then as things progress
[33:51.870 --> 33:56.710]  later down the line, especially when you get to the older forest the variety are the
[33:57.110 --> 33:58.670]  most of the
[33:58.670 --> 34:03.470]  The photosynthes energy that's coming down is going down to create a variety of different
[34:04.310 --> 34:07.070]  exudates for that soil system, so
[34:08.230 --> 34:12.110]  We as cannabis farmers. I feel like this is kind of that extra little
[34:12.750 --> 34:18.030]  secret sauce or things that we can look forward to by putting in the time and effort in creating these
[34:18.350 --> 34:25.790]  Soil systems in our basements tents, maybe even a larger commercial facility knowing that our end goal is to create these little
[34:26.550 --> 34:31.470]  Extra super highways where we're now we're even storing carbon where we're you know
[34:31.590 --> 34:35.830]  Creating enough currency that seems like everything is alive and thriving and then when those
[34:36.870 --> 34:39.830]  indoor facilities seem to take off it does
[34:40.510 --> 34:45.710]  Somewhat feel like a rainforest if you will everything is very lush in there. So
[34:46.470 --> 34:54.030]  Is this next level thinking for the newer farmer that might just have got into this does maybe even start researching this and then for the
[34:54.030 --> 35:00.990]  Advanced farmer we all need to start researching this as a group to try to understand how these things are be in mind
[35:00.990 --> 35:06.110]  how these things are being shipped around that soil system because that does seem like the
[35:06.550 --> 35:08.790]  the caveat the aha moment of
[35:09.390 --> 35:16.030]  Becoming a living soil farmers getting more of that fungal aspect and for a long time. It seemed like everybody just pitched the
[35:16.670 --> 35:18.670]  bacterial aspect
[35:19.190 --> 35:21.190]  Agreed right agreed
[35:21.270 --> 35:23.590]  Yeah, I truly believe that again
[35:24.950 --> 35:26.830]  buyer beware
[35:26.830 --> 35:31.550]  If you are going to take the no-till living soils approach
[35:32.350 --> 35:39.870]  Make sure that you are getting products that actually have value to them. I have tested. I don't know how many different
[35:40.790 --> 35:42.790]  my Karazi project products
[35:43.150 --> 35:47.990]  out of pocket just because I wanted to know if they were value or they had value or
[35:48.230 --> 35:51.870]  Because people were hitting me up and saying hey, you know, I want to use this product
[35:51.870 --> 35:58.030]  But it doesn't work or how beneficial is it and I would send it off to a friend say hey do a sport count
[35:58.030 --> 36:00.510]  and one of the really interesting things is
[36:02.190 --> 36:05.630]  There's a company out of Mexico producing a my Karazi
[36:06.670 --> 36:08.350]  that is
[36:08.350 --> 36:12.190]  Basically being treated as if it's like the coca-cola formula
[36:13.190 --> 36:19.350]  This guy found these this particular or I think it's for four species
[36:19.350 --> 36:25.990]  I believe it was in Afghanistan or Pakistan some really really fucking arid dry nasty place
[36:26.950 --> 36:31.470]  And has colonized them and I don't know if they're in vivo or in vitro
[36:32.110 --> 36:36.750]  But I sent the product off to Efren and he came back and said there's no spores in
[36:37.430 --> 36:40.510]  I'm like, what are you talking about? He goes? No, there's no spores in I go
[36:41.510 --> 36:47.550]  What do you mean and he's like well the spores that I found appear to be more like a
[36:49.190 --> 36:51.190]  Yeast spore so they're very small
[36:51.190 --> 36:57.430]  They're under 20 microns and he goes am is is generally 60 to 80 microns
[36:57.430 --> 37:02.950]  So I have to throw this out and say that that's not a my Karazi spore
[37:02.950 --> 37:07.630]  that's another type of spore from something else whether it's a saparovic yeast or
[37:08.590 --> 37:09.870]  You know
[37:09.870 --> 37:11.870]  slime mold or something else a
[37:12.550 --> 37:17.630]  Mold, excuse me. Not a slime old slime molds or a whole fucking other ball game. That's they're like those
[37:19.470 --> 37:20.910]  Lichen
[37:20.910 --> 37:23.430]  lichen is a combination of three organisms
[37:24.630 --> 37:30.270]  Bacteria bacteria fungi fungi yeast bacteria really fucking complex interactions
[37:31.550 --> 37:35.510]  so back to the to the point at hand is that
[37:36.070 --> 37:38.070]  You know
[37:38.150 --> 37:44.830]  For for the for the farmer who has decided that I want to go with a living no-till system
[37:45.590 --> 37:51.430]  I need products that that actually work. Oh, and I'm sorry. I didn't make the point on this on this fun guy
[37:52.390 --> 37:55.830]  Apparently the gentleman that sold that to me or gave it to me to test
[37:56.870 --> 38:01.350]  Has said that he's had incredible plant reactions and strawberries raspberries and blueberries
[38:01.390 --> 38:08.790]  Raspberries and blueberries which blueberries are weird because they're they don't associate with my Karazi they associate with
[38:11.950 --> 38:17.590]  Iroquois Iroquois fungi which is a whole nother subject that we haven't even begun to
[38:18.310 --> 38:24.310]  Broach or very little is being done on it similar to similar to global. There's just not enough people studying it
[38:24.310 --> 38:26.310]  It just doesn't seem to be a demand
[38:26.430 --> 38:28.430]  but needless to say
[38:28.550 --> 38:33.990]  And I haven't had that conversation with Efren yet about you know this interaction because I'm going to go harvest
[38:34.950 --> 38:40.390]  Some roots from one of his side-by-side trials and send those to Efren and have him
[38:42.110 --> 38:46.430]  Die them and see if there is some kind of interaction that
[38:47.110 --> 38:50.730]  Maybe he's overlooked. Maybe this is a new type of fungi
[38:51.590 --> 38:53.910]  Am that had yet to be discovered
[38:54.670 --> 38:56.230]  so
[38:56.230 --> 38:58.230]  you know
[38:58.430 --> 39:01.550]  There's still a lot we need to learn we need to really
[39:03.270 --> 39:09.190]  Put our backs into this and I think that as a community the cannabis community should and
[39:09.830 --> 39:13.390]  needs to get a closer relationship with
[39:15.870 --> 39:20.270]  The academia world so that some of the stuff can be documented
[39:20.950 --> 39:27.990]  You know that that's been a point of contention with with me at the all the region conferences
[39:28.030 --> 39:35.590]  I was like you you farmers have got to start working with academia to start documenting the value of this and you know
[39:36.150 --> 39:44.070]  The problem is there's so little follow-through like you know yeah, I'm gonna send this plant off to be tested for
[39:45.070 --> 39:46.510]  cannabinoids
[39:46.510 --> 39:49.950]  Levels heavy metals and pesticides right well
[39:50.630 --> 39:57.950]  It costs so much to do that that you can't sit there and test every chemo bar or chemotoxins or cultivars
[39:58.550 --> 40:00.550]  to see the interactions between
[40:00.950 --> 40:05.510]  Just the plant and the soil let alone the plant the soil the microbes and everything else
[40:05.510 --> 40:12.310]  I mean, it's it's it's a challenge to say the least so where does that money come from who who puts up the money to?
[40:12.310 --> 40:19.230]  Do these expensive testing and again broad scale testing not just cannabinoid production?
[40:19.910 --> 40:22.430]  but the plant interactions and
[40:23.230 --> 40:29.710]  Colonization you know soil food web all of these things as well as the soil chemistry because again, it's geochemical
[40:30.870 --> 40:38.510]  Biological processes that are creating and it goes back to the soil horizons the horizon system if you don't have sand silt and clay in your
[40:39.150 --> 40:44.350]  Soil then how do you think you possibly could hit the potential of that genetic?
[40:45.030 --> 40:48.150]  And if you if you have all those things and you don't have biology
[40:48.190 --> 40:53.630]  How do you think you're gonna have the potential of that genetic expression you can't
[40:53.990 --> 40:58.110]  So you really need all of these things to be in play?
[40:58.750 --> 41:04.790]  So that you can let the genetic potential of this plant or any plant for that matter
[41:04.910 --> 41:12.590]  To be expressed and that goes back to whether it's cannabinoid productions or nutrients and vitamins and minerals in in what we consume
[41:13.590 --> 41:18.550]  And for you guys out there that want to see what Layton's talking about there's a few
[41:19.430 --> 41:25.910]  Glomlin quick YouTube videos where they're showing basically that sand is now being glued together
[41:26.830 --> 41:34.230]  Pretty interesting to see they're holding it down and who knows how long that that took but this is the part that I feel I
[41:35.270 --> 41:42.090]  Don't I mean I guess people would talk about this. They would talk about glomlin a few years ago people would say yeah
[41:42.090 --> 41:44.090]  That's a it's a good thing. But no one really
[41:44.770 --> 41:50.370]  ever tried to explain this to each other and again Layton, I appreciate you man because it
[41:51.210 --> 41:56.650]  It seems like this is the extra factories that we want. So we've been talking about the soil food web for a long time
[41:56.730 --> 42:01.290]  Well, this is that next level. So when the soil food web is built and it's alive
[42:01.290 --> 42:04.730]  It's a thriving now now is the time to figure that out
[42:05.290 --> 42:10.610]  From a fungal aspect. So do you feel like if you're you're a cannabis farmer?
[42:10.610 --> 42:15.410]  You really want to do this on your own then going out into Mother Nature. You can find I
[42:16.170 --> 42:20.610]  Always called it. I always heard it as AMF, but you've been just saying a.m. So a.m.
[42:20.610 --> 42:24.370]  Fungi, is that an easy thing to get from Mother Nature?
[42:25.450 --> 42:26.570]  so
[42:26.570 --> 42:28.570]  If you're in nature
[42:29.130 --> 42:32.770]  Those spores can travel by air or water
[42:34.170 --> 42:39.790]  That's how they traverse the planet now take it to the next level they can travel on bugs
[42:40.610 --> 42:42.610]  They can travel on animals
[42:42.850 --> 42:48.810]  so when we goes back to when we had our mass expansion and
[42:49.690 --> 42:52.390]  We no longer have mass migrations
[42:53.330 --> 42:55.670]  the ability for those spores to
[42:56.250 --> 42:58.250]  Continue to spread
[42:58.290 --> 43:07.210]  Is greatly reduced so can you get it out of nature? Yeah, that's it's the same concept of it as an IMO collection
[43:07.770 --> 43:14.370]  Is there gonna be my car I see in an IMO collection, I'm sure there is gonna be some but again like the
[43:16.050 --> 43:21.450]  Latest and greatest information on my car I see is that it can be parasitic
[43:21.810 --> 43:24.930]  It can do nothing or it can be beneficial
[43:25.890 --> 43:32.610]  As long as you have the right type and again, we know what 5% at best
[43:33.090 --> 43:37.250]  Show how many types do you really need and and how many?
[43:38.770 --> 43:40.050]  Potential
[43:40.050 --> 43:46.890]  Beneficials are you gonna get and that's where you know companies like by our Addis have have spent years
[43:47.690 --> 43:49.530]  working on developing
[43:49.530 --> 43:51.530]  ways to
[43:52.530 --> 43:54.530]  Produce these types of products
[43:55.090 --> 44:00.610]  that are going to show a beneficial effect and not a parasitic effect and
[44:01.130 --> 44:03.130]  So if you go collect it in nature
[44:04.250 --> 44:06.010]  What are you collecting?
[44:06.010 --> 44:10.170]  Right, you could be potentially collect pathogens and dr
[44:10.170 --> 44:11.970]  Lane will talk a lot about this, you know
[44:11.970 --> 44:15.770]  and I tend to be a little bit more ballsy and in
[44:16.250 --> 44:22.570]  trusting the process and trusting mother nature that she's not gonna send me down the wrong rabbit hole and that gets back into
[44:23.170 --> 44:26.290]  spirituality and your connection with the earth and your soul and
[44:26.890 --> 44:28.210]  so
[44:28.210 --> 44:30.810]  It's again a super complex issue
[44:32.210 --> 44:34.210]  Some of them some of the most
[44:34.890 --> 44:37.210]  important work that I think that as a
[44:37.770 --> 44:44.370]  Farmer or a new grower or even an old grower that it's looking to up its game into this
[44:44.370 --> 44:46.370]  You know really super
[44:47.530 --> 44:49.530]  diverse
[44:49.530 --> 44:54.690]  Microbial living soil is the understanding that there is succession in soil
[44:54.690 --> 44:56.690]  And then there's succession in biology
[44:56.690 --> 45:02.290]  So this type of biology has to be present in order for the next succession to come in
[45:02.490 --> 45:04.890]  Does that mean the first succession is wiped out?
[45:05.410 --> 45:08.970]  Maybe in some cases sure and in other cases know that they remain
[45:09.690 --> 45:15.650]  Symbiotic and and they help each other mutual mutualistically move forward down that succession
[45:16.170 --> 45:21.050]  Toward that old growth forest and I know we go we use the old growth forest as as the example
[45:21.850 --> 45:23.050]  but
[45:23.410 --> 45:24.450]  But
[45:24.450 --> 45:31.050]  Maybe we should be looking more at trying to get somewhere in the middle based on the plant
[45:31.570 --> 45:33.570]  That we're trying to rear
[45:34.370 --> 45:36.370]  So the canvas plant in nature
[45:38.010 --> 45:43.130]  Often isn't seasonal it's you know, some of the old land-raised plants just keep growing
[45:43.410 --> 45:46.650]  They don't die in it, you know at the end of the season
[45:48.050 --> 45:50.210]  So it's more like a
[45:51.050 --> 45:52.570]  shrub
[45:52.570 --> 45:55.770]  or a small bush or tree
[45:56.370 --> 45:58.370]  then it is a
[45:58.530 --> 46:02.210]  seasonal plant now we we have
[46:03.930 --> 46:05.930]  Pushed it
[46:06.290 --> 46:14.210]  To a point where we through photo period we we get the flower and then we harvest and cure and dry
[46:14.530 --> 46:21.770]  Enjoy, but in nature it it didn't really work that way with with the original land-raised
[46:22.010 --> 46:27.290]  Canvas plants now. I'm not to say that there weren't cultivars that didn't die off every season. I'm not saying that
[46:27.970 --> 46:29.290]  But I'm telling you right now
[46:29.290 --> 46:31.290]  There were certain cultivars that didn't die
[46:31.370 --> 46:38.090]  Then continued to grow and go through the cycle go back to flower go back to veg go back to flower go back to veg
[46:38.690 --> 46:40.210]  so
[46:40.210 --> 46:43.570]  you know, I would say that if you were if
[46:44.250 --> 46:49.930]  You were smart you would take the approach that you want somewhere in the middle of succession
[46:50.210 --> 46:57.010]  Of the plant successional chart the sectional chart is basically brassicas
[46:58.410 --> 47:00.410]  You know water plants
[47:00.530 --> 47:05.770]  Are very very high bacteria and then the old growth forest is very very high fungal
[47:05.770 --> 47:11.490]  So you need to be somewhere in the middle there? And so if you're not employing, you know, or
[47:12.570 --> 47:19.450]  collecting and using sapro sapros decomposer fungi my car izi fungi yeast molds
[47:19.930 --> 47:24.770]  All of the host of different types of bacteria that you can, you know collect yourself
[47:25.610 --> 47:29.130]  Then you're potentially leaving out a piece of that
[47:31.250 --> 47:35.490]  Secret sauce that allows genetic potential to be expressed
[47:36.730 --> 47:39.210]  Can you get all of that from like old?
[47:40.210 --> 47:42.690]  Alaskan humus is that is that a
[47:44.370 --> 47:49.730]  So again, you got to think about this there are certain species of biology
[47:49.930 --> 47:53.450]  That are consistent around the globe
[47:54.210 --> 47:59.130]  But there are a lot that are very unique to that one area to that
[47:59.970 --> 48:01.730]  microclimate or
[48:01.730 --> 48:09.650]  Larger scale area. So, you know to say I'm gonna collect a micro from Alaska and put it in my indoor tent in
[48:10.450 --> 48:12.450]  You know, whatever wherever
[48:12.970 --> 48:17.730]  I may not survive. But again now you've provided a bio stimulant
[48:18.170 --> 48:21.010]  Which is another thing that you really need to think about is that
[48:22.250 --> 48:25.490]  That that that organism may not have colonized
[48:26.090 --> 48:29.970]  But that organism harvested something from somewhere else
[48:30.730 --> 48:34.850]  That probably has value in the pantry of another
[48:36.010 --> 48:37.650]  prokaryote or
[48:37.650 --> 48:43.290]  Bacteria or nematode so this goes back to all the way back to the beginning of bacteria
[48:43.930 --> 48:48.410]  Mines nutrients from sand silt and clay and organic matter and
[48:49.410 --> 48:51.410]  Stores them in its pantry
[48:51.570 --> 48:57.450]  So that if it runs into a situation where it's too hot too cold not enough water too much water
[48:58.010 --> 49:00.930]  pH swing it can pull out those
[49:01.730 --> 49:07.210]  Elements out of its pantry to shore up its shell or or go into cyst
[49:08.010 --> 49:10.010]  to survive that
[49:10.010 --> 49:11.930]  change so
[49:11.930 --> 49:16.690]  You know the benefit of pulling that microbe from Alaska and throwing it in your tent
[49:17.530 --> 49:22.530]  Probably has more to do with providing a level of nutrient
[49:23.330 --> 49:25.010]  mineral or
[49:25.010 --> 49:31.770]  Vitamin even a secondary tertiary metabolite that was not present in that soil system until you introduced it
[49:32.330 --> 49:34.330]  Does that make sense?
[49:34.770 --> 49:36.770]  Yeah, absolutely
[49:37.770 --> 49:43.370]  Yeah, this this is a fucking topic man, this is one fucking hell of a topic I mean people spent their whole lives
[49:44.370 --> 49:48.490]  researching just one tiny aspect of this in the reductionist approach and
[49:49.210 --> 49:55.330]  They could speak for hours of days weeks or months on on that. They're one aspect of it
[49:55.530 --> 50:00.810]  so to be sweeping with with brushstrokes this big is is
[50:01.370 --> 50:07.850]  You know really really challenging say the least but I think it's an important conversation to have because it expands
[50:08.090 --> 50:11.650]  your own thinking about what you're actually doing and
[50:12.210 --> 50:15.650]  Maybe you're being a reductionist when you need to be, you know more
[50:16.290 --> 50:23.490]  Interdisciplinary and and take into consideration the value of companion plants and banker plants and diverse
[50:24.250 --> 50:29.970]  Ecosystems and diversity in microbes. I mean working with this guy right now making
[50:30.690 --> 50:33.850]  Biological compost and I had to beat into his head
[50:33.850 --> 50:34.330]  I'm like look
[50:34.330 --> 50:41.810]  I want you to get a baggie of every different type of green plant you can find and then build a huge pile of it
[50:42.450 --> 50:45.650]  Right. That's a fucking challenge. Okay, what an asshole I am
[50:45.690 --> 50:51.290]  But I'm trying to prove a point that if you leave something out you're potentially
[50:52.050 --> 50:57.170]  Not putting something into play that very well be very valuable and
[50:58.210 --> 51:04.170]  So diversity diversity diversity and if if I can't beat that into everybody's head, it's hard enough
[51:04.450 --> 51:07.690]  I'm sorry, but that I think that is the key to
[51:08.410 --> 51:16.090]  full genetic expression or potential is is is through diversity and then then trusting the process that you've you've made your
[51:16.090 --> 51:18.410]  effort and again if you're if you are
[51:18.610 --> 51:20.610]  Very
[51:20.690 --> 51:25.450]  In tune with nature then she'll talk to you man. She'll fucking tell you. Oh, no. No, don't pick that
[51:26.330 --> 51:27.810]  pick this
[51:27.810 --> 51:34.810]  So, you know again, it's it's a heightened awareness that that you need to protect yourself from doing something stupid
[51:36.050 --> 51:41.730]  More often than not just sheer laziness is the is is the cause of a lot of problems
[51:42.690 --> 51:46.650]  When you're not putting your your best foot forward
[51:46.690 --> 51:51.530]  Yeah, I don't feel like watering a plant today. I don't feel like making compost or I don't feel like going
[51:51.530 --> 51:57.050]  You know five miles down the road to harvest this weird plant that I saw out of the corner of my eye
[51:57.570 --> 52:00.690]  Now, why did you see that? Is that your intuition telling you?
[52:01.330 --> 52:05.930]  Probably we as a species have lost touch with our intuition
[52:06.890 --> 52:11.690]  And that's what got us to the point where we basically took the fuck over
[52:11.730 --> 52:15.450]  I mean we we are on every fucking place on this planet
[52:15.650 --> 52:23.290]  There's a humans and there's human civilizations whether they're oil rigs whether they're you know research centers
[52:24.810 --> 52:29.170]  You know we got we were everywhere and and then even where we aren't we are
[52:29.610 --> 52:35.570]  Think about the fucking nuclear submarines that go underneath the ice shelves and pop up, right? So
[52:35.730 --> 52:40.090]  We've affected everything on so many levels and we have lost our our
[52:41.330 --> 52:43.330]  connection
[52:43.370 --> 52:45.370]  The ancient ways
[52:45.410 --> 52:52.930]  the use of herbs and medicine instead of chemical compounds derived from those fucking herbs, so
[52:54.050 --> 52:57.250]  You know, I think that's that is the that is the one
[52:57.930 --> 52:59.930]  takeaway that we need to make
[53:00.730 --> 53:03.970]  You know, I think that's that is the that is the one
[53:04.890 --> 53:07.210]  takeaway that I could give today is that
[53:07.730 --> 53:12.810]  You know learn to use your intuition and I'm sure all of you out there have had this happen where you
[53:12.970 --> 53:18.410]  You're walking out the door and you see something out of the corner of your eye and you don't know why you looked at it
[53:18.410 --> 53:23.650]  But then you left and you went about your day and all sudden you're like fuck if I had had that right now
[53:24.490 --> 53:26.250]  right
[53:26.290 --> 53:32.810]  Does that happen to you Brian? Yeah, I've definitely felt intuition before like in life and just
[53:34.450 --> 53:38.450]  Know in certain things that you need to like, you know, I almost feel like that's your
[53:41.290 --> 53:46.130]  May I don't want to go too deep in this because you know how people bit I do believe that there's something like that
[53:46.130 --> 53:49.690]  Kind of looks out for you because I've experienced that twice in my life
[53:49.690 --> 53:53.330]  Whether you believe that's a gardening angel or whatever your belief system is
[53:53.330 --> 53:56.770]  But it does feel that way and I it's always made me wonder if
[53:57.490 --> 54:03.930]  Intuition is whatever that thing is. That's being like hey, you know, like don't go down that alley or you know
[54:03.930 --> 54:07.410]  there's just little things in life that I've I felt like I've listened to that and I've
[54:07.810 --> 54:11.050]  You know still here today so that that worked out
[54:12.090 --> 54:13.890]  how do you I
[54:13.890 --> 54:16.130]  don't want to change the subject to Beck but
[54:16.890 --> 54:20.730]  Carbon is such an interesting thing to me, especially it seems like
[54:21.690 --> 54:25.490]  When things are being built up, why do you think mother nature?
[54:26.690 --> 54:29.890]  feels like she needs to store it so much because the
[54:30.370 --> 54:35.690]  Little basic veil that I understand of this stuff is the deeper you get into soil systems
[54:36.010 --> 54:39.690]  Carbon is where it's at. And then once that is start to be built. It seems like
[54:40.210 --> 54:48.450]  The overall health the immunity everything is is now next level and as the years go by things just improve so they level up
[54:49.250 --> 54:51.770]  Until you're like at a level 9 level 10 where
[54:52.690 --> 54:54.290]  farming is
[54:54.290 --> 55:00.130]  Easily managed and you know, that's where some of the older heads that we've even had on this show where they talk about, you know, they're
[55:00.730 --> 55:06.050]  They're farming a decent size square footage and there's maybe two or three people managing it
[55:06.530 --> 55:10.170]  Once you've gotten to that level, that's again where the profits come in
[55:10.170 --> 55:11.250]  So it's you know
[55:11.250 --> 55:13.930]  You probably spend a lot of money to get that the best of the best
[55:14.330 --> 55:17.890]  And then as the years go by you realize that these things are building up
[55:18.290 --> 55:19.850]  And then that was another question
[55:19.850 --> 55:21.970]  I wanted to reach out to you late and is so
[55:22.370 --> 55:26.210]  No till you're still disturbing a lot of that stuff when you're taking the plants out
[55:26.210 --> 55:29.730]  So, you know Steve Cantwell was talking about, you know
[55:29.730 --> 55:34.090]  He's using basically that soil system and then just using the pots and changing out the pots
[55:34.250 --> 55:39.010]  So technically he's not really disturbing that do you feel like maybe that's some of his
[55:39.770 --> 55:45.430]  Advantage over others because his stuff obviously is usually 10 out of 10 smells fantastic
[55:45.470 --> 55:47.790]  So, do you think he's getting more of this
[55:48.430 --> 55:54.230]  Glomelin and all these other things that you would get after a he's probably on his 27th 28th cycle
[55:54.550 --> 56:00.190]  Do you feel like that because he's not even disturbing it now like we had done before so he's taking it to the next level
[56:00.190 --> 56:02.230]  Where yeah, it was no till now
[56:02.230 --> 56:08.190]  It's you know, not touching anything and just removing the pots on top of that soil system. So it's not disturbed
[56:09.430 --> 56:13.110]  Is that I think yeah, I think you're spot-on and
[56:14.070 --> 56:16.070]  Again
[56:16.590 --> 56:18.590]  Carbon is in every living thing
[56:19.750 --> 56:21.750]  We all have a CDN ratio
[56:22.350 --> 56:24.350]  so
[56:24.470 --> 56:31.670]  Think about the fertility that occurs when an animal dies and
[56:33.190 --> 56:39.830]  Basically falls down or gets eaten but there's parts and pieces left all over the place that fertility
[56:40.470 --> 56:46.590]  Another like really complex one is is the understanding of again like
[56:47.870 --> 56:49.870]  buffaloes herds
[56:50.390 --> 56:56.070]  So these animals come in they eat they thrash they trash they poop they give birth
[56:57.110 --> 57:00.630]  The milk from the mother is spilled all over the place
[57:00.950 --> 57:06.430]  There's blood spilled all over the place because other predators come in and feed off them
[57:06.430 --> 57:08.950]  So it's really just a shit show of
[57:09.710 --> 57:14.270]  carbon and nitrogen being released into the environment and
[57:15.190 --> 57:22.230]  That's where you know this incredible diverse fertility comes from is that that cycle of nature that
[57:22.750 --> 57:24.750]  Infinity signal, you know
[57:26.030 --> 57:31.710]  Where is it at any one given point in time? Sometimes it's here. Sometimes it's over there. So
[57:31.830 --> 57:35.990]  You know trying to like, you know understand carbon as a
[57:36.750 --> 57:38.750]  cash or as a
[57:39.270 --> 57:41.030]  nutrient
[57:41.030 --> 57:43.030]  as a fertility
[57:43.230 --> 57:50.870]  Gets fucking super complex, dude. I mean we now know exudates are just another form of carbon, you know, we've always
[57:51.630 --> 57:57.390]  Traditionally looked at them as you know carbohydrates and sugars, but what's a carbohydrate and sugar?
[57:57.390 --> 57:59.230]  You know, and that's what we're talking about
[57:59.350 --> 58:06.190]  What's a carbohydrate and sugar, you know, and then it gets down into fucking proteins and and that's where shit gets really fucking crazy
[58:06.590 --> 58:11.590]  You know proteins fold and they do this another protein fold it does that so these these
[58:12.190 --> 58:15.310]  interactions get get really really complex and
[58:16.230 --> 58:21.150]  To a point where it's almost not predictable about what the outcome is gonna be
[58:21.150 --> 58:25.350]  I mean the prime example of that is a man and a woman get together
[58:25.390 --> 58:27.390]  Sperm and egg is exchanged
[58:28.150 --> 58:32.030]  Youth is born that the that is repeated
[58:32.910 --> 58:34.910]  and these two
[58:35.430 --> 58:37.430]  individuals that came
[58:37.430 --> 58:41.870]  Two different individuals that came from the two original individuals are radically different
[58:42.390 --> 58:47.830]  Well, how the fuck does that happen? Right because they came from the same basic genetic profile
[58:47.830 --> 58:53.870]  How is their expression so much different? I mean we had the old joke was all that that daughter
[58:53.870 --> 58:57.310]  That daughter or son definitely came from the milkman, right?
[58:57.790 --> 59:05.430]  Because they don't look anything like their brothers or sisters or they don't even have the similar, you know anything whether it's appearance or
[59:06.390 --> 59:08.390]  beliefs or
[59:10.510 --> 59:14.230]  Understandings knowledge lack of it so
[59:15.430 --> 59:21.470]  it gets really really complex and I think that if you look at carbon as one of the
[59:22.110 --> 59:24.110]  Most critical
[59:25.270 --> 59:30.190]  Components in everything like I said anything living has a C to N relation ratio
[59:30.750 --> 59:34.990]  Then that kind of makes it a little bit easier to understand
[59:36.590 --> 59:42.910]  The value of carbon so, you know carbon can come from a lot of different resources whether it's the roots
[59:44.310 --> 59:46.990]  whether it's the the bacteria or
[59:48.510 --> 59:50.510]  Protozoa
[59:50.870 --> 59:55.190]  You know, it's it's it's just it's it's very very
[59:56.230 --> 01:00:01.470]  important in in the function of an evolution of or succession of everything and
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.590]  I hope you answered that because that that was a hard one
[01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:10.630]  So from what I understand when the when the carbons being built up there's more
[01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.070]  glues being built the glomulin
[01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:18.830]  Again, what I understand is that it is produced pretty heavily when I own all conditions are correct
[01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:23.670]  And then as it is being produced heavily it becomes extremely tough
[01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:30.010]  So some of the analogies have been like if you're in in Florida and then you're constantly watering
[01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:35.590]  so there's a you know a tsunami every every other day or so because people are over watering that
[01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:42.910]  the end result on the the soil microbial level is that the bad guys exist because there's there's
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.910]  Turmoil going on within that utopia, right? So the the bad guys are going to emerge
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:53.010]  So that's why a lot of people at the beginning of this had a lot of issues
[01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:57.470]  Especially when they were over watering because the diet they were basically killing their diversity
[01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:04.190]  Killing a lot of that stuff off because they weren't allowing the diversity to take cold because they were continuing to over water
[01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:11.870]  Once the glomulin is there supposedly it's the the glues are so strong that even if you do over water
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.390]  You know a little bit obviously if you're constantly doing it would probably cause issues
[01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:24.890]  But when you do that, the diversity seems to be able to hold on when those soaks extra tsunamis come through and then once it passes
[01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:29.510]  By that's why that diversity is able to hold, you know take over again where the the bad
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:33.030]  The bad guys if you will aren't able to take cold
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:38.870]  So that's why that immunity is there now and all of the things that almost sound too good to be true
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.350]  It seems like it's being attributed to
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.270]  more of the glomulin and more of the
[01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:51.590]  Bacterial glues that the fungi now kind of takes hold things are starting to be built on a rapid basis and the overall health
[01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.470]  Improves quicker. Is that all fair?
[01:01:55.230 --> 01:02:00.530]  Yeah. Yeah, and I think you touched on something that we hadn't gotten to yet and that is
[01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.750]  the value of co2 in
[01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:07.030]  glomulin
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:10.230]  Production so the studies indicate that
[01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:13.070]  in a higher co2
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:18.990]  Environment that glomulin is easy easily or easier
[01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.950]  to produce by by
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.230]  the fungi and
[01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:26.230]  So what is co2?
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.310]  Carbon
[01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.310]  right
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.630]  So I think that you know
[01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.750]  Your analogy of the
[01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.590]  Tsunami is is a great one because in the beginning in this conversation
[01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:46.950]  We talked about the properties of glomulin and and its ability to form
[01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.830]  micro macro aggregates and then once those aggregates are built
[01:02:52.270 --> 01:03:00.190]  Its ability to maintain them without letting them collapse without letting them compact without letting them wash away
[01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.590]  Because it's water resistant so on the outside of that aggregate
[01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:07.310]  If there's too much water
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:11.950]  It won't let it in it'll let it in a certain amount and hold that amount
[01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:14.790]  but it gets to a point where it becomes waterlogged and
[01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:21.710]  No longer can water come in so it sheds but that aggregate doesn't fall apart. I mean that was one of the
[01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:28.430]  great way of testing soil is to take a handful of the soil and put it in water and
[01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:31.950]  Then pull it out and see how much of that
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:35.830]  material is now left in that glass of water if
[01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.710]  if it was a
[01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.830]  macro aggregate that had a tremendous amount of
[01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:47.190]  Glomulin in it. You could basically put it in and pull it out and the clump would be completely intact
[01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:53.350]  Again, there's a there's YouTube videos with that latent so people can if they want to do some extra homework with this
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:55.430]  They they'll set
[01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:59.470]  basical like tilled normal agricultural dirt
[01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:03.670]  I wouldn't even call that soil and then they'll put like a no-till in there and the
[01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:10.550]  the glomlin holds that soil system together while it's in water on top of like a little cage and then when the
[01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:13.870]  Agricultural dirt is set on there. It starts to
[01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.190]  You know go throughout the water system
[01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.390]  Almost immediately
[01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.350]  So it's I mean, it's a pretty cool
[01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:26.710]  Maybe we should do that as an experiment one day for people to see because it's pretty easy to set up
[01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:32.630]  I was able to do it in in California once but it didn't go as well as planned
[01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:35.070]  because I
[01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:39.390]  Maybe I didn't understand that how delicate that stuff was. So from flying from Denver to
[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:42.670]  California
[01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.470]  It didn't hold up like you normally see in the YouTube video
[01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:50.830]  So I felt like a little egg on my face when I was up there trying to talk about glomlin at that point
[01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:57.470]  And the demonstration didn't it was falling apart a little too quick for what I was trying to show
[01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.910]  But it is interesting how that
[01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:05.030]  Remember though. There's a critical piece here. Don't give all the credit to glomlin
[01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:11.430]  You have to give 50% of that credit to biofilm and the bacteria that form the biofilm
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.430]  It's the combination
[01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:17.230]  That's a secret formula. Yeah. Yeah that paper
[01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.430]  the last paper I read was really clear on the fact that
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:24.310]  there are
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.430]  multiple layers of of this
[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.030]  geo
[01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.030]  biological chemically chemistry
[01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.350]  processes that are occurring to allow
[01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:39.030]  that glomlin production
[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.550]  so
[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:43.110]  Where does the plant start and a dirt start?
[01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:45.470]  just
[01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:48.190]  It's it's it's a fucking complex one now
[01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:52.630]  They're going to take that word glomlin and break it apart. I
[01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.830]  Guarantee it soon
[01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.830]  to the point where we talk about
[01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:06.190]  Glomlin and soil will be called one thing and glomlin in the individual spore or or am
[01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:12.990]  Organism will be two different things and and it's already started. I think that for the most part
[01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.790]  The Ackerman is going to be like a four four word
[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:22.590]  Broken down to four letters of what it is called in soil
[01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:26.510]  So once it comes out of the body of the organism
[01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:31.150]  it's going to be something different because it's going to have all of these interactions with the
[01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.790]  you know the
[01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:38.110]  Geology biology and chemistry that exists in soil
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:46.030]  And then to take this to the next level that you had mentioned before with the worms that seems to be where you know
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:53.630]  Creating that symphony you can manage that that utopia when the composting worms the springtails the shredders when?
[01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.870]  Everything is kind of introduced
[01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:01.910]  Not only on the the root level the rhizosphere is there but then you're concentrating on feeding that
[01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:04.390]  By breaking down that organic matter
[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.470]  That's kind of that, uh, you know, you're the
[01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:10.470]  you're
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:17.110]  I guess getting as close as you can to trying to replicate or move in this succession like you mentioned towards the old growth forest
[01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:23.270]  I've noticed even talking to some of more of the old heads since they've disturbed the soil so much
[01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:25.910]  Uh rather than maybe like like steve
[01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.070]  Uh with with other ideas
[01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:33.590]  They were saying that they constantly had to focus on the fungal aspect because they were continuing to disturb it
[01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:38.630]  So it was like they were in this catch-22 where they had to focus on that because they kept disturbing it
[01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:41.670]  The employees are cutting things down. It's perpetual harvest
[01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.230]  uh, so maybe now if
[01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:48.070]  The thinking is going deeper with more of steve's approach
[01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.950]  Maybe now we might be able to start to see a variety of different
[01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.790]  Mycorrhizal fungi being developed or things falling off
[01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.430]  different species that could
[01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:05.830]  Could emerge from some of these guys that are at their like mountain organics is another guy that I think is 25 cycles or more
[01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:11.110]  It seems like our community should really focus and hopefully, uh support and lift
[01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:15.030]  lift up to individuals that have been able to get to that level because
[01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:22.330]  I mean i'm speaking on ignorance here, but wouldn't that be where the potential for the ultimate?
[01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:25.830]  uh utopia is being built is in cycles where they're
[01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:27.590]  you know
[01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:33.430]  10 plus maybe 20 plus that that part. I don't really know but after things have churned multiple times
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:38.310]  all of those growers seem like they're growing in basically a rainforest I mean the
[01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:43.590]  The stalks are thicker the the leaves are bigger a better genetic expression, correct?
[01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:48.710]  Correct, and I think I think you're you know, you're spot on on you know that
[01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:54.550]  Explanation of of you know, again providing the diversity that that allows
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.430]  um that kind of uh
[01:08:57.490 --> 01:09:01.750]  Expression to happen and I think I think more importantly it goes back to again
[01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:08.550]  You know these guys, uh, steve and others mountain organics. Ian, um should be sending off
[01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:16.630]  Root samples to efferent micro roots to have those roots analyzed to determine if he has colonization or not
[01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:22.230]  And if so, um, maybe the next level after that is as um
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:26.150]  these testing methods, uh
[01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.930]  Continue to get less and less expensive
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:32.230]  to actually
[01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:34.230]  start sending that
[01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:37.490]  Genetic, um
[01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.870]  Imprint from that specific species of fungi
[01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.650]  To be paneled and see or try to identify
[01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:49.670]  or or how do I say this, um
[01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:56.790]  Bark meta barcoding is an interesting thing because it doesn't it doesn't tear it all the way down to the individual
[01:09:56.870 --> 01:10:03.110]  But it's more of like what's around it. What's what's with it? And that's again. We're going
[01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:11.670]  Interdisciplinary, so you're looking at not just that fungi you're looking at the fungi the bacteria the protes and everything that was related to it
[01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:15.510]  um, who was there who was present and
[01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.310]  this gets really fucked up because
[01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.950]  Basically, it's a spotlight in time
[01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:27.510]  It's basically you're basically going back to the beginning and anything that was there that lived and died there
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:34.070]  you're going to to have an expression for their dna and therefore that dna will
[01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.550]  then lead you down the rabbit hole of
[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:43.290]  Oh, wow, it took this many generations and this much succession to get that level of fertility
[01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:46.490]  so by leaving your soil intact constantly
[01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:49.270]  you know
[01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.270]  preventing disturbance but
[01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:54.470]  Including the necessary inputs that you need
[01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.430]  Organic, obviously you don't want to get into salts
[01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.470]  um, but providing that level of
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.770]  geo
[01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:05.530]  biochemistry that would occur naturally
[01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.790]  in a healthy fertile system
[01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:16.790]  um, yeah, you're you're you're going to go the right direction, but you know guys like that need to you know, also test and
[01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:18.470]  work
[01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.470]  um or
[01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:21.830]  try
[01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:23.030]  to
[01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:28.230]  Help lift the rest of the industry or community up by providing data
[01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:32.250]  That hey, I used this product. I had this level of colonization
[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.470]  Um, and this is my soil test so this is my chemistry
[01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.090]  here's my
[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:43.770]  Biologicals, this is what level of organisms were found
[01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:47.530]  Um, and and now you can start to piece together
[01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:53.370]  Why it is that that he's doing so well and knocking it out of the park
[01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:55.930]  and again, you know that
[01:11:55.930 --> 01:12:01.290]  The problem is is that who wants to take the time and spend the money on something? That's that's not going to be
[01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.250]  um a direct
[01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:10.250]  Asset to them and this gets into generosity like, you know giving back to community
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.050]  Um, yeah, i'm knocking out of the park and this is how I did it peeps
[01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.290]  and so
[01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:21.610]  You know, maybe maybe the approach is is that as a community we set out a collection tray and say hey
[01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:23.690]  Everybody send in 10 bucks
[01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:30.090]  And you will be you will get access to this information if we raise enough money to do these thorough
[01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:33.050]  Testing and and the testing can be
[01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.690]  Quite expensive. I mean i've got
[01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:40.010]  Uh a company that I work with it's like 700 for a compost test
[01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:46.330]  And you say well, how can that be so expensive and it's like because they're doing a lot of testing
[01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.150]  on
[01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:50.330]  Interactions not just what's present
[01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:56.590]  But the inner the ratio of c to n the ratio of sulfur to nitrogen all of these different relationships
[01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:02.270]  Add up to data points that can be mapped out so that you understand
[01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:10.110]  What is the fertility of this compost? What is the availability of c to n or or any one specific nutrient?
[01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:14.030]  and why are those relationships so important because
[01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.590]  We all know what nutrient lockout is right?
[01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:21.150]  That's when you have too much of one nutrient and it locks out the other nutrients
[01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:25.890]  Well, the same thing is occurring at certain points during certain successional
[01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:29.130]  devolution or evolution
[01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.270]  so
[01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:37.390]  Again, it's it's a giant moving target. Um, but we by starting to assemble some of these data points
[01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:44.030]  We can lift up uh, the what is called raise the tide the high tide raises all boats equally
[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:47.310]  which is great for the community because uh
[01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:49.550]  Let's face it man
[01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:55.150]  This community is under attack from big ag and they're coming in and they're gonna fucking kick ass
[01:13:55.150 --> 01:14:01.490]  I mean look what happened to the northern cow farmers this year. They got fucking crucified from the fucking middleman
[01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:06.190]  They wouldn't pay them the value of what it cost them to grow that product
[01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:09.710]  And so therefore they're going to be stuck with a product. They're not going to make any money
[01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:15.390]  And these middlemen don't give a shit. They'll just roll in with the fucking crap that's being grown indoor
[01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:20.670]  And then as soon as the fucking state borders open up those indoor guys are going to crash
[01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.870]  And then who's who's going to buy them up on pennies on a dollar?
[01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.230]  Big fucking money big ag big pharma
[01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:34.110]  and so onward and upward of just nutrients cycling the little guy into the fucking soil and
[01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.830]  so as a community
[01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:41.950]  Um, if you start if we start to work toward these types of goals
[01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:47.870]  So that nobody has to fucking buy weed from a dispensary. They're going to go out of fucking business
[01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.510]  If everybody can grow six plants and they do
[01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:55.870]  Then you can trade your plant to someone else or you can trade your genetic to someone else
[01:14:56.430 --> 01:15:02.110]  Um barter like we talked about was it last week or the week before I mean if we were all bartering guess what?
[01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:05.710]  Fuck the government. They ain't getting no taxes and they don't like that shit
[01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:10.270]  I got audited by the irs and I was asked point blank if i've ever bartered
[01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:12.830]  and I just looked at him and said, um
[01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:15.470]  excuse me, but
[01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:18.830]  You work for a government, correct? And she was like, yeah
[01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:25.870]  Well, your government barters and she's like what are you talking about? I said you ever heard of campaign finance
[01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:30.290]  Have you ever heard of the relationships between governments?
[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.590]  and individuals
[01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:34.670]  And lobbyists. What the fuck is that?
[01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:39.390]  Lobbyists says here. Here's a bunch of money pass this law to help my client
[01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:43.950]  That's that's a fucking barter if i've ever heard one
[01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:48.270]  So, you know, no i've never bartered and yeah, i'll barter if I can
[01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.710]  And she did not like that fucking answer. I'll tell you that right now
[01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:57.310]  But I think that in many ways that that is what this community is going to need to do moving forward
[01:15:58.030 --> 01:16:00.190]  Is to protect each other
[01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.550]  From getting picked off form form glomulin, man
[01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:10.190]  Form a big fucking glue ball of of you know, love and happiness and sharing barter
[01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:18.110]  That's secretly something i've been afraid of for a few years now is that dispensaries would just turn to to the big farmers
[01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:20.590]  Uh, they only care about price
[01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:24.430]  And that's why I hope that more and more people just start to grow even if it's you know
[01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:28.030]  A tent or two or you know a four by four and just start to manage something
[01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:33.230]  So that you do have the skill set or you're at least developing the skill set if something does go awry
[01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:37.470]  one of my uh dispensaries I still frequent sometimes I
[01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:42.510]  Looking at their nugs over the years. It seems like they have major compaction issues
[01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:47.230]  Across the board whatever genetics you're looking at the nugs are about this big
[01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:50.750]  and they're supposedly a living soil facility in pueblo and
[01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:53.790]  all of those all of those things, but it seems like
[01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.590]  the individual doesn't
[01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.750]  I mean, I would imagine that they know that but
[01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:02.990]  It seems like they don't know how to fix that and so for a lot of these living soil farms
[01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:07.470]  When things do go awry and the the head individual doesn't know how to fix it
[01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:15.310]  I think that's why some of the the suits and the the deep-pocketed individuals are afraid to go the living soil route on a on a
[01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.830]  grand scale
[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:18.030]  because
[01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:20.030]  when it is explained to them sometimes
[01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:23.950]  The farmer themselves can't explain why this is better or why you know
[01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.990]  Using mycorrhizal fungi would be a benefit
[01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:33.150]  A lot of the older heads too. They just knew like product names and and brand names of products
[01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.030]  so this is as a community if
[01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:41.310]  This is kind of the the new especially for the younger individuals. This is your time to shine
[01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:46.050]  There's a little door a gateway that's opened up for kind of the new generation
[01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.150]  And if you guys take it and run with it
[01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:53.950]  I know that there's going to be a lot of successful people out there just because the community
[01:17:54.750 --> 01:18:00.910]  As well as the consumer is starting to understand that this is medicine. And then if they are just a weekend smoker
[01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:03.630]  they do want to have uh
[01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:07.070]  The quality stuff for the most part it seems like especially here in denver
[01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:14.590]  We have higher end dispensaries where you have to spend like a thousand bucks a month even to be in their little vip program. So
[01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.550]  Um, there's people out there that are willing to pay
[01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.350]  and and also there are people that are
[01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:22.990]  wanting like lower budgeted stuff, but
[01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:30.750]  For the most part when you're growing your own cannabis and that's I guess kind of what we're hopefully getting through by uh this show every week
[01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:35.470]  Uh, you're going to be able to dictate all of that stuff. You're going to be able to grow the genetics that you've always
[01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:41.630]  Seeked uh, and and the the fun part of this is that you can grow some of the cheaper genetics or genetics
[01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:43.150]  You've hound for a while
[01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:48.430]  Hone your skills and then eventually when your soil system is alive and thriving you feel like it's at its best
[01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:56.050]  That's when I would go and pheno hunt. Uh, and again, you're going to be up to deciding about those full genetic, uh profile expressions
[01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.590]  But you're going to have a better canvas to judge
[01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:04.350]  You know the breeders artwork from and that's going to make you a better cannabis breeder from day one
[01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:10.030]  Because genetics is really where it's at and for a lot of us, especially at the beginning of the first few years
[01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:14.270]  We were just passing around watered down genetics trying to grow it better than our you know
[01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:17.010]  Than our peers and then make a little money for ourselves
[01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:22.590]  Where now you can be so proactive that you could get the genetics you needed your worm farming you're building up
[01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.350]  Your soil systems you're understanding bacteria to fungal ratios
[01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:30.750]  uh, you know and you're maybe a year maybe six months into farming you're gonna be a
[01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:34.190]  Such a better farmer than than any one of my peer group
[01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:36.270]  Just from that standpoint alone
[01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:40.590]  And then I hope that you guys continue to pass on that information so that more and more people do feel
[01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:42.990]  That they can grow cannabis for themselves
[01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:49.090]  You know, you brought up a really interesting point brian. Um, i've noticed a similar, uh phenomenon
[01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.750]  Dispensaries, it's all about the popcorn
[01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:55.310]  Right. Everybody's got these little fucking nuggets
[01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:58.670]  And let me throw a question out there
[01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.990]  Is it due to packaging
[01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:05.790]  Because it's easier to pack little nuggets than it is a big butt
[01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.110]  right
[01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:14.270]  But you can you can tell that it's it's degraded over the years and then their answer is is that they they chop it up
[01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:15.470]  So much
[01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:18.430]  Because they don't want anybody complaining about stems and that kind of thing
[01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:22.110]  But the nuggets are are comically little for
[01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:27.710]  Really almost any dispensary that you'd go to in denver. Yeah, so so back to packaging
[01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:32.270]  It's a lot easier to package little fucking marbles than it is to package it, right?
[01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:39.710]  So why fix it I guess is what what you're kind of getting at right? Well again, I think it's just the approach or the
[01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:42.670]  the economics
[01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:45.230]  behind it and and again, you know the the
[01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:47.710]  these
[01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:51.310]  Larger facilities don't give a flying fuck about quality
[01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:57.070]  It's just about quantity and I don't know how many facilities i've been to and it's the same fucking story
[01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:00.350]  Don't worry about it. Just push it the fuck out the door
[01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:05.150]  Grow it grow it grow it if I can if I can take this shit down early
[01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:11.070]  And and produce a whole other run in the course of a year. Well, my profits just went up
[01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:19.310]  Exponentially because I snuck another run in maybe only got half a run in but either way. Did you did you let the the?
[01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:21.610]  plant fully, uh
[01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:26.110]  Express what it could have no because it's just get it in get it out get it in get it out
[01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:30.510]  And these little things these little tiny nuggets fit really easily in these little jars
[01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.270]  um, so perhaps it is a lot more about
[01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.790]  um the economic side of of
[01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:44.190]  Growth instead of the traditional side of growth, which was look how big my fucking nugget is, right?
[01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:51.310]  Um, so maybe that's part of it, but I agree with you that for whatever reason, um
[01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:54.110]  this approach to uh
[01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:58.190]  Larger cannabis production companies has always been about
[01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:59.710]  uh
[01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:02.610]  Fuck living soil just nuke it with fucking chemicals
[01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:06.110]  And I don't care if i'm polluting the environment every time I dump
[01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:11.150]  Uh half half baked nutrients into the into the water system. I mean
[01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:14.930]  Seriously cannabis production is one of the most detrimental
[01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:21.490]  Uh things that humanity can do in in scale because they're they're hydroponically
[01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:28.050]  They run it till the nutrients get to a certain level and then they're afraid that they're going to have a nutrient crash
[01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:34.530]  So they dump it and add fresh newts in and where does that newt go right out into the fucking oceans rivers?
[01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:40.690]  And you know through through the wastewater treatment plant, but the wastewater treatment plant isn't removing all that shit
[01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:47.190]  I mean dude, I could horrify you on the shit that they do as far as parts per million of nitrogen and phosphorus
[01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:49.010]  That's being released
[01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:51.010]  and and it used to be
[01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:58.130]  It used to be all around all about nitrogen. So the companies would uh would get water tested once a year
[01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:03.030]  Uh feds would come out take a water sample run it for nitrate
[01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:09.410]  Um, and they would say up your your past or you didn't pass and if you didn't pass you got a little fine
[01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.610]  So no big deal, right?
[01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:15.190]  And meanwhile, then they switched it to phosphorus
[01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:18.770]  Um, so now nitrogen isn't even being fucking looked at
[01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:23.650]  So now it's pretty much wide open what you're dumping out into the into the um
[01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:31.190]  Oceans and rivers and lakes, um, once you're done through uh, you're gone through your water purification and that's not even including pharmaceuticals
[01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.290]  There is no test for pharmaceuticals at this point
[01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:40.370]  So yeah, I think that is the that is the issue is that if if you look at
[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:45.010]  Canada's production is it coming from love or is it coming from money?
[01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:50.370]  And that's where you'll have a huge difference in quantity
[01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:53.170]  uh over quality
[01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:55.170]  Well, we
[01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:57.010]  We got to find that bridge
[01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:01.170]  Uh to to kind of meet the suits halfway where we can kind of explain to things, you know
[01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:05.810]  If you're if you're willing to believe in this team this system for three years
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:09.890]  That's why we always kind of use the the analogy of the nfl, you know
[01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:13.890]  You got to believe in your team for a few years to really build anything of quality
[01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:18.930]  otherwise, you know you're changing coaches you're changing star quarterbacks or whatever and the
[01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:24.530]  The chemistry isn't there, you know, you can buy all the athletes you want but the chemistry still has to be there
[01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:26.130]  usually in those
[01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:29.270]  You know, I guess i'm speaking. I only really follow the nfl
[01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.630]  But the the way that the that whole thing is structured
[01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:37.730]  Is that the bad teams benefit the good teams are are hurt with like the way that things are done
[01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.970]  So that there's a balance there that people stay
[01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:43.730]  Stay interested compared to other sports where a dynasty can be built
[01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:46.450]  but cannabis
[01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:48.450]  When things are being put out to this
[01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:51.730]  I hope that some of those older heads some of the gentlemen that we had mentioned
[01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:55.650]  They're kind of like the dynasties that the people that were trying to watch to see
[01:24:56.130 --> 01:25:03.250]  Uh, what can be achieved and I hope that more of the deep-pocketed individuals find out about those names or find out about their gross
[01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.770]  uh, or maybe we can find ways to get more of that out there because
[01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:15.170]  I've i've sat in meetings where when you when a when an owner with deep pockets is willing to really sit down and listen to
[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.810]  What you're trying to say and the meeting's longer than 30 minutes
[01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.490]  And they're actually asking real questions about what can be achieved
[01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.770]  There are a lot of light bulbs that click off when they've owned
[01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:30.370]  Hydroponic facilities or you know, they've just owned or managed a bunch of dispensaries now. They're trying to
[01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:32.850]  To go fully integrated
[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:37.730]  They do understand all the nuances that cannabis brings so when you do break it down like that
[01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:43.330]  I I feel like there'd be more opportunity for the community if we can find more of leaders
[01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:49.250]  That are ours. So what politicians or people that we're following to see where things can go?
[01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:50.850]  because
[01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:56.130]  The community has to find somebody a voice that's going to speak for the living soil
[01:25:56.450 --> 01:26:01.010]  Where there's enough data like you had mentioned where we can show that that things are improving
[01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.730]  And the money will follow because
[01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:08.210]  It's I don't know if you guys have been out, you know to vegas check out steve's cannabis
[01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:10.870]  But there's a reason why that stuff is everywhere
[01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:13.650]  And to be able to grow that in the desert
[01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:16.290]  I mean, there you go, right? I mean you could
[01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:24.290]  Most commercial facilities around the country if that's being done in the desert could could easily handle it. Uh anywhere in the country
[01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:30.690]  Agreed 100. I think I think getting the suits to meet you halfway is the is the hard part
[01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:33.410]  Because it's usually their way or the highway
[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.250]  um, and we're
[01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.250]  From a business standpoint. We're kind of naive
[01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:42.690]  Don't you think myself included like when you when you go out and help individuals you've helped them set things up
[01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:47.170]  After a while, uh, they might not need you. They don't need you as much as they thought you did
[01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:48.770]  um
[01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:52.930]  I guess the real beauty of that is is that when you when you remove some of the
[01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:56.390]  The quarterbacks or the people running the more of the day-to-day operations
[01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:59.090]  uh the system fails
[01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:07.410]  It I honestly haven't seen a system be successful unless there are tried and true individuals, uh, you know
[01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:11.890]  Steve said he's worked with like the same individuals for over 10 years
[01:27:12.210 --> 01:27:17.410]  That's the kind of shit that I I feel like you have to understand as a deep-pocketed individual
[01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:23.410]  You have to have people that are willing and wanting to work for you for years on end to really see this thing shine through
[01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:30.370]  And that's the difference from from a suits point of view is because some of the bullshit names here in colorado
[01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:34.770]  The turnover is so high that you rarely even especially even when you go to the dispensaries
[01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:37.890]  You rarely see the same people anymore. No one wants to work
[01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:43.970]  So there's there's a lot of variables that I feel like are potentially hurting. Uh,
[01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:48.150]  This from just exploding with the deep-pocketed individuals
[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:55.910]  They don't understand the process and then at the same time there are just a few people that are you know, 25 cycles plus
[01:27:56.630 --> 01:28:00.390]  so I think the answer to that brian is really the fact that
[01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:04.070]  There's two things here team building
[01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:07.190]  and big business
[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:14.790]  Big business you go to a business school. They tell you point blank your job is to get to the top
[01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:19.830]  And that includes stepping on every single person on the way up
[01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:21.990]  if you don't
[01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:26.550]  Take their ideas and bring it to the boss first shame on you. You're not going to get the promotion
[01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:30.550]  If you are a manager and you're managing these people
[01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:38.070]  Everything that those people underneath you come up with is yours. You take that to the next level. So it's it's
[01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:40.870]  business is all about
[01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:43.570]  individual uh ego
[01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:45.730]  uh self-interest
[01:28:46.290 --> 01:28:47.570]  where
[01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:52.850]  Team building is the opposite team building is like I want to lift all of us up together
[01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:57.570]  I want I might be the quarterback, but I need my running backs. I need my
[01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:01.330]  Receivers. I need my defense my my line
[01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:06.850]  Because I ain't gonna fucking get shit done if if i'm not protected and have the assets
[01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:10.610]  To move this ball to the other end of the field
[01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:17.570]  So it's it's it's two different things and two completely radically different ideas of
[01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:20.130]  Of how to do something
[01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:24.210]  I mean dude in the last two years the richest people in the world
[01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.830]  Have increased their holdings
[01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.610]  exponentially
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:37.970]  That's the difference between business and teams those same teams that we talked about whether they're nfl nba, whatever
[01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.290]  You don't see them
[01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:44.370]  Taking that same approach their owners are are figuring out how to
[01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:48.530]  Build a team that will win so that they can sell more
[01:29:49.630 --> 01:29:52.130]  paraphernalia and swag and all that shit
[01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:59.890]  But the team itself is is trying to bond each other so that I know what you're thinking
[01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:06.610]  Before you think it so that so that we are acting as one not as individuals
[01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:11.890]  So there's there's the answer to that problem and that's the kind of the underlying thing that
[01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:13.970]  hopefully more
[01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:15.010]  um
[01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:20.370]  Like head growers and stuff will realize is that you have to believe in everybody on your team and their contract needs to be
[01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:21.810]  Like a year or two
[01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:25.730]  Or if it's somebody that you truly believe in that probably does need to be three four years where you're
[01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:28.850]  In a bond working together side by side
[01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:31.490]  Because true magic is starting to
[01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:37.410]  Develop there and more and more individuals that are farming later three years four years five years into this
[01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:40.130]  In denver on an underground level
[01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:46.690]  Those guys are smiling ear to ear. You know, they put in all this work when we were first discovering this stuff and now they are
[01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:51.010]  living fantastic and doing things for their family and
[01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:54.370]  It's not necessarily material things, but they're able to
[01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:58.370]  You know buy organic foods and it's it's a great opportunity
[01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:04.690]  But they're able to you know buy organic foods and just just the little things in life that probably it'll just make you your health
[01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:06.050]  A little bit better
[01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:10.450]  More ways to go out there and probably do even more things for your family and yourself
[01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:16.610]  And like london there with you know, I saw you with your daughter and that's that's what it's really about is
[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:18.850]  Trying to grow the best food and the group, you know
[01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:23.090]  Grow, maybe this the best medicine that you can for yourself so that you can take care of your family
[01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:26.930]  I personally know that I you know, I enjoy smoking cannabis so that I can work
[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:30.850]  and continue to do a variety of things throughout the day and still kind of
[01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:34.450]  Maybe selfishly enjoy myself by being stoned
[01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:38.130]  but it allows me to stay productive and I do feel like there's
[01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:42.610]  Just as many people that use cannabis on that side of things as it was
[01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:47.170]  You know when I was in high school and everybody felt like if you were a stoner that you just didn't do anything
[01:31:47.890 --> 01:31:49.890]  but for some of us out there that's
[01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:55.170]  Very far from what our goal is when we're using cannabis. It's more to just kind of stay focused
[01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:57.970]  We got so much shit going on I need to dial in
[01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.610]  for an hour or two kind of thing so
[01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:01.810]  uh, let's
[01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:05.330]  Let's start by uh growing our own food growing our own medicine
[01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:11.810]  and hopefully um, maybe I could reach out to steve, uh steensland, uh, ian and
[01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:16.610]  If it is 700 we definitely need to probably reach out to the community for that
[01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:21.570]  Or maybe we could uh find a lab that would be willing to donate it something like that layton
[01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:26.530]  Kind of just shooting the shit live here. That was brian. That was only one test. Yeah
[01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:33.510]  You're talking a couple of grand to really do a full workup on everything from mycorrhizae
[01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:36.790]  colonization soil food web soil chemistry
[01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:41.970]  uh composition of your o horizon because more often than not
[01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:45.650]  we are growing in what would be considered a
[01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:53.490]  Substrate of organic matter and notice I didn't use the word compost because compost is a process. It isn't an end result
[01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:56.130]  Uh, or it isn't a product
[01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.630]  Um, so there's various stages of decomposition
[01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:05.650]  Um, and I would I did a couple shows on that I podcast last week or this week actually I don't remember where I am
[01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.690]  But the bottom line is that yeah, it's it would be expensive to do
[01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:15.090]  but it would definitely begin to prove to
[01:33:15.810 --> 01:33:20.130]  To deep pocketed individuals that they could produce a higher grade
[01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:22.050]  um
[01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:25.410]  a higher value product if they even want one
[01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:32.450]  So I think that's you know, the other side of the coin is that a lot of these guys don't care about the quality of it
[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:36.290]  It's just about again quantity pushing it out pushing it out making more money
[01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:39.090]  but i'm sure that you know as
[01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:43.570]  As you know the beer industry took over itself
[01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:46.530]  They created a niche called craft
[01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:49.250]  and that craft
[01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:52.230]  Became as big or and as lucrative
[01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:55.170]  as the budweiser and the cores
[01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:58.210]  That you could buy for short money
[01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:59.490]  but
[01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:01.490]  People voted with their wallet
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:06.450]  And chose to buy that sam adams or that micro brewery that popped up in your town
[01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.530]  um, so
[01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:10.530]  the consumer out there
[01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:12.510]  would
[01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:13.790]  probably
[01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:15.550]  take advantage
[01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:19.790]  Of the opportunity to buy something that was organic
[01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:22.430]  organically grown
[01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:23.870]  um
[01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:26.430]  That's kind of the problem with dispensaries though. Is that
[01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:29.570]  Um, at least here the way it's set up in colorado
[01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:36.750]  They're basically pitching you that it's craft beer and selling you the the cores light bud light and you're not able to smell it
[01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:40.350]  Or um, you know, I guess you can look at it through a jar
[01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:45.070]  I don't but if it was just on a shelf. I know for certain that the
[01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:48.110]  the craft cannabis movement would have
[01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:52.990]  Accelerated, you know, even just these past few years on a much higher level
[01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:55.630]  uh, because when you do
[01:34:55.710 --> 01:35:01.310]  I guess this is more before covid when you would meet up with a lot of individuals at some of these expos and stuff
[01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:03.390]  Everybody wants to show their stuff off
[01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:04.990]  and for some individuals
[01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:10.350]  I feel like it was a rude awakening when they would meet some of these like some of these guys are cannabis legends
[01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:12.750]  You know, they come from indo expo. We're all hanging out
[01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:17.630]  They pulled their weed out or they pulled their hash out this one gentleman. It was as dark as dark could be
[01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:20.030]  you know, so
[01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:26.670]  There's still so much misinformation and and stuff in the commercial side of things the dispensary side of things are on this side
[01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:30.430]  Where the living soil where we're all kind of buddies when we see each other
[01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:34.750]  I've never seen better cannabis in my life being showed by you know
[01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:40.270]  10 individuals hanging out with each other than I have with more of like the knf living soil
[01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:47.550]  All of the acronyms so nobody gets upset the biodynamic crews all of those individuals that put love and effort into it
[01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:52.910]  Whatever your ideology kind of thing is that cannabis those end results
[01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:56.030]  have always been far superior than
[01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:02.030]  Most of the salt guys that that I know and unless they really understood the plant itself
[01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:07.390]  It was really hard for those guys to compete and that's why in the underground side of things here in denver
[01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:12.830]  Living soil is popping. Yeah, it is. Yeah it is and that's the problem is that
[01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:17.630]  For whatever reason
[01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:19.630]  The individuals have been locked out
[01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:23.790]  for the most part of the process of getting their product in
[01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:26.110]  And on shelves
[01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:30.770]  So the other big problem is that the dispensary wants consistency
[01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:35.550]  So they want you to just run the same clones the same genetic over and over and over again
[01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:37.730]  So that if you like this cultivar
[01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:44.030]  You can come back two weeks later by the same cultivar. Well, that's just not realistic in this plant
[01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:50.270]  And and again, you're right man. You you you smoke side by side
[01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:58.110]  Chem bud versus bio bud and you'll never go back to chem bud. But how do you get bio bud in the hands of masses?
[01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.750]  um, the only way is to break that
[01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:03.710]  Concrete
[01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:06.190]  box that's around the distribution system
[01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:09.630]  and get it into the people's hands that that
[01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:13.150]  Have to go to a dispensary to purchase it
[01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:19.790]  Otherwise, you're just you're you're and why why is the black market thriving because of these problems?
[01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:23.790]  It's it's bigger and better and badder than it ever was. Um,
[01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:25.290]  and
[01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:27.290]  Fortunately, I think that
[01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:31.070]  A lot of the stigma behind cannabis is gone
[01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:33.710]  Like oh cannabis is a gateway drug
[01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:36.510]  That's gone. I don't hear that anymore
[01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:38.990]  um for the most part
[01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:41.310]  even older people
[01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:49.550]  Are having conversation about this plant and the medical benefits of it whether it's cbd or thc or a combination of both
[01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:51.710]  um, I
[01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:53.870]  know more and more people who
[01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:55.950]  my age
[01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:59.310]  Uh communicate this with their parents, which was taboo
[01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:06.130]  Uh, you know we were growing up man. This was like your parents caught you smoking weed. That was a fucking huge problem
[01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:12.750]  And now it's not it's not as as as big of a deal it's like
[01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:15.950]  Uh
[01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:19.310]  people that are a little older than me, um that have
[01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:22.190]  children, you know in their 20s or
[01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:25.710]  30s
[01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:27.710]  And know that their kids smoke cannabis
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:30.270]  It's not again. It's not like they're gonna
[01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:36.830]  Freak out on you and you know the next generation behind me that has children in their teens
[01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:42.110]  again, I think that if they got caught smoking cannabis as long as their
[01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:49.310]  Their approach to life was was appropriate and not like just smoking weed laying on the couch eating all day
[01:38:49.710 --> 01:38:54.750]  But if they were functioning, you know getting a job working school doing their homework, whatever
[01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:59.150]  I don't see it as being that that issue that it was when I was growing up
[01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:01.630]  So I think in many ways cannabis has lost
[01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.030]  a lot of its stigma
[01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:09.710]  Um, I think it's going to be really beneficial when the feds finally fucking legalize it which I still to this day
[01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:14.350]  Don't understand why other than the fact I believe it's money and control of power
[01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.870]  um
[01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:18.190]  I mean, why else would they hold this plant back?
[01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:21.470]  When so many states have legalized it
[01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:26.430]  But you know again, these are you know big geopolitical pharmaceutical companies
[01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:30.910]  I feel like a lot of people we've had i've had several discussions with people on that where
[01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:38.030]  Their feeling was is that the pharmaceutical companies could care less if everybody's hanging out getting stoned sitting on the couch
[01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:45.710]  Their their issue is that the more and more of the masses are starting to understand about different cannabinoids and that there's actually like a
[01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:49.150]  Beneficial, you know, even my own mother-in-law
[01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:51.710]  She just visited like a week ago
[01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:56.270]  She was terrified of how even doing cbd until she came out here. We explained it to her
[01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:59.630]  And she was able to try some of that and now she's you know
[01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:04.270]  She ordered some shout out to moon mother hemp quality products
[01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:07.470]  uh where same thing with my mother, you know, like
[01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:13.950]  They just didn't understand cannabis. So when you talk about other cannabinoids as health, they still viewed it as well
[01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:16.430]  Even if it is a health benefit, I don't want to get high
[01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:22.210]  Which is you know, obviously silly to this crowd, uh, but the education for the older generations
[01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:26.990]  Are still not there and the misinformation that so many of them still have
[01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:34.750]  Um, you know going to to parties and stuff or family reunions when people find out that I grow that I grew cannabis
[01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:36.270]  uh
[01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:39.470]  The questions come out because the health benefits when you get older
[01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:44.750]  You know, you're tired of taking all of those pills or feeling like a zombie by taking opiates or whatever
[01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:49.470]  you know, my my grandfather passed away from from shingles, but I feel like you
[01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:56.110]  He missed probably a whole maybe year year and a half of his life because he was just on opiates the entire time
[01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:58.510]  it was like yeah, he's alive, but
[01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:00.510]  Yeah, what's his quality of life?
[01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:04.190]  Right, and so they're just charging draining my uh grandparents savings
[01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:07.070]  Getting the you know the last little bit out of it
[01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:13.550]  So yeah, so it's really sad to see and that's why we're on the crusade every thursday is you guys gotta
[01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:16.110]  you gotta realize that the
[01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:18.830]  Food is extremely important
[01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:23.870]  The nutritional level especially as you're getting older. Nobody ever taught this to me
[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:26.590]  And I hope that that's something that I continue to teach
[01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:30.670]  The community as well as the cannabis stuff because once you start to feel good
[01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:33.870]  There's so many things in your life that that will open up for you
[01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:40.130]  I wanted to bring london in on this to kind of talk more from the bc side of things in vancouver
[01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:43.870]  What are your views like in your peer group?
[01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:50.270]  Is it the living soil is starting to take hold the smaller communities are wanting to to farm in this manner
[01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:52.430]  Or is it still?
[01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:54.430]  Uh salts up there as well
[01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:56.670]  Well, there's a lot of salts
[01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:59.230]  Uh, most of it is salts you go into hydroponic store
[01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:01.230]  The first thing you can see is a wall of green planet
[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:07.710]  so the interesting thing about bc is we have kind of the a very diverse culture when it comes to
[01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:13.390]  Plants and organics and stuff like that now our food scene is probably
[01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:17.390]  in some ways a little bit further ahead when it comes to
[01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:21.070]  regenerative or organic practices of
[01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:24.590]  You know farming and taking care of the land
[01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:31.570]  Whereas cannabis because we have like remo green planet we have a high saturation
[01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:33.390]  of
[01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:36.510]  bottle nutrient companies in this space you're talking like
[01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:42.190]  Three of them. No remo. I know is based out of bc green planet
[01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.790]  I know it's based out of bc canada
[01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:48.830]  So these guys are in like every farm on a regular basis with a large sales team hitting them out there
[01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:52.990]  So it's it's the first thing people see when they get into this space
[01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:55.970]  So there are a few places out in chilliwack
[01:42:56.830 --> 01:43:01.150]  that are doing the food movement like I like I mentioned earlier as a chef a lot of the
[01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:09.090]  Restaurants were starting to get pursued by organic producers that were doing regenerative practices no-till practices
[01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:16.590]  But even so that verbiage wasn't really being put around and still isn't really being put around and I actually wanted to kind of pose
[01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:21.070]  An angle of question because you mentioned that this is a great way to
[01:43:21.710 --> 01:43:25.630]  educate people and find that health in their life because of course
[01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:33.310]  We dive deeper into these plants and caring for them, but also realize that there's a great difference in in in what?
[01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:39.310]  The resulting product is out of it and then we incorporate that in other elements of our life, right?
[01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:45.710]  And one of the big challenges in the food space and food industry is we believe the same things and there's this great
[01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:50.350]  Price differential that makes things a lot more challenging and approachable to get into
[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.830]  One of the things is that the cost per acre
[01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:56.990]  Is a little bit more of a challenge for your organic or regenerative grower
[01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:58.990]  They're not getting quite as much yield out of it
[01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:05.310]  So they often have to charge more but there's also not the benefit of as many people purchasing the product
[01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:06.910]  so
[01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:11.870]  I notice as they grow and develop prices started to come down your your vegetable prices now
[01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:18.430]  Which is really interesting because of covid and all these other problems and issues like we were cut off from the rest of the world
[01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:24.030]  for a little bit here in bc because of floods and and this and that and the other and it actually
[01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:28.590]  really helped some of the local farmers because these guys had consistently cost and
[01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:31.310]  and price price affordable products now that
[01:44:31.710 --> 01:44:37.150]  All all of our products that are being long-distance shipped out of town that are filling our grocery stores going to your regular grocery store
[01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:41.230]  Are hitting the same vegetable prices in there that your organic producers are hitting now
[01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:45.150]  So we're seeing that kind of evolution and change happening forward
[01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:48.670]  And one of the aspects that I see it as a great entertainment
[01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:54.910]  It as a great route to kind of this forward slow food movement, you know local food movement
[01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:58.030]  Is
[01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:05.230]  Cannabis in the in the way, it's cool. It's fun. It's got this major social following people love listening people love talking about it
[01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:07.790]  How do we
[01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:11.870]  Step forward, you know, how what's the what's the next few steps?
[01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:17.870]  Do we think to to get this organic and regenerative movement and use both of these avenues together?
[01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:19.950]  Because we're both talking the same message
[01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:23.790]  It's the same idea that we the the way that we take care of our plants
[01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:28.590]  What's in them and what's around them produces a healthier lifestyle and same with the cannabis
[01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:31.470]  It just seems the narrative is so similar
[01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:36.190]  I'm wondering how can we integrate this and how can we make that work forward? Do you guys have any thoughts on that?
[01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:40.190]  Well, we've we've talked a lot about that. The problem is
[01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:45.150]  um, look at look at the the living soils community you got the
[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:51.310]  Biodynamics you got soil food web. You got natural farming and they're all arguing with each other
[01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:53.630]  you know, it's
[01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:58.910]  It's I fear it's just the nature of humanity that it's it's got to be my way or the highway
[01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:01.630]  And it's crazy, um, and you know
[01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:04.590]  since I started, you know, really
[01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:07.870]  Delving down the cannabis community. I've always said that
[01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:09.690]  the
[01:46:09.690 --> 01:46:11.690]  potential for the cannabis plant
[01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:14.430]  to shape
[01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:19.230]  The mindset of humanity is real and huge because
[01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:22.350]  Look at look at where the cannabis
[01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:26.670]  Community is now versus where they were 10 years ago
[01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:28.830]  um
[01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:33.390]  most often if not all the time, uh these living soils, um
[01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:39.070]  People are also have a food garden of some kind or or fruit trees of some kind
[01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:41.070]  so
[01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:43.070]  They're interchangeable. Yes
[01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:50.590]  When is that ever going to complete the cycle? I guess when when every farmer starts growing hemp
[01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:55.470]  um, whether it's for fiber for medicine or for feed
[01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:58.190]  I mean, we've really gotta get
[01:46:58.670 --> 01:47:01.790]  To have or cannabis because it's fucking same thing
[01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.510]  cannabis back into
[01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:06.510]  Feeding our animals. Thank you
[01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:07.950]  um
[01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:09.950]  Yeah
[01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:12.270]  I fall down that rabbit hole, too
[01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:17.470]  Um, you know, it's thc or cbd, but it's the fucking same damn plant
[01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:22.990]  And it if if we can get that plant back into our food chain
[01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:30.910]  Um, the benefits medically would be huge but again the pharmaceuticals want to keep us sick. They don't want to make us fucking healthy
[01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:36.350]  So you're really fighting you're fighting a system. That's that's in power and in place
[01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:38.510]  um
[01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:42.750]  to make changes that would go against their business decisions
[01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:47.250]  And their their profitability and their and their shareholders
[01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:51.950]  so in order to in order to stop it all, you know you
[01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:54.990]  Goes back to one thing money
[01:47:56.030 --> 01:48:02.270]  If if money was abolished then we wouldn't be having these conversations. Everybody would be eating nutrient-dense food
[01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:09.070]  Um, and it wouldn't be all about me me and and look at my house. Look at my mansion. Look at my car
[01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:16.750]  You know, so I I don't I don't know is that problem will ever get solved. I think that it will ease over time
[01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:19.230]  But again those first steps
[01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:23.950]  Those first fucking steps are get, you know, steve and joshua steens lens and
[01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:28.530]  Uh ian and some of these other guys to open up their fucking operation
[01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:30.990]  to a real
[01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:34.370]  You know deep dive of of testing and and exposing
[01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:43.250]  You know what's going on? Why am I getting these levels of cannabinoids? Why am I why is my cultivar grown in this environment?
[01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:46.510]  and the same cultivar grown in a
[01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:49.470]  Chemistry based environment
[01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:56.130]  Have such a huge difference in expression and the only way to do that is to do these, you know expensive
[01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:58.670]  exhausting
[01:48:58.670 --> 01:49:00.490]  um
[01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:01.470]  cross-disciplinary
[01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:05.650]  Tests to really determine, you know this complex geochemical
[01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:09.310]  Biological process and and why it's happening
[01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:13.490]  But at the end result who are you who who's going to get this information?
[01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:16.450]  The little guys that that
[01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:18.770]  Which is great because again, you know
[01:49:19.570 --> 01:49:21.330]  next generation or
[01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:22.610]  God willing
[01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:28.770]  You know, we we survive the next couple of generations, but eventually, you know, I I tend to believe that
[01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:34.850]  That cannabis will be way more of a mainstream in the future than it is right now
[01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:43.030]  And that stigma of oh, you're a stonehead will will disappear because pretty much anybody that smokes weed could turn around say you're a fucking alcoholic
[01:49:44.050 --> 01:49:49.010]  I mean literally look at look at look at what is labeled as an alcoholic somebody that consumes
[01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:53.490]  Alcohol every day glass of wine beer, whatever and it's even worse
[01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:59.810]  It's like I think if you consume, you know x amount of ounces over the course of a week that's considered an alcoholic
[01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:05.990]  Fucking this planet is alcoholic. Everybody's fucking an alcoholic. I mean the amount of people I see consuming
[01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:09.090]  That and that's okay
[01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:11.250]  Right, that's okay
[01:50:11.490 --> 01:50:16.070]  But smoking cannabis is not you know, that again is is manipulation
[01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:21.170]  Um by by people of power in position to to manipulate
[01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:25.010]  Can I touch on that about a really kind of interesting situation?
[01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:26.290]  I don't know if you guys have seen this here
[01:50:26.290 --> 01:50:32.450]  But in canada, you're not allowed to have your children come into the dispensaries and these are very nice posh
[01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:36.770]  Like they look like fucking apple stores to be frank. They're they're very you know glass
[01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:42.450]  Everything's nice and set up and behind glass and you're not even allowed to have your kid come in and a matter of fact
[01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:44.850]  because of of the
[01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:48.850]  The laws here. You're not allowed to have an attendant that works there
[01:50:49.650 --> 01:50:52.130]  Watch your child outside while you're in there
[01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:58.850]  So we have a cannabis store on the same kind of pavilion as a liquor store
[01:50:58.850 --> 01:51:06.370]  Which had to fight all the town hall just to get position there in in a place where cannabis is 100% legal in canada
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:09.730]  So first they had to fight the town hall and then on top of all this
[01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:14.130]  So if I was a single parent without without child care and I had to go to the store
[01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:18.450]  You're legally I would have to leave my child in the vehicle
[01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:23.010]  For me to be able to go in but that's not like you don't leave your kid in the fucking car
[01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:24.770]  That's not it's not safe. That's not right
[01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:26.290]  So i'm not allowed to go now
[01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:31.010]  I'm, not allowed to go to the dispensary because they don't have child care to watch watch out for meanwhile
[01:51:31.410 --> 01:51:38.370]  I I you could sit in front of that liquor store and watch parents utilize their children to carry their liquor to the car
[01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:41.010]  Now I I don't have an issue
[01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:42.690]  with that
[01:51:42.690 --> 01:51:46.530]  But why can't you know a mom who's having her stressful day?
[01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:50.930]  That single mother with two kids that's going through fucking hell
[01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:55.570]  Not be able to pick up some weed on their way home from work to relax because last time I checked
[01:51:55.810 --> 01:52:03.750]  I'm, okay with people smoking cannabis in front of my children, but I if they were wasted the there's a completely different situation
[01:52:04.530 --> 01:52:05.890]  um
[01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:12.530]  You know like I just don't get it. It just it's so weird and it seems so out of place and it's so contextually fucked up
[01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:19.250]  And it's just that that changed that division that we continue in that you mentioned earlier with the separate areas and we all
[01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:23.810]  We all like there's ickiness with certain stuff like oh, you know dog poops icky, you know
[01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:27.810]  Like who fucking cares fish poops fine aquaponics is fucking awesome
[01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:32.210]  There's all these other methodologies and we all like we have these contexts
[01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:36.770]  Contexts in our head like oh, there's bugs i'm gonna put bugs in my garden now
[01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:39.010]  There's bugs all over the place and i'm grossed out by bugs
[01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:39.490]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:44.930]  We've been living with fucking bugs longer than we've been living without the korean freak generation with my parents
[01:52:45.570 --> 01:52:51.410]  And the parents before that it's like all of a sudden we washed everything with bleach hydrogen peroxide and fucking stain clean at all
[01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:56.930]  Right, and I wonder what that damage did to did to everything in the long run of of you know
[01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:04.930]  Our endocannabinoids not just our endocannabinoids has taken away the thc but also like our epigenetics like what has those stressors of having?
[01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:09.650]  Zero bacterial influence on us at points in time during our youth
[01:53:09.970 --> 01:53:15.250]  What does that affect on us in the long run and is that going to affect our our children or our children's children in the long?
[01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:20.370]  Run, I mean there's so many levels to this. It's insane to think about and and unfortunately
[01:53:20.370 --> 01:53:25.490]  I do have about seven minutes as a heads up before I have to run my daughter to swimming
[01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:31.730]  So we do have to kind of hit hit the two hour mark today. Unfortunately guys. Sorry about that
[01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:35.410]  That's right. That's no problem, man. This is a complex subject
[01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:40.210]  People have been asking for this for months. So the fact that we could even address it, you know
[01:53:41.490 --> 01:53:45.330]  I'm grateful because hopefully there'll be others that might be able to add to this
[01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:49.010]  Or point us in the right direction for somebody that could really break this down
[01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:56.290]  uh, like I said, I can definitely reach out to my study group and they'll they'll have a lot more of the
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:54:02.290]  intricacies, but I think that you know, the conversation is so complex that you know
[01:54:02.370 --> 01:54:05.330]  It's got to start with like you got to keep your mind wide open again
[01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:08.770]  It's it's it's all of these things coming together
[01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:11.410]  That are creating this
[01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:15.090]  Unique
[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:17.010]  Glue
[01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:19.090]  But again, it can't be the same
[01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:23.490]  In the spore or in the hyphae as it is in the soil
[01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:28.370]  that's clear so that that piece of the conversations is just as important because
[01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:31.650]  The people that are asking me this brian are looking for
[01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:37.970]  What is it in the soil not what it is in the the spore or the the individual organism?
[01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:41.830]  Because that really doesn't matter but it's what's excreted
[01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:48.230]  And the end result of glomulin that's that's so valuable in in building soil structure
[01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:54.070]  So that's where that's where the next conversation will will will get a lot more complex and deep
[01:54:54.630 --> 01:55:00.310]  But again, if you could keep your mind open to the fact that you know, there's three three main pieces to this
[01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:05.670]  It's it's geo which is you know minerals and and sand soap clay and organic matter
[01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:10.630]  Biological not just one species, but multiple levels of species
[01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:15.270]  And chemistry what's available chemically in the soil and london, you know to your point man
[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:21.990]  We we have done such damage. Uh, just to the to the diversity of insects on this planet
[01:55:22.230 --> 01:55:24.950]  I mean you want to talk about horrifying?
[01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:26.790]  um the
[01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:33.030]  You know, we're definitely in the sixth extinction and as far as the bugs are concerned, they're fucking halfway through it
[01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:36.070]  We have we have literally wiped so many different
[01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:40.230]  Varieties and species and subspecies of insects. It's not even funny
[01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:44.630]  from all the pesticides because you know, we went with chemistry and then all sudden
[01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:50.070]  Chemistry through through the bug populations out of whack because they the plants were all sickly
[01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:54.790]  So they multiplied, you know these things called pests which really aren't in nature
[01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:58.790]  They're just there to break shit down that isn't healthy for for the consumers to consume
[01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:01.030]  so
[01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:03.430]  We we literally like created a
[01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:07.030]  We we literally like created this this
[01:56:08.050 --> 01:56:09.750]  infestation of of
[01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:11.990]  Pests or which really aren't pests again
[01:56:12.710 --> 01:56:20.310]  It's so bad. I say I I am so ingrained with that mentality that I say pests when speaking about predatory insects
[01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:25.990]  I have to correct my verbiage often because I was I was trained like from birth like oh my god
[01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:30.390]  It's a bug kill it liked it like my mother on it on a fucking table freaking the fuck out
[01:56:30.710 --> 01:56:34.870]  And now it's like I have mantises crawling on my hand and i'm like i'm trying to
[01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:40.630]  And this is like my grown birth. This is my life. This is like part of it. So like trying to get past
[01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:45.110]  These little inferences is so challenging. Oh, yeah, like like calling
[01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:53.670]  We had a fantastic discussion on praying mantis yesterday for people that weren't able to check that out
[01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:58.070]  There's a variety of them out there that are going to be more cost effective for you
[01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:01.990]  So don't waste your money like a lot of us did going to the high-end garden centers
[01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:06.470]  Check out. Um, his name is zach. So check that one out as well
[01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:11.830]  Um, there's just a lot of information that's been going out. Uh shout out to you london as well man putting out. Um,
[01:57:12.710 --> 01:57:16.950]  Information each and every week hosting shows, uh, shout out to chad westport as well
[01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:22.230]  This this becomes something pretty pretty cool to be a part of late and it's cool that uh
[01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:27.910]  It just continues to grow man, this is exactly like it's almost like we're we're
[01:57:28.630 --> 01:57:32.870]  Showing proof that this is how the soil microbial world grows. It's through
[01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:39.350]  Organic, you know, it's it's naturally occurring people talk about the show other individuals want to be a part of it
[01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:41.670]  More information is being put out
[01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:45.990]  Uh better questions better topic discussions are being asked, you know
[01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:49.670]  People are wanting to dive deeper into very complex subjects
[01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:54.710]  And we're going to always try to answer that or try as best we can to explain those things for you
[01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:58.790]  Because we do want you to feel confident to just grow for yourself
[01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:02.150]  the main thing of this show and
[01:58:02.230 --> 01:58:05.350]  Other shows that i'm a part of is that we we just want you guys to try it
[01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:08.790]  And give feedback to us and let us know how things are working
[01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:12.230]  Yeah, i'm into that brother i'm into that
[01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:15.750]  and as a community, hopefully we uh
[01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:17.190]  can
[01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.750]  Create some competition against this, you know
[01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:24.150]  Hypocritical unfair system that does not allow
[01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:28.310]  Um cannabis to be looked at viewed as similar to alcohol
[01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:37.270]  Better yet a plant like that just is like grows next to my damn tomatoes. There's literally a tomato right there
[01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:41.030]  Prove a point
[01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:43.030]  Fucking love it. Love it
[01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:47.590]  You guys do put on awesome awesome shows it's so cool because i've watched you guys a bunch and
[01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:52.150]  It's really neat to be like the little dude in the corner helping out. I appreciate
[01:58:52.710 --> 01:58:54.710]  being part of it guys and
[01:58:54.870 --> 01:59:01.590]  It's awesome. And the chat is is blown up with positive stuff. So like I I I couldn't lift them all their shadow check
[01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:04.230]  uh, man, laura
[01:59:04.230 --> 01:59:09.670]  I'm doing it super fast so that everybody can kind of get in there, which is great. We appreciate it
[01:59:09.670 --> 01:59:11.190]  Experience
[01:59:11.190 --> 01:59:12.310]  Yes
[01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:17.510]  That's a good. We appreciate all of you guys. This is a community that's being built from the ground up
[01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:23.850]  Um, it's even cool that they kind of named this living soil conversations because it really has just become conversations
[01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:27.910]  Finding viewpoints finding things that we should dive deeper into
[01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:32.890]  And I appreciate all of you that continue to give me topic ideas or want discussions
[01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:38.630]  And I hope that especially after today you guys see that i'm trying to follow through as best I can and find the guests
[01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:40.470]  or the topics
[01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:43.030]  that you want to hear I understand that
[01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:49.190]  Whatever it takes that you know for almost every living soil natural farmer biodynamic farmer
[01:59:49.670 --> 01:59:55.350]  uh, there is some kind of switch paradigm shift something that you read or something that you hear where you just
[01:59:55.670 --> 01:59:57.670]  believe in that part and that's
[01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:59.350]  really the end goal
[01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:01.990]  uh for a lot of this stuff is that once you've kind of
[02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:07.770]  Drank the kool-aid if you will you're going to run with this tell a variety of friends once you've experienced
[02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:10.470]  You know the end results
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:17.670]  And then that's my personal mission when we even first started this is that's the only way I know that from a grassroots point of view
[02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:20.470]  We would be able to fight big ag
[02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:23.030]  is by information
[02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:26.550]  because they can't take that shit from you and then we decide how much we want to
[02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:31.270]  Distribute and then that like my point earlier more and more people are wanting to get involved
[02:00:31.670 --> 02:00:36.150]  Then you know that the the hunger is out there and there's more individuals that see the value
[02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:38.630]  And spending a couple hours
[02:00:38.630 --> 02:00:45.190]  Of their day of their day each and every week understanding these concepts so that they can minimize years
[02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:47.750]  Especially when you're new to this
[02:00:48.230 --> 02:00:50.230]  I'm in great words brother great words
[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:54.790]  And I think I think you do it's bold. This is a bold thing to do
[02:00:54.790 --> 02:01:02.550]  I'll just say when it comes to like complex subjects like this we did we we drove into epigenetics like last week on the dank hour
[02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:04.550]  And I was like
[02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:08.230]  Our our doctor anabas who like, you know did some work with
[02:01:08.850 --> 02:01:15.350]  Epigenetics and had the deepest understanding of it was like our lead conversation piece and she had trouble for like the first 20 minutes of the
[02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:18.390]  Show i'm like well, I like kind of get it
[02:01:19.110 --> 02:01:23.830]  And trying to have a topic and and and realize that and I like how you said it at the beginning there
[02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:25.830]  Is this is a discussion on something?
[02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:31.910]  That it will continue forward and that we're just we're just discussing and learning and everybody's just discussing learning
[02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:34.790]  And that we can talk about it and discuss and learn it together
[02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:41.030]  That's that's the cool part being on that feeling the feeling of being on that forefront is amazing to be a part of
[02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:43.990]  Um, so thank you guys. Shall we shall we call it at that?
[02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:47.350]  Yeah, sounds good. Peace out. Everybody. We'll see you next week
[02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:50.070]  Yeah, I appreciate you
[02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:52.470]  guest host in london
[02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:55.450]  Yeah, it was fun brother and i'll see you next tuesday, right?
