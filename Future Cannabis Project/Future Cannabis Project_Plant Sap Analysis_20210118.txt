[00:00.000 --> 00:08.640]  Do you feel out of place with no cowboy hat? All right, welcome everyone. Today is Monday,
[00:08.640 --> 00:17.920]  Martin Luther King Day, and we have an impromptu conversation with the cowgirl Jenny from the block
[00:18.480 --> 00:26.880]  and these two guys. We're going to try to add something to the conversation, but
[00:26.880 --> 00:32.080]  Brandon, you were just talking colors. Do you want to just kind of repeat what you were just
[00:32.080 --> 00:37.440]  talking about? Yeah, we were talking about different carotenoids, the different colors
[00:39.360 --> 00:45.760]  in plants that typically come through as the chlorophyll pigment and the coloration from
[00:45.760 --> 00:52.400]  chlorophyll dissipates towards the end of cycle as the plants are utilizing less of the nitrogen and
[00:53.360 --> 00:59.520]  they're starting to not photosynthesize as much as they come to the end of their cycle.
[00:59.520 --> 01:05.120]  Though it's just an interesting thing we were talking about. A lot of times we'll typically see
[01:07.040 --> 01:16.320]  induced fades that are caused by deficiencies and they're not, you know, the natural colorations
[01:16.800 --> 01:24.560]  coming through. Or they could be toxic. Sorry to cut off your head, Tyler. Or toxicities can
[01:24.560 --> 01:32.640]  do the same thing. They can push kind of weird colors into plants. Chlorides for fun, definitely.
[01:34.480 --> 01:44.480]  So Jenny, welcome. We'll be gentle with you. You got some topics to cover on sap analysis. So
[01:44.480 --> 01:51.040]  Tyler, why don't you, you know, you had no idea what sap analysis, there was a time in Tyler's
[01:51.040 --> 01:57.440]  life where he had no idea what sap analysis was. He didn't know he was blind. You should introduce
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.040]  yourself just for anybody who doesn't already know who you are. Yeah, I'm Tyler with Grassroots
[02:03.040 --> 02:09.200]  Fabric Pots. I've been the lead sales associate here at Grassroots for over five years. I walked
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.000]  into Grassroots about five years ago just to buy some pots and got into a great conversation with
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.640]  the owner here and hit it off. I hated my job at that time working in retail sales for AT&T doing
[02:20.640 --> 02:25.120]  cell phones and selling people direct TV and crap like that, dealing with their text messages not
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.560]  working and absolutely hated my job. Honestly kind of hated life at that time and just was seriously
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.600]  blessed by being able to get this job here. So just been raging away. I've personally created a
[02:35.600 --> 02:41.920]  couple products of my own. I helped bring to life the fabric raised beds in our version, which,
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.720]  brought them to 18 inches deep. It made them customizable to any size. Now we've brought
[02:46.720 --> 02:52.800]  in those beds out to over 120 foot in length. We've done eight foot wide beds. I've done a lot
[02:52.800 --> 02:59.360]  of crazy stuff. I got into the sap testing because of David Olson. David Olson is a creator of our
[02:59.360 --> 03:06.400]  concentrated biology products, which is our liquid microbial compost tea. It started with a vermicompost
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.040]  and brewed out and then brought stabilized so it can be put in a bottle. When you're ready to use
[03:11.040 --> 03:17.200]  it, you combine it with our powdered microbe foods to activate the microbes. That product is
[03:17.200 --> 03:24.720]  about a one gallon will equal out, it'd take about a hundred gallons of any other microbial inoculant
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.600]  product to equal the concentration of that one because it started as a actual vermicompost.
[03:30.240 --> 03:35.440]  So David Olson has always been helping me dial in my growing techniques and dialing in our programs
[03:35.520 --> 03:41.440]  with our bloom and flower phases and everything like that. He said, why aren't you using sap
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.240]  testing? Every other conventional farmer takes advantage of these tools. Why aren't you doing
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.480]  these things? It'll give you a chance to look three, four weeks ahead and see what's going
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.680]  on with your plants and see what possible deficiencies you could have. Because I'm in
[03:55.680 --> 04:01.200]  Northern California. I have a full-time job, but I still have a grow on the side. If there's no
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.680]  issues and I can go to work and I can go back to my grow and everything's fine and I don't have all
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.280]  those stresses of an outbreak or bug problems, that's my goal. We know that healthy plants are
[04:11.280 --> 04:17.120]  resistant to mold, mildew, russet mites. If you have a super healthy plant and it has a high
[04:17.120 --> 04:22.800]  sugar level inside the plant material, the bug will literally go and eat that plant material.
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.360]  It'll go into its stomach and it doesn't have a pancreas so it can't process sugar. And literally
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.800]  that bug will ferment and die. We want super healthy plants that have a super high BRX level
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.200]  that have high sugar contents in it. When that bug does come along and takes a bite of your plant,
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.120]  it decides that doesn't feel good. I don't want any more of this. I'm moving on to the next crop
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.080]  or your next neighbor, however that is. That really attracted me. I said, okay, I've got to do
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.880]  some sap testing. I need to look ahead at this here. I went onto the New Age website. I filled
[04:50.880 --> 04:56.400]  out the contact form and an hour later, Jenny called me. I was like, oh crap, this is awesome.
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.640]  She called me and we broke down the process of how to take my leaves from the bottom of the plant,
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.640]  how to take my leaves from the top of the plant, sending those in so they can compare those and
[05:04.640 --> 05:11.360]  look for those deficiencies. I can obviously let Jenny go into that process. When I started that,
[05:11.360 --> 05:18.560]  I think I had planted July 7th-ish, started this process about a month into that and found out,
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.480]  first thing I found out was there's three forms of nitrogen. I didn't even know before.
[05:23.200 --> 05:30.640]  If you have a super high level of nitrogen slash ammonia, that is what the bugs want. That's what
[05:30.640 --> 05:36.240]  the russet mites, that's what they, specifically the aphids. If you have continually aphid outbreak
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.680]  issues, that's tying back to that nitrogen there. I'm getting into a lot of stuff that,
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.480]  oops, sorry. Same with pathogens as well. Botrytis, powdery mildew, they all
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.960]  feed off of really high nitrogen levels in leaf tissue.
[05:50.960 --> 05:53.760]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah. So, you know, I'm getting into some
[05:53.760 --> 05:58.800]  points that are starting to get scientific and stuff like that. But pretty much I found out that
[05:58.800 --> 06:05.360]  I was about three weeks left of veg and I was overloaded in nitrogen, completely overloaded.
[06:05.360 --> 06:08.880]  And if I fed any more nitrogen, I was going to have major issues. And I wouldn't have known that
[06:08.880 --> 06:14.080]  unless I did a sap test. So I would have continued with my same program and feeding my, once a week,
[06:14.080 --> 06:18.160]  doing my feeding there of nitrogen and I would have had major issues. So it allowed me to look
[06:18.160 --> 06:22.640]  ahead. And at that point, I also saw, we can go over this, we've got the test reports, but I was
[06:22.640 --> 06:29.520]  massively low in, I think, iron and three or four other minerals, which is really funny is those
[06:29.520 --> 06:35.280]  were also the minerals that I amended my soil with. And so I did a saturated paste test and said,
[06:35.280 --> 06:39.840]  hey, you need these minerals in your soil, you're lacking those. And I amended those,
[06:39.920 --> 06:45.760]  but they weren't available yet to the plant. So with the sap testing, I was immediately able to
[06:45.760 --> 06:54.480]  correct those deficiencies with a foliar feeding. So I was spoon feeding those not there items to
[06:54.480 --> 06:59.120]  the plant as it needed it per week. Now that I look back at that, it's like, God, I could have
[06:59.120 --> 07:02.160]  been doing that every couple of days. I should have pushed a little bit further. I should have
[07:02.160 --> 07:06.720]  did a little bit more. I'm very happy with the results. I'm very happy with my yields and what
[07:06.720 --> 07:13.600]  I got out of my square footage and best year yet, honestly, I've had in about eight years overall.
[07:14.960 --> 07:19.600]  So yeah, it was awesome. It's a tool I'm definitely going to use. If you're a commercial
[07:19.600 --> 07:25.520]  or any sort of facility or even in a tent, I got guys using this in a tent because they're putting
[07:25.520 --> 07:29.360]  out two and a half, three pounds of light and they're loving it. And they're putting out like,
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.560]  jungle weed fire kind of looking stuff and they're just in their tent with living soil.
[07:34.560 --> 07:38.560]  So, there's everybody out there. There's a certain group of people that just want to take their
[07:38.560 --> 07:43.040]  growing to the next step, the next level. If you're not using science to do that, you're just guessing.
[07:43.840 --> 07:49.920]  Exactly. I tell people all the time. And it's one of the reasons that I don't actively give out
[07:49.920 --> 07:56.000]  recommendations for nutrient levels, because I can't give you an accurate piece of information
[07:56.640 --> 08:01.840]  without having data. So if somebody says, Hey, what's the recommended amount for this? Well,
[08:01.840 --> 08:05.200]  I don't know what your soil looks like. I don't know what the saturated paste test looks like. I
[08:05.200 --> 08:10.560]  don't know what your tissue looks like. And I don't know what your sap samples look like,
[08:10.560 --> 08:15.360]  because having all the correlated data, soil testing, so you can see what's in there,
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.400]  saturated paste, leaf tissue, and sap, all of those combined data create the set to where you're
[08:22.400 --> 08:29.840]  going to be able to maximize. One of the problems that I have encountered is the timeliness that
[08:29.840 --> 08:36.320]  it takes for both the shipping and the test results. So the time you get test results for
[08:36.320 --> 08:44.080]  saturated paste testing, it's a week behind, you know, and leaf tissue. With the sap analysis,
[08:44.080 --> 08:49.600]  it's different because you can fill in that gap. Yeah. And one of the reasons,
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.840]  Jenny, before you start, I'll be right back, because as these guys know, I got to put down
[08:55.840 --> 09:00.400]  a feisty two year old who does not like taking naps at two in the afternoon. So I'll be back.
[09:01.360 --> 09:08.480]  Carry on. Maybe you should maybe introduce yourself for the people who don't know who you are,
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.800]  what company you're with, and maybe a little background. Sure. Okay. Thank you for having me.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.880]  I'm Jenny Garley. I'm from New Age Laboratories. I'm here in California. The lab is in South Haven,
[09:22.880 --> 09:29.840]  Michigan. Just all know that. So if any of you are thinking about using sap, please do not send
[09:29.840 --> 09:36.400]  them to me. Our laboratory is in Michigan. I've been working with sap analysis for six years.
[09:37.040 --> 09:47.520]  I've been studying it, looking at thousands of sap interactions with mainstream ag, hemp, cannabis,
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.560]  you name it. If it has a leaf, I've been looking at the sap analysis and making nutrient correlations,
[09:54.560 --> 10:03.840]  walking the fields, understanding stage of growth versus nutrient uptake. So again, that is very,
[10:04.800 --> 10:12.240]  very interesting and important, not just to add the same nutrients and not look at where you are
[10:12.240 --> 10:18.800]  in your growth stage. So again, very important. That's a little bit about me.
[10:19.760 --> 10:28.880]  Go follow New Age Labs on Instagram, guys. Thank you. So looking at sap analysis and possibly
[10:28.880 --> 10:36.320]  why it's going to give you two to three, sometimes even four weeks window opportunity to correct your
[10:36.320 --> 10:43.040]  nutrient uptake is because sap analysis looks at, it does two things. It looks at the current
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.160]  nutrient uptake that is available and unincorporated into the leaf tissue.
[10:48.880 --> 10:56.320]  It also is a comparison. It compares young yet fully photosynthetic leaves and old yet viable
[10:56.320 --> 11:05.360]  leaves. So that comparison gives you a 3D look as where tissue is flat and more static because it's
[11:05.360 --> 11:15.600]  only one set. So taking those two things into consideration will give you a window of opportunity
[11:16.320 --> 11:23.280]  to look at your imbalances and try to do something about it and not wait until you see signs and
[11:23.280 --> 11:30.800]  symptoms where the plant's already stressed out. So that's the big differences between tissue.
[11:30.800 --> 11:39.600]  Turnaround time is also much faster, pretty much because tissue analysis involves a heating
[11:39.600 --> 11:46.080]  process. The sap, the tissue is taken. You can put it in a paper bag. You can throw it up on your
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.560]  truck dash. You can drive around all day long, drop it off at the lab at your convenience.
[11:51.120 --> 11:57.360]  They will wait until they have enough samples to fill up their dryer and then they ash the
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.600]  sample. They literally burn it. Sap analysis, there's no waiting period. There's no heat
[12:03.600 --> 12:12.400]  involved in the process whatsoever. So as soon as New Age Lab, as soon as the samples come into
[12:12.400 --> 12:18.800]  the laboratory, if they come in before noon, we can actually process them that day and turn
[12:18.800 --> 12:25.040]  the analyses back around in 24 hours. If we receive the leaves in the afternoon, we hold
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.080]  them in the fridge and process them the next day. So it becomes a 48-hour turnaround just
[12:30.080 --> 12:37.760]  depending on when they get to the laboratory. So those are some differences. And so my understanding
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.520]  is, you know, when you take some older and younger leaves and you make a comparison,
[12:44.080 --> 12:52.880]  what you're able to see is nutrients that are mobile that can translocate. And then you're
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.320]  able to see the ones that are immobile on both tests. And if you're seeing the translocation
[12:59.040 --> 13:05.680]  of nutrients from older leaves to newer leaves, that is an indication that you don't have
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.320]  adequate amount in your soil. That's not, or that not inadequate enough is falling into solution.
[13:12.320 --> 13:21.120]  Very well said. Absolutely well said. The other third part of that is that you could have a
[13:21.120 --> 13:29.280]  cation or anion imbalance, meaning that there is a nutrient that is blocking an anion, a negatively
[13:29.280 --> 13:35.440]  charged molecule or a cation, a positively charged molecule. Yeah. Those are the three.
[13:35.440 --> 13:42.560]  Would you like me to throw the graphic up? Oh, sure. Right. There I am.
[13:42.800 --> 13:51.430]  Yeah. Okay. What are we looking at? This is just a nutrient wheel of
[13:53.110 --> 14:00.790]  nutrients that we can test for. Some of them we can't up at the immobile nutrients. We don't do
[14:00.790 --> 14:07.990]  iodine or fluoride at this time. We actually do test for selenium and nickel just to throw that
[14:07.990 --> 14:13.990]  out. But at the bottom of the chart, we're looking at the cations, the positively charged elements
[14:13.990 --> 14:22.150]  and anions, the negatively charged elements. And it's just nice to have this, looking at it,
[14:22.150 --> 14:29.750]  because when you look at the cations, they are antagonists within themselves. So too much,
[14:30.070 --> 14:36.630]  let's say potassium K will interfere with the uptake of calcium on the anion side,
[14:36.630 --> 14:44.310]  the negatively charged side. The biggest scenario that I see in hemp cannabis is too much chloride,
[14:44.310 --> 14:53.910]  negatively charged, interferes with phosphorus. So that's just a nutrient wheel to give you an idea
[14:54.710 --> 15:00.630]  of just another way of looking at it. Sodium and chloride are the biggest antagonists in
[15:04.310 --> 15:14.550]  as far as nutrient elements go. And it's my understanding, one of the important things
[15:14.950 --> 15:26.310]  in understanding the cations and the anions is that, like you said, they're antagonistic to each
[15:26.310 --> 15:34.390]  other. And that's really a thing where when we're looking at saturated paste testing,
[15:34.390 --> 15:40.070]  we're looking at balance of how those are balanced in solution too. Because
[15:40.470 --> 15:44.790]  if you have something that's going to be antagonistic, it'll block the uptake of other
[15:44.790 --> 15:51.670]  stuff. That's the biggest, so having a balanced cation, balanced anions in solution and being
[15:51.670 --> 15:58.870]  able to not have antagonists like sodium and chloride will increase their availability
[15:59.990 --> 16:03.190]  and the energy needed for the plant to uptake those elements.
[16:03.270 --> 16:10.390]  And hemp cannabis is a natural chloride accumulator. So that is one of the biggest
[16:10.390 --> 16:19.190]  hurdles for growing this crop is it naturally accumulates chloride. Just like chard naturally
[16:20.070 --> 16:30.870]  accumulates sodium, it's a heliphyte. So the hemp cannabis, that's its natural enemy is it just,
[16:31.350 --> 16:36.630]  it searches out and seeks out and is very good. It's amazingly good at taking up chloride.
[16:36.630 --> 16:45.750]  And knowing that is the first lesson in the battle. So understanding that, trying to get in
[16:45.750 --> 16:52.150]  your phosphor early, not waiting until you take a saponylosis in the middle of your grow,
[16:52.710 --> 16:58.070]  where your chlorides are off the char and your phosphorus has plummeted. It's very, very,
[16:58.470 --> 17:03.990]  very difficult to come back from that. So being proactive and understanding that hemp cannabis
[17:05.110 --> 17:12.070]  already will be starting to scavenge chlorides and trying to fight that war in the beginning,
[17:12.070 --> 17:21.110]  where it's not uphill yet. Yeah. So as a consultant, the thing that I see most in the testing is
[17:21.590 --> 17:27.910]  bad water being the cause of sodium chloride and bicarbonate. And those are all highly,
[17:27.910 --> 17:35.350]  highly antagonistic to the other soil nutrient minerals. And so if you have a soluble salts that
[17:35.350 --> 17:42.070]  read something like a thousand PPM, but your bicarbonate and sodium and chloride levels are half
[17:42.310 --> 17:47.590]  of that, you're essentially blocking out everything else. I mean, your plants don't
[17:47.590 --> 17:54.070]  have the capacity to even uptake those mineral elements any longer. So it's,
[17:56.230 --> 18:03.030]  it's a highly recommended to use and test your water as well and use good clean water. That's
[18:03.030 --> 18:10.070]  not high in sodium. It's not high in phosphorus. It's not high in anything else. And it's not
[18:10.070 --> 18:16.310]  water that's not high in sodium. That's not high in bicarbonates. That's not high in chloride
[18:16.310 --> 18:22.230]  because what happens is these things stack up and accumulate over time. So you might be okay for a
[18:22.230 --> 18:28.230]  little while, but eventually they'll stack up. And it's one of the, another reason why I don't use
[18:28.230 --> 18:34.630]  animal products in my soil mixes because animal products have been shown consistently to be really
[18:34.630 --> 18:41.830]  high in sodium and some of the other elements that can be antagonistic and trying to, for me,
[18:41.830 --> 18:48.390]  I try to keep those levels as low as possible. Absolutely. Keeping your sodium as low as possible
[18:48.390 --> 18:55.990]  is, is fantastic. We just don't need very much sodium at all. And, and if we're measuring it at
[18:56.550 --> 19:03.350]  good to high amounts, there's already an issue. It's already blocking cations. So cations,
[19:04.150 --> 19:11.990]  calcium, magnesium, and potassium, they're all mobile, all mobile. Sorry, calcium is not mobile.
[19:12.630 --> 19:18.470]  Magnesium and potassium are mobile. So going over the mobile elements is NPK,
[19:19.910 --> 19:29.430]  chloride and sodium. And your non-mobiles would be your boron and your calcium. And everything else
[19:29.430 --> 19:39.430]  falls into semi-mobile, slight mobility, almost to none. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's important to
[19:39.430 --> 19:45.510]  mention too, there's a few of those elements or, or timeframes where you could even miss the ability
[19:45.510 --> 19:50.710]  of, of fixing that issue. It could be past that timeframe in the succession of the plant to be
[19:50.710 --> 19:56.310]  able to make a change to it. And also I, in my experience, I found out that there's a few elements
[19:56.310 --> 20:01.990]  that you can only feed once or twice and you could totally max them out, which I think boron is one
[20:01.990 --> 20:05.750]  of those. And Jenny, what were the other, other ones that you can't, that I can only feed like
[20:05.750 --> 20:11.510]  once or twice and it's just way too much for the plant? Well, it depends on how much you're feeding,
[20:11.510 --> 20:15.830]  but the plant also doesn't need very much molybdenum, but it does need it for nitrogen
[20:16.710 --> 20:22.070]  breakdown. But if you're feeding that significantly over your season, you can
[20:22.230 --> 20:29.190]  absolutely blow the plant away on, on adding too much. Molybdenum is one of them. Cobalt is another
[20:29.190 --> 20:35.830]  one. Cobalt is actually an element that's recycled, which is kind of cool. The plant doesn't use it up
[20:35.830 --> 20:41.750]  per se, like iron, where it actually uses iron in the nitrogen reductase pathway. It's, it's,
[20:41.750 --> 20:49.670]  it's used up. But cobalt is, is, is recycled. So that's kind of nice. You only need to add a little
[20:49.830 --> 20:55.030]  bit and it goes all the way down to the root tips and it helps at the very, very end of the roots
[20:55.030 --> 21:00.310]  for communication among other things. I think the biggest thing we see in living soil too is,
[21:02.070 --> 21:06.550]  like Brandon was saying, is people not qualifying, quantifying their water because it's your biggest
[21:06.550 --> 21:11.910]  nutrient. And I don't think people realize that is like what you're feeding your soil water every
[21:11.910 --> 21:16.470]  day. Let's, you know, take some science to see how that affects things over time. Because that was
[21:16.550 --> 21:24.150]  my issue. And the issue that I've had is I've over watered and spiked my, my pH and screwed up
[21:24.150 --> 21:29.750]  my EC and it's caused some major issues when my plants were doing great. And that was just my
[21:29.750 --> 21:36.550]  fault in using my irrigation system and not going to a blue mat system just yet. But definitely some,
[21:36.550 --> 21:41.430]  some little important factors there that I learned this season going through that process was pretty
[21:41.590 --> 21:50.070]  interesting. Talking about EC and, and also back to sodium and different salt fertilizers, if your
[21:50.070 --> 21:57.510]  EC does get too high, your plant will take up water to try to dilute that, right? So you end up
[21:57.510 --> 22:07.190]  with watery cells, especially in the beginning when you are in veg and you need to accumulate
[22:07.750 --> 22:13.350]  accumulate a lot of calcium. If you take up too much water because you're using too much salts,
[22:13.350 --> 22:20.630]  the plant will try to bring itself back in balance. The calcium follows water. So you
[22:20.630 --> 22:26.790]  in essentially make watery cells by doing that. So watching your, your salts and your sodium
[22:26.790 --> 22:33.430]  is really important. And the reason why that is bad is because that opens up the plant to pathogen
[22:33.510 --> 22:40.150]  and insect attack. When you don't have healthy cells that are filled with calcium,
[22:41.830 --> 22:51.030]  they become more susceptible to disease and insects. So one of the things that I constantly
[22:51.030 --> 22:58.790]  tell people about is front loading calcium in veg, getting the leaf tissue really high in calcium.
[22:59.430 --> 23:05.590]  And then when you switch over, you can hit it harder with potassium
[23:07.110 --> 23:12.230]  and kind of adjust the level of the percentage of calcium to
[23:13.910 --> 23:18.070]  potassium in flour. And that will help increase the, the yields.
[23:19.430 --> 23:24.070]  Yep. And I think that's what Tyler was saying is matching up the nutrients to the stage of growth.
[23:24.790 --> 23:30.390]  Very, very important. Pretty much. You can always add potassium almost always.
[23:31.510 --> 23:38.150]  The plants preferentially take it up. Adding calcium, you do have kind of a window to get that
[23:38.150 --> 23:47.670]  in. And that also follows water. So getting your irrigation tight in, that is one of the only
[23:47.670 --> 23:54.550]  nutrients that is taken up by water. If there's a water issue, it can severely hinder your calcium
[23:54.550 --> 24:01.190]  uptake. Understanding the boron calcium relationship as well. Having more boron
[24:02.150 --> 24:08.310]  being applied at the same time with calcium is also hugely beneficial, but adding boron straight
[24:08.310 --> 24:14.470]  up with a calcium deficiency can add burning or it can, you can see burning from that. So
[24:15.190 --> 24:21.270]  understanding also how to apply, when to apply and in the combination of nutrients,
[24:21.270 --> 24:27.990]  very, very important. I've seen lots of hemp cannabis sap analysis where
[24:30.070 --> 24:36.390]  people were over applying a boron to the point of burning and they did bring it back down though.
[24:36.390 --> 24:42.310]  And they were really extremely able to get their calcium up with good water though, with having
[24:42.310 --> 24:47.590]  your bicarbs down. Another suggestion, if you're treating your water, you must be treating it for a
[24:47.590 --> 24:53.030]  purpose. I'm not sure what you are treating it for, but I would test that water every year.
[24:53.990 --> 24:59.190]  We see people saying, absolutely. I have no idea where my chlorides are coming from. We have treated
[24:59.190 --> 25:08.630]  water. They finally, as a last resort, test their treated water and their water treatment process has
[25:09.110 --> 25:15.750]  shut down somewhere and allowing the chloride to come in. So I would test that once a year.
[25:16.470 --> 25:24.230]  If you're running even an industrial water filtration system, you should always have an EC,
[25:24.230 --> 25:29.430]  PPM and pH pen. So you can check on that equipment and make sure there's no failures.
[25:29.430 --> 25:34.150]  And you have to remember a lot of these things have membranes and filters that have to be
[25:35.030 --> 25:41.430]  constantly changed out, or you're going to essentially just be wasting water and it's not
[25:41.430 --> 25:47.910]  going to be doing anything. Again, as a consultant, one of the biggest things that I see is
[25:47.910 --> 25:57.350]  water management being one of the biggest issues for operating the living organic cultivation style
[25:57.830 --> 26:05.110]  at scale. In sap analysis, when you look at the calcium, if there's a big difference between the
[26:05.110 --> 26:11.830]  new leaf and the old leaf calcium uptake, many times it's a water issue. And that's why I would
[26:11.830 --> 26:19.030]  go right to what's happening with my water. Yeah. I also know that some of the nutrients
[26:19.030 --> 26:30.070]  are going to be higher or lower depending on your VPD and that the rate of uptake as far
[26:30.710 --> 26:36.230]  will actually enhance things like I think copper and boron if I'm not mistaken.
[26:38.550 --> 26:45.830]  Okay. Another thing to consider is when you get your calcium under control imbalance,
[26:46.790 --> 26:52.150]  it usually just enhances actually most nutrients being taken up because calcium
[26:53.590 --> 27:00.070]  in a balanced system increases the plant's vascular system. So it not only is involved
[27:00.070 --> 27:07.030]  in cell division and not only is it made up of the guard cells in the stomata to open and close
[27:07.030 --> 27:14.550]  and vent your plants, it's the entire vascular system, which increases many nutrients, not just
[27:14.550 --> 27:22.070]  calcium. So I have a question for you. I was just thinking about because I am a huge advocate of
[27:25.030 --> 27:32.070]  amino acids, protein hydrolysates as a single source for nitrogen because they're one
[27:32.070 --> 27:40.230]  biologically available. They increase the soil biome. You can use them as a foiler. You can use
[27:40.230 --> 27:48.790]  them as a top dress. You can water them in. And because plants expend a large amount of metabolic
[27:48.790 --> 27:56.710]  energy converting nitrogen into amino acids into complex proteins, using amino acids is like a
[27:56.710 --> 28:03.590]  biological hack where you're able to give them the amino acids in a biological form so they don't
[28:03.670 --> 28:10.550]  have to expend the energy to synthesize the amino acids from nitrogen. What this also allows
[28:11.350 --> 28:19.350]  for in a leaf tissue test analysis is you will not have high nitrogen levels, but you will have high
[28:19.990 --> 28:27.190]  amino acid protein levels. This is beneficial because this also makes it
[28:27.750 --> 28:34.550]  less, it makes it more difficult for pathogens and feeding insects because they're not, they're
[28:34.550 --> 28:41.910]  trying to feed off of the nitrogen substances that are in these plants. And therefore, if they're not
[28:41.910 --> 28:49.510]  in a form that they can consume, it gives them, you know, it basically there's no food source.
[28:50.070 --> 28:57.590]  Right. So if you want to talk about nitrogen breakdown, as Tyler also said, there are a few
[28:57.590 --> 29:07.350]  forms of nitrogen, not just nitrogen. SAP analysis tests total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrogen as nitrate,
[29:07.350 --> 29:12.790]  which is stripping off oxygen and ammonium, which you can also strip off the hydrogen.
[29:12.870 --> 29:19.350]  When you are looking at SAP analysis and the nitrogen breakdown, you really would like to
[29:19.350 --> 29:27.030]  compare apples to apples. So you need to strip off the oxygen of the nitrate to look at nitrogen as
[29:27.030 --> 29:34.550]  nitrate. We actually do that for you, or you can divide nitrate by 4.43, which strips off the
[29:35.510 --> 29:43.190]  oxygen. Then you can compare N nitrogen as in as nitrate to total N to see how your plants are
[29:43.190 --> 29:53.990]  complex. Many times people look at total nitrogen and nitrate with the three oxygens and that
[29:53.990 --> 29:59.990]  nitrate numbers is large because of the oxygen. And they were like, oh my goodness, there's something
[30:00.070 --> 30:05.350]  wrong. I was like, well, you got to strip off the oxygen first. And then you can compare apples to
[30:05.350 --> 30:12.710]  apples. If you want to do a complete comparison, then you need to strip off the hydrogen and
[30:12.710 --> 30:19.990]  ammonium, but hydrogen doesn't really weigh anything. So you really don't have to strip it
[30:19.990 --> 30:25.590]  off if you don't want to, but those oxygens, boy, those oxygens really do have a larger atomic mass.
[30:25.670 --> 30:32.070]  So stripping off the oxygen before you do a comparison of the nitrogen as nitrate and total N.
[30:33.670 --> 30:43.190]  So the nitrate part of it, if you're using the fish, if you're using amino acids and proteins,
[30:43.830 --> 30:49.910]  really the only nitrate you should be seeing in your sap analysis profile is anything the
[30:50.470 --> 30:59.270]  plants are taking up from the soil or from the air. But your nitrate should be incredibly low
[30:59.830 --> 31:07.350]  and you have a nice balanced total N number. Your total N number is nitrate, it's ammonium,
[31:07.350 --> 31:09.990]  it's amino acids and proteins and urea.
[31:10.630 --> 31:17.830]  So have you looked at tests where you know the cultivator is strictly using something like
[31:17.830 --> 31:29.830]  soy hydrolysate as their nitrogen source? I just look at the numbers and most people
[31:30.070 --> 31:36.790]  don't give me a call and say, you know what, my plants look amazing. Thank you so much
[31:36.790 --> 31:43.830]  and it's been a wonderful day. I get calls when there are big red flags, when there's symptoms,
[31:43.830 --> 31:51.830]  when there's a problem, unfortunately. So I get a call when the plant is doing well,
[31:52.550 --> 32:00.550]  there's usually a insufficient nitrogen breakdown and it's fairly easy to see very fast that your
[32:00.550 --> 32:07.990]  nitrate numbers, your NO3 numbers, not stripping off the oxygen, is equal to or higher than total
[32:07.990 --> 32:13.590]  N. You can do that, you don't even have to do any math, you can just see, oh my goodness,
[32:13.590 --> 32:20.710]  if that's the case, then you're doing a good job. So I get a call when I'm not sure what's going on
[32:21.430 --> 32:28.870]  if that is the case, your plant is not breaking down your nitrogen. So in big ag, when I talk
[32:28.870 --> 32:38.710]  about really large acres, for every dollar that you put out of nitrogen, if you're not complexing
[32:38.710 --> 32:47.590]  your nitrate, that means 50 cents of every dollar, if it's at 50% level, is just being thrown away
[32:47.590 --> 32:55.270]  and that's incredibly bad on the budget. That also is going to complex the budget even more
[32:55.270 --> 33:00.070]  because then you're going to bring in the pests at that point. You're also going to have low
[33:00.070 --> 33:09.590]  plant structure. My understanding too could be that also if the levels are over the total
[33:09.590 --> 33:17.270]  nitrogen, it could also be a molybdenum problem where molybdenum isn't high enough
[33:20.150 --> 33:27.190]  for the enzymatic pathway so that they need to convert the nitrogen. Absolutely. So molybdenum
[33:27.190 --> 33:35.030]  is a nitrogen reductase cofactor and it is one of the ones that helps to reduce nitrate. So
[33:35.030 --> 33:41.110]  absolutely, if you don't have molybdenum. Other ... Hi, up there.
[33:42.950 --> 33:46.710]  That's what I'm half paying attention to right now. So I just wanted everyone to see
[33:46.710 --> 33:54.470]  what's going on in Peter's world right now. Other nitrogen breakdown nutrients to try to
[33:54.470 --> 34:02.550]  understand and try to fix the problem of not being able to break down nitrogen would be iron. Iron
[34:02.550 --> 34:08.070]  is another one. Up to 70% of iron is used in the nitrogen reductase pathway while you're building
[34:08.070 --> 34:15.350]  structure. Sulfur is another one and your macronutrient magnesium. Zinc is included in
[34:15.350 --> 34:26.070]  there and also a little bit of copper as well. That's typically why you see those even micronutrients
[34:26.150 --> 34:34.630]  a little bit higher than some of the other micronutrients. The zinc, the copper,
[34:35.910 --> 34:40.070]  I usually see them a little bit higher. They function a little better at higher levels than
[34:40.070 --> 34:49.510]  some of the other micronutrients. Absolutely. And that's great that you're even able to get
[34:50.150 --> 34:56.670]  a nutrient such as iron into the plant at higher levels because if you ...
[35:00.190 --> 35:06.990]  So the plant takes in the reduced form, but many times people are putting on the oxidized form,
[35:06.990 --> 35:15.150]  which is highly unhelpful and you will not take it up. So understanding that. And that's another
[35:16.030 --> 35:24.030]  that's another situation where tissue and sap analysis differ is that tissue actually looks at
[35:24.030 --> 35:29.310]  the oxidized form because they have applied heat and they're looking at the nutrients that are
[35:29.310 --> 35:36.350]  incorporated into the cell walls, which is the oxidized form. Sap analysis looks at the unincorporated
[35:36.990 --> 35:46.510]  a form of iron, which is the reduced form. So many times if you're looking at a tissue test,
[35:46.510 --> 35:53.710]  you can see higher levels of iron where in fact they are not available to the plant anymore.
[35:54.510 --> 36:02.350]  And you cannot rely upon that form of iron to help in breaking down nitrogen.
[36:02.350 --> 36:05.710]  Yeah. That's interesting that you say that because my last
[36:07.550 --> 36:15.790]  leaf tissue test I did, it was really high in iron and it was actually after I had started using
[36:16.430 --> 36:22.190]  applications of trichoderma with bacillus subtilis, which I know trichoderma produce
[36:22.190 --> 36:27.230]  cytophores, which are high affinity iron chelating compounds.
[36:28.190 --> 36:33.790]  So I know that there are a couple of ways that biologically you can get some of these
[36:33.790 --> 36:40.830]  mineral elements. I haven't started doing the sap analysis, which I'm really glad that I'm here
[36:40.830 --> 36:46.190]  and talking to you directly because I'm going to be using your lab within the next couple of
[36:46.190 --> 36:51.710]  weeks to start sending off samples. And then I also know that phosphorus,
[36:51.950 --> 36:58.430]  uh, you could see really high levels in soil, but it doesn't fall into solution because it's
[36:58.430 --> 37:05.470]  biologically cycled in most cases, which can be done very, very effectively with the right types
[37:05.470 --> 37:11.390]  of consortiums of microorganisms that will release, you know, phosphorus reductase compounds.
[37:11.950 --> 37:17.790]  Absolutely. Also temperature, soil temperature has a big, big play in phosphorus. One of the biggest,
[37:18.510 --> 37:24.190]  um, uh, soil, uh, or temperature dependent nutrients is phosphorus.
[37:25.950 --> 37:30.350]  Never thought of it from, uh, those, those standpoints from a temperature standpoint,
[37:30.990 --> 37:32.830]  I definitely like to hear a little bit more.
[37:33.390 --> 37:36.670]  Can you talk about what happens at higher and lower temperatures?
[37:38.270 --> 37:38.510]  Yes.
[37:39.070 --> 37:54.190]  At soil temperatures around, uh, 55 ish, uh, 50, 55, uh, phosphorus is really unavailable.
[37:54.190 --> 38:01.070]  And, um, as you increase your soil temperature, phosphorus becomes more available. Um, so,
[38:01.070 --> 38:08.110]  you know, just as the bigger picture, the broader picture, um, if you're using soil microbes to help
[38:09.390 --> 38:17.310]  bring phosphorus, uh, to create, uh, phosphorus into, uh, being better uptake by the plant.
[38:17.310 --> 38:23.630]  Um, so soil microbes also slow down at these temperatures as well. So if that's what you're
[38:23.630 --> 38:30.030]  relying upon and it's cooled out, um, the microbes aren't really helping to take up the phosphorus
[38:30.030 --> 38:35.150]  because they've slowed down or went into dormancy as well. So just kind of the full circle.
[38:36.030 --> 38:42.830]  So I wonder if nutrients weren't available when you get down to those low temperatures
[38:42.830 --> 38:47.950]  is in the plant stop cycling nutrients when the root temperature root zone is below 55 degrees.
[38:49.390 --> 38:57.310]  And if you're, if you're, yes, if you're, um, if you're relying upon soil microbes though,
[38:57.310 --> 39:03.790]  that, that, that is even more the case because they slow down as well. So, um,
[39:04.030 --> 39:11.630]  in my experience, we see a lot of people watering with a cold, cold well water directly out of 300
[39:11.630 --> 39:18.190]  to 600 deep wells that are sometimes 47 degrees. Um, my buddy, Eric Branstad with forever flower,
[39:18.190 --> 39:23.230]  or excuse me, with a greenhouse advisory group now, um, was in bringing that to light for the
[39:23.230 --> 39:28.910]  last 10 years. Um, showing people about how the temperatures, um, really massively affect the
[39:28.910 --> 39:34.270]  happiness of your plants and the uptakes of nutrients, um, mind blooms information there.
[39:34.270 --> 39:41.950]  Yeah. And that's really good to bring up. You know, we have the same issue at our farm out here
[39:41.950 --> 39:49.390]  in Oklahoma. And so what we did to mitigate that issue is we have like 375 gallons square tanks
[39:50.110 --> 39:56.910]  and we run our, you know, huge tanks into our greenhouses where they hold that way.
[39:56.910 --> 40:02.110]  The temperatures aren't cold and we keep them highly aerated and oxygenated at all times.
[40:02.670 --> 40:06.590]  So that way we don't have the problem of, you know, when we're watching, cause we do a lot
[40:06.590 --> 40:10.990]  of biological inoculations using, doing some of the crop steering methodologies that I've
[40:10.990 --> 40:15.390]  kind of come up with, with, you know, using different microbes at certain times. And,
[40:16.110 --> 40:25.710]  um, you know, these are endospores, uh, a lot that are suspended in solution and they're viable
[40:25.710 --> 40:30.910]  and they're the most active between certain temperature and humidity ranges. And it's very
[40:30.910 --> 40:39.070]  similar to culturing microbes in something like a bacterial or mycology incubator or growing
[40:39.070 --> 40:45.950]  mushrooms even because you're trying to build these populations in soil to assist in the
[40:45.950 --> 40:52.910]  nutrient cycling capacity of these soils, especially things like I've seen great,
[40:52.910 --> 40:57.870]  great success with making iron biologically available, phosphorus and manganese.
[40:58.590 --> 41:07.070]  And even though I might have low availability on soil tests, what I see on saturated paste
[41:07.070 --> 41:13.390]  tests is that the availability of these are really good. Although I'm not applying any
[41:13.390 --> 41:21.790]  type of mineral amendment for phosphorus or for manganese. Um, and I do apply, you know,
[41:21.790 --> 41:27.310]  and I look at, you know, the, the soil and the saturated paste tests and I, you know, add in
[41:28.030 --> 41:32.830]  things as I need them, top dress them in or water them in if they're micronutrients.
[41:32.830 --> 41:38.030]  Iskra I think the biggest thing is what can we get rid of when you use these tests? What can,
[41:38.030 --> 41:43.310]  how much of these things can we stop using and stop spending money on? Because we've got a test
[41:43.310 --> 41:48.590]  and we know everything's there. It's like the ROI that we can really get into. It's like,
[41:48.590 --> 41:53.870]  we got into living soil because we want to save money and reuse the soil over and over and over
[41:53.870 --> 42:00.030]  and watch it build up over time. So it's like, if we can use these tools and start eliminating,
[42:00.030 --> 42:04.350]  buying stuff and stop, you know, and saying, okay, this round we're stacking this, this,
[42:04.350 --> 42:08.110]  and this up. And you know what, Hey, we only need this, this, and this. And we knocked off
[42:08.110 --> 42:12.750]  two things from last time, you know, next cycle. Oh, we knocked off another thing. Boom. So,
[42:13.310 --> 42:17.550]  um, I think that's a big thing is what can we stop spending money on by utilizing these tools?
[42:17.870 --> 42:23.710]  Yeah. You know, and that's a good, another good point. And one of the reasons why I switched and
[42:23.710 --> 42:28.430]  gone into organic cannabis to begin with was because prices were dropping. I had to figure
[42:28.430 --> 42:33.870]  out a way to decrease my overhead and nutrient inputs, especially when you're paying for,
[42:33.870 --> 42:42.030]  you know, 95% water just wasn't a viable solution for me anymore. Um, you know, it, it really,
[42:42.750 --> 42:48.750]  it's really interesting too, because with the way that I cultivate doing the living soils,
[42:48.750 --> 42:57.950]  I S you know, I could spend money up front on something like 50 pounds of gypsum for,
[42:57.950 --> 43:04.750]  you know, $14 or 50 pounds of magnesium sulfate for $15. There's all these things that cost maybe
[43:04.750 --> 43:14.910]  15 to $50 for like 50 pounds. And it's actually cheaper to grow commercially because you can buy
[43:14.910 --> 43:22.830]  larger quantities of your inputs for far less. And the actual amount of mineral nutrient input,
[43:22.830 --> 43:30.990]  if I'm using something like soya bore or, uh, uh, iron sulfate, the actual amounts that I'm using
[43:30.990 --> 43:33.790]  are so minuscule. I'm talking about like tablespoons.
[43:33.790 --> 43:34.910]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Oh, even when you get into
[43:34.910 --> 43:39.470]  foliar spraying, I mean, we're using, you know, we're taking these micro macro nutrients and
[43:39.470 --> 43:44.350]  thank God for companies like alpha chemical, because you can go into alpha chemical and buy
[43:44.350 --> 43:50.590]  a pound of copper sulfate for $3. I've used the same pound of copper sulfate now forever. And now
[43:50.590 --> 43:54.830]  what I'm getting dialed into is, is talking to some of the consultants that Jenny's referred us
[43:54.830 --> 44:00.430]  to and to how to build these foliar sprays properly, which truly is a science in itself.
[44:00.430 --> 44:04.430]  Because, you know, if you, you know, I kind of had my little thing down of like, okay,
[44:04.430 --> 44:08.030]  I could do two grams of this, two grams of this, two grams of this, two grams of that,
[44:08.030 --> 44:12.430]  mix it all together. And then all my stats are still correct because like, and you're building
[44:12.430 --> 44:16.270]  a foliar spray for a mineral nutrients, we should be looking at the pH. We should be looking at the
[44:16.270 --> 44:21.310]  EC. We should be looking at the PPMs as you're adding each one of those items and stacking those
[44:21.310 --> 44:24.590]  together and making sure they don't go off the rockers. Because if you're going to foliar spray
[44:24.590 --> 44:28.750]  something and it ends up having a pH of like 10 or 12, you're really going to screw things up.
[44:28.750 --> 44:33.630]  You know, we really want to make sure we're in that happy zone of six to 6.5 and we've got the
[44:33.630 --> 44:39.150]  proper ECs. Um, you know, it's, it's not only that too, right. Cause then you have to balance all
[44:39.150 --> 44:43.710]  those and then you have to be able to figure out a way to hold them in solution so that they don't
[44:43.710 --> 44:49.870]  interact with each other and oxidize, or there's no oxygen reductase things going on. So being able
[44:49.950 --> 44:55.390]  to chelate those minerals is really important too, so that they weren't, they're not interacting
[44:55.390 --> 45:00.670]  with each other. That way when they get to that plant, they're already in the right ratios.
[45:00.670 --> 45:06.030]  So what I've found overall is like, you can do this once a week and get a whole bunch of stress
[45:06.030 --> 45:10.510]  going on trying to combine all these things and do all that kind of stuff. And David Olson was
[45:10.510 --> 45:15.870]  like, why don't you just spray one thing at a time, once a day and just cycle through those.
[45:15.870 --> 45:20.670]  And I was like, Oh my God, like, thank you, man. So, you know, one day I'd hit it with iron,
[45:20.670 --> 45:26.030]  one day I'd hit it with the copper. And I think that was just so much easier because, uh, and
[45:26.030 --> 45:33.070]  it's, it's so like the efficiency of mineral spraying, spraying minerals is crazy. Like they
[45:33.070 --> 45:38.590]  were saying, you can track copper from the top of the leaf down to the roots in like seconds.
[45:39.230 --> 45:44.510]  So, and Jenny can break down some of those stats that are just mind blowing about how fast some of
[45:44.510 --> 45:48.670]  these nutrients can move through the plant and how little of it you actually need, you know,
[45:48.670 --> 45:52.910]  getting down to some of these guys that are spraying, you know, two acres with two gallons of
[45:52.910 --> 45:58.270]  water. And it's like, how is that possible? Well, that's because it's a mineral foliar spray and
[45:58.270 --> 46:03.070]  you don't have to cover the whole plant. I mean, we can literally just get that off the top of the
[46:03.070 --> 46:06.590]  plant, spray it on the top of the plant throughout the leaves. Like I'm walking through my greenhouse
[46:06.590 --> 46:11.150]  and my sprayer above my head, I got 10, 15 foot tall plants. I'm just like, ah, like this, trying
[46:11.150 --> 46:15.230]  to get it from the top to come down, you know, compared to an IPM spray where you're like, oh my
[46:15.230 --> 46:19.310]  God, I've got to hit the bottom of every single leaf, you know, and get this going, do all that.
[46:19.310 --> 46:24.270]  You know, there's like a different kind of mind frame when you're feeding minerals and feeding
[46:24.270 --> 46:29.230]  nutrients. And it goes into the podcast I did with Scott from Crested Soil the other day, is he's
[46:29.230 --> 46:34.670]  completely gotten away from IPM sprays. And now he's like, we're, we're spraying the plant for
[46:35.310 --> 46:41.790]  food, for nutrients in place of those IPM things, because if we're constantly feeding the plant,
[46:41.790 --> 46:46.190]  there's no chance for those things to come in and have problems. Which I'm being very vague,
[46:46.190 --> 46:53.150]  please watch the podcast. But I'd like to, like Jenny to talk about how fast some of these
[46:53.150 --> 46:58.350]  nutrients can move through the plant, because I think that is absolutely mind blowing as far as
[46:58.350 --> 47:01.710]  just general plant science goes. And it is super interesting.
[47:02.190 --> 47:09.470]  Well, cobalt can move through the plant within seconds, just like you said. But coming in
[47:10.030 --> 47:18.190]  to sap analysis and really understand nutrient mobility, NPK, magnesium, sodium, and chloride,
[47:18.830 --> 47:26.110]  is you can really understand what the plant needs and wants when you start to read mobility.
[47:26.750 --> 47:33.230]  When the plant has too much of a nutrient of NPK, magnesium, sodium, and chloride,
[47:33.230 --> 47:39.790]  you will have an excess in the lower leaves. And because there's so many varieties in this crop,
[47:39.790 --> 47:46.350]  it's really important to read mobility. If you're starting in your mobile elements,
[47:47.070 --> 47:52.510]  to really have an excess in your lower leaves, your older yet viable leaves,
[47:53.310 --> 47:59.230]  this is areas that you can cut back in. This is where if you're doing testing and you want to cut
[47:59.230 --> 48:05.070]  back in your budget, that the plant is telling you, I have built up an excess. I now have enough
[48:05.070 --> 48:12.750]  NPK, magnesium. I'm actually pushing chloride to the lower leaves. And if it's sodium pushing sodium,
[48:13.630 --> 48:21.470]  you can cut back on your NPK, magnesium fairly rapidly, but you need to earn the right.
[48:21.470 --> 48:28.350]  So test, look at your excesses, and that's where you can really, really understand how the plant is
[48:28.350 --> 48:35.950]  moving it around and storing it. In the reverse, reading your mobile elements, if the new leaves
[48:37.310 --> 48:43.710]  have an excess or have more parts per million than the older leaves, that means at the time
[48:43.710 --> 48:49.870]  of sampling, the plant did not have enough of those nutrients. And so it started to steal from itself.
[48:51.870 --> 48:59.230]  You'll find the macro element, mobile symptoms. These are the ones, NPK, magnesium that
[48:59.230 --> 49:06.990]  sap analysis will give you a window to try to level that imbalance because once those really
[49:06.990 --> 49:10.830]  get out of imbalance, that's when you see the symptoms and that's where the stress comes.
[49:10.830 --> 49:18.590]  So if you can see, wow, your phosphorus is really, really getting low, but your potassium is leveling
[49:18.590 --> 49:25.870]  out, well, stop adding potassium, put your money into your FOS, take a few sap samples and really
[49:25.870 --> 49:32.990]  see how the plant is moving around those elements because they are mobile and you can see the
[49:32.990 --> 49:40.430]  numbers change really within two weeks. If you apply a foliar and or something through drip
[49:40.430 --> 49:46.990]  and input, wait three days, take sap analysis, you can see the movement if the plant is indeed
[49:46.990 --> 49:51.710]  taking it up. And if the plant's not taking it up, then you need to find a new input.
[49:56.790 --> 50:02.390]  Sending over a little chart of what leaves look like when they're deficient, which I'm sure
[50:02.390 --> 50:07.750]  everybody's seen a lot of those deficiency charts, but this kind of just goes a little bit further
[50:07.750 --> 50:15.110]  for this conversation today and showing, you know, when that you get that supposed fall fade,
[50:15.830 --> 50:20.790]  which I've proven myself to get rid of on my farm. So no fall fade, I think that's a bunch of BS.
[50:24.710 --> 50:27.750]  And I've also shared with Peter a couple of pictures of my greenhouse and my beautiful
[50:27.750 --> 50:34.550]  plants if he wants to share those. So I think we were talking about fall fade and that's really
[50:35.110 --> 50:42.710]  where sap analysis can come in. You can chart your nitrogen over the season and again, that would be
[50:42.710 --> 50:49.110]  one that you would be able to cut back on, especially going into the fall. Stop once you
[50:49.670 --> 50:56.550]  reach the structure that you need, get a handle on your nitrogen and stop adding it. That's one of
[50:56.550 --> 51:04.790]  the biggest overages, over application of nutrients I see in this crop and in a lot of crops is
[51:04.790 --> 51:12.470]  nitrogen. And being able to cut back and reduce, possibly look at different forms of nitrogen,
[51:13.270 --> 51:19.350]  that would be another area to cut back and monitor quite a bit. One of the biggest.
[51:20.470 --> 51:24.710]  And the general overall health of the plants in the cannabis community,
[51:26.390 --> 51:31.030]  it's pretty interesting. We judge plants on the level of, you know, one to 32,
[51:31.030 --> 51:35.110]  which is a BRX level, which is the measurement of sugar inside the plant.
[51:37.350 --> 51:40.390]  Go ahead. Correct me, please. Straighten me out, girl.
[51:41.350 --> 51:49.350]  No, BRX is a measure of soluble solids. So actually, BRX many times if you're looking at,
[51:49.350 --> 51:56.150]  say, grapes, the actual grape, they call it berry in the industry, that's really when BRX more
[51:56.150 --> 52:02.230]  equates to the measure of sugar. But when you're looking at leaves, it's the soluble solids.
[52:02.230 --> 52:08.790]  So in fact, you could have a high BRX number made up of salt. And that's definitely not what you
[52:08.790 --> 52:17.430]  want. So take a look. Actually, our sap analysis shows you sugar and BRX. So if they're not
[52:17.430 --> 52:23.670]  matching or having the same pattern, that's a red flag. Also, if you have high chlorides,
[52:23.670 --> 52:29.830]  that's another one that means that your BRX can be made up of a lot more salt than
[52:30.390 --> 52:35.670]  you may have known or thought about. Yeah, because if Peter pulls up my test,
[52:35.670 --> 52:41.510]  and you can see my BRX was like 8.6 or 8 point something. And my plant health was just amazing.
[52:41.510 --> 52:47.670]  And just like, I can't imagine what's going to happen if I get to 12 or I know for 24.
[52:48.230 --> 52:54.390]  So I've been testing BRX with a standard reflectometer since I think around 2000.
[52:55.110 --> 52:58.870]  Want to escalate and get higher every time it's going to do it's up and it's down,
[52:58.870 --> 53:04.150]  it's up and it's down. But we want that up to get up and get higher and higher and higher.
[53:04.870 --> 53:11.510]  I mean, I have still have my BRX meter in my truck. I hardly use it. But I typically get around
[53:11.510 --> 53:19.270]  20%. I know that my sodium is pretty low and my soil and saturated paste,
[53:19.910 --> 53:26.150]  leaf tissue doesn't show a hole, it's not in access. So they are, I mean, you can get it high.
[53:26.150 --> 53:33.030]  But there's a huge debate about, you know, the way that insects see and I'd love to bring on
[53:33.030 --> 53:38.710]  Matthew Gates, my friend. And he will tell you all about how plants evolved and that they have
[53:38.710 --> 53:45.670]  actually specific gut microflora bacteria that will actually process different things. So,
[53:47.110 --> 53:55.270]  you know, you can't use BRX as a gauge to say my plant has a high BRX and therefore it is
[53:55.270 --> 54:03.030]  resistant to pests and pathogens. But we do know, obviously, that, you know, healthier plants that,
[54:03.830 --> 54:10.630]  you know, have good microbial communities will have things like acquired immunoresistance,
[54:11.190 --> 54:17.430]  systemic acquired resistance. They unlock kind of the genetic potential of that plant and they
[54:17.430 --> 54:23.590]  can and you know, with proper nutritional imbalance, that plants will be more optimal to
[54:23.590 --> 54:30.470]  be able to fight off any type of pressure, whether it's insect or pathogen related.
[54:31.350 --> 54:38.550]  I agree. Something new that New Age is doing this year is actually we're doing a sugar panel.
[54:38.550 --> 54:46.870]  So there have been requests in the fruit industry to see what is that sugar number made up? Is it
[54:46.870 --> 54:53.350]  sucrose? Is it fructose? Is it glucose? Which one? So that is something new that New Age is
[54:54.310 --> 55:02.630]  doing this year. Just to let you know, if you're really interested in the ratios of your sugar
[55:02.630 --> 55:09.030]  number, what that's made of, we can do that. I think that when you start to do that, you'll see
[55:09.030 --> 55:14.950]  fluctuations over periods of time over the plant life cycle and probably even over the time after
[55:14.950 --> 55:19.430]  the leaf has been picked because, you know, they start going through different metabolic processes
[55:20.150 --> 55:26.790]  as those things degrade. So I would imagine that the different complexes probably start breaking
[55:26.790 --> 55:42.050]  down into simpler compounds. That's something we're introducing and it's fun. It's interesting.
[55:42.050 --> 55:49.650]  We're continually adding new things. We can also do heavy metals in sap. So you don't have to wait
[55:49.650 --> 55:56.370]  to the end to test product. We can test heavy metals off the season in sap and you do not have
[55:56.370 --> 56:03.890]  to take another sample. We can test for heavy metals in the same sample that we can do nutrients
[56:03.890 --> 56:12.130]  in. Oh, that's really big. And I think that will be a huge help, especially for organic growers.
[56:12.130 --> 56:19.810]  One of the things that I see constantly and that I've heard of constantly happening is organic
[56:19.810 --> 56:27.010]  growers failing for heavy metals, specifically arsenic and cadmium. And the problem is the
[56:27.010 --> 56:32.850]  inputs typically because people like to use liquid kelp meals and lots of kelp. And you have to
[56:32.850 --> 56:40.050]  remember kelp is a massive, massive bioaccumulator. That stuff grows at sometimes three, four feet per
[56:40.050 --> 56:46.770]  day. So everything that that thing can take up, it's taken up. And if you're using that in excess
[56:46.770 --> 56:54.770]  quantities, you could potentially contaminate your soil, contaminate your product. And another
[56:54.770 --> 57:00.290]  thing is another reason why I don't use animal products is bone meals can potentially contain
[57:00.290 --> 57:08.370]  cadmium. And that's another reason why I try to stick with plant inputs, plant and mineral inputs
[57:08.450 --> 57:20.770]  for the cultivation and organic production. You can see that. All right. We're coming to the hour,
[57:21.330 --> 57:25.090]  sir. Anything else you guys want to go over? Any questions?
[57:25.810 --> 57:32.770]  Well, do you guys want to show your... I have all your graphics. I don't know who...
[57:33.570 --> 57:40.210]  Tyler, is this one you? I can't really see anything.
[57:40.210 --> 57:46.050]  I can't either. That's Tyler's. Tyler, that's yours.
[57:47.970 --> 57:52.770]  This is? It was done 4-26?
[57:53.650 --> 58:00.610]  Yeah. 4-26. 4-26? Oh, that must be...
[58:00.930 --> 58:03.970]  Oh. The date, time, sample.
[58:03.970 --> 58:06.930]  That's tomatoes. Oh, that's tomatoes. Sorry.
[58:06.930 --> 58:13.410]  But we can go over that. No problem. This is 7-14-2020?
[58:14.770 --> 58:16.930]  Ice cream cake. Okay.
[58:19.650 --> 58:25.170]  So what are you seeing here? Hold on. I am... Okay, here we go.
[58:26.130 --> 58:30.130]  Yes. Tyler, yes. Go.
[58:32.050 --> 58:34.370]  Go ahead, Jenny. Oh, no, because these are your plants.
[58:34.370 --> 58:38.450]  I'll just follow up. Well, looking at it, if you scroll down
[58:38.450 --> 58:44.690]  a little bit further, Peter, to the main nuts and bolts here, which is the minerals down towards the
[58:44.690 --> 58:52.850]  bottom, is what was lacking. The nitrogen down there too. So you can see the nitrogen was just
[58:52.850 --> 58:58.130]  totally maxed out right there at this point. So it's like if I were to feed any more nitrogen,
[58:58.930 --> 59:05.090]  it would have caused some major issues. And at this time, I still had about a month left of veg.
[59:05.090 --> 59:09.250]  So you're like, you got a month left of veg and you're not going to feed any more nitrogen?
[59:09.250 --> 59:12.770]  Well, I used this test to dictate, tell me that there was plenty of nitrogen in my soil.
[59:13.570 --> 59:19.250]  I did take a saturated paste test and amend my soil off of that. I send that over to GrowRoo.
[59:19.250 --> 59:25.890]  GrowRoo analyzes that for $45 and gives me a write up of list amendments to fix in my soil and add to that.
[59:27.170 --> 59:32.450]  And then based off of that, I still had a lot of issues here. As you can see, my zinc was very low.
[59:33.650 --> 59:37.810]  The iron was very low. But what's kind of important is Jenny should kind of take a moment
[59:37.810 --> 59:42.290]  and break down this test and show, tell us why we've got two different green bars here at two
[59:42.290 --> 59:47.730]  different levels and how we compare these things as well, which is always something I love hearing again.
[59:48.370 --> 59:56.050]  Yeah. On a comparative sap analysis, the light green bar is your new leaf. So think of it
[59:57.170 --> 01:00:04.370]  as on the top of the plant. So at the top is your light green bar. Your dark green bar is your old
[01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:13.490]  leaf at the bottom of the plant. As you take sap analysis throughout this, I actually get away from
[01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:22.210]  the bars and I just start looking at comparative numbers as you get better and better at reading
[01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:39.490]  these. So the top would be, let's see, we have sugar, bricks, pH and EC. And again, so your
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:48.530]  your sugar and your bricks are following one another as where you have higher sugar in the
[01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:55.570]  sugar breakdown and in the bricks breakdown. When that is opposite, when you have a lower sugar and
[01:00:55.570 --> 01:01:02.130]  higher bricks, which I do see, that's when you need to start thinking, what is my bricks being
[01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:09.330]  made out of? Because sugar is going up or sugar is going down and bricks is going up. That's
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:14.290]  problematic right now. Then you need to start thinking about your photosynthesis at that point.
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:24.930]  So here, slight problem as the chlorides are lower in the new leaf and higher in the old. So the
[01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:31.330]  plant said, I am maxing out at 2000 parts per million of the new leaf. And it started to push
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:38.130]  chlorides down to the old leaf. You do need chloride for photosynthesis. You don't need
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:44.770]  that much of it. The plant had reached its maximum and chlorides stopped being a nutrient
[01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:51.650]  and at this point started to become toxic. So when especially this right here, because hemp and
[01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:57.970]  cannabis is a chloride accumulator, this is very important. As you take sap analysis throughout the
[01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:03.330]  season, this, if you do have an issue with chlorides, it usually just starts to go up and
[01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:11.090]  it never goes back down. So understanding that you can watch your chlorides in your new leaf,
[01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.650]  it will increase, it will increase, it will increase. And then you'll reach a turning point
[01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:20.450]  where they'd be almost even, which they kind of are now. And then it'll start to go back down the
[01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:26.530]  other way where the new leaf, the plant has reached its maximum in the new leaves and starts to push
[01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:34.050]  down in the old. At that point, you're reaching a toxicity level. Because of the high amount of
[01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:41.010]  chloride in these anions, you do have an anion imbalance of sulfur and especially of phosphorus.
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:50.370]  They still are okay ranges, but phosphorus is a mobile nutrient. There is more in the new leaves
[01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:55.330]  than there are in the old leaves. At this point in time, the plant was stealing from itself,
[01:02:55.330 --> 01:03:00.850]  taking the phosphorus out of the old leaves to suffice its need for the new leaves.
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:11.810]  So that's what you see a lot, that anion number, this imbalance right here is very,
[01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:20.210]  I see it time and time and time again. And one of the ways to combat that is to understand to
[01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:25.330]  get phosphorus in early because the plant will only continue to take up chloride.
[01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.130]  And you can't miss your window.
[01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:35.810]  What? You can't miss your window up front. Yes. Calcium and going into your
[01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:44.130]  cations, that's positively charged. Calcium is a immobile nutrient. So most of your symptoms
[01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:50.050]  with your MPK magnesium you see at the bottom of the plant. Calcium deficiency, you actually
[01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:55.810]  see at the top of the plant. When you see the leaf burn, the tip of the leaf burn,
[01:03:56.850 --> 01:04:01.810]  there's also other features, but that's one of the deficiencies and it's at the top of the plant
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:06.690]  because it's immobile, which means the plant starts to fill calcium from the bottom up,
[01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:13.490]  it runs out of calcium. And those new leaves that have thin, thinner cells, obviously,
[01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:17.650]  because the calcium didn't get up that far, they're susceptible to burning.
[01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:24.610]  So to read that one, the closer those numbers are together in calcium, the closer the parts
[01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:30.850]  per million are, which, um, I learned did a really good job. They're, they're fairly close.
[01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:37.730]  Is that means you're getting adequate calcium every day. The plant has to calcium up every
[01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:44.050]  single day. It cannot take from its old leaves every day. It will draw upon calcium through the
[01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:50.770]  roots. And if it's not there, then you start to get a calcium deficiency. Again, it is not able
[01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:57.730]  to take the calcium from the old leaves and move it to the new leaves, unlike MPK and magnesium.
[01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:02.850]  So basically you're saying that the old leaves feed first, basically at the bottom.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:08.770]  Yes. And then once they've had their fill, they let the remaining calcium pass to the new leaves
[01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:14.610]  and they've not enough calcium overall is coming in. Then the old leaves take it all and leave
[01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:19.810]  nothing for the new leaves. That's correct. So if you're feeding calcium as a foliar,
[01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:28.370]  that's great. And you can get some calcium in that way. But, um, the, the, the, the,
[01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:34.290]  then I won't say bad thing, but the thing that doesn't work about calcium foliar feeding is if
[01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:39.730]  you don't take calcium up through the roots, cause calcium only moves one way is up is you're not
[01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:45.330]  increasing your vascular system. So you're not helping out the whole entire plant's vascular
[01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:52.690]  system to actually take up other nutrients. So when you've, um, when calcium is fed different ways,
[01:05:52.770 --> 01:06:02.130]  um, just keeping all that in mind. Um, here, the potassium, this is a really, really heavy,
[01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:09.330]  heavy feeder of potassium at this point right now, because this is feeding so heavily. Um,
[01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:13.890]  you might want to add a little bit more cause you have really great calcium numbers by the way.
[01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:21.010]  Excellent. Usually 5,000 potassium is quite high. Um, this is a very, very, very heavy feeder.
[01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.450]  Um, you could take one more sap analysis and see if this plant is actually gonna
[01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:34.370]  write itself and start to take up more potassium. Um, but it's great that because you have a calcium,
[01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:43.170]  uh, deficiency, it's also actually helping with your calcium efficiency. So those two,
[01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:49.490]  um, especially in veg, you can have decreased potassium, which is very helpful,
[01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:54.850]  helpful for calcium uptake. And then you kind of want to see that change a little bit. Yes.
[01:06:55.810 --> 01:07:01.890]  Yes, you do. But calcium is one of the easiest nutrients to add as we're, uh, if you're deficient
[01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:07.330]  in calcium going into flour, I don't want to say it's impossible, but it's pretty,
[01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:18.780]  pretty difficult to get your calcium numbers up at that point. Um, and then, um, let's see
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:24.780]  magnesium here. Magnesium looks outstanding. Uh, you have a little bit of surplus in the old
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:30.540]  leaves, which means the plants are able to call the magnesium up at any time from those old leaves.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:36.300]  That's outstanding. That's right. What you want. And then sodium, uh, below 20 parts per million.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:44.140]  That's fantastic. There's hardly any at all, which is exactly. So, um, those are your macros.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:53.660]  Um, and your trace elements, uh, boron looks nice and tidy, uh, cobalt. So you probably want at
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:08:00.540]  least half a part per million there. Um, copper was really good in the beginning, but copper is
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:05.100]  really not very mobile. So it looks like, uh, you're going to have to add a little bit more,
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.780]  uh, to get it up to the new leaves. Copper is really not able, uh, to take from the old leaves
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:17.580]  and move it to the new leaves very well at all. Iron, um, iron is deficient and probably one of
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:25.340]  the main reasons that, um, this plant, these, the sugars are probably because of the iron deficiency.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:32.220]  Yeah. Iron is responsible for part of the photosynthetic process with nitrogen. Yep. And
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.660]  you have to have not iron up front. Absolutely. With young plants, when they're building structure,
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.300]  um, that's usually when people are applying the most nitrogen, but if you don't have the
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:48.380]  little tiny puzzle pieces, um, to bring the nitrogen puzzle together and you don't have a
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.940]  bridge to break down your nitrogen very well. And that's really important. Again, when you're
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:09:00.380]  building structure of a tomato plant of a, um, you know, hemp cannabis plant of a pepper plant,
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.220]  um, in the beginning, you're building structure and you really want to be able to utilize the
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:10.860]  nitrogen that you're putting in. And iron is incredibly helpful, beneficial, and needed during
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:21.580]  that time. Um, manganese is great. Um, you would probably want quite a bit more. Um, manganese is
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:30.460]  synergistic with potassium. So, uh, the more manganese you have, absolutely nowhere near,
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:37.100]  um, it makes, um, manganese makes potassium more efficient. So it's, um, it's kind of like,
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:41.420]  uh, either you have a two-year-old that's helping you water the plants. And of course,
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:47.580]  they're going to turn on the water full steam ahead and somebody's going to get wet, or you have,
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:55.260]  um, possibly a teenager or somebody else on the water faucet, um, manning the flow rate and, uh,
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:01.260]  you get more efficient watering. It's the same manganese is that person at the water spout to,
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:07.340]  to help the potassium regulation. And you're actually saying that you recommend a higher PPM
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:15.180]  than the point. Oh yeah, for sure. Manganese is, is so needed. It's the master micronutrient.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:20.540]  It's the king of micronutrients by far. What is your recommended, uh, I have,
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:26.540]  I have something different on my records. That's why I'm curious, uh, what your,
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.940]  for SAP analysis, SAP and tissue are going to be different because tissue is more,
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:42.140]  yeah. Okay. So the tissue leaf tissue and then SAP are going to be different numbers.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:49.100]  Absolutely. Um, they're going to be different numbers because, um, tissue is historical.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:55.260]  You're snapshot, right? Yeah. And it's, it's, what's been incorporated and continues to
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:04.460]  incorporate it into the leaf tissue. SAP analysis is like the guy in a truck having a slurpee and
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:10.300]  it's the straw it's what's, it's, what's being taken up. Um, so it will oscillate, go up and down,
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:19.180]  temperature, and, um, also, uh, phase of growth, especially, um, uh, calcium, you know, in veg
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:27.980]  time. So just, just keeping that in mind, um, tissue is more of a, uh, a sum at the end,
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:33.020]  accumulation. SAP analysis is not like that. It's, it's the day.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:39.980]  So it's like daily light integral or daily light, whatever. And part like what,
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:44.300]  whatever the snapshot of light per second or per whatever.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.780]  When you're sick, doctor, he takes your blood and looks at your levels, you know, and looks at
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.940]  immediately what's going on with you to diagnose your situation. That's how I look at it. But with
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:12:00.220]  plants, yeah, that that's correct. So if you're going to use tissue and SAP together, um, a benefit
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:07.020]  a benefit, if you're, if you're, if you're, you're doing really well and just, um, want,
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.580]  wanting to move over to tissue, but definitely just, you, you don't want to throw out your,
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:18.060]  your, um, your, your tissue results is that you kind of have the end game, you know,
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.020]  kind of where you want to be because you've been taking tissue for a while. Well, SAP analysis
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:28.140]  fills in the gaps of, um, measuring throughout the season and how, how to get to that end game.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:35.100]  Um, rather than taking these bursts, these snapshots of tissue, SAP analysis is more
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:41.020]  smooth and steady on, on, on how to get that sulfur X, right? So if you have, you know,
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:48.380]  a target range for your leaf tissue analysis, how do those target ranges transfer over to the SAP
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:55.740]  analysis? How do you have your own graph that's built off of data sets where you say, this is the,
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:13:00.860]  the, you know, are you working with growers who can visually say, Hey, this is the best that we've
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:06.620]  ever done. These are the numbers or how has, how is it working? And how can you translate those
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:11.660]  numbers over to like, okay, so these are my target ranges. This is what I want to hit using the SAP
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:23.100]  tests. Well, that's a big question. Um, there are so many varieties, uh, in hemp cannabis, just
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:28.780]  so many and they feed differently. Um, yes, we do.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:36.140]  So let's assume that we have a variety that we already have an SOP for, we have all its target
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:42.540]  levels. We know what those are and we have those already in place. As far as tissue and our
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:47.740]  saturated pace are, you know, continually every week, everything is falling to solution in place.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:53.500]  And we have all that data. That's kind of like what I'm asking is like, how will that correlate?
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:59.020]  Cause I can look at the, the saturate, uh, saturated pace and say, Hey, this is what I
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.940]  need to add in my soil. How do I translate the SAP into, this is what I need to add into my soil.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:17.020]  Yeah. So that, because SAP analysis is fluid, very pun intended there. Um, the correlation
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:24.780]  is a little bit more upon the grower and really looking at mobility. SAP will tell you
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:35.260]  very, very distinctly. Um, so as right now, uh, phosphorus in what we just looked at is 170 in
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:41.980]  the new leaves, 140 in the old leaves. Uh, tissue analysis would probably give you that upper number
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:49.260]  that 170 you're in the good you're in, you're in the good range. So you could look away and say,
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:55.180]  Hey, I'm doing great with tissue tests. It will not show you the other half of the story. Well,
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.660]  that plant has really good phosphorus in the new leaves because it's been stealing from the old
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:08.620]  leaves. Um, so because you have these fluid numbers, uh, I would look at mobility over,
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:19.500]  over optimums. This plant is telling you I am stealing from the old leaves. I am going deficient.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:28.940]  And then looking at your anion, uh, balance, you're out of balance. So that, um, quite possibly
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:37.180]  if you had less chlorides, you actually might have more phosphorus. So it's really the law
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:45.180]  of the minimums, but then you need to ask why. So based on this, uh, SAP analysis, yes, you're low
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:51.420]  on phosphorus, but instead of just going to go apply phosphorus, maybe ask the question,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.260]  why am I low on phosphorus? Look at the whole picture. And that's what SAP analysis gives you.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:05.820]  You're not only low, but you have an anion that's potentially blocking it. So I know that's not
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:12.300]  exactly the answer that you're looking for, but, um, this phosphorus number could change.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.780]  If you took care of your chloride number without even adding any, because there's blocking,
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:24.940]  you could have plenty of phosphorus in your soil. It's not getting in. Um,
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:29.500]  and that's where the saturated paste test would come in because I could see if it was in solution,
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:34.060]  but if I'm looking at the tissue analysis and it's not making it into the tissue, then you could see
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:39.100]  there's an antagonist somewhere in there. And then we can look at all of the other cations,
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:45.820]  all the other ion anions and see if something is high, that would be the culprit to understanding
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:50.780]  why this isn't this particular nutrient isn't translocating into the plant. Right.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:17:00.220]  Yeah. So understanding that, um, I would start graphing these things, um, young versus old.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:08.220]  If you can keep your phosphorus right on top of one another, um, let's see, you're at this plant
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:16.140]  likes to be at 170. So, um, especially in the veg state. So a few samples in the, in,
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:22.220]  and you're keeping it right around 170 in the young and the old, that's exactly where you want
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:30.780]  to be. The plant has told you, I am going to move as much phosphorus to the optimum area where I
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:39.100]  need it to be. And that is 170. That's it. The plant moved the phosphorus there. So it's more
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:44.300]  plant specific and targeting, especially when you start looking at mobility.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:52.060]  And this should also allow you to correlate a visual symptom with something that's happening
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:59.100]  in the plant. If you have nitrogen, uh, or, you know, like you said, if your phosphorus was
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:07.020]  deficiency and it's pulling from your lowers, you should see your lower leaves becoming deficient
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:15.020]  in phosphorus as it's used up by newer growth while it's taken by newer growth. So this is one
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:22.380]  way to correlate visual symptoms with data as well. Correct. Correct. But at this phase in the
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:30.220]  game, it is not that deficient, 170 over 140. You usually wouldn't see symptoms at that time.
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:36.700]  And this is where SAP analysis gives you that window of opportunity to start working on your
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:42.220]  balances instead of waiting for those deficiency symptoms to occur. Because as soon as you, as soon
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:49.340]  as you see a phosphorus deficiency, you're low, you're, you're, you're, you're red flag. Yeah.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:53.340]  And that's where the stress comes. You don't, that's what you want to avoid.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:59.100]  Okay. So that's really interesting. So that's, it's good to know that, you know,
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:08.220]  having this type of analysis and analytics is going to allow you to correct problems before
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:14.060]  they ever become issues. That's where you, that's where you want to take it. That's where the being
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:20.780]  proactive, um, if you're starting to see symptoms, of course, yes, correlate it with your SAP analysis,
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:25.740]  but you really, you really don't want to go that far. That's, that's highly stressful on the plant.
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.780]  And if you're seeing those issues with phosphorus, you're usually seeing an
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:36.940]  exorbitant amount of chloride. And that, that is a much, much bigger problem, um, to try.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:46.300]  Take a second and talk about, uh, the cost of sending in the sample and, and how much
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:52.700]  leaf material we need to send them in to be able to do that. Cause we've got people on small scales
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:57.580]  that are doing this, but you have to have enough leaf material to send in to qualify for the test.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:06.220]  Yep. We need 80 grams of new leaf and 80 grams of old leaf, uh, in separate Ziploc bags for a
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:14.380]  combined weight of 160 pounds or 160 grams. Sorry. The Ziploc bag weighs approximately
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:21.260]  five to seven grams. So if you take a bag of, um, new yet fully developed leaves and pop it
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:29.020]  on your scale at the very end, if you, if that scale reads 97 or 93 grams, you should have enough,
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:38.380]  including the bag. Um, if you don't have enough, uh, leaf material, um, we usually can get nitrogen
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:45.020]  for you. Um, sometimes your, uh, trace elements are, are not going to be able to be analyzed,
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.660]  especially in the new leaf. Um, usually cause there's not very much there to begin with.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:56.780]  But, um, if, if by any chance you, you sent us not enough leaf material, we will call you, email you,
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:02.540]  text you and let you make the decision if you'd like to run it or not. We, we try not to make
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:11.660]  that decision for you. Um, so sending in a single leaf, um, or a single sap analysis, uh, that would
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:21.980]  be $87, but again, um, using it, the sap analysis is made to, to, to be, to used, um, a few times,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:29.740]  at least three or four times in, in a season. So, um, that one time that really, that would
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:38.300]  be more correlative to say your really low, uh, low day growth would be like baby spinach, 28 days,
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:46.700]  really only have time for one, maybe two sap analysis. So, um, if you buy 10 or more sap analysis,
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:55.580]  the price drop down to 70, um, which is a pretty big price drop. And, um, most growers can use 70,
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.500]  um, or, or use 10 sap analysis, no problem. They, they use usually quite a bit more,
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:07.980]  but, um, you do get that price break. I do suggest if even you're going to even come
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:15.580]  close to using 10 to, to pay, to, to pay that, um, for those 10, because it's a significant
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:25.180]  difference between $87 and 70. So, um, you can overnight it to us and you can two day, two day
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:29.900]  to us. We do not take, um, unless we're in the state of Michigan, we do not take,
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:35.340]  uh, uh, bud or flower just to let you know leaves. And you can contact me
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:43.020]  if you'd like to talk further about it. We do have protocols and, um, I'm also available for
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.820]  if you're out in the field to FaceTime, especially for your very first sampling. So you can get it
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:52.940]  right. Things like that. Talk it over. It's very, very important to take it in the morning,
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:58.140]  between seven and 11 and or seven and 80 degrees, whatever comes first.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:07.020]  Um, taking it after that, uh, the sample efficacy goes down. You do need to treat it like somebody
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:13.820]  made you an amazing sandwich or lunch and put it in the cooler and keep it nice and, and, um,
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:19.740]  refrigerated. You cannot treat it like tissue and put it in a paper bag and throw it upon your dash
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:25.180]  and drive around all day. That's not going to work. The nitrogen will probably volatilize.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:31.740]  And then you'll come back with a nitrate of zero and then it will move up into the ammonium form.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:39.020]  And then y'all look like blueberry growth. Oh, um, I can see that happening. Um, I can see that
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.700]  in the data and I will give somebody a call and, and ask how the, how the leaves were sampled.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.660]  And somebody will most likely say that they forgot their cooler.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:54.780]  So you have to mail your samples in a preferably a chilled styrofoam container,
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:02.220]  maybe a flat rate box or something like that. Yeah. Yes. And I can talk individually on, uh,
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:09.260]  for people for how, how many samples they're, they're going to take, um, for how to do that
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:15.420]  efficiently shipping. But, uh, in order to get this level of testing, we do need those,
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:19.660]  those samples to stay cool. We do not take frozen samples. I mean, we'll take them,
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:26.140]  but we'll also throw them away. Um, if you disrupt the cells, uh, kind of like, um, spinach or lettuce
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:32.780]  what is, was in the crisper in the, um, in the refrigerator and the refrigerator accidentally
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:39.500]  broke and froze and you take out that limp lettuce, that limp, um, leafy green, and it just
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:45.340]  looks like canned spinach. Uh, the cell disruption had occurred and you can never get it back. And
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:52.060]  we, there's, we can no longer run sap analysis on a sample that has been frozen. Uh, many times
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:57.420]  we'll not many times, but people that do freeze their samples, um, of course, when they get to
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:03.420]  the lab, they're Brown. So it's very, very, and much very, very easy to see when, um, there's,
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.180]  uh, roster, um, freeze damage.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:12.700]  There's a couple of questions in chat there. Uh, yes, this is wet weight that you're sending in.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:18.300]  Usually I would fill a one gallon Ziploc bag and it would always be over the weight that was needed.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:23.260]  Um, another one that was in there was do one gallon. Wow. That's a lot of samples that we,
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:27.580]  we'd need 80 grams, one gallon. If they're filling one gallon,
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:34.060]  one gallon is what I send, send in typically every time. And it was just, you know, big,
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.780]  big leafs in there and stuff like that. So that's typically too much. You were saying,
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:43.020]  um, it's not too much. It's just that, um, people that are trying to sample several times,
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.900]  several samples or sample varieties side by side, I just want to be able to cut down the time for
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:55.740]  them because their time is, is valuable. So, um, really 95, a hundred grams. Um, if you're filling
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:01.020]  a gallon size bag, that's, that's fabulous. I mean, that's wonderful. But if you would try to
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:06.780]  decrease your time, um, you can definitely do that. That's good. I think it just depends on the
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:11.100]  strain and the density of the leaves too. You know, some people are going to have super small,
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.580]  dense leaves. It can, you know, fill up that weight a lot faster than, than other things.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:21.100]  Um, be a big difference there. Um, and then I saw another, uh, comment in chat. Do any of
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:25.500]  these tests indicate whether taking clones from the top of the plant or the bottom of the plant
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:32.220]  is beneficial? And from other tests that I've seen, uh, you know, taking clones from bottom,
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.980]  middle, top, just, they all end up having the same rooting time. So, uh, typically like the
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.460]  bottom of the plant has the longest rooting time, middle is about the middle and the top of the
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.180]  plant, uh, we've seen to have the fastest rooting times possible from what I've seen. I'm not an
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:54.700]  expert. I'm sure it has a lot to do with, uh, phytohormones in the different areas of the
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.380]  plants. Uh, another question. Do you separate old leaves versus new leaves? Um, and yes,
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:06.380]  that's very important to send in a bag. That's a new leaves off of the top of the plant. And then
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:11.500]  a bag of old leaves typically from the bottom of the plant. Um, that's how they can compare
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.940]  and look at these nutrient levels and actually make this test ethical.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:20.300]  Yep. And for new leaves, we want to be able to give that leaf a high five. We want, we want that
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:26.540]  leaf to be flat. So if you can't give that leaf a high five, um, it's too young. If you, if you
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:31.820]  take your new leaf samples too young, what is generally going to happen is you're going to have
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:38.140]  lower calcium, um, and lower trace elements. So you're going to have, um, again, the efficacy of
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:44.860]  the test is kind of decreased and you could have adequate or, or beginning to have adequate
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:52.220]  amounts of calcium. And yet you took, um, a leaf that was too young and it, because, um, calcium is
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:28:00.140]  not mobile. That's usually the, uh, the, the lowest, um, calcium, uh, areas is at the top.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:04.860]  So it's really important to, um, to be able to give your leaves a high five, please.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:13.580]  Oh, and no wet leaves. Cut them off or don't sample in the rain, which I've had to do,
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:19.420]  but don't wipe them. We're not cleaning them. Um, you, you're, you're, you're not drying them.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:24.860]  Like you've given your dog a bath. We're not doing any of that. You're patting them dry. Um,
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:29.900]  if you're, if, if, if there was dew on them and you've, you've got a truck, a lot of times I'm out
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.940]  in the field and I'll tell people to flip down that, that tailgate and put a whole roll of paper
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:40.220]  towels and put all your leaves out on those paper towels and then make a paper towel sandwich and
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:45.580]  put the paper towels over the top and just start patting. Um, that's a really great, efficient,
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:57.180]  um, time saving way to leave. I always like to put leaf samples usually with a clean,
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:02.940]  unbleached, uh, with no paper towel just to prevent any type of mold contamination.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:15.020]  Um, we ask, unless you do that overnight, um, we, we don't actually like our, our samples,
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:23.340]  our leaves, um, to be sent with a paper towel. Um, it, it pulls the moisture away. Sometimes it
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:32.300]  can actually induce our, uh, it, it, it can, and it, it's not good. We, we, we, we don't want any
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:39.660]  of the samples to be, uh, I guess insulated with paper towels inside the, the Ziploc bag, if that's
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.740]  what you're asking. If you're putting those, if you're putting the paper towel in there, because
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:49.740]  there's moisture along the walls of the Ziploc bag, either use a new Ziploc bag or take the paper
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:55.980]  towel and dab it, but please don't send in, um, samples with that, that wet paper towel. We've,
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:02.380]  we've seen some disastrous results. Um, again, sap analysis is a little bit more tricky. Um,
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:10.460]  we, we do need viable leaves. We do need them to be, um, supple. We, we definitely don't want the
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:19.580]  older leaves to, uh, be crispy and limp because we need to express the sap from it. So if that is,
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:26.540]  happening with your older leaves, please take one note above that. And, um, we, it, it's really not
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:33.660]  about the wet way. It's not about the leaf tissue. We are looking to express the, um, the sap. We have
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:40.540]  made this protocol because in general, if people send us young yet fully, fully photosynthetic
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:47.580]  leaves and old yet viable leaves, um, 80 grams or more, we can express the amount of sap, sap
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.140]  we need to run the analysis. What other kind of testing do you guys do, Jenny?
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:59.500]  Um, we do heavy metals. Like I said, we do heavy metals in the sap. Um, we also,
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:05.500]  if you're looking at using new products or vetting old products or new products, and you really
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.860]  want to see any hidden, any hidden ingredients, you're trying to maybe track down where your
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:18.540]  aluminum is coming from or your chlorides. Um, we can run analyses on that as well. Um, we can do
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:26.300]  soil and water and we, we also are environmental lab. We will go into a, um, in-house, uh, indoor
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:34.060]  growth facility, do swabbing, um, things of that nature. We have, um, on our website, um, you can
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.740]  contact me. I'm happy to give you a complete breakdown of, of everything we do. We did start
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:46.140]  as an environmental lab actually. And, um, we've, I think we've been doing sap analysis for three
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:53.660]  years now. So we're moving into the agricultural world, but we're so, um, highly certified. It
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:32:00.700]  really wasn't a problem at all. Usually when you go, um, into the agriculture, uh, realm, it's,
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:07.020]  it's, uh, when you come from the point of certification where we were environmentally,
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:11.100]  it just wasn't that hard to make the bridges. We had all the sort of community.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:19.980]  So, um, Thursdays is our heavy metal days. So, um, many times laboratories do not run heavy metals
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:26.220]  all week long. Uh, heavy metals are, they're expensive to run. The machines are really, um,
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.940]  they're expensive to calibrate. They're time consuming. So most agricultural laboratories,
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:36.380]  unless they are specifically heavy metals, they have a heavy metals day. So our heavy metals
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:42.140]  Thursday, just to let you know. So if you do send in a sample and we don't get back to you until
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:48.300]  Friday, it's because Thursday is the only day that we run heavy metals. So I had it set up where I
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:53.340]  sent in my samples every Monday was the shipping day. And then that was where they were getting to
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:58.620]  you guys in Michigan by like Tuesday or Wednesday, and then allowing you guys to do all of your
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:03.660]  processing and getting us a turnaround. I think I'd get my tests results by two or three o'clock
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:08.700]  on Friday. So I'd send in my sample on Monday, get it back by Friday. So if you were a local
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:13.900]  customer and I was like, lived in the same town as you guys, what would be like the latest point
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:17.900]  during the week? I could drop it off. Would that be like a Wednesday or something? Um,
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:23.740]  no, it would be Thursday morning. Oh, wow. Thursday morning. And we would run it. We only
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:30.060]  run SAP analysis, um, eight to noon. We start a SAP analysis. We'll run it all day, but we will
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:37.900]  not start a SAP analysis after 1 p.m. Um, we don't have enough time in the daytime to do that.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:42.940]  So that would, so many times actually people that do live in the area in Michigan, they just,
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:49.100]  they, they drive over, uh, they sample and they give, they give this, uh, they give us their
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:55.180]  samples to the lab the same day and then they have 24 hour turnaround. That's pretty fast.
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:00.380]  It's pretty cool. Again, because there's no heat involved. That's one of the, um,
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:06.220]  for a flower out here to have turnarounds like that.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.980]  That would, that would, I mean, we're, that'd be great.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.260]  I'm going to end this one here, guys. We're, well, it just ended with myself and back out
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:20.700]  here. I got to go to an appointment. I hope you guys still continue if you want to.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.820]  Okay. I probably wrap it up as well. Um, it's getting pretty late here. So
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:32.140]  an hour and a half is a good, I think someone a while ago said they have like brain, they have
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:37.660]  lockout in their brain from all the information they're getting. And that was like an hour ago.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:46.620]  So we, we can, this is like part one of the conversation. We can do a part duh. Uh,
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:52.300]  uh, cause we didn't even get it. Like I'm interested kind of different plants and like
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:58.540]  what you noticed about how they take up nutrients and what like shard likes versus carrots versus
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.740]  cannabis versus whatever. But, uh,
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:08.060]  I'm doing this testing on my vegetable farm this year too. Um, yeah.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.340]  Well, I mean, you mentioned chard, it's a heliphyte. So it's, uh, it's in only 2% of the
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.020]  plants are, are heliphytes. So those are interesting to look at.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:25.740]  And I like cooking with it. So, uh, so just quickly before we wrap, uh, I think tomorrow
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:33.580]  we have Tad Hussey and Ben Higgins, uh, from Kiss Organics, uh, Wednesday, speaking of Matthew
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:44.380]  Gates, he's going to be talking solo on, uh, the cannabis, uh, microbiome. And then next Wednesday,
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:50.940]  he's going to be talking IPM Thursday. I don't know who we have, uh, but for now I'm going to
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:58.780]  go kick it on the couch for a little bit and see what's going on outside in the 80 degree LA
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.460]  weather. I hear the construction. That's the neighbor has been going all day. I was like,
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:12.940]  you asshole. It's a fucking holiday. And he's like, on IG. So you can kind of see, uh, what
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:20.540]  I'm doing out here on, um, in Oklahoma too. All right. I could, uh, anyway, uh, appreciate the,
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:26.380]  uh, platform. It was really great talking to you guys, a lot of information, and I'm really,
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:32.220]  really looking forward to doing SAP analysis, uh, here starting in a couple of weeks.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.540]  And Jenny, you're going to be flooded with samples from all over the world. So get ready for it.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:43.420]  Fabulous. Perfect. I look forward to it. Thank you for having me. Thank you everyone for taking
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:49.820]  the time. I appreciate it. Thanks for doing it. All right. See everyone. Okay. All right.
