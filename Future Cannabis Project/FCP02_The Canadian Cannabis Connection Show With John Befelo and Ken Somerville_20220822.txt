You're 10 seconds early.
Hi guys, welcome to the Canadian Tennis Connection Show.
There's John.
Oh, he's gotta do pushups and I'm gonna go do 10 too.
There you go.
You know what, I even got a friend in the house,
he's gonna be doing some pushups as we're doing it.
So, we got the pushup challenge going on.
What we do every day, remember?
Keep it going.
So, I mean, we can keep talking.
Yeah, I'm just doing mine.
You got them down?
Yeah, I just did 10.
Well, you know what, I'm gonna do 15 today, I think.
Okay, cool.
I've already done 60, 70, 80 this morning,
so now I'm at 95.
And I only need to do 117 a day.
Whoa, who's that guy?
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Hey.
We got a special guest, Brendan.
And if you've ever been on my YouTube channel,
there's a video and we call it the Christmas Room.
Yep.
I think it's got about two and a half million views,
something like that.
It's got a lot of stuff going on on that thing.
But we talk about this Christmas Room.
We talk about, wow.
I don't think you guys have ever seen that,
you've seen the Christmas Room,
but we would talk about how,
remember when we built the wall six inches away from it,
we built a room beside it?
Yep, an exact room.
Exact room.
Didn't get that fucking white.
Nope.
Nope.
Couldn't figure out why.
We thought, this is the Christmas Room.
You should talk to us about that, you know?
Well, it's just a room that you get three pounds of light,
nobody really understood why.
Three pounds of light, no one understood why.
And this is back like a decade ago, right?
Like, of course, there's planes,
there's trains, automobiles everywhere.
But it was one of those rooms,
and of course we were talking with Ken about this
before we went live.
Well, I was like, Ken, we gotta stop talking,
because I want to talk on the show about what we did here.
And it wasn't what we did, it was what this guy did,
it's what he understood.
Well, it's not even what I understood,
it's what VPD actually is.
It's what VPD really actually is.
It's sitting in my dorm room here,
what was that, just before COVID a couple years ago?
And we looked at each other like, that room had VPD.
We didn't even realize it.
It had perfect VPD.
Perfect VPD.
We could not get, it was a low 70%.
It would always stand at 70, no matter what.
I mean, I remember you would burn sulfur in there
just because we thought it might get PM.
Because we thought, and it never did.
Like, oh yeah, we burn sulfur in the room,
we never get PM.
The room beside it would get PM.
Yeah.
What the fuck?
Because it had, we cut the humidity,
it went what, 55?
Well no, the humidity would stay at 65 to 70
because that was the lowest we could get
with one big D-hum in there.
That's right, we couldn't get things down.
Like, there's certain things that went on in that room.
But understanding VPD was such a major thing
that we never knew back then,
because if we would have known that,
we said it would have been kings on the block.
Well, the other room would have been the same then.
Exactly.
Oh, so, I mean, it's just pretty fun to sit here
and talk about it and really start understanding VPD
and going with LEDs.
So, I mean, we had a big change.
You see, I mean, you know what?
You've been behind the watering wand
for a little bit of time, haven't you?
I started growing in 1993.
There you go, 93.
I think I was 88, so.
Yeah, and yeah.
Have a look back.
And I mean, you deal with severe arthritis,
you deal with some pretty, I mean, you.
I medicate with cannabis.
Yeah, you should smell this one,
so you can recognize this flavor.
So, our friend here came through this outdoors,
so he doesn't live in Seoul, but do you remember the smell?
Okay, I'm not gonna pretend that I do.
No, what is it?
Okay, I say New York City Diesel.
Oh, okay.
That smells good.
It's cured nicely.
It's cured nicely, it's outdoor.
So, he keeps it in a bin.
I mean, I got the original MKU here.
Yeah.
I know it's a long smell.
Well, this was the 3.2 pounds of light
in the Christmas room.
3.2 pounds of light in the Christmas room, guys.
That's why we were talking about this.
He goes, you got the strain?
I go, of course you still have the strain.
You got the strain?
I go, I'll get the strain for ya.
Made the call.
What are you doing on your way home?
Picking it up.
Picking it up?
Yep.
All right, on, right on.
I've had this strain.
So, that came out of the room,
that was the phenol hunt of looking,
we wrote the Death Bubba, the Greenhouse Bubba,
we had the MK, there were all different types of the M,
we just had an M1, M2, M3, M4.
And the M4 phenol that I chose,
that it became the MKU,
because it looked like a U.
It's kind of funny.
Yeah.
And this is that strain.
This is the phenol hunt from back in those days.
This is the-
From 2010.
2010, that was 12 years ago.
And this is that cut that,
we call it the MKU and it's gassy.
It's got-
I think they're rolling out.
Yeah, they're gonna roll out.
Oh, and then-
Sorry, I didn't enjoy it.
We're gonna laugh about this.
I think I just posted this on my Instagram.
This sat in my room for-
Before COVID.
Before COVID.
It goes, oh shit, my humidor, it's awesome.
Oh, but it's still full of weed.
It's fucking still green, it's fresh.
And then there's a-
Oh, it's a little-
Yeah.
After all that went.
After all that-
Oh my God.
The weed is good.
And in there, after all that time,
you pull this out here, guys, boom.
Saved the turps.
Did it save the turps?
It did.
Okay, so like proof is in the pudding.
Two and a half years later, I love that.
It just happened.
And as it happened, I actually did a video of it,
but showing you guys about saving the turps
and understanding that, I mean,
he's like, yeah, still smells like weed.
We smoked one, it burned perfect.
And that's why we have that hat, save the turps.
You know what's gonna be good about this
is you have another one of these put away.
Yes.
You got several of these.
So we should like sit this in here
and then come back every year
and burn one out of here for the next five years.
Until it's empty.
Until it's empty.
That would be a true test, wouldn't it, guys?
Because we know that the sage humidor is 100%.
I can tell you, this is not 100%.
This is airtight, but I guarantee it will leak
and it will dry out 100%.
This it will not.
Why?
Proof is in the putter.
Yeah, well, it's lined with cedar and has rubber gaskets.
Lined with cedar, rubber gasket, lined with cedar.
And where can we get those?
Or can we still get those somewhere?
He's telling me he left this here on my, huh?
Yeah, you can order them through Sage.
It's a rod company, a fishing rod company.
Fishing rod company.
Those are for cigars.
So if you have, okay, wait a second here.
You get a call right now.
This is one of the best fishing guides here.
Okay, I'm gonna say in the lower manor in Cannock.
Okay, so you have guys that come from all over the place.
You guys are pretty cool people.
Can you say some names?
I was fishing with a guy that's best buddies
with Jack Johnson last week.
There you go.
So Kerry's in that higher peer group of fishing
because if you look at his tattoos,
he's got every fish on his arm.
Cool, Kerry.
We did a lot of bottom,
and I'll see a lot of fishing back in the days
before our camp.
Yeah.
Just a lot of fun, but I mean,
when it comes down to growing and understanding the plant,
and that's what we're talking about.
We went in my room, and you'll see the videos right now.
I see some deficiencies, what's going on, what happened.
I added a product to try and prevent thrips.
Like we said, it caused it.
Right.
Definitely have some problems in the soils.
We're looking at potassium.
See?
That's potassium.
Potassium for sure, and deficiencies.
So we're not looking at overwatering
because the plants haven't been overwatered.
They ran, I ran that water through them every day.
They get the same amount of water.
And my pH levels were at six, and they were a little low.
So we're going to bump those up.
But we're just starting to see that all of a sudden,
the locking out, we saw some difference.
I did a video on this.
We talked about, talking about PPFD levels in the room,
and making sure you're not getting too much light
that we talked about.
Because I mean, your experience with LEDs in the beginning,
we're like, what?
Complete failure.
Yeah.
I mean, here's the guy getting three and a half pounds
of light, killing it.
He goes LEDs, and he's like, tearing crops out.
Like we talked about this.
I'm going there with my light meter, talking about it.
Like, you guys, like,
when we talk about understanding this shit.
There's only one way to live.
Well, John, when's your book,
you were talking something about,
you're getting some books of yours printed off.
When are those going to be available?
Because that's covering all of that.
And we really need that understanding and knowledge.
Well, yeah.
It's pretty much that basic knowledge of that person.
Like, if we would have got that book two years ago,
do you think we would have learned?
Well, the rooms would have balanced within a week, right?
We would have never had to lose like,
tens of thousands of dollars in reality.
And growing with LED is not growing with traditional bulbs.
They are apples, they're oranges.
There's no comparison.
Okay, so. Nothing.
You guys out there growing HPS go to LEDs,
and you think you know it?
You do not.
Okay, how long have you been growing for?
30.
30 years, yeah.
You know.
This is one of these golden moments.
This is one of these bomb droppers of an episode
that you're going to want to watch
and share with your friends to understand
and give them a slap.
LEDs is the new growing future.
It has changed.
This is pure gold.
This is why I wrote the book.
This is why I work with people like Harry
and some of the biggest people in the industry.
We've been doing this for decades.
We know what we see.
We see what we do.
And we give you the education
because we've been through the trenches.
We've taken the path.
We've done it because why?
Fucking love it.
Yeah, it's fun.
Well, yeah.
That's always, we sit here and talk about this
for so long, for the years and the decades
that I've known you.
Over the, it's over a decade now I've known you.
I mean, it's just been like,
it's always been fulfilling to look at how we've,
like bring back the old strains,
looking at the old genetics,
talking about what we've done, what we've seen,
and seeing where things are going now,
the future guys is really,
is in the change of understanding daily light integrals,
understanding the PPFD levels.
We went in there, he's adjust my lights.
We just did that.
We're talking about that.
I had him dim it at certain levels.
I talk about it dimming down in the fall.
So we get different PPFD levels
in like between week three to week six.
In the beginning, we've been seeing with bench stages
and stuff like that.
LEDs, like that's not in the book.
This is going to be in another book
because I don't want to get that detailed yet,
but you'll get that in the videos
when we start talking more about that
because you actually have a meter in your room
that measures those levels
and that's what Trulnast are, right?
So, I mean, I also have another one coming up,
which is going to be,
I got a hub, it's a Noia hub.
I'll talk more about this little hub that I have.
It's going to be great for your protein.
I'm going to be releasing that.
I don't really think it's out there,
but a guy Zachary's been really on me
and really pushing this awesome product
that I really like,
but I don't get the internet on my garage.
I haven't had it set up,
but we're going to explain that to you
and I'm going to show you that too
in a couple of these episodes coming up
and talk more about being able to control your VPFD
in small areas,
because it's a key,
because it's going to fluctuate like crazy.
It's going to drive you nuts.
So, we're going to talk more about that in small grow tents
and really get into that levels of,
you can't do it.
You change VPD,
you go through the signals.
You go through the rabbit hole, yeah.
Yeah.
You want to talk about that?
Banging your head against a wall
and going, why won't it bounce?
Okay, I did this.
You're going to see some more videos on.
Okay.
Oh yeah.
You know, you got to light that joint.
He made me look like,
why aren't you smoking that joint?
The look was, he didn't say anything.
He looked one time at me and I went,
what the fuck?
I'm like, sorry dude.
Like that's just, you know,
we've known each other for so long.
Well, you know John well enough.
If you wanted the joint,
you may as well roll your own, okay?
Not yet, but I'll give him one look first.
Two and a half years in a jar,
but probably cured.
Not two and a half years in a jar
from some legal cannabis company.
I let it dry up.
Yeah.
Weeping out.
Okay, so two and a half years in a jar.
Yeah, we got to burn one.
Oh, definitely.
Hey, you got your moisture meter handy?
Can you throw that in your moisture meter
and give it a test?
Well.
I mean, there are proofs in the pudding, baby.
Like you got the equipment.
Let's see what she's sitting at.
Yeah, I'm curious.
I fucking love this guy.
So, Kerry, you were mentioning in the Christmas room,
you weren't using an air conditioning unit
because that would have actually dried the air out.
You were using swamp coolers.
How did you build your swamp coolers and maintain them?
Well, I didn't buy them.
They're just made by a company called Keep Right
or there's many other commercial
that they use them in meat lockers.
Right.
But you charge them with Freon
and they make an air conditioning unit out of them.
I just ran, because where I live,
I had unlimited water.
I didn't pay for it.
I didn't.
I had a one inch line going into it
and just heading straight out into a rock pit
I had in my backyard.
So, it kept whatever city water temperature was,
which equated to the room,
never being able to get below 77, 78,
which when you look at the VPD chart with 70% humidity,
it was exactly perfect.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
You saw that, right?
Like that you love it.
Like, whoa, this is two and a half year week here.
Whoa.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
You strut around and brag to your buddies
that you got 3.25 pounds of light from a room that-
No one believed it.
Yeah.
Well, yeah.
So, we videoed weighing up one day.
I'm sure everyone saw that video.
I did.
But we really had no idea why
until all of a sudden the science of VPD came out
and it was just like, holy crap.
We just learned something after all these years, right?
And then, after that, I relocated.
I moved to the Okanagan and stuff.
So, I quit growing for five or six years.
When I came back, it was LED.
I didn't go back for traditional
and it was a learning curve of failure, man.
It sucked.
Yeah, like I said before, I ripped out my first two crops,
not knowing I was frying them with too high of PPFD.
Yeah.
Well, we are sitting and balancing at 55%.
After two and a half years.
After two and a half years,
which I say you don't want to go below 55.
That 55 is kind of like that membrane seal
of what Bobak talks about is that turf shield
that wants to maintain.
Yeah, like 65 ideally.
So, 65, he likes ideally because he likes sticky.
He's a very sticky.
I don't know how you cure your weed and stuff like that.
But if I look at a two and a half year cure
and it's still above 55% AW.
Yeah, that's good.
That's saving the turf right there, guys.
I gotta ask you a question, Josh.
I'm sure you guys are trusting it.
I don't have to move anything.
55.
55.
I have a question for you, John.
Would you want to throw in a new Boveda at that point
after two and a half years
or would you leave the one that's in there in that?
It's still fine.
Yeah, it's still soft.
And no moisture is escaping all that time.
So, I guess it should be fine.
Yeah, I would think.
It's just water.
Water doesn't go stale.
It's been in there.
It's probably got the turps in there now
because they've been in the same container
for two and a half years.
It's completely airtight, so it's saving it.
Maybe it will take it out to be able to keep that.
If it's airtight, but the air will actually
inside of that won't have the moisture
because now the AW will change,
which is the amount of water inside a container
to keep it fresh.
You understand that?
We just let it all out.
Exactly.
So, if you close it up, now we take the Boveda out,
it would be dry in two and a half years.
It's coming up to 56.
So, it hasn't stopped yet.
So, I was figuring it might come up to 56, 50.
I've seen it mostly around the 58 mark.
At a 62 and a 58 goes around 54.
And if you use Boost, 55, it goes down to about 40.
And I test this all the time, guys.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I have no reason to.
When you open up a container with Boost, it's done.
You have to throw it in the garbage.
That's it.
I will save the company because I didn't want to save it,
but I will save it.
Boost is a product that you have to use.
Once you open it, it is spent.
It is finished.
You have to throw it in the garbage, put another one in.
Every time you open the container, it's done.
Boost is a gel.
It's allowing it to keep the fresh, yes,
but it's in the business to keep things dry.
It's called Desicare.
It's a major, huge company.
So, now they're adding terpenes in it
to add fake terpenes into your weed.
So, depending if you like that,
then it's a product that you look at
because you can't use real cannabis terpenes in there.
And I'm pretty sure if they have, that's fantastic.
But there's ways of being able to take a look at products
and what they're used for.
So, if you've got a product that you know
is in a one-time use, Boost might be your ticket.
It's a little bit cheaper.
If you're looking for something you're maintaining
for a long time and opening and closing,
you're gonna wanna use a product that works,
which is Boveda.
So, that's saving the churps,
and that's just pretty much my testing over the last decade.
What I've done coming out in the fall
will be Boveda, curing cannabis, the Boveda experience.
And what we've talked about, what we've seen,
a lot of the stuff this guy here has mentioned in the book,
because we spent decades working together
and understanding this as a passion
and working together to really look at
how the plant is best for us
and how it's best for me to consume.
And then we share the information with you guys.
So, that's kind of pretty much what it is.
We've been doing this behind closed doors for decades.
But, like I say, now you get rewarded in public
for what you've been doing behind closed doors, dude.
And I'm looking forward to,
what's the name of your farm coming out here?
I think it's another plug.
Ranch, lands, and rivers.
Ranch, lands, and rivers.
Okay, guys, and what's your fishing company?
Blackwater Guiding.
Blackwater Guiding, there you go.
The fellow Kush will be part of this.
We've talked about this for how long?
10 years.
Over 10 years.
And this is something that...
Yeah, you guys got stuff rolled up for 20.
We got two minutes left.
Two minutes left.
You know what's happened is,
it sucks when my phone starts ringing
and it connects to my stupid laptop now.
So technology trumps everything here.
Yeah, yeah.
Can you see me?
So, Kerry, while he's playing there,
I'll ask you another question.
I know you guys were having trouble keeping the cameras on.
Tony can't join us today.
He's got a problem.
His mom's back in the hospital,
so he won't be able to join us.
But I know Tony, instead of directing the fan
down at the plants,
he actually turns his,
so the air is going against the roof.
So he's creating a different vortex in the air movement,
not blowing it right on the fans.
I know you guys were adding a whole bunch of extra fans.
Could that have been part of it as well?
I actually, I agree with aiming your fans at the ceiling.
I'm a huge believer in high ceilings
and you create your environment six feet above the plants.
So yes, you have air movement,
but it's only residual air movement around the plant.
All the big vortexes at the ceiling.
So back in the Christmas room,
it was never really directly on them.
It was at my lights, cooling my light bulbs as best I could.
Yeah, that was my thought behind that.
So yeah, I actually, it might be detrimental
even to blow a fan directly on a plant,
you beating it up a little bit,
maybe make the stalks a little thicker and tougher.
So maybe there's something to that.
Well, I always looked at, when I did my 21 day trim,
I tried to make sure that I didn't have two leaves touching,
cause you're ridding that microclimate, right?
But yeah, that air movement is so important in cannabis.
Yeah, I agree.
You gotta have it.
Well, if it's sitting,
you're gonna get fungus right in those corners, right?
You gotta have air.
What I do do though, is I have fans blowing on my floor
cause I grow in pots on the floor.
So I have fans in my row,
is moving the air around the base of the plant.
And then nothing directly on that.
Well, the plants are moving,
but there's nothing blowing directly on them.
That's where you get leaf burn.
We see that quite a bit in water gardens
and you'll see that,
cause people just don't understand leaf burn.
So, and that's normally through a lot of air,
happens when people blow fans directly on that.
So you get a lot of plastic.
They're right here, the fans are right here.
Yeah, that's no good.
It's like turning a fan off.
Put a fan on the bottom.
Or you can actually mount them in the ceiling.
So that's actually a good way.
If you have the money, you're illegal,
you're doing a big grow.
You don't want those fans on the walls or anything.
You want them in the ceiling, plum and simple.
Like when you walk into an office building,
you got fans in the ceilings.
You want the same for your grown.
That's money though.
So you can get these new ones that I've looked at
that are actually from Holland
and they're kind of, they're really thin.
There's firing them.
They're a vortex fan and move top air.
I've seen those.
Yeah, they're worth a thousand dollars.
They're not cheap, they're expensive,
but they're actually,
I know Green Planet, Justin from Green Planet.
He has one in his grow room.
So you can see that one on growing exposed.
And he's done some pretty cool things in this one room.
They did some testing of LEDs,
but they didn't give it all it's got.
I mean, when you were testing with LEDs,
you really got to look at different lights,
different spectrums, different weight.
Let's look at it going on.
And I always say that understanding LEDs
is going to be different for every individual grow
and every individual person.
Every room is different.
Because every room is different.
Yeah.
Everybody's got a different garage.
Everybody's got a different type of.
Climate in their area.
Right, what color they like.
You know what I mean?
It's like there's so many different ways
of looking at growing is depending
on what you want to grow with.
But nowadays you can take half the bullshit out
by following the science, PPFD, all of those.
You're at DLI.
You match all of that and that's balancing your room.
That's it.
It's numbers now.
It's not theory.
It's not my way or this guy's way.
No, it's numbers.
It's science.
You follow the numbers.
You balance your room.
You're going to have killer pot.
It's that simple.
That's simple.
And they do that with the,
I know they do it with the Athena program.
You follow the numbers, you get killer pot.
Yeah.
Right?
I'm sorry, but a lot of the nutrients,
they don't have numbers for you to follow
because they would be guessing too.
So at least I know, like I'm seeing this.
We're seeing this.
Let's say like,
so we'll talk about that.
The deficiencies in my room right now are?
Potassium.
Okay, so I've got a major potassium deficiency
I'm using the guy's soils.
I follow what Ken did with water,
so it'll be calcium.
So now I got an additive.
So now I've got a problem and I got a thrift problem.
And so this is real.
What's going on.
So I want living soils.
And what did you say about friends that done living soils?
They've all gone away from them.
There you go.
So this is being real right here, guys.
Like we're growers, right?
So, I mean, I've been using many one.
He's many one.
You like it?
Yeah.
Works.
It works.
It's great.
It's great for an organic feed.
And I'm living soils.
And what am I getting?
I'm getting problems.
I tried going organic again by using the livings,
the bugs and what did we get?
Bugs.
So, I mean,
but I've been going to the same room for a decade.
I don't get thrips.
I've had scales.
I've had every bug in there.
We've all had every bug.
You go forward every day as if you have bugs
and treat accordingly with other bugs.
Well, and one of the things with thrips that I found
is a lot of guys are putting a nice thick mulch layer on.
And then the thrips live in the mulch layer.
And the other organisms that live in that layer
eat the thrips and you don't have, they balance it out.
But without the mulch layer and those bugs.
You didn't do mulch.
Everybody put me to, I had to do a mulch, mulch, mulch.
I was like, I'm not doing that.
And then within three days, I put on that shit there
and I got fucking thrips.
Thanks guys.
They've listened to you.
I'm listening now.
And your phosphorus issue, I'm not doing this shit, John.
I gave you water soluble calcium phosphate.
Add some of that.
That's your phosphorus.
How much?
If you're having a deficiency,
I would say give it at least two mils
per thousand liters of water.
Cause it's a liquid water soluble phosphate.
It's gonna hit it right away.
You can spray it too much of that thing
and cause a problem.
What's that?
Is that gonna be too much of it?
Maybe.
So I'm gonna change the topic here a little bit
and I'm gonna call my buddy out here.
Back on the numbers and science.
Any of us that are having problems now,
for $75, you can take seven grams of leaf,
freeze it, put it in a cooler and send it to a lab.
And instead of all of us retards, stone,
talking about what we think the problem is,
you can find out for $75 in about two days.
Yeah.
So.
And Ken and Matt,
where do I do this?
I'm stone, so I don't remember the name of the lab.
Is it the same one I just took the other one to?
Probably.
Okay, well, we're gonna find out.
Ken and Matt Dan is saying,
start with one mil to start
for a thousand milliliters of water.
Well, the plant lab, high lavatory,
here you guys go.
And it's got my address on here.
So, but I guess that's not a big deal
because I don't really care.
You'll be coming to my 420 basement retreat
coming up soon.
It'll be an Airbnb weekend getaway,
putting a little Airbnb in the basement.
You guys can come up here.
People, the airport's close
and we're gonna talk about this in the near future.
But I had this place at that plant health laboratory
checked out here and I verified that my diagnosis
is that neither ear plant has the Hopps latent.
So we're like viroid three.
So I'm definitely gonna get the next steps.
I wanna test the soils.
So I'm gonna go,
and that's a three day test.
It goes down to the US.
I'm gonna have the soils tested,
which is gonna be pretty cool.
So I wanna do that for you guys,
but for me too, I need to know.
I'm curious what the hell's going on.
Like I'm not used to this.
So you ever done a sap test?
You need to call for $75.
So get some leaves, check the leaves,
what's going on, send this away,
send the soils, add water for now,
pH at 6566 because I know it's a good even balance.
I'm happy, therefore just water
and I know what's going on with soils.
Gonna go get some nemesis.
Yeah.
Nematodes?
Yeah.
Nematodes, I'm saying it wrong,
which I already knew that.
I've done that before.
You've seen it in all my old videos.
I always put it in the water and they float around
and I've done this before.
And they work.
I've had a product, thought it would work.
What did you say?
Well, I'm fucking everywhere.
And even my clones outside were infested.
I mean, it's put that shit in there.
So whatever, you know, it's called,
we gotta move forward and stuff like that.
I had to cut down crops because of light stress.
It's hard to get away from.
You cut out your crops because you know
there was no turning back.
Like when I cut my crop down with a chainsaw one time,
you get to a point where sometimes there's no recovery.
It's easy to restart again.
Well, here's the thing though.
I live in isolation.
I live 50K from any town.
So it's not as easy for me to throw stuff in the mail.
Okay.
So I've been growing for 30 years.
I have these new lights.
Who would think that your lights are frying
and when it presents as calcium deficiency
or potassium deficiency.
Thank you.
So is it light?
Is it potassium?
No, I could have saved myself two crops
if I had spent 75 bucks,
driven to town and delivered it myself.
Let science work for us.
That's what it's all about now.
It's numbers and science and there's labs everywhere
to diagnose every problem we have in a very real time way.
So I think-
So do you do the SAP test?
Pardon?
Do you do the SAP test?
No.
I do the full panel.
So you check for everything,
but I've only done it once just because my brother
who is the same as all of us called me out.
And he's like, well, why don't you get the test?
You retard.
Okay.
Wait a second.
So his brother,
it's like over the top.
Like, like, as you can do it for years and years,
we go to his brother because you know what?
He's all about the numbers.
He's all about the number.
He's the entrepreneur.
I was showing you how you have,
when you have a business.
He's the guy who's willing to go like this
and just put the money and move it.
Like he knows it has to be the numbers.
He's a hundred percent.
It's his, it's his, it's part of his six human needs.
He needs to feel significant.
He needs that certainty of what's going to move forward.
He's definitely an entrepreneur.
He's definitely that, the guy that just,
and that's what's needed in an industry.
You need all different types.
I'm an affiliate guy.
I connect people.
I got the passion.
I move forward.
Kerry's the manager where he managed the plants.
He gets things done and knows what decisions to make.
Hey, you got to do this.
You got to do that.
That's why I love you, brother.
And you even talked about that today, this morning
and how we all have roles in life
of who you are and what you do.
Make sure you have a team around you
that knows what you're doing at the same time, you guys.
It's how you move forward.
It's how you get things done, right?
Which is important.
But understanding part of that team
and then understanding now that the team,
we're sitting here, I know what to do in my garden now.
So I'm going to get the numbers on the leaf,
testing the soil, I'm going to change that
because now I have all the minds putting it together.
You can't do it on your own.
You get a good show like this
and then you get this added value
and it's like the gold show.
Yeah.
But for 75 bucks, you find out your problems instantly
rather than guessing, right?
Yeah, so I'm going to do that next too.
That's my next one.
75 bucks coming up, doing that today.
Get it while you're running.
I'm going to work that.
Have you guys ever heard of a sap test?
Because what it is basically,
you send in the sap from the leaf
and they can test it and they can tell you
you send in the sap from the leaf
and they can tell you what your plant is going to need
10 days in the future from the sap test.
So if you're going to be short on calcium
or magnesium or phosphorus,
they'll be able to actually tell you through the test
that you're going to need to add this into your grow
because your plant's going to need this at the next stage.
I bet these labs do that very test
then it's just a term I haven't heard then.
So for me to sit here and beat my head against the wall
and go and start buying, like you said,
just go get it tested, add water for now,
I'm going to test what's going on.
So this is what we're going to do guys,
I'm going to go check the numbers.
That's what I'm going to do.
There you go.
Yep.
We're going to let science do it.
And that's why Kerry's brother is so important
because he's a numbers guy and he can track all that.
And then you have a baseline for what the hell you're doing.
Oh, you know, the Trollmaster,
you probably really understand the Trollmaster.
When that first came out, he was the numbers guy.
He dialed that in within seconds.
I think even he's done some videos with Rainbow.
He's on Rainbow's channel actually on the Trollmaster.
And then you know who we're talking about.
So go check out that episode.
And then you get an idea that, I mean,
we're just passionate growers
that love doing what we love to do.
But everybody's got the different part of the passion.
We've got the different, the numbers, the manager,
the guy that connects and what's doing.
I know I'm the science, I'm in there all the time,
growing, learning, understanding.
And now that I know exactly where I can get,
because I used to, of course,
Paul Hormey used to help me with everything.
He used to have this stuff tested down at the lab
that would impend their commercial drive.
So I was getting these,
but I was getting them different ways.
We were having different analysis on the plant
and stuff like that in bud form.
But being able to do this, this way is gonna be great.
So, you know, more stuff,
as I start building the website, it's coming guys.
Understand that the website is being built.
So right now it's just got some links
that makes it look nice,
but it gives you an idea of direction
of how things will be presented on the site
in the near future.
So look forward to more coming to the website too.
So I see my website flashing up there,
which is pretty cool.
Appreciate you guys.
But definitely if you need to do some fishing,
blackwater fishing, call that guy.
And believe me, and if you're blazing,
you'll have one of these full.
You don't have to worry about a joint.
That's right.
You don't get them without them.
You don't get them without them.
There you go.
There you go, Dan Rice.
Well, I know the guy that I have building my beehives,
he's an avid fisherman,
and he says he'll deliver beehives into BC, no problem.
As long as somebody sets them up a little fishing trip,
you know, he'll come, no problem.
Yes, well, he can come and have a look at my beehives.
We just started doing these.
It's a cool thing.
This guy teaching, he's doing a four hour seminar
on Saturday about beehiving and everything.
Whoa.
Yeah, treatment free beekeeping.
I don't use the lay-ins or the Langstroth.
I use a lay-in, so it's a horizontal,
and we put an inch and a half of sheep's wool
in the walls and the base.
We don't have a lot of winter kill that way.
Wow, I've never even heard of that before.
That's cool.
Now, where are you gonna talk to this guy?
Huh, small world, man.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be leaving tonight, heading down to Van.
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.
You're still gonna be around sometime.
I've got to work out at the mom's cup there
for a little while, doing some work.
I'm heading home this afternoon.
My garden's waiting for me, so unfortunately.
I'm gonna say, yeah, no.
Right, yeah, never say never.
Well, you're in the office, so I can swing there.
Kerry's staying in your room right now,
or your sex is staying in Kerry's room.
Wait, where are you right now?
I'm just west of Edmonton, Alberta.
Oh, wow, okay.
Oh, shit.
I messed it up for you.
We tested it, we never.
We'll talk to this one.
Yeah, that one too.
So 56, that must be the point.
This came back at 56% AW.
It's nice and moist.
It's fresh.
It's gonna burn really nicely.
And that's over two and a half years later.
Okay, and it's Blackwater Fishing, right, Kerry?
Blackwater Guiding.
Blackwater Guiding.
Okay, JD, there you go.
Yeah, yeah, come check it out and show you a good time.
All fly fishing.
All right on.
I've only done a lot of top water,
just around my, in the lakes around here
when I go fishing, so.
Yeah, I love it.
Fishing's awesome.
Dude, you gotta love it.
Well.
It's your passion.
It's your mission in life.
It is.
You need one more tattoo, don't you?
One more tattoo.
What tattoo do you need still?
Black Marlin.
So he needs to catch a Black Marlin.
If the tattoo doesn't go on the arm of his, he's caught it.
Is that the deal?
Yeah.
So he hasn't caught a Black Marlin.
Yeah.
So I guess, is that ever gonna happen?
Australia.
Australia.
Fuck, we're going to Australia?
At some point, I hope.
We're going to, dude.
Okay, you know what?
That's written down.
We're gonna put that into our dream bucket.
We're making it a reality bucket.
Dude, we're gonna go to Australia.
That's my plan.
We're gonna see Scott Harris,
because he's in Australia.
Some people at D.L.A.
You all know the stuff that I'm doing with Tony Robbins.
Stuff like that.
Some awesome people that I love to meet.
We're gonna go hang out with Scott Harris.
We're gonna fish on his boat
and catch a Black Marlin together.
Let's do that.
It's going to happen.
Done deal.
Right on.
Yeah.
That's manifesting your future.
That's being the creator being that you are
and just putting it out there.
I'm gonna do this, period.
Nothing else is gonna happen.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it, because he wants it.
I can see the smile on his face,
and we're gonna get it.
1200 pound fish.
Uh-huh.
I get to watch it.
Quite crazy, man.
I know.
See the excitement on his face?
Because he knows that we make things happen.
We do.
Yeah.
We make things happen.
How about this?
Here's a guy we talked about how we had to get away,
because everything was gonna happen.
We didn't say COVID,
but we said that things had to get out of the city,
and you had to do things.
You had to build a farm, be self-sufficient.
You started doing the chickens,
everything we talked about.
This guy's got a beautiful farm.
He's all self-sufficient.
He's got his own food.
He's got his own chickens, as you heard this all.
I mean, talk about manifesting,
and then making his dreams his reality,
and now moving into the next stages
of those dreams that we talked about.
So we keep building our dreams,
because when you dream of something,
you imagine it.
When you envision it, it's there.
But when you write it down,
and you know what's gonna happen,
it becomes reality.
You have to commit to it.
Commit to it.
Yeah.
The part of it is writing it down,
and remembering it every day,
and saying it, this is my dream.
I'm making it happen.
And then it becomes reality.
I was going to Australia so bad,
and you know what?
I knew I was gonna go one day,
and I keep saying it.
But now, now I have a purpose,
and a why.
So now it's just the water of putting it together.
We wanna go to Australia.
Purpose is to go fishing,
to go catch a black marlin.
I'll tell you in a minute.
Now, now it's just the massive action plan.
I think we need to leave Australia.
Oh yeah, yeah.
We need to leave.
So now it's just the massive action plan.
So first you wanna know what you want.
We wanna go and catch a black marlin.
So why do we wanna go there?
Because it's part of the Bucket List Theory.
I wanna be Scott Harris,
so now we gotta get the massive action to get there.
That's how you put your life together, guys.
That's what you call a massive action plan.
Results, purpose, massive action.
I'm learning that.
I know that.
Why?
Because we've always done it.
It's kind of like the Christmas room.
We didn't know what we were doing.
Same with my life.
I never knew what I was doing, but now I know.
Now I can put it behind.
I got the juice.
Dude.
That's some real right there, guys.
Well, and that's-
And I just felt it too.
You guys always have a silent moment.
I'm shaking their heads at the two stoners on the screen.
Two stoners on the screen.
So is that, John, is that the stuff
that was in the humidor?
No, that's right here.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
This is the special can mixed with-
What was it?
Huh?
There's so much on the train now.
This is starting-
That's MKU and special can.
This might be MKU and special can.
This is the humidor one.
Yeah, like that.
Oh, you-
Are you gonna give him his humidor back
or are you gonna keep that, John?
Wait, it's another two and a half years.
Huh?
Oh, you know what?
I will only smoke that with him.
So if we didn't smoke that, we'd go back in there.
That's, that became part of the legend
of a two and a half year weed.
Now we look at it and put him right back in the same spot.
Yeah.
So when he come back in there again,
it'd be like, you know what?
I'm gonna have to take it up fishing.
Smoke it up fishing.
Got the smoke up fishing.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I think that would be just a normal-
Eight years ago when you were here with Courtney,
you remember that?
And that popped you like, wow.
Yeah.
12 years ago, popped a smoke killer.
They love the smoke.
Right.
And you're quite enjoying-
No, I thought Mr. Toad might come on
and I was telling Gary, I got another great guy.
He's kind of like me.
We didn't make it, but I mean, got this guy.
And you know, it's always been golden with you, dude.
I'll just say that.
It's been a good ride.
Yeah.
We were talking about the sifting.
Yeah.
He's going, we had the car in tow.
It had to be-
Minus 20.
Minus 20.
Oh dude, like he watched me sift like crazy, man.
I was like freaking out outside with lights.
Remember the lights?
Remember how we were-
Hands covered in static.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Like he's like, what I learned now,
what I'm doing now, which you'll see in the last video,
I did with a glove, but you can actually do it
with a hand type.
We'll talk more about that.
But he's one of the guys that goes,
if I would have known I was doing it.
Nobody knew what we were doing.
Nobody knew it.
We didn't even know what we were doing.
Exactly.
You didn't even know what I was doing.
And now, we're way before ahead of our times.
Now we're setting up for the future and understand that.
We're the guys that look towards the future.
We always look at the end of the day
and what's happening next.
So that's one thing that you'll always see with me.
You guys think I have problems?
Problems make us grow, man.
It's called the secret sauce in life.
Makes you understand what the next level of you
can achieve and stuff like that.
Like going back in the duds.
I love them.
Yeah, I don't like beds.
It's easy for me because I'm not having a hard time
with everything.
So I'm gonna go beds again.
Yeah, it's easiest for you for sure.
You know that.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I know Dragonfly Earth Medicine
has been trying to push you that direction for a while too.
I actually got to meet Josh and Kelly at the Unicorn Cup.
Oh, fantastic human beings.
Souls loving, like just a little growth
and harmony and everything like that, definitely.
And they have been pushing me to get back
and moving souls, get back in the beds.
And then I got good by we'd grown for years and years.
It's like they're a fucking nightmare.
And I'm like, yeah, look what I'm getting into again.
And then you're kind of laughing at me.
He's like, oh yeah, it's on my video.
It's not here, but I'm filming outside.
He's laughing.
He goes, oh yeah, you're doing this again, aren't you?
Fuck yeah.
Cause he had the cement mix,
I used to do the mixing of the soils.
He was here for all of this.
Like this is like years of definitely check out the videos.
I'll be putting those together on the website
so you'll see different videos.
So you'd be able to go there
and you'd be able to have a weekend of Johnny B
and then you can just crash out
and watch a whole series of videos
and how I'm gone through a whole grow
and we've gone through
and the knowledge that you get from watching that series.
It's kind of like you're all in.
You have to do a whole immersion weekend
of some of the series that we've gone through.
Like some of the ones I've done with Carrie,
there's an immersions of what we've done
to different parts of growing and stuff like that.
And then you get to really learn.
So that makes it fun and stuff like that.
So once you realize what you've done over the last
decade, you've actually created these little segments
of knowledge of just, I've done it,
but everybody's telling me what they're doing.
I'm like, shit, well, I do that.
The courses that I'm taking is stuff like that.
I do a full immersion and I stack everything.
So I have the knowledge.
Then I go back to my books when I want to learn more.
And that's what you guys do with my videos.
And I appreciate you guys and more to come with the books
and more to come with fishing.
You gotta come up fishing.
Everybody should come up fishing.
Everybody's gotta come up fishing.
Cause you guys are all over the world.
You guys got all those accesses and stuff like that.
So what do you generally fish for?
You're in the Okanogan, right?
So what are you generally fishing for up there?
Well, I grew up as a river rat on the Fraser River,
all around, you know, all the rivers around the Fraser
at the coast, but as we all know, it's all dying.
So we relocated to the Okanogan.
So it's pretty much all rainbow trout in the lakes.
There's a few rivers, you know,
within a couple hours drive,
you can go and fish with fly rods too, which is great.
Which is really important is carry fishes on private lakes
that no one else has access to,
so they don't get fished out.
You understand that?
I mean, we live on the back of a lake.
That's what, how many acres?
500 acres?
What's the name?
It's about 700 acres.
It's got a thousand acres with private lake on it.
So you see, you know what I mean?
So it's like these, these places, they don't get over fished.
They don't get fished out or nothing like that
because like, he's like the only one really fishing there.
Well, on the other lakes right around my house,
they're four by four access only.
So, you know, we don't get so much pressure, right?
But I'm fortunate to have access that it's pretty easy.
It's a five minute ride for us.
So we're usually in the lake by ourselves
and there's up to seven, eight, nine pound trout in them.
You spent time looking for this property?
For three years.
We hung out on MLS together.
We used to sit up there and smoke weed
and fucking find all these awesome places
and stuff like that.
But I knew I had to be close to my medicine
and stuff like that.
My hospital as in healthcare and stuff.
And he had to, he knew he had to get out of here
and look after himself because of what he's going through.
His medicine is being on the farm growing the chickens, man.
Food's so good, dude.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Well, I live right between Merritt and Princeton.
If you know where that is at all.
From Alberta.
We're right in the middle of a mountain called Pike Mountain
and then there's like 25 stock lakes on Pike Mountain.
And then across the road behind me,
there's another 10.
So there's just no limit to it.
I can fish a different lake every day.
So it's really nice.
I'm lucky that way.
Yeah, yeah.
You manifested it.
You manifested it.
You looked for it for three years.
Three years.
Understand things don't happen overnight.
Three years, but it took you a lifetime
to get to where you wanted to be.
And now you're just starting that next adventure,
which is pretty awesome, dude.
Yeah.
I'm in the finishing stages of building
my ranch lands and rivers cannabis facility.
I'm sending my application off probably in two weeks.
And then I'll probably be growing maybe.
Well, the fellow Kush.
So probably it's, we're getting,
it's gonna go for a clean.
We're getting it all done off.
So it's gonna be properly taken care of.
And what we guys have asked for for the last,
I don't know, 15 years, 12 years.
I said, we'd be working on this.
It'd be the plan.
It'd be the master plan because we wanna make sure
it's in the right hands to get the right care and love
to the ones that are truly in need.
And you'll see the genetics coming up
because I'm working with a fantastic 710 Canuck.
And you can check out his chocolate ties
and his other strains that he'd be working with
and bringing back the old school genetics.
And we'll be working towards that
by going to school, learning it all,
studying it, following the immersion for the last,
I don't know, he's been immersion for the last four
or five years and really understanding it
and wanting to do this and be a part of this.
So just looking forward to be able to bring this
to the people and help you guys grow,
get that growth growing for yourself and understand
like by sitting here, listening to us,
understand what we're talking about.
Things take time and understanding
and you learn along the way and you get a magic moment.
Then you get to do one of these.
You ready for it?
You put the hand up like this.
Come on, do it with me.
Give me some of Pat on the angle.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those happen so few in life.
You know what I mean?
And that's what it's about.
I want you guys to all do that right now.
Make sure you put yourself a pat on the back
to even watch this episode.
I'll even pat mine on the back.
I actually got to meet some of them.
Seriously, when you meet your hand up on my front.
Do it with me, right?
You actually put your hand in the back.
You're releasing dopamine.
You actually feel the pattern.
You're naturally giving yourself a thank you
to your self-conscious.
You won't even realize it, but you're self-conscious.
You just said, thank you.
You know how great that feels when you sleep?
You get a good sleep.
Hey man, it's like everything you do, right?
Just saying, right?
I actually got to meet Sam Kinock up at the Unicorn Cup.
And yeah, he's a fantastic person.
He's got some beautiful seeds
and some of the older strains.
It was fantastic.
He has solutions organically.
Like he has solutions that he's made well to make.
So you can actually make your own seeds.
You have that strain that you have at home.
You can actually do the work.
He's done that work for you.
He's taken on all of that.
That, those trenches that you're just going to go,
I've tried, I have the powders.
I've tried doing this several times.
I've done my pollens.
I've did the breeding here.
We talked about this.
He was like, yeah.
I mean, the Haas is awesome.
Yeah, it's good.
And the number four was great.
The number four.
I agree, OG.
It was a beautiful stage.
Roy, you did pretty good in that room.
Didn't you have the number two and the number four in that?
I didn't like two.
You didn't like the two.
I did.
I like the flavor.
It didn't yield.
See, he's the manager, right?
He's like, no, no, I didn't.
It's like, I'm not growing that.
Nah, nah, nah.
Oh, give me the MKU.
I know that one.
Like, see, this is what I mean.
This is part of that team that you have
that works with you, right?
So.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, and having that team and putting it together,
especially starting out a new grow
is so hugely important to know exactly what you're doing,
why you're doing it, so nobody screws things up.
That's right.
And no plant is the same.
No phenol is the same.
No, nothing is the same.
It takes two to three crops to figure out any plant
in any given room.
See, I keep always saying it.
It takes at least a year from seed, at least a year.
Yeah.
And three cuttings from that to see its true potential.
That's right.
Three cuttings, not one from the seed.
You gotta take the seed, cut it, cut it,
flip that cutting, cut it from that,
flip that cutting from that, flip that.
Your third, one full year.
We normally spend a couple years on the strain.
I know it's three to five years on some strains
we've looked at and we've dumped.
So, I mean, it's timing and the work that's being done
by the people like ourselves.
You guys think you pop a seed and you got a thing,
they start a company and they wonder what the fuck goes on
because the guy's got all these deficiencies.
Because you didn't fucking understand it.
You didn't put the work in.
Things don't happen.
We got the strains and breeders out there
that put a lot of work into it for you.
But every seed, every strain is different.
The cuts stay the same.
That's what I've had many for 17 years.
Yeah.
NKE's been around for 12 years.
We know it produces, we know it gives us what we want.
We cross that, we do some strapping around with it.
That's another five years worth of work
to see if it builds up to that.
Or if it'll yield.
Or if it yields or if it even makes the cut.
Like from 126, I'm down to my last two.
Would you say that one?
That's when we were 11 weeks.
So he doesn't always like, yeah, I'm starting to see it.
I was hoping to pull it off soon, but it's not gonna be.
No.
So I don't even know.
It's like, that's two years.
And I got nothing out of it.
Again, back into the saddle again this fall.
You'll see what has happened during COVID.
We did the 420JV crew.
We did a seed hunt.
So a lot of people were part of that.
Instagram deleted my account.
So I lost all of those crews.
You guys, please find me.
We'll start it back up.
JV crew 2023 coming out strong.
You know what?
It'll be with many cush feminized this time.
And look at that.
Cool.
Those seeds will be their own versions too.
Well, it'll be feminized runs.
So it'll be the true expression of the plant.
And we'll do the running of that.
And of course, it'll be a crew.
You guys could test it out and stuff like that.
We'll spend a year on it.
Take a look at the different fields.
We'll come in and make sure it is stabilized
before I totally release it.
And I have it written down for 2025 as the full release.
So that's when you know things will happen.
Because that time we're fully legalized around the world.
So looking at a world platform,
you'll be able to give true expression of a plant
and being able to understand the growth
and what we've done with it
and understanding its patterns.
Once you understand the patterns through time
and through history, through your life,
you start to understand the pattern of a plant
and growth and how it runs.
Yeah.
It's time.
And that's if your room is balanced.
Yeah.
That's the factors.
But then there's a whole other playing ground.
That's right.
You get the same strain of five different growers.
We all know, give them all the same strain,
all the same nutrients,
it all comes back five different ways.
That's right.
All at once.
That's why the Christmas tree was on one side
of this room six inches away from it.
And it was completely different.
Even though it was built exactly the same.
Every room's different.
Every room's different.
I didn't have a bigger showroom on that one.
It was eight lights.
It was eight lights.
Only more lights.
Yeah.
And I couldn't get it under 82 degrees.
There you go.
So I put the PPFD out, or sorry,
put the VPD out.
Yeah, because the VPD, we couldn't get that room up.
It was always around the 60%, which we thought was fine.
That's right, but it was too low.
But it was too low and that was the deficiency problem again.
But it's the science that tells you that, right?
Now we know.
We had, the information wasn't available to us 10 years ago.
And that's why you have the Troll Master
and the sensors in your room.
So you can track that data to figure it out.
Now Shooter's been smoking a long time.
He's got a lot of dank feed.
He's saying nothing seems to work anymore for him.
Any suggestions?
What's his issue?
I think he's got back issues, I think is what is happening.
Back issues?
Well, when he's having back issues
and he'd say nothing seems to work,
well, I'm gonna ask you right now,
what's your exercise program?
Shooter, what's your exercise?
I think Shooter's been joining us
for the 222 Push-Up Challenge.
So he's doing push-ups every day as well.
That's fantastic.
You know what?
What's your daily diet?
What's your mindset around your pain?
How fresh is your pain?
Is it new, is it old?
How do you perceive your pain?
How do you look at your pain?
And then how do other people look at your pain
when they're around you and when you're in pain,
how do they perceive you in that pain?
So there's key factors that I've actually put together
in a module to pretty much understand
how to identify pain and how you are with your own pain
and how you can move forward with your pain.
Because when pain doesn't go away, like myself,
a friend knows me very well,
it's how you are around your pain
because you can change the mood of somebody
within a second by how you feel.
And the prime example was last night
is Hedy, my manager, she fell and she broke her shoulder.
Guys, she's really-
Oh, no way!
Like literally broke her shoulder.
And Hedy came over and she was kind of in a good mood
and stuff like that.
But Mike came in, he was agitated
because his wife was in a good mood.
So he was all frustrated.
It put me in a negative mood.
And Mike was screaming at Mike.
I said, no, I was like talking with him
and Mike was being very loud and I'm drunk
because he was trying to look after his wife.
So he was really, his mood was all over the place.
And I'm in a peak state now
because I'm doing a course,
I'm coming out in like peak state, woo!
And their state was a little bit different.
So we instantly clashed and identified.
I said, how about you guys just leave
and I'll see you guys tomorrow?
Because I'm in a peak state right now
and I'm not changing now.
Yeah, yeah.
So Peter says he's got arthritis in his knee.
Now he's been using LSD, shrimps, MDMA, cannabis,
all do nothing for me anymore.
Yes.
I'm not sure about what he can do.
I don't know if you're trying topical shooter
or something like that.
But I think you're gonna definitely
have to switch things up.
You're talking, you were gonna be taking
a little bit of a break anyway.
That may be what you need to do is take that break
and then find out, try some different strains,
different consumption methods, quit smoking it,
start ingesting it.
There's so many different ways to consume, right?
Topicals are great for like joint tenderness and pain.
Yeah.
It affects me and my knees, the same thing.
And I've got, we call it the green bar,
friends of ours make it out of just shake
and it works well.
It doesn't cure it,
but it takes the sharpness of the pain away.
Yeah.
I'm sure you can Google or find out the recipes for it,
but it's a topical cream with shea butter
and all the usual stuff,
but it's a THC and CBD topical and it works great.
A lot of people that use it for their hands for arthritis
and it works.
The green bar.
I find things that are more balanced with both THC
and the CBD, the whole plant,
seem to work better for most people.
Yeah, I find that.
I didn't post.
This is, sometimes you forget.
You sit there, you get talking, you're doing things
and they don't push me doing the pushups
and I got to like push the pushup challenge.
The green bar works.
Somebody just sent you a text going,
hey, John, where's your post?
Did you miss your pushups?
What's going on?
No.
That's okay.
You started a real movement with a lot of people,
like the 222 challenge for the vets,
bringing awareness for the 22 that,
you know, leaving this world every day in the States.
You have managed to bring that to a lot of people
where they're trying to bring awareness
using pushups as that awareness
and blessings brother,
because that's amazing.
It's like putting yourself in a peak state.
My friends know me a very long time.
I'm in the best shape of my life
and all I do is pushups, guys.
I walk 20 minutes every morning
and I do pushups every two hours.
I started with two.
I showed them on the wall here what I had here.
I've been doing this since September 11th, I started.
And then November 11th, I went,
because I could only do two.
My goal was I could do 50 pushups on my 50th birthday.
And then I did 50 pushups a day for 50 days
while turning 50.
And then on January 1st, I was like,
screw it, 100 pushups for 100,
I'm going to do 10,000 pushups.
And then 420 hit,
because I already done the 10,000 pushups.
I'm going to do 42,000 pushups for 420 next year.
And I did that on the stage.
I sat behind me,
so we do some pushups on the start.
And well, here we are guys,
it's been April, May, June, July, August,
going into the countdown,
we're six months in.
We checked off.
You do the math, I've already done 20,000 pushups.
I've already done 42,000 pushups in reality.
I hit that mark the other day.
I've done 42,000 pushups now.
So I've accomplished some pretty amazing insights
by putting myself in a peak state,
but by committing to myself.
It's that time around my phone,
you see me do pushups on the side of the road,
in the bank, at my doctor's office,
in a grocery store.
And people ask what I'm doing,
I'm doing a pushup challenge.
And you know what?
They all six five and smile.
I'm doing a pushup challenge.
That's awesome.
42,000 pushups, whoa.
But it seems like a lot.
But if you split it over a period of time,
like when you get up in the morning,
when you first get up,
I do 10 or 20 pushups.
I'm gonna come back from my walk,
I do another 10 or 15 pushups.
And then depending on how I feel throughout the day,
and then how many I go,
sometimes I'll go to six o'clock,
but I always get in my 117 pushups a day at least,
because that goes out to 42,000 pushups.
If you do 115 pushups a day,
basically in a year, it's 42,000 pushups.
So now it's not that hard, is it?
Now you're the man, so do 25 at a time.
I don't give a shit.
You wanna do 50 at a time, do 50 twice a day,
because you can.
But if you commit yourself to doing just the small increments
like eating smaller, you're doing something,
guess what, over time, you start to build,
and you start to grow your life.
It's how Rome was built,
it's how everything is built in time.
Slowly kissing it, keep it simple, silly.
Keep it simple, stupid.
Keep it simple always in business or in life.
And with small increments, little two millimeter shifts,
you start moving forward.
You start growing better.
You start understanding your plants better.
You start using science.
You start using the troll masters
and little things that have woken down
that you've learned to use,
that you've totally changed your growing.
You went down, when we done it together,
we worked and talked with you back and forth,
now you've dialed it.
Now we're getting to the next level.
It's more, now you gotta use science.
We never used science before.
I love this guy.
He goes, what do you mean?
I've been away for two, he hasn't been here for,
he hasn't been to my house for two years.
That's how long he hasn't been here for.
Somebody needs to sit here all the time.
It's been two years.
That's what COVID did to the industry.
So it's been two years we're coming out
because we've learned over the last couple of years.
We've learned so much.
COVID changed the technology for us too.
We can better understand things
and how we can actually grow better
and understand how that we don't have to be tied
to our gardens anymore how we used to.
You can look on your phone
and see what's going on in real time.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I can track everything wherever we are.
Yeah.
Think what that does for the hydroponic industry
and someone's backyard.
Before your pump burns out, you don't know.
You go in in the morning and your room's dead.
Now your phone sends you an alarm
that something's going on.
You get up and you go deal with it.
Yeah.
That's when you get down the rabbit hole
and the thing goes off all the time.
You're racing home because the VPD's out.
Ah, it's fucking ah!
Right, and then you start understanding
how you're chasing it.
And then you start understanding.
So there's that work too, right?
Understand there's a lot of work,
what you get into doing the work.
The understanding and the knowledge
and to move forward with it is the most important part.
You know what guys?
As you know, I like to do an extended show
just because we've got some gold going on here.
But he's gotta go, man.
I know he just, as of being a friend,
because I know he's having a good time.
I can see him smiling.
But we've got to let this join first before we leave.
Yeah, we'll smoke that before I go.
Okay, here we go.
Two and a half years later, dude.
You all right?
Sure, you get to enjoy it.
This is a Sage commercial.
This is a Sage commercial.
There you go.
We're gonna take the mothership out of the way
with a commercial from Sage.
Sage is a brand of fishing rods.
Sage Fishing, that's blackwaterguiding.com.
And Silly Lily wanted to know
if you've ever been down to the east
and fishing the rivers down there in Nova Scotia
in that area, New Brunswick.
I'm from Ontario, so I've done a little bit there,
but never Nova Scotia.
I'd love to, though.
I'd like to come fish for poor beagle sharks out there.
Okay, Carrie, my wife's sitting here.
She's going, no, New Brunswick, New Brunswick.
No, I definitely haven't been there.
The Miramichi River is world-class for salmon.
Wow.
Oh, wait, wait.
Bovena makes your weed turn black.
How white is that shit?
I can't believe people say that.
So there, I don't know.
I just, two and a half years later.
Yeah, people say that Bovena makes your weed turn black.
No, that's bad sugar and dry.
Bad flush.
So how's that taste in there, boys?
Tastes pretty good.
It doesn't taste fresh.
Yeah.
It tastes okay.
It tastes like weed.
It tastes like...
It doesn't taste like that.
It doesn't taste like the MKU, no.
I'm going to judge it on the throat now.
Smooth.
Smooth.
Well, that was beautiful white ash.
So I know that's clean.
Well, it just fell off.
Like as you're smoking, it's just like...
That's a three-week flush.
Always.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait a second here.
And it's also a three-week hang.
Yeah.
I think that was the biggest thing
about what we talked about is,
I remember you were hanging for a week.
I know you like your sticky weed,
but getting it to hang a little bit longer,
instead of getting more turps and stuff like that.
But he makes sure he knows what's going on.
He'll go in every morning,
okay, today's the day.
No, if it's tomorrow, it's too far.
And that's an art that you'll never be able to establish
unless you've put in the time to understand this.
But having said that,
a climate-controlled room using science,
you could do a six-month cure
because you're absolutely perfect, right?
This here is cured this way.
Yeah.
That's what this is.
So you'll see that today when you go there,
you'll see an asthma.
I sit in the room up there,
he's got all the EC done, it's completely controlled.
And he said, he goes,
John, you taught me that.
I love it when he said that.
You know what I mean?
Like, because that's the main thing.
I've kept my weed curing for six months and I tested it.
You guys seen that?
I tested four-month cure in that room.
It's happened.
And Mark even said four months.
Like, look at how fresh this weed is.
We're like laughing.
I'm like, I've been curing my own for four months.
Well, as long as you're keeping it
at the right temperature, humidity,
the weed can stay there forever, basically.
That's right.
It should be able to.
It's not perfect once in a while though.
Guys, you know what?
We're gonna lead off,
but this joint's still burning here
and say have a fantastic, bro.
Have a fantastic day.
Put down your goals and roles.
Good to meet you.
Yeah, you guys about the B, always talk.
Yes, definitely.
Oh, cell phone, whatever.
Remember what you have in your back pocket?
A connection to the world and to me.
If you message me, I'll get back to you.
We can even go live.
Hey, what's going on?
You know?
Okay, Kerry, thank you very much, brother.
It was a pleasure.
Guys, I'm gonna end the broadcast.
We'll check you guys out next.
