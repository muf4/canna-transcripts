[00:00.000 --> 00:07.600]  Hello everybody, we are live, live, live here in the garden.
[00:07.600 --> 00:13.920]  We got Zips, we got Cory, we got Mr. Trees, we got flower cams, we got everything we could
[00:13.920 --> 00:15.500]  need for another great evening.
[00:15.500 --> 00:16.840]  So who knows how long we'll run.
[00:16.840 --> 00:20.840]  You guys ran like four fucking hours last night, it was incredible really.
[00:20.840 --> 00:23.800]  So I'm excited to have another nice long episode and hang with you guys today.
[00:23.800 --> 00:30.760]  I've chatted with the Unicorn Cup guys and they're probably, I got their sample, their
[00:30.760 --> 00:31.760]  judging bag.
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.560]  So I'm going to do some, run through some of the judges stuff and sample it, do some
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.320]  judging while we're here.
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.800]  And after, once we get through all the checking out the usual flowers and stuff like that,
[00:45.800 --> 00:49.480]  because I got a lot of weed to roll through.
[00:49.480 --> 00:52.520]  And then Mr. Trees, your flowers are looking fucking incredible.
[00:52.520 --> 00:57.080]  I can't wait to show those off for everybody to see because it's, I got a beast.
[00:57.080 --> 00:59.080]  I have a beast of a pheno.
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.080]  I'm pretty, pretty pumped about it.
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.360]  I had to be a little bit of a full of heart.
[01:03.360 --> 01:05.480]  Other than that, how is everybody doing?
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.480]  How is everyone today?
[01:06.480 --> 01:07.480]  How are you, Cory?
[01:07.480 --> 01:09.640]  We'll start off with you, brother.
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.960]  I'm doing good.
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.800]  I am a little bit high, so bear with me, but no, I'm doing good.
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.800]  Plants are doing good.
[01:20.800 --> 01:23.560]  I don't know if we're going to get started by taking a look at them or just saying hello
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.560]  or what do you want to do?
[01:24.560 --> 01:30.560]  Why don't we do a quick hello and then what time do your lights turn off?
[01:30.560 --> 01:32.800]  What time do you have to go get your lights off?
[01:32.800 --> 01:33.800]  I'm loose.
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.160]  I'm good through the night.
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.880]  I have till about eight o'clock and I need to, I need to get in there by eight.
[01:40.880 --> 01:45.800]  So maybe we'll do the introduction, do a round of introductions first and then I'll go and
[01:45.800 --> 01:51.400]  then you go and then Coastal or Nick will go and then you something like that.
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.720]  Maybe just trees, throw some shit in, usual stuff.
[01:54.720 --> 01:55.840]  We're going to have a fantastic episode.
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.240]  We're already live and we're having a good time here.
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.320]  I'm super excited.
[01:59.320 --> 02:02.480]  I love these shows because it's like, you know, my other shows, like, don't get me wrong.
[02:02.480 --> 02:06.320]  I love and appreciate each and every one of you and respect the fuck out of all of you.
[02:06.320 --> 02:07.960]  But my other shows are like doctors and shit.
[02:07.960 --> 02:11.840]  So this is my like one opportunity to like hang out with the guys and like get an excuse
[02:11.840 --> 02:15.640]  to have a Saturday night away from the family and hang out with you guys.
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.120]  So I actually look forward to this every fucking week.
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.760]  So thank you all for being here.
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.760]  And thank you.
[02:20.760 --> 02:21.760]  Thank you guys for it.
[02:21.760 --> 02:28.000]  Are you saying that you're happy that we dumb it down for you?
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.440]  That's not what I said at all.
[02:29.440 --> 02:32.000]  You're just twisted my words.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.640]  You're fucking twisting my words for sure.
[02:33.640 --> 02:35.480]  Hit that like button guys.
[02:35.480 --> 02:42.000]  It's all in good fun brother.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.200]  So have you been running into any challenges, Corey?
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.080]  Has there been anything going on with yours?
[02:47.080 --> 02:49.600]  I have actually.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.680]  And I don't know.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.840]  You'll take a look at it.
[02:52.840 --> 02:59.760]  But I've had that one plant that's just struggled to take flower and it's starting to now.
[02:59.760 --> 03:03.840]  And the plants, I don't know.
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.840]  I mean, they just look different than what I'm used to.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.640]  But now they're starting to take shape and start to stack buds.
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.080]  Yeah, odd.
[03:14.080 --> 03:16.720]  Very odd, very odd leaf formation.
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.720]  I don't know.
[03:17.720 --> 03:18.720]  Different plants, eh?
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.480]  It almost looks like they want to revege.
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.760]  But not really.
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.760]  I don't know if it's, you know.
[03:25.760 --> 03:27.640]  Are your leaves really thick too?
[03:27.640 --> 03:30.240]  Do you get really thick ass leaves as well?
[03:30.240 --> 03:35.760]  Thick and real leathery.
[03:35.760 --> 03:36.760]  On some of them.
[03:36.760 --> 03:40.760]  Probably, I guess, three out of four.
[03:40.760 --> 03:41.760]  That one that's different.
[03:41.880 --> 03:43.880]  I guess I can't count that as anything.
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.920]  But yeah, really thick, leathery.
[03:46.920 --> 03:50.920]  And really, like I say, just a strange looking formation.
[03:50.920 --> 03:51.920]  I don't know.
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.840]  When you see them, maybe you can make some sense of it, Mr. Trees.
[03:53.840 --> 03:54.840]  I can't.
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.240]  What's the light cycle?
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.240]  What's the light cycle at?
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.240]  12-12.
[04:01.240 --> 04:02.240]  12-12.
[04:02.240 --> 04:03.240]  I run them at 8 p.m.
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.240]  Straight 12-12.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.240]  I run them 8 p.m. until 8 a.m.
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.240]  Are these the SFV cross of the KMRs or are they just something else?
[04:12.240 --> 04:13.240]  SFV, yep.
[04:13.240 --> 04:20.240]  Yeah, I noticed something and I was trying to point it out on the forums.
[04:20.240 --> 04:23.240]  So, I grew nine out.
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.240]  And out of nine, I got two females.
[04:26.240 --> 04:28.240]  The two females were good.
[04:28.240 --> 04:30.240]  Then I got two good males.
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.240]  And then the rest of the males were shit.
[04:35.240 --> 04:43.240]  So, the five other males were like really like they had really slow growth.
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.240]  And I started to think maybe it's the Y chromosome.
[04:46.240 --> 04:55.240]  But then I started to realize it could actually be the X chromosome on the KMR pollen donor.
[04:55.240 --> 05:00.240]  And like because you can't just jump on all that.
[05:01.240 --> 05:04.240]  And so, I started thinking about all that and like how it could be going.
[05:04.240 --> 05:08.240]  Because I kept seeing this like redundancy.
[05:08.240 --> 05:10.240]  And I don't know.
[05:10.240 --> 05:15.240]  I think that's part of the reason why we're testing these things out is to give Tyler this input.
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.240]  But I think there's something there on the KMR.
[05:19.240 --> 05:22.240]  Because I've grown out SFV before.
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.240]  So, I know how it works.
[05:25.240 --> 05:27.240]  Yeah.
[05:27.240 --> 05:33.240]  The SFV dominant ones look a lot more healthy.
[05:33.240 --> 05:38.240]  And the ones that are like more KMR leaning look.
[05:38.240 --> 05:42.240]  And I think it has to do with the X chromosome on the KMR.
[05:42.240 --> 05:50.240]  But, yeah, I think those are like kind of leaning towards bringing it.
[05:50.240 --> 05:54.240]  Sometimes bringing it into like some sort of issues.
[05:54.240 --> 05:56.240]  And I think that's why you're having those issues.
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.240]  Because I had a lot of issues too.
[05:58.240 --> 06:03.240]  I just killed them all off.
[06:03.240 --> 06:05.240]  All the bad ones.
[06:05.240 --> 06:08.240]  Did you flower those under artificial light?
[06:08.240 --> 06:09.240]  Or did you light that?
[06:09.240 --> 06:11.240]  But what do you got going on?
[06:11.240 --> 06:13.240]  I depped them and now they're outdoors.
[06:14.240 --> 06:23.240]  Yeah, what I noticed with some of those like really raw looking ones.
[06:23.240 --> 06:26.240]  Like, you know, some of the PAM one really shows some of that.
[06:26.240 --> 06:29.240]  It's like this really.
[06:29.240 --> 06:32.240]  It's like old.
[06:32.240 --> 06:34.240]  It's like more like mean looking.
[06:34.240 --> 06:37.240]  It's like mean and like raw looking.
[06:37.240 --> 06:41.240]  And not like a commercial flower in any shape.
[06:41.240 --> 06:46.240]  There's a lot of funky little fox tail in and jumping around.
[06:46.240 --> 06:50.240]  Power is really, really, really, really awesome on that.
[06:50.240 --> 06:55.240]  But the ones that I grew inside were more likely to do that.
[06:55.240 --> 06:58.240]  More in a not a natural environment, outdoor stuff.
[06:58.240 --> 07:03.240]  Like the ones that were inside under artificial light were a lot, you know.
[07:03.240 --> 07:08.240]  There was a lot more tendencies towards like, you know, the more gamey.
[07:08.240 --> 07:11.240]  The more gamey type land race stuff.
[07:11.240 --> 07:14.240]  You know, the more gamey stuff.
[07:14.240 --> 07:18.240]  When I ran them outside, you know what I mean?
[07:18.240 --> 07:22.240]  And I get them going outside there under real light and stuff like that.
[07:22.240 --> 07:26.240]  They really are completely different, you know, growing plants there.
[07:26.240 --> 07:33.240]  Which leads me to, you know, there's some that are in flower now that are excellent.
[07:33.240 --> 07:36.240]  There's some that are just really ugly.
[07:36.240 --> 07:45.240]  And then there's some that smell like really awesomely rancid with like a hybridization of like it's like kind of ugly.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.240]  You know, kind of.
[07:46.240 --> 07:49.240]  But it has the smells that I was looking for in some of those.
[07:49.240 --> 07:53.240]  So I'm excited to see which ones and how they finish out outside.
[07:53.240 --> 07:57.240]  Because there have been completely different plants from inside to outside.
[07:57.240 --> 07:58.240]  You know what I mean?
[07:58.240 --> 08:00.240]  Like completely different.
[08:00.240 --> 08:04.240]  Which, you know, sometimes things are better for outside.
[08:04.240 --> 08:12.240]  Those are, you know, those are plants that are from generational breeding outside in Afghanistan and were built to be tough and all those other things.
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.240]  So maybe it's a part of the, you know, a part of it, you know, with the natural light situation.
[08:18.240 --> 08:19.240]  What about you, London?
[08:19.240 --> 08:22.240]  Did you have yours in some natural light in the greenhouse situation?
[08:22.240 --> 08:24.240]  Or you're all light?
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.240]  Yeah, like during the vegetative stage, they get a lot of natural daylight.
[08:29.240 --> 08:35.240]  My males that I have, like I mean, the plants that I have are brilliant.
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.240]  Just straight up.
[08:36.240 --> 08:38.240]  They've been really, really freaking happy.
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.240]  I'm going to grab my headset in a second here and get showing them.
[08:41.240 --> 08:43.240]  I have three females.
[08:43.240 --> 08:55.240]  One is just ridiculous on the yield, like huge, thick, thick buds and really pushing it out and really, really got a brilliant stank rancid.
[08:55.240 --> 08:58.240]  The other two are not yielding very well.
[08:58.240 --> 09:07.240]  They all have very thick leaves, but the other two just they just aren't quite as strong as the other as the first.
[09:07.240 --> 09:10.240]  They're all brilliant and they're all very unique.
[09:10.240 --> 09:22.240]  One was put in a little bit later, but the other two are going to start going into their last two to three week cycle and coming down in just before the unicorn cup coming up here.
[09:22.240 --> 09:30.240]  So I'm excited to see how they turn out, like they were out at the wedding and people walking by them and like a rancid, they're beautiful shaped plants.
[09:30.240 --> 09:36.240]  Yeah, like like got a little bit of a fishy stank to it, like funk, like like umami, like fucking rot.
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.240]  It's it's it's tough to explain.
[09:40.240 --> 09:48.240]  But it's it's it's it's not like dead corpse, but it's like it's that really.
[09:48.240 --> 09:59.240]  It's like a rank cheese, you know, like you got that funk, but you're like, hmm, you know, like that's like, you know, when you find a woman that you really love, but she smells a bit odd and you're like, I really like that smell.
[09:59.240 --> 10:04.240]  I don't know why I like that smell. Like when you find the right way, you know what I mean?
[10:04.240 --> 10:07.240]  Right. Like everybody knows what I mean.
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.240]  Like when you find the one you're like, oh, that's like they don't their their pit stink ain't so bad.
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.240]  That's what she's like. She's got she's got pretty smelling pit stink to me.
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.240]  But other than that, it's really I'm going to I'm going to put on the other headset and get in there.
[10:21.240 --> 10:29.240]  Well, while you jump into it, but I haven't had like the plants have vigor and strength, like a lot of vigor and strength.
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.240]  I haven't seen any weakness. I haven't seen any hard outliers.
[10:33.240 --> 10:41.240]  There's definitely you're going to see some morphology differences, but you're definitely have a different, unique shape profile.
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.240]  They're not they're not like they're strong like the other ones I've gotten two gallon pots.
[10:45.240 --> 10:48.240]  They're like four and a half feet fucking tall males.
[10:48.240 --> 10:54.240]  And and like I haven't watered them. They're just like pretty much I'm letting them die right now, which I shouldn't be because I should let them fall.
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.240]  I just been so fucking busy. I just they're in the corner. I got to lean a little bit further to get in.
[11:00.240 --> 11:08.240]  But yeah, big, strong, very viable, very hardy plants and able to take lack of water and able to take all this stuff.
[11:08.240 --> 11:13.240]  So they were really quite happy and able to take the punishment, which is nice to see.
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.240]  But the men's structure was a lot different.
[11:17.240 --> 11:26.240]  And also one thing that I didn't notice with the men is they took a lot more time to show, which is a little bit different than what I'm personally used to.
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.240]  Men usually have this like, oh, my God, I'm going to push this out real quick.
[11:31.240 --> 11:34.240]  And I don't like these. These didn't do that.
[11:34.240 --> 11:39.240]  These were like I was struggling to like, OK, this is a girl, the girl, the girl.
[11:39.240 --> 11:47.240]  I'm like, could this be because it's got that really even even the males have that really upward shape, shape into their flowers.
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.240]  It's very cool. But I'm going to go do that. I'm going to let Coastal jump in because he looks like he's got something to say.
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.240]  Well, I set up my other headset. He's 100 percent correct.
[11:56.240 --> 12:06.240]  I was growing purple haze alongside the cameras and, you know, purple haze obviously takes 14 to like 20 weeks to fucking flower.
[12:06.240 --> 12:13.240]  And the cameras were like showing their male flowers slower than the freaking purple haze males.
[12:13.240 --> 12:21.240]  It was hilarious. And the way you breed purple haze is you kill all the males that are slow and you just keep the ones that are fast.
[12:21.240 --> 12:30.240]  And oh, by the way, all of you guys get privy to the pollen that I'm doing the run on.
[12:30.240 --> 12:35.240]  I'm just going to email Peter and see how we're going to do that.
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.240]  But all you guys get free pollen from original purple haze from 1969.
[12:39.240 --> 12:46.240]  And yeah, I'm taking care of everyone in the FCP family.
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.240]  But it was it was hilarious. It was so funny.
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.240]  Like these these these hazes were so much like faster than even the KMR was in it.
[12:56.240 --> 13:11.240]  And he was completely right about that one. So I just want to point that one out because like something that is that slow, like a Colombian to to do outpace an Afghani was was kind of weird to see.
[13:12.240 --> 13:27.240]  This is odd. I knew that they were a little bit, you know, they were like they were they were a lot even for me, like, you know, maybe maybe a tad behind, but right around even, which males are usually earlier for me.
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.240]  And like, you know, kind of, you know, so that was something that that is definitely noticeable.
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.240]  My favorite out of all of them has been the ice cream cake, Kandahar on the smoke.
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.240]  The most powerful was the SFE so far.
[13:41.240 --> 13:51.240]  And the ones that I'm most excited to see is those PAM 15s and the Royal because the Royal I don't know really what's going to happen there.
[13:51.240 --> 13:58.240]  And the plants that I see are really, really cool. But the ice cream cake has been the best.
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.240]  I've had that dark chocolate bag for a while. I've been smoking on that.
[14:02.240 --> 14:09.240]  It's been it's good. It's good smoke, you know, and it looks it looks modern still without all the.
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.240]  The extra.
[14:12.240 --> 14:14.240]  Yeah, look at that.
[14:14.240 --> 14:24.490]  What week are you at?
[14:24.490 --> 14:26.490]  London.
[14:26.490 --> 14:35.200]  I don't know if he gave me.
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.200]  He might not be able to hear you. He's talking.
[14:39.200 --> 14:42.200]  I have to repeat it. But those flowers look awesome.
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.200]  They're pretty much done. Ready to go.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.200]  Now, can you guys hear me now?
[14:48.200 --> 14:50.200]  Oh, yeah.
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.200]  Yeah. OK, I could hear you.
[14:53.200 --> 14:56.200]  I guess you guys can hear me. I was saying, like, look at the thickness on that.
[14:56.200 --> 14:58.200]  But it's just ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:58.200 --> 15:01.200]  Yeah. We didn't hear you. You're like there. But no, that bud looks bad.
[15:01.200 --> 15:03.200]  Yeah, that was dense.
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.200]  And that's kind of how the whole whole plant has worked out in general.
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.200]  Really, really nice. And you can see the thick all the way around.
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.200]  And then here you can see this one's gone super purple.
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.860]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[15:20.860 --> 15:28.860]  Very stacky, way smaller on the yield size that went in at the same time as the big fat one you see here.
[15:28.860 --> 15:33.860]  So you can see it very, very, very different on the morphology for sure.
[15:33.860 --> 15:35.860]  What's that one smelling like?
[15:35.860 --> 15:41.860]  A little bit more stanky, a little bit more fish and rants, rancidness, a little bit more gaminess, as I would say.
[15:41.860 --> 15:45.860]  This one's got funk. It's like rancid with funk.
[15:45.860 --> 15:48.860]  And this one still hasn't quite pushed out yet.
[15:48.860 --> 15:51.860]  This is a little bit younger of a plant.
[15:51.860 --> 15:54.860]  And you can see she's a little bit smaller.
[15:54.860 --> 15:57.860]  The stacking is a little it's hard to see with my other light there.
[15:57.860 --> 15:59.860]  Just let me switch around size.
[15:59.860 --> 16:02.860]  Make it work a little bit better.
[16:03.860 --> 16:09.980]  And then that coming through.
[16:09.980 --> 16:11.980]  Okay. Can you guys see?
[16:11.980 --> 16:13.980]  Oh, yeah.
[16:13.980 --> 16:17.980]  You can see it's a little bit kind of meh.
[16:17.980 --> 16:23.980]  But anyways, I've got flat tops.
[16:23.980 --> 16:25.980]  I've got nine.
[16:25.980 --> 16:29.980]  I've got five more of the same of the big bulky one going through.
[16:29.980 --> 16:33.980]  And you can see I thinned out them to about the same size.
[16:33.980 --> 16:37.980]  And this is one more that still needs to be thinned.
[16:37.980 --> 16:40.980]  So I was going to do that during the show today.
[16:40.980 --> 16:42.980]  And thin that out.
[16:42.980 --> 16:46.980]  So afterwards we'll only have five or six of these really chunky guys in there.
[16:46.980 --> 16:48.980]  Which would be really fun.
[16:48.980 --> 16:51.980]  And you can see I cleared them right down.
[16:51.980 --> 16:53.980]  And thinned them out.
[16:53.980 --> 16:55.980]  And I got some of my Acopoco Gold there too.
[16:55.980 --> 16:57.980]  Heck yeah.
[16:57.980 --> 17:00.980]  Out of all of them, which one is your favorite one that you go to?
[17:00.980 --> 17:03.980]  The Acopoco Gold I've been growing for a really long time.
[17:03.980 --> 17:05.980]  Like about four years now.
[17:05.980 --> 17:08.980]  It's gotten weak and it gets powdery mildew a bit.
[17:08.980 --> 17:10.980]  So it's driving me a bit nuts.
[17:10.980 --> 17:12.980]  I have to really make sure to hit it every other day with labs.
[17:12.980 --> 17:17.980]  Otherwise I run into a lot of issues.
[17:17.980 --> 17:20.980]  And then this is what I'm most excited for.
[17:20.980 --> 17:22.980]  Other than yours, of course.
[17:22.980 --> 17:26.980]  This is one of the ones I'm most excited for is this guy.
[17:27.980 --> 17:31.980]  And it's like my second breeding project.
[17:31.980 --> 17:38.980]  Acopoco Gold Landrace Cross with a, what's it called?
[17:38.980 --> 17:41.980]  With my Lemon Cush headband.
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.980]  So I thinned that guy out heavily today as well.
[17:44.980 --> 17:46.980]  Because it was just like super crazy bushy like this one.
[17:46.980 --> 17:48.980]  You can see how thick that is.
[17:48.980 --> 17:49.980]  But very different leaf shape.
[17:49.980 --> 17:51.980]  Completely unique morphology.
[17:51.980 --> 17:54.980]  And that kind of fatness I don't usually get.
[17:54.980 --> 17:57.980]  Like those fat lower buds that pop out.
[17:57.980 --> 18:02.980]  And it seems to be, what I really like is, you know how some flowers have that maturity rate?
[18:02.980 --> 18:05.980]  Where they mature all together.
[18:05.980 --> 18:08.980]  Like the lower buds seem to develop just as well as the top buds.
[18:08.980 --> 18:10.980]  Even though they don't get as much light.
[18:10.980 --> 18:12.980]  It seems to distribute the energy a little bit nicer.
[18:12.980 --> 18:15.980]  That's what I'm kind of seeing with this plant a lot.
[18:15.980 --> 18:22.980]  Like some of the lower stuff that isn't in the head as much is still really well developed.
[18:22.980 --> 18:27.980]  Even though that's a really kind of a low-lyer one.
[18:27.980 --> 18:29.980]  Heck yeah.
[18:29.980 --> 18:32.980]  When are you going to pull those down?
[18:32.980 --> 18:33.980]  Two weeks.
[18:33.980 --> 18:35.980]  A week and a half.
[18:35.980 --> 18:36.980]  A little bit of time.
[18:36.980 --> 18:37.980]  Not going to rush it.
[18:37.980 --> 18:38.980]  Take some time with it.
[18:38.980 --> 18:41.980]  I like to push the first ones too far.
[18:41.980 --> 18:43.980]  And see like how far they can go.
[18:43.980 --> 18:45.980]  At least 63 days, nine weeks.
[18:45.980 --> 18:49.980]  If I can push it a little bit longer, I'll try.
[18:49.980 --> 18:51.980]  Not much of a guarantee.
[18:51.980 --> 18:52.980]  And then I'll grab these.
[18:52.980 --> 18:55.980]  So this is a mum of the one plant.
[18:55.980 --> 19:00.980]  You were talking, Mr. Trees, you were talking about doing some breeding with some of the Atlas seeds.
[19:00.980 --> 19:01.980]  Weren't you?
[19:01.980 --> 19:03.980]  Was it you that I was talking to?
[19:03.980 --> 19:04.980]  Maybe not.
[19:04.980 --> 19:06.980]  Some of the what?
[19:06.980 --> 19:07.980]  Atlas seed bank.
[19:07.980 --> 19:08.980]  Are you familiar with them?
[19:08.980 --> 19:09.980]  No.
[19:09.980 --> 19:10.980]  No.
[19:10.980 --> 19:11.980]  No.
[19:11.980 --> 19:12.980]  Maybe I got the wrong brand.
[19:12.980 --> 19:13.980]  But yeah.
[19:13.980 --> 19:14.980]  Got some of those.
[19:14.980 --> 19:15.980]  And a whole bunch of other stuff.
[19:15.980 --> 19:18.980]  And then of course the garden is like blooming like nuts.
[19:19.980 --> 19:21.980]  Actually, you guys are back garden.
[19:21.980 --> 19:22.980]  Actually, no.
[19:22.980 --> 19:24.980]  I'm not going to have connection back there.
[19:24.980 --> 19:25.980]  So we'll skip that.
[19:25.980 --> 19:30.150]  And I want to see Cory's gear next.
[19:30.150 --> 19:35.150]  Were they with those ice cream cakes, they make it in your wedding photos?
[19:35.150 --> 19:36.150]  Yeah, they did.
[19:36.150 --> 19:39.150]  They were front and center.
[19:39.150 --> 19:43.150]  Like when everybody came in, they got immediate view of them.
[19:43.150 --> 19:47.150]  Because they were like right by where you pick up the confetti and stuff like that.
[19:48.150 --> 19:51.150]  Everybody's walking over smelling them and checking them out.
[19:51.150 --> 19:52.150]  It's pretty cool.
[19:52.150 --> 19:53.150]  That's cool.
[19:53.150 --> 19:54.150]  That is cool.
[19:54.150 --> 19:55.150]  That's way cool.
[19:55.150 --> 19:57.150]  All right.
[20:01.150 --> 20:05.450]  How close are you, Cory?
[20:05.450 --> 20:06.450]  Pulling something down.
[20:06.450 --> 20:09.450]  I am day 42.
[20:09.450 --> 20:10.450]  Day 42.
[20:10.450 --> 20:14.450]  I'll put my camera around here.
[20:14.450 --> 20:24.110]  Yeah, I reckon I would be about day 50.
[20:24.110 --> 20:25.110]  So yeah.
[20:25.110 --> 20:30.110]  So these two here were the two slowest to get dotted.
[20:30.110 --> 20:35.110]  And this is, I don't know.
[20:35.110 --> 20:39.110]  It just seems like a strange.
[20:39.110 --> 20:44.150]  And then this one here is just.
[20:45.150 --> 20:47.150]  That's the slow starter there.
[20:47.150 --> 20:48.150]  This one here is super slow.
[20:48.150 --> 20:50.150]  Yeah, I mean, day 42.
[20:50.150 --> 20:54.150]  What do you think about the leaf shape on that one?
[20:54.150 --> 21:00.150]  Even like Mr. Treeves, those are some funky, weird leaves too.
[21:00.150 --> 21:04.150]  They're very different from anything I've got out of your gear.
[21:04.150 --> 21:05.150]  That's what I saw.
[21:05.150 --> 21:07.150]  I saw the same thing.
[21:07.150 --> 21:10.150]  Like these lighter leaves on the slower growing plants.
[21:11.150 --> 21:13.150]  And they were just like, they were just.
[21:13.150 --> 21:16.150]  And they had exactly the same situation.
[21:16.150 --> 21:17.150]  Yeah.
[21:17.150 --> 21:18.150]  Yeah.
[21:18.150 --> 21:24.150]  These here are definitely a little bit different looking as far as what I'm
[21:24.150 --> 21:25.150]  used to shape wise.
[21:25.150 --> 21:26.150]  But here again, I mean,
[21:26.150 --> 21:30.150]  I can't go by what I'm used to because I don't have a lot of experience.
[21:30.150 --> 21:31.150]  So.
[21:31.150 --> 21:34.150]  Yeah, those ones look good.
[21:34.150 --> 21:35.150]  Those ones look good.
[21:35.150 --> 21:36.150]  They're stacking up.
[21:36.150 --> 21:37.150]  They're pushing up.
[21:37.150 --> 21:38.150]  Yeah.
[21:38.150 --> 21:44.150]  It's just odd to me how they're just in, you know, all together.
[21:44.150 --> 21:48.150]  So I was like chasing my tail thinking it was a light leak or a bug.
[21:48.150 --> 21:54.150]  And, you know, I, you know, just, I think that they're just taken differently.
[21:54.150 --> 21:56.150]  That's crazy.
[21:56.150 --> 21:59.150]  Day 42 and there's just nothing on there.
[21:59.150 --> 22:00.150]  It's nothing going.
[22:00.150 --> 22:01.150]  It's weird.
[22:01.150 --> 22:02.150]  I mean, like.
[22:02.150 --> 22:03.150]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[22:03.150 --> 22:06.150]  It doesn't look bad.
[22:06.150 --> 22:07.150]  No, no.
[22:07.150 --> 22:08.150]  The plant's healthy.
[22:08.150 --> 22:10.150]  I mean, you know, it's a little bit lighter.
[22:10.150 --> 22:11.150]  Yeah.
[22:11.150 --> 22:16.150]  It's, you know, but the plant's healthy really, but no, this plant here,
[22:16.150 --> 22:17.150]  this plant here.
[22:17.150 --> 22:18.150]  Oh boy.
[22:18.150 --> 22:20.150]  The stink on this one.
[22:20.150 --> 22:22.150]  It's it's.
[22:22.150 --> 22:26.150]  I can only think about it the way you've explained some things before that,
[22:26.150 --> 22:34.150]  that, that cigar store, stinky BO kind of just, just, yeah.
[22:35.150 --> 22:36.150]  That's it's got a really.
[22:36.150 --> 22:37.150]  Yeah.
[22:37.150 --> 22:41.150]  It's it's it's those two plants right there.
[22:41.150 --> 22:46.150]  And then your, your other plant that I have in here, I'm sorry,
[22:46.150 --> 22:48.150]  but a lot of people like this plant.
[22:48.150 --> 22:50.150]  This one here.
[22:50.150 --> 22:55.150]  I had to support it today because it's starting to fall down and yeah.
[22:55.150 --> 22:56.150]  Same thing.
[22:56.150 --> 22:57.150]  Day 42.
[22:57.150 --> 23:03.150]  You know, this plant's a beast, but between these plants and then I've got
[23:03.150 --> 23:06.150]  a couple of other ones that smell like strawberry.
[23:06.150 --> 23:12.150]  It's just, I have this rotten, nasty, horrible fruit, like, you know,
[23:12.150 --> 23:15.150]  back room of a, of a, of a fruit stand.
[23:15.150 --> 23:19.150]  That's kind of a little bit rotted and like a terrible awful BO smell.
[23:19.150 --> 23:22.150]  And yeah, it's, it's pretty sweet.
[23:22.150 --> 23:23.150]  It's pretty sweet.
[23:23.150 --> 23:25.150]  But yeah, these, these girls are just,
[23:25.150 --> 23:29.150]  they're all acting a little bit different and yeah, no, I mean,
[23:29.150 --> 23:32.150]  I'm going to run them until they're done and see what they do.
[23:32.150 --> 23:36.150]  I mean, this one in the future, you know?
[23:36.150 --> 23:37.150]  Yeah.
[23:37.150 --> 23:40.150]  That one, the, the, the tall one, the one that's pushing up the, the,
[23:40.150 --> 23:42.150]  yeah, that, that one's got a lot.
[23:42.150 --> 23:43.150]  I mean, that looks, that looks good.
[23:43.150 --> 23:45.150]  It's got a lot of OG shape to it.
[23:45.150 --> 23:47.150]  It's got a little bit of that crawl going on.
[23:47.150 --> 23:49.150]  Leaves are a little different.
[23:49.150 --> 23:51.150]  That looks, I mean, that looks like a good plant, you know, overall.
[23:51.150 --> 23:52.150]  I like that.
[23:52.150 --> 23:53.150]  It looks nice.
[23:53.150 --> 23:54.150]  And that other one's got multi tops.
[23:54.150 --> 23:55.150]  That looks good.
[23:55.150 --> 23:58.150]  I mean, the same way it's got the same type of pointy.
[23:58.150 --> 23:59.150]  Pretty similar.
[24:00.150 --> 24:02.150]  It's just got a little bit more leaps.
[24:02.150 --> 24:06.150]  It's, you know, a little bushy.
[24:06.150 --> 24:09.150]  But yeah, no, those two smells great.
[24:09.150 --> 24:10.150]  Real, real nice.
[24:10.150 --> 24:13.150]  I can't wait to see how they, how they translate.
[24:13.150 --> 24:14.150]  Yeah.
[24:14.150 --> 24:17.150]  I'm interested on those funky little, those, those slow pokes.
[24:17.150 --> 24:18.150]  That's that's wacky.
[24:18.150 --> 24:20.150]  That's cool.
[24:20.150 --> 24:24.150]  It could turn out to be something super interesting and, and, you know,
[24:24.150 --> 24:27.150]  Worth the weight or it could just be trash, you know?
[24:28.150 --> 24:30.150]  If you're willing to run them, that's, that's, that's awesome.
[24:30.150 --> 24:32.150]  I've gotten, you know, nothing else to do with them.
[24:32.150 --> 24:33.150]  They're not harming anything.
[24:33.150 --> 24:34.150]  I haven't seen.

[24:47.150 --> 24:48.150]  We're going to do this.
[24:48.150 --> 24:50.150]  We're going to do this with some other cool stuff.
[24:50.150 --> 24:52.150]  You know, we're always going to have fun stuff to go, you know,
[24:52.150 --> 24:56.150]  we'll never be late on, on new fun stuff to get excited about, you know?
[24:58.150 --> 25:00.150]  You guys, you guys are awesome.
[25:00.150 --> 25:01.150]  I appreciate you guys.
[25:01.150 --> 25:02.150]  Oh, no, thank you.
[25:02.150 --> 25:04.150]  This is a lot of fun for us.
[25:04.150 --> 25:05.150]  I know I'm speaking for myself.
[25:05.150 --> 25:06.150]  Anyways, a lot of fun.
[25:07.150 --> 25:11.150]  I look forward to it every couple of weeks, you know, and yeah, no,
[25:11.150 --> 25:12.150]  it's good time.
[25:13.150 --> 25:14.150]  Hell yeah.
[25:14.150 --> 25:16.150]  I've got nothing better to do.
[25:16.150 --> 25:17.150]  I'm retired now.
[25:17.150 --> 25:18.150]  So
[25:20.150 --> 25:22.150]  growing weed is pretty much all I do now.
[25:23.150 --> 25:24.150]  That's the bomb.
[25:26.150 --> 25:27.150]  I love that, man.
[25:27.150 --> 25:29.150]  It's good for the soul and all, on all levels.
[25:29.150 --> 25:31.150]  Just growing the plant is, you know,
[25:32.150 --> 25:35.150]  So the cowboy caviar is sold out.
[25:35.150 --> 25:37.150]  I think I bought the last one.
[25:38.150 --> 25:39.150]  Oh yeah.
[25:39.150 --> 25:41.150]  There's a little, yeah, the little, little pre thing.
[25:41.150 --> 25:42.150]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:42.150 --> 25:43.150]  That's the shit.

[25:44.150 --> 25:45.150]  That's the, oh no, thank you.

[25:47.150 --> 25:48.150]  I saw you.
[25:48.150 --> 25:49.150]  I saw you.
[25:49.150 --> 25:50.150]  I saw you.
[25:50.150 --> 25:51.150]  Oh no, thank you.
[25:51.150 --> 25:52.150]  I got excited.
[25:52.150 --> 25:54.150]  I seen you on your video and talking about it.
[25:54.150 --> 25:55.150]  I go, oh shit.
[25:55.150 --> 25:56.150]  I forgotten.
[25:56.150 --> 25:57.150]  I ran over.
[25:57.150 --> 26:00.150]  I think I bought the last one that worked out great up there.
[26:00.150 --> 26:03.150]  I'm waiting for a, I'm waiting for some label stuff to get
[26:03.150 --> 26:06.150]  delivered and I gotta get things, you know,
[26:06.150 --> 26:09.150]  counted out and, and you know, put in packs with little info on stuff.
[26:10.150 --> 26:12.150]  So yeah, there's going to be a couple,
[26:12.150 --> 26:15.150]  there's going to be some that are, are going to head over to dog.
[26:15.150 --> 26:19.150]  A dog is going to get some Royal Cush SFE.
[26:19.150 --> 26:24.150]  SFE Femmes, the Cowboy Caviar and the Lifeguard.
[26:24.470 --> 26:26.930]  We're up on my site there.
[26:26.930 --> 26:28.570]  And then there's one more.
[26:28.570 --> 26:29.770]  What is the other one?
[26:29.770 --> 26:33.150]  SFV S1, a couple of those.
[26:33.150 --> 26:35.030]  I'm gonna head over to DAGA too.
[26:36.310 --> 26:38.330]  And a few things like that.
[26:38.330 --> 26:40.010]  A few of those Femmes are gonna be coming.
[26:40.010 --> 26:44.150]  So yeah, that's one of the ones we're gonna play around.
[26:44.150 --> 26:46.410]  We're gonna play with Cowboy Caviar for a long time.
[26:46.410 --> 26:49.130]  I'm gonna remake that one a whole bunch.
[26:49.130 --> 26:52.190]  We're gonna keep that one in the cycle.
[26:52.190 --> 26:56.370]  That's Dog Walker to that SFV reversal.
[26:56.370 --> 26:59.110]  So that it's the Femme seed.
[26:59.110 --> 27:04.110]  It's, yeah, my two favorite plants kind of together there.
[27:04.510 --> 27:08.290]  So I'm excited to go through a lot of those.
[27:08.290 --> 27:10.710]  And the Lifeguard, that has been the one
[27:10.710 --> 27:13.510]  that everybody hands down always asks me for
[27:13.510 --> 27:15.590]  and everybody always grows and they find stuff
[27:15.590 --> 27:17.270]  that they wanna keep around.
[27:17.290 --> 27:22.290]  And it's one that has hit all the marks, 10 fold.
[27:22.850 --> 27:26.770]  So I'm glad that I can remake that one and get those going.
[27:26.770 --> 27:29.490]  But next, mid, late August,
[27:29.490 --> 27:33.010]  we'll have some of those Femmes ready to rock and roll.
[27:33.010 --> 27:37.210]  So you'll get some extra special treats for the support
[27:39.690 --> 27:41.570]  and taking advantage of the deals, dude.
[27:41.570 --> 27:42.410]  You know what I mean?
[27:42.410 --> 27:43.970]  So that's cool.
[27:43.970 --> 27:48.970]  I already put in a pre-order right now for the SFVS one.
[27:49.110 --> 27:50.770]  I wanna pack.
[27:52.770 --> 27:54.870]  Yeah, we're gonna put some fruit up
[27:54.870 --> 27:57.910]  and probably later today or tomorrow,
[27:57.910 --> 28:00.710]  I'll put some fruit boxes up, some funky stuff like that.
[28:02.270 --> 28:03.110]  Damn it.
[28:03.110 --> 28:04.910]  And this is like only for the locals.
[28:04.910 --> 28:06.430]  Cool stuff all the way around.
[28:06.430 --> 28:08.310]  This is like only for your local tribe,
[28:08.310 --> 28:10.130]  like the California market, right?
[28:11.990 --> 28:13.630]  Some stuff is not.
[28:14.290 --> 28:15.130]  So some stuff is,
[28:15.130 --> 28:16.610]  like there's some stuff like citrus and mangoes
[28:16.610 --> 28:18.050]  that I can't get rid of.
[28:18.050 --> 28:20.650]  There's some that I can't ship
[28:20.650 --> 28:24.570]  because of agricultural dangers.
[28:25.770 --> 28:29.610]  But there are other things like blackberries
[28:29.610 --> 28:34.610]  and boysenberries and papayas and moringa trees
[28:34.770 --> 28:37.050]  and aloes and weird stuff like that
[28:37.050 --> 28:39.730]  that I'm gonna start putting out there.
[28:39.730 --> 28:41.290]  So that'd be cool.
[28:42.130 --> 28:43.050]  Very cool.
[28:43.790 --> 28:45.450]  I'm gonna be sending some,
[28:45.450 --> 28:47.190]  I'm working on some casting balls.
[28:47.190 --> 28:49.790]  We're gonna get some casting balls
[28:49.790 --> 28:52.710]  and some femme stuff over to Daga,
[28:52.710 --> 28:54.430]  hopefully in the next week or two.
[28:55.630 --> 28:58.430]  We were gonna do it last week, but didn't make it work.
[28:58.430 --> 29:00.230]  So I couldn't make it happen.
[29:00.230 --> 29:04.350]  So we're gonna do it later this week, hopefully.
[29:04.350 --> 29:05.390]  When Peter gets back.
[29:08.430 --> 29:10.350]  We'll have some cool stuff to play with.
[29:10.350 --> 29:12.230]  I've got some candahar.
[29:13.790 --> 29:14.750]  Pure stock.
[29:16.830 --> 29:19.190]  I wanna run some of that pure stock.
[29:19.190 --> 29:22.310]  It's not in a wifi friendly area.
[29:22.310 --> 29:24.070]  So I'll do some video or something
[29:24.070 --> 29:26.910]  and we'll do something so you guys can see
[29:26.910 --> 29:28.550]  some of that stuff, which is kind of cool.
[29:28.550 --> 29:31.230]  So you can kind of see some of the pure stuff.
[29:32.910 --> 29:33.750]  Which would be cool.
[29:33.750 --> 29:34.570]  Give us a good reference.
[29:34.570 --> 29:36.190]  It'd be very neat to see.
[29:36.190 --> 29:37.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:37.430 --> 29:38.790]  I'll work on that.
[29:38.790 --> 29:41.350]  So they're just getting to the point where
[29:41.850 --> 29:43.970]  it'll be something to look at.
[29:43.970 --> 29:45.530]  So it'll be nice.
[29:47.850 --> 29:48.730]  I'm super excited.
[29:48.730 --> 29:50.490]  I've been chatting with so many great people.
[29:50.490 --> 29:52.930]  It's been such a good year so far this year.
[29:52.930 --> 29:56.730]  I was chatting with Ron, who was on the episode last week,
[29:56.730 --> 29:58.650]  last time we were on, the guy that popped on.
[29:58.650 --> 30:00.930]  Or no, the episode before that,
[30:00.930 --> 30:03.330]  the Canadian guy that popped on for a little bit.
[30:04.530 --> 30:05.370]  The breeder.
[30:08.690 --> 30:09.890]  The tomato guy, yeah.
[30:09.910 --> 30:12.590]  We were chatting about doing a show called The Sift
[30:12.590 --> 30:15.350]  and bringing on some really cool breeders on for that one
[30:15.350 --> 30:17.070]  and doing some neat things.
[30:17.070 --> 30:19.430]  I was chatting with Doc Ray yesterday
[30:19.430 --> 30:21.470]  about having him come on one of the first episodes
[30:21.470 --> 30:22.830]  of The Sift with this guy.
[30:22.830 --> 30:24.630]  And it'd kind of be really neat.
[30:24.630 --> 30:25.470]  Yeah, that's cool.
[30:25.470 --> 30:26.390]  That's cool.
[30:26.390 --> 30:28.970]  Yeah, between that and the unicorn cup that's coming up,
[30:28.970 --> 30:31.630]  I'm really, something's clicking in the background.
[30:31.630 --> 30:32.630]  It's driving me nuts.
[30:34.470 --> 30:35.830]  Let me see here.
[30:35.830 --> 30:37.830]  So what, is that unicorn cup?
[30:37.830 --> 30:39.390]  Is that a Canada thing?
[30:39.890 --> 30:40.710]  What's the deal with that?
[30:40.710 --> 30:41.550]  What is that?
[30:41.550 --> 30:42.690]  Yeah, it's in the Kootenays.
[30:42.690 --> 30:43.770]  It's pretty cool.
[30:45.250 --> 30:46.410]  Where's the clicking come from?
[30:46.410 --> 30:47.650]  Do you guys hear the clicking too?
[30:47.650 --> 30:48.550]  Is it just me?
[30:49.810 --> 30:51.010]  Maybe it's a bit.
[30:51.010 --> 30:52.930]  Yeah, definitely.
[30:52.930 --> 30:54.810]  I think it was from you, Mr. Tree.
[30:54.810 --> 30:55.630]  So there you go.
[30:55.630 --> 30:57.290]  Thank you for muting.
[30:57.290 --> 30:58.910]  So actually I got a cool thing
[30:58.910 --> 31:00.150]  because Shay might join us.
[31:00.150 --> 31:01.150]  I don't know for sure.
[31:01.150 --> 31:02.190]  Hi there, Corey.
[31:02.190 --> 31:03.530]  It's great to see you.
[31:03.530 --> 31:05.170]  I know, it's too much though.
[31:05.170 --> 31:06.370]  I petered you right there.
[31:06.370 --> 31:07.510]  I petered you hard.
[31:08.170 --> 31:10.690]  That came out so weird.
[31:10.690 --> 31:13.170]  When you think about saying that, I petered you?
[31:16.810 --> 31:18.410]  Sorry, I just totally distracted myself.
[31:18.410 --> 31:19.730]  It is so freaking hot here.
[31:19.730 --> 31:21.570]  It's amazing.
[31:21.570 --> 31:23.250]  It's crazy.
[31:23.250 --> 31:24.770]  But anyway, so I'm excited
[31:24.770 --> 31:27.050]  because I got the judges pack.
[31:27.050 --> 31:31.290]  So I've got the flower judges pack here with me right now.
[31:31.290 --> 31:33.410]  So it's in the Kootenays.
[31:33.410 --> 31:34.650]  You can actually go to see it.
[31:34.650 --> 31:35.470]  Let me see here.
[31:35.490 --> 31:38.890]  I'll bring up the share and maybe what you guys can do.
[31:38.890 --> 31:42.930]  What I wanna do today was actually have you guys
[31:42.930 --> 31:46.130]  judge some with me on the show.
[31:46.130 --> 31:48.810]  Cause a good portion of it is actually like what the
[31:48.810 --> 31:53.550]  visibly what it looks like and such like that.
[31:53.550 --> 31:56.170]  So it's actually a pretty big part of it.
[31:56.170 --> 31:57.490]  So it's music and headliners.
[31:57.490 --> 31:58.370]  So what we'll do at first,
[31:58.370 --> 32:00.010]  I'll just give you like a rundown
[32:00.010 --> 32:03.130]  and you get to see like there's music education, camping,
[32:03.130 --> 32:04.490]  and it's a competition.
[32:04.510 --> 32:08.390]  Actually any VIP, any person that pays for the VIP ticket
[32:08.390 --> 32:10.150]  gets to be a judge.
[32:10.150 --> 32:12.190]  So anybody can do that.
[32:12.190 --> 32:13.030]  It's pretty cool.
[32:13.030 --> 32:16.070]  It's coming up in like less than two weeks now.
[32:16.070 --> 32:18.030]  There's still tickets available that you can go to,
[32:18.030 --> 32:20.110]  but we've decided to meet you a partner with them.
[32:20.110 --> 32:23.110]  They have, if I go to my speaker's schedule,
[32:23.110 --> 32:25.350]  speaker's schedule lined up.
[32:25.350 --> 32:27.390]  Some of the speakers that they have coming up
[32:27.390 --> 32:29.390]  and some of the stuff you're gonna be able to be a part of
[32:29.390 --> 32:30.550]  is a really, really cool.
[32:30.550 --> 32:32.070]  Shay, just a beautiful human being.
[32:32.090 --> 32:34.530]  Hopefully you'll be able to join us at some point tonight.
[32:34.530 --> 32:36.730]  Open agricultural destruction, introduction,
[32:36.730 --> 32:39.110]  introduction to regenerative agriculture,
[32:40.570 --> 32:42.250]  then extract tech.
[32:42.250 --> 32:46.450]  And of course we've got BC Bubble Man, Noelise, Mike West,
[32:46.450 --> 32:48.210]  really good set line up there.
[32:48.210 --> 32:52.010]  Branding Bud with Christina Kaplan.
[32:53.910 --> 32:57.290]  From the front lines of Legacy Recreational Retail,
[32:57.290 --> 32:59.130]  regenerative farming workshop,
[32:59.130 --> 33:01.130]  of course with Josh and Kelly.
[33:01.150 --> 33:03.390]  And they're doing two segments
[33:03.390 --> 33:06.230]  and they're an hour and 20 minutes a pop.
[33:06.230 --> 33:08.390]  So like fucking dopeness.
[33:08.390 --> 33:09.950]  I'm gonna be all up in that.
[33:09.950 --> 33:14.230]  How seed to sale tracking helps regulatory reporting.
[33:14.230 --> 33:16.710]  I might not be inclined.
[33:16.710 --> 33:17.550]  No, I'm just kidding.
[33:17.550 --> 33:19.550]  I'll be listening to all the speakers
[33:19.550 --> 33:20.870]  and I think all this stuff's fantastic,
[33:20.870 --> 33:24.030]  but some of it's a little bit more entertaining
[33:24.030 --> 33:25.130]  than the other stuff.
[33:25.130 --> 33:26.870]  Cannabis genetics round table.
[33:26.870 --> 33:29.070]  That'll be a fun one.
[33:29.090 --> 33:32.330]  Jodri and Marcus BC Bubble Man, great people.
[33:32.330 --> 33:34.170]  Of course there'll be a seed swap,
[33:35.130 --> 33:37.730]  a women's cannabis panel,
[33:37.730 --> 33:38.890]  baking through the glass ceiling.
[33:38.890 --> 33:41.090]  A lot of fantastic people that I've actually,
[33:41.090 --> 33:43.010]  Pamela West, fantastic human being.
[33:43.010 --> 33:46.410]  I've had the opportunity to hear Space Crystal as well.
[33:46.410 --> 33:49.490]  I think I met Shannon before, I'm not too sure.
[33:49.490 --> 33:52.650]  And then of course another regenerative farm workshop,
[33:52.650 --> 33:55.010]  fruity, floral, fuel and earth,
[33:55.010 --> 33:56.930]  four scent categories of cannabis,
[33:56.930 --> 33:58.330]  which is fucking awesome,
[33:58.350 --> 34:00.270]  which we can actually chat about in a second.
[34:00.270 --> 34:01.830]  And I'd love to get your opinions on this
[34:01.830 --> 34:02.870]  because we'll go through
[34:02.870 --> 34:05.150]  kind of the judging methodology as well.
[34:05.150 --> 34:07.510]  Planting guides for Rosebud Farm Program
[34:07.510 --> 34:09.310]  because they're actually trying to help.
[34:09.310 --> 34:11.470]  Okay, so in the Kootenai, so get this,
[34:11.470 --> 34:16.470]  there are 600 or 600 plus growers in the Kootenai, right?
[34:17.550 --> 34:20.750]  And 99% of them are legal.
[34:20.750 --> 34:25.750]  There's about maybe a dozen now that have gone legal.
[34:25.750 --> 34:27.970]  Some are closing and shutting down shop
[34:27.970 --> 34:28.810]  and stuff like that,
[34:28.810 --> 34:31.730]  but there's a huge volume of people in the Kootenai.
[34:31.730 --> 34:33.170]  So there's a lot of stuff.
[34:33.170 --> 34:35.210]  There's actually two packs,
[34:35.210 --> 34:40.210]  one, two packs for personal production growing stuff.
[34:40.950 --> 34:42.710]  So there's a lot of entries.
[34:42.710 --> 34:44.090]  And essentially this is,
[34:44.090 --> 34:47.370]  if you want to understand the region of cannabis
[34:47.370 --> 34:48.490]  and the people growing in it,
[34:48.490 --> 34:50.870]  I think cups like this are the best way possible
[34:50.870 --> 34:53.210]  where you can buy a VIP ticket and get it
[34:53.230 --> 34:57.310]  because this is 30 plus people
[34:57.310 --> 34:59.630]  that are passionate growers in the Kootenai
[34:59.630 --> 35:00.570]  that are so passionate
[35:00.570 --> 35:02.430]  that they'd actually enter it into the competition.
[35:02.430 --> 35:03.270]  Like how cool is that?
[35:03.270 --> 35:05.230]  It's blind, you get to taste all of them.
[35:06.590 --> 35:09.790]  But yeah, so each you send off for the VIP back,
[35:09.790 --> 35:13.430]  you get it sent back and then you actually get to do,
[35:13.430 --> 35:14.930]  and I'll open this up here.
[35:17.430 --> 35:19.470]  I got to remove that one first, don't I?
[35:19.470 --> 35:20.870]  Stop screaming.
[35:20.870 --> 35:21.710]  Actually, you know what?
[35:21.710 --> 35:22.530]  I could have just done this.
[35:22.850 --> 35:24.130]  You're fucking stupid of me.
[35:25.610 --> 35:26.530]  How do I assess?
[35:26.530 --> 35:29.290]  And I'd love, this is where I want your opinion,
[35:29.290 --> 35:30.130]  guys as well.
[35:30.130 --> 35:32.690]  I mean, I appreciate your opinion anytime
[35:32.690 --> 35:33.850]  you guys want to speak.
[35:36.130 --> 35:37.450]  Cause you all know I can talk forever.
[35:37.450 --> 35:38.890]  It's a little bit irritating.
[35:42.420 --> 35:43.720]  And here we go.
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.220]  And there we,
[35:52.220 --> 35:54.900]  tips to help out and assess.
[35:54.940 --> 35:58.140]  So we're going to do some premium dried flower
[35:58.140 --> 36:00.620]  and you guys are going to help me assess it.
[36:00.620 --> 36:03.900]  So it says, we'll start with the appearance portion of it
[36:03.900 --> 36:04.900]  and I'll pull out a flower
[36:04.900 --> 36:07.340]  and you guys can help me decide from it.
[36:07.340 --> 36:10.800]  Cause I've actually got my little mini cam here as well.
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.600]  And that's my flower.
[36:13.600 --> 36:14.620]  So what would you guys,
[36:14.620 --> 36:17.900]  so the rating is right now it's scored of one
[36:17.900 --> 36:19.380]  through 10 for appearances.
[36:19.380 --> 36:21.300]  You can do 10 points max.
[36:21.300 --> 36:22.620]  Let me just have a quick peek.
[36:22.620 --> 36:23.540]  Yes.
[36:23.540 --> 36:26.700]  So for, this is my personal flower.
[36:26.700 --> 36:29.100]  So we'll run through this one as a chance.
[36:29.100 --> 36:32.420]  So evaluated is color vibrant, deep, flat, brownish
[36:32.420 --> 36:33.260]  or yellow.
[36:34.860 --> 36:37.500]  Does the dry bud look loose or compact?
[36:37.500 --> 36:39.720]  Does it crumble or give when breaking?
[36:39.720 --> 36:41.900]  Do buds look or sprinkle?
[36:41.900 --> 36:43.940]  Are buds small, tiny or thumb size?
[36:43.940 --> 36:45.020]  Are they buds leafy?
[36:45.020 --> 36:46.540]  Are they desirable?
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.660]  Vibrant?
[36:47.660 --> 36:48.700]  Does it look good?
[36:48.740 --> 36:51.060]  What do you guys evaluate this bud
[36:52.460 --> 36:55.660]  out of 10 for visual aesthetics?
[36:57.260 --> 36:58.100]  Nine.
[36:59.540 --> 37:02.820]  It doesn't have, it doesn't have like the, the, the,
[37:02.820 --> 37:06.860]  the res that like maybe some other strains have,
[37:06.860 --> 37:10.620]  but it has the morphological characteristics that you want.
[37:10.620 --> 37:12.340]  I'd say it's a nine.
[37:12.340 --> 37:14.740]  It definitely has a lot of resin
[37:14.740 --> 37:16.500]  and it definitely is awesome.
[37:16.500 --> 37:17.980]  And it looks really good.
[37:19.700 --> 37:21.780]  I'd definitely give it a nine.
[37:23.340 --> 37:24.180]  Six.
[37:24.180 --> 37:25.300]  I like the six.
[37:25.300 --> 37:26.220]  Thank you.
[37:26.220 --> 37:27.060]  Thank you.
[37:27.060 --> 37:28.220]  But thank you, Coastal.
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.120]  What do you think?
[37:31.380 --> 37:32.220]  Yeah.
[37:32.220 --> 37:34.340]  I'd say that, that, that looks like,
[37:35.780 --> 37:39.100]  that looks close to like an outdoor style flower.
[37:39.100 --> 37:41.460]  I like the morphological characteristics of it.
[37:41.460 --> 37:44.020]  You can pull off big, small nugs, you know,
[37:44.020 --> 37:47.260]  as, as ball points pretty easily.
[37:47.260 --> 37:48.400]  Can you give it a squeeze?
[37:49.100 --> 37:51.080]  Can you like do like a tack test?
[37:51.080 --> 37:53.320]  Like, does it stick to your finger really easily
[37:53.320 --> 37:54.760]  and pull off?
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.000]  That's stuck to the, okay.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.200]  That's stuck to the, to the lid.
[37:58.200 --> 37:59.040]  That's good.
[37:59.040 --> 38:00.320]  That's good.
[38:00.320 --> 38:01.400]  Right.
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.640]  And watching it, you know, kind of recoil.
[38:05.640 --> 38:07.400]  That's, you know, that's a good,
[38:07.400 --> 38:08.720]  that's a good smoking flower.
[38:08.720 --> 38:10.160]  It's not too dense.
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.000]  I like that.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.880]  I give you a seven and a half on that.
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.920]  You know, I give you a solid seven and a half on that,
[38:14.920 --> 38:17.140]  which is a good, a good fucking score.
[38:18.640 --> 38:21.680]  For, for real standards, you know,
[38:21.680 --> 38:22.800]  I think that is really good.
[38:22.800 --> 38:25.440]  I think that, that stick test just proved a lot.
[38:25.440 --> 38:28.080]  The nose for me is more than anything, right?
[38:28.080 --> 38:30.960]  Like if I can smell something, that's really where
[38:31.960 --> 38:34.520]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna be like, okay, this, this,
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.240]  this was taken care of properly.
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.760]  There's a million other things that I can,
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.060]  I can gauge from, from being able to gauge the aroma.
[38:42.060 --> 38:44.720]  But just the, just seeing,
[38:44.720 --> 38:47.560]  I have seen a billion nugs just like that,
[38:47.680 --> 38:50.600]  that I peel out of a jar and break off and smoke,
[38:50.600 --> 38:51.440]  you know what I mean?
[38:51.440 --> 38:53.640]  From, from a lot of good crops that I pull off.
[38:53.640 --> 38:56.340]  That is a, that's, that is a quality flower.
[38:58.640 --> 38:59.480]  Yeah.
[38:59.480 --> 39:00.480]  Thank you. I appreciate that.
[39:00.480 --> 39:02.120]  I go seven, I go seven and a half,
[39:02.120 --> 39:02.960]  and that's hard to get.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.760]  It's hard to get above a five, you know what I mean?
[39:04.760 --> 39:08.520]  For me, you know, in a lot of cases, it wasn't over-trammed.
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.960]  It wasn't, it wasn't yellow.
[39:10.960 --> 39:12.840]  It didn't look old.
[39:12.840 --> 39:14.600]  There was a million things that I could see
[39:14.600 --> 39:17.300]  from just seeing it that, that, that puts it up there.
[39:19.440 --> 39:22.040]  And the looks don't always mean what, you know,
[39:22.040 --> 39:23.280]  the looks don't always dictate what it is.
[39:23.280 --> 39:24.720]  It's always the wrong thing.
[39:24.720 --> 39:26.040]  Yeah. That's the wrong thing.
[39:26.040 --> 39:27.200]  Exactly.
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.480]  I have some, I have some funky,
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.040]  I don't even know what it is.
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.140]  Cause I don't like it, but it's really, it's really dense.
[39:36.140 --> 39:39.400]  It's like overly dense and like overly resinous.
[39:39.400 --> 39:41.920]  And when it takes like, you literally need a grinder
[39:41.920 --> 39:44.680]  or you have to break it up by hand, really, really small,
[39:44.680 --> 39:47.000]  just to smoke it in the pipe or, you know,
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.880]  rolling a joint with it is like a no-go
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.240]  because it's just too damn dense.
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.680]  You have to really break it down on a grinder
[39:51.680 --> 39:53.820]  and I'll use grinders very often.
[39:53.820 --> 39:56.480]  So like, and it's just, it doesn't burn right.
[39:56.480 --> 39:57.480]  Cause it's too dense.
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.060]  You know, there's a billion reasons why I don't,
[40:00.060 --> 40:03.080]  I don't like that, but it looks like on the, on a screen,
[40:03.080 --> 40:05.260]  if you put it on the screen, you're like, oh my God,
[40:05.260 --> 40:06.400]  that's like, but it's like, no,
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.800]  it's a very poor smoking flower that is more of a pain
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.400]  in the ass than what it's worth, you know?
[40:12.400 --> 40:14.560]  So sometimes, yeah.
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.120]  I hate that dense ass shit.
[40:17.120 --> 40:19.640]  I really hate that dense weed.
[40:19.640 --> 40:24.160]  And when it gets really dense, the calyxes get really tiny
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.320]  and you get less, I feel like it's less potent.
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.000]  You might see like more,
[40:32.680 --> 40:36.380]  like, I guess you'll see more trikes on them,
[40:36.380 --> 40:39.100]  but they're like these tiny dryer trikes
[40:39.140 --> 40:42.180]  that you'll get on these, like a lot of these Afghanis.
[40:42.180 --> 40:45.140]  And they're not like, I don't know.
[40:45.140 --> 40:46.460]  I don't want to smoke it.
[40:46.460 --> 40:48.020]  I don't want to make it into hash.
[40:48.020 --> 40:49.680]  I don't want to smoke that weed.
[40:49.680 --> 40:52.300]  It makes your throat like dry and hurt.
[40:52.300 --> 40:54.900]  And I don't know.
[40:54.900 --> 40:59.900]  It just, to me, the weed also tends to mold more often.
[41:01.580 --> 41:05.540]  It's really susceptible to mold because it's so damn dense.
[41:05.540 --> 41:09.440]  And when you don't have that open structure,
[41:09.440 --> 41:11.340]  you don't have that propensity
[41:11.340 --> 41:14.440]  to allow the trichomes to really develop.
[41:14.440 --> 41:16.820]  So yeah, you might have a ton of trichomes
[41:16.820 --> 41:18.780]  in a dense ass area,
[41:18.780 --> 41:23.460]  but like you're not actually getting them space to grow.
[41:25.020 --> 41:26.780]  And that's why hybridization
[41:26.780 --> 41:29.540]  or just running sativas is ideal.
[41:29.540 --> 41:31.040]  And that's, you know,
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.600]  that's why like these really, really dense indica
[41:35.600 --> 41:36.600]  like you were talking about,
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.700]  they kind of just don't really work.
[41:46.200 --> 41:48.400]  What other flowers you got up there, London?
[41:49.640 --> 41:51.080]  Okay.
[41:51.080 --> 41:52.320]  I have to keep it organized.
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.280]  Cause what happens is there's actually,
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.300]  so what I wanted to show you guys
[41:57.300 --> 42:00.720]  was when you open up the unicorn cup and you get your pack,
[42:00.720 --> 42:03.080]  you can actually access the judging area
[42:03.080 --> 42:05.280]  that is kind of based a little bit off
[42:05.280 --> 42:07.040]  some of the other programs as well.
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.760]  Score out of 50, 20 for smoke and appearance.
[42:11.760 --> 42:14.640]  Let's see, there's 20 points for the smoke ability.
[42:14.640 --> 42:16.840]  How much you enjoy it when you smoke it,
[42:16.840 --> 42:18.680]  which I think is important.
[42:18.680 --> 42:21.920]  So it's a total out of 50, 10 for appearance,
[42:21.920 --> 42:25.800]  10 for a total of 10 for aroma and 10 for flavor.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.800]  When smoked, when combusted and consumed, right?
[42:29.800 --> 42:32.340]  So I've got the first one up here.
[42:32.340 --> 42:34.800]  So what essentially what you do is when you get it,
[42:35.320 --> 42:38.560]  you go online and each one of them have a code.
[42:38.560 --> 42:40.800]  Let me see if I could bring up the code here.
[42:43.160 --> 42:45.160]  See how that has a little code there.
[42:45.160 --> 42:49.600]  So that code will represent one of the things
[42:49.600 --> 42:52.200]  on the checklist that you get,
[42:52.200 --> 42:54.680]  that you sign on through a special login.
[42:54.680 --> 42:56.680]  And you can just log in whenever you want
[42:56.680 --> 42:59.520]  over the next two weeks up until the time
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.000]  that the deadline is and just consume and judge as you go.
[43:03.040 --> 43:04.840]  So you don't have to like sit down and consume it all
[43:04.840 --> 43:06.920]  in one go or anything like that.
[43:06.920 --> 43:08.440]  So this is the code and you get the code
[43:08.440 --> 43:09.960]  and you just match it and give everything
[43:09.960 --> 43:11.680]  a point percentage for it.
[43:11.680 --> 43:12.920]  So let's grab the first flower
[43:12.920 --> 43:14.760]  and I'll get you guys' opinion on it.
[43:18.920 --> 43:20.280]  It's really nice, it does.
[43:24.680 --> 43:25.980]  And I wanna remind you, dude,
[43:25.980 --> 43:28.720]  you got a seven and a half on a flower
[43:28.720 --> 43:31.120]  I couldn't smell or smoke.
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.120]  So like that's a fucking, I was just thinking about that.
[43:36.120 --> 43:37.760]  I'm like, you know, I didn't even smell it.
[43:38.480 --> 43:40.400]  I couldn't touch it, I can't smoke it.
[43:40.400 --> 43:41.960]  I don't know what it tastes like.
[43:41.960 --> 43:43.640]  Wait till you see your flower when it's done.
[43:43.640 --> 43:44.760]  That's just gonna be beast.
[43:44.760 --> 43:46.560]  Like I can just see it right now when it's done.
[43:46.560 --> 43:47.660]  It's gonna be so nice.
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.280]  No, I'm, you know, yeah, you should be proud.
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.120]  That's good.
[43:52.120 --> 43:54.680]  We'll see what these people have in store here.
[43:54.680 --> 43:55.520]  All right.
[43:55.520 --> 43:56.840]  Looks like some inside news.
[43:56.840 --> 43:58.800]  Yeah, it looks like some indoor for sure.
[43:58.800 --> 44:00.640]  It's got a little bit of a purpley hue.
[44:00.640 --> 44:02.400]  It looks a little bit machine done.
[44:03.600 --> 44:05.560]  A little bit compressed from the move.
[44:06.560 --> 44:09.480]  I see some purple tones.
[44:14.090 --> 44:15.050]  Can you get closer?
[44:15.050 --> 44:16.610]  Can you put it on the main screen?
[44:16.610 --> 44:17.610]  Oh yeah, sorry.
[44:17.610 --> 44:19.510]  I guess I can make it look big.
[44:20.810 --> 44:21.650]  Yeah, I can't.
[44:21.650 --> 44:22.470]  Yeah.
[44:27.540 --> 44:29.660]  All right, Corey, you're up.
[44:29.660 --> 44:30.500]  Oh boy.
[44:32.220 --> 44:33.940]  It looks good and colorful
[44:33.940 --> 44:36.240]  and it looks like it has good coverage on it.
[44:39.300 --> 44:40.580]  Yeah, I'm gonna get it.
[44:40.580 --> 44:42.580]  Try and get a deeper look, closer look at it.
[44:42.580 --> 44:44.220]  Let's see if I get a little bit.
[44:50.580 --> 44:51.900]  That focuses all right.
[44:51.900 --> 44:52.740]  Am I right though?
[44:52.740 --> 44:54.260]  Does that look like it's purple?
[44:54.260 --> 44:55.700]  Pretty purple and orange.
[44:55.700 --> 44:57.620]  It's got some purpley-ness to it.
[44:57.620 --> 44:58.720]  Let me see if I could.
[44:59.860 --> 45:00.700]  There you go.
[45:00.700 --> 45:01.980]  That shows some good frost there.
[45:01.980 --> 45:03.240]  Yeah, yeah, it does.
[45:04.140 --> 45:05.580]  Pretty dense looking too.
[45:06.700 --> 45:07.540]  Oh man, I don't know.
[45:07.540 --> 45:09.180]  You want me to put a score on it?
[45:09.180 --> 45:10.500]  Yeah, one of 10.
[45:10.500 --> 45:14.380]  Out of 10, we'll take the average of the room, okay?
[45:14.380 --> 45:17.860]  So out of 10, what would you give this for appearance?
[45:21.380 --> 45:22.220]  I don't know.
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.060]  It's a pretty good looking dog.
[45:23.060 --> 45:26.660]  I guess I'd probably safely say seven.
[45:26.660 --> 45:29.600]  That way we can use that as a barometer moving forward.
[45:33.090 --> 45:33.970]  You got a seven?
[45:33.970 --> 45:35.750]  All right, you're up next, Coastal.
[45:35.750 --> 45:38.770]  What's your opinion on one of 10 of appearance?
[45:49.720 --> 45:51.360]  Sorry, my mic was off.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.220]  How long has that been cured for?
[45:59.140 --> 46:01.700]  Can you hear me?
[46:01.700 --> 46:02.540]  Oh, sorry.
[46:02.540 --> 46:03.540]  Sorry, it's a test.
[46:03.540 --> 46:06.060]  It's a judge's case, so all I get is a number.
[46:06.060 --> 46:09.820]  I don't know anything other than the number.
[46:09.820 --> 46:11.620]  And that doesn't tell you anything
[46:11.620 --> 46:14.980]  other than what section and area it's from.
[46:14.980 --> 46:17.380]  That was a pretty good stickiness, eh?
[46:17.380 --> 46:21.220]  It looks, yeah, it looks like it was probably
[46:21.220 --> 46:24.740]  pulled pretty recently and it was dried recently
[46:24.740 --> 46:26.620]  and it still hasn't been fully cured.
[46:26.620 --> 46:28.540]  That's why it's so sticky.
[46:28.540 --> 46:31.400]  I would give it like a seven or eight,
[46:32.940 --> 46:35.300]  but it looks like it could be a nine or a 10
[46:35.300 --> 46:38.440]  if it got cured out fully.
[46:40.500 --> 46:43.380]  But yeah, it looks like some good stuff.
[46:43.380 --> 46:45.380]  I can see little heads on my fingers,
[46:45.380 --> 46:48.980]  like a lot of little tiny heads that came off very easily.
[46:51.740 --> 46:53.180]  What do you think, Mr. Trees?
[46:54.180 --> 46:57.020]  Yeah, the heads on the finger, I like that.
[46:58.460 --> 46:59.300]  It's really hard.
[46:59.300 --> 47:02.380]  I don't like how flat and hard it is.
[47:02.380 --> 47:06.860]  I wish it would be a little bit more forgiving.
[47:08.220 --> 47:10.700]  I'd like it to respond more when you push it
[47:10.700 --> 47:13.620]  instead of just stick and stay, which Coastal's right on.
[47:13.620 --> 47:18.620]  I think it's just too early, still too wet.
[47:19.060 --> 47:21.340]  Is that stem in there a little green still
[47:21.340 --> 47:23.820]  or is the stem all the way snapping?
[47:26.380 --> 47:28.220]  I'll give it a crack.
[47:28.220 --> 47:30.580]  There's not really much stem in here.
[47:30.580 --> 47:33.260]  Yeah, no, I just like looking at the bottom part.
[47:33.260 --> 47:34.660]  Is it dried out?
[47:34.660 --> 47:36.260]  I mean, it's all the way.
[47:36.260 --> 47:37.420]  It looks like good weed.
[47:37.420 --> 47:41.300]  It's probably on the hard end of dry over anything.
[47:41.300 --> 47:42.580]  It's probably at the lower end.
[47:42.580 --> 47:44.820]  I usually have my stuff at about 22%
[47:44.820 --> 47:47.400]  is where my stuff averages out at.
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.360]  This is probably feeling more like 10 to 13.
[47:51.420 --> 47:54.180]  The color, look at when it popped open there.
[47:54.180 --> 47:57.820]  Yeah, I'd say I'd give that a seven.
[47:57.820 --> 48:01.660]  I'd give that a seven on purely the head sticking
[48:01.660 --> 48:04.220]  to the finger and the stickiness
[48:04.220 --> 48:05.900]  when you were pushing on it.
[48:05.900 --> 48:08.180]  And it does have a good, it's got a good look to it.
[48:08.180 --> 48:10.900]  I mean, it definitely has got a good like color
[48:10.900 --> 48:12.620]  and frost combination there.
[48:12.620 --> 48:15.280]  It's good genetic, whatever it is.
[48:17.180 --> 48:18.660]  But yeah, I think, yeah.
[48:18.660 --> 48:22.540]  Yeah, I think if I was doing, I'd say seven.
[48:22.540 --> 48:23.640]  I'd give that a seven.
[48:31.270 --> 48:32.190]  What's up, Nick?
[48:32.190 --> 48:33.590]  What's up, Nick?
[48:33.590 --> 48:34.710]  How's it going, bro?
[48:37.030 --> 48:39.710]  Dude, I totally forgot about tonight's show.
[48:42.070 --> 48:42.910]  It happens.
[48:46.610 --> 48:47.810]  Just getting off the farm.
[48:47.810 --> 48:50.010]  I've been out there with a headlamp,
[48:50.010 --> 48:51.570]  just trying to get everything cleaned up.
[48:51.570 --> 48:54.330]  It's been raining its ass off here.
[48:54.970 --> 48:58.050]  Everything's starting to do that final stretch,
[48:59.050 --> 49:03.250]  starting to sex, they got the spider tops,
[49:03.250 --> 49:04.370]  they're flowering.
[49:05.730 --> 49:08.490]  So get it all cleaned up.
[49:08.490 --> 49:11.490]  I got 65 plants.
[49:11.490 --> 49:12.850]  I mean, it don't sound like a lot,
[49:12.850 --> 49:16.890]  but when they're all around eight feet tall,
[49:16.890 --> 49:19.370]  that's a bunch, just you and one other person.
[49:22.130 --> 49:23.370]  It's a lot.
[49:23.410 --> 49:24.650]  That's real work.
[49:24.650 --> 49:26.290]  That's work for sure.
[49:26.290 --> 49:28.410]  To do it good, do a good job.
[49:29.290 --> 49:30.330]  That's work, man.
[49:30.330 --> 49:31.170]  It's no joke.
[49:36.450 --> 49:37.810]  You smoking any of your
[49:39.770 --> 49:40.650]  DR stuff yet?
[49:43.050 --> 49:44.970]  Yeah, I smoked that Pam.
[49:45.890 --> 49:48.370]  I felt like I picked it maybe a little early.
[49:48.370 --> 49:53.370]  I've never really ran something indoors that runs that long.
[49:53.370 --> 49:56.890]  We talked about like 10 and a half, 11 weeks.
[49:57.730 --> 50:01.730]  Some of those phenos were probably around 12 and a half,
[50:01.730 --> 50:06.210]  maybe a little, at least another week longer.
[50:07.410 --> 50:11.210]  But yeah, man, dude, that has,
[50:14.250 --> 50:17.010]  I wish I had it with me right here
[50:17.010 --> 50:19.770]  inside my partner's house,
[50:19.770 --> 50:22.570]  but man, it's got some gas,
[50:23.570 --> 50:26.930]  like some fruity gas.
[50:26.930 --> 50:29.010]  Some of it's real nice.
[50:31.210 --> 50:33.370]  The structure, there was only like one of them
[50:33.370 --> 50:36.410]  that I would probably pick for the structure,
[50:36.410 --> 50:39.850]  but the ones that didn't have the structure
[50:39.850 --> 50:44.130]  really had some really good fuel, gassy notes.
[50:44.130 --> 50:48.010]  And I took clones of all of them,
[50:48.010 --> 50:50.410]  so they're in one gallons right now.
[50:51.250 --> 50:53.930]  And I kind of set them outside,
[50:53.930 --> 50:57.890]  just do a little one gallon pheno runs outside of them
[50:57.890 --> 51:02.490]  and see if just get a little,
[51:02.490 --> 51:04.770]  if it shows a little different expression
[51:06.450 --> 51:08.610]  from indoor to outdoor.
[51:08.610 --> 51:12.210]  I ran those under a single ended HPS.
[51:12.210 --> 51:14.530]  It's been a really long time since I've ran
[51:14.530 --> 51:16.930]  or flowered anything under a single end.
[51:17.930 --> 51:22.050]  Maybe I just felt like some of those tent conditions
[51:22.050 --> 51:27.050]  weren't ideal, and it really seems like it's more of a,
[51:30.650 --> 51:33.410]  yeah, and it's more of an outdoor strain.
[51:35.010 --> 51:37.130]  I can just, by the way it grows,
[51:37.130 --> 51:42.130]  like the Royal Kush, it's a phenomenal plant,
[51:42.370 --> 51:44.290]  but it's indoor, just don't run well.
[51:44.290 --> 51:45.250]  It don't yield.
[51:45.250 --> 51:48.130]  It's one of those old school cushy OGs
[51:48.930 --> 51:50.410]  where the vigor's not there,
[51:51.530 --> 51:53.810]  but it's a phenomenal plant outside.
[51:53.810 --> 51:55.570]  It's got great branching.
[51:55.570 --> 51:57.610]  And I feel like the Pam's the same way.
[51:58.610 --> 52:01.570]  I don't know about the Kandahar side,
[52:01.570 --> 52:05.810]  but the ones that were showing the Pam,
[52:05.810 --> 52:08.490]  I mean, my partner and I, we were joking
[52:08.490 --> 52:12.930]  because we got a few plants out there
[52:12.930 --> 52:15.210]  that we just kind of stuck out there last minute.
[52:15.210 --> 52:17.890]  And it's like, man, if something doesn't,
[52:18.650 --> 52:20.850]  if something's not growing here, it wants to
[52:20.850 --> 52:23.010]  because everything fucking grows here.
[52:23.010 --> 52:26.330]  You know, like, dude, we got Bermuda grass.
[52:26.330 --> 52:27.170]  It's so thick.
[52:27.170 --> 52:28.650]  We're still mulching grass.
[52:28.650 --> 52:31.890]  And then you look around, everybody else's grass is dead
[52:31.890 --> 52:33.890]  because it's dry as fuck here.
[52:33.890 --> 52:36.570]  And we finally got some rain, but I mean,
[52:38.090 --> 52:40.250]  yeah, it's definitely one of those ones
[52:40.250 --> 52:43.010]  that I would really like to try outside.
[52:43.850 --> 52:48.850]  I got, you know, three females that I kept
[52:49.130 --> 52:50.930]  and I got one male.
[52:50.930 --> 52:53.570]  So maybe I'll do an F2.
[52:55.330 --> 52:57.170]  You know, I got a few clones.
[52:57.170 --> 52:59.650]  I'm just gonna stick a few of them outside
[52:59.650 --> 53:01.490]  and then keep those clones back
[53:01.490 --> 53:05.050]  and maybe just do the ones that I like better
[53:05.050 --> 53:07.450]  from the outside pick.
[53:07.450 --> 53:09.410]  I'm gonna breed back to one another.
[53:09.410 --> 53:10.810]  Bigger plants though, you know,
[53:10.850 --> 53:14.610]  I'll get at least four or 500 seeds
[53:14.610 --> 53:16.490]  from each plant that I pick.
[53:18.890 --> 53:21.330]  Yeah, we're talking about the room.
[53:23.290 --> 53:26.730]  I was saying that, you know, a lot of the plants
[53:26.730 --> 53:29.970]  that I'm running outside are been completely different
[53:29.970 --> 53:32.250]  hombres compared to the inside stuff, you know,
[53:32.250 --> 53:35.370]  and inside there, it's like a hit or miss, you know,
[53:35.370 --> 53:38.410]  situation with some of the foxtail
[53:39.410 --> 53:43.250]  and the funkiness and the strange growth here and there
[53:43.250 --> 53:45.930]  or not the lack of vigor, but outside,
[53:45.930 --> 53:47.210]  some of those things have been good.
[53:47.210 --> 53:51.450]  So, and then all the other places where I've seen
[53:51.450 --> 53:54.730]  a lot of those going, been outdoor as of late.
[53:54.730 --> 53:58.850]  And, you know, the cool guy that jumped on,
[53:58.850 --> 54:00.650]  I think it was last week or the week before
[54:00.650 --> 54:02.370]  we had the PAM15s outside,
[54:02.370 --> 54:05.730]  he was doing very good with them outside.
[54:05.730 --> 54:09.410]  So I think, yeah, I think outdoor
[54:09.410 --> 54:13.490]  is definitely a good route to go with these.
[54:13.490 --> 54:16.290]  And that's the parentage too of those candahars,
[54:16.290 --> 54:18.690]  you know, cause those are, like I said, outside,
[54:18.690 --> 54:20.570]  those tolerate one of the coldest winters
[54:20.570 --> 54:25.130]  in Afghanistan history, stand outside, you know,
[54:25.130 --> 54:28.330]  generational breeding in a single place for, you know,
[54:28.330 --> 54:31.130]  however long, you know, so those are,
[54:31.130 --> 54:33.410]  those have been bred for outside on that side.
[54:34.410 --> 54:38.410]  PAM is, can bounce both ways, but very easy,
[54:40.450 --> 54:42.770]  but you know, that side for sure.
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.760]  I got some of the black candahar too as well,
[54:53.080 --> 54:57.880]  just to kind of see, you know, where the candahar side,
[54:57.880 --> 55:01.120]  what expressions that are showing and pulling through,
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.760]  you know, I've never seen either one of those plants before,
[55:05.760 --> 55:08.680]  but you can definitely tell which one the PAM is,
[55:08.680 --> 55:12.960]  Sativa, you know, the Indica,
[55:12.960 --> 55:15.840]  there's a few of them that show through on that.
[55:15.840 --> 55:18.840]  I got some, I'm not sure how to say it,
[55:18.840 --> 55:23.840]  it's a blue Oaxacan or whatever times black candahar.
[55:26.600 --> 55:27.720]  It's a swampy seed.
[55:27.720 --> 55:31.200]  Oaxacan, with the O, it's Oaxacan, right?
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.040]  Oaxacan.
[55:32.040 --> 55:32.880]  Oaxacan.
[55:32.880 --> 55:35.680]  Yeah, I know that it comes from Mexico
[55:36.600 --> 55:39.440]  and it's like, they grow some bad-ass rooms,
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.120]  Oaxacans or whatever.
[55:41.120 --> 55:42.280]  Like there's a-
[55:42.280 --> 55:43.320]  Did you grow it yet?
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.440]  No, no, I just traded for some, I traded some seed
[55:51.400 --> 55:52.240]  and I just got them in the mail.
[55:52.240 --> 55:53.560]  The leaves are a little bit funny,
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.280]  the plant's like funny looking.
[55:57.840 --> 56:00.680]  The one I saw almost, yeah, it looked weird,
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.680]  almost frilly, almost like a, almost like a,
[56:03.680 --> 56:05.720]  not a freak show, but kind of like a freak show,
[56:05.720 --> 56:08.480]  not normal leaves, but that could have been
[56:08.480 --> 56:11.280]  just the one I saw, it was just strange looking.
[56:11.280 --> 56:14.280]  Yeah, the Oaxacan is like empty and it's really like-
[56:14.280 --> 56:17.840]  I've been seeing a lot of people kind of put this,
[56:19.480 --> 56:22.720]  they've been selling seeds like of two phenos,
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.480]  you know, like one, a regular pheno
[56:25.480 --> 56:27.400]  and one of some mutated pheno.
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.840]  And I mean, that's just kind of throwing bad lineage
[56:30.840 --> 56:32.800]  out there, you know.
[56:32.800 --> 56:34.760]  There's a bunch of that shit going on
[56:34.760 --> 56:37.200]  and it's just like, dude, that's why I was so,
[56:37.200 --> 56:40.480]  I mean, I was, I really enjoy running this
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.800]  because they're both land race varieties
[56:42.800 --> 56:45.960]  and you know, they really haven't been tampered with.
[56:45.960 --> 56:48.600]  There's so many genetics out there
[56:48.600 --> 56:51.200]  that's just been so tampered with.
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.360]  And I mean, I've talked to, I've had a discussion
[56:55.360 --> 56:58.480]  with quite a few breeders here recently, you know,
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.840]  and not to mention any names,
[57:00.840 --> 57:03.960]  but like most of them had told me
[57:03.960 --> 57:07.680]  they got their first phenomenal pheno
[57:07.680 --> 57:09.360]  in this and that from fem seeds.
[57:09.360 --> 57:10.200]  By accident.
[57:10.200 --> 57:13.400]  And I'm like, no, no, yeah.
[57:13.400 --> 57:17.240]  Or they just had a bunch of fem seeds, you know,
[57:17.240 --> 57:19.600]  and ran a big pheno run of fem seeds
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.920]  and that's great and all, but I really,
[57:21.920 --> 57:25.200]  in theory, believe that that's all you could do
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.600]  is keep a pheno.
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.280]  I mean, you wouldn't want to breed with that
[57:28.280 --> 57:30.880]  because if you breed with it, it's mutated.
[57:30.880 --> 57:35.880]  I mean, feminization really isn't, you know, natural.
[57:36.680 --> 57:40.080]  I mean, at least with colloidal silver, you know,
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.600]  there's the old school Soma style, you know,
[57:44.600 --> 57:47.120]  where they do rotalization and stuff
[57:47.120 --> 57:48.840]  and they do those in fields of affie,
[57:48.840 --> 57:52.240]  but when you're, you know,
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.720]  there's a lot of reverses and stuff with feminized seed
[57:56.720 --> 57:57.560]  and that's another mutation.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.600]  So I mean, you know, you have to.
[58:02.480 --> 58:03.800]  Do what?
[58:03.800 --> 58:06.080]  It's, you're saying that it's missing information
[58:06.080 --> 58:07.400]  by being feminized.
[58:08.880 --> 58:09.720]  Genetic information.
[58:09.720 --> 58:14.320]  I'm saying that it's changing the genetic chromosomes
[58:14.320 --> 58:17.080]  of the plant itself and it's, you know,
[58:17.080 --> 58:19.960]  even if it's not in that plant and every offspring,
[58:19.960 --> 58:23.840]  it's throughout there and it's just a mess.
[58:23.840 --> 58:26.360]  I mean, you could obviously know what you're doing
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.240]  and probably work that out,
[58:28.240 --> 58:32.960]  but you already lost half the vigor.
[58:32.960 --> 58:34.040]  You know, it's a fem.
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.960]  So what he's saying is correct.
[58:36.960 --> 58:38.560]  I don't really agree with it.
[58:38.560 --> 58:41.600]  Like I was saying, a lot of the breeders I've talked to,
[58:41.600 --> 58:43.840]  their first, where they started
[58:43.840 --> 58:46.280]  and how they started making seed,
[58:46.280 --> 58:48.360]  their first keeper was a fem seed
[58:48.360 --> 58:50.080]  and then they worked that line
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.560]  and made a whole bunch of seeds
[58:51.560 --> 58:53.800]  from this phenomenal fem keeper.
[58:53.800 --> 58:57.200]  But I mean, then you get down the line of,
[58:57.200 --> 58:58.920]  I mean, even your first cross
[58:58.920 --> 59:02.400]  and it would just be half of what it could have been
[59:03.480 --> 59:05.800]  from the start, you know?
[59:07.400 --> 59:10.400]  It just doesn't make sense in theory.
[59:10.400 --> 59:11.320]  Yeah.
[59:11.320 --> 59:12.320]  What's up, Coastal?
[59:13.320 --> 59:16.600]  So like, I agree completely with what Nick's saying.
[59:17.440 --> 59:20.640]  There is a huge genetic disparity that occurs
[59:20.640 --> 59:23.000]  when you're like dealing with feminized
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.440]  versus regular seeds.
[59:25.560 --> 59:29.360]  The male plant has a lot of genetics
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.360]  that it contributes to the offspring.
[59:34.920 --> 59:36.680]  And when you do a feminized seed,
[59:36.680 --> 59:38.080]  yes, you get two Xs
[59:38.080 --> 59:40.880]  and then you freaking make the plant work.
[59:40.880 --> 59:43.240]  But it doesn't really matter in the end
[59:43.240 --> 59:47.120]  when you're starting to like dull down the fucking genetics.
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.640]  I grew out stuff from greenhouse, for example,
[59:51.640 --> 59:56.640]  from the early 2000s and like regular versions of stuff.
[59:56.640 --> 59:59.080]  And then I started growing the same plants
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.560]  from now from their feminized stuff.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.000]  And it was completely diluted.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.160]  And it's really true.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.320]  And I had already heard that
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.280]  from other people who are geneticists
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.840]  and I have a genetics background
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.240]  and it's like, that's really, really true.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.040]  You have to have that male in there.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.800]  You can't just breed just using the female.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.800]  If you wanna make a one-off, you know, S1, that's cool.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.360]  I mean, that's really cool.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.520]  Make whatever you wanna do because that's fine.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.720]  Is your contention that if you're running feminized stock
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.560]  that eventually you're gonna run into a problem
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.440]  because you're just gonna bottleneck to the point
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.920]  where it's gonna be a mutant?
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.760]  Exactly.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.280]  Until you add the male to, and what the hell do I know?
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.680]  But in other words, is that what you're trying to say?
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.880]  Until there's a male involved, you don't have any,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.320]  Mr. Tree's chime in, please.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.920]  So feminizing is the best way to get to your end goal
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.240]  of a fire plant that you're looking for.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.120]  If you're trying to, when you use a male,
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.080]  if you do a cross, for example, right?
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.920]  If you're using, if I have ice cream cake
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.880]  and I use Kandahar, right?
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.080]  And I use the males into the ice cream cake.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.080]  But I really like the ice cream cake, you know,
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.800]  for the most part, you know, or whatever.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.800]  And that's what I'm trying to look for.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.640]  Or I'm gonna breed for a plant
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.240]  that looks like the ice cream cake
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.220]  and maybe add some stuff to it, you know?
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.520]  When you add that other genetic material from the male,
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.760]  you just made your job way harder
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.720]  to find the plant you've been looking for.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.760]  Yeah, you just, you did.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.560]  You polluted the gene pool.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.320]  So by adding the extra, you made it take longer
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.800]  to get to your end goal, which is finding a singular plant.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.160]  Not breeding something down to a certain point continually
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.480]  until the day you die.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480]  Just looking for a single plant
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.920]  that is gonna change the world
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.120]  or that's gonna fix your ailment or what have you.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.640]  Or that has the exact profile that you're looking for.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.640]  So from like a gene standpoint, I'm not a geneticist,
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.080]  but like, yeah, you know, technically I would say
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.560]  that the male does have more genetic material to send over.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.160]  It's cool to use males and to do things in the proper way.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.600]  But these plants also have the ability to be intersex
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.400]  and to save the gene pool in themselves
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.380]  and kind of respond to the environmental stresses
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.340]  that are put upon them.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.880]  So they're not, you know, I mean,
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.000]  it's built into the code to be able to do this, you know,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.140]  and they can do it really well.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:57.140]  So, I mean, if you're trying to have a line
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.600]  that is like your namesake,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.580]  that you're gonna work every season
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.280]  and plant the seeds from that
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.460]  and be like a traditional corn farmer, right?
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.040]  You plant your crop every season and you save your seeds,
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.360]  you plant your crop the next season and you do that one,
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.360]  then a traditional breeding program is probably up your aisle
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.280]  and doing males and females and doing a filial breeding,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.520]  you know, or something like that.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.440]  If you're trying to like find, like I said, a single plant
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.360]  and you just want the profile from this plant,
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.440]  like the SFV clone, if you grow SFV seeds,
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.560]  you're not gonna get the exact profile more or less
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.200]  that that one clone has.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.200]  It's really hard to like hit that fucking lottery, right?
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.600]  So if I use something else than that
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.920]  and I'm trying to look for that,
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.600]  it takes me longer if never, and you'll never get that.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.600]  But if I take that exact profile and I put it on itself
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.440]  or I put it on something else that I really enjoy,
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.840]  then I know that those two females I fucking love, right?
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.400]  And the offspring of, and Mendel, you know,
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.120]  as if you read the pea story on breeding and stuff,
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.720]  you know, life begets life.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.520]  And yeah, you might lose some things,
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.240]  you might gain some things, but it's up to you at that point
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.640]  to find the right plant that fits for you, right?
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.720]  As far as vigor and, you know, whatnot,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.480]  I've grown lots of S1s, I've grown lots of S2s,
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.400]  I've grown, you know, I don't even wanna say the numbers
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.840]  on how many feminized seeds I've grown,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.640]  crosses and other things like that.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.160]  And honestly, you grow them next to other plants.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:50.520]  You know, I've enjoyed the result of the feminized seeds
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.680]  much more in some of those crosses than I have, you know,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.560]  the traditional breedings over the time.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.360]  And that's just like, just there's, I don't know,
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:04.160]  it's just something, it's not better or worse,
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.840]  it's just a different tool for the toolbox, right?
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.680]  And some people can't plant.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.240]  You got deep into it and it didn't cause any major issues
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.920]  is what you're saying.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.360]  Well, I mean, you know, so the Kandahar, right?
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.640]  The Kandahar stuff that you're growing right now, right?
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.480]  That's, those are multiple males, multiple, not just one,
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.400]  not to keep from bottlenecking, you know,
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.640]  the gene pool a little bit more
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.480]  and multiple different males with different properties
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.920]  to add to something that is really good, right?
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.600]  And you still got some mutants and some funky things
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.440]  that, you know, aren't really favorable and kind of,
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  you know, so, I mean, that comes with the territory
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.360]  on any side of the coin, you know?
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.560]  And yeah, when you inbreed-
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.160]  Is there's no guarantee though, if you said like,
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.320]  oh geez, you know, if you went to S7 and then thereafter,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.200]  it's gonna be just a mess from thereafter.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.000]  There's no like rule that says that,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.800]  it just depends on the genetics
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.080]  that are going into the whole pie, so to speak.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.040]  Yeah, yeah, there's no, it's not,
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.800]  you can't say a broad statement as of that, yeah.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.360]  There's, if you take different roads, you know,
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.800]  they lead, you know, certain places, you know what I mean?
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.320]  So that's the way that I see that, you know?
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.560]  And you know, back in the day, you know,
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.800]  there were like Greenhouse for the example of,
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.320]  because you were using Greenhouse,
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.560]  like they had a certain genetic library, right?
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.720]  Over time.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.680]  If I could jump in for just two seconds, Mr. Atreus.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.440]  Am I getting you in the middle of thought?
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.280]  Do I want, do you want-
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.120]  No, no, you're good.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.040]  Yeah, go ahead, jump in.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.760]  Just cause we do, I did get,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.400]  I did order us in a special guest for today.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.240]  Oh, sweet.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.440]  Order us in, that sounds terrible.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.120]  But I did get Shay, Shay LeBlanc from Rosewood Farms,
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.720]  that the guy that's running the Unicorn Cup to come in
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.640]  and jump in and say hello.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.280]  So here's Shay, he's an old world grower.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.440]  And you guys will get along real well.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.920]  I'm absolutely positive that.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.080]  Let me remove this one,
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.720]  so I've got too many things on the screen.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.560]  Yeah, and are we,
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.440]  you're gonna bring out another nug here eventually
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.960]  for us to look at or?
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.680]  Yeah, I am.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.800]  Let's pull out another one.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.200]  But Shay, do you want to say hello and introduce yourself?
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:10.960]  What's up, Shay?
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.800]  How y'all doing?
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.640]  Hey, Shay.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.880]  What's happening, guys?
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.560]  Hope you're having a good night.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.840]  Yeah, it's actually Shay, but Shay works too.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.160]  Shay, that's cool.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.480]  I was just catching some of your genetic talk there
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.400]  with the S1s.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.480]  I just kind of hopped into that point.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.720]  Yeah, I have had like similar observations with S1s
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.720]  being just less stable, like hard to keep that vigor,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.480]  especially when you keep S'ing them further and further
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.080]  down that line.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.280]  But that's just my own observations.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.420]  So once it gets to that point,
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.620]  add in the mail, does that help things out?
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.860]  Like, can you fix it, I guess is the thing.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.780]  Yeah, I think probably, yeah.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.580]  You know, I haven't done all that much S1 stuff,
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.100]  just like five or 10 different projects
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.820]  beyond like an S1 or S2, and they went south on me,
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.540]  so a pretty limited experience.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.380]  Mine went south on me.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.780]  Mine went south, very south.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:20.180]  They were straight hermaphroditic plants, like it is fucked.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.220]  But I got another one for you guys.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.940]  So we were doing some judging here.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.420]  Coastal OG, do you want to jump in for a second?
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.500]  And I'll pull this out and give everybody a second
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.180]  to have a good look, a good thought.
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.980]  And then after maybe you're done Coastal,
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.900]  maybe Shay could talk a little bit about
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.660]  how we would judge the appearance on this,
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.940]  and then we'll roll through everybody on the panel.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.100]  And right now what we're doing
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.220]  is our evaluation on appearance.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.500]  For what we think it is.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.500]  So if you're in the chat too,
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.140]  and you'd like to drop your opinion as well, go ahead.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.140]  So go ahead, Coastal OG.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:55.940]  So I've been breeding feminized seeds for 16 years now.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:59.020]  And basically what I've found is
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.260]  there isn't a disparity like directly with them.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:05.540]  It's when you start to try to keep inbreeding them,
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.820]  and you start to like do that over and over again.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.740]  Initially, it's not that really bad.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.780]  I even S1 Shanty Baba's seed stock
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.860]  from his original Super Silver Haze.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.740]  And I got some awesome stuff out of it.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:27.020]  Like I got like the Dr. Grinspoon like Pheno,
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.420]  and I got like a lot of like Skunk Phenos,
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.940]  and then NL Phenos,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.980]  and then just normal Super Silver Haze Phenos.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.620]  But yeah, you can't like just shit on it.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.820]  I mean, I'm not trying to shit on like,
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.060]  on, you know, feminized seeds.
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.900]  I just think you gotta be very careful
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.420]  about when you're breeding with it.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.180]  You gotta know where the genetic disparity is
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.500]  with what parent and how it breeds.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.100]  And so you have to test.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.700]  And that's the whole point of doing what we do.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.820]  It's to suss out where is the weakness in either parent?
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.740]  You know?
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.100]  So Shay, do you wanna tell me a little bit
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:23.100]  about like your formology on how you go through the process
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.260]  of judging cannabis visually
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.180]  for the first part of your assessment program
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.100]  for the Unicorn Cup?
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.260]  And if you can, with the best of your abilities,
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.380]  we all understand it is by a camera,
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.380]  and it's not like a true representation or understanding,
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.940]  but we give everybody the best opportunity possible
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.820]  to say their opinion on it.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.500]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.260]  Like a bag of peel is a little bit subjective, right?
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.260]  Because to be honest with you,
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.020]  what I think is beautiful bag of peel
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.340]  may not be what the next guy thinks.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.620]  But I think generally speaking,
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.660]  there's some things that we all kind of have in common,
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.660]  like brown, dark brown looking, old, leafy,
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.060]  could actually be really killer, right?
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.420]  It might be a land race or something,
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.300]  but by today's standards,
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.260]  and I guess what we're really looking at is like,
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.100]  what's selling?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.100]  Because I'm coming at this from a business,
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.060]  trying to be profitable.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.740]  And so I kind of actually try and put away
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.300]  my own personal beliefs and look at it
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.140]  from the point of view of the consumer,
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.340]  the average consumer.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.860]  So that kind of leans towards
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.820]  what we call maybe Instagram weed.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620]  So yeah, this one doesn't look too old.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.260]  I mean, it doesn't have these popular Instagram purple
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.460]  with the white hues like we're seeing these days
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.260]  on so many different genetics.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.380]  It looks like it's got a decent amount
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.780]  of trichomes on it though.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.860]  It's like a pretty dense bud,
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.140]  which is a good again,
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.380]  based on the same lens that I mentioned.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.020]  Like that's got some shine to it
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.220]  there right there in the light, eh?
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.740]  Like that's got a good,
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.300]  I'll give it a little bit of a, ooh.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.140]  Okay, check this out.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.020]  Ready, ready?
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:06.860]  Are you guys?
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.700]  Is it sponge?
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.620]  Does it got some give?
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.500]  Yeah.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.380]  It's a little bit sticky, I think.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.980]  It doesn't seem to want to come off of that at all.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.340]  Sweet, that's a good sign.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.500]  Yeah, that's a good sign, eh?
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.700]  And then give it a little,
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.380]  I'll give it a good C and see how it's bounce is.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.060]  Oh, it's a little bit crunchy.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.300]  See if it's got some.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.300]  Dry maybe, eh?
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.540]  Yeah, it's coming back.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.740]  It's got a little bit of grow rebound there.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.900]  Then the trim job looks good too, right?
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.580]  Like it doesn't look like it was machine trimmed
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.740]  because you can see where it would,
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.020]  it would whack off the little nubs.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.220]  Anything that's sticking out would just get shaved off
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.180]  and it looked like someone took a razor blade to it,
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.060]  but I don't see that.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.260]  It looks like it was hand trimmed nicely.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.460]  It's got some like concave,
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.660]  concave and convex things happening, right?
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.380]  So, and they did a good job with the trim.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.420]  It's well trimmed.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.820]  That's nice in there.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:04.740]  It's a little bit brown.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.740]  That might just be the light though, eh?
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.500]  Little bit, little bit the light aesthetic.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.940]  It's the coloring of the light.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.780]  It's a little bit.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.620]  Okay.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.760]  But you know, you know,
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.000]  there is a little bit of a deeper kind of,
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.280]  it almost looks like there's some purple hues
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.520]  trying to come through.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.400]  Nice.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.200]  Like there's some coloring trying to come through
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.320]  a little bit on the very inline points of the butt.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.800]  I don't know if you can see it there,
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.000]  but I can point to it right, right here.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.480]  And like right there, there's like a purple stripping there.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.320]  So what would you give this out of the 10
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.160]  for appearance there, Shay?
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.040]  Jay?
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.920]  I'm gonna go with seven, seven and a half, seven.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880]  Seven and a half, seven, okay.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.240]  Yeah.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.600]  What's everyone else think?
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.680]  I wanna hear, we got a lot of experts on this call.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.360]  I wanna hear what the others think too, if that's cool.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.560]  What's up next, Mr. Treece?
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.400]  Yeah, we'll go through it.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.440]  We'll go through everybody and get a team opinion on it.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  So yeah, I do agree with a lot of what Shay was saying.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.280]  That sticky test is really important to me.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.360]  Not being able to smell it,
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.560]  I'm gonna say that every time,
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.360]  but that's a real big indicator for me.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.920]  That stick is really nice though.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.520]  Right in there, it has some good swollen calyxes
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.360]  sitting in there.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.720]  If that's good coloring in there,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.440]  I can't tell with the lighting if it's good coloring
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.440]  or if it's no rotting in the skin.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  If that's purple-ing and hues of good color,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.680]  then that's good, but it's hard to see it on my end.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.800]  I wish I could like zoom that up.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.800]  Oh, I actually can, look at that, shit.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.040]  Yeah, you can full screen it on your side.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.920]  Yeah, I can on my side, I can zoom it up.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.640]  I just brought it up fatter for me.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.080]  It's actually pretty awesome.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.160]  I'm gonna use this in the future.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.720]  Yeah, I'm going with the seven and a half
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.120]  purely on that stick.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.880]  And looking at it, it's got decent coverage on there.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.000]  It looks really nice.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:09.840]  The heads on the end-
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.720]  It's got a very long stock, visibly.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.720]  Yeah, but it's got heads on the end.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.480]  It's got heads on the end of them.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.360]  I've got them zoomed up.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.600]  You've got some heads on the end of there, which is nice.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.280]  It wasn't machine trimmed.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.200]  It was grown with care.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.120]  Yeah, I'd put that up to seven and a half.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.720]  Maybe an eight if I could smell it.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.560]  But yeah, if it's coming off on the finger like that,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.720]  a couple of heads and the stick, I'm going seven and a half.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.200]  Seven and a half, maybe a 7.8.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.440]  Yeah, it's pushing up, it's good.
[01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.950]  I like that.
[01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:56.950]  Average consensus I think we hit there was a seven, no?
[01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:59.030]  Or 7.5, where we at?
[01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.870]  For the appearance?
[01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.510]  Yeah, I like the 7.5.
[01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:03.110]  It feels a little bit better.
[01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:07.470]  We got some dank 10s and 12s in the crowd there.
[01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:09.870]  Maybe somebody recognizes their cannabis
[01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.750]  and they're like, that's mine.
[01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.710]  Give me a hundred thousand points.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.390]  Well, I hope not.
[01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.310]  We try to not let that happen.
[01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.470]  We really want this to be double blind.
[01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.990]  Oh yeah, it's, you can tell.
[01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:25.750]  I do think it was a machine trim,
[01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:30.590]  just because I do see a little bit of fold over
[01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:31.990]  and a little bit of that rolliness
[01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:35.630]  that I usually see happen, but maybe I'm wrong.
[01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:36.670]  I'm not too sure.
[01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:38.870]  You don't have a jeweler's loop, do you?
[01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:39.710]  Do you there, London?
[01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:42.310]  I don't have anything that goes quite finer than that
[01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:43.630]  that I've been able to find
[01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:45.630]  at this exact point in time, unfortunately.
[01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:48.270]  I usually have a little bit higher end of a scope,
[01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.870]  but it's just, it's,
[01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:52.630]  I have two children and my life's a fucking mess.
[01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:58.590]  It's really obvious if it's machine trimmed,
[01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:01.350]  it will look, you can tell on the outside of it,
[01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:03.230]  I can't see on the video,
[01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:05.630]  but you can tell if it's machine trimmed
[01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:07.950]  when it's really tightly trimmed
[01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:10.510]  and then you get this,
[01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:13.950]  the trichomes on the outside are non-existent.
[01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.830]  There aren't any actual folds.
[01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:17.470]  So aroma's low.
[01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:19.070]  We got a low aroma score.
[01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:22.230]  We got a three on the aroma score here.
[01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.110]  I did not, I just put it through the grinder,
[01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:26.070]  didn't give any kick after,
[01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.870]  when you open it up and have a smell,
[01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:29.790]  not a lot of kick at all.
[01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:30.630]  Put it away.
[01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:32.630]  Is this a,
[01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.070]  is this LP micro or is this a personal category?
[01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:39.270]  I think it's LP micro.
[01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:43.470]  No, it's PPF7.
[01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:45.030]  And by the way, everybody,
[01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.950]  and by the way, everybody for the first,
[01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:49.910]  okay, so the last one was a killer smoke
[01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:52.430]  and it got a really high score on the smokeability.
[01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:55.910]  The aroma wasn't, was medium.
[01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:58.350]  The flavor was actually really high.
[01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:00.670]  And it was, the first one that I had,
[01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:04.830]  you know, Blue Sky, you know, Blue Sky Organics, okay.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.830]  Like, are they pretty popular in the Kootenays?
[01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.030]  Are they like all over the place?
[01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.790]  Cause I find that every time I smoke weed
[01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:15.750]  that's grown in their stuff, it's, it's, it's tastes the same
[01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.750]  like it's always, it's got that almost Gaia green
[01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:21.110]  kind of flavor profile that comes out of it.
[01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.710]  That, you know what I mean?
[01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:24.070]  Yeah, totally.
[01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:25.910]  Yeah, they're, they're like a good first step
[01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.870]  in my opinion, right?
[01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:28.630]  Like a first step into living soils.
[01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:32.030]  Then after that, you probably move into soil tests
[01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:33.950]  and then making your own amendments.
[01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:37.310]  But depending how big you are, I mean,
[01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.350]  if it's just a closet, sometimes it's easier
[01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.310]  to just buy a pre-made thing.
[01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:46.710]  I'm excited for the, it did open up the bouquet on that,
[01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:48.750]  did open up a little bit after it was ground
[01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.350]  for a couple of seconds.
[01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:52.230]  I give it one last sniff and it did,
[01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:54.910]  did open up a little bit, got a little bit of floral.
[01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:59.890]  And then one of the things that, you know,
[01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:01.810]  gets considered is the size of the buds
[01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:04.210]  instead of just a bunch of little pea buds.
[01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.410]  I'm a little bit hesitant to talk too much on that one
[01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.850]  because in the sampling, sometimes it's just,
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:09.690]  you don't have a choice,
[01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:12.690]  but to put a medium bud and a small bud.
[01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:16.170]  And so not everyone gets the just perfect one gram
[01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.530]  or gram and a half bud.
[01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:20.930]  So that's, that can be a little bit like unfair,
[01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:24.410]  I guess, although we really try and be cautious of that
[01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.090]  and make it the best we can.
[01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.850]  That's a really good secret, secret knowledge point
[01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.810]  for people that enter competitions.
[01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:33.650]  Like make sure that you have divisible enough,
[01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:36.970]  nice nuggets that are all the same size and consistent.
[01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:38.250]  Like just pick through,
[01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.210]  maybe that's how you win this stuff, right?
[01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:42.210]  Like you don't, you don't, you don't do it by,
[01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:45.770]  by just grabbing your jar and throwing it in a bag.
[01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:47.930]  Yeah, that's a, that's a really big tip, actually.
[01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:49.170]  The stuff that came to us,
[01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.130]  like already gram and a half perfectly.
[01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:53.930]  And we just gently put it into the different things.
[01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.770]  That was the ultimate for us too, it was so much easier.
[01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:00.010]  And then trimming, like again,
[01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:03.090]  I actually like to leave my buds a little bit untrimmed,
[01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.690]  right, because they just protect my trikes
[01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:06.050]  and I'll trim it off as I roll it
[01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.330]  because it's my personal smoke,
[01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:10.810]  but on the market and Instagram that doesn't fly.
[01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:13.410]  So again, that's the lens we're looking at this from.
[01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.610]  So people that do a really good trim job,
[01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.730]  but there's, it's not super simple
[01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:19.850]  just doing a good trim job.
[01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:22.530]  It's not just taking all the leaves off.
[01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:24.490]  If you like get in there like a doctor
[01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.490]  with precision points and just clip the little stock
[01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.770]  so the leaf falls off instead of shaving it,
[01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:31.610]  because when you're shaving it,
[01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:34.330]  you're basically replicating a machine trimmer.
[01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.610]  And like someone just mentioned there,
[01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:39.690]  like you basically pull all the trikes off or many of them.
[01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.530]  And then that's really obvious under a scope.
[01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:44.130]  So I like to look, even a jeweler's loop,
[01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.890]  you can see it's just been shaved hard like that.
[01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.890]  Something else that's good to look at is contaminants,
[01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:51.210]  right, like I don't want to see a bunch of dog hair
[01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:52.050]  and shit in there.
[01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.610]  Like that stuff will get called,
[01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:55.450]  won't end up in the competition
[01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.370]  if there's a bunch of contaminants.
[01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.450]  It's like having hairy food.
[01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:08.170]  I really, I agree completely.
[01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:14.650]  Like I don't believe in, like, I don't believe in doing this
[01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:18.450]  like where you do this thing where you trim the plant
[01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:21.450]  right after you harvest it,
[01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:26.450]  because there's a methodology to it, first of all.
[01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:30.050]  You want to slow down the death process
[01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:33.290]  while expediting the drying process.
[01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:35.970]  And it sounds like it goes against itself,
[01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.650]  but it actually doesn't.
[01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.730]  What it really is, is you're trying to dry out
[01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:45.290]  the inside of the stem faster than the buds dry out.
[01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:49.890]  And so if you dry them out by cutting them off,
[01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:52.250]  the buds off, cutting off all the leaves,
[01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.930]  the buds will dry really fast,
[01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:57.370]  but then the stems inside will stay really wet.
[01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:00.010]  If you, and then they won't swell
[01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:03.250]  as far as the trichomes go.
[01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.770]  If you leave them, what will happen is
[01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:08.090]  they will think they're still alive
[01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:12.530]  and they'll keep on trying to push out more resin
[01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:13.370]  through the trichome.
[01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:16.610]  So it's almost like you've had another couple of weeks
[01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:21.610]  of drying actually being flowering time.
[01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:25.730]  And so they actually swell out those triches
[01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:27.210]  really, really hard.
[01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:31.490]  And the other thing is it'll pull out a lot of that water
[01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:35.850]  from the stems really, really quickly
[01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:39.890]  with those really large leaves.
[01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:42.290]  And so that's why I don't believe in removing
[01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.970]  any of the leaves at all,
[01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:47.370]  until you get it at like five days or so.
[01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.710]  And then once you hit that five day point,
[01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:52.450]  and then you start to see the buds are a little dry,
[01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:55.530]  then you can pull them, you leave the sugar leaves on,
[01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:58.810]  and then you can like bag them or whatever you wanna do,
[01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:00.370]  and then go from there.
[01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:03.290]  But it allows them to kind of like,
[01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:08.210]  you can go five to basically 14 days,
[01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:11.130]  and it'll really, really make a huge difference
[01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:15.090]  if you just hang it like full plant.
[01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:18.530]  And I really do think it's about slowing down
[01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:22.330]  the death process while still like feeding up,
[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.850]  drying out stems.
[01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:26.690]  And so then you don't end up with that like shitty,
[01:23:26.690 --> 01:23:28.970]  like a lot of people just like,
[01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.890]  they just try to cut the damn plants down
[01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:34.490]  and they end up with this like soft bud
[01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:37.290]  when they're like trying to dry it out on racks.
[01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:38.130]  And it-
[01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:38.970]  Yeah.
[01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.090]  They end up with hay.
[01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:41.690]  Tastes like wood, smells like hay.
[01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:42.530]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:45.130]  Smells like what's in the bag at the end of the day
[01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.850]  when you mow your lawn.
[01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:47.690]  Yeah.
[01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:51.810]  A cool little tip is like dry with your roots on,
[01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:53.090]  take it to the next step.
[01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:55.250]  And then I'm gonna let the cat out of the bag,
[01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:57.130]  but if you wanted to win a cup,
[01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.290]  I'm telling you this makes a difference.
[01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:01.570]  Take your favorite plant and leave the roots,
[01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.570]  just let it die with the roots in the medium.
[01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:06.690]  So take the piece of rock wool out of the bed,
[01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:09.130]  take the living soil pot,
[01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:12.010]  and let it dry up and start to wilt,
[01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:14.250]  preferably while it's been dark for a few days,
[01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.290]  and then dry it just like that.
[01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:19.330]  And like, don't go back to it until you're ready to,
[01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:22.010]  you know, you can maybe burp it if you want,
[01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:25.090]  but best thing I've ever smoked in my own personal opinion
[01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.090]  is just, it took like a month
[01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:28.530]  and it was finally ready to smoke
[01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.370]  and it was mind blowing good.
[01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:33.850]  I love my winter weed cause it takes forever
[01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:35.730]  and it's mid summer right now.
[01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:37.890]  And I like, I plugged in all of like some of the,
[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:40.210]  one of the best phenos I found last year,
[01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:41.570]  one of the best plants I found last year,
[01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:43.850]  I like plugged it in, I'm like, this is gonna be great.
[01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:45.130]  I know I'm not gonna be able to submit it
[01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:47.130]  to the Unicorn Cup, but you know,
[01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:48.170]  I'm gonna be able to bring it
[01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.570]  and give it to all these people to smoke.
[01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:50.970]  I got a whole bunch of it.
[01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:54.410]  And I'm like, fuck, it's 32 degrees for a fucking week.
[01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:58.570]  It is like, how do you keep your temperatures down
[01:24:58.570 --> 01:24:59.530]  and terpenes down?
[01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:01.330]  Like when you don't have several air conditioners
[01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.930]  and electrical panel with a large enough size
[01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:03.770]  and you're just doing it at home.
[01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:07.210]  So it's like, I'm hoping that it turns around here
[01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:09.770]  it usually took about a month for it to finish off.
[01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:13.130]  Like it needs that development and it turns like,
[01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:14.690]  it's like that one day, all of a sudden
[01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:16.230]  the flavor profile goes boom.
[01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:21.170]  But maybe let's start with Corey here on this one.
[01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:25.530]  We have our next flower up for the judging.
[01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:26.730]  I've got one question.
[01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:29.770]  Is it, does it feel overly dry?
[01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:32.490]  Cause it looks dry, like dry.
[01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:35.650]  No, it's actually not super dry.
[01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:36.530]  Okay, then it looks.
[01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:38.410]  Look at the balance, look at the balance.
[01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:39.610]  Then I love it.
[01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:42.050]  That's probably the nicest one I've seen so far.
[01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:45.010]  Yeah, no, that's nice.
[01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:47.210]  I don't know from what I can see, I like the color.
[01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.170]  I like the, I like the everything about it.
[01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:51.190]  I like the form.
[01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:54.450]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:59.010]  I zoomed in and got kicked out
[01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:00.930]  cause I hit the wrong button after I zoomed in.
[01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:03.570]  But when I zoomed in, I was like, yeah, that's really,
[01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:07.330]  that's one of the nicer ones that I seen on the zoom in.
[01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:10.570]  So I'm glad Corey asked if it was really dry
[01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:12.330]  and it gave that.
[01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:14.210]  Yeah, I give that, I'll give that an eight.
[01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.290]  I'll give that a solid eight.
[01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:16.130]  I like that.
[01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:16.970]  Maybe that.
[01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:18.410]  Yeah, dude, look at the trikes fall off too.
[01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.050]  Like this just stand now on there too.
[01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:20.890]  I like that one.
[01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:21.730]  Right?
[01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:22.770]  Yeah, that's really nice.
[01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:23.610]  It looks nice.
[01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:24.450]  Eight and a half.
[01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:25.290]  Eight and a half?
[01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:27.490]  Yeah, eight and a half.
[01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:28.850]  I'm a little turned on by this one.
[01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:29.970]  I'm going to go eight and a half.
[01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:30.930]  What do you think?
[01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:32.370]  What do you think, Jay?
[01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.330]  Yeah, I'm eight and a half, eight and three quarter.
[01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:36.730]  I mean, it's hard to say nine, but solid.
[01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:37.570]  Yeah, I know.
[01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:38.410]  For sure.
[01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:39.230]  I feel like you gotta like,
[01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.290]  you gotta go, what the fuck is that
[01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:42.850]  for it to be like a nine?
[01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:43.690]  And then you gotta go,
[01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:45.570]  that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
[01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:46.410]  in the world for it to be a ten.
[01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.730]  Yeah, I've never seen anything like that before.
[01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:50.610]  That's the only way it's getting a ten.
[01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:51.450]  Yes, like I've been.
[01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:52.290]  Exactly.
[01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.130]  I'm like, it's something new.
[01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:55.570]  Everybody's gotta go, wow.
[01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:57.290]  All right, so texture looks nice.
[01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:58.210]  Aroma looks good.
[01:26:58.210 --> 01:26:59.810]  We're going 8.58.
[01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.970]  We're seeing a lot of tens and a lot of tens
[01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:06.410]  and tens and tens and 8.5s, yeah.
[01:27:06.410 --> 01:27:09.090]  So I'm going to give it an 8.5 on the point mark.
[01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.830]  That's nice.
[01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:15.150]  It makes me want to smoke it.
[01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:16.990]  What's it smell like?
[01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.450]  Is that OG smelling?
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.360]  I should just go, I should go get a,
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.240]  should go get my kit.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.160]  I have the number.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.720]  Yeah, you can do it with me
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.920]  and let me know what you think.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.520]  Do that'd be helpful.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.640]  Into the rosin.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.000]  Oh yeah, we got to do that one throughout the week.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.360]  That was going to be harder for me to.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.720]  Why didn't we all get a kit?
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.920]  Because you're in the States, it's illegal.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.760]  Sorry guys.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.560]  Where's my kit?
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.500]  I don't know where in the States you are,
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.220]  but you could always just come on up.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.420]  I'm getting chocolate.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.320]  Chocolate, okay.
[01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.810]  Ooh, it's got like a really nice, really nice aroma.
[01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:07.450]  I'm trying to, I'm trying to put my finger
[01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:08.570]  on exactly what it is.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.040]  Okay, we're going to give it the grind up.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:24.780]  Make sure I have a clean grinder for just a second.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.900]  What's Mr. Tree's smoking on today?
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.380]  Because Mr. Tree's always smokes
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.660]  some of the most dank weed on the show.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.660]  I've got some, what do we got in here?
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.500]  What's this?
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.400]  This is the last of some Mac one.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  And then this jar over here is the Royal Kush.
[01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:02.670]  So I got Royal Kush and Mac one.
[01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.070]  I've been smoking Mac one right here for a while.
[01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:10.470]  The Pam 15s are coming along.
[01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:11.950]  I've got a bunch of stuff in seed.
[01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:15.830]  So I'm smoking Mac one right now, which is good.
[01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:16.670]  I like it.
[01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:19.790]  You know, one of the clones that I hold on to
[01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:23.930]  that I keep around just cause it's Mac one, you know?
[01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:27.790]  So I'm happy to have it.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.280]  What's the profile on the dog walker
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.280]  once you finish your rip there?
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.320]  Dude, dog walker is probably one of my favorite smells
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.480]  when you get the batch going right.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.200]  It's sharp, but it's like wet and musty smelling.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.120]  Like if you could smell wet.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.000]  It's like wet.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.840]  Like wet earth?
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.760]  You know, it's like, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.760]  Kind of like a wet dirt or like hanging out at a pool.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.200]  It's just wet.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.040]  I don't know.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:12.860]  It's a weird thing.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:13.700]  Like desert wet.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:14.680]  It's a wet smell.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.920]  It smells like wet mustiness.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.480]  And then it has this,
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.040]  it's got a strong garlicky sharpness to it.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.880]  That is like the really fucking,
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.600]  that really starts to scream
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.960]  with that chem dog chemical twist in there, you know?
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.940]  And you've got this like chem dog,
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.440]  wet, wet dog, like mustiness,
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:43.040]  bad BO, halitosis type smells, you know what I mean?
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.640]  Really like sharp and offensive.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.600]  It's one of my absolute favorite smells
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.440]  when you get it up there.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.660]  It demands a response.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:51.500]  I always say this.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.000]  Like there's a few plants where like,
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.120]  like you can rub your hands and smell them
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.360]  and rub, you know, touch the nugs and smell them
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.200]  and do that.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.320]  But there's certain plants where you do that
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.760]  and you're like, whoa,
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.800]  where you have this physical reaction
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.800]  to the weed itself.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.520]  Like it blows you back
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.960]  or it's something that really is like, holy shit.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.040]  It's a physical response.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.280]  It's got that, it's got that it factor,
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.120]  you know what I mean?
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.640]  Which is you can go through tons of plants
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.720]  and you just don't see the it factor, you know?
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.920]  It's got that it factor, you know?
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.840]  So yeah, it's one of my favorites.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.960]  I've had it since 2018.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.800]  It's a good one.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.880]  It's slowest.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.480]  It's one of my slowest ones to throw roots in clone.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.920]  And it's one of the shortest branchiest,
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.360]  widest plants, you know, in my arsenal,
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.600]  but I make room for it.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.280]  You know, it's worth it.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.000]  It's worth it every time.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.840]  Every time I flower it.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:49.880]  I'm sorry.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.760]  No, every time I flower it,
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.520]  I forget how dank it really is.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.000]  Like I could have it, I could have it back
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.360]  and I could be, you know,
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.880]  I could be doing other things
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.280]  and all of a sudden I'll have one
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.880]  and it just gets into that, it's go mode.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.440]  And it's like, fuck man, you just forget,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.200]  you know, you forget how.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.960]  That's what's happening at my house right now.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.880]  I fucking miss my Chem D.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.720]  I really miss my Chem D.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.920]  And yeah, it smells like halitosis
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:22.000]  or a gum infection.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.080]  And like a chemical spill.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.040]  And I hated smoking it.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.520]  I don't know how other people,
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.440]  they'd be like, oh yeah, I'll smoke this shit.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.840]  And I was like, what the hell?
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.440]  But it yielded so much
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.680]  because you could get like out of like six inch containers
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.040]  without even vegging them.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.680]  You could get like, you just root the damn things,
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.520]  put six inch containers down
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.360]  and you get fucking 14 grams per fucking container
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.560]  off the fucking run.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:52.960]  And it was like easy as hell.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.720]  And I loved it and I really miss that clone.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:59.200]  And I really wish I could go back to it,
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.240]  but I don't even know anyone that's even got it anymore.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.400]  I don't even think the people
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.560]  that originally had it have any more, but.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.520]  Hey, Chad.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.880]  You can come up and say hi, Chad.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.360]  I see you in the audience lurking.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.240]  Come say hello.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.840]  You should come say hi to Chad.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.880]  This is delicious, by the way.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.880]  The flavor profile has made my mouth water.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.480]  So it got an eight.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.200]  And so that's kind of my Q point.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.800]  Like if you can make my mouth water after the smoke,
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.160]  that's like, okay, you probably gonna be over seven.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.920]  And it can carry, and like it's chocolate,
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.360]  like chocolate, chocolate, cocoa, chocolate.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.520]  Like it's like, it reminds me of something
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.680]  that I grew before that had a really chocolatey flavor,
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.720]  but this one was very deep in the cocoa end
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.120]  and a little bit less on like the fresh milk chocolate side,
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.360]  like a little bit more dark chocolate,
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.200]  like 85 or 90%.
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.720]  And then like, the smoke's been pretty high.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.200]  I got a good buzz off of it.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.800]  It's hitting a little bit harder than the other two.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.600]  Let's see how long it carries on.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.280]  I'll make that judgment in a couple of seconds,
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.880]  but all in all, it's really nice.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.560]  I'll pull out the next one and get that rolling,
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.880]  but I would love to know, Shay, what you're,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.880]  can't unsay it now.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:22.080]  What you're, what rosin you're trying,
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.920]  how's it going?
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.920]  Because whatever you're doing of the extracts,
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.280]  because you're trying out the extracts right now,
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.120]  aren't you?
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.920]  Yeah, yeah, I was deep into it there.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:36.000]  I kind of, I actually go back to my rosin
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.240]  every two or three hoots just to give me a baseline.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.120]  That sounds kind of funny,
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.240]  but I just know it so well, right?
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.280]  And so.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.760]  No, as you'd, wine people, like they'll have a bit,
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.600]  some of them will have a certain beverage they drink.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.880]  Like it's a very normal thing.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.320]  Like you go back to this one flavor as a baseline.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.360]  So you always have a point.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.480]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.320]  My apologies.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.160]  Yeah, no worries.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.160]  Depending on the terp profile,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.560]  like I might go to another rosin of mine
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.680]  that I know well too, right?
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.320]  If it's fruitier compared to like diesel or gas.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.520]  You know, I like to stick,
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:12.680]  I love those, the breakdown of Jodery,
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.760]  where we got fruit and,
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.840]  fruit and floral and earth gas.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.840]  And man, I'm so baked.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.400]  I just had like six dabs.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.520]  I think I'm forgetting.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.200]  Laura.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.960]  But yeah, I like to separate them.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.960]  It's too hard to lump them all into one.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.120]  I like to, like when you're smoking weed or dabs too,
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.800]  and you're really trying to get the flavor.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.880]  My go-to is like, I heard you do it.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.960]  Like you smack your lips sort of thing.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.560]  And then I like to exhale through my nose slowly
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.320]  as I like do that.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.480]  And then also like the tongue,
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.280]  like try and work it onto the tongue at the same time.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:57.440]  Trying to incorporate like your smell and your taste,
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.080]  and get the two happening at the same time.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.040]  Favorite stones, especially when I was a teenager,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.400]  I'd know it was really good weed if I'd smoke it.
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:09.240]  And then the effect was the same as the taste.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.360]  So I'd smack my lips half hour later,
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.280]  hopefully some sour diesel.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.440]  I'd smack my lips half hour later,
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.120]  and I could taste the stone if that makes any sense.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.360]  Like when you connect these different sensors together
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.760]  to get a fuller, more complete,
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.320]  bigger picture of the experience.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.600]  That's when I know that's good weed.
[01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:38.050]  I like when you've hit however your smoking method.
[01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:41.850]  I mean, if you're smoking a joint or a pipe
[01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:44.730]  or even a bong or whatever,
[01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:46.930]  but not necessarily with concentrates and such,
[01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:48.730]  but if you're smoking out of a joint,
[01:36:48.730 --> 01:36:51.970]  if it tastes good continually,
[01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:57.410]  or is always good and to the last drop,
[01:36:57.450 --> 01:37:02.450]  or if that first initial flavor rush was just a one and done,
[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.490]  those are always real let down plants
[01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:06.410]  where it's like really good weed looking,
[01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:07.810]  and it smells really good,
[01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:10.370]  and it tastes amazing on the first rip.
[01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.730]  And then you go to take another rip
[01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:13.170]  and it just doesn't taste good anymore.
[01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:15.050]  It just tastes like burnt shit.
[01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:17.570]  And you're like, damn, that first rip was amazing.
[01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:21.450]  I like weed that continues to taste good
[01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:22.410]  for long periods of time.
[01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:23.890]  Those are always high scoring for me.
[01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:25.610]  And that's, I love weed.
[01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:26.490]  Totally, yeah.
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:29.330]  The sesquiterps, and like the further,
[01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:30.170]  those are the ultimate ones,
[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:31.330]  the further into the doobie,
[01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:32.970]  you could actually taste better and better.
[01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:34.810]  So the roach, you don't even wanna stop
[01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:36.890]  cause it's really just tasting like off the hook
[01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:37.730]  at that point.
[01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:40.170]  Coastal, do you wanna,
[01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:41.210]  do you wanna let,
[01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:43.770]  and also give me a score on visual appearance
[01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:44.930]  on this one as well?
[01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:49.570]  Visually, that's a seven or an eight,
[01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:52.370]  but I wanted to talk about, yeah,
[01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.170]  what he was talking about.
[01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:56.650]  Yeah, I select for,
[01:37:56.650 --> 01:37:58.330]  I don't select for potency.
[01:37:58.330 --> 01:37:59.650]  I just select for
[01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:05.330]  just the smell and the taste.
[01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:10.130]  And it is all about the terps.
[01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:14.210]  And yes, the sesquiterpins are very important.
[01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:16.330]  Excuse me, my throat is killing me.
[01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:22.010]  And yeah, like I have a Valkyrie OG Kush.
[01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:26.730]  It's like a OG Kush bag seed,
[01:38:26.730 --> 01:38:31.370]  and it has just pure alpha pinene and beta pinene
[01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:36.130]  as its primary and secondary terpins
[01:38:37.450 --> 01:38:39.050]  that I've selected.
[01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:42.610]  And then it's the same thing with some of the other stuff
[01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:43.890]  that I've been selecting.
[01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:47.050]  I just go, like I've been doing an F8
[01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:51.130]  on a cat piss haze for the last like 15 years.
[01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:57.490]  And I really feel like it is really one of those things,
[01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:01.810]  like you gotta like look at it that way.
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:03.010]  And I agree completely.
[01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:08.290]  So we got earth and musk on this,
[01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:10.330]  on this beautiful fucking thing.
[01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:12.650]  Did you guys see it stick to the-
[01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:15.010]  Did you see that?
[01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:17.730]  I didn't, like I barely even pushed that down.
[01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:21.130]  Like that first one, like I barely even tapped it
[01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:22.850]  and it lifted, it was nuts.
[01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:23.690]  So it's very-
[01:39:23.690 --> 01:39:25.850]  It probably would've outlined the wall and it would stick.
[01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:27.970]  That's the ultimate.
[01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:30.530]  And look at the, if you can see,
[01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:33.450]  like what I've been doing, so everybody knows as well,
[01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:36.410]  to just try and keep this to help with the evaluation
[01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:38.170]  as much as possible is between every run,
[01:39:38.170 --> 01:39:40.650]  I try and actually give this a wipe down
[01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.170]  so that there's no dust on it in between.
[01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:45.490]  So you guys can see, and I dumped the bag directly on top
[01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:46.410]  so you guys can see that.
[01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:49.810]  Cause some of these bags, a great indication for me
[01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:54.130]  on something is like kind of how the bag looks.
[01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:56.330]  Like see how the buds stuck there
[01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:57.490]  and see how that has been there.
[01:39:57.490 --> 01:40:00.090]  Like that's kind of a important part for me.
[01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:03.450]  And this has got some serious, like earthy, musky,
[01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:06.570]  fucking beautiful depth to it, actually.
[01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:09.690]  I'm really impressed with this one.
[01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:11.270]  And it looks like it's been,
[01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:14.170]  I don't know how it's been trimmed.
[01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:16.890]  Hard to say.
[01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:19.850]  It looks like it's been hand chopped by the look of it,
[01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:21.050]  but I've squished it down.
[01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:23.130]  So it makes it really hard to tell.
[01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:24.170]  The poor decision.
[01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:34.870]  Yeah, it's pretty.
[01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:37.910]  Yeah, zoomed in on it.
[01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:42.910]  I keep messing up my phone here, but it looks fire.
[01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.910]  It looks really good.
[01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:44.890]  Is it really, really dense
[01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:47.190]  or has it got a little bit of air in it?
[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:48.270]  Oh, I see those.
[01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.270]  Are those hollow?
[01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:54.030]  Yeah, hollow, hollow calyxes.
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:55.110]  Yeah.
[01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:55.950]  In there?
[01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:59.050]  I don't like that at all.
[01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:06.150]  But it is damn sticky and looks very pretty.
[01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:10.870]  But those hollow, those ones in there,
[01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:12.310]  I don't know, sometimes those-
[01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:15.430]  That was looking so good until I cracked that open
[01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:17.790]  because some of those are dead smooth, eh?
[01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:18.630]  Yeah.
[01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:21.250]  They're like, why is my phone doing this?
[01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:25.370]  You know, sometimes that's just not the best smoking weed,
[01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:26.690]  you know, when you get those calyxes,
[01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:28.170]  they get all poppy and hot
[01:41:28.170 --> 01:41:29.730]  and there's different things in there.
[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:32.250]  And it's like those seeds aborted in there
[01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:34.470]  and you get those little tiny little white kernels
[01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:35.730]  that stick around in there
[01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:37.570]  and you can't really even see them sometimes.
[01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:40.110]  And it just ruins the smoke and the flavor.
[01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:42.930]  I don't know.
[01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:43.750]  I can't really tell.
[01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:45.130]  The little poppy mix pop fuckers
[01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:47.290]  and those fucking cigarettes.
[01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:49.010]  Put it this way, it makes me sad.
[01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:50.930]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:54.250]  That made me sad when you broke it open.
[01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.630]  That was emotional.
[01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:58.970]  That gave me some serious-
[01:41:58.970 --> 01:42:01.190]  If you guys didn't think there were thrills
[01:42:01.190 --> 01:42:02.730]  and dudes looking at weed,
[01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.890]  there are thrills at dudes looking at weed.
[01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:07.210]  I mean, holy crap.
[01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:08.650]  This has been an up and down.
[01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:10.310]  I am emotionally distraught.
[01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:16.010]  I was going like, I was gonna push it there.
[01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:18.050]  I was gonna be like 8.6, 8.7.
[01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:19.930]  Like this was a little bit nicer than the other one,
[01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:21.970]  but then the second you cracked that open,
[01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:22.810]  that dropped.
[01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:24.210]  It lost half a point.
[01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:26.210]  Lost it big time, man.
[01:42:26.210 --> 01:42:28.090]  Like it's got that-
[01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:29.650]  What do you guys think that brings it to?
[01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:32.450]  I'd like to know each of your opinion.
[01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:35.050]  Mr. Tree's disappointed as fuck.
[01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:35.890]  We all know that.
[01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:39.010]  I went from 8.5 to 8.6.
[01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:44.450]  Yeah, if I was just looking at it as a whole,
[01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:46.410]  as a bud on the counter, you know what I mean?
[01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:48.130]  Or in a jar and I was looking at it,
[01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:51.290]  that's an 8.5, that's a nine.
[01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:52.130]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:52.130 --> 01:42:53.330]  On like the way that it looked.
[01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:55.770]  And even that little stick,
[01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:58.650]  but then you break it open and it's so heartbreaking
[01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:00.250]  that that brings that thing down.
[01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:03.970]  Yeah, I bring it to a seven.
[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:05.210]  That's something if you had in your garden,
[01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:08.050]  you opened it up, you'd feel like crushed.
[01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.490]  Yeah, I would.
[01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:10.370]  It doesn't get,
[01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:12.190]  it's not something that would continue on
[01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:14.090]  if that was something that it did regularly
[01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:16.570]  or it was just too dense in the form.
[01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:18.530]  I hate things like that.
[01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:22.050]  So I've encountered it too often and I don't like it.
[01:43:22.050 --> 01:43:25.890]  So it brings it down to 6.5, seven,
[01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:27.650]  maybe on a good day, 6.8.
[01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:30.270]  I'll give it a 6.8 once you cracked it open.
[01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.970]  On the exterior, it was a solid,
[01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:36.170]  it was pushing into the nine, 8.8, nine, easy.
[01:43:36.170 --> 01:43:38.450]  But for me, yeah, it drops it a lot
[01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:40.170]  once you crack it open.
[01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:41.650]  It could smoke amazing though
[01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:43.690]  and bring it all back into phase.
[01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:46.550]  So I would go back and do all these things.
[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:48.710]  I gave look seven.
[01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:51.630]  Looks, it's looking that looks,
[01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:53.750]  I don't like that look when that happened, man.
[01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.390]  Is there any husk in there?
[01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:58.750]  No, no, but the purple areas where it purples,
[01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:01.030]  it loses a lot of trichome.
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:03.430]  Yeah, there's no trichomes on the inside of those hollows.
[01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:05.950]  Yeah, it makes me feel like it was tumbled.
[01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.830]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.230]  Like it was, it is.
[01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:10.610]  Like, and even the way the leaves
[01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:11.910]  are looking like they're cut too,
[01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:14.470]  like, cause there's not a lot of stem cut.
[01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:16.150]  There's a lot of like rolled it
[01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.670]  and there's leaf cut flat, you know.
[01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:20.630]  Plants that are pushed too, you know.
[01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:21.470]  Look at that, look at that.
[01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:25.750]  Those malformations and those crazy, you know.
[01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:27.470]  Yeah, I don't like that at all.
[01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.110]  That does not look good.
[01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:32.990]  All right, now I got to smoke it, which is wonderful
[01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:35.390]  because I actually think it's going to smoke really nicely
[01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:37.550]  because it's aroma was really, really quite good.
[01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:41.030]  I actually gave it a pretty good score.
[01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:43.230]  I'm going to give it the seven and a half.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.700]  Excited to taste it.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:54.340]  I felt like I got punched in the stomach when you opened it.
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:57.420]  I did too, I did too, man.
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.260]  That was.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:00.740]  I hope it burns really good.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:01.580]  Super.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.420]  I do too.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.300]  I hope it's like the best thing I've smoked so far.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:09.980]  So many samples, so many samples I've been going through.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.900]  I'm super jacked to smoke it.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.580]  Cause it, you know, the dry haul tastes wicked
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:15.860]  on the dry puff, smell great.
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.420]  I checked all the boxes and then I light it
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:20.540]  and right away, like metal.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:22.140]  Metal on my tongue.
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:26.300]  And oh man, like I've had super duper,
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.500]  duper good synthetic weed, but you got to get that shit out.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.180]  You just got to get it all out.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.760]  And then I like to light it once, right?
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.080]  Once there's a cherry, there's a cherry.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.360]  Even if I mic it, even if I, I hope I do.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.560]  I hope I get it so baked, I just talk away.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.400]  But when I come back and puff on it, oh yeah, there we go.
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.400]  Bonus points.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:54.640]  Yep.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.680]  Nose came through.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.800]  I love when I forget I'm smoking.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.680]  The nose is coming through guys.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.160]  I'm just going to call that out right now.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.360]  And I've got a mix of like,
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.240]  like kerosene and gasoline and fuel.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.280]  I'm just trying to think about what way it leans into.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:17.760]  Is there any popping or any snapping or crackling or funny?
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.240]  It's, it's, it's quite dry.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.880]  It's pretty dry and it crackled a little bit
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:22.760]  when I ground it.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.680]  Nothing too crazy.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.400]  I don't see any, here.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.560]  I can, I can hear it.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:31.360]  Have you been looking at like the, the terp rings, London?
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.920]  Like the terps as they concentrate around the paper
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.800]  or that meets the cherry?
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.640]  Yeah.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.080]  I, when I combust, I put,
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.080]  what I'm doing right now is I'm running everything
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.480]  through a volcano vaporizer at 325.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.880]  And then I run it through the bubbler
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.000]  and I'm changing waters every other
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.240]  and changing bongs every other and give it a rinse
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.880]  and switch it out every other time.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.440]  And, and I'm actually, what I'm doing is
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.640]  I'm scoring everything twice
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.840]  because I'm able to take two tokes,
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.640]  two good tokes out of each one out of it.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.840]  So I'm going to go like one good toke,
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.520]  have a good flavor profile out of it,
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.720]  give everything a score on what I think about it.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.520]  And then come back like the following day
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.920]  and do morning hit and see how that hits me
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.520]  and see, see if the opinion,
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.680]  if the opinion lays before I enter it in that way,
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:15.320]  I want to make sure I have a double evaluation.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.440]  So I'm not overdoing it.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.280]  Cause you know, like we're concession smoking
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.400]  to a little bit right now.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.080]  So it makes it a little bit harder to judge.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.280]  I'm a, I'm a doobie guy.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.760]  I mean, I like all the different things,
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.840]  but I'm a doobie guy, especially when I'm judging.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.120]  Cause I want to like really pay attention to the ash.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.200]  And then if I have to relight it and,
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.680]  and just some other things like how,
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.880]  how it burns in the paper, if it's spotty, you know,
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.800]  the cherry pops up a little further down and like,
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.960]  it's having to go around something that's a little bit
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.840]  fire retardant, you know,
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.960]  maybe one part of the roots had a thick pocket of,
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.320]  you know, whether it's organics or not,
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.240]  a thick pocket of available nutrients.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.960]  And maybe that got into one little area and more than.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.960]  Grind was kind of not great on it.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.280]  The volume, you know,
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.440]  the other ones I've ground up about like what would look
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.400]  like the same amount.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:09.320]  And I've gotten a bit less out of this one for sure.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.120]  The bowl is not as full as you, as the other ones were.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:25.300]  Yeah. I think, I think using joints as a,
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.900]  I guess,
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.940]  terminating factor with,
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.900]  I guess, bud in competitions is really good.
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:39.980]  I think bongs kind of like kill out the turps because the
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:44.020]  turps can kind of get mumbled up in the water.
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:48.340]  And I think the water and the bong will kind of like stop
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:52.180]  you from being able to really taste everything.
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.500]  Like if I ever use a bong,
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.460]  I actually just leave like a quarter inch of water at the
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.980]  bottom and the, like,
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:02.180]  and so that like the actual stem never even touches the
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.100]  water. It's just to hold the ashes.
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:09.020]  And then I use it almost like a chill them that way I can
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.140]  get all the flavor through it.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.580]  But I feel like when it goes through the water,
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.220]  it just kills all that flavor.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:16.820]  And like, yeah,
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.020]  like I think that joints really are the,
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:22.580]  the only way you can really enjoy
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.500]  the bud to its fullest.
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:30.860]  Like all of its flavor, all the turps, all, all that,
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:32.140]  you know?
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:36.700]  I know I run it through a vat at 325 and,
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:37.540]  and I get,
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:42.460]  I get only the terpenes and only the resin and only the THC.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.740]  I don't combust anything.
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.820]  And I think it allows me to have a,
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.460]  have a tighter profile on the flavor.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:50.020]  And if you change the bong out, like you can, you're right.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.660]  It's staying in the water instantly.
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.620]  But if you change the bong out every,
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.820]  every couple of rounds and make sure your pipes are clean
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.740]  and that you do a fresh clean out every, every few,
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.020]  I think you can get a night for it.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:03.140]  I think it depends on everybody.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:05.140]  Like she smoked so many doobies in your life.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.300]  Probably that's like your, your, your, your,
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:10.180]  your most consistent route of, of consumption.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:12.100]  So that's your best form of evaluation.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:15.980]  I think each person's individual form of evaluation is going
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:18.780]  to be unique depending on how they consume regularly.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:19.620]  Right?
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:23.860]  Oh, yo, so definitely Mrs. Coastal,
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.380]  Mrs. Coastal who's sitting right here
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:30.300]  smokes about 20 blunts a day out of a bong.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:35.260]  And she will outsmoke any dude.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.660]  I, I, I, she'll outsmoke like Damien Barley
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.140]  or anyone else, a fucking clandestine smoke dog.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:46.900]  She outsmokes me and I've been smoking for 24 years.
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:52.300]  So it's hilarious, but yeah, like we all had, we all do.
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.940]  We all have our own way of looking at these things
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:58.540]  and, and the way we take it in.
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:02.140]  She, she likes to smoke blunts out of a bong.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:07.140]  And I just, I just like to smoke straight up joints.
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:09.100]  I don't even share them with people.
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.420]  I just, I'll just give someone a joint, you know,
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:13.180]  like, hey, take yours.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:14.140]  I'll have mine.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:16.380]  I don't like, I'm not going to not share,
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:18.740]  but I'm not going to give you the same thing
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:19.980]  I'm putting my mouth on.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.980]  Yeah, coronavirus.
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:25.420]  Yeah, she was saying corona.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:31.660]  But yeah, yeah, it, it is what it is, you know,
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:36.660]  but yeah, I'm just, yeah, don't feel bad about it.
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:41.340]  She felt bad that I was saying that she was smoking so much.
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.700]  She outed me.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.820]  Yeah, that outed her.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:47.540]  I go through a jar every other day.
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:51.180]  It's not, I'm a pretty, I'm a pretty consumer.
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:54.100]  I'll get people looking at my book.
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:55.980]  Oh my God.
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:52:01.140]  I'll throw my hat into the, into the joint camp
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:06.140]  because you're getting the most complete, you know,
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:10.980]  way of, you know, you're vaping it, you're combusting it.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.380]  You're doing all the above as you're,
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:15.380]  as it's pulling, pulling its way through.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:17.820]  So I love smoking joints.
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:19.540]  Above all, I can't smoke joints inside
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.180]  because I set fire alarms off, but I, yeah,
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.700]  that's my favorite way to do it when I'm,
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.140]  especially when I'm trying to taste them.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.100]  I like doing vaporizer and stuff when you're tasting,
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:29.940]  when you're doing taste,
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:33.900]  but I find that when I do the vaporizer,
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.980]  my high is flatter, you know,
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:38.700]  and when I'm, you know, doing like in a volcano or something,
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:40.460]  it's just, it's just a little bit flatter.
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:43.340]  It's just not the, it's not as, not as complete.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:45.300]  I guess is the way that it makes me feel,
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.260]  but it goes back to your form of combustion
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.860]  or the way that you like doing it, you know,
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.620]  your form of doing it.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.120]  But I love the joint because you kind of do both.
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:56.340]  So this one,
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:59.740]  I agree with the joint for sure.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:03.160]  And I think it's, I think it's,
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:08.260]  you get a fuller perspective of what you're smoking
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:11.340]  because of the way it burns.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.820]  Like you guys mentioned that ring, you know,
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.300]  you're getting like stacking flavor
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.780]  that kind of just builds.
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.880]  I think it's, for me, I smoked so much in a joint,
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.480]  that'd be the best way for me to do it,
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:26.780]  but to taste flavor and, and, and every little nuance,
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:29.060]  I like the volcano, like, like London said,
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:31.680]  I think it gives me a better interpretation
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.020]  of what the flower itself tastes like.
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:37.540]  I don't think the high is what I'm looking to find
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.280]  in the volcano.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:40.120]  Anyway.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.940]  This is kind of dank looking.
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.940]  When I opened the bag, it blew up.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.540]  Like the smell was, was pretty good.
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.500]  Let's, let's do one or two more.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.140]  Let's do like one more and we will,
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.660]  and it started, how are you guys feeling?
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:57.100]  We can't, I can go, but I can't.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:57.940]  Looks good.
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:00.660]  No, I like looking at good.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.300]  We got to do this with the Kandahar,
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.500]  your, your, your cooking Kandahar.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.140]  Oh, we will, we will.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.740]  We'll do a round with a couple of those.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.500]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.820]  Yeah, I've got, I should have a good selection.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:15.100]  I'll have some of your Kandahar up next,
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.540]  which will come down at the same time as some Velvet Sky.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.980]  No, the Kandahar will come down first.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.020]  So I've, I'll have my, my weird aqua polka gold,
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:28.820]  the Kandahar and my new Velvet Sky
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.560]  to run through on our next episode,
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.260]  which is actually, we might have to push by,
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.420]  or figure out what we're going to do.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.900]  Cause I'm actually at the cup,
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.940]  at the unicorn cup on that Saturday.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.380]  So we might have to figure that out a little bit.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:44.660]  But this is, this is stanky and I'll give it a little press.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.340]  What does it, what's everybody kind of,
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.700]  let's see if I can get a triple stack.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.420]  Oh, no.
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.900]  It does have some bounce backitude,
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.360]  which is kind of nice to see.
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:58.520]  Does that have a seed?
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.540]  I don't see a seed.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.540]  Right there?
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.660]  No.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.340]  I thought there was a seed pod in the bottom
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.740]  of one of those.
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:13.100]  That's what I thought too.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:13.940]  But.
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:14.780]  Ah!
[01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:22.270]  I always love a good seed pod.
[01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:23.990]  Me too.
[01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.910]  I like it in good weed.
[01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:27.310]  I mean, it's always fun.
[01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:28.610]  Good little treasure hunt.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:34.860]  It stinks, but I know I didn't find,
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:37.340]  I didn't see any seeds in there.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.860]  Not finding anything anyways.
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:40.960]  I'll have a good double check through,
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.580]  but it's dense, like it's hard and thick.
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:47.740]  It doesn't, it's got some bounce back.
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:48.580]  Nice.
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:51.620]  We'll give it a grind up and see how it is.
[01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:57.830]  Corey, how's your dab device?
[01:55:57.830 --> 01:56:00.470]  How's the rosin pressing going for you?
[01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:02.110]  Oh, it's going amazing.
[01:56:02.110 --> 01:56:04.190]  I've pressed so much stuff.
[01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:06.710]  I haven't even smoked flour.
[01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:08.750]  Yeah, no, I'm having a good time with it.
[01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:16.370]  And now I keep getting different toys.
[01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:18.810]  Got a Puffco to play with,
[01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:20.490]  which I like a lot.
[01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:22.650]  79.
[01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:25.850]  Did we get a rating out of everybody?
[01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:26.730]  What did you think, Corey?
[01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:28.450]  What was your rating for this one?
[01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:34.610]  I guess, taking all things into consideration,
[01:56:34.610 --> 01:56:37.650]  I'll give this one a seven and a half.
[01:56:37.650 --> 01:56:38.730]  Ollie, lay down.
[01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:41.490]  How about yourself?
[01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:42.850]  I'll go with a 6.5.
[01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:47.210]  I don't like, it's not all like one little bud
[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:49.250]  to show me the structure of the plant
[01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:50.450]  and the flower itself.
[01:56:51.850 --> 01:56:53.930]  It looks a little flat.
[01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:56.010]  It has some coverage and it stinks.
[01:56:56.010 --> 01:56:57.330]  That always brings it up in my game,
[01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:58.730]  but I can't tell that.
[01:56:58.730 --> 01:57:00.370]  So by looking at it,
[01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:02.290]  if I was looking at it and doing it by looks,
[01:57:02.290 --> 01:57:04.210]  it wouldn't be the one that I picked.
[01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:05.610]  It looks too, yeah.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.240]  Shay?
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.800]  Yeah, I'm gonna give it a seven and three quarter.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:12.640]  Seven and three quarter.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.000]  Seven and a half, yeah.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:16.640]  Just for looks.
[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:22.340]  Coastal, what are you thinking?
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.100]  I'm gonna give that a seven.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:30.420]  I'm gonna give it a 7.25.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:32.340]  I think is where I'm gonna land there.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:36.980]  Oddly specific there.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:40.740]  It's just, while I'm thinking about it,
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:42.860]  I think something else really important to keep in mind
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:44.300]  as you're going through the samples,
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.460]  whatever your method is, is cool.
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:48.180]  Just be consistent.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:52.180]  Same temperature, start up, same amount in the bowl,
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.060]  same number of draws, same amount of water.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.180]  You change your water often if that's what you're doing.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.660]  It's crazy and this is common sense,
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.500]  I don't need to say this,
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:04.260]  but it's crazy how much it changes from paper to paper too.
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.260]  If you're a doobie smoker,
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:07.580]  you go to your buddies with a bag,
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:11.020]  you forgot your papers, you use his whatever.
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:12.460]  And it's either, well for me,
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.300]  it's like, man, this isn't really good,
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:16.140]  but I must not have brought a good one.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:19.140]  It just never tastes as good as your go-to papers
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.540]  that you're used to.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.300]  So just, yeah, consistency in the whole process,
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.060]  start to finish, that's important.
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.700]  Yeah, you can take it one step further too
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:34.180]  and try to just do one sample, maybe two samples a day,
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:35.420]  like right when you wake up
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:39.780]  and really judge the effect of what's going on there
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:42.660]  and really take it in and then wait for that shit
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:45.220]  to wear off and work it out.
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:48.260]  And later that evening, you take the ride the other way.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.420]  And really kind of evaluate the effects and stuff
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:52.700]  the way things aren't muddled.
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:55.460]  I always love, but usually don't have enough time
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.180]  to go through all the samples
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.700]  and the amount of days you would need
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:02.220]  to really give it that full,
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:04.300]  but that's a cool way to really help.
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:06.380]  And then the weed would get older too.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:08.700]  You wouldn't get the cannabis at the point
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:10.580]  that it was submitted,
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:12.460]  which is I think a little bit important as well.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:14.420]  Now you got it like,
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:16.780]  the thing about wine people is they don't like,
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:19.260]  it's not like you can't not inhale weed.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.780]  Like, you know, like wine people can spit.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:22.620]  What do we do?
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.900]  We just got to figure out how to smoke more weed.
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:28.580]  I don't think that, go ahead, Kostal.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:32.980]  So I don't really, like, I heard that shit
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:35.420]  with like some of the people for the high times,
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:37.620]  you know, cops.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:40.420]  And it's like, I don't understand that.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:42.060]  Oh, I need to pace myself.
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:43.900]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.380]  What the hell is that shit?
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:46.260]  You know what?
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:48.420]  If you smoke weed, you smoke weed.
[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:51.380]  Like, I don't understand this idea of like,
[01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:52.540]  oh, it's too much.
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:55.060]  If you have a tolerance, you have a tolerance.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:56.620]  And I do feel bad for people
[01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:58.540]  that don't have enough of a tolerance,
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:03.100]  but some of us can literally just sit here all day
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.340]  and we hit the point where our brains
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:07.500]  stop freaking even taking it in
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.380]  and we're just enjoying the turpence.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.500]  And so I, like, I know a guy
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.140]  that's been smoking for 40 years,
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.460]  but he can barely fucking take one hit
[02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.060]  without going down.
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:23.140]  And it's one of these things, it's like,
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:29.420]  I don't have any judgment against anyone.
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:31.820]  It's just, I've been smoking for so long
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.820]  and I've been smoking so much that I've realized
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:37.540]  that it's like, there's a lot of people
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:40.100]  that it's like, you know,
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:43.060]  it's really just a tolerance issue
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:45.700]  and everyone has their own level.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.340]  And when you hit that level,
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:51.020]  like, it won't even affect you at all.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:52.700]  And I feel like smoking it,
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:54.780]  you can smoke any amount you want
[02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.100]  once you hit this certain tolerance level
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.860]  and it doesn't do anything to you.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.940]  You just kind of like wake up, smoke it,
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:02.300]  doesn't do anything to you.
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.700]  It's just part of your life.
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:08.500]  And I feel like there's a lot of other people
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.980]  on FCP that probably feel the same way.
[02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:13.380]  And I understand that there's people that,
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:15.780]  you know, when they're beginning smoking,
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:18.460]  they don't feel so comfortable.
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:20.820]  And I feel bad for them, like, you know,
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:23.820]  when they're trying to like figure out how it works
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:27.820]  and especially when they get like a bad high.
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:33.060]  But yeah, this is definitely down to tolerance level.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.980]  And you got to just build yourself up to it
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.580]  is what I'm thinking.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.840]  That was, that hit like a fucking train.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:54.910]  Christian Cap, I don't know.
[02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:55.750]  Christian Cap.
[02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:57.590]  So it was the ugly girl at the dance, right?
[02:01:58.670 --> 02:01:59.510]  Yeah.
[02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:01.590]  Yeah, that was the ugly girl at the dance.
[02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:06.390]  Oh, like, like really great nose on it
[02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:11.390]  and flavor and like a good, smooth, nice, easy hit.
[02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:14.670]  Who is this?
[02:02:14.670 --> 02:02:15.510]  Hey, Christian.
[02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:16.350]  Welcome, buddy.
[02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:17.630]  Christian works with us at Rosebud.
[02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:21.110]  He's a big part of our deal.
[02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:22.630]  He just broke his kid out too.
[02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:23.470]  And I told him.
[02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:25.190]  Oh, I think he's busting the kid out there.
[02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:26.030]  Is that what I see?
[02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.870]  Nice.
[02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:27.910]  Hey, buddy, how you doing?
[02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:30.510]  Looks like he's...
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.280]  This Crystal here.
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:41.080]  Crystal's the third leg that holds us all together.
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:42.080]  Hi, guys.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:44.560]  How you doing?
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:45.800]  Hi.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.720]  I'm sitting in on the sidelines.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.760]  Have you, have you, have you guys, can, can you guys,
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:57.000]  can we, do you have your flower kit close by?
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.400]  Oh shit.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.720]  I got the, I got to concentrate one.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:07.080]  Let me, yeah, let me go grab one.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.480]  I want to get your opinion on the aroma on this one
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.880]  because I think it came off really good.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.360]  I got a good buzz off that.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.840]  That was, that was a nice hit.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.880]  What is it?
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.200]  PP.
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:21.880]  PPF 12.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.280]  Hey, you said when you opened it, it, it,
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.480]  it jumped out the bag.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:30.040]  Yeah, it like jumped, jumped right out.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:32.240]  That's always good, you know, when things,
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:36.000]  yeah, I wish I could smell things.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.520]  I wish I could make you smell things.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.720]  I wish I could have you here smelling them.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:44.800]  I'm surprised Zuck hasn't got that figured out yet,
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.640]  you know?
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:57.580]  One day in the far future, please send PPF 12 seeds.
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:59.980]  PPF 12 seeds.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.460]  I love that, mud swat.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:02.300]  Thank you.
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.140]  We appreciate that.
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:06.580]  I like that.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:09.980]  Yeah, I'm going to open this kit up, break the seal.
[02:04:14.090 --> 02:04:14.930]  Nice.
[02:04:16.690 --> 02:04:19.330]  PPF 12, probably be in this one.
[02:04:20.250 --> 02:04:21.490]  Probably an A.
[02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:23.530]  It's going to be an A, PPF 12.
[02:04:23.530 --> 02:04:24.370]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:34.870]  Well, I sure wish I had a kit.
[02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.870]  Lori.
[02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:39.790]  Come join us at the party.
[02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:42.110]  We'll, we'll save one for you.
[02:04:42.110 --> 02:04:44.470]  Come on up from Maine, brother.
[02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:45.950]  Same with you, Mr. Trees.
[02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:50.630]  That smells awesome.
[02:04:50.630 --> 02:04:52.390]  Wow, it smells so fragrant.
[02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:55.190]  The first time you open all of the flavors together.
[02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:57.910]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:20.250]  Aren't you looking for 14?
[02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:21.970]  Oh, it's the very last one.
[02:05:21.970 --> 02:05:23.450]  That's funny.
[02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:25.130]  Of course it is.
[02:05:25.130 --> 02:05:28.250]  You guys, do y'all like my pretty flower?
[02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:31.450]  Like my pretty, isn't it beautiful?
[02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:34.250]  I think I grew it.
[02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:36.250]  I don't know if it's my flower that I grew,
[02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:38.450]  but I've got it in my hair now.
[02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:41.610]  I stole it from my wife.
[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:46.050]  That, yeah, that one like opened up.
[02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:46.930]  It was really nice.
[02:05:46.930 --> 02:05:47.970]  Had a great hit.
[02:05:49.130 --> 02:05:50.330]  Very, very impressed with that.
[02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:54.010]  Maybe it's cause I'm on tasting five or six, but.
[02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:54.850]  It smells good.
[02:05:54.850 --> 02:05:56.610]  It looks better in real life
[02:05:56.610 --> 02:05:58.370]  than it does on camera for sure.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.980]  Yeah, it's a nice, quiet structure.
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:05.380]  Like it's really dense.
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:10.660]  Even though there's some little, you know, pores in it,
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:11.940]  it's still really dense.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:14.340]  And it's got that shine, you know,
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.460]  when it sticks to the bag
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:17.420]  and then it gets that glassy shine after.
[02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:18.260]  I like that.
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:21.140]  It's not trimmed perfect.
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:22.580]  Like there's a couple little,
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:28.020]  couple little leaves trying to escape,
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:29.100]  make it on their own.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:33.580]  You know, and there's like this bit of a gap in here
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:36.180]  between the two buds, but I mean, that's like borderline,
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.580]  but because it's show weed, right?
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:41.620]  It's really, it's one thing to sell this in your bag,
[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:43.620]  but because this is show weed,
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:45.660]  you've got to probably trim that off.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.700]  So I'm gonna stick with my seven and a half,
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.140]  seven and three quarter on this,
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.140]  even though it is really nice.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:56.340]  There's just so many incredible samples here that.
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:59.780]  I don't think you can give it an up on appearance.
[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:01.300]  I think it's just, it's got a really,
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:03.020]  it's gonna have a really nice smoke to it.
[02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:05.100]  I think that's where it's gonna shine.
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.100]  Because that's 20 points.
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.860]  It's like almost 30% of your score.
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:16.260]  That's over 30% of your score is in the smoke ability.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:18.100]  So if you just, if you can get 20,
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:21.180]  if you can get 19 in smoke ability, you know.
[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:23.060]  Is that the one you just smoked, London?
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.620]  Yeah, that's the one that I just consumed.
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:26.820]  Good, good hit, like really happy with it.
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:31.820]  Okay, I'm gonna do it in my go-to papers.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:37.720]  I'm gonna cut the stem out and any of these little leaves.
[02:07:46.130 --> 02:07:47.410]  I'm going to grab more weed.
[02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:48.250]  I'll be back.
[02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:52.450]  Yeah, Corey, what are you smoking on?
[02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:56.010]  Oh my God, I'm smoking on a-
[02:07:56.010 --> 02:07:58.690]  Coastal grown OG's bag's taking over the screen.
[02:07:58.690 --> 02:07:59.810]  He's smoking so much weed.
[02:07:59.810 --> 02:08:01.890]  It's like, it's literally the bag of weed
[02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:03.850]  is just like encroaching on the screen.
[02:08:04.970 --> 02:08:05.810]  Right?
[02:08:07.610 --> 02:08:08.450]  What do you got in there?
[02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:10.850]  No, I'm just smoking a bunch of stuff I pressed.
[02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:18.470]  My wife made sangria six hours ago
[02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:19.910]  and now we have good sangria.
[02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:21.190]  It's fucking delicious.
[02:08:22.110 --> 02:08:23.590]  Yeah, and I just squeezed it up
[02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:24.830]  with a little bit of weed honey.
[02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:26.590]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:29.070]  Live in the summer life.
[02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.110]  Every day I should go pick some,
[02:08:33.110 --> 02:08:35.510]  I should lean over and pick mint from somewhere
[02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:37.350]  and put it in there.
[02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:38.510]  Here, let this slide.
[02:08:41.070 --> 02:08:41.910]  In the beverage.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:49.020]  How long before you move, London?
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:52.020]  Now I can't, now I have to take a break.
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:54.140]  I gotta stop because I've touched cilantro
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.900]  and it's gonna fuck everything up.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:57.900]  I need a minute.
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.140]  That was a poor decision.
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:03.540]  Let me just, everything's gonna stink now of cilantro.
[02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:04.380]  That's brutal.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.620]  When do I move now?
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:11.580]  Not till off December mid.
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:12.620]  What am I doing here?
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:13.460]  18.
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:15.220]  That's better.
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:16.100]  I like that one more.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:18.540]  Not till like mid December.
[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.500]  Somewhere in there.
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:23.060]  Weed's hostile.
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:30.140]  What were you smoking, Coastal?
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:38.100]  I'm smoking some OGK from a friend out in Washington.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:42.820]  I'm just trying to make it
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.540]  till I get this haze run through.
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:50.540]  I'm doing an original haze from Tony from Boneyard
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:54.740]  and then I'm doing an original haze from AGC Co.
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.300]  The purple haze.
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.620]  Then I'm doing KMRs.
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:08.860]  So I'm just waiting for all that to finish off.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:10.780]  I started depping it early.
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:15.300]  So right now I'm just having to like buy other shit
[02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:18.980]  from other people or get it from people
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:20.740]  that'll just give it to me for free.
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.940]  So yeah, I got some outdoor,
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:30.820]  some outdoor stuff and then I got some,
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:36.220]  I think it's white runs carts that I'm smoking on.
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:38.820]  And what was the other one?
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:40.060]  Oh, I don't remember.
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:43.300]  I think it was like some other OGK like kind of cart.
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:44.500]  It was a cookies thing.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:45.780]  Oh yeah.
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:47.340]  Everything is cookies now.
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.260]  She said some sort of cookies thing.
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:53.980]  But yeah.
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.860]  Take what you can get as you can.
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:58.700]  All right.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:03.570]  The batteries around here are ridiculously expensive.
[02:11:03.570 --> 02:11:04.570]  Mr. Trees.
[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:17.470]  The best thing you can do Mr. Trees is put it down
[02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:19.430]  and hold the camera so that it's like
[02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:21.030]  facing downwards at it.
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:27.940]  Unfortunately.
[02:11:36.070 --> 02:11:39.190]  Now we just got poor upwards view of Mr. Trees' hands.
[02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:40.030]  I'm sorry.
[02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:40.870]  There you go.
[02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:41.710]  Yeah.
[02:11:42.230 --> 02:11:43.630]  I'm taking a nap.
[02:11:43.630 --> 02:11:44.790]  He is a moron.
[02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:57.410]  Your audio is off Mr. Trees by the way.
[02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:58.250]  All right.
[02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:59.090]  So wait, wait, wait.
[02:11:59.090 --> 02:11:59.930]  Shit.
[02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:02.810]  Jay, did you do your nissl draw?
[02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:05.170]  Pulling on it for your first time?
[02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:06.290]  What did you think?
[02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:10.210]  What was your rating on the aroma on that?
[02:12:11.050 --> 02:12:12.610]  Like just straight up the smell.
[02:12:12.610 --> 02:12:14.450]  I was gonna give it like an eight actually.
[02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:16.530]  It was pretty good smell.
[02:12:16.530 --> 02:12:18.730]  The burn, I'm just gonna give the burn
[02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:21.890]  like a six and a half actually.
[02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:24.250]  And the taste, taste in my doobie,
[02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:25.690]  it's only gonna get a seven.
[02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:30.570]  You know, this is better than average,
[02:12:32.170 --> 02:12:34.890]  but in this comp, it's not gonna win, no.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:40.440]  It's still good.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.680]  Don't give me a run on the smoke and enjoy it.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.680]  Did we lose Mr. Trees?
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.680]  Yep.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.520]  Yep.
[02:13:17.650 --> 02:13:20.450]  Is that the haze for days you're talking about Coastal?
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:24.640]  Yep.
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.680]  I'm growing the haze for days
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:31.280]  and I'm gonna be crossing her against the purple haze
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.680]  from Todd McCormick that he got
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:36.920]  through Sam the Scout Command.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:40.560]  So it's the original haze, but it's the purple Fina.
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.480]  And then I'm also gonna be crossing selected
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.600]  females of the purple Fina
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.040]  with certain pollen that I had selected
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:57.000]  off the fastest males that like photo,
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:02.120]  basically photos which,
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.800]  so I basically went with all the haze males
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.440]  that like photos which really quickly
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.200]  cause that's what Sam said to do is like
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.600]  just pick the ones that go like really quickly.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:16.360]  And so I'm gonna be making a whole bunch
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:19.640]  of seed stock with all that this year.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  And all y'all get fucking first dibs on all that shit.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:31.400]  I'm gonna try and go through Peter and like have him,
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.800]  I guess, I'm not trying to put it on him,
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:37.080]  but if he's willing to, I'm trying to like,
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.120]  you know, go through him and just have him
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:44.560]  basically help me give these away to y'all.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.440]  I don't want any money from it,
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.720]  but I want to share it with everybody.
[02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:57.350]  Think there's some other guys that do similar things
[02:14:57.350 --> 02:15:01.030]  on Dagger and I think Peter gives them out
[02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:02.630]  because I've gotten some stuff like I know
[02:15:02.630 --> 02:15:05.230]  shooting has seeds and gives them out.
[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.670]  I don't think he sells any of them,
[02:15:06.670 --> 02:15:10.350]  but Peter gives them as freebies, you know,
[02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:14.030]  Peter gives more things that free than you pay for
[02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:15.950]  when you get packs.
[02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:19.830]  Oh, definitely, definitely.
[02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:21.750]  He's very generous.
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:26.540]  And that's our day.
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:27.700]  Oh, there's Mr. Tree, sorry.
[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:29.780]  I haven't invited you up yet, Mr. Tree.
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:32.260]  And that's our daily plug for Dagger.Garden.
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:34.020]  Go ahead and check out where you can get all
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:36.820]  of the great gear, the seeds and the beans
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:38.780]  and the free stuff too.
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.300]  Back a little bit further away,
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:42.420]  back a little bit further away, Mr. Tree,
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:45.060]  a little bit further there, perfect.
[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:48.980]  And I'm gonna make you that right there, that is flawless.
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:51.900]  So move there, you can rotate a little bit.
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.900]  Yeah, yeah, so we can catch the little bit.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:54.980]  That looks nice.
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:56.700]  Yeah.
[02:16:00.970 --> 02:16:01.890]  Which one is it?
[02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:03.930]  What are we looking at, Mr. Tree?
[02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:06.970]  That's a ice cream cake, pure kush femme.
[02:16:08.850 --> 02:16:12.250]  So that was one of the ones that came out
[02:16:12.250 --> 02:16:14.210]  of the pure kush reversal.
[02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:17.130]  It was put on the ice cream cake
[02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:20.570]  and this one's got frigging stank on it.
[02:16:20.570 --> 02:16:25.370]  It's pretty, but it's got really, really good nose on it.
[02:16:28.690 --> 02:16:33.690]  Really rich, really like delightful, like burnt,
[02:16:39.370 --> 02:16:42.530]  some sort of burnt cinnamon roll type thing going on.
[02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:44.370]  It's very delightful smelling.
[02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:46.210]  Got a little fuel, a little earth to it,
[02:16:46.210 --> 02:16:49.370]  a little of that ice cream cake like thing to it,
[02:16:49.370 --> 02:16:54.370]  but it's denser and they're all resin.
[02:16:57.570 --> 02:17:01.450]  I've been breaking up all this stuff in here for seeds,
[02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:04.970]  but yeah, no, it's good.
[02:17:04.970 --> 02:17:05.810]  It's good shit.
[02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:06.650]  I wish you could smell it.
[02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:07.970]  That's good, that's a good one.
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.840]  I can't wait to some of these Kindehars.
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:21.400]  Two weeks, I'll be choppy choppy
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.120]  and I'll be able to try them out.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:24.120]  It'll be very good.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:29.360]  I had to go back to my own weed for a landing point.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:31.680]  I think that was an excellent suggestion there.
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:33.920]  It definitely gives you a good landing point.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:38.240]  Yeah, and you ever noticed that your taste changes
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.760]  day to day too?
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.280]  Like some days the same bag, same jar,
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.200]  doesn't taste very good.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.040]  Another day it tastes awesome.
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.960]  The beverage, I find like,
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:51.080]  I had a strain of my strawberry banana
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.040]  that if you had something sweet on your palate,
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.160]  it tasted like strawberries.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.040]  If you had something savory on your palate,
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:58.000]  it tasted like truffles.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.600]  Like it would just like completely go back and forth
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.000]  between the two, it's weird.
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:07.760]  Except one strain, the one strain that beats everything.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:10.000]  Pure Haze.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:13.600]  Nothing beats Pure Haze.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.240]  At least that's my opinion is like,
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:20.520]  I can smoke that all day, every day.
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:25.520]  Like that woody, like cat piss, like soapy Haze.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.920]  Oh my gosh, like the buds are like so soft.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:32.120]  Like, and they're like really,
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:35.080]  the calyxes are really large and it's just like,
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:37.560]  I don't know.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.200]  I think I could smoke that if I was on an island deserted
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:43.840]  by myself for the rest of my life
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.560]  and I could pick only one thing, Pure Haze.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.560]  I think that that has to be the one thing.
[02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:56.630]  I think I'd go Sour Diesel.
[02:18:56.630 --> 02:18:58.150]  I think I'd go Sour Diesel.
[02:18:59.630 --> 02:19:00.870]  That's a good one too.
[02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:03.110]  I love Sour D.
[02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:06.950]  Corey, what about you?
[02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:07.990]  What would be yours?
[02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:12.270]  I like Sour D too, but I don't know.
[02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:17.030]  I try to, I guess I lean towards more like an OG.
[02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:18.190]  I like OGs.
[02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:21.550]  I like the gelatos.
[02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:25.350]  I like, I kind of lean that way.
[02:19:25.350 --> 02:19:30.350]  I like that more sedative, body high, relaxed.
[02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:33.470]  I also like that, you know, to feel awake too.
[02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:38.470]  But generally speaking, I'm amped up way more than I am.
[02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.150]  Just on my own.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.200]  I almost lost my girlfriend there, my wife.
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.160]  My wife, I can't believe I said girlfriend.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.960]  She just looked at me, oh my God.
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:54.800]  Oh geez.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:56.040]  It gets really awkward.
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:58.520]  Yeah, at the beginning it gets awkward.
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.360]  Hey, fucking.
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:05.480]  Your response, like that OGs from you
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.280]  was just so priceless, Che.
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.200]  I just, this is all I heard.
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:12.200]  And I was just like, yeah, that's, yeah.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:13.360]  She's mad at me now.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.600]  She's disappointed at least.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:18.520]  I've done it.
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.000]  I've done it.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.360]  Like, wait till you forget her birthday.
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:27.520]  The fucked up thing is I've been saying wife for months,
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.600]  like for years.
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:31.040]  Like I've been calling her wife since I was first born.
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:32.960]  Now it's like, I said girlfriend one time.
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:35.240]  I'm like, I'm gonna get stabbed in the teeth.
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:37.480]  When's your birthday?
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.680]  August 2nd is coming up very shortly.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.520]  Fuck.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:41.360]  Oh my God.
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.880]  You gotta go do some things and stuff.
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:46.240]  When's my birthday?
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:50.800]  My wife's now asking me when her birthday is.
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:53.440]  This is bad news, all of it.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:56.120]  It's created an avalanche.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:58.160]  Because one time at the doctor's office.
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:01.400]  Oh yeah, one time in the doctor's office
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.560]  I forgot her birthday.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:08.000]  I've forgotten how old I am every year.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.800]  I'm like, that's all.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.560]  I usually have to ask my wife.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:15.280]  The good thing is my daughter was born
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.560]  10 days before my 30th birthday.
[02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:19.520]  So it's a pretty round number.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:21.360]  So it's like, how old is my daughter?
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:22.240]  Oh, four.
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:24.680]  So I'm like 34.
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.440]  So that's how I do the math.
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:33.080]  Okay, this is my thought in life, okay?
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:37.240]  Your brain has a certain amount of storage of information.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.720]  There's only so much information
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.400]  that you can compile and place into one zone.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:45.280]  And some things are just not as important.
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:46.720]  And I mean, don't get me wrong,
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:49.240]  my wife's birthday, that's crazy important.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:53.080]  My own age, it doesn't really fucking matter to me, man.
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:55.120]  Like once you got to 21,
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:58.120]  it stopped, things just start going downhill.
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:01.160]  You get to 29, 30, it's just like, fuck it, it's over.
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:04.440]  So you really stop counting.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:05.440]  You really don't care.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:07.120]  Because it doesn't matter anymore.
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:13.080]  And so I've just expelled that information out of my mind,
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.440]  and I've replaced it with other things.
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:21.680]  Some weird things, mostly gardening things.
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:27.560]  A lot of gardening things.
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:29.760]  Get rid of some information so there's space
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:32.680]  for the more important things is what you're trying to say.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:34.600]  In your own birthday, you can look in your wallet
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:35.920]  and figure that out.
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:40.920]  Yeah, I replaced that one with my daughter's age.
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:41.800]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:43.600]  Yeah, 100%, I agree with you.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.760]  Get rid of some information,
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:47.160]  replace it with new stuff, right?
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:48.400]  Yeah, I like your philosophy.
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.960]  I run the same way, I feel exactly the same.
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:55.080]  You got to keep learning though.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.960]  But you also continue to forget stuff.
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.920]  So that's a thing too.
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:03.960]  Life sucks sometimes.
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:05.160]  That's wonderful.
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:06.840]  But I think I've had a wonderful evening
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:09.600]  and I'm starting to fade into the abysmal depths
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:14.640]  of over consumption and my verbiage is going away.
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:19.200]  So I am going to probably do another live tasting
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.800]  at some point tomorrow, over the next couple days,
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:23.800]  throughout the week.
[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.480]  Pretty much every day I'm gonna try and do a couple
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:27.480]  like throughout the day.
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:30.840]  Like I'll just stop in and I'll do like a 10
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:34.080]  to 20 minute live stream and I'll do a tasting
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:37.360]  of a couple of them and just run through the whole gamut.
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:38.800]  And just like I did earlier,
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.640]  so that people can kind of follow along.
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:44.280]  And we can, of course, anybody,
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:46.760]  any of the other judges that wanna come in
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:51.320]  and do it with me and taste with me while I'm doing it,
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:54.760]  if they're available to hop in, that'd be awesome too.
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:00.400]  I'll just push you the link every time I do it
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.280]  because it'll probably be when I don't have
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:05.640]  two screaming children, like one is napping,
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:06.480]  you know what I mean?
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.520]  Like one's napping and the other one's watching Blippi,
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.200]  you know, like those are my,
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.600]  that's kind of how my life works right now.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:18.600]  So if I'll give you a good 30 minutes heads up at least,
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.440]  and then we'll try and schedule something.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:23.040]  Next few days I have a pretty clear day.
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:25.880]  So it'll be pretty open.
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.360]  I like that it's actually on the weekend,
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.360]  but yeah, Mr. Trees.
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.200]  So we got to do a couple of things here
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.560]  is where can we catch your gear, bro?
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.840]  Where can we get all of your amazing things,
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:36.880]  all of these amazing plants?
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:40.360]  Because if you watch the earlier portion of the episode,
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:43.240]  we actually ran through your plants.
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:46.440]  There's some beautiful stuff coming out of your packs.
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:48.560]  Right, there's some fun, like there's variability.
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:50.640]  And I think that's what we all want, right?
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.280]  Like I wouldn't, I don't know if I speak for everybody here
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.880]  and I know breeders strive for a consistency
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:58.760]  in certain things.
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:00.920]  But when I pick up a pack, that's like a cross,
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:03.000]  I want some good variability.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.320]  I want some funky stuff.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.400]  I want some unique stuff.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  I want a couple of good keepers,
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.920]  but I want to like, I want to see what comes out of it.
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:11.480]  I want to see some variability.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.320]  So I like that these are such a nice flat base cross
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:17.440]  and you get such a good diverse profile.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:20.200]  And there's some beasts in there too, which is awesome.
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.720]  Yeah, after you're like a plant person for a long time,
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.880]  looking at plants is as much the fun part as anything else.
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.040]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:37.040]  I grow lots of tomatoes and different corn and funny things.
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.400]  And you pretty much know what they're gonna turn out to be.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:44.720]  And you can count on it and there's good value in that.
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:46.760]  But I like looking through stuff
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.360]  and I like making different, like fruit trees
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:51.320]  and funny things.
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.720]  So you can just look at what happens
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.000]  and how the genetics are thrown against the wall.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:56.840]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:57.840]  Like what happens, you know?
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:02.600]  So with the crosses and the fun stuff, it's fun.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:04.200]  And I'm glad we can do shows like this
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:06.120]  where people want to have the fun
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:08.000]  and we all grow something
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.160]  and we get to find the common denominators
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:13.560]  and what's going on with it and see cool stuff.
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:18.560]  And you know, it's super valuable and fun,
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:21.000]  you know, to figure out what's worth it,
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.520]  what's not worth it, you know, what was fun,
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:25.160]  what sucked.
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:26.640]  But you can get my stuff, man.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:29.720]  Daga is like number one.
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:33.840]  So Daga, Daga, Daga, garden, number one.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:35.920]  You can get different types of fruit trees
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:39.120]  and some packs of seeds and random things
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:41.480]  that I have limited numbers of that doesn't, you know,
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:44.120]  can't go to Daga or anywhere else.
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:46.120]  You can get it at my place at Orchard Fever.
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:49.400]  There's fruit stuff and sugar cane
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.240]  and weird fruit tree seeds, worm castings,
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.440]  all kinds of weird stuff that comes from the farm here.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.960]  So check it out.
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.920]  And, you know, you got questions
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:02.840]  or anybody's got problems with something, you know,
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:05.800]  hit me up on IG and, you know,
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.640]  I'll make sure that, you know, you got a sick tree,
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:10.320]  you want something, you need help, you know,
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:11.800]  down a lot, you know, just let me know.
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:12.640]  I like helping out.
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.120]  So until it gets way too much, keep sending them, you know?
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:19.000]  So it's all good.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.840]  About January 1st, you're going to start getting a lot
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:24.240]  of phone calls about putting in orange trees,
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:25.720]  just a heads up.
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:29.320]  It's like orange and citrus and olive.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.320]  Have you done much olive?
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:33.600]  Yeah, we, so like we go-
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:35.280]  Because I know you worked at the nursery,
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:36.640]  but so do you do a lot of-
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.920]  Yeah, we discourage, I discourage olive
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:40.320]  along the coastline here.
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.560]  You know, we have the olive fruit fly going on.
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  And after a few years, you end up with a bunch of worms
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:47.400]  inside your olives, unless you're using a bunch
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:50.240]  of nasty stuff and spend a bunch of effort trying
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:55.120]  to stop the, you know, the olive fruit fly.
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.200]  So I'm stoned.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.560]  But yeah, so I, once the olives get further east,
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:04.400]  you know, into like Ramona and Temecula and, you know,
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:07.480]  other places where it's a little drier, a little bit hotter,
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:08.600]  you have less of that, you know,
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:10.040]  you still have to deal with certain things,
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:12.280]  but they grow better out there
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.080]  and you have less issues and stuff.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:16.640]  But there's some cool Italian olives and stuff
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:19.120]  that we come across every year.
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:21.520]  A lot of them need pollination.
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:24.120]  So you gotta do multiple of them and stuff like that
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.800]  to get good pollination out of some of them.
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:27.960]  There's some that don't,
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:30.480]  but depends on what you wanna use them for
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:31.320]  and what you're looking at.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:32.880]  How many years on oranges?
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:35.760]  Like from what?
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:37.240]  Till you're getting oranges?
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:39.960]  Like, just cause, okay, we've talked about,
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.400]  so apples aren't true breeding, right?
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:43.880]  Like when you plant an apple seed,
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:45.640]  you're gonna get a fucking what the fuck ever.
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:46.800]  And essentially you always have to,
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:48.920]  it's always a grab bag and then you gotta
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.280]  atypically propagate them or group them
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.840]  or do whatever you fucking do.
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:56.000]  Yeah, same with citrus for the most part.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.080]  Same with citrus for the most part.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:00.160]  How bad is the diversity?
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:02.840]  And like, can I breed really like,
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:06.760]  cause I really have this fascinated love
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:10.120]  with like blood oranges in Italy.
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:13.720]  And I really, I need to surround my property with them
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:16.520]  and I need to be able to go out and pick a blood orange
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:17.960]  and eat it off of a fucking tree.
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:20.640]  Like it has to happen in my lifetime.
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:22.080]  If it's one thing I do before I die,
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:24.600]  it's gotta be, that's it.
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.800]  So I like, but I always read all these books.
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:30.200]  Well, I've always read these books.
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:31.720]  And now the thing is I've been to Sicily,
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:33.200]  I've been in Italy a few times
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:36.200]  and I've always read these books about these,
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:39.240]  like you cut them open and they're like plain glass windows
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.720]  and there's these spectacular things.
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:44.360]  And I've seen and had a few occasions
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:46.840]  of some very, very nice stuff,
[02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:51.320]  but I haven't had a consistently really good
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:52.880]  and beautiful blood orange.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:54.280]  And I'm wondering like, is that,
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:56.360]  cause nobody's properly like,
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:57.760]  it's like one of those things.
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:29:59.800]  It's like one of those things that's just not as common
[02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:01.880]  or it's a challenge or what is it?
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:03.360]  Do you know?
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:04.400]  No, so here's the deal.
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.560]  Like you're not gonna get a lot of blood oranges shipped.
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:08.400]  They have a different acid content, you know,
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:10.120]  so they go bad a lot quicker.
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:11.480]  And there's a lot of the good varieties anyway,
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.000]  like Benguino, Sanguini, I'm saying it wrong,
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.920]  but there's one that's like, it's like vanilla candy.
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:19.880]  It's like a delicious variety, but you can't ship them
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.120]  cause if it's lower acid,
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:23.120]  it doesn't keep for a very long period of time.
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.080]  So they go bad and people lose money
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:26.840]  and you know, all this yada yada.
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:31.320]  There's like, you know, Moro is one of the more common ones
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:33.960]  around here and that one is beautiful stained glass.
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:35.920]  We'll get some beautiful, like,
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:38.560]  it looks like the sun coloring on the outside of it.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:40.640]  It's like really, really sharp.
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:44.360]  There's Sanguinelli is another one.
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:45.960]  That's one of the more common ones you'll find,
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:47.480]  you know, out there in Italy and stuff,
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:48.920]  like in the markets and stuff,
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.000]  they have lots of Sanguinelli
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.440]  and they're a little bit more oval shaped
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:53.560]  and just look like the fucking fire sun,
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:55.520]  like human torch, you know,
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:58.160]  remember the old marble human torch thing.
[02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.640]  It looks like human torch, you know,
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:01.160]  like the coloration on the outside.
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:03.000]  They're really, really cool.
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.080]  As far as like sweetness and stuff,
[02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:08.360]  they're definitely not my favorite oranges to eat
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.000]  compared to like, you know,
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.800]  like Caracaras and tangerines,
[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:14.720]  like the 88-2 and the, you know,
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:16.520]  the other ones like that, the gold nugget,
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:19.600]  the Nova's, all those are really delicious.
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:23.000]  Blood oranges have their own type of flavor
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.680]  and they're absolutely divine, delicious.
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.120]  They have a lot of medical properties
[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:30.120]  and are just out of this world, you know, what have you,
[02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:31.720]  but there are so many varieties
[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:34.440]  that you can get where you're going.
[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:36.480]  We can get, you can even order them,
[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:40.240]  I think internationally, you can order from the CCPP,
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:42.480]  the Citrus Clonal Protection Program,
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:45.480]  and you can get little budwood
[02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:48.680]  of all kinds of rare varieties from, you know,
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.440]  that don't ship well, all kinds of rad shit
[02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:53.360]  that you would never even believe.
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:56.520]  It's like, it's a category of all the world's citrus, right?
[02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:59.840]  And you can get these budwood snips sent right to you
[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:01.040]  and they're pathogen free
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.160]  and we can graft them on onto nice stock
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.600]  and you can have a whole collection of blood oranges
[02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:06.840]  from around the world
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:09.440]  and all the best varieties that nobody has.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:13.120]  As well as if you wanted to spend the time,
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:17.640]  you could take a blood orange and like say a pummel oak,
[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:20.240]  not all citrus, so you have to figure out
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:23.280]  which types of citrus have seeds
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:26.040]  that are gonna bear hybrid offspring.
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:28.760]  And pummel oak is one of the citrus varieties
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:32.680]  that the seeds in a pummel oak will bear hybrid offspring.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:35.200]  So breeding stuff to pummel oak
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:38.680]  and plus pummel oak puts out a fuck load of seeds,
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:39.520]  you know what I mean?
[02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:41.000]  More seeds than any orange will ever give you.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.800]  You know, it's like pretty much all seeds.
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:46.040]  It's like this giant grapefruit is like what a pummel oak is.
[02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:49.320]  It's like a giant grapefruit, it's just like full of seeds
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:52.180]  and really sour, really gross.
[02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:54.840]  But if you pollinate it with say blood oranges
[02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.840]  and I can teach you how to do weird stuff
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:59.360]  and control bags for the most part and stuff like that.
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:01.800]  It takes a little bit of, you know,
[02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:03.320]  a little bit of ingenuity to do it
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:04.500]  and make sure that you're doing it,
[02:33:05.020 --> 02:33:06.700]  but it's totally cool.
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:08.860]  You could take that with a pummel oak,
[02:33:08.860 --> 02:33:10.140]  pollinate the pummel oak
[02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:13.820]  and then grow the pummel oak seeds out,
[02:33:13.820 --> 02:33:15.540]  vice versa, whatever.
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.620]  And then, you know, you can sort through there.
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:21.020]  Find the blood orange.
[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:23.840]  Orange, you know, spend 10, 20 years
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:25.860]  looking through different seedlings.
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:27.780]  And then when they finally start spitting out fruit
[02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:30.560]  in 10 years, you know, 11 years, we can bend the trunks.
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:34.140]  We can force them to fruit a little bit earlier
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:37.260]  than, you know, a lifetime for sure.
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:38.580]  There's ways we can do that too.
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:39.940]  I can do this a couple of times.
[02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:40.940]  I can get started.
[02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:41.820]  I got an acre.
[02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:43.020]  I gotta get started.
[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:46.500]  Yeah, well, yeah, you get started by ordering the budwood
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:49.500]  and getting the trees and you get the real varieties
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:52.620]  and then you play around with other stuff.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:55.340]  And, you know, that's how you would breed
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:58.300]  and like try to get something out of your citrus program.
[02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:01.460]  You know, right now they're breeding
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:05.540]  the Australian finger lime to a bunch of pomelo stock
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:08.220]  because the Australian finger lime showed resistance
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:12.220]  against the wanglongbing
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.940]  or the citrus greening disease that we have here
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:16.700]  which is killing all the citrus.
[02:34:16.700 --> 02:34:20.260]  And there's a resistance gene in the Australian finger lime
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.220]  and they're trying to put it into the pomelo
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:23.340]  so that we can look through there
[02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:25.140]  and create all new varieties with resistance.
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:26.820]  And they can look on it and pull out the ones
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:29.460]  that are resistant and have that characteristic.
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.700]  And then we can have all new citrus
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:33.780]  because Florida's are pretty much nobody plants them
[02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:34.900]  in their backyard anymore.
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:35.900]  Cause we're decimated.
[02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:38.940]  They all die from this disease.
[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:43.060]  And we're on the chopping block down here in San Diego
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.500]  and in Southern California,
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:48.540]  it's here and knocking on the door.
[02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:52.820]  So eventually we'll need the resistance.
[02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:54.340]  Does what you're saying though,
[02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.980]  if everything's gonna be coming out of that same thing
[02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:59.860]  to try to fix that problem, cause bottlenecking
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:03.460]  and possibly some other problem down the road?
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:05.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:09.740]  Yeah, I'm sure there's always a cause
[02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:11.540]  and reaction for everything.
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:12.500]  I mean, what else do you do?
[02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:13.340]  I'm just saying.
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:14.180]  I don't know.
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:19.180]  Yeah, that's above where I would know or where I would see
[02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:21.100]  but I know how to get there
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:24.060]  and I know exactly what needs to be done
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:26.900]  and the proper ways to do it to get that point.
[02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:29.740]  Once we're there and all those different things,
[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:30.580]  I don't know.
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:31.860]  I think maybe it's just a gene
[02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:35.420]  and it won't make much of a difference
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:38.380]  but because it came from one thing, I don't know.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:41.100]  I don't know how you're gonna, that's above me.
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:44.180]  But if you wanna just breathe your own citrus
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:47.740]  and have seed stock to look through of a variety
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:50.260]  by pulling off the flower parts
[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:52.500]  and doing your pollination and stuff,
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:55.220]  that's something that anybody can do.
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:56.420]  It's a different scale.
[02:35:56.420 --> 02:35:57.260]  I like this.
[02:35:57.260 --> 02:35:58.100]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.100 --> 02:35:58.940]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:35:59.780]  Yeah.
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.620]  I love these little things.
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:03.540]  It's like, it doesn't take a lot of work.
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:04.860]  Well, I mean, it takes a lot of work
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:09.140]  but it's like once, like a lot of work every seven years.
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:11.780]  You know, like there's not, you know,
[02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:13.900]  it's not every day I have to go out there
[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:16.460]  and tend everything all the time.
[02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:18.220]  But anyways, I'm starting to get burnt out.
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:19.060]  I don't know about you guys.
[02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:20.500]  I'm at two and a half hours.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:22.580]  You guys, I think it's time.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:25.700]  I had to ask a citrus tea question to Mr. Trees
[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:26.700]  and that was a fucked up point.
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.540]  Anytime bro.
[02:36:27.540 --> 02:36:29.340]  I should, we should take a quick moment
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:31.580]  and say thank you, Dave for coming.
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:33.540]  Do you wanna give a shout out a little bit
[02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:36.260]  and let people know a little bit about you?
[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:39.940]  Cause you actually have some product from Rosebud
[02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:41.660]  coming on the market LP wise.
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:45.180]  So let people know what people can do to support you there
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:49.260]  because you could, they can ask at dispensaries in Canada
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:50.780]  for your product now, depending,
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:53.140]  now or how long until you have stuff
[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:54.640]  in the dispensaries in Canada?
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:58.820]  Like three weeks away into BC.
[02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:02.620]  We've got a one gram, excuse me,
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.740]  a half gram live rosin cart, pure rosin.
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:07.740]  That's what we grow.
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:10.060]  It's our own genetic Sarah secret.
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:13.300]  And we put that on under BC Guava gas.
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:14.620]  So it's really good description
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:17.160]  of what you're getting in the package.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.100]  And we're stoked about it.
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:20.460]  We're getting really good feedback.
[02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:22.140]  So we're stoked to be putting that out.
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:25.500]  There's not many options out there in the live rosin,
[02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:27.620]  especially cart area.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:32.620]  And then a half gram loose rosin as well, same live rosin.
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:37.460]  And then we've got a topical coming.
[02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:38.820]  Really stoked about this topical.
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:42.100]  We've been running this topical for personal use
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:44.940]  and some friends, some patients for a long, long time.
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:46.460]  And we're really excited.
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:47.780]  I think it checks all the boxes.
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:50.860]  So that'll be hitting a couple of weeks later in BC.
[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:55.700]  And then in Ontario fall, maybe late September, October,
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:58.260]  we got the one gram live rosin cart
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:38:00.000]  coming out there as well.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.780]  And then a bunch more offerings that we'll see how it goes.
[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:08.220]  And yeah, there's where we're sun grown outdoor
[02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:09.380]  and LP in Canada.
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:12.500]  We're pretty small, but one acre production.
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:16.380]  Full site is only three acres because we're regenerative
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:19.020]  and we can't really do that at large scale.
[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:22.620]  So we draw the line at that kind of square footage.
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.340]  We want a quality, that's our lane.
[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:26.240]  We don't want to compete with the mids,
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.420]  really focused on quality.
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:30.260]  So we're gonna do things by hand.
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:33.380]  The best quality we found is actually in your microbial.
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:35.860]  It's really about your living soil.
[02:38:35.860 --> 02:38:37.260]  So we went no till this year.
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:39.080]  We're stoked about that.
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:40.620]  Shitty season this year.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:43.120]  We were like rain and cold.
[02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:45.700]  Plants are really small this year.
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:47.260]  Last year we had a bumper crop.
[02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:52.260]  We pulled close to 5,000 kilogram out of one acre canopy.
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:56.460]  So we're stoked about that, but that's farming, right?
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:57.780]  Some years you get a good year
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:39:01.380]  and prepare for not so good year too.
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:05.380]  And then we're involved with one of four founders
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:09.060]  of a processing facility here in Nelson.
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:12.620]  We're in the heart of Nelson, Kootenays.
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:17.620]  And a bunch of local legacy transitioned like ourselves
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:20.460]  went in to do this.
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:24.220]  So I think we're the first processor to do that.
[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:28.380]  Come all from the old market to the new market.
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:30.180]  And we really brought the best of our best
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.220]  of our community together.
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:34.260]  And then that all ties into the Unicorn Cup,
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:38.900]  which is like a celebration of our plant and our community.
[02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:40.860]  There's also the educational part.
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:44.060]  We're really trying to support each other.
[02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:46.740]  Like it's tough here in Canada too right now.
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.560]  It's a saturated market.
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:51.980]  And a lot of our friends aren't making it
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:54.140]  on the old legacy side of things either.
[02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:57.700]  So, the people that deserve to be with this plant
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:39:59.740]  or the people that have been with it, in my opinion,
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:02.780]  that have risked their neck to be with this plant
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:03.760]  for a long time.
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:07.300]  And I think they deserve a shot
[02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:09.340]  to keep working with this plant.
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:12.420]  And ideally, if we can make a living legally,
[02:40:12.420 --> 02:40:14.060]  I think we'd all be just fine with that.
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:15.420]  We just wanna do what we love to do.
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:17.380]  We're passionate about this plant.
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:20.020]  So that's a big part of our event too, right?
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:22.740]  And then celebration, like we bring in,
[02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:23.740]  we brought in Sticky Buds,
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:26.620]  who's a place just down the road at Shambhala.
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:28.740]  He's been their headliner for 16 years
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:30.060]  at one of their stages.
[02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:33.820]  And we bring in a pretty awesome sound system.
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.060]  We're stoked about Nocturne.
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:38.420]  They brought in the first Hennessy sound design into Canada.
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:40.260]  Just brought that back from Boston.
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:42.940]  And it's a lake, this property,
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:45.700]  it's like ties into the really regenerative approach.
[02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:48.340]  Is this lake is a pristine,
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:51.700]  what a hundred acre lake, no motors allowed.
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:53.940]  Loons, eagles, wolves come through.
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:56.420]  We're in a wildlife corridor between two big parks
[02:40:56.420 --> 02:40:58.180]  and beautiful property.
[02:40:58.180 --> 02:40:59.620]  And that's where we hold this event too.
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:01.660]  So the event itself, it has to be,
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:04.740]  the people that attend have to understand
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:06.660]  their relationship with their environment
[02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:09.140]  and be grateful to attend on this land
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:10.860]  and respect the land.
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:12.100]  That's really part of it.
[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:13.980]  Burning Man has their own way of doing that.
[02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:16.140]  And Shambhala, we have our own way too,
[02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:17.940]  but it's that same theme.
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:20.780]  And so, yeah, I think this all ties together.
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:23.380]  We're trying to like support our community,
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:26.540]  like the economy of our community,
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:28.220]  the people that deserve to be with this plant
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.900]  and celebrate it when we have the chance.
[02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:39.990]  So I saw in the comments there, Hillbilly,
[02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:41.630]  Hillbilly, where are you there?
[02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:43.750]  Hillbilly Herb, I didn't catch LP.
[02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:48.830]  It's Rosebud Farms and they're coming on BC two weeks.
[02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:50.830]  And how long on OCS?
[02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:52.350]  Fall, September?
[02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:53.790]  It'll be the fall, yeah.
[02:41:53.790 --> 02:41:56.150]  And then the first quarter of next year,
[02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:58.710]  we should have some more products coming in Ontario.
[02:41:58.710 --> 02:42:02.990]  It's rosebudcannabisfarms.ca.
[02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:06.470]  And we're rosebudfarmsltd on social media
[02:42:06.470 --> 02:42:10.190]  because of the cannabis name issues.
[02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:13.310]  And then unicorncup, unicorncup.ca
[02:42:13.310 --> 02:42:15.870]  and theunicorncup on IG.
[02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:22.790]  I've got the unicorn cup stuff in the description.
[02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:25.470]  I don't have Rosebud in there,
[02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:27.910]  but definitely make sure that you're,
[02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:29.470]  if you don't, I mean,
[02:42:29.470 --> 02:42:32.670]  if you're requesting your product in any region,
[02:42:33.350 --> 02:42:34.190]  it probably helps regardless.
[02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:36.550]  So if you're at a dispensary in Canada,
[02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:38.390]  even if you're walking by one,
[02:42:38.390 --> 02:42:43.390]  even if you've never bought weed in a Canadian,
[02:42:43.430 --> 02:42:45.190]  I'm using a terrible word.
[02:42:45.190 --> 02:42:47.190]  Even if you never bought cannabis
[02:42:48.310 --> 02:42:50.350]  in a Canadian dispensary before in your life,
[02:42:50.350 --> 02:42:52.550]  you've always bought it legally or grown it yourself,
[02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:54.070]  or you get it from a friend,
[02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:57.270]  walk into a dispensary and request their product.
[02:42:57.270 --> 02:42:59.790]  Just help grow the community.
[02:42:59.790 --> 02:43:01.190]  Cause as you heard, it's,
[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:02.070]  like she's so humble,
[02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.070]  he's like regenerative farm.
[02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:04.870]  I think that's important to boast on too.
[02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:07.390]  And support Mr. Trees as well.
[02:43:07.390 --> 02:43:09.630]  And then always make sure if you go to a conference
[02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:11.470]  and you see Corey to smoke some of his weed,
[02:43:11.470 --> 02:43:13.590]  cause it's apparently really fucking good.
[02:43:15.390 --> 02:43:18.310]  Kevin Jodry was talking about it apparently.
[02:43:18.310 --> 02:43:22.510]  But yes, I'm excited to see you at the cup.
[02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:24.710]  And Mr. Trees, I'm coming down to California
[02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:27.190]  before I'm over to Italy, I swear to God.
[02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:30.750]  We'll come, we'll pop down for a goodbye.
[02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:32.990]  Turns out buying a hybrid on a lease
[02:43:32.990 --> 02:43:35.350]  can benefit you a great deal
[02:43:35.350 --> 02:43:37.630]  if you do it just before a pandemic
[02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:39.350]  and then have to sell the vehicle.
[02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:43.270]  They wanna buy that car so much from me.
[02:43:43.270 --> 02:43:46.350]  I'm like, I'm gonna hold on a little bit longer.
[02:43:46.350 --> 02:43:49.110]  But yeah, so thank you guys for coming on.
[02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:53.510]  Thank you all again for a wonderful evening and tuning.
[02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:55.910]  We'll let you know on the next couple of weeks
[02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:57.230]  when we'll be doing it,
[02:43:57.230 --> 02:44:00.550]  because we might, we'll probably be in recording
[02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:02.190]  in the middle of a fireside chat
[02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:03.670]  at the Unicorn Cup at that point in time.
[02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:06.310]  But you know, Mr. Trees, if you wanna pop up and say hi,
[02:44:06.310 --> 02:44:09.030]  I'm sure we could find a seat for you at the cup
[02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:10.910]  to come join the conversation.
[02:44:10.910 --> 02:44:11.750]  Hell yeah.
[02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:12.590]  That'd be awesome.
[02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:13.430]  Yeah.
[02:44:13.430 --> 02:44:14.270]  Just saying.
[02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:16.550]  I'm sure there'd be a place.
[02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:17.390]  Mass respect.
[02:44:18.830 --> 02:44:20.070]  No, mass respect, man.
[02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:23.830]  Regenerative stuff and the bringing people together
[02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:26.750]  and the mentioning of respecting the land
[02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:29.710]  and just being aware, you know what I mean?
[02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:30.670]  That's important, man.
[02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:32.070]  So the more people doing that, man,
[02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:34.310]  I'm gonna head off to you on that.
[02:44:34.310 --> 02:44:35.590]  It's good.
[02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:37.630]  Right on, appreciate that.
[02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:40.590]  I hope you can make it up and party with us.
[02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:41.430]  Yeah.
[02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:43.350]  Hell yeah.
[02:44:43.350 --> 02:44:44.190]  We'll do what we gotta do.
[02:44:44.190 --> 02:44:45.670]  It's nice meeting all of you.
[02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:47.430]  Appreciate the chance to chat.
[02:44:47.430 --> 02:44:48.830]  Thanks for the invite, London,
[02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:51.510]  and looking forward to seeing you all again.
[02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:52.350]  Awesome.
[02:44:52.350 --> 02:44:53.190]  Ciao, guys.
[02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:54.030]  And have a wonderful-
[02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.870]  Nice to meet you.
[02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.990]  Broadcast.
[02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.830]  Do, do, do.
[02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:59.070]  The most casual show I have,
[02:44:59.430 --> 02:45:00.750]  there's no graphics at all.
[02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:02.070]  It's just a bunch of-
