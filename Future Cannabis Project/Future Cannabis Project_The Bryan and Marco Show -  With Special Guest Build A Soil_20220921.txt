[00:00.830 --> 00:06.750]  Happy Wednesday to you, Living Soil Nerds. This is another one for the books. Not only
[00:06.750 --> 00:12.030]  do we have a special guest, but behind the scenes, this community has really come together.
[00:12.030 --> 00:17.110]  Obviously, that number above me is what we were able to raise for Heather. What was that?
[00:17.110 --> 00:22.450]  Two weeks ago. In three hours, you guys came together. The community came together, reaching
[00:22.450 --> 00:27.070]  out to a lot of the high-end seed breeders and that kind of stuff, donating the seeds
[00:27.070 --> 00:32.350]  to Heather's cause. I want you guys to know my wife sent her the money, so she has the
[00:32.350 --> 00:37.270]  money. This is the second wave of seeds that are going out. There's four total waves, just
[00:37.270 --> 00:43.590]  to make things easier. Third and fourth waves will be going out soon. Just wanted to keep
[00:43.590 --> 00:48.550]  you guys in check with that stuff. Again, we appreciate that so much from the community,
[00:48.550 --> 00:52.430]  being able to raise that kind of money in three hours. There's not too many platforms
[00:52.430 --> 00:56.930]  where you're able to achieve that kind of stuff. Thank you to Ken. Thank you to Peter
[00:56.970 --> 01:02.730]  for allowing us to have that platform. Again, thank you to Leighton, allowing me to take
[01:02.730 --> 01:09.170]  over that show when he was traveling, so that we could do something good for the community.
[01:09.170 --> 01:14.110]  Another guest that we have, obviously, today, some of you probably, he needs no introduction.
[01:14.110 --> 01:19.430]  This is definitely one of the gentlemen that started the education movement, really putting
[01:19.430 --> 01:24.890]  it out there as far as in the digital space. There was a lot of forum stuff back in the
[01:24.890 --> 01:30.370]  days. I had mentioned that in my post today, man. It was more just kind of like photos,
[01:30.370 --> 01:36.130]  people trying to articulate in text, in written form. A lot of growers, of course, were not
[01:36.130 --> 01:42.650]  the best at even being able to write complete sentences. Sometimes there was a lot of information
[01:42.650 --> 01:48.450]  and sometimes maybe even wisdom that was lost in that translation until YouTube really started
[01:48.450 --> 01:52.810]  to take hold and people were putting time and effort into their YouTube channel, which
[01:52.810 --> 01:57.170]  Mr. Silver has been doing, it seems like, man, for at least a decade. I wanted to give
[01:57.170 --> 02:01.650]  it over to Marco. Marco reached out to Mr. Silver to have him on the show. I know that
[02:01.650 --> 02:07.170]  our audience was stoked to be able to kind of hear you know where you've gone over these
[02:07.170 --> 02:12.930]  past few years. From what I remember, Jeremy, you were kind of just putting stuff together
[02:12.930 --> 02:21.050]  in your home in Colorado there. Montrose, I believe. Escape me there for a second. Out
[02:21.050 --> 02:26.130]  in Montrose, Colorado, putting things together. And then now you have one of the, I would
[02:26.130 --> 02:32.170]  say more of the well-known businesses across the country for really trying to get regenerative
[02:32.170 --> 02:39.970]  farming materials. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Good to see you, Jeremy. Glad we finally made it
[02:39.970 --> 02:47.330]  happen, man. Yeah. Like Brian said, you know, guys, Buildersoil, I don't remember the exact
[02:47.330 --> 02:54.610]  date when you guys came on the scene, but I will say this, before Buildersoil, there
[02:54.610 --> 02:59.250]  was a lot of forums, there was a lot of information out there. It wasn't necessarily good information.
[02:59.250 --> 03:05.090]  You really had to decipher it and search through and pick what was good. And I will say, Jeremy,
[03:05.090 --> 03:09.050]  when you guys came along, you guys became like a trusted source of information. You
[03:09.050 --> 03:14.810]  know what I mean? I felt like what you guys were putting out was quality. And you guys
[03:14.930 --> 03:22.570]  gave a lot. You know what I mean? So I based my soil mix on the Coops mix, which is you
[03:22.570 --> 03:29.130]  guys' kind of collaboration with Clackamas Coops. So, you know, that's kind of one thing
[03:29.130 --> 03:33.290]  that I've taken from you guys from a long time. I kind of made it my own, but I still
[03:33.290 --> 03:40.610]  use that same kind of three-part kind of recipe. But, you know, like Brian said, you know,
[03:40.610 --> 03:44.250]  this show is for everybody. We're talking about, you know, behind the scenes before
[03:44.250 --> 03:48.210]  we got on, you know, we got mostly living soil nerds, but, you know, you got a little
[03:48.210 --> 03:52.130]  bit of everybody in here. And as long as you're growing that cannabis and you're, you know,
[03:52.130 --> 03:56.930]  about the community, we're, you know, we're about you and we're happy to have you in our
[03:56.930 --> 04:01.490]  community. So with that said, you know, Jeremy, I kind of want to give it to you, man. Let
[04:01.490 --> 04:05.770]  you kind of tell the folks a little bit about yourself. I mean, everybody kind of knows
[04:05.770 --> 04:10.690]  you as the brand, but I know a lot of things you've been working on is also the family
[04:10.690 --> 04:15.610]  division of Build the Soil, the family farm. So why don't you kind of just jump in and
[04:15.610 --> 04:17.610]  we'll just get the conversation started, man.
[04:17.610 --> 04:20.850]  All right. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. You hit on a lot of good points. You know, when I
[04:20.850 --> 04:27.130]  first started, it was all forum based and I, along with a lot of my friends, well, a
[04:27.130 --> 04:30.090]  lot of my local friends, it's kind of like any hobby in life. You tell your friends and
[04:30.090 --> 04:35.170]  not everybody gets as excited, but in the forums, everybody was. That was where you
[04:35.170 --> 04:36.170]  really came together.
[04:36.170 --> 04:38.890]  Sorry about this lip.
[04:38.890 --> 04:39.890]  What are you smoking on?
[04:39.890 --> 04:47.330]  A gift from a customer actually. Just dropped it off. He was in here talking about grow
[04:47.330 --> 04:51.050]  lights. He had gotten like a kit online. Was wondering why his buds weren't coming out
[04:51.050 --> 04:55.490]  like as dense as he wanted and good old school grower trying to do indoor. So I sent him
[04:55.490 --> 04:59.210]  home with our power meter and he came back an hour later with a bud and he says, man,
[04:59.210 --> 05:04.330]  it was like 200 PPF. I need to get a whole new light, but here's some herb, some Pakistani
[05:04.330 --> 05:08.450]  that he grew and it tastes kind of hazy, smells a little sweet. It's pretty good.
[05:08.450 --> 05:13.370]  Oh yeah. Good stuff. I got a little gift before I was showing Brian a shout out organic melt.
[05:13.370 --> 05:18.410]  Send us a little something here, but we got started. I love, I love good people, man.
[05:18.410 --> 05:19.770]  I love a good barter, but yeah.
[05:19.770 --> 05:23.890]  A lot of this is sharing, you know, and I think that a lot of us want to get better.
[05:23.890 --> 05:27.890]  I mean, for two reasons, like there's no reason to have every leaf on your plant. Perfect.
[05:27.890 --> 05:32.090]  Other than it's like, you don't want to take a photo with one little burnt tip or any of
[05:32.090 --> 05:36.970]  that stuff. It's really nice to feel like it's just that beauty. And I saw living soil
[05:36.970 --> 05:41.670]  was able to accomplish that. I was on the grow forums. I did a four, like a advanced
[05:41.670 --> 05:46.090]  nutrients versus Lucas formula. I did recirculating deep water culture. I did a whole bunch of
[05:46.090 --> 05:51.650]  stuff, but at the grocery store I was buying organic and it wasn't because I wanted to
[05:51.650 --> 05:55.890]  be cool. It's because I was, I knew like for whatever reason, my, my dad had raised me
[05:55.890 --> 05:59.050]  that they're putting a lot of chemicals and stuff they don't talk about. It's going to
[05:59.050 --> 06:04.450]  be bigger later, but you should just think about it. He had little, I go like when I
[06:04.450 --> 06:08.690]  visited him, my parents were separated. He'd have peppermint, Dr. Bronner's and like a
[06:08.690 --> 06:15.010]  little dropper bottle in the shower and just everything about his lifestyle was a lot more
[06:15.010 --> 06:18.610]  natural. So I had these two sides of me, you know, one is like science is always better.
[06:18.610 --> 06:24.890]  And the other one was like, Hey, you should be careful of a lot of that. And I started
[06:24.890 --> 06:27.850]  questioning why am I buying these bottles that I have to flush and all these different
[06:27.850 --> 06:32.890]  things where I'm buying organic because I don't want the roundup sprayed corn fed to
[06:32.890 --> 06:37.450]  the chickens that have like broken legs and beaks that are tortured to be the vibe. That's
[06:37.450 --> 06:41.850]  what I'm eating. And so I would just choose to opt and buy better food. And I think it's
[06:41.850 --> 06:47.690]  done well. Now I just turned 39. I practiced Jiu Jitsu two, three, four times a week. I'd
[06:47.690 --> 06:51.930]  lift, I have a business and I feel like I'm able to perform. And I attribute a lot of
[06:51.930 --> 06:56.690]  that to decisions I made earlier. And so when I got to that point, I was like, well, how
[06:56.690 --> 07:01.610]  do I grow organic then? That'd be cool. And so at that time, the main thing was super
[07:01.610 --> 07:06.570]  soil. That's what a few people were talking about. It was like accessible and sub cool.
[07:06.570 --> 07:10.730]  Did a really good job at sharing a recipe that you could go to the garden store, home
[07:10.730 --> 07:16.530]  depot and a few spots and probably find all the ingredients. None of them were like specialty
[07:16.530 --> 07:22.650]  from something too rare. And so I tried that and I enjoyed it. And at the same time I was
[07:22.650 --> 07:29.330]  in the living organic soil recycled threads over at IC mag. And it was like a TV show.
[07:29.330 --> 07:32.810]  I mean, it was like micro man, Tim Wilson would be in there talking about compost tea
[07:32.810 --> 07:37.770]  and somebody would talk about silica and all of a sudden Coop would drop in and say, well,
[07:37.770 --> 07:41.370]  you can get the silica that they use in that bottle for cheaper from this company. And
[07:41.370 --> 07:45.650]  everybody started just throwing in all the information that we kind of know today as
[07:45.650 --> 07:50.650]  the model. But one thing's true today as it was back then the model was, Hey, they're
[07:50.650 --> 07:54.770]  selling us bullshit we don't need and they're charging a lot for it. There's a way you don't
[07:54.770 --> 07:59.690]  need to do any of that. The thing that's changed for build the soils. We started off where
[07:59.690 --> 08:03.290]  we didn't even make soil. We only had the ingredients and the customers like, yo, it'd
[08:03.290 --> 08:07.890]  be cool if you could mix that for me. And then we started saying, okay, well no feeds
[08:07.890 --> 08:10.970]  and only the basics. Right. And then people are like, well, I mean, if you're going to
[08:10.970 --> 08:16.010]  get an organic feed, which would be the best one. And I've evolved to, I no longer have
[08:17.010 --> 08:20.210]  eight, 10 hours a day where I'm answering a couple of emails, shipping a few products
[08:20.210 --> 08:25.210]  and literally making ferments and doing compost teas and out there in it. I'm now eight hours
[08:25.210 --> 08:28.690]  a day running a business. And there's a lot of people that depend on me. And I also know
[08:28.690 --> 08:33.050]  that, wow, it's nice to have to come home and see that my big bed of soil is basically
[08:33.050 --> 08:38.050]  on auto, you know, like it's dialed. I'm not having to do a lot. And so I think that a
[08:38.050 --> 08:41.490]  lot of our customer base is connected to that as well. They're maturing. They're like, they're
[08:41.490 --> 08:46.490]  not 18 years old. A lot of them are 20, 25, 30, 35 and older. And they are attracted to
[08:46.490 --> 08:49.850]  this and they go, you know, it'd be cool if this would fit my lifestyle where I wasn't
[08:49.850 --> 08:54.730]  stressed to leave for a weekend, go camping, hang out with my family. And so the build
[08:54.730 --> 08:59.090]  a soil way is just things we've taken from all of those that came before us and we're
[08:59.090 --> 09:04.930]  sharing it in more of a system because all of us from that forum on, none of the answers
[09:04.930 --> 09:08.610]  were there. We just knew it was possible. And everybody was like, Whoa, what happened
[09:08.610 --> 09:11.890]  when you chopped and dropped your mulch? Did you get Nats? Why did this get funky?
[09:11.890 --> 09:15.210]  What happened if you overwatered and everybody would be helping each other with the weird
[09:15.210 --> 09:19.010]  things we'd run into? Like, have you ever seen Roly Poly's eat your plant? What the
[09:19.010 --> 09:23.570]  fuck, you know? And the more of that that happens, the more data that's out there that
[09:23.570 --> 09:29.970]  we all are now pulling together. And it was so prohibition back then that that information
[09:29.970 --> 09:35.170]  was hard to find. And then it was hard to verify if it was right. Now it's easy to verify
[09:35.250 --> 09:40.330]  that this is a method that fully works. There's many ways to do it, but it's not debatable
[09:40.330 --> 09:45.490]  whether it produces good quality. A lot of people really rely on it for that. And so
[09:45.490 --> 09:49.090]  now that now the difference in the future is if I'm brand new and I was going to start
[09:49.090 --> 09:53.330]  growing, it used to be, I'd walk into the hydro store and they'd have a couple of organic
[09:53.330 --> 09:58.050]  products, one or two organic feed lines and a whole bunch of like pH meters and all the
[09:58.050 --> 10:01.970]  other standards. I think the future that we live in now is a lot of people, their first
[10:01.970 --> 10:06.610]  row is no-till. They're starting with it. Like it was always a transition when we first
[10:06.610 --> 10:12.410]  started. You already had to have experience, you know? So it's just been a wild ride. It's
[10:12.410 --> 10:16.450]  crazy to hear you guys mention all that stuff. And I've seen Brian around forever. We've
[10:16.450 --> 10:21.650]  never really talked or done a show, but it's credible in the sense that people have been
[10:21.650 --> 10:25.250]  doing this for a long time, producing good results. Their friends see it. When you see
[10:25.250 --> 10:30.290]  fire herb and it tastes good, a lot of times you ask and they're into soil, you know? But
[10:30.290 --> 10:35.730]  when I first started, I thought soil was the secondary. Like that hydro is probably
[10:35.730 --> 10:40.930]  where it's at. Soil is like, it's tired. You know, it's not as good.
[10:40.930 --> 10:45.410]  People still think that, man. You'd be surprised. Like I know since Virginia went legal, we
[10:45.410 --> 10:50.610]  got some buddies that are now getting into it. And the mindset automatically thinks that
[10:50.610 --> 10:56.730]  hydro is better. I'm like, dude, I've been there, done that. We're past that. Don't even
[10:56.730 --> 11:01.370]  go there. Start here. But if you want to go for it and I guarantee you eventually,
[11:01.370 --> 11:03.050]  you know, turn a living soil.
[11:03.050 --> 11:09.330]  Even from lifestyle, like let's say someone is disciplined. They will learn from the best
[11:09.330 --> 11:15.450]  hydro grower. They get the best cut, the dial, the environment. They got it on point. I mean,
[11:15.450 --> 11:19.730]  the average person that has a job, they're going to fail at least one of those runs.
[11:19.730 --> 11:22.930]  Like it's like driving a hundred miles an hour. And I'm not saying there's not good
[11:22.930 --> 11:29.250]  hydro. I've definitely had some, but I always prefer organic. Just like I said, most of
[11:29.250 --> 11:33.330]  our customers have already decided they buy organic food, they eat organic produce. This
[11:33.330 --> 11:37.090]  is logically how they're going to grow. But as you just mentioned, there are a ton of
[11:37.090 --> 11:40.690]  people that don't care. They'll grow salt, they'll grow organic. There's no emotional
[11:40.690 --> 11:45.090]  connection. They just want that fire. I think we're actually finding that more people that
[11:45.090 --> 11:49.650]  don't care are looking to living soil as the truth for the fire.
[11:49.650 --> 11:54.290]  When you factor in, they probably have a life and a job. What better way could you grow
[11:54.290 --> 11:59.650]  turpy, loud, good herb than by trusting the soil system to do it for you instead of you
[11:59.650 --> 12:03.890]  having to do literally everything from the pH to parts per million? I mean, it gets a
[12:03.890 --> 12:08.450]  lot more sophisticated. I've kind of cooled it off.
[12:08.450 --> 12:12.370]  I wanted to interrupt real quick, Jeremy. We wanted to go down memory lane before we
[12:12.370 --> 12:18.850]  get too lost in kind of the discussion because I wanted to show our audience how far things
[12:18.850 --> 12:24.210]  have come, kind of where things, what the thought process is. Going back and reading
[12:24.210 --> 12:28.370]  some of this stuff to prepare for the show, it's kind of funny, man. There's a lot of
[12:28.370 --> 12:33.970]  nostalgia. There's a lot of you guys kind of laid the bricks for people to build their
[12:33.970 --> 12:39.330]  skyscrapers to this day and a kind of understanding, especially when we get more into when we say
[12:39.330 --> 12:44.610]  trusting the process. This was one of the first posts where I felt like, and Ken, if
[12:44.610 --> 12:49.890]  you could scroll down, you're breaking this stuff down. Nowadays, it's very primitive.
[12:49.890 --> 12:53.250]  I remember when this first came out, man, this was something where I was like, wow,
[12:53.250 --> 12:57.090]  that was the first time I'd ever heard what chitin was. There's so many different little
[12:57.090 --> 13:02.770]  rabbit holes. Again, the Mendo Dope boys were interviewing this dude named Minnesota Nice,
[13:02.770 --> 13:07.970]  and he was talking about growing with cover crop. I was listening to Mitch Sanasa interview.
[13:07.970 --> 13:08.930]  Mitch, yeah.
[13:08.930 --> 13:14.050]  Yeah, yeah. He's interviewed you. He's interviewed Dr. Elaine Engham. I remember
[13:15.330 --> 13:21.410]  him asking a bunch of the, I thought at the time, just mind-blowing questions. You guys
[13:21.410 --> 13:26.690]  were answering those and kind of, I guess to the point to this day, now it's all about the biology.
[13:26.690 --> 13:31.410]  Shout out to Ken. Understanding that it's the microbial world that's allowing some of these
[13:31.410 --> 13:37.650]  newer farmers to find success early. Then it's that same microbial world that's allowing those
[13:37.650 --> 13:43.010]  elite farmers to get the pinks and the blues and some of those unbelievable colors that seemed
[13:43.010 --> 13:48.130]  almost like they were photoshopped until Green Source Gardens and a couple other brands out there
[13:48.130 --> 13:53.250]  just put out stuff where it's like, there's no way that's Photoshopped, man. Those are pink pistols.
[13:53.250 --> 13:58.770]  Especially back then, it was really hard to achieve. Those were kind of the posts that I
[13:58.770 --> 14:04.290]  saw you putting up. Then again, it was more like you were educating, but it wasn't like you were
[14:04.290 --> 14:09.090]  taking credit for it. You were talking about Mr. Clackamas Coot. I don't think maybe enough people
[14:09.090 --> 14:12.770]  know who that is. I was hoping maybe we could kind of briefly talk about his background.
[14:13.330 --> 14:16.690]  Yeah, that'd be awesome. Thanks for bringing it back. In fact, if you go read all those blog
[14:16.690 --> 14:22.370]  posts, sir, as they originally were, I regret that we don't do any media. We just do social
[14:22.370 --> 14:26.450]  media. We've never done any advertising. For about a year, we had a local group that kind of did the
[14:26.450 --> 14:31.170]  retargeting. If you went to our website, they'd pop up a little Google ad saying, with a Build A
[14:31.170 --> 14:37.250]  Soil ad. They were also going to do all this SEO stuff. They changed some of our blog posts and
[14:37.250 --> 14:42.050]  reposted them again, so it would be more current. I didn't like that because I liked knowing when
[14:42.050 --> 14:46.690]  the original date was. The sub cool one was really old, but it got reposted because that
[14:46.690 --> 14:52.930]  marketing company. Either way, there's no conversation on any of them because we get
[14:52.930 --> 14:58.290]  like 50,000 spam posts on every blog that we post, so we basically just shut it off. It's like
[14:58.290 --> 15:04.770]  porn links and just random text, walls of text, some bot. Shopify is terrible at killing it.
[15:04.770 --> 15:09.890]  We just put the conversation elsewhere. If you go through those, there's some really old posts. I
[15:09.890 --> 15:13.970]  was reviewing one today about the life cycle of an organic grower, like how to go to the
[15:13.970 --> 15:19.970]  grow store, get a pH pen, and kind of hear about this. For me at that time, when I found Clackamas
[15:19.970 --> 15:26.850]  Coot, I tried five or six different recipes. Every one was about 30 times more complicated than his.
[15:27.490 --> 15:31.010]  I kind of wrote his off. I was like, ah, it's got a few ingredients. We'll see what happens.
[15:31.570 --> 15:37.250]  It crushed everything. What's really interesting is there's two lessons within that that I only
[15:37.250 --> 15:43.010]  recently kind of picked up on over time reviewing my notes. The rock dust that I used on one of my
[15:43.010 --> 15:48.610]  original Coots recipe was all gypsum, and I didn't know that. It's because of a lack of understanding
[15:48.610 --> 15:53.170]  in the beginning, and it was calcium sulfate. I thought maybe that was rock dust, and that was on
[15:53.170 --> 15:58.050]  Coots list. Well, years later, we've had slow nickel and all these people beating gypsum into
[15:58.050 --> 16:03.490]  our head as far as calcium being so, so important. It's kind of no doubt that that recipe did really,
[16:03.490 --> 16:08.930]  really well. It's also part of how we adapted our Coots recipes in the future from soil testing
[16:08.930 --> 16:14.770]  once we found out a lot of compost was very low calcium and super high potassium and sodium.
[16:15.650 --> 16:20.530]  Not to get too weird, but the Coots mix only doesn't work when the compost is kind of shit.
[16:20.530 --> 16:26.210]  In shit compost, in 33% of the recipe, can really steer things differently compared to premium
[16:26.210 --> 16:31.330]  compost. I think that's why not everybody just took off immediately with it, but most of us got
[16:31.330 --> 16:36.130]  it to work and still love it. It's the fact that one third of it has to be sourced properly.
[16:37.170 --> 16:42.930]  Clackamas Coot, for those of you that don't know, his name is Jim, and he's got an incredible story.
[16:42.930 --> 16:49.410]  But the way that he speaks, the way that he shares information with you is by sometimes beating it,
[16:49.410 --> 16:54.530]  but mostly asking questions and sharing facts and facts that are still hard to Google to this day,
[16:54.530 --> 16:59.970]  that you know he knows from living it and from being in the business. He was part of the BOEL,
[16:59.970 --> 17:05.170]  which was importing some seeds in the Laguna Beach and ended up drugs later on and had kind
[17:05.170 --> 17:11.410]  of a crazy life. Then he owned a tree farm and he's done bread baking and all these things that
[17:11.970 --> 17:16.850]  when you talk to him, you know he has experience and knowledge. From bread baking, he was thinking
[17:16.850 --> 17:22.450]  about the biology of the yeast and how it made the bread and ate the food. He really created
[17:22.450 --> 17:27.570]  the sprouted seed tea from that. He created the Clackamas Coots recipe, which I'll get into,
[17:27.650 --> 17:32.930]  and that's his base soil recipe. When I made these five, six different recipes,
[17:32.930 --> 17:38.530]  a lot of them had a laundry list like super soil, and most of them did not perform nearly as well.
[17:39.090 --> 17:42.210]  That's why when I started Build a Soil, I thought, well, we've got to include this.
[17:42.930 --> 17:48.530]  In the beginning, I just got his blessing to do so. After about a decade now, reluctantly,
[17:48.530 --> 17:55.010]  he decided he accepted a royalty basically. Now, if it has his name on it, we give him a royalty.
[17:55.010 --> 18:00.530]  He's helped us in so many ways, just researching stuff for me that I was thinking about and
[18:00.530 --> 18:05.090]  answering questions or telling me something stupid. He's become kind of like part of my family.
[18:06.690 --> 18:10.850]  Really, I think other people feel that way, not just me. He'll have hour-long conversations with
[18:10.850 --> 18:18.610]  a random person. It's just been an epic story. If you go back, there's also a couple other
[18:18.610 --> 18:23.410]  monikers that he went under besides Clackamas Coot, but that's probably the biggest one.
[18:23.410 --> 18:27.730]  If you Google that, you'll find lots of old forum posts, lots of discussion about him.
[18:28.290 --> 18:34.930]  The base recipe was so simple, three parts. One part, Canadian sphagnum peat moss.
[18:35.650 --> 18:40.210]  At the time, you got to understand, cocoa was taking off, coconut corn. People were having
[18:40.210 --> 18:44.610]  special nutrient lines for feeding in cocoa, getting huge yields in hydro and cocoa.
[18:44.610 --> 18:47.970]  A lot of people were like, whoa, I'm out. Why cocoa? I want to be peat-free.
[18:47.970 --> 18:52.290]  He educated us that peat moss in Canada was very different than peat moss
[18:52.290 --> 18:57.250]  overseas where they burned it for fuel and it was a very limited capacity,
[18:57.250 --> 18:59.730]  where here there was an abundance and it was very well managed.
[19:01.090 --> 19:07.010]  Both educating why and sharing the recipe, he got a lot of us to make it. The one-third
[19:07.010 --> 19:13.570]  Canadian peat moss, one-third aeration, one-third compost. Coot's preference was for that compost to
[19:13.570 --> 19:19.890]  be worm castings or vermicompost that he made himself. He made that using dynamic accumulators.
[19:19.970 --> 19:26.610]  We're talking comfrey and other really powerful plants that if you research, dynamic accumulators
[19:26.610 --> 19:32.770]  or permaculture, a lot of the special plants they talk about, he used those in the worm bin.
[19:33.570 --> 19:38.770]  Then those finished composts, if you hear three parts, that means that your recipe is 33%
[19:39.490 --> 19:44.210]  premium compost. The other difference was that he would work through his vermicompost,
[19:44.210 --> 19:49.730]  the worms would break it down, neem cake, kelp meal and crustacean meal and rock dust.
[19:52.370 --> 19:56.530]  That meant that when he mixed his soil, it was already preconditioned by the worms to be very,
[19:56.530 --> 20:03.090]  very gentle and active. Most of us that copied him didn't do the vermicompost. We would buy a bag of
[20:03.090 --> 20:08.450]  worm castings, we would mix the kelp, the neem and the crustacean into the soil and we would let it
[20:08.770 --> 20:15.410]  cook or come together and get microbially active and the perfect moisture. Then we would carefully
[20:15.410 --> 20:20.290]  put that into our bins and start growing. It worked better than anything I'd ever done before,
[20:20.290 --> 20:25.330]  to the point where it fulfilled that creative need. When I grew a plant and I was following
[20:25.330 --> 20:29.730]  a nutrient growth chart and I popped 50 seeds or 10 seeds or whatever it was,
[20:30.770 --> 20:34.370]  some of them would have burnt tips, some of them would be perfect, some would have a little claw.
[20:35.090 --> 20:39.490]  And it's probably because I wasn't the best at growing at that point, but I also realized that
[20:40.050 --> 20:44.050]  I would be all of a sudden, this one's bigger and mixing a different dilution of that nutrient,
[20:44.050 --> 20:49.410]  this one's smaller and trying not to fuck. When I had the coots, everything bigger or smaller was
[20:49.410 --> 20:55.650]  perfectly happy. And so it kind of clicked and that began all of the research and a lot of active
[20:55.650 --> 21:02.130]  communication on the internet. At the same time, soil testing became a thing. So what did we do?
[21:02.210 --> 21:06.530]  Take the coots mix, send it to the lab. Let's find out if this matches any of what they're saying.
[21:07.250 --> 21:11.410]  And for the most part it did. There's been some improvements from that knowledge that can be made
[21:11.410 --> 21:15.970]  a lot of times due to the compost. But I mean, that's really the story in a nutshell. We could
[21:15.970 --> 21:20.530]  talk for hours about what he's done, but I wanted to give your viewers kind of that base that he had
[21:20.530 --> 21:29.490]  this special soil recipe. And he's very brash sometimes with his opinions. So especially on
[21:29.490 --> 21:34.130]  the forums, he would talk about Neem and there was just kind of always this, it felt like,
[21:34.130 --> 21:39.970]  especially a long time ago, PlayStation versus Nintendo, it was just people were on one side,
[21:39.970 --> 21:43.890]  one people on the other, and they weren't going to come to any real conclusions there.
[21:44.530 --> 21:50.770]  So I always kind of thought that was interesting. I remember Blue Jay Mountain Organics. There were
[21:50.770 --> 21:54.930]  just some of those individuals that were out there that were putting out quality information.
[21:54.930 --> 22:00.370]  So how did you know, especially, it said 2013, some of those older blog posts.
[22:01.170 --> 22:06.450]  I remember seeing you probably even before that, even at some of the expos and I was trying to
[22:06.450 --> 22:12.050]  get out of the illegal world and come into the legal world. And unfortunately for that, I've
[22:12.050 --> 22:17.330]  always joked with friends of mine that I got drafted by the Cleveland Browns and I was kind
[22:17.330 --> 22:24.610]  of shown that the dirty side of what legal commercial business is. And I was amazed that
[22:24.610 --> 22:33.010]  there's no real respect in that world. There's no honor. That was kind of maybe one of the reasons
[22:33.010 --> 22:39.890]  why Marco and I decided to kind of do this show is that those things used to be what were ways that
[22:39.890 --> 22:45.090]  individuals would make money for themselves. Your word was your bond. If I said I was going to show
[22:45.090 --> 22:50.850]  up at a certain time, I was there, I was prompt. So it seemed like, especially in those early days,
[22:51.570 --> 22:55.970]  you were able to kind of put your nose to the grind, keep your head down, not get involved
[22:55.970 --> 23:00.850]  with all that kind of stuff and just kind of reap the rewards by kind of just staying in your lane.
[23:00.850 --> 23:06.690]  So I wanted to kind of just point out that, man, because it seemed like education is the key for
[23:06.690 --> 23:12.450]  almost any industry that you're getting into. And you saw that extremely early on compared to some
[23:12.450 --> 23:18.530]  of the quote unquote big dogs here in Colorado. Well, I appreciate that. And I think that a lot
[23:18.530 --> 23:25.730]  of it was luck in the sense that Build a Soil was the only thing I've ever done that I didn't
[23:25.730 --> 23:31.010]  start because of money. Like I wanted to at least make it pay for itself and probably produce a
[23:31.010 --> 23:38.130]  lifestyle, but I didn't have a timeline associated with that. I was single, had no bills, enjoyed
[23:38.130 --> 23:42.770]  growing the plant. And it was like, wow, I'm in a small town and this actually connects me to a
[23:42.770 --> 23:49.090]  community of people that thank me for what I do. And that was new. It was a blessing. And so when
[23:49.090 --> 23:56.130]  it came to the education part, that was just how this started is I would buy a lot of product
[23:56.130 --> 24:01.490]  almost out of my own desire to try new things. And you'd have to buy a 50 pound bag or a 2000
[24:01.490 --> 24:04.850]  pound bag. And then I had a local landscaper that was like, well, I'll buy a pallet if you can move
[24:04.850 --> 24:09.090]  a few of them and you'll buy it over time. And so I'd be answering people's questions just on
[24:09.090 --> 24:14.050]  Facebook or in the forums, hanging out, looking at pictures, learning myself. And eventually those
[24:14.050 --> 24:21.570]  people started buying from me. And so it came to me that the philosophical thought behind that was
[24:21.570 --> 24:29.330]  what I call the law of reciprocity. If you give to others, then that'll come back around. And not in a
[24:29.330 --> 24:33.570]  way where you're just walking around giving all your money so you're broke, but I mean giving of
[24:33.570 --> 24:37.570]  things that you can do because you have experience making a difference in people's lives and they
[24:37.570 --> 24:42.770]  remember you for that. And so that our model has always been very soft on the sales side. We just
[24:42.770 --> 24:49.090]  share on social media. And as of lately, we're getting better at that, but it is because we're
[24:49.090 --> 24:52.770]  doing the education. I think that we do get the business. I'm not foolish enough to think that
[24:52.770 --> 24:57.650]  we're better at marketing or have a cooler label or any of that stuff. The challenge is we've always
[24:57.650 --> 25:02.530]  had good ingredients and good quality products that we put a lot of work into sourcing.
[25:02.530 --> 25:06.130]  That doesn't mean much because in the organic world, you can call anything the best organic,
[25:06.130 --> 25:10.690]  whatever. There's not a lot of data and without education, people would just buy from anywhere and
[25:10.690 --> 25:15.970]  that's totally fine. But we've seen this magic happen where when you help people provide the
[25:15.970 --> 25:20.690]  information, it just fully completes the circle. And a lot of them will do business with you,
[25:20.690 --> 25:25.090]  despite something being a couple bucks cheaper elsewhere. And I learned in business that just
[25:25.090 --> 25:28.930]  offering the lowest price product is a sure way to get to the bottom. There's always somebody
[25:28.930 --> 25:33.250]  that'll find some investor that buys their way to the business, cuts everybody's prices,
[25:33.250 --> 25:38.690]  and they've got big pockets and they'll fuck everybody over. I'd rather charge more and do
[25:38.690 --> 25:42.690]  a little less business and at least be able to build a customer service department that literally
[25:42.690 --> 25:48.690]  has humans in it that'll answer your question in an emergency or not all the time. When I first
[25:48.690 --> 25:52.370]  started, the only people doing that was advanced nutrients. And I'm like, what am I going to call
[25:52.370 --> 26:00.850]  them for? They had the hotline. But growing needs that. You have to be able to help. So it's just
[26:00.850 --> 26:06.530]  been part of our process, I think, since day one. Yeah, that's a great strategy, man. And that's one
[26:06.530 --> 26:10.850]  of the things I really like about you guys. We always say that give a little, take a little,
[26:10.850 --> 26:16.850]  give a little more. Bob Marley said it. It's always said, when you do good, you will do well
[26:16.850 --> 26:23.170]  later. And I think it's key through the gold bar up when you said it, because you started this
[26:23.170 --> 26:28.610]  business not for profit. And for me, that's when the most passion comes out. And that's when some
[26:28.610 --> 26:35.570]  of the best businesses are born to me. Obviously, we're in business. We have to make money. That's
[26:36.370 --> 26:41.970]  a given. But the education piece that you give extra to me is something you don't have to do.
[26:42.530 --> 26:48.370]  But people will bond to that. They'll take that. Now they're your people. Now they're
[26:48.370 --> 26:54.930]  rocking Build-A-Soil. So I think that's a great strategy. Yep. We did it on accident. It's a style.
[26:54.930 --> 26:59.090]  People build marketing funnels by giving you the best free information you've ever had,
[26:59.090 --> 27:05.730]  and then asking you to buy something. We didn't know that. We just did it. And so we still don't
[27:05.730 --> 27:11.810]  do it. In fact, I'm trying to right now create a way where I can ensure how many new customers
[27:11.810 --> 27:16.450]  might see Build-A-Soil each month. Because we have 50 employees, and I want to make sure they all
[27:16.450 --> 27:22.370]  have hours. So that it's changed. And not saying changing because it's for profit, but I've
[27:22.370 --> 27:26.210]  realized, wow, if you don't pay attention to profit, you don't make any. Holy crap. We've
[27:27.330 --> 27:31.250]  had years where we did really good top line number and have nothing to show for it at the end of the
[27:31.250 --> 27:36.850]  year. And that's because I started this in my garage, and I'm not some CEO from college.
[27:37.490 --> 27:42.690]  But just like in the garden, I've read 100 books on the subject. I've involved people in my life.
[27:42.690 --> 27:47.330]  I've stepped up the discipline that the garden has taught me, and we're learning how to do it.
[27:47.330 --> 27:52.850]  And so now I can look at our goal with our employees is to now say, well, since we know
[27:52.850 --> 27:56.930]  the profit's a thing, and maybe we can actually track and measure it by doing a good job. And
[27:56.930 --> 28:00.530]  our customers say, you are doing a good job, and you didn't blow my shipment. And yes, I'll come
[28:00.530 --> 28:05.330]  back, and we can keep that profit. We want to share it with our employees. It's really hard to
[28:05.330 --> 28:08.930]  do if you don't have any or don't know how to track it. And so all of a sudden, the garden's
[28:08.930 --> 28:13.730]  teaching me, wow, you better manage every detail and be disciplined. Business is teaching, well,
[28:13.730 --> 28:18.370]  you better think clearly, manage every detail, and be disciplined. And it's gotten us through
[28:18.370 --> 28:23.810]  corona, healthy, happy business doing well. It's gotten us through a lot of crazy shit in the last
[28:23.810 --> 28:31.090]  decade. And so I think this way, this living soil way, it's a lifestyle, and it affects more areas
[28:31.090 --> 28:37.650]  of your life that give you better results. That's also why I do jujitsu. It's hard stuff. It's not
[28:37.650 --> 28:44.130]  easy, but I'm psychologically rewarded for that. And I feel more confident because of that. And I
[28:44.130 --> 28:48.930]  think anybody that grows, they tap into that right away. They're not just like, yo, bro, you got any
[28:48.930 --> 28:54.690]  weed? It's like, they got plenty. They're the producer, not the consumer. It's a total paradigm
[28:54.690 --> 29:02.370]  shift. So- I think, man, if you got 50 employees, I think a great book, a read for you, I'd suggest
[29:02.370 --> 29:09.010]  The Great Game of Business. I haven't heard of it. I'm surprised right now. All right.
[29:09.010 --> 29:14.690]  Well, I know this is a different one. So I'm with a company that's an ESOP, which is employee-owned.
[29:14.690 --> 29:18.690]  They sold the business to us. So I would like to do ESOP, but we're going to do profit sharing
[29:18.690 --> 29:22.930]  because it's shorter-sighted for like this year instead of all the steps to do the long-term.
[29:22.930 --> 29:27.890]  And I'm not planning on selling. So the liquidity event one day is not like a real carrot, but-
[29:27.890 --> 29:29.650]  Correct. Oh, this is great.
[29:29.650 --> 29:36.530]  But what it'll do though, man, is what it does is it creates a game out of your business. The
[29:36.530 --> 29:41.730]  employees buy into it. And what you do is have weekly meetings. Once you read it, you'll
[29:41.730 --> 29:47.970]  understand, but you'll set parameters and goals for your team. And now when you meet each week,
[29:47.970 --> 29:51.010]  you guys are looking at these goals as targets and there's-
[29:51.010 --> 29:51.730]  Yeah.
[29:51.730 --> 29:53.090]  And you're basing ratings-
[29:53.090 --> 29:56.450]  Part of that, did they talk about the EOS system, Entrepreneurial Operating System?
[29:57.490 --> 29:58.770]  That is in there, yes.
[29:59.490 --> 30:04.370]  A lot of the ones are built on that. We use that system here now. We have our own model,
[30:04.370 --> 30:09.250]  but we have a weekly meeting pulse. We have a scorecard of metrics and we're building the game.
[30:09.810 --> 30:13.570]  We did in our shipping facility, we actually had a game where you could increase your pay
[30:13.570 --> 30:18.210]  every two weeks if you hit above average metrics. It turned into a little bit of like a little too
[30:18.210 --> 30:23.170]  harsh, I think. We had to kind of pull it back and readjust, but this is up my alley. So I pulled
[30:23.170 --> 30:25.810]  it up. I'm going to buy it and I'll let you know what I think of it. I appreciate it.
[30:25.890 --> 30:30.770]  Check it out. People will buy into it. And what you do is we do quarterly bonuses and it's based
[30:30.770 --> 30:33.890]  on this mark, these numbers that we hit one through 10.
[30:33.890 --> 30:37.410]  That's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do quarterly so that it's timely enough to make
[30:37.410 --> 30:38.770]  a difference in their lives.
[30:38.770 --> 30:40.930]  Exactly. And yeah, if you want to talk about-
[30:40.930 --> 30:44.530]  This is weird. I'm getting the chills only because literally this is all we're trying
[30:44.530 --> 30:49.090]  to implement right now. And it's so serendipitous that someone, I wouldn't expect to have something
[30:49.090 --> 30:52.850]  outside of gardening for me, just dropping bombs. So I'm going to grab that.
[30:52.850 --> 30:57.170]  Thank you. Good deal. Yeah, you'll love it, man. Because just like a lot of us, man, we're all
[30:57.170 --> 31:02.290]  into different things. A lot of people have little family businesses. A lot of people can benefit
[31:02.290 --> 31:07.810]  from just hearing different tips and tactics and tricks that even big companies use. So
[31:08.850 --> 31:14.210]  ultimately, like Brian always says, and everyone says a happy employee, he's going to do more for
[31:14.210 --> 31:16.530]  you. He's going to run through that wall for you.
[31:16.530 --> 31:20.210]  It's like no-till. You don't want to just throw them out each time. You want them to keep around
[31:20.210 --> 31:21.250]  forever to get better.
[31:22.050 --> 31:22.550]  Yeah.
[31:23.650 --> 31:24.210]  Definitely.
[31:24.210 --> 31:24.530]  Sure.
[31:26.050 --> 31:31.490]  Well, there's something to be said when you have employees that give a shit. One of the early ones
[31:31.490 --> 31:37.490]  is a gentleman that you got his shirt on, somebody that I've admired for a long time, AJ. When Leighton
[31:37.490 --> 31:42.930]  and I first got onto this, I reached out to him. He was one of our first guests. But I thought he
[31:42.930 --> 31:48.130]  was another one, man. I remember calling and he would literally answer the phone and stuff. This
[31:48.130 --> 31:52.050]  was when things have been growing for you a little bit, but you still kept that.
[31:53.250 --> 31:57.490]  So lucky. The universe just landed him here, bro. It was crazy. I was like, bro,
[31:57.490 --> 31:58.450]  you grow better than I do.
[31:59.890 --> 32:07.810]  Well, that was kind of the... Your world is kind of almost... There's this book that I love. I love
[32:07.810 --> 32:12.130]  if we're talking about sharing all that kind of stuff. Malcolm Gladwell, he's written two books
[32:12.130 --> 32:17.730]  that I think are fabulous reads, Blink and Outlier. It seems like for you, the outlier moment
[32:17.890 --> 32:25.570]  is the fact that you're close with Kevin. You got Duke. You have AJ. You have all those probably
[32:25.570 --> 32:29.490]  individuals and mantras that would never want to be on social media. You never heard their names,
[32:29.490 --> 32:35.010]  mountain type individuals. All of those type individuals seem to have kind of been in your
[32:35.730 --> 32:39.410]  universe there for a while. I think those are also when you're talking about maybe also getting
[32:39.410 --> 32:44.050]  lucky. It seems like you just had a lot of people that are still to this day considered
[32:44.850 --> 32:50.690]  sound, brilliant-minded individuals that helped kind of guide this industry,
[32:50.690 --> 32:58.690]  moving away from the kind of bullshit, hydro kind of movement to understanding that the microbial
[32:58.690 --> 33:06.530]  world seemed to be the future, especially in 2012, 2013. Some of that almost seemed like those were
[33:06.530 --> 33:11.170]  fish stories because you couldn't really reuse your soil. Some individuals that were trying to
[33:11.170 --> 33:16.050]  do that were using sub-cools mix and trying to reuse that. It would run out of gas and everybody
[33:16.050 --> 33:21.250]  would make fun of it and be like, yo, regenerative farming isn't an indoor thing. A lot of
[33:21.250 --> 33:27.650]  misconceptions even that I feel like your little crew in individuals outside of Colorado and now,
[33:27.650 --> 33:33.570]  thankfully, from Peter and other podcasts and everybody that's putting out content, it's now
[33:33.570 --> 33:37.410]  of a more international thing where people are really starting to think like you had mentioned
[33:37.410 --> 33:43.570]  at the beginning, Jeremy, how do I want to farm from day one? This process is obviously
[33:43.570 --> 33:49.730]  appealing to most when their goal is terpenes, flavor, profiles, cannabinoid profiles, all that
[33:49.730 --> 33:55.170]  kind of stuff. Yeah, a lot of the elicitation, a lot of the tricks that you have to use in hydro,
[33:55.890 --> 33:59.650]  they're just like part of the out-of-the-box product when you start with soil.
[34:00.610 --> 34:04.290]  When you're in water, you're like, oh, I need to trick them into being stressed to get terps.
[34:04.370 --> 34:08.050]  You're like, well, in soil, they just have to work for it. It's good. They're not on an IV.
[34:08.050 --> 34:14.210]  They get muscle. They walk around. I mean, not really, but I just, I like to personify when I
[34:14.210 --> 34:19.090]  talk and kind of compare. And I always thought that hydro is like, yo, put it in here or give
[34:19.090 --> 34:23.410]  me a food pill. I'm like, that can't be good. I mean, I get that they could probably scientifically
[34:23.410 --> 34:27.970]  get it right. Someone could even do an advertisement and say, look, just drink this one shake
[34:27.970 --> 34:32.130]  one time per day. We'll guarantee you live to a hundred years old. It's nature's perfect solution.
[34:32.130 --> 34:37.890]  I'm like, there is no perfect diet. There's just, we're all going to die. There's just a matter of
[34:37.890 --> 34:42.290]  what makes you feel good and what is good for the environment and what is makes sense. And
[34:42.930 --> 34:49.730]  so, so much of that comes back over to the farming side. And I also realized too, that a lot of the
[34:49.730 --> 34:53.650]  ingredients we all buy, although they're at the growth shop down the street, they're all coming
[34:53.650 --> 34:57.410]  in the same ports and being shipped all around our country. And so if I could reduce that,
[34:57.410 --> 35:01.250]  get them in one place, do some of the mixing here or palletize and move back out,
[35:01.890 --> 35:06.610]  it did make some sense. And so unfortunately from other books, if we're sharing stuff,
[35:06.610 --> 35:10.690]  I was reading the Patagonia and some of the others. He has a lot of good business books
[35:10.690 --> 35:15.890]  that are more on the, like the new age side, I would say, where they're trying to make a positive
[35:15.890 --> 35:19.810]  impact and all these things that weren't part of the original metrics for a business besides just
[35:19.810 --> 35:25.490]  profit. And he talks about in there how you're in business. So you're basically screwed at that
[35:25.490 --> 35:28.930]  point. You're messing up the environment. Now that the goal is not to ignore that, but to get
[35:28.930 --> 35:33.170]  better every day. Now we're seeing like carbon neutral beer companies. And like, there are
[35:33.170 --> 35:40.290]  actually people that are fully going all the way. And I think that it's all evolving and I'm just
[35:40.290 --> 35:44.530]  happy to have been on the early part of the wave, if that makes any sense. I do feel like I just got
[35:44.530 --> 35:49.250]  lucky in that timing, lucky in the people that showed up in my life. And I don't think it was
[35:49.250 --> 35:54.450]  because I was anybody special. I just think that Build a Soul became a magnet because there wasn't
[35:54.450 --> 35:58.690]  a lot of areas where you could go to learn about this. And I had a couple of people move here to
[35:58.690 --> 36:04.450]  this town. A couple of people that reached out and really Kevin from Rootwise. I mean, the fact
[36:04.450 --> 36:10.370]  that he was in Paonia and a legend and that we got along and thought similarly. I can look back at so
[36:10.370 --> 36:15.810]  many little instances that just changed everything. And although it feels lucky, I also see so much of
[36:15.810 --> 36:20.690]  it happening, but I feel like maybe as I get older, some of the stuff that they tell us is true,
[36:21.010 --> 36:28.050]  like follow through, be good and have positivity and all those things, they make a fucking
[36:28.050 --> 36:32.290]  difference. I feel like a lot of our customers feel the same way. That's why they get into living
[36:32.290 --> 36:35.810]  soil. They do believe that it will make a difference. And I got to tell you, when I was
[36:35.810 --> 36:42.770]  growing up, more educated person typically would say organics bullshit. And even I've heard things
[36:42.770 --> 36:46.450]  like, well, the banana peel is so thick that the poisons don't get in there. Who cares? And I'm
[36:46.450 --> 36:53.490]  like, the whole tree is made from it. What are you talking about? And so I feel like now that
[36:53.490 --> 37:00.050]  you see Roundup on the infomercials for causing cancer and you're actually seeing the fruition
[37:00.050 --> 37:05.730]  of what is the craziness that was the 80s, 90s. I mean, every chemical you can imagine was just
[37:06.530 --> 37:10.290]  chemicals are better. We're finally, I think out of that. So.
[37:10.930 --> 37:16.530]  You know, man, and just to just to piggyback on that, we got the wife, one of our clients
[37:16.530 --> 37:20.850]  bought her some cookies, right? So I look at the cookies, flip them over, look at the ingredients,
[37:21.410 --> 37:29.010]  says this product contains bioengineered plant food or something, something like that. I'm like,
[37:29.010 --> 37:34.370]  what the where are we going to, man? Like now I got to go look up what are they talking about
[37:34.370 --> 37:39.170]  in this product? You know what I mean? It's crazy, man. Just another reason to,
[37:39.970 --> 37:45.010]  like we always say, man, try to focus on growing as much as you can of your own food,
[37:45.650 --> 37:49.810]  closing your own loops, man. And. But see, you mentioned reading ingredients.
[37:50.930 --> 37:56.050]  That's something you can do when you get food savvy. And right away, I remember like when
[37:56.050 --> 37:59.730]  you're brand new at reading a food label, like let's say you just were raised in a family that
[37:59.730 --> 38:03.970]  ate whatever was the cheapest, you know, at the grocery store and you're starting to question it.
[38:04.770 --> 38:10.210]  Typically you start with, if I can read the word and I know what it is, I'm probably safe. And then
[38:10.210 --> 38:14.050]  eventually you're like, oh, that's just processed version of this. That's not good. And you really
[38:14.050 --> 38:19.810]  kind of start to get picky and choosy. Um, edamame is soy. Soy is the most GMO spread crop. Like you
[38:19.810 --> 38:25.890]  start to figure things out, but in soil that, I mean, nobody knows what the ingredients are.
[38:25.890 --> 38:30.130]  And so as it came to be that I just know them all because it's part of my life, I kind of take it
[38:30.130 --> 38:33.650]  for granted that I can just read a label, but still to this day, a lot of customers go, Hey,
[38:33.650 --> 38:38.850]  is this good? And I'm like, Whoa, there's a lot of chemicals in there. And then the organic inputs
[38:38.850 --> 38:44.530]  that they're advertising on the front that I read are cotton, most GMO roundup, pesticide spread,
[38:44.530 --> 38:49.650]  probably sprayed at harvest crop, soy, corn, like all the things that you're like, well, yeah,
[38:49.650 --> 38:54.610]  they're just buying the cheapest per penny product that has nothing to do with organics.
[38:55.170 --> 38:59.730]  But when they repackage it as an organic fertilizer, it's not that the fertilizer is
[38:59.730 --> 39:05.090]  organic. It's that it's approved for organic use because it's a waste product. And so all
[39:05.090 --> 39:09.010]  of a sudden you start comparing label reading and food that you eat to label reading and food
[39:09.010 --> 39:14.530]  that your plants eat. And it becomes a real thing. And there's businesses that are huge beating
[39:14.530 --> 39:20.050]  Amazon at pet supply stuff. And a lot of their products are, Hey, is the first ingredient real
[39:20.050 --> 39:25.170]  meat or is it not? Um, and I think that's going to evolve too, but people are starting to care
[39:25.250 --> 39:29.410]  and every little facet, cause they realize we've been lied to it for a long time.
[39:29.410 --> 39:31.650]  I mean, even in my pet's food, you know,
[39:33.650 --> 39:38.610]  I'm actually trying a new food, which is probably no better, but, um, it doesn't have a lot of the,
[39:38.610 --> 39:45.010]  it doesn't have any meat, which is strange to me. Uh, but there are models basically saying,
[39:45.010 --> 39:48.210]  look at if you're looking for premium meat is the first ingredient. All that's going to do is have
[39:48.210 --> 39:53.330]  just warehouses full of chicken, chicken that are treated like shit that are GMO sprayed. I mean,
[39:53.330 --> 39:57.250]  it's not even near as good as the food industry and that's going into the dog food. And a lot of
[39:57.250 --> 40:01.570]  us that care about our animals, there's all these commercials for buying super expensive, like
[40:01.570 --> 40:07.010]  pre-made food for your dog. Nowadays, I believe it's a sign that we are all Karen. And of course,
[40:07.010 --> 40:11.810]  nobody wants to spend a thousand dollars a month on dog food. So if somebody finds a way to do it,
[40:11.810 --> 40:16.450]  that is clean and cost-effective, they're going to win. And I think living soil is, you can read
[40:16.450 --> 40:20.930]  the label it's clean and cost-effective. It makes fucking sense. And so the more people that find
[40:20.930 --> 40:26.370]  out about it, it's going to stick. It is part of our generations. I think identity in that we're
[40:26.370 --> 40:31.330]  like, eh, a lot of that was not good. We're seeing what our parents and grandparents are going through
[40:31.330 --> 40:35.650]  with cancer and sickness. And we're hoping that we're going to avoid a lot of that. And I think
[40:36.370 --> 40:39.890]  Corona even brought a lot more of that to the forefront, you know, it divided a lot of us and
[40:39.890 --> 40:45.730]  a lot of us really stay true to making sure we just stay healthy, you know, as opposed to just
[40:45.730 --> 40:51.010]  trying to dive down and getting really scared. So, yeah, when you're talking about reading labels,
[40:51.010 --> 40:55.010]  when it says chicken by-product, that means that the beaks and the feet and all that shit were
[40:55.010 --> 41:00.530]  grinded up with it. So yeah, that's a lot to learn. Yep. Feathermeal, right. And it's cheap
[41:00.530 --> 41:04.130]  for organic production on acreage. But when you have four plants, there's no reason to use
[41:04.130 --> 41:09.810]  feathermeal. There's just no organic feathermeal on the market. There isn't. And many companies
[41:09.810 --> 41:14.210]  that are living soil companies that are reputable will put feathermeal in there because their
[41:14.290 --> 41:18.130]  scientist tells them they need the nitrogen. I'm like, bro, if you have biology, it's going to
[41:18.130 --> 41:23.250]  release. All of our soils have like no nitrogen. And people are like, bro, there's too much nitrogen.
[41:23.250 --> 41:28.130]  I'm like, no, there's none. Test it. That's why we like amino acids. That's why we like biology
[41:28.130 --> 41:34.850]  that releases the organic matter into nitrogen. But it is very interesting to start reading labels.
[41:35.570 --> 41:39.890]  And the problem is there's the burden of knowledge. So back in the day, you start reading labels. What
[41:39.890 --> 41:44.450]  are you going to do? All they have is the same shit for your plants. Well, now there's a lot that
[41:44.450 --> 41:48.930]  you can do. And when it comes back to the JADAM, what better label is that? You grew the freaking
[41:48.930 --> 41:53.410]  product and you can take the stuff that's not edible or is a waste and you can ferment it
[41:53.410 --> 41:58.050]  yourself. And now there's not even a label to be discussed. So there's always levels to it.
[41:58.690 --> 42:04.450]  Build a soil early on. I realized maybe 5, 10% of people want to do all the DIY. The rest just want
[42:04.450 --> 42:09.890]  it done. But really where the getting it done part starts is all the DIYers. We figure out the
[42:09.890 --> 42:14.050]  stuff that should be and what would work. And then eventually people get it hot off the press.
[42:15.890 --> 42:19.810]  Well, that was kind of like your craft blend. That was something that it seemed like when it
[42:19.810 --> 42:24.690]  came on the market, when you're saying like maybe people were trying things and weren't having
[42:24.690 --> 42:30.210]  success. That was the whispers, at least here in Denver, what are you using? Oh, this company's
[42:30.210 --> 42:36.610]  craft blend. So do you mind kind of talking about why that was successful and how balanced it was?
[42:36.610 --> 42:42.210]  Yeah. That's another strange story. In fact, we're the anti-business business and I laugh
[42:42.210 --> 42:46.930]  and I'm embarrassed sometimes, but that label to this day is not even printed on a bag yet. It's
[42:46.930 --> 42:51.250]  like that. But our label is beautiful and we're about to print it. But by the time we designed
[42:51.250 --> 42:55.250]  this label, we decided to register it in all 50 states, do heavy metal testing, everything across
[42:55.250 --> 42:59.650]  the board. Craft blend had a little bit of heavy metals because some of the minerals in it. So we
[42:59.650 --> 43:03.010]  cleaned it up. We made it so it's the best it's ever been from all the knowledge that came from
[43:03.010 --> 43:07.970]  commercial grows and since then. But when we first started that, there was a lot of people throwing
[43:07.970 --> 43:13.730]  the whole kitchen sink into their grow. And I had a buddy whose last name's craft. That's what it's
[43:13.730 --> 43:18.610]  named after. He was like, man, I love this. And I literally, I bought product from Tad to keep
[43:18.610 --> 43:23.410]  it simple because I didn't have everything for him and I just wanted to get started. And I remember
[43:23.410 --> 43:27.970]  it came two boxes, like one the first week, one two weeks later. And so he had already mixed the
[43:27.970 --> 43:32.770]  soil and then another box came. He was like, Oh fuck. So we mixed it again. Well at that point,
[43:32.770 --> 43:36.610]  he kept on coming to the shop. This is years later with the same soil. He'd be adding other stuff to
[43:36.610 --> 43:41.330]  it. He's like, man, I hate having to buy all these 50 pound bags. Can you just mix it all together
[43:41.330 --> 43:45.010]  for me so I can just take it home? And I'm like, you don't get it, bro. You need a soil test. You
[43:45.010 --> 43:49.170]  can't just mix anything together like that. And so he encouraged me to do it. And so I thought,
[43:49.170 --> 43:53.490]  well, if I am going to do this, how would I do it right? And so I added up all my favorite
[43:53.490 --> 43:59.250]  ingredients that if used in only one 15th of that ingredient, it was 15 of them probably
[43:59.250 --> 44:05.010]  wouldn't cause an overuse situation, but it would be diverse. And we put a good portion of that in
[44:05.010 --> 44:09.410]  diverse minerals so that even if you added a few cups, a lot of that was minerals, it wasn't going
[44:09.410 --> 44:14.370]  to burn anything. And then we put in like a malted seed, which, you know, sprouted seeds were new.
[44:14.370 --> 44:18.530]  That's what Coop was teaching us. And it had all the enzymes in it. We had the crustacean in there.
[44:18.530 --> 44:24.370]  So it had the chitin in it. We had meals that weren't like the cotton and we got soy, but it
[44:24.370 --> 44:32.450]  was GMO organ tilth. Like, so we found ways to get basically an entire well-rounded product together
[44:32.450 --> 44:37.650]  with 15 ingredients mixed together and it worked well. And what we targeted was how do we get the
[44:37.650 --> 44:42.290]  P and the K to be two to one because the best growers at the time were seeing the biggest yield
[44:42.290 --> 44:47.490]  doing that. And since it was just a top dress or a mix in, we thought that would be a good ratio
[44:47.490 --> 44:54.370]  since a lot of the compost in the market was 10 to one potassium being dominant. And so if we made
[44:54.370 --> 45:00.610]  it P heavy and living soil customers use it, it would compliment their compost and we made it
[45:00.610 --> 45:06.130]  calcium heavy. So if you take compost is biggest weakness is calcium and phosphorus, which is so
[45:06.130 --> 45:11.010]  funny because the old heads here in Montrose, they used to get manure and then they would get
[45:11.010 --> 45:15.170]  bone meal and then they would mix that in their soil and they would pour milk from the milk plant
[45:15.170 --> 45:19.170]  that was wasted on it. That's how they grew their veggies because it was free. And I'm like, bro,
[45:19.170 --> 45:26.770]  we're using lacto, right? And so we got that, not bone meal. We don't use, we use fish bone meal or
[45:26.770 --> 45:30.530]  we use other phosphorus sources just because it comes from all the cattle industry, the regular
[45:30.530 --> 45:37.650]  bone meal. But that at least we got right early on. We did get that right. And then we put kelp
[45:37.650 --> 45:42.050]  and there's the rock dust. So it had every micronutrient in it. So to me, the Kraftlin
[45:42.050 --> 45:49.890]  became the buffet. And when you're growing in or the living soil style, you're not supposed to ask,
[45:49.890 --> 45:54.210]  is this calcium? Is that potassium? You're supposed to say, Hey, it looks hungry. I'll make
[45:54.210 --> 45:59.330]  sure everything's there just like a human. And so the Kraftlin was like, buffet is full again. Pick
[45:59.330 --> 46:04.130]  what you'd like with your intelligence. I don't know. And the main reason was that maybe it was
[46:04.130 --> 46:08.370]  calcium, but maybe it was because potassium was excessive blocking it because of that and adding
[46:08.370 --> 46:13.570]  it wouldn't have unfixed that. So because we started to realize it was more complex than we
[46:13.570 --> 46:20.130]  really knew when it came down to it, cation exchange, biology, we learned that the root could
[46:20.130 --> 46:26.690]  change the pH like several points right around its tip, mind blowing. So we stopped pH-ing. We started
[46:26.690 --> 46:32.130]  using more diversity, which is what permaculture teaches and fucking built like the Kraftlin just
[46:32.130 --> 46:37.250]  hit it, hit the nail on the head. So it's to this day, one of my favorite products. It's better
[46:37.250 --> 46:42.770]  today than it's ever been because the heavy metals are very low. The PDK is still super strong
[46:42.770 --> 46:49.170]  and it's still really diverse. So yeah, that's one of the only, um, non single ingredient,
[46:49.170 --> 46:53.650]  uh, things that I actually buy, man. I like y'all's Kraftlin. I use it when I start my soil
[46:53.650 --> 46:59.090]  bills. Yeah. Well, from a business perspective, I will say it's the worst decision I ever made
[46:59.090 --> 47:04.530]  in the best, meaning we have to buy 15, like 15 of those 2000 pound totes. Like, how do you mix it?
[47:05.090 --> 47:09.330]  Like it's hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment or lots of man labor, and then it's
[47:09.330 --> 47:13.170]  gotta be mixed, right? And so, man, we really did a number towards ourselves making that, but
[47:13.730 --> 47:17.890]  through that, we figured out how to, and it does make a difference. And I like it because
[47:18.450 --> 47:22.290]  you can, anybody can buy like one ingredient. It's a commodity. There's no competition there.
[47:22.290 --> 47:25.170]  It's fine. You just sell it the cheapest price, as long as it's good quality,
[47:25.170 --> 47:29.970]  but it's hard to go source 15 ingredients, mix them together. And so if we take that burden,
[47:30.050 --> 47:35.410]  we take that burden, I at least feel justified in offering the product and it really works. So
[47:37.090 --> 47:41.170]  and here's the other thing to mimic that. I forgot this part of the story. You can do the same thing
[47:41.170 --> 47:46.530]  I did. I'm nobody special as far as making the Kraftland. I just knew what I wanted for calcium,
[47:46.530 --> 47:53.250]  PK, micronutrients. Who taught me that was Steve Solomon in the intelligent gardener. He talks
[47:53.250 --> 47:58.530]  about making his forget what he calls it, like his fix it mixers, organic everything mix. And he
[47:58.530 --> 48:04.290]  explains that you should have a seed meal, a calcium source, a phosphor source, and then
[48:04.290 --> 48:08.610]  you'll be well-rounded. And so it makes sense. Seeds are what you feed animals to be all the
[48:08.610 --> 48:13.650]  food seeds are what you eat when you're trying to eat more vegetables, but need that protein.
[48:13.650 --> 48:18.050]  And you want to make sure you have all the ingredients. So I was like, ah, seed meal,
[48:19.010 --> 48:23.010]  make sure we focus on some P and make sure we have the calcium heavy in there. And that's what
[48:23.010 --> 48:27.810]  Steve Solomon said, here's how you can build a recipe. And so that's part of what I paid
[48:27.810 --> 48:32.050]  attention to with the Kraftland, but anybody can do it if they have a whole bunch of boxes of
[48:32.050 --> 48:37.730]  ingredients by just paying attention to what Steve taught. And then we have learned that like, right,
[48:37.730 --> 48:43.330]  if you put five times the amount of kelp might be too salty, might be a little weird, but if you put
[48:43.330 --> 48:48.610]  five times the amount of the salt, nobody cares. So there's some little rules in there, but I think
[48:48.610 --> 48:55.570]  most people pick them up over time doing this. And then once it seemed like the, you know,
[48:55.570 --> 49:01.410]  the newer individuals to this started to up the calcium, all of the little bullshit mistakes that
[49:01.410 --> 49:06.610]  kind of came with that, where mostly like the powdery mildews and stuff, all that stuff started
[49:06.610 --> 49:11.730]  to seem to go away when the focus was now obviously on the health of the plant, but maybe giving her
[49:11.730 --> 49:16.610]  the extra calcium that she really needs to get to the next level. And we always joke, like trying to
[49:16.610 --> 49:20.690]  get these girls to Wimbledon, you know, we want these stocky individuals, how do we get them there?
[49:21.330 --> 49:26.370]  You know, you got to be able to add some of the extra stuff. It did seem like calcium was king.
[49:26.370 --> 49:31.890]  And, you know, coots was definitely one of the first ones in that forum. As far as I remember,
[49:31.890 --> 49:36.690]  I was kind of talking about that stuff. Yep. He had lots of calcium, a lot of oyster shell
[49:36.690 --> 49:42.050]  flour, lots of gypsum. We learned that just blindly putting oyster shell flour was a problem.
[49:42.050 --> 49:46.770]  When we went to outdoor, we had some local growers that had a problem. Their ditch water was high in
[49:46.850 --> 49:51.650]  carbon. And when it hit that oyster shell, it just rebound and no amount of biology could unlock it.
[49:51.650 --> 49:55.570]  Their water would relock it and they were just having issues. So gypsum fixes that in their
[49:55.570 --> 50:01.570]  equation. That's why the two I think are important, but the calcium heavy was interesting. And one of
[50:01.570 --> 50:05.970]  the things I think that happened when we started doing soil testing is we found when you put 33%
[50:05.970 --> 50:12.770]  compost and lots of nutrients, you've filled the cation exchange. You're going to be above 7.0 pH.
[50:13.170 --> 50:17.170]  You're not going to be lower. Usually to be acidic. You didn't put a lot of stuff in and
[50:17.170 --> 50:21.090]  our recipes have a lot of stuff. And so we're like, well, how does this work? The pH is high.
[50:21.090 --> 50:24.290]  How does it work when you're feeding axle? And that's got a nine pH in the water and all these
[50:24.290 --> 50:30.530]  questions we had. Well, I realized that the pH in water was what hydro needed, but living soil,
[50:31.250 --> 50:35.330]  it was based on the pH of the soil. The water wasn't affected as much. And when I learned about
[50:35.330 --> 50:40.850]  calcium was that let's say your pH was like 6.5 and you're feeling pretty good, but you get a soil
[50:40.850 --> 50:44.610]  test and you realize it's all magnesium and potassium. Your calcium is low, but your pH is
[50:44.610 --> 50:48.850]  on point. Well, what did pH and do for you? Nothing. Your pH was right, but it didn't tell
[50:48.850 --> 50:54.290]  you that it was out of whack. What I learned was when calcium is heavy, even if your pH is jacked,
[50:54.850 --> 51:00.050]  if the calcium is the heavy, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. But if your sodium is the
[51:00.050 --> 51:04.530]  reason why pH is jacked, you're fucked. And so it's a huge difference. And so even if people
[51:04.530 --> 51:11.650]  add too much calcium may not be ideal, but you can grow in 90% calcium soil agriculturally and
[51:11.650 --> 51:16.690]  crush it from plant health and still do well. And instead of trying to force your pH, you just
[51:16.690 --> 51:22.050]  realize where you live has high pH soil and you do different things, but correcting it could cause
[51:22.050 --> 51:28.210]  millions of dollars and not fix much. Now, if you have soil that is neutral pH and has all these
[51:28.210 --> 51:32.370]  other things that are high yet, correcting that would be important because that would mean getting
[51:32.370 --> 51:37.410]  calcium higher, getting sodium lower, getting magnesium. When it's an order, the pH will be
[51:37.410 --> 51:41.410]  right. And so it makes sense that when you have hydro, you have to fix the water because that's
[51:41.410 --> 51:45.970]  how it's taken. But in soil, the pH could be misleading. The tail wagging the dog.
[51:45.970 --> 51:48.130]  I always say the soil will buffer.
[51:48.130 --> 51:54.530]  It will. And it'll buffer it faster and better if it's built in the proper stack first. And what I
[51:54.530 --> 51:58.690]  mean, it's almost like building a birdhouse that's big enough. You're going to get a bird,
[51:58.690 --> 52:04.050]  whole families of them. But if you try and build the bird, you're trying to be God, so to speak.
[52:04.050 --> 52:09.010]  And so here we build good soil. The biology takes off and flourishes. The plants rage.
[52:09.010 --> 52:15.090]  And if you're not perfect, it'll buffer. It'll fix. We do have to get in that window. The other
[52:15.090 --> 52:20.530]  thing we've learned about the coots recipe is that it's heavy. Our soil is 40, 50 pounds,
[52:20.530 --> 52:25.250]  and nobody wants to sell that through the mail. Or I mean, you know, have an older someone at a
[52:25.250 --> 52:29.090]  shop, grab it off a high shelf because they want to stock it like at Walmart or something.
[52:29.090 --> 52:33.090]  So, you know, no living soils are really distributed. It's more normal now. And we've
[52:33.810 --> 52:40.930]  through logistics and everything else gotten a lot into stores. But watering became the next issue.
[52:41.650 --> 52:45.490]  You get somebody turned on a living soil and they don't have a real good pulse on watering. They
[52:45.490 --> 52:50.290]  don't have that connection where they know they're going to overwater or underwater severely because
[52:50.290 --> 52:54.690]  it wasn't a texture based system. All other soils on the market were sold to these big
[52:54.690 --> 52:58.050]  nursery and grows in little tiny plants. So texture was the only thing that mattered.
[52:58.050 --> 53:02.690]  They could feed them through drip, through whatever texture they are gangster at. They
[53:02.690 --> 53:06.370]  would know infiltration rates and how much water would hold. Do you want more water, less water?
[53:07.090 --> 53:11.330]  So someone who's used to a lot of drainage and perlite and something really fluffy,
[53:11.330 --> 53:14.850]  they get into a living soil and they're like, I don't know, I said water more. It needs water.
[53:14.850 --> 53:19.970]  It's got to be wet and alive and their plants won't grow or they underwater it. And now what
[53:19.970 --> 53:23.730]  little bit of water is in that soil has lots of nutrients in it and the plants get a little
[53:23.730 --> 53:28.290]  unhappy. And so I think once people figure that out, it's just game changer.
[53:28.290 --> 53:32.370]  Yeah. You get lots of dry pockets in there if you don't have your water game, right?
[53:32.930 --> 53:36.770]  In the cube, right? Wetting agents back, you know, what's sapping in was what we used to joke
[53:36.770 --> 53:41.330]  about back in the day. That's right. Definitely got to wet that water. But so look, so I do,
[53:41.330 --> 53:47.970]  I do the coots. So one third rice hulls and I hear it every single time. So I do a third rice hulls
[53:47.970 --> 53:54.210]  from you and I do a third of this Canadian sphagnum peat. And then my other third is a
[53:54.850 --> 54:01.410]  part IMO three and part my compost. So I threw the IMO in there. So I'm kind of still kind of
[54:01.410 --> 54:07.970]  in the coots realm, but every time I blend this and I, and I posted, everyone's like rice hulls,
[54:07.970 --> 54:12.290]  arsenic, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Let's tell me I'm safe.
[54:13.010 --> 54:17.250]  Aha. So if you're using rice hulls from us, you're safe. Um, every batch that we get is
[54:17.250 --> 54:22.050]  tested. There is going to be some fluctuating, heavy metals and everything in the world that
[54:22.050 --> 54:26.610]  is organic. So I think that educating people that that periodic table of elements is what
[54:26.610 --> 54:30.210]  we're built out of. When they swim in the ocean, they're getting every single one of them.
[54:30.770 --> 54:35.330]  There can't be a fear, but we don't want anything excessive. I do believe that a lot of
[54:35.330 --> 54:40.850]  cigarette smokers get cancer from the cadmium. And so it's not good to have heavy metals.
[54:40.850 --> 54:46.690]  However, the restrictions they're putting on licensed grows are more restrictive than
[54:46.690 --> 54:50.930]  anything in the entire world that ever has been all the soil and everybody's backyard.
[54:50.930 --> 54:55.250]  They've been grown weeding forever is higher than any of the restrictions as far as accumulation
[54:55.250 --> 55:01.410]  ability, but it's still very low. And so the game of running commercial is very different than
[55:01.410 --> 55:06.370]  what's healthy and what's, what's traditionally good. However, the reason people scared of rice
[55:06.370 --> 55:10.690]  is they hear the fear on the news from some year where they make up a new flu or they make
[55:10.690 --> 55:15.330]  up a new thing to be scared of. Arsenic was a huge one for a year or two, and it was because
[55:15.330 --> 55:21.490]  rice can accumulate it. And if you are in an area where the soil has lots of arsenic and they're
[55:21.490 --> 55:27.650]  growing rice on it, it will accumulate it. Um, I think that we're not in a world where somebody
[55:27.650 --> 55:33.330]  lives in a village and eat that arsenic laden rice all day, every day, but still at any elevated
[55:33.330 --> 55:38.210]  level, it's a problem. So they're right to be a little fearful. Um, the product that we get
[55:38.210 --> 55:41.730]  because it's sold to nurseries, there's a couple of things that are done. They have a lot of heavy
[55:41.730 --> 55:47.730]  metal testing done on it. Um, and then on top of that, they do germination tests. A lot of the
[55:47.730 --> 55:52.690]  rice holes on the market will still have rice germinating. Um, if you've ever sprouted seeds,
[55:52.690 --> 55:57.090]  some of them will germinate after you re-dry them and re wet them again, because nature's amazing.
[55:57.730 --> 56:03.330]  And if you do that in little cells with millions of dollars a seed and a glass ocean of greenhouse,
[56:03.330 --> 56:06.530]  because you're selling to Home Depot, everything you just planted will die.
[56:07.570 --> 56:12.930]  So because the lawsuits and all that, PBH has a par boiled and they do a lot of germ tests to make
[56:12.930 --> 56:16.530]  sure when you use the rice hole, you're not going to have rice growing out of everything. And so
[56:16.530 --> 56:22.290]  that was important. Um, the other thing is it's high silica and the challenge with holes. Um,
[56:22.290 --> 56:27.330]  we use buckwheat, um, because they sell it at the natural grocery stores for making organic pillows,
[56:28.050 --> 56:31.010]  things like that. You can go and buy a little bag of buckwheat holes,
[56:31.730 --> 56:36.930]  but that robbed so much nitrogen that it would ruin your soil unless you loaded it with nitrogen.
[56:36.930 --> 56:40.210]  So was it almost like wood chips then? And that's it?
[56:40.210 --> 56:45.810]  Kind of. And so I will say rice holes do rob nitrogen as well, but it's mostly silica. It's
[56:45.810 --> 56:49.410]  not quite as bad and it's totally doable when you have a lot of compost and you know what you're
[56:49.410 --> 56:56.290]  doing. And we're going to be adding back that nitrogen via our JLFs, fertilizer, whatever else
[56:56.290 --> 57:01.090]  you're using for it. Yep. And I think that's why KNF and all of this works really well is that a
[57:01.090 --> 57:07.330]  lot of times in our soil, even in living soil, when you get the lighting right, the environment
[57:07.330 --> 57:12.290]  right, it's almost like you got an Olympic athlete on your hand and you need to feed it slightly
[57:12.290 --> 57:18.530]  more, not slightly more, but if you're in a, not a big ecosystem and you're not perfect on it,
[57:18.530 --> 57:24.610]  having the ability to have little bits of organic matter and ingredients go in that are natural to
[57:24.610 --> 57:30.370]  your soil that feed the soil and also make that nutrient cycling occur, it allows you to keep up
[57:30.370 --> 57:36.770]  with the speed of your plant. The biology can't be slower than your plant's ability to grow.
[57:36.770 --> 57:40.610]  Where we really see that an issue is when people are doing large outdoor grows, 10 pound plus
[57:40.610 --> 57:46.050]  plants, it becomes a different game to make it all the way through the season. And I think that's why
[57:46.050 --> 57:53.330]  a lot of these, like I've got the new one here that I've been going through. And there's just so
[57:53.330 --> 57:58.530]  much of this that works. And so that's why I'm looking at the IPM one. But I think it's because
[57:58.530 --> 58:04.610]  of that when you're living soil, everything's locked in that organic matter. So constantly
[58:04.610 --> 58:09.330]  unlocking it and getting a little bit of solubles in there, it's much more forgiving than hydro,
[58:09.330 --> 58:14.610]  but you get huge rewards on turps and yield. So. Oh yeah, definitely.
[58:17.090 --> 58:22.450]  Things are improving and that's kind of the, I almost think like people just used to think that
[58:22.450 --> 58:27.010]  that was a fairy tale, you know, like, what do you mean things? I can reuse this stuff year after
[58:27.010 --> 58:33.650]  year. And if you have a bright minded individual or crew that can be achieved and there's a lot
[58:33.650 --> 58:39.250]  of commercial facilities starting to come online that are showing that. Yep. Yeah, definitely.
[58:39.250 --> 58:44.050]  If you, but you got to remember, you got to, once you increase all that biology and these living
[58:44.050 --> 58:49.410]  soils, like, like Jeremy said, it's got to be fed. You know, it's, it's, it's, it becomes like a
[58:49.410 --> 58:54.610]  stomach. That bed is a stomach for your plant. And if you don't feed it, your plants will suffer.
[58:55.730 --> 59:00.450]  You got to keep top dressing, adding in those organic. Yeah. We're taking from it, right?
[59:00.450 --> 59:04.850]  There's no way around that. We're not, we don't have a closed loop. I smoke it all. Like I know
[59:04.850 --> 59:10.930]  where it's going. Right. And so we have to put back, I think in living soil, we've realized that
[59:10.930 --> 59:15.410]  if we have a fuel tank in that soil, we'd like to keep it between half full and full.
[59:15.970 --> 59:20.050]  Mm hmm. I don't want to do five gallons where I'm going to empty and trying to pretend like I'm good
[59:20.050 --> 59:24.530]  enough to balance it. Perfect. Back at a hundred. If I just go kind of halfway and backing up and
[59:24.530 --> 59:28.850]  keep it always on the top, like we're good. I don't have to be perfect. The soil in the forest
[59:28.850 --> 59:33.170]  is the same way. The feeder roots are up there getting the litter, the water and minerals down,
[59:33.170 --> 59:38.530]  down deep. And when you keep soil for a long time, it becomes that the food is all mostly on top.
[59:38.530 --> 59:43.650]  The worms bring a little down, but it's when you mix it in that you have to be perfect. And that's
[59:43.650 --> 59:48.130]  why these recipes with a thousand ingredients cause a lot of people saying it worked and a lot
[59:48.130 --> 59:52.050]  of people saying it didn't work. It was very easy to screw it up. You know, because you only had to
[59:52.050 --> 59:57.330]  be off on one or two. Yeah. You're done your whole round and then you can't even reuse it because you
[59:57.330 --> 01:00:04.450]  don't know what you did wrong. So the data would, uh, people would freak out mid grow. I saw that
[01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:08.930]  many times where, all right, they're not really focused on pH, not really focused on pH. The
[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:14.370]  littlest thing goes wrong. And now they're super focused on pH, almost hyper-focused on pH again,
[01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:18.770]  not trusting the process. And that's what I meant by when you started putting out the videos
[01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:23.410]  so people can kind of see in real time, like anybody could take a photo of a part of their
[01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:27.890]  garden. That's fantastic. But to actually start to show the actual whole, even at that, you know,
[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.490]  you were doing tent grows and stuff. You get to see the whole tent grow. So I mean, there's
[01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:35.570]  a whole thing live and I can fail right in front of you. And I don't know any other nutrient or
[01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:40.290]  soil companies that hang it out there like that. And now people see me doing it for a decade. They
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:43.730]  just think, whatever, it's part of our model. But I gotta tell you, it's scary, bro. Every time I
[01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:48.850]  pop seeds, every time I transplant, I mean, dude, it's sketch. And it's not that I'm relying on that
[01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:53.170]  income. Like I got to hustle it. I'm just going to smoke it, but I'm relying on that authenticity.
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:01:00.290]  And if I fail, it's bad. Learning moments are okay. You know, nobody's perfect.
[01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:05.410]  And I was going to say, Jeremy, I bet some of it is because I do it similarly. Like I put it out
[01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:11.250]  there because I want myself to be held accountable. Held accountable. Like, yes. Yep. Didn't you start
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:15.490]  those seeds a few months ago? Whatever. Yeah. What happened to those? That on the forum, you'd see,
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:20.850]  no, no more updates ever again. Yeah. Game change, new thread. I'm back at it, you know?
[01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.970]  Oh man. So jujitsu, I practice it. I always mentioned it a lot. It's similar in the sense
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:31.250]  that when you're new, it's so strange, this phenomenon where you're like a white belt,
[01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.290]  this black belt's been doing it 20 years and we'll wrap you up in a knot.
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:38.610]  They'll tell you something. It'd be like, yeah, on YouTube, I saw that wasn't actually right.
[01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:44.050]  I've heard you're supposed to do this. And it's just bullshit because you don't even know what's
[01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.890]  fucking real. You're just like, well, oh yeah, my coach might be saying something that this other
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:52.450]  black belt that I think is more experienced says you shouldn't do. I realized there's no one answer.
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.810]  And then you start to get more experienced and you're like, oh man, he knows so much more than
[01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.970]  I do. He's forgot more than I've even learned. Like I should just shut up and learn. And you
[01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:03.970]  start to actually focus on the fundamentals and it makes a huge difference. But you have the faith
[01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:10.930]  of looking up and at any time you can see someone who can just make it look like an art to manhandle
[01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:18.850]  someone that's bigger than him, stronger than him. And when I try so hard, it's like child's play for
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:22.930]  him to deal with me. I'm like, okay, there's still more for me to learn. I can still look forward.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:28.450]  And so posting your content out there, that's the future. You guys do it too. I know people that
[01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:32.370]  know that will not put content out there. It's scared. They don't want to do it. They don't want
[01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:36.210]  to show up and then stop in three weeks. It's like telling people you're going to go to the gym and
[01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:41.090]  then you just stop going. It's part of life. And if you produce content and you be a beacon of light
[01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.610]  and you don't dim it and you share it, yeah, there'll be some problems. There'll be a little
[01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:50.690]  bit of hate or whatever, but I'd swear 99.99% of it is all love and it works really well.
[01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:56.850]  Definitely. Do you know this dude? His name is Barrett Yoshoda. You ever heard of him?
[01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:02.050]  Yeah. I had no idea who that was. He's a friend of the family. No way.
[01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:08.370]  Yeah. He asked me to show up to this thing. I'm carrying my son at the time. He's probably one
[01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.490]  or two years old. And all of a sudden, everyone's like, oh man, your baby knows Barrett? Yeah.
[01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:18.130]  And then in my head, I'm going, I don't even know who Barrett is. I don't even know. Yeah,
[01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:22.930]  my baby's cool. And that dude manhandled. I believe he flew all the way from California.
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:28.050]  This was held here in Colorado. And I think he won in like 50 something seconds. I mean,
[01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:34.450]  all that time and effort. And this dude, I was smoking weed with him after the event.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:39.090]  And he showed me on his arm where he had, I guess you kind of like back in the day,
[01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:44.210]  you would kind of like get that to where it was calcified. And that was some like real gangster
[01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:49.250]  shit back in the day because- Dude, back in the day, most of the fighters are hardcore. They do
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:53.650]  shit like they would just walk out of each other. His stories were unbelievable. And what's so cool
[01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:58.450]  about it is I didn't know who he was. So I wasn't like starstruck or anything. And I think he liked
[01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:04.690]  that about the situation. Cause I was just like, oh, that's cool, man. But yeah, pretty cool to
[01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:10.850]  see. And like the discipline, he basically spoke about, he did that, smoked cannabis, slept.
[01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:16.770]  That was his lifestyle. What about like Joe Rogan? I'm not trying to emulate that, but I'm like,
[01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:20.210]  bro, he likes weed, likes jujitsu, like a lot of, you know what I'm saying? And then all of a
[01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:24.530]  sudden you got a GLP, Nevada, everybody knows like 30 something rounds living soil. You're like,
[01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:32.210]  oh shit, he fought MMA? Like fuck. Cantwell? I mean, he's a name in fighting. And so I think
[01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:38.290]  that it follows a lot of our customers, a lot of people that not custom, that's not the word,
[01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:43.730]  but people that I know them as customers, but they're into living soil. And that's why I talk
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:48.770]  to them. Many areas of their life, they're in the pursuit of the best. And they're learning
[01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:52.370]  the lessons from it. And it's not always the same, right? Not everybody's into the same thing,
[01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:57.650]  but there's that pursuit of the best. And that's why we never wanted to be the cheapest, the hydro,
[01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:03.250]  the please everybody have, you know, every type of ingredient, only what's in our lane that we use,
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:07.010]  that we care about. So we can talk it, walk it, the whole deal. And then if someone says,
[01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:11.490]  let's literally, I had this happen. I had the white belt asking the black belt, are you sure
[01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:15.730]  that's not a real thing? I had someone message our staff and say, Hey, we grew one bed of living
[01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:20.530]  organic soil with all the mountain your way. We put top dressing that build a flower, all this
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:25.410]  stuff. Then we did it over here where we fed nectar, the gods, the whole way, or that was
[01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:29.250]  their line, but it was still living organic soil with Ollie. And I was like, Oh, this is fascinating.
[01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:37.170]  What, what turned out? And like your side was half the Terps. Exactly. Well, half the Terps and
[01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:42.290]  no half the THC, sorry, not half the Turks. And I'm like half the THC. That's not possible.
[01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:46.130]  Genetics are related to that. I've never seen anything double or cut in half based on a gross
[01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:53.010]  style. Same, same cut, same Fino. We asked all the questions, my staff's pulling their hair out.
[01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:56.530]  There's no fucking way. And the reason why we're saying no fucking way, we're not getting scared,
[01:05:56.530 --> 01:06:02.370]  like, Oh no, maybe our way doesn't work. We've been around the block. We know what happens when
[01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:07.010]  you do testing more Turkey, same THC or better, depending on the type of cut, the season,
[01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:11.570]  greenhouse, all those things. So everybody's kind of talking about it here at the staff.
[01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:15.330]  The next day we get an answer because we told them retest. They call the lab lab made a fucking
[01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:20.610]  decimal wire. And not only did not have to feed the whole time, but the yield was the same or
[01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.570]  better quality was on point. THC was the same. And so now they're like, well, fuck now we don't have
[01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.450]  to feed. But just like you talked about at commercial, a lot of people are very scared to
[01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:35.730]  stop feeding like a line, right? Like a full program where it says what to add every day.
[01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:39.010]  They're very scared. And I get it. If you're running a commercial facility, you have to have
[01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:44.690]  a system and an SOP and it has to be duplicatable if your guy quits or if there's a new guy and
[01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:50.290]  every commercial grow, like you pointed to is like shady as fuck, had horrible business practices.
[01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:54.370]  The new grow would come in, change the entire system. They'd be backdoor deals, moldy shit,
[01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:59.330]  bug bombs, like terrible. And so when I heard what the industry was like, I just decided to
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:03.970]  sell the shovels, as they say, in the gold rush and just stay on, stay in my lane and just help
[01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:11.410]  organic growers and mine the mine a decade. Holy shit. Was it a good decision? So most of those
[01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:15.250]  dudes are out of business. Yeah, bro. I'm not saying we couldn't have been one of them. Right.
[01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:19.890]  But it's like that hindsight, it's starting to see that, man, some of that stuff they talk about,
[01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:26.210]  it's real. So, well, the path you chose is much better for the community because you're helping
[01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:30.850]  a lot more people than you would be if you were just stay into your own little lane,
[01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.970]  doing your own little grows and stuff. But that's the business success formula.
[01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:39.570]  How do you solve people's problems and how do you help them? Professional problem solving is
[01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:43.890]  the only reason to be in business or I don't have a job. And so luckily there's a lot of
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:48.130]  problems in gardening and I fucking love, I just love it. It's like jujitsu, it's like a constant
[01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:52.050]  puzzle. It's like the guitar, it's anything that's a lifelong, you'll never fully learn.
[01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:57.250]  But beginners think they're going to be an expert in three months. And so, but the good thing is you
[01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:02.450]  can pull down a crop 90% as good as an expert. There's no expert, you know, like the soil is
[01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:06.850]  the expert. And so you just kind of take these lessons and you don't have to be a pro, you just
[01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:13.250]  have to be a steward. And, um, bro, it's, it's crazy what this whole, I didn't think I'd be doing
[01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:18.610]  anything like this in my life, you know, like talking about cannabis and talking to like,
[01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:23.250]  we have the vegetable farm. I thought I'd have a vegetable farm, this stuff that we do,
[01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:29.650]  because we want to grow the best weed. It crushes vegetables, like tomatoes to the top of the
[01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:35.730]  greenhouse, then dropped, then trellis over so that it starts to go down 50 feet around the pole
[01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:41.970]  and back again. No pesticides, no fricking liquid fertilizers or anything. Just some crap plants,
[01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:48.450]  worm castings, like the same stuff. So I've seen it so much that I just know when someone calls and
[01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:53.250]  says there's half THC, I'm like, nope. When someone says, will this work? I'm like, yes,
[01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:57.970]  thousands of pounds of tomatoes. Like I know it will work. When I first started build a soil,
[01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:02.130]  I did not know. I said, I don't, you do it in your commercial grow. You tell me if it works,
[01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:08.050]  I would love to find out, you know? So. Nice. Now you got, I'm sure, I mean,
[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:13.650]  obviously everybody's using your stuff. So you, are you guys good at kind of keeping that data?
[01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:18.130]  Like do you guys, you know, when you're supporting these commercial grows and knowing if they give
[01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:24.050]  you feedback kind of, and is there anything that you used to sell or that you stood by now? You're
[01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:28.690]  like, no, I'm not doing that anymore. We've learned. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff
[01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:33.410]  over the years that we've learned. And we're only as good as the data that we've been given. A lot
[01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:37.330]  of these grows are more like, Hey, we'll tell you some stuff, but this is our data. And, you know,
[01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:41.650]  boss, isn't going to let me slip all this stuff out. And some people are very forthcoming.
[01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:45.570]  I think the biggest mistake that we've ever made was the heavy metal scenario. And it's
[01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:49.650]  not really a mistake. It's just that all of our recipes use lots of materials like kelp and
[01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:55.650]  mine minerals and rock dust and stuff that do fluctuate. And so the biggest thing we've learned
[01:09:55.650 --> 01:10:00.770]  is we test every batch now and we're aware, but what we've done is we've just eliminated any
[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:06.370]  ingredient that fluctuates. So now even if it does fluctuate, it's so low, it's not a problem.
[01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:11.010]  And a lot of those are plant-based instead of mineral based, and that eliminates most of the
[01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:16.930]  scenario, but some of the rock dust are still very clean. So we did learn some of that as far
[01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:22.210]  as specific products and lessons that we learned. Amino acids are one that I just never thought we'd
[01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:27.090]  sell or use. I just saw the 16 zero zero high nitrogen. I'm like, that's some bullshit. I'll
[01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:32.050]  never sell it. And now I realize, Oh, that's the protein shake for an athlete. Like you can't just
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:36.930]  eat steak all day. And sometimes you're just, you get so full at so many calories. So in a living
[01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:43.010]  soil bed, game changing for seedlings for, for transplant or for whatever. And Kevin from root
[01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:46.850]  wise taught me this. He goes, the big plant outdoor growers that are growing 10 plus pound
[01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:52.290]  plants, their foliar spring aminos almost daily. I'm like, really? Cause bro, they just, you just
[01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:57.810]  can't keep up. They're huge plants. I'm like, interesting. And so a lot of times you'll hear
[01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:01.570]  customers like when we grew the coops recipe, they're like, Oh, it's too much nitrogen, bro.
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:05.810]  You get the test back from the lab. It says one part, like not even a pound per acre of nitrogen
[01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:11.890]  in the soil. Um, but the older school genetics are so good at getting it out of the organic matter.
[01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:16.690]  It's not needed, but some of our newer genetics need a little help. And those aminos like fix it.
[01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:21.490]  They can just have, they help. It's like lighter fluid. It helps them dig into the soil and get
[01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:28.130]  all the other things out of it. So in the world of, of do it yourself, that's why I realized
[01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:33.410]  lacto is so, so powerful. And that's why we have that new Yahweh product, which is a kefir, which
[01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:38.130]  long full circle on this one. I was making kefir when I started to learn about lacto,
[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:41.970]  my dad made kefir cause he thought it would help his gut because he was dealing with some issues
[01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:48.050]  health wise. And so that connected to me. I wanted to make it to copy. And then when I left it too
[01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:51.730]  long, it made way. And I was like, Whoa, I've been working real hard with rice wash to make that.
[01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:56.930]  That looks better. And I just filed it. Well, long story short, Eric here ran with that idea and is
[01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:02.210]  making it in bulk and under the microscope and the plants, it just phenomenal difference. I think it's
[01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:06.530]  cause it's probably got aminos. And I think that the nitrogen has always been one of those like
[01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:10.690]  ones that visibly creates a difference, but now I'm not as scared of it. 10 years ago, I was like
[01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:16.050]  nitrogen. That's a dirty word. Um, other things besides the calcium we noticed when we tested
[01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:21.490]  coops recipe and people that are just blindly following, we learned really that if you get a
[01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:28.210]  local compost, it's probably better to use 10%, not 33%. And then top dress and get some
[01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:33.410]  because of the salts and sodium or so jacked and all of them. There's no good comp. They're all
[01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.970]  woody. They rub nitrogen. But if you got good compost, it's different. It's just, that's
[01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.210]  something we just learned. We were like using the local guy that made compost at the same percentage.
[01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:46.850]  And I'm like, man, my plants are lime green and I know it's finished. And it's got fungal growth on
[01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:51.490]  it, on the wood. And from like that appearance and texture and smell, everything was on point.
[01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:58.610]  The lab unlocked some of these last secrets that when the folklore didn't line up, it wasn't because
[01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:03.970]  it wasn't right. It's just because not everybody's making good stuff out there. Right. And, and they
[01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:08.850]  rush it a lot of time. Yeah. That information's like in, people are dying with it. Right. There's
[01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:13.250]  not, not everybody knows how to make a good compost pile. Even today you search how there's
[01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:19.490]  10,000 ways to do it. And none of them are that great. So what, um, so Jeremy, what, what can
[01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:27.810]  cause me to have elevated, not high, but elevated cadmium? Not, not the words out of test parameters,
[01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:33.810]  but I've seen that in a newer soil I built. So the one ingredient that was causing an issue for us
[01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:40.210]  was soft rock phosphate or calcium phosphate. We've pulled it out of craft blend and we've pulled it
[01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:44.530]  out of all of our soils and we've replaced it with a few phosphorus ingredients that were hard to
[01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:48.690]  find that work really well, that are clean and large enough scale. We have an organic rice brand
[01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:53.970]  that we use right now that is very low on heavy metals, including arsenic and cadmium, but it's
[01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:59.570]  6% available phosphorus. And the soft rock phosphate we would often get is only 3% available.
[01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:04.690]  And the new age stuff. So, um, the active, the Ferticel, like any of the products that are the
[01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:10.930]  high phosphorus, they're just the finest micronized, um, calcium phosphate that can find.
[01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:17.970]  Those are low heavy metal, but what does low mean? There is no baseline in the world for it. You go
[01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:23.010]  look at what all the A plus ratings are for even other countries that are stricter than us.
[01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:26.770]  And their cadmium levels are significantly higher than you would want to put in a commercial
[01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:32.610]  facility. So the challenge is there's no way to determine what low meant or what high meant.
[01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:37.490]  So now for me, when we realized that, um, soft rock phosphate, if sourced like
[01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:42.290]  calphos out of Florida, they're usually one to 10 parts per million cadmium in there.
[01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:47.250]  And it's locked in enough where it seems to not really cause a problem, but since calcium is so
[01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:51.730]  important and it rides with sometimes because it's attached to calcium, that can be an issue.
[01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:56.450]  Then there's other sources that can go from 10 to hundreds of parts per million cadmium.
[01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:00.690]  We were, we easily avoided all of those just because we were always looking for the best
[01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:05.250]  quality, but it turns out that even at three or five parts per million, which is a hundred times
[01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:09.650]  lower than the competition, it can still add up because what is soft rock phosphate do it stays
[01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:15.090]  around forever. And so it's kind of a challenge there. Um, then other things, if you get rock
[01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:21.010]  dust, like basalt and azomite and other things, and oftentimes people would say, just go wherever
[01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:25.010]  they grind up gravel and grab it, that might present a problem because you don't know.
[01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:29.570]  But if you buy the industry standards, they're usually very low heavy metals. Um,
[01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:36.930]  other sources that we've noticed are ocean-based sources. And so we have a lot of this. So if you
[01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:41.490]  go to support.buildasoil.com, that's our help desk. There's an article on heavy metals and
[01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:45.970]  there's a lot of in there and you can read between the lines, but like crustacean meal
[01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:51.170]  had a little bit more, but the, the rice bran doesn't. And so the ocean-based stuff seems to
[01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:55.490]  be a little bit more. And so crustacean may have been a source of that, maybe higher cadmium.
[01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:04.450]  Um, otherwise all ingredients have a little bit. And so if there was a couple that were slightly
[01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:09.650]  elevated and used a little bit more, it could cause something. The other weird part when people
[01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:14.370]  first started testing was they introduced testing into States and it wasn't since the beginning.
[01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:17.650]  So a lot of living soil growers were just killing it. No problems. This would living
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:21.330]  soil works perfect while they've already put runs through their soil. And it was already
[01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:26.370]  conditioned, so to speak. It wasn't fresh. Um, and then if you have a little fluctuation
[01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:31.250]  and a couple of ingredients and you're a brand new grower, and maybe you're also feeding because
[01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:37.410]  you've not been told this as a problem and you're buying other products that all accumulates into
[01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:42.370]  what barely breaks that cusp. And so, well, I think it's probably still safe for the consumer,
[01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:46.610]  which is what's so bullshit is this industry is supposed to protect the consumer. And it turns
[01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:51.010]  out it's basically making people grow in hydro so that they can guarantee to their, you know,
[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:55.730]  their, their funding people that they won't fail. We have our ultra clean soil. We've had people
[01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:59.250]  passing with flying colors. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on every ingredient to
[01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:04.530]  identify it. But the home gardener, if they at least avoid some of the ocean sources,
[01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:08.450]  meaning if they're going to use them, use less of those, not quadruple the amount of those
[01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:15.810]  and the soft rock phosphate, calcium phosphate, and also lime. So, um, we had a local lime source
[01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.810]  that we used for a while and that it had a little lead in it. It also had a little
[01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:24.450]  cadmium in it. It's very normal. It's just a lime, but nobody's ever failed for lead that
[01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:27.970]  I've ever heard of. So it seems like the levels that we're seeing in these, the lead's not the
[01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:32.690]  concern. What's funny is you'd think lead would be like the biggest issue. And if you saw some of the
[01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:36.850]  numbers on like rock dust, there is more lead than these cadmium and arsenic, but the plants
[01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:42.930]  tend to only take up the cadmium arsenic, the lead, unless it's bad. Um, in Eastern, Southeastern
[01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:48.210]  Colorado, um, a lot of the outdoor grows, there's a lot of lead out there and those would fail.
[01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:53.250]  So I'm not saying lead's not a problem, but in organic ingredients, the levels at any, from any
[01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:59.650]  brand don't seem to be causing a failure. It seems to be that arsenic, um, typically kelp ocean-based
[01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:05.010]  stuff excessively used or the water that the grower is using. And then cadmium seems to come
[01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:10.530]  from the ocean-based sources or the soft rock phosphate. So, okay, great answer. So, so basically
[01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:17.970]  you can kind of create a problem by using multiple sources of a so-called clean ingredient. If it's a
[01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:22.210]  little bit on the heavier side. And I still think that they're fairly clean because if you read,
[01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:27.890]  I've got a book here, um, see if I've got it right here so I can show it minerals for the genetic
[01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:36.530]  code and it's by Charles Walters. And this was in the PFA. Alan turned me on to this.
[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:41.730]  And the reason why I like that, Oh, are you guys there? Yeah. Is it just me on the screen now? Okay.
[01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:45.250]  Yeah. I'm here. I was making sure, cause I turned around. You can go in every one of them
[01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:50.530]  and see what the benefit is and what the negatives are. And so you can read why arsenic
[01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:54.370]  is beneficial and why cadmium is needed. And so it starts to get you kind of more, Oh,
[01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:59.890]  excessive amounts are bad, but nature's smart enough to use all of this for some purpose.
[01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:04.690]  So the main thing I want people to realize is that we shouldn't be scared. We should be educated.
[01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:09.970]  What's that title again? Jeremy minerals for the genetic code. It's not like a straight read,
[01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:14.690]  but it's a great to go to for sections. And I think it's information that's otherwise hard to find.
[01:19:15.490 --> 01:19:21.890]  Um, so I always flip, I just flipped to the middle, man. I might even start at the back.
[01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.810]  Did sometimes you ever flip a book and it's exactly what you needed to read like Erie.
[01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:33.330]  I love stuff. I love serendipity. Exactly. Yeah. Now, uh, some other information that you put out
[01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:38.370]  that at least in my peer group at the time, um, really took off within there was when the
[01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:44.530]  department of ag, the Oregon department of ag, uh, did a research project, if you will,
[01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:49.970]  on microbes sold on shelves. Um, I was wondering if we could kind of go down memory lane on that
[01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:55.410]  a little bit, kind of re-discuss that, you know, how come no one has ever done some kind of
[01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:00.050]  research projects since, um, I would love to love your opinion on that kind of stuff.
[01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:05.570]  Yeah. Dude, I forgot about all that. That's crazy. There's been so many crazy things that like,
[01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:09.410]  we're not in the cancel culture, but build a soul is definitely called some bullshit out.
[01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:13.810]  When it's happened in the past, I used to be a lot more vocal. We've had some weird stuff where
[01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:18.930]  people are selling microbials that were just crazy claims to literally, I read their website
[01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:24.690]  called the scientist associated with the studies. We live in the, we live in the internet era. I can
[01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:28.450]  get anybody on the phone. I'm on the phone with the scientists. They're like, well, I never worked
[01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:32.450]  with that company. I never even went to that college. You're like, they're just lying,
[01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:38.370]  like boldly lying. And so when the study came out, I believe what you're referencing is that they
[01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:43.010]  went and generically took like great white and all these big brands of microbials, plus a whole
[01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:47.330]  bunch of other lesser known and did a test on them. And they found that there was not a lot
[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:52.450]  of living microbial organisms and a lot of the big brand name products. Then over the next couple
[01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:57.250]  of months to be expected, many people refuted that article and said that the way that they
[01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:01.810]  tested was bullshit. And obviously the state is very ignorant of proper microbial testing.
[01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:06.370]  And that's why those products didn't look as good. I believe the truth is somewhere with both.
[01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:12.530]  I do believe that a lot of the people that have a good interest, just like our customer that called
[01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:17.090]  saying that they had half the THC, but really wanted to stick to living soil. Their test was
[01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:24.210]  wrong. We've seen heavy metal tests wrong when retested. So a lot of times that information can
[01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:28.610]  be inaccurate and there was no retest done on all those microbials and nobody really got a chance.
[01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:33.090]  So I'd have to look back through all the names. I believe some of the ones that were dead were
[01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:37.490]  probably dead. And some of the numbers that were there or not may not be accurate, but it exposed
[01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:42.290]  something same as it did when they started testing edibles. Wow. This edible has a hundred milligrams
[01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:48.930]  and it says 10 and wow, this one has none. Quality control and the promises being made oftentimes
[01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:55.490]  weren't what people thought. And so what Build a Soil did early on that I think has helped us
[01:21:56.450 --> 01:22:02.210]  is we would only pick like one partner to run with that we just knew that would never happen
[01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:06.690]  with. Quality was at the forefront. It would be easier if we had lots of choices and sold every
[01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:10.850]  microbial and just pleased everybody, but we've only stuck with a couple for a very good reason.
[01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:15.890]  And it's because of that fear that, man, I can't, I don't have a scientist lab to test every batch.
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:20.370]  I have to trust that when we do tests and we verify that what they're doing is right. We have
[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:24.770]  to trust that they have good processes. So we started to stay away from anything imported from
[01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:30.610]  overseas, especially microbials. I've talked to a lot of people that have owned and sold or gone
[01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:34.930]  out of business, owning a microbial company, importing materials from overseas. And when they
[01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:39.170]  try and do DNA marketing, when they try and find out if they're being screwed over or not, things
[01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:45.330]  do not add up as to what they're being sold. And it's ripe with the ability to sell snake oil
[01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:49.250]  because you don't know if your plant had a benefit or not, right? You're just trying to make sure
[01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:53.970]  things are healthy. I mean, a good product you should definitely notice, but a lot of these
[01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:58.450]  products will add like an amino acid. So you water in your microbials and your plant grows and you're
[01:22:58.450 --> 01:23:04.370]  like, yeah, got a visual reaction. So they can lie to you. They can lie to you a thousand ways as far
[01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:09.650]  as being slightly misleading and having no real guarantee on the label. And that's why, like,
[01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:15.170]  when I first learned about, um, got quantum and then they were micro life hydro, and it was the
[01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:19.490]  same brand and all these things. Well, one of the guys down the street had a binder this thick with
[01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:22.850]  everything that was in quantum. And I'm like, well, the label doesn't say any of that. He's
[01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:26.610]  like, ah, you can't put everything on the label. Cause no, none of the States know what any of it
[01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:31.250]  is. It to this day, it's a nightmare. Like California doesn't recognize pelvic, uh,
[01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:35.330]  certain micro microbes like EM one just says lacto. We all know it's way more than that.
[01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:42.930]  So it is very easy to take advantage of people and sell them six different microbial products
[01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:46.290]  that have probably similar ingredients in them. And I, a lot of our customers fall
[01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:51.170]  to this. I see, I love root wise, but I'll see people adding root wise and three or four other
[01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:54.850]  microbial products all at once. And I'm like, man, if you're going to do that, just make them
[01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:59.650]  all yourself. Might as well collect the IMO. Yeah. Might as well. If you're just going to go like
[01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:02.770]  go the diversity route, but when you're buying products, sometimes they're just going to
[01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:07.090]  cannibalize each other. A lot of times they've been considered intelligently what percentages
[01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:10.290]  are there. So they don't just eat each other. Kind of like buying a fish tank. You can't just
[01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:14.850]  go get 10 fish and throw them in there without knowing what you're doing. Um, and so the root
[01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:19.170]  wise, uh, we, we definitely believe in, and we could talk about that forever, but anytime you
[01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:23.410]  look at a microbial, maybe get some references from your buddies before you impulse buy, do a
[01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:28.930]  little research. It's one of those areas people can just lie without much accountability and there'd
[01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:32.290]  be a new brand every year. It's going to be that hot and they're going to give out samples and
[01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:35.810]  everybody's going to show it on social media and there'll be a new one next year. So just,
[01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:42.050]  just make sure a new microbe that's been alive since the earth. Yeah. And some of them will be
[01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:45.490]  all bacillus and some of them will be a mix of everything. And some of them will be just
[01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:49.970]  the ASO spirulina for nitrogen. And some will be only mycorrhizae, but four types you don't need.
[01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:54.930]  And fuck, just learn to read the label. One thing that, you know, while we're dropping gold bars,
[01:24:54.930 --> 01:24:59.970]  get yourselves a microscope guys. If you, if you, if you're into this shit and you're saying,
[01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:05.810]  I'm going to buy some microbe scopo. And then if it's in there, you know, you can see some
[01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:11.410]  problem is you don't necessarily know the species because not many have been identified by science.
[01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:16.850]  No, even the classes that they sell you telling you that you can identify are mostly bunk.
[01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:21.970]  Like there, we, we, we learned this stuff every day. There's a new discovery made. And so I love
[01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:26.290]  the microscope. I love the microscope to view a world, but I want to make sure people are
[01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:32.290]  careful not to start guaranteeing what that world is. It's, it's at the, it's at the tip of the
[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:36.930]  sphere, you know, the forefront. So, yeah. And that's why it's good to have that tool. So you
[01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:42.050]  can see in there and you can start seeing that it takes your mind to a small space because I always
[01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:48.690]  say, you know, like terpenes, the organic compounds of a terpene is tiny. Go to the other end of the
[01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:53.810]  plant. You're talking about those same exudates, you know, to me, that's the opposite end of a
[01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:59.170]  terp. You know, that's where it all happens. So for me, you look at a terpene and you're like,
[01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:04.210]  what is it? You're like, oh, terpene, terpenoid, carbon, hydrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.
[01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:10.850]  Well, fuck that's basic compounds. How is it so far? Like there's just more than we understand.
[01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:15.730]  You know, there's like, we all see it, this plant we're here because the plant, it took over our
[01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:20.530]  life. It's guiding us. It's asking, it's causing us to ask different questions. And more and more
[01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:25.570]  as I get older, I believe that the better life is lived by having better questions, not necessarily
[01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:29.170]  always better answers. It puts you in the pursuit of the right things, not the wrong things. And it
[01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:37.410]  keeps you engaged and grateful and learning. And so I am grateful that our customers feel the same
[01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:42.770]  way. And it means that most of my life is in that lane and it feels really good. So, I mean, my wife,
[01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:47.730]  when I met her, she was already growing and now she's crushing the organic farm. And so when we
[01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:52.930]  go talk after work, it's, yeah, sometimes there's stress involved. Running a greenhouse is crazy and
[01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:57.250]  not very profitable, but I tell you what, it's very intrinsically rewarding and we've learned
[01:26:57.250 --> 01:27:05.250]  some really big life lessons through all of it. So. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the real secrets, I feel
[01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:08.050]  like when, especially when you're bringing some of this stuff to market, when you're talking about
[01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:13.730]  quality compost, was that Ollie Mountain, you know, especially back in the day we were paying
[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:19.490]  more for shipping than the product itself. But at least it worked. You know, happy to do so. Yeah.
[01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:23.730]  That's what I was about to get at. So you show something better, cheaper and closer, I'd buy it.
[01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:27.810]  But that was the problem was you get burned by trying to get the guy down the street off Craigslist
[01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:32.850]  compost. So. Well, there's not a lot of information out there about that company. I mean, some of the
[01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:37.890]  other brands you carry, I feel like they're pretty more well known. What is kind of that secret
[01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:43.570]  sauce with Ollie Mountain? Is it just something that they've been able to perfect? Because I have
[01:27:43.570 --> 01:27:47.410]  obviously nothing to do with the brand. I don't even know who runs the company or anything,
[01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:53.650]  but I will let you guys know that when I was using the bio ag and using bio live products and then
[01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:59.410]  using that compost, things really took off. And I mentioned somebody saw that micro biometer.
[01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:03.170]  You know, I was able to have some of the highest scores that the creator of that
[01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:09.250]  um, uh, when she created that. And part of that secret sauce was the Ollie Mountain compost.
[01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:14.050]  All these special, it's got some weaknesses and it's got some strengths. And I feel that
[01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:20.530]  the strength is that it was process based and it's because I'm not, I don't know the full story,
[01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:24.850]  but the story that I see when you shop. And when I talked to the guy that I've been dealing with
[01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:31.010]  forever, they deal in hardwoods and they're in the heart of an area where a lot of logging and
[01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:35.330]  foresting occurs and they deal with rural areas. So not like industrial waste where you're in the
[01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:41.170]  LA city getting trash and they would have the same farms and large areas of land bringing their waste
[01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:46.370]  as a source to dump it. And the reason why they did that is they had a lot of hardwood waste.
[01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:50.370]  That's very difficult to break down and became a problem for that based on their hardwood business.
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:53.890]  And the other resource they had as fishermen coming in and had a lot of waste from that
[01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:57.890]  industry. You'd have a whole fish, basically the bones and the head and all this stuff.
[01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:04.690]  And so once the fillets are cut and once the hardwood is made into product for barbecuing
[01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:08.370]  and for furniture, all these other things that hardwoods are for, very specialized industry,
[01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:13.570]  you're left with waste. It's difficult to deal with. And so it's this trifecta where you have
[01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:18.290]  an area of the country that's fascinated with being clean, organic, and natural.
[01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:23.730]  And then you have fish from an area that's not farmed fish that's coming in with all the bones
[01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.530]  in there for the phosphorus, which I told you most composts are lacking in calcium phosphorus
[01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:33.810]  and comes with all of that nitrogen energy that actually balances the hardwood to ignite that
[01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:39.490]  carbon to nitrogen to actually get the composting microbial process going. And because it was
[01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:43.890]  hardwood and they knew it would take forever to compost, they actually let it compost for years.
[01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:49.250]  And since there's such a big business, our little blip in the radar has done nothing to their
[01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:54.370]  inventory. So like other parts of the industry that got depleted and quality tanked immediately,
[01:29:54.370 --> 01:29:59.090]  they were sitting on a pool that was much bigger than our little industry could work with. And
[01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:03.250]  they just didn't have a way, like, unless you came and got in a pickup truck, they didn't really
[01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:07.810]  deal with it. Yeah, they had the bags, but for me to buy truckloads of bags and cut them,
[01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:13.090]  it wasn't ideal. So we worked with them to get them to tote them for us. And we were the first
[01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:17.090]  customer that they toted them for. And it took them a while to get a whole process. And to this
[01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:20.130]  day, they're still half-assed about it. It's not even a two-yard tote. It's a one and a half yard
[01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:24.930]  tote, and it's still a pain, but it's heavy. It still fills up the truck weight. So it does work.
[01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:31.730]  And it's full of fish. It's composted forever. It's got hardwood. Hardwood has lignin, which
[01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:36.690]  makes humic. And that's part of the secret of unlocking that humic capacity. And so you have
[01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:41.650]  something that stains your hand black. It's so dark from the humic content. Has that original
[01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:45.730]  nitrogen that popped to get the wood. So it's not stealing from your soil. Has enough of the
[01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:51.650]  phosphorus and micronutrients from the fish. Game changer. But now it does have a little arsenic in
[01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:55.890]  it. I'm not scared. Most commercial facilities have no issue. But if you've been tasked with
[01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.730]  eliminating heavy metals at your commercial facility, Ollie would not be the highest on my
[01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:05.970]  list. Malibu has less heavy metals. It's that much. It's like nothing. And I'm not scared of
[01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:10.210]  it. And we were one of the first ones when Malibu, Randy, I love the guy, but he was basically saying
[01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:17.650]  if you use yard waste compost, you're using trash. And Ollie has yard waste. It's picky,
[01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:22.130]  specific yard waste based on a rural area that's different than people would think. But there are
[01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:27.250]  little bits of plastic occasionally in it. It fucking drives me crazy. But it's an amazing
[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:32.610]  product. And so I take the good with the bad. I understand the full story. And I'm still really
[01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:37.170]  confident with it. But that's what makes it good. That's what's bad about it. That's kind of the
[01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:44.050]  whole story. And then this might be my own personal question, but then you mentioned Malibu.
[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:49.330]  So Malibu is claiming that they do like this biodynamic aspect to their compost. Can you kind
[01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:53.650]  of explain? I mean, for a lot of people, that's more now we're getting into the woo woo metaphysical
[01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:59.330]  aspect. So let's kind of go down that road a little bit. Let's do it. So I still believe
[01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:03.490]  biodynamics. I think I answered this on an FAQ that's probably not even published yet. It'll
[01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:09.410]  come out soon. Loosely discussing it. And what I referenced there was there's this place where
[01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:13.570]  things that are a little woo woo, you have to go to the source. And so people are wondering,
[01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:18.130]  how do I do permaculture? And then you are sorry, biodynamics and the wineries are doing it right,
[01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:23.170]  or the vineyards. And so you look back and you realize that the guy likes talking about Atlantis
[01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:27.250]  and Atlanteans and never even farmed was talking about energy and people adapted it to farming.
[01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.970]  And there's so much to learn, but you can't ignore that some of it was fucking right. And it's weird.
[01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:36.370]  It's eerie that the foliar spray of silica and some of the stuff that they do actually adds up.
[01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:42.050]  So I think it exists because it's irrefutable and it works, but it's also like, really, do we need
[01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:46.130]  to do that? Or does the compost just work? Or do you have to bury it in the ground for a year for
[01:32:46.130 --> 01:32:51.170]  that many cycles? But I've noticed that people that care enough to do that type of system,
[01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:55.170]  anything they touch is going to be amazing because they care that fucking much.
[01:32:55.730 --> 01:33:01.330]  So when you bring those principles of biodynamics into something, oftentimes it means the person
[01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:05.250]  cares. They're putting intent into their stirring. They're spending time with their farm.
[01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:10.050]  Those are, I think, where the results really do come from. But the silica spray, the horsetail,
[01:33:10.050 --> 01:33:15.490]  all that stuff does make sense. All the herbs they use make sense. In the Malibu, I think that it
[01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:21.250]  does. It potentially could be having all those energy effects. I think that they're adding small
[01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:27.250]  amounts of biodynamic herbs to the pile. It's likely not to change the chemical nutrient profile
[01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:33.410]  much, if at all. And I'm guessing if you did one with the biodynamic inputs versus one that
[01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:38.610]  wasn't, it may not make a huge difference. But when you go that route and you work with the
[01:33:38.610 --> 01:33:44.370]  meter, not to just be saying it, but to living it, they're so strict. They won't let... I mean,
[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:49.730]  they're very strict. So now you get a duplicatable, consistent compost that at least has some ethics.
[01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:53.810]  So I still love it, even though I don't love it, even though I do love it. I wish I didn't have to
[01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:58.930]  ship in cow shit, right? But we've gone back and forth. At the end of the day,
[01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:03.330]  growers that have grown in Malibu mixes have never had a heavy metal problem.
[01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:10.290]  And that's something very special. I think that they stuck with that for a long time. And the
[01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:13.810]  reason why is when you look at dairies and how they feed their cattle and everything,
[01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:18.370]  the dairy that they get it from, at least I believe in their Oregon yard, it comes from,
[01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:23.410]  I believe it's... I'm going to forget the names. Horizon is the red bottle. And I believe if you
[01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:27.890]  look up treatment of cattle, it's not very good. But when you look up organic valley,
[01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:32.770]  they're rated extremely high on their treatment of their animals. And they only source their
[01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:39.010]  compost from that organic cattle yard that's fed organic feed and are cared for. Because of that,
[01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:43.890]  I think the vibes are right in the compost and it's consistent batch to batch. And so that becomes
[01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:49.250]  the reason why it's worth it to me. I don't care that it says biodynamic on it. I know people do
[01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:55.170]  care. And because he chose that word, he had to be very transparent in all of his sourcing. But
[01:34:56.770 --> 01:35:01.090]  I'm still halfway in, halfway out in some of the woo-woo stuff. I'm just blown away when some of
[01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:04.770]  the more spiritual stuff does line up with what we're learning with science, like the horsetail,
[01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:11.010]  the silica spray. I'm kind of like, damn, that's pretty cool. So. So is that one of the ones that
[01:35:11.010 --> 01:35:16.690]  Coot will recommend Malibu? Coot's an old curmudgeon. I would say that he'd probably
[01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:21.250]  say don't use Ollie and don't use Malibu to this day, even though he's backed both of them at some
[01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:27.410]  point. I think the reason why is he doesn't want to put his name on something that we could be
[01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:33.170]  fluctuating over time. And his way is just to make your own worm casting. Anytime he's deviated from
[01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:41.090]  that, he's maybe, maybe put his foot in his mouth. That being said, I did a lot of testing on it. We
[01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:45.490]  did tons of testing on Ollie for hundreds of different pathogens. And I do feel that both
[01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:51.250]  Ollie and the Malibu are great. And the reason why is show me something better. It's a tall
[01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:56.530]  fucking order. There's not a lot of good compost on that scale for sure. Yeah. On any scale,
[01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:00.370]  even the guy that has two piles, a lot of times those are worse than the big ones. And the ones
[01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:05.490]  that are really good in a small scale, like meeting small, like enough to support the farms locally.
[01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:10.050]  There's no increase of availability. Once it's gone for the year, it's gone. And there's a lot
[01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:15.730]  of those people. He recommends a red, red Northwest red worms and that guy's still killing
[01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:20.530]  it. But I don't, I think he turned us off because we were drop shipping red worms from him. He's
[01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:25.330]  like, bro, you sell to me and we're done. Like he's not going to let his business get out of
[01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:29.810]  whack. And I really respect that. So that's how I feel, man. Everybody's like, man, I need more,
[01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:35.410]  you said more inputs, more, but it takes time. I'm at that level where I just want to give out
[01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:40.450]  just the best of the best that I would use for myself. And ship the rest to me.
[01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:47.970]  There's a sticking point. I feel like some living soil growers are adverse to talking
[01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:52.210]  about money properly. Money is just another thing. It's energy. It likes to be in motion
[01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:56.850]  and it's a necessary tool. Everything that you could ever own or want today is unfortunately
[01:36:56.850 --> 01:37:00.530]  controlled or owned by someone else. So you have to have relationships. You have to know how to
[01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:07.090]  deal with money instead of hating it. It has to be an energy. And when we look at when you make
[01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:11.970]  quality product and you don't want to scale too fast, the challenges that scale will eventually
[01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:16.690]  still have to come. If the quality is good, you can't discount the quality, but it's hard to say
[01:37:16.690 --> 01:37:20.850]  no to a lot of people. And so you do desire to grow a little bit. And there's some models for
[01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:25.170]  this that Kooten taught me from bread growing, but from bread baking, I'll discuss loosely, but
[01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:29.170]  when you're able, I relate this to a plant. You cannot keep a plant the same.
[01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:36.850]  It's dying or it's growing. And I would say that slow, healthy growth that's strong is the
[01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:40.690]  requirement. Growing too fast and stretchy and getting weak and knocked over in the first wind
[01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:45.970]  storm is not the formula. Same in business. And so a little bit of growth is good. Some decline is
[01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:51.170]  not okay. Quality is important, but man, if you have people that like it, they're going to be
[01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:56.690]  frustrated. You don't have that fire from, you know, and so nature's going to call on you. If
[01:37:56.690 --> 01:38:01.010]  you're solving problems to receive more of that energy and it's up to you, if you step up or if
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:07.250]  you learn to work with other people and have them help. Um, but it's, you have that problem at first
[01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:13.330]  on, on your, like, man, I don't, I want it packaged this way. I want the handle turn that way. I want
[01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:18.770]  it to be like, where are you? Where are you? No, I'm less. I, one of my weaknesses is I'm not as
[01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:24.210]  detail oriented. And so I could care only about what's in the bag and not as much about the label
[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.570]  where other people will have an entire label design before they even know what's going in the
[01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:33.810]  bag. And so I think both are necessary. I realized when we did the J plant speaker cue, having a
[01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:38.610]  pretty label and a name, it sells a lot more. It also brings a lot more attention. So as long as
[01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:45.090]  what's there is quality, then you're not doing any harm, but it does pay to do both. I know that as
[01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:50.610]  a human, I like it when somebody gives me a gift and it's got their little label on it in a jar and
[01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:55.890]  it's some fire herb versus a Ziploc bag. I just feel like whatever, there's some value to
[01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:00.930]  presentation and I suck at it. So I wish I was better. The problems that I had was more,
[01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:05.970]  Oh wow, we sold a truckload now and now there's 10 and I can't make, so we're just going to tell
[01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:08.770]  them it's ours three weeks. That's how long it's going to take. I'm not going to rush it.
[01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:13.250]  And some people hung out and some people didn't. And now what we do is we make it four weeks ahead
[01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:17.570]  of time. So I'm more likely to be lucky by having somebody that wants some, and that's based on a lot
[01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:22.610]  of data. And that data was hard to come by because we had to use computers and logistics and software
[01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:26.530]  developers and everything to make sure that out of a thousand things, all the ingredients are not
[01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:30.690]  spoiled on the ground at the right time, can be mixed with a bill of materials at the proper
[01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:35.570]  percentage and duplicated time in and time out without ever hurting a grower. And the scary
[01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:39.970]  thing when you start a business is you probably feel this about the handle and the ingredient.
[01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:43.970]  It's because you never want to have one customer have one fucking problem that you created for
[01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:51.490]  them. That's a bad day, but it can't stop. So that's the dilemma. So you've been there,
[01:39:51.490 --> 01:39:55.890]  you were packaging your own stuff in your garage. Yeah. We're still doing everything here. So
[01:39:56.610 --> 01:40:00.290]  oil companies, it's some mixer that does it. Everything is in this parking lot,
[01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:05.170]  different buildings, and it's all done for us by us. So we're still learning lessons to this day.
[01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:11.250]  I remember reading one of your early blog posts where you wrote a whole blog post about you had
[01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:16.930]  your first negative review and kind of like broken down. So that obviously affected.
[01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:23.090]  Now we get more, right? Of course, your business has grown, but coming across things in life,
[01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:26.690]  man, you don't normally see that kind of stuff. So I just wanted to put that out there too. I mean,
[01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:30.130]  that was, fuck man, that's probably close to a decade ago.
[01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:36.050]  Yeah. And that's where, man, that was the best time to build a soil. I got to personally
[01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:42.610]  interact with everybody and I had enough spending money because I didn't have any expenses,
[01:40:42.610 --> 01:40:49.330]  no overhead, no employees. But we talked about growth, that dream would have died in a year
[01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:52.770]  had I not said, all right, I can share this with other people. I can be a little more accountable
[01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:58.290]  to my time. Yeah. I'll show up to an office. Things that I was trying to actually get away from
[01:40:58.290 --> 01:41:02.690]  when I started building soil, but I realized the size of the opportunity and the fact that it's
[01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:06.930]  probably the best one that I had. And so I just took it for what it's worth. And it's still the
[01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:12.530]  greatest thing in my life as far as the challenge, like my relationship with my wife and my
[01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:17.010]  relationship with Jiu Jitsu and all that stuff that's outside of here is incredible. But
[01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:24.130]  this is where like what fuels a lot of that. And so for better or worse, it affects me when things
[01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:29.490]  happen here at home, at Jiu Jitsu with my friends. And so as you grow and you have a problem,
[01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:33.170]  a negative view, whatever it is, you just don't want to be the person that blames, that becomes
[01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:40.210]  a victim. You just want to handle that shit, blame yourself and step up. And that's how you get
[01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:43.730]  through everything. It doesn't matter. It's all your fault. And once you realize it's all your
[01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:48.370]  fault, that's either the worst day of your life, or if you look at it differently, the best fucking
[01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:51.730]  day ever, because now you're in charge. You know what I mean?
[01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:58.610]  Yeah. Yeah. Give me the problems, but also, hey, once we succeed, pat me on the back too. So it's
[01:41:58.610 --> 01:42:02.610]  all goes together. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent.
[01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:07.330]  The beauty of being an entrepreneur, honestly, is that you kind of get to pick what you want to do
[01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:11.490]  with your day. And for a lot of us in the underground world, that was more, I mean,
[01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:17.730]  of course the fast money's great, but the longevity of having free time and being able to pick, like
[01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:21.970]  you had mentioned back in the day before I had children, man, in the gym every single day,
[01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:27.170]  seven days a week. I mean, and that would show in your physique. You just had all these extra hours
[01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:33.090]  compared to other individuals. Now moving more into like the entrepreneurial world, getting older.
[01:42:33.090 --> 01:42:39.730]  I see that for our audience that is in their mid twenties or earlier, really, you have something
[01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:44.130]  special here because you're able to take these kinds of shows and run with this kind of stuff.
[01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:49.250]  A lot of the people watching this show, Jeremy, are like what we've been calling A to Z farmers,
[01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:53.970]  meaning not only are they farming the product themselves, but then they're making it into
[01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:57.650]  something. They're using the flour. And then even for a lot of them are now making solventless
[01:42:57.650 --> 01:43:05.090]  products. I mean, even this kid, TJ kid, he's probably my age, TJ, but he's so talented,
[01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:10.530]  man. He was going to some of these earlier like KNF classes and stuff. So it just seemed like the
[01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:18.050]  old people, old heads, old school people, they had these kind of mentors and you had one of those,
[01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:22.770]  man. You had probably the mentor and it kind of shows in the way and the direction that you took
[01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:28.530]  your business. And it's extremely smart to sell the shovels and the pickaxes and stuff. And I don't,
[01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:35.410]  to this day, man, I don't think a lot of people realize it's going to be very hard to be
[01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:41.570]  defined long-term success farming cannabis. I mean, look at it all. I still have a lot of
[01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:47.010]  homies in Oklahoma that are barely making it and a lot of them have crumbled.
[01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:52.770]  Yep. We were in a meeting the other day and I heard that somebody thought we made X millions
[01:43:52.770 --> 01:43:58.770]  of dollars. And I'm like, no, we didn't even profit that year. You hear big numbers like
[01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:01.410]  in cannabis doesn't mean you're going to get rich, right? It means you still have to have
[01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:05.330]  a business model and then you're taxed to hell. And then you realize that you don't have any
[01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:09.570]  people skills and you have to manage a system and that takes seven days a week. Plants don't care.
[01:44:10.530 --> 01:44:14.210]  Man. Yeah. It gets harder. And when the tide goes out, you can really see who's,
[01:44:15.010 --> 01:44:19.010]  you know, who's skinny dipping, who's not wearing any, any clothes, so to speak.
[01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:23.730]  And I never wanted that to be us. Hemp taught us a lot. We saw a lot of feast your famine,
[01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:28.050]  a lot of gold rushers come in and we just kept our base hits with our online customers and kept
[01:44:28.050 --> 01:44:33.090]  doing that. We had some good hemp customers locally, but had we relied on that and said,
[01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:36.610]  Ooh, we can make this our business. We would have been out of business within one year.
[01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:40.530]  You know, when we have new markets that open up and there's a whole bunch of commercial orders,
[01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:44.450]  it's like all these new soil companies come out of the woodwork right around them to support them
[01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:48.850]  and then go out of business when they're all out. And now there's a limitation on how much
[01:44:48.850 --> 01:44:53.650]  peat moss is available to purchase. And it's an allocation game. And so I just feel like we
[01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:57.890]  dodged a lot of bullets getting to where we're at. I feel really grateful, but I'm also recognizing
[01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:01.650]  that opportunity and get a lot more serious about leveling up. You know, like you said,
[01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:05.010]  I don't have all this free time being single and everything. So I'm more disciplined. I'm
[01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:10.130]  listening to audible. I read probably three, four books a week just because I have a little bit of a
[01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:14.850]  commute to work. And so that goes for the garden. A lot of our customers do the same thing.
[01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:20.690]  So they always want to know more because our customers like that. And I do, and our YouTube
[01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:24.610]  is going to continue forever. It fills that void where we constantly are giving more knowledge,
[01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:28.530]  talking about more knowledge. And so it's just this flywheel. We're just going to keep pumping.
[01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:33.170]  And I'm really happy that we got to discuss a lot of stuff. I don't even talk about, you had some
[01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:38.290]  unbelievable questions. You know, I feel like it's because you, uh, you've been around since back
[01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:43.010]  then and you've seen a lot of this. And I feel like when I talked to some of my friends and I
[01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:47.810]  talked to AJ, we're able to have these conversations and reminisce, but most of the people that come
[01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:53.330]  into the game now, I've, you know, this is all news to them. Like, because I realized now it's
[01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:56.610]  been a decade. I've honestly feel like it's been a couple of days. Like I just started,
[01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:03.090]  but some time has passed. And so some of this information has been lost and now it's like
[01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:07.570]  people take it for granted that there's a Kutz mix, you know, or whatever it is. That's kind of
[01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:12.770]  known now that was like fucking magic. I mean, someone told me about biochar. I was like, what,
[01:46:13.650 --> 01:46:18.770]  you know, everything that you told us was like another rabbit hole, worm castings, biochar,
[01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:24.450]  fulvic acid. I mean, there are so many things that to this day are still not very well understood.
[01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:27.570]  And I think that when you grow up where everything's a cookie cutter, there's an
[01:46:27.570 --> 01:46:31.090]  answer for everything. You just do what you're told. It's kind of crazy to find out there's
[01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:35.490]  this much unknown shit still happening and something so important as soil. And I thought
[01:46:35.490 --> 01:46:39.970]  build a soil would be about closet grows and don't get me wrong. It is, but soil is one of
[01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:44.930]  the biggest issues our economy is going to face and food production and, and logistics from that.
[01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:49.810]  And so I think there's more to this for all of us that are learning about this soil stuff.
[01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:56.690]  Yeah, a hundred percent, man. A hundred percent. And so when just talking, man, we talked about
[01:46:56.690 --> 01:47:00.370]  one legend in the game, you know, we're, you know, educating folks and I see y'all,
[01:47:00.370 --> 01:47:06.850]  you got a little legend series. Duke was on here not too long ago and you got his soil and testing
[01:47:06.850 --> 01:47:11.250]  and you got a brother, Jay plant speaker. So you got anybody else you guys are kind of
[01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:13.730]  looking at working with?
[01:47:13.730 --> 01:47:18.050]  Really? It just comes naturally. We don't pick and choose anything. We're not trying to push it,
[01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:22.050]  but one of the goals of build a soil that's worked well as we like
[01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:27.170]  intrapreneurship, not just Entra. What I mean by that is if someone's working for me,
[01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:33.250]  all my retail employees have a business. Not everybody in the company, but because they're
[01:47:33.250 --> 01:47:37.730]  around me a lot and they realize this is a vehicle. A lot of them will try and create a
[01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:43.810]  product that's based out of their own knowledge base. And so when I find someone where there's a
[01:47:43.810 --> 01:47:51.010]  connection, so Kevin from root wise was talking to Tommy Duke diamond and before he got locked up,
[01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:55.410]  he turned himself in for the guns issue. It's like, you know, everybody knows about it. He,
[01:47:56.130 --> 01:48:01.570]  that conversation was like sparked then and I didn't know what was going to happen. And I just,
[01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:05.810]  I knew I was like, well, he's just grows in like soil. Not a lot of breeders do that.
[01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:11.010]  And people really like him. And so I liked the vibe. Like I would be down for sure. And I didn't
[01:48:11.010 --> 01:48:16.450]  even really know him. And so I didn't know that that seed was really planted. And then I get a
[01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:21.410]  letter, which I have right here from Tommy from, you know, where he was locked up. And it's like,
[01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:26.050]  bro, I'm coming out and I got dreams with me and I'm going to be coming right back up and I'm going
[01:48:26.050 --> 01:48:31.570]  to do my thing. And I'm like, fuck. Yeah. I want to be a part of that. I felt honored. So.
[01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:38.450]  Can I dive deeper into that? Because Duke is probably somebody that I almost look up to him
[01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:45.170]  like a big brother. I actually, I was able to visit him during when he was incarcerated and
[01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:51.730]  he brought that up to me, man. So I actually text him before we went live for the show and asked him
[01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:55.970]  if I could bring that up. Cause I do want to promote that. I think that Duke is somebody
[01:48:55.970 --> 01:49:04.450]  that represents kind of more of what I used to value, the respect, that dude is as real as they
[01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:09.330]  get. And, you know, and when you are locked up, you have to do certain things in life. So to come
[01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:15.250]  out even just intact is something that should be commended. And I'm proud that, you know,
[01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:18.850]  a lot of individuals probably will never have to go through that because of the way that
[01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:24.690]  life and human beings are kind of viewing cannabis. But Mr. Duke Diamond is somebody
[01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:28.290]  that needs to be a- Federal camp to Jeremy.
[01:49:29.650 --> 01:49:33.570]  Like if he's coming out with his soil system, then I think if you're newer to this, you want
[01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:38.930]  to try out a new system. Obviously I'm a little biased. I think that's somebody that you should
[01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:45.810]  support because he's been one of those dudes from day one that, you know, he's kind of in a way also
[01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:49.970]  taken me under his wing. So I, you know, I got kicked in the face a couple of times, but-
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:55.330]  To experience the fire, right? He sells them a seed that he worked really fucking hard on. We
[01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:59.490]  know like to breed, it's like there's pollen chucking, but then there's like actual work.
[01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:05.490]  The dude's put in work. And so when you make genetics and you're like, bro, when you grow
[01:50:05.490 --> 01:50:09.810]  this, I want you to grow how I grow. And I want it to be fire. And then he'd be telling, all right,
[01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:12.370]  so you got to go get this and you got to ferment it. Then you got to start with that. You got to
[01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:18.370]  get all these. They're like, nope. Or yeah, I did one of those things. And so I believe his vision
[01:50:18.370 --> 01:50:22.370]  was not to start a company. We haven't even talked fucking money. I've tried to get him to
[01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:25.970]  say like, well, how do we do this when it all, you know, because it gets serious and we want to make
[01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:30.210]  sure that the way I do it is we talk about it up front and that check will be for the rest of their
[01:50:30.210 --> 01:50:35.250]  life if we're selling the product. It's guaranteed. And so it's important. We haven't even talked
[01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:40.210]  about it because he trusts me, I trust him, but it's about the customer. And so his vision from
[01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:45.250]  what I can tell is they get some seeds from him and they follow growing by using his soil and
[01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:49.650]  listen to some of his methods. They're going to get the quality that he wants them, the flavors
[01:50:49.650 --> 01:50:54.130]  that he wants. And so he'll add a few things. I'm guessing I may be a part of it. I may not only if
[01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:59.970]  I can add value that will be part of his style. But what I was really happy to be a part of, and
[01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:04.210]  I'm still, that's why we're still testing it. Okay. This is not guaranteed to come out anytime
[01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:09.730]  soon. It's a likely to because of the data, but his blessing has to be a hundred percent on it.
[01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:17.410]  And that's because I not forcefully, I kind of demanded that he take a look at the ingredients
[01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:21.570]  and truly decide if we were going to, because Build-A-Soil can't put certain ingredients in
[01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:27.570]  our recipes. And he was flexible enough to trust me that I would respect his recipe enough to do
[01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:33.650]  a good service to it when we changed a couple of ingredients based on where they come from and the
[01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:38.450]  potential contamination sources. And so we've all learned a lot. So I think he's trusting me,
[01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:43.090]  but I need to trust that it has the same result. One of the key differences is when you make an
[01:51:43.090 --> 01:51:47.490]  old school super soil, there is a lot of fast nitrogen from blood meals and guanos, and you
[01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:53.170]  won't like they'll grow faster and veg without, without you having to be, you know, the microbe
[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:58.930]  dance, like whisperer, so to speak. So I suggested that maybe he combines using an amino acid with
[01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:04.210]  his type soil recipe to get that fast growth that he wants. But I'm considering messing around with
[01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:09.170]  some of the slow release organics alive to maybe produce some of that pop in a clean way.
[01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:15.730]  Otherwise we loaded down his soil and our first couple of batches were like, not that they weren't
[01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:21.250]  going to work. They're just too much shit through it. Yeah. And two spiked in certain areas where
[01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:25.730]  calcium didn't come through where I wanted it because of the others. And so we did a lot of
[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:32.290]  lab testing through variations and leveraging the data instead of six months of growing every time
[01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:35.410]  sped that process up, but it's no replacement for growing a plant.
[01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:41.810]  And so I think we knocked the cover off as far as getting the profile like spicier than 3.0,
[01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:45.730]  but not out of balance. And so I think it'll be the most potent soil we've ever made.
[01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:47.410]  So then now you're
[01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:51.410]  still, so we'll see what he says, but his last photo that I saw, look fire,
[01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:56.290]  they're getting growing in it. So either he's going to say, look at, I'd like a little more
[01:52:56.290 --> 01:53:01.810]  drainage, or I think that it's didn't make it through flower. Like I'd like, we'll address
[01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:05.410]  some of that stuff against the data and against his experience before it's released. But
[01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:11.250]  that's what happens before release something. That's why the Q took forever. And there was a
[01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:16.930]  big, I think, in my opinion, an unfortunate opinion for how that was released. And some
[01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:21.890]  of the information was withheld from Jay, as far as buying a kilo versus the potency. And part of
[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:26.530]  that, I didn't understand what's going on at the time was because we were very scared to talk about
[01:53:26.530 --> 01:53:30.370]  any of the pesticide claims that's happened and to make, because it's a labeled product and we do not
[01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:35.490]  sell pesticides. And so the desire to not do that became some secret where if you bought some
[01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:40.530]  amount and that was perceived as like a sales thing, well, I know the percentage he makes,
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:44.770]  he doesn't, wouldn't make enough to want someone to buy a kilo to make a whole bunch of money.
[01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:53.490]  But at the end of the day, the system of having the legends, I want to make sure that when we get
[01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:59.490]  a legend, I know that they've got my back and that I do trust their integrity and that we can scale
[01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:04.210]  that model together. But it's also natural. And I don't know, Tommy, you know that well, Duke,
[01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:09.410]  I'm also trusting the peers around me and the guidance that we have to do this right. And we're
[01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:14.530]  not always going to get it right. But something tells me this Duke Diamond soil is going to be
[01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:18.690]  something special. So we'll see. Only time will tell. We'll be honest about what he thinks the
[01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:21.730]  results are. And that's part of the reason why it's going to be special if it works. So.
[01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:27.730]  I feel like he's an artist, like a raw artist that just needs a producer such as yourself.
[01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:34.210]  You know, like draw your analogy or whatever, but it's somebody that where you just kind of show him
[01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:41.730]  the business aspects of the ropes here because his mind is unbelievably brilliant. And the part
[01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:46.530]  that I really admire about it is because most of it is street side, you know, street wise, just,
[01:54:46.530 --> 01:54:51.170]  you know, up, just understands things on a whole other level and then growing it from that. So
[01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:56.610]  then to take it to a soil system where now, you know, he can kind of sit back, you open up the
[01:54:56.610 --> 01:55:01.970]  books, if you will, and let him kind of like run with stuff to where he now gets to be the artist.
[01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:05.490]  He was curious from that perspective, just like you said, he's like, bro, I know this works,
[01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:10.130]  but I'm curious to see what the lab says. Right. The challenge is I couldn't unlock that for him
[01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:15.570]  because I would not use every ingredient exactly the same, but we can read between the lines and
[01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:20.770]  we know what a good soil profile looks like. And so we'll see. Time will tell. Like I said,
[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:24.770]  I'm not trying to push something and blow smoke on something that's not available yet. But
[01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:30.610]  the way that this is, has the synchronicity, the universe is behind it. I'm telling you.
[01:55:30.610 --> 01:55:35.490]  And the fact that the science is lining up behind it now, and it's been a year in progress and we're
[01:55:35.490 --> 01:55:39.890]  not doing anything fast these days. It's like, gotta be right. I think it's going to crush.
[01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:45.010]  I'm hesitant to confuse people by having multiple soil offerings, but at the same time,
[01:55:45.010 --> 01:55:48.290]  I don't care. Right. We'll find a way to educate and we'll just go for it. So.
[01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:52.450]  Well, let's get, put it out there, man. And let the people, they'll, they'll blend it. They'll
[01:55:52.450 --> 01:55:56.610]  mix it. They'll find a new mix between the two. You know, you know how it is.
[01:55:56.610 --> 01:56:00.050]  Oh, dude, this community will definitely tell you if you're fucking up, but they'll definitely tell
[01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:05.010]  you when you're doing right. So it's good. Yeah, definitely. But yeah, I like how you guys are
[01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:10.530]  definitely going through the steps. How cool is that? That the breeders actually, you know,
[01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:15.810]  using that soil as testing and tuning, and then you guys are putting it out. I think that's,
[01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:20.930]  that's pretty dope. I think that there is the epigenetics of the seed being
[01:56:21.650 --> 01:56:26.770]  grown in the same soil, bred in the same soil. Then the end grower might grow that in the same
[01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:31.010]  soil. I know we're not bringing the terroir into it, but it's almost like getting that local cut.
[01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:36.130]  If you can get a seed bred in the soil, then you grow it in the same soil. It seems almost
[01:56:36.130 --> 01:56:44.450]  kind of like woo woo, but there's something about that evolution of like, everybody knows when you
[01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:47.570]  grow a cut and it comes into your house and you grow it your way a couple more times, then it's
[01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:51.810]  good. But like that first time, depending on how that person grow and health, like you always got
[01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:56.050]  to give it a couple, you know, and I swear, like it dials into your system. So if somebody's already
[01:56:56.050 --> 01:57:00.450]  on your system, it goes to suppose that maybe it's already a little more dialed for you. So.
[01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:04.530]  Yeah. And vice versa, you know, right away when something just isn't for you, you know,
[01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:09.170]  sometimes you get that plan or that cut and it just doesn't, just doesn't do well for you.
[01:57:12.130 --> 01:57:15.090]  Oh man, this has been really good. You guys, it's good.
[01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:19.170]  I know you probably got a lot of stuff to do, brother, Jeremy. We appreciate you.
[01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:24.450]  I do, but honestly, I've not thought about the time until now. I've just been really
[01:57:24.450 --> 01:57:30.370]  enjoying our conversation and to be transparent, Marco, I wasn't positive if I would, our
[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:34.610]  interaction before and the timing, and there was a post about whether I'd follow through or show it
[01:57:34.610 --> 01:57:41.090]  up. And I took that personal because I really do feel that my word is my bond. We had a good
[01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:44.210]  conversation and I'm actually really grateful that I showed up. So.
[01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:49.170]  Yeah. And me too, bro, because listen, I took, I, you know, I'm like in my mind,
[01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:52.770]  man, here we go. Somebody, you know, following through, you know, how it is in this.
[01:57:52.770 --> 01:57:53.330]  No, I get it.
[01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.970]  I will say.
[01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:56.290]  I understand from your shoes, so I get it.
[01:57:56.290 --> 01:58:00.610]  Yeah. And now that we've talked and even behind the scenes, bro, we're at 100.
[01:58:00.610 --> 01:58:04.530]  So everybody needs to understand that I've always been a hundred and I'm still, I am,
[01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:05.570]  we'll build a soil. So.
[01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:10.050]  Cool. Thank you so much. You guys have any more questions? Anything you want to talk about for
[01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:11.330]  our dip? I don't have to just bounce.
[01:58:11.650 --> 01:58:16.530]  I wanted to know, have you ever spoken to Mitch Sanasa? It seems like he fell off the face of
[01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:17.650]  the earth and to be honest.
[01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:21.970]  Yeah, I talked to him just recently. Not, no good, you know, conversation, but at least
[01:58:21.970 --> 01:58:25.170]  shouted him out, said what's up because he almost exploded himself recently.
[01:58:26.050 --> 01:58:34.210]  And he almost died. He almost blew himself up. So he's known as a hoodoo now and he does a
[01:58:34.210 --> 01:58:39.650]  whole bunch of cool shit and he makes stuff that are like spells and other things that are based
[01:58:39.730 --> 01:58:44.450]  on energy and witchcraft. And he had this whole like copper still, and he was making,
[01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:48.290]  dude, talk about living soil concoctions. He's gone to other levels and the ingredients matter.
[01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:55.170]  And he was making this thing in his kitchen and the copper still exploded in his fucking face.
[01:58:55.170 --> 01:58:59.330]  He showed the pictures on his Instagram, like the whole kitchen's basically like a bomb went off.
[01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:04.930]  And he was in the hospital, fully recovered, is doing great. Had no major injuries, like
[01:59:05.730 --> 01:59:10.050]  really, really got lucky. And when I saw that, I messaged him like, bro, I'm so like glad to hear
[01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:14.370]  that you're okay. And it kind of made me rethink about the whole thing. And I've actually got,
[01:59:14.370 --> 01:59:20.050]  if I have it here, I've got this crazy book that I talked to him about back in the day that I found
[01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:24.530]  at my dad's house when he passed away. And it's the encyclopedic outline of Masonic,
[01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:30.850]  Hermetic, Kabbalistic, like it is a crazy manly P. Hall book with beautiful illustrations. And
[01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:36.690]  he was one of the only guys that I ever talked to, oh, this is like a foldout one,
[01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:41.810]  that knew what this book was and all the vibes behind it and all the crazy shit. So
[01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:46.850]  anyways, it makes sense that he got into some of that stuff. He's always been very deep on some of
[01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:51.490]  the ancient knowledge. So if you have a chance, reach out and say what's up. Last I talked to him
[01:59:51.490 --> 01:59:57.410]  industry-wise was when he was with Adam Dunshaw. And I think he worked for Breeder for a little
[01:59:57.410 --> 02:00:03.730]  while after that. And then he literally 180'd got like stopped smoking just to get his head right.
[02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:08.450]  And then just changed his entire life. And now he still burns. Like I know Mitch, I'm sure he does,
[02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:14.290]  but he really, like a lot of us went in deep and just said, what will make me happy and do with my
[02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:18.290]  life? And he's doing something different. I know. And I can tell that that vibe is still there.
[02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:23.650]  When I first spoke to him, it was like, I think it was incredible on IC Mag. Cause he had that
[02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:27.970]  sliding glass, incredible pipe that people use. He invented that shit. Had a biz, like did the
[02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:33.410]  guys done so many cool things. So yeah, I remember reading this book. Yeah. Like a fish. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:38.290]  I still have that little tiny book. That, that book's pretty fire. But anyway, man, like, so,
[02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:42.530]  you know, during those times he would ask you questions. I mean, those were talking about old
[02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:47.970]  school. I remember like Bodie, you know, there's like green Bodie and then there's Bodie seats.
[02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:51.090]  You're kind of confused on that, but Bodie's a different individual,
[02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:56.610]  real recluse from what I understand. I mean, Mitch would just ask certain questions, man,
[02:00:56.610 --> 02:01:02.210]  to still to this day that I just kind of almost like have, I guess, filed away in my brain.
[02:01:02.210 --> 02:01:06.290]  And some of those things were some of the interviews with you and Dr. Lane Eningham,
[02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:10.930]  where she's kind of explaining that microbial world, man. And then, you know, when they start
[02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:17.250]  to interview Coots and Jeff Lowenfels, I mean, you could basically, instead of reading a,
[02:01:17.250 --> 02:01:21.570]  you know, a hundred books, especially since this information at that time was so new,
[02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:25.650]  you know, you could watch a few videos and boom, you know, your head would be exploding.
[02:01:25.650 --> 02:01:30.210]  Mendo Dope, the street team at least at that time, they were going around interviewing like
[02:01:30.210 --> 02:01:35.810]  underground growers and this dude, Minnesota Nice, another guy still can't ever, Mitch Sonassa,
[02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:39.170]  Minnesota Nice. You know, those are people I would love to personally interview because they've
[02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:45.250]  changed, they changed my life. Like I, we were growing boof in our little, in our little group
[02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:49.010]  until we started to understand that the microbial world was something different.
[02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:52.690]  See, I didn't love Minnesota Nice. And all of a sudden I was like, bro, he's doing sprouted
[02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:57.730]  CTs and shit. Like this guy knows, you know, and it's like, how does he know? Like there was like
[02:01:57.730 --> 02:02:02.610]  all these little pockets of information all over the country that seemed to sprout up, you know,
[02:02:02.610 --> 02:02:07.970]  around kind of the same time. And those are the guys that definitely deserve the credit. And so
[02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:11.650]  that's something I've always liked about the kind of your approach as well, is you always gave
[02:02:11.650 --> 02:02:16.850]  credit where credit was due. And I think that aspect is kind of where Marco and I like, and I
[02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:21.010]  love that people are willing to say like the microbes have stepped on and all, you know, I mean,
[02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:25.330]  these are, these are terms that I think more people understand when you kind of put it that way.
[02:02:25.330 --> 02:02:30.690]  Like if I'm spending, you know, a lot of money on this microbial life or, you know, especially the
[02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:34.850]  microalgae fungi in the day, and you then you, when you were saying you can do some research and
[02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:39.250]  you find out there's only a couple of plants making this stuff. So everybody's got their own
[02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:43.410]  little formula coming from the same plug. And so that was the kind of stuff that I loved learning
[02:02:43.410 --> 02:02:48.450]  back in the day. Yep. And we still love that. And so to this day, we're presented with new products.
[02:02:48.450 --> 02:02:53.330]  We just read the label, realize it's repackaged bullshit, or it's just some fly by night again
[02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:58.370]  company. But also when you read a label, sometimes something blows you away. You're like, wow,
[02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:04.450]  really? You did that? Interesting. I have to go do research now. And so anybody that, you know,
[02:03:04.450 --> 02:03:07.890]  I'm always recommended stuff. I'm constantly researching it. I feel like you guys are
[02:03:07.890 --> 02:03:12.530]  probably the same way. And you guys ever have me on again or talk about something specific. I'm down.
[02:03:13.410 --> 02:03:16.690]  I really appreciate you guys having me on. Yeah, man. Thank you. Appreciate you.
[02:03:17.250 --> 02:03:22.050]  Usually we open it up to questions, Jeremy, just real quick at the end. So I kind of wanted to keep
[02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:26.770]  that tradition going. Yeah, no problem. Ken, if you kind of wanted to limit those questions,
[02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:30.450]  obviously, I'm sure we have a lot to date. Pre-read them, Ken. Only the good ones.
[02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:36.290]  Oh, sure. Now you tell me. Well, I have to read them as I go here.
[02:03:39.490 --> 02:03:43.010]  What is your elevation of your grow site, Jeremy?
[02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:45.810]  Oh, so we grow right here in our store. Any customer can come in and see it.
[02:03:46.450 --> 02:03:51.250]  And as far as the YouTube series, and that's part of that, keeping us honest, it's right here live.
[02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:53.650]  In fact, I haven't kind of like got to go check on the seedlings before I leave.
[02:03:54.210 --> 02:04:00.610]  But we're at about 5,800 feet, I think, right here. 5,500. I live slightly higher elevation
[02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:04.290]  than the office here, but almost about high. Cool.
[02:04:05.890 --> 02:04:11.970]  And then in the absence of sustainable source, Pete, what does Jeremy think of using cocoa
[02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:17.010]  put through a worm bin inoculated? Sure. And you can use cocoa, to be clear.
[02:04:17.010 --> 02:04:20.370]  It's just it does cause a different effect on the soil. I don't feel it's quite as
[02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:24.370]  good for living soil, but you can totally get away with it. And we've done that at the lab
[02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:27.810]  by having commercial grows that said, can you make that exact recipe with cocoa?
[02:04:27.810 --> 02:04:31.090]  And we've mixed it. And since I was curious, I would send it to the lab.
[02:04:31.090 --> 02:04:34.930]  The CEC would come back lower, wouldn't hold quite as much nutrients, and it may be
[02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:39.010]  a little bit off in profile, but not enough to cause any concern. You'd still get good results
[02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:42.930]  because we're always after the best. We don't compromise for what we think is the best,
[02:04:42.930 --> 02:04:48.050]  even though there are reasons to do different things. In fact, we just made a pit moss soil,
[02:04:48.370 --> 02:04:52.690]  pit moss soil, a Pete free soil that I had pit moss for a while. I just couldn't figure out
[02:04:52.690 --> 02:04:57.250]  how to make a good soil out of it. So we finally came up with the time to try it again. We sent
[02:04:57.250 --> 02:05:02.050]  it to the lab. I'm waiting for the results right now and we'll find out. But the soil actually
[02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:06.450]  looks beautiful where it starts off looking like shredded paper. So cocoa will work.
[02:05:07.570 --> 02:05:11.730]  Alternative to that, you can work it through the worms, but a lot of what we're getting out
[02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:16.690]  of the cocoa corn, the peat moss is the long fiber, the texture. And so if you work it through
[02:05:16.690 --> 02:05:21.410]  the worms, that's kind of worm bedding. And then you're going to be making worm castings and yeah,
[02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:27.330]  it works. It does. A lot of people have made a compost without adding much ingredient to it.
[02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:32.290]  And that could be a replacement for peat. What I mean is a non-nutrient fortified,
[02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:37.410]  very basic compost of like straw grass or something that's enough carbon to nitrogen,
[02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:43.250]  but is not loaded in nutrients can be a really good texture for building garden soil. And then
[02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:47.970]  to that, if you don't have pumice, you can always add the old recipe would be sand and some of your
[02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:54.210]  own compost, right? And you can make a soil that would work. The margin for air will be tighter.
[02:05:54.210 --> 02:05:59.650]  If you have a heavy soil and you have a hundred percent compost, not peat, it might take the fluff
[02:05:59.650 --> 02:06:04.050]  out of it. And we all know for some reason, you can grow a plant that's 10 foot tall in the soil
[02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:07.570]  with no air in there. And you put it in a little pot and it's like, everything's got to be perfect
[02:06:07.570 --> 02:06:13.650]  now. So as soon as you put it in the container, that texture is important. And even like a fine,
[02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:19.090]  like a woody compost, as long as it's finished, it doesn't take nitrogen. It can act like peat
[02:06:19.090 --> 02:06:25.810]  moss. So peat moss isn't perfectly required, but it is hard to replace when you get used to exactly
[02:06:25.810 --> 02:06:31.570]  what it does do. So, and that's one of the biggest things when you're creating a soil, you need to
[02:06:31.570 --> 02:06:35.890]  know exactly what you're putting in there or else it's restructure everything.
[02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:40.530]  Yeah. Yeah. And if you're going to do that and you don't want to spend money at the lab,
[02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:45.250]  there's an easy way. Mix up five, six, six percentages of what you have differently.
[02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:49.170]  Plant some plants into it, watch them and pick your favorite. The plants don't lie. If it works,
[02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:53.570]  it'll at least work. You can get anything to work. I'm not saying it's, if you get something to work,
[02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:57.650]  that it'll work for everybody. You might be just watering it just right and unlock it.
[02:06:57.970 --> 02:07:01.570]  Yeah. So when it has to go to market, you want to make sure everybody's going to have success,
[02:07:01.570 --> 02:07:05.890]  but you can make almost anything work. If you know what you're doing, just like a chef, right?
[02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:10.130]  You don't have to have filet mignon, give them the worst cut of meat. They can make a fire meal
[02:07:10.130 --> 02:07:17.570]  out of that. So at least the good ones anyway. Yeah. At least the good ones. Right. So this one
[02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:23.330]  is, is almost a, for me personally, cause I live in Canada, but are you guys shipping to Canada
[02:07:23.410 --> 02:07:28.690]  again? No, we had to get our house in order first. And what I mean by that is just, we,
[02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:32.690]  it expanded not in a way where we grew overnight, but we changed our shipping facility where we
[02:07:32.690 --> 02:07:36.770]  were literally having like, you'd hear tape guns just next to my office. And it wasn't very
[02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:39.970]  systematized and people would be running around looking for inventory. And so as we got a certain
[02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:44.290]  number of oars per day, or we'd have one busy day, it would be embarrassing. We couldn't keep up.
[02:07:44.850 --> 02:07:51.250]  So we built a facility, or we took where we made soil. We built racks in there and made it like a
[02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:55.970]  fully professional fulfillment center with wave picking and barcode scanners. And we self-funded
[02:07:55.970 --> 02:08:00.450]  that and learned every step of the way and coded the software that goes into it and made sure that
[02:08:00.450 --> 02:08:04.850]  it'll work in a manner that will keep everything how we want. Where first in first out microbials
[02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:10.530]  that could expire, like all the shit we have to deal with. And Canada, because of our size,
[02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:15.650]  started clipping packages and pallets and started losing tons of money. And it was clear that if we
[02:08:15.650 --> 02:08:19.730]  did not line up with the right tariff codes and open it up, we were ready. We were just going to
[02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:24.850]  create major problems for our customers, lose lots of money and have no fun. But to this day,
[02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:30.290]  when someone asks, all I want to do is bend every rule we have and ship them something. So it's high
[02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:35.170]  on our list, but it's not our weakest link for serving our existing customers. When we get that
[02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:40.530]  right, the very next thing we're doing is unlocking Canada. And we had hired a manager to run our
[02:08:40.530 --> 02:08:45.170]  fulfillment facility who was not the right person, just not the right person for that seat, right?
[02:08:45.170 --> 02:08:50.130]  Good guy still. But one of the goals that he was tasked with was working with a professional
[02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:53.890]  company that gives you all the tariff codes, goes through your inventory, then provides insurance
[02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:57.170]  that if they're wrong, they'll still cover it while you get it right. And so that was going to
[02:08:57.170 --> 02:09:02.850]  be our unlock. And we were going to do it within four weeks while we fired him. And we brought in
[02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:07.810]  a new manager that I believe is going to be the guy. We did that process much slower. And I think
[02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:14.770]  we got somebody that's great. And that'll be on his list again soon. So. Well, that's fantastic
[02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:20.690]  because I would love to be able to promote that here in Canada because I love what you do,
[02:09:20.690 --> 02:09:25.090]  but then I've been following you for years, brother. Thank you. And part of why we want to
[02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:28.370]  keep teaching is we realize there's people all over the world that cannot buy our products that
[02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:33.410]  want to unlock the information. And so we will always teach what would replace what's the best
[02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:38.450]  to do to make your own any of that stuff. All the while knowing people with a family and a full-time
[02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:42.050]  job are going to wait until they can do it maybe a little bit easier. And I want everybody to grow
[02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:47.010]  their own food and their own herb. And that's important to me. And so that will be part of
[02:09:47.010 --> 02:09:52.690]  our process. Fantastic. Marco, I saw you, you reached over. Did you have something to add?
[02:09:53.490 --> 02:09:59.490]  No, no. I was just going to eat some of my watermelon that I grew. Speaking of growing food.
[02:09:59.490 --> 02:10:06.530]  Yeah. Talk about living alkaline. Oh yeah. Yeah. So here's a good one for you, Jeremy. What about
[02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:16.690]  the rice hulls from brewery supply? Is that assuming they would be clean? Nope. No. I guess
[02:10:16.690 --> 02:10:19.730]  you could probably assume they're doing some testing, but they're not selling the rice hole.
[02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:23.730]  They're just using it as an ingredient thereof in very small amounts. So I doubt like heavy metal
[02:10:23.730 --> 02:10:27.730]  would be their biggest concern. And I don't think they'd be worried about germination since they're
[02:10:27.730 --> 02:10:32.210]  soaking it. And then it's kind of spent when it's done. So I don't know if it's going to be the
[02:10:32.210 --> 02:10:39.090]  same. And I think that the best way I can answer this is I do not know. And I would rather you do
[02:10:39.090 --> 02:10:45.250]  the research to make sure. And I think that if it's a brewery here locally, most of them do not
[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:50.450]  order organic rice holes or organic malted barley or any of that. So I'd have to see where they're
[02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:56.930]  buying from. I feel like there's only a few big houses and they do offer organic and non-organic
[02:10:56.930 --> 02:11:02.610]  of their barley. So maybe they have a premium, non-premium rice hole. I'm not positive. It could
[02:11:02.610 --> 02:11:07.090]  be they're using the exact same brand we're using. And then you're just getting it spent, so to speak,
[02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:12.850]  which is great because now it's recycled. But I don't know. I'd be lying if I said I did.
[02:11:12.850 --> 02:11:16.450]  And you may be able to go if they're going to be kind enough to give you their old
[02:11:17.490 --> 02:11:21.410]  leftovers and you maybe can talk to them about, hey man, where do you guys get this? Can I see
[02:11:21.970 --> 02:11:22.610]  the data sheet?
[02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:24.610]  They're not brewing beer. They don't care.
[02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.210]  Yeah, exactly. No big deal.
[02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:27.090]  Yep. No big deal.
[02:11:28.290 --> 02:11:32.930]  And Jeremy, thank you very much for your honesty. It's rare to find somebody that's
[02:11:33.570 --> 02:11:35.730]  able to admit they don't know something.
[02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:40.050]  Well, I smoke a lot of herb. And if you start lying, I come back to bite you real quick. You
[02:11:40.050 --> 02:11:42.690]  don't remember shit. So just tell the truth. You don't have to worry.
[02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:45.810]  Exactly. You don't have to remember what the lie was.
[02:11:45.810 --> 02:11:46.690]  You don't have to remember. Yeah.
[02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:49.730]  Yep. Because I was a crafty little kid.
[02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:53.970]  Don't tell anybody. Don't tell the wife, especially.
[02:11:54.130 --> 02:11:54.690]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:11:55.810 --> 02:12:00.850]  Can you address some of the challenges for cultivators using living soil in a commercial
[02:12:00.850 --> 02:12:03.730]  setting? Huge fan and support what you do.
[02:12:04.930 --> 02:12:07.730]  You know, I think logistics, a lot of the living soil growers that started,
[02:12:07.730 --> 02:12:10.690]  they were turning around a hydro grow.
[02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:14.530]  So the door wouldn't even fit the super sack or the bed.
[02:12:14.530 --> 02:12:17.490]  They'd be carrying buckets, hundreds of yards to scoop and dump.
[02:12:17.490 --> 02:12:21.890]  And so a big part of logistics is you do repetitive tasks a lot.
[02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:24.370]  And if they're time consuming, they become expensive.
[02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:26.530]  And if you have to have a big team of people, it's a problem.
[02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:29.890]  But living soil solves all of those. If you also know what you're doing,
[02:12:29.890 --> 02:12:33.490]  one person can manage a huge grow when they're in big beds and they're not always,
[02:12:33.490 --> 02:12:35.410]  you know, dying because of the system.
[02:12:37.330 --> 02:12:44.370]  So challenges. People are scared that if the bed goes bad, they have to replace the entire thing.
[02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:47.490]  So people will start with containers. Some will jump right to beds.
[02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:50.290]  I've never seen a facility had to dump a whole bed because of a
[02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:53.890]  infection or something that wouldn't jump from pot to pot.
[02:12:53.890 --> 02:12:56.130]  So I feel like just being good is important regardless.
[02:12:57.810 --> 02:13:02.530]  Watering. If you overwater a huge bed of soil and you don't have a good drainage system
[02:13:02.530 --> 02:13:06.450]  and it goes anaerobic or something, you can have some problems that are easier than just,
[02:13:06.450 --> 02:13:07.730]  you know, wait till they dry out.
[02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:14.450]  So with the horsepower and the ability for it to be easier comes some more obvious,
[02:13:15.090 --> 02:13:17.570]  but still tripping points.
[02:13:18.850 --> 02:13:20.450]  From there, they're always worried about yield.
[02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:23.890]  And I would say that phantom yield is just as important.
[02:13:23.890 --> 02:13:27.650]  And what I think that is the most important thing a commercial grow
[02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:31.970]  can look at is what their fucking profit is, not what their yield is.
[02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:34.850]  Lots of people will get great, good yield and no profit.
[02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:39.250]  Living soil should allow you to pay your people well, not have as many of them,
[02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:43.410]  have harvests that are very good, good yield competitively in the industry,
[02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:48.210]  but do that 365 every day, never have a failed harvest.
[02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:51.250]  Make sure it's like clockwork and make sure that when it's done,
[02:13:51.250 --> 02:13:55.410]  it's quality and you don't discount your value because you're trying to hustle to the wholesaler.
[02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:58.450]  And so if you respect the value, don't be a bottom dweller
[02:13:58.450 --> 02:14:00.610]  and you know you have quality and you respect that.
[02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:05.490]  And you've got the ability to produce it without one batch just completely going bad,
[02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:06.210]  so to speak.
[02:14:06.210 --> 02:14:09.250]  I think that you have that consistent ability to get profit.
[02:14:09.250 --> 02:14:12.050]  And then when you keep the soil, your second batch is half the price
[02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:15.730]  and you're not putting very many inputs because you're leveraging data and soil testing.
[02:14:16.690 --> 02:14:19.570]  All of a sudden, you've got a system that's duplicatable
[02:14:19.570 --> 02:14:22.290]  that is low input once it's been off the ground.
[02:14:22.290 --> 02:14:23.730]  It is a little bit intensive up front.
[02:14:24.930 --> 02:14:29.650]  It used to be though that it was much easier to go follow an exact three pound per light formula
[02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:32.930]  and the commercial living soil had no formula.
[02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:35.970]  So from an investor perspective, no process is bad.
[02:14:36.610 --> 02:14:38.210]  There's enough people doing living soil.
[02:14:38.210 --> 02:14:40.050]  I think you can have very good process in place now.
[02:14:40.690 --> 02:14:44.290]  The challenge is you can't just go buy those processes in a book
[02:14:44.290 --> 02:14:45.170]  and know that they're going to work.
[02:14:45.170 --> 02:14:48.210]  And there's not that many living soil growers that are going to go work for the man.
[02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:50.930]  Like too many of them have learned the industry is fucked.
[02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:53.410]  So that's part of the challenge.
[02:14:53.410 --> 02:14:56.290]  It's probably why it's hard to run a good restaurant.
[02:14:56.290 --> 02:14:57.250]  Everybody knows a good food chain.
[02:14:57.250 --> 02:14:58.770]  That was church right there, son.
[02:14:58.770 --> 02:14:59.490]  You know?
[02:14:59.490 --> 02:15:00.050]  Yeah.
[02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:01.010]  Sunday service.
[02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:02.450]  Yeah, right.
[02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:04.770]  The commercial side of things is fucked, man.
[02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:06.610]  Be an entrepreneur.
[02:15:06.610 --> 02:15:07.570]  Find your own way.
[02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:08.370]  Yep. Do it.
[02:15:09.330 --> 02:15:13.250]  Well, speaking of entrepreneurs, maybe this is a question for your wife,
[02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:15.090]  but when is the next merch drop?
[02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:16.610]  Oh, goodness.
[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:18.850]  Well, we want to do Build a Soil Family Farms merchandise
[02:15:18.850 --> 02:15:23.090]  and we're doing Build a Soil merchandise, but we had shit to get in order.
[02:15:23.090 --> 02:15:24.210]  I cut out the fluff.
[02:15:24.210 --> 02:15:25.810]  I stopped doing stuff that I couldn't do.
[02:15:25.810 --> 02:15:29.170]  And I found out that the organic t-shirt that I wanted them to print on,
[02:15:29.170 --> 02:15:31.090]  we got a batch that wasn't the organic t-shirt.
[02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:32.370]  And I just said, just stop the whole thing.
[02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:34.370]  And I'll wait until we can do this right.
[02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:36.930]  And I think our ducks are in a row now where I would like to,
[02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:38.530]  because we're going to be at CannaCon this weekend.
[02:15:39.250 --> 02:15:41.250]  I would love to have had a ton of merch with us there.
[02:15:41.250 --> 02:15:44.050]  And I realized that, yeah, we could probably sell it at a break-even
[02:15:44.050 --> 02:15:45.650]  so it doesn't cost money and people want it.
[02:15:46.450 --> 02:15:49.010]  But it was still tens of thousands of dollars in inventory to deal with.
[02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:51.090]  And we were setting up the new system and moving stuff.
[02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:52.210]  And I just said, to hell with it.
[02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:53.170]  No merch for a little while.
[02:15:53.170 --> 02:15:54.530]  We'll get back to it.
[02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:57.490]  And now, believe me, people are telling me they want it so much so
[02:15:57.490 --> 02:15:58.850]  that I cannot ignore it.
[02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:00.930]  And it will be done in the next quarter.
[02:16:00.930 --> 02:16:03.650]  I'd like to say 30 days, but I've learned not to make promises.
[02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:07.330]  Before 2023, in this next quarter, we will have merchandise.
[02:16:07.330 --> 02:16:08.930]  We're going to have more than we've ever had before.
[02:16:09.490 --> 02:16:10.210]  And I'm excited.
[02:16:11.090 --> 02:16:12.690]  You can't have too much merch.
[02:16:13.730 --> 02:16:15.090]  They're going to eat it up.
[02:16:15.090 --> 02:16:16.210]  Yep, I agree.
[02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:17.170]  And I wear the stuff.
[02:16:17.170 --> 02:16:17.730]  I like it.
[02:16:17.730 --> 02:16:19.410]  So we're going to do it.
[02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:20.690]  I'm going to have a hat that I like.
[02:16:20.690 --> 02:16:22.690]  And I'll have some rolling papers that I agree with.
[02:16:22.690 --> 02:16:24.850]  And I'll have a lighter and a few things that make sense.
[02:16:24.850 --> 02:16:28.290]  But part of me sells merchandise as consumer waste.
[02:16:28.290 --> 02:16:30.850]  And so we have to have a little healthy balance there.
[02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:32.130]  And I think I'll be happy.
[02:16:32.130 --> 02:16:35.090]  Well, hey, man, you're going to protect the old ball head from the sun.
[02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:37.090]  You're going to be doing a little bit more.
[02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:39.090]  So I appreciate that.
[02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:40.690]  I definitely support y'all on that too.
[02:16:41.730 --> 02:16:42.370]  Yeah, I'm right.
[02:16:43.890 --> 02:16:46.930]  Well, do you have any more requirements?
[02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:49.570]  I got 16 more.
[02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:50.450]  I don't think we're going to go.
[02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.770]  Oh, no.
[02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:52.370]  We're not going to do 16.
[02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:55.570]  The only reason why I say that is my cell phone died.
[02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:57.090]  I've got no communication with my wife.
[02:16:57.090 --> 02:16:58.130]  Kids getting out of school.
[02:16:58.130 --> 02:17:00.930]  And I think I had attended the family at this point.
[02:17:00.930 --> 02:17:05.250]  But I would love to come back sometime and we can go through 100 questions.
[02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:07.250]  So let me ask one more.
[02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:08.050]  Let's do it.
[02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:10.050]  What's the best way to store living soil?
[02:17:10.050 --> 02:17:11.410]  This guy made a huge batch.
[02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:12.850]  He's got some leftover.
[02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:13.970]  Any way you want.
[02:17:13.970 --> 02:17:14.530]  It's soil.
[02:17:14.530 --> 02:17:15.570]  It'll be fine.
[02:17:15.570 --> 02:17:16.770]  It'll totally be fine.
[02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:18.050]  Some rules of thumb.
[02:17:18.050 --> 02:17:22.370]  Don't throw it outside in the wind for rain to wash it out, for roots to grow into it,
[02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:23.490]  for rats to go into.
[02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:29.810]  And then also don't seal it up so it's completely anaerobic and put it in 120 degree garage.
[02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:33.490]  But if you've got some room temperature area and you can just throw it maybe in a
[02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:37.090]  rubber made tub with a lid kind of cracked or poke some holes in it or something, it's
[02:17:37.090 --> 02:17:37.410]  fine.
[02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:39.970]  The bags that we sell.
[02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:41.250]  We sell super sack bags.
[02:17:41.250 --> 02:17:43.010]  You can get, you can put it in there and seal it.
[02:17:43.010 --> 02:17:44.210]  You can put it in our bags.
[02:17:45.010 --> 02:17:45.810]  They're sewn.
[02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:49.490]  And the reason why we did that is most of the plastic bags on the market, all the bags
[02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:52.130]  on the bottom are broken by the time the pallet gets delivered.
[02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:53.250]  That's a lot of waste.
[02:17:53.250 --> 02:17:55.650]  And so we bought a bag that is more reusable.
[02:17:55.650 --> 02:17:59.490]  The other thing we did with our bag is all the plastic bags that are stretchy, the way
[02:17:59.490 --> 02:18:02.610]  they make the soil not go anaerobic is they have little pinholes.
[02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:05.890]  All the bugs fly into those when they're at the store.
[02:18:05.890 --> 02:18:08.290]  Ours has no holes, but it still breathes.
[02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:11.650]  And so some breathable material would be great.
[02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:14.850]  Otherwise, I literally don't think of it that much.
[02:18:15.970 --> 02:18:17.570]  Like it goes through seasons in nature.
[02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:21.490]  As soon as you water it, put cover crop into it, bring it back to life, that soil will
[02:18:21.490 --> 02:18:22.050]  be banging.
[02:18:22.050 --> 02:18:24.050]  It took thousands of years to make it as it were.
[02:18:24.050 --> 02:18:25.170]  It's not going to go bad on you.
[02:18:25.890 --> 02:18:26.610]  Boom.
[02:18:26.610 --> 02:18:26.930]  All right.
[02:18:26.930 --> 02:18:27.490]  That's it.
[02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:28.850]  Cool.
[02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:29.970]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:29.970 --> 02:18:30.530]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:30.530 --> 02:18:31.890]  And I'll catch you guys on the other side.
[02:18:31.890 --> 02:18:32.210]  See you.
[02:18:32.210 --> 02:18:33.810]  I appreciate it, Jeremy.
[02:18:33.810 --> 02:18:34.530]  I appreciate you.
[02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:37.570]  All right.
[02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:39.410]  Do we have any housekeeping or anything, Ken?
[02:18:40.850 --> 02:18:41.570]  On your side?
[02:18:44.130 --> 02:18:45.410]  Actually, let's start with Marco.
[02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:47.010]  Do you have anything coming up, brother?
[02:18:48.370 --> 02:18:49.090]  What do I have?
[02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:54.130]  No, I'm going to think I'm going to do a class at my place in first week of October, but
[02:18:54.130 --> 02:18:54.690]  stay tuned.
[02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:55.810]  We'll let you know that.
[02:18:56.850 --> 02:18:57.810]  Fantastic.
[02:18:57.810 --> 02:19:01.170]  Brian, I think you had some stuff coming up, didn't you?
[02:19:02.610 --> 02:19:04.530]  Yeah, well, I got some business stuff coming up.
[02:19:04.530 --> 02:19:09.330]  So tomorrow, I actually have probably a once in a lifetime opportunity.
[02:19:09.330 --> 02:19:14.610]  So I got to take a road trip and go have an important meeting, but it's going to level
[02:19:14.610 --> 02:19:15.330]  up my company.
[02:19:15.330 --> 02:19:19.570]  So it's something that I obviously I like to do this each and every week with you guys.
[02:19:19.570 --> 02:19:23.490]  But every now and then something obviously doesn't there's no way to move the meeting.
[02:19:23.490 --> 02:19:24.290]  So I got to go.
[02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:31.890]  And then as things progress, I think you guys notice after the today's show, I've felt like
[02:19:31.890 --> 02:19:36.210]  I've probably done a million jobs thinking about when we first learned about Build a
[02:19:36.210 --> 02:19:43.890]  Soil and stuff where Silva has continued to build his brand during all that time, all
[02:19:43.890 --> 02:19:47.490]  that frustration when I was working for all these different people.
[02:19:47.490 --> 02:19:50.770]  And granted, there's merit to that.
[02:19:50.770 --> 02:19:54.290]  I learned a lot of things and people always say, hey, well, you're learning mistakes on
[02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:55.250]  other people's dime.
[02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:59.650]  And I think that's another good way to look at things where you don't feel appreciated
[02:19:59.650 --> 02:20:01.650]  or feel jaded about certain things.
[02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:06.210]  But he always was focused on his brand and selling the shovels.
[02:20:06.210 --> 02:20:10.770]  And I think if you can find that niche, I found that later in life with my little brand.
[02:20:10.770 --> 02:20:15.570]  I think, Marco, you have your career and then you got your niche with your brand.
[02:20:16.530 --> 02:20:18.850]  Ken, you're now going around doing education.
[02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:25.650]  Something just starts to happen for you when you're creating things in motion, that ripple
[02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:26.370]  effect.
[02:20:26.370 --> 02:20:32.130]  So that really made me think, going down, in a way, memory lane preparing for this interview
[02:20:32.130 --> 02:20:36.930]  this week, of just he's been focused on his brand that entire time.
[02:20:36.930 --> 02:20:38.450]  And I really think about that.
[02:20:38.450 --> 02:20:43.730]  If you're able to really devote a decade to something, where could you be?
[02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:47.090]  Even if you start right now, today, you're like, fuck it.
[02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:48.450]  I'm going to work my little career.
[02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:50.690]  I got that stable money.
[02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:51.650]  But fuck that, man.
[02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:52.770]  That is not my future.
[02:20:52.770 --> 02:20:54.130]  And I want to work on something new.
[02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:55.490]  And I'm starting today.
[02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:59.330]  And I hope that after you see some of these interviews, maybe rewatch some of the other
[02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:03.730]  ones where we talk about being an entrepreneur, passive income, those kind of things, you
[02:21:03.730 --> 02:21:06.770]  want to get up and maybe just do a little extra each and every day.
[02:21:06.770 --> 02:21:09.570]  And I promise you that that motto, every day counts.
[02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:13.890]  And all those little things, you read the books, you can take it as deep as you want
[02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:14.050]  to.
[02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:15.490]  But those little things matter.
[02:21:15.490 --> 02:21:19.490]  And if you're doing just a little bit of percentage every single day over a year, that
[02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:19.890]  matters.
[02:21:19.890 --> 02:21:26.290]  If you start to think of your life in quarters, especially when you have a business, you're
[02:21:26.290 --> 02:21:27.010]  on another level.
[02:21:27.010 --> 02:21:30.290]  And there's something about getting that free time back.
[02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:33.890]  It's almost like it's, I don't know, what is that worth?
[02:21:33.890 --> 02:21:38.770]  I mean, it's almost priceless for a lot of individuals just to be able to wake up every
[02:21:38.770 --> 02:21:41.650]  day and you get to pick what you want to do that day.
[02:21:41.650 --> 02:21:45.330]  Granted, you got a lot of bullshit sometimes, but you get to pick how you deal with it,
[02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:46.210]  when you deal with it.
[02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:47.490]  And I like that.
[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:55.090]  And it reminds me of hustling, but without the Pepto-Bismol and all that shit, getting
[02:21:55.090 --> 02:21:57.330]  the bubblegum, man, because you're nervous all the time.
[02:21:57.330 --> 02:22:00.050]  Yeah, you ain't worrying about it.
[02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:01.330]  You got your stuff on the road.
[02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:02.210]  Yeah.
[02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:08.210]  So with Brian having to take the day off, there's no Living Soil Conversation tomorrow.
[02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:15.730]  I did a two-hour interview with a beautiful lady that talks about dosing and creating
[02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:21.410]  different compounds with cannabis and the different consumption methods.
[02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:25.970]  And I'm going to throw that up tomorrow in the Living Soil slot.
[02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:27.650]  It's two hours, but it's phenomenal.
[02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:32.130]  She's also one of the speakers for my event in October.
[02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:36.930]  And speaking of that, we've got Marco coming on.
[02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:39.170]  We've got Leighton coming on.
[02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:42.130]  We've got Dragonfly Earth Medicine that's going to be there.
[02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:44.930]  And Camp Compost is going to be there as well.
[02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:47.490]  So it's going to be an amazing event.
[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:48.850]  You guys can check it out.
[02:22:48.850 --> 02:22:54.370]  Just go to my website, follow some links, and you'll get there eventually.
[02:22:54.370 --> 02:22:56.850]  I don't have all the links set up yet, but I'm working on it.
[02:22:57.730 --> 02:23:01.570]  But other than that, we don't have a show with DP.
[02:23:01.570 --> 02:23:04.130]  Don't forget Joe DaHerb on Thursday night.
[02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:08.210]  Alex on Sundays, my show with Jon Burfello.
[02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:12.610]  I actually have Leighton Morrison, Mr. Toad, and Jon Burfello this coming Monday.
[02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:14.290]  I think that's the show you're going to want to watch.
[02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:17.970]  But there's so much great content, guys.
[02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:20.930]  Like, subscribe, make sure you hit your notification bell.
[02:23:21.570 --> 02:23:24.450]  Don't miss out on the content that's coming out.
[02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:26.610]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:28.770]  And I love you all, and have a great day.
[02:23:28.770 --> 02:23:30.370]  Wait, before we go.
[02:23:30.370 --> 02:23:30.690]  Okay.
[02:23:31.330 --> 02:23:36.130]  I want to thank my buddy, Vida Suelo on IG.
[02:23:36.130 --> 02:23:40.210]  This is actually wastewater from a...
[02:23:41.490 --> 02:23:44.290]  He does aquariums, like reef tanks.
[02:23:45.010 --> 02:23:46.770]  So he does them without chemicals.
[02:23:46.770 --> 02:23:49.490]  And this is actually some of the wastewater he cleaned up.
[02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:52.370]  So this is saltwater plus microbial.
[02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.610]  So...
[02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:54.370]  This is his work too.
[02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:57.170]  He's got a collab.
[02:23:57.170 --> 02:23:59.650]  So this man, who he's talking about?
[02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:02.610]  Fuck with that guy too.
[02:24:03.490 --> 02:24:06.210]  You had something else you were showing off, Marko.
[02:24:06.210 --> 02:24:11.410]  No, and then just some other buddies dropping off some nice little fun stuff too.
[02:24:11.970 --> 02:24:13.970]  Organic melts, showing some love.
[02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:15.570]  We actually did a barter.
[02:24:15.570 --> 02:24:19.170]  You know, the things you make, guys, can be considered money.
[02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:22.610]  And if you trade them, it's no different than trading a dollar.
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:23.250]  You know what I mean?
[02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:29.570]  Well, speaking of that, if there's anybody doing K&F inputs around Edmonton
[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:32.450]  that wants to have a table at the event in October,
[02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:37.570]  I'd love to have somebody there selling K&F inputs for people that want to buy them.
[02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:40.130]  We're going to be teaching how to make them,
[02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:44.290]  but it'd be really nice for people to be able to grab them right there and take them home.
[02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:46.370]  So reach out on IG.
[02:24:47.810 --> 02:24:48.450]  Definitely.
[02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:51.490]  Okay, guys, well, you have a wonderful day.
[02:24:51.490 --> 02:24:53.410]  Brian, did you have one last word there, brother?
[02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:56.370]  Yeah, Ryan, make TJ come on the show.
[02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:03.570]  Shh, I'm going to hit the end broadcast now.
[02:25:03.570 --> 02:25:04.770]  All right.
