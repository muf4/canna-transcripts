[00:00.960 --> 00:04.320]  We are live. Take it away, Brian.
[00:04.320 --> 00:06.040]  Yeah. Good morning, Living Soil Nerds.
[00:06.040 --> 00:07.440]  Happy Thursday to you.
[00:07.440 --> 00:08.760]  Shout out to my co-host,
[00:08.760 --> 00:10.280]  Leighton and as always,
[00:10.280 --> 00:12.360]  kind of a salute for the whole industry to
[00:12.360 --> 00:15.960]  Peter for continuing to build this educational platform.
[00:15.960 --> 00:17.440]  I feel like because of some of this,
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.280]  there's a lot more people that I now have
[00:19.280 --> 00:21.880]  access to and just learning about.
[00:21.880 --> 00:24.440]  In just a few months, I feel like Jethouse Gardens,
[00:24.440 --> 00:27.320]  Chandler has really peaked
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.040]  the eye of a lot of people I feel like in our industry.
[00:30.040 --> 00:31.600]  I'm really excited to be able to
[00:31.600 --> 00:32.880]  pick your brain today, Chandler.
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.520]  I know that there's a lot of things
[00:34.520 --> 00:37.800]  that you and I see eye to eye on a lot of stuff,
[00:37.800 --> 00:39.840]  especially when it comes to vermicomposting
[00:39.840 --> 00:42.200]  and just the way that things are done.
[00:42.200 --> 00:44.400]  I'm excited to learn even more about that because you
[00:44.400 --> 00:48.760]  were definitely at an advanced level
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.280]  with doing this as a business.
[00:50.280 --> 00:51.960]  For me, it was just more of like a hobby
[00:51.960 --> 00:53.840]  and starting to notice a few things.
[00:53.840 --> 00:56.040]  That's why I'm excited to really pick
[00:56.040 --> 00:57.480]  your brain because you're doing this
[00:57.480 --> 00:59.680]  on the commercial level as well.
[00:59.840 --> 01:01.000]  There's a lot of things I know
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.360]  we're going to talk about today.
[01:02.360 --> 01:04.720]  I know Leighton is going to be able to really pick
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.520]  your brain on a level that I always wish I could,
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.920]  but just not there, I feel like genetically.
[01:10.920 --> 01:13.560]  That's the exciting part of this show is that we're
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.600]  really able to dive deep with
[01:15.600 --> 01:17.920]  certain things and certain aspects where we can
[01:17.920 --> 01:22.440]  all rewind this later on and really digest
[01:22.440 --> 01:24.600]  a lot of the conversations that we're going to have today.
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.520]  I know that you're the Living Soil Director of Wormies.
[01:28.840 --> 01:31.320]  I wanted to start there because I know that,
[01:31.320 --> 01:34.520]  at least for myself and my family and stuff over here,
[01:34.520 --> 01:37.560]  we're really diving deeper into water and then how
[01:37.560 --> 01:40.000]  that water is even affecting our compost,
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.800]  our vermicompost and taking that to the next level.
[01:42.800 --> 01:46.760]  The beauty of using vermicompost, in my opinion,
[01:46.760 --> 01:48.720]  is that especially when you're first getting started
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.200]  into this, it's really hard to mess that up
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.680]  because you're allowing the worms to take hold.
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.880]  Again, it's more about, especially with living soil
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.200]  systems, soil food web ideology, we're more maintaining
[02:00.200 --> 02:03.880]  these systems than we are really just being so,
[02:03.880 --> 02:06.440]  the plants or the soil system being so reliant on us
[02:06.440 --> 02:09.720]  that we have to be in there catering it almost constantly,
[02:09.720 --> 02:10.680]  if you will.
[02:10.680 --> 02:12.000]  So I kind of wanted to start there, man.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.240]  I know you wear many hats.
[02:13.240 --> 02:14.480]  I know you're doing the Bokashi.
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.640]  We'll get into that deeper as well.
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.400]  And then I know that you were the co-founder, I believe,
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.160]  or you're co-founder of the Michigan Compost Cup.
[02:23.160 --> 02:25.320]  So I feel like that's another little thing that
[02:25.760 --> 02:28.360]  our industry has been watching you and watching the things
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.600]  that you're doing and some of the more educational stuff.
[02:30.600 --> 02:32.240]  And that's why I wanted to reach out to you
[02:32.240 --> 02:34.280]  so that we could have you on the show today.
[02:34.280 --> 02:36.680]  Because Leighton and I, and obviously Peter,
[02:36.680 --> 02:38.680]  just the more that people are educating,
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.680]  I've put on a few events in my life,
[02:41.680 --> 02:43.480]  not maybe at that same level that you did,
[02:43.480 --> 02:45.840]  and really throwing a huge cup like that
[02:45.840 --> 02:49.320]  and that kind of stuff is immense work behind the scenes.
[02:49.320 --> 02:51.880]  And that's the kind of stuff sometimes is a thankless job.
[02:51.880 --> 02:53.560]  So I just wanted you to know that a lot of us
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.120]  are watching that and we appreciate what you're doing
[02:56.120 --> 02:59.040]  and creating the awareness of really what it takes
[02:59.040 --> 03:01.240]  to get to high level composting.
[03:01.240 --> 03:02.880]  So just wanted to start there, man.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.200]  I need to toot your horn a little bit
[03:04.200 --> 03:06.600]  because I feel like a lot of people have been watching you
[03:06.600 --> 03:08.520]  and that's the best part of this platform
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.960]  is that we can kind of give those people
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.240]  that might not necessarily have the platform
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.040]  on a variety of different areas
[03:14.040 --> 03:16.200]  to kind of just come with on Peter's show
[03:16.200 --> 03:17.840]  and just kind of get that one-stop shop
[03:17.840 --> 03:21.240]  where a lot of people are gonna be educated from you today.
[03:21.240 --> 03:23.280]  Awesome guys, I truly appreciate it.
[03:24.160 --> 03:25.560]  This platform is awesome.
[03:25.560 --> 03:27.360]  I've learned so much from you guys
[03:27.360 --> 03:29.040]  and this is truly an honor.
[03:29.040 --> 03:30.280]  So I'm happy to be here.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.840]  You know what, before we get too crazy,
[03:35.840 --> 03:37.400]  I wanted to give you big ups
[03:37.400 --> 03:39.560]  for putting that compost cup on.
[03:40.800 --> 03:44.400]  A friend of mine, Eric, associate of Eric and I out here
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.320]  put the first annual Ventura compost cup on
[03:47.320 --> 03:49.000]  and we brought in all of the local
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.600]  heavy-headed producers of compost
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.720]  and it was really eye-opening to see
[03:54.720 --> 03:57.160]  how people viewed or judged compost.
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.480]  Now they had no chemistry, they had no biologicals,
[04:00.480 --> 04:03.760]  they had nothing to work from and yet they were picking.
[04:03.760 --> 04:06.120]  Now I was fortunate enough to be able to scope
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.920]  each and every sample before I had the judges look at it.
[04:09.920 --> 04:12.280]  So I was kind of like playing devil's advocate
[04:12.280 --> 04:15.760]  to see which direction that they would lean in
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.360]  without telling them which ones that I had ranked
[04:19.360 --> 04:22.160]  or rated based on the biological activities.
[04:22.160 --> 04:25.000]  So was that something that you guys did as well
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.440]  in your judgments?
[04:26.440 --> 04:28.080]  So yeah, we definitely got this idea
[04:28.080 --> 04:29.960]  from the Ventura County Cup,
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.160]  but we've been so busy with the harvest and everything
[04:34.160 --> 04:35.720]  or just everything this summer.
[04:35.720 --> 04:38.280]  And so we're like, okay, let's just get this together,
[04:38.280 --> 04:40.960]  a community event, we're building soil,
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.040]  we're building community, let's have fun,
[04:43.040 --> 04:44.840]  let's talk about composting.
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.040]  But maybe next year, let's start planning it a lot earlier
[04:48.040 --> 04:49.680]  and get all this groundwork done.
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.560]  And so like we can actually have a cup of a competition.
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.480]  And so, yeah, I wanted to talk to you
[04:56.480 --> 04:58.120]  about some of these different aspects
[04:58.120 --> 05:00.040]  of what we'd actually judge compost on,
[05:00.040 --> 05:02.720]  because we can look at all these quantifiable things
[05:02.720 --> 05:04.400]  and we can count microbes under the scope,
[05:04.400 --> 05:06.960]  but like, unless you're giving it to a plant
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.280]  and testing it and seeing what the plant thinks,
[05:09.280 --> 05:11.360]  it's like, you're never getting the full picture.
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.840]  And so I think there's a lot that we can plan out
[05:15.840 --> 05:19.160]  and look forward to next year for sure.
[05:19.160 --> 05:20.640]  We had the same situation.
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.440]  We pulled it together in a very short period of time,
[05:23.440 --> 05:26.040]  but we still had an amazing outcome.
[05:26.040 --> 05:29.920]  I mean, we had over 70 some odd samples that came in.
[05:29.920 --> 05:30.840]  Oh wow.
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.760]  Yeah, I rejected probably 20 of them
[05:32.760 --> 05:35.520]  just due to the fact that they were horrible
[05:35.520 --> 05:37.640]  and a really stinky compost.
[05:37.640 --> 05:40.680]  But that being said, people still tried.
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.800]  They sent in samples, which was great.
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.600]  And again, it's more about raising awareness
[05:47.600 --> 05:49.640]  than per se judgment.
[05:49.640 --> 05:52.800]  This is something I'm hoping to do with Peter in the future
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.040]  and do a series on what is compost?
[05:56.040 --> 05:58.560]  Because we really don't have a definition of it
[05:58.560 --> 06:01.520]  and ground up organic matter.
[06:01.520 --> 06:03.640]  It's still valuable as a carbon source.
[06:03.640 --> 06:07.160]  I mean, yeah, it's a herbicide, it kills everything.
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.880]  But then there's the other end of it,
[06:08.880 --> 06:10.400]  the biological mayonnaise,
[06:10.400 --> 06:12.760]  where it's been composted down to a point
[06:12.760 --> 06:14.840]  where it's just silt.
[06:14.840 --> 06:17.120]  And so then where is the middle?
[06:17.120 --> 06:18.880]  Where is the balance?
[06:18.880 --> 06:23.000]  And each one of these has a value in a different application
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.640]  but using it in the wrong application
[06:25.640 --> 06:28.960]  is not gonna give you the kind of results that you want.
[06:28.960 --> 06:29.800]  So yeah, we should-
[06:29.800 --> 06:30.800]  100%.
[06:30.800 --> 06:33.760]  Yeah, we should definitely chop it up offline about,
[06:33.760 --> 06:36.640]  well, how do we put a parameter?
[06:37.320 --> 06:40.240]  What are the goals of judging compost?
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.920]  Because it's not like smoking weed, right?
[06:42.920 --> 06:44.760]  You can't just say, oh, well, this tastes good
[06:44.760 --> 06:47.680]  and this smells good and this has this effect,
[06:47.680 --> 06:50.160]  like you said, without applying it to plants.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.160]  And what kind of plant?
[06:51.160 --> 06:52.520]  We're in the soil succession.
[06:52.520 --> 06:55.120]  You know, it's like you gotta have different composts
[06:55.120 --> 06:57.040]  for different purposes, you know?
[06:57.040 --> 06:58.480]  And that's what it comes down to.
[06:58.480 --> 07:00.360]  Yeah, yeah, amen, dude, amen.
[07:00.360 --> 07:02.000]  So we're on the same sheet for sure.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.760]  And yeah, there's gonna be quite a bit of work
[07:04.760 --> 07:09.160]  to kind of set up a foundation, say,
[07:09.160 --> 07:12.280]  to build off of as to how we approach
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.680]  this particular issue and what is-
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.800]  Awesome.
[07:15.800 --> 07:18.440]  I would absolutely love to talk a little bit more
[07:18.440 --> 07:20.360]  about all this plant stuff.
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.120]  We will, for sure.
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.280]  So Brian, I don't know how you wanted to lead off today
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.320]  but I just wanted to compliment him on doing the work.
[07:27.320 --> 07:28.440]  Yeah, I just wanted him to know,
[07:28.440 --> 07:30.560]  like a lot of people are watching you, dude, you know?
[07:30.560 --> 07:32.680]  And you know, hopefully now after today
[07:32.680 --> 07:34.120]  there's just that other springboard
[07:34.440 --> 07:37.000]  and I hope that we can all prop each other up.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.560]  I know that, you know, on the commercial side of things
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.760]  you're doing stuff at a thermophilic level
[07:42.760 --> 07:45.720]  and then you're kind of, as far as I understand your process
[07:45.720 --> 07:47.120]  and please correct me if I'm wrong,
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.360]  then it kind of maybe chills for a little bit.
[07:49.360 --> 07:51.240]  Then you're adding your composting worms
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.160]  and kind of then taking that to the next level,
[07:53.160 --> 07:56.200]  especially how I feel by using a cover crop
[07:56.200 --> 07:59.040]  instead of maybe burlap sacks or newspapers,
[07:59.040 --> 08:01.800]  that kind of stuff that's maybe old school thinking now
[08:01.800 --> 08:04.040]  with some of the stuff that seems to be developing.
[08:04.040 --> 08:05.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:05.160 --> 08:06.640]  But I really wanted to get into first,
[08:06.640 --> 08:08.480]  I mean, on the commercial level,
[08:08.480 --> 08:10.320]  like does it seem like the red wiggler
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.600]  is the one to go with?
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.320]  I know a lot of people have kind of questions about that.
[08:14.320 --> 08:17.440]  I just wanted to dive deeper into your process
[08:17.440 --> 08:20.840]  because I feel like, again, at the commercial level,
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.000]  how can you argue with that?
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.640]  Like the proof is in the end product that you're making.
[08:24.640 --> 08:28.160]  So, you know, what composting worms seem to be best
[08:28.160 --> 08:29.520]  and then if you can't afford those,
[08:29.520 --> 08:32.640]  what are some of the ones that might be better to use
[08:32.640 --> 08:34.480]  or some of the night crawlers, that kind of stuff.
[08:34.480 --> 08:36.880]  Just really wanted to dive deeper from that, man.
[08:36.880 --> 08:39.920]  And I got my notepad and pen ready as well.
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.800]  So excited to listen.
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.240]  So real quick, I just want to say
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.640]  the place that I work at is Wormies and that's not me.
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.400]  I'm part of the team there, right?
[08:48.400 --> 08:51.960]  And so I've talked with Luis, the owner,
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.920]  about different composting worms and everything, you know,
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.360]  which ones we should try out.
[08:58.360 --> 09:01.760]  And he's heard, you know, like some of the jumpers
[09:01.760 --> 09:03.720]  or like, I think the Alabama ones,
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.600]  they're pretty aggressive and they can like actually eat
[09:07.600 --> 09:09.400]  the red wigglers or something like that.
[09:09.400 --> 09:12.320]  And so honestly, we've just been having such good success
[09:12.320 --> 09:13.240]  with red wigglers.
[09:13.240 --> 09:15.520]  It's like, why fix what isn't broken?
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.640]  But like, so that's the only ones
[09:17.640 --> 09:20.840]  that we've intentionally like populated our piles with
[09:20.840 --> 09:22.000]  is these red wigglers.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.840]  But what's really cool about having compost
[09:23.840 --> 09:26.000]  right on the ground, right on the soil,
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.080]  is like we have night crawlers come up at night
[09:29.080 --> 09:32.200]  and we see grits of sand in our compost.
[09:32.200 --> 09:34.680]  It's like, we've never added sand to any of this.
[09:34.680 --> 09:36.400]  And like, where the hell is it coming from?
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.640]  It's like, it's coming from those night crawlers
[09:38.640 --> 09:40.040]  that are mining those minerals,
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.120]  that all that stuff from like 15, 20 feet down,
[09:43.120 --> 09:44.120]  and it's bringing it up
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.120]  and it's taking organic matter from the top
[09:46.120 --> 09:47.880]  and it's doing what worms do.
[09:47.880 --> 09:51.440]  And like, so we've never added night crawlers intentionally,
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.040]  but the fact that we have it on the ground
[09:54.040 --> 09:56.840]  lets biology do its thing.
[09:56.840 --> 10:00.040]  It's a little bit different than some of these raised,
[10:00.920 --> 10:03.040]  like flow through systems that you see,
[10:03.040 --> 10:05.060]  which seem incredible for sure.
[10:05.960 --> 10:07.200]  But I think there's a lot of benefit
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.560]  to just letting biology do its thing right on the ground.
[10:10.560 --> 10:12.280]  Dude, I agree 100%.
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.080]  I mean, that is standalone.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.600]  I don't know anybody that's commercially producing
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.200]  vermicompost in contact with soil.
[10:20.200 --> 10:21.920]  So kudos to you guys.
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.760]  So what is your bedding?
[10:24.480 --> 10:25.320]  What are you starting with?
[10:25.320 --> 10:27.920]  Okay, so we are like a compost pickup service.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.160]  And so we take food scraps from all over the city.
[10:31.160 --> 10:32.680]  There's a bunch of really cool,
[10:32.680 --> 10:36.160]  like juice bars and kombucha places,
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.880]  and like some really cool,
[10:37.880 --> 10:40.520]  like health oriented restaurants around our city,
[10:40.520 --> 10:42.080]  and we're super fortunate.
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.840]  And so we take a lot of this food waste
[10:45.840 --> 10:49.200]  and we collect a lot of manure from local farms.
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.360]  We collect wood chips from tree removal services,
[10:52.360 --> 10:53.780]  which is like a huge piece of it,
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.960]  like adding all of the wood chips
[10:55.960 --> 10:57.400]  and letting the mushrooms do their thing
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.080]  and letting the fungi do their thing.
[10:59.080 --> 11:00.680]  That's like the next level.
[11:00.680 --> 11:04.520]  But so we take all of this biomass, right?
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.360]  And we mix it up.
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.640]  We try to find the right ratio
[11:06.640 --> 11:08.360]  of browns to greens and everything.
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.760]  And then we do the thermophilic process and we let it cook.
[11:12.760 --> 11:15.600]  And we let it heat up to 150-ish
[11:15.600 --> 11:20.600]  and cook off any potential pests or seeds or pathogens
[11:21.280 --> 11:23.480]  that could be in the manure sources.
[11:23.480 --> 11:28.120]  And so we cook it all in these big hex bins,
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.240]  which are actively aerated static piles pretty much.
[11:31.240 --> 11:33.960]  And so like, instead of flipping your compost
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.320]  to make sure that everything goes through the core
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.340]  and heats up and aerating it,
[11:40.320 --> 11:42.440]  we just have these PVC pipes
[11:42.440 --> 11:45.200]  that are right underneath these huge piles.
[11:45.200 --> 11:48.000]  And so every like half hour or so,
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.380]  these fans turn on and it blows this air
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.380]  up through the piles and aerates everything
[11:52.380 --> 11:56.300]  and maintains really nice, even moisture
[11:56.300 --> 12:00.300]  and temperature and everything from what we've seen.
[12:00.300 --> 12:04.300]  Like there's definitely some variability with the recipe,
[12:04.300 --> 12:08.100]  but that's what it's all about is figuring it out
[12:08.100 --> 12:11.300]  and trying to improve every time.
[12:11.300 --> 12:14.340]  But basically we cook all this stuff down.
[12:14.340 --> 12:19.020]  And so unfortunately, once it gets over like 130 degrees,
[12:19.020 --> 12:20.940]  you start cooking off some of your beneficial guys
[12:20.940 --> 12:22.900]  as well as the potential pathogens.
[12:22.900 --> 12:27.900]  And so when we take it out of these bins
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.500]  and lay it flat into the worm rows, we let it cool down,
[12:32.500 --> 12:34.700]  but then we also are doing everything we can
[12:34.700 --> 12:37.960]  to reintroduce more biology to inoculate it
[12:37.960 --> 12:39.640]  with as much life as possible.
[12:39.640 --> 12:42.580]  So it's not just, you know, the thermophilic process
[12:42.580 --> 12:44.760]  that maybe killed off some of the good stuff.
[12:44.760 --> 12:46.420]  We do the thermophilic process
[12:46.420 --> 12:49.260]  and then we add some fermented Bokashi scraps.
[12:49.260 --> 12:52.700]  And then we add like spent mushroom blocks.
[12:52.700 --> 12:54.940]  And then we do the cover cropping like we were talking about
[12:54.940 --> 12:58.140]  and like, we just add all this life back on top of it.
[12:58.140 --> 13:01.380]  And it just creates this beautiful, beautiful ecosystem.
[13:01.380 --> 13:03.500]  And like, there's so many benefits
[13:03.500 --> 13:07.180]  to the cover crops alone, but like the mycorrhizae thing,
[13:07.180 --> 13:10.460]  you know, like you need eight weeks for that mycorrhizal
[13:10.460 --> 13:14.700]  spore to actually do anything in association with the plant.
[13:14.700 --> 13:17.980]  And like, it needs that association with the roots
[13:17.980 --> 13:19.820]  to even, you know, start doing its thing.
[13:19.820 --> 13:23.220]  And so like, if you don't have living roots in your soil,
[13:23.220 --> 13:26.040]  like you don't have that full connection.
[13:27.300 --> 13:30.860]  And so I think that's something that really sets us above
[13:30.860 --> 13:34.900]  is like our use of cover crop and like how much
[13:34.900 --> 13:37.500]  these crops are, you know, putting these exudates
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.740]  into the soil and stimulating these microbes
[13:39.740 --> 13:44.500]  and protecting the compost physically as a cover
[13:45.340 --> 13:46.180]  and like the list goes on and on
[13:46.180 --> 13:47.780]  with the benefits for sure.
[13:47.780 --> 13:50.140]  Wow, one of the other ways that you're speeding things up
[13:50.140 --> 13:51.860]  and kind of improving on mother nature
[13:51.860 --> 13:55.420]  is you're also using spent mushroom blocks, correct?
[13:55.420 --> 13:57.380]  Yeah, yeah, we have this awesome,
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.860]  a good friend of mine actually, mushroom cultivator
[14:00.860 --> 14:03.140]  here in town, he does so many gourmet mushrooms
[14:03.140 --> 14:06.180]  and some medicinal mushrooms and just has, you know,
[14:06.180 --> 14:10.220]  just a plethora of spent blocks that have so much life
[14:10.220 --> 14:13.660]  in them still, but like at that gourmet level, you know,
[14:13.660 --> 14:16.380]  a lot of the times it's one flush and done.
[14:16.380 --> 14:18.860]  You can't have any trichoderma in there or anything,
[14:18.860 --> 14:21.580]  but like, and that's the cool thing about like,
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.660]  I used to be into mushroom cultivation as well
[14:23.660 --> 14:26.540]  and I'm still in it for sure, but like I'm getting away
[14:26.540 --> 14:30.480]  from the monoculture aspect, but like when you have,
[14:30.480 --> 14:32.060]  when you're trying to cultivate mushrooms
[14:32.060 --> 14:33.620]  and you create the sterile environment
[14:33.620 --> 14:34.900]  for anything to breed, right?
[14:34.900 --> 14:37.180]  And you try to inoculate this monoculture
[14:37.180 --> 14:39.340]  with your one strain of mushroom,
[14:39.340 --> 14:42.220]  like we know that's not how the world works.
[14:42.260 --> 14:43.860]  It's like, we don't live in a sterile world.
[14:43.860 --> 14:47.220]  So like, you're gonna have competitors flying
[14:47.220 --> 14:49.780]  through the air and you're gonna culture like trichoderma,
[14:49.780 --> 14:51.180]  some green mold.
[14:51.180 --> 14:54.900]  And that's like the bane of the mushroom growers existence.
[14:54.900 --> 14:57.140]  You know, it's like, they hate that shit,
[14:57.140 --> 15:00.020]  but you take those blocks that have this green mold on it,
[15:00.020 --> 15:02.120]  you break it up, you put it in the compost
[15:02.120 --> 15:03.900]  and it all just balances itself out.
[15:03.900 --> 15:06.700]  And like, then you have more healthy mushrooms pop up
[15:06.700 --> 15:08.300]  out of your compost pile.
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.340]  It's like, it gives it the second chance that they need.
[15:11.380 --> 15:12.780]  It gives it the, you know,
[15:12.780 --> 15:16.620]  it's the biological intelligence figuring itself out.
[15:16.620 --> 15:19.300]  And like, they're incredibly capable
[15:19.300 --> 15:21.340]  of doing what they need to do.
[15:21.340 --> 15:23.740]  But when you put them into a sterile setting,
[15:23.740 --> 15:25.260]  then they're disadvantaged.
[15:26.540 --> 15:29.460]  You know, I'd love to back it up a little bit first
[15:29.460 --> 15:30.940]  for the audience.
[15:30.940 --> 15:33.740]  Pathogen reduction is probably one
[15:33.740 --> 15:35.980]  of the most important things that you can do,
[15:35.980 --> 15:40.500]  especially if you're dealing with manures and food scraps.
[15:40.500 --> 15:44.980]  So that being said, do you have a state law
[15:44.980 --> 15:48.420]  or a required level of pathogen reduction?
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.820]  And if so, what is it?
[15:49.820 --> 15:52.100]  And if you could tell us about it, that'd be great.
[15:52.100 --> 15:52.940]  Yeah, for sure.
[15:52.940 --> 15:54.860]  So right now I know we're commercial scale,
[15:54.860 --> 15:57.980]  but honestly we're a really small composting business.
[15:57.980 --> 16:00.260]  We're like a worm farm technically, you know,
[16:00.260 --> 16:03.380]  and we're not taking in enough yards of biomass
[16:03.380 --> 16:06.060]  at this point to even need the composting license.
[16:06.060 --> 16:09.200]  But like, this is all stuff that we're really working for,
[16:09.240 --> 16:11.160]  like over this winter and into the next year
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.440]  is like really scaling up and getting our big boy license
[16:14.440 --> 16:18.000]  and learning all this regulations and everything like that.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.800]  So it's been a process for sure.
[16:20.800 --> 16:22.880]  There's a couple of us on the team
[16:22.880 --> 16:26.680]  and we've been passionate about the composting
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.120]  and everything and making sure that we are, you know,
[16:30.120 --> 16:33.280]  cooking off our compost at like 150 for,
[16:35.040 --> 16:37.960]  I think 10 days or something like that.
[16:38.040 --> 16:40.920]  I forget the exact rules, but you know,
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.360]  we're doing our due diligence of making sure
[16:43.360 --> 16:45.040]  that everything really heats up first
[16:45.040 --> 16:46.560]  before it goes through.
[16:46.560 --> 16:48.040]  But then that's the thing too,
[16:48.040 --> 16:51.140]  is like we're not selling just thermophilic compost.
[16:51.140 --> 16:54.160]  We take that thermophilic compost, we lay it on the ground
[16:54.160 --> 16:56.920]  and then we introduce all the chunkies
[16:56.920 --> 16:59.680]  that we sifted out of our last finished compost.
[16:59.680 --> 17:01.840]  And so that's all full of like this wood chips
[17:01.840 --> 17:04.240]  that are fully colonized with mycelium
[17:04.240 --> 17:06.480]  and all these worms and worm cocoons and everything.
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.080]  And it's basically like the mother culture
[17:08.080 --> 17:11.320]  that goes in between each pile, you know?
[17:11.320 --> 17:15.440]  And so we introduce that stuff to the thermophilic compost
[17:15.440 --> 17:17.560]  and then it does its thing
[17:17.560 --> 17:19.280]  and we let it sit there for like 10 months.
[17:19.280 --> 17:20.560]  And so like the whole process
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.560]  is like a whole entire year long and it does its thing.
[17:26.560 --> 17:28.640]  And the worms are absolutely magic.
[17:28.640 --> 17:31.080]  They can eat stuff and clean it up.
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.180]  The end product is some incredible black gold.
[17:37.280 --> 17:41.680]  So you're only putting in the food scraps
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.800]  and all of these, what I wanna call feedstocks
[17:44.800 --> 17:46.880]  in through the thermophilic process.
[17:46.880 --> 17:48.060]  You're not turning it.
[17:48.060 --> 17:51.100]  You're using air as a method
[17:51.100 --> 17:55.000]  to balance both moisture, temperature.
[17:55.000 --> 17:55.880]  So that's great.
[17:55.880 --> 17:57.280]  And then you take the feedstock
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.440]  after this 10 day pathogen reduction process
[18:01.440 --> 18:03.240]  and then you use that to lay it out
[18:03.240 --> 18:05.040]  and introduce your worms.
[18:05.040 --> 18:05.880]  Is that correct?
[18:06.120 --> 18:06.960]  Yeah.
[18:06.960 --> 18:11.000]  And so like, and then anything that we add at that level,
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.680]  you know, it's been fermented, the Bokashi food scraps
[18:14.680 --> 18:16.320]  and then the mushroom blocks.
[18:16.320 --> 18:19.480]  Like, yeah, there's a lot of the mushroom blocks
[18:19.480 --> 18:22.160]  have the trichoderma like contaminant, you know?
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.320]  But like you break that up and you add that to the soil
[18:25.320 --> 18:27.200]  and it just eats some of the fungi in there
[18:27.200 --> 18:29.240]  but then it ends up getting out competed
[18:29.240 --> 18:32.080]  because, you know, there's so much other stuff in there.
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.080]  And like trichoderma is a healthy part of the soil.
[18:35.080 --> 18:37.760]  I don't know if you have anything to say about that, Layton.
[18:37.760 --> 18:39.120]  Oh, not yet.
[18:39.120 --> 18:41.400]  We can go on and on about trichoderma.
[18:41.400 --> 18:43.320]  Before we go there, let's back it up.
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.360]  Do you do temperature probes of your feedstock
[18:47.360 --> 18:49.420]  after you've introduced the worms?
[18:51.280 --> 18:53.360]  Feedstock after, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[18:53.360 --> 18:56.240]  We have thermometers everywhere at all the time, yeah.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.080]  Beautiful.
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.800]  So how does the compost react or excuse me,
[19:01.800 --> 19:03.640]  the feedstock after it's gone through
[19:04.520 --> 19:07.640]  pathogen reduction and you've introduced worms
[19:07.640 --> 19:10.880]  and all of the spent mushroom blocks and your Bokashi,
[19:10.880 --> 19:13.680]  does it start to heat back up again or does it?
[19:13.680 --> 19:17.960]  Yeah, so we've noticed a couple of different variants
[19:17.960 --> 19:20.040]  and so like it's still, I think, comes down
[19:20.040 --> 19:24.080]  to that base recipe and that we're still dialing that in.
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.480]  And it, you know, just getting into measuring carbon
[19:27.480 --> 19:30.120]  and nitrogen ratios and it's a whole rabbit hole,
[19:30.120 --> 19:32.040]  you know, that depends.
[19:32.040 --> 19:33.480]  Like you get manure, you know,
[19:33.480 --> 19:36.040]  and you gotta judge how much bedding is in there
[19:36.040 --> 19:38.800]  and how much urine was soaked into that bedding.
[19:38.800 --> 19:40.560]  These make big differences, you know,
[19:40.560 --> 19:44.440]  and so like we're just guesstimating as best as we can
[19:44.440 --> 19:45.720]  trying to get this right recipe,
[19:45.720 --> 19:48.320]  but sometimes, and sometimes intentionally too,
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.960]  we'll add like over the winter,
[19:49.960 --> 19:54.500]  we'll add a lot more nitrogen just to keep that pile warm
[19:54.500 --> 19:56.460]  throughout the winter, you know.
[19:56.460 --> 19:58.520]  It can have amount of snow on top
[19:58.520 --> 20:00.560]  and it's warm enough that it never freezes.
[20:00.560 --> 20:03.440]  It just constantly melts that tiny bit of snow on top
[20:03.440 --> 20:05.040]  and keeps the right moisture content
[20:05.040 --> 20:08.240]  and like worms love it and they're like respraying.
[20:08.240 --> 20:10.320]  We'll go in there, there's way more cocoons
[20:10.320 --> 20:12.600]  than you'd normally find.
[20:12.600 --> 20:14.880]  And I think it's part of that overwintering process
[20:14.880 --> 20:18.080]  and maybe the, you know,
[20:18.080 --> 20:20.000]  they think that they might die or something
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.200]  and so they're trying to pass on their genes
[20:22.200 --> 20:24.200]  and do what they do.
[20:24.200 --> 20:26.360]  And so like they have a huge population boom
[20:26.360 --> 20:27.200]  over the winter.
[20:27.200 --> 20:28.200]  We've noticed.
[20:28.200 --> 20:30.840]  You are doing some great work there, brother.
[20:30.840 --> 20:34.560]  All right, so let's, we'll reel it back into fungals.
[20:34.560 --> 20:37.560]  So it is well known that, you know,
[20:37.560 --> 20:41.400]  some of the important steps,
[20:41.400 --> 20:43.080]  successionary steps for fungus,
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.840]  specifically with the end goal
[20:44.840 --> 20:47.680]  of trying to get sap robes to colonize
[20:47.680 --> 20:51.160]  is these early yeast and trichoderma and stuff.
[20:51.160 --> 20:52.600]  They're stepping stone,
[20:52.600 --> 20:57.400]  the foundation of the ecological succession of the system.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.360]  So by introducing those spent mushroom blocks,
[21:00.360 --> 21:03.240]  you're basically providing the feedstocks
[21:03.240 --> 21:05.640]  for that evolution to occur.
[21:05.640 --> 21:07.400]  So, you know, kudos again.
[21:07.400 --> 21:08.240]  Awesome, man.
[21:08.240 --> 21:11.560]  You know, that substrate that they can't use
[21:11.560 --> 21:14.920]  is the ultimate foundation for building out
[21:14.920 --> 21:18.280]  a fungally dominant compost or vermicompost.
[21:18.280 --> 21:22.160]  So, you know, again, kudos for doing the work, my friend.
[21:22.160 --> 21:23.240]  Thank you so much.
[21:23.240 --> 21:24.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:24.080 --> 21:25.680]  I can't wait to get ahold of some of this stuff.
[21:25.680 --> 21:26.520]  I mean, I-
[21:26.520 --> 21:28.760]  I can't wait to send you a sample right after this.
[21:28.760 --> 21:29.600]  Let's do it.
[21:29.600 --> 21:33.280]  No, the only person I've ever found in my life
[21:33.280 --> 21:36.320]  that ended up with a fungally dominant compost,
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.920]  or excuse me, vermicompost,
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.120]  was a guy, a friend that I worked with
[21:41.120 --> 21:43.200]  down at Rodale for 18 months.
[21:43.200 --> 21:45.040]  And, you know, he and I were, you know,
[21:45.040 --> 21:48.080]  just, you know, guys that were doing the work there.
[21:48.080 --> 21:51.360]  And, you know, he was all about the vermicompost
[21:51.360 --> 21:54.880]  and I was all about the fish waste.
[21:55.200 --> 21:56.920]  But when we started collaborating,
[21:56.920 --> 21:58.480]  oh man, we had so much fun.
[21:58.480 --> 22:02.280]  And the end result of his product was similar to yours
[22:02.280 --> 22:04.560]  in the essence that he did similar steps
[22:04.560 --> 22:07.800]  as far as collecting those feedstocks,
[22:07.800 --> 22:12.240]  as well as collecting fungally dominant bedding,
[22:13.200 --> 22:15.080]  feedstock, you know, like the chips
[22:15.080 --> 22:17.440]  that were covered with mycelium.
[22:17.440 --> 22:19.600]  And that was the key to his end result.
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.560]  But he would always have a, you know,
[22:21.560 --> 22:23.840]  really high fungi to bacterial,
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.240]  which is unusual in vermicompost
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.560]  because basically the worms are there to produce bacteria.
[22:31.560 --> 22:32.800]  Exactly, yep.
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.200]  So if you're getting a fungally dominant vermicompost
[22:36.200 --> 22:39.200]  at the end, you know, big ups to huge ups
[22:39.200 --> 22:41.720]  because that is the key to, you know,
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.760]  the best vermicompost around
[22:43.760 --> 22:46.040]  is having that fungal presence.
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.800]  Yeah, definitely proud of that for sure.
[22:47.800 --> 22:49.200]  Yeah, you should be proud of that.
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.160]  And let's bounce back into cover cropping.
[22:52.880 --> 22:55.520]  Dude, when I was down at Rodeo,
[22:55.520 --> 22:58.640]  Elaine was adamant that you keep your pile covered
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.960]  and don't let any plants in there
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.280]  and that they were gonna steal, you know, nutrients.
[23:03.280 --> 23:06.080]  And I was like the exact opposite.
[23:06.080 --> 23:10.320]  No, the plants are providing miles of rhizosphere
[23:10.320 --> 23:12.880]  and that's where all the magic is happening.
[23:12.880 --> 23:15.680]  So why would, yeah, why would you not do that?
[23:15.680 --> 23:19.880]  And why not let the plants protect the moisture level
[23:19.880 --> 23:21.440]  and tilt?
[23:21.440 --> 23:24.280]  So tell me more about what kind of cover crops
[23:24.280 --> 23:28.120]  you're playing with and how robust is the, you know,
[23:28.120 --> 23:33.120]  the amount of plants that are living on your end piles?
[23:33.320 --> 23:35.960]  Yeah, so we've definitely been doing some experimentation.
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.560]  You know, we did a lot of squash this past year
[23:40.560 --> 23:41.680]  because like those huge leaves,
[23:41.680 --> 23:43.560]  they just keep everything covered so well.
[23:43.560 --> 23:47.000]  And then we get a lot of food and a lot of stuff
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  that I ferment for like bloom feeding, you know,
[23:49.040 --> 23:52.920]  and so like there's a benefit to having a cover crop.
[23:52.920 --> 23:57.920]  It's going to give you, you know, a nice product at the end.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.720]  But other than that, so like,
[24:00.720 --> 24:02.760]  and we saw some issues with that.
[24:02.760 --> 24:06.560]  So like maybe we don't wanna grow these huge squash plants
[24:06.560 --> 24:08.920]  because they're taking so much moisture out of there,
[24:08.920 --> 24:11.600]  you know, so maybe it's not the most ideal
[24:11.600 --> 24:14.680]  because those huge tubers are like, you know,
[24:14.680 --> 24:17.160]  just entirely water weight.
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.000]  And so it started off that we had to water the pile
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.480]  way less, but then once they got huge, you know,
[24:22.480 --> 24:24.080]  they were just sucking everything out of there.
[24:24.080 --> 24:28.680]  And so like maybe squash isn't the best option for that,
[24:28.680 --> 24:31.240]  or maybe you just gotta keep them smaller.
[24:31.240 --> 24:34.160]  But other than that, we've been doing a blend
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.320]  of like hairy vetch and field peas, you know,
[24:38.320 --> 24:40.520]  fixate some of that nitrogen in there.
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.920]  And we've been doing some grasses
[24:46.480 --> 24:48.840]  and that's where like the, I think the more
[24:48.840 --> 24:53.200]  of the mycorrhizal culturing techniques come from.
[24:54.080 --> 24:55.320]  Is it ryegrass?
[24:56.520 --> 24:57.520]  Yeah, in Sudan.
[24:57.520 --> 24:58.360]  Sudan, yeah.
[24:58.360 --> 24:59.200]  Sudan, yeah, yeah.
[24:59.200 --> 25:00.280]  That's a real good one.
[25:00.280 --> 25:01.120]  For sure.
[25:01.120 --> 25:03.400]  And so like we have been experimenting with that
[25:03.400 --> 25:07.360]  and like if we should inoculate, you know,
[25:08.280 --> 25:11.280]  with mycorrhizal spores first, or like, you know,
[25:11.280 --> 25:12.760]  if they're naturally gonna be there.
[25:12.760 --> 25:15.040]  And so like that's something that's gonna come as we grow
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.040]  and like get more into testing and have, you know,
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.400]  funds to test as much as we want to, you know,
[25:19.400 --> 25:21.560]  like we can do these different trials
[25:21.560 --> 25:23.200]  and try to quantify it a little bit better.
[25:23.200 --> 25:24.960]  But right now we think, you know,
[25:24.960 --> 25:27.280]  like having those roots in there,
[25:27.280 --> 25:29.160]  there's clearly some magic happening
[25:29.160 --> 25:34.000]  that maybe we can't quantify as much as you'd like to,
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.760]  but that's soil in general, man.
[25:37.160 --> 25:38.680]  Like we're just scratching the surface of this stuff
[25:38.680 --> 25:41.160]  and like we don't know shit.
[25:41.160 --> 25:42.000]  And like-
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.560]  We're all in the same boat, man.
[25:43.560 --> 25:44.680]  We're all in the same boat.
[25:44.680 --> 25:46.680]  Some of this meta bar coding shit
[25:46.680 --> 25:50.600]  that we do in the communities of biology.
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.680]  And what we've learned now, which is even crazier,
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.760]  is the sap road fungi is pretty consistent
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.080]  throughout the entire cycle of the soil system,
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.760]  but the bacterial communities come and go so quickly.
[26:04.760 --> 26:05.600]  It's not funny.
[26:05.600 --> 26:08.000]  And we have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[26:08.000 --> 26:08.840]  No idea.
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.160]  So backing up to my mycorrhizae.
[26:12.160 --> 26:15.200]  So yeah, mycorrhizae does travel in the air.
[26:15.200 --> 26:18.880]  And if you've got local indigenous grasses
[26:18.880 --> 26:21.480]  that are growing and they're super healthy,
[26:21.480 --> 26:23.760]  chances are they are colonized.
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.320]  A trick that we used to use back in the day
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.200]  was literally go to, you know, beat up places,
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.360]  like, you know, disturbed soil alongside roadsides.
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.080]  And if you find this plant
[26:36.080 --> 26:38.320]  that is just absolutely thriving,
[26:38.320 --> 26:41.920]  dig it up and go back and put it on your compost pile.
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.480]  Now you just brought in all of the Vikings,
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.560]  the farm or survivors in the biological world.
[26:48.560 --> 26:51.000]  Chances are you're gonna have mycorrhizae,
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.840]  indigenous mycorrhizae on that plant.
[26:52.840 --> 26:53.680]  That's awesome, man.
[26:53.680 --> 26:55.880]  Otherwise, how the fuck is it surviving?
[26:55.880 --> 26:57.280]  How is it getting water?
[26:57.280 --> 26:58.680]  How is it getting nutrients?
[26:58.680 --> 26:59.600]  It can't.
[26:59.600 --> 27:01.720]  So the only way it's getting those nutrients
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.760]  and that water is through that mycorrhizae.
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.560]  So by digging it up and planting it in your pile,
[27:06.560 --> 27:08.360]  guess what you just did, brother?
[27:08.360 --> 27:09.320]  Awesome.
[27:09.320 --> 27:10.640]  So when you're saying that, like,
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.760]  along the roadside and these disturbed soils,
[27:12.760 --> 27:16.000]  we see a lot of mullein up here in disturbed soils.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.120]  And so like, do you happen to know
[27:18.120 --> 27:20.640]  if that plant in particular, you know-
[27:21.800 --> 27:22.880]  Well, put it this way.
[27:22.880 --> 27:27.880]  90% of all plants that we have studied and looked at
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.600]  are colonized or accept a certain level
[27:31.640 --> 27:33.760]  of colonization of mycorrhizae.
[27:33.760 --> 27:36.240]  So the answers are yes.
[27:36.240 --> 27:41.240]  There's a great resource, my friend Efren at Microroots.
[27:43.360 --> 27:44.400]  I think I got that right.
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.400]  He does the actual colonization rates of plants.
[27:50.200 --> 27:53.600]  So for cheap money, you could pull one of those things,
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.360]  send it off to him, and he would be able to tell you
[27:57.360 --> 28:00.160]  how colonized it actually is.
[28:00.160 --> 28:03.240]  And this is like one of those things that, you know,
[28:03.240 --> 28:06.320]  each plant is gonna want a different level of colonization.
[28:06.320 --> 28:08.280]  They're not gonna wanna give up, you know,
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.120]  they don't wanna let 100% colonization happen.
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.080]  As a matter of fact, you actually start getting
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.920]  diminishing returns in a lot of species
[28:15.920 --> 28:18.520]  at over 50% colonization,
[28:18.520 --> 28:20.120]  which is kind of weird if you think about it,
[28:20.120 --> 28:22.400]  because you'd think that they'd wanna have
[28:22.400 --> 28:25.120]  as much access to nutrients and water as possible.
[28:25.120 --> 28:26.800]  But there is a balance within the plant.
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.200]  They're giving the fungi something in exchange.
[28:30.200 --> 28:33.560]  So like maybe, yeah, they have to upregulate
[28:33.560 --> 28:37.120]  all the exudates to a point where it doesn't, yeah.
[28:37.120 --> 28:42.120]  Oh, and man, some of the work that's coming out now
[28:42.220 --> 28:46.800]  showing mycorrhizae as a highway,
[28:46.800 --> 28:50.960]  like literally on the outside of that hyphae
[28:50.960 --> 28:53.960]  is organisms going one way,
[28:53.960 --> 28:56.120]  the liquid inside is going the other way.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.880]  There's some thermodynamic, or not thermo,
[28:58.880 --> 29:01.280]  hydrodynamics that's going on,
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.360]  as well as the introduction of bacteria
[29:04.360 --> 29:07.440]  into the friggin' fungi itself
[29:07.440 --> 29:09.520]  and then traveling with the nutrients.
[29:09.520 --> 29:13.120]  So the plants are asking for, you know,
[29:13.120 --> 29:16.200]  biology, asking for nutrients, asking for water.
[29:16.200 --> 29:20.200]  So that colonization of mycorrhizae is so critical.
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.800]  And I'm willing to bet anything
[29:22.800 --> 29:24.800]  that that's one of the biggest problems
[29:24.800 --> 29:27.000]  we have in our climate right now
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.760]  is because every time you disturb the soil,
[29:29.760 --> 29:33.440]  it takes years for that stuff to come back and to operate.
[29:33.440 --> 29:36.200]  So where have we not disturbed soil?
[29:36.200 --> 29:37.960]  Very little places left.
[29:37.960 --> 29:41.280]  So that's why it's so important to foster,
[29:41.280 --> 29:44.360]  to nourish these types of organisms
[29:44.360 --> 29:46.960]  back into this decimated soil.
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.700]  So the work that you're doing there is providing just that.
[29:51.500 --> 29:54.900]  You know, you're by default fixing soil on scale,
[29:54.900 --> 29:57.020]  which is huge, dude, it's huge.
[29:57.020 --> 29:59.500]  That's what we're trying to do.
[29:59.500 --> 30:00.340]  You're doing it.
[30:00.340 --> 30:01.620]  Make it as easy as possible, you know,
[30:01.620 --> 30:05.780]  to inoculate these dead dirts and bring them back to soil.
[30:05.780 --> 30:08.700]  And, you know, the idea of bio-complete compost,
[30:08.700 --> 30:10.460]  you know, that has everything in there,
[30:10.460 --> 30:12.660]  you introduce it, it starts that communication
[30:12.660 --> 30:14.660]  with whatever plants it comes in contact with,
[30:14.660 --> 30:16.700]  and they figure it out, you know.
[30:16.700 --> 30:18.660]  It's introducing this bio-intelligence
[30:18.660 --> 30:21.660]  back to the system that's been decimated
[30:21.660 --> 30:22.780]  and really dumbed down.
[30:22.780 --> 30:26.860]  And like plants and microbes have been evolving
[30:26.860 --> 30:29.780]  and problem solving together for eons, you know.
[30:29.780 --> 30:32.420]  And it's just recently that we've separated them
[30:32.420 --> 30:35.460]  and tried to grow with these synthetic methods
[30:35.460 --> 30:39.780]  and to, you know, put these microbes out of a job,
[30:39.780 --> 30:41.140]  or, you know, like to,
[30:41.140 --> 30:43.020]  we've been killing these microbes
[30:43.020 --> 30:46.500]  and we've been feeding these plants directly,
[30:46.500 --> 30:49.460]  and we've made these plants absolutely dependent
[30:49.460 --> 30:51.220]  on our synthetic fertilizers.
[30:51.220 --> 30:54.500]  And they're not intelligent anymore,
[30:54.500 --> 30:57.020]  and our crops aren't nutrient dense anymore,
[30:57.020 --> 31:00.460]  and they're not full of the humic and fulvic acids
[31:00.460 --> 31:02.140]  that our soils once had.
[31:02.140 --> 31:06.340]  And so like, it's really accumulating really, really fast.
[31:06.340 --> 31:07.900]  And there's all sorts of health problems
[31:07.900 --> 31:08.860]  that are happening now,
[31:08.860 --> 31:11.740]  I think directly because of our broken soil.
[31:11.740 --> 31:14.340]  And so like, this is something that, you know,
[31:14.340 --> 31:15.940]  doctors aren't talking enough about,
[31:16.540 --> 31:19.540]  our broken food system and our broken health
[31:19.540 --> 31:21.380]  directly comes from our soil.
[31:21.380 --> 31:23.580]  Like soil health is human health.
[31:23.580 --> 31:25.820]  And like, it's something that we all need to
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.780]  pay a lot more attention to.
[31:27.780 --> 31:32.380]  And like, what can we be doing to inoculate our soil
[31:32.380 --> 31:34.580]  because it's decimated, it doesn't have the microbes.
[31:34.580 --> 31:37.140]  And then what can we do to like inoculate our guts
[31:37.140 --> 31:38.580]  because the same exact thing.
[31:38.580 --> 31:41.420]  And like the similarities between what's going on
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.500]  in the soil food web
[31:42.500 --> 31:44.420]  and like the nutrient cycling in our guts,
[31:44.660 --> 31:47.820]  the list of microbes in the soil and in our guts,
[31:47.820 --> 31:50.140]  it's like the same exact thing, man.
[31:50.140 --> 31:53.020]  We are humic beings, we are from the soil.
[31:53.020 --> 31:57.260]  And like, it's time people eat some mushrooms
[31:57.260 --> 32:02.260]  and roll around in the dirt and wake up to that, you know.
[32:02.500 --> 32:04.540]  Beautiful rant, brother, beautiful rant.
[32:04.540 --> 32:07.220]  Yeah, I don't know if this is common knowledge,
[32:07.220 --> 32:11.420]  but they don't even teach nutrition at medical school.
[32:11.420 --> 32:12.820]  No.
[32:12.820 --> 32:14.180]  Hello, that-
[32:14.180 --> 32:16.180]  Diet is everything.
[32:16.180 --> 32:18.180]  Food is all the medicine we need.
[32:18.180 --> 32:20.420]  We don't need pharmaceuticals.
[32:20.420 --> 32:23.260]  But yet the pharmaceutical industry
[32:23.260 --> 32:26.300]  is the one that started the medical schools
[32:26.300 --> 32:29.780]  and started taking over the medical industry.
[32:29.780 --> 32:31.180]  They don't want us healthy.
[32:32.060 --> 32:34.900]  The sicker we are, the more money we make them.
[32:34.900 --> 32:37.380]  That is the insanity of humanity.
[32:37.380 --> 32:39.340]  So guys like you and I are up again.
[32:40.340 --> 32:41.180]  Yeah.
[32:41.180 --> 32:43.220]  Good, you roll.
[32:43.220 --> 32:45.260]  One of my biggest realizations, you know,
[32:45.260 --> 32:48.180]  it's like just seeing how much they want us sick
[32:48.180 --> 32:49.820]  and reliant on them.
[32:49.820 --> 32:54.180]  And like, I think composting and regenerating soil
[32:54.180 --> 32:55.260]  and growing your own crops
[32:55.260 --> 32:58.380]  is like the most rebellious thing you could possibly do.
[32:58.380 --> 33:02.900]  And like, that's a big reason of why I got into all of this.
[33:02.900 --> 33:07.900]  And like, so I started growing when I was like 17
[33:08.420 --> 33:10.340]  in the back of the woods or whatever.
[33:10.340 --> 33:12.540]  But a couple of years later,
[33:13.980 --> 33:16.740]  I had the opportunity to buy like a used grow tent.
[33:16.740 --> 33:21.100]  And so I started growing and like pro mix
[33:21.100 --> 33:22.820]  with a couple of bottles of Fox Farms.
[33:22.820 --> 33:26.740]  And like, just realized that that shit was not for me at all.
[33:26.740 --> 33:28.900]  I hated pH up and pH down.
[33:28.900 --> 33:32.820]  And like, I was so disconnected from the plant,
[33:32.820 --> 33:34.300]  from the soil, from everything.
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.700]  And like, granted I was under some really cheap
[33:36.740 --> 33:39.660]  Chinese blurples and like didn't have the right genetics.
[33:39.660 --> 33:41.020]  And like, who knows what would have happened
[33:41.020 --> 33:42.220]  if I had everything.
[33:42.220 --> 33:45.860]  But basically I was like, this isn't for me.
[33:45.860 --> 33:47.980]  And so at that same time,
[33:47.980 --> 33:50.260]  I started looking at Instagram
[33:50.260 --> 33:52.340]  and seeing all these living soils
[33:52.340 --> 33:54.620]  and like the no till revolution hashtag
[33:54.620 --> 33:55.940]  was like a really big one.
[33:57.620 --> 34:02.220]  And I found Subcool's, you know, super soil recipe.
[34:02.220 --> 34:05.620]  And that led me to learning about earthworm castings.
[34:05.620 --> 34:08.580]  And like, I heard that like compost and castings,
[34:08.580 --> 34:11.700]  they were like the most important part of that mixture.
[34:11.700 --> 34:14.060]  And like, it was really important to find the good ones.
[34:14.060 --> 34:15.900]  And so that sent me down the rabbit hole
[34:15.900 --> 34:19.620]  of ordering a worm bin and worms
[34:19.620 --> 34:21.620]  from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm, you know,
[34:21.620 --> 34:25.700]  and composting my own food scraps.
[34:25.700 --> 34:30.340]  And I was a pretty poor and busy college student at the time
[34:30.340 --> 34:33.300]  and I quickly learned that I was not eating anything good
[34:33.300 --> 34:36.540]  and I couldn't put anything beneficial into my worm bin.
[34:36.540 --> 34:39.940]  And like, that was like a huge, you know,
[34:39.940 --> 34:43.940]  alarm for me that I couldn't produce good compost
[34:43.940 --> 34:45.340]  because I was eating like trash.
[34:45.340 --> 34:47.500]  And so like, I started eating better,
[34:47.500 --> 34:49.300]  cooking at home more, you know,
[34:49.300 --> 34:52.060]  and giving my worms good scraps
[34:52.060 --> 34:55.140]  and they created fantastic compost.
[34:55.140 --> 34:57.300]  And I was like, I just saw that connection
[34:57.300 --> 35:02.300]  and like composting is like life after death
[35:02.460 --> 35:05.380]  and like you don't view waste as waste anymore.
[35:05.380 --> 35:07.780]  You don't view things as like the end of the line.
[35:07.780 --> 35:09.580]  It's just another stop on the journey.
[35:09.580 --> 35:13.260]  And like, you can regenerate this waste
[35:13.260 --> 35:15.020]  and create beautiful black gold.
[35:15.020 --> 35:17.780]  Like, and so I was just absolutely hooked.
[35:17.780 --> 35:22.380]  And so I was looking up everything
[35:22.380 --> 35:23.580]  about the worms and everything.
[35:23.580 --> 35:25.420]  And then one day I hopped on Instagram
[35:25.420 --> 35:27.820]  and some artificial intelligence
[35:27.820 --> 35:29.180]  because of my search history,
[35:29.180 --> 35:33.180]  sent me a link to an advertisement for wormies.
[35:33.180 --> 35:35.540]  And that's how I found that somebody was right here
[35:35.540 --> 35:38.620]  in my city composting.
[35:38.620 --> 35:41.940]  And like the post said like protozoa and nematodes
[35:41.940 --> 35:43.700]  and, you know, beneficial bacteria
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.580]  and all these words that I was literally just learning.
[35:45.580 --> 35:47.220]  And I was like, holy fuck, you know,
[35:47.220 --> 35:48.940]  somebody teach me how to do this.
[35:48.940 --> 35:53.940]  And so that's one good example of artificial intelligence,
[35:54.220 --> 35:57.340]  but like how it's benefited me.
[35:57.340 --> 35:58.180]  But yeah.
[36:00.380 --> 36:02.540]  I tend to call that the universe hard at work.
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.580]  Yeah, for real.
[36:04.580 --> 36:06.140]  More so than artificial intelligence.
[36:06.140 --> 36:07.700]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[36:07.700 --> 36:10.580]  But I love what you talk about soil intelligence.
[36:10.580 --> 36:13.940]  And that's a word that we need to use more
[36:13.940 --> 36:16.420]  is understanding that that communication
[36:16.420 --> 36:21.420]  between the plants and soil and us is just important.
[36:23.220 --> 36:25.580]  So yeah, dude, you're doing the fucking work.
[36:25.620 --> 36:29.580]  And I love the way you talked about, you know,
[36:29.580 --> 36:33.260]  your own health because you learned it by default
[36:33.260 --> 36:34.580]  because of the worms.
[36:34.580 --> 36:37.380]  I mean, you know, that's something maybe
[36:37.380 --> 36:41.460]  that would spark the next generation to begin to say,
[36:41.460 --> 36:43.820]  hey, I don't wanna eat this shit anymore
[36:43.820 --> 36:46.300]  because it kills my fucking worms.
[36:46.300 --> 36:47.140]  Right?
[36:47.140 --> 36:47.980]  For real.
[36:47.980 --> 36:48.820]  You know, if they looked at-
[36:48.820 --> 36:49.900]  What's that doing to me?
[36:49.900 --> 36:50.740]  Right, right.
[36:50.740 --> 36:53.460]  If they looked at worms as kitty cats and dogs
[36:53.460 --> 36:55.700]  and, you know, every kid had to have one
[36:55.700 --> 36:58.740]  to get through fourth grade or whatever.
[36:58.740 --> 37:01.180]  They had to learn how to take care of those worms.
[37:01.180 --> 37:02.020]  Well.
[37:02.020 --> 37:05.180]  Imagine the impact of the next generation would have.
[37:05.180 --> 37:08.340]  So maybe we could start a school revolution.
[37:08.340 --> 37:09.660]  Dude, that's something that Wormies
[37:09.660 --> 37:12.420]  has been really big into is we teach, you know,
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.380]  educational programs to all ages,
[37:14.380 --> 37:16.220]  but like we're at elementary schools
[37:16.220 --> 37:18.100]  multiple times a year, you know,
[37:18.100 --> 37:20.860]  and we have field trips come out to the farm
[37:20.860 --> 37:22.460]  and like the kids love the worms
[37:22.460 --> 37:23.740]  and they love getting dirty.
[37:23.740 --> 37:28.740]  And like, it's crazy that like we lose that imagination
[37:29.340 --> 37:32.420]  as we grow older and we don't wanna get dirty anymore.
[37:33.540 --> 37:35.140]  And now like a lot of parents
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.740]  like don't even want their kids to get dirty
[37:36.740 --> 37:40.220]  and now they're not inoculating themselves with good soil.
[37:40.220 --> 37:41.980]  You know, they're not getting their hands in the dirt.
[37:41.980 --> 37:44.620]  And I think that's really important
[37:44.620 --> 37:47.220]  to our immune systems and everything, you know,
[37:47.220 --> 37:50.100]  is like from a young age to be able to roll around
[37:50.100 --> 37:53.500]  in some soil, get your hands in some compost.
[37:53.500 --> 37:54.860]  Healthy soil, right?
[37:54.860 --> 37:55.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:56.740 --> 37:57.580]  Exactly.
[37:57.580 --> 38:01.780]  There's some real deep work being done
[38:01.780 --> 38:06.260]  on actual the negative effect of C-sections
[38:07.500 --> 38:09.980]  because they're not going through the birth canal.
[38:09.980 --> 38:14.620]  They're not getting that critical immune building biology
[38:14.620 --> 38:17.740]  out of the gate and then compound that
[38:17.740 --> 38:20.980]  by not allowing your kid to play in the swamp
[38:20.980 --> 38:24.100]  and in the dirt and come home with dirty fingernails
[38:24.100 --> 38:26.460]  and, you know, eating pies.
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.300]  Come on, we used to do that shit as kids.
[38:28.300 --> 38:30.220]  It was part of growing up.
[38:30.220 --> 38:34.500]  And so now you've got minimal immune system.
[38:34.500 --> 38:39.500]  You've got minimal gut biota and biological biota.
[38:41.180 --> 38:42.980]  And now you're washing your hands
[38:42.980 --> 38:45.660]  with antimicrobial fucking soap.
[38:45.700 --> 38:47.580]  Of course you're gonna get fucking sick, right?
[38:47.580 --> 38:48.420]  For real.
[38:48.420 --> 38:50.260]  99% of everything.
[38:50.260 --> 38:51.100]  Every day.
[38:52.380 --> 38:55.260]  And so by you bringing that awareness to kids
[38:55.260 --> 38:58.220]  at an early age and getting them about it,
[38:58.220 --> 38:59.940]  dude, man, that's huge.
[38:59.940 --> 39:01.140]  That's freaking huge.
[39:01.140 --> 39:04.860]  That's the only way we're gonna save this humanity.
[39:04.860 --> 39:05.860]  I agree, man.
[39:05.860 --> 39:10.060]  Is by education, education, education.
[39:10.060 --> 39:11.740]  So, you know, maybe you ought to do
[39:11.740 --> 39:13.620]  is give these kids a little worm box.
[39:13.660 --> 39:14.500]  That's right.
[39:14.500 --> 39:17.380]  Hey, take that collar off.
[39:17.380 --> 39:18.420]  Yeah, mother fucker.
[39:23.940 --> 39:26.460]  No, but maybe that would be the thing is like, you know,
[39:26.460 --> 39:29.540]  like a little cardboard box or something that, you know,
[39:29.540 --> 39:32.020]  you can get affordably or recycled
[39:32.020 --> 39:34.860]  and send these kids home with like five worms
[39:34.860 --> 39:37.540]  and say, hey, feed these worms really good food
[39:37.540 --> 39:38.540]  like you should be eating
[39:38.540 --> 39:40.940]  and you'll see how they'll grow and multiply.
[39:40.940 --> 39:41.820]  And then you can release them
[39:41.820 --> 39:43.420]  in your mom's garden in spring.
[39:44.220 --> 39:45.060]  Man, I love that idea.
[39:45.060 --> 39:46.140]  We'll definitely do that.
[39:46.140 --> 39:47.100]  Dude, that'd be huge.
[39:47.100 --> 39:48.700]  And you know what?
[39:48.700 --> 39:50.460]  I'm working with some companies out here
[39:50.460 --> 39:52.660]  who will be starting to,
[39:52.660 --> 39:55.260]  the permitting process in California is insane.
[39:55.260 --> 39:56.620]  And Peter will tell you about this.
[39:56.620 --> 39:58.540]  It's just absurd.
[39:59.460 --> 40:02.500]  They've been trying to get a large scale vermicomposting
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.060]  for I believe it's six years now
[40:05.060 --> 40:07.060]  that the CDC has been dragging this company
[40:07.060 --> 40:09.020]  through the fucking mud and billing them
[40:09.020 --> 40:10.980]  and feeding them to death.
[40:10.980 --> 40:13.780]  But I believe they finally have the final paperwork
[40:13.780 --> 40:16.100]  and they will be able to begin construction
[40:16.100 --> 40:19.180]  sometime in January on a nice scale system.
[40:19.180 --> 40:21.340]  And if that happens, dude,
[40:21.340 --> 40:22.780]  I'm gonna do the same fucking thing.
[40:22.780 --> 40:26.020]  Find a way to make these little worm boxes
[40:26.020 --> 40:27.500]  and distribute them to kids
[40:27.500 --> 40:30.900]  and get that ball rolling
[40:30.900 --> 40:32.660]  because someone has to do it, dude.
[40:32.660 --> 40:34.740]  And if we don't, nobody is.
[40:36.100 --> 40:36.940]  No, I love that.
[40:36.940 --> 40:37.780]  That's the thing is like,
[40:37.780 --> 40:39.460]  you can look at it like planting seeds
[40:39.460 --> 40:42.340]  or like inoculating whoever you're teaching
[40:42.340 --> 40:43.340]  with this information.
[40:43.340 --> 40:45.540]  And like, they're gonna take this information,
[40:45.540 --> 40:46.620]  they're going to combine it
[40:46.620 --> 40:48.460]  with their own life skills or whatever.
[40:48.460 --> 40:50.220]  And then they're going to take it back
[40:50.220 --> 40:52.380]  to their communities and inoculate others.
[40:52.380 --> 40:53.780]  And that network spreads,
[40:53.780 --> 40:55.780]  and that knowledge spreads.
[40:55.780 --> 40:59.460]  That's how we do these things is by hosting events like this
[40:59.460 --> 41:01.620]  and like the compost cups and like,
[41:01.620 --> 41:03.460]  just doing our best to educate people.
[41:03.460 --> 41:06.420]  And what's really cool about the compost cups
[41:06.420 --> 41:08.380]  or like any event is like,
[41:08.420 --> 41:10.780]  there's just some magic about getting together in person,
[41:10.780 --> 41:12.460]  you know, and getting to share the herb
[41:12.460 --> 41:14.620]  that you're most proud of and everything.
[41:14.620 --> 41:19.260]  And we went for like a UV lit mushroom walk.
[41:19.260 --> 41:20.180]  I don't know if you guys have ever seen
[41:20.180 --> 41:22.500]  those bioluminescent mushrooms,
[41:22.500 --> 41:25.740]  but we're all, a lot of us,
[41:25.740 --> 41:27.100]  we're tripping balls in the woods,
[41:27.100 --> 41:28.980]  you know, with these UV mushrooms.
[41:28.980 --> 41:29.820]  I love it.
[41:29.820 --> 41:30.660]  And like, oh my God.
[41:30.660 --> 41:31.500]  You knew it with that face, man.
[41:31.500 --> 41:33.060]  You didn't have to do that.
[41:33.060 --> 41:34.780]  Yeah, it was a good time.
[41:34.780 --> 41:37.460]  All kinds of avatar crazy shit, right?
[41:37.460 --> 41:39.060]  Honestly, yeah.
[41:41.220 --> 41:42.060]  Go ahead.
[41:42.060 --> 41:43.700]  For getting into the like the nitty gritty,
[41:43.700 --> 41:45.980]  like at your level, you know,
[41:45.980 --> 41:48.420]  how do you feel about like using worms
[41:48.420 --> 41:51.100]  to compost meats and citrus and stuff?
[41:51.100 --> 41:53.100]  I know some people say that you can do that.
[41:53.100 --> 41:55.380]  Other people say, why bother?
[41:55.380 --> 41:57.540]  At the level that you're at, how do you feel?
[41:57.540 --> 41:59.820]  Especially if you have, I would imagine in time,
[41:59.820 --> 42:01.140]  I don't know now, do you have access
[42:01.140 --> 42:02.700]  to where you have millions of worms?
[42:02.700 --> 42:04.540]  Because it's supposedly at that level,
[42:04.540 --> 42:07.300]  meat and citrus doesn't seem to matter as much.
[42:08.140 --> 42:09.500]  Yeah, so I think the main problem with like meat
[42:09.500 --> 42:11.820]  is like pest problems.
[42:11.820 --> 42:13.780]  Like it's gonna attract rodents or whatever.
[42:13.780 --> 42:15.660]  And unless you have it closed in,
[42:17.300 --> 42:19.700]  then you're gonna attract some pests
[42:19.700 --> 42:21.180]  that you probably don't wanna have.
[42:21.180 --> 42:24.460]  But I'd feel more comfortable like composting meat
[42:24.460 --> 42:26.620]  through the Bokashi composting process
[42:26.620 --> 42:28.940]  where it's all contained and it can all,
[42:28.940 --> 42:30.940]  you know, ferment and eat itself.
[42:30.940 --> 42:32.420]  And then from there,
[42:32.420 --> 42:35.140]  tossing that into these big worm piles.
[42:35.140 --> 42:40.100]  But yeah, I think citrus is no problem at all
[42:40.100 --> 42:43.540]  with how much it's diluted and with all this other biomass.
[42:43.540 --> 42:45.780]  It's like, obviously you don't wanna put your worms
[42:45.780 --> 42:48.020]  in a bin full of citrus, it's way too acidic.
[42:48.020 --> 42:51.300]  And I've heard a story about, you know, somebody putting,
[42:51.300 --> 42:53.220]  they're going on vacation and they put like a half
[42:53.220 --> 42:54.860]  of pineapple on their worm bin.
[42:54.860 --> 42:58.220]  You know, just keep them fed for the week, you know?
[42:58.220 --> 43:00.660]  And they came back and their worms were all like melted
[43:00.660 --> 43:03.420]  and it's like terrible to hear.
[43:04.180 --> 43:06.300]  So like, you don't wanna overdo citrus,
[43:06.300 --> 43:08.900]  but I think like on a large enough scale.
[43:08.900 --> 43:10.420]  And if you're not, you know,
[43:10.420 --> 43:14.100]  if it's part of a larger mix, then it's all good.
[43:14.100 --> 43:15.700]  Layton, do you have anything about that?
[43:15.700 --> 43:17.660]  Yeah, I'd love to hit on that meat.
[43:17.660 --> 43:20.140]  You're absolutely right about the meat.
[43:20.140 --> 43:21.540]  It will bring in pests.
[43:21.540 --> 43:26.540]  And another thing too is that the worms don't eat the food.
[43:26.700 --> 43:27.940]  They eat the bacteria.
[43:27.940 --> 43:28.780]  Exactly.
[43:28.780 --> 43:29.940]  That are present on the food.
[43:29.940 --> 43:33.300]  So meat takes too long to break down
[43:34.180 --> 43:37.620]  and it starts to rot and smell and bring in pests and flies
[43:37.620 --> 43:39.140]  and all kinds of other things.
[43:39.140 --> 43:42.980]  So your suggestion on Bokashi is spot on.
[43:42.980 --> 43:44.860]  So this buddy of mine, Craig Tester,
[43:44.860 --> 43:47.220]  he's part of my study group, weekly study group.
[43:48.100 --> 43:52.620]  And he's come up with a method of basically a JDOM ferment.
[43:52.620 --> 43:55.340]  So he puts all that shit in a big toter,
[43:55.340 --> 43:57.460]  puts a bunch of screens or a screen
[43:57.460 --> 43:58.980]  and a bunch of weights on it.
[43:58.980 --> 44:02.340]  So that all of that is below the water level.
[44:02.340 --> 44:05.500]  And then he waits about five days and guess what?
[44:05.500 --> 44:07.260]  He's got a vinaigrette.
[44:07.260 --> 44:09.620]  And not only is it a vinaigrette,
[44:09.620 --> 44:11.420]  but it's a wetting agent.
[44:11.420 --> 44:12.540]  It's surfactant.
[44:12.540 --> 44:14.380]  So you can take that shit.
[44:14.380 --> 44:16.340]  It doesn't stink.
[44:16.340 --> 44:19.820]  And you can spray it on raw ground up organic matter
[44:19.820 --> 44:22.620]  or unmatured compost.
[44:22.620 --> 44:26.820]  And it will literally suck into the fiber.
[44:26.820 --> 44:29.580]  And better yet, it's full of secondary
[44:29.620 --> 44:32.420]  and tertiary metabolites that feed the biology
[44:32.420 --> 44:35.340]  on a quick short-term method.
[44:35.340 --> 44:36.900]  So it's just a win-win-win.
[44:36.900 --> 44:38.660]  So that's the best way to handle it.
[44:38.660 --> 44:41.580]  And you basically are doing that with Bokashi.
[44:41.580 --> 44:42.940]  Yeah, man, that's awesome.
[44:45.100 --> 44:46.900]  Maybe that's a little trick you can try as well.
[44:46.900 --> 44:47.740]  Yeah, for sure.
[44:47.740 --> 44:48.940]  We're always down to experiment
[44:48.940 --> 44:51.180]  and try something new for sure.
[44:51.180 --> 44:52.700]  Yeah, it's spot on about the citrus
[44:52.700 --> 44:54.700]  because it definitely affects pH.
[44:54.700 --> 44:57.220]  So that's one of those low and slow.
[44:57.220 --> 44:58.460]  Too much of that stuff
[44:58.460 --> 45:01.260]  definitely cause problems for sure.
[45:01.260 --> 45:03.260]  The job I'm working on out here on GOM,
[45:03.260 --> 45:08.260]  they get bins of lemons.
[45:09.020 --> 45:10.820]  And it's like, they all come at once.
[45:10.820 --> 45:14.860]  So Dave Green, the manager of Agri-Min's facilities out here
[45:14.860 --> 45:18.740]  is always struggling with how best to incorporate them
[45:18.740 --> 45:23.300]  into the compost without drastically affecting the pH
[45:23.300 --> 45:25.380]  and shutting it down.
[45:25.420 --> 45:29.660]  So yeah, there'll be some fun work this year
[45:29.660 --> 45:31.780]  while I'm playing with them to better understand
[45:31.780 --> 45:36.780]  how to perhaps break that citrus down a little bit more
[45:37.740 --> 45:40.380]  before introducing it into the pile.
[45:40.380 --> 45:43.580]  But yeah, I haven't started that one yet.
[45:43.580 --> 45:46.340]  I got a few other ones in the front of it.
[45:46.340 --> 45:48.500]  Oh yeah, there's always something else.
[45:48.500 --> 45:49.740]  But great question, Bragg.
[45:49.740 --> 45:50.860]  Great question.
[45:50.860 --> 45:52.740]  Well, in addition, appreciate that.
[45:53.700 --> 45:55.780]  When we're then taking it to the next level,
[45:55.780 --> 45:57.500]  are you using other decomposers?
[45:57.500 --> 45:59.060]  Like, are you going out of your way?
[45:59.060 --> 46:00.340]  I know before we went on air,
[46:00.340 --> 46:02.260]  Peter asked if you were using the black soldier fly.
[46:02.260 --> 46:04.380]  You said no, but that's something you wanted to get into.
[46:04.380 --> 46:07.940]  Are you naturally maybe getting the springtails to show up?
[46:07.940 --> 46:09.300]  Oh my God, dude.
[46:09.300 --> 46:12.220]  So we call it wormies and we give the credit to the worms,
[46:12.220 --> 46:14.900]  but literally we got the whole entire soil food web there.
[46:14.900 --> 46:17.820]  And like, we need to give more credit to them.
[46:17.820 --> 46:22.460]  Like I tried to, but like we got springtails and pill bugs,
[46:22.740 --> 46:27.220]  just shredding all sorts of arabidites or orbit,
[46:27.220 --> 46:29.300]  however you say it, but like the shredding mites.
[46:29.300 --> 46:30.500]  The orbital mites, yeah.
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.020]  That's how I say it.
[46:32.020 --> 46:33.220]  Layton, you can probably correct it.
[46:33.220 --> 46:36.220]  The gamesis and the orobotids or whatever the...
[46:36.220 --> 46:39.060]  No, keep it without the Greek terms, man.
[46:39.060 --> 46:40.740]  No, man, for real.
[46:40.740 --> 46:42.900]  We got all sorts of shredders in there
[46:42.900 --> 46:45.020]  that take this organic matter
[46:45.020 --> 46:46.900]  and they're incredibly good at shredding it down
[46:46.900 --> 46:50.260]  into pieces that are small enough for the microbes
[46:50.260 --> 46:52.740]  to further nutrient cycle.
[46:52.740 --> 46:55.740]  And yeah, like Layton mentioned earlier,
[46:57.180 --> 46:59.140]  the worms aren't actually eating the food scraps
[46:59.140 --> 47:00.700]  or anything, they're eating the microbes
[47:00.700 --> 47:01.620]  that are eating everything.
[47:01.620 --> 47:04.500]  It's like, we have all these shredders breaking down
[47:04.500 --> 47:06.820]  all these big pieces into small enough pieces.
[47:06.820 --> 47:09.660]  And then these worms come and they eat these microbes
[47:09.660 --> 47:10.780]  that are eating all that stuff.
[47:10.780 --> 47:14.100]  And like, it was like a big realization to me
[47:14.100 --> 47:17.180]  once I started working there a lot is like,
[47:17.180 --> 47:19.860]  I'm not a worm farmer, I'm a microbe farmer.
[47:20.460 --> 47:23.900]  And you gotta create the conditions for these microbes
[47:23.900 --> 47:25.300]  because that's what the worms are after.
[47:25.300 --> 47:28.340]  And like moisture content is absolutely vital.
[47:28.340 --> 47:31.540]  Like you don't want things on the dry end
[47:31.540 --> 47:34.860]  because these microbes need, they're aquatic.
[47:34.860 --> 47:37.020]  They need that biofilm, they need that bit of water
[47:37.020 --> 47:39.860]  to move around and set up colony.
[47:39.860 --> 47:44.740]  And if it dries out, then your microbes aren't thriving
[47:44.740 --> 47:46.220]  and then your worms aren't thriving.
[47:46.260 --> 47:50.380]  So like, you really want to focus on moisture content
[47:50.380 --> 47:51.220]  is what I'm getting at.
[47:51.220 --> 47:55.220]  Oh, dude, that is one of the biggest problems.
[47:55.220 --> 47:57.340]  People freak out because they overwater
[47:57.340 --> 47:58.860]  or underwater their plants.
[47:59.700 --> 48:01.700]  Compost is even more critical.
[48:02.540 --> 48:05.420]  Understanding that those microbes are breaking off
[48:05.420 --> 48:09.020]  either the hydrogen or the oxygen from the water
[48:09.020 --> 48:14.020]  to fuel their processes of digesting the nitrogen and carbon.
[48:14.220 --> 48:18.860]  So it's all part of a cycle that's so critical.
[48:18.860 --> 48:22.540]  And when you start to understand that the smaller
[48:22.540 --> 48:25.340]  the particle, the more surface area it has,
[48:25.340 --> 48:29.740]  the more colonization it can happen, the more biofilm.
[48:29.740 --> 48:33.620]  So you have start with the hydrogen being broken off,
[48:33.620 --> 48:38.020]  the oxygen being broken off, allowing for more biology,
[48:38.020 --> 48:41.460]  allowing for more biofilm, allowing for just expand,
[48:41.460 --> 48:44.460]  expand, expand, expand exponentially.
[48:44.460 --> 48:47.980]  And so, yeah, those are some really, really important things
[48:47.980 --> 48:51.220]  for people to understand whether it's vermicompost
[48:51.220 --> 48:52.380]  or regular compost.
[48:52.380 --> 48:54.900]  If you do not have the right moisture level,
[48:54.900 --> 48:56.620]  you're gonna have all kinds of imbalances
[48:56.620 --> 48:58.660]  and you're not going to get to that end result
[48:58.660 --> 49:01.580]  as quickly as you want, which is the ultimate
[49:01.580 --> 49:04.140]  bio-complete soil food web compost.
[49:04.140 --> 49:06.940]  Yeah, kudos for you to bring them that up.
[49:06.940 --> 49:09.420]  That is really important.
[49:09.420 --> 49:10.940]  Thank you, well said.
[49:11.380 --> 49:12.820]  When we're getting it to the next level
[49:12.820 --> 49:15.620]  and we're, you know, optimal conditions and stuff like that,
[49:15.620 --> 49:17.140]  it always seemed like we were right,
[49:17.140 --> 49:19.780]  we were moving on 90 days.
[49:19.780 --> 49:22.140]  It seemed like composting worms reproduce
[49:22.140 --> 49:24.540]  whatever they had, or this is what we were kind of taught.
[49:24.540 --> 49:26.300]  So if you start with a thousand worms,
[49:26.300 --> 49:29.700]  every 90 days, then 2000, another 90 days, 4000.
[49:29.700 --> 49:31.460]  And so you could kind of base that kind of stuff.
[49:31.460 --> 49:33.940]  Do you see that on the same level that you're at,
[49:33.940 --> 49:37.180]  that they, in again, optimal conditions with the right feed,
[49:37.180 --> 49:39.780]  that they really can produce that quickly?
[49:39.780 --> 49:42.220]  Yeah, they reproduce like crazy.
[49:42.220 --> 49:44.580]  You can take a handful out of pretty much anywhere
[49:44.580 --> 49:46.500]  and find worms and worm cocoons.
[49:46.500 --> 49:49.140]  And you know, each cocoon has between one
[49:49.140 --> 49:50.980]  and like 20 baby worms in there.
[49:50.980 --> 49:54.260]  But basically like only between like one and five
[49:54.260 --> 49:58.380]  will actually survive, but there's no shortage
[49:58.380 --> 50:00.500]  of worms at all.
[50:00.500 --> 50:03.180]  Yeah, it seems like once everything kind of takes off,
[50:03.180 --> 50:04.740]  that's, we've always kind of used the words,
[50:04.740 --> 50:07.540]  it comes alive and then it becomes thriving.
[50:07.540 --> 50:08.380]  Yeah.
[50:08.380 --> 50:10.060]  It seems like if you stay on focus,
[50:10.060 --> 50:12.180]  especially if you're the newer worm farmer,
[50:12.180 --> 50:14.100]  if you really focus on those 90 days
[50:14.100 --> 50:15.780]  and you're seeing stuff really start to improve,
[50:15.780 --> 50:17.260]  that's when you can start to incorporate
[50:17.260 --> 50:19.820]  a lot of the ideas, the avocado tech,
[50:19.820 --> 50:21.980]  the other things that are kind of like,
[50:21.980 --> 50:26.500]  you know, allowing you to play around and improve things.
[50:26.500 --> 50:29.660]  I know that we had briefly mentioned on red wigglers,
[50:29.660 --> 50:30.660]  like what do you think?
[50:30.660 --> 50:33.300]  Cause I've personally in the larger bins,
[50:33.300 --> 50:35.820]  simple worm farming, if it's a hundred gallon,
[50:35.820 --> 50:37.980]  it seems like I could use night crawlers,
[50:37.980 --> 50:40.740]  European as well as the African.
[50:40.740 --> 50:43.340]  And then I would use a little bit of the lava rock
[50:43.340 --> 50:47.580]  and then I would go heavy with the Alabama jumpers,
[50:47.580 --> 50:48.420]  Georgia jumpers.
[50:48.420 --> 50:50.940]  And it seemed like they would stay down there for a while.
[50:50.940 --> 50:54.380]  I didn't ever, I haven't disturbed the soil that deep
[50:54.380 --> 50:56.460]  to kind of see what's going on.
[50:56.460 --> 50:57.500]  What are your thoughts on that?
[50:57.500 --> 50:58.740]  Do you feel like, I've always called it
[50:58.740 --> 51:02.100]  like the four horsemen of, do you think that's overkill?
[51:02.100 --> 51:04.140]  I just love to hear your theory on that.
[51:04.140 --> 51:06.340]  I mean, if you're into trying that stuff out,
[51:06.340 --> 51:07.780]  then no, it's not overkill.
[51:07.780 --> 51:10.460]  This is all fun stuff to learn from, you know?
[51:10.460 --> 51:12.340]  But yeah, like I said,
[51:12.340 --> 51:13.780]  I really don't have much experience
[51:13.780 --> 51:15.180]  besides the red wigglers
[51:15.180 --> 51:18.020]  and the night crawlers that occasionally come.
[51:19.220 --> 51:21.060]  But yeah, that's super interesting to,
[51:21.060 --> 51:23.060]  you said that you have like two different species
[51:23.060 --> 51:26.100]  that are kind of separated by like the lava rock.
[51:27.700 --> 51:29.780]  I, you know, put the lava rock out
[51:29.780 --> 51:32.620]  and then I'll usually, unbeknownst,
[51:32.780 --> 51:36.580]  this is really before Layton and I became friends,
[51:36.580 --> 51:38.020]  using the sphagnum peat moss.
[51:38.020 --> 51:40.740]  So I would heavily do the sphagnum peat moss.
[51:40.740 --> 51:42.860]  And then there would be more of like the night crawlers
[51:42.860 --> 51:45.380]  that seemed to be building the dissolved oxygen channels.
[51:45.380 --> 51:47.900]  And then I was constantly feeding the organic matter,
[51:47.900 --> 51:51.380]  feeding really the soil food web on top,
[51:51.380 --> 51:53.620]  and then boosting the red wiggler population.
[51:53.620 --> 51:57.980]  So very minimal jumpers, very minimal night crawlers.
[51:57.980 --> 51:59.780]  And that seemed like they,
[51:59.820 --> 52:02.900]  it seemed like they were balanced things out on their own.
[52:02.900 --> 52:04.900]  Yeah, I totally believe that for sure.
[52:04.900 --> 52:07.100]  The worms are crazy good at balancing it.
[52:07.100 --> 52:09.380]  And like, they won't overpopulate themselves
[52:09.380 --> 52:13.820]  if food is running low, you know, like they're smart.
[52:13.820 --> 52:16.100]  And they'll get out of the way if things are too hot
[52:16.100 --> 52:18.300]  or if they're too acidic or whatever,
[52:18.300 --> 52:21.100]  they'll go to the side and they'll find a spot
[52:21.100 --> 52:23.420]  that they can survive.
[52:23.420 --> 52:24.860]  And so like, that's another benefit
[52:24.860 --> 52:26.820]  of having them right on the ground, you know,
[52:26.860 --> 52:30.420]  is like one, we don't introduce them
[52:30.420 --> 52:31.500]  if the piles are too hot,
[52:31.500 --> 52:32.860]  we got the thermometers and everything.
[52:32.860 --> 52:35.380]  But like, if things were to spike in temperature
[52:35.380 --> 52:36.660]  for whatever reason, you know,
[52:36.660 --> 52:38.020]  like they're gonna get out of there
[52:38.020 --> 52:40.820]  and we're not gonna cook our worms.
[52:40.820 --> 52:43.100]  So, and then they'll come right back
[52:43.100 --> 52:44.860]  because that's where everything is.
[52:44.860 --> 52:47.420]  That like, why would you rather be somewhere else
[52:47.420 --> 52:50.380]  when there's an all you can eat buffet right there?
[52:50.380 --> 52:52.060]  Yeah, you know, I'd love to touch on that
[52:52.060 --> 52:53.780]  just real briefly is that,
[52:53.780 --> 52:55.820]  that was the first time I'd ever seen Richard
[52:55.820 --> 52:56.660]  down at Rodale,
[52:56.660 --> 52:59.060]  was the first time I'd ever seen somebody do
[52:59.060 --> 53:01.620]  what I wanna call free range, which is what you're doing.
[53:01.620 --> 53:05.180]  Free range compost, not in a container.
[53:05.180 --> 53:07.580]  And he, what he would do is pile up hay bales
[53:07.580 --> 53:09.660]  all the way around the outside,
[53:09.660 --> 53:13.220]  put his bedding in so that it went halfway up the hay bales.
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.940]  And he would set these farms up at different farmers,
[53:15.940 --> 53:17.660]  organic farmers.
[53:17.660 --> 53:19.900]  And the organic farmers would just throw all their drops
[53:19.900 --> 53:22.700]  or things that didn't sell onto the pile,
[53:22.700 --> 53:24.900]  it would roll down the sides
[53:24.900 --> 53:28.820]  and get trapped between the hay and the pile.
[53:28.820 --> 53:30.020]  You go in and work through it
[53:30.020 --> 53:31.980]  and then go back into the center of the pile.
[53:31.980 --> 53:33.540]  Nice, yeah.
[53:33.540 --> 53:38.540]  So it was a great way of continuously feeding the worms
[53:40.140 --> 53:41.980]  without ever getting to a situation
[53:41.980 --> 53:43.700]  where shit went anaerobic.
[53:43.700 --> 53:45.060]  Cause if it did go anaerobic,
[53:45.060 --> 53:47.420]  it was just on the very sides.
[53:47.420 --> 53:49.460]  Eventually they'd work their way into it.
[53:49.460 --> 53:51.660]  But, you know, it was just, again,
[53:51.660 --> 53:53.780]  with these flow through systems,
[53:53.780 --> 53:58.100]  I think they are missing these critical connections
[53:58.100 --> 54:03.100]  to earth and what I would call natural biological systems,
[54:04.180 --> 54:06.300]  not introduced to biology.
[54:06.300 --> 54:09.140]  So again, you know, huge kudos to you
[54:09.140 --> 54:11.620]  for doing this, you know, free range.
[54:11.620 --> 54:12.460]  I think you probably-
[54:12.460 --> 54:13.300]  I love it, yeah.
[54:13.300 --> 54:14.820]  We should start saying that, free range.
[54:14.820 --> 54:15.660]  Marketing term.
[54:15.660 --> 54:17.100]  Yeah, marketing.
[54:17.100 --> 54:18.540]  Our worms are free range.
[54:18.540 --> 54:19.660]  Yeah, come on, Brian.
[54:19.660 --> 54:21.820]  You're all about the marketing, man, right?
[54:21.820 --> 54:23.020]  For sure.
[54:23.020 --> 54:26.540]  I do want to say one thing about Georgia jumpers.
[54:27.780 --> 54:28.660]  So first of all,
[54:28.660 --> 54:31.220]  I'm going to back it all the way up to the ice age.
[54:31.220 --> 54:32.140]  After the ice age,
[54:32.140 --> 54:35.860]  we did not have any kind of earthworms
[54:35.860 --> 54:38.660]  in the United States of America and North America.
[54:38.660 --> 54:40.500]  They were decimated.
[54:40.500 --> 54:44.500]  They were reintroduced as settlers came in,
[54:44.500 --> 54:47.340]  as indigenous people came in.
[54:47.340 --> 54:49.500]  You know, the cocoons came in with their food
[54:49.500 --> 54:50.820]  and their stores.
[54:50.820 --> 54:54.820]  And eventually night crawlers and, you know,
[54:54.820 --> 54:55.980]  these other types,
[54:55.980 --> 54:58.180]  there's probably three or four different types
[54:58.180 --> 55:01.940]  that I can say are indigenous, but they aren't.
[55:01.940 --> 55:04.980]  They were introduced at some point in time.
[55:04.980 --> 55:09.940]  Now these Georgia jumpers came from, I believe, Asia.
[55:09.940 --> 55:14.140]  They came in as a great worm for fishing
[55:14.140 --> 55:18.020]  because they're also nicknamed the crazy snake worm.
[55:18.020 --> 55:21.900]  Because if you've seen them, they fricking move like crazy.
[55:21.900 --> 55:24.260]  Their action is completely different
[55:24.260 --> 55:27.100]  than what I want to call the more traditional
[55:27.100 --> 55:30.660]  or indigenous species of worms here.
[55:30.660 --> 55:32.620]  At least the ones that I grew up with.
[55:32.620 --> 55:35.580]  Now there was a gentleman that wrote a paper,
[55:35.580 --> 55:40.580]  I believe he was out of Vermont back around 2010,
[55:40.780 --> 55:44.500]  maybe eight, about this invasive worm
[55:44.500 --> 55:47.420]  that was tearing up the, what I want to call,
[55:47.420 --> 55:50.540]  duff layer of the forest.
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.820]  And I read about it because I'm a science geek
[55:52.820 --> 55:55.260]  and I'm always into understanding
[55:55.260 --> 55:58.140]  different types of invasions.
[55:58.140 --> 56:01.020]  I don't like to call them invasions
[56:01.020 --> 56:04.140]  because this is what happens on the planet naturally.
[56:04.140 --> 56:06.100]  Species come in and they move out,
[56:06.100 --> 56:07.780]  whether it's climate related or not,
[56:07.780 --> 56:11.300]  or whether it's just overproduction, overabundance,
[56:11.300 --> 56:13.100]  and then lack thereof.
[56:13.100 --> 56:17.100]  But I have witnessed firsthand the decimation
[56:17.100 --> 56:20.580]  of these Georgia jumpers in a forest system
[56:20.580 --> 56:23.300]  behind the house I was living in Connecticut.
[56:23.300 --> 56:26.660]  It basically turned the soil into Rice Krispies.
[56:26.660 --> 56:29.900]  So there was no fungus, there was no sap robes,
[56:29.900 --> 56:31.620]  there was no duff layer,
[56:31.620 --> 56:35.660]  and it was just like dried up Rice Krispies.
[56:35.660 --> 56:40.260]  So please be careful about letting those out into nature.
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.860]  And please read up more about this,
[56:42.860 --> 56:46.100]  people in the audience, about being careful about,
[56:46.100 --> 56:49.940]  or being responsible about introducing new species
[56:49.940 --> 56:52.020]  too quickly to too many areas.
[56:52.020 --> 56:52.900]  Absolutely.
[56:52.900 --> 56:56.220]  Yeah, so I've been working with a couple of gardeners
[56:56.220 --> 56:57.140]  back in Connecticut
[56:57.140 --> 56:59.460]  who lost their whole vegetable gardens to this.
[56:59.460 --> 57:02.420]  And they're trying to figure out how to,
[57:03.540 --> 57:07.820]  again, being careful, cut back the population,
[57:07.860 --> 57:11.460]  not kill, but just keep it at bay.
[57:11.460 --> 57:14.780]  So those can work with electrocution, believe it or not,
[57:15.740 --> 57:17.300]  and to drive them up to the surface
[57:17.300 --> 57:20.540]  and then collecting them and then composting them
[57:20.540 --> 57:23.540]  so that you're not wasting the biomass.
[57:23.540 --> 57:24.580]  Yeah, for sure.
[57:24.580 --> 57:25.900]  Heads up on that one.
[57:25.900 --> 57:28.140]  Those can be really problematic.
[57:29.700 --> 57:30.540]  Thank you.
[57:30.540 --> 57:32.580]  I think we're gonna stick with the red wigglers.
[57:33.420 --> 57:35.460]  Well, I will say,
[57:35.460 --> 57:38.580]  a lot of the worm farming here in Colorado,
[57:38.580 --> 57:41.380]  I've kind of peeled the veil with some of those companies
[57:41.380 --> 57:43.420]  and a lot of them are using the African nightcrawler.
[57:43.420 --> 57:46.140]  They feel it's like a better hybrid
[57:46.140 --> 57:49.980]  for kind of more building those dissolved oxygen channels
[57:49.980 --> 57:53.300]  and kind of maybe just a better overall worm.
[57:53.300 --> 57:54.780]  Cause I do feel like the red wigglers
[57:54.780 --> 57:57.020]  take a little bit to break things down,
[57:57.020 --> 58:00.140]  but once their numbers, populations get there, no problem.
[58:00.140 --> 58:02.500]  The African seems like there's,
[58:03.420 --> 58:06.820]  it is really that nice hybrid within the European nightcrawler
[58:06.820 --> 58:08.100]  seems to be the fatter worm.
[58:08.100 --> 58:11.620]  So you do get those nicer dissolved oxygen channels,
[58:11.620 --> 58:12.740]  but at the same time,
[58:14.340 --> 58:16.860]  it just takes a lot longer for those to build up.
[58:16.860 --> 58:20.020]  So that's why I've always tried to experiment with
[58:20.020 --> 58:20.860]  all four of them.
[58:20.860 --> 58:23.220]  I just wasn't ever really sure if
[58:23.220 --> 58:25.820]  there's maybe a placebo effect of it.
[58:25.820 --> 58:28.420]  I learned from Gangesana, like you had mentioned,
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.460]  sometimes if the worms don't have enough organic matter,
[58:31.460 --> 58:34.100]  that they will kind of go after each other.
[58:34.100 --> 58:36.660]  But I felt like as long as my bins have been,
[58:36.660 --> 58:38.940]  especially worm farming, a hundred gallons or more,
[58:38.940 --> 58:42.460]  you know, the fabric pot, not bin, but fabric pots.
[58:42.460 --> 58:44.740]  So there is enough oxygen as well as using
[58:44.740 --> 58:47.500]  the composting worms for dissolved oxygen channels,
[58:47.500 --> 58:49.620]  where you don't get that compaction
[58:49.620 --> 58:50.500]  like you would normally see,
[58:50.500 --> 58:51.900]  especially when you first are starting
[58:51.900 --> 58:53.660]  to understand composting.
[58:53.660 --> 58:55.860]  That's why I've always been a big proponent,
[58:55.860 --> 58:57.820]  especially if you're trying to learn how to do this
[58:57.820 --> 58:59.580]  and maybe you're even in an apartment
[58:59.580 --> 59:00.540]  or something like that.
[59:00.540 --> 59:02.820]  It's so much easier to do vermicomposting
[59:02.820 --> 59:05.740]  because the worms don't really mess that up.
[59:05.740 --> 59:06.620]  For sure.
[59:06.620 --> 59:08.660]  They make it really easy.
[59:08.660 --> 59:10.300]  One of the big things that I realized though,
[59:10.300 --> 59:14.140]  is like a lot of people want to compost
[59:14.140 --> 59:16.700]  all their food scraps and they want to put it all through,
[59:16.700 --> 59:18.380]  you know, this little worm bin.
[59:18.380 --> 59:22.460]  And maybe it's not the most practical situation
[59:22.460 --> 59:25.900]  to compost all your food scraps, especially for a family.
[59:25.900 --> 59:28.100]  Like you really don't want to overdo
[59:28.100 --> 59:29.820]  a small indoor worm bin.
[59:29.860 --> 59:32.820]  You want to kind of leave space for them to do their thing.
[59:32.820 --> 59:34.740]  And then maybe, you know, half of it
[59:34.740 --> 59:37.820]  or a little bit over half, you put your food scraps in.
[59:37.820 --> 59:39.620]  And sometimes, you know, it's full
[59:39.620 --> 59:41.940]  and you have more food scraps and it's like,
[59:41.940 --> 59:44.100]  I don't really have anywhere to put this.
[59:44.100 --> 59:46.060]  And so like, that's where I started, you know,
[59:46.060 --> 59:49.580]  just an outdoor compost pile in my backyard
[59:49.580 --> 59:51.220]  because I could, but you know,
[59:51.220 --> 59:53.780]  like some people don't have access to that.
[59:53.780 --> 59:57.380]  I think, you know, composting in a worm bin indoors
[59:57.380 --> 59:59.860]  is going to give you great compost
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.700]  that you can use on your garden or whatever.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.060]  And it's going to reduce a lot of your waste
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.220]  or some of your waste, you know,
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.180]  but it might not be, you know,
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.020]  big enough of a solution to compost everything
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:11.900]  that you want to.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.100]  It does seem like the biofilm that is left
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.700]  for worm castings just improves everything
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.700]  for whether I'm growing plants,
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.260]  you're growing, you know, cannabis plants
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.460]  to whether it's a tomato plant,
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.020]  or you're just trying to build other things
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.100]  with worm farming, getting things to reproduce.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.020]  And then I'm personally taking those
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.020]  and then building like isopod farms and that kind of stuff.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.020]  It seems like using the worm castings
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.100]  allows me to have a one up on my competition,
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.140]  just being able to have that soil life already there,
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.340]  where if you, no diss to the reptile world,
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.980]  but they call things live and active and stuff like that.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.380]  And it's very obviously far from that.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.140]  So I feel like the more that we understand organic matter
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.140]  and the more that we understand
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.780]  things need to be broken down.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.940]  I know that you were talking about
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.140]  that you like to add a lot more carbon sources.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.100]  And that's as I started to learn this from Dr. Laningham,
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.420]  it seemed like carbon was basically the currency
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.740]  of the soil food web.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.220]  And so the more carbon that we have,
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.700]  the more money we got, you know, bling bling time,
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.620]  everybody's doing well for themselves.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.260]  And we see a lot of exchanges going on.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:22.260]  Do you feel like that is kind of a decent analogy
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.540]  for what's going on for people that might not even understand
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.860]  what soil food web is yet?
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.940]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.140]  I think like a lot of these long-term carbon sources,
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.660]  like our big chips of wood chips,
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.540]  that some of them last the whole entire process
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.180]  and they're never fully broken down
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.700]  and they get sifted out and added to the new one.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.140]  And eventually they'll break down a little bit more,
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:48.620]  but I think they become like batteries, you know,
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:53.140]  they eventually are entirely coated in this worm castings
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.540]  and like that itself,
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.420]  like the worm castings hold a high EC, you know,
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.260]  they got the conductivity and they can actually like
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.940]  other nutrients can bind to the castings.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.080]  And so now you have these wood chips
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.220]  that are totally soaked in water and these worm castings
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.380]  and they hold a charge.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.220]  And like, they're seriously just like these batteries
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.140]  that, you know, are doing their thing in there.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.300]  And carbon is, I mean, it's all essential.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.300]  You need the carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.700]  You don't wanna overdo it either or,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.340]  but I think a diversity of carbon sources
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:34.300]  and sizes of those carbon sources are vital.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.420]  You know, some small ones
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.000]  are going to be digested a lot faster.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.540]  They're going to speed things up,
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.500]  but they're not going to be a long-term carbon source.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.820]  And so like, I think it's beneficial
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.540]  to have some bigger chunks in there as well.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.180]  I don't know if that answered
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.260]  or if Leighton, you wanna add anything?
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.220]  Yeah, no, I'll definitely chime in on that one.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.220]  I think that carbon is kind of a lot more complicated
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.540]  than we're attributing it to it.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.220]  Well, we all know CO2, right?
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.820]  Well, that's a source of carbon.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.060]  We now finally understand that plant exudates
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.160]  or secondary tertiary metabolites
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.300]  are actually carbon sources.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.860]  So carbon is all over the map, but yes, Brian,
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:22.700]  that is the currency that drives the soil life.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.260]  And so understanding that there are many different types
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.580]  of carbon is just as critical
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.380]  as understanding the greens to browns
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.460]  or carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.340]  And, you know, there's a lot of materials
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.380]  like the spent mushroom blocks, right?
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.180]  They're a net neutral.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.860]  Distillers waste, net neutral.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.380]  Yeah, it'll heat it up if they use too much of it
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.540]  or it'll shut it down if you use too much of it.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.560]  So it's complicated.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.800]  And it's not something that we can just, you know,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.880]  mildly throw around that term
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.920]  because it's kind of like compost.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.840]  And then you got people calling their food scraps compost
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.920]  just to further, you know, that's not compost,
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.720]  that's food scraps that you're going to compost.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.960]  It's gonna eventually turn into nitrogen
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.320]  because right now it's in a,
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.240]  or eventually turn into a carbon source
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.900]  or gas off as an ammonia or an other nitrogen source
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.940]  or get chewed up by biology in a different process.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.900]  So, and backing it up,
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.060]  I really loved what you suggested about, you know,
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.500]  understanding food scraps.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.740]  Like, yeah, you can overdo it on the worms
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.460]  and turn the whole thing into an anaerobic soup.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.300]  Absolutely.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.660]  You really, again, it's low and slow as you feed
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.260]  and learn how to balance that ratio
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:40.020]  of bedding to food sources in your worm bins.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:40.900]  And, you know, again,
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.940]  I love the idea of throwing it outside, you know,
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.460]  build a cage and put all your food scraps in one place.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.420]  You probably bring in pests,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.820]  you probably get, you know,
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.020]  the food pile will get disturbed,
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.340]  which isn't the end of the world, right?
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.740]  All of these guys need, you know, need to be performing,
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.060]  you know, in a larger macro scale of the soil food web.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.820]  So you're not doing anything negative.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.980]  Now, if you're in a city
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.380]  and you're bringing in a bunch of rats,
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.300]  well, that's gonna piss your neighbors off.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.620]  So probably not a good idea.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.780]  Gotta be mindful.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.500]  Yeah, yeah, you gotta be mindful, right?
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.780]  But if you, you know, are responsible
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.420]  in handling your food waste,
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.700]  you can break them apart and use them for different things.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.460]  A lot of these can be put in cages for birds.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.220]  You know, some of it can be put in the ground,
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.820]  you can dig a little hole, bury it
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.140]  so that it doesn't get found by rats
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.540]  and others and raccoons.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.260]  So there are ways to deal with it.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.940]  It's just being responsible in dealing with that food waste.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.460]  And, you know, that's the craziest thing about SoCal.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.580]  When I first crash landed here,
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.220]  I saw these green bins.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.340]  I'm like, what are these green bins for?
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.740]  People are like, oh, we put all of our,
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.940]  you know, yard waste in there.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.580]  I'm like, what?
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.220]  Why aren't you grinding it up?
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.660]  Why aren't you bag mowing?
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.020]  Bag mowing, what the fuck?
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.260]  Why would you mow your grass and put it in a bag?
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.340]  You know, use a mulch mower, put it right back on the soil.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.900]  And when you prune your trees,
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.100]  why aren't you chipping that up
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.060]  and throwing it around the base of the tree?
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.260]  That's what the fucking tree needs.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.820]  Instead, you're spraying blue-green fertilizers everywhere.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.220]  What the fuck's wrong with you people?
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.660]  And now I'm dealing with gum.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.500]  Millions of yards of this shit.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.540]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.580]  So, you know, the practices,
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.580]  humans' practices are what needs to change.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.140]  And the things that you're doing
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.260]  and the things that I'm doing and Brian's doing,
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.260]  bringing awareness to this is really the important thing.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.380]  You know, so that people can start thinking about it.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.860]  Yeah, Sarah, I love the chickens, man.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.940]  We should all have chickens, just no roosters,
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.220]  because you piss your neighbors off.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.620]  But there's a reason why you can't put a couple chickens
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.140]  in a cage in your backyard.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.220]  You know, and then-
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.540]  Chickens are great composting tools.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.380]  They'll shred everything up, they'll add their manure.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.980]  Things are just better.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.340]  Right.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.540]  And then you can take their bedding,
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.740]  and that's another wonderful source of natural fertilizers.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:07.580]  Definitely.
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.900]  You know, again, closing the loops
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.660]  and biomimicking natural processes
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.700]  are the only way we're gonna get out of this.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.860]  100%, man.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.220]  Uh-oh, we lost Brian.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.060]  Uh-oh.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.220]  Anyway, we'll keep going.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.220]  Yeah, let's keep it going.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.460]  When we have some of these educational classes,
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.180]  one that's standing out to me right now is,
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.900]  we were teaching a bunch of kids,
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.540]  but there was their chaperones there,
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.380]  some of their parents,
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.220]  and you could really tell that it hit them the hardest.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.740]  But I was like, yeah,
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.380]  people send away their leaves every year.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.100]  You know, they act like it's a mistake
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.860]  that the trees are dropping their leaves.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.300]  It's like, no, these trees are trying to feed themselves
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.300]  and build soil.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.620]  And like, you could just see like light bulbs,
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.980]  you know, across the room,
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.500]  and the kids and the parents,
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.420]  and they're like, oh my gosh.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.740]  Like, they just never consider that
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.340]  because it's not the societal norm.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.140]  You know, like we're so used to a clean garden
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.660]  or a clean yard that has no organic matter on it.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.140]  That's so far away from the net system
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:08.980]  and what needs to happen.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.700]  It's like, we're depleting topsoil crazy fast,
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.180]  and everybody's a part of it
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.780]  unless they're leaving it there and mulching it there,
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.820]  or composting it there,
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.020]  and then top dressing that compost, you know?
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.700]  It's like, just another example of the education.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.860]  People need to know that.
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.220]  I think, unfortunately, we've been programmed
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.700]  that everything has to be neat,
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.980]  and we have to make nature tidy.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:37.380]  And in reality, nature is very chaotic and messy,
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.860]  but that's how she survives.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.860]  That's how we've had this planet go from a molten rock
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:49.260]  to the most incredible, diverse Garden of Eden
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.740]  that we can't even possibly comprehend
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.580]  how beautiful it was 500, 1,000 years ago.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.100]  You know, how just amazingly diverse
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.740]  this planet actually was.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.020]  And you're spot on, man.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.260]  I mean, like, leaves.
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.820]  The word means leave.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.060]  Leave it.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.780]  Right?
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.300]  And the other side of that that people don't understand
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.620]  is the endophytic fungi and bacteria
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.580]  that live in those leaves
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.860]  go through another phase like insects
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:26.380]  where they become saprobes, or composters, or decomposers,
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.740]  and they start to break that down and release that food
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.740]  that the plant put all of that ADP energy
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.580]  into pulling nutrients out of the soil,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.140]  growing, and then dropping back down to feed itself.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.540]  And we're taking it away.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.660]  For real, man.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.380]  The insanity of humanity.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.780]  Chandler, are you adding beneficials?
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.100]  Are there certain things, like,
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.380]  have you kind of messed around with?
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.620]  Rove beetles or anything that?
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.500]  So they're there naturally in like big numbers.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]  Like, again, it's like almost a-
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.540]  How many touch the ground is kind of your secret as well
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.740]  as you're building it,
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.140]  but then also mother nature is kind of really taking hold.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.980]  Build it and they will come.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.100]  It's the greatest example.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.340]  And like, there's actually two different types
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.740]  of Rove beetles in there.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.900]  And one of them is like probably five times
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.740]  the size of the other.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.180]  It's like a big one.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.020]  And then there's like the small ones
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.780]  that I was used to for the longest time, you know?
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:25.940]  But I see so much diversity in there
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.780]  and I'm constantly hitting up Matt,
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.740]  since, since Angel.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.580]  Yeah.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.540]  Shout out to Matthew.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.500]  Cause like he helps me identify stuff all the time
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.740]  and I'm constantly trying to ID stuff.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.980]  But there's like pseudoscorpions.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.900]  I don't know if you've ever seen those.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.980]  But those things are, are bad-ass
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.220]  and all sorts of beneficial mites.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.620]  And there's a war going on in every handful.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.020]  And like-
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.620]  What are you naturally seeing occur there?
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.340]  You know, Rove beetles, are you like,
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.020]  does like the assassin bug naturally show up there
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:01.860]  or some of the other ones?
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.700]  I haven't seen too many.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.060]  No, I haven't seen too many assassin bugs.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.660]  Mainly a lot of Rove beetles, springtails, pill bugs,
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.460]  the pseudoscorpions, a slew of beneficial mites,
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.900]  shredders and predators.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.700]  I'm sure I'm leaving some, some people out,
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.020]  but yeah, there's a, there's so much more to it.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.820]  And then like, so it's not just worm castings,
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.140]  it's also pill bug frass, you know,
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.820]  and like all this other stuff.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.260]  It's like, it's a beautiful product.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.100]  It really is.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.500]  It sounds biocomplete.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.020]  I actually reached out to Elaine about that
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.660]  and whether she trademarked that.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:49.460]  And her crew unfortunately did trademark it.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.300]  Okay.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.780]  But I've begged her to let me into the back door
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.740]  so that I'm not required to go through all of the classes
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.780]  to be able to use the term.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.220]  Because I said, look, it's important that we classify.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.060]  It's important that we start to put names
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.980]  to things that we can trust.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.780]  You know, people need to understand
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.540]  that biocomplete compost is just that,
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.820]  like what your material is.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.380]  It's got all of these other things in it,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.220]  far beyond just protozoa, nematodes and bacteria.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.180]  It's got the frasses, it's got the predatory mites,
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.980]  it's got, you know, the whole, the basis,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.460]  the foundation of the soil food web.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.260]  And, you know, so I'll keep working on her
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.340]  behind the scenes to hopefully get a way to
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.940]  skirt the educational part,
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.460]  but still be able to use the term responsibly.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.500]  Because we need a name.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.340]  We need a name.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:51.180]  Absolutely.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.460]  It sums it up perfectly, biocomplete.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.860]  That's what we're looking for.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.540]  And you know, it's funny,
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.100]  we chopped that up fucking years ago
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.940]  about like, well, compost is a catchall.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.580]  And, you know, people look at compost
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.780]  as stinky, nasty smelling stuff,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:09.740]  when in reality, if it's made right,
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.660]  you smell it, it smells like this forest soil.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.500]  Right?
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.340]  It's gold.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.300]  How do you break that stigma?
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.020]  And so finally, you know, 10 years later,
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.220]  her and her crew have come up with a term
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.740]  that I can get behind.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.460]  I believe that is, like you said,
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:29.340]  a word that is descriptive of what it is
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.860]  that this material actually is.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.700]  For sure.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.500]  And so biocomplete was newer to me.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.340]  I haven't heard that until maybe sometime this year.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.180]  Yeah.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.180]  We've been using the term biointelligent.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.420]  You know, we have biologically intelligent soil
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.540]  and people are like, what?
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.740]  Soil's intelligent?
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.700]  And like, we'd go to like the farmer's market
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.500]  and like, I don't know,
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500]  most people aren't there to buy compost,
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.140]  but I start conversations all the time
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.660]  and just like, you know,
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.500]  I feel like I changed people's outlook a lot.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.060]  They never considered this type of stuff.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.060]  I'm like, yeah, soil's intelligent.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.260]  Like, it doesn't need to have a brain.
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.180]  Like our human conception of intelligence,
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.260]  you know, like we just think of animals
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.180]  that look like humans, you know,
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.180]  and like the next smartest thing is like chimpanzees
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.020]  and apes and stuff.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.940]  And then like we go off of brain size and stuff.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:24.940]  It's like intelligence doesn't need to have a brain
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.500]  than mycelium or like fungi and amoeba,
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.900]  slime molds are the perfect example of that.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.260]  You're still muted, Leighton.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.780]  Yeah, you know, I first heard the term-
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.820]  Hey, real quick, let's address that.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.620]  What kind of bracelet are you wearing right there?
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:45.940]  This bracelet?
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.860]  Oh.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:51.860]  Hey, that's a Weed Doll beaded bracelet, handmade.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.100]  That's awesome, man.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.940]  Yeah, it's protection.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.220]  It's to help-
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.260]  It was for his birthday on Monday.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.820]  Oh, sweet, happy birthday.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.780]  Happy birthday, bro.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.660]  Yeah, she's all about trying to protect me
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.980]  because I am in a lot of public spaces
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.540]  and I am an empath,
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.900]  so therefore I take on the energy around me.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.540]  But anyway, so that's what that's all about.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.820]  I had one for five years.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.820]  It snapped just prior to COVID
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:23.180]  and that just changed all of our directions
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.660]  and therefore I hadn't been able to circle back.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.380]  But now that I'm back out in the world doing the work,
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.140]  she felt it was important to get me some more protection.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.540]  So that's what that bracelet's all about.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.380]  Awesome.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.220]  Beautiful, man.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.740]  So the first time I ever heard biointelligence
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.620]  was actually used by Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.300]  Shout out to Josh and Kelly.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.220]  Absolutely.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.940]  And it was used both in the terms of the soil
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:50.740]  as well as biointelligence seeds,
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.660]  which is really important to understand
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.980]  that if your seeds are grown
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.940]  in a biologically intelligent soil,
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.900]  if you introduce them to synthetics fertilizers,
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.140]  they're not gonna do well.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:03.980]  Nope.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.820]  And vice versa.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.420]  If you take a synthetically grown cultivar
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.460]  that has been bred out or how do I say that?
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.020]  Yeah, bred in a synthetic system
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.140]  and you throw it in a really good biocomplete
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.340]  or biointelligent soil system,
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.900]  you're again, you're not going to get the potential
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.540]  of that plant to express.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:28.860]  You're gonna have to let it build up its own intelligence
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.620]  or ability to communicate with the intelligent environment
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.740]  in which you've tossed it into.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:39.420]  So, that's again, great ways of using words
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:43.540]  to educate people as to what you're really talking about.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.100]  Soil is not just soil, it's intelligent.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.020]  It has life to it.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.180]  I mean, God, I remember people,
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.380]  I told them, oh, your soil's alive.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.260]  Like, well, it's just dirt, man.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.420]  It's just dirt.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.740]  It's like, no, healthy system,
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.540]  there's so much going on.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.820]  It's not fun.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.260]  Fungi are like the best example of biochemical engineers
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.300]  and bacteria are a close second.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.740]  And like, they're constantly problem solving
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.460]  and evaluating their surroundings and adjusting.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.580]  And I'm really glad you talked
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.500]  about this biointelligent seeds
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.740]  because when you talked about like a C-section
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.700]  versus a vaginal birth, like that's the same thing.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.180]  It's like, it's that initial inoculation
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.300]  that is going to set things in the right path
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.620]  right from the get-go, you know?
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.460]  So like a baby is inoculated going
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.660]  through the vagina or whatever.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.620]  So like, and seeds, they're encoded
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.620]  with these endophytes that are literally, you know,
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:48.140]  it's living bacteria and fungi on the surface
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.060]  of the seed and inside the seed, you know?
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.540]  And so like, it's plants that are bred
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.900]  in these biologically intelligent systems.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.580]  They have that initial inoculation.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580]  You don't need to inoculate it.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.620]  You still should, but like, it's already got something
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.380]  that is going to help benefit it.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.660]  And so like, one of my greatest realizations, you know,
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.700]  is like everybody breeds some accidental seeds, you know,
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.940]  from time to time, something harms over
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.980]  and like taking those seeds
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.260]  because they're the healthiest seeds I've ever seen.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.060]  You know, like I bred them on accident,
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.060]  but like they look better than any pack I've ever bought.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.740]  Like beautiful, rich tiger stripes and everything.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.780]  And it's like, that looks like a seed that I should pop,
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.340]  you know, and like you pop that seed that was bred
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.180]  in that soil back into that same soil
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:37.300]  and like things just take off like no other.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.020]  And like, that's how you get these plants
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.180]  to tap into their epigenetic state
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:47.140]  and like express themselves based off of their environment
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.660]  instead of being entirely limited by, you know,
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.700]  their surroundings and like.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.180]  Oh, that was so well put my friend.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.700]  And you're spot on because that plant lived
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.820]  in that environment and in that soil.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.420]  And when it bred out, it bred a replicate
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.860]  of exactly what would be best in that environment.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.660]  You know, and another little interesting thing
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.460]  that I've learned over the years is if you take your seed
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:22.100]  and you suck on it before you plant it,
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:26.500]  now you're imprinting your bio intelligence on that seed.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.340]  Yes.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.500]  It is now going to know what you need it to
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.380]  or how it should express itself to give you what you need.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.380]  Exactly, I love that.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.500]  Yeah.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.100]  And that's the type of stuff that I think some people
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.300]  are like, oh, that's bro science.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.340]  But like, I think like the spiritual aspect
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.260]  or like this, you know, this imagination, you know,
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.340]  it's such a vital part of all of this.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.340]  And like intention is everything.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.020]  It's like, if you can put the intention into your seeds
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.420]  by like, you know, doing that type of stuff,
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.060]  it's like that shit is incredible.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.220]  And-
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.900]  Here we go, Brian, down the woo woo hole.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.740]  Yeah.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.300]  Like I said, man, I'm fine with it.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.700]  There's so much ancient knowledge, wisdom,
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.020]  whatever you want to call it,
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.660]  that speaks on a variety of things that we just, you know,
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.300]  I feel like Leighton and I dip our toe
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.220]  in some of these topics and then everybody comes out,
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:25.020]  it's like, this is fucking bullshit.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.100]  I'm like, immediately without even checking it out.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:28.940]  Yeah.
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:29.780]  And I get that.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.900]  I get that some people are just one way of thinking,
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.020]  some people are the other.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:33.860]  Exactly.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.020]  I just try to go where the information is
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.980]  and try to also remember where your sources are coming from.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:43.580]  But just cultivating plants in general,
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:44.780]  like we are getting that.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:45.900]  And you had mentioned the brain.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.060]  I feel like when you are cultivating cannabis
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:52.260]  using the Soil Food Web, focused on composting worms,
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.820]  that does almost become like that second stomach,
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:55.660]  if you will.
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.940]  And science and data for that,
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.460]  and for those of you out there,
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.100]  they really are starting to say that like,
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.700]  there is almost like a second brain in your gut
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.780]  and how important gut health is to overall sleep
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.340]  and the melatonin and stuff that's built throughout the day.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.420]  I personally had the aha moment
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:15.220]  when I was trying to build up the living soil systems,
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.180]  being successful, but not at the same level
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.820]  with praying leaves and all the kind of like
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.340]  Instagram type photos that you wanna show off.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:25.260]  Until I started to mess around with basically kefir,
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:29.260]  or the beginning of what you later find out is lab.
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.940]  But I didn't understand any of that.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.980]  And I just was drizzling kefir around my plants.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:36.180]  And I just saw the overall health just take off.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.620]  The overall color of the composting worms
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.860]  went from like a pinkish color to this dark, rich purple.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:44.740]  And that's when I really started to see my plants take off.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.220]  And that's why I'm so huge.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.300]  I know you are as well Chandler and Layton is
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.380]  just understanding that soil food web is a basic way.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.300]  And I almost don't feel like,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.700]  if you're newer to cannabis farming,
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.900]  I'm sure a lot of it feels like you're way behind
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.620]  on the knowledge scale.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.680]  But understanding mother nature,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.860]  I feel like is gonna allow you to speed up that process.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.340]  And if you continue to stay hungry
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.500]  and watch these kinds of shows and watch other shows
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.540]  and really see a diverse,
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:16.380]  we talk about diverse microbes and that kind of stuff.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.220]  Layton and I are also huge on diverse education.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.500]  Like take stuff from a variety of people.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.700]  I think you can learn from people
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:25.100]  that you might not necessarily even agree with.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.740]  But some of the points that maybe,
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.980]  I've never really thought of it that way before.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.140]  I feel like is healthy discussion.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.180]  And that's something that I feel like is great
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.000]  about the living soil crowd, in my opinion,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.020]  is because it's really none of us are doing this shit.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.300]  We're just trying to figure out and manage mother nature
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.420]  and the guys and the girls that understand this
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:46.140]  on a top tier level,
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.900]  I feel like just really understand
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.160]  the way mother nature flows.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.080]  And maybe they know a certain few ways and tips and tricks
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.540]  throughout the years on ways to build out
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.020]  those soil systems.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.720]  But the guys that I shout out all the time,
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.980]  I feel like if you ever have the chance to see their farms
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.380]  or check out their Instagram pages,
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.480]  there's a reason why those guys are top tier
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.700]  and girls are top tiers, because they understand this.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.980]  And once you understand that,
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.220]  now you can kind of almost play with mother nature
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.820]  and mess around with different tea formulas and stuff.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.940]  I know we got really big into the sprouted seed teas
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.660]  and then we would dump that on top of the kefir.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.900]  And then at night the worms would obviously come up
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:24.820]  and just take that.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.520]  I'm excited that this has now kind of created a job
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.100]  for yourself as a passion.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.820]  And now it seems like you've been rocking this
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.060]  from what I understand a couple of years,
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.540]  working for wormies.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:40.780]  Yeah, super fortunate to find the paths that I did for sure.
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.780]  I wanted to touch on that
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.100]  and how important this education aspect is
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.860]  and how important it is to read the books
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.340]  and to watch these channels and everything.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.500]  But also you gotta get out there and just do it.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.060]  You gotta experiment for yourself.
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.700]  You gotta try growing your own plants,
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.900]  but also just go out to the woods
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.540]  and find a spot of plants that are thriving there
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.100]  without man touching it, without anything.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.140]  And just sit there for a while and be quiet
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.140]  and really put on this lens of why are you thriving here?
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.540]  Like how have you evolved for like millions of years
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:20.540]  to like just do your thing out here without man.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.340]  And like you can study every aspect of the plant.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.140]  And like Josh and Kelly taught me this,
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.580]  but like we separate the plant from the soil,
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:30.180]  from the air, from the water.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.740]  And like it's all so intertwined and so interconnected.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.220]  And you talked about this earlier,
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.420]  like bacteria inside a fungi.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.740]  It's like there could be a virus inside of that bacteria
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.460]  and a virus inside of that other virus.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.540]  And like things are constantly going smaller down.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.780]  And like, we don't really know what's going on.
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.780]  Things are crazy intertwined.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.620]  But I think-
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.540]  No, I'm glad you brought up virus.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.820]  So part of the study group,
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.780]  we really went down the viral hole.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:02.580]  And it's very clear in present day science
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.980]  that every bacteria has viruses in it.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.140]  And those viruses are literally
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.540]  what steered all evolution.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.020]  Nothing would be here without them.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:17.620]  And we hate them and we look down on them or we fight them.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.180]  But in reality, they're just doing their job.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:24.100]  And regardless of how long we've been here
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:29.100]  and how long we get to live here to be determined,
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.620]  but they will always be steering evolution on all levels
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.380]  from the single cell organism
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.060]  all the way to the mega elephant whale.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.420]  So I'm glad you said that.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.340]  And another thing that I think the audience
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.300]  has really got to learn about
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.540]  is doing just that, forest bathing.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:51.140]  Walking into a quiet space in the woods,
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.780]  quieting your mind, which is the hardest thing to do.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.500]  And this takes practice.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:59.340]  You need to practice breathing techniques
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.780]  or you can walk.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.860]  There's all kinds of ways to meditate.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.220]  But the key to meditation is to quiet the brain.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.380]  Stop the brain from racing.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.620]  Oh, I gotta do this, I gotta do that.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.380]  I'm worried about this, worried about that.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:16.500]  Shut all of that out and then observe.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.980]  And through that observation,
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.540]  you can learn so much more almost
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.340]  than you can from reading a book.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.180]  Absolutely.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.340]  Again, thank you for touching that
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:30.060]  because that's not something that we talk about
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.020]  as a society or as a species
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.020]  about how important it is to quiet your mind.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.140]  For real.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.140]  Talk to you.
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.700]  Because Brian and I have talked about
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.100]  connecting with your plants
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.700]  and the importance of spirituality.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:49.180]  And yet, I think most people just don't get that connection.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.700]  Oh, this is a job, I'm here to do my work, earn a paycheck.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.580]  And in reality, no.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:58.580]  This existence that you are is an experience
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.500]  and you are a sum total of all of your experiences.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.460]  So are you a good experience or are you a bad experience?
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.660]  And what are you doing?
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.620]  How are you helping the situation?
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.620]  Are you a taker or are you a giver or are you an educator?
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.580]  What are you?
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.020]  And are you in balance?
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.740]  Are you yin and yang?
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.740]  Or are you just one or the other?
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:24.300]  And I think that meditation will help all of us
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:28.420]  understand our position and maybe enlighten us
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.100]  in a way that we will be more responsible
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.620]  with what we were gifted this life.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.780]  Exactly.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.660]  And, but you're never gonna get there.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.500]  You're never gonna get to that higher level of vibration
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.500]  or understanding unless you learn the very basics
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.660]  of understanding meditation and observation
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:50.140]  and quieting your monkey mind from all of the chatter
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.460]  from shit like this.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.660]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.540]  And I live in the, oh man.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.420]  A little bit of a connection issue there.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.700]  We all good?
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.020]  Did I drop out?
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.860]  No, I just lag sometimes.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.580]  Okay, we're all good now.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.460]  But yeah, humans are telepathic
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.420]  and we're constantly putting off energy.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.820]  And like somebody can walk into the room
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.420]  and you can feel that energy change
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:17.900]  without them saying anything.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.860]  It's like we're constantly putting off this energy.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.300]  We're sending out these frequencies.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.660]  And so like you get into a populated city
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.860]  and everybody's all, oh, I gotta do this.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.700]  I gotta do that.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.260]  They're drinking their iced coffee.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.540]  They're hitting their nicotine stick.
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.620]  They're on that flight or flight,
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.140]  that sympathetic nervous system.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.620]  And they're putting out some pretty wild vibes.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.580]  And so you end up sitting in traffic
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:44.900]  and I've experienced what I call thought pollution.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.900]  It's like, there's just so much going on,
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.260]  so much vibrations.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.220]  Like I gotta go out to the woods
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.740]  and I gotta get away from that thought pollution.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.340]  And you think differently.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.460]  Like when you can go out to this area
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:57.860]  that nobody's been to in a while,
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.500]  or you can go sit by yourself in the quiet of the woods.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.620]  I've had so many insights and inspirations
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:10.340]  like hit me when I meditate in an environment like that
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:11.900]  without any thought pollution.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.540]  But then, yeah, this spiritual side of everything
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:20.180]  and like the self-work and everything is so important.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:23.380]  And we focus a lot about this at the Compost Cup
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.980]  because like we can do everything we can
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:30.980]  to remediate our soils and prevent diversity loss.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.740]  The core of all of this problem is like greed.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:39.540]  And like, it's a human issue,
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.860]  that we can, like if we practice these mindfulness
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.500]  and practices and meditations,
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.180]  like that's how we actually change our soils
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.340]  by like changing ourselves
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.460]  and becoming more compassionate and everything.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.860]  So it's another, like mushrooms are so cool.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:00.300]  Mushrooms are like, they're the great connectors.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.100]  In the soil between death and life.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.380]  And like, they're responsible for that rebirth.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.380]  But like, they also connect us to the spiritual realm
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:11.860]  and like take some mushrooms, everybody.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:14.780]  Like, let's, yeah.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:17.180]  We've talked about that on the show and you're right.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.620]  You know, mindfulness, gratefulness
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.740]  is something that is lost in our society.
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.300]  You're obviously wise beyond your years.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:28.260]  You're clearly an empath and you get it.
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.780]  I mean, if I get around people
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.620]  and if they're negative, I gotta get out of there.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.740]  I can feel, I can totally feel all of their energy.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.780]  And that again, that's why this
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:40.940]  and some of the other things that I wear
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:43.980]  is to, you know, is because I am too empathic.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.300]  And I don't think that people are in touch
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.660]  with that side of themselves.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.740]  Like, you know, you ever noticed like
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.580]  when you're driving down the highway
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.220]  and there's some aggressive driver goes flying by
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:57.260]  and then all of a sudden five other ones join in
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:59.580]  and they're all popping around all over the place.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.100]  That is that energy.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.580]  That's that energy.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.220]  If you are negative, you will attract negative energy.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.980]  If you're extremely positive,
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:08.620]  you will attract positive energy
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:11.380]  and or opposites attract too.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:12.580]  So you have to be very careful
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:15.380]  because a lot of really positive, good people
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.100]  attract a lot of negative people.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.420]  So there's that balance of learning to protect yourself,
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.860]  understand those things,
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.380]  understand the energies when it come in.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.780]  I had a conversation with my daughter
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.100]  just last night about this.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.740]  And I'm like, honey, you know you're an empath.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.620]  You understand that,
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:35.140]  but you don't do any of the work necessary
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.460]  to handle that responsibility.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:39.260]  You're gonna blow yourself up if you're not careful
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.740]  because you just give, give, give.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.900]  And when you're around people that are all negative
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.580]  and she explained this situation
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.340]  where she was trying to handle three kids,
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.140]  you know, a husband and, you know, not her kids,
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.500]  but just someone else.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.660]  And she took on all the energy of those kids, you know,
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.220]  I'm hungry, I need this, I need that.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:59.620]  And it's, she went home and broke down into tears.
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:02.140]  No, you have to start practicing these things.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.220]  You have to, you're aware, but you're not learning.
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.300]  And that learning part is the most important.
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.300]  Exactly.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.780]  And that's what emotions are there for.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:13.460]  They're our tools and our teachers.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.420]  And like, if you're gonna be mindful enough
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.180]  to see that we're getting irritated
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.500]  or that some emotion is rising,
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.060]  it's like you can further look at that emotion
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.380]  and learn a whole lot about yourself, you know?
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.420]  And like learn these practices of what we can do
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.580]  to prevent the emotion from rising.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:30.420]  It's like-
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.220]  And causing other people to have that.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.060]  Yeah.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.380]  Right, because you can start a wave,
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.740]  you can start a tsunami just as quickly
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.900]  as you can get run over by one.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.060]  So, you know, I'm so glad you brought that up at mushrooms.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:46.860]  I mean, Brian's talked about like doing a mushroom show.
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.820]  Yeah, we're here for it.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.460]  We're gonna eat live on the air.
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.300]  Oh shit.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.180]  Yeah.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:55.220]  Just see what we talk about.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.060]  Yeah, man.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:56.900]  Be interesting.
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.140]  A good idea and a bad idea.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.020]  That'd be awesome.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.780]  But another one of the-
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:03.620]  Sorry.
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.460]  I always call it a mental marathon.
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.980]  Like you and Javi's hanging out.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.580]  Especially if you do like a heroic dose.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.580]  That'd be exhausting.
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:13.540]  It'd be hard to sit.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:14.700]  I think it'd be pretty hard to sit here
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:15.820]  for three hours on a heroic dose.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.460]  Yeah, for real.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:21.260]  Man, I took pretty damn close to a heroic dose
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.860]  at the Chicago Museum of Natural History.
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.180]  Oh, wow.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.260]  I absorbed everything that we know
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.740]  about mankind and the world
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:32.380]  and like the most beautiful displays
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.300]  of sound and vision and everything.
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:36.700]  It's like the most meaningful thing I think I've ever done
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.940]  was, you know, trip in there.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.980]  And shit was, that was awesome.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.220]  And like, you see mushrooms all around that place
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.380]  and there's a psilocybin exhibit and everything
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.260]  and everything just clicked.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.140]  That was like, this is exactly what I'm supposed
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:52.180]  to be doing, you know, like right here.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.140]  And like mushrooms are the best way
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.060]  to fully experience like anything.
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:59.900]  If you've ever seen a mushroom or a movie, you know,
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.380]  on the right dose of mushrooms,
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:03.700]  like you can notice every single detail.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:07.620]  And like, I think you can fully experience the picture
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.740]  that was trying to be conveyed or like, I don't know,
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.660]  who knows, but mushrooms are cool.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.180]  Yeah, you're spot on, dude.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.620]  It opens so many neural pathways
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.060]  all at the same time that you are now superhuman.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:22.260]  And you're absorbing on a level
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.820]  that you couldn't without help.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.420]  And so that's what makes them, you know,
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.740]  part of the indigenous culture.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:33.300]  And in that greater understanding
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.420]  of what was going on around them
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:40.420]  and in their religious practices and their ceremonies.
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.900]  And it heightened their awareness and their respect
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:46.220]  and their gratefulness for nature.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.100]  And they weren't afraid to die.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.740]  They weren't afraid to live.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:52.220]  And I know so many people that are afraid to live.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:54.540]  And I know so many people that are afraid to die.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:58.140]  And it's like, you're missing the whole fucking point.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:01.740]  You know, those are the people that need to have micro-dosed
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.340]  or supervised hero doses,
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:08.380]  but it would change their whole trajectory if they did it.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:12.940]  And, you know, unfortunately the control of greed
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:16.220]  and power has taken these tools away from us
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.020]  and suppressed it to the point where, you know,
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.940]  the Columbus Day, you know,
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:24.380]  and the acknowledgement of Indigenous Day,
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.900]  it's like Columbus was a freaking, a savage man.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:33.420]  They killed, destroyed, imprisoned, enslaved
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.700]  every culture that they came in contact with.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.820]  And we celebrate this guy?
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:41.220]  And he and the Catholic church and the shit they did?
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:42.740]  You know, it's scary.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.820]  And so we need to respect the indigenous
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.420]  and the culture and the information.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:55.420]  We need to somehow gain some of that back.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.940]  And I believe, you know, some of these plants,
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:02.700]  cannabis, mushrooms, and there's DMTs,
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.340]  those are what will bring awareness
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:08.580]  and hopefully balance back to humanity
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:12.100]  because fucking we're on a bullet train to hell right now.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:16.140]  And if we don't make some serious sacrifices and changes,
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.460]  then yeah, there's a one way street, man.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.420]  We're on a rails.
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.940]  There's no stopping it.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.060]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:27.020]  One thing about like the energies that we're talking about,
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.260]  it's like a huge part of my IPM strategy.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.500]  I think like IPM starts at the door, you know,
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.900]  like obviously you don't wanna be bringing in pests
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:35.060]  on your clothing or anything,
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.780]  but like you really don't wanna be bringing in bad vibes
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.300]  into your garden at all.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.220]  So like before I go in there, you know,
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.420]  I do a vibe check and like I got my meditation
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.300]  or like my singing bowl, you know,
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.820]  and like, or like you do anything,
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:51.020]  but like it's just another mindfulness practice
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.580]  of making sure that you're really not bringing in
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:56.260]  your stress and your bad intentions into your garden.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:59.900]  And like, if you ever water, like when you're in a hurry
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.460]  and like, you're just like, shit, I gotta go.
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:02.820]  And like, you're putting all that stress,
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.180]  like you're literally watering that stress
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.540]  into your plants and stuff.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:10.060]  It's like, I believe that like there's energy exchange
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.060]  on every level.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.420]  And like, we need to be putting out some good vibes
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.900]  when we're in our garden and being intuitive
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.400]  and paying attention to what they're saying to us.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.740]  Ryan, how many times have we talked about that?
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:28.180]  Yeah, we had a discussion kind of about this yesterday
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.140]  as well with Marco and Belief.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.180]  So shout out to those guys where the Belief was saying
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:36.740]  that he didn't even allow his crews to listen to like,
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:40.220]  basically like negative type music.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.540]  So he's dialed in, I don't wanna blast the genre,
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.900]  but you kinda know what.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.140]  Some people wanna listen to certain things, myself included.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.300]  I grew up in Atlanta and there's just certain things
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.140]  about certain music that I will always love
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:53.980]  till the day I die.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.340]  I don't know why, but that's just how it is,
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.460]  negative or not.
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.660]  But I understand that like, if you're listening to that shit
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.940]  day in, day out, and that's all you're doing,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.340]  and that's all your kind of your entire vibe
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.540]  is at your company.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.140]  I can understand why, in my opinion,
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.940]  Belief is crushing it with some of its,
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.740]  the genetics that he has and stuff is just next level.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.140]  I don't know if you've seen his work, Leighton,
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.140]  but the guy's just on another level with understanding
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:21.520]  and taking the time to understand his work.
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:26.220]  I feel like if he was able to continue to improve
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:29.180]  the process and maybe get onto the living soil,
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.060]  that would just be on a whole nother level.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.220]  Cause I feel like there's guys out there that,
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.580]  30 plus years that have been farming this way,
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:37.820]  understand things.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.700]  They themselves are even saying like,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.860]  the microbial world is what's bringing
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:46.060]  that full genetic profile, that full expression
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.700]  that all of us have been after.
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.580]  It's just, we didn't have the knowledge
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.900]  or it's hard to get off when you are on certain rails
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:55.420]  and you're just crushing it in your business.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.260]  In a way, why would you change things up?
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.020]  So I understand, especially for a lot of the old heads,
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.540]  even I'm talking to some of those guys
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.060]  that I know watch the show that have refused
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.500]  to come on the show,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.260]  cause they don't grow with the living soil.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.260]  Look, I get that part,
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.500]  but I still feel like if you've been farming
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.860]  for 30 years plus, as Chandler mentioned,
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.780]  doing anything with experience, there's a lot to learn.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:22.020]  And I feel like if you want to farm cannabis,
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.200]  worm farming has got to be at the top of the list
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.220]  of things that you need to understand.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:28.340]  If you want to grow these elite cannabis strains
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.660]  and find those full genetic profiles,
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.860]  they're really going to allow your work to stand out.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:36.980]  Otherwise, there really is that separation.
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:39.460]  And in my opinion, it is the soil food web
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:42.820]  or really high education on farming cannabis,
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.540]  where it goes from good to great.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.940]  And those little percentage points
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.980]  where it really gets to that excellent cannabis,
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.260]  you can see on the photos,
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.620]  like when you're scrolling through,
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.240]  there's great cannabis everywhere,
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.620]  but there's certain brands and certain growers
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.420]  that really stand out when you kind of like
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.260]  going through that and you stop and pause
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.780]  and you're like, damn, that is,
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.660]  I don't want to shout out too many people and stuff
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:05.500]  cause I don't want to,
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:06.900]  I feel like some people feel left out,
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.300]  but like green source gardens,
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.140]  you know, there's just certain people out there
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.700]  where I'm like, Jesus, man, this is,
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.540]  I can't imagine just the colors
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.060]  that some of these guys are getting
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.920]  and just the overall process
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.220]  and the way things are dialed in.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.220]  That's only what you can see, Brian.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.420]  Oh, exactly.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.420]  You try smoking some of his stuff,
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:30.100]  whoo, you talk about next level.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.700]  Nick and his wife are great people
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.160]  and they've been putting out a lot of content
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.820]  for a lot of years, just like Dragonfly.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.020]  Those are the bars that we should all strive for.
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:43.140]  And your comment about the fact
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.460]  that they're not going to hit that potential.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:48.380]  I mean, why wouldn't you want to hit the full potential?
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:51.860]  The best expression that genetic can provide.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.060]  Without living soils, you're never going to get there.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.940]  You're not going to even get close.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:56.780]  So thanks for that.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.420]  Well, you got to educate yourself to the botanist level
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.780]  because I do feel like there's certain people out there
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.100]  that have that, but it's very far,
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.660]  very few people I feel like are on that elite level
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:11.180]  where I've been confused in my own,
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.420]  where it's like, I wasn't sure if it was a living soil
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.860]  or something else.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.300]  Sometimes they can get those soils.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.380]  Just soil in general.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.820]  Yeah, what the hell is soil?
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.420]  There's no sand silt or clay in here.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:26.300]  This is a biologically driven modified growing medium.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.700]  This ain't living soil.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.300]  Hey, talk about marketing.
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.420]  Yeah, for real.
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.740]  Oh, dude, when I first heard they were talking,
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.740]  calling super soils, living soils,
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.860]  I'm like, you're not even close.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.260]  I don't think, especially at the beginning,
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:41.220]  I don't think nobody knew really what we were saying,
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.780]  because we'd be like, all right,
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.300]  what do you mean you're cooking your soil?
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.820]  Oh, I'm using the super soil,
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.060]  where it just kind of like sits
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:49.420]  in the big garbage can for a while.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.340]  And I don't know, I feel like a lot of people
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.580]  definitely dismissed that.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.020]  So shout out to all the pioneers
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:57.660]  that were cooking their soil, following ideas.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.980]  I mean, we were putting it in a little kiddie pool
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.820]  back in the day and like mixing it around
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:03.300]  and covering it up with tarp.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.620]  And again, having really no idea what we were doing,
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.820]  but then all of a sudden the, you know,
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.420]  life started to emerge and we're like, all right,
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:13.340]  I have no idea what the fuck we're doing,
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:15.220]  but this is starting to pay, you know,
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:17.940]  seems to be paying off from the forums.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.540]  And then that's when I feel like a lot of stuff
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.620]  really started to take off.
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:23.900]  Like after a few years of trying to mess around with this,
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.540]  some of the YouTube channels started to pop up,
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.180]  more and more people were willing to show
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.580]  what they were doing on Instagram.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:32.300]  And then I feel like everything with cannabis exploded
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:37.100]  from growing to, you know, especially here in Colorado.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.460]  I mean, there's people here with rigs
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.180]  that are like a hundred thousand dollars
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.700]  that they pass around at these parties
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.180]  and they only smoke the best of the best of the best.
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.660]  And I mean, it just completely went from,
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.500]  hey, I'm just trying to get good weed
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:51.140]  to just everything's so bougie.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:54.100]  And that part I don't really like,
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.260]  but I am a huge fan that more and more people
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:00.260]  are smoking cannabis for whether they're just trying
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.460]  to relax at the end of the day
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.580]  or actually for ailments and just life altering things
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:06.340]  that improve their life in general.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.300]  I would like, Layton, if we could,
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.860]  there's a couple of people I'd like to reach out to
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.420]  where we could talk maybe more about
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.700]  the endocannabinoid system as far as like a health thing.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.300]  And I know that you and your,
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:20.100]  I was about to say wife, I know,
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.380]  you and Pauline are, you know,
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.940]  understand that on a whole nother level.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.580]  So maybe we could talk to her, you know,
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.340]  offline and figure something out.
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.100]  But I don't think enough people understand,
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:33.620]  like you had mentioned the medical doctors
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.060]  of how important it seems like
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.500]  the endocannabinoid system is.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.660]  And, you know, when my son would suffer
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.780]  from seizures and stuff,
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.540]  and we found out that CBD is a way to fix that.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.060]  Nobody was talking about that.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:46.540]  There's just so many things that feel like-
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.660]  It's crazy, Brian, that the fact
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.220]  that the endocannabinoid system
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:54.660]  regulates your entire body.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:55.500]  It's everything.
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:59.140]  Every single process and function
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:03.020]  is regulated by the endocannabinoid system.
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:07.460]  And medical industry doesn't even acknowledge it.
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.860]  I've talked to so many doctors
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.460]  that like they have no idea
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:16.220]  that this master regulatory system like even exists.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.300]  Like it's the one that's in charge of all the other systems.
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.660]  And they're not taught about that in medical school.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:23.140]  And that's like everything you need to know
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.980]  that like they don't care about making us healthy.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:28.460]  Like they have their agenda, you know,
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.260]  like it's-
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.420]  Profits, profits, profits.
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.580]  To be clear, these are MDs we're talking about.
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.420]  Cause I know there's a lot of people that,
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.660]  actual MDs that have no idea.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.740]  And that's the part that is kind of in a way almost creepy.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.860]  And you know, why would they be teaching that?
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.740]  And you know, I don't want to talk about the immune system
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.700]  in a variety of ways,
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.740]  whether it's with current situations or before.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.540]  Like it just seemed like those things weren't taught.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.020]  And, you know, when I grew up in the South
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.180]  and I can assure you,
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:59.820]  nobody was teaching us that food was health.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.420]  You know, green beans had lard and bacon in it, you know?
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.420]  And that was literally my family called that a vegetable.
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.780]  So I feel like there's just a huge learning curve
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.340]  with maybe how you're growing up on what is nutrition.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.340]  You know, the difference between actual like water
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:17.060]  and, you know, Dasani or something like that.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.100]  You know, mountain water,
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.660]  El Dorado mountain water here in Colorado
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:23.020]  is drastically different than Dasani water.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.500]  But I don't feel like a lot of people believe that
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.900]  or would see that.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.580]  You know, Brian, I wanted to touch on something
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.740]  and just reel the audience back in
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:35.140]  and talk about the endocannabinoid system for a minute.
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:39.500]  So back in the early 1900s,
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.740]  DuPont came around and wanted to sell the US Navy rope
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:48.900]  because basically that whole shipping industry
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:51.940]  was controlled by hemp rope.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:55.460]  And so they created this toxic nylon rope
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:59.300]  with all kinds of waste because they had money
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.180]  and they wanted to take over the industry.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:04.140]  So they convinced the Navy
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:07.500]  that they would give them the rope for short money.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:12.500]  But in return, they had to banish hemp production
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.180]  in the country.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.580]  And so they were able to accomplish this
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.740]  through politics, money and power.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:24.860]  And so basically hemp farms
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:27.700]  were basically shut down left and right.
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.300]  And that was great.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.980]  But then, you know, some of the farms kept growing it
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.900]  or because it was wild everywhere,
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.340]  we kept making hemp rope.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:40.460]  And, you know, DuPont in the traditional of Rockefeller
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:44.820]  is kill, not work nicely with your competition,
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.220]  but kill them, take them the fuck out
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:49.460]  so you don't have any competitors.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:52.380]  So then they pushed another law through
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:53.620]  in the United States of America.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:56.500]  And that was that if any farmer was caught
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:59.260]  with any hemp on its property,
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.340]  that farm would be seized by the US government.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.460]  So what do you think the farmers did?
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.020]  They burned every single plant they could find.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:10.380]  They eradicated that from the United States of America
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:13.900]  to protect their own interests, to protect their livelihood.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:18.140]  And the consequences of that was that all of our animals
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.220]  were living on that wild.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.860]  Livestock feed.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.140]  They were living on that stuff.
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.100]  That was the food source for the whole soil food web.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.420]  And guess what?
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.860]  For all the health of all those animals
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:34.140]  and the health of the people that consumed those animals.
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.740]  So all of a sudden the human race was starved
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.060]  of endocannabinoid health
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.740]  because the hemp plant was not being consumed
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:44.940]  by what we consumed.
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:46.940]  Scary thought.
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.340]  Absolutely, man.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.300]  I mean, that's when the health decline began.
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.620]  Cancer started showing up.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:56.180]  All kinds of diseases started showing up years later.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:01.180]  And so bottom line is that there are some doctors out there,
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.380]  MDs that will talk about the endocannabinoid system,
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.380]  but for years they've been banished and called quacks
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:11.500]  and not allowed to participate
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.780]  in the medical ivory fucking tower
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.620]  that's run by the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.340]  And that's the scary shit.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.900]  And now it's finally coming out
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:26.020]  and we're still trying to regulate this plant,
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:29.900]  control this plant, let big money control the plant.
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.540]  And that's the fucking problem.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.420]  And hemp is no different than cannabis.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.260]  They're the same fucking plant.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.900]  Those are government words.
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.260]  It's fucking scary.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:43.140]  So yeah, Brian, that's what we're up against
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:48.380]  is trying to break down the gates of the ivory tower
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.620]  and say enough is enough, motherfucker.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.380]  We'll warn you, the first one through the gate
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.740]  always gets bloody, man.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:59.860]  So here's sharpening our swords and shields
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.020]  and fucking attacking.
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.020]  Fuck yeah.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:04.660]  Right at the same time that they took out hemp
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:08.060]  from our diets and made us endocannabinoid deficient.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:11.220]  They also patented all these petrochemical medicines
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:14.060]  and that's where like big pharma really got its hold.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:19.060]  And they use that power of the media
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.140]  to label all of these plant medicines
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:24.220]  that we've been using for thousands of years as alternative.
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.220]  And now they have these regular medicines,
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:30.220]  like this new and improved medicine
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.500]  and all these other plant medicines are alternative
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.020]  and like they're putting the shadow or whatever.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.620]  And so like all of this is happening at the same time
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.780]  and right around the same time
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:42.780]  that we started waging war on our soils
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:46.780]  and using byproducts of making bombs
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.500]  to feed our plants synthetically.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:52.500]  And so like we've just been waging war
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.500]  on so many different aspects all from around the same time.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.220]  And like, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.700]  Things are accumulating really fast
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.620]  and there's so many health problems
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:04.060]  and everything happening now.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.900]  And it all goes back to the soil.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.180]  For real.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.820]  Right there.
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.340]  Yep, bam.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.820]  This book right here is awesome
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.780]  for the endocannabinoid system.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:20.820]  The Holistic Healing Guide to Cannabis by Tammy Sweet.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:21.980]  Yeah, there we go.
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:22.820]  Nice.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.100]  Is it a pretty easy read?
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.780]  Yeah, there's a lot of charts and stuff in here
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:30.700]  and some nice visuals,
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:33.540]  but they break down the endocannabinoid system.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.820]  And like this here,
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.620]  this is like the degradation of cannabinoids
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.740]  and like where it all comes from,
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.020]  from like the mother CBD or CBGA
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.100]  and how it all breaks down.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.380]  And then like these raw cannabinoids
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:54.380]  are decarboxylated or oxidized or whatever.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.820]  They can change and evolve.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:01.300]  Yeah, it's all about redox, oxidation and redox.
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:02.140]  Right?
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:04.660]  I know it's heady shit, but it's all related.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:06.300]  Definitely.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.300]  Brian, if you want me to chase someone down
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:13.460]  to come on and talk about that, I will.
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.140]  I would love to learn more about redox.
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.940]  Yeah, I think, well, yeah.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.500]  Redox or endocannabinoid.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.820]  A variety of things.
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:20.660]  Both, yeah.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:25.220]  Redox is a newer thing to me for sure.
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:27.100]  Are you familiar with the Matt Powers book,
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.380]  Regenerative Soil?
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.140]  Familiar with it.
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:32.460]  Matt Powers has been pumping out some education.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.300]  Dude, that book.
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:34.140]  Shout out to you.
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:35.620]  I feel like that might be like,
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:37.020]  like out of all of these here,
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.220]  it's like that might be the one that I recommend most.
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.100]  It has like a little bit of everything in there
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.780]  and it's like really well written,
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.020]  really well illustrated and stuff.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.340]  They got like a whole section
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:49.660]  on redox potential and everything.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:50.500]  So, yeah.
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:53.060]  Redox is deep.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:54.740]  For real.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:55.580]  Yeah.
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:58.500]  Hussan, I forget his last name,
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.420]  was the one that really kind of-
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.420]  Olivier.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.260]  Olivier.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.460]  Olivier, that's right.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.180]  Was the one that really kind of brought out
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.700]  or introduced something that we knew about for a long time.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:12.980]  But again, it was the awakening of lost knowledge
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:14.700]  that he provided.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.100]  That's so much of this.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:18.380]  He's on Jon Kemp's podcast
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.180]  and I think you can listen to it for free.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.020]  Oh, sweet.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.460]  Yeah, you got to put on your seatbelt
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:24.300]  and your fucking helmet.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.140]  Yeah.
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:26.420]  It's a hard one to follow.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.300]  So many of these,
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.820]  it's like I can't listen to these podcasts.
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.140]  Like even this one included,
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:32.580]  like when I'm working,
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:34.420]  I got to sit down with a notebook
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:37.500]  to like really fully get the benefit of it.
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.580]  We were hoping that we were trying to dial it down
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:44.580]  because yeah, some of the real brilliant minded people,
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.900]  for some of us,
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:49.540]  that's a three or four time video kind of thing.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.860]  Yeah, constantly rewinding.
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:52.340]  Not everybody has time for that, for sure.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.180]  For sure.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:57.020]  Yeah, comprehending some of that upper level stuff
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.740]  is hard for a lot of us.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:52:59.900]  And I think that's why, again,
[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:02.140]  with the living soil systems,
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.540]  the main point of that, I guess,
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:07.980]  is to just trust the process.
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:09.380]  Because when you start farming with that,
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:10.380]  you'll see with your own eyes,
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:12.300]  you'll see the overall health of your plants
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:13.420]  start to improve.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:16.260]  Maybe we can't pronounce every single word
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.180]  that's going on in the soil food web,
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:20.420]  but you can see for yourself.
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.260]  And I feel like as long as you trust the process,
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:25.180]  continue to make sure that there's enough organic matter.
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.420]  That's something else that I feel like
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.220]  a lot of people talk about
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.900]  is when there's not enough organic matter,
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.140]  the worms can leave.
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:33.900]  Is there a certain kind of gold nuggets,
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.100]  I know you're familiar with the show,
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.100]  that you could kind of give people
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.980]  at the level that you're continually worm farming,
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.460]  are there certain consistencies
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.940]  and ways to improve things
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:46.460]  that would help us in the long run?
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:50.620]  So like, yeah, in our big old rows of worms,
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.780]  they don't run out of food source or anything.
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.380]  And when they do, they kind of just migrate over.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:58.580]  They can sense where the fresh stuff is.
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:00.940]  So like, we'll put a fresh pile
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.580]  right up touching the finished pile.
[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:05.620]  So like, you can see the worms
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.660]  kind of start to migrate over there.
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:10.740]  But when we were talking about breeding too,
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:11.620]  I wanted to mention this,
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:14.980]  but like top dressing or like feeding your worms
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:17.420]  organic matter on top, like with the avocado tech,
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.580]  or like I said, we grow a bunch of squash here
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:23.740]  and pumpkins and melons and all that stuff
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:26.020]  is insane for them.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:30.620]  They love that nice moist consistency
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.180]  and they love the fats of the avocado and everything.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:34.940]  And so like when they come up
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:37.420]  and they eat all of that food
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.100]  and like you could amend it if you want to,
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:40.300]  like with the avocado tech,
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.620]  you can add some dry amendments,
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.580]  but like they'll come up and they'll eat all that food.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:48.180]  And they have like a big like orgy pretty much.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.820]  Like all these worms are rubbing against each other
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:53.140]  and they have both the eggs and the sperm on them.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.420]  And they end up creating these cocoons at the end.
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:59.940]  And so like you have a huge baby boom
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:02.780]  and then all those worms disperse back through your soil
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.020]  or back through your compost
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:06.860]  and they released whatever they just ate.
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.500]  So you guys are familiar with the avocado tech
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:14.180]  in your soils, but basically just tossing anything
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:15.460]  right on top of your soil.
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:18.020]  It could even be like wet cardboard if that's all you have.
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:20.340]  But like we obviously recommend using something
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.100]  more nutritious than that.
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.020]  But just putting something wet right on top of the soil,
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:25.860]  they're gonna come up
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.220]  and they're gonna have a big population boom.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.180]  I wanted to touch on the organic matter a little bit too,
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:36.060]  because this is something I don't think that most people get
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.740]  in soil testing.
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:40.220]  There's two critical, three critical components
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:43.540]  that understand or that are what's called
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.580]  your cation exchange capacity.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.100]  So that capacity means the ability to hold nutrients
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.820]  on the site, plant available.
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:55.220]  So when the plant wants it, it can exchange it
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:59.300]  for either another ionic form or grow out a bacteria
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:02.380]  that will consume that and make it plant available.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.200]  So the higher the organic matter,
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:07.460]  the higher your exchange capacity,
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.540]  the more nutrients that can be held on
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.020]  and not lost through solubility.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.460]  So in other words, they're not mobile.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.220]  They won't wash out of the soil.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.100]  So organic matter is number one
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.420]  with the most exchange sites,
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:24.300]  both for anions and cations.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:26.220]  Clay is number two.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.180]  It will hold some anions and some cations
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:31.540]  or more cation than anion.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.980]  And silt will hold anions.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:36.960]  So with sand or not, excuse me, sand,
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.700]  with silt, clay and organic matter,
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:42.620]  now you can increase the amount of what we call
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:46.540]  nutrient capacity that that soil can hold onto.
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.820]  And where does those nutrients come from?
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:52.140]  The breaking down of all of these components by the soil.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:56.300]  Something interesting that you talked about up front
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.580]  in the beginning and said,
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.660]  you talked about sand coming into your pile
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.420]  and you attributed it to the worms.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:05.220]  Well, some of it, that is true,
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:09.180]  but most of it is actually what's called mineralization
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.340]  or remineralization.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.460]  I saw Greens, shout out to Greens goddess
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:14.820]  said the same thing about hers,
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.420]  that she's get sand in her pile
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:19.220]  and doesn't understand where it's coming from.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:21.540]  So bottom line is years back,
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.520]  I had a thousand gallon aquaculture system.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.620]  The only thing that I would allow in there
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:31.400]  was a really good high grade fish food and water.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:33.780]  And I collected the fish for us.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:38.300]  I created a collection system to pull all of the
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.900]  suspended solids out of the water column
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.260]  so that the water that went back into the aquaculture tank
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:48.140]  was crystal clear.
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:50.900]  And at the end of every five days,
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.060]  I would take that waste,
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.060]  which was the foundation of my product.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:00.460]  And I would use it in a process of aerobic stabilization
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:03.420]  and introduction to compost and vermicastings,
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.700]  vermicompost.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.900]  And then I would, what's called soft collide that.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:11.700]  And that was the product that I used to rehab soil.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.300]  Well, interestingly enough,
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.620]  there was always sand on the bottom of that filter.
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:18.940]  And I was like, where the hell is this sand coming from?
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.180]  So I called a buddy of mine,
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:22.780]  Dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons down at university Arizona.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.260]  And I said, hey, Kev,
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:26.020]  I don't understand what's going on here.
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:28.300]  I mean, the only thing I'm allowing in this system
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:29.420]  is water and fish food.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.780]  And I don't believe there's a lot of sand in fish food
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:34.780]  because I've crushed it up and I couldn't find any grit
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:36.820]  or any sand in it.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:38.420]  Was it's remineralization.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:41.060]  So the biology is stealing different parts
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.340]  and components of these molecules
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:47.380]  and it automatically forms a stronger bond on the electron.
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:51.020]  And so they suck together and they begin to form sand.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.780]  Now the sand is watered in minerals,
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:57.660]  minerals that were lost through biological processes.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.380]  But that's the bottom line as to why you're getting grit.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.220]  And other people-
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:02.060]  That's so cool.
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:02.900]  Isn't that bad ass?
[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:03.740]  Yeah, thank you so much, man.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:05.620]  Yeah, a little gold nugget, right?
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:07.580]  Yeah, I was gonna say, so that's kind of, again,
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.580]  another little thing of proof that the process is working
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:11.980]  is when you do see that sand,
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:14.580]  you know that things are really taking hold.
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:15.860]  Nice.
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:16.740]  Yeah, very cool.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:18.780]  You're getting close to stasis.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.060]  Hell yeah, man.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.260]  Sorry, I didn't mean to go on that rant.
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.260]  And then improving things with the worms,
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.220]  are you adding any amendments like extra calcium?
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:34.420]  Because I noticed when using AvocadoTech
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:36.700]  and then adding like drizzling calcium,
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.380]  especially coral calcium,
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:40.120]  seemed like that was on a whole nother level.
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:42.040]  So they would get the gumball effect
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.200]  that you had mentioned, like the gum orgy,
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:46.400]  to go deeper.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.920]  Worms are hermaphrodites, that's what he was getting at.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:52.920]  So once they touch each other, they wanna reproduce.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.680]  And so if you're able to add a bunch
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:58.160]  of those little reproduction zones into your soil system,
[01:59:58.160 --> 01:59:59.640]  especially if you're using larger beds,
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.200]  or if it's a smaller system,
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:03.320]  maybe you just need one avocado.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.120]  The main thing that I wanna preach on this,
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.480]  because I don't feel like a lot of people hear this part,
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.840]  the goal is to use avocados that your family ate,
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.240]  the shells, if they go bad, which happens a lot of times,
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.300]  let's be honest, and especially in a larger family.
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:19.060]  So instead of throwing that away,
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.200]  going to the grocery stores and asking them,
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:24.440]  what do you do with your avocados, that kind of stuff,
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.320]  spending money on organic avocados
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.400]  just to put into your worm bin,
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.640]  is really the last thing that I would say,
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.080]  unless you're maybe in a city
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:35.240]  and you wanna do this in an apartment.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.880]  That's the only option you have.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.720]  Or whatever, you know.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:40.000]  But still, you could negotiate things to where-
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.480]  The avocado tech is about the shell.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:45.840]  Squash, pumpkin, all these other gourds
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:48.120]  can be used, it's the same thing.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  Cut them in half and pack them full of minerals
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.800]  and fats and stuff like that.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.640]  So it's really, it's the shell.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.880]  We should call it shell tech and not avocado tech.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:59.160]  Yeah, honestly, and especially like with the melons,
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.560]  like you don't wanna just chop a melon in half
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.560]  and have all that flesh right on there.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.480]  You mainly want the rind.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.000]  Or you're gonna have massive, sometimes even fungus gnats.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.600]  Yeah, you're gonna have fruit flies and fungus gnats.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:12.760]  And an anaerobic pocket,
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:15.520]  which is gonna take time to go out.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.480]  And you can have that with avocado tech as well.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:18.960]  Like avocado tech should be done
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.920]  when you're really trying to boost the worm population
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:23.720]  and really speed things up.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.840]  But if the worms aren't there yet,
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:27.760]  it's going to cause massive issues.
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.400]  And that's why we always kind of teach
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.840]  about cutting an X into the avocado
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:34.320]  and popping it open like a baked potato
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.800]  until it's really popping off.
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.200]  Otherwise, when you cut it in half,
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.880]  it seems like you're creating more of those mites.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.600]  And if it's not alive and thriving,
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:46.120]  then you got the fungus gnats, which is the vector.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:47.240]  The worms aren't eating the food,
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.280]  they're eating the microbes.
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.480]  And like, you need to break it down
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.760]  and increase the surface area and everything
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.040]  and like let them actually get in there
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.040]  to break things down faster.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.200]  It's definitely a good point.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.320]  You don't want just like them.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.440]  Do you feel like the fats are the reason why
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.200]  after a while, it seems like all the worms
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.400]  get this nice, rich, dark purple.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.040]  They have that biofilm that seems like
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.480]  the springtails just naturally stick to.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.880]  And then like you guys had mentioned,
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.120]  it seems like those internet ways
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.120]  that we used to call them like fiber optic networks,
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.000]  like going from dial up to that fiber optic network
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.280]  is a drastic difference, it seems like,
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:25.920]  when you understand worm farming.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.000]  Definitely.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:32.240]  So what do you think, is the purpling from the fats,
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.080]  is the purpling from the calcium?
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.600]  I'm not sure, I think it might just be a sign
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.880]  like that they're eating good,
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.520]  that they have the minerals that they need and everything.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:45.200]  But as far as calcium, like,
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.840]  that's one of the cool things about worms,
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:49.240]  it's like they're constantly calcifying everything
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.920]  that goes through them.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.920]  They're adding calcium sulfate, is it?
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:58.520]  I forget which form of calcium it is, but.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.120]  I think it's calcium carbonate, but I'm not sure.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.880]  But they're adding calcium to everything that they poop out.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:10.320]  And so like, obviously we know how important calcium is.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.760]  But yeah, we don't add too many separate mineral amendments
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:18.040]  or anything like that.
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.320]  Like we've experimented with like top dressing kelp
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  a little bit.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.100]  And like we experiment with,
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:25.800]  like I know we talked about the Bokashi food scraps,
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.520]  but sometimes we'll actually toss
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.240]  some Bokashi brand down as well.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:31.680]  Eggshells.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.120]  Eggshells are all gone through the thermophilic process
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:39.240]  with everything, especially like,
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.940]  if you don't clean them off first,
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.240]  like that could be breeding grounds for salmonella
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:45.360]  or whatever, I think.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.040]  But, and my personal, like, grow and everything,
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.920]  yeah, I toss some eggshells down there.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.880]  Because honestly, I have a more problem
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:56.280]  running out of organic matter for the pill bugs
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.640]  than I do for the worms.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.400]  You know, the worms, I never worry about them really.
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.120]  But the pill bugs, you gotta keep those fuckers fed
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:08.880]  or you gotta keep their population under control
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:10.680]  or they can really wreak some havoc.
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.880]  Yeah. Same thing with the worms, let's be clear.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:14.720]  Yeah.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.160]  If you're, especially if a basement farmer, a tent farmer,
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.680]  and you let the worms kind of take over a 30 gallon pot,
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:22.960]  yeah, you're gonna basically be growing
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.120]  worm castings and again, that's not good either.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:28.400]  That's the thing too, is like with these no-till pots,
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.320]  you know, that are cycle after cycle
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.160]  and they have healthy worm populations,
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.960]  it's like, they're gonna eat all that stuff.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:37.200]  Like there's not gonna be any rice hulls in there anymore.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.360]  And like, everything's gonna turn into worm castings
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.200]  like you're talking about.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:43.280]  And so like, that's why I really like,
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.320]  like in between cycles, I'll top dress
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.340]  more aeration sources, you know,
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.320]  because like constantly throughout the cycle,
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.000]  we're defoliating our leaves
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.040]  and we're chopping and dropping our cover crop.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.680]  And like, we're just creating more castings
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.440]  on top of the problem, you know?
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.600]  But like, if you can toss in some biochar
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.200]  or some like long-term aeration
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:04.800]  that is going to, you know, settle down into it
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:06.520]  and then you toss more leaves on top of it,
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:09.160]  it's like, you're not just perpetuating that problem.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:14.080]  Like you're adding a solution of more aeration as well.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.840]  So I don't know if any of you have ever done that,
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:19.280]  like top dress aeration and...
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:22.120]  No, I've heard about people top dressing sand
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.440]  and I think it's a good idea, especially if it worms.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.840]  But this goes back to soil structure.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:31.720]  Yeah, if your entire pot turns to worm castings,
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:33.720]  you've collapsed the soil structure
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:37.200]  of allowing air to penetrate down in there.
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.320]  You're holding too much moisture.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:41.640]  And that goes back to that horizontal soil system.
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:43.960]  By having that sand filter on the bottom,
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:45.960]  you're allowed to pull out excess moisture
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.680]  and as the top dries out,
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:50.080]  it naturally wicks that moisture back up again.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.120]  So that's another trick for the group.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:55.600]  For sure.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.040]  I love that, Horizons.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:00.320]  But that's something, another benefit of the cover crop,
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.120]  I think, is that wicking aspect.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.640]  You know, it's like, one, it prevents like the channels
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:07.560]  for the water to actually penetrate down.
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:11.000]  But then two, it's like, if things were to dry up,
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.520]  that those roots would wick all that moisture back up.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.400]  And like, we see the cover crop
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:19.680]  really helps keep consistent moisture throughout the piles.
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.800]  Right, and it doesn't let the surface go hydrophobic.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.640]  Exactly.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:25.200]  And causes even more problems.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.040]  Yeah.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:28.600]  For those, dude, I can't believe you cover crop.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.680]  I'm just so happy.
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:32.480]  I mean, that's like, you're the only person I've ever heard
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:35.120]  that cover crops the compost piles.
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.320]  Me too, honestly.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:38.480]  I've had amazing results doing that.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.200]  Just amazing results.
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.000]  So, you know, big kudos for first.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.840]  Awesome, man.
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:43.920]  Yeah, we heard.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.040]  Hell yeah.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.000]  Appreciate that.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.440]  Yeah, yeah, my pleasure.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.320]  Good to watch you again, Brian.
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.240]  My mic, I don't know, man.
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:52.680]  The only way I know how to do it, boys,
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.960]  is to exit out and then come back and I plug in
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:55.800]  and then it works.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:58.720]  Otherwise I can't hear anything you're saying.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.120]  But I did, when I popped back on, talk about cover crop.
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:04.080]  And I don't know how to say this
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:05.840]  other than probably sounding ridiculous,
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:08.640]  but that has gotta be the extra secret sauce
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.880]  of once you start to understand teaming with microbes
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.920]  and Dr. Lane Ingham and all those extra things.
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:16.960]  It seems like vermicomposting with a cover crop,
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.600]  using the chop and drop method,
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:22.320]  in my opinion, adding all of the different decomposers
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:24.200]  so that you are closer to mother nature.
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:25.960]  The closer we can replicate, the better.
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:28.880]  The closer we can get to the old growth forest, the better.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:32.280]  And in my opinion, again, getting the larger pot
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:35.400]  so that you have that larger stomach to work with.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:38.640]  That I feel like is really the next level
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.600]  of vermicomposting and taking it to the next level
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.380]  by using exudates and kind of getting deeper into that.
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.040]  I was hoping, especially with you, Layton,
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.520]  since you worked at Rodale,
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:50.320]  and I feel like a lot of that stuff came out of there,
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.400]  or at least from my knowledge,
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.760]  when I learned about exudates was coming from Rodale
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.520]  and from Dr. Lane Ingham.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.040]  So maybe we can dive deeper on to what exudates
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.960]  are really doing to that soil system,
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:03.600]  as well as just, it seems like improving everything
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:04.480]  on that cycle.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.960]  It seemed like every kind of 90 days, in my opinion,
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.680]  just really started to take off.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.440]  And if you continue to chop and drop,
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.760]  you were amazed at how quickly they were breaking down
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:14.560]  all of that organic matter.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.400]  Yeah, sure.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.440]  So I noticed in the chat, people are talking about,
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:21.320]  well, how do you turn your compost pile into a cover crop?
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  Well, that's the whole point.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.280]  You don't.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.520]  This is for static piles.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.680]  So first you wanna go through pathogen reduction,
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:28.640]  which means to allow it heat up,
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:31.480]  or if you're building a bio pile,
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.560]  then you don't worry about thermophytes
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:35.880]  because you're not putting anything in there
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:38.160]  that could potentially have a pathogen.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.320]  So in other words, it's a vegan compost style.
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:46.080]  It's what I often do, is just plants only.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:51.080]  But anyway, so understanding that if you're building a pile
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:57.080]  and you're using cover crops as a method to hold moisture,
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:00.560]  prevent the compost or the vermicompost
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.840]  from drying out in the sun, getting penetrated by UVs,
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:07.360]  going hydrophobic, which means when you put water on it,
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:09.360]  it just runs right off.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:14.200]  Now, the real secret sauce is the roots.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.880]  If you can grow miles of roots through your compost
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.720]  or your vermicompost, every component of that root
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:25.440]  is covered with what's called the rhizosphere.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:28.960]  The rhizosphere is where the magic is happening.
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.920]  So that's where your protozoa are growing out.
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.440]  That's where your nematodes are growing out.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.920]  So backing it up and understanding prey-predator theory.
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:42.600]  So if you have a food source, you're gonna attract prey.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.200]  You're gonna attract deer.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.240]  And the deer are gonna come in and they're gonna breed
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.240]  and they're gonna get crazy and just have orgies
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.200]  and have tons and tons of kids.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.880]  And now the mountain lions are gonna come in.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:53.000]  The bears are gonna come in.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.680]  And those represent the protozoa and the nematodes.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:59.520]  So you've gotta start by building those miles
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:02.720]  of rhizospheres so that you can bring in
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.840]  this predator-prey process.
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:08.240]  And as a matter of fact, the more predators you get
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.560]  as they reduce the population of prey
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.240]  will go into what's called cyst form.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:17.360]  So now they're basically little eggs ready to hatch
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.200]  when they're exposed to the right environment again.
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.360]  So you're really building this incredible long-term diversity
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.400]  and power within that pile by using those roots.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.160]  Now, recently we've come to understand that exudates
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:35.040]  are more than just a food source.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:38.400]  Exudates can be an ionic exchange.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.040]  In other words, the plant can push out a magnesium
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:44.200]  and exchange it for calcium.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.160]  That's where it goes back into that it's a carbon.
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:51.760]  Exudates are actually a carbon source.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:54.440]  And there's a new company in Maine, shout out to Maine.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.880]  I know there's a bunch of you guys up there,
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.200]  that has just brought out a test where they can actually
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:05.240]  get so far as to identify excess exudates.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.920]  So say the plant wants calcium
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:11.960]  and it squirts out this specific cookie or cake,
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.120]  you know, this molecule of sugar.
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:15.040]  Cocktail.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.040]  Cocktail that encourages the calcium mining bacteria
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:23.320]  to go out and find it and make it,
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:25.440]  release it, plant available.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.400]  So all of a sudden the plant's squeezing this out
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.080]  and there's bacteria running out of the calcium source.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.320]  So the bacteria start to die off
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.120]  and they release their pantry,
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:39.760]  their goodies that they've stored in their body
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:42.640]  as energy source to back to the plant.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.800]  But now the plant's not getting the calcium
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.720]  that was being absorbed by those bacteria.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:50.040]  And so all of a sudden now there's an excess
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.600]  of this exudate in the soil
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:56.200]  that is kind of just hanging out there.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:00.760]  Again, a long-term carbon source.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.200]  So that carbon will eventually get chewed up
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.800]  when another cycle happens,
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.760]  whether it's a seasonal cycle
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:10.920]  or whether it's just a water was reintroduced
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:13.960]  and perhaps washed in some calcium
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.720]  or whatever the scenario is,
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:18.120]  because there's a billion of them.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.840]  That exudate will then be absorbed
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:23.360]  by either another organism, another biology or bacteria,
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.440]  or consumed when the calcium
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.960]  is reintroduced into the system again.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.840]  So nothing goes to waste,
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.440]  but more importantly, understanding
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.680]  that the more plants you have on the soil,
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.360]  the more carbon you're storing,
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.200]  not only in roots, but in exudates as well, and in biomass.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.360]  So there's a lot to really understand.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.600]  Yeah, that this surface of the earth
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:50.560]  is not supposed to be bare.
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:53.680]  Supposed to be lush with plants,
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:58.680]  constantly changing as the seasons go on.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:12:59.800]  Hang on one second.
[02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:05.980]  Yeah, it's not drought that causes bare ground.
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:08.060]  It's bare ground that causes drought.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:09.980]  I really like that quote.
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:12.780]  Yeah, and I think for a lot of the newer,
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:14.340]  oh, there's a question for you.
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:17.460]  Carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:21.220]  So we like six parts carbon
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.260]  to three parts nitrogen,
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:25.780]  and then one part like a high nitrogen.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:30.180]  And so that's like the golden ratio there.
[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:31.580]  What do you think, Layton?
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:34.020]  So that's three to one?
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:35.300]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:39.980]  So we do six parts carbon, three parts nitrogen,
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:41.740]  and then one part high nitrogen.
[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:44.660]  So like the little extra.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:46.020]  Yeah, you're two to one to one.
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.340]  All right, with worms, that makes sense.
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:51.860]  Are you saying like alfalfa meal, high nitrogen?
[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:55.220]  Yeah, alfalfa meal would be good.
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:58.540]  A lot of the time it's like this manure
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.300]  that's like mainly bedding
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:02.340]  that is like totally soaked with urine.
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:04.660]  And so like that's gonna be a lot higher nitrogen
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:06.900]  when it's like totally soaked like that.
[02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:09.780]  Now, if that was straight composting,
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:11.060]  you'd definitely have issues.
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:13.140]  You'd have to be turning that pile a lot.
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:17.060]  Maybe that's your thermophilic process.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:18.620]  Yeah, so that's the thing.
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:19.740]  It's like that's the recipe
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.660]  that goes into the thermophilic process.
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:23.020]  And then from there it comes out
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:24.660]  and goes through the worms and everything.
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.860]  So I do a static.
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:29.060]  So I'm more like three to one.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:34.060]  So it's 66% browns, 33% greens.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:37.340]  So that's two to one.
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:40.460]  The guy I'm working with here in Santa Paula
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:42.340]  is a three to one.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.300]  So he's three browns to one green.
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:45.420]  But as I said to him, I go,
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:46.980]  dude, you can't control that shit.
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:48.700]  I see how much crap's coming through here.
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:50.620]  Yeah, that's your target goal.
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:53.900]  But you've got to grind up whatever comes in that day.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:55.740]  You can't push it off to the side.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:56.940]  Okay, yeah.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.540]  So there's a lot of issues with like waste streams,
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:03.740]  whereas you're in complete control of it.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:06.580]  And because you have that aeration,
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:10.060]  yeah, you can go with a much higher nitrogen source
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:12.620]  because you're controlling the temperature.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:13.580]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:15.620]  So that works fine.
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:17.580]  But for somebody who just wants to do
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:20.860]  a small scale at home composting,
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:24.660]  66% greens or browns, 33% greens
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.460]  will generally never get you in trouble.
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.700]  And then if you do want to play with a little high nitrogen,
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.540]  I love your 10%.
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:33.300]  I would never go over that.
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:35.180]  But then be prepared to turn it because-
[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:36.820]  Yeah, it's gonna heat up.
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:38.300]  Yeah, it's gonna bump that heat up.
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:42.780]  And if you're trying to maintain biologics,
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.820]  you don't want to go over 120 degrees.
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:46.660]  As soon as you go over 120,
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:48.700]  you are starting to lose your diversity.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:51.780]  As a matter of fact, even 110, 115,
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:53.860]  you're definitely affecting the diversity.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:56.060]  The worms don't like to be in that,
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:16:00.820]  they'll like it around 90, around the highest.
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:03.220]  That's a little lower than I had always thought too, Laden.
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:06.340]  So 120, I had always thought it was 130.
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:08.020]  So 120 or even-
[02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:12.100]  Yeah, 130 is when the thermophytes take over.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:15.420]  So after 130, you're only gonna be getting
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:19.780]  what are called thermophilic biology, all right?
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:24.100]  120, you are going to start
[02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:26.760]  to lose the mesophilics completely.
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:32.080]  But what I've found is the real sweet spot is 85 degrees,
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:34.040]  which is what you found out too.
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.240]  And if I can maintain 85 and the right moisture level,
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:41.480]  every single amoeba that I see under the microscope
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:45.000]  is kissing, it's really not a secret, it's separated.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:45.840]  Yeah.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:46.660]  Imagine-
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:48.400]  It sounds like you created Miami or something,
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:49.240]  you know, Southern California.
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:50.680]  Perfect condition, man.
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:51.520]  Yeah.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:52.340]  Hell yeah.
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:54.360]  San Diego, of course everybody's having a good time.
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:55.200]  For real.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:58.040]  Damn.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:59.540]  And that really is what you're trying to do.
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:00.760]  I hope people see that.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:02.620]  I mean, every little pot that you have
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.680]  is going to be this little different utopia
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:05.600]  that you're trying to build,
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.960]  and there's gonna be nuances in each one of them.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.680]  The goal is obviously after hopefully a few months
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:14.000]  to a few years, you're really happy with those results.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.200]  And it depends on the size of the bin, obviously,
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.000]  or the raised bed, that kind of stuff.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.960]  But if you're really trying to do this,
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:23.080]  I would say the minimum that you would want to do,
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:27.040]  even if you're in an apartment, is probably 20, 25 gallon.
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:29.660]  If you really want to see the benefits of this.
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.520]  I don't see a lot of success with people
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:34.240]  that are using the five gallon, seven gallon.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.700]  A lot of them, even if they're just using
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:37.680]  the little red wigglers, tell me that they,
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.200]  I guess, can't keep up with it.
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.160]  And they come home one day and the red wigglers
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:42.560]  are everywhere on their kitchen floor
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.400]  or something like that.
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.280]  So I don't want that to ever deter somebody
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:51.240]  from doing this because it really is an easy fix
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:52.500]  to make sure that they never leave.
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:53.760]  And I know a lot of people will talk about
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:55.360]  how all the bugs and stuff.
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:58.320]  But again, as long as you, from my knowledge,
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.760]  really don't do excess of greens or excess of fruits
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:04.720]  and that kind of stuff, you're not gonna have those issues
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:06.760]  as long as everything seems dialed in.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.800]  And the main thing is to not get fungus gnats
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:11.320]  because it seems like that's what starts to,
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:13.640]  especially if you're new to this,
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.640]  fungus gnats are the vector that just bring in
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:17.680]  a lot of different things that now you have to learn
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:20.440]  how to manage a variety of different pest issues.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.580]  Where if you're being proactive and really building this
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:24.800]  from day one, before you ever put a cannabis plant
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:27.360]  into the ground, you have your worm farm up and running,
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.520]  vermicompost ready to go.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.700]  It's really gonna minimize any kind of bullshit pest issues
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:34.640]  from the beginning.
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.600]  And another thing too, for like the small worm bins,
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:41.200]  like don't just toss your food scraps right on top,
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:43.840]  like cover them a little bit with the substrate,
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:44.680]  whatever you have.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:47.600]  And like, that's gonna deter like the fruit flies
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:49.440]  and everything if it's covered up.
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:53.120]  Yeah, and you're right about them being a vector.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:54.240]  They really are.
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.560]  They're an indicator that you're out of balance.
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:00.040]  You probably have too much moisture, something's going on.
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:02.320]  So right away, they're an indicator telling you
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.160]  that you've gotta be more aware,
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:05.600]  you're doing something wrong.
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.480]  But also yes, they can easily spread other problems,
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:14.060]  whether it's fungal or bacterial that will attack
[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:14.900]  your plants.
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:17.100]  So you just gotta be super careful about that.
[02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:19.440]  Now I've got a billion dollar question for you.
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.920]  Have you ever seen high pressure or low pressure
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:24.720]  affect your worms?
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.740]  No.
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.860]  All right, pay attention to this one, all right?
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:34.560]  A buddy of mine who I brought up earlier, Richard,
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:37.840]  had an apartment in Pennsylvania,
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.720]  right down the street from Rodale.
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:43.320]  And he would bring his worms from his home
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.980]  and I think it was Black Bear or Big Bear, Pennsylvania,
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:48.280]  to his apartment.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:50.000]  Because he had most of his worm bins
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.240]  back at his parents' house in the basement and outside.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:57.240]  So he'd bring back bins for doing different projects
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:58.360]  at Rodale.
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.960]  And this one day, a supercell, a thunderstorm came in
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:07.880]  and we were at the farm and all of a sudden,
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:11.840]  the lightning went off and the clouds were clapping thunder
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:13.480]  and it got crazy.
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:15.960]  Richard freaked the fuck out and ran,
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:18.680]  jumped in his car and peeled rubber out of it.
[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:20.680]  And I was like, what the hell?
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.360]  Was he afraid of the thunder and lightning?
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:27.560]  So he comes back like six hours later,
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:31.040]  it's dripping sweat, just like exhausted, panting.
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:35.000]  And I'm like, what the fuck was that all about, dude?
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.960]  He goes, you don't understand, man.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:40.400]  My worms don't like the thunder or the lightning.
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.920]  I don't know what.
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.080]  But he goes, by the time I got back,
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:46.240]  all of the worms were out of the bins
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.200]  and all over the apartment floor.
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:49.040]  Wow.
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.240]  Dude, that is so wild.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:54.760]  So I never heard that before.
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:57.280]  No, he had pictures of it.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.120]  It was crazy.
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:00.040]  It was fucking crazy.
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:02.400]  But that was a real eye-opener
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:06.720]  that they too are sensitive to high or low pressures,
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:08.440]  or maybe it's the static charge.
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:11.160]  Now, we've all seen the Godzilla movie
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:13.520]  where the guy's sticking the probes down in
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.960]  and shocking the worms to get them to come up
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:19.600]  so he can collect them and measure the radioactive need
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:22.960]  or measure the radioactive inputs in them.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.800]  So we do know that there is something
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:26.760]  to the electrical side of that.
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:28.640]  And I don't know if it was lightning related
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:31.360]  or high pressure or low pressure, and nor did he.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.720]  But just pay attention to that.
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.560]  See if-
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.680]  Yeah, for real, I definitely will.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.520]  Super interesting.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:37.800]  So head out, people, if you have your worms
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:40.800]  on the first floor during a thunderstorm,
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:43.000]  might wanna put them in the garage or the basement.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.040]  I'll put a lid on there.
[02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:46.880]  Yep.
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:49.440]  All right, I'm gonna take a quick bathroom break
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.080]  if that's all right.
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:51.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:53.800]  I'll be back real quick.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:55.000]  Take your time, brother.
[02:21:57.530 --> 02:22:02.130]  And while he's doing that, in about 10 minutes,
[02:22:02.130 --> 02:22:05.650]  I gotta bring Valentina to,
[02:22:07.170 --> 02:22:09.090]  I would loosely call it soccer,
[02:22:09.090 --> 02:22:11.210]  but a bunch of three-year-olds
[02:22:12.610 --> 02:22:14.610]  running around for 30 minutes.
[02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:19.490]  So we can keep going and I can control stuff from my phone.
[02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:23.970]  But yeah, so anyway.
[02:22:23.970 --> 02:22:27.770]  So will you be back in time to close out at three
[02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:29.930]  or is that questionable?
[02:22:29.930 --> 02:22:31.650]  You wanna go till three?
[02:22:31.650 --> 02:22:33.810]  Well, I'm sorry, three hours.
[02:22:33.810 --> 02:22:36.730]  Because we're at two hours, 22 minutes.
[02:22:36.730 --> 02:22:39.690]  Yeah, no, I'm saying I can do it from my phone.
[02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:41.530]  Oh, okay, you can do it remotely.
[02:22:41.530 --> 02:22:43.050]  Yeah, I'll be like-
[02:22:43.050 --> 02:22:44.730]  Messing up again.
[02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:45.850]  Driving in the car.
[02:22:45.850 --> 02:22:47.850]  I'll either be in the car driving
[02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:50.370]  or running around with a bunch of little kids.
[02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:51.570]  I'll be like,
[02:22:54.450 --> 02:22:57.250]  like Kramer in that Seinfeld episode
[02:22:57.250 --> 02:22:59.570]  where he's like fighting all the little like,
[02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:02.290]  I'm gonna dominate the kids on the soccer field.
[02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:06.170]  So here's a question for you.
[02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:08.490]  Hey, Green, shout out, girl.
[02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:10.850]  All right, is it okay to have my compost pile
[02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:14.770]  raised a bit off the ground so I can collect underneath?
[02:23:14.810 --> 02:23:19.810]  All right, so in some of the best work that I've done
[02:23:19.850 --> 02:23:24.850]  in what I wanna call low temp composting,
[02:23:25.050 --> 02:23:28.970]  I actually built a Hugo style compost pile.
[02:23:28.970 --> 02:23:32.530]  So what I did was I laid down rotten logs
[02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:34.290]  and you want the old rotten ones
[02:23:34.290 --> 02:23:35.770]  because the ones that are kind of punky
[02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:36.970]  because they hold moisture
[02:23:36.970 --> 02:23:40.970]  and they've got a tremendous amount of saprobe fungi.
[02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:43.650]  And then I'd lay sticks down across the top of it
[02:23:43.650 --> 02:23:45.290]  to make a teepee.
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:47.730]  All right, and then on top of those sticks,
[02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:50.130]  brand new young twigs,
[02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:53.970]  I would lay down about three inches of hay or straw.
[02:23:53.970 --> 02:23:57.530]  Then I would build my compost pile on top of it.
[02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:59.530]  The reason I did this was a couple of fold.
[02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:02.370]  First of all, that would help to create
[02:24:02.370 --> 02:24:03.850]  a convection current.
[02:24:03.850 --> 02:24:05.930]  So pull the cool air underneath
[02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:08.970]  and allow the air to flow through the compost pile.
[02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:10.530]  Pull the cool air underneath
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:13.530]  and allow the hot air to escape out of the top.
[02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:17.090]  And I also found that as that broke down
[02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:20.170]  and eventually collapsed in on itself,
[02:24:20.170 --> 02:24:22.290]  it created an amazing compost.
[02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:26.050]  So I wasn't collecting from the bottom.
[02:24:26.050 --> 02:24:30.010]  I was more kind of going about it in an aerodynamic
[02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:33.730]  or thermodynamic approach to it.
[02:24:33.730 --> 02:24:36.130]  But I don't see why you can't.
[02:24:36.130 --> 02:24:37.410]  But I think at the end of the day,
[02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:40.370]  the goal is kind of trying to connect your compost
[02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:43.770]  with the existing microorganisms in the soil
[02:24:43.770 --> 02:24:45.930]  that's underneath your compost.
[02:24:45.930 --> 02:24:50.010]  So that's part of building IMO3
[02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:51.690]  is building it on soil.
[02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:55.130]  So you're collecting the indigenous soil microbes as well.
[02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:57.250]  So depending on your goal,
[02:24:58.170 --> 02:24:59.090]  happy birthday, uncle.
[02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:01.010]  I noticed you've adopted me as an uncle.
[02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.850]  No problem.
[02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:04.730]  So it really depends on your goal.
[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:08.210]  My gut feeling is that you probably wanna be collecting
[02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:12.530]  the material from the middle of the pile,
[02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:15.530]  not perhaps the bottom and not perhaps the top.
[02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:18.170]  Again, like having that top cover crop
[02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:21.290]  is providing such an amazing benefit,
[02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:23.370]  but you can just dig a little hole,
[02:25:23.370 --> 02:25:25.410]  like push the cover crop off, dig a little hole,
[02:25:25.410 --> 02:25:28.170]  and then just start collecting from that area,
[02:25:28.170 --> 02:25:30.610]  not necessarily collecting from the bottom or the top.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:34.050]  So I hope hopefully that long-winded answer helped you.
[02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:38.210]  All right, welcome back, brother.
[02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:39.050]  Thank you.
[02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:40.690]  Was the question where to choose like a sample
[02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:42.250]  out of your compost pile?
[02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:45.610]  No, she wanted to know if she could build her compost pile
[02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:48.330]  off the soil, like on pallets or something.
[02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:49.770]  Oh, okay, yeah, I see.
[02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:52.330]  Yeah, but let's talk a little bit about sampling
[02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:55.610]  because I think that's always been a big issue with people.
[02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:58.410]  They don't understand how to properly sample
[02:25:58.410 --> 02:26:01.530]  and or understanding that there's certain companies
[02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:05.530]  that do real compost, real compost testing.
[02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:08.450]  Composting testing is not the same as soil testing.
[02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:09.970]  They are much different.
[02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:10.810]  For sure.
[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:13.010]  Yeah, so you, yeah, let's chop it up on that.
[02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.850]  Why don't you go?
[02:26:13.850 --> 02:26:17.250]  I mean, honestly, like if we're talking about this stuff,
[02:26:17.250 --> 02:26:19.450]  I think you're gonna be a lot more beneficial
[02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:20.410]  talking about that.
[02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:23.290]  I don't feel maybe qualified enough
[02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:27.810]  to talk about all that sampling stuff.
[02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:29.770]  I'm sure I could learn a ton from you.
[02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:33.010]  So, all right, we'll go down that rabbit hole.
[02:26:33.010 --> 02:26:38.010]  So whenever you're sampling, like I get called into a job,
[02:26:38.130 --> 02:26:40.730]  whether it's a composting facility
[02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:44.650]  or it's a field or a facility, it doesn't matter.
[02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:49.650]  What I wanna do is get the best representation that I can,
[02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:53.010]  the conditions of where I'm at.
[02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:55.850]  So if I take a soil sample right here
[02:26:55.850 --> 02:26:58.490]  and I take another soil sample right over here,
[02:26:58.490 --> 02:27:00.010]  there are gonna be a difference there.
[02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:02.610]  Believe it or not, I don't care how close they are.
[02:27:02.610 --> 02:27:05.170]  You guys gotta wrap your head around
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:06.850]  what's really going on there.
[02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:08.810]  It's not gonna be uniform.
[02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:09.650]  So even-
[02:27:09.650 --> 02:27:11.130]  Especially in a modified growing medium.
[02:27:11.130 --> 02:27:11.970]  Right?
[02:27:11.970 --> 02:27:12.930]  Way, way different.
[02:27:12.930 --> 02:27:15.410]  Or even soil, because that's soil.
[02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:20.410]  90 or 80% of all soils are built through transportation.
[02:27:20.650 --> 02:27:21.490]  Yup.
[02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:23.770]  Wind or erosion, that's it.
[02:27:23.770 --> 02:27:27.250]  So no two places is the wind gonna deposit
[02:27:27.250 --> 02:27:29.170]  the exact same particles,
[02:27:29.170 --> 02:27:32.130]  nor is the erosion gonna deliver the same sand,
[02:27:32.130 --> 02:27:33.370]  silt and clay.
[02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:34.810]  So they're all gonna be different.
[02:27:34.810 --> 02:27:36.730]  So the goal is really to try to get
[02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:40.730]  a best representation possible
[02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:44.770]  of the existing system, macro system.
[02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:47.510]  So if it was a compost sample,
[02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:51.850]  I'd take a little bits from all around the whole pile.
[02:27:51.850 --> 02:27:52.690]  Cool.
[02:27:52.690 --> 02:27:53.730]  Some I'm gonna reach in,
[02:27:53.730 --> 02:27:55.250]  some I'm gonna take from the surface,
[02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:57.370]  some I'm gonna try to take from the bottom.
[02:27:57.370 --> 02:28:01.250]  Now, composting testing is completely different
[02:28:01.250 --> 02:28:02.690]  than soil testing.
[02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:05.210]  Soil testing, I'll do the same process,
[02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:09.010]  collecting the soil and mix them together
[02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:12.090]  and then make one super sample and then send that off.
[02:28:12.090 --> 02:28:13.210]  Same with compost.
[02:28:13.210 --> 02:28:16.850]  But in soil, you're doing soil chemistry
[02:28:16.850 --> 02:28:19.370]  and saturated paste test.
[02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:24.370]  In a compost, you're looking for maturity,
[02:28:24.370 --> 02:28:29.170]  C to N ratio, pH, which is similar to soil.
[02:28:29.170 --> 02:28:30.930]  And then there's a bunch of other ones,
[02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:33.810]  so Vita, which is the amount of ammonia gassing off.
[02:28:33.810 --> 02:28:35.450]  So it's a different animal.
[02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:37.770]  And I think most people don't understand that,
[02:28:37.770 --> 02:28:40.930]  that there are companies that do composting testing
[02:28:40.930 --> 02:28:43.170]  and then there's companies that do soil testing.
[02:28:43.170 --> 02:28:44.010]  Totally.
[02:28:44.010 --> 02:28:44.850]  Yeah, so that's a little-
[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:47.010]  And then the microbial part of it too,
[02:28:47.010 --> 02:28:49.170]  that's not even talking about microbial testing.
[02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:51.330]  There's all other tests, the microbial.
[02:28:51.330 --> 02:28:53.570]  So that's Soil Food Web.
[02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:55.450]  There's one in Oregon, there's one in New York
[02:28:55.450 --> 02:28:57.210]  and there's one in Connecticut.
[02:28:57.210 --> 02:28:59.210]  There's one in Australia, I believe too.
[02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:02.530]  We've gone through Earth Fort for the microbiology.
[02:29:02.530 --> 02:29:04.010]  They do a good job.
[02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:06.970]  Yeah, I've been working with Matt for a long time.
[02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:11.010]  And I think that to be honest with you,
[02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:18.130]  microscopes are a wonderful tool to qualify something.
[02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:23.130]  To look at it and say, okay, I see these guys.
[02:29:23.130 --> 02:29:26.730]  I know that I have a diversity,
[02:29:26.730 --> 02:29:30.770]  but when it comes to quantifying, to counting,
[02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:34.530]  like really I have X amount of bacteria to fungi,
[02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:37.970]  it's not the best tool.
[02:29:37.970 --> 02:29:38.810]  For sure.
[02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:43.570]  An example, when I was studying microscopy down at Rodale,
[02:29:43.570 --> 02:29:45.810]  Elaine had all these students that she had brought in
[02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:46.930]  from all over the country.
[02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:50.970]  The brightest, youngest minds to be her protégés.
[02:29:50.970 --> 02:29:55.970]  And so I would notice that if this girl had broken up
[02:29:56.010 --> 02:29:59.250]  with her boyfriend the night before,
[02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:01.850]  she wasn't seeing as much good things
[02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:05.730]  as perhaps the day before when everything was great.
[02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:08.210]  I noticed when they were hungover,
[02:30:08.210 --> 02:30:09.690]  they didn't see anything good.
[02:30:09.690 --> 02:30:12.650]  And trust me, because I was the idiot.
[02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:13.890]  I was trying to learn.
[02:30:13.930 --> 02:30:17.010]  Because I was the idiot, I was trying to learn.
[02:30:17.010 --> 02:30:20.010]  I was asking hard questions and whatever they looked at,
[02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:21.210]  I would look at it too.
[02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:24.410]  Just to understand what I was looking at.
[02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:25.250]  Trying to-
[02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:26.090]  For sure.
[02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:26.930]  Right?
[02:30:26.930 --> 02:30:31.930]  So I learned that the emotions, the mood of the person,
[02:30:32.530 --> 02:30:36.410]  changed the results that they put down
[02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:38.210]  on that piece of paper.
[02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:42.050]  And from there, I learned to meditate
[02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:46.530]  or to clear my mind before I go behind the microscope.
[02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:47.690]  Kind of like what you talked about,
[02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:49.690]  clearing yourself before you go in the room.
[02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:52.250]  You don't want to bring negative energy in there.
[02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:55.930]  You want to be in a stasis with the environment
[02:30:55.930 --> 02:30:56.770]  and the plants.
[02:30:56.770 --> 02:30:58.610]  Fully involved with what you're doing.
[02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:59.930]  Yeah, right.
[02:30:59.930 --> 02:31:02.330]  Totally connected with what you're doing.
[02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:04.690]  So when I teach microscope classes,
[02:31:04.690 --> 02:31:07.050]  which I actually do quite a bit now,
[02:31:07.890 --> 02:31:09.570]  that's one of the things I tell the people.
[02:31:09.610 --> 02:31:11.570]  I'm like, look, once you get comfortable
[02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:14.090]  with learning how to use the tool,
[02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:15.010]  once we get through that,
[02:31:15.010 --> 02:31:17.890]  and once you've learned how to identify the organisms,
[02:31:17.890 --> 02:31:20.890]  then one of the things we're going to really dig down
[02:31:20.890 --> 02:31:23.410]  or drill down on is clearing your mind
[02:31:23.410 --> 02:31:25.730]  and getting into the proper headspace.
[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:27.970]  Don't use your microscope with a hangover.
[02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:32.570]  Don't use it if you're pissed off or angry or frustrated
[02:31:32.570 --> 02:31:33.930]  or too high.
[02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:38.690]  You're not going to get what you really need
[02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:41.610]  from the information that you're looking at.
[02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:44.170]  So, again, I was so glad that you talked
[02:31:44.170 --> 02:31:47.450]  about clearing yourself and preparing yourself mentally
[02:31:47.450 --> 02:31:49.290]  before going in and dealing with your girls
[02:31:49.290 --> 02:31:51.810]  because it's so important.
[02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:53.050]  It's that energy.
[02:31:53.050 --> 02:31:53.890]  Absolutely.
[02:31:53.890 --> 02:31:55.810]  That vibration, so important.
[02:31:56.890 --> 02:31:59.130]  Yeah, energy exchange on every level.
[02:32:00.330 --> 02:32:02.250]  All that stuff going on in the soil
[02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:04.250]  is energy exchange as well.
[02:32:04.290 --> 02:32:08.770]  You know, vibrational beings in a vibrational realm.
[02:32:10.130 --> 02:32:10.970]  Amen.
[02:32:10.970 --> 02:32:12.410]  Put on a high frequency, man.
[02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:16.370]  Learn this, eat some mushrooms.
[02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:17.210]  Yes.
[02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:23.010]  Brian, you got anything to add to that, brother?
[02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:25.450]  No, I mean, like I said, man,
[02:32:25.450 --> 02:32:27.730]  having Leighton on the show just kind of allows it
[02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:31.330]  to go on a whole nother level than I feel like
[02:32:31.330 --> 02:32:33.330]  maybe even discussions that I have with other people.
[02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:36.970]  We just aren't able to go on in such a deep understanding.
[02:32:36.970 --> 02:32:38.210]  The main thing, I guess, Leighton,
[02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:40.850]  is I want the viewers to see that like,
[02:32:42.170 --> 02:32:44.090]  Dr. Laningham, yourself, other people
[02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:46.130]  have been talking about this for a long time.
[02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:49.130]  And I feel like it's just maybe been these last few years
[02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:51.570]  where it's the cannabis farmers that seem like
[02:32:51.570 --> 02:32:53.330]  they're out in front or certain,
[02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:55.490]  some cannabis farmers are out in front being like,
[02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:58.930]  yes, this is, or at least this is the lane
[02:32:58.930 --> 02:32:59.930]  that I want to be in.
[02:32:59.930 --> 02:33:01.650]  I want to drive down this main lane.
[02:33:01.650 --> 02:33:03.210]  Maybe I divert on some things,
[02:33:04.090 --> 02:33:06.370]  but I want to, if especially in a larger facility,
[02:33:06.370 --> 02:33:09.130]  I want to hedge my bets on mother nature,
[02:33:09.130 --> 02:33:14.130]  not on the sole focus of like a team that's all synthetics.
[02:33:15.810 --> 02:33:16.770]  Like you had just mentioned,
[02:33:16.770 --> 02:33:20.010]  when people aren't vibing together, there's a friction.
[02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:23.050]  I've personally seen, especially in hydroponic systems
[02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:27.050]  as well as living soil systems,
[02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:28.810]  but it seems like there's just more, a lot more,
[02:33:28.810 --> 02:33:31.690]  if you will, ego in the synthetic world.
[02:33:31.690 --> 02:33:33.610]  If they don't want to share things,
[02:33:33.610 --> 02:33:36.010]  then there's maybe that assistant head grower
[02:33:36.010 --> 02:33:37.610]  that wants to understand some stuff.
[02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:38.850]  I've personally seen that as well,
[02:33:38.850 --> 02:33:41.130]  where it's like this person just wanted to learn more
[02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:43.690]  so that they themselves could continue
[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:46.130]  to manage the facility as best they could.
[02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:49.130]  But that head grower just didn't want to,
[02:33:49.130 --> 02:33:50.890]  potentially, I guess, give them that road
[02:33:50.890 --> 02:33:54.610]  where he could one-up him and maybe become the head grower.
[02:33:54.610 --> 02:33:56.970]  Because the work ethic was definitely
[02:33:56.970 --> 02:33:58.370]  on the assistant head grower.
[02:33:58.370 --> 02:34:00.010]  And I feel like all of us little peons,
[02:34:00.010 --> 02:34:03.490]  trimmers and waterboys and stuff at the time, we saw that.
[02:34:03.490 --> 02:34:06.290]  And it really is the living soil crowd
[02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:08.970]  that I feel like is sharing a lot of this stuff.
[02:34:08.970 --> 02:34:12.090]  And so I hope that more of the synthetic world,
[02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:14.450]  if you guys want to chop it up or debate
[02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:16.450]  and that kind of stuff, a lot of those times
[02:34:16.450 --> 02:34:19.050]  we kind of give you guys those olive branches
[02:34:19.050 --> 02:34:20.650]  and they don't want to discuss that stuff
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:21.490]  because they don't want to talk
[02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:22.850]  about the way that they farm.
[02:34:22.850 --> 02:34:23.970]  They're happy with it.
[02:34:23.970 --> 02:34:25.650]  And I totally get that part too,
[02:34:25.650 --> 02:34:27.930]  but I really like open discussion.
[02:34:27.930 --> 02:34:29.050]  I like open forums.
[02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:32.410]  I feel like if, especially on educational side of things,
[02:34:32.410 --> 02:34:34.650]  when it's coming to mother nature,
[02:34:34.650 --> 02:34:37.010]  what is the real harm in educating someone else
[02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:38.450]  so that their farm's a little bit better?
[02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:41.890]  If you're drastically higher on your cycles,
[02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:44.170]  like the Cantwells, the Steenslands,
[02:34:45.250 --> 02:34:46.970]  there's no way that the newer people
[02:34:46.970 --> 02:34:47.930]  are going to catch up with you.
[02:34:47.930 --> 02:34:50.130]  And I feel like that's something that we need to continue
[02:34:50.130 --> 02:34:52.730]  to let people know that sharing this stuff.
[02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:55.090]  And if you're dialed in, a lot of these people
[02:34:55.090 --> 02:34:57.690]  aren't even going to do this for another year or two.
[02:34:57.690 --> 02:34:59.170]  That's something else that I feel like I've learned,
[02:34:59.170 --> 02:35:02.090]  especially with doing more of the classes here in Denver,
[02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:06.090]  like in 2017, 2018, everybody was gung ho, man.
[02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:08.170]  And then you'd see them up at the next kind of meetup
[02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:09.770]  and you'd be like, all right, you got your worm bin yet?
[02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:11.010]  Or your worm farm?
[02:35:11.010 --> 02:35:12.730]  Oh, I haven't had time to really get into
[02:35:12.730 --> 02:35:13.730]  any of that stuff yet.
[02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:16.130]  So like you had mentioned Chandler,
[02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:19.010]  the other part of this is to just do it,
[02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:20.290]  to get the experience.
[02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:22.650]  And yes, there's issues,
[02:35:22.650 --> 02:35:25.570]  but I don't want a latent story to deter you
[02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:28.130]  from the worms escaping all the time.
[02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:30.010]  Because that's what everybody says.
[02:35:30.010 --> 02:35:31.530]  As soon as I start talking worm farming,
[02:35:31.530 --> 02:35:32.810]  they're like, yeah, but I don't want bugs
[02:35:32.810 --> 02:35:34.170]  and worms all over my house.
[02:35:34.170 --> 02:35:36.890]  That's almost verbatim what they tell me.
[02:35:36.890 --> 02:35:40.450]  I had that big old worm tower 360, I think it's called,
[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:42.130]  just a stack of worm bins.
[02:35:42.130 --> 02:35:45.530]  And I put that inside of a cardboard box,
[02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:46.890]  a bigger cardboard box.
[02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:49.530]  So like if they did get out anywhere,
[02:35:49.530 --> 02:35:50.730]  they're not going anywhere.
[02:35:50.730 --> 02:35:52.530]  Because it's a common sense, man.
[02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:54.170]  Just use your common sense.
[02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:56.890]  I feel like plastic also causes a lot more issues
[02:35:56.890 --> 02:35:58.050]  than if you're using,
[02:35:58.050 --> 02:36:00.170]  there's this thing called the worm in,
[02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:02.490]  that you can kind of like put your scraps in at the top.
[02:36:02.490 --> 02:36:03.770]  The big bag type thing.
[02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:04.610]  Yeah.
[02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:06.650]  I feel like that's a better choice
[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:09.370]  if you do have small space.
[02:36:09.370 --> 02:36:11.970]  But again, if you're really trying to do this,
[02:36:11.970 --> 02:36:14.970]  you need a cover crop, you need a hundred gallon fabric pot.
[02:36:14.970 --> 02:36:16.810]  And again, my opinion,
[02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:18.930]  I would do it with the lava rock at the bottom.
[02:36:18.930 --> 02:36:22.090]  So it just seems like it's there to stay kind of thing.
[02:36:22.090 --> 02:36:23.570]  And then you had mentioned the biochar,
[02:36:24.410 --> 02:36:25.570]  as far as I understand, Layton,
[02:36:25.570 --> 02:36:27.090]  that's a forever carbon as well.
[02:36:27.090 --> 02:36:30.090]  Cause I don't think that's gonna truly break down
[02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:32.570]  in our lifetime, adding that to our soil system.
[02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:37.570]  So it's a little sprinkle of that really goes a long way.
[02:36:37.610 --> 02:36:38.450]  Definitely.
[02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:41.490]  Yeah. If you go over 20%,
[02:36:41.490 --> 02:36:43.650]  you will technically shut your soil down
[02:36:43.650 --> 02:36:46.050]  because the microbes are just hanging out on the carbon.
[02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:49.290]  Why would they interact with the plant or anything else?
[02:36:49.290 --> 02:36:51.570]  They're happy to just set up,
[02:36:51.570 --> 02:36:53.210]  living their life on that little chunk.
[02:36:54.170 --> 02:36:55.450]  I love the stuff.
[02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:59.970]  I'm scared when I hear of large producers
[02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:03.410]  because the amount of CO2 they're releasing to make it
[02:37:03.410 --> 02:37:08.410]  is, it's kind of like trucking shit across the world.
[02:37:09.010 --> 02:37:11.970]  We need to be more localized and specialized
[02:37:11.970 --> 02:37:13.330]  and not centralized.
[02:37:14.290 --> 02:37:15.570]  That's a whole nother issue.
[02:37:15.570 --> 02:37:19.170]  But Brian, I think you're right in a lot of ways
[02:37:19.170 --> 02:37:24.010]  that cannabis has really taken the helm
[02:37:24.010 --> 02:37:29.010]  and charged ahead, way ahead of all other types of growing.
[02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:34.930]  And it's sad, but in the very first regenerative conference
[02:37:36.330 --> 02:37:38.770]  I did a talk at that I co-hosted,
[02:37:38.770 --> 02:37:42.210]  I said to the crew or to the crowd,
[02:37:42.210 --> 02:37:47.210]  I'm like, cannabis has the potential to be the vehicle
[02:37:48.210 --> 02:37:51.450]  to wake up big ag and to wake up everybody
[02:37:51.450 --> 02:37:54.050]  as to how best to grow it.
[02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:56.370]  You guys for years, you talked earlier
[02:37:56.370 --> 02:37:57.890]  about cooking soils, right?
[02:37:57.890 --> 02:38:01.930]  Well, the old timers in the 70s cooked their soil,
[02:38:01.930 --> 02:38:05.010]  but then they would add in compost teas and extracts
[02:38:05.010 --> 02:38:07.210]  to get the microbial life up.
[02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:10.890]  So they would supercharge this ionic,
[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:12.930]  using organic nutrients,
[02:38:12.930 --> 02:38:15.530]  breaking them down through the heat process,
[02:38:15.570 --> 02:38:17.250]  and then letting it chill out,
[02:38:17.250 --> 02:38:19.890]  putting it in their pots as a soilless medium,
[02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:23.410]  and then nuking, well, it would be considered
[02:38:23.410 --> 02:38:25.090]  a super soil at that point.
[02:38:25.090 --> 02:38:28.490]  But then nuking it with the biology and letting it go crazy.
[02:38:28.490 --> 02:38:32.010]  And they saw the incredible effects of this stuff.
[02:38:32.010 --> 02:38:35.810]  And then of course, the camp and the dark days
[02:38:35.810 --> 02:38:37.890]  of the war on drugs kicked in,
[02:38:37.890 --> 02:38:40.130]  and the hippies had to come out of the forest
[02:38:40.130 --> 02:38:43.410]  and dig holes and put shipping containers underground
[02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:45.890]  and use diesel generators to grow them.
[02:38:45.890 --> 02:38:47.570]  And they couldn't do the same things
[02:38:47.570 --> 02:38:48.810]  that they were doing outside.
[02:38:48.810 --> 02:38:51.650]  So they were kind of led into that nutrient,
[02:38:51.650 --> 02:38:54.690]  well, how can we make the nutrients easier for us to use?
[02:38:54.690 --> 02:38:57.050]  And we don't have to wait and make these teas.
[02:38:57.050 --> 02:39:00.250]  And that fueled that whole synthetic,
[02:39:00.250 --> 02:39:04.250]  let's copy ag, let's go down the ag rabbit hole.
[02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:06.250]  We all know where that rabbit hole went
[02:39:06.250 --> 02:39:07.890]  and is continuing to go.
[02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:12.450]  But no, I've always believed that the cannabis industry,
[02:39:12.490 --> 02:39:15.450]  because they care about their plants,
[02:39:15.450 --> 02:39:16.890]  they love their plants,
[02:39:16.890 --> 02:39:20.010]  they want to give their plants the best.
[02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:22.490]  They will be the drivers that wake up
[02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:25.930]  the rest of the population as to what is the right way.
[02:39:25.930 --> 02:39:29.330]  And the scariest thing to this whole puzzle is that
[02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:32.410]  down here in SoCal, everybody's a salt farmer
[02:39:32.410 --> 02:39:36.330]  and the weed sucks and everybody knows it.
[02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:38.490]  And they laugh about it.
[02:39:38.490 --> 02:39:41.530]  And it's like, you guys are blowing shit tons of money
[02:39:41.610 --> 02:39:42.850]  on bottled nudes.
[02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:45.970]  And if you just put in a living soil system,
[02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:51.530]  your input costs would crash.
[02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:53.250]  You would be spending nothing.
[02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:54.930]  Your labor would go down.
[02:39:54.930 --> 02:39:58.890]  Your battles with pests would go way down.
[02:39:58.890 --> 02:40:00.890]  But why won't you go down there?
[02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:02.570]  Why won't you try this?
[02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:05.770]  Even just dedicate a room, a corner, try it.
[02:40:05.770 --> 02:40:08.290]  I can prove to you how much better it is.
[02:40:08.290 --> 02:40:09.130]  But-
[02:40:09.130 --> 02:40:10.050]  Back up your mothers.
[02:40:10.050 --> 02:40:11.450]  Yeah, but for whatever reason,
[02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:13.970]  it rolls back to what Brian said.
[02:40:13.970 --> 02:40:17.490]  The head grower doesn't want to teach the little guy
[02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:21.370]  how to do it because he's fearful of losing his job.
[02:40:21.370 --> 02:40:22.970]  To be honest with you,
[02:40:22.970 --> 02:40:25.050]  that's because they're driven by ego.
[02:40:25.050 --> 02:40:28.410]  Because they're using these formulas that are mathematical
[02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:30.570]  or EC or pH.
[02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:32.330]  They're using these simple things that are like
[02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:34.290]  one plus one equals two.
[02:40:34.290 --> 02:40:36.010]  Where living soil people go,
[02:40:38.050 --> 02:40:39.970]  anything can happen.
[02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:43.250]  And if one plus one equals two,
[02:40:43.250 --> 02:40:44.810]  this is like how cool,
[02:40:44.810 --> 02:40:48.290]  how far can I take this into a living ecosystem?
[02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:52.050]  It's not about me and my one plus one knowledge.
[02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:54.290]  It's about, holy fuck, man.
[02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:55.610]  I want more bugs.
[02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:56.770]  I want more worms.
[02:40:56.770 --> 02:40:58.570]  I want more biology.
[02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:00.970]  So we all work together in unison
[02:41:00.970 --> 02:41:03.770]  because we understand we don't know everything.
[02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:06.170]  We understand we're just starting this journey.
[02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:07.890]  We're learning.
[02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:11.410]  We're not directing or we're not controlling.
[02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:12.250]  We're learning.
[02:41:12.250 --> 02:41:14.650]  And that's the difference between that head grower
[02:41:14.650 --> 02:41:18.250]  who's controlling and the living soil crew
[02:41:18.250 --> 02:41:21.090]  who are all like, well, I tried this and it didn't work.
[02:41:21.090 --> 02:41:23.970]  Or I tried this and it worked really well.
[02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:27.210]  And again, I think you said it earlier best, Brian,
[02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:29.890]  is that you can get a gold nugget
[02:41:29.890 --> 02:41:32.850]  from all these different techniques and styles.
[02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:35.370]  You don't have to listen to everything they say.
[02:41:35.370 --> 02:41:38.610]  You don't have to drink the Kool-Aid and follow them
[02:41:38.610 --> 02:41:41.690]  and do exactly the way they do it.
[02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:43.610]  But you can take certain stuff
[02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:46.930]  from all these different people and make it your own.
[02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:49.610]  Try it and maybe go back to them and say,
[02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:53.330]  hey, I did what you said to do it and I learned all of this,
[02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:55.930]  but then I tried adding this and guess what?
[02:41:55.930 --> 02:41:57.250]  It made it even better.
[02:41:57.250 --> 02:41:58.970]  Now you're sharing back with them
[02:41:58.970 --> 02:42:01.130]  the things that they shared with you.
[02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:04.010]  That's the difference between living soil crew
[02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:07.130]  or community versus the salt growers
[02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:09.650]  who have to control everything.
[02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:13.250]  It makes a lot of sense for sure.
[02:42:13.250 --> 02:42:14.090]  Good point.
[02:42:14.970 --> 02:42:16.490]  Sadly, a lot of the ones,
[02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:20.210]  it's really kind of more a certain type of grower,
[02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:25.210]  but they don't even really understand the plant itself.
[02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:28.210]  Somebody taught them their methods like you had mentioned.
[02:42:28.210 --> 02:42:30.090]  And so they know certain brand names
[02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:31.130]  and they don't wanna reveal
[02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:33.930]  what brand name product they're using
[02:42:34.850 --> 02:42:37.290]  because then they feel like that's gonna create competition
[02:42:37.290 --> 02:42:39.170]  or like you had said, maybe lose a job
[02:42:39.170 --> 02:42:40.450]  or something like that.
[02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:42.410]  And that's really the beauty of living soil
[02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:45.210]  is it's not like there's this one brand
[02:42:45.210 --> 02:42:46.890]  that everybody has to use
[02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:50.450]  to be able to cultivate cannabis on that level.
[02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:53.290]  And it was the old ag companies,
[02:42:53.290 --> 02:42:54.570]  especially big ag companies
[02:42:54.570 --> 02:42:55.770]  that seemed like they would create
[02:42:55.770 --> 02:42:58.050]  these little subsections for cannabis
[02:42:58.050 --> 02:43:00.170]  and they would give us these nice little booklets.
[02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:02.450]  And then it would say like week one, week two, week three,
[02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:03.770]  oh, hey, now it's flower.
[02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:05.930]  Now we got to switch up all these different things.
[02:43:05.930 --> 02:43:07.090]  And that was something that
[02:43:07.090 --> 02:43:08.530]  when I was first getting into this,
[02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:10.090]  it seemed like, wow, okay.
[02:43:10.090 --> 02:43:13.450]  With a living soil system, it's just constantly improving.
[02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:18.010]  I don't necessarily have to feed a specific thing
[02:43:18.010 --> 02:43:19.810]  in a living soil system on week two
[02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:22.410]  to be able to get to week three, week four, week five.
[02:43:22.410 --> 02:43:25.610]  As long as I just focus on improving the overall system,
[02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:27.210]  it takes care of itself.
[02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:29.010]  And that's what I still to this day,
[02:43:29.010 --> 02:43:31.970]  I don't feel like a lot of the newer cannabis farmers get.
[02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:33.850]  With the living soil stuff
[02:43:33.850 --> 02:43:35.570]  and maybe why they're hesitant to it
[02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:37.970]  is they just can't really comprehend
[02:43:37.970 --> 02:43:39.450]  if they've been kind of taught
[02:43:39.450 --> 02:43:43.690]  from more of the agricultural world of things.
[02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:45.850]  And that's kind of how they were first introduced
[02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:46.690]  into cannabis.
[02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:48.130]  It's hard for them to make the leap of,
[02:43:48.130 --> 02:43:50.410]  you can reuse your soil and all that kind of stuff.
[02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:52.570]  Cause I feel like those guys are always harping
[02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:56.810]  about how great, it's not carbon fiber.
[02:43:56.810 --> 02:43:59.930]  What's the stuff, the greenish stuff
[02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:01.330]  that always has algae on it
[02:44:01.370 --> 02:44:03.490]  that we use in hydroponic farming?
[02:44:03.490 --> 02:44:04.890]  Hydroton?
[02:44:04.890 --> 02:44:09.410]  No, it's the, it's spun with like,
[02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:11.570]  oh my God, I can't believe I can't think of this.
[02:44:11.570 --> 02:44:15.730]  It's like the worst stuff to use.
[02:44:15.730 --> 02:44:17.850]  I'm sure somebody in the audience might be able to.
[02:44:17.850 --> 02:44:18.690]  Rockwool?
[02:44:18.690 --> 02:44:20.210]  Rockwool, there we go.
[02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:23.210]  Yeah, I feel like there's still to this day,
[02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:26.450]  I was talking to a few people that were talking about
[02:44:26.450 --> 02:44:28.890]  how there's still people coming into his shop
[02:44:28.890 --> 02:44:29.970]  asking for Rockwool
[02:44:29.970 --> 02:44:33.410]  and talking about like aqua flakes
[02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:35.010]  and things that I feel like,
[02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:39.010]  it's almost like walking into like maybe a Best Buy
[02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:41.650]  and asking them where the CD section is.
[02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:43.570]  Like nobody does that anymore, man.
[02:44:44.810 --> 02:44:47.130]  So education still needs to get out there.
[02:44:47.130 --> 02:44:49.290]  I feel like regardless of where it's at,
[02:44:49.290 --> 02:44:50.930]  there's still people here in Colorado
[02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:52.810]  that are in my opinion,
[02:44:52.810 --> 02:44:55.570]  growing with 80s belief systems,
[02:44:55.570 --> 02:44:58.250]  early 90s belief systems on like,
[02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:59.770]  the hip hop crowd was big into like,
[02:45:00.570 --> 02:45:01.730]  oh, it's hydro man.
[02:45:01.730 --> 02:45:03.970]  And now I feel like it's kind of flipped.
[02:45:03.970 --> 02:45:05.930]  Living soil is more of that,
[02:45:05.930 --> 02:45:07.490]  especially with the colors.
[02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:08.690]  Shout out to Mountain Organics.
[02:45:08.690 --> 02:45:09.730]  I don't know if you guys saw,
[02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:12.490]  he posted this photo like five years ago
[02:45:12.490 --> 02:45:14.770]  and it's like this pink purplish bud.
[02:45:14.770 --> 02:45:19.330]  And I had never seen cannabis that I felt like was real.
[02:45:19.330 --> 02:45:20.970]  I felt like maybe I've seen pink cannabis,
[02:45:20.970 --> 02:45:22.850]  especially then that might've been Photoshopped
[02:45:22.850 --> 02:45:25.530]  because it just had like this weird pink to it,
[02:45:25.530 --> 02:45:27.450]  especially on like a mass roots
[02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:29.330]  and some of these more like kind of,
[02:45:29.850 --> 02:45:31.370]  I don't know, just people on there
[02:45:31.370 --> 02:45:32.690]  weren't always being authentic.
[02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:34.730]  I feel like where Instagram people call you out
[02:45:34.730 --> 02:45:36.530]  for stuff immediately.
[02:45:36.530 --> 02:45:39.090]  And anyway, so Mountain Organics post this photo
[02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:40.970]  probably like five, six years ago.
[02:45:40.970 --> 02:45:43.650]  And I feel like that's when it turned on to me
[02:45:43.650 --> 02:45:45.930]  is like this guy is obviously on a whole nother level here
[02:45:45.930 --> 02:45:48.810]  if he's achieving these colors and that kind of stuff.
[02:45:48.810 --> 02:45:51.290]  And then he was honest to me when I was,
[02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:52.450]  when I reached out to him, he's like,
[02:45:52.450 --> 02:45:54.250]  yeah, but it just doesn't smoke.
[02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:57.770]  And I feel like that's the conundrum for us
[02:45:57.810 --> 02:45:59.570]  that are really trying to move forward with this
[02:45:59.570 --> 02:46:01.810]  is finding the stuff that really sticks out
[02:46:01.810 --> 02:46:03.330]  so that people wanna go out of their way
[02:46:03.330 --> 02:46:04.250]  to buy your cannabis.
[02:46:04.250 --> 02:46:06.330]  It's just gorgeous, has all the trichomes,
[02:46:06.330 --> 02:46:08.610]  everything that a connoisseur would want,
[02:46:08.610 --> 02:46:10.410]  but then it punches you in the face.
[02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:13.090]  And it seems like the colorful cannabis,
[02:46:13.090 --> 02:46:15.890]  the stuff that really is like, wow,
[02:46:15.890 --> 02:46:19.810]  when you're walking through admiring somebody's work,
[02:46:19.810 --> 02:46:21.170]  it just doesn't have that punch.
[02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:23.690]  So if there's people out there that understand genetics
[02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:24.770]  on a different level than us,
[02:46:24.770 --> 02:46:27.010]  I would love to know what kind of is sticking out
[02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:29.290]  for you guys genetics wise,
[02:46:29.290 --> 02:46:31.970]  that seems to have the color and the punch.
[02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:34.570]  I think it was purple punch from you boys
[02:46:34.570 --> 02:46:36.130]  out in California late in where everybody
[02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:37.770]  was talking about that.
[02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:39.570]  And then it just never delivered.
[02:46:39.570 --> 02:46:41.970]  No, it had the purple, never had the punch.
[02:46:41.970 --> 02:46:44.530]  It didn't punch, that's for sure.
[02:46:44.530 --> 02:46:47.130]  But let me just back it up a little bit
[02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:49.450]  because you did, you brought up a very good point.
[02:46:49.450 --> 02:46:51.930]  And that is that people have to understand
[02:46:51.930 --> 02:46:56.370]  in a living soil system that everything is already there.
[02:46:56.370 --> 02:46:59.370]  And the plant is steering it, not you.
[02:46:59.370 --> 02:47:03.010]  So when the plant decides it wants more phosphate,
[02:47:03.010 --> 02:47:06.370]  it will grow out the phosphate solubilizing bacteria
[02:47:06.370 --> 02:47:07.570]  through its exudates.
[02:47:07.570 --> 02:47:10.130]  So it'll feed that population.
[02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:12.850]  That population will expand and grow out,
[02:47:12.850 --> 02:47:17.050]  consume the phosphate and release it back plant available
[02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:19.490]  through the nutrient cycling system
[02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:22.490]  or through the mycorrhizae,
[02:47:22.490 --> 02:47:25.930]  if you're lucky enough to be in raised beds and have it.
[02:47:26.490 --> 02:47:27.330]  And a horizontal soil system,
[02:47:27.330 --> 02:47:29.610]  because if you don't have the sand, silt and clay
[02:47:29.610 --> 02:47:33.290]  for the mycorrhizae to mine, don't buy it.
[02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:35.130]  You're throwing your money away.
[02:47:35.130 --> 02:47:38.650]  So again, it's like letting go of control.
[02:47:38.650 --> 02:47:41.690]  And in a synthetic world, it's all about control
[02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:44.930]  where in living soils, it's letting go of control
[02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:46.570]  and letting the plant do the work
[02:47:46.570 --> 02:47:49.690]  and just making sure being a steward of the plant.
[02:47:49.690 --> 02:47:52.490]  And I think that's a big problem for humans
[02:47:52.490 --> 02:47:54.090]  is to let go of control.
[02:47:54.090 --> 02:47:58.050]  We've all been programmed that we need to control our kids,
[02:47:58.050 --> 02:48:01.690]  control our parents, control our lovers or partners.
[02:48:01.690 --> 02:48:05.170]  And that's the negative side of humanity.
[02:48:05.170 --> 02:48:07.850]  The other side is to love them, nourish them,
[02:48:07.850 --> 02:48:10.410]  let them make mistakes, let them grow.
[02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:13.730]  Don't hold them, don't stifle them.
[02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:15.250]  And so that's the big difference
[02:48:15.250 --> 02:48:17.610]  between those two growing methodologies
[02:48:17.610 --> 02:48:20.130]  is that one is control and the other is letting go
[02:48:20.130 --> 02:48:21.930]  of control, which is even scarier.
[02:48:22.050 --> 02:48:24.530]  For real, that's another great point.
[02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:27.730]  I think a lot of it is like this regenerative
[02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:30.730]  and obviously we can't generalize either group,
[02:48:30.730 --> 02:48:35.250]  but we're focused on things that are way over ourselves
[02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:37.650]  and our profits and everything.
[02:48:37.650 --> 02:48:40.530]  We're regenerating soils for future generations
[02:48:40.530 --> 02:48:44.730]  and we're trying to be self-sustainable from a system
[02:48:44.730 --> 02:48:47.970]  that if you're reliant on feeding your plants
[02:48:47.970 --> 02:48:51.330]  from the bottles, you're absolutely gonna die.
[02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:53.210]  You're absolutely a slave to the system.
[02:48:53.210 --> 02:48:55.490]  But if you can create your own fertilizers,
[02:48:56.810 --> 02:49:01.730]  that is rebellion and that is self-stability
[02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:03.210]  and all that stuff.
[02:49:03.210 --> 02:49:05.170]  So I think it's like a lot of us
[02:49:05.170 --> 02:49:07.050]  with this regenerative mindset,
[02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:10.730]  it's just so much bigger than just growing weed
[02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:11.570]  to make money.
[02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:15.210]  And that's a whole lifestyle.
[02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:18.250]  It's definitely become a whole lifestyle.
[02:49:19.450 --> 02:49:21.570]  The brands like cookie brands and stuff
[02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:23.530]  where they can sell hoodies for $300
[02:49:23.530 --> 02:49:26.130]  and people gladly pay for it.
[02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:28.450]  And the real behind the curtains thing
[02:49:28.450 --> 02:49:31.570]  is that cookies comes into places, cities,
[02:49:31.570 --> 02:49:34.810]  finds sometimes maybe even mom and pop shops,
[02:49:35.730 --> 02:49:38.130]  networks with them and basically then takes
[02:49:39.210 --> 02:49:41.930]  kind of the authenticity of that brand
[02:49:41.930 --> 02:49:44.090]  and then just puts the cookies back in the market.
[02:49:44.130 --> 02:49:44.970]  And then it's just a brand
[02:49:44.970 --> 02:49:46.450]  and then just puts the cookies brand over it.
[02:49:46.450 --> 02:49:47.810]  And so for a lot of you out there
[02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:50.090]  that are constantly talking about cookies,
[02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:52.730]  I wish that you knew that it's just white labeled
[02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:54.290]  bud in your city.
[02:49:54.290 --> 02:49:56.370]  It's just, they came and they found out
[02:49:56.370 --> 02:49:58.690]  who some of the best growers are in that town.
[02:49:58.690 --> 02:50:00.290]  They struck deals with them
[02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:02.210]  and then they white label that shit.
[02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:03.650]  And I'm sure there's a bunch of other brands
[02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:06.570]  that do it as well, just not as successfully as them.
[02:50:06.570 --> 02:50:09.450]  So I encourage, we've talked about this a few times late
[02:50:09.450 --> 02:50:12.610]  and where the community can speak with their dollars.
[02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:15.410]  So if you guys are going out of your way to cultivate
[02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:17.010]  or you're going out of your way to make sure
[02:50:17.010 --> 02:50:19.210]  that you're choosing to buy cannabis
[02:50:19.210 --> 02:50:21.050]  that's grown organically,
[02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:23.210]  especially if you view this as medicine,
[02:50:23.210 --> 02:50:25.850]  I feel like the easiest analogy is that
[02:50:25.850 --> 02:50:29.130]  you would never buy sushi at the gas station at 7-Eleven,
[02:50:29.130 --> 02:50:30.970]  even though I see it there.
[02:50:30.970 --> 02:50:34.210]  So there's just a lot of things I feel like paying
[02:50:34.210 --> 02:50:38.170]  for quality, understanding quality and feeling better.
[02:50:38.170 --> 02:50:40.650]  Because I know when I first was buying cannabis
[02:50:40.650 --> 02:50:42.850]  here in Colorado from a dispensary,
[02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:44.650]  all of a sudden I started getting headaches
[02:50:44.650 --> 02:50:48.170]  and I imagine it was because they were spraying Eagle 20.
[02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:49.010]  Shit's fucked.
[02:50:50.290 --> 02:50:52.130]  I love that analogy.
[02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:55.010]  Don't buy sushi at the gas station.
[02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:56.450]  I mean, I see it there, but.
[02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:58.650]  Who's the same with any quality product
[02:50:58.650 --> 02:50:59.850]  versus a bulk product?
[02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:02.370]  It's the craft versus bulk market.
[02:51:02.370 --> 02:51:05.290]  It's like craft is always going to be,
[02:51:05.290 --> 02:51:07.410]  it's always going to speak for itself.
[02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:10.370]  I'm like, you can't generalize anything.
[02:51:11.050 --> 02:51:13.490]  The nutrient density of the vegetables,
[02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:15.530]  the quality of ganja,
[02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:18.130]  it all comes down to farming practices.
[02:51:18.130 --> 02:51:22.170]  Especially, it's not the cow, it's the how.
[02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:26.970]  That whole debate of cows sequestering carbon
[02:51:26.970 --> 02:51:29.090]  or the methane and stuff.
[02:51:30.290 --> 02:51:35.290]  Yeah, cows on a feedlot are going to produce methane,
[02:51:35.650 --> 02:51:37.810]  but cows on a pasture,
[02:51:38.050 --> 02:51:41.090]  it's going to outweigh
[02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:43.690]  because of how much carbon they're sequestering and stuff.
[02:51:43.690 --> 02:51:47.490]  It's like, we can't generalize any of these techniques.
[02:51:47.490 --> 02:51:51.010]  And I think I got a bit of a tangent there, I don't know.
[02:51:51.010 --> 02:51:52.050]  No, I love it, brother.
[02:51:52.050 --> 02:51:52.890]  I love it.
[02:51:52.890 --> 02:51:57.690]  And yeah, I was on a conference call this morning
[02:51:57.690 --> 02:52:00.410]  before I had to actually jump off of it.
[02:52:00.410 --> 02:52:01.810]  It was a really important one
[02:52:01.810 --> 02:52:06.810]  on understanding carbon in urban and suburban.
[02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:12.850]  Systems and how the carbon that's being stored
[02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:17.090]  is being burned up at a rate of like once a year.
[02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:20.810]  It's so you have X amount of tons and it's gone in a year
[02:52:20.810 --> 02:52:23.810]  where in a natural system, a forest,
[02:52:23.810 --> 02:52:26.290]  it's going to be there for hundreds of years.
[02:52:26.290 --> 02:52:30.490]  And it's all due to microbes, heat, lack of moisture.
[02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:34.610]  Again, this goes back to some of the early work I did
[02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:36.050]  on engineered soils.
[02:52:36.090 --> 02:52:39.890]  That if you're feeding an engineered soil,
[02:52:39.890 --> 02:52:42.890]  an ammoniacal form of nitrogen,
[02:52:42.890 --> 02:52:44.730]  you're going to need more water.
[02:52:44.730 --> 02:52:48.530]  And if you're feeding it a nitrite form of nitrogen,
[02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:50.410]  then you're going to need more carbon
[02:52:50.410 --> 02:52:52.050]  because it's going to use the carbon
[02:52:52.050 --> 02:52:54.330]  to break down that nitrogen
[02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:56.410]  to release it back to the plant.
[02:52:56.410 --> 02:53:01.410]  So you're going in a degregating downward spiral
[02:53:01.730 --> 02:53:03.490]  in these urban environments.
[02:53:03.490 --> 02:53:06.530]  Doesn't the plant take nitrate nitrogen
[02:53:06.530 --> 02:53:08.770]  whether she should be or not?
[02:53:08.770 --> 02:53:11.210]  I mean, she loves it so much.
[02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:12.690]  So that's the fallacy.
[02:53:12.690 --> 02:53:17.530]  Like that is the foundation of the chemical industry
[02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:19.450]  is that the plant is eating it.
[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:20.610]  It's not.
[02:53:20.610 --> 02:53:23.250]  The bacteria still has to break that shit down
[02:53:23.250 --> 02:53:25.010]  and make it plant available.
[02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:27.210]  And there will always be bacteria.
[02:53:27.210 --> 02:53:29.410]  And bacteria loves nitrogen
[02:53:29.410 --> 02:53:31.530]  because it's like frigging McDonald's.
[02:53:31.530 --> 02:53:32.490]  It tastes great.
[02:53:32.490 --> 02:53:33.770]  It's easy to digest.
[02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:36.810]  It's cheap and you can binge on it.
[02:53:36.810 --> 02:53:37.650]  Right?
[02:53:37.650 --> 02:53:38.850]  You're not going to feel good the next day,
[02:53:38.850 --> 02:53:41.570]  but hey, you know, I tasted great, man.
[02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:43.930]  If I can more, another pizza, another Big Mac,
[02:53:43.930 --> 02:53:44.770]  bring it on.
[02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:45.610]  Right?
[02:53:45.610 --> 02:53:50.610]  So bottom line is nitrogen will be broken down
[02:53:50.610 --> 02:53:53.810]  extremely quickly and easily by biology
[02:53:53.810 --> 02:53:55.530]  and released to the plant.
[02:53:55.530 --> 02:53:58.610]  But the nitrogen does not go into the plant
[02:53:58.610 --> 02:54:01.250]  without being digested by the bacteria first,
[02:54:01.930 --> 02:54:02.770]  by the biology.
[02:54:02.770 --> 02:54:05.570]  And she's still like, if there's enough in there,
[02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:08.730]  she's still breaking it down late, even late into flower.
[02:54:08.730 --> 02:54:11.010]  So is there some truth into that?
[02:54:11.010 --> 02:54:13.010]  Cause that was kind of like the old school way of like,
[02:54:13.010 --> 02:54:15.650]  hey man, you're killing your yields.
[02:54:15.650 --> 02:54:17.850]  There's been some incredible work
[02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:21.010]  that's been coming out of Michigan.
[02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:23.610]  Or is it Montana?
[02:54:24.850 --> 02:54:26.810]  About the fact that there's so much nitrogen
[02:54:26.810 --> 02:54:27.650]  stored in the soil.
[02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:30.130]  There's already so much nitrogen in there
[02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:31.890]  that we don't need it.
[02:54:31.890 --> 02:54:33.250]  And same with phosphorus.
[02:54:33.250 --> 02:54:35.610]  There's so much of that already in the soils.
[02:54:35.610 --> 02:54:36.970]  We don't need any of it.
[02:54:36.970 --> 02:54:39.490]  But that doesn't help the chemical companies
[02:54:39.490 --> 02:54:43.610]  satisfy their stockholders and pay their presidents
[02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:46.210]  ridiculous amounts of money a year.
[02:54:46.210 --> 02:54:47.730]  So they're going to keep pushing.
[02:54:47.730 --> 02:54:48.690]  Oh no, no, you need it.
[02:54:48.690 --> 02:54:49.530]  You need it.
[02:54:49.530 --> 02:54:50.370]  You need it.
[02:54:50.370 --> 02:54:55.370]  Kemp, Gabe Brown, Ray Archuleta have proven this
[02:54:56.010 --> 02:54:57.450]  over and over and over again.
[02:54:57.450 --> 02:55:00.570]  If you get the microbial biology,
[02:55:00.570 --> 02:55:05.570]  if you get the carbon or the soil organic matter up,
[02:55:05.810 --> 02:55:07.730]  you don't need any fertilizers
[02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:09.490]  and you don't need any pesticides
[02:55:09.490 --> 02:55:11.730]  because the plants are healthy.
[02:55:11.730 --> 02:55:13.890]  So, you know, that's just the, again,
[02:55:13.890 --> 02:55:16.330]  that's charging through the gate
[02:55:16.330 --> 02:55:17.810]  and screaming in the desert.
[02:55:17.810 --> 02:55:19.130]  Like you don't need this shit.
[02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:21.010]  And people look at you like crazy.
[02:55:21.010 --> 02:55:21.930]  For real.
[02:55:21.930 --> 02:55:24.690]  No, and it's the looks I've been getting my whole life.
[02:55:25.650 --> 02:55:26.490]  No doubt.
[02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:27.570]  You get used to it.
[02:55:28.610 --> 02:55:29.970]  You work where?
[02:55:29.970 --> 02:55:31.210]  Composting?
[02:55:31.210 --> 02:55:32.330]  Why would you work?
[02:55:33.730 --> 02:55:36.250]  What do you mean there's biology in the soil?
[02:55:36.250 --> 02:55:37.090]  What's fungi?
[02:55:37.090 --> 02:55:38.210]  I thought I eat those.
[02:55:41.770 --> 02:55:43.490]  Well, we're approaching the three hour mark
[02:55:43.490 --> 02:55:46.490]  and we always like to give our audience questions
[02:55:46.490 --> 02:55:48.530]  so they can pick your brain a little bit.
[02:55:49.410 --> 02:55:50.730]  I'm not sure if Peter's there.
[02:55:50.730 --> 02:55:53.450]  He did say he had to, if he's driving,
[02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:55.410]  I guess maybe we would not be able to do,
[02:55:55.850 --> 02:55:58.730]  I never, you can see the comments there, Leighton.
[02:55:58.730 --> 02:56:01.090]  Maybe we could just do it that way.
[02:56:01.090 --> 02:56:02.450]  I lived off gas days.
[02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:03.530]  Chad, I'm with you, man.
[02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:04.890]  I traveled so much.
[02:56:04.890 --> 02:56:06.650]  You fucking killed me.
[02:56:06.650 --> 02:56:09.330]  So, real quick with that too.
[02:56:09.330 --> 02:56:10.650]  And shout out to Chad Westport.
[02:56:10.650 --> 02:56:13.370]  You crack me up every fucking time, man.
[02:56:13.370 --> 02:56:14.890]  We appreciate you.
[02:56:14.890 --> 02:56:17.330]  But I also lived off horrible food.
[02:56:17.330 --> 02:56:21.930]  I lived off of basically like vending machine food
[02:56:21.930 --> 02:56:24.090]  for many years when I lived in this apartment complex
[02:56:24.090 --> 02:56:25.930]  and I was doing well financially.
[02:56:25.930 --> 02:56:27.170]  I was playing poker for a living,
[02:56:27.170 --> 02:56:30.370]  but I had the worst health problems.
[02:56:30.370 --> 02:56:31.330]  Probably still to this day.
[02:56:31.330 --> 02:56:33.410]  That's why I'm trying to get over that stuff.
[02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:35.330]  It was just maybe two to three years,
[02:56:35.330 --> 02:56:37.290]  but I feel like it's been a decade
[02:56:37.290 --> 02:56:42.290]  of trying to remember what feeling good actually felt like.
[02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:45.210]  Because I feel like as you get older and you age,
[02:56:45.210 --> 02:56:47.450]  you're kind of like, oh, you get used to this kind of stuff.
[02:56:47.450 --> 02:56:48.730]  And for whatever reason, man,
[02:56:48.730 --> 02:56:51.330]  and I always harp on this, the autophagy
[02:56:51.330 --> 02:56:52.930]  and just all the things that are beneficial,
[02:56:52.930 --> 02:56:54.690]  eating healthier, you'll,
[02:56:54.690 --> 02:56:57.570]  especially if you're over 30 years old, I think, or more,
[02:56:57.570 --> 02:57:00.930]  you'll start to realize like, wow, feeling good actually
[02:57:00.930 --> 02:57:03.850]  used to feel fantastic when I was 20 years old.
[02:57:03.850 --> 02:57:04.810]  You know?
[02:57:04.810 --> 02:57:07.250]  I mean, getting older obviously is a bitch,
[02:57:07.250 --> 02:57:08.930]  but there are certain ways that I feel like
[02:57:08.930 --> 02:57:10.450]  you can minimize that.
[02:57:10.450 --> 02:57:11.690]  Absolutely.
[02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:14.770]  Yeah, so a lot of that, like Chad's pointing out,
[02:57:14.770 --> 02:57:18.810]  that your diet has gotta be a huge part of how you feel.
[02:57:18.810 --> 02:57:21.690]  And if you're constantly feeding yourself processed foods
[02:57:21.810 --> 02:57:22.850]  and then you're asking yourself
[02:57:22.850 --> 02:57:24.370]  why you're in a shitty mood,
[02:57:24.370 --> 02:57:26.850]  I feel like Leighton is that one plus one
[02:57:26.850 --> 02:57:27.850]  is equaling two here.
[02:57:27.850 --> 02:57:30.010]  And you're just not seeing that
[02:57:30.010 --> 02:57:31.770]  things are adding up for you.
[02:57:31.770 --> 02:57:32.610]  Yeah.
[02:57:32.610 --> 02:57:34.810]  It's that preventative maintenance thing.
[02:57:34.810 --> 02:57:38.010]  If you're not making time for wellness,
[02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:39.050]  then later down the road,
[02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:41.690]  you're gonna have to make time for illness.
[02:57:41.690 --> 02:57:42.730]  I say that right?
[02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:43.970]  Yeah.
[02:57:43.970 --> 02:57:44.810]  So like,
[02:57:46.930 --> 02:57:48.490]  preventative maintenance across the board.
[02:57:48.490 --> 02:57:50.210]  And that's like why we put so much love and care
[02:57:50.250 --> 02:57:51.450]  into building our soils.
[02:57:51.450 --> 02:57:54.250]  It's because like, yeah, you spend a lot of money,
[02:57:54.250 --> 02:57:57.650]  you spend a lot of time or energy creating the soil
[02:57:57.650 --> 02:58:00.050]  and making these huge beds the first time.
[02:58:00.050 --> 02:58:02.650]  And it's like a spider weaving its web.
[02:58:02.650 --> 02:58:04.050]  It's putting in all that work.
[02:58:04.050 --> 02:58:05.530]  But like once it's set up,
[02:58:05.530 --> 02:58:06.810]  then you just get to sit back
[02:58:06.810 --> 02:58:08.290]  and wait for it all to happen.
[02:58:08.290 --> 02:58:09.130]  You know?
[02:58:09.130 --> 02:58:09.970]  It's like,
[02:58:11.410 --> 02:58:13.570]  preventative maintenance with our bodies.
[02:58:13.570 --> 02:58:16.570]  It's like our diet should be like
[02:58:16.570 --> 02:58:20.130]  definitely a big focus and a big investment.
[02:58:20.930 --> 02:58:21.770]  And that's why it's like so important
[02:58:21.770 --> 02:58:23.850]  to grow our own crops other than ganja.
[02:58:23.850 --> 02:58:24.690]  You know?
[02:58:24.690 --> 02:58:26.290]  It's like, we know how to grow,
[02:58:27.410 --> 02:58:29.890]  or we know how to make beautiful living soils.
[02:58:29.890 --> 02:58:32.130]  And so like, that's how you get nutrient dense crops.
[02:58:32.130 --> 02:58:32.970]  I'm like-
[02:58:32.970 --> 02:58:33.810]  I'm on.
[02:58:33.810 --> 02:58:35.690]  And it's so easy to grow right next to them.
[02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:36.530]  For real.
[02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:37.370]  Right?
[02:58:37.370 --> 02:58:38.410]  Just more biomass.
[02:58:38.410 --> 02:58:39.250]  Yeah.
[02:58:39.250 --> 02:58:42.050]  And like the polyculture is the way to go.
[02:58:42.050 --> 02:58:44.570]  And like, why not have cover crops, you know,
[02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:47.570]  that give you a harvest,
[02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:50.730]  another benefit or, you know.
[02:58:50.730 --> 02:58:52.970]  Grow potatoes with your cannabis plant.
[02:58:52.970 --> 02:58:54.330]  They love each other.
[02:58:54.330 --> 02:58:56.290]  They absolutely love each other.
[02:58:56.290 --> 02:58:57.130]  Nice.
[02:58:57.130 --> 02:59:00.490]  I did some carrots underneath mine this year.
[02:59:00.490 --> 02:59:01.330]  Good man.
[02:59:02.530 --> 02:59:03.370]  Yeah.
[02:59:03.370 --> 02:59:04.210]  So going back to eating,
[02:59:04.210 --> 02:59:05.050]  I think, you know,
[02:59:05.050 --> 02:59:06.970]  that's again another big problem
[02:59:06.970 --> 02:59:10.010]  is that we just don't have access to road food.
[02:59:11.050 --> 02:59:12.170]  You know, when I was growing up,
[02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:14.610]  you pulled into a diner, you know,
[02:59:14.610 --> 02:59:18.170]  we used to drive from Massachusetts to Maine every summer.
[02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:20.930]  And, you know, we'd have a stop for lunch.
[02:59:20.930 --> 02:59:24.410]  And, but you'd pull into the diner and it was real food.
[02:59:24.410 --> 02:59:27.690]  It wasn't this manufactured food.
[02:59:27.690 --> 02:59:30.610]  And so that was in the late sixties, early seventies.
[02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:34.290]  So think about how much better that was
[02:59:34.290 --> 02:59:36.450]  than what it is today.
[02:59:36.450 --> 02:59:37.290]  For real.
[02:59:37.290 --> 02:59:38.810]  You know, those little diners don't exist.
[02:59:38.810 --> 02:59:39.650]  And if they did,
[02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:43.090]  they couldn't get the quality because of default.
[02:59:43.090 --> 02:59:45.930]  Like I traveled through Greece and, you know,
[02:59:45.930 --> 02:59:48.970]  we were going from village to village to village.
[02:59:48.970 --> 02:59:51.370]  And the food was insane.
[02:59:51.370 --> 02:59:52.570]  It was amazing.
[02:59:52.570 --> 02:59:55.570]  The taste, the flavor, it made me feel so good.
[02:59:55.570 --> 02:59:56.410]  Yeah.
[02:59:56.410 --> 02:59:59.530]  And I'm like, why, what's going on here?
[02:59:59.530 --> 03:00:00.370]  And they're like, well,
[03:00:00.370 --> 03:00:03.530]  we can't afford fertilizers or pesticides.
[03:00:03.530 --> 03:00:05.490]  So we have to live regeneratively.
[03:00:05.490 --> 03:00:07.170]  We have no choice.
[03:00:07.170 --> 03:00:09.650]  And so that's something that, you know,
[03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:10.970]  in many ways,
[03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:15.970]  we Americans who have become the richest civilization
[03:00:16.010 --> 03:00:20.370]  perhaps, or we have the highest standard of living
[03:00:21.330 --> 03:00:22.650]  have been shortchanged.
[03:00:22.650 --> 03:00:27.650]  We've been ruined by the money grab,
[03:00:27.730 --> 03:00:32.330]  the greed of the few who take away the good things
[03:00:33.290 --> 03:00:34.730]  and put in box stores.
[03:00:34.730 --> 03:00:38.090]  Like I remember hardware stores, Ace Hardware.
[03:00:39.050 --> 03:00:42.330]  Those used to be individually owned by families
[03:00:42.330 --> 03:00:43.810]  all across the country.
[03:00:43.810 --> 03:00:46.570]  Same with your grocery store, same with your pharmacy.
[03:00:47.650 --> 03:00:51.090]  Find me an old family pharmacy anywhere, right?
[03:00:51.090 --> 03:00:53.210]  There's, they don't exist anymore.
[03:00:53.210 --> 03:00:56.770]  And the same with those small mom pop hardware stores.
[03:00:56.770 --> 03:00:58.890]  I actually did find one in Sonos
[03:00:58.890 --> 03:01:00.450]  and it was such a pleasure to go in there.
[03:01:00.450 --> 03:01:02.530]  I could get anything I wanted
[03:01:02.530 --> 03:01:05.490]  and it wasn't this cheap fucking bolts
[03:01:05.490 --> 03:01:07.130]  that are made with pop metal.
[03:01:07.130 --> 03:01:09.010]  They're not even real metal.
[03:01:09.010 --> 03:01:10.810]  You know, they don't cross thread.
[03:01:10.810 --> 03:01:13.170]  You know, I mean, it was such a pleasure,
[03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:16.170]  but it's, this is what's horrifying
[03:01:16.170 --> 03:01:18.010]  about being as old as I am.
[03:01:18.010 --> 03:01:20.290]  Is that I can look back and remember
[03:01:20.290 --> 03:01:23.650]  what it was like to live back then.
[03:01:23.650 --> 03:01:26.650]  My dad worked, my mom didn't.
[03:01:26.650 --> 03:01:28.090]  We always had two cars.
[03:01:28.090 --> 03:01:30.210]  There was never any complaints about, you know,
[03:01:30.210 --> 03:01:34.370]  not having enough money to survive another day.
[03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:36.810]  I mean, you know, yeah, Christmas wasn't like,
[03:01:37.810 --> 03:01:39.970]  you know, we had a thousand presents, you know,
[03:01:39.970 --> 03:01:41.850]  and most of them were clothes and stuff that we needed,
[03:01:41.850 --> 03:01:45.250]  not just toys, but it was just a different style,
[03:01:45.250 --> 03:01:46.090]  a different world.
[03:01:46.090 --> 03:01:47.570]  And now it's like, you know,
[03:01:47.570 --> 03:01:49.690]  both members of the family have to work.
[03:01:49.690 --> 03:01:52.810]  The kids get thrown in fucking daycare, you know,
[03:01:52.810 --> 03:01:57.810]  and all the food you eat is crap because the goodness,
[03:01:59.890 --> 03:02:03.090]  the quality has been pushed out of business
[03:02:03.090 --> 03:02:06.930]  for the cheaper, faster, easier way than corporate profits.
[03:02:07.770 --> 03:02:11.730]  So, you know, this is why I'm so dedicated to this show
[03:02:11.730 --> 03:02:13.450]  and Brian and doing this work
[03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:15.730]  is to get this information out to people
[03:02:15.730 --> 03:02:18.650]  so that they can understand there is a better way,
[03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:21.810]  but you have to put your fucking money where your mouth is
[03:02:21.810 --> 03:02:23.850]  or your belief system.
[03:02:23.850 --> 03:02:25.450]  Don't buy the shit.
[03:02:25.450 --> 03:02:27.250]  Just don't buy it.
[03:02:27.250 --> 03:02:30.730]  You know, Brian talks about intermittent fasting.
[03:02:30.730 --> 03:02:32.650]  You know, I'm all about it.
[03:02:32.650 --> 03:02:34.250]  I don't eat all day long
[03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:36.330]  and I'll try to eat something healthy
[03:02:36.770 --> 03:02:38.450]  around two or three o'clock in the afternoon
[03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:39.770]  and I feel great.
[03:02:39.770 --> 03:02:41.850]  And then I'll eat a little something before bed,
[03:02:41.850 --> 03:02:44.930]  you know, an orange or an apple or something.
[03:02:44.930 --> 03:02:49.130]  Then fortunately I am in a green belt here in Oxnard
[03:02:49.130 --> 03:02:52.210]  where there's a lot of organic, real food.
[03:02:52.210 --> 03:02:53.610]  Yes, you have to search it out.
[03:02:53.610 --> 03:02:55.170]  The farmers markets are great,
[03:02:56.130 --> 03:02:59.570]  but yeah, I can survive here,
[03:02:59.570 --> 03:03:02.210]  but back in Massachusetts, no.
[03:03:02.210 --> 03:03:06.050]  During the winter, you were forced to buy shit
[03:03:06.770 --> 03:03:08.690]  and it was shipped in or trucked in from out here.
[03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:09.530]  Exactly.
[03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:12.730]  And that's unfortunately the problem
[03:03:12.730 --> 03:03:14.530]  with the nation as a whole
[03:03:14.530 --> 03:03:17.610]  is that we don't have a real good network
[03:03:17.610 --> 03:03:20.250]  to get the organic food to everybody
[03:03:20.250 --> 03:03:22.170]  throughout the course of the year.
[03:03:23.010 --> 03:03:25.530]  But sorry, that was a crazy rant for sure.
[03:03:27.210 --> 03:03:28.050]  Lot of truth in that.
[03:03:28.050 --> 03:03:29.450]  If you guys have questions,
[03:03:29.450 --> 03:03:31.210]  hit us up in the chat real quick.
[03:03:32.370 --> 03:03:35.610]  Otherwise, we are at that three hour mark.
[03:03:36.650 --> 03:03:39.410]  Definitely need to roll back into the gear here.
[03:03:40.770 --> 03:03:43.650]  How would you start living soil on a fixed income?
[03:03:45.090 --> 03:03:47.370]  All right, so look at your resources.
[03:03:47.370 --> 03:03:48.210]  Where are you?
[03:03:48.210 --> 03:03:50.410]  In the city or you're in the country?
[03:03:50.410 --> 03:03:52.410]  Everything you can collect yourself,
[03:03:52.410 --> 03:03:54.370]  it's called wild crafting.
[03:03:54.370 --> 03:03:56.930]  So learn a little bit more about sand,
[03:03:56.930 --> 03:04:00.210]  so clay and organic matter in your area.
[03:04:00.210 --> 03:04:01.690]  Where's the sand pit?
[03:04:03.090 --> 03:04:05.170]  Walk the creeks, walk the streams,
[03:04:05.170 --> 03:04:06.170]  look for erosion.
[03:04:06.170 --> 03:04:08.930]  Erosion will give you sand, silt and clay
[03:04:08.930 --> 03:04:10.810]  more often than not.
[03:04:10.810 --> 03:04:14.570]  Silt will puddle up at the base of the erosion.
[03:04:14.570 --> 03:04:17.890]  The clay will usually be a vein that you can see.
[03:04:17.890 --> 03:04:19.130]  Sand is everywhere.
[03:04:20.330 --> 03:04:22.330]  As far as organic matter is concerned,
[03:04:23.290 --> 03:04:26.650]  resources like the hay feed stores.
[03:04:26.650 --> 03:04:29.250]  Find out the farmers in the area.
[03:04:29.250 --> 03:04:32.290]  Get hay, get leaves, make your own compost.
[03:04:33.130 --> 03:04:36.250]  Out of the, if you're trying to just start like right now,
[03:04:36.250 --> 03:04:37.890]  that's the biggest problem you have.
[03:04:37.890 --> 03:04:39.610]  You need to prepare yourself.
[03:04:39.610 --> 03:04:42.050]  Give yourself six months to collect everything,
[03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:44.850]  break it down and then build it.
[03:04:44.850 --> 03:04:46.530]  That's the other problem with humanity
[03:04:46.530 --> 03:04:48.650]  is we want it right now.
[03:04:48.650 --> 03:04:50.690]  We've lost the power of patience.
[03:04:50.690 --> 03:04:52.530]  Like we can't wait for anything.
[03:04:52.530 --> 03:04:53.370]  Totally.
[03:04:54.650 --> 03:04:56.490]  So hopefully I answered that question.
[03:04:56.490 --> 03:04:58.930]  Yeah, never send organic matter off your property.
[03:04:58.930 --> 03:05:00.290]  And we touched on this earlier
[03:05:00.290 --> 03:05:01.730]  about not sending away your leaves,
[03:05:02.610 --> 03:05:03.690]  that stuff is gold
[03:05:03.690 --> 03:05:05.530]  and you should never send it off your property.
[03:05:05.530 --> 03:05:08.330]  You need to stockpile that
[03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:09.410]  and it's all gonna break down
[03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:12.410]  and be a wonderful resource someday.
[03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:14.970]  So that's one of the benefits of having space.
[03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:17.170]  And I know a lot of people don't have that.
[03:05:18.130 --> 03:05:21.130]  So Jeff, thank you so much for reminding me.
[03:05:21.130 --> 03:05:26.130]  Wild crafting should be done with mindfulness and efficacy.
[03:05:26.930 --> 03:05:29.970]  I call it respect, respectfully wild crafting.
[03:05:29.970 --> 03:05:31.530]  If you're gonna go in the woods
[03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:33.370]  and get some forest stuff,
[03:05:33.370 --> 03:05:34.970]  bring a, if you're gonna go
[03:05:34.970 --> 03:05:37.010]  and collect five gallon bucket of it,
[03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:39.170]  bring a five gallon bucket of compost
[03:05:39.170 --> 03:05:41.890]  or some other gift back in there.
[03:05:41.890 --> 03:05:43.490]  Never leave a scar.
[03:05:43.490 --> 03:05:45.890]  Don't dig a hole, strip it and walk away.
[03:05:45.890 --> 03:05:48.370]  Make sure that you repair the forest floor
[03:05:48.370 --> 03:05:50.810]  so that it can naturally heal itself quickly
[03:05:50.810 --> 03:05:54.930]  and not scab up and or worse erode.
[03:05:54.930 --> 03:05:55.810]  Absolutely.
[03:05:55.810 --> 03:05:57.090]  And we talked about this earlier
[03:05:57.090 --> 03:05:59.130]  and Kelly taught me this from Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
[03:05:59.130 --> 03:06:00.850]  but like don't go out to the woods
[03:06:01.170 --> 03:06:03.490]  and just look into wild craft silica.
[03:06:03.490 --> 03:06:05.890]  You know, you're like, you're going to look for horsetail
[03:06:05.890 --> 03:06:09.690]  and like you're so like isolationist mindset
[03:06:09.690 --> 03:06:11.210]  that you're like, okay, I'm going out
[03:06:11.210 --> 03:06:13.690]  and I'm looking for one single nutrient.
[03:06:13.690 --> 03:06:15.730]  Like I'm going to harvest silica right now.
[03:06:15.730 --> 03:06:18.610]  It's like, no, you're going to harvest-
[03:06:18.610 --> 03:06:19.730]  Whatever she gives.
[03:06:19.730 --> 03:06:20.850]  Whatever she gives you.
[03:06:20.850 --> 03:06:23.850]  But like also you're gonna hopefully walk out of the woods,
[03:06:23.850 --> 03:06:26.650]  you know, with this new wisdom that you've learned something
[03:06:26.650 --> 03:06:29.450]  because you did sit down and you just sat in silence
[03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:31.290]  and you observed and like,
[03:06:31.290 --> 03:06:33.930]  I think she could teach you a lot of lessons
[03:06:33.930 --> 03:06:36.650]  if you just go out there with like the most respect
[03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:38.850]  and good intentions and everything
[03:06:38.850 --> 03:06:41.250]  and you're not just taking stuff.
[03:06:42.570 --> 03:06:45.570]  Yeah, that is, that's, you know, that's so again,
[03:06:45.570 --> 03:06:50.570]  such an important point is that if you are aware,
[03:06:51.210 --> 03:06:52.770]  if you're paying attention,
[03:06:52.770 --> 03:06:55.130]  the universe will show you what you need.
[03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:56.570]  All of a sudden, like you said,
[03:06:56.610 --> 03:07:00.170]  if you just go in open-minded and don't go in on a mission
[03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:02.050]  and just sit back and look,
[03:07:02.050 --> 03:07:03.690]  then the things that come to you,
[03:07:03.690 --> 03:07:05.010]  the things that you observe
[03:07:05.010 --> 03:07:06.330]  are probably things that you need.
[03:07:06.330 --> 03:07:07.970]  Kind of like intuition.
[03:07:07.970 --> 03:07:09.970]  Like every time I think of something like,
[03:07:09.970 --> 03:07:11.730]  oh, I should grab that pair of pliers.
[03:07:11.730 --> 03:07:14.130]  Not random thought, I'm going to a job.
[03:07:14.130 --> 03:07:15.730]  I should grab that pair of pliers.
[03:07:15.730 --> 03:07:17.890]  Every time I don't grab those pair of pliers,
[03:07:17.890 --> 03:07:19.890]  I get to the job and fucking something breaks.
[03:07:19.890 --> 03:07:21.130]  That's when you need them.
[03:07:21.130 --> 03:07:24.450]  Man, I should have listened to my thoughts.
[03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:26.050]  Your body is ahead of you.
[03:07:26.050 --> 03:07:28.050]  It's traveling in speed and time.
[03:07:28.050 --> 03:07:31.010]  And that's where your intuition comes from.
[03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:32.850]  So if you are mindfully aware
[03:07:32.850 --> 03:07:35.010]  and you're walking through the forest,
[03:07:35.010 --> 03:07:38.530]  intuitively what you need or what you're going to need
[03:07:38.530 --> 03:07:40.450]  is going to come to you.
[03:07:40.450 --> 03:07:43.090]  It's amazing when you let go of power and control.
[03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:45.050]  For real.
[03:07:45.050 --> 03:07:47.970]  And it's truly remarkable how much I've noticed,
[03:07:47.970 --> 03:07:51.610]  you know, like that intuition, like getting better
[03:07:51.610 --> 03:07:54.170]  and like being able to trust my gut, you know,
[03:07:54.890 --> 03:07:56.410]  that's my second brain like Brian was talking about.
[03:07:56.410 --> 03:07:59.210]  I'm like, the more I eat these healthy foods
[03:07:59.210 --> 03:08:01.810]  and I inoculate my gut with these probiotics,
[03:08:01.810 --> 03:08:03.770]  it's like, that's where it's at.
[03:08:03.770 --> 03:08:05.890]  Like a healthy gut is a healthy life.
[03:08:05.890 --> 03:08:07.570]  Like a healthy gut is-
[03:08:07.570 --> 03:08:11.770]  It's also a healthy gut instinct, which is your intuition.
[03:08:11.770 --> 03:08:13.450]  It's everything, man.
[03:08:13.450 --> 03:08:14.930]  And if you have yeast overgrowth
[03:08:14.930 --> 03:08:17.530]  and you don't think that those microbes are affecting you,
[03:08:17.530 --> 03:08:19.330]  late at night when you're craving candy
[03:08:19.330 --> 03:08:22.370]  and sugars and stuff, rethink that.
[03:08:22.530 --> 03:08:24.850]  I definitely used to experience that shit.
[03:08:24.850 --> 03:08:27.890]  Real quick, we have a question here for you Chandler.
[03:08:27.890 --> 03:08:30.730]  If you ferment EM1 and molasses together in water,
[03:08:30.730 --> 03:08:33.050]  could you inoculate spent beer grain
[03:08:33.050 --> 03:08:36.730]  without the use of the specifically inoculated Bokashi brand?
[03:08:39.450 --> 03:08:43.570]  So EM1 and molasses makes Bokashi brand.
[03:08:44.490 --> 03:08:46.650]  What's the question again?
[03:08:46.650 --> 03:08:49.410]  It's brain grand, you can kind of-
[03:08:49.410 --> 03:08:51.850]  I think what he's trying to do is make his own Bokashi.
[03:08:52.450 --> 03:08:53.290]  That's what it sounded like.
[03:08:53.290 --> 03:08:55.850]  Yeah, you can absolutely make your own Bokashi.
[03:08:55.850 --> 03:09:00.570]  So you can buy a bottle of EM1 or I think,
[03:09:00.570 --> 03:09:01.850]  is it Terragonics?
[03:09:01.850 --> 03:09:06.250]  They have a probiotic or SCD probiotics.
[03:09:06.250 --> 03:09:07.570]  There's a couple of different brands out there,
[03:09:07.570 --> 03:09:12.450]  but it's this consortium or mix of a couple of different
[03:09:12.450 --> 03:09:17.130]  lactic acid, bacterium and yeast.
[03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:21.730]  Okay, so EM's really cool.
[03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:25.170]  And it's more than just like culturing lab
[03:09:25.170 --> 03:09:28.290]  from milk and rice, sauce, water and everything.
[03:09:28.290 --> 03:09:30.570]  It's like, there's this really cool blend of,
[03:09:33.650 --> 03:09:37.410]  I don't know, I'm ready to get into all of this.
[03:09:37.410 --> 03:09:38.250]  Just in so-
[03:09:41.130 --> 03:09:42.730]  You know what, it's interesting
[03:09:42.730 --> 03:09:46.170]  because EM1 is basically three organisms
[03:09:46.170 --> 03:09:47.090]  that work together.
[03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:48.370]  It's a poop loop.
[03:09:48.370 --> 03:09:50.290]  Each one of them is producing something
[03:09:50.330 --> 03:09:52.490]  and taking something back away.
[03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:56.410]  It's a really highly stable biological community.
[03:09:56.410 --> 03:09:57.450]  It's very limited.
[03:09:57.450 --> 03:09:59.210]  Again, it's very small.
[03:09:59.210 --> 03:10:01.250]  Big shout out to Russ Brandon,
[03:10:01.250 --> 03:10:02.810]  or Brandon Russ, I should say.
[03:10:04.570 --> 03:10:08.410]  He's doing some amazing work on advanced.
[03:10:08.410 --> 03:10:11.250]  He can't call me EM's anymore,
[03:10:11.250 --> 03:10:14.530]  but they're advanced communities that are working together
[03:10:14.530 --> 03:10:15.530]  that are lab grown.
[03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:17.690]  Now, I'm not a big fan of lab grown
[03:10:17.690 --> 03:10:19.010]  as I've made myself clear.
[03:10:19.050 --> 03:10:22.490]  There's a big difference between in vivo and in vitro.
[03:10:22.490 --> 03:10:24.090]  So in vitro is grown in a lab,
[03:10:24.090 --> 03:10:25.850]  in vivo is grown in nature.
[03:10:25.850 --> 03:10:27.490]  I'm all about the nature grown stuff
[03:10:27.490 --> 03:10:30.250]  because it's more resilient and it's proven to last.
[03:10:30.250 --> 03:10:32.290]  Whereas anything grown in a lab
[03:10:33.210 --> 03:10:36.610]  is basically like taking the rich kid out of the big house
[03:10:36.610 --> 03:10:37.730]  and throwing him in the ghetto.
[03:10:37.730 --> 03:10:39.930]  He's not gonna last very long.
[03:10:39.930 --> 03:10:42.610]  But vice versa, you take that ghetto kid
[03:10:42.610 --> 03:10:44.010]  and you throw him in
[03:10:44.010 --> 03:10:47.290]  and give him all the fricking access to anything he needs.
[03:10:47.330 --> 03:10:49.610]  He's gonna be really successful.
[03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:50.450]  For sure.
[03:10:51.450 --> 03:10:52.290]  That's great.
[03:10:53.290 --> 03:10:54.770]  And yeah, we talked about that
[03:10:54.770 --> 03:10:56.570]  with like the compost temperature earlier,
[03:10:56.570 --> 03:10:58.210]  like being Miami or whatever.
[03:10:58.210 --> 03:10:59.690]  It's like your soil temperature
[03:10:59.690 --> 03:11:02.170]  is like it's got its own unique ecosystem too.
[03:11:02.170 --> 03:11:05.370]  And if you're brewing like a compost tea outside in the cold
[03:11:05.370 --> 03:11:07.010]  and then you take that and you employ that
[03:11:07.010 --> 03:11:09.010]  into your 80 degree grow room,
[03:11:09.010 --> 03:11:11.850]  it's like those microbes aren't gonna vibe.
[03:11:11.850 --> 03:11:13.250]  They're not gonna, you know,
[03:11:13.290 --> 03:11:15.730]  it's like transportation,
[03:11:15.730 --> 03:11:18.850]  sending a human from Miami to Antarctica
[03:11:18.850 --> 03:11:20.850]  or vice versa, whatever, you know.
[03:11:21.690 --> 03:11:22.530]  Well said.
[03:11:22.530 --> 03:11:24.330]  That was one of the main things, Dr. Lane Ninkam,
[03:11:24.330 --> 03:11:26.890]  I felt like I took a gold nugget from her
[03:11:26.890 --> 03:11:28.970]  was brewing, when I started brewing my teas
[03:11:28.970 --> 03:11:31.370]  where I was growing instead of outside.
[03:11:31.370 --> 03:11:32.290]  It was cooler.
[03:11:33.290 --> 03:11:34.210]  Well said.
[03:11:34.210 --> 03:11:36.530]  Yeah, you definitely wanna be at the same temperature
[03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:39.250]  gradient that you are applying it on.
[03:11:39.250 --> 03:11:40.810]  That's really important.
[03:11:40.810 --> 03:11:42.450]  And watch out for high temperatures
[03:11:42.570 --> 03:11:43.730]  because they definitely,
[03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:46.730]  I don't care how good of a start you had,
[03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:49.530]  if you're brewing in temperatures above 100 degrees,
[03:11:49.530 --> 03:11:51.090]  you're gonna have nothing but nightmares.
[03:11:51.090 --> 03:11:51.930]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:11:53.090 --> 03:11:57.690]  I think I saw one more question and then from Lex Steinberg.
[03:11:57.690 --> 03:12:00.410]  What do you think about using malted barley
[03:12:00.410 --> 03:12:03.530]  in your organic mix and or vermicompost?
[03:12:03.530 --> 03:12:06.570]  I have heard it has an excellent source of enzymes
[03:12:06.570 --> 03:12:07.810]  and it does for sure.
[03:12:07.810 --> 03:12:10.930]  Yeah, it definitely is active, no doubt.
[03:12:10.970 --> 03:12:15.810]  But so I've gotten some organic bags of malted barley.
[03:12:15.810 --> 03:12:19.090]  And Josh and Kelly saw that on my story
[03:12:19.090 --> 03:12:21.290]  and they reached out and they actually said
[03:12:21.290 --> 03:12:24.330]  that they've gotten multiple sources tested
[03:12:24.330 --> 03:12:28.010]  and it comes back for like a lot of pathogens,
[03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:30.210]  like from multiple sources.
[03:12:30.210 --> 03:12:33.210]  And some of them are like even pretty nasty pathogens.
[03:12:34.650 --> 03:12:36.930]  And so that kind of deterred me a little bit.
[03:12:36.930 --> 03:12:38.570]  And I was like, well, I just bought
[03:12:38.570 --> 03:12:40.170]  two of these huge bags of it.
[03:12:40.970 --> 03:12:42.890]  I think maybe I should just try to ferment it,
[03:12:42.890 --> 03:12:47.810]  like put the EM through it to out-compete any pathogens
[03:12:47.810 --> 03:12:49.290]  or anything like that.
[03:12:49.290 --> 03:12:53.490]  But I mean, honestly, I have little experience with it,
[03:12:53.490 --> 03:12:55.690]  but they said basically they know people
[03:12:55.690 --> 03:13:00.610]  that have used it indoors and run into mildew problems,
[03:13:00.610 --> 03:13:02.890]  like powdery and downy mildew
[03:13:02.890 --> 03:13:05.770]  when you use malted barley indoors.
[03:13:05.770 --> 03:13:08.530]  Who knows, it's something that I heard,
[03:13:08.530 --> 03:13:10.250]  but it's from Josh and Kelly.
[03:13:10.690 --> 03:13:12.450]  So I really trust them.
[03:13:12.450 --> 03:13:15.730]  But do either of you have any experience with that?
[03:13:16.810 --> 03:13:20.450]  We used to use malted barley, but we weren't being tested.
[03:13:20.450 --> 03:13:22.050]  And what you had just mentioned,
[03:13:22.050 --> 03:13:24.450]  I feel like, yeah, if you're being tested.
[03:13:24.450 --> 03:13:25.290]  Plus-
[03:13:25.290 --> 03:13:26.250]  That's so much of this.
[03:13:26.250 --> 03:13:30.370]  The sources also, again, like you just literally mentioned
[03:13:30.370 --> 03:13:32.130]  is almost all of it, right?
[03:13:32.130 --> 03:13:35.410]  So if you're sourcing quality products,
[03:13:35.410 --> 03:13:39.730]  yeah, I have heard that there is quality malted barley,
[03:13:40.250 --> 03:13:41.090]  but from what I understand,
[03:13:41.090 --> 03:13:43.450]  it's kind of like the baloney of the industry
[03:13:43.450 --> 03:13:44.890]  or whatever it's all about.
[03:13:44.890 --> 03:13:47.370]  The mishmash, and that's why you have a,
[03:13:47.370 --> 03:13:49.290]  could potentially have a bunch of issues.
[03:13:49.290 --> 03:13:50.290]  I see.
[03:13:50.290 --> 03:13:52.410]  Yeah, it's like rice holes.
[03:13:52.410 --> 03:13:55.810]  Highest concentration of arsenic I've ever found.
[03:13:55.810 --> 03:13:59.730]  Even in the organic version, there's still high arsenic.
[03:13:59.730 --> 03:14:01.210]  So I try to tell people,
[03:14:01.210 --> 03:14:03.170]  if you're growing and you're getting tested,
[03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:07.090]  don't be screwing around with an aeration source like that.
[03:14:07.090 --> 03:14:07.930]  For sure.
[03:14:07.930 --> 03:14:09.530]  And again, go back to know your source.
[03:14:10.290 --> 03:14:11.730]  And I mean, know them.
[03:14:11.730 --> 03:14:13.650]  Don't just trust their word.
[03:14:13.650 --> 03:14:16.690]  Get in their head, follow up, check their practices.
[03:14:17.970 --> 03:14:19.690]  Do your diligence.
[03:14:19.690 --> 03:14:20.530]  Yeah.
[03:14:20.530 --> 03:14:21.370]  Don't be lazy.
[03:14:22.810 --> 03:14:24.930]  All right, you ready to wind down, Brian?
[03:14:24.930 --> 03:14:25.770]  Yes, sir.
[03:14:25.770 --> 03:14:27.090]  I need to get my boys
[03:14:27.090 --> 03:14:30.210]  and focus on some other things for sure.
[03:14:30.210 --> 03:14:32.490]  Brother, it was so nice to meet you, man.
[03:14:32.490 --> 03:14:33.970]  Thank you so much.
[03:14:33.970 --> 03:14:36.690]  Appreciate your spirituality and deep respect
[03:14:36.690 --> 03:14:39.170]  for both the environment and what you're doing.
[03:14:40.010 --> 03:14:41.690]  Man, keep up the good work, brother.
[03:14:41.690 --> 03:14:43.290]  I truly appreciate you guys.
[03:14:43.290 --> 03:14:44.730]  Hope to meet in person soon.
[03:14:44.730 --> 03:14:45.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:45.570 --> 03:14:48.490]  Yeah, DM me so we can get our contacts straight.
[03:14:48.490 --> 03:14:49.530]  Yeah, for sure, man.
[03:14:49.530 --> 03:14:50.770]  Talk off camera.
[03:14:50.770 --> 03:14:51.850]  Awesome.
[03:14:51.850 --> 03:14:53.170]  All right, take care, guys.
[03:14:53.170 --> 03:14:54.010]  Is Peter there?
[03:14:54.010 --> 03:14:57.410]  Because he's gonna have to be the one to click that button.
[03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:58.250]  Otherwise, we're just gonna sit here.
[03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:59.090]  We can just wait for you to X out.
[03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.930]  We're stuck here.
[03:15:01.610 --> 03:15:03.250]  I don't know how that would work.
[03:15:03.250 --> 03:15:05.290]  Well, if we just X out.
[03:15:05.290 --> 03:15:06.370]  People are gonna just watch.
[03:15:06.370 --> 03:15:07.210]  Black screen.
[03:15:07.210 --> 03:15:08.050]  An empty black screen.
[03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:10.010]  They're gonna watch a blank screen for a little while.
[03:15:10.010 --> 03:15:10.850]  Oh, there's Peter.
[03:15:10.850 --> 03:15:11.810]  Oh, there's Peter, okay.
[03:15:11.810 --> 03:15:14.690]  Let me try to log in, kill the live.
[03:15:14.690 --> 03:15:16.890]  Are you gonna give us a three, two, one, Peter?
[03:15:16.890 --> 03:15:20.610]  Hey, we appreciate your time, Chandler.
[03:15:20.610 --> 03:15:23.170]  I mean, three hours of anybody's time is crazy.
[03:15:23.170 --> 03:15:24.650]  So, you know, each and every week,
[03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:26.010]  we just appreciate the guests
[03:15:26.010 --> 03:15:28.410]  and you taking the time to kind of dive deep
[03:15:28.410 --> 03:15:30.330]  is the main thing that I feel like our show
[03:15:30.330 --> 03:15:31.450]  is starting to be known for
[03:15:31.450 --> 03:15:33.490]  is trying to find the real information.
