[00:04.800 --> 00:09.080]  How long has the company been going? The company, yeah, the company's been going
[00:09.080 --> 00:12.960]  for probably about four years now. Got it. We started it but we have been growing,
[00:12.960 --> 00:17.560]  you know, behind the scenes. For sure, for sure. Experimenting. You didn't just wake up one day and do that. Yeah, exactly.
[00:17.560 --> 00:25.280]  I was like 16. And Michigan the whole time? Yep. Yeah, been in Michigan the whole time,
[00:25.280 --> 00:29.640]  you know, and then at the time I went down to MSU and got my degree there and
[00:29.640 --> 00:33.560]  just from there it kind of turned into this beautiful thing where we were able
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.280]  to just, yeah, start working with the plant and creating new strains of our
[00:37.280 --> 00:43.000]  own and testing them. Were there a lot of cannabis growers at MSU when you
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.160]  went to school with them? You know, there weren't really at the time. There were
[00:46.160 --> 00:49.360]  the guys that were growing in their closets or their basements but a lot of
[00:49.360 --> 00:52.800]  people, at least that were in my graduating class, were really focused on
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.200]  the organic farming and their degrees and stuff like that but, you know, now I
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.040]  see universities, I know, I think it's like Northern or something like that,
[01:01.040 --> 01:04.880]  they have a cannabis production class actually. It's a course at the
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.200]  university. Isn't that brilliant? So it's funny how you could at one point a couple years ago get
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.120]  kicked out of college for cannabis and now they're teaching you how to grow
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.480]  cannabis at universities. You know, in Pueblo, Colorado, which is just south of Denver on
[01:17.480 --> 01:25.280]  that front I-25 front range, there's a CSU division or branch or university and
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.680]  they have a cannabis studies master's degree program. It's been there for a
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.760]  couple years and you're like, what? Yeah, you're like, what is this? Yeah, it's
[01:33.760 --> 01:37.600]  funny, back in the day, you know, if they would have called it, you know, hydroponics,
[01:37.600 --> 01:41.200]  you know, growing or like how to grow cannabis in your closet, you know, they
[01:41.200 --> 01:46.760]  would have had, you know, 10, 15, 20 people just be like, you know what? Like, yeah, I
[01:46.760 --> 01:50.400]  am here to grow cannabis and he was saying a lot of people would show up for
[01:50.400 --> 01:53.880]  his greenhouse classes and stuff like that and, you know, he could tell they
[01:53.880 --> 01:57.400]  weren't actually interested in learning how to do a commercial greenhouse of
[01:57.400 --> 02:04.440]  sorts. They were just there to, you know, grow flower, but yeah. We got into the
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.760]  whole breeding thing, you know, actually my business partner approached me one day.
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.440]  I was working at a hydro store at the time and he was like, you know what, man?
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.480]  We should start a seed company and I was like, sounds like a great idea and six
[02:15.480 --> 02:18.720]  months later I quit my job and we started doing this full-time and we were
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.520]  growing at the time to support ourselves and we just really wanted to do
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.920]  something where we were able to be creative and create a product that
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.160]  somebody else could also experience and that started about four years ago and
[02:33.160 --> 02:39.400]  now we've got seeds all over the world from Australia to Spain, the UK, US, you
[02:39.400 --> 02:43.520]  know, East Coast to West Coast and up into Canada as well. So it's really been,
[02:43.520 --> 02:49.880]  you know, a crazy growth over the last four years. We went from, I think, two
[02:49.880 --> 02:53.520]  followers on our Instagram and now we're up to almost 13,000 and we're
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.800]  seeing pictures of plants, you know, that people are growing of our strains and
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.240]  it's cool. It allows us to be creative and, you know, leave our mark.
[03:02.240 --> 03:13.160]  What do you want to be known for? Are you guys chasing trends? Are you going in your own direction and saying there are going to be people who appreciate what we're creating?
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.080]  I guess what we're doing is we're just looking to kind of follow our own path.
[03:17.080 --> 03:21.560]  We want to work with the things that we've created to continue to develop on
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.200]  those but at the same time, you know, maybe take a step back and look into more
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.080]  of the land race and some of the original varietals that were out there
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.840]  before, you know, all this cross-pollination and all this giant
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.520]  melting pot essentially has come about and kind of look backwards and bring
[03:39.520 --> 03:46.480]  some of the old strains into the future. Like give me some examples. So like with
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.360]  some Death Star strains, that's something that we've been looking into working
[03:50.360 --> 03:54.760]  with. We actually ran across an individual who has a plethora of heirloom
[03:54.760 --> 04:01.120]  land race genetics that he's collected from Colombia and India and Thailand and
[04:01.120 --> 04:06.240]  just all over the place and they're, you know, 25, 30 years old and he's just kind
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.920]  of been stashing all these away and he approached us actually at a grow event a
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.840]  couple months back and was like, by the way, I have all this stuff and he busted
[04:13.840 --> 04:17.600]  out his seed list and we just about shit our pants when we found out what he
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.480]  had, you know, he had original Sensi Stars and there's all sorts of stuff that you
[04:21.480 --> 04:27.080]  can't get anymore. So I would like to hear something about the learning curve
[04:27.080 --> 04:32.220]  in a genetics program. How much of that education did you get at school and how
[04:32.220 --> 04:35.920]  much was it on the ground or from your partners and what are the big hurdles? I
[04:35.920 --> 04:41.400]  mean, you think about breeding programs taking a long time, even decades, in
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.280]  traditional crops and you get F1s and F2s relatively quick in this particular
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.160]  crop. What is the diligence and the challenge to get high quality, repeatable
[04:51.160 --> 04:56.400]  genetics from your experience? Well, it definitely takes time and it's
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.040]  very meticulous work in regards to you have to be paying attention to
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.120]  everything, you know, from vigor to the overall plant structure, you know, how
[05:04.120 --> 05:08.760]  much does this plant eat, you know, what's its terpene profile, what, you know, what
[05:08.760 --> 05:14.120]  does the leaf variegation look like and so what we had, you know, in our peanut
[05:14.120 --> 05:19.360]  butter breath project, we had used the leaf variegation on the edge of the leaf
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.240]  to be a real indicator trait for us because the ocean grown cush breath or
[05:23.240 --> 05:28.080]  the OGKB has that wild duck foot going on and you can tell when you get
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.800]  something it looks very mutant and not normal and then there's, you know, the
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.720]  more dosey dose side and so with our peanut butter breath line, not only were
[05:36.720 --> 05:40.720]  we able to decipher, you know, what we were getting from the physical traits
[05:40.720 --> 05:46.160]  but also the color and the frost content but it takes time to get there, you know,
[05:46.160 --> 05:51.160]  and nowadays, like you said, the F1s and F2s are, they're easier to come up with
[05:51.160 --> 05:54.800]  and everybody's doing it but to really truly, you know, get an inbred line, you
[05:54.800 --> 05:58.840]  have to get, you know, many generations deep into your project and it takes a
[05:58.840 --> 06:03.720]  lot of time and at MSU when I was there, I had taken plant genetic courses
[06:03.880 --> 06:09.080]  and, you know, you get into the really intricate parts of it, you know, much
[06:09.080 --> 06:13.640]  further than the Punnett squares and, you know, all those science experiments, you
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.560]  know, you would do back in grade school but it gets deeper than that and to
[06:18.560 --> 06:23.200]  see a project come to fruition and you can see the mother and the father's
[06:23.200 --> 06:27.220]  distinct traits, you know, passed down to those next fetal generations is really a
[06:27.220 --> 06:32.040]  neat thing, especially too when you're seeing the same results in other
[06:32.120 --> 06:37.800]  people's gardens. So it, but it takes time and yeah, figuring out, you know,
[06:37.800 --> 06:41.920]  figuring out what makes sense, you know, you're not just gonna put two totally
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.720]  random species of plant together and, you know, be like, all right, this is the one.
[06:45.720 --> 06:50.400]  It takes looking at, you know, the parental lineages and figuring out what
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.080]  you're really trying to capture out of crossing those two.
[06:54.080 --> 06:58.880]  You know, without, I don't want to, I don't want to call anyone out because I'm not an expert, I'm not a
[06:58.880 --> 07:04.080]  horticulturalist, I'm not a plant geneticist, I'm an avid gardener. I grew up as a gardener and I'm a microbiologist.
[07:04.080 --> 07:04.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[07:04.680 --> 07:11.280]  So I'm completely different. How many people actually get genetics, relatively speaking, to people that are doing genetics?
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.480]  I mean, you sound like you have some classical training. You do. You went to MSU, great university.
[07:15.480 --> 07:19.680]  Do most people understand it or how many people are just winging it?
[07:19.680 --> 07:24.880]  I would say probably 60% of them are winging it.
[07:24.880 --> 07:25.680]  Wow.
[07:25.680 --> 07:26.280]  Yeah.
[07:26.280 --> 07:27.280]  That's a big number.
[07:27.680 --> 07:34.680]  And not necessarily saying that they're winging it, just throwing pollen in their room, but they're not necessarily, you know,
[07:34.680 --> 07:42.880]  making a decision and crafting a experiment, if you will, you know, where they have a hypothesis like, okay, this is my male,
[07:42.880 --> 07:45.280]  this is my female, this is what I'm trying to get out of this.
[07:45.280 --> 07:50.880]  And then doing the experiment and following through on the conclusions by testing the progeny and really figuring out what you got.
[07:50.880 --> 07:56.680]  You know, a lot of these people will test stuff a couple times and, you know, they might put it out on the market.
[07:56.680 --> 08:02.080]  And typically you see people that are doing that, they will sell the seeds for cheaper.
[08:02.080 --> 08:03.080]  Yeah.
[08:03.080 --> 08:06.480]  You know, they're $40, $50 a pack on certain stuff.
[08:06.480 --> 08:12.880]  But, you know, we believe in our line and we've tested ours, you know, for three years consistently ourselves,
[08:12.880 --> 08:16.280]  as well as giving it out, you know, to our testers all around the country.
[08:16.280 --> 08:17.080]  Right.
[08:17.080 --> 08:18.880]  And they're getting the same results that we are.
[08:18.880 --> 08:23.880]  So we're confident, you know, in that we're seeing the same results over and over again.
[08:23.880 --> 08:31.880]  And so a gap in the, at least the adherence to an experimental design and the follow through of actually that rigorous data collection
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.880]  and that repetition from lineage to lineage to validate, you think that's the gap?
[08:36.880 --> 08:37.880]  Yeah, I do.
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.280]  And not necessarily that it's a gap because, you know, some of our most popular strains, you know, ChemDog,
[08:43.280 --> 08:45.880]  that was a bag seed, if you will, originally.
[08:45.880 --> 08:47.880]  And, you know, everybody knows that now.
[08:47.880 --> 08:51.280]  And so who's to say the next one couldn't be?
[08:51.280 --> 08:56.080]  It's definitely, you know, becoming saturated, you know, the entire gene pool overall.
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.480]  But that's exciting, you know, and that's where I think there will be new people that step in
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.880]  that could potentially introduce a species or a strain that no one's ever seen before,
[09:05.880 --> 09:11.480]  just in terms of its physical appearance or, you know, terpene profile or anything like that.
[09:11.480 --> 09:17.480]  So I think with the industry, yeah, growing the way that it is and all the new techniques that are being developed
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.280]  and strains that, yeah, people are trying to come up with, it definitely has the progress
[09:23.280 --> 09:26.680]  and I can see it continuing to progress for the next 10 years.
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.280]  So is there a ceiling on this for me?
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.880]  You know, I think there's a lot of overlap and we've progressed so far.
[09:33.880 --> 09:37.880]  How far will it go?
[09:37.880 --> 09:41.480]  At this point, I think there's really no limit, you know.
[09:41.480 --> 09:43.280]  We're still the innovators in this thing.
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.280]  You know, I don't even think we've really hit the growth stage yet.
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.080]  What's kind of a big statement compared to everything that's going on, relative to everything going on right now?
[09:51.080 --> 09:57.680]  That we have. I mean, think about, yeah, how many states still are, you know, not allowing us to do this.
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.080]  Fair enough. From a production, but I mean from a genetics and a diversity point of view,
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.680]  is there things that just haven't been tapped into yet?
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.080]  You know, I think there are and I think a lot of those traits that we may be looking for
[10:11.080 --> 10:15.280]  lie back in those land race heirloom varietals.
[10:15.280 --> 10:18.080]  You know, who's to say that, yeah, it couldn't come from something new,
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.880]  but I think a lot of the stuff that we're looking for or that was originally created,
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.280]  you know, on this planet by whatever that may be,
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.080]  you know, those are true genetics and those are true species, you know, at their core
[10:32.080 --> 10:34.280]  and you don't find a lot of that any longer.
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.280]  So, you know, I have a question that someone asked me again and I don't know, but we talked about genetics.
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.280]  I love talking about this topic because I'm not an expert in it.
[10:42.280 --> 10:46.280]  So everything I talk about and get information in is new kernels of knowledge.
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.080]  And so thanks for doing this. I have a question for you. How do you pick males?
[10:51.080 --> 10:57.280]  So selecting our males is pretty much how, you know, you would select a female
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.680]  in terms of you grow it start to finish. You have multiple clones of it.
[11:02.680 --> 11:05.880]  So you're going to run yours, select it, and then you're going to run it again.
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.080]  And that second run, you know, you can stress test them.
[11:09.080 --> 11:11.880]  You know, you can test for disease resistance.
[11:11.880 --> 11:15.880]  A lot of people, you know, they'll experience issues when they let their male go.
[11:15.880 --> 11:17.480]  It'll start to herm out on them at the end.
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.880]  And that's not necessarily an indicator of stability, you know, letting it run a long time.
[11:22.880 --> 11:25.880]  So really running your male start to finish.
[11:25.880 --> 11:28.880]  And then again, like I said, where you're looking for, you know, a stem rub
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.880]  or a certain leaf, you know, variation pattern around the leaf margin
[11:33.880 --> 11:36.880]  or just structure overall, you know, vigor.
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.880]  All those things come into the equation.
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.880]  It's kind of analyzing and, you know, making your best educated guess on what you deem the best.
[11:43.880 --> 11:46.880]  And then obviously, you know, you can get the plant tested as well
[11:46.880 --> 11:52.880]  at the end of its growth cycle to kind of determine an average percentage.
[11:52.880 --> 11:54.880]  That's actually really helpful for me.
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.880]  It's because I've always understood on females or certain traits at least.
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.880]  And a lot of people chase THC for a long time.
[12:01.880 --> 12:04.880]  And so I get that measuring trait.
[12:04.880 --> 12:08.880]  It seemed like it was harder for me to understand conceptually how to measure
[12:08.880 --> 12:11.880]  or what to want, what I would want to measure out of a male.
[12:11.880 --> 12:13.880]  We have high CBD farms.
[12:13.880 --> 12:16.880]  We use them for agriculture purposes, mostly for our inputs
[12:16.880 --> 12:22.880]  and looking at certain metrics of chemical constituents, CBD, cannabinoid in general, terpene,
[12:22.880 --> 12:25.880]  and then yield and growth and maybe rooting or whatever we're kind of targeting.
[12:25.880 --> 12:27.880]  But we don't have a breeding and we don't do that.
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.880]  It's more of agronomics and for growth patterns and different inputs, natural inputs
[12:33.880 --> 12:35.880]  because that's what our wheelhouse is.
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.880]  It makes sense to me that you could really do diligent stress tests,
[12:40.880 --> 12:46.880]  resilience tests on the males to make sure that you at least have some of those test resistance traits.
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.880]  Those are more easily conceptually measured in the males.
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.880]  And maybe structure and morphology, that's kind of what I heard.
[12:52.880 --> 12:56.880]  And the females, you want to couple that along with some nice characteristics
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.880]  of the flavor qualities and whatnot.
[12:58.880 --> 13:02.880]  Yeah, and then too, yeah, and then after you put that all together, you know,
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.880]  the final product is the mix of all that.
[13:05.880 --> 13:07.880]  And you're able to identify that and see that.
[13:07.880 --> 13:09.880]  And that's, yeah, that's what it's all about at the end.
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.880]  Would you measure terpenes or cannabinoids in a male?
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.880]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[13:13.880 --> 13:16.880]  That is actually, you know, one of the ways that we select males.
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.880]  We do stem rubs if one's more than the other or they may even be the same strain,
[13:21.880 --> 13:24.880]  but they do have a slightly different smell to them.
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.880]  And it's like, well, this one's more appealing than this, but this one might smell more, you know, prominently.
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.880]  Did they teach you the stem rub technique in school?
[13:33.880 --> 13:35.880]  No, they didn't.
[13:35.880 --> 13:36.880]  No.
[13:36.880 --> 13:37.880]  Good question.
[13:37.880 --> 13:40.880]  No, they did not, unfortunately, yeah.
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.880]  That's the whole school, that's the cannabis industry technique.
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.880]  Nomenclature, horticulture, go.
[13:47.880 --> 13:54.880]  So there's a lot of people, you know, that are classifying things as what they say they are.
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.880]  But when it really gets down to it.
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.880]  So in terms of, you know, felial generations or doing an inbred line or a back cross,
[14:02.880 --> 14:06.880]  I think nowadays people are trying to catch on to the lingo.
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.880]  It's something where, you know, I had learned it a long time ago,
[14:10.880 --> 14:12.880]  so it all kind of clicked for me and, you know,
[14:12.880 --> 14:15.880]  it made sense in terms of what we were trying to accomplish.
[14:15.880 --> 14:22.880]  And really it's something worth getting to know, you know, for every grower in the industry.
[14:22.880 --> 14:25.880]  So yeah, you can properly classify your plants.
[14:25.880 --> 14:27.880]  And, you know, if you're trying to sell your seed stock,
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.880]  especially being able to tell people exactly where it is in its breeding process,
[14:32.880 --> 14:36.880]  you know, first, second, third felial generation in.
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.880]  So we're talking F1, F2, F3, and that's a proper nomenclature for that first generation,
[14:42.880 --> 14:45.880]  second bred generation, third bred generation.
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.880]  And that would be having perhaps a static pollen donor with the reoccurring mother breeds
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.880]  and then taking seeds from that.
[14:53.880 --> 14:55.880]  And so you can work your way down and then, yeah,
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.880]  it depends on how you're looking to breed back and what your end goal is.
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.880]  You know, if you're looking to at the end ultimately create that inbred line
[15:03.880 --> 15:06.880]  that you've just been putting back into itself,
[15:06.880 --> 15:13.880]  or if you're looking to do an F1 or an F2 and then use something from there to do another project once,
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.880]  you know, if you feel that that plant that you're using is stable.
[15:18.880 --> 15:23.880]  And you better have a, it seems like you better have a real vision as a plant breeder
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.880]  because there's just a thousand directions you can go with any one generation.
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.880]  Yeah, and that's, it's just, you know, like anything, like if you're in the stock market
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.880]  or if you're starting a business, you know, really having a plan to put into action
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.880]  and following through on that and ensuring that everything is taken care of, you know,
[15:41.880 --> 15:45.880]  in the same manner and, you know, we grow and breed organically.
[15:45.880 --> 15:48.880]  So, you know, having microbes like what you guys do in the soil
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.880]  and having that symbiotic relationship is really key to ensure, you know,
[15:53.880 --> 15:55.880]  success from start to finish on everything.
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.880]  And so that's where we feel a lot of our really good germination rates come in.
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.880]  You know, we're near 99% on all of our germination rates, you know,
[16:04.880 --> 16:06.880]  male to female ratios are about 50-50.
[16:06.880 --> 16:09.880]  And then typically with our phenotypic ratios, we'll see a three to one
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.880]  and that three to one I'm basing that on color specifically.
[16:13.880 --> 16:18.880]  So the dominant color gene came through from our male.
[16:18.880 --> 16:21.880]  So more likely than not, you're going to get something that's a dark purple
[16:21.880 --> 16:23.880]  as compared to a green.
[16:23.880 --> 16:24.880]  But at this...
[16:24.880 --> 16:25.880]  It's a probability game.
[16:25.880 --> 16:27.880]  Right, exactly, yep.
[16:27.880 --> 16:32.880]  And then, you know, with our females, a lot of them had a dominant terpene trait.
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.880]  And so that was able to carry on down that lineage, whereas the peanut butter breath male
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.880]  that we used, it had a recessive gene for terpene.
[16:42.880 --> 16:45.880]  So that was the less dominant, and that wouldn't carry down.
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.880]  And so, yeah, like I said, it's neat to see the creations come together, you know,
[16:49.880 --> 16:55.880]  at different stages, different generations, and see, okay, this is what's here.
[16:55.880 --> 16:57.880]  Where do we want to go with it now?
[16:57.880 --> 17:02.880]  You know, I spend a lot of time in Europe, and they talk about feminized seeds a lot.
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.880]  And you can chemically feminize seeds, and it's a very common practice.
[17:06.880 --> 17:08.880]  And seed's a big business.
[17:08.880 --> 17:11.880]  It's a souvenir business in Europe.
[17:11.880 --> 17:14.880]  You know, that's the legal terms for selling seeds.
[17:14.880 --> 17:16.880]  I don't understand.
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.880]  Maybe I should, but I just don't...
[17:18.880 --> 17:19.880]  How...
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.880]  Is that bad for the ultimate plant, or is it just reverting in a safe, stable way?
[17:24.880 --> 17:26.880]  I want to hear your opinion on it.
[17:26.880 --> 17:34.880]  So with feminized seeds, essentially what you're doing is you are creating a mutation
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.880]  within the chromosome.
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.880]  So you're essentially creating a triploid, which is a mutation in chromosomal binding
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.880]  that is caused by the application of like a colloidal silver product or something like that,
[17:46.880 --> 17:49.880]  thus giving you a feminized seed.
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.880]  And so by not allowing that chromosome to bind, it's guaranteed that it's female,
[17:56.880 --> 17:59.880]  but it could also create instabilities down the road, potentially.
[17:59.880 --> 18:00.880]  You know, that's just nature.
[18:00.880 --> 18:03.880]  I mean, there are transgendered people in the world.
[18:03.880 --> 18:05.880]  You know, it's not an uncommon thing.
[18:05.880 --> 18:06.880]  It's the same with plants.
[18:06.880 --> 18:09.880]  We're very similar to them in terms of our genetic code and our breakdown.
[18:09.880 --> 18:15.880]  And so for a true breeding program, you would recommend not doing that because of the introduction?
[18:15.880 --> 18:18.880]  Or do you feel that it's not that big of a deal?
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.880]  Well, I think it depends on your application.
[18:20.880 --> 18:23.880]  You know, if you were ever going to try to do a breeding project,
[18:23.880 --> 18:25.880]  you wouldn't want to use anything feminized.
[18:25.880 --> 18:28.880]  It wouldn't, you know, be worth even trying it.
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.880]  Got it.
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.880]  But for people who are getting into this, a lot of people want an easy route.
[18:33.880 --> 18:35.880]  And, you know, it's just like the auto flower thing.
[18:35.880 --> 18:38.880]  A lot of people shy away from that and don't want anything to do with it.
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.880]  But there are other people that swear by it because it works for them.
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.880]  So I think really at the end of the day, it just kind of comes down to what you want to do as a grower.
[18:46.880 --> 18:55.880]  And the creation of feminized seeds, it's essentially, yeah, a colloidal silver, which is a natural compound.
[18:55.880 --> 18:56.880]  I mean, you can drink it.
[18:56.880 --> 19:02.880]  Obviously, you probably wouldn't want to consume the flowers after colloidal silver has been sprayed on it.
[19:02.880 --> 19:11.880]  But in the end, I think if you're, you know, following your initial intention and applying it at the proper times
[19:11.880 --> 19:17.880]  and really watching your plants develop and determining when is the right maturation time for you to call it
[19:17.880 --> 19:23.880]  and, you know, start drying your seeds and properly, you know, creating the seed,
[19:23.880 --> 19:28.880]  then there's really no health risks, I would say, associated with, you know,
[19:28.880 --> 19:31.880]  the seed directly and that plant that would be grown from that seed.
[19:31.880 --> 19:34.880]  Got it. Awesome. That's really helpful. I appreciate that.
[19:34.880 --> 19:35.880]  Yeah, no problem.
[19:35.880 --> 19:37.880]  You know, I actually have another question. I keep on thinking about things.
[19:37.880 --> 19:41.880]  All this is new. So at some point we're going to get shut down.
[19:41.880 --> 19:51.880]  But while we're still on, you know, we talk about in Colorado the lack of genetics for hemp farms where, you know,
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.880]  a lot of the genetics there, they're marketed as legal and you can grow them,
[19:55.880 --> 20:01.880]  but then they end up going hot and you have to be at the 0.3% THC or lower to be within that realm.
[20:01.880 --> 20:06.880]  And so that's a big opportunity. And right now, I guess the only way people are getting around it,
[20:06.880 --> 20:08.880]  and it's still challenging, is buying clones.
[20:08.880 --> 20:13.880]  Is there a near term future where there are going to be seeds?
[20:13.880 --> 20:16.880]  And this is a two part question that comply.
[20:16.880 --> 20:20.880]  And, you know, one of the challenges I think is when you get down to that low of THC,
[20:21.880 --> 20:29.880]  you really compromise other cannabinoid development where you can have a 0.7% THC strain
[20:29.880 --> 20:35.880]  and have in the high teens CBD or other cannabinoid, you know, CBD, relative abundances.
[20:35.880 --> 20:43.880]  And if you cut that down for every tenth of a percent, you really decrease the amount of CBD production.
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.880]  Right.
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.880]  Is there, is that a real correlation? And where's the line?
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.880]  Do you think that's just a lack of breeding, lack of effort, or is there a real limitation there?
[20:57.880 --> 21:00.880]  You know, yes and no.
[21:00.880 --> 21:11.880]  I think it's something where there is the potential to, you know, create through breeding a strain that is stable
[21:11.880 --> 21:17.880]  and will consistently be below the threshold, but also there is genetic variation
[21:17.880 --> 21:25.880]  and there is that chance for a gene to, you know, put it above that 0.3.
[21:25.880 --> 21:30.880]  And so with, I think, all of the stuff that's going on right now, you know,
[21:30.880 --> 21:37.880]  really focusing in on getting a certified seed to start with is what's going to be the most beneficial
[21:37.880 --> 21:41.880]  as compared to going, you know, through any Joe online that has hemp seed that says,
[21:41.880 --> 21:44.880]  hey, this is what the cross is, you know.
[21:44.880 --> 21:50.880]  But I know they've been doing it in Europe and Canada for a very long time.
[21:50.880 --> 21:58.880]  And I feel like those regions are going to be the areas that we're looking to going forward,
[21:58.880 --> 22:02.880]  you know, more so than Colorado and California, you know, they're new.
[22:02.880 --> 22:04.880]  And everyone is just getting into it there.
[22:04.880 --> 22:11.880]  And these guys have been doing it for, yeah, damn near 100 years or longer over across the ocean.
[22:11.880 --> 22:13.880]  You know, do you think there's a big difference?
[22:13.880 --> 22:16.880]  You know, China is the number one producer of hemp, as an example.
[22:16.880 --> 22:20.880]  We'll call it just low THC cannabis.
[22:20.880 --> 22:26.880]  But it's mostly bred for, I think, fiber and rarely bred for its amount of seed production
[22:26.880 --> 22:30.880]  or quality of nourished seed because that could be an interesting food source.
[22:30.880 --> 22:35.880]  Or obviously for flower and extraction purposes.
[22:35.880 --> 22:39.880]  And so if you find most of the certified seed in Colorado, as an example,
[22:39.880 --> 22:42.880]  they're certified, but they're certified under a fiber.
[22:42.880 --> 22:50.880]  And a couple are certified under a seed, but none are really certified as a strong producer for extract cannabinoids.
[22:50.880 --> 22:54.880]  And I think that's interesting, I think mostly because those have come from Europe.
[22:54.880 --> 22:59.880]  Do you see that changing in the near future where we're going to have really strong strains
[22:59.880 --> 23:03.880]  that are certified for CBD production and extraction?
[23:03.880 --> 23:06.880]  I really hope so.
[23:06.880 --> 23:12.880]  And, yeah, with the way that the industry is going, I think there's a lot of potential for that to take place.
[23:12.880 --> 23:18.880]  And now that they're letting us do this legally, you know, there's going to be a lot more closet scientists
[23:18.880 --> 23:23.880]  and people that want to experiment and learn and really, you know, figure this out
[23:23.880 --> 23:29.880]  and figure out what the best way is to utilize this resource for our future going forward.
[23:29.880 --> 23:36.880]  And I think it's a beautiful thing, and I think we will definitely see that from companies here in the next couple years.
[23:36.880 --> 23:43.880]  They're going to start coming out with products that are superior to others, or what is the current status quo.
[23:43.880 --> 23:50.790]  CBD or THC a bigger market in the next five years?
[23:50.790 --> 23:51.790]  CBD.
[23:51.790 --> 23:52.790]  You think so?
[23:52.790 --> 23:53.790]  For the next five years.
[23:53.790 --> 23:59.790]  I think everyone's trying to hop on that train right now and get involved with it in one way or the other.
[23:59.790 --> 24:03.790]  But, you know, for our industry, obviously THC is the game,
[24:03.790 --> 24:06.790]  and I think there's a spot for those two circles to overlap in the middle,
[24:06.790 --> 24:11.790]  and there's going to be a huge market that's interested in finding that golden ratio, you know,
[24:11.790 --> 24:16.790]  that one-to-one where they're really getting the relief that they need from the products that they're consuming.
[24:16.790 --> 24:19.790]  You know, I used to say this a lot, and I think I still believe this.
[24:19.790 --> 24:25.790]  There's this THC customer-based market, and it's not going anywhere, and it's huge.
[24:25.790 --> 24:31.790]  But then there's this CBD market that might encompass everyone else on earth
[24:31.790 --> 24:35.790]  that might not necessarily be interested in the THC aspects of cannabis,
[24:35.790 --> 24:39.790]  but the CBD aspects are even for your pets.
[24:39.790 --> 24:42.790]  The healing aspect is incredible, and THC is a part of that,
[24:42.790 --> 24:47.790]  but it's not as much of a psychoactive as it is an activator component
[24:47.790 --> 24:49.790]  where we know we need a little bit of THC.
[24:49.790 --> 24:51.790]  I think that's right. That's what we all think.
[24:51.790 --> 24:54.790]  Yeah. Have a little activation in there.
[24:54.790 --> 24:55.790]  Yeah.
[24:56.790 --> 25:01.790]  Auto flower is coming into the U.S. market.
[25:01.790 --> 25:05.790]  Are you guys breeding any auto flower strains, or what are your thoughts on...
[25:05.790 --> 25:08.790]  At this point, we're staying away from ruderalis.
[25:08.790 --> 25:10.790]  We're... yeah.
[25:10.790 --> 25:13.790]  We said we weren't going to do feminized,
[25:13.790 --> 25:16.790]  and we're finishing a feminized project right now, actually.
[25:16.790 --> 25:21.790]  We're doing a one-to-one CBD-THC cross with mousse cookies
[25:21.790 --> 25:23.790]  that was bred by Light Sky Farms,
[25:23.790 --> 25:26.790]  and we're crossing that to a lot of our strains and mothers
[25:26.790 --> 25:30.790]  that have proven themselves to us over the years.
[25:30.790 --> 25:33.790]  So we're excited about that, and that line will be released
[25:33.790 --> 25:36.790]  in probably about five to six months.
[25:36.790 --> 25:38.790]  We've got testing and stuff like that to finish up,
[25:38.790 --> 25:42.790]  and checking in with people, and putting our brains together
[25:42.790 --> 25:45.790]  and being like, all right, let's look at the data on this.
[25:45.790 --> 25:47.790]  How's it looking?
[25:47.790 --> 25:54.790]  But that is something where, you know, people want the auto flowers too.
[25:54.790 --> 25:56.790]  They don't want to mess with the time change.
[25:56.790 --> 25:58.790]  People want it easy.
[25:58.790 --> 26:00.790]  And so some aren't willing to do the work, and some are.
[26:00.790 --> 26:02.790]  And I think the ones that are willing to do the work
[26:02.790 --> 26:05.790]  and really put in the time to get to know their plants
[26:05.790 --> 26:07.790]  and the genetics that they're working with
[26:07.790 --> 26:11.790]  are going to be the ones reaping those benefits a little bit more in the end
[26:11.790 --> 26:16.790]  in terms of quality, yields, and just overall performance of their plants.
[26:16.790 --> 26:22.790]  It seems like the auto flower phenomenon in Europe has been very strong,
[26:22.790 --> 26:24.790]  and that's actually starting to fade away,
[26:24.790 --> 26:28.790]  where people are realizing they want the non-ruteralis versions of cannabis.
[26:28.790 --> 26:31.790]  And so I see that with a lot of the people that I work with over there.
[26:31.790 --> 26:33.790]  And it's funny to see this drifting in here,
[26:33.790 --> 26:35.790]  something that's kind of fading out of Europe,
[26:35.790 --> 26:38.790]  thinking that the United States non-version is cooler,
[26:38.790 --> 26:41.790]  and then the U.S. is adopting some of it.
[26:41.790 --> 26:45.790]  And I think no matter what I've heard, people that grow auto flowers,
[26:45.790 --> 26:50.790]  there's something about the ruteralis that you can sense across all the auto flowering strains
[26:50.790 --> 26:52.790]  and it kind of ties it together, which makes sense,
[26:52.790 --> 26:55.790]  but it might not be as desirable for some people.
[26:55.790 --> 26:57.790]  That's the kind of feedback I've got.
[26:57.790 --> 26:59.790]  And I think, yeah, just what you said,
[26:59.790 --> 27:03.790]  and it just comes down to what your growing style is, you know, what works for you.
[27:03.790 --> 27:07.790]  How much time do you have to devote to looking at them every day and watering them
[27:07.790 --> 27:12.790]  and, you know, what product are you looking for at the end of it all, too.
