[00:00.250 --> 00:03.890]  All right, take two.
[00:03.890 --> 00:09.010]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and we got a really freaking special show for you
[00:09.010 --> 00:10.010]  today.
[00:10.010 --> 00:14.090]  So without any further ado, I'm going to take my technically challenged ass and get out
[00:14.090 --> 00:17.650]  of this room and turn it over to the hosts, Brian and Marco.
[00:17.650 --> 00:19.330]  Take it away, guys.
[00:19.330 --> 00:20.330]  Yeah.
[00:20.330 --> 00:21.330]  Happy Wednesday to you guys.
[00:21.330 --> 00:23.810]  You know, Living Soil nerds, we apologize.
[00:23.810 --> 00:28.570]  We were over, I guess, in another atmosphere just talking to each other for a while.
[00:28.570 --> 00:32.090]  So like you said, take two on this.
[00:32.090 --> 00:35.690]  A few things have happened, obviously, for this show to happen today.
[00:35.690 --> 00:39.170]  One of those organic Alexa, just wanted to give a shout out to her.
[00:39.170 --> 00:42.450]  She was our guest today and unfortunately she fell ill.
[00:42.450 --> 00:46.050]  So we just wanted to, you know, reach out to her that hopefully we can have her back
[00:46.050 --> 00:50.450]  on the show because I feel like, again, we're just trying to get a lot of diverse individuals
[00:50.450 --> 00:56.650]  to come on the show, learn from those, you know, experiments, mistakes and that kind
[00:56.650 --> 00:59.090]  of stuff and move forward.
[00:59.090 --> 01:03.570]  One of the people that I've learned from, I feel like for a long time is our special
[01:03.570 --> 01:04.770]  guest today.
[01:04.770 --> 01:09.330]  Somebody that I obviously admire and I have no shame in doing so, Duke Diamond.
[01:09.330 --> 01:13.370]  I did want to start off the show real quick with just this fundraiser that we were able
[01:13.370 --> 01:15.690]  to have because of Peter, because of the platform.
[01:15.690 --> 01:22.610]  Duke, unfortunately, when you were away, obviously COVID hit, man, and the channel blew up for
[01:22.610 --> 01:23.610]  Peter.
[01:23.610 --> 01:25.850]  And I feel like he put in a ton of work to be able to get to this point.
[01:26.050 --> 01:29.770]  And now obviously things are growing where we have Chad, just a lot of more shows coming
[01:29.770 --> 01:30.770]  on.
[01:30.770 --> 01:34.690]  I remember at the beginning, I think it was in 2020, Peter was talking about how he wanted
[01:34.690 --> 01:38.850]  this to kind of be like the ESPN of cannabis.
[01:38.850 --> 01:40.810]  And I think he's really starting to achieve that goal.
[01:40.810 --> 01:45.370]  So this is going to be a real treat, I feel like, for the more and more people that are
[01:45.370 --> 01:49.830]  starting to understand cannabis that might not necessarily have kind of seen the way
[01:49.830 --> 01:53.930]  things have shaped in a long time, especially the last few years.
[01:54.010 --> 01:56.850]  A lot of things have changed pretty dramatically.
[01:56.850 --> 02:00.690]  So I did want to get, you know, obviously shout out to Peter and the platform, putting
[02:00.690 --> 02:01.930]  things together.
[02:01.930 --> 02:07.290]  Propane Jane, Miss Montana behind the scenes, just kind of being the glue sometimes to make
[02:07.290 --> 02:10.010]  sure that things were correct.
[02:10.010 --> 02:14.130]  And then I want to give a super special shout out to Robbie with Nerd Genetics.
[02:14.130 --> 02:16.330]  I feel like that dude always holds it down.
[02:16.330 --> 02:19.690]  He's definitely one of those that's a real one.
[02:19.690 --> 02:22.690]  That's something that I feel like Duke, a lot of people use when they describe you,
[02:22.690 --> 02:23.690]  sir.
[02:24.450 --> 02:26.650]  You're a real one and that's all they really have to say about you, because I feel like
[02:26.650 --> 02:35.450]  then your reputation and the way you carry yourself really handles and goes a long way.
[02:35.450 --> 02:40.610]  Like I was saying before the take two with this, I kind of really got into that because
[02:40.610 --> 02:44.570]  the way you carry yourself, man, the way that things are, that's how people would respect
[02:44.570 --> 02:45.710]  one another.
[02:45.710 --> 02:47.910]  And that is lost, especially in these last few years.
[02:47.910 --> 02:52.490]  So I feel like, again, we want to have a platform where we can talk to people that are true
[02:52.530 --> 02:53.530]  to their word.
[02:53.530 --> 02:57.370]  And the last person I really want to thank throughout, especially these last few months
[02:57.370 --> 02:58.370]  is Sticky Lungs.
[02:58.370 --> 03:03.610]  That's another dude that just is always tried and true, always coming through on it for
[03:03.610 --> 03:05.050]  a variety of individuals.
[03:05.050 --> 03:09.690]  So just wanted to start that out, man, because there's a lot of bullshit going on, kind of
[03:09.690 --> 03:10.690]  hate.
[03:10.690 --> 03:13.650]  There was even some bullshit that I saw with Emerald Cup.
[03:13.650 --> 03:15.010]  I kind of wanted to take it there.
[03:15.010 --> 03:21.890]  But then at the same time, I kind of wanted to explain why I feel like, Duke, you're going
[03:22.290 --> 03:27.930]  places on a high, on another level, because you were able to explain things to the community
[03:27.930 --> 03:30.450]  for a long time before you went away.
[03:30.450 --> 03:33.170]  And that is not forgotten among the community.
[03:33.170 --> 03:36.970]  You've been on a variety of other podcasts, and I feel like there's a lot of things to
[03:36.970 --> 03:38.370]  learn from that.
[03:38.370 --> 03:40.890]  And I hope that we're going to be able to dive deeper into that.
[03:40.890 --> 03:44.770]  I'm also excited to officially introduce you to my co-host, Marco.
[03:44.770 --> 03:50.170]  I feel like Marco is another one of those that carries himself as kind of like the old
[03:50.170 --> 03:51.770]  school thinking individual.
[03:51.770 --> 03:57.450]  I know OG is super overplayed now, but just somebody that carries himself in a way that
[03:57.450 --> 04:02.770]  I feel like other people will begin to respect because it is genuine and it is giving.
[04:02.770 --> 04:05.610]  And that is something that, Duke, I feel like you're famous for, man.
[04:05.610 --> 04:11.290]  And it's just it's going to be exciting for the community that might not necessarily have
[04:11.290 --> 04:17.930]  heard of your work or have heard of your story to see from another example of there's not
[04:17.930 --> 04:22.450]  too many of you and certain people like you that it seems like is left.
[04:22.450 --> 04:26.130]  So I feel like we need to have more of a voice in the community.
[04:26.130 --> 04:29.370]  And it feels like there's a fork in the road for a lot of that kind of stuff.
[04:29.370 --> 04:33.890]  Do we kind of carry on certain traditions and things in the way that we carried ourselves?
[04:33.890 --> 04:37.770]  Or do we all try to play one another and tell on one another?
[04:37.770 --> 04:43.770]  And the other stuff is kind of reveal certain things that maybe you were true boys back
[04:43.770 --> 04:46.290]  in the day or something. So they know something really personal about you.
[04:46.330 --> 04:49.650]  And then something happens and they run and tell everybody about that.
[04:50.130 --> 04:51.250]  I just didn't see that.
[04:51.250 --> 04:56.290]  I know that maybe this is more us being more Southerners.
[04:56.290 --> 04:59.770]  Maybe there's more like the word is your bond compared to other parts of the country.
[04:59.770 --> 05:01.370]  I could totally see that.
[05:01.610 --> 05:04.450]  But it seems like it's eroding nationwide.
[05:04.450 --> 05:10.210]  So one of the things I want to talk about was, you know, to start the show is Emerald
[05:10.210 --> 05:14.890]  Cutter. I feel like when you first went out there in 2017, that was kind of like your
[05:14.970 --> 05:16.050]  Cinderella moment.
[05:16.090 --> 05:19.730]  I just kind of wanted to start there and then dive into a lot of things.
[05:20.130 --> 05:22.530]  Shout out to another podcast, The Dunn Show.
[05:22.530 --> 05:25.130]  I have, you know, we've all heard you on there on a few times.
[05:25.130 --> 05:30.250]  And before we were able to get on this live and officially running here, Chad and I were
[05:30.250 --> 05:32.130]  talking about a gentleman named Mitch Sanasa.
[05:32.370 --> 05:36.930]  And I feel like he was somebody that really took the time to kind of in the interview,
[05:36.930 --> 05:43.970]  especially with with yourself and others, really break things down and then break it
[05:43.970 --> 05:45.130]  down for the layman, basically.
[05:45.290 --> 05:48.010]  That is the one thing that I feel like you're really able to do, man.
[05:48.370 --> 05:52.810]  And without doing it with like, you know, going out of your way to use big words to
[05:52.810 --> 05:54.610]  make yourself sound cool or look cool.
[05:55.170 --> 05:58.250]  That's just something that I know that you don't give a fuck about, man.
[05:58.450 --> 06:03.210]  And I'm just excited that we're going to be able to talk about that from from a general
[06:03.210 --> 06:04.970]  standpoint. So let's talk about it.
[06:04.970 --> 06:10.050]  Definitely. Before we get too far into it, man, I want to jump in and say, man, just
[06:10.490 --> 06:12.410]  what's up, dude? Nice to meet you, brother.
[06:12.530 --> 06:15.290]  Finally, I heard lots of stuff about you.
[06:15.290 --> 06:20.050]  And I think that a lot of what Brian's talking about, man, I didn't know you were from
[06:20.050 --> 06:24.570]  Virginia, brother. I was kind of been doing my thing and my own little dungeon coming
[06:24.570 --> 06:27.330]  out now and meeting all these great people, man.
[06:27.330 --> 06:31.170]  And you're a name that a lot of folks have a ton of respect for.
[06:31.170 --> 06:34.570]  And, you know, to find out you're from V.A., man, you know, V.A.
[06:34.570 --> 06:36.610]  don't play, but we're very respectful.
[06:36.610 --> 06:38.890]  We're very we approach you very easy.
[06:39.210 --> 06:41.730]  And and we and we take it from there.
[06:42.570 --> 06:43.730]  So, yeah, man, awesome.
[06:43.730 --> 06:45.410]  Awesome to have this talk with you, bro.
[06:45.410 --> 06:48.010]  And I'm looking forward to this here and what you got to say.
[06:48.490 --> 06:50.770]  Yeah, it's great. Great to meet you, too, man.
[06:50.770 --> 06:55.250]  And I always used to people like, man, y'all so laid back.
[06:55.250 --> 06:56.490]  I'm like, yeah, we're laid back.
[06:56.490 --> 06:58.050]  We're chill until we're not.
[06:58.570 --> 07:03.650]  So like, you know, we're real cool, you know, but people, you know, fuck around, put us
[07:03.650 --> 07:09.010]  in that position. It's like get a zero to one hundred real quick, real rowdy, real quick,
[07:09.610 --> 07:13.730]  real rowdy. But yeah, that's, you know, that's a good good way.
[07:14.650 --> 07:16.210]  Good way to be for sure, man.
[07:16.770 --> 07:22.170]  And, you know, all the people that helped out during that time, like I said, Profane
[07:22.170 --> 07:28.130]  Jane, nerds, you know, Robbie at Nerds and all the other folks who made it happen.
[07:28.130 --> 07:29.530]  I can't thank you enough.
[07:30.050 --> 07:36.250]  And so those are real, real people, you know, and that's what, you know, ideally, like
[07:36.690 --> 07:39.770]  you try to surround yourself by.
[07:40.130 --> 07:44.930]  It's crazy. Like I got this one guy who will not stop DMing, like literally every 10
[07:44.930 --> 07:49.730]  seconds. I got like a window that literally pops up right here in front of my eyes.
[07:50.210 --> 07:53.570]  And it's like, Jesus, man, please just give me a moment.
[07:53.770 --> 07:55.890]  Pretty please trying to do this thing.
[07:56.730 --> 07:58.410]  But yeah.
[07:58.410 --> 08:00.290]  So, yeah.
[08:00.890 --> 08:08.410]  And I guess like talking about like Emerald Cup evolution, right?
[08:10.410 --> 08:17.450]  Things are always changing, especially in the world, the world that we live in.
[08:18.810 --> 08:23.770]  I even hate seeing industry, but in one regard or another, like you're you got to be
[08:23.770 --> 08:26.730]  involved with it, even if it's like from the outside.
[08:26.890 --> 08:34.210]  Like no matter what, like you're associated with it in one one regard or another.
[08:34.210 --> 08:38.810]  So even if it's just, you know, observing what's going on around you.
[08:38.890 --> 08:45.130]  So. As far as like how it evolved, like I was super stoked to go to the first one
[08:45.130 --> 08:51.250]  because I know people who had been involved in it, gone to it, the great people, the
[08:51.250 --> 08:52.490]  vibe and everything.
[08:52.730 --> 08:54.730]  And I was like, yeah, well, it's really cool.
[08:54.730 --> 09:01.450]  Like that's what I like to be around, you know, and, you know, we always we try to
[09:01.450 --> 09:03.490]  surround ourselves with good, solid people.
[09:03.770 --> 09:07.970]  And, you know, these people are, you know, bringing you bringing you into their little
[09:07.970 --> 09:14.490]  gig. So I go and it was exactly exactly what what I thought it was and what I was told
[09:14.490 --> 09:17.170]  it was. And it was awesome thing.
[09:17.370 --> 09:19.050]  It was awesome thing to be a part of.
[09:19.050 --> 09:20.370]  Awesome thing to see.
[09:22.890 --> 09:28.170]  That, if I'm not mistaken, that was the year that they were that they were trying to do
[09:29.570 --> 09:32.490]  the recreation legalization there.
[09:33.370 --> 09:36.130]  And that's when it all hit the fan, man.
[09:36.130 --> 09:40.450]  Like you start getting money and things like that involved with anything.
[09:40.450 --> 09:45.290]  It tends to it tends to ruin a good intentions, go away.
[09:45.690 --> 09:53.050]  Greed will kind of take over and it starts to happen on the most basic of levels, like
[09:53.050 --> 09:58.330]  people that were down, really down as fuck, making things happen.
[09:58.690 --> 10:00.290]  They see their opportunity.
[10:00.290 --> 10:07.330]  And I mean, I hate to use the words like a sellout, but I mean, there's really there's no
[10:07.330 --> 10:09.250]  other other way to describe it.
[10:09.650 --> 10:10.610]  They go for it.
[10:11.330 --> 10:15.850]  Some people say cash in, sell out, tomato, tomato, whatever.
[10:16.210 --> 10:23.090]  So they join that other team and that other team, when you start dealing with large
[10:23.090 --> 10:30.690]  corporations and certain certain individuals of money that are looking to get get into
[10:30.690 --> 10:33.890]  things, they they fight differently.
[10:34.290 --> 10:40.330]  So where we might be used to throwing hands and pulling guns or something like that.
[10:40.810 --> 10:42.410]  They pull contracts, lawyers.
[10:42.410 --> 10:49.890]  They spend mass amounts of money lobbying, buying people, buying influence, if you will,
[10:51.130 --> 10:58.050]  politically and marketing even on the most basic level to the end user and get them on
[10:58.050 --> 11:03.250]  board. And a lot of that shit goes on behind the scenes and don't even, you know, the
[11:03.250 --> 11:07.290]  average person, they don't they don't fucking know, you know, so they're in the dark.
[11:07.290 --> 11:09.770]  And then you start seeing these changes happen.
[11:10.770 --> 11:17.730]  Um. So like when I left, like if I were to say and which I did, you know, I was pretty
[11:17.730 --> 11:20.170]  vocal about is like, oh, these people are trying to fuck you.
[11:20.490 --> 11:21.330]  Oh, no, no, no.
[11:21.330 --> 11:25.130]  You don't understand. Like, bro, I literally read this whole thing.
[11:25.130 --> 11:30.010]  Like, you know, like you're talking about, you know, nobody's going to prison anymore.
[11:30.010 --> 11:34.890]  And it's like, in fact, like Med versus like the new law that was being pushed through
[11:34.890 --> 11:36.450]  is like you're going to get in more trouble.
[11:36.490 --> 11:41.570]  So, you know, you know, there's just a whole lot of a lot of bullshit going on.
[11:42.170 --> 11:44.930]  So, you know, I'm not I'm not from Cali.
[11:44.930 --> 11:45.850]  I didn't live in Cali.
[11:45.850 --> 11:52.330]  So, you know, you have a lot of people putting putting the word out there and trying to
[11:52.330 --> 11:56.050]  educate people, people that are fighting against it and everything.
[11:56.410 --> 11:59.410]  And then you had people that were indifferent and then you had the opposite, you know.
[11:59.890 --> 12:02.210]  So when is that going down?
[12:02.210 --> 12:04.850]  Is it goes through.
[12:06.410 --> 12:08.130]  And then twenty eighteen.
[12:08.890 --> 12:12.090]  So going back out there now, it's all taxation.
[12:13.050 --> 12:18.810]  I had to stop and me at the gate, me like, you can't bring bring any weed in here.
[12:18.810 --> 12:23.970]  I was like, you're telling me I can't bring weed into the weed show.
[12:24.530 --> 12:26.170]  I'm a vendor. I'm not selling the weed.
[12:26.610 --> 12:28.490]  You're telling me I can't have any weed with me.
[12:28.810 --> 12:31.330]  And it's legal, right?
[12:32.330 --> 12:33.930]  OK, that's all fucked up.
[12:34.410 --> 12:39.370]  So I'm like looking over at my boy, like, yeah, we got to we got to make this happen.
[12:39.690 --> 12:43.050]  So I'm like pulling out my knife and me like, well, I guess you got a problem with this big
[12:43.050 --> 12:46.930]  bastard, too. And, you know, like halfway making a scene and getting all the guards
[12:46.930 --> 12:49.130]  attention at the same time.
[12:49.130 --> 12:53.650]  He's stealing a golf cart and loading our shit up and running around the back gate and
[12:53.650 --> 12:54.810]  getting our shit in anyway.
[12:55.610 --> 12:59.170]  So I was like right off the bat, we're starting on a bad note.
[13:00.090 --> 13:06.330]  And then just seeing the the influences that were just it was just a whole different
[13:06.330 --> 13:09.090]  vibe, a whole different ballgame after.
[13:10.410 --> 13:16.810]  After that, you know, I think I was supposed to be I was supposed to be on a panel with
[13:16.810 --> 13:23.290]  a bunch of people, and I was also supposed to be on like an individual interview or
[13:23.290 --> 13:30.130]  whatever. When it was like time and I guess, you know, I was pretty, pretty vocal about
[13:30.130 --> 13:34.690]  what I what I thought, you know, not really vocal, but like, you know, you ask me what I
[13:34.690 --> 13:35.970]  think I'm going to tell you.
[13:36.530 --> 13:39.650]  And I thought it was fucked up and I'm going to say that.
[13:40.130 --> 13:46.810]  So they they were like, yeah, I guess the one panel was going to be talking about like
[13:46.810 --> 13:48.210]  the new laws and what you think.
[13:48.530 --> 13:50.570]  So they're like, yeah, we don't want this guy.
[13:50.570 --> 13:52.170]  So last minute they pull me off.
[13:52.730 --> 13:54.090]  They replaced me with a chat.
[13:54.490 --> 13:57.410]  And then the other interviews like, yeah, you're not doing that either.
[13:57.410 --> 13:59.610]  So we're just going to fill that spot with somebody else.
[13:59.610 --> 14:02.610]  So right then and there, I'm like, OK, all right.
[14:02.650 --> 14:05.770]  Like, whatever. Like this is the last time I'm coming anyway.
[14:05.770 --> 14:09.130]  Like I just saw it was it was like my mind's my mind's pretty much made up.
[14:09.810 --> 14:16.490]  So toward the end, we went to this thing like where they were talking.
[14:16.490 --> 14:20.370]  They had the slideshow up and it was a such fucking bullshit.
[14:20.370 --> 14:25.810]  And it was like. So again, like the same people that are talking to the same people that
[14:25.810 --> 14:30.250]  are in like, you know, pushing these laws through and trying to sell it is like nobody's
[14:30.250 --> 14:35.610]  ever going to go to prison anymore over it and this and that is such bullshit.
[14:35.650 --> 14:37.730]  And I was like, oh, my God, it's fucking bullshit.
[14:37.970 --> 14:39.250]  And I'm good.
[14:39.690 --> 14:45.050]  Done. You know, so that then and there, 2018, I was I was sold on it.
[14:45.090 --> 14:46.250]  I was good. So
[14:46.890 --> 14:49.050]  20, you know, I don't know.
[14:49.250 --> 14:50.570]  I'm sure it didn't get any better.
[14:50.930 --> 14:53.690]  And then everybody's talking about 2021.
[14:53.690 --> 14:59.690]  You got these dudes with compliance running around taking people's weed, you know, just
[14:59.690 --> 15:01.010]  hassling people and shit.
[15:01.530 --> 15:06.090]  And, you know, on the smaller scales, they're like, yeah, they wiped out the small time
[15:06.090 --> 15:11.410]  people. I mean, that's it was already seen years ago.
[15:11.410 --> 15:14.330]  And now, you know, it's just it's all come into fruition.
[15:14.850 --> 15:19.010]  So it started and it was such a great thing.
[15:19.010 --> 15:21.730]  And I mean, personally, I mean, this is my opinion.
[15:21.730 --> 15:28.450]  Like it's it's not anything I want to be involved with, you know, so that's just that's
[15:28.450 --> 15:35.890]  the evolution of recreational and money and and and what what ends up coming out in the
[15:35.890 --> 15:39.690]  wash. So, you know, there was a lot of people very vocal about it.
[15:40.090 --> 15:43.530]  Right. But on the same note, we live in this culture.
[15:43.530 --> 15:47.170]  Like if you speak out on anything, all your hateful, all as harsh vibes or whatever, it's
[15:47.170 --> 15:48.850]  like, no, motherfuckers, God damn truth.
[15:49.330 --> 15:53.090]  Right. If you want to stick your fucking head in the sand and not paying attention to it
[15:53.810 --> 15:57.490]  year, two, three years down the road when all your shit's taken from you and there's
[15:57.490 --> 15:59.370]  nothing left, don't fucking complain.
[15:59.850 --> 16:01.730]  Like honestly, like just shut the fuck up.
[16:02.250 --> 16:04.610]  Right. And quit being like that.
[16:05.050 --> 16:07.810]  And when shit happens, like do something about it.
[16:07.890 --> 16:11.330]  Don't don't don't definitely don't tell other people.
[16:11.330 --> 16:15.490]  Oh, well, it's not, you know, the way to know that is the way to be like when you see
[16:15.490 --> 16:18.330]  something fucked up happening, you got to you got to be vocal about it.
[16:18.330 --> 16:22.210]  You got to speak up. And if it's unpopular, hey, so be it.
[16:22.210 --> 16:24.450]  You know, because at the end of the day, what's right is right.
[16:24.850 --> 16:26.930]  What's wrong is wrong. So.
[16:28.210 --> 16:33.730]  Where we're at now, I would just say, like all these other states that are coming online
[16:33.730 --> 16:39.530]  like like Virginia, right, just look at what happens in the past and plan accordingly
[16:39.930 --> 16:43.210]  because it happens literally everywhere.
[16:43.530 --> 16:47.890]  So, you know, like the old saying goes, when you when you start forgetting history, that's
[16:47.890 --> 16:53.890]  when it repeats itself. So learn from the mistakes of what's happened in the past and
[16:53.890 --> 16:59.530]  try to prevent that from happening, you know, where you live, if things are changing,
[16:59.810 --> 17:04.770]  because we do have a ability, you know, so many people used to show up at capitals and
[17:04.770 --> 17:10.130]  protest and fight for med, you know, and then, you know, eventually for rec and
[17:10.130 --> 17:13.170]  everything else. But it's like they give up that that fight.
[17:13.170 --> 17:17.810]  So the fight will always continue because the second you let your guard down, big money,
[17:17.850 --> 17:21.850]  big corporations, private interests, they're going to be in there trying to, you know,
[17:21.850 --> 17:25.490]  undermine every effort that's that's been put into place, you know.
[17:25.650 --> 17:28.570]  So you just got to stay really, really vigilant.
[17:28.850 --> 17:34.050]  You know, if this is what you want to do and when you find shit coming out, you know, you
[17:34.050 --> 17:38.090]  got to you got to got to be vocal about it, even if it's unpopular.
[17:38.130 --> 17:43.090]  Yeah. Nobody likes to be called an asshole or cocksucker or whatever and be trolled
[17:43.090 --> 17:47.490]  online. But, you know, for the few people that are going to be doing that, you know,
[17:47.490 --> 17:52.130]  you're going to have a whole hell of a lot of people that are really appreciative of,
[17:52.410 --> 17:56.610]  you know, you know, that knowledge and being able to do it.
[17:56.970 --> 17:59.090]  So I would just say just be vigilant.
[17:59.410 --> 18:00.690]  Pay attention to your laws.
[18:00.970 --> 18:03.490]  Pay attention with the bills that are going through.
[18:04.050 --> 18:09.930]  Within our community, not industry, but within our community of good people, we got
[18:10.170 --> 18:15.570]  multiple guys that are always staying on top of like, hey, SB, you know, 444 is trying to
[18:15.570 --> 18:16.530]  be pushed through right now.
[18:16.530 --> 18:18.290]  It's a tag along bill with this and that.
[18:18.290 --> 18:22.610]  And hey, they're trying to say no more home grows, no more med or whatever.
[18:22.930 --> 18:26.730]  So just, you know, pay attention to these people.
[18:27.010 --> 18:31.890]  And when it comes time, like ride with these people, because otherwise they're they're
[18:31.890 --> 18:32.930]  looking to take it from you.
[18:33.130 --> 18:39.130]  You know, so just stay vigilant and try to keep it from happening, happening elsewhere.
[18:39.490 --> 18:45.130]  And that way you don't end up with your good shows and your good times becoming this.
[18:46.330 --> 18:52.810]  We're Chad, that's with with with enforcement coming through, stealing, stealing your
[18:52.810 --> 18:55.490]  weed and hassling and threatening to lock you up, you know.
[18:56.650 --> 19:00.930]  Well, I feel like somebody that's well known in the community, Sungrown Mids, I mean,
[19:00.930 --> 19:02.330]  that's exactly what it seemed like.
[19:02.330 --> 19:04.210]  That's exactly who I'm talking about.
[19:04.370 --> 19:04.970]  You know, right.
[19:05.370 --> 19:09.850]  And so to be super vigilant, like, you know, he's always posting like, yeah, they're
[19:09.850 --> 19:10.810]  trying to do this to us.
[19:10.810 --> 19:11.850]  They're trying to do this to us.
[19:11.850 --> 19:12.810]  They're killing the farmer.
[19:12.810 --> 19:13.530]  They're killing this.
[19:13.530 --> 19:14.210]  They're killing that.
[19:14.570 --> 19:20.130]  Like and, you know, a lot of people would either give him shit or, you know, just not
[19:20.130 --> 19:26.050]  pay mind to it, you know, but he was always like going in front of county, you know,
[19:26.490 --> 19:29.210]  meetings and shit like that, town halls and everything else.
[19:29.530 --> 19:31.370]  Very vocal, very vigilant about it.
[19:31.690 --> 19:37.490]  So if you have more people like him, you know, that kind of puts a puts a stop to to a
[19:37.490 --> 19:39.730]  lot of the shit that they try to pull, you know.
[19:40.290 --> 19:42.850]  Well, I wasn't you know, I don't think either.
[19:43.010 --> 19:44.010]  None of us were there.
[19:44.010 --> 19:46.250]  So it's like pretty hard to speak on it.
[19:46.530 --> 19:50.490]  But from the videos and stuff, it seemed like they could have possibly known the stuff
[19:50.490 --> 19:51.370]  that you had just mentioned.
[19:51.370 --> 19:54.090]  It seemed like they might have like found a way to target him.
[19:55.210 --> 19:56.410]  I think we lost him there.
[19:56.410 --> 19:58.770]  But yeah, for.
[20:00.250 --> 20:04.330]  Yeah, explain to him what what you're talking about, Brian, folks might not know.
[20:05.730 --> 20:11.450]  So I I feel kind of kind of silly speaking on something when I wasn't there, but what it
[20:11.450 --> 20:17.370]  what it seemed like is they had some kind of like corporate enforcement agency.
[20:17.890 --> 20:22.250]  They, you know, sun grown meds was, you know, it's called something.
[20:23.170 --> 20:26.370]  But anyway, they seeked sun grown meds out.
[20:26.370 --> 20:29.610]  It seemed like they were all kind of just sitting around, probably smoking, showing some
[20:29.610 --> 20:35.810]  of the stuff. I saw that he had a clear bag that looked obviously fairly small for the for
[20:35.810 --> 20:39.850]  that kind of individual that's been in the game for that long, you know, personal use to
[20:39.850 --> 20:43.090]  also probably share and give to other individuals.
[20:44.170 --> 20:48.330]  I don't think a lot of people understand that the Emerald Cup, at least still for some
[20:48.330 --> 20:52.890]  people, is kind of the holy grail of things that in a way can launch careers.
[20:53.490 --> 20:57.370]  I feel like for you, Duke, it definitely you were you're kind of the Bella of the ball in
[20:57.370 --> 21:02.930]  2017. A lot of people were talking about you with the skunk one and some of the the
[21:02.930 --> 21:04.090]  other genetics that you had.
[21:05.930 --> 21:09.570]  But I wanted to get back to some sun grown meds since you just kind of popped back on
[21:09.570 --> 21:15.650]  because are you more familiar with that agency that was seeking out what what was going
[21:15.690 --> 21:20.050]  on? And do you think he was targeted because he is kind of more vocal maybe than other
[21:20.450 --> 21:21.770]  others within the community?
[21:24.130 --> 21:30.930]  Maybe, you know, he'd be he'd be a cool person to hit up and have on your show to, you
[21:30.930 --> 21:37.090]  know, I think it's hella smart, like really good, you know, like I talked to him on IG,
[21:37.330 --> 21:43.010]  but I got to meet him in person, you know, at that that first show and then at the next
[21:43.050 --> 21:49.490]  year. I just think that like, you know, like some of those pictures I saw, there's a lot
[21:49.490 --> 21:55.290]  of a lot of those dudes and they're just walking around looking to hassle with
[21:55.290 --> 22:00.570]  anybody. So I think it probably happened a lot over the weekend.
[22:00.890 --> 22:04.250]  It's just they chose the wrong group of dudes to roll up on.
[22:04.250 --> 22:08.050]  You know, they were going to, you know, get Kush family right there with them.
[22:08.370 --> 22:09.690]  You had Masonic with them.
[22:09.690 --> 22:16.210]  You had fucking Bam, you know, Bamboo, like you had the wrong group of dudes to be
[22:16.210 --> 22:19.690]  fucking with. So they're going to be, you know, in their face vocal about it and
[22:19.690 --> 22:20.690]  they're going to be reporting it.
[22:21.010 --> 22:25.850]  So I think a lot of other instances, people were just like, you know, kind of shook up.
[22:26.130 --> 22:29.090]  They're not going to record it or they're just like, oh, here, just take it.
[22:29.410 --> 22:31.730]  So I think it probably happened a lot more.
[22:32.210 --> 22:34.890]  We just didn't, you know, you're just not hearing about it.
[22:35.730 --> 22:41.130]  So. Like my buddy, James, you know, James being he.
[22:42.690 --> 22:49.290]  He you know, he gave me kind of a rundown on what it was like, and I was like, you
[22:49.290 --> 22:55.330]  know, it doesn't doesn't really surprise me, you know, but, you know, when you start
[22:55.330 --> 22:59.050]  getting agencies like that, you know, that's what they're that's what they're tasked to
[22:59.050 --> 23:04.650]  do. You know, taxpayers money, you know, is, you know.
[23:04.890 --> 23:08.050]  Paying for these people to come and bust your balls.
[23:08.410 --> 23:13.410]  And just like with, you know, any other agency, I know you see a lot of cops go out
[23:13.410 --> 23:16.010]  there and do unconstitutional shit, right?
[23:16.530 --> 23:17.970]  And get away with it.
[23:18.370 --> 23:22.010]  And sometimes people call them out on it and shit like a lot of cops don't even know
[23:22.010 --> 23:24.930]  the law. You know, they're just doing what they want to do.
[23:25.330 --> 23:29.090]  So like with these people, I'm sure, you know, the same thing, same thing is going to
[23:29.090 --> 23:33.170]  happen with them. They're just going to kind of go through, hassle people, bust balls
[23:33.730 --> 23:37.650]  and, you know, it's a sad state of affairs.
[23:37.650 --> 23:39.890]  You know, this is what it is, I guess, at this point.
[23:43.290 --> 23:49.170]  Do you think that the the Emerald Cup themselves is kind of pushing that, enforcing
[23:49.170 --> 23:53.050]  that? Did you feel that when you were there or do you think this is just consequences of
[23:53.450 --> 23:56.290]  us versus them and they're allowed to walk around and harass?
[23:57.610 --> 24:02.250]  I think it's just the consequence, you know, I don't think because like, you know, deep
[24:02.290 --> 24:06.490]  down, like, you know, people with Emerald Cup, you know, they're running, they're running
[24:06.490 --> 24:10.050]  a business, you know, and their business is good times.
[24:10.210 --> 24:12.330]  So they want people to come.
[24:12.330 --> 24:13.450]  They want people to have fun.
[24:13.450 --> 24:16.810]  They want them to have a good time because naturally, you know, they're going to want
[24:16.810 --> 24:17.970]  them to come back next year.
[24:18.170 --> 24:21.650]  You know, they're not going to want to hold that bunch of bad shit online.
[24:21.650 --> 24:27.170]  But, you know, that's a that's a state agency like you can't you know, you can't really
[24:27.170 --> 24:29.810]  control that. You know, they're going to they're going to be there.
[24:30.130 --> 24:33.970]  It's one of the biggest shows that, you know, one could go to.
[24:33.970 --> 24:37.610]  So naturally, you know, this this agency is going to be there.
[24:37.770 --> 24:40.970]  So it's not really anything I think anybody can control.
[24:41.450 --> 24:43.330]  It's just you're going to have a show there.
[24:43.370 --> 24:46.570]  They're going to be there. They're going to have plainclothes people there.
[24:46.610 --> 24:48.490]  You know, it's like old Grateful Dead shows.
[24:48.930 --> 24:51.570]  You know, Grateful Dead's not inviting the DEA to show up.
[24:51.570 --> 24:57.330]  But these dudes with crispy tie dyes walking through the crowd asking, you know, do you
[24:57.330 --> 25:01.610]  have any marijuana? Would you like to sell or purchase some with some legal tender?
[25:01.890 --> 25:06.450]  You know what I mean? Like it's it's you know, it's just the nature of the beast now.
[25:06.530 --> 25:09.410]  And that's just what what's going to what's going to happen with that thing.
[25:10.570 --> 25:14.690]  OK, because I felt like, you know, are you all we all kind of leaning it towards they were
[25:14.690 --> 25:16.210]  trying to push out the small guy.
[25:16.250 --> 25:18.970]  So that's not the case with Emerald Cutler or is it?
[25:20.330 --> 25:23.290]  I mean, it feels like that agency is trying to push out.
[25:23.290 --> 25:25.890]  OK, yeah, that's kind of floating around.
[25:25.890 --> 25:28.290]  It is. Yeah, I think it was.
[25:28.810 --> 25:32.050]  Yeah. Anyway, that the bag is on point, the whole thing.
[25:32.050 --> 25:34.090]  So whoever did that is quick.
[25:34.090 --> 25:39.810]  And like this doesn't happen just like over a weekend or one instance, like the big guy
[25:39.810 --> 25:45.650]  trying to push the small guy, you know, that's been going on for a while now, you know,
[25:45.650 --> 25:49.970]  like like where I was going back and talking about when they're just trying to push the
[25:49.970 --> 25:55.810]  wreck through, you know, even before that is even coming to to be these guys are going
[25:55.810 --> 25:57.490]  to try to push you, push you out.
[25:58.050 --> 26:00.010]  And that's just that's just the nature of the beast.
[26:00.170 --> 26:02.290]  I think that's just the nature of business in general.
[26:02.650 --> 26:05.130]  Then have to speak with what we do.
[26:05.410 --> 26:07.450]  You know, it could be worth anything.
[26:07.450 --> 26:13.730]  You know, they're always looking to take the lion's share, you know, and fuck it all and
[26:13.730 --> 26:18.010]  take it. So mom and pop and all that shit, they don't give a fuck.
[26:18.010 --> 26:20.250]  You know, it's just it's a number at the end of the day.
[26:20.250 --> 26:21.850]  They're trying to make the most of it.
[26:22.410 --> 26:28.970]  And it's just what it what business is, you know, whether it's this or shit, any anything
[26:28.970 --> 26:31.770]  else, you know, it's just like, look at Wal-Mart.
[26:32.050 --> 26:35.730]  You know what I mean? So that's just the nature of the beast.
[26:35.730 --> 26:37.930]  I think they've been doing it a long time.
[26:38.170 --> 26:43.450]  And this is just one of the many little things that happens over the years.
[26:43.610 --> 26:47.850]  And it'll probably get a whole lot worse before it gets any better.
[26:48.010 --> 26:54.370]  That's for sure. Well, and if he was targeted, I feel like that's, you know, that's kind
[26:54.370 --> 26:59.210]  of there definitely are kind of where Marco is getting like going after this small time,
[26:59.210 --> 27:02.610]  maybe home grower, which which is really sad to see.
[27:02.610 --> 27:10.090]  I mean, isn't that that's that's the backbone of kind of the part that is allowing us to
[27:10.090 --> 27:15.250]  continue and educate and this whole thing become more of a hopefully federally legal
[27:15.930 --> 27:20.490]  aspect. I feel like craft cannabis hopefully will never go away.
[27:20.490 --> 27:24.490]  And if there is enough of a voice and people are continued to be educated on why if they
[27:24.490 --> 27:27.490]  view cannabis as medicine, then it needs to be craft.
[27:27.490 --> 27:28.530]  It needs to be organic.
[27:28.890 --> 27:32.210]  That's something that like I was saying, man, when you when you came back, you were able
[27:32.210 --> 27:33.530]  to speak at Indo Expo.
[27:34.130 --> 27:35.130]  There was a classic.
[27:35.290 --> 27:38.290]  I think it was maybe like an hour, maybe an hour and 15 minutes, man.
[27:38.570 --> 27:43.290]  You're up there with JJ from Top Dog and Adam Dunn, and you guys were chopping it up.
[27:43.530 --> 27:49.250]  And I felt like you were talking to the audience, man, in a way that, you know, maybe in a
[27:49.250 --> 27:51.410]  way, a little disrespect to this individual.
[27:51.410 --> 27:54.090]  But JJ wasn't coming at it the same way.
[27:54.090 --> 27:59.370]  And I've personally seen some things with him where I feel like when you meet individuals
[27:59.370 --> 28:04.090]  that others look up to and then you actually see them in person or something like that,
[28:04.090 --> 28:09.290]  it's hard sometimes to I don't know, to just kind of see like, OK, well, I guess that
[28:09.290 --> 28:11.570]  individual responds to things in this way.
[28:11.570 --> 28:12.850]  And this is how they carry themselves.
[28:13.490 --> 28:17.570]  But when I met you, man, after that, you continue to carry yourself the way that the
[28:17.570 --> 28:19.050]  community talked about you.
[28:19.610 --> 28:23.610]  And when you were up on that stage, you were really talking about how to craft cannabis,
[28:23.610 --> 28:27.170]  how, you know, a lot of that shit out there, especially at the time, I guess, was
[28:27.170 --> 28:29.450]  cranberry juice and yucca extract.
[28:29.970 --> 28:33.810]  And I'd never really heard anybody on a stage talk like that, man.
[28:33.810 --> 28:35.850]  It's always, you know, the Ph.D.
[28:35.850 --> 28:40.770]  type individuals talking about their products or talking over the audience head, it seems
[28:40.770 --> 28:45.010]  like at times on purpose just to make it seem like, you know, you you should use them as a
[28:45.010 --> 28:50.490]  consultant, even though especially at that time, most of the industry wouldn't have
[28:50.890 --> 28:52.650]  really respected that individual.
[28:52.850 --> 28:55.650]  So it seemed like there was a lot of smoke and mirrors and that kind of stuff.
[28:55.650 --> 28:56.850]  And you were coming through with that.
[28:56.850 --> 29:01.290]  So for the newer viewers, I was hoping that you could talk about trichomes because
[29:01.290 --> 29:05.130]  there's so much information out there, especially when people start to find that they
[29:05.130 --> 29:06.770]  want to touch their plants constantly.
[29:06.930 --> 29:11.930]  I know when I was, you know, it's fun to do that kind of stuff, but you were taking it as
[29:11.930 --> 29:13.850]  you're growing medicine, you're taking the time to do that.
[29:13.850 --> 29:15.410]  So I kind of wanted to start there.
[29:15.530 --> 29:19.890]  And then, Marco, let's really get into the growing aspect, because I feel like this is
[29:20.090 --> 29:21.970]  obviously everybody's time is valuable.
[29:21.970 --> 29:27.610]  But picking the brain of Duke Diamond on a level for the newer viewers, I feel like it's
[29:27.610 --> 29:31.170]  going to be extremely beneficial for people that want to try to start to farm cannabis
[29:31.170 --> 29:35.530]  using a living soil, no till, however you want to call it, system, because this gentleman
[29:35.530 --> 29:40.610]  is definitely one of the OG's again, if you will, of just explaining this to the average
[29:40.610 --> 29:45.770]  person so that they could farm cannabis at home with with nothing else.
[29:46.850 --> 29:49.410]  You know, he never expected anything to come back.
[29:52.010 --> 29:58.530]  Yeah, my thing was like, especially on stages and shit like that is like, I'm not trying
[29:58.530 --> 29:59.930]  to sell you anything.
[29:59.930 --> 30:06.050]  It's like I came up taking your time to hear about a topic or hear me talk.
[30:06.090 --> 30:08.290]  Like I'm not trying to sell you anything.
[30:08.290 --> 30:09.810]  I'm just trying to give you information.
[30:09.810 --> 30:13.170]  I just want to want people to be happy, be successful.
[30:13.570 --> 30:18.770]  And I just want people to grow their own and help others.
[30:19.090 --> 30:23.610]  And that type of knowledge, you know, if it keeps spreading and then they pass it on,
[30:23.930 --> 30:26.570]  yeah, makes the world a better place, you know.
[30:27.050 --> 30:32.330]  So as far as like, so we're talking about.
[30:33.530 --> 30:42.770]  All this, all this glandular heads, trichomes, so let me see here, I can sum it up pretty
[30:42.770 --> 30:45.450]  quick, so that's our end goal, right?
[30:45.850 --> 30:55.930]  So the way my approach is to grow and blooming is that my end result is that trichome,
[30:55.930 --> 30:57.650]  that's where that's where the good shit is.
[30:57.970 --> 30:58.650]  So.
[30:59.770 --> 31:05.170]  My thing is, you know, we can focus on biomass first, right?
[31:06.090 --> 31:11.930]  That's that's well and good because the biomass is the landscape that these glands are
[31:11.930 --> 31:12.610]  going to grow on.
[31:13.090 --> 31:19.890]  And then as the time comes, then my focus is going to be more into growing, growing
[31:19.890 --> 31:23.730]  glands on the biomass that I created for that.
[31:24.210 --> 31:31.250]  So a lot of my feeding, it's going to be more more geared that way.
[31:31.530 --> 31:37.530]  So I'm ensuring that I'm getting good, good resin production overall, but flavonoid
[31:37.530 --> 31:39.810]  production and terpenoid production.
[31:39.810 --> 31:45.490]  So smell and flavor are definitely, you know, that's that's that's kind of like my end
[31:45.490 --> 31:52.490]  game. And then harvesting correctly at the proper, proper time, you know, when it's
[31:52.490 --> 31:53.570]  ripe, ready to go.
[31:53.850 --> 31:55.290]  So pumping that watermelon.
[31:56.610 --> 31:57.290]  Yeah. All right.
[31:57.290 --> 31:57.850]  She's good.
[31:59.690 --> 32:04.010]  So getting to that proper time and then after that, you know, that's where most people
[32:04.010 --> 32:05.010]  like, all right, score.
[32:05.050 --> 32:11.050]  I did it. That's you're you're at the halfway point because now we got the dry.
[32:11.570 --> 32:13.650]  Right. And then we're going to have our trim.
[32:14.010 --> 32:18.850]  Right. And then we're going to have our the finish of drying is kind of what I call it
[32:18.850 --> 32:21.210]  because it's not I'm not really curing yet.
[32:21.210 --> 32:26.530]  I don't consider ourselves going dry and then moving forward into the cure.
[32:26.890 --> 32:32.450]  So a lot of things that, you know, I always saw that, you know, people people mess up.
[32:32.450 --> 32:34.370]  But, hey, I mean, it's like it's their bud.
[32:34.370 --> 32:36.970]  You know, you can finger bang it all you want.
[32:37.130 --> 32:39.330]  I can rub all the glands off before it's done.
[32:39.330 --> 32:42.170]  But that's just not my jam.
[32:42.170 --> 32:45.770]  So I'm trying to avoid contact with these.
[32:46.090 --> 32:48.130]  So I'm not sitting there squeezing everything.
[32:48.130 --> 32:52.490]  And if you got to, man, if you got to get a little smell, go down low, go down low to
[32:52.490 --> 32:53.890]  some water. You know what I mean?
[32:53.930 --> 32:54.970]  Mess mess with that.
[32:55.330 --> 32:56.410]  Don't don't mess up.
[32:56.410 --> 33:02.330]  I'm when we're chopping, you know, avoiding that harsh contact.
[33:03.930 --> 33:08.290]  I like to snip off the the family's like while it's in the pot.
[33:08.290 --> 33:15.410]  It's being enough. I like to leave about one inch of that petiole stem and drop the
[33:15.410 --> 33:21.090]  leaf, cut it in sizable, consistent lengths, you know, so I'm getting a more consistent
[33:21.730 --> 33:26.810]  dry so I don't have a three foot long branch with a one foot long branch.
[33:26.810 --> 33:29.410]  I try to keep everything ratio the same way.
[33:30.210 --> 33:35.770]  Once we're hanging, I like to have good air circulation, run dehumidifier or
[33:35.770 --> 33:36.930]  dehumidifiers.
[33:37.130 --> 33:44.650]  It's a big area, throttling it back and forth because I want good, steady production of
[33:45.410 --> 33:50.170]  dry. I don't like to drop too quick and I don't want to take forever either.
[33:50.530 --> 33:53.130]  But, you know, I want to I want to take my time there.
[33:53.130 --> 33:58.450]  So I'm throttling back the humidity back and forth and then knowing like, hey, when is
[33:58.450 --> 33:59.810]  it when is it time to trim?
[34:00.210 --> 34:03.450]  So, you know, it's pretty, pretty simple with me.
[34:03.450 --> 34:08.050]  I would go up and average it across these hangers or wherever I'm at.
[34:08.330 --> 34:12.650]  And, you know, your lowest buds are going to be at the at the hanger point because, you
[34:12.690 --> 34:16.250]  know, you're hanging on and I'll take my finger and just, you know, just kind of.
[34:17.450 --> 34:22.050]  Do one of those dudes on that sugar leaf, if it just breaks right off, pops right off, I
[34:22.050 --> 34:26.690]  do it there, I do it in the middle and then I do it down near the cola, you know, so if
[34:26.690 --> 34:28.410]  I'm getting them popping off like that.
[34:30.690 --> 34:35.210]  If I'm getting them popping off like that, I know that, OK, now I'm ready to start my
[34:35.210 --> 34:36.930]  trimming now.
[34:37.770 --> 34:44.090]  When I first went out west, you know, they had legalization going on in Oregon and I
[34:44.090 --> 34:48.690]  was going over to my buddy pig farmers and these people trimming and they were grabbing
[34:48.690 --> 34:50.970]  these these these bugs just by the hand.
[34:50.970 --> 34:56.090]  And I mean, like squeezing the fuck out and just hacking them all the shit.
[34:56.090 --> 34:57.610]  I was like, oh, my God.
[34:58.010 --> 35:01.330]  I was like, bro, you see what these assholes are doing, doing to your shit?
[35:02.130 --> 35:04.010]  And he was like, oh, yeah, it's just how they do.
[35:04.010 --> 35:05.610]  I was like, shit, not my shit.
[35:06.010 --> 35:07.450]  I'm talking to my shit like that.
[35:07.450 --> 35:09.410]  I slept fucking taste out their mouth.
[35:09.410 --> 35:11.450]  Now you're fucking ruining all my hard work.
[35:11.890 --> 35:17.250]  So when I trim, I hold the branch or the stem and I don't touch the button.
[35:17.250 --> 35:21.970]  I just rotate it, you know, just sit there and rotate it around the, you know, the trim,
[35:22.370 --> 35:23.530]  you know, and get it done.
[35:23.810 --> 35:26.970]  After that, I don't let it drop three feet into a pan.
[35:26.970 --> 35:27.850]  I take it out of the pan.
[35:27.850 --> 35:32.090]  I flip it off and I know there's people who will commercially.
[35:32.090 --> 35:36.290]  Well, I'm not talking about your commercial production, whatever I'm talking about, me
[35:36.290 --> 35:38.930]  doing me and people doing for themselves.
[35:39.290 --> 35:42.410]  So, you know, if you want to use your machines or whatever, hey, you know what I'm
[35:42.410 --> 35:43.250]  saying? Go do you.
[35:43.690 --> 35:49.530]  I'm looking to grow and and have the best that I can possibly have.
[35:49.530 --> 35:54.010]  So if we're talking, you know, best possible outcome, you know, treat it, treat it, treat
[35:54.010 --> 35:57.090]  it as such, you know, so I'll clip it off, you know, in these pans.
[35:58.050 --> 36:02.650]  I'm going to let my drying continue because after I got up, you know, I don't also don't
[36:02.650 --> 36:08.090]  bury my shit, you know, in like, you know, six inches deep, you know, like two, three
[36:08.090 --> 36:10.130]  inches, you know, about as much as I go.
[36:10.490 --> 36:15.370]  And then I'll put them in like something I can seal up, seal it for 24 hours, open it
[36:15.370 --> 36:18.970]  up. And you'll notice everything went back to a little damp because the innermost
[36:18.970 --> 36:23.410]  moisture has started to wick out toward the toward the dryer outside.
[36:23.410 --> 36:27.170]  So you got to continue doing that to really finish it off.
[36:27.650 --> 36:32.890]  And another thing was people found like, all right, cool, we're dry.
[36:33.250 --> 36:39.090]  Let's, you know, jar it up, even if they have got to that point that the smell.
[36:39.450 --> 36:42.970]  So like you might notice like, hey, man, you know, I got my shit.
[36:42.970 --> 36:45.850]  It stinks. It goes away, but we're good.
[36:45.850 --> 36:46.850]  I'm just going to put it away.
[36:47.370 --> 36:52.050]  So that typically will, you know, it's going to screw you in the long run.
[36:52.410 --> 36:54.970]  So what I would do is you would open it up.
[36:55.010 --> 36:57.010]  The smell hits you in the face and it fades away.
[36:57.010 --> 36:58.570]  And people are like, oh, my God, it's gone.
[36:58.570 --> 36:59.890]  It's gone. Let me seal it back up.
[37:00.290 --> 37:02.650]  Don't do that. Just leave it open.
[37:03.050 --> 37:05.450]  The smell is going to come back when the smell starts coming back.
[37:05.450 --> 37:08.010]  Seal it up. Open it the next day.
[37:08.410 --> 37:10.650]  All right. So I was going to hit you in the face.
[37:10.650 --> 37:14.570]  Right. And then after a little bit, you know, a few minutes, it's gone.
[37:14.650 --> 37:16.170]  Fades away. Leave it open.
[37:16.210 --> 37:17.850]  You'll notice the smell start coming back.
[37:18.570 --> 37:20.050]  You know, it's still finishing.
[37:20.850 --> 37:22.450]  So go ahead, seal it up.
[37:22.450 --> 37:25.130]  And you're going to repeat this process at the point where you can open it.
[37:25.130 --> 37:26.970]  The smell hits you in the face. Right.
[37:27.410 --> 37:28.890]  And it doesn't fade away.
[37:28.890 --> 37:32.690]  At that point, you should be dealing with one very stinky good shit.
[37:32.890 --> 37:37.170]  And to the bud should have like a kind of a stale marshmallow consistency,
[37:37.210 --> 37:39.290]  you know, cultivar dependent.
[37:39.290 --> 37:41.410]  Some shit's as hard as a fucking rock, you know.
[37:41.930 --> 37:43.770]  But you should be you should be good to go.
[37:43.770 --> 37:45.730]  You're not overly dry.
[37:45.730 --> 37:47.050]  You're not wet either.
[37:47.050 --> 37:48.370]  You know, you're right.
[37:48.370 --> 37:49.850]  You're right in that sweet spot.
[37:49.850 --> 37:51.930]  It's stinking. The smell is not going away.
[37:52.290 --> 37:53.930]  Now you're ready for the door.
[37:53.930 --> 37:55.850]  So now you're going to keep it in the door.
[37:55.850 --> 37:57.770]  Cool place, dark place.
[37:57.770 --> 37:59.010]  You're going to degrade it.
[37:59.010 --> 38:00.810]  So don't leave it in the sunshine.
[38:00.810 --> 38:02.090]  Just keep it in the cabinet.
[38:02.090 --> 38:04.090]  Do you like it? Like a bottle of wine or something.
[38:04.610 --> 38:08.490]  And then after that, you know, burp it, you know, for a minute, you know, each day.
[38:08.810 --> 38:12.770]  And over time, you know, these these glands like they're still doing their thing.
[38:13.250 --> 38:15.650]  So, you know, I wouldn't touch anything.
[38:16.170 --> 38:20.610]  Shit. Six weeks after the chop would be about the first time I start
[38:20.610 --> 38:21.850]  poisoning anything.
[38:21.850 --> 38:25.090]  There are some guys I knew that, you know, eight weeks,
[38:25.090 --> 38:26.930]  10 weeks before they would touch it.
[38:26.930 --> 38:31.130]  And you'll notice like if you take a bud and, you know, burn it like right away
[38:31.130 --> 38:33.410]  and then you wait that six weeks and then do it again.
[38:33.890 --> 38:38.170]  Yeah, it's a world of different smell, taste, everything, you know.
[38:38.530 --> 38:41.490]  So just remember, like the whole time you're growing,
[38:41.650 --> 38:45.130]  you're focusing on these on these heads because that's that's our endgame,
[38:45.130 --> 38:49.250]  especially for the the the oil, you know, ash producers.
[38:50.930 --> 38:55.210]  But, you know, the fight isn't up until until it's done, you know,
[38:55.210 --> 38:57.650]  so you got to keep it going the whole way.
[38:57.970 --> 39:00.290]  And if you're putting a lot of money into the growth,
[39:00.290 --> 39:04.730]  don't start cheaping it out on your on your drying process, you know.
[39:04.930 --> 39:07.370]  So keep keep up the work through that.
[39:07.730 --> 39:11.650]  And then you end up with a much, much better, better thing at the
[39:11.690 --> 39:13.090]  at the end of the day.
[39:13.090 --> 39:15.770]  So this is just my two cents on it.
[39:17.490 --> 39:22.370]  Yeah, I mean, you know, for an advanced farmer, that's very basic stuff.
[39:22.370 --> 39:24.410]  But I feel like when you get to an elite level
[39:24.410 --> 39:27.010]  and you actually start to hear a professional talk about their day,
[39:27.010 --> 39:28.450]  the way they break things down,
[39:28.450 --> 39:31.330]  a lot of that stuff is just repetitive, same kind of thing,
[39:31.650 --> 39:34.370]  knowing what to do and what not to do.
[39:34.930 --> 39:38.810]  There was a meme video, I remember, that went around maybe a year or two ago.
[39:39.170 --> 39:41.410]  Marco, I think you might remember this one
[39:41.410 --> 39:44.210]  where they were bouncing the all the the plants.
[39:44.530 --> 39:47.010]  They were basically like the whole line of these people
[39:47.010 --> 39:50.850]  were playing basically like the conga drums with the plants themselves,
[39:50.850 --> 39:52.850]  just smashing everything.
[39:52.850 --> 39:56.650]  So even I feel like, especially at the corporate level,
[39:56.850 --> 40:00.850]  I don't think that they really value the trichomes the way
[40:00.850 --> 40:03.250]  that the small time individual does.
[40:03.570 --> 40:07.490]  And that I feel like is our our secret, something that we can hopefully
[40:07.490 --> 40:10.770]  hold on to is that it doesn't seem like they give a shit about.
[40:11.130 --> 40:13.970]  So if the industry knows that that's the real secret of things,
[40:13.970 --> 40:17.890]  even with fake cannabis, when they give that to individuals,
[40:18.570 --> 40:21.050]  from what I understand, it doesn't work the same.
[40:21.050 --> 40:25.090]  And then God only knows if you've you know, if you were only able to smoke
[40:25.090 --> 40:28.650]  like K2 or something like that, that's a I don't even feel like that's
[40:28.890 --> 40:30.810]  saying the word synthetic cannabis.
[40:30.810 --> 40:33.690]  I don't even feel like that's justified because there's no way
[40:33.690 --> 40:37.090]  you're near the same thing with cannabis and K2.
[40:37.090 --> 40:40.530]  So you can't recreate those organic compounds.
[40:40.530 --> 40:41.250]  You know what I mean?
[40:41.250 --> 40:44.210]  Like, yeah, synthetics aren't going to do that.
[40:44.210 --> 40:48.330]  Synthetics will give you kind of the overall cannabis feel.
[40:48.370 --> 40:52.210]  You know, you'll get that, but you'll never get that full profile
[40:52.210 --> 40:54.930]  like a good grown flower will give you.
[40:55.530 --> 40:57.330]  I know Duke can agree with that.
[40:57.330 --> 40:58.330]  Oh, yeah.
[40:58.330 --> 41:00.090]  Now I've watched his motherfucking smoke.
[41:00.090 --> 41:03.250]  There's men like nothing can be about that shit.
[41:03.290 --> 41:05.530]  And it's close to the goddamn angel does
[41:06.050 --> 41:08.410]  like a motherfucker smoking and bombing fluid and shit.
[41:09.010 --> 41:10.890]  I seen some shit.
[41:10.890 --> 41:13.770]  Well, that's like a love boat back in the day.
[41:14.250 --> 41:15.410]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[41:15.410 --> 41:18.090]  It looks like a smoke boat, all of them
[41:19.250 --> 41:22.250]  shaking out, screaming and hollering at shit that ain't there.
[41:23.170 --> 41:24.890]  Yeah, ain't nothing can about that.
[41:27.690 --> 41:31.130]  All right, Duke, so I would say your style, especially your early
[41:31.130 --> 41:33.450]  when you were vocal with a lot of things is,
[41:34.530 --> 41:37.290]  I guess the easiest way to describe is kind of like no to you.
[41:37.290 --> 41:40.970]  You know, I don't think you started this before that was even a buzzword.
[41:41.610 --> 41:44.250]  But I noticed that, you know, your pots were a little bit smaller
[41:44.250 --> 41:46.410]  than what is conventional thinking today.
[41:46.410 --> 41:48.730]  And I was hoping that we could kind of go down, you know,
[41:48.730 --> 41:50.730]  why you view things the way that you do.
[41:51.010 --> 41:53.010]  I know that you're big on top dressing.
[41:53.010 --> 41:55.530]  You're one of the first ones that broke down insect frass,
[41:55.530 --> 41:59.610]  where I felt like Georgia boy could understand why that was extremely important
[42:00.370 --> 42:03.170]  because when you read it in the book, I mean, it comes across a few things.
[42:03.170 --> 42:04.410]  Insect frass, read that.
[42:04.410 --> 42:06.890]  Maybe you go and Google what that means.
[42:06.890 --> 42:09.810]  It just doesn't have the same caliber when someone breaks down
[42:09.810 --> 42:11.850]  what that's really doing for the plant.
[42:12.330 --> 42:14.370]  So I was hoping we could kind of run down that road, too, man,
[42:14.370 --> 42:16.570]  because that was something that really stuck out to me
[42:16.570 --> 42:18.930]  when you were talking about that once on a podcast.
[42:18.930 --> 42:22.930]  I do. Can you talk on get into kind of like your progression to have grown?
[42:22.930 --> 42:26.570]  You know how we all kind of started and what led you to where you are
[42:26.570 --> 42:27.690]  and that kind of thing, too.
[42:27.690 --> 42:29.890]  All right. Well, I'll start there.
[42:30.530 --> 42:36.330]  So let's go start.
[42:38.090 --> 42:40.210]  Let's start with some cool and.
[42:41.930 --> 42:44.690]  So soil growing.
[42:46.210 --> 42:50.810]  I mean, just just on a very basic level at work, it was good.
[42:52.010 --> 42:54.770]  You're just going off old time.
[42:55.770 --> 43:00.290]  Farm knowledge and just farming at the end of the day.
[43:02.530 --> 43:08.010]  Internet, horrible, horrible thing, but very cool to very good tool.
[43:08.330 --> 43:12.250]  And it allowed me to to talk to other people. Right.
[43:13.050 --> 43:18.530]  And that's something that I noticed over decades now.
[43:20.370 --> 43:23.010]  And this part's kind of gone by the wayside,
[43:23.130 --> 43:28.530]  like people helping other people and learning from each other's mistakes
[43:28.530 --> 43:32.050]  and our successes and sharing knowledge
[43:32.690 --> 43:37.290]  and just talking and having like a good knowledge exchange and not.
[43:38.210 --> 43:43.690]  A lot of people just get crazy in the field and but hurt and prideful,
[43:44.530 --> 43:48.170]  especially nowadays where we get used to be like that.
[43:48.490 --> 43:52.730]  And I was just all ears, you know, like whatever you're doing,
[43:53.010 --> 43:57.330]  I want to hear all about it, man, because whatever successes you're having
[43:57.930 --> 44:00.570]  could definitely impact mine and vice versa.
[44:00.970 --> 44:02.530]  You know, I might be doing something.
[44:02.530 --> 44:04.770]  You might be doing something neither one of us does.
[44:05.130 --> 44:06.770]  And we share that with one another.
[44:06.770 --> 44:11.130]  And now we both we both came up, you know, off of that. So.
[44:12.970 --> 44:15.770]  So a big high and subcool as well,
[44:16.410 --> 44:18.330]  what they would call, you know, super soul
[44:18.930 --> 44:22.090]  I'm putting a lot of amendments
[44:22.570 --> 44:28.090]  in into into a soul and just and just rolling from there.
[44:28.930 --> 44:32.610]  So I was like, all right, you know, these dudes,
[44:32.890 --> 44:35.650]  obviously, they're very, very good.
[44:35.970 --> 44:38.650]  And, you know, I'm going to I'm going to try that.
[44:39.050 --> 44:43.250]  So I did. I noticed like for me,
[44:43.490 --> 44:49.330]  it was way too hot, just way, way, way too hot right off the bat.
[44:49.730 --> 44:52.450]  So the rest of it I had made up.
[44:52.690 --> 44:56.850]  I kind of I kind of cut it down, you know, watered it down, if you will.
[44:57.170 --> 44:59.410]  And I noticed my plants were a lot happier.
[44:59.410 --> 45:02.610]  Now I can't say like, OK, well, this shit was too hot.
[45:02.610 --> 45:03.850]  Shouldn't be done that way.
[45:03.850 --> 45:06.170]  But for what I was growing at that time,
[45:07.210 --> 45:09.410]  it was it was a little bit a little bit too much.
[45:10.090 --> 45:13.370]  And then just fast forward over the years, tweaking
[45:13.610 --> 45:16.570]  like little things here, little things there, because.
[45:17.570 --> 45:21.010]  At the end of the day, like we're all like not perfectionist,
[45:21.010 --> 45:25.930]  but, you know, we want to do the best, the best thing that we can do.
[45:26.410 --> 45:29.050]  So it all started with
[45:30.130 --> 45:32.810]  having a question and wanting an answer
[45:33.210 --> 45:38.690]  and then learning the science behind why does this do what it does
[45:39.210 --> 45:40.370]  when it does it?
[45:40.370 --> 45:44.490]  And then that way you can kind of get a control of these things.
[45:44.970 --> 45:48.410]  So the search for knowledge
[45:48.770 --> 45:54.130]  and it turned into a manic OCD reading everything,
[45:54.810 --> 45:58.450]  trying to trying to get a better knowledge of what we're working with
[45:58.890 --> 46:02.410]  and then taking that knowledge and saying, OK, well, if this is happening,
[46:02.410 --> 46:04.650]  maybe I should do this, do that.
[46:04.690 --> 46:07.050]  So introducing new things,
[46:07.330 --> 46:11.850]  learning more about micro microbiology and these microbes
[46:13.170 --> 46:14.250]  that helped a lot.
[46:14.250 --> 46:15.770]  Like, what are they doing?
[46:15.770 --> 46:18.690]  And furthermore, not only like what exactly are they doing?
[46:18.690 --> 46:20.970]  And like, what does this train do? What does this train do?
[46:21.330 --> 46:24.930]  But how do I make these little critters
[46:25.250 --> 46:28.450]  as happy as possible and the most productive as possible?
[46:29.050 --> 46:31.970]  So, you know, good,
[46:32.970 --> 46:35.530]  good knowledge backing,
[46:35.530 --> 46:38.770]  you know, changing little things and only changing one thing at a time.
[46:39.170 --> 46:41.170]  So that way I can like quantify it.
[46:41.170 --> 46:43.290]  So I can't change 10 things.
[46:43.530 --> 46:46.450]  And if something goes wrong, well, I, you know, I don't
[46:46.450 --> 46:47.530]  I don't know what it was.
[46:47.530 --> 46:49.530]  So I can I be like, yes, this definitely works.
[46:49.530 --> 46:50.850]  This definitely got better.
[46:50.850 --> 46:52.610]  This definitely didn't work.
[46:52.610 --> 46:54.730]  It got worse. And this is why.
[46:54.730 --> 46:57.570]  And just tweaking little things back and forth, back and forth.
[46:58.010 --> 47:01.570]  And then say, I mean, I mean, dudes like y'all and you're like, oh, yeah.
[47:01.570 --> 47:03.810]  Well, you know.
[47:04.530 --> 47:06.010]  I don't know.
[47:06.370 --> 47:08.370]  I don't think of a good example.
[47:08.370 --> 47:10.530]  Yeah. So he's like earthworm cassins.
[47:10.530 --> 47:14.890]  OK, and you got you got your, you know, some some cow manure in there
[47:14.890 --> 47:16.450]  for a compost. Cool.
[47:16.450 --> 47:19.570]  You know, be like, yeah, you ever you ever mess with like Alaskan
[47:19.930 --> 47:21.330]  hammock and shit?
[47:21.330 --> 47:22.650]  Oh, what's that?
[47:22.650 --> 47:24.650]  And you get to reading about it.
[47:24.650 --> 47:26.170]  You know, the overall benefits of it.
[47:26.170 --> 47:27.650]  You're like, OK, that's cool.
[47:27.650 --> 47:28.770]  Let me try it. And you do it.
[47:28.770 --> 47:30.850]  And you're like, hey, this just got better.
[47:32.210 --> 47:34.570]  Get turned on to like mixing a little bit of need cake.
[47:36.250 --> 47:39.090]  People that use that to make sure all these like little things,
[47:39.090 --> 47:41.730]  you know, just got picking up, try it works, it works.
[47:42.250 --> 47:45.370]  Cool. Not, you know, goes to the wayside.
[47:45.730 --> 47:49.170]  So talking and hanging out
[47:49.330 --> 47:54.490]  with a lot of people from all over the place with very experiences
[47:55.570 --> 47:58.530]  kind of kind of kind of led to what was going on.
[47:59.170 --> 48:02.570]  So, you know, I made mistakes like anybody does
[48:03.050 --> 48:06.970]  and learning from those mistakes and that experience over time.
[48:07.170 --> 48:09.290]  It makes you better, better and better.
[48:11.210 --> 48:13.410]  And I would say like.
[48:15.770 --> 48:19.490]  Just being being open and keeping your eyes,
[48:21.530 --> 48:25.210]  keeping your eyes and your ears open, talk less, listen more,
[48:25.810 --> 48:30.890]  kind of kind of let it turn into what it what it turned into
[48:31.250 --> 48:35.970]  and having results that were purposeful.
[48:36.610 --> 48:39.130]  They weren't happening, happening by accident.
[48:39.170 --> 48:43.290]  It was purposely going through it step by step by step by step
[48:43.850 --> 48:47.850]  and trying to make things as perfect in every step, every step of the way.
[48:49.890 --> 48:54.330]  And then that ends up leading to like Ryan saying,
[48:55.730 --> 48:59.970]  so pot size, I'm running huge pots, I'm running little pots,
[48:59.970 --> 49:02.610]  you know, try to grow huge plants and solar cups.
[49:03.210 --> 49:06.970]  Yes. Yes. To see, man, just to see what I could do, how long
[49:07.810 --> 49:09.930]  the plants are low cup challenge.
[49:09.930 --> 49:12.290]  Yeah, exactly. And just seeing what they do.
[49:13.610 --> 49:15.610]  I found that.
[49:16.050 --> 49:19.370]  I could get better, better space management
[49:20.290 --> 49:23.530]  with a smaller, smaller pots, Brian, and,
[49:24.050 --> 49:27.890]  you know, I'm looking at it in a cubic footage kind of way.
[49:27.930 --> 49:31.490]  So I knew that for the height that I really like
[49:32.690 --> 49:35.370]  and putting in there like, you know, light penetration
[49:35.370 --> 49:40.290]  that we're getting from the from the lights that we were using at the time.
[49:40.610 --> 49:44.650]  I know that optimally I'm going to get my best results
[49:44.650 --> 49:48.170]  from something between five and six feet.
[49:49.330 --> 49:52.050]  Based on that, that height or whatever,
[49:52.050 --> 49:57.170]  I knew I was good to go with, say, like a 10 to a 15 gallon gallon pot.
[49:57.490 --> 49:59.650]  And some guys are going 50 gallon pots.
[50:00.130 --> 50:05.130]  And I just felt I got the overall potential out of my plant
[50:05.130 --> 50:08.610]  better when it was sized, you know, that height,
[50:09.250 --> 50:13.930]  you know, and the diameters that, you know, were working for me.
[50:14.650 --> 50:19.330]  I could get more productive weight out of out of each, you know,
[50:20.090 --> 50:23.450]  you know, meter squared, however you want to, how you want to measure it.
[50:24.570 --> 50:29.850]  And I could get more quality, actual non-larvae bud that way.
[50:29.970 --> 50:35.290]  You know, so it's it was all about the economics of the space,
[50:35.290 --> 50:39.290]  making the space work for me, you know, versus trying to make the plant
[50:39.290 --> 50:41.690]  work in the space, if that makes sense.
[50:41.690 --> 50:45.810]  So I like, you know, like I said, the 10 to the 15 gallons
[50:45.810 --> 50:48.770]  for that size smaller, you know, I could do a five gallon
[50:49.050 --> 50:51.970]  just depends like the garden and where I'm at and what
[50:52.290 --> 50:55.170]  what I'm trying to accomplish at the at the end of that.
[50:58.090 --> 51:00.330]  As far as like the inputs and everything,
[51:02.210 --> 51:04.890]  you know, a lot of shit, you know, I would just I would just make it
[51:05.210 --> 51:07.810]  grocery store items and stuff like that.
[51:09.290 --> 51:13.210]  I mean, we could go that be a whole another episode for you.
[51:13.210 --> 51:17.010]  You know, the whole teaming with grocery stores, shit, you know, how to make,
[51:17.530 --> 51:20.330]  you know, things that are sold for hundreds of dollars a gallon
[51:20.770 --> 51:23.850]  and make it for like a couple bucks.
[51:23.850 --> 51:25.770]  That's a whole another whole another thing.
[51:25.770 --> 51:28.090]  But the approach always stayed the same.
[51:28.090 --> 51:30.970]  You know, make the environment as good as you can.
[51:31.770 --> 51:35.690]  If you got your your regimen dialed down for the soil that you're using
[51:36.250 --> 51:39.850]  with the knowledge that you that you gain in your experiences,
[51:41.290 --> 51:44.530]  you know, you should be having a having a good run.
[51:45.010 --> 51:49.410]  And just avoiding, especially for the new people,
[51:50.570 --> 51:52.330]  less is more.
[51:53.130 --> 51:56.610]  People, when it comes to growing, they never under do shit.
[51:56.970 --> 52:00.090]  Everybody always does everything to the nine.
[52:00.090 --> 52:03.490]  So, you know, just reel it back, start slow,
[52:03.850 --> 52:06.130]  you know, and then work yourself up a little bit.
[52:06.570 --> 52:09.050]  And, you know, versus the other way around.
[52:10.490 --> 52:14.370]  And you'll find that you'll have something better to show.
[52:14.690 --> 52:18.370]  At the end of it, you know, because like these plants, they're not
[52:18.570 --> 52:20.370]  they're not strippers, man.
[52:20.370 --> 52:23.930]  Like they don't respond to dollar bills being thrown at them.
[52:24.090 --> 52:26.970]  Like, you know, it's just at the end of the day, it's a,
[52:27.810 --> 52:30.290]  you know, it's it's science, you know. So,
[52:31.970 --> 52:36.130]  you know, learn as much as you can about as much as you can.
[52:36.370 --> 52:39.890]  When it when it comes comes to the task at hand, no matter what it is
[52:39.890 --> 52:43.130]  that you're doing and you'll you'll always do better.
[52:43.730 --> 52:49.610]  And as far as like the no-till thing, like people would like
[52:49.610 --> 52:52.250]  when they when that came to be, they're like, oh, yeah, no till, no till.
[52:52.250 --> 52:56.410]  And I was like, yeah, man, I'm not telling that or throwing it away.
[52:56.410 --> 52:59.130]  Like, yeah, your cover crop and this and that.
[52:59.130 --> 53:01.730]  I'm like, I don't know. Oh, that's not no till.
[53:02.410 --> 53:05.490]  Like, bro, I'm just I'm just doing my thing, man.
[53:05.490 --> 53:07.170]  I'm just I'm just doing my grow.
[53:07.170 --> 53:10.730]  And, you know, like I mulch it like when I strip off my lower thirds,
[53:11.130 --> 53:13.690]  you know, I always take the scissors and I would mulch it up real good.
[53:13.890 --> 53:14.730]  Throw it on top.
[53:14.730 --> 53:16.610]  Throw a little bit of kashi on there.
[53:16.610 --> 53:19.730]  You know, I'm getting you know, I'm getting a little similar
[53:19.730 --> 53:22.970]  similar job going, but, you know, I'm not I'm not trying to grow
[53:22.970 --> 53:27.210]  beets and weird weeds and shit on my on my soil.
[53:27.210 --> 53:28.290]  Like, that's super cool.
[53:28.290 --> 53:32.890]  Like outside, you know, I've seen people do that in greenhouses and outdoors.
[53:32.890 --> 53:36.970]  It's just it just wasn't my jam, you know, for for what I was doing.
[53:37.370 --> 53:38.490]  Like, I'm all about it.
[53:38.490 --> 53:42.530]  You know, whatever, whatever, you know, people like to do.
[53:42.530 --> 53:45.450]  It's just it didn't fit well.
[53:45.450 --> 53:46.890]  With with what I was doing.
[53:46.890 --> 53:52.490]  So with that being said, like, don't just roll with whatever
[53:52.490 --> 53:55.610]  just for the sake of it, you know, like you got it, you got to
[53:56.730 --> 53:59.810]  do what works for you in your environment, in your space, right?
[54:00.290 --> 54:03.050]  Because, you know, not everybody's space is the same.
[54:03.050 --> 54:04.850]  Not everybody's around the same thing.
[54:04.850 --> 54:07.690]  You know, you really got to dial in your space, your plants
[54:07.810 --> 54:09.970]  with you and your regiment, you know what I mean?
[54:10.290 --> 54:12.010]  And just try to.
[54:12.370 --> 54:16.330]  You know, accommodate this plant the best you can, you know,
[54:16.370 --> 54:20.010]  and you're going to be able to do that with knowledge and education.
[54:20.650 --> 54:21.210]  So.
[54:22.930 --> 54:23.450]  Read a book.
[54:24.650 --> 54:25.130]  All right.
[54:27.090 --> 54:27.490]  All right.
[54:29.610 --> 54:33.930]  And then I kind of wanted to get more into, especially at the at the basic level,
[54:33.930 --> 54:36.770]  I was hoping that you could kind of explain to a newer person
[54:36.770 --> 54:40.450]  that was wanting to buy genetics, especially during the fall, winter months.
[54:41.730 --> 54:44.970]  What does it really take to be like a hype breeder?
[54:45.730 --> 54:47.050]  What are they actually doing?
[54:47.050 --> 54:49.370]  Can you kind of break that down from your point of view?
[54:50.050 --> 54:53.010]  And then I'd love for you to talk about, you know, why
[54:53.210 --> 54:56.690]  why the work is so important to to put in the work
[54:56.930 --> 54:59.090]  if you're going to sell that to the community.
[55:01.170 --> 55:05.450]  Oh, man, you're going to hit on it on all the points, aren't you, buddy?
[55:06.210 --> 55:10.930]  Oh, and like this to make sure like I'm understanding,
[55:10.930 --> 55:13.410]  like when you say like a hype breeder, you're talking about
[55:13.890 --> 55:16.010]  the some might take in the whoever that is.
[55:16.050 --> 55:20.770]  Yeah. But how easy it is to be that I'm not trying to call out anything.
[55:20.770 --> 55:23.330]  I'm just saying, like, how easy it could potentially be
[55:23.330 --> 55:24.770]  when someone doesn't put in the work.
[55:24.770 --> 55:28.010]  And then if you still, you know, if you still want to rock those genetics,
[55:28.010 --> 55:30.330]  that's you. I just want people to be informed.
[55:31.010 --> 55:34.290]  Yeah, I think another way to say it to Duke is to
[55:34.890 --> 55:37.450]  what do you look for in your breeder, your breeder?
[55:37.450 --> 55:39.730]  What's a who's a breeders breeder? You know what I mean?
[55:40.570 --> 55:42.730]  Yeah, I got you, man.
[55:43.130 --> 55:45.850]  So as far as how simple it would be,
[55:47.330 --> 55:52.570]  you could I mean, I've observed it being even worse.
[55:52.570 --> 55:55.730]  I was going to say, you just go out, get the new hype plan.
[55:56.450 --> 55:59.570]  It can be bought somewhere, you know, probably like a nursery or whatever.
[55:59.570 --> 56:02.210]  But even if it isn't, I've seen people say, oh, I got it.
[56:02.570 --> 56:04.010]  And it ain't even it.
[56:04.010 --> 56:06.250]  Just use the name slap, whatever on it.
[56:06.250 --> 56:12.130]  They'll go by seed company, ABC, whatever kind of mail or maybe reverse something.
[56:12.130 --> 56:14.290]  Hit it. Throw it in some packaging.
[56:14.650 --> 56:16.530]  You know, they don't name testing and nothing.
[56:16.970 --> 56:18.970]  Slap a dessert name on it.
[56:18.970 --> 56:21.370]  Be like, all right, roll it, you know.
[56:21.370 --> 56:23.730]  And people are like, oh, man, you know, I need that.
[56:23.730 --> 56:25.050]  I need that. I need that.
[56:25.050 --> 56:26.970]  Then they get it and they grow it.
[56:26.970 --> 56:29.610]  Or maybe they don't. Maybe the seeds don't even germinate.
[56:30.170 --> 56:33.010]  And it's just not what they want.
[56:33.010 --> 56:34.850]  And then they get burned and.
[56:37.330 --> 56:39.010]  You know, they're unhappy.
[56:39.010 --> 56:42.730]  So what I look for.
[56:48.690 --> 56:51.410]  I look for somebody who's
[56:51.610 --> 56:55.250]  who's one starting, it's grabbing my interest, you know,
[56:55.530 --> 56:59.370]  they're doing the type of thing like if you're looking for
[56:59.370 --> 57:02.490]  something to eat, somebody that's like they're they're cooking what you're
[57:02.490 --> 57:04.570]  what you want. So it's going to start there.
[57:04.810 --> 57:06.690]  So obviously you're looking for something.
[57:06.690 --> 57:10.810]  Your search is like you to to this person or this company.
[57:11.570 --> 57:14.210]  From there, I'm looking like how much.
[57:15.170 --> 57:19.050]  Do they actually get into to to doing what they're doing?
[57:19.050 --> 57:23.610]  Like, is it just a thing that we're doing this to do it,
[57:23.730 --> 57:27.770]  you know, just to have it out there, or is this like a project that they want to do
[57:28.610 --> 57:31.530]  for them or, you know, something that they're passionate about?
[57:31.530 --> 57:34.330]  So I guess I'm looking for passion, you know,
[57:35.490 --> 57:38.170]  that they're they're really doing it for,
[57:38.170 --> 57:41.610]  you know, a reason other than just chopping some shit together and getting paid.
[57:43.730 --> 57:45.850]  I like to see that there,
[57:45.850 --> 57:50.210]  you know, that there's a little thought process behind what they're doing
[57:50.210 --> 57:53.210]  and that they do have like an end goal.
[57:53.210 --> 57:56.930]  I like to see them growing up and like actually testing it.
[57:57.450 --> 58:00.690]  And having having a thought on, you know, like,
[58:01.330 --> 58:02.890]  you know, this is what's happening here.
[58:02.890 --> 58:06.090]  They turned out good and the project's done.
[58:06.290 --> 58:08.890]  And here now to now to be offered.
[58:10.930 --> 58:14.130]  I like to see people that offer
[58:15.010 --> 58:17.210]  some some support on their side.
[58:18.050 --> 58:21.850]  It's really a weird thing now because you'll get people
[58:21.850 --> 58:24.650]  that don't even grow certain people shit and they
[58:25.610 --> 58:28.530]  they'll troll them just for the sake of doing it.
[58:28.530 --> 58:32.810]  You know, so Internet trolls, weird people, they've kind of fucked that up
[58:32.810 --> 58:34.930]  a little bit, but you still got a lot of them out there.
[58:34.930 --> 58:37.850]  If you got a problem, they'll walk you through it.
[58:37.850 --> 58:40.730]  They're not greedy with the knowledge
[58:40.730 --> 58:44.170]  and they'll stand behind their product after after the sale.
[58:45.690 --> 58:49.930]  Those are those are the primary things that I'm looking for, you know.
[58:50.690 --> 58:52.410]  So it's grabbed my interest.
[58:52.410 --> 58:55.050]  They're actually putting in putting in the work.
[58:55.050 --> 58:56.450]  And there was an end goal.
[58:56.450 --> 58:59.490]  And you actually see them come to that, you know,
[59:00.730 --> 59:04.010]  if you're if you're hitting all those notes like you're probably
[59:04.850 --> 59:07.690]  you're you're going to be happy, you know, at the end of the day.
[59:08.090 --> 59:11.210]  And it's like there's a lot of guys out there that don't
[59:11.610 --> 59:14.130]  literally do any of that and they make money.
[59:14.130 --> 59:18.090]  But I mean, they only they only get away with it for so long.
[59:18.090 --> 59:21.610]  You know, you're only going to, you know, get get one over so many times.
[59:22.170 --> 59:25.570]  So but you'll notice that a lot of these other guys
[59:25.930 --> 59:28.050]  have been around, you know, a hot minute.
[59:28.330 --> 59:30.410]  And there's a reason why they've been around a hot minute.
[59:30.410 --> 59:33.010]  It's because they're they're doing good work, you know.
[59:33.170 --> 59:36.930]  So it's like the equivalent of Amazon reviews to, you know,
[59:37.210 --> 59:39.250]  you'll hear input from other people.
[59:39.250 --> 59:41.970]  And generally, if you got a lot of people saying really good things,
[59:42.410 --> 59:46.050]  you're you're you know, you're probably going to be in good hands, you know.
[59:46.410 --> 59:50.010]  And we do have a lot of a lot of people
[59:50.450 --> 59:53.610]  out there that are still still doing good, good quality work.
[59:54.170 --> 59:56.810]  Unfortunately, they don't get put in the limelight
[59:57.650 --> 01:00:01.210]  a whole lot because they don't they're not focusing on hype.
[01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:05.250]  So and a lot of the hype guys are the ones that are going to get your press.
[01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.730]  And, you know, everybody's going to be talking about it.
[01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.610]  So it's kind of unfortunate, but it's on you.
[01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:11.770]  Like you seek it out.
[01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:15.450]  Like, I mean, they're there, you know, like the good shits there.
[01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.570]  It's got a, you know, kind of we throw a little bit of the
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.010]  the the bullshit, the shit that's like right in your face, you know,
[01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:25.490]  like walking into a store, all these ads and discount shit
[01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.770]  right in your face, right off the bat.
[01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.050]  You know, you really got to get into the store before you,
[01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:34.050]  you know, start making your mind up, you know. So, yeah, that's I think
[01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:39.370]  I kind of attribute it like, you know, a horse breeder or a dog breeder.
[01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.170]  You know, you know, I used to breed dogs back in the day.
[01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:45.330]  And my thing is, if you're going to breed dogs,
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.650]  then you should know that that dog can do what it's supposed to do
[01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:50.850]  before you breed it.
[01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.690]  I think it's probably the same way with cannabis, like so many people,
[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:57.330]  like you said, run it, slap a label on it, put it out there.
[01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:01.410]  Like, what about the testing part where the consumer can feel comfortable
[01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:02.770]  that that shit is legit?
[01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.210]  You know, and I think that's valuable.
[01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:11.970]  Yeah. And like I come from a world, too, is like, you know, I'm if
[01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:16.250]  I don't want to like put something out there and be all fucked up and wrong.
[01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.850]  And then before you know it, you might be at a show or something.
[01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.290]  I should you might be walking down the street.
[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:26.010]  So I run up on you and I can stab your ass and beat the shit out of you.
[01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:26.810]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:30.770]  Like back in the day, like people's freedom was on the line.
[01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.450]  So like if you were going to waste somebody's time like that, man, you might
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:38.130]  you might expect to ass whipping at the minimum, you know.
[01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:43.050]  So, you know, even though like I mean, maybe, you know, it still is
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:46.090]  in certain people's position, but at the end of the day, man,
[01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:48.170]  it's somebody's time, man.
[01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.810]  You know, even if like, you know, there's people that need it for medicine,
[01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:54.690]  you know, or it just it doesn't matter.
[01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.530]  You're dealing with somebody's time and energy.
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:01.130]  And if you're fucking somebody out of that, like times prices,
[01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.570]  they can't get that back.
[01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.170]  So you got to you got to do the right thing
[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.170]  and make sure that, you know, their time is well spent
[01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.450]  and they're getting what they want.
[01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.770]  And at the end of the day, they're they're happy with that.
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.450]  Otherwise, man, I just wouldn't be able to.
[01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.170]  It wouldn't sit well with me.
[01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.970]  I just couldn't, you know.
[01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.250]  Yeah, you got to do it for the right reason, man.
[01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:22.530]  Your heart's got to be in it.
[01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:26.010]  And I think the problem with today's industry is that there's so many
[01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:29.290]  consumers that they can fuck off
[01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:33.770]  thousands of people getting a pack a pack. Mm hmm.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.320]  Can you hear him, do?
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.240]  No, no.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.480]  It sounds like, Marco, you're muted or the sound went out on you there.
[01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:53.010]  Try again. Unmute yourself there.
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:54.290]  Is there.
[01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:57.930]  Here's Marco.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.300]  I will while he's fixing that.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.140]  Edit. Yeah.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.300]  Throw it. Yeah.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.620]  Let's kind of let's talk about some of those genetics that you're known for.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.980]  You know, OK, so
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.620]  a newer a newer farmer is kind of at least has the cautionary tale
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.980]  to say that you need to research your genetics, because myself included,
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.340]  that was the last thing I thought about trying to buy all the lights
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.460]  and the tents and the whole thing.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:29.620]  And then finally to get the it was it was really hard to be able to achieve that.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.020]  So I hope that the newer farmers see that we're going more towards,
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.900]  you know, kind of you want to work from the genetics on down.
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.500]  Everything, obviously, is important.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.220]  Your environment is extremely important.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.300]  But I just wanted to put that footnote that genetics need to be more important
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.820]  than you probably assume.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.260]  And it's multiplied.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.260]  I feel like, Duke, when you're fortunate enough to be in kind of like
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.060]  a commercial setting, when you're able to grow thousands of plants,
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:04:00.100]  those little tiny mistakes or shortcuts that some of the somewhat famous
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.700]  and famous breeders out there, when that's magnified,
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:08.180]  it is disheartening because people look at you like, you know,
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.060]  you don't have your shit together.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.940]  And when a lot of that time is just falling for things
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.340]  that you probably shouldn't have fallen for.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.700]  You know, I when I enjoyed playing poker shortly for for profit,
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.860]  I felt like that was one of those things is like when you call somebody
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.060]  and they weren't bluffing, you thought they were bluffing.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.780]  You just felt that kick in the in the gut.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.060]  And it felt brutal because it was
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.900]  it was for a decent amount of money, you know, and on the commercial level,
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.860]  I feel like you get that same kind of feeling and kick in the gut,
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.980]  kick when when it's worth that, especially when it's not yours
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.420]  and you're trying to represent and continue to build things.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.020]  And a lot of that comes back on to genetics.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.260]  So I wanted to kind of then go down the road with you on how you're doing
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.740]  the work, putting in the work so that people can realize from from, again,
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.620]  a breeders breeder.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:01.140]  This is somebody that a lot of the people that you're probably
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.860]  currently growing look up to.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.300]  And I want to put that caveat on there because we're lucky enough
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.420]  to have you on the show, man.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.180]  And I feel like, you know, you're kind of let the social media shit on fire
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.580]  since you've been out.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:16.780]  So just something that you're good at, man.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.020]  So let's kind of talk deeper into the breeding of the genetics.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.860]  And Marco, if you're back, if you wanted to add anything.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.840]  I don't know if he can hear me, so let's let's run.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840]  Still working it out.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.400]  Yeah, we're still working that out.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400]  Oh, you're cool, man.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.360]  What up? Yeah, there you go.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.520]  Hear me now, man.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.080]  Oh, yeah. And there's one more.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.720]  All right, Marco, so I was going to let him kind of run into why he's known
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.360]  as like a breeders breed or somebody.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.040]  Right. Always a technical issues.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.440]  So let's let Duke kind of run into that.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.640]  And then hopefully, Marco, we can figure that out.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.720]  Right on.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.240]  So like where everything starts for me is like
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.400]  there's a there's an end goal in mind.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.560]  So this goes for like sounds like they're working.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.600]  That's not have a great show.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.840]  So everything would start for me
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.480]  with an end goal in mind. Right.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.160]  And this goes for like, you know, me, like anybody's watching.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.640]  It's like, hey, I might be looking into doing my own breeding.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.720]  And just because you're looking at doing your own breeding,
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.960]  it doesn't mean you're trying to, you know, be like, you know, slinging seeds
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.760]  or, you know, doing your sport living.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.120]  There's nothing wrong with making your own things, you know,
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.320]  for your own life and because, you know, you might be different.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.840]  Is this something out there that you haven't seen done that that you want done?
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.600]  I mean, like you should be, you know, do that. So.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.280]  So keep this in mind, like while I'm talking about, you know,
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.080]  like, you know, the way I'm working through this is start with an end goal.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.360]  The end goal could be something
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.520]  medicinally, right?
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.800]  Something I might treat, treat myself with
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.800]  anxiety, you know, pain,
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.760]  not being able to sleep, insomnia,
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.920]  maybe something to, you know, be like high octane during the day to work on.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.560]  You know, I used to deal a lot with like sick kids and autistic kids and everything.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.560]  So I made some things, you know, that kind of lean more their way
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.080]  or maybe it's preservation, right?
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.680]  Maybe something's not around anymore.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.120]  You got the last dinosaur egg on earth.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.520]  You know, you're trying to preserve that
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:59.920]  or, you know, maybe it's a smell taste that you're that you're looking for.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.080]  Whatever that goal is, you know, start, start there with the concept of the goal.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.160]  As you're going along, you know, you're going to have a lot of different
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.600]  tools in your toolbox to get to the get to the end goal.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.000]  As far as your toolbox, it's up here.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.480]  So knowing knowing what to do and everything.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.560]  And, you know, you can you can read, you know, on it,
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.520]  talk to others about it,
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.680]  filial breeding, back crossing and crossing everything else.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.800]  You can you can you can and you can do it and you can see the result
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.200]  and it might work in one thing, it might not.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.640]  Other that's that's that's the whole part about this is like we're growing out things.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.240]  We're making selections based on our senses, you know, eyes, face, smell, you know,
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.600]  and what's desirable to us. Right.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.080]  So as we're going along this this this process and making our selections,
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.680]  our selections are also got to be based on, you know, once again,
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.600]  going back to our toolbox and our knowledge of like how these how these things work,
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.720]  making selections and males and not just in the females and knowing
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.800]  what we're looking for in the male genetic to pass along.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.640]  So a lot of that's going to come with experience, trial and error.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.600]  And, you know, doing each step the best way you can and not accepting
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.840]  mediocrity because mediocre shit is going to give you a mediocre result.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.920]  So take your time, you know, do the numbers and find that.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.480]  And find that. And if it's not what you think it is, don't be afraid to just
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.080]  shit can it and move along, move along to the next thing.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.520]  So as you're as you're moving forward, I mean, and maybe what you want to do is going to end
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.040]  at a F1 hybrid, you're going to grow out a bunch, you're going to find it, you got your plan,
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.720]  then you're done with someone who is going to sell them.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:19.680]  Um, you know, maybe maybe that's going to work as F1 or maybe you, you know, you plan to
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.440]  really stabilize a certain phenotype that you got.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.360]  And, you know, maybe you're going to try to cube it or maybe you're going to keep two
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.400]  separate lines, two separate males and then, you know, combine those at the end.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.960]  You know, this might be a hell of a long project.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.840]  You might pick the F6, you know, whatever.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.840]  But just, you know, meet or exceed your goal and do it right.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.040]  And if you're happy with it, you know, that's that's number one, right?
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.720]  If you're doing it for you and furthermore, if you have high taste, right?
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.360]  And you're happy with it, more than likely, you know, a lot of other people are going to
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.720]  be really happy with it as well.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.480]  Now, as far as that goes, it's kind of like cooks.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.080]  Um, you know, your best steak is only as good as the best steak you've ever had.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.160]  You know, so if you've been eating at a TNA truck stops, you know, 499 T-Bones forever
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:21.440]  and you never had Ruth Kress or had anybody really on the grill, that's the extent of
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.480]  your knowledge of good and quality.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.040]  So, you know, get out there, you know, and know, I guess, know where you're at.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:35.120]  So the more diverse your palate is for things, you know, it's going to help you in your long
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.240]  term, help you in your long term goals as well.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:47.280]  So, um, just start with the goal, you know, learn, learn the fine aspects of it and take
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.320]  your time with each step, do it right and don't don't short that shit.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.040]  And you're, you're gonna, you're gonna have success.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:12:01.600]  Yeah, that's, that's, that's basically how I go about it in a, um, in a short, short,
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.760]  short way of putting it, you know, um, I go through a lot more, a lot more steps because
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.520]  mine was, you know, you know, available to all.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:18.160]  So, you know, there was a lot of things I was trying to keep in mind, um, with, with
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.320]  the, with the end user in mind, because it might be some guys been growing forever.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.080]  That's just like, so on point, you know, and he rocks out or it could be a first time grower
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.160]  that has the worst environment in the world.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.080]  Um, so, um, or they, they just might, you know, like I said, overdo everything.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.320]  So I was looking to make that experience better on the end user.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.000]  Um, I make selections through some stress testing and shit, because I might have three
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.480]  winners and they're all about the same, but one seems like, you know, a little more, a
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.960]  little more heat resistant or, or whatnot.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.040]  So, you know, if, when it comes down to picking all three, like they all hit the marks on
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.040]  everything, one's a little more heat resistant.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.080]  I'm going to go with that one.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.440]  And hopefully, you know, with each step that I'm looking for the, the main, the main things,
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.320]  my potency, smell, flavor, um, structure, and all I'm trying to improve every little
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.160]  thing I can with each step while I'm there.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.760]  And by the time you're at the end of it, you're doing good.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:24.720]  And also in the, in the testing phase too, I'm looking for any little kinks, man.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.320]  If these things are just calcium monsters and they just, you can't give them enough.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.000]  That's something I need to know.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.640]  And that's something that I need to know and make sure the end user knows, because I don't
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.600]  want them growing and having a bad, bad result.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.880]  And when I could have just easily said on the back of the pack, Hey, you know, weeks,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.760]  you know, one through three, um, with these bad, bad girls, you're, you're going to want
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.360]  to supplement, you know, a lot more calcium than you normally would.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.440]  So, you know, look out for that.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.520]  Um, if a plant was a little bit light sensitive, you know, I'd want to put that there.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.240]  So you're not automatically blasting these things on, you know, super high output on
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.160]  the lights and then wondering like, Oh, I wonder if I'm overwatering or if it's something
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.560]  like that, you know, so passing that, that knowledge on to the next person.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.680]  So they're not having to figure it out for themselves, you know?
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.760]  And then let them know at the end, you know, it's like, well, you know, out of these, you
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.320]  know, you know, three phenos that you see commonly, this one's growing like this, this
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.160]  one, like this, this one, like this smells are typically this on this one, this one,
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.280]  this one, this one, this one.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.120]  And, uh, you know, kind of give them an idea of the results that way when they are shopping
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.960]  around and looking for what they want, they can read that and say, Hey, that sounds like
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.560]  my thing or like, you know, the smell of garlic and rubber just does not sound like what I
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.320]  want at all, you know?
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.120]  So they can make an educated decision on what they're going to get beforehand.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.160]  And then if they do go through with that, they, they have, they have the, the, the knowledge
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.560]  on the back of it to say, okay, you can avoid these things to grow at the best that you
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.880]  can, whether it's the guy that's been growing forever or the new grower, it's good shit
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.760]  to know.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.440]  And, you know, I can know that it's been grown and it's gonna, it's gonna perform for both
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.960]  of those and anybody in between.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.640]  So that's where I was looking to be more as like a person that puts things out there for,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.280]  for everybody, because I don't, I don't know whose hands it's going to be, you know, but
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.440]  at the end of it, you know, no matter who it is, I want to be happy and I want to be
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.920]  in a successful because you just, like I said, the end of it, you're dealing with people's
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.280]  time, whether it's for money or medicine or just, you know, getting tore down, like, you
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.800]  know, I want to be happy and their time should be well spent, you know?
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.240]  One thing I like Duke is, and I missed a lot of that guys that had a little technical
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.800]  difficulty, but one thing I like, man, can y'all hear me?
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.040]  Okay.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:51.840]  Go ahead.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.200]  Yep.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.840]  So one thing I like, man, is when a breeder, like I asked a guy, I said, Hey man, which
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.440]  phenos should I look for?
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.000]  You know, and he hit when his answer back told me that he wasn't ready because when
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.760]  he answered back, he just sent me a picture and said this one, you know?
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.400]  So I like, I like when a breeder says, well, look for, you know, if you see a purple one
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  or a silver or, you know, certain things like that, give me a little bit more to go with.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.000]  I like that kind of experience.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.840]  That means you put your time into it and you know, that there's a few different phenos
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.600]  and ones better and ones maybe not preferred and that kind of stuff.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.800]  So much respect for that.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.320]  Yeah, man.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.120]  Cause my thing, like I used to get that question a lot too.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.840]  And my quick answer was always like, well, I mean, whatever, whatever one you like the
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.920]  best, but I, but like, you know, I tell him like me personally, I had like these three
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.200]  most common ones.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.640]  I like the one that was a little more tall, tall and a little bit blankier.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.040]  It typically had the terpene profile, but I was like really, really shooting for, but
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.680]  the shorter ones, they're like, they're super awesome and potent.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.800]  It's just, eh, the smell of it, not exactly what I was going for.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.800]  It's, it's unique all on its own.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.120]  That's the things like, you might be all about that.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.880]  You know, where I was, you know, all about the other one, but I can at least tell them
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.640]  like, this is what you, what you got.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.840]  This is what you're going to get.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:18.000]  And, you know, these are, you know, this is my personal, you know, what I like the best,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.200]  but you know, everybody's different, you know, like they'd said on Chappelle, some people
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.840]  like their pickles or cucumbers pickled.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.040]  Huh?
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.080]  What?
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.560]  No.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.960]  So being more on the East coast, you know, you're known for your genetics, Duke.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.000]  You really know for kind of like classic genetics, like Afghani genetics, skunk genetics,
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.320]  were you kind of making chess moves strategically consciously when you were going out collecting
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:50.960]  that kind of stuff?
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.880]  Cause it seems like you were able to collect stuff that even other breeders have kind of
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.080]  given you a tip of the hat, like, damn dude, you got the real shit over there.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.880]  Um, no, not really.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.320]  It was just like, that's what I liked, you know?
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.360]  So it, you know, it kind of, kind of worked out that way.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.840]  It's like, that's what I really liked as you know, me personally.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.680]  And like I was saying before, it's like, if you like something, there's a pretty good
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.600]  chance a lot of other people like it too.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:26.080]  Um, so yeah, it was just more of my, just like kind of my personal, personal liking
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.160]  of what I, what I like.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.960]  And it just so happens a lot of other people, you know, they're, they're really into the
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.880]  same, same type of things.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:39.120]  Um, I guess we're where it's fortunate.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.440]  Um, you know, I liked, you know, good, good Kim genetics and, you know, I was fortunate
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:51.440]  enough to meet, meet Greg, you know, way back in the day before he blew up like crazy and
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.160]  he was nice enough to, you know, hook bro up and trust me with some stuff.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.760]  And that was super cool.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.640]  Um, family that grew and had, had good things.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.880]  And, um, along the way, having, you know, having met some really, really good, good
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.920]  people in this world that also had similar interests and similar things that would share
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.160]  things, you know, we'd share things back and forth.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.640]  So it was kind of, it just kind of worked out that way.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:28.400]  And when I was doing, doing my thing, it's like my overall goal, um, it wasn't to appease,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.880]  you know, everybody else.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.200]  It was, I was trying to appease me.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.080]  I was trying to make things that I really liked, or I was going after a medical need
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.440]  of somebody else that I knew.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:47.360]  And, um, through that, you know, you get to pass in some of it around and people are flipping
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:47.840]  out over it.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.400]  Like I said, if you, you like something, you do a good job on it more than likely a lot
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.440]  of other people will too.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.280]  So it just all started, like I said, with a goal during the breeding of what I had doing
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.080]  the best I could at it and, um, doing it for me or like I said, out of a medical need for
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.040]  me or somebody I knew and then, you know, helping, helping others out, you know, to,
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.360]  to get that, you know, because certain things, you know, they get lost every time.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.960]  If they're not preserved or, um, you know, the work isn't further and everybody gets
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:25.040]  caught up on, you know, the latest hype thing or whatever, we don't, we don't move forward.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:30.320]  You know, we kind of get stagnant and it's happened in the past and things start getting,
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.800]  getting lost, you know, the whole, I mean, since I've kept up with it from pretty heavily
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.440]  from say 98 and on, um, you just see like trends, right?
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.560]  So like you have the blueberry thing for the longest time and then, uh, you know, that
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:53.120]  led into, um, oranges, which led into the, to sours, which led to chems and OGs and then
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.680]  back to, back to orange and then lemons.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.640]  And, you know, you hit these waves where it's just overwhelming all one thing.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.520]  And during these times people focus like the chase and the dollar or whatever they, you
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.960]  know, you start losing things.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.200]  And then by the time that waves over, go back, Hey man, you got such and such or
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.920]  like, Oh man, I had my room full of whatever.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.440]  I was hoping you still had it on and I was doing the same thing.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.160]  So things start getting lost, you know?
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:28.480]  So, um, you got a lot of good dudes out there that are like very good on the preservation.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.280]  Um, they're preserving things in the pure.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.160]  I also got people taking old stuff and, and, and making new stuff with it, which was super
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:36.880]  cool.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.600]  My buddy, Bob Hempthill, uh, his, his company was crickets and cicadas.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.440]  You know, you can check him out.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  Um, he, he does really great work.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.320]  Um, AKA bean brains.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.600]  If you ever mess around with him, uh, he's on Instagram.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.080]  He does great preservation work.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.840]  I mean, those are his boys.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.200]  Um, and like, I mean, there's a lot of other people that that's just, their jam is just
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.520]  preservation preservation, even whether or not they're selling it or not, you know,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.880]  they're still making sure that things are preserved before they get, uh, extinct, if
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.120]  you will, or, or watered out, you know?
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.600]  So that's a, another big thing.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.920]  But once again, it goes back to passion and what they're wanting to do.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.520]  And you know what people do.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.600]  Thank God there's, there's people out there like them doing that type of work.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.400]  Cause it's tedious.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.360]  Hey Duke, is there anybody right now that, um, and I know hopefully your stuff was preserved
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.080]  when you went away.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.720]  Is anybody who would you recommend has the closest stuff of yours right now that people
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.880]  can get, or is anything even available right now?
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:50.720]  Um, it might be some stuff left, uh, let's see tier now of mine.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:23:00.400]  Um, I would, I would, yeah, I would say if you're talking like people with the same style,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.800]  you know, that, that they kind of do that old school type funk and everything.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.080]  Um, hold on.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.120]  Yes.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.480]  All right, guys.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:16.880]  Yeah.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.040]  Yeah.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.160]  I gotta go do that.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:24.400]  But, uh, AK, AK mean brains and, uh, crickets and cicadas, uh, hit them up.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.280]  I'm sorry, fellas.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.120]  I gotta, gotta cut this short and handle this real quick.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.720]  How much longer are y'all going to be on?
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.960]  We can wait for you and chop it up.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.080]  If it's, I don't know how long it's going to take.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.400]  I'll tell you what, I'll shoot you a text and see if you're still on.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.120]  All right.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:41.680]  Sounds good.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.720]  Of course I'm on mute and now I'm big technical challenges.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.440]  You are big.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.000]  Yeah.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.800]  For those that don't know, I mean, Duke, Duke just got out.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.640]  So what is he doing with his time?
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.040]  I mean, can you imagine, I tried to convey this.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.680]  I don't know if I did before, but, you know, before COVID happened, imagine all the shit
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.760]  that's happened in the world and life and all that kind of stuff that whole time.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.960]  Duke is behind bars.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.600]  The whole thing, he gets out after all of that.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.520]  And from a variety of different podcasts, the way he's reaching out, what does he do
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.160]  with his time?
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.360]  He's back at educating.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.400]  And unfortunately he doesn't really have a lot of his work to be able to start to profit
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.040]  off of things.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.840]  He's just a gentleman that always gives his time.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.880]  And that's why I'm one of the biggest proponents.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.920]  Hopefully, like, you know, individuals start to see that we have to kind of almost in a
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.960]  way, almost vote for our politicians in this industry.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.040]  We, not everybody has a voice.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.040]  So we need to have some people out there that just continue to speak the truth, whether
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.280]  that offends some individuals or not.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.840]  I still feel like you need those type of people that are going to step up, be leaders, talk
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.960]  about when things are fucked up, talk about when things are great.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.600]  And I feel like Duke is a gentleman that's definitely worthy of carrying that flag among
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.000]  other individuals in the industry.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.320]  I just, for a lot of newer farmers, they might not know that, you know, that he was around
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.960]  because unfortunately, you know, he was locked up for basically two years.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.520]  So I just wanted to add that little caveat that, you know, can you imagine all the things
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.240]  you would want to do?
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.760]  He's obviously at a halfway house right now and then things will obviously improve and
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.840]  he'll be able to get back to what he's trying to do.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.520]  But the fact that he's just continuing to tell stories, give out information and give
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.080]  his time to the community is exactly why so many people rock with him.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.240]  I mean, it's just, there's your proof right there.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.360]  Definitely.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.120]  Like this is my first time meeting him and I definitely rock with him.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.680]  First of all, he knows his shit.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.880]  I can see that right away from talking to him and just overall love, man, from the community.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.400]  You know, somebody with that much love, just fresh out, you know, that was a good person.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.720]  So definitely glad to see this man out, looking forward to being able to talk to him some
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.480]  more on his breeding.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.440]  It's so crazy for me, man, being in Virginia and he's throwing out years like 98, you know
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:09.760]  what I mean?
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:16.720]  That's when I was pretty much young buck, just starting my thing out on my own little
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.360]  world, man.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.680]  And he was right there 20 miles away, right, you know, right down the road.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.320]  So it's so crazy how apparently, you know, you're going through life, man, how you can
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.120]  be so close to being with somebody and then you never really touch them until the time
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.520]  is right.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.800]  So I'm glad that brother is here, man.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.560]  I'm glad I'm getting to know him.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.120]  It's awesome.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.360]  I was really stoked that you asked him, Brian, about the trichomes and to kind of break things
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.520]  down on a basic level.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:51.360]  It's amazing when you find a person of his caliber that is able to relate that.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.560]  So easily and understandable to somebody who's never touched the plant, because again,
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.040]  exactly his point, don't touch the plant.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.920]  But that's your initial reaction for any home grower, you know, anybody trying to get started.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.120]  That's what you want to do.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.000]  You want to smell it.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.640]  So he expanded on a lot of awesome things there that you asked, but it was completely
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.960]  approachable and understandable.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.400]  So that's very refreshing.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.960]  Yeah, and unfortunately, the gentleman that used to run the Indo Expo, he was really big
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.800]  on the educational side of things.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.360]  And that's another place where I felt like Duke and a few other breeders out there really
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.920]  started to shine within the community because they had a small platform where there was
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.800]  an hour or two.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.360]  And then it seemed like every year, you know, Indo Expo was kind of like this annual thing
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.600]  and it was starting to kind of be like the best of the best breeders would go up there
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.720]  or the hottest breeder maybe of that year would go up there with panels and you would
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720]  get to kind of pick their brains and stuff like that.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:55.760]  And time after time after time, the number one requested person was Duke.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.360]  And I feel like it shows because he is maybe more of a southerner, you know, that he's
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.080]  not he's not trying to impress anybody with his big words.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.400]  But at the same time, if you really listen to him speak, there's extreme wisdom in a
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.480]  variety of things that he talks about.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.560]  If he comes back on, I was actually hoping that he could talk about a few things that
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.640]  he shared on the Adam Dunn show so that people that do kind of gamble with their life, play
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.080]  with things in ways.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:29.040]  Marco, you and I kind of talked about that on a different show and was hopefully gave
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.800]  some guidance that people want to do that.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:37.040]  But the real things that happen and that go on in prison are extremely scary to someone
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:43.600]  that's never experienced that or to actually see real violence is extremely isn't the right
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.200]  verbiage for that.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.600]  It's eye opening on a whole nother level if you've never grown up with stuff like that
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.120]  and to experience that and to minimize those things.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.080]  So hopefully it comes back on.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.800]  But if not, I do want to give a tip of that to Adam Dunn show.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.600]  He was interviewing Duke last week and he was talking about some goofy things like chicken
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.320]  beer and secondhand sandwiches.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.120]  I'm going to let you guys go and research that stuff if you want.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.640]  Don't ever take a secondhand sandwich in prison.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.680]  I don't know how cheap it is.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.200]  Know where things come from.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.240]  Know especially, you know how we always talk about farm to table.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.840]  Know where farm to table is within that system.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:31.840]  Otherwise, you are going to get hit in the face with some eye opening information on
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:38.160]  what people do to survive in there and ways to create capitalism.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.440]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.640]  I've heard all the stories.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.520]  A lot of the guys I grew up with have been locked up, man.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.360]  Thankfully for me, I was never one of them.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.400]  I was always fortunate.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.280]  But yeah, I've heard the stories, man.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.400]  And it's not a game in there for sure.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.920]  Rule number one, you said it, Chad, but don't accept shit.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.160]  No, thank you.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:58.720]  I'm good.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.720]  Once you start accepting things and you start owing people things.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.640]  And I just like the way that man lives his life.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.520]  He's always giving.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.560]  When you're always giving, man, you don't owe nobody shit.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.920]  You know, I pay my dues.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.640]  I'm giving.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.280]  I'm giving.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:13.920]  I'm giving.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.200]  So, you know what I mean?
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.760]  And that's one thing I respect about him.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.480]  That's pretty dope.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.920]  We got I mean, a lot of things he was saying, man, is very similar kind of coming through
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.760]  the subsoil, the super soils, you know, and all that stuff, man.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.360]  That's kind of I think that's a lot of folks progressions, you know what I mean?
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.680]  Coming through the game and the ultimate goal being I want this.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.000]  I'm going to ultimately be as clean as I can, you know, no chemicals.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.280]  And I think that's key, man.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.320]  Don't be stagnant.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.320]  Like he said, what if he had stopped when he was, you know, 10 years ago when he was
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.440]  using other methods?
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.880]  You know, you got to keep growing.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.400]  You got to keep trying new things.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.880]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.960]  I guess Brian fell off on this a little bit.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.880]  Yeah, he's probably resetting his microphone or the headset again.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.920]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.840]  You know, a lot of people will say, you know, if it's broken, why fix it?
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.200]  But you can always be kind of pushing the limits a little bit more as well.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.440]  You know, that's that's one thing I tend to think about.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.680]  You know, sometimes the people with, you know, just experience may get a little comfortable
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.640]  or complacent, whereas the person with just the knowledge doesn't really have the understanding.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:30.640]  But when you kind of merge the two, you're able to see new things, but apply that old
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.200]  experience.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.480]  And that is just it's hard to be, in my opinion.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.800]  Yeah, you can't beat that knowledge plus wisdom is understanding like those three things.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.480]  They all go hand in hand.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.320]  You can't have one without the other, really.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.040]  Yeah, he said another thing real big.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.800]  He said out there for folks, he makes a change.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.400]  You make one change at a time.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.840]  If you have an initiative, you don't make 10 changes because you don't know what the
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.160]  just worked or didn't work.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.400]  You know, that was huge right there.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.480]  Little things like that are just gold nuggets.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:07.120]  Yeah, I feel like hopefully today, if he comes back on, it'd be even even better for us.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.960]  But it's kind of like a behind the scenes of like what it takes to to be an elite farmer.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.280]  And then when you actually hear what they say they're doing, just sound principles, you
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:22.720]  know, I mean, it's kind of it's it's kind of silly, I feel like because, yes, of course.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.360]  How do you how do you get successful in things through experience, repetition, the whole
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360]  10,000 hours mantra?
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.920]  And I feel like if you don't abide to that philosophy, you're never going to get and
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.720]  achieve the goals that you're after, because it does take a while to do these kind of things.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.720]  I feel like a lot of us have always said this is kind of a four year degree.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.080]  If you're on this on your own, then you need to look at this as like, all right, I'm going
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.640]  to take four years to really understand this.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:53.360]  And then at that level, I should be able to really grow medicine for myself, minimize
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.400]  a lot of mistakes.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.640]  But, you know, from the first year or two, I feel like there's so many mistakes that
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.880]  you don't even know you're making unless you're being proactive, watching shows like this,
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.080]  listening to other podcasts and that kind of thing.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.080]  The mistakes are going to be made no matter what.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.280]  And that's why real talent and artwork comes from the trichomes.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.680]  And that's why I wanted to start that show off and so that you guys can hear from one
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.480]  of the best to do it, what it takes to achieve that.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.960]  And again, it's all coming down to trichomes.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.640]  And since our most of our industry seems to be moving towards concentrates, then obviously
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.280]  that is the end goal and the skill set that a lot of you newer farmers or want to be farmers
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:39.520]  that are moving into living soil want to move into taking it, I guess, in my opinion, to
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.000]  the next level by farming with microbes.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:47.600]  And that really is the difference is you're using Mother Nature instead of yourself, basically.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:54.560]  So the plant is consistently relying on you, whereas with more of the conventional living
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.920]  soil style methods, the goal is that the plant and the system is taking care of itself.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.720]  There's a mantra.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.200]  Oh, no, I just forget.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.480]  Feed the soil, not the plant.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.480]  Like one of the main mantra, especially to kind of kick these things off.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.440]  So, Mark, I kind of wanted you to talk about some farming things, because I feel like you're
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.760]  so good at pumping out information.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.520]  And so we're, you know, we're live TV, basically.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.480]  So fill in some time, hopefully, if he comes back.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.760]  I love what you've been doing, man.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.720]  I love how you're explaining certain things, breaking down just even with the rooting gel,
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.880]  cloning gels and that kind of stuff that that goes a long way.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.400]  There were even some organic farmers here that were using commercial organic farmers
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.760]  here that were well respected, that were still having to use crutches like
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.160]  hormones and that kind of thing to be able to clone at the commercial level.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.000]  So behind the curtain, I still feel like a lot of things go on, even though
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.040]  everyone claims to be certain things.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.000]  Yeah, man, and that's all part of seeking more knowledge.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.440]  Like I posted today what Brian's talking about on my Instagram,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:12.320]  a three tablespoons of fresh aloe vera fillets, three tablespoons, two tablespoons of honey
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320]  and then a teaspoon of cinnamon.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.680]  I put it in a mortar and pestle, ground it up.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.920]  And where I got this from, just like you said, man, like I did some commercial work in the past
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.920]  and we can get into that another time.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.080]  But one thing I discovered in doing that and researching the products,
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.040]  which a lot of times if you're working commercial and I heard
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.320]  Joe's guest on Thursday show, young man, y'all had in the facility out there,
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.920]  I forget his name, last week.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.120]  Stoney Jacks 420.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:43.600]  That's right.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.560]  Stoney Jacks.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.040]  Duron.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.240]  And the young man said some valid things.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.920]  He said, you know, a lot of times when you're working in a commercial facility, it's not yours.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.400]  You have to work within their rules.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.600]  So when I was doing that and so I said, OK, that's their rules.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.640]  I'm going to work within it.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.560]  But now you're calling yourself organic.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.200]  So now I'm researching the products you're using.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.160]  And one of the ingredients in Clonex and the dye of Clonex is a poison.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.680]  So that's that's one way you kind of have to go into certain situations.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.400]  Like he said, even you have to show them showing his talent.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.760]  So anyway, you know, kind of.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.520]  So that was the rooting gel.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:27.600]  And back to Brian's point, and we were talking about what Duke is growing.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.760]  Like a lot of people message me back.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.720]  They say, well, I use aloe and that works great.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.120]  So what's why do I need the honey and the cinnamon?
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.360]  Well, you don't.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.880]  My first response is if you got something rocking for you, keep it going.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.760]  I also use aloe, but I also wanted to step up and try this because I learned it from
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.200]  a friend who's from India.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.560]  And it's a practice that they use when they're when they're grafting trees, when they're
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.320]  propagating and those kind of things.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.520]  The aloe has like the enzymes and the growth hormones.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:04.960]  The honey is an antiseptic and it has some antibacterial properties.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.960]  Two reasons why you can cut your hand and you can put honey on it.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.800]  Honey doesn't expire.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.040]  We talked about that on the show a few weeks ago.
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.200]  I believe it was with Think Like Nature.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.760]  So that's the reason for the honey.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.160]  And when you have when you have a cutting, one of your main things is, yes, I love my
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:22.640]  fungi.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.840]  I love my bacteria.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:24.640]  I love all that.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.440]  I'm living soil.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.720]  But when I have a cutting, my first goal is to get that cutting the root and that cutting
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.600]  may not want all that microbiology.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:33.920]  Right.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.680]  So then now when you add this aloe, which is going to give it growth hormone, you add
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.720]  this honey, which is going to help heal the cut you put and give it that those properties.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.120]  And then the cinnamon is an antifungal.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.120]  So this rooting gel is I think it's going to be a great way to just get another step
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.560]  away from chemicals.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.840]  Aloe works great, then keep rocking with it.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.280]  But if you want to try something new and step your game up, try this.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.840]  You know, it makes sense to me that the science and the methodology makes sense.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.720]  So, you know, I've been trying and it seems like it works pretty well.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.120]  And on a deeper level, what's going on with adding the cinnamon?
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.160]  So the cinnamon is the main point of the cinnamon is the antifungal properties.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.960]  And so what that's doing is it's just sometimes you get a cutting and it may dampen off.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  But what will happen is you take a clone.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:27.760]  Very healthy.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.320]  Looks good.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.800]  Depending on how you clone, some people do aeroponic.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.040]  I'm not going to mention brand names, but aeroponic sprayer type, or you can just dip
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:43.360]  it in this honey mix I just mentioned in a rooting cube.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.200]  But what happens is sometimes that clone will dampen off.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.120]  And a lot of times that's from a fungi that's in your that just gets into it and it just gets in
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:59.040]  there and it'll make this the bottom of the stem soft and brown and it won't be able to uptake
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:38:59.520]  nutrients.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.600]  So the cinnamon is supposed to help protect that wound, that open wound from any fungi
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.560]  that might get in there.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:13.040]  Just keep the just basically keep a nice, clean environment for roots to be able to propagate.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.480]  Now, I'd imagine the quality of the honey matters because from what I understand, when
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.120]  I read the back of labels and stuff, basic honey is not even honey anymore.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.920]  It's just high fructose corn syrup in a bear bottle.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.560]  Yeah, you guys got to watch your honey.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.200]  Some honey.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.160]  Read the ingredients.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:30.560]  Start.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.040]  You got to read the ingredients on everything, guys.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.480]  Like, I mean, this sounds stupid, but there was a point a few years ago.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.600]  I don't know if it's still the case, but Breyers Ice Cream changed their name to Breyers
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.000]  like frozen dessert.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:44.480]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:52.160]  So in life, all these companies we were talking about before capitalism, you know, they don't
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.520]  give a fuck about us.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:00.160]  If they replace ice cream with frozen ice dessert and the people still buy it, they
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:00.880]  don't care.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.200]  The people buy it and it's not as good for your body.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.080]  They don't care.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.600]  They care about the bottom line.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.720]  So read your ingredients.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.080]  Like Brian said, there's honey.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.880]  It's like the ingredients will be like corn syrup.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:11.680]  Corn syrup.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.640]  You know, even like at a restaurant, the packs, I don't think it was maybe Popeye's used to
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.600]  be real honey, and some of them are gone to now like fake honey in the packs, you know?
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.600]  So, yeah, get quality ingredients.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.680]  I feel like if you're going to buy these things, buy what's suitable for you to eat.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.120]  Like if I'm going to buy honey and I'm going to use it to clone, I'm going to buy quality
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.520]  honey that I wouldn't want to eat myself, you know, just for the price of it.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.160]  I think it's well worth it to not cut corners, you know what I mean?
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.840]  So and just going on down, like some of the stuff Duke was talking about, like I wrote
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.560]  down his one through six, you know what I mean?
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.960]  Number one, he said building biomass.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:54.560]  Huge.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.960]  If y'all don't get this, this is giving me chills because we're growing trichomes and
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.080]  the only way you're going to get a lot of trichomes is by having a lot of biomass.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.280]  So his step one, focusing on getting that plant really big and healthy, then going into
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:13.760]  flower.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:20.080]  Now you got a substrate for all these triches to grow on and it's just going to increase
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.480]  your overall final product, you know what I mean?
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.520]  Number three, you know, letting the plant grow to its potential.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.160]  You know, that means so much to me.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.440]  I'm a huge proponent.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.120]  I'm always going a little longer than a little short.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.560]  That's just me.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.600]  I'm always just going to err on the side of letting my plants go just a little longer,
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.560]  just four days more, you know, whatever it may be, because I really want to let those
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.600]  trichomes tell me when that plant is ready.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.240]  I want to use those as an indicator.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.640]  And I know all of you guys know that you take a loop, a magnification tool, and you look
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:02.080]  at those individual heads on the trichomes and, you know, you want a majority of them
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.120]  to be cloudy.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.840]  You know, you don't want a majority of them to be clear.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.200]  They start out clear and as the plant ages and matures, they turn to cloudy and then
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.480]  from cloudy to amber.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.080]  Along the way, your high is affected as well.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.880]  You know, early harvest, you know, they say it's more, you know, you get a heady, you
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.920]  don't get all that full high, you know, nice and cloudy with a little bit of amber, you
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.120]  get that full body.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.160]  And if you just let it go all amber, they say it's a late night, just puts you on your
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.560]  ass, you know, because there's a window.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.240]  It's going to degrade after a while.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.080]  So growing a plant to its potential is huge.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  And then I tagged on to that.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.680]  The little tip about popping the little nugs off the stem, I do that.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.000]  Like, that's one of my little things and that hit home, you know, those are, but see what's
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.480]  so brilliant about him is I have all these little things I do, but I don't think that
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.480]  to that, you know, because it's second nature to me.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.920]  He has the know-how and the knowledge to say, well, hold on, the new guy needs to know this.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.560]  Or a lot of times I'll kind of pass over that.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.520]  So that's huge for getting a proper dry.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.040]  Like he said, man, you want to slow dry.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:21.600]  Don't be in a rush to put your stuff in a jar, you know, use a, you know, I don't mean
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:28.400]  in a jar, I mean for long term, like, you know, like he said, when it feels crispy to the touch
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.320]  or, you know, it's crispy, put it in a jar, close it for 24.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.360]  When you open it the next day, it's going to be wetter.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.400]  That's a process.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.840]  That's a slow dry.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.120]  You want to slow dry.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.480]  If I was to take cannabis and dry it all in one day and a dehydrator, that was the best way.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.760]  That's what we would all be doing.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.560]  But the slow dry is key.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:54.480]  One thing I do in that slow dry process, I leave some of the little bit more of the sugar
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:01.200]  leaves on my stuff just as kind of like a little bumper, kind of a protector as a kind of a crown
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.800]  around all the trichomes.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.480]  I kind of wait to the very end right before I'm, you know, going to be using my meds before
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.440]  I take those off.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.040]  Then the trim, like you, like Duke was saying, man, be gentle with your trim.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.000]  Take your time.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.040]  Don't be rough.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:17.760]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.880]  You're dealing with, you took all that time to grow this stuff and now you want to be
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:23.280]  rough.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.600]  You know, if you're going to be rough, be rough and veg.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.520]  That's when the plants need to be roughed up, you know, get them tough.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.080]  Get those stems rough, you know, move them around.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.920]  But once they start flowering, man, they're babies then.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.960]  They're back to babies.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.920]  You just let those babies do their thing.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.760]  And then the cure, you know, that's all part of drying, you know, take your time.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:49.360]  He is very valid when he says, you know, everyone says, well, if it's a dark ash, it's, you
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.640]  know, it was grown with chemicals.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.680]  It was white ash.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.360]  It was all good.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:59.280]  Well, you can have fresh, all natural farming, zero chemicals.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.720]  But if you, if you smoke that too soon after drying it, you'll get a terrible burn.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.000]  So there is value in that slow dry, just taking your time.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.640]  And he mentioned even, you know, a fine wine.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.360]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:20.480]  These are all things that you young guys and anyone, myself, old guys, like, you know,
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.760]  I always care for my trichomes and I tend to them.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.480]  But when you hear guys like B. Leaf came on and was saying the same thing, and you got
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.920]  Duke saying the same thing.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.880]  And then, you know, I say it and everyone says the value of what you're growing is trichomes.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.960]  Gotta be gentle, man.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.000]  Don't squeeze shit.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.280]  Don't come in my, bro.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.160]  Don't touch shit.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.680]  Don't squeeze nothing.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.200]  If you want to, we can grab you one from down low, like Duke said.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.360]  But yeah, just in general, guys, you know, those are kind of what I took from what Duke
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.480]  says so far, man.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.400]  And I think that it's valid stuff, 100%.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.440]  Well, and again, what does the end product look like?
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.520]  The artwork, you know, you mentioned B. Leaf.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.040]  That guy's on a whole nother level.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.240]  And I feel like he's just coming out with hit after hit, you know.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.400]  And Duke's the same way.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:14.960]  There's just so many people out there that do put in the work.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.440]  And then because maybe they don't give a fuck about Instagram, and that's unfortunately,
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.920]  basically, where everybody is at this point.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.320]  There's been other apps that even tried to have a community.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.400]  One here in Denver known as Mass Roots and, you know, mismanagement, not having enough
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:30.720]  funds.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.000]  That killed that whole little side, hopefully side industry that I thought that would be
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  social media where people could show things.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.360]  Mass Roots really started to take off like the first year or two.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.600]  But I guess at the end of the day, to host all that information as things started to
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:53.520]  grow, it's just astronomical what it costs to maintain that kind of stuff.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:00.080]  And so here we are back to Instagram, where I feel like everybody doesn't really want
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.200]  to be on there anymore, myself included.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.440]  I mean, it's just it's a necessary evil because of it's effective.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.800]  That's where everybody's at.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.360]  Yeah, man, it's the grams, you know, I love sharing the content, man.
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.160]  I love all the guys I've met along on there.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.680]  It's just it's like a gift and a curse.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:27.360]  Like, I love that I've grown from just my first post was probably about a bird sitting
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.840]  on my fence in my backyard a few years ago.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.320]  And I love that I've grown and increased the followers.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:38.080]  But I think the guys you guys got to understand that folks that are that are, you know, we're
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.960]  teaching, it's difficult to get hit with a lot of questions that we say over and over
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.440]  and over.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.240]  And that's where we you know, I want you to meet me halfway.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:48.800]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.120]  I take time to put all this shit out here.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.920]  Do puts time, time, putting stuff out there.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.760]  Everyone's taking their time to put it out there.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.040]  So, you know, maybe instead of just immediately if the guy gives you a tidbit and you don't
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.280]  know about it, maybe go search it first.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.160]  You don't have to.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.760]  He's dropped you the knowledge, right?
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.200]  He gave you the seed.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.480]  So you don't necessarily have to go right back to that guy and say, well, can I also
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.160]  have some water for my seed?
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.000]  You know, go outside of him now.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.280]  Start seeking shit out.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:18.640]  I told you, aloe, honey and cinnamon.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.080]  Look it up.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.600]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.120]  Don't trust what I say.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:23.760]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.880]  Don't don't put your whole grow on my what I say, you know, take a piece of what I say
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:29.520]  and try it.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.800]  Say, oh, shit, that works.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.000]  I'm going to do it more.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.800]  You know, and that goes for everybody out there, guys.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.600]  There's a lot of guys making a lot of claims out here.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.680]  And there's a lot of younger folks who think that because this guy in this position is
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.280]  making this claim that it must be valid and it must be something that I need to put my
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.880]  money into or my, you know, or buy or whatever.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.440]  But I just encourage everybody, man, research that stuff, man.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:03.200]  If a guy is OK, we've got a million followers and he's doing something, read and research
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.000]  what happens if you do this in soil.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.840]  How does this affect plants?
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.040]  And then and then dig deep into it, man, and seek that knowledge and even question the
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.240]  person, say, man, why do you you know, why do you say this works?
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:23.600]  You know, but our industry will get stronger when everyone is held accountable and called
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.480]  out on bullshit.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:30.320]  And then also everyone gets back to that, you know, help helping out like we're doing
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.040]  on this show.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.440]  So when you guys hear someone on the show, share it, you know, and share the show if
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.760]  you like it and if you think we're spreading good knowledge.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:45.120]  I think our community is kind of like like comedy people when sometimes people steal
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.240]  jokes and individuals don't want to call that out.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:55.200]  And then maybe our industry needs to have the Joe Rogan, Carlos Mencia moment where
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.360]  he is called out and then people find out what behind the scenes, what is going around.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:07.280]  So, yeah, man, it is kind of silly what some what some people are getting away with within
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.000]  the community.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.960]  So just again, shout out to Duke, shout out to people that continue to come on here.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.280]  You know, there's probably a million things that he would love to be doing.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:23.120]  He's stuck at a halfway house, but he's still going out of his way to continue to
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:29.200]  give back to the community, which, again, I feel like is that's a rare individual.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.960]  You know, it's a rare breed that people conduct themselves the way that that Duke
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:41.200]  does from when you meet him two years ago or whenever to now.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.960]  You know, I was able to meet him in 2018.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.840]  He still talks the same way, you know, but on the forums and stuff, I feel like you would
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.600]  known him for for years on end.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:58.880]  He's he's one of those that was on there as well, giving away knowledge extremely freely
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.360]  because he was the one that was also talking about grocery stores, especially in the forums.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.640]  I felt like sometimes there are people, but behind the scenes they would talk about products,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.920]  you know, granted, they're just trying to help out.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.560]  But at the same time, for the ones that want to learn to grow like more like a living soil,
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:21.680]  especially at that point at your career, you don't really want the training wheels of the
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:22.560]  bottles anymore.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.440]  Like you're almost willing to kind of fuck up or maybe have some deficiencies as long as you
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.200]  feel like you got the playbook.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:29.440]  Right.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.520]  So we're not throwing we're not throwing like 100 percent completion passes.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.040]  But at the same time, you know, if we're out there, 90, 95 percent, we have a extremely
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:45.680]  viable business or extremely viable medicine, medicinal aspect to add to our family and
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.400]  friends.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.280]  That is a skill set that I hope we all.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:55.440]  Hell yeah, brother is a skill set that I hope that that we all continue to pass on and give
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:02.560]  to others, because if we're not farming medicinal cannabis and the in the large companies are
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.680]  just going to continue to pump out the booth and everyone's only concerned about, you know,
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.720]  price, that doesn't make sense to me, because some of the people that talk about how important
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.120]  nutrition is, I know that they don't smoke that way.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.280]  Or if you have a family, I know that it's hard.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.720]  It's extremely hard to smoke.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:25.440]  So, Duke, now that you're back, buddy, hopefully we can really rock, you know, rock with you on
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:31.120]  a variety of different subjects, because there's just a few other things that I wanted to talk
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:31.440]  about.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:37.200]  And I gave you a tip of the hat again to the secondhand sandwiches.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.760]  I think you called it and the chicken beer.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.360]  There was a question right before you had to leave for a little bit.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:50.320]  I think it was more like, have you been messing around with LEDs before your hiatus?
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.160]  And if so, like, what are your thoughts on that?
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.520]  Oh, we got audio, audio issue.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.640]  Can you thumbs up us if you can hear Duke?
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:04.520]  You can hear us.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:07.160]  OK, we're not able to hear you at the moment.
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:10.520]  Unfortunately, we can readjust, reset.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.320]  This one's for the books, Chad.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:19.800]  I know.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:24.680]  It's almost a Friday the 13th now.
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:25.880]  Exactly.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.560]  Hopefully he'll get it on soon.
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.280]  Yeah, well.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.520]  I love LEDs, man.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.920]  I think I'm hot on them.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.880]  I think they're wonderful.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.920]  Yeah, I mean, when they first came out, they were kind of common.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:37.720]  They were shit.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:40.120]  Yeah, the blurples and all that was horrible.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.560]  I never got into it back then.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.320]  It was like everybody had an LED company or something.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.280]  Yeah, trash.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.040]  Still can't hear.
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.320]  That's what when I left, I had to readjust my mic to settings.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.000]  Yeah, you have to go through it because that happens with my mic.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.600]  It's probably going to happen here in a second.
[01:54:04.290 --> 01:54:06.290]  So they're working on that, Marco.
[01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:11.250]  Some of the genetics also that Duke's kind of run through is the G13.
[01:54:11.250 --> 01:54:12.850]  Had you ever heard any of that lore?
[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:16.290]  Yeah, I believe it's from Mississippi and all that kind of stuff.
[01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:17.490]  Yeah, government lab.
[01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:19.170]  Government labs.
[01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:20.850]  I did hear all that, man.
[01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:25.170]  That's just legendary shit right there.
[01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:28.850]  Well, looks like everyone's doing it.
[01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:30.690]  Brian's dropping out his microphone.
[01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:31.970]  Hey, Duke is back.
[01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:32.770]  All right.
[01:54:32.770 --> 01:54:33.890]  Yeah, I figured it out.
[01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:35.570]  I got up in here in the settings.
[01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:37.490]  Yeah, I suck in.
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:38.130]  Yeah, man.
[01:54:39.810 --> 01:54:44.530]  Yeah, LEDs, like when they first come out, it's just like really anything, man.
[01:54:45.090 --> 01:54:46.130]  It takes time.
[01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:50.610]  And just like anything, people are just going to be in a rush to put out the...
[01:54:52.290 --> 01:54:54.370]  They want to be the first people to do it.
[01:54:54.370 --> 01:54:57.170]  So they're always going to have kinks.
[01:54:57.170 --> 01:55:01.810]  It doesn't matter if it's an Xbox or electric car or any type of vehicle or anything.
[01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:05.330]  They're always got to have to work the bugs out.
[01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:12.370]  So the concept of it all really was cool because the amount of spectrum that could be controlled.
[01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:21.090]  My only really thing that I didn't like about it was the light penetration that they offered
[01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:21.570]  at first.
[01:55:23.970 --> 01:55:31.090]  You could change your whole girth style around it and do good, but it just wasn't where I
[01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:31.810]  wanted to see it.
[01:55:32.370 --> 01:55:37.010]  Right before I went away, they were doing a whole lot of stuff with it.
[01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:40.530]  And I was actually seeing some really interesting things.
[01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:45.010]  I was like, all right, now they're starting to look like something I would use.
[01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:52.690]  And now I was checking out a lot of the webinar stuff and people rocking out with it.
[01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:59.170]  And I mean, it looks like something I'm going to delve into once I'm able to do that.
[01:56:01.330 --> 01:56:01.890]  I'm good.
[01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:02.850]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:04.050]  Thank you, though.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.020]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.380]  Hey, I went forever, Duke.
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.380]  I ran HBS forever, bro.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:16.860]  Just like last couple of years recently, just went to the new stuff.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.780]  And it's wonderful, man.
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:19.660]  Really nice, man.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:25.340]  And now they've got some new stuff that's spectrum tuning, you know, kind of order in
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.340]  a nose, you want longer in a nose.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:29.820]  Getting pretty wild, man.
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:30.780]  It's new stuff.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:31.180]  I like it.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:32.380]  It's kind of revolutionary.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:34.380]  I think that's the next wave in our industry.
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.460]  Yeah, it is, man.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:40.940]  And like used to be before, like you would have to switch your lamps out.
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:47.820]  So to do what you're wanting to do, like the last, you know, like 10 to 14 days, I always
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:52.060]  wanted to switch to like, you know, back in the old days, switch back to metal halide.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:57.740]  And now they had nice 10k high blues you would switch to to really get that frost to pop
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:58.220]  at the end.
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:04.460]  Yeah, now that you can just adjust it, click on a driver to adjust your spectrum like that's
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:05.740]  cool as shit.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:10.060]  Like low heat production, more energy efficient.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:15.260]  Like, you know, it's tough to beat now you're getting the light penetration with it.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:19.020]  Like, you know, it's changing it changing the game.
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:23.420]  So I'm more than happy to start starting to go that way anyhow.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:29.180]  Well, like you mentioned, Marco, there's still a lot of people that just were rocking with
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:36.780]  the HPS is that's how they their setup was a mutual friend of ours of the show and of
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:39.580]  Duke and myself is Sasquatch.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:44.300]  I feel like he was another guy that was able to kind of like break down really basic shit.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:50.620]  Talk about why he chose your genetics Duke, why he was running basic HPS lights.
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.180]  And then he had this big ass greenhouse.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:58.060]  And I was fortunate enough to go over there and hang out with him for a few days.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:00.380]  And that's a wild motherfucker, man.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:02.460]  You know, yeah, brutal cold.
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:04.220]  And this dude's telling me to cross over.
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:05.420]  It felt like a river.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:11.660]  I mean, it was current was a quick but you know, he's just he's on another level, man.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:15.260]  And I'm sure that he's excited that you're out as well because that's another genuine
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:19.420]  dude that I just feel like, yeah, is going out of his way to just try to grow medicine.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:25.260]  And he's got a little piece of paradise, paradise, in my opinion, that little farm,
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:26.140]  if you've ever seen it.
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:30.380]  Yeah, man, is this a good good all around dude.
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:37.260]  As a people, you definitely want to, you know, surround yourself with, you know,
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.820]  you got a lot of heart and a good heart at that.
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:46.060]  Plus, you know, he's hella awesome at what he does, too, you know, and I always like
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:47.180]  wild people anyway.
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:48.220]  I don't know.
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:49.260]  I don't know why.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:56.940]  But, you know, I like I like people like that that are just genuine, you know what I mean?
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:58:59.740]  They're not trying to win a popularity contest or anything.
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:04.140]  They're just going to be themselves and be good people, you know?
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:06.860]  So, yeah, he's definitely he's definitely an awesome one for sure.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.740]  Yeah, man, and he had it figured out.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:14.620]  He was turning his stuff into carts and those carts were like usually when you hit a cart
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:19.740]  that feels like soccer mom weed, you know, I mean, it's there, but there's not that punch
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.900]  and his stuff was just next level.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:28.620]  I really enjoyed being able to partake in your genetics and then his time and effort.
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:31.340]  And it was just a wonderful experience.
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.420]  Talk about, you know, kicking yourself in the face.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:38.380]  Something else that I liked about that I learned about you from him was, you know, talking
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:43.180]  about the screaming eagle and how that's more of like a family strain for you and why you
[01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:44.940]  named it that way for anxiety.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.220]  It kind of sounds the opposite.
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:51.260]  I believe you also have mentioned before that it's for like PTSD.
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:55.820]  So I kind of wanted to run down that road because I know I've experienced in life, man,
[01:59:55.820 --> 02:00:00.860]  if there's two people or two, you know, two ways to help people in life, it's either kids
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.820]  or veterans.
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:05.020]  It's really hard, you know, not to want to be able to do those things.
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:10.300]  So the fact that you were giving away those extremely valuable genetics so that veterans
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:15.020]  could farm for themselves if they wanted to definitely needed to be mentioned today.
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:22.140]  Yeah, like, you know, that was always the thing is like when it came to, you know, PTSD
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.260]  and stuff like that.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:30.060]  The big thing, like, I mean, back in the day, they just, you know, they didn't really acknowledge
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:30.540]  it.
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:34.060]  You might call it shell shock, you know, so you walk it off or whatever.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:40.860]  And, you know, as time's gone by, there's like, yeah, it's definitely a thing.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:41.980]  Definitely a thing.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:48.460]  But their deal was like, all right, let's take these pills, you know, zombify yourself.
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:53.020]  And, you know, that's not what most people want to do anyway.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:01:01.900]  So I got to, you know, kind of getting big myself because I had my own, you know, bouts
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:02.300]  with it.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:09.980]  And just trying to find something where, you know, I can go out to Walmart or in crowds
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:13.820]  and not just feel so so fucking uncomfortable.
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:21.180]  So anxiety, PTSD was like, you know, the main end goal there.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:28.700]  I had experienced certain things that really worked very well and kind of led me down that
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.020]  path.
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:38.060]  Like my whole my whole family as far back as I can go, they've all been war fighters and
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:42.140]  and have all suffered from that as well.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:50.220]  So the name Screaming Eagle, like my dad, he was on the 101st Airborne and they're the
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:51.500]  Screaming Eagles.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:57.980]  So I know like he suffered with it pretty bad, but he was from that era where, you know,
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.620]  you didn't acknowledge it, you know, you didn't talk about it.
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:06.540]  It was like, you know, considered like, I don't want to say the wrong thing, like, but
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:11.980]  people might think like it would look at somebody look at them negatively or like they were
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:13.420]  weak or something like that.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:19.020]  So, you know, it was just one of them kind of unspoken, unspoken things.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:23.820]  So it was kind of like a thing for him, you know, with the name.
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:28.780]  And then, you know, as the process went on and I really had something that was working
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:31.740]  good for me, I was like, well, maybe it's going to work good for others.
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:36.460]  So everybody I knew that was dealing with the same shit, I was like, you know, here's
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:40.140]  a sack, here's a sack, here's a sack, like, try it out, get it figured yourself.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:42.700]  And they were like, it's working, it's beautiful.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:43.820]  So I was like, all right, cool.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:50.620]  So when I had all of them, I wasn't even selling them, I was just trying to seek people out
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:53.980]  with those issues and give them the seats.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:03:00.460]  Because another thing for me was like having something to do, like a hobby, something productive.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:07.500]  You know, it was another, a very medicinal thing, especially growing, just the act of,
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:13.020]  you know, just growing was medicinal all of a sudden, you know, very calming.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:22.380]  So, you know, the combo of that was definitely pretty awesome.
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:25.900]  And then it was later on, you know, people were just hitting me up like crazy.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:32.940]  And, you know, I had like a handful of them, you know, left and everything, actually let
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:37.660]  the general public get it because there were a lot of people that had people to take care
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:45.340]  of in that regard, that their people weren't, you know, on media to even reach out to me.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:46.300]  So they were getting it.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:51.020]  And then, you know, taking care of their friends and family.
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:55.500]  So like, I'm going to say his name is Sasquatch there.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:59.980]  He's, you know, he was one of those people, like he had an oil timer, old Vietnam vet
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:04.060]  buddy that he got on and he was, you know, hooking out and hooking up with them.
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:08.380]  So that was that whole project.
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:14.540]  And it took a hot minute to make it, but it was really, really well worth it at the end,
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:14.860]  you know.
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:19.340]  Yeah, man, because again, we're getting back to this is medicine.
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:24.940]  And then for some people, they're able to kick the opioid or dial it down dramatically
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:31.420]  and then kick it off when they have access to quality cannabis, especially cannabis that's
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:37.980]  hopefully cultivated for, you know, to take away their ailments.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:44.300]  I know PTSD in reality seems to affect way more people than mentioned.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:50.620]  And maybe it is kind of like how you had said before, it's pretty hard to admit mental
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:55.020]  issues like people can talk all day about certain aspects, health issues, but that's
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.660]  like the last one that people want to kind of admit to.
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:04.940]  So if they do have access to anything but basically synthetic heroin, you know, I commend
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.260]  people that want to be able to reach out and do that.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:13.340]  But the VA and a few other things, I believe that they are the ones prescribing that to
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:18.140]  them and saying that if you choose cannabis, that you actually lose all of your benefits.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:21.180]  So if that's not correct, I'd love to be corrected on that.
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:24.540]  But from what I understand, that that's how they treat veterans.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:29.180]  Well, that is true, Brian, to the most extent.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:34.460]  And Duke made a great point that a lot for a lot of those guys, the act of the farming
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:36.860]  is the is the medicine to, you know what I mean?
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:40.460]  So not only are you so you're kind of getting it on both ends, you're growing it, getting
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:43.740]  that medicine and then you're you got the medicine at the end.
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:46.220]  But for the VA, I can speak on this.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.340]  My dad is a veteran.
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:54.780]  So until the law just changed in Virginia, his doctor, he would say, well, you shouldn't
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:58.300]  test positive for cannabis now that the law has changed.
[02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:01.740]  They can test positive for cannabis without any kind of issue.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:02.700]  So that's a good thing.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:03.900]  So that's that's dope.
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.820]  And he's happy to talk about that.
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:09.660]  I mean, especially as you're older in life.
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.340]  You should be able to choose.
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:17.980]  If they're going to pump you with something, cannabis should be at least you should try
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:18.300]  it.
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:22.060]  You know, for a long time, my parents were anti cannabis.
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:27.580]  Yet they still at one point in life were forcing me to take Adderall, you know.
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:31.660]  So I don't I don't think that everybody understands, like just because it's coming from a
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:37.500]  doctor, maybe more lately, there's been a whole awakening, Duke, since you've been away of
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:40.300]  the fact that nobody talks about the immune system.
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:45.980]  I don't want to get too deep into all that, obviously, but just that nobody talks about
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:47.340]  how magical that is.
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:52.780]  And then, you know, if you can continue to feed it, I've seen a lot of MMA fighters,
[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:56.300]  bodybuilders and stuff say that they've started gotten they've gotten themselves into
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:07:00.780]  gardening, you know, making a little garden because they're starting to see for themselves
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:05.340]  that plant nutrition and overall health nutrition are basically one in the same.
[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:09.820]  You can see that once you improve the gut health, once you improve the root health,
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:14.060]  the plant perks up and then the human being perks up.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:22.140]  And that's why I feel like I wanted to maybe even talk about G13, Duke, the lure of that.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:26.860]  Is that true that that probably came from a government facility?
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.900]  And was it living it up to the hype?
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:33.580]  Because from what I understand, you had the real deal.
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:36.220]  Yeah, I am.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:45.580]  So as a story out, and I have no idea it might be maybe not.
[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:46.860]  I don't know.
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:56.540]  But whatever, wherever it came from, is truth, you know, definitely had a lot of a lot of
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:58.620]  medicinal benefit, everything.
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:07.100]  And the the cutting I used was the airborne in that Screaming Eagle project.
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:12.220]  And also that that played perfect with the name to his 101st Airborne Screaming Eagles.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:18.140]  And it was a dude that used to be on the on the boards named airborne as airborne G13.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.180]  And that was from Neville.
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:24.940]  He did a G13 with an L2.
[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:29.100]  And, you know, he had grown them out and that was his keeper.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.100]  Airborne's keeper was that.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:35.180]  So it has, you know, it's a G13, NL2 hybrid.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.780]  And man, it's awesome.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:39.980]  That's for damn sure.
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:45.340]  And it was a great medicinal thing just alone.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:50.860]  And it was a good building block to work with to make the Eagle.
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:56.620]  And I bring that up because it seems like the powers that be have known that this is
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:09:04.460]  medicinal and how easily the backyard farmer could cultivate this for themselves, alleviate
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:08.780]  a lot of ailments for themselves, seems to be partly one of the reasons why.
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:12.940]  I mean, we could go down a variety of reasons on why things became illegal.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:19.660]  But the fact that the cannabinoids, I feel like the real medicinal value
[02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:25.420]  I feel like is what the pharmaceutical companies don't want the general public to know about.
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:27.980]  I don't think they care about everybody getting stoned.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:32.140]  It's just the fact that now you're starting to change people's lives, pull them off of
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:36.380]  those pharmaceuticals that they're getting pumped with or fed through.
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:41.260]  And they're now able to make a conscious health decision for themselves and say, I
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.060]  understand what you're saying about the research, but I feel a certain way when I take cannabis
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:51.340]  and I'm going to choose this part for my life because I know that this is benefiting me.
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.380]  And that was something that I felt like when I was taking Adderall, I had to stand up,
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:55.820]  kind of say that for myself.
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.660]  If you want, if I'm forced to take something, that cannabis is what I want to do.
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:00.220]  Yeah.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:02.380]  Yeah.
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:06.380]  We know how it started, Brian, like not to get too deep into that, but race is why I
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:08.140]  meant cannabis is illegal.
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:12.940]  You know, at least they used it as a tool against the Mexicans and the other minorities
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:14.140]  of back in the day.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.220]  We all know that.
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:17.980]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:24.300]  I think they're threatened for sure, because like we all know, man, I think this plant
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:25.500]  is a healing of the nation.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:30.220]  If they put enough money into it and develop it, we could probably cure just about anything.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.940]  So my little two cents, dude, what you got, bro?
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:39.740]  Man, I've seen this stuff, people in their own home making Rick Simpson oil and what
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:40.540]  that's done.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:47.900]  I can only imagine if you had like full on, all the power and research behind it, I mean,
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:50.540]  I think the sky's the limit.
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:52.060]  I think you can do a whole lot more.
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:58.860]  I don't think we've even come close to finding that full potential of everything that it
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:10:59.740]  can do.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:06.700]  Because I mean, just from textiles, rope clothing, the oils and just the nutritional things that
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.540]  you can derive out of it.
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:13.580]  There's just so many, so many, so many things you can do with it.
[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:22.220]  So there's so many benefits, but we live in this world where the government's like, yeah,
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:24.460]  you can hit them with all the science and everything in the world.
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:25.500]  And they're just like, no.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.540]  It's like, well, why?
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.260]  Man, we just, because we say so.
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:32.380]  And people just kind of accept it.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:38.380]  It's always what's going on in my mind is like, how can you deny it or continue to keep
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:38.860]  doing it?
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:40.780]  It's like, it's all right there.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:45.180]  And they're just like, well, you know, this guy's, fuck you.
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:46.860]  That's why we're good.
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.060]  We're just going to stay illegal.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:56.300]  So it always just blows my mind how, why we're still sitting, but at least we're making little
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:58.620]  steps, you know, it's going in the right direction.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:04.940]  I never thought I'd live long enough to see any of it wrecked, let alone Virginia of all
[02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:05.440]  places.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.040]  Bro.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.720]  I mean, whoa.
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:13.520]  Like Virginia is a place where like, I'm afraid to go on growth storms.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:14.480]  Like they would stay down.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:15.680]  Ox man.
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:16.800]  Like you didn't even do that.
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:19.680]  There was a dude up in Fredrick's outside of Fredrick's bird.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:25.600]  He had a, like a gross store in his house and he is, and you've probably been there,
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:29.760]  but like everybody would go to this guy because it's like, you couldn't trust one of the store.
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.720]  You couldn't order enough.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:39.920]  I never heard of that Marco, like a underground hydros.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:40.420]  Yeah.
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:41.540]  Yeah.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:47.280]  Is a guy and he was from Lebanon and he had the coolest fig trees, his whole yard.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.120]  But it was like, and if you go like back in the day, if you had to look on the internet
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.360]  to try to find nutrients to grow, somehow he popped up, man.
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:59.520]  And I just made a relationship and went to that guy, but everybody went to that one dude.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.020]  Man.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:00.880]  Yeah.
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:05.120]  I mean, he had to, cause if you were wanting to do anything, uh, if you ordered
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.840]  something, you're, you're liable to get, you know, rated.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:15.280]  Um, if you went to one of the quote unquote, legit stores or whatever, um, there's a good
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:18.080]  chance that the, I was watching you and you were going to get indicted.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:20.080]  And just so happens.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:21.840]  I had a buddy that said a place was cool.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:27.280]  I went there to get some Panda film and not long after that, you know, he, you know, I
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.560]  was getting indicted.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:34.000]  So confidential informant number one was like the best run for ever to get wrapped up in
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:34.560]  his shit.
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:39.760]  And, you know, he just getting to his time, uh, told on me and confidential informant
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:44.880]  number two for them to make their case was the owner of the hydroponic store.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:47.120]  Turned out he had been burning dudes left and right.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.320]  And, um, he'd been, you know, one of their paid paid dudes for a long time, right.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:53.840]  For the right for the DBA.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:00.640]  And, uh, it was crazy because when I was pulling my time back then, um, his best friend that
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.960]  they've been best friends forever, not only did he burn him, but he actually approached
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.840]  him and said, Hey, I want to set up a house.
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:08.960]  You want to run it?
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.480]  I'll supply all the equipment and everything you need to do it.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.920]  And he was like, all right, yeah, cool.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.560]  Best friend.
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:15.040]  Yeah, sure.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.080]  I'll do that.
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:21.520]  And he furnished it pretty good with hidden microphones and cameras and everything else.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:26.160]  And they hit him for every single plant that I could count on camera that he ever did and
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:27.040]  nailed him.
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:32.720]  And, uh, I think he did like, I think he got hit with 10 years because like the total count
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:36.640]  after it said done was like 3000 plants.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.720]  Cause they're counting every client, every, every, every, you know what I mean?
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:45.200]  Yeah, that's real, man.
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:47.280]  I'm saying I had a buddy the same way, man.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:50.160]  He got really, you know how this game is, man.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:50.720]  You love it.
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.200]  Like we grow for the medicinal of it.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:53.680]  You know what I mean?
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:55.600]  And that's why everyone falls in love with it.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.040]  You love growing the plant and it's awesome and you get to use it.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.440]  And so I just, but it got really excited, man.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:06.800]  He was, he had good money and he went and up, took a whole pickup truck load, loaded
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.960]  up with equipment, lights, all that shit, man.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.080]  I told him to be careful.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.000]  And he went and bought it from the right in the middle of the, you know, local shop.
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:20.000]  And, um, next thing you know, got raided and boom, boom, boom, you know, just for trying
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.240]  to grow medicine, you know, this is such bullshit.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.320]  So I'm so happy we've come this far.
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:31.120]  Hopefully this new government or the governor and all, and they do the right thing here
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.000]  in Virginia, man.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.960]  And I think going back to y'all talking earlier about craft cannabis, and I've been thinking
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.280]  about this a lot, man, because I seen how they come and they roll into your state from
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:45.200]  out of state and then they just infiltrate and take over everything.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.600]  So, man, what I'm focusing on right now is just a group of guys.
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:52.880]  We're focusing on hardcore craft cannabis.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:53.760]  You know what I mean?
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:57.280]  Virginia is a crap and Richmond's a craft beer town.
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:01.200]  We're like always number one fucking in the country and craft beer.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.240]  So I feel like Richmond, man, we're going to really hold down.
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:05.840]  We're going to maintain that craft.
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.200]  Northern Virginia, I'm a little bit afraid for them.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:13.760]  I feel like they're going to be like corporates going to boom them out up there, but hopefully
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:18.320]  we can draw a line, man, and, um, and keep it craft, man.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:18.960]  You know what I mean?
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:21.680]  That's key.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.440]  So I wanted to talk real quick about the Dominion skunk because I feel like, you know, obviously,
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:33.360]  how can you talk to Duke Diamond and not talk about the skunk?
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.040]  And then I was hoping if you're okay with this, man, I was wanting you to give some
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.320]  stories for the children, some shit that actually happens behind the scenes in prison that will
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.680]  hopefully wake up some of the people that are out there living like there's no tomorrow.
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:55.200]  Um, with this show, Marco and I, uh, we want to kind of give back and educate on a variety
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:56.160]  of things.
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.320]  We kind of dipped our toe in that Duke a couple of weeks ago when we were kind of giving guidance
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:06.960]  on, um, how, how to drive certain things across states and, and, you know, maybe really, uh,
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.040]  pushing the envelope a little bit too far on that.
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:14.000]  But I feel like with the stories, at least people can see that like, that it really is
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:14.560]  no joke.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:20.800]  And there is a huge difference between getting locked up for a DUI and jail, uh, and then
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:26.240]  actually, uh, going to the, the, you know, the, the proverbial big house, uh, where you
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:29.680]  actually have to fucking man up or you are going to get eaten alive in there.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:34.640]  So, uh, let's talk about, uh, one more good thing and then maybe, uh, sprinkle some bullshit
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:39.200]  on there in life, uh, so that people can really think things through when they're, when they're
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:40.720]  pushing the envelope.
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:53.520]  Well, um, I think a lot of it starts with people don't, don't really realize, like you
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:57.680]  hear stories and like, oh, well, there's gotta be something more to it than that.
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:59.280]  Like they'll, they'll blow it off.
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:09.120]  And, um, people don't understand about, um, Rico and interstate commerce, and they don't
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:11.760]  understand about conspiracies.
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:12.000]  Right.
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:22.880]  So, um, you know, without going any further into that yet, just know that if you know
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:26.000]  anybody that's like really fucking up, right.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:32.480]  Um, you know, you got, you gotta distance yourself from it.
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:38.480]  Um, or not, you know, just not really involved in it at all, but it's just as simple as somebody
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.520]  might be into just name, whatever, whatever you can think of.
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.680]  Um, and they call you up looking for a bag.
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:48.720]  All right.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.360]  Um, they get hit.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:54.480]  You can, you can find yourself in, in their conspiracy.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.920]  Um, there's different, um, levels to it.
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.960]  Um, a leadership role, Kingpin, whatever you are down on the tier.
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:11.280]  Um, the fact is they don't actually have to catch you with anything.
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:16.800]  They just need two people agreeing to that's what you did, but what you had at this given
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:20.880]  date and time, they'll add it all up and it's called relevant conduct.
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:24.080]  And then you're going to be sent it under a mandatory minimum.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:33.360]  Um, and furthermore, it goes up from there based on, um, relative, uh, relative conduct.
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:40.800]  And you're looking at minimum 10 years, but most of the time, 20, 30, 40, 50 years of life.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:45.600]  Um, and it can happen just, just as, just as quick as that.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:49.520]  I mean, in the blink of an eye and you would think, oh, that's unconstitutional.
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:51.520]  That can't happen.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.960]  These pens are full of people.
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:57.760]  It happens every day, every single day.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:19:59.440]  And I know I didn't know anything about it.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.480]  So I was like the first time, um, you know, I'll, I'll distance myself.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:09.520]  I'll find out somebody's on, uh, you know, drugs or anything or, you know, stuff like
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:14.480]  I can't talk to them because just like that, you can get wrapped up in that, you know,
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.040]  one second.
[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:17.280]  Oh, gee, you had it.
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:18.880]  They hit you a conspiracy, didn't they?
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:21.440]  Oh yeah.
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:23.600]  Yeah.
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.200]  255 months.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.220]  Yeah.
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:28.100]  Yeah.
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:29.940]  Yeah.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.240]  So, yeah.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.560]  So you just get wrapped up just, just, just because somebody says something.
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:44.560]  So, um, you gotta, you gotta be, you gotta be, gotta be careful.
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:49.120]  Um, and there, you know, everybody thinks, oh, well, you know, the big government, they're
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:54.720]  looking for these, these big guys, you know, this and that, um, man, they'll, they'll snatch
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:56.240]  you up and fill up a bed.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:56.880]  Look at shit.
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.480]  I know a lot of guys, man, they weren't, they weren't doing anything big and, you know,
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:03.680]  they got, they got slung in there.
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.920]  So, um, they don't care.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.840]  They don't give a fuck.
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.080]  Um, they're going to sling you in the pen and, you know, you can fight all you want.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.360]  They got a 99% conviction rate.
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:22.160]  Um, even if you're in the right, they're, they're still going to sling it to your ass.
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:26.480]  Um, and it's not, it's not good.
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:27.200]  It's not good.
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:30.000]  So you gotta really mind your company.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:36.240]  Um, cause you can get wrapped up in some shit and now you realize it's happening.
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.080]  Not even realize you're doing anything.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:39.920]  You might, you're probably not even doing anything.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:44.160]  Just talking to somebody on the phone and get you, get you thrown away.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.320]  So you gotta, you really gotta watch out.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.880]  So, um, it ain't like the old days either.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:58.080]  Um, so a lot of informants out there, um, I guess at some point snitching became like
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:21:58.720]  acceptable.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:03.360]  So, um, you get a lot of that out there.
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:08.480]  So dudes used to live by the code, you know, like they're far and be between now.
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:13.360]  So you're not really going to find those real standup motherfuckers like, like you used to,
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.480]  you know, it's a dying breed.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:19.840]  So if you think like you're coming up now or whatever, and this dude's solid, it's like,
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:22.080]  it used to be like, yeah, man, you solid.
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:26.880]  What until, you know, that's the key word, the key fucking word until, until what?
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:28.000]  Until he's broke.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.280]  Until he's jealous.
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:29.840]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:32.160]  Until he's looking at 20, 30, 50 years.
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:33.600]  So some dudes can't even do a year.
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:37.120]  They're looking at a year, you know, until what, you know what I mean?
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:40.400]  And then before you know it, you're hearing them all.
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:40.640]  Yeah.
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:42.240]  You know, I had a good lawyer.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:43.200]  Oh, I got lucky.
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:44.160]  Like, yeah, you got lucky.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:44.880]  All right.
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:48.320]  Lucky's in the pen doing fucking life now because this motherfucker couldn't keep his
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:52.560]  mouth shut, wrap somebody up in some shit that they didn't even have nothing to do with.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:57.120]  And boom, you know, he's walking around and somebody's rotting away, you know,
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:59.200]  rotting away in the fucking, in the pen.
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:03.120]  And, you know, it's a, it's a bad, it's a bad deal.
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:09.600]  And it's like a part of society that people don't, they don't see, you know, because it's
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.360]  behind walls, behind fences.
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:17.280]  You know, people, people, people just don't realize how quick, how quick your life can
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:21.600]  just be over, you know, just, you know, it's, it's really bad.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:26.320]  Now I could go on all night with different horror stories and shit like that, but in
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:27.600]  a nutshell, that's, that's it.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:34.400]  Mind your company and, you know, don't, don't get wrapped up in that shit, you know?
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.400]  As far as like inside.
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:38.640]  Yeah.
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:46.000]  I mean, it's really hard to explain to people.
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:52.160]  You've never experienced it, I guess, even something even close to it.
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:57.680]  It's just a really, really strange environment.
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:23:59.520]  It's like, it's like it's a world.
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:03.680]  Things that apply here don't apply in there.
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:15.920]  It's just full of, I can only just think of words, you know, it's misery, hatred, paranoia,
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:21.840]  pain, and, you know, just the most extreme, extreme violence.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.600]  It's not a good, it's not a good spot.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:32.400]  So, you know, it's just packed full of, you know, very, for the most part, very violent,
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.880]  you know, alpha males, you know what I mean?
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:38.640]  You're, you're in a jungle of nothing, nothing but that.
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:42.400]  And, you know, certain people are just, they're always looking for control.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.160]  Some people just like to kill people.
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.200]  That's just what they do.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:49.040]  That's their, that's just what they like to do, you know?
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:52.480]  So, you know, you're, you're surrounded with, you know, some of the worst of the worst.
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:56.720]  Not everybody's like that, of course, but, you know, that's just something that you gotta,
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.240]  you gotta contend with.
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:03.680]  And when you're in there, you know, you're, you're gonna have to kind of leave behind
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:11.040]  a lot of things that humanize you, you know, maybe in regular normal life, but you're not
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.840]  in regular normal life anymore.
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:17.680]  You're there and you gotta focus on that.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.640]  And you're gonna have to, like I said, you're gonna have to suck the fuck up or, you know,
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:25.600]  you're gonna get eaten alive, like I said, and you're gonna fucking die.
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.480]  You know, so throwing hands, knife play, all that shit, you know, whether you want to or
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.480]  not, I mean, that's, you know, ultimately that's up to you, you know, but, you know,
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:40.000]  it's there and it's waiting for you.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.200]  It's not going away anytime soon.
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:52.480]  So just make sure, you know, make sure that you're tighten up, man, you know, don't, don't
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:56.240]  think like, you know, you're gonna, you know, do this and that and do it forever.
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:00.000]  I mean, I've known, you know, I grew up in a pretty wild place.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.520]  I've known a lot of, a lot of, a lot of dudes who do it up big and I can't count on one
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.040]  that ever got away with it.
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.120]  Some just get to do it for longer than others.
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:14.880]  But ultimately at the end of it, that, that lifestyle, I mean, it's gone, it's gone.
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:15.920]  People tell too much.
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.120]  There's cameras everywhere.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.880]  These people are well-funded.
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.560]  I mean, you're just not going to do it.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:26.160]  And it's just not a good way to, you know, it's just not a good way to live, you know,
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:33.360]  so just work hard, do your thing and just, you know, live, live a good life where you
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.240]  don't have to, you know, put yourself in that position and have to deal with that kind of
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:38.640]  shit.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:39.280]  You know what I mean?
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.160]  It's just, it's, it's not good, not good for nobody.
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.120]  And it's just, I don't know.
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:55.200]  It's, it's a, it's a weird thing to have to explain, but I guess I don't, I don't really
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:58.160]  have all the, all the words for that right now.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.320]  You expect, dude, you're, yeah, that's, if there's, we always say gold bars on the future
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:05.360]  cannabis project, man.
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:10.960]  And if people don't understand that, that's the, that's a next level bar, obviously, because
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.320]  the, the, no one really thinks about the risks.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.360]  Everybody always thinks about that.
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:16.400]  They're going to get away with it.
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:20.400]  And most people don't move like chess moves when they're doing that.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:24.800]  And like you had mentioned, the bigger you get, the jealousy comes out and every, nobody
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:26.960]  wants to see you shine if you're shining for too long.
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:36.650]  So, so what do you, like, what do you really think about where things are going?
[02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:40.570]  Like, I know like from the inside, it kind of reflects society.
[02:27:41.770 --> 02:27:43.370]  Sometimes it magnifies it.
[02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:49.770]  Sometimes I heard it's like, you know, you can be in a certain spot where things aren't
[02:27:49.770 --> 02:27:51.770]  popping off as much as they maybe should.
[02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:53.850]  Cause everybody kind of respects one another.
[02:27:53.850 --> 02:27:58.410]  But from the outside 2020, 2021, there was, there were riots.
[02:27:58.410 --> 02:28:00.170]  There was all these things that were going on.
[02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:03.290]  I feel like more and more people, when you see them, they won't even look you in the
[02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:05.290]  eye anymore at the grocery store.
[02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:07.130]  It seems like we've been divided.
[02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:13.850]  Did you guys feel like there was a upper echelon of that kind of hatred and just maybe weirdness
[02:28:13.850 --> 02:28:16.730]  to humanity while you were locked up as well?
[02:28:17.850 --> 02:28:18.410]  Oh yeah.
[02:28:18.490 --> 02:28:24.810]  You know, it's, and like I said, it goes back to things that are hard to explain.
[02:28:24.810 --> 02:28:34.410]  You know, some people are very, they're very sensitive, but I mean, there's, I mean, for
[02:28:34.410 --> 02:28:38.970]  those people, I mean, all I can say is like, there's the way you fucking want to be, you
[02:28:38.970 --> 02:28:39.770]  know what I mean?
[02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:42.250]  And the world, and then there's just the fucking way that it is.
[02:28:42.250 --> 02:28:43.690]  And I think that's what's going on.
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:46.250]  There's the way you fucking want to be, you know what I mean?
[02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:48.890]  And the world, and then there's just the fucking way that it is.
[02:28:48.890 --> 02:28:49.130]  Right.
[02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:57.130]  So don't, don't be sensitive about this because this is just, this is just what it is and
[02:28:57.130 --> 02:28:58.490]  how it is and how it's going to be.
[02:28:59.290 --> 02:29:03.690]  And you know, if you feel like, you know, you can go in there and change the world,
[02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:07.210]  like go ahead and you'll, you'll be dead before the nine o'clock count.
[02:29:08.010 --> 02:29:19.050]  Um, it's, it's, you know, prisons are already very, very segregated by, um, you know, race,
[02:29:20.490 --> 02:29:24.330]  segregated by gangs, um, and groups, groups of people.
[02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:32.250]  Um, so anytime you have say like a riot on one yard and where it gets over to the other
[02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:36.090]  you know, this group of people was stabbing up this group of people.
[02:29:36.090 --> 02:29:39.770]  It's all at war on, on, on that yard too.
[02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:45.610]  So, you know, you got that, um, if you got any animosity, any racial tensions, which
[02:29:45.610 --> 02:29:50.810]  are already at, you know, very high inside, um, anything on the outside is just going
[02:29:50.810 --> 02:29:52.250]  to be amplified even more.
[02:29:52.890 --> 02:29:58.730]  Um, it's just not a, it's just not a, not a good, not a good, good thing.
[02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:04.410]  Um, and then to cap it all off, like, you know, it goes without saying, like, you know,
[02:30:04.410 --> 02:30:06.810]  we don't, we don't like fucking cops.
[02:30:06.810 --> 02:30:07.290]  Right.
[02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:09.610]  So, and they especially don't like us.
[02:30:09.610 --> 02:30:16.650]  So when this whole, uh, this whole, um, blue lives matter shit and cops fucking killing
[02:30:16.650 --> 02:30:22.330]  people and getting away with it and everything, um, you know, they were, they were definitely,
[02:30:22.330 --> 02:30:25.850]  you know, trying to, trying to flex and, and make their shit.
[02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:30.810]  Um, you know, even, even, you know, more so than they already were.
[02:30:30.810 --> 02:30:35.450]  So it leads to fighting with the cops a lot more too, uh, cops getting stabbed up and
[02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:38.890]  everything, which ultimately, you know, that's going to come back on you.
[02:30:39.450 --> 02:30:42.090]  Um, and they're going to make your life hell.
[02:30:42.090 --> 02:30:48.890]  So no matter which way you're looking, is this, uh, you know, total, uh, total chaos,
[02:30:49.450 --> 02:30:54.250]  um, from, from every, every angle that you can think of.
[02:30:54.250 --> 02:31:02.090]  And, um, you know, lots of, lots of writing, uh, lots of, you know, more hatred than, uh,
[02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:04.490]  than what was normally normally going on.
[02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:09.930]  Um, and like, you know, if you ever hear it, when I'm people, it's called politics.
[02:31:09.930 --> 02:31:15.450]  That's what, that's what, um, you know, prison is, you know, groups of people trying to live
[02:31:15.450 --> 02:31:20.970]  with each other, you know, the best way that you can, but, you know, oftentimes, you know,
[02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:24.170]  something, something's gonna pop off and happen.
[02:31:24.170 --> 02:31:25.770]  That's just the nature of it.
[02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:29.690]  And when it does, you know, either, you know, you're either going to live or you're going to
[02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:35.850]  die, you know, uh, some people, I guess are real good about, you know, just, you know,
[02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:41.930]  reading it, you know, and they go hide somewhere, but, um, ultimately people afterwards are going
[02:31:42.010 --> 02:31:44.170]  to be like, yeah, you know, where, where were you at?
[02:31:44.810 --> 02:31:47.930]  And then your end people are gonna, you know, stomp you out, stab you up.
[02:31:48.730 --> 02:31:54.090]  So, um, it's just it, man, when you're, when you're in the belly of the beast, man, you're,
[02:31:54.090 --> 02:31:54.970]  you're there.
[02:31:54.970 --> 02:31:55.850]  There's no calling.
[02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:59.210]  You have somebody like, yeah, I want to go home.
[02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:02.970]  You know, they don't have like magical, I'm sorry, papers that you're going to fucking
[02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:03.290]  sign.
[02:32:03.290 --> 02:32:08.570]  And you're just going to go, you know, you've got your date and it's up to you to get through
[02:32:08.570 --> 02:32:10.330]  each day the best way that you can.
[02:32:10.330 --> 02:32:11.770]  And let's do that.
[02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:17.050]  So that you can make it to that date, you know, going, going home and, uh, just try
[02:32:17.050 --> 02:32:23.770]  not to let it take away, you know, pieces of you, you know, are too much, you know,
[02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:30.650]  and, uh, try to try to get back in one piece and, uh, you know, and then just move on,
[02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:36.170]  move forward and like, you know, pass a little knowledge on, you know, to other people.
[02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:39.370]  So they don't end up in the, in the same, uh, same boat.
[02:32:40.330 --> 02:32:42.810]  That's about, that's about it, man.
[02:32:44.170 --> 02:32:44.650]  Yeah, man.
[02:32:44.650 --> 02:32:48.010]  I, I really appreciate you taking the time to explain this kind of stuff.
[02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:52.250]  Cause I know for certain that a lot of people don't realize that even when, if you get a
[02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:56.250]  year sentence, two year sentence, that like you had mentioned the politics, you're not
[02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:57.130]  going to change that.
[02:32:57.690 --> 02:33:00.250]  So you have to, to choose ride with it.
[02:33:00.250 --> 02:33:02.650]  Certain individuals, a riot breaks off.
[02:33:02.650 --> 02:33:06.810]  Maybe you did have to, to do something that you normally would have never done in life.
[02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:08.890]  Now you have an extra charge up on that.
[02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:12.090]  So there's just so many things that can happen to your life.
[02:33:12.890 --> 02:33:19.530]  Once you're in there, um, the jungle is real and I'm glad Duke that you're giving us an
[02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:24.650]  inside look and taking the time to explain it without any fluff, man.
[02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:26.410]  That's just how that shit is in there.
[02:33:26.410 --> 02:33:29.050]  It doesn't, doesn't really matter your belief systems.
[02:33:29.050 --> 02:33:32.170]  This is how the politics are played in this certain facility.
[02:33:32.170 --> 02:33:35.770]  And they obviously changed from facility to facility.
[02:33:35.770 --> 02:33:38.650]  So you could have a good in one spot, get moved.
[02:33:38.650 --> 02:33:43.370]  And now you got to go through the whole alpha bullshit again, and to get, stand up for yourself
[02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:45.210]  and make sure that nobody's going to fuck with you.
[02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:49.050]  Because obviously if you're weak now, you got at least, you know, if you're in there
[02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:53.050]  for two years, it's going to be two years of just people constantly fucking with you
[02:33:53.050 --> 02:33:53.690]  or worse.
[02:33:54.410 --> 02:33:57.290]  And obviously as a grown man, you never want to experience shit like that.
[02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:59.610]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:33:59.610 --> 02:34:05.050]  And that's the thing, like dependent, uh, dependent on where, where you actually end
[02:34:05.050 --> 02:34:08.810]  up, you know, it could, it could, you know, be, be varied.
[02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:15.130]  So like you could end up in a halfway, uh, like a halfway decent, you know, decent spot
[02:34:15.130 --> 02:34:21.050]  where, you know, people get along a lot better or, you know, you just might walk into something
[02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:27.370]  that has been going on for a decade or maybe longer, you know, just strike between, um,
[02:34:28.170 --> 02:34:32.650]  two groups of people and you just happen to land in the middle of it that day.
[02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:34.890]  It all just jumps off.
[02:34:34.890 --> 02:34:37.370]  You don't even know what it's about, what led up to it.
[02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:43.130]  And that's just, just how it is, you know, um, or you could just land yourself in the
[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:47.610]  middle of, you know, the most rowdy of the rowdy and it's just like that every day or,
[02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:54.090]  you know, it just depends, you know, on the day and what's going on, but all the shit
[02:34:54.090 --> 02:35:00.250]  happening, um, in the, uh, in the outside world, you know, I'm sure it didn't, it didn't
[02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:01.050]  help.
[02:35:01.050 --> 02:35:07.690]  And then you got some weird, you know, virus going around, you know, killing people and,
[02:35:07.690 --> 02:35:12.970]  you know, it's doing the same thing in there and trying to catch it and watching people
[02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:14.090]  drop from it.
[02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:20.010]  And this, you know, it's a fucked up thing.
[02:35:20.010 --> 02:35:25.130]  I hope, uh, you know, you don't have to have to deal with that, you know?
[02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:31.850]  Um, and if you, if you are sick, you know, you put, let's say you are weak and you push
[02:35:31.850 --> 02:35:36.650]  that call button, you know, most of the time they're not, it's not like the Calvary is
[02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:37.450]  coming to get you.
[02:35:38.250 --> 02:35:44.410]  No, you're not over your health, but you're, you're going to have to throw hands no matter
[02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:47.130]  what, if you've never done that in life, you better start doing pushups.
[02:35:48.090 --> 02:35:48.890]  Oh yeah.
[02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:50.810]  Like you gotta, you gotta for sure.
[02:35:50.810 --> 02:35:58.330]  You go stay, stay fit, stay strong, um, you know, and stay very, very observant and everything.
[02:35:58.330 --> 02:36:05.690]  And, um, you know, it's, it's, um, like when those riots pop off on me, it depends where
[02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:06.090]  it's at.
[02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:08.810]  Like, you know, they got snipers and guard towers.
[02:36:08.810 --> 02:36:11.370]  They might just start treating and killing people out there.
[02:36:11.370 --> 02:36:17.050]  Um, you know, if it's inside of a unit, you know, it's probably going to go on and on.
[02:36:17.050 --> 02:36:20.570]  It's going to be a while before they come in there and gas place hours are shooting
[02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:20.970]  people.
[02:36:20.970 --> 02:36:28.250]  So, um, you know, and a lot can happen in one second, let alone, you know, any elapsed
[02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:30.090]  period of time.
[02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:35.850]  So, um, yeah, it's, it's not, you know, it's not, not safe, you know?
[02:36:35.850 --> 02:36:42.890]  So, and, you know, you definitely don't want to have to rely on, you know, some, some fucking
[02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:46.330]  employee to, you know, cause they, they don't give a fuck.
[02:36:46.410 --> 02:36:49.050]  No, you got COVID or whatever.
[02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:52.250]  Their biggest concern is like, oh, I don't want to catch that shit.
[02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:53.210]  You know what I mean?
[02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:54.490]  They don't, they don't give a fuck.
[02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:56.250]  Medical staff doesn't care.
[02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:57.770]  Um, that's the thing.
[02:36:57.770 --> 02:37:02.810]  Nobody, nobody cares, you know, that's the one thing, you know, just, you know, nobody
[02:37:02.810 --> 02:37:03.530]  gives a fuck.
[02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:08.730]  So, um, once you're there, you know, it's kinda, it's just kinda on you, you know, you
[02:37:08.730 --> 02:37:13.450]  just kind of got to go through the motions, do the best you can do and stay healthy.
[02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:14.430]  I don't know.
[02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:17.210]  People complain all the time.
[02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:20.250]  Like, oh, oh, really?
[02:37:20.250 --> 02:37:21.850]  No, I shouldn't have got locked up, dude.
[02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.970]  I was here.
[02:37:22.970 --> 02:37:23.930]  We, here we are.
[02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:27.050]  Yeah, man.
[02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:31.850]  I, I really appreciate the candid aspect to kind of how you're talking about this.
[02:37:32.730 --> 02:37:36.970]  Cause I don't think a lot of people get a behind the scenes kind of thing of what really
[02:37:36.970 --> 02:37:37.850]  goes on.
[02:37:37.850 --> 02:37:42.490]  And unfortunately there's a lot of shows lately that have been on, which, um, just
[02:37:42.490 --> 02:37:46.650]  showed jail aspects and kind of show kind of silly little fights and stuff, but I don't,
[02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:52.970]  I've never really seen anything that I felt like, you know, warranted what really went
[02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:53.470]  on.
[02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:55.130]  Yeah.
[02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:59.930]  Like, you know, um, they got those little, little jail shows and like, that's just,
[02:38:01.050 --> 02:38:05.050]  you know, a little, little petty, you know, a little county jail fights.
[02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:13.050]  I mean, shit can pop off in the, uh, in the counties and everything, but, um, you know,
[02:38:13.050 --> 02:38:15.930]  like, uh, and, and everything, it's way larger scale.
[02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:21.210]  A lot of, uh, a lot of weapons and things like that come up the woodwork.
[02:38:21.210 --> 02:38:26.010]  So, um, it's way, way, way more, uh, way more serious.
[02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:32.810]  So, um, like a full scale riot is fucking insane, you know?
[02:38:32.890 --> 02:38:39.690]  And, um, you know, you can get a hundred, 200 people all killing each other at the same
[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:40.190]  time.
[02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:42.890]  Um, and then the cops trying to kill everybody too.
[02:38:42.890 --> 02:38:47.210]  Like, I mean, it's, it's pretty, uh, it's pretty hectic, you know?
[02:38:47.210 --> 02:38:50.730]  And then once it's done, you know, there's the aftermath of that.
[02:38:51.370 --> 02:38:56.650]  So, um, when it comes off of a lockdown, you know, it's right back at it again, or small
[02:38:56.650 --> 02:39:02.330]  isolated stabbings and shit, you know, guys seeking revenge or whatever, retribution.
[02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:06.970]  You know, do you mind sharing the riot story?
[02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:10.010]  Do you mind like kind of maybe just sharing an overview?
[02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:14.250]  It doesn't have to be detailed or like, how, how does a riot pop off?
[02:39:14.250 --> 02:39:15.530]  It maybe is a better question.
[02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:18.650]  Um, it could happen.
[02:39:21.610 --> 02:39:26.010]  It could happen in a, uh, a variety of ways, man.
[02:39:26.010 --> 02:39:33.850]  Um, it could be just as simple as someone disrespect someone and these group of people,
[02:39:34.410 --> 02:39:36.890]  um, they'll call it a car, you know what I mean?
[02:39:36.890 --> 02:39:39.130]  It might not be a gang, but it's a group of people.
[02:39:39.130 --> 02:39:48.330]  So one car might not discipline their guy, which ultimately leads to the other car that's
[02:39:48.330 --> 02:39:49.450]  been disrespected.
[02:39:50.010 --> 02:39:55.370]  Um, it could have been just as simple as somebody taking something or just talking out their
[02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.870]  mouth.
[02:39:56.410 --> 02:40:00.410]  Um, and then that just leads into something bigger.
[02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:05.930]  Um, it could be guys, you know, like trying to, you know, power struggle.
[02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:09.690]  It could be one guy losing his shit, you know, and he goes and stabs one guy off.
[02:40:10.570 --> 02:40:12.250]  And then that leads into something bigger.
[02:40:13.210 --> 02:40:15.450]  It could be stealing drugs.
[02:40:15.450 --> 02:40:20.090]  I mean, it, you know, if things don't, that's why they call them politics.
[02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:26.570]  If things aren't ironed out and straightened out at a smaller level, they, they, they,
[02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:29.690]  they blow into proportion out of proportion.
[02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:39.050]  And, um, you know, everybody has nothing to do but time and think violence and, and plan
[02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:42.090]  for it, you know, like you literally there all the time.
[02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:49.210]  So all you gotta do is plan shit out, make weapons, you know, so, um, all these different
[02:40:49.210 --> 02:40:53.770]  factors can, um, can lead up to it.
[02:40:53.770 --> 02:41:04.490]  Um, you know, then, and quite a few, you know, um, uh, the one, you know, I was telling you
[02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:07.530]  about, I mean, it's like a hundred men in that one.
[02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:09.850]  Um, I don't know.
[02:41:11.130 --> 02:41:12.330]  Uh, I don't know.
[02:41:12.330 --> 02:41:15.210]  I don't think I'd really even get into it right now for real.
[02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:20.810]  I don't really know how to, um, I don't really know how to put all that into words for real,
[02:41:21.370 --> 02:41:24.250]  but, um, yeah, it was pretty bad.
[02:41:24.970 --> 02:41:30.410]  Um, you know, you had a bunch of people die, um, blood everywhere.
[02:41:30.410 --> 02:41:35.290]  Um, over just, that's kind of where the paranoia comes in, right?
[02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:40.570]  Cause that could pop off at really any time, any moment, any moment, you know,
[02:41:40.570 --> 02:41:41.690]  Marco, you're back, buddy.
[02:41:42.730 --> 02:41:43.530]  Yeah, man.
[02:41:43.530 --> 02:41:44.250]  Sorry guys.
[02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:44.730]  I'm back.
[02:41:44.970 --> 02:41:47.050]  This fucking, can you turn your phone?
[02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:49.210]  And you want me to go this way?
[02:41:49.770 --> 02:41:50.330]  Yeah.
[02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:53.210]  Sorry about that, man.
[02:41:53.210 --> 02:41:54.250]  I really do.
[02:41:54.250 --> 02:41:58.250]  I know I've said this a couple of times, but I know that most of the time we, I would never
[02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:59.930]  be able to talk about this with you.
[02:41:59.930 --> 02:42:04.810]  I would never even want to, I just kind of wanted to give a few things out so that people
[02:42:04.810 --> 02:42:06.490]  would see the real side of life.
[02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:10.810]  Um, it's always, it always seems so rosy.
[02:42:10.810 --> 02:42:13.930]  Like you had mentioned, even when people betray you and that kind of stuff,
[02:42:14.410 --> 02:42:18.890]  co-defendants and stuff, those, those individuals turn super quick.
[02:42:18.890 --> 02:42:23.050]  And like you had mentioned, sometimes it could be almost as silly, like a one year thing,
[02:42:23.050 --> 02:42:26.250]  and they'll change your life just so they are not inconvenient.
[02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:30.090]  I know a cat that went in, this was back in 07.
[02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:33.130]  He went in, I think he had two and a half years, three years.
[02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:34.970]  Um, he's still locked up.
[02:42:35.770 --> 02:42:37.530]  He turned it into 30 something years.
[02:42:38.250 --> 02:42:39.850]  You know, he gets into some shit.
[02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:40.890]  He stabs a dude up.
[02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:43.530]  Another five years, another one, another one.
[02:42:43.530 --> 02:42:46.570]  And it's just never, never ending, you know?
[02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:51.210]  So, you know, it's easy to get wrapped up and just, you just stay there, you know?
[02:42:53.130 --> 02:42:57.770]  And it's, it's, it's a bad, bad deal all the way around, you know?
[02:42:59.770 --> 02:43:01.770]  Hey, just a random question, bro.
[02:43:01.770 --> 02:43:05.930]  Did they, um, were they offering y'all like the vaccine or trying or enforcing y'all
[02:43:05.930 --> 02:43:07.210]  or anything like that in there?
[02:43:07.930 --> 02:43:14.810]  So they, they can't like, you know, legally like force it on you, right?
[02:43:15.690 --> 02:43:17.210]  But they can offer you options.
[02:43:18.090 --> 02:43:23.130]  So it kind of makes it like a no, uh, a no brainer.
[02:43:23.130 --> 02:43:25.450]  Like, it's like, oh yeah, you can have those.
[02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:31.930]  And, you know, you'll, you'll be able to avoid quarantines and, you know, you'll be able to
[02:43:32.730 --> 02:43:34.810]  get your release to a halfway house.
[02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:42.090]  And, um, you know, you can, you can do all these things or you cannot get it.
[02:43:42.090 --> 02:43:44.090]  And yeah, you can just stay in quarantine.
[02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.890]  You can't do this.
[02:43:44.890 --> 02:43:45.530]  You can't do that.
[02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:48.010]  You probably won't get released to a halfway house.
[02:43:48.010 --> 02:43:51.850]  If you do get released at any point, you're gonna have to travel back on Conair again
[02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:53.130]  and go to a County.
[02:43:53.130 --> 02:43:54.090]  So they make it.
[02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:58.410]  So it's like, you know, it's a force your hand.
[02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.690]  Yeah.
[02:43:59.690 --> 02:44:03.850]  And at that point when they were offering it and everything, it was like guinea pig
[02:44:03.850 --> 02:44:04.490]  stages.
[02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:09.690]  So, uh, they just want to make sure that it didn't kill a bunch of people before they
[02:44:09.690 --> 02:44:12.970]  started offering it to the general, uh, general public.
[02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:14.890]  So, um, yeah.
[02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:22.410]  So yeah, you know, and a lot of it, you know, it was just a lot of bullshit, you know, what
[02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:24.170]  they were saying, you wouldn't be able to do.
[02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:25.130]  And it turned out later.
[02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:28.090]  It was like, yeah, that literally had no bearing on it, but you didn't know.
[02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:31.130]  So you were like, what do I do here?
[02:44:31.930 --> 02:44:33.610]  Sounds like the government right now.
[02:44:33.610 --> 02:44:34.490]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:34.490 --> 02:44:35.370]  So yeah.
[02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:39.690]  So you just got to look out for your, you know, your best interest or your, uh, your,
[02:44:39.690 --> 02:44:42.170]  your friends and your family for real.
[02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:46.570]  And, uh, you know, I said, you know, I've brought it, you know, rolling dice, you know,
[02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:48.490]  I need to get back home to my family.
[02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:51.050]  So, um, I'm pretty strong, dude.
[02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:56.330]  I got a hell of an immune system and, uh, you know, I've probably inhaled worse shit
[02:44:56.330 --> 02:45:01.690]  than that on construction sites that are in dump work and everything, you know, we
[02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:03.930]  chose and been around the blue and everything.
[02:45:03.930 --> 02:45:08.170]  So I'm like, that shit had to build up a ton of something like, fuck it.
[02:45:08.170 --> 02:45:08.970]  Jab me with it.
[02:45:08.970 --> 02:45:09.610]  You know what I mean?
[02:45:09.610 --> 02:45:12.330]  We'll just roll the dice and hopefully it doesn't kill me.
[02:45:13.930 --> 02:45:14.330]  Yeah.
[02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:17.130]  Nothing happened to me, but it's a lot of other people get it.
[02:45:17.130 --> 02:45:19.210]  And I got sick as a dog and all fucked up.
[02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:20.590]  Yeah.
[02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:21.930]  Yeah, man.
[02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:24.750]  Yeah.
[02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:32.330]  Well, before we, uh, kind of finalize things here and can maybe get a few questions in,
[02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:36.890]  I had one more question for you to like, when it came to your vault and then your other
[02:45:36.890 --> 02:45:42.090]  genetics, like what made you say these genetics are vault worthy, uh, where these genetics
[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:44.490]  were, you know, you released to the public in the general manner.
[02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:53.130]  Um, vault ones were definitely, um, not one, they were not plenty to, they were made for,
[02:45:53.210 --> 02:45:59.210]  um, they were made more for my purpose and like a project or something like that.
[02:45:59.210 --> 02:46:02.650]  Certain ones went on and were great and other projects.
[02:46:03.370 --> 02:46:09.930]  Um, and some of them, they didn't do great working on an outcrosses and other projects,
[02:46:09.930 --> 02:46:12.410]  but standalone, they were phenomenal.
[02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:17.450]  So they ended up, you know, going, going that route, you know, find good homes.
[02:46:20.010 --> 02:46:20.890]  Yeah, man.
[02:46:20.890 --> 02:46:25.770]  Is one of your requirements, you know, kind of for the vault, like how well that genetics
[02:46:26.650 --> 02:46:29.130]  can combine with others and stay dominant?
[02:46:29.690 --> 02:46:31.610]  Uh, I heard belief talking about that.
[02:46:31.610 --> 02:46:35.930]  He has some, like his creatures, like one, he could breathe with anything and he's getting
[02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:40.330]  those certain traits that he wants kind of no matter what, is that one of your things
[02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:41.130]  you look for, bro?
[02:46:41.930 --> 02:46:43.770]  Um, depending on the project.
[02:46:43.770 --> 02:46:44.010]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.010 --> 02:46:47.450]  Cause some things it's like, I don't want the whole, the whole thing.
[02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:49.850]  I just want certain attributes out of it.
[02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:51.850]  And then you end up using something.
[02:46:51.850 --> 02:46:53.610]  It's so fucking dominant.
[02:46:53.610 --> 02:46:57.210]  You might as well just recreated the one, the one side of the family.
[02:46:57.770 --> 02:47:01.690]  Um, so sometimes it works out depending on what you want to do.
[02:47:01.690 --> 02:47:04.650]  And then sometimes you're like, oh man, it's just, it's just too much.
[02:47:04.650 --> 02:47:10.730]  It's like using a, it's like using Jack hair, um, and something and trying not to have Jack
[02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:11.290]  hair smell.
[02:47:12.490 --> 02:47:16.410]  It's like, it's very, very hard, very hard to do.
[02:47:16.970 --> 02:47:20.810]  So because most of the time you breathe in with Jack carrots, the project is going to
[02:47:20.810 --> 02:47:21.210]  come out.
[02:47:21.210 --> 02:47:24.570]  So smell like Jack hair, um, same with like Durden.
[02:47:24.570 --> 02:47:26.170]  It's the same, same type of girl.
[02:47:27.450 --> 02:47:27.850]  Gotcha.
[02:47:28.650 --> 02:47:28.890]  Yeah.
[02:47:31.690 --> 02:47:32.650]  Favorite Hayes.
[02:47:33.850 --> 02:47:34.730]  I don't know, man.
[02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:38.490]  The NL five days was definitely a G 13.
[02:47:38.490 --> 02:47:39.290]  Hayes was good.
[02:47:39.930 --> 02:47:45.930]  Um, my East coast dude, that tough dude, that uptown from the Bronx up in New York.
[02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:47.610]  That stuff was the fucking shit.
[02:47:48.250 --> 02:47:48.810]  God damn.
[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:49.770]  That stuff was good.
[02:47:50.650 --> 02:47:57.370]  Um, second to that, you know, five areas, I like G 13 Hayes too, but I know five days
[02:47:57.370 --> 02:47:59.370]  was more, I don't know.
[02:47:59.370 --> 02:48:04.570]  Some of that incense smell at Frankincense, back to the type of funk that used to really
[02:48:04.570 --> 02:48:07.130]  do it for me, but I'd uptown poke, man.
[02:48:07.130 --> 02:48:10.570]  That was all right.
[02:48:10.570 --> 02:48:12.650]  Details on granny scum.
[02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:18.010]  Um, I don't know what that means.
[02:48:18.890 --> 02:48:21.930]  Um, let's see.
[02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:23.930]  Yeah, it was really good.
[02:48:23.930 --> 02:48:25.050]  Third, call the Lord.
[02:48:25.050 --> 02:48:26.090]  And he's going to create one.
[02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:26.970]  See that?
[02:48:26.970 --> 02:48:27.450]  Yes.
[02:48:27.450 --> 02:48:27.770]  Yes.
[02:48:27.770 --> 02:48:28.170]  I am.
[02:48:28.170 --> 02:48:29.770]  There's quite a, quite a few.
[02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:35.770]  Um, but anybody that knows anything about me, man, I keep shit under my hat.
[02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:36.570]  And so I'm ready.
[02:48:36.570 --> 02:48:40.810]  Like it's already made, tested and ready before I even start showing a picture of the process.
[02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:47.130]  There's too many between the scammers and people just looking to ride, ride your dick.
[02:48:47.850 --> 02:48:49.210]  Um, you, you got it.
[02:48:49.210 --> 02:48:51.450]  You got to keep showing your hat till it's hammer time.
[02:48:52.090 --> 02:48:55.290]  I lay about the time they even try to claim they're doing this or that.
[02:48:55.290 --> 02:48:59.130]  I'm already like three steps ahead on other projects and it doesn't matter.
[02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:05.050]  So, um, yeah, so you just have to kind of, kind of stay tuned and, uh, yeah, you'll see
[02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:10.570]  favorite top dressing, uh, insect grass, earthworm,
[02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:16.100]  combo, great combo.
[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:17.860]  Yeah.
[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:22.820]  Crease that fun job big time with that and bacteria.
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:25.140]  Hmm.
[02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:28.980]  That's a, that's a tough one.
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:30.420]  There's a few of them.
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:33.780]  There's been a few for my, for my youth.
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:40.740]  Um, man, too many, too many dimension really.
[02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:44.900]  Um, let's say the all time heartbreaker.
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:52.340]  Oh no, man, that, that cuttlefish hash plant was a kind of heartbreaking.
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:00.340]  There have been poison blue tritons.
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:05.060]  Um, Durban was a, was a good one.
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:11.780]  Um, uh, the effect of it was, was the, was the main, the main thing that used to get me,
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:19.140]  I used to like, uh, I mean, used to like, um, always, you know, I liked, uh, good Sativas.
[02:50:19.140 --> 02:50:20.820]  They always got overlooked.
[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:25.860]  Um, anybody's ever had to like do a lot of work and do shit during the day can appreciate
[02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:27.380]  a good, a good Sativa.
[02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:32.580]  Um, cultivars that produce like, you know, colorful resins and shit like that.
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:33.540]  They're always cool.
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:38.820]  Especially like when it's like not water soluble and you got some colorful bubble or colorful
[02:50:38.820 --> 02:50:41.460]  rousing and it's just, it's just kind of cool looking, you know?
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:47.860]  Um, selfing's cool.
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:53.060]  Um, just like any other breeding technique, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.700]  Uh, you know, your results kind of will vary.
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:51:00.740]  Um, sometimes you got an S2 or S3 to really lock something down.
[02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:05.300]  Sometimes when you S1, you know, you'll notice things get all stretchy on you or weird, or
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:09.460]  you end up with stuff that's dead on and doesn't produce resin.
[02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:11.860]  Um, it's just one of those deals, man.
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:17.060]  You, you gotta kinda, you just gotta kinda put yourself out there and try it and see
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:18.180]  where you're at first.
[02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:21.460]  Um, and, and, and go from there.
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:26.980]  Cause just like with, you know, breeding filial or back processing, like it doesn't always
[02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:32.340]  exactly work, you know, exactly the way that you, you think it's going to.
[02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:36.980]  That's why it's good to have like multiple techniques of getting to a, getting to a place.
[02:51:36.980 --> 02:51:41.620]  So selfing's just one of many, many, many options you can use.
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:44.500]  And it might, it might could work really awesome.
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:46.340]  It might be mediocre.
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:49.140]  It is totally just blue bar, man.
[02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:53.060]  So it's just one thing, just give it a shot and see what you, see what you get.
[02:51:58.220 --> 02:51:59.500]  Yes, yes I do.
[02:52:00.460 --> 02:52:01.260]  Yes I do.
[02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:03.820]  Yeah, the rumors are true.
[02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:04.380]  Definitely.
[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:05.500]  I definitely do that.
[02:52:06.300 --> 02:52:06.780]  Guilty.
[02:52:07.660 --> 02:52:08.220]  Yeah.
[02:52:08.220 --> 02:52:11.100]  Works great for terpene terpene production.
[02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:11.580]  Oh yeah.
[02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:12.720]  Yeah.
[02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:19.100]  That's nutrient center too, you know, black chain, nutrient film tray.
[02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:21.660]  Oh, NFTs.
[02:52:21.660 --> 02:52:27.660]  I thought I said nutrient film trays, uh, beating program, uh, go to breeding program
[02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:30.540]  effort and building a great portfolio.
[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:33.980]  I'm just going to pop in and say that technology is way ahead of me.
[02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:38.380]  Anyways, I didn't know if you'd be familiar with it, but I put it up anyways.
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:41.980]  And I love that you pulled the NFT, the nutrient film tray out of it.
[02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:43.660]  That's a, that's a grower right there.
[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:44.460]  That's a grower.
[02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:52.300]  NFT the one thing no one can explain, you know, that's what I seem to find out of it.
[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:53.820]  Yeah.
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:56.060]  How's positive track work on employment?
[02:52:56.060 --> 02:52:56.780]  It just do.
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:05.580]  Um, so, um, as far as like people working together, um, it can happen.
[02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:11.340]  Um, it's a weird, it's a weird thing.
[02:53:11.340 --> 02:53:15.260]  It's like, you know, you're getting too many cooks in the, in the kitchen and it'll lead
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:19.980]  to problems sometimes, sometimes it can work out, you know, it's just getting the right
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:23.980]  people with the right goal to, uh, to do something like that.
[02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:27.020]  Um, a lot of old heads, man, a real paranoid.
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:28.700]  They don't, they don't trust other people.
[02:53:28.700 --> 02:53:32.860]  They don't trust people around the shit with as much fuckery that's been going on.
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:35.340]  As far as I can remember, and it gets worse.
[02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:40.460]  Um, you know, um, it doesn't, it doesn't surprise me.
[02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:45.420]  Um, but sometimes you get like a group of friends that do trust each other that are
[02:53:45.420 --> 02:53:48.780]  working toward a goal that can make some, some cool shit happen.
[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:54.940]  So, um, that's just, that's just one of them things like me, me personally.
[02:53:54.940 --> 02:54:00.380]  Um, you know, I, I'm, I'm pretty, I'm a pretty funny guy, man.
[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:01.820]  I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna lie.
[02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:03.820]  So like somebody just hits me up out of the blue.
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:03.980]  Yeah.
[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:04.700]  You want to do this?
[02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:05.420]  You want to do that?
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:07.580]  Just old school mentality.
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:09.500]  Sometimes I'm like, Oh, it's sketchy.
[02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:12.460]  And then I have to remember, it's like, well, it's legal and people are cool.
[02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:13.260]  They just want to help.
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:18.620]  But then I'm, you know, I just seen so much fucked up shit and people trying to fuck me
[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:18.940]  over.
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:21.980]  And so I'm like, all right, what's their motive behind that?
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:22.460]  You know?
[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:24.460]  So, and it's not just me.
[02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:28.940]  It's like a lot of, a lot of people, um, from the old school are like that.
[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:33.740]  Um, so it's a, it's a really tricky thing, man.
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:37.340]  I got to know somebody for a real, real long time.
[02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:42.220]  And there's gotta be a lot of trust established before, you know, I'm, I'm gonna, you know,
[02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:43.980]  do anything with somebody anyhow.
[02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:49.660]  Um, it's one thing to, you know, do a little collaboration, you know, you send pollen or
[02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:50.780]  you make it whatever.
[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:57.020]  But, um, to really get in there, um, sharing genetics and, and, and doing a whole program.
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:03.340]  It's, you know, it, it, it would be a, it'd be a rare, a rare thing, especially nowadays,
[02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:04.940]  you know, it'd be cool though.
[02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:06.540]  You could get a whole lot done.
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:07.580]  Just takes the right people.
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:11.200]  Oh yeah.
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:11.760]  Well said.
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:14.240]  It's hard to find a good solid group, man, anymore.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.880]  I mean, you get you one right hand, man, you, you're lucky, you know what I mean?
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:20.080]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:20.960]  Those in times.
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:22.720]  Absolutely, man.
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:23.360]  Absolutely.
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:27.680]  Well, I appreciate your time Duke.
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:30.800]  I know if there's any other questions out there, get them in quick.
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:33.200]  We do like to respect the viewer's time.
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:34.640]  We try to keep it at three hours.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:37.200]  But today is a special one for me.
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:41.760]  I feel like the community obviously knows why, but I believe in time, the community
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:44.160]  will also start to see why this is a special one.
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:50.640]  Kind of hearing it from the people that have gone through it the most on both sides of
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:51.280]  the spectrum.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.040]  And then I guess the takeaway is that you still see it's with humble and grace, how
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:02.480]  he's able to carry himself and continue on even though bullshit kicks him in the face,
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:02.800]  man.
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:05.440]  I admire the way you take it on chin, bro.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:06.160]  Keep it moving.
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:07.840]  That's right, dude.
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:09.040]  Yeah.
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:12.320]  Like I said, you gotta, you gotta be a rock man.
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:19.120]  Just stay positive, whatever it is you're doing, you're doing time, make the best out
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:19.680]  every day.
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:21.440]  You only get one chance at every day.
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.520]  So yeah, but who's you to make the best of it?
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520]  Just try to make something good out of it.
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.200]  Take something positive away from it.
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:33.680]  Learn something from it and just keep moving forward.
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:37.200]  And don't let it ruin you.
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.760]  Don't let it dim your shine.
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:44.800]  You just gotta overcome, and that's it.
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.200]  Let it break you or you can let it make you stronger.
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:52.240]  So that's the thing, man.
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:56.880]  It's like they're grinding away at me, but it's all they're doing is making me sharper.
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:58.720]  So whatever.
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:01.360]  If you don't quit, you can't lose, bro.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:02.960]  That's it, man.
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:03.440]  That's it.
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:04.880]  I'm too hard headed for that shit.
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:05.920]  Exactly.
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:07.360]  Yeah.
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:08.000]  Yeah.
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:09.280]  Oh, man.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:10.800]  I appreciate this, guys.
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:12.160]  It's been a great episode.
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:17.840]  You know, it's real refreshing just to hear, you know, a straight shooter.
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:20.160]  So I appreciate that, Duke.
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:20.880]  That's awesome.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:25.120]  And people have picked up a lot of great stuff from the conversations.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:27.840]  One little bit of housekeeping tonight.
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:35.840]  We'll be back FCP02 at 7pm on the West Coast, 10pm on the East Coast, and we'll cover everything
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:36.960]  else from that.
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:39.520]  But I want to give these guys a chance to wrap that up, too.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:41.520]  So excellent, guys.
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:41.920]  Yeah.
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:45.840]  I'll just go ahead and let Brian get the last word.
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:47.920]  I just want to just throw my two cents in.
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:49.120]  Nice meeting you, Duke, man.
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:53.360]  I appreciate what you're doing for the community, brother.
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:58.400]  And definitely looking forward to building something with you, man, for the future.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:01.680]  I like to connect with good people and keep those connections going.
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:03.200]  Yeah, man.
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.360]  Maybe we can go down to Hopewell to the anchor room.
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:07.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:09.840]  A couple beers and some devil dogs or something, you know?
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:10.400]  There you go.
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.960]  Well, you know, this was kind of a surprise, Duke.
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:21.040]  I appreciate you last minute, you know, again, just coming through for the community.
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:25.360]  And I would love to extend it that, you know, we'd love to have you on again where maybe
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:29.280]  we could talk specifics like you had mentioned for people that want to really get into this,
[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:34.400]  maybe like a step-by-step where we've kind of planned it out a little bit instead of a last
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:35.440]  minute kind of Hail Mary.
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:37.040]  But you caught it today, bro.
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.720]  And I feel like you killed it, man.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:45.520]  From a candid interview, I feel like there's nothing better than when people are just sitting
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:47.600]  there telling you the truth like Chad talked about.
[02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:48.960]  And, hey, man, this is how it is.
[02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:52.160]  I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you because it sucks.
[02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:53.440]  But this is how the shit works.
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:58.320]  And then taking it on the flip side and just explaining to things why people need to focus
[02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:00.720]  on the grocery stores instead of the hydro stores.
[02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:04.400]  And you've been saying that since I had the pleasure of meeting you, buddy.
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:07.120]  So, again, just a real salute to you, man.
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:13.280]  I feel like you're one of the ones that definitely deserve a politician-esque where people can
[02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:16.320]  vote and say, like, this is how I feel like breeding should be.
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:18.400]  This is how I feel like growers should be.
[02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:21.920]  And this is definitely how human beings should be in the way that they conduct and carry
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:22.400]  themselves.
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:23.520]  So thank you, sir.
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:25.360]  Thank you, man.
[02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:26.640]  Thanks for having me.
[02:59:26.640 --> 02:59:27.600]  It's always a pleasure.
[02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:31.200]  And it looks at any time to give me a holler.
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.520]  I'm always good at impromptu stuff.
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:38.160]  Any interview should I've ever done or speech of I don't rehearse it or nothing.
[02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:40.000]  I just prefer to do it this way.
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:40.960]  Anyhow, you know.
[02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:42.720]  So, yeah, man, any time.
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:43.840]  Hey, what's up?
[02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:45.360]  And how you doing?
[02:59:45.360 --> 02:59:45.860]  Good.
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.360]  You are mute there, brother.
[02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:57.280]  I do that once every episode and I had to wait till I'm like, OK, and with that, I'm
[02:59:57.280 --> 02:59:58.720]  going to wrap it up, guys.
[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:01.200]  So everybody out there, enjoy.
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:04.720]  Watch this one again and we'll catch you next week.
