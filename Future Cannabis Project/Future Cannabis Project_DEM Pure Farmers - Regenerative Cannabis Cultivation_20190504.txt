Things like this are just really special, like all of these incredible people in
the same place right now with this mindset of like how do we do what's
right for the earth and thinking about our children, thinking ahead of time and
thinking about the soil and sequestering carbon and producing healthy food and
thank you guys for coming out and thank you Joshua for putting this on. It's an
amazing event. This is real community.
Thanks for those kind words. Yeah, I'm Craig from Alpenglow and I was asked to
put this panel together and what I did is I looked at these farms. I know some
of them very well and I know some of them not as, but you know that's how we
build our relationships and I'm gonna kind of you know we're gonna start
sitting but now I feel like we're like doing Monday night football or something.
We're coming out like we're building the team, but it's kind of what we are doing you know.
If you look at a little more organically we're building a web and the stronger it
is with more people in it and holding it all tight. Could you do me a favor? Could
you introduce your family? Give us your dad's name and your mom's name and
your little sister's name or brother's name.
Jacob and Carla and Rose and my name is India. India, can I ask you your farm name?
Do you know your farm name? Flower Days Farm. And where is your farm? What do
you know what county or what what town it's in? Highland Palm. And I'm gonna ask you one last
question. I would like you to name all the animals you have on your farm from
the biggest to the smallest. They could just be if you have a chicken or a cow.
We don't need their names. Okay you probably have them all named don't you?
Nice. Let's just let us know what types of animals you have. A cow and a goat and
some chickens, a dog and a cat. Nice. Thank you for sharing. So I want to get
so both of you can you can stay there. I'll come between you guys. So Flower
Days 2017, am I right? 2017 they won the regenerative award at the Emerald Cup.
And you know that they've been constantly inspiring us as a community
with their posts and their methods and and finally this year they put out a
book and I want to hand you the mic and you guys each talk about the inputs of
your book and why you came up with it and where maybe the next one to come
forum or would there be more and so forth? Well the book came to be because
the goal on our farm was really to answer the question of what is a
sustainable farm and can a farm be a closed-loop you know sustainable
organism and setting out to answer that question we we did answer that question
and the answer is yes and so we compiled all of the recipes from our homemade or
home homegrown on the farm ingredients how we generate our fertility to grow
cannabis specifically and so we wanted to share that with everybody because
we've had a lot of success with the quality that we've been producing and
and we're producing extremely clean you know effective medicine so it's it's
great to see so much interest in regenerative agriculture and I think
there's a lot of interest in like how how do I do this on the farm and so we
decided to put put this recipe to book together and share with you all so
thanks part of how this book came about was actually because of the movement of
what is happening that is so much bigger than any of us but that's really
something special and I think the time we're living in and being involved in
what we do in the time we're living in is just you know we're constantly facing
challenges every day but it's it's brought us together in so many ways as a
community from local all the way to global and it's really amazing to see
what a grassroots movement based on people building resilience towards
basically everything that's it's like this David and Goliath battle right and
all of our natural resources are at stake there are so many things reversing
global warming climate change putting a stop to it putting a future back in our
children's hands I mean there's so much more to it than than just cannabis and
we all know what this this plant teaches us some really powerful lessons and one
of the biggest ones is just how we are about really one with nature we are part
of it and how to actually live as a part of that system that was the
question we sought out to answer and and we're still asking it daily but we've
come to this point where here we were all having this amazing discussion
together and we live in the middle of nowhere in Trinity County and we feel
like a really part of a really amazing community and we're not alone out there
and it was really nice to reach out to each other and to all thank you Craig
you're one of the people that really has helped make the mycelium network
connections happen and that's what's happening so here we are but really it's
about you know just all of us not being afraid to just take that first step to
start wherever that is and with every step everything exponentially evolves
from there and so it just keeps getting better and you just keep seeing more and
more rewards of why it is proven time and time and time and time and time and
time and time again that this really works so I'm excited to hear everyone
share a little bit about that and we're just grateful that we were able to find
a way thanks to compliant farms actually for calling us up and saying we want to
order a whole bunch of books and we're gonna send you them put a check in the
mail today and that's how we were able to actually publish the book and so I
just want to give a shout out to those guys for helping make that happen and
they have the book for sale tonight is it they sold them all of course how can
they get more it's gonna be on our website flower days farm calm this
probably very soon and it's also going to be available as an e-book at all of
the major e-book publishers to thank you guys I just want to jump into the
stories because I think as the stories unroll or roll out you're gonna get a
feel for what it is about being damp here and some of the criteria needed to
become damp here there's you know six closed loops you need to identify in
your farm oh you have to identify six closed loops on your farm you need to
identify rain catchment or your source of water you need to have a pollinator
garden education back to the community grow fruit food crops alongside of your
cannabis and yeah and and and I will stop there just because you're gonna see
something else that comes from all this and let's go right into it because I
want to make sure we have enough time to get through everyone so we'll hand it
off to Patricia is this thing on yeah sounds like it all right hey guys hey
ladies in the house thank you for being here and I hope to see more and more of
us my name is Patricia Vargas I am co-founder and co-owner of Sun Roots
Farm as well as co-founder of the village hearth cooperative in Kovalo I'll
talk a little bit more about that one moment hi everybody my name is Forrest
Gowder I'm co-owner of Sun Roots Farm with my partner Patricia I've been
cultivating on our property for about eight years now and being regenerative
has always been a and being sustainable has always been a big part of my
growing up growing up on a off-grid you know apple orchard you know so in Kovalo
so sustainability was always at the top like so it's big resonate always been
very resonating with me and so growing plants and cannabis it's amazing and it
just seems to getting better and better and here we are now to share with all
you our experience so do we have any pictures tonight
let's put the video on well the reason for this that I want to show you guys
is because you guys it's probably seen I've been here since 9 a.m. yesterday and
like if anyone feels the same way I do my brain is just like over loaded with
so much information but what you guys have been seeing a lot of is photos of
these indoor grows and I want to just I want there to be an example of what
regenerative farms are for us and I also first want to call out Kelly and Josh
and Willow and Skye who are the Dempere founders of dragonfly earth medicine
they are amazing I'm sure you've all heard of them this is our farm in the
background this is me talking about pulling up water from the soil so oh
that's what I'm telling for us we're talking about tilling and that back
right before right when I moved down to the farm which about five years ago
forest had been tilling and but this guy I mean I I literally saw this guy's
cannabis for the first time and I was like this guy knows what he's doing
because I've been smoking for a long time and I mean his his ganja was really
beautiful and it's always been growing in this method of really huge plants
because of the genetics we've been breed you guys have been breeding for a long
time his family has strains that date back to the 70s in the same terroir same
appellation so of course you know getting into that little part
regenerative agriculture really is about using what's local and working with
what you have and I guess what I really wanted to talk about today was integrity
in in cannabis and in farming these days because we're at a point in our lives
where work there's corporate cannabis here right it's right around the corner
it's already come it's moving into our own backyards and it's so scary because
to grow on a smaller scale we do 10,000 square feet for us that's huge and it's
all outdoor everything's in the ground and it's all from seed if we make clones
it's from our own genetics and we make the clones right in soil we've been
trying to educate a little bit more about that since people are going a lot
towards that route but the integrity of when you're working on this farm and
things come up such as you have a new pest that you've never seen before
instead of making the decision to go and buy some chemical or buy something from
the store that is going to be a quick and easy fix the integral part of that
which is what your commitment is as a dragonfly or earth medicine certified
farm is to to check everything that you're doing because every single
decision that we make from seed to soil and everything that I'm doing right now
everything that we do every single day is a decision and we have to commit
ourselves to really knowing what are the impacts of that decision everything that
we do this is like our daily lives can be walked in a sacred way and we can
continue on the path of this regenerative beautiful uplifting place I
mean look at how happy he is like smiling he's like my fans are so big
it's just when you create beauty around you and when you walk that way when
every single decision in your life and we're not all perfect I mean my god
we're human like we're all gonna do things that maybe we shouldn't do but
just integrity of every single day and I'm making an effort to do my best and
to actually give back to the earth because we're all taking from it so it's
time that we start giving back a lot of our methods are basically building
compost all the time we're just constantly adding and it's adding from
our own local resources so we're not going out and trying to seek too much
outside of ourselves and outside of our own farms we know that the knowledge is
there to deal with obstacles that come up we understand that everything that we
need is on the farm already all the local medicinal plants everything that's
growing in abundance can help to be a part of your farm you can make beautiful
compost cheese with the things that are growing right right by your feet nothing
is ever a weed it's all medicinal it's all beautiful if there's a lot of weeds
growing in your garden you're concerned about it those weeds are there for a
reason they're growing because they want to protect the soil underneath from
eroding or whatever purpose they serve everything has its purpose and when we
are working with cannabis this amazing medicine that we all love I'm just here
to as a little reminder that's saying integrity matters and our decisions
ripple out so be what you want to see in the world we have the potential to
really change the wave of agriculture that is set in standard today especially
in California and our Pacific Coast in the United States we haven't we have the
opportunity to really create a higher bar higher standard and doing
regenerative agriculture is a way to set that bar for a new wave of agriculture
that's actually not depleting our soils and that's actually giving back so that
we can work with the conditions that we have like wildfires and drought things
that that are real for us right now if we don't play a part in that in our
daily decisions and everything that we do from seed to what you buy yeah I mean
let's pay attention to that. That's all I have to say. Thank you.
Thank you. I want to add two comments to what you were talking about one was
you're saying you make clones or cuttings what do you use to root those?
So when we make cuttings we have this soil blocker and we just use put put soil
in there and block it up and we make our own rooting hormone out of willow tea
and then aloe so we make the tea what once we put the we dip our starts or our
cuttings in the aloe first and then we pour the willow tea over it and as
they're rooting we can add more willow tea just as like when we're watering our
plants so that you can just just like making regular tea so just cut it up in
little pieces and put it in a pot and bring it to a boil don't let it boil too
much or you could just do it without boiling and it'll take a lot longer but
simmer it don't don't overcook it. And I think I've seen you guys having some set
up in jars so are you making it making maybe like a gallon or two of it and
then putting it in pint jars or something so when you're ready to work
you don't have to do all this prep you can prep on rainy days and then use it a
week or two later right? Yeah I mean you can use it whenever you want but it's really easy to
work we to use we have a big willow tree right outside our house so we have it
readily available all the time so we can by the time the the clones are ready to
go out and be transplanted they're actually like bigger than when you cut
them and they're healthier and more vibrant and they're already in their
native soil that they're gonna be using anyway so which is awesome. Fantastic
thank you guys. I'll just give you a quick description of our farm kind of
what we do what what makes us special in this we're also recipients of the
regenerative farm award from 2017 a couple years ago but I think what I can
add to this discussion because because there's a lot of us farmers up here and
we all have great practices is is kind of my passion for for growing food for
people alongside medicine alongside our urban and so we're a production vegetable
farm we grow food not only for ourselves and for our kitchen but we grow
food for market and for our community and and the importance of that has
become a big part of kind of I feel like my role in the world what what makes me
feel complete as a person and what makes me the only thing that that's made sense
in the world to sort of say so I kind of started down this path as a homesteader
getting back to the land getting away from the dysfunction of society and
seeing if I could close all these loops seeing if I could have a sustainable
farm and and grow what I needed there and create my own power and be
responsible for the things for my own life build build my own house those
kinds of things and it's a really satisfying path and I love it and I
loved growing cannabis to support that path and creating this great product for
people but I also started feeling that this responsibility to I can create this
bubble I can create this bubble of sustainability in the eddy of this river
of culture and but but this river is still here there's still everybody
there's still everybody in town there's still all all the elders who aren't
going to get out in the garden there's still the people with with a little
postage stamp of a yard and and the people without without the desire to do
the manual labor to grow food and those people need to be in that loop of
sustainability and and if those people don't have the option for good food
grown in a good way they're gonna get the next best option and and that's not
gonna be as good for the planet as as what I feel like I was learning to do
the skills I was learning for myself being able to bring those out and share
those and create an option for our community where they can buy food that's
grown with no till that's grown with a lot of closed-loop techniques and
therefore is also incredibly nutritious and delicious and all of that so so for
me that was like the next step for me in this whole process is kind of the Dharma
that my responsibility not only to my my own geeking out on all this stuff but my
responsibility to my world to my to my legacy in the future and in the past in
in this piece is like if we're gaining skills as farmers I think it is an
amazing gift to give cannabis to the world I think it's an amazing gift to
grow this great medicine and but I've never been a big fan of monocropping
I've been never been a big fan of like you know you can have a diverse cannabis
farm and you look at above and it if it's still 90% of your canopy is
cannabis it's a monocrop farm and and I just want all of this skill and all of
this thought that we're all putting into this to share on this broader scale
because there's lots of people that don't even smoke cannabis but man they
they eat food and that's medicine in the same way and so what we've been working
on a lot on our farm is how these things integrate how production food
farming systems which is you know with production food farming if you're gonna
make it work and and not lose money but actually say break even or or maybe even
make a little bit of money for your time doing it it's it's a different kind of
model than doing garden and it's about efficiency and planning and and kind of
the combination of efficiency and planning and and doing things according
to your morals and worldview as well but what we've been really looking into
is is how the cannabis works with those kinds of systems how to integrate it so
you can get cannabis and food crops out of the same area so that the food crops
in the systems you use for the food crops can support the cannabis and how
the lessons that that market gardeners and and food farmers have been learning
for years which is you don't make much money off the head of lettuce so if you
want to do it right you have to be efficient you have to be thoughtful and
you have to do these closed-loop things because you're not going to the store to
buy a $50 a gallon jug of nutrients to grow arugula it's not it's not what you
do so these lessons that the small-scale market gardeners have been working on
for for some decades now since the organic movement are really applicable
to us in the in the cannabis community and vice versa so that's been the focus
of our farm is working with that and I invite you to check us out on Instagram
see what we do and yeah let's let's go over to Kelly now and Kelly let's uh
let's have you let's have you talk about how last year's regenerative
conference in Redway affected you guys in and what you did with some knowledge
again and some of the inspiration okay my name is Kelly I'm with hard rock
mountain farm we're out in Potter Valley last year we came here and we regenerate
kind of cannabis is kind of like a rabbit hole and we were like looking
down it for a long time and then after we came and we were exposed to all these
wonderful ideas and seeing all these wonderful people who I'm gonna get to
sit next to now which is like really inspiring we took a lot of initiative
after and the things that we learned like we went and put in 220 feet of
Google culture we got all of our water on solar we started making teas we did
we're moving towards no till still and that's another thing it's like we
learned that it's okay that it's a process and that we get to all move
towards that and work towards that like together and just coming to all these
things and learning about everything and connecting with people has been really
helpful to us we also learned that regenerative like is like a lifestyle
and it can be like the things that you eat and put into your body or even like
we were we made it out of the fires this year by the skin of our teeth and so now
we're gonna work on improving the health of the forest around us so it's not a
tinderbox we're still dialing everything in and we're diving and it's
like we're still falling down that rabbit hole and still seeing so much
more that we can improve on and it's a never-ending journey that we're really
happy to be on so what you're in Potter Valley that right what are you having
influence on your neighbors or other folks in your road or community members
yeah absolutely so we're going through and we're talking to all the other
growers we know whether or not they're legal or not and we're getting them to
dump their smart pots we're introducing companion planting to them we're
convincing them to grow more food for themselves just like all the small
things to improve yeah just like our world around us because it's a
reflection of ourselves yeah one thing he's right there really resonated with
me and that was whether they were in the regulated market or not and and that's a
choice that your neighbors are making or not making and that's one you know that
choice doesn't bother me either way but can we still help them even if they're
in the unregulated market to still become regenerative well that helps the
overall plan that we have and to better the earth and to help our environment
heal so we don't we don't want to be judgmental on a neighbor if they're
choosing to go a different route but let's just help them and show them that
there's a better way that they can actually run their farm whether it's
whatever market they choose to be in so thank you Kelly yeah next we'll run with
Cyril from water dog farm so Carla mentioned something earlier and I just
kind of want to piggyback it and and it's like to me permaculture is kind of
what like really brought this for me and and I saw a quote today a friend posted
and it was permaculture is a revolution disguised as a garden party so if you
can look at everything we're doing as a revolution against the standard model
and the way big AG is and like the influence regenerative is having on AG
is pretty incredible so one of the things I think would be cool for you
guys to walk away with is like some things to go home with and one of the
things that we've realized on our farm is like diversity is really the key and
so I would suggest seeking out all the plants you can find that have pink
flowers yellow flowers white flowers red flowers purple flowers blue flowers
small flowers big flowers and plant them in your ecosystem and and to me
like that's gonna bring in like after hearing the bug lady talking like that's
gonna bring in that ecosystem to keep all those bugs happy and you know one of
the things I like to talk about is just context and like all of us have a
slightly different context that we're gonna come to this table with and so if
you can find what your context is and see how these tools in the tool belt can
work for you on your farm because for some people who go culture just isn't
gonna work so don't even think about it or maybe that's all you should think
about and so really finding what's the tools that you're gonna use and take
advantage of so you know on our farm we have animals we have horses sheeps
chickens not really like composting my dog crap but I have a pile of it okay
cool kashi it's Pukashi Pukashi okay cool and that's another thing is like
I'm constantly learning I came here and I learned a little bit about the Korean
natural farming today and just constantly trying to learn more but so
we incorporate a lot of compost and you know the horse manure gets fed to the
chickens and the chickens then it goes to the worms and this is like part of
the closing loop systems that that we're talking about and you know one of the
things that we realized is with companion planting I do a lot of
experimenting for fun and I'm obsessed with it and so we've gotten the there's
a difference between companion planting and competition planting and so it's
really important to if you are gonna start companion planting to make sure
you're not competing with your cash crop and like for most of us the cannabis is
our cash crop so if you're experimenting on a large scale just make sure that if
it fails you're not out of business because like we need all of us to be
growing the cannabis it's gonna change these people's minds so when they smoke
our weed they're gonna start thinking oh man this is amazing and you know big ags
really looking at this and and so it's like the ripple effects are gonna be big
so one of the things that we've realized in this is kind of a cool thing you guys
can take home in in practice is companion planting with high terpene
plants and if you understand like almost all plants have terpenes and so if
you're growing high terpene rich plants your lemon balms your lavenders your
rosemary's you know yarrow is a great companion plant to have and and in the
the flower days book they've got a lot of recipes that that are very easy so I
definitely suggest everyone to buy that book just to have some some things to do
but we've noticed that so terpenes they communicate in the air whereas the roots
that you know everything that's happening in the roots is communicating
in the soil so if you have high terpene plants in your ecosystem they're gonna
be communicating with your cannabis and you're gonna actually get higher
profiles so we we do planting with high terpene plants near our cannabis and
then we're also feeding those plants to the cannabis and we're seeing really
amazing results with fermenting specific crops you can do lemon balm you know we
did a side-by-side experiment with lavender to two clones in the lavender
the plant that got the lavender ferment had a little off the charts compared to
the plant that didn't so you know we did that this year and I made a mistake
and when I was curing my weed because I wanted to do the experiment the plants
are communicating in the soil they're communicating through the terpenes but
then I also want to do it one step further and cure the weed with these
high terpene plants but I didn't do a side to side by side so it didn't really
work because it wasn't very scientific but so I'm just really big fan of
companion planting and making sure you're not competing and there's just
there's a lot of closed loops that we can all do that just makes us not spend
as much money growing our weed because the margins just aren't there and a lot
of these closed loops really help lessen what we have to pay so it I'll be I'll
be quick because I'm sure you guys have a lot of questions and we can get through
the panel and start answering like specific things that you guys can all
start doing and and really like don't be overwhelmed because just start doing
one thing and two things and start closing as many loops as you can and you
probably already are without even knowing it and if you live in the woods
you have an ecosystem that's right for the harvesting if you do it right and so
it's all about context you know don't be overwhelmed because what he's doing is
different than what I'm doing and we're all slightly different and you know I'm
a one-man army and someone else might have five employees so we're gonna be
attacking different things differently so that's kind of all I want to say and
I'd love to answer questions when people have them I grew up in southern Humboldt
and I'm gonna go back a little bit before the guild like imagine we all
move to a community with no money and we all didn't have to work very hard we
just met up the river every day and swam and like money wasn't money wasn't
a problem we had we had money you could sell at one pound for $5,000 you could
grow you know it was an amazing childhood in southern Humboldt and then
it turned dark with Reagan and all that but those those few years kind of
defined a lot of our lives like it's hard to go back to that and when
regenerative farming and permaculture started really gaining knowledge and
becoming an advanced study it's I latched on to that because of the
patterns were similar in like pursuing money and economics isn't really the
goal because we're just trying to get back to not worrying about money and
it's the pattern right like in regenerative economics in regenerative
farming you're trying to build mycelium you're trying to build networks you're
trying to build connections and so only through diversity and connections do we
actually get to quality and it's the same with economics like if you channel
all the money into an investment bank or if you channel all your investment
out of a community then you're left with a dwindled industry that doesn't really
have life so Kerry Reynolds and I realized that this community like has
been getting getting the life sucked out of a lot of the farming and it's like
innovation is born out of necessity so the the fact that this small-scale like
the county came and you know set up 10,000 square feet in Mendo and and
limited acreages here in Humboldt and we're like really reduced down to small
scale but at the same time now we're learning that being small-scale doesn't
limit our production or innovation like we can John Jeavons is renowned worldwide
for growing amazing amounts of food in the small acreage and he's from here in
Willits right like the innovation that we can create in doing this regenerative
agriculture in these confined spaces is amazing Daniel can feed 40 families
from his one farm. How many people can you get stoned from that one farm?
And when the county looked at us and said no cannabis shouldn't be grown in the
forest or in the hills like we're building soil in forest landscapes so
now we're we're becoming an agroforestry region I think we invented a farm system
like because we had people we have people from all over the world living on
our farms where is that possible we have we have we donate our own money to our
nonprofits we we're the first homestead homesteaders were salvaging old growth
like deciduous mulch to grow their cannabis plants born out of necessity
because they didn't have money but now we realize that that's the same methods
that grow the best cannabis that IMOs of old growth and I'm not saying go out and
scrape old growth forest but that's you know that's kind of what define Humboldt
County pot is that like those that first wave of innovation and now we're in the
same thing like we're getting attacked by investment huge investment banks and
the legalization process has been a nightmare it's not it's you know some of
the rules make sense but they also come at it in a political manner so we're not
really gaining I don't know it's been difficult but this movement is creating
a rapid innovation that I think has the possibility to really change the world
like you're saying so we started the guild to really bring this knowledge to
our community so if you guys want to present to our community and be a part
of building that network in this region we were starting the so hum gilled and I
know there's other read communities up and down the north coast that are like
really networking and getting that knowledge to raise the small farm level
up so they one of the thing that's missing in a lot of businesses is that
kind of equity share with your employees your partners that you're
working with and and there's a lot of standard model CEO at the top making all
the money guy down there is making nothing and he's not really invested in
the company and so you know this is also a good opportunity for young farms to
actually start changing that and giving your employees a like a different share
I mean they can still get a paycheck but then they're also an equity owner and
you know it actually took me a really long time to kind of like come around to
that because I was always like well if I'm the guy with the money and I got the
land and I'm doing all the work and I have one employee why would I give him
equity and I realized actually that's really nice for them and it literally
took me years to get to that but I think that's one thing that is missing in the
this model is the equity shares and that's something that you know each
person can kind of accept you know I was just gonna add to that yeah like
there's standards that were part of this black market industry that we should
carry over that we should not lose some of the beautiful parts of the black
market free people's market yeah the old dirt road you know it was people to
people networking you knew a guy that lived in the city that could bring it to
your friend who you know you follow the chain and everybody made a little bit of
money like that was sweet I could still do that it doesn't all have to go
through some major business it could go through a network of value-based
businesses you know what are your values do they have integrity with my values
let's form a mycelium network Rio's mentioned innovation and where that
comes from then you're saying like that necessity is part of that and we are in
a point where it is very necessary for us to make this paradigm shift into
regenerative agriculture that's what's gonna the only thing though really that
can possibly work against global warming against too much co2 in the air
too much greenhouse gases it's putting it back in the soil it's these processes
of putting it back in the soil so like everyone here that's making soil like
yeah big round of applause for making soil for putting back carbon in the
earth so we can grow food so we can grow medicine and be a part of healing this
planet part of innovation though is it comes from this these this network that's
coming together and everyone's different viewpoints and a serial was talking
about like I mean going to your fire was I learned so much and everyone's farm
like Daniels was insane like just so much because they're there paying
attention to their land intently day after day studying the little bugs that
are going around taking some amazing photos to like cereal is an incredible
photographer and he's pulling up one of these that's really pretty he knows he
understands light you can tell that he's paying attention to things and yeah
well observations a big deal that's getting a lot done this is Daniel and
Taylor's but this is a price for his farms and it's just such a beautiful
farm so much food produced and just incredibly beautiful family making
incredible food and medicine and it's just been such a privilege to be able to
go to these farms and learn the different techniques that they have
figured out over these years Daniel has very like amazing and thoughtful
tilling processes that actually are like Harvard like end up leading to really
amazing microbial life in fact your micro rise will test like from last year
was showing that it had a higher count than the store bought my products and
but through really thoughtful cover crop and polyculture and tilling and Casey as
as also adapt some of these here alright but so just like learning new
innovations from each farm back in the I mean the turn of the century farm
sharing was was normal it was it wasn't until the world wars in the Harvard
Bosch process and and chemical fertilizer being able to be made from
taking that nitrogen from the air and you know the only thing that can do that
normally is the bacteria in the soil the rhizobium and like legumes but in
lightning can do that as well but we invent this process got invented that
basically pressurizes it so much and you're able to take that end to that has
a really powerful triple bond the hardest thing to like break apart and
turn it into plant usable nitrogen when that happened and all the sudden like
they started putting that out everywhere now it's something that you own you own
fertility there was only so much nitrogen so there's only so much people
that could be supported by that and it was about 1 billion so when this got
invented then we could rise to 7.5 or whatever billion we are now which is
really rough on the earth and it's a total out of process nitrogen cycle it's
way too much of it and we're beyond carrying capacity and so that idea that
like fertility could be owned and you could sell these processes of
industrialized agriculture that you just spray and you feed you kill and you make
a model crop and you just get rid of all the diversity it was something that
could be owned and sold and you know makes dollars and cents and it's very
linear and and it's straight to waste innovation stopped then because it was
basically that was tried it wasn't good for the companies and so this rebirth
right now where we share as much information as possible is really
important the innovations that were happening in the 40s on farms were
amazing and then it just stopped and then it's just the same crap but like us
cannabis growers we we are very inventive I mean we went through a
prohibition of 80 years and like I think we were winning I don't know if this is
great right now but like we were doing pretty good because it's a yeah okay
great but it's a lot of amazing and eventful thoughtful creative people that
were working in this environment and we we have this incredible potential right
now taking that energy that we all have that love that we have with cannabis and
the way that it connects us with nature and then now the way that it connects us
with each other like we've always I think everyone here understands that
we've been brought together by cannabis like in so many ways you know sharing a
joint and I mean I love cannabis so much and everything it's done for me and I
wouldn't have met all these people without this connection this wanting to
share this love for the earth so I'm thankful for the plant I'm thankful for
this community and I'm so pleased to be able to do this award and go to some of
the best farms I've ever been to and the idea that the cereals are runner-up
holy shit like that's amazing because your farm is incredible like like like
in any like when I thought of this idea years ago the idea of even going to
finding a farm immediately like you're like would be like cool that's it like
and and now to see all of these farms and all these inventive processes it's
it's it's so cool yeah it's every year it's going up and like last year it was
an amazing event and 135 people or something can fit in the octagon it was
and it's about full and then had to move here because what is it 250 or something
yeah it's yeah I had to as it was moving I had to communicate with someone in
town and I said hey man it's like Woodstock can't fight it we just got to
keep growing it's this regenerative movement that you know Forbes is
claiming it's in the top five there's cannabis and the regenerative
agriculture and we're ground-center right here like yeah so let's keep that
like momentum moving let's connect with each other let's learn from every farm
let's not think that we know everything because every time you connect with
another smart individual they're gonna have another idea about something
another perspective let's take all those perspectives in that's powerful and
let's share the innovation I mean the main tool of it is us sharing as a
community so thank you everyone for being here let's let's take this
movement as far as we can as far as the bureaucracy with with the food
production it's actually pretty straightforward being a certified
producer and unlike cannabis the the bureaucracy with food production is kind
of a like okay here's your slip of paper there you go there's they're not they're
not chasing you down and checking on you in the same way no I don't think anybody
in Humboldt County ever got again exempt permit for a greenhouse on their small
farm before the cannabis thing came along
yeah we do I was asking if he does fertility testing we about every third
year we test our soil and just kind of see what what it's been up to and and
which direction it's going kind of informs us how to make our compost and
and if we need to amend adjust pH and stuff like that but you know one thing I
wanted to get back to for a second because I had this thought well well
Jesse was talking and talking about about the climate and and about nitrogen
fertilizer and and I was just quantifying it recently for another talk
I was doing in the the topsoil on this planet holds three times as much carbon
as the atmosphere as the entire atmosphere does so when you think about
what we're doing and why we're doing it industrial agriculture is is making
nitrogen fertilizer adding carbon to the atmosphere that way through fossil fuel
adding nitrogen to the soil so that it burns up the carbon in the soil and adds
that to the atmosphere in addition so the soil on this planet has the ability
to sequester all the carbon we need it to and and if our agriculture is doing
the opposite it's a huge missed opportunity and and I think at this
point anything we do with our with our productive lives at this point that we
can obviously we're all gonna be driving cars we're gonna be doing this and that
but if you're doing agriculture anyway do it in a way that puts carbon in the
soil and plant more plants just go buy plants everybody should be planting
plants perennials we need perennial calories we need perennials everywhere
there used to be so much perennials I mean there's 33 million acres of oaks in
California and how many of those acres are getting harvested just saying it's
food plants are solar-powered carbon sequestering machines like we're talking
about building carbon scrubbers and stuff it's like dude like yeah how about
forests and grassland and you know well integrated natural systems and
regenerative agriculture yeah we need to be putting it in the ground and there's
recent math done that potentially shows that if 10% of our ag lands convert over
we will sequester more than what we release that I just want to do a little
thing go back to your question about cannabis and food actually one of the
biggest regulatory burdens with cannabis and food is that I want to grow
my cannabis like I grow my food and rotate my crop through my farm and
that's nearly impossible because they're not treating cannabis like agriculture
for the state I would have to redraw and resubmit a map and a different site plan
each flippin year to move my cannabis through my farm yeah it's hard when the
inspector comes they want a little box around it they can measure and they want
it to be in the GPS points that on the site that you had it on any other
questions out there let's go right down and name six across the board that you
either resonate with or that you find would be easy for someone to identify on
their farm already there's there's so much I mean like okay you grow your own
food you eat it you use that energy to work soil to grow your own food to eat
it to use your energy to where do you live you can make compost you can make
worms you can harvest water you can grow things you can teach people things yeah
using the stocks and the rest of the plant as return nutrients regenerative
power solar and wind you know that's a regenerative system if you can localize
that I argue that that is almost sustainable system because the only
actual solar power that is regenerative is plants that's it because that's that's
you know you know it doesn't take power you don't have to mind anything there's
no solar cells there's no batteries there's no like silicon and lithium
being mined and there's huge issues with that and everything being like shift
everywhere it's way better than the alternative but I just yeah plants are
the only regenerative solar powered thing for me so cover cropping and
mulching is big for me and also and and and care for the wild lands thinking
about promoting native diversity and taking care of your forests and
watersheds well said we have alpacas on our farm and they work wonders with
fertility and fire suppression and they're really easy animals to handle so
I recommend having alpacas oh yeah yeah we have incorporated their manure into
our biodynamic compost piles now and spread their manure out throughout our
whole garden so we've had them over a year now and last year was amazing with
yeah with the amount of beautiful gondra that we produce so yeah it was amazing
oh my god it was such a treat walking onto their land you saw the videos well
yeah well maybe we'll play it with the audio here in a second but man just like
I came to the front yard and I was already so stoked because like you were
saying like you know every plant is but and it was like oh this is kind of how I
do my garden where I don't do anything and just like it's about the soil look
how cool this is and all these weird things that are growing and like and
it's a total mess but there's so much in there and so I was immediately just
really happy with that you know the messy like natural garden in the front
that had incredible soil and then we walk out back and it's just like holy
crap look at these monsters like we're just like just towering beautiful happy
plants that are grown in the soil now not tilled and biodynamic compost being
made with their closed-loop systems with their animals and and and they're in
Covila to where there's a biodynamic community so it's actually preps that
are made in that area and the information sharing that happens with
the biodynamic community there is really amazing and going to radical herbs was
incredible too like those guys practice biodynamics and cannabis probably better
than anyone I've ever seen it's like it's amazing the amount of food and
they're one of the winners of the award this year too and we'll play there we'll
play their movie yeah we'll play there's actually next when we will yeah and and
yeah she's having a getting close to having a child too so that's why they're
not here right now but amazing farms and and the genetics it actually like I was
really impressed with your energy immediately like just having the the
desire the care for the earth and the passion and it you know resonates and
you put ripples out and the moment I met you I was like oh yeah your plant too
like I identify with plant people and and I immediately just felt his energy
and was like yes plants like this person a lot that's a big deal you know cannabis
loves you it's so clear and you love it and ever and the genetics like growing
up with it like they was breeding since he was a child and paying attention
since he's a child and there's also a really amazing thing going on with the
genetics in their community and cove low to like the jog goo and the share we
went to all these different farms and the work that he's done with his
brothers are all over the place and tomorrow we're gonna have a very special
day of having some of the best breeders in the world like all here and getting
to hear from them and like yeah so that community work of sharing genetics of
talking about what works it's just so powerful that's one of our biggest tools
and we can't lose that because that's that's diversity that's what cannabis
wants us to be doing and you know mono cropping just og for you know those days
are over so great to answer her question you could do if you do breeding
that's a closed loop if you save seeds at the closed loop if you have aloe for
your clones that's a closed loop if you have an orchard that's a closed loop so
you know the concept of a closed loop is like it stays here and it goes in a
circle and so we have to like break that every now and then and it's okay to do
that because that's how you get your weed out into the world is breaking that
loop so it's it's that's like we use these terms and it's a very loose and
just kind of fluid so those are some easy closed loops that pretty much
anyone could do if you have an oak tree in your yard you can collect the leaves
and you know it's there's so many things you can do so we're gonna we're gonna
have Patricia identify some more here so those of you who like to write things
down because I would be I was taking notes all weekend I'm gonna list off so
closed loop systems incorporating what's on your farm so use what you have and be
we were sourceful go out there listen to the plants take step two okay so we got
closed loop systems we're also talking about water conservation in any way or
form that works in your local area know what your watersheds are connect with
your water that's near you know what's going on brings me to three local
community support so every drop of money I've ever made in cannabis has gone back
to my community the village hearth cooperative which I've talked about is
it's a nonprofit cafe and apothecary and art supporter that I'm just giving money
back to my community because investing in your local area investing in your not
just your local land not just with your family but like moving on to bigger
community get to know those people around you because that is that's your
bigger family and we're building up resilience together when we come
together so get on the same page another one is so many I have a really cool one
actually when you mentioned the hearth when we went to radical herbs one of the
things that they're doing is they raise meat birds and we were eating those
those birds in the food that we had there and that was really really cool
like oh wow these came from the farm that we were just at well as they're
raising these meat birds they're moving them down the line and that's the
fertility and they move it before they do too much disturbance but all these
these chickens are are pooping and putting fertility right back in an area
that they are going to grow cannabis and I think that's like amazing like
reading the bird that like was was grown that way and they also take that bone
meal and process it in and turn it into nutrition using yeah perhaps that
actually stuff you could probably learn from the flower days book as well I
thought that was a really cool system though that we're eating it I was gonna
add one more thing there's a devices you can buy if people are familiar with
flow forms it structures the water before you use it you can actually buy
inline flow forms that structures the water in your water usage goes down
unbelievable and on our farm we invested about $2,000 and we had these systems put
in and it's absolutely stunning how much less water you need so if anyone's water
poverty or just has doesn't have that much water or wants to conserve water
it's really worth looking at these devices because it's not you know it's
not that much money to spend to save you know I could pretty much say 50% less
water and I'd be pretty confident with that and for the first couple weeks I
was over watering and I called the owner of the company and I said what's going
on here he says stop watering so I was going about once a week I would water my
big plants in the heat of summer in Mendocino for some context. Also your
flowers are crazy tasty too like the terpenes that come out of that like the
less water the herbs that you're growing the the ferments that you're making with
them like really nice terpey flowers and putting that thought into it. We learned
that if you drought your plants out towards the end that that stress if you
do it right you can you can reduce your yield by a little bit but if you do it
right it's not that big of a deal but you do get a really rich terpene
profile through that dry stress is a plant is like stressing out and it's
talking it's yelling to all her friends there's no water and that's you know you
always say that a loud nose and that's why it's loud is because it's literally
talking I'm thirsty so don't water your plants at the end and it's really nice. I
would say for me one of the closed loops or one of the things I really like to
explore my farm is how I can build soil and how can I utilize some of the things
I already have on my farm like Patricia was saying and one of the things we use
for storing our cannabis at harvest when it's before it leaves the farm is
cardboard boxes so we're putting those cardboard boxes down in our pathways
we're putting our wood chip over that and what I've really seen and is the
mycelium just runs I mean it just I'll inoculate a little bit with Kingstra
Feria or some of the other mushroom blocks that I get and we were pulling
some back today we did a little farm tour this morning and it's incredible
like Elaine was saying you could pick it up and it's it's like a wind chime it's
grabbing those pieces of wood woody material and we have you know some of us
in Humboldt County and in parts of Mendo we have this agroforestry model that is
so rich we've endless biomass constantly and to the point that it's sloughing
onto our roads in the form of like fractured shale that we would normally
push aside and cast away but now that is such a light loose material we're adding
that to our beds and that is gonna provide food for food for our plants as
a mic microbes break it down and it really would replace something that
aerates and hold structure so that's one of the things we're doing and it really
is rewarding building that soil and closing that loop in that fashion and
you know I want to talk about well take on some more questions but one of the
things that Josh and Kelly were pushing at that first living soils was stop
spending money that was the second living soil a second living so yes stop
spending money and and they were dead serious about it and I wish I would have
slowed sooner because so much got taken out during compliance and then last
year's messaging was okay we stopped spending money we're trying to figure
this out plant more food plant more food plant more food and and I think the
messaging this year what I'm seeing with the collective being formed and that's
we need to hold hands we need to form stronger communities and you can see how
this has grown last year we were in the octagon and it would have been just the
first three rows and how this is growing and and this word can spread quickly and
and and it's challenging at first getting the momentum going in a
community until you hold those first couple gatherings barbecues whatever
excuses to get together this time of year it's great to do seed swap in
general and and that really brings people together to be on a tailgate at
first and then before you know you're meeting in some space and it's much
larger but I just wanted to share that and and the working together is really
crucial right now that that's gonna really help us all anymore questions out
there have you used your cannabis stock leaf material to feed cattle or animals
our alpacas actually love to help us like pluck leaves if you let them walk
around they'll pluck leaves I've heard them doing that in other gardens but
when we're out there harvesting they'll eat all the leaves they so I know
alpacas love leaves and another way that you can utilize those materials your
stock and every part of the plant you should be utilizing back into your
garden those stocks make awesome wood chips the roots are medicinal the whole
plant should be used that's another part of Dempura is there's no waste on the
farm because there doesn't need to be everything is is part of the system
that you're creating and to close that loop in that way it just makes your farm
so much stronger and saves you so much money I think goats would like the
stocks better than cows would to be honest yeah and go ahead chow down on
the stocks the leaves whatever good fences keep them from doing it too soon
yeah and this made me think about one of the things that we I'm sure we all do is
we don't pull our stocks and our roots out of the ground we leave that just to
just to stay in the soil and not disturb that my horizon zone and yeah so if you
think about it and Jesse is probably I'll let you share your last bit because
I know it's but on my farm for instance yeah we'll we'll break all the material
down we have run it through a chipper what we're trying to do but then we're
burning fuel but we're trying to take the smaller branches and put them deeper
into as a first layer of our compost area and build on top of that and we use
that as the aeration and then yeah some of the bigger stock though we run
through the chipper and we'll chip that right in place and keep that in the aisle
space or wherever you might need so all that leaves my farm is just the flower
and Jesse can brag a little deeper on that oh no no well I thought you're
gonna talk about I was gonna talk about you're watching no no no no no but what
I was gonna say is when Elaine was that you're talking about her pulling up
really really strong mycelium where it's like holding on to the wood chips and
that's drafaria I'm assuming because that's it this is a really strong
mycelium straferia rugoso and yulita it's the also known as the garden giant
or King's drafaria or wine cap there's a picture here it's hard if you're not
gonna be able to totally see it but there's a whole bunch of them sprouting
out and that's a cannabis stock next to it and it loves to eat cannabis chips or
stocks also stocks are really useful for building compost aeration you guys do a
good job of that I've been doing that for years I like the Peter Proctor
style of biodynamic compost building where you make kind of an air tunnel and
using what you have on site so like whether it's just branches from doing
some cleanup but cannabis stocks are so good and the worms love it and the
mycelium loves it but yeah if you if you have straferia to you feed you feed your
cannabis to that they'll eat it real quick and then they produce really
tasty mushrooms to eat but they're really good to eat yeah you know these
guys mentioned roots and I bet you know both these Casey and Daniel and you know
we're all growing companions but with root exudates we've learned is if you
have if you are going to be doing this secessional planting of say vegetables
or or lettuces next year cannabis if you if you have the if the baby root exudates
the the the veggie root exudates and the flowering root exudates you always have a
little bit of all of them happening throughout the time you know you're
you're you're leaning towards optimum and just having one is fine that's great
you're getting exudates but I'm sure Elaine talked about that and I'm no
expert on it but but we have learned that having different age plants within
your cannabis network is really cool so like so some of the things if you guys
want to do some cool things is having perennial plants planted around your
cannabis whether they're next to it underneath it or in the vicinity having
these ecosystems is really going to pay off in the long run and if you're
growing in greenhouses you can just put them around the greenhouses and there's
really clever things to do and it's actually going to grow you better weed
so it's pretty easy to go buy some native perennial plants that have flowers
on them. I'll just explain exudates for a second just in case anyone doesn't know
that but so plants taking in that photo energy they're able to produce different
foods basically like carbs that they can feed to the microorganisms right along
the rhizosphere that the microbes that are near the roots and by releasing
exudates full of different foods they can actually promote different microbial
populations and then those are going to be what's mineralizing what's in the
soil to bring out further nutrition so being able to produce good exudates is
very important. And if you don't want to do that just mulch the heck out of your
soil and you know that there's so many things we can do that are really leaning
that right direction. We used a small flower called agaridum in our greenhouses
this last year and it's a really good flower pollen food for beneficial
insects and for pollinators it's low growing we saw no root competition no
issue with what it was taking from from the cannabis plants and we kind of put
it on the southern edges of some of our beds under the shade under the
canopy of the cannabis but you know in a greenhouse you have enough light
diffusion that everything gets some sun but beautiful little purple flowers
grew about 12 inches tall or so and...
They don't need a lot of water do they?
No they do if they're near cannabis they're gonna get as much water as they want and they
didn't seem like they took water from the cannabis but I did notice a lot of
like like syphrid flies and predatory wasps and stuff like that often often
eating off of them so I felt like they were doing what I put them there for.
And that's the idea of having like all the different colors and sizes and shapes
because like that you'll see very small insects on things that you're not going
to see on other plants and and and figure out what plants that you want on
the the periphery on the outside of your garden to keep things there versus
having it in the middle of your garden and you know cilantro is a great one a
list like the really small flowers valerian yarrow is great but I would put
that on the periphery chamomile is absolutely amazing not only can you
harvest it and use it we use it for biodynamic preps one of its jobs in the
garden is to increase resin production so why wouldn't you do that that was
what the one that we did have issues with for competition but again we are
growing like one ounce sea of green plants so it's slightly different
context but if you're growing bigger plants you would go for it.
He was asking where it was and the the chamomile plant was on the bottom edge
of the where the walkway transitioned to the bed so like a foot away but in
the ground and not in the bed is obviously a half-size plant.
I was just going to say too with your with your gardens you can experiment probably with
anything and try like low growing foods some like herbs like cilantro you
mentioned that will bolt pretty quickly or spinach things that need that are
shady small and are still gonna allow you to have enough room and just play
with it and definitely lots of herbs all those fragrant flowery oily herbs.
Depending on the effect you're going for to there you can design your companion
planting system or around your needs so for instance you can get a good annual
seed mix that's a mix of flowers especially tailored towards beneficial
insects and those you don't need to grow them under your cannabis but if they're
you know every so often throughout your farms because their purpose is that that
they're a place that these these insects that are beneficial can go to for
different parts of their life cycle can go to to eat so that doesn't need to
necessarily be under your cannabis plant competing with its root space to have
the desired effect of adding the biodiversity that supports the insect
life you're looking for like in an IPM program.
Our favorite companion is potatoes we like putting those in the root zone and around the bigger plants will come off about 18 inches from each plant and put them in the four directions so we can after harvest we can literally forget about them and go back to those stocks and dig those up and it's a fun thing for my family to do.
Tulsi is amazing everybody should have Tulsi it smells amazing and the amount of insects on it in the fall is stunning.
Tulsi, holy basil, queen of herbs.
And if you have the space you should dedicate if you are in a greenhouse dedicate a garden bed to food and medicine if you don't want it to compete you know have other plants in your gardens other than cannabis it's going to help you with your pest it's going to help with the overall beneficial
insects that you're bringing in and by the way there's so many more beneficial insects than there are of bad ones so when you do find bugs or something's a problem I just am touching on that quickly that there's something you can use naturally you don't have to kill everything in your garden because then you kill all the good stuff too.
So I love yarrow.
Cyril you mentioned already mentioned it but I wanted to double down on it and it comes in so many different colors too so you get that aspect and it's also a native and I also would encourage
everyone to get to know anyone doing native plant nurseries in your area and figure out what the actual insects in your area need and what you know you can be doing to help the biodiversity in your area because the more we lose the natives like then these very specific insects that are keeping certain things in balance no longer can feed in the way that they have evolved to.
Thank you guys.
