[00:00.640 --> 00:11.520]  Welcome back everyone to the James Loud show. It is Sunday at 11am Pacific time. Thanks
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.520]  for joining us and your host, Mr. James Loud.
[00:15.520 --> 00:24.000]  How's it going everyone? Week 6 of the James Loud show. Today we've got DungeonVault Genetics,
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.360]  we've got Mosca's Teeth, we've got Rick from Mosca's Teeth, Eric from DungeonVault Genetics,
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.840]  Miles from Weed Should Taste Good, and we're going to start off talking to Adam from
[00:36.400 --> 00:43.600]  the Santa Cruz community. So Adam, how are you doing?
[00:44.160 --> 00:45.440]  Doing well, thank you. Good morning.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.560]  Good morning. How are the fires down in Santa Cruz?
[00:51.040 --> 00:51.360]  Sorry?
[00:52.160 --> 00:54.400]  How are the fires down there now? How's everything?
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.440]  Everything's finally under control and contained.
[01:06.960 --> 01:10.320]  Pretty wild time around here. I think about a third of the community was
[01:10.320 --> 01:11.840]  displaced at one point or another.
[01:15.040 --> 01:18.880]  So we wanted to talk about the auctions that we're going to be doing here.
[01:20.560 --> 01:22.960]  So if you want to tell everybody a little bit about that and
[01:23.920 --> 01:26.240]  kind of the direction you guys are going with that, that'd be great.
[01:26.800 --> 01:33.200]  Yeah, I put out a call kind of early on, maybe about 7 to 10 days or so into the fires. I think
[01:33.200 --> 01:37.520]  we saw fires everywhere from here all the way down to Southern California, all the way up eventually
[01:37.520 --> 01:44.080]  into Oregon and Washington. But I think they started here. We had a pretty insane lightning
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.800]  storm, the likes that no one had ever seen before here. I think in about a five-hour period we had
[01:48.800 --> 01:54.480]  over 10,000 lightning strikes. It was a pretty surreal experience. I was awake the whole night,
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.640]  it started about 2.30 in the morning and went to about 8 in the morning and then the fires started
[01:58.640 --> 02:05.200]  kicking off shortly after that. And then the next couple of months, I know even still there's
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.400]  probably fires raging somewhere between somewhere on the West Coast. I'm not up to date on all of it.
[02:10.400 --> 02:16.000]  But over the course of a few weeks, we had about 1,500 structures in the county burn,
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.040]  a thousand people lost their homes and it was general mayhem for quite a while. And
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.280]  I was doing a little fundraising thing on my Instagram page, just kind of trying to raise
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.240]  funds locally and it went really well for a couple days. And then I put out a post to get
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.560]  the community involved and the response was beyond overwhelming. It's been pretty insane to see the
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.760]  love and compassion and generosity that everybody's kind of put out there. And I think we've
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.480]  generated well over a thousand packs of seeds and now we're working on the logistics of how to
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.520]  get those seeds into people's hands and raise some funds and use that money to kind of help
[02:53.520 --> 03:01.120]  the communities. Awesome. And that's great. So if people are interested in donating,
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.520]  is there also a GoFundMe page right now going still? We don't have a GoFundMe page. We're
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.760]  going to be working with anything from individuals up through non-profit organizations. We're kind of
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.400]  compiling a list of all the different organizations that we're going to work with and we'll have
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.360]  that ready. I think we're going to launch next Tuesday night tentatively on Peter's show. We're
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.560]  going to have our first live auctions. And so we'll have more information as time goes on as
[03:28.560 --> 03:34.720]  to where the funds will go and how we'll be allocating all those things. It's been a real
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.400]  difficult journey trying to figure out how to do a fundraising effort due to the logistics of
[03:40.400 --> 03:47.040]  handling or not handling more importantly, the money. I didn't expect it to get anywhere near
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.600]  as big as it is. And we're looking at well over six figures. There's no telling how much we're
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.360]  going to be able to raise through these efforts. And it's not something I can just go through,
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.240]  put through my PayPal account and then forward to different organizations and stuff. So it's
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.000]  been a logistical nightmare, honestly, from somebody that doesn't have any experience in
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.440]  fundraising efforts or in running non-profits or any of this kind of work. So it's been a real
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.320]  big learning experience. We've had a great group of people that have stepped forward and helped
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.440]  with the process, Peter included. And it's been fun at times, been difficult at times,
[04:21.440 --> 04:27.200]  but we're really looking forward to the challenge ahead. So. Yeah, I mean, we, we, we, I think it's
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.120]  been the past like eight or nine weeks that we've been having our weekly kind of meetings to try to
[04:33.120 --> 04:40.960]  figure this out. And the big thing is none of us want tens of thousands of dollars pouring into
[04:40.960 --> 04:46.080]  our personal bank accounts that we then dole out to someone in need. So the question is, how do you
[04:46.080 --> 04:53.600]  create a mechanism so you can, you know, we've talked about kind of like a, like a gas station
[04:53.600 --> 04:58.560]  where it's like, let's pick someone first as a recipient and fill up their gas tank, which in
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.840]  this case is some money to help them out. So whether it's a non-profit such as Food Not Bombs,
[05:03.840 --> 05:10.240]  whether it's an individual who lost their house, you know, aim it at them, do something, raise a
[05:10.240 --> 05:15.440]  bunch of money for them, move on to the next person, the next person, the next person. But
[05:15.440 --> 05:23.840]  the big thing has been, you know, accepting payments and not wanting, you know, whether it's
[05:23.840 --> 05:29.280]  the tax implication for any of us, if we were to accept it and then cut a check to someone else,
[05:29.280 --> 05:35.040]  or just the perception of people saying, well, did you really give all the money to the person?
[05:35.040 --> 05:38.720]  Or did you keep some yourself? It's like, we don't want to deal with any of that.
[05:39.920 --> 05:44.720]  Right. So the best place to go to find out more information would probably be
[05:45.680 --> 05:49.680]  Santa Cruz Cannabis Community Instagram page.
[05:51.280 --> 05:58.720]  santacruzcannabisco.com is where I started it. We've subsequently launched a Cal Relief Fire
[05:58.720 --> 06:04.880]  Relief fundraiser page specifically for the efforts. And so I think that's probably between
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.640]  those two pages, I would say the Cal Relief page is probably the best moving forward.
[06:09.200 --> 06:11.840]  Yeah. Excellent, man.
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.600]  I'm let me just quickly pull that up. Give me one second.
[06:20.480 --> 06:24.560]  So yeah, this is the page we're talking about. So if you want to follow along,
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.080]  Cal Relief underscore, well, we could probably shorten that at some point,
[06:30.080 --> 06:35.920]  but it's currently Cal Relief underscore Fire Relief fundraiser. But we will shorten that.
[06:36.000 --> 06:36.500]  Excellent.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.960]  Okay, guys. Well, yeah, thank you for coming on the show. And I got seeds for you as well.
[06:42.960 --> 06:51.440]  So I got 40-50 packs for you. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Seeds coming out, gelato crosses that
[06:51.440 --> 06:58.640]  I've done with some partners. So yeah, we'll have those available. And yeah, thank you guys again.
[06:59.120 --> 07:07.600]  And yeah, thank you guys again. And let's get on to Dungeon Vault. Mr. Eric from Dungeon Vault,
[07:07.600 --> 07:13.040]  who I've known for a really, really long time. In the cannabis world a really long time.
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.280]  Before Dungeon Vault existed, he was with Ken, you were with Ken Estes, right?
[07:22.830 --> 07:29.150]  You got me muted. Okay. Yeah, I was with Ken for a while there. You know, some good times,
[07:29.150 --> 07:33.070]  bad times. But yeah, that's that. I met you at San Francisco show.
[07:33.070 --> 07:35.390]  San Francisco show in what, 2012, maybe?
[07:37.870 --> 07:42.750]  Yeah. Yeah. And there's a guy named Frosty Beans. You came up to my booth and you're like,
[07:42.750 --> 07:46.590]  there's that guy Frosty Beans that copied your logo. Because I was pissed about the
[07:47.150 --> 07:53.150]  logo that this guy did. That looked exactly like the Loud Seeds logo. I mean, he had the hands,
[07:53.150 --> 07:57.790]  like the hands and everything. And then I remember you pointing him out and I went and yelled at him
[07:57.790 --> 08:03.070]  and I think Ken was scared to death. I think I grabbed him by the shirt. And we've been friends
[08:03.070 --> 08:08.830]  ever since. So that's good. Yeah, no, it was a direct copy. I mean, there was really nothing
[08:08.830 --> 08:16.350]  changed. So it was very much stood out. I've seen this logo before. So yeah, it's pretty fun.
[08:16.350 --> 08:21.230]  Good times. And then, yeah, we've been to Barcelona together. We were supposed to be
[08:21.230 --> 08:28.190]  there this year along with Rick and Miles from Weed Should Taste Good. Rick's been on a lot of
[08:28.190 --> 08:34.670]  panels with me. We do weekly calls. Rick is just a great person from Moscow. Someone I really
[08:34.670 --> 08:39.630]  respect in the industry. I think he's done a lot of good. He has a lot of variety of
[08:39.630 --> 08:45.390]  different genetics and he's really passionate as well. So yeah, welcome to the show guys.
[08:48.560 --> 08:49.040]  Thank you.
[08:49.040 --> 08:52.320]  Yeah, so how's COVID been treating you guys? We'll start with you, Rick.
[08:55.600 --> 09:03.840]  You know what? We have been busier than ever this year. Just with COVID happening,
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.920]  a lot of people are growing their own medicine. There's a lot of new growers that are entering
[09:09.920 --> 09:16.320]  the market, especially in these new states that are coming online that have legalized both
[09:16.320 --> 09:23.600]  medically and recreationally. And so those small home growers that have the five plant count
[09:24.400 --> 09:33.600]  in flour and or five in veg. And so we're seeing a lot of new growers who are looking for the
[09:33.600 --> 09:44.160]  education and really just some expertise in helping them get started and what is the right path,
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.480]  the right direction to go. Excellent. Eric, how's COVID been treating you?
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.520]  It's been strange. I mean, like Rick just said, it's been nice. It's been a blessing in the sense
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.680]  that there's a lot of people sitting at home that are growers and or people that are looking to
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.000]  spend the money that they have. But at the same time, you see so much, yeah, there's just a lot
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.840]  of craziness going on. I think it's affected everybody in a certain way. So whether it be
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.040]  financially or emotionally or whatever, there's a struggle with everyone of us. But I feel like
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.200]  the cannabis industry has gained speed and we haven't really slowed down at all. It seems like
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.960]  everyone's gotten their little piece of the pie and a lot of new startups I've seen. And it seems
[10:28.960 --> 10:36.640]  like it's been a business that has not lost any traction whatsoever during this time.
[10:38.640 --> 10:42.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we got Miles here now. How are you doing, Miles?
[10:46.650 --> 10:58.820]  Miles, you got to pick an audio source. So if you tap that sprocket and then just pick
[10:58.820 --> 11:03.220]  the microphone source. But James, why don't you talk? I'll troubleshoot with Miles.
[11:03.220 --> 11:12.180]  Sure. So yeah, so actually the 4 of us plus Adam Dunn and Dark Horse were all supposed to
[11:12.180 --> 11:18.580]  have a booth this year, but it got canceled at Spanavis because of COVID. I was literally in
[11:18.580 --> 11:24.020]  Barcelona on the 13th of March, or I think it was the 12th when Trump made the announcement
[11:24.020 --> 11:28.100]  that there was going to be no international travel, which actually changed. But it freaked
[11:28.100 --> 11:33.700]  everybody out. I had friends that were heading to the airport 45 minutes after the television
[11:33.700 --> 11:38.500]  thing at like 2am in the morning. So it's kind of good to have these guys back together
[11:39.220 --> 11:45.700]  talking about genetics. And we got Miles live yet? Still working on Miles.
[11:47.380 --> 11:54.980]  He was and his audio is working, but I think he big thumbed the wrong button. And he's coming back
[11:56.660 --> 12:06.500]  in 3, 2, 1. There he is. He keeps touching the screen and hanging up on himself.
[12:07.060 --> 12:10.900]  So how long have you been in the industry? Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[12:11.860 --> 12:12.980]  How long have you been breeding?
[12:14.980 --> 12:26.500]  I've been growing for a little over a year. Breeding 13, 14 years. And you know,
[12:27.380 --> 12:34.020]  I never intended to be a breeder. It was just I wanted to preserve and protect a strain or two,
[12:34.100 --> 12:40.980]  strains I really connected with when the first being Cinderella 99. And so I wanted to preserve
[12:40.980 --> 12:47.300]  the strain so I never lost it. And a very good friend of mine, headed slot who owned
[12:47.860 --> 12:55.300]  Mags genetics at the time, one of my best friends, he really indoctrinated me into
[12:55.860 --> 13:02.580]  breeding and learning the finer points of breeding, what to look for, with selections,
[13:03.140 --> 13:14.340]  and and I made seeds from five different F1 families of original Brothers Grimm seeds,
[13:14.340 --> 13:23.300]  along with other seeds from gypsy Nirvana, Wally Duck, Joey weed, any Brothers Grimm,
[13:23.300 --> 13:29.460]  anything I could get my hands on, grew all those out, selected the best ones that I could find,
[13:30.100 --> 13:38.900]  and came up with my own version of back cross version. And as a result, I had
[13:39.460 --> 13:47.620]  1000s of seeds I didn't know what to do with and Garrett suggested I sent some gypsy
[13:48.900 --> 13:57.220]  so he could give them out. He was running CB at the time and I see mag. So I did. And
[13:57.460 --> 14:07.620]  he gave them out and he gave several packs of seeds to a senior editor at high times,
[14:07.620 --> 14:18.420]  crazy composer who is on IG right now. Just an amazing grower. Both gypsy and crazy composer
[14:18.420 --> 14:26.580]  really, really love the Cinderella 99. And so they were they were pretty much as good of experts as
[14:26.580 --> 14:36.740]  you can find. And so crazy composer did a blog and week by week updated everyone as to how's
[14:36.740 --> 14:46.260]  how's grow was. And he was he was very pleased with his his plants when they finished. And,
[14:46.980 --> 14:52.660]  you know, it was a true pineapple Fino that I selected for. That's what he got. And really,
[14:52.660 --> 14:58.420]  I guess that was the rest is history as it goes. And, you know, that just started here. All of a
[14:58.420 --> 15:03.300]  sudden, everybody wanted them. And then I guess that just kind of got me going. But
[15:03.940 --> 15:08.020]  it was just really a passion for love of the plant that got me started.
[15:10.180 --> 15:13.700]  Awesome. Yeah.
[15:16.740 --> 15:18.660]  I'm doing well. I'm glad to be in the mix.
[15:19.300 --> 15:26.180]  Yeah. Awesome to have you here. So yeah, Miles was supposed to be with me at Spanavis. And
[15:27.460 --> 15:31.380]  we haven't met in person, but we were on the Adam Dunn show not too long ago
[15:31.940 --> 15:37.220]  together. And he's doing some really interesting things with genetics. So Miles, you want to tell
[15:37.220 --> 15:41.940]  us a little bit about yourself and how long you've been in the industry? How long you've been breeding?
[15:42.820 --> 15:48.020]  Sure. Yeah, I've been been out here in Colorado 10 years. I was growing back east before that.
[15:48.980 --> 15:56.180]  I moved out here to grow in big warehouses in Denver and did that for a pretty long time until
[15:56.180 --> 16:02.820]  the regulations kind of kicked in in 2013 or so. And, you know, when the regulatory aspect kicked
[16:02.820 --> 16:08.660]  in real hard, I kind of backed off a little bit and started to go back into my own thing,
[16:09.380 --> 16:14.340]  which became breeding, obviously. And yeah, I kind of used a bunch of these cuts from the
[16:14.340 --> 16:20.500]  warehouse days to start some stuff off with, you know, some Bubba Kush lines that, you know,
[16:20.500 --> 16:26.100]  the real good Katsu and pre-98 cuts that I had access to and was just fortunate enough to use
[16:26.100 --> 16:32.980]  them, used a white widow male on them and kept some lines going from that white widow, old white
[16:32.980 --> 16:39.940]  widow from a greenhouse, I believe it was, to a pre-98 Bubba. And those a long time and made a
[16:39.940 --> 16:44.900]  bunch of stuff with them. And mostly at first just gave them to growers. I knew they were like big
[16:44.900 --> 16:48.420]  outdoor growers and they were, they dug them and just turned into a thing every year. And
[16:50.260 --> 16:57.220]  I've been tailoring seeds and lines towards the Colorado climate, like shorter seasons, dry.
[16:58.180 --> 17:04.020]  So I need fast finishers to finish before the snow falls out here. And that's what I've been
[17:04.740 --> 17:10.180]  gearing everything towards. And it, the last few years, the outdoor seeds have been amazing
[17:10.180 --> 17:15.380]  finishing real quick and, and growers, other breeders in my area have been doing a similar
[17:15.380 --> 17:22.580]  thing with like a Canyon Queen is a good example of that from Rootwise or Elk Valley Heirlooms.
[17:22.580 --> 17:26.500]  It's got some great stuff all based on the Mandelbrot Royal Kush line that, that
[17:27.140 --> 17:32.660]  short stocky, fast finishing Indica Kush lines, kind of similar to Sour Bubble, the Bog line,
[17:33.780 --> 17:39.300]  from my, that I have a lot of respect for Bog. I've always grown his stuff and had good results.
[17:39.940 --> 17:45.300]  And yeah, so I've been just out here. I got my little farm out on the Western side of Colorado
[17:47.620 --> 17:50.660]  about four or five years ago, four and a half years ago now. And I've been just
[17:51.460 --> 17:55.940]  committed to doing my thing out here now that's a stable, good, good situation.
[17:57.940 --> 18:05.300]  Awesome. So we get Eric from Dungeon Vault. You want to tell us a little about how long
[18:05.300 --> 18:10.100]  you've been breeding, you know, what you've been breeding, you know, how long you've been
[18:10.100 --> 18:15.540]  in the industry. You do some amazing stuff. So. Yeah. So I think it all started with,
[18:16.340 --> 18:19.940]  you know, not necessarily with Ken. I mean, the breeding with Ken, definitely. But
[18:19.940 --> 18:24.180]  before that, I'd just been, I've been reading, you know, magazines and then super into,
[18:24.740 --> 18:29.940]  just interested in the genetic side of, of marijuana in general, since I was, you know,
[18:29.940 --> 18:33.860]  a youngster. So I think that was kind of where I nerded out in high school. I was more interested
[18:33.860 --> 18:38.180]  in the crosses and looking into, you know, all the different breeds going on and wanting to know
[18:38.180 --> 18:42.580]  the strain names. Whereas everyone was just smoking. We had tons of stuff that was unnamed.
[18:42.580 --> 18:48.500]  It was just, you know, green bud, bomb, whatever the hell you throw a name on it. But we, we got
[18:48.580 --> 18:53.460]  into that long, long time ago. But then I think when I, the turning point was meeting some guy
[18:53.460 --> 18:58.980]  that turned me on to Ken and that really got me into the industry, so to speak. Whereas I was
[18:59.540 --> 19:04.340]  around people like yourself and other like-minded individuals who had, who'd, you know, I'd been
[19:04.340 --> 19:09.700]  reading about and, and heard of for a while. So it was really cool to kind of almost nostalgic
[19:09.700 --> 19:14.740]  in a sense, you know, just meet all these people that were, you know, basically can of celebrities,
[19:14.740 --> 19:23.380]  I'll call them. But yeah, so I got with Ken, I was around, I think I met Ken in like 2000 and
[19:24.660 --> 19:30.100]  I don't know what year it was, but 2010 or 11 or something like that, maybe earlier, but
[19:30.100 --> 19:35.460]  started breeding with him after a couple of years with him. And, and you know, that's when things
[19:35.460 --> 19:41.620]  kind of got a little bit crazy, but we had some good times and since then I feel like I've done
[19:41.620 --> 19:46.820]  all right on my own and I feel like I've made, made a name for myself and I've just tried to
[19:46.820 --> 19:53.220]  keep it as real as I can. Although my mouth can get me into trouble, I keep, I speak the truth
[19:53.220 --> 20:00.260]  and I try to try to keep everything on the up and up. But I'd say as of now, my purple gelato breed,
[20:00.260 --> 20:05.540]  that, that's the thing I'm most focused on. I've been pretty pumped on everything I've seen from
[20:05.540 --> 20:11.300]  testers and everything we've released to this point. There's been a ton of great feedback
[20:11.300 --> 20:16.980]  overall from everything we've been dropping. So I'm just happy to see everyone enjoying my stuff.
[20:16.980 --> 20:21.620]  You know, that's, that just makes me feel good that people are actually spending money and, and
[20:21.620 --> 20:27.060]  using their garden space to produce genetics. I've made considering so many choices out there
[20:27.060 --> 20:32.100]  nowadays as to what you can put in your garden. So respect to everyone who spends any money on my
[20:32.100 --> 20:36.980]  stuff. I, I try to put my heart into it and I want to, I want you guys to smoke stuff that I
[20:36.980 --> 20:40.580]  would be excited to smoke. And that's pretty much all I'm trying to work with is things that I would
[20:40.580 --> 20:47.300]  want to open the jar to and, and smoke on. So. Awesome. So I have a question for you, Eric,
[20:48.100 --> 20:52.660]  that we can, we can start off with you. How critical is pheno hunting in the seed making
[20:52.660 --> 20:55.860]  process? We're going to go around with everybody, but we'll start with Eric.
[20:56.740 --> 21:02.180]  Extremely important because I mean, you can pop, you can pop any number of seeds,
[21:02.180 --> 21:09.060]  whether it be regular or, or feminized. You can, you can pop one seed and, and find something
[21:09.060 --> 21:13.060]  special and say, wow, look at this. This is something me and my friends, every one of us are,
[21:13.060 --> 21:19.300]  are we, we love this and that's all cool. But then you got a friend shows up a week later,
[21:19.300 --> 21:24.820]  you see something on the internet and all of a sudden you're like, wow, that one looks a hell
[21:24.820 --> 21:29.140]  of a lot better than mine. It's almost like when you get a tattoo, you go out, you spend hard money
[21:29.140 --> 21:32.660]  on a tattoo, you put something on your body, then you go around and you see someone else walk
[21:32.660 --> 21:36.340]  around and they've got something better than you. That looks the same, right? Where did you get that?
[21:37.060 --> 21:42.340]  Well, in the same sense, you gotta, you gotta hunt it out, man. If you can do a proper hunt and
[21:42.340 --> 21:46.020]  really see what's out there, you might find something that really blows your mind compared
[21:46.020 --> 21:53.140]  to what you originally thought was going to do. Just, you know, justify the purchase and, you know,
[21:53.220 --> 21:57.140]  be your keeper cut. Well, there's, there's, there's so much more to it, whether it be you're
[21:57.140 --> 22:02.180]  hunting males or female, the expressions they show in a wider range, you're actually able to see,
[22:02.740 --> 22:08.500]  uh, I mean, let's, I mean, it doesn't need to be a warehouse that's unrealistic for most of people
[22:08.500 --> 22:14.900]  out there, but even from a home grower, filling up a, a 10 by 10 tent compared to a little four
[22:14.900 --> 22:18.820]  by four, you're going to see so much more that you may not have been able to see. And that's,
[22:18.820 --> 22:24.100]  what's really going to set that strain apart. So sometimes there's fast judgments put on strains
[22:24.100 --> 22:29.460]  and by breeders just off someone popping a small amount of seeds. And that's really not fair
[22:29.460 --> 22:38.100]  because you really got to see a wider, um, widespread, uh, phenotype selection process to
[22:38.100 --> 22:45.620]  really get a, a good example of what that strain has to offer. So how many do you recommend a
[22:45.620 --> 22:52.180]  person hunting if they're looking for that, that winner? I mean, as much as I want to say that
[22:52.180 --> 22:56.580]  every one of us out there can release one pack of seeds and I mean, one pack is good and you're
[22:56.580 --> 23:00.580]  going to find something great. I would say at least grab a couple. You know what I mean? If you,
[23:00.580 --> 23:06.420]  if you grab two packs of seeds, you're almost assured, you know, 10, 12, 15 females, depending
[23:06.420 --> 23:11.540]  on how many seeds per pack, you know, if we go at that 50, 50 ratio. And if that was the case,
[23:11.540 --> 23:17.940]  that could very well set, you know, just set it up way more perfect because if you only had those
[23:17.940 --> 23:22.260]  five seeds and you get three males and you're sitting there judging between two females, not
[23:22.260 --> 23:26.020]  only are you going to be like, okay, these two, I'm not really even that stoked on when that could
[23:26.020 --> 23:31.060]  have been that, that extra seven to 10 seeds that pop up in your, in your garden, that would have
[23:31.060 --> 23:36.340]  been the one that, you know, was the deal breaker. So I feel maybe a couple of packs of each, you
[23:36.340 --> 23:43.780]  know, on the, on the small end. Yeah. So in the seed making process, you do pheno hunts. How many
[23:43.780 --> 23:50.420]  do you use for your selections or does it depend on the variety and the space? Yeah, exactly. Space.
[23:50.420 --> 23:55.460]  I mean, there's, there's many of us out there that have gone recreational, you know, and congrats on
[23:55.460 --> 24:02.260]  that. Some people have a, a, a literal eight to 10,000 square foot warehouse where they can do
[24:02.260 --> 24:07.220]  these hunts and really see what they've got. And I commend those people. Congratulations. That's
[24:07.780 --> 24:14.900]  absolutely where I think every one of us would like to be one day, if not soon. But again,
[24:14.900 --> 24:20.580]  realistically, I think sometimes I think the most we've ever done at one time was damn near a hundred
[24:20.580 --> 24:25.140]  of one strain. And that was good. You know, I feel like that gave us a pretty damn good idea of what
[24:25.140 --> 24:30.100]  we're going to find and gave everyone a good, you know, example of what, what a good keeper would be
[24:30.100 --> 24:35.700]  from our stuff. And that should have done it as far as showing off as many phenotypes are going to
[24:35.700 --> 24:42.340]  pop up. But again, it's really just depends, but I would say the average grower, you know,
[24:43.860 --> 24:49.380]  like I said, 20 to 30 or so, but for us, yeah, 30, 40, 50 plus, that'd be great to start from.
[24:51.220 --> 24:57.940]  Awesome. So Rick, what's your opinion on pheno hunting in the seed making process?
[25:00.180 --> 25:13.620]  You know, it's really important, I think, to really set your strains apart to really do
[25:15.380 --> 25:23.700]  those, those deep hunts. Like we bought a farm last year. And so late last year, our first
[25:23.700 --> 25:34.660]  pheno hunt was 500, over 500 seeds, it was like 550. And then we just popped about 300 seeds.
[25:35.940 --> 25:43.140]  And so, you know, those are obviously multiple strains, but, you know, I think like Eric said,
[25:43.860 --> 25:50.500]  you want to see the expressions, you know, what is it that this plant is about? And really seeing
[25:50.500 --> 25:59.140]  their traits, what's recessive. So let me give you an example, James, I just did some testing on
[26:00.260 --> 26:09.140]  some test crosses that I did early in the year, ran them outdoors. And it was a legend, OG,
[26:09.860 --> 26:24.420]  reversed male, and I hit up a chem dog OG. And I ran probably like 32 females. And out of all those,
[26:24.420 --> 26:29.540]  they were all very, very similar. But there was one that just stood out that was just,
[26:30.500 --> 26:36.820]  yeah, pardon the pun loud. And it was just really nasty, loud. And just
[26:38.500 --> 26:45.620]  once we went through all the testing of the flower, just really, really amazing smoke.
[26:47.460 --> 26:53.300]  And we haven't had it tested, but it definitely would test, you know, high 20s,
[26:53.860 --> 27:04.260]  low 30s. But so that selection is so key, but back to the original 550
[27:05.540 --> 27:14.420]  test seeds that we popped of those, you know, like you and I discussed, we're looking for those
[27:14.420 --> 27:24.180]  one percenters out of those 550. There were five to 10 standouts that I held back. We called a lot
[27:24.180 --> 27:33.940]  of those. But, you know, it's really looking for those that are going to be really hit on all
[27:33.940 --> 27:40.980]  cylinders, everything from, you know, really strong, vigorous grower, ones that are in a clone
[27:40.980 --> 27:51.700]  easy ones that are going to have very frosty flowers that are going to test high, that are
[27:51.700 --> 28:03.220]  unique smelling, unique tasting. And so it's we really vet quite a lot. And so we have done
[28:04.180 --> 28:11.940]  a lot more testing together at one time now with the farm versus before where we had
[28:12.820 --> 28:22.500]  smaller rooms where we would do, you know, the 25 to 30 at a time because of space limitations.
[28:23.620 --> 28:29.780]  Now that is actually worked to our advantage because of the farm that we have now with
[28:29.780 --> 28:37.540]  selection. So, yeah, the larger sample sizes, just like in statistics, you know, you're going to find,
[28:38.580 --> 28:43.940]  you know, the bell curve in expressions. So some of you are going to like a lot you're not going to like,
[28:44.500 --> 28:51.860]  but really looking for those very, very special plants that really hit on all cylinders.
[28:51.940 --> 29:00.750]  So, Miles, how critical is phenohunting in your seed making process?
[29:04.920 --> 29:10.680]  It's everything. I always say that the cull is really like where it's at, like what you're
[29:10.680 --> 29:16.520]  throwing out, what you're deciding isn't making the cut and what isn't staying in the line
[29:17.560 --> 29:24.840]  is really key, you know. So I think it's incredibly important. I've kind of been a
[29:24.840 --> 29:31.400]  good balance there between, you know, Mosca and Dungeon Vault here that like anywhere from
[29:32.520 --> 29:39.080]  50 to a couple hundred is what I shoot for, like in terms of females looking more like 30
[29:39.800 --> 29:47.720]  out of 50, 25 to 30 out of 50, you know. So shooting for at least a couple, a few dozen
[29:47.720 --> 29:53.080]  minimum to look through and yeah, like finding those keepers, finding those recessives
[29:53.640 --> 29:59.080]  that you want to, that contain the traits you're looking for. That's really, it's always about
[29:59.080 --> 30:05.480]  chasing the traits and finding what you want out of the genetic pool that you're working with.
[30:06.600 --> 30:13.800]  And finding those genetic aberrations, the recessives can be huge to align. I mean, it can
[30:13.800 --> 30:19.640]  define all the generations that come after it. You can always say, oh, I can tell that mom is
[30:19.640 --> 30:26.760]  in there. I can remember that female back then, this is carrying her traits. And I think that's
[30:26.760 --> 30:33.240]  where the power lies is also like how true breeding is the line. Like if you've got a
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.440]  female that's aberrant and recessive, is she going to pass on those recessive traits or is it just
[30:38.440 --> 30:44.200]  going to get lost in the mix again? And I think, you know, lines that are well worked, in my
[30:44.200 --> 30:50.120]  experience, lines that are well worked carry traits better, like more inbred of lines
[30:50.120 --> 30:58.200]  back across deeper down into the filial generations is those traits carry more into
[30:58.200 --> 31:03.960]  their hybrids. So that's kind of, so that's always been something I've looked for.
[31:03.960 --> 31:10.520]  It's usually to me about flavor and frost, you know, got to get you nice and ripped or have
[31:10.520 --> 31:17.880]  like that really unique or iconic flavor, like that cammy or bubba or something that people relate
[31:18.600 --> 31:26.120]  to an iconic ganja strain or something that finishes in a time frame, has a good stature
[31:26.120 --> 31:31.720]  and structure or, you know, suited for a region or an environment is always key too, to know,
[31:32.360 --> 31:35.640]  you know, if a bunch of these seeds are going to be grown in a humid climate,
[31:35.640 --> 31:42.280]  where's the resistance to mold and mildew and the longer flowering expressions in those southern
[31:42.280 --> 31:47.320]  hot climates? So it's always about chasing those, finding the traits, defining the traits you want
[31:47.320 --> 31:53.720]  to find and then finding them within the seed stock. That's always been the chase for me.
[31:54.520 --> 32:00.200]  And the bigger the net cast, the, you know, better choice you're going to have. So it's always about
[32:00.200 --> 32:08.360]  numbers and the, yeah, it's just about balancing numbers with your, you know, your capabilities and
[32:08.360 --> 32:12.280]  your infrastructure and all that. Yeah, I mean, I've always had the belief that you want to run
[32:12.280 --> 32:16.120]  at least 100 and 100 makes it nice for percentages because you're looking for that 1%.
[32:17.080 --> 32:24.200]  You know, Shored, one of my good friends, Shored Brooks, who works with Wilcox and
[32:24.200 --> 32:30.840]  ran, in fact, he still runs Harborside, their greenhouse in Salinas. He does huge phenohunts
[32:30.840 --> 32:37.880]  where you're doing 2000, you know, 500 to 2000 of a variety, sometimes 20,000 plants. It's really
[32:37.880 --> 32:42.680]  hard to keep track when you get that big, but you're able to find those outliers and
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.560]  dealing with outliers, that's where you find the magic, the really interesting stuff
[32:48.440 --> 32:53.480]  that's really unique, you know, and I try to run at least 100 of everything when I'm doing
[32:53.480 --> 32:59.800]  phenohunts for breeding. You know, I'm in the position where I like to stabilize stuff as well,
[32:59.800 --> 33:04.680]  and I'm not talking about intersexual traits as much as inbred lines. The problem with that,
[33:04.680 --> 33:11.000]  which is what I'd like to talk about next, is by the time I make something that's an F4, F5, or F6,
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.600]  it's not trendy anymore. Miles, I guess we could start with you. How do you feel about your
[33:16.680 --> 33:19.880]  inbred lines and popular varieties?
[33:22.840 --> 33:24.840]  You said it's not trending anymore.
[33:27.720 --> 33:32.440]  Is that what you said, James? It's not trending anymore? A lot of stuff trends so fast, people
[33:32.440 --> 33:38.120]  want stuff one day, they want this, the next day they want something that's a little bit different,
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.800]  and it's like, by the time we stabilize our stuff, it's not necessarily trending anymore. I feel like
[33:43.800 --> 33:49.480]  that trend will go away, but I feel like right now, this stuff is really trending hot on the F1s,
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.800]  and so if you're not constantly making new F1 polyhybrids like everybody else,
[33:55.800 --> 33:59.880]  you're not going to sell as many seeds. What's your take on that?
[34:01.480 --> 34:07.800]  Sure, yeah. I mean, I think that flavor, the nature of like flavor that people want different
[34:07.800 --> 34:13.160]  flavors is always going to be a challenge, a hurdle that the breeders have to address and be
[34:13.160 --> 34:20.360]  on their toes for. Taking your signature thing and hitting it to all the hot flavors that
[34:20.360 --> 34:27.080]  are out there is a well-played trick, not trick, but a well-played maneuver by a lot of breeders
[34:27.080 --> 34:33.960]  to showcase their traits alongside, their lines alongside the new hype shit, which is awesome,
[34:33.960 --> 34:39.080]  which is, I mean, it's what you got to do, it's what you're talking about. I think the way that,
[34:39.080 --> 34:45.400]  at least the way I've insulated myself from that, the double-edged sword side of that is that I've
[34:45.400 --> 34:53.400]  been breeding for outdoor, like big growers out here in Colorado, and more recently for people
[34:53.400 --> 35:01.480]  in Cali who get my seeds every year, breeding for environment and for region, because that doesn't
[35:02.200 --> 35:10.920]  change. The climate of an area that grows a lot of herb outside is generally consistent, and they
[35:10.920 --> 35:16.200]  say, oh, our first frost is this time, we get in the ground by this time. That's something that
[35:16.200 --> 35:21.480]  I've used to insulate, and those are the lines that I've worked really hard, are these faster
[35:21.480 --> 35:27.080]  finishers, short stocky that can deal with the wind, can deal with cold, can deal with drought,
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.160]  don't dry, like dry air, obviously, we still give them plenty of water, but
[35:33.880 --> 35:40.520]  these are the traits that I've been chasing in the more, my previous, like really
[35:40.520 --> 35:47.480]  worked lines, the deeper into the filial generations, the inbreds, and I've used a lot
[35:47.480 --> 35:55.080]  of inbred lines, like deep chunk, like sour bubble, like things that have those inbred traits of being
[35:55.080 --> 36:00.920]  fast finishing, short stocky, for the breeding for the traits of the region, instead of the flavor,
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.200]  but the flavor is always top priority, I mean, that's obviously the top priority,
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.400]  but I think insulating yourself from that trendiness by just chasing the traits that work
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.800]  for the region, that's the biggest thing for me. Yeah.
[36:18.520 --> 36:21.640]  Yeah, I find it a balance. I feel like there's a balance between it,
[36:21.800 --> 36:27.240]  me personally, it's like, I'm working on stabilizing stuff, I'm working on some
[36:28.200 --> 36:33.320]  auto lines that are, you know, they take time, auto lines take for a really long time, one of my,
[36:33.320 --> 36:38.680]  I just got into breeding autos a couple years ago, and it's definitely challenging, you know,
[36:38.680 --> 36:43.640]  breeding something that's novel as well, it's not just like everyone else's stuff. So Rick, what's
[36:43.640 --> 36:52.520]  your take on males? And how do you keep your males alive? Do you have males that you've kept
[36:52.520 --> 37:05.800]  alive? And do they stay in bed? Yes, I do keep probably a good 15 to just over 20 males,
[37:06.360 --> 37:14.920]  some that I've had for years. And it's taking clones of clones. And, you know, I got some
[37:14.920 --> 37:24.360]  really good advice from Odie and Shane a couple years ago, where they recommended that you should
[37:24.360 --> 37:31.000]  always clone your breeding stock every three months to keep them fresh and just keep them,
[37:31.000 --> 37:37.880]  you know, in good condition. And that's worked very well over these past few years. But yeah,
[37:37.880 --> 37:45.720]  you know, males, you have to, one thing that I do is, you know, I kind of don't treat them all that
[37:45.720 --> 37:53.880]  great, you know, kind of keep them small pots. So limiting the root size, seeing how do they keep,
[37:53.880 --> 38:01.240]  are they going to force into flower, you know, underwater, over water, low light, high light,
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.920]  you know, kind of treat them like crap, and see how they perform. Are they going to just, you
[38:06.920 --> 38:14.680]  know, stay in bed? Are they going to flower prematurely, because of these not so perfect
[38:14.680 --> 38:24.520]  conditions. And it has seemed to, you know, really done well with those that survive,
[38:25.400 --> 38:33.320]  because we're constantly popping seeds, like I mentioned before. And so, you know, this is
[38:33.320 --> 38:43.720]  keeping those males that I may want to work with in the future. It helps to vet those and keep those
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.040]  kind of around until, you know, something doesn't go right with them. And then we'll
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.920]  look to other ones. So yeah, so that's what we do.
[38:58.520 --> 39:02.280]  Let's talk to you about some males, because I know you've kept males alive. And
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.880]  you've got some interesting lines that you've created. Tell us a little bit about your male
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.520]  process for storing males and keeping them alive.
[39:16.190 --> 39:23.390]  Basically, we were doing similar stuff for a while that I was using. I'd try and keep a male
[39:23.390 --> 39:28.270]  around for a while. But, you know, just cloning it and doing that thing. And just like I would
[39:28.270 --> 39:33.230]  with any other keeper female, it just kind of stuck to the lineup. And I'd have him, you know,
[39:33.230 --> 39:38.030]  from all stages of life, you know, just so I could throw it in at any point. I always do a
[39:38.830 --> 39:43.950]  whole male plant into a room at a certain point, or, you know, got a flower and introduced it.
[39:45.070 --> 39:49.630]  I had done the, I had done different techniques with my pollinations. But I think that was what
[39:49.630 --> 39:53.470]  worked best for me was just always throwing a fresh plant in there. So I just always kept fresh
[39:53.470 --> 40:00.190]  stock. And yeah, that's what I was doing for a while there. I got to a point though, where I just,
[40:00.190 --> 40:05.150]  I don't really keep the male around anymore. Basically, when it's done, it's done. So it's,
[40:05.710 --> 40:11.390]  my whole goal was to not continue to make the same, I guess, F1 over and over and over again.
[40:11.390 --> 40:16.830]  But just had stock of it. And when it sells out, it sells out. And it's my goal to continue that
[40:18.190 --> 40:24.110]  line if it was popular or not. So, you know, F2s and onward. So that's where I was at with that.
[40:25.470 --> 40:28.750]  It worked out pretty good. I was happy with everything. I've got a good amount of seeds
[40:28.750 --> 40:33.870]  stored up from like my recent few breeds I've done. And I think with me moving and doing a few
[40:34.030 --> 40:38.990]  other things, I just found it was, you know, I just, it was just easier for me to just ditch
[40:38.990 --> 40:43.150]  the male after I made enough seeds. So start fresh or something else or find something new,
[40:43.150 --> 40:52.930]  but go from there. So what are your thoughts on autoflowers? We'll go with Eric.
[40:53.890 --> 40:59.330]  Well, personally, considering I just got done doing a nice grow on the summer, it was,
[41:00.290 --> 41:07.490]  it was actually better this year. So I did one the previous summer and I didn't have as much
[41:07.490 --> 41:13.810]  luck. I let them, I let them basically root bound in a small little pot way too quick inside before
[41:13.810 --> 41:19.730]  getting them outdoors to do their thing. And that hurt me. I still ended up with a decent harvest
[41:19.730 --> 41:24.930]  and it really actually made a beautiful live resin. I mean, it was some of the best stuff we
[41:25.490 --> 41:33.730]  processed. So in my opinion, I highly value them. I think they're a great plant for people who are,
[41:33.730 --> 41:37.170]  if you're looking to just start something out, you want to get into growing and try something
[41:37.170 --> 41:43.330]  without, you know, without spending a ton of time vegging some plant only to find out that you
[41:43.330 --> 41:47.250]  don't really know what to do from there. I mean, these things, they take care of themselves. I,
[41:47.250 --> 41:52.530]  with minimal input, you can get a pretty good harvest. If you treat them like any other strain
[41:52.530 --> 41:56.450]  and you really, really, really focus on them, you give them their nutrients when you want them
[41:56.450 --> 42:00.370]  and all that stuff and get them through their thing, you can see some, I mean, really beautiful
[42:00.370 --> 42:10.050]  plants. Speaking of phenohunts earlier, we did, I think there was 60, 60 of those Skywalker autos
[42:10.050 --> 42:15.010]  that I got from you actually. And it was pretty awesome. They were, they were, they were very
[42:15.010 --> 42:19.570]  uniform, but there was a few that stood out amongst the others. But overall, I mean, it was,
[42:19.570 --> 42:24.610]  it was awesome to see. And I think that's one thing that's held me back is not having my own
[42:24.610 --> 42:32.370]  autoflower line. I've had so many requests for it, as you know. Autos, Fems, I mean, there's a place
[42:32.370 --> 42:36.530]  for every one of them. I've been on regular seeds for a long time here, and I think I will eventually
[42:37.330 --> 42:42.050]  work my way toward the other lines, even a CBD thing. But for the most part,
[42:43.410 --> 42:47.490]  yeah, autos have earned my respect. I've got, I had a few people in the comments like, oh,
[42:47.490 --> 42:51.410]  your stuff, you just, you know, you're promoting it. It's not that great, blah, blah, blah, you
[42:51.410 --> 42:57.410]  know. But I mean, honestly, there's the, it's, they, they absolutely have a place. And if you're
[42:57.410 --> 43:02.930]  a recreational farmer, and you have the space on your property, and you can throw a few hundred,
[43:02.930 --> 43:08.050]  two thousand, whatever you want out there, and literally let them do their thing for you in a
[43:08.050 --> 43:11.250]  short period of time, I mean, I, you're losing by not running them.
[43:12.210 --> 43:18.370]  You actually get larger yields with autoflowers than traditional plants. You know, if you're
[43:18.370 --> 43:23.730]  putting 16,000 plants out per acre, and you're doing it three times a year, you're going to get
[43:23.730 --> 43:29.170]  larger yields. You know, and in the fresh frozen market, like in California, in the, in the rec
[43:29.170 --> 43:35.490]  market, you know, everything in metric like that, it's, it's a big game changer. And you know, it's
[43:35.490 --> 43:39.650]  just going to keep improving. And you know, the stuff we had before was testing it, you know,
[43:39.970 --> 43:44.370]  you know, in the 14, 15. Now I'm getting tests, some of the stuff that I've been working on,
[43:45.010 --> 43:51.010]  is testing around 25%, you know, 24 to 25. And that's outdoor. And it's not super consistent
[43:51.010 --> 43:56.450]  yet. But it's going in that direction. Rick, what are your thoughts on autoflowers? And feminine?
[43:57.490 --> 44:05.490]  Yeah, I definitely think there's a place for them both in the recreational market, like Eric said,
[44:05.490 --> 44:13.570]  but then also, you know, like you had mentioned, more of a commercial scale by acreage, because,
[44:14.850 --> 44:22.610]  you know, having those three harvests a year on a massive scale is, you know, I think,
[44:23.170 --> 44:29.330]  really appropriate for the type, those type of grows. And, you know, I think there's a lot being
[44:29.330 --> 44:36.050]  done with the quality of the autos that are available now versus what had been out there
[44:36.050 --> 44:44.130]  five, you know, five years plus ago. And, you know, the quality is there. That Skywalker
[44:44.130 --> 44:51.010]  OG back cross is fantastic. You know, the hash that comes from that is really, really amazing.
[44:51.010 --> 44:59.170]  But yeah, I'm a big fan. There's definitely room for it. And, you know, I know a lot of new growers
[44:59.490 --> 45:06.050]  are using feminized autoflowers. And it takes a step out because they're feminized, they don't
[45:06.050 --> 45:12.370]  have to do the selection. Because I know that makes a lot of new growers very nervous. Because
[45:12.370 --> 45:21.650]  they don't want seeds, they just want smokeable flower. And yeah, so I think they're excellent.
[45:21.970 --> 45:31.390]  I mean, that's just, unfortunately, no one's gonna buy 20,000 seeds to hopefully get 10,000 females
[45:32.030 --> 45:38.030]  in the additional labor, especially now with people direct sowing in the field, which I think
[45:38.030 --> 45:44.430]  that's another big labor game changer that you can do is actually, you know, putting the seed out in
[45:44.430 --> 45:49.230]  the field where you don't actually have to transplant. That's gonna be a big thing in the
[45:49.310 --> 45:52.750]  future. I think there's been people that have been successful with it. And then there's people
[45:52.750 --> 45:57.150]  that have been really unsuccessful with it. And autoflowers especially have a huge learning curve.
[45:58.510 --> 46:01.150]  So Miles, what's your take on autoflower and feminized?
[46:03.150 --> 46:10.800]  Really valuable in the right setting. I'm glad you brought up direct sowing because that's
[46:11.280 --> 46:18.240]  something I know a lot of with the hemp. And yeah, I think that with, when you start to balance the
[46:18.240 --> 46:25.360]  modern agriculture practices with the traits that we breed for as ganja growers and the autoflowers
[46:25.360 --> 46:31.360]  and the fems and these things that are more in our realm and start balancing that with modern
[46:31.360 --> 46:38.320]  ag, the direct sowing and multiple crops per season in long flowering areas,
[46:38.640 --> 46:46.080]  long flowering areas is gonna be massive. I mean, the amount of herb that would take to
[46:46.960 --> 46:54.720]  keep America happy for a while could be done at industrial scale and still in a responsive,
[46:55.360 --> 47:01.840]  ecologically responsible way that in a relatively small piece of land, cyclical farming, like you're
[47:01.840 --> 47:08.400]  saying many in one season with autos and fems. And I think the work is being done currently,
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.280]  like Mosca was just saying, they're just getting better and better, better flavors and better
[47:13.280 --> 47:19.440]  yields. I remember for a while there, it wasn't, it was like one thing or a few things. And then it
[47:19.440 --> 47:25.440]  gradually became a much bigger pool. And yeah, there's a lot of people doing it now. And I'm
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.560]  fiddling with autos. I don't have anything ready to release yet, but autofem seeds in the right
[47:30.560 --> 47:37.680]  hands all the way, I think at every scale, all the way from people in their tents, in their little
[47:37.680 --> 47:44.160]  legal rec grows or little black market closets, whatever, or all the way up to warehouses and
[47:44.160 --> 47:52.880]  fields, the applications are super versatile. And yeah, I think that the, over time, they're only
[47:52.880 --> 48:00.080]  gonna become more and more refined from the genetics and breeder side of things and accepted
[48:00.080 --> 48:06.720]  and expected at the consumer level of things. Yeah, so I think that the potential there is
[48:06.720 --> 48:14.400]  massive. They are untraditional. And I think that reg seeds will always be the traditional
[48:14.400 --> 48:22.320]  and stand the standard there. But fem regs or fem autos have huge, huge potential.
[48:22.880 --> 48:29.440]  Yeah, and I think they've gone so far. Mephisto, who's been out for quite a while now,
[48:30.080 --> 48:36.080]  before them, it was like the European stuff. I had gone to Spain one time and seen stuff at
[48:37.440 --> 48:43.760]  the Dynafem, at their grow. This is back in 2012. And they had some interesting stuff going,
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.000]  but it was stuff that I said I'd never work with autoflowers. I mean, absolutely never
[48:48.960 --> 48:53.920]  work with autoflowers after seeing that. I'd seen it in like the early 2000s. There was like some
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.760]  autoflower that smelled like hay, and it was just fucking terrible. And I said,
[48:57.760 --> 49:03.040]  I'm never gonna work with autoflowers. In 2012, I reaffirmed that. And then my friend Nick,
[49:04.480 --> 49:11.920]  he showed me autoflowers about maybe three years ago now. And that completely changed my opinion.
[49:12.080 --> 49:18.400]  Mephisto really has worked the lines and has shown people that it can be done. And so
[49:18.400 --> 49:21.600]  there's a bunch of people jumping on now doing really good autoflower work.
[49:22.560 --> 49:29.040]  But creating novel autoflower genetics takes a lot of time. And then also breeding out
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.480]  intersexual traits. That's another thing that I'd like to talk about. You guys work on breeding out
[49:34.480 --> 49:37.600]  intersexual traits. Let's start with Rick on that one.
[49:39.280 --> 49:47.200]  Well, I don't like to work with plants that are showing intersexual traits. And so right off the
[49:47.200 --> 49:55.760]  bat, we call those, you know, if there is something really special, I just don't like that in the mix
[49:55.760 --> 50:01.520]  of whatever I'm working with. So, you know, I'm probably the wrong person to ask because
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.640]  I just don't like that aspect. And we call those plants right away.
[50:07.200 --> 50:13.440]  So, I mean, cookies definitely has intersexual traits. And the thing is,
[50:13.440 --> 50:19.280]  is if you make feminized seeds, plants that have that intersexual traits or even slight
[50:19.840 --> 50:25.360]  hermaphrodism tendencies, usually stress related, I guess there's multiple types of
[50:25.360 --> 50:31.280]  intersexual traits. But the cookies, for instance, has intersexual traits. It's super easy to reverse
[50:32.480 --> 50:33.760]  what's your thought on that, Rick?
[50:35.360 --> 50:47.120]  Yeah, yeah. Good point. We have worked with cookies. And so with breeding those type of
[50:47.120 --> 50:54.640]  plants, let's say a cookie line, I did something called moonshine cookies. And I use the old time
[50:54.640 --> 51:04.480]  moonshine, which was extremely stable. I mean, I have it to like an F10, F11 now. And, you know,
[51:04.480 --> 51:14.480]  it seems like whenever I hit my male to something that does show some intersexual traits or has it
[51:14.480 --> 51:24.160]  in the line, you know, the dominant strains really kind of take over there. And so you're not seeing
[51:24.240 --> 51:34.400]  that as much and you have much more stability. And so, yeah, I mean, as a breeder and trying to
[51:34.400 --> 51:42.960]  not only work lines, but then also trying to stay on top of, you know, the trends, what's the latest
[51:42.960 --> 51:52.800]  and greatest, you know, we're constantly, you know, working with, you know, these different
[51:52.800 --> 52:01.200]  lines and cookie being one of them. But yeah, I mean, I think for us, what has been successful
[52:01.760 --> 52:08.480]  is working with more stable lines with these other lines that are not so stable.
[52:08.480 --> 52:17.280]  Eric, what's your thought on intersexual traits from Aphrodism? How do you work with it? Or do
[52:17.280 --> 52:21.600]  you work with it? You try to breed it out or you try to start with stuff that doesn't have it?
[52:23.920 --> 52:29.520]  A little bit of both. So basically my first encounter with like a known plant that we all
[52:29.520 --> 52:38.080]  kind of found to be having that issue with the cherry pie. And that takes me back to right after
[52:38.080 --> 52:43.040]  I left Cannes, I had started working with the cherry pie plant and we knew that one had some
[52:43.040 --> 52:48.320]  issues, but then you would grow it another time and it wouldn't. So you'd scratch your head and
[52:48.320 --> 52:53.120]  you go, why the fuck is this thing having issues where I've got bananas and little pollen sacks
[52:53.120 --> 52:58.240]  down below and then I'm not having them the next time. Another thing we noticed was with that same
[52:58.240 --> 53:02.480]  plant, it was mostly on the lowers. So we were cleaning that stuff up and then not seeing it
[53:02.480 --> 53:07.120]  again. So I don't know what happened there, but that was the one plant that I did work with that
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.760]  we knew had those intersection issues and went ahead and moved on. And it's kind of like working
[53:11.760 --> 53:18.000]  with some of these seeds made from hermaphrodite plant or something. Someone can say, hey, those
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.520]  are all going to be bad seeds. Then someone pops them and end up having something great come out
[53:21.520 --> 53:27.600]  of it. It's absolutely fire and has no issue at all. So in my perspective, I see that lately,
[53:29.040 --> 53:33.520]  specifically cookies, it seems like that the other polyhybrids were making stuff that's one
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.440]  offs of the cookie, the gelato, the sherbs, all this stuff that's so popular and everyone wants.
[53:38.640 --> 53:45.040]  It seems though we have this issue that pops up, but it seems like also at the same time, more
[53:46.400 --> 53:51.920]  than ever, are we seeing more and more and more of this hermaphrodite issues now? Is it
[53:53.280 --> 53:58.160]  the lighting? Is it the nutrients? Is it the kind of newbie growers? It's a little bit of
[53:58.160 --> 54:02.080]  everything in my opinion, because I've seen strains that are something I've released where,
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.000]  hey, we got herms and I'm like, whoa, that's crazy. That sucks. Just part of the testing process.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.480]  Sorry to hear that. And then other guys are like, in my garden, nothing at all. So it's kind of
[54:13.040 --> 54:16.560]  goes back and forth with, okay, so is this something to release? Is it not something to
[54:16.560 --> 54:23.680]  release? Then in my opinion, working with these strains and trying to breed out that intersexual
[54:24.880 --> 54:30.080]  feature, I don't know if I can say that I've necessarily worked toward that other than the
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.160]  fact of just knowing that if I have something stable and I haven't seen any issues with it,
[54:34.160 --> 54:39.680]  moving forward in that project has led to me seeing a lot less and hearing less and less
[54:39.680 --> 54:46.320]  issues. Whereas if I know something has that trait and I go ahead and work with it anyway,
[54:46.320 --> 54:51.760]  it's kind of like, well, you kind of knew that going into it. So polyhybrids in general,
[54:51.760 --> 54:59.280]  seems like we have almost everything in this market is starting to dominate in that aspect.
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.000]  Whereas a lot of the stuff from before seems like lost. Like we touched on earlier, the stuff
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.640]  that's popular is what's really taken over. Whereas like a classic strain that we knew
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.680]  was fine and wasn't having hermaphrodite issues is kind of forgotten about at this point. So I
[55:13.680 --> 55:17.920]  really think there needs to be a discussion and a lot more people need to figure out what's going
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.640]  on with the gardens. Is it really lighting? Is it something that we're doing? Are we trying to be
[55:22.640 --> 55:26.560]  a little too aggressive with our growing techniques? And it's bringing out that
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.680]  obviously unsatisfactory trait or what is it really leading to the issue? Is it really just
[55:31.680 --> 55:37.760]  poor breeding? But a lot of us are having the same feedback from testers and other recreational
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.360]  gardens and what have you. So. Mike Stowell
[55:41.360 --> 55:42.400]  Miles, what's your take?
[55:45.520 --> 55:48.720]  Miles O'Brien I mean, cull. And I start,
[55:48.720 --> 55:55.920]  ideally start with things that don't, start with things that don't have those traits. And cull,
[55:55.920 --> 56:02.640]  when you see them. But I think that Eric Dungeons Vault right now just touched on it,
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.400]  is that we're chasing and you, what you were talking about earlier, we're chasing these
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.520]  trendy turps that are the thing that people want and saying, oh, well, if that's what you want,
[56:11.520 --> 56:18.400]  and it comes from a cookies, the cookies traits passing on this intersex trait, you definitely
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.960]  have to just weed it out. You start, you're chasing a trait and trying to dump another one
[56:24.960 --> 56:32.800]  at the same time. It's all in the cull at that point. It's, selection is important, but really,
[56:32.800 --> 56:41.200]  it's about doing what Mosca was talking about to males, to your females, the stress test in the
[56:41.200 --> 56:47.520]  females that you know have intersex traits. And really weeding that out, literally, I mean,
[56:47.520 --> 56:54.080]  taking the culls out of the gene pool. And that's where the female hunt comes in. That's where the
[56:54.080 --> 57:01.840]  bigger net comes in. I think that the intersex stuff is just really bad news. Nobody wants it in
[57:01.840 --> 57:09.600]  ganja at all. And the only reason we're using it is chasing these trendy turps and more and more
[57:09.600 --> 57:15.920]  growers. There's so many more people growing herb now than there were 10 years ago. I mean,
[57:15.920 --> 57:23.040]  by huge magnitude, I'm sure. So we're just seeing like more seeds out there, more growers, big,
[57:23.040 --> 57:30.480]  huge social media style nets cast on the weed world that's starting to show up these traits
[57:30.480 --> 57:36.480]  in different places. And yeah, I think as a breeder, it's just our duty to cull that out.
[57:38.640 --> 57:45.360]  Nobody wants that. I kind of feel it's our duty. I think we're the ones who, as breeders,
[57:45.360 --> 57:49.360]  I'm not generalizing any of us, but just as breeders, we're the ones who bred this stuff in.
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.640]  It wasn't in all the genetics back in the day. This is stuff that we've reinforced
[57:54.640 --> 58:03.040]  through hobbyist breeding practices. These things are, they can be reinforced,
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.720]  they can be bred out. I think it's our job and our duty to breed these things out.
[58:07.920 --> 58:13.280]  Stress testing, I honestly feel stress testing is the single best way to breed them out. Stress
[58:13.280 --> 58:17.760]  testing your females, your males, your plants in general. And then there's other little things like
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.520]  for me using a plant that if you have intersexual traits and you really got to have it, you don't
[58:23.520 --> 58:29.280]  want to use it as a donor. You want to use it as a receiver. And those little things, as much as you
[58:29.280 --> 58:33.440]  want to use it for a donor, if you're trying to capture those turps, you can still capture the
[58:33.440 --> 58:40.160]  turps on the receiving end. So these are things that I think everybody should be aware of, all
[58:40.160 --> 58:45.280]  the hobbyist breeders, because they're just as much contributing, the people that get those
[58:45.280 --> 58:49.680]  unicorns. And unfortunately, a lot of those unicorns out there have those intersexual traits.
[58:51.680 --> 58:58.800]  So let's go on to breeding F1 hybrids. Do you guys use different donors, multiple donors?
[58:59.360 --> 59:05.360]  Why and how many? We'll start with Eric. If you're breeding F1s, do you use like from the same,
[59:05.360 --> 59:11.120]  if you're doing regular seeds, are you using one donor to make those F1s? Or do you use multiples?
[59:11.120 --> 59:21.200]  I use multiples for genetic diversity. I have done both ways. So for instance, I did,
[59:22.400 --> 59:28.080]  I did on one breed, I did a brandywine, my brandywine line, that was what it was.
[59:28.080 --> 59:33.120]  It was two different males for that one. And it was actually surprisingly,
[59:34.960 --> 59:40.240]  you know, fairly similar stuff I saw across the board. I mean, a lot of the people were
[59:41.680 --> 59:45.200]  you know, showing me real similar traits that I was expecting to find on.
[59:46.480 --> 59:51.680]  It was really cool to see. But normally, I would just have the one, the one male,
[59:51.680 --> 59:56.080]  once I found something I was happy with, I would just use him and use him till I was done. Like I
[59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.120]  mentioned earlier, the purple gelato crosses, those were all came from one male that I found.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:06.080]  I had multiple males at first. But I chose not to do it this time. I just wanted to kind of
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.120]  know what we have going on what we literally just discussed, I kind of wanted to try and,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:20.800]  you know, close down any, any more options that could have been led to the, you know,
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.000]  issues at hand with having the hermaphrodite. So I basically was just like, you know, I'm just
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.720]  gonna stick with one male, see how he works out, see how the testing goes and go from there.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.920]  And so far, so good. Again, it kind of it's it's back and forth with, you know, I hear a lot of
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.520]  good feedback. And then a couple a couple people here and there having issues with some stuff. But
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:48.160]  for the most part, everything that gets released to market is all been satisfactory. And I hear
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:57.360]  your very little complaints or at all really about that that issue at hand. So yeah, I think I think
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.160]  depending on where you're trying to go, maybe if you're trying to go, if diversity was the case,
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.320]  like you mentioned, then yeah, I would say using a couple different males would be good option. I
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.680]  mean, broaden the horizon as far as what you can find and what you're what you're looking for,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.080]  especially if you know, hunting is the goal. And if you have the space, and you're ready to take on
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.560]  that task, then yeah, why not have as many possible options as you can, because then you can really
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.440]  look for that traits you're after and then go from there. I think I think that's that's great. So
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.480]  Rick, what's your take?
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:41.120]  You know, my focus tends to be much more narrow. I typically will use one single male
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:56.080]  and try to get to a certain type of plant that I'm looking to, to, to make, whether it's, you know,
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:06.640]  frostiness, or if it's aromas, you know, like raspberry boogie. So I don't do multiple males,
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:16.000]  because if once I test the offspring, then I know which male I selected is correct. If I use
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.840]  multiples, I don't know what that is. And then, you know, it's back to the drawing board. So for me,
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:30.720]  I'm just I like to be more focused. And that's just my approach. Because when I release something,
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:38.160]  you know, I like to say there's a keeper in every pack. And so with really vetting the males and
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:48.480]  females that I select to breed with, that's where I'll find, you know, my offspring are best.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.560]  I think we lost audio.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:02.840]  We there?
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:05.880]  What's your take?
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:17.880]  Yeah, man, I prefer one usually. Usually it's just one male that I've already flowered out to see
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:24.440]  what's what his traits are. You know, the pollen sac stacking, the time frame, all that.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:32.200]  In the case that I do multiple males, it's usually ones that have a lot of similarities,
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:41.560]  you know, like similar traits. There are certain instances, of course, where I'll use a broad
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:47.720]  spectrum of males, just on reproductions, where I just I know the work line, I'm very familiar with
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:55.640]  it. And I'll just say, okay, multiple males. But for the most part, 90% of what I do is usually
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:04.520]  one male. Getting into bulk breeding and larger quantities, multiple males helps a lot.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.840]  Oftentimes, they're the same, you know, clone of the same male, but you're not, you're not
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:21.400]  gaining or losing anything there. I don't feel like if it's the, the medical males. So it's just
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.960]  about infrastructure and space to fill to get everything that needs to be gotten.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.440]  You know, spread the pollen wide enough.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:36.520]  Right? Yeah, I feel like male, male pollen from regular plants travels a lot faster.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:43.000]  You get a lot more male pollen than you do on feminized seeds. But as far as for genetic
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.880]  diversity, what I like about it is I can take 50 males and I can narrow it down to three that
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:53.800]  represent different parts of a polyhybrid. The sage and sour, for example, had stuff that was
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:05:02.040]  definitely leaning sage more of that, you know, the hazy stuff from the, the haze in it. And then
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:07.080]  it had stuff that was soury that had like that sour structure. And then it had some that was like
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.000]  OG where it was stout. And that stuff is definitely a polyhybrid that has all of those male traits in
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.640]  it. And so I selected three different males to incorporate in the room. So there was genetic
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:22.680]  diversity. And I don't always do it, but I feel like if you're looking for genetic diversity,
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.600]  it's a great way to go, especially if you're looking for different stuff and you've tested
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:32.840]  the males out. So do you guys store pollen? How do you guys store it? If you store it?
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.960]  Rick, why don't we start with you on that one?
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:43.880]  Yeah, I do store pollen. And in fact, a couple of things they do a little bit different. So
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:52.760]  my seeds, I do store in paper envelopes as well as my pollen. And I generally will keep them,
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:06:01.960]  the pollen in a jar that's loosely open in a bed of rice. So the actual envelope
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:09.960]  is in the bed of rice. So there's no moisture that collects onto the pollen. I've seen,
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:18.040]  I've had pollen that has grown mold. It just, I just don't like, want to keep it as dry as possible.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:27.480]  And I use rice as a desiccant. And yeah, so for example, I did a reversal of my raspberry boogie
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:39.080]  and I'm about to take down the reverse female. I will collect all that pollen, I'll crush it up.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:46.840]  And so it loosens the grains of pollen, because as you know, with when you do feminized reversals,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:54.200]  you have to work harder to extract the pollen grains that are there. And so by crushing it
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:00.600]  with a pestle and mortar really helps to loosen it. And so it is available when I need it.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:07.800]  But I generally will keep on the refrigerator 50 to 55 degrees along with seeds,
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.840]  but I keep everything separated in paper envelopes, like I said.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.840]  Miles. Miles, what's your take on that?
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.480]  Store pollen?
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.680]  Yeah, I definitely store pollen. It isn't something that I used to do.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:33.080]  I used to just always just throw a male in the room and make him do his thing. And keep a copy
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:42.120]  if I wanted the pollen back. Now, I definitely keep pollen. I definitely keep it on hand in a
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:48.600]  similar way that Moskva was describing in rice. And I've had pretty good success with it.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:55.800]  But not as long term as I would like, usually around six to nine months, I try to use it.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.320]  I do believe that there's ways to keep it longer. I don't really depend on it. Like,
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:11.000]  I do keep it, but I also keep the copies of the males as best I can. But there's not a whole lot
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.680]  of that. I get asked for pollen from people and I like to have it for hobbyists and whatnot. So
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:23.960]  people can just experiment and experience that. But yeah, it doesn't play a big role in what I do,
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.360]  even though I do store it. It's just it's something that I wanted to do and have on hand.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.760]  And just became necessary in some cases. But yeah, I store pollen.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:41.640]  Yeah, I think it's a great redundancy, personally. There's times, especially making
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:47.800]  feminized seeds, where it doesn't reverse right or there's issues and there's nothing better than
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.360]  having a big jar of pollen on hand that can save the day. What's your take, Eric?
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.600]  Well, I'm actually reading through the comments right now. It's funny, as you guys were talking,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.640]  I'm listening to you and I'm also reading through seeing some interesting stuff.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.600]  And some guy mentioned, I don't know if you said it twice, but he wanted to know,
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.160]  is there a best time to collect pollen from the time the very first sack show to,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:24.720]  let's say, as the male matures to the end? In my opinion, I'd say that a male plant is a male
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.920]  plant. That's like saying your dad could get your mom pregnant at this stage in life and then it's
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.920]  going to be some completely different breed later on. No, it should be the same breed from the
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.160]  beginning to the end. I would wait until the plant is fully mature to offer me as much pollen as
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.840]  possible. But yeah, I don't think there's any difference. Maybe I'm wrong on that. You guys
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:49.200]  want to fill them in on that. That's fine. But as far as I go, I used to collect a little bit of
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:56.320]  pollen, but I had a fridge go out and that was no bueno. And then I also just had forgotten about
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.400]  pollen. And like I said, I've been cloning, I was cloning my males for a long time there. So I was
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.920]  keeping it around and I didn't really have a reason to store pollen if I was already going to
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.400]  use it. So I had done the, I guess, collecting the pollen from a male and then pulling it out
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.080]  within a very, very short period of time and use it immediately. And that was great. But I also,
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.840]  just in case anything happens, whether it be something stupid in the fridge happens, or if I
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.960]  just was to, I don't know, anyone maybe throw it away or whatever. I just always keep my, I just
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.440]  always kept my male around just in case. So another person mentioned they crushed their
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.080]  little pollen sack all together and with the pollen in a jar. That's interesting. I haven't
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.880]  heard of that. I usually keep all the green stuff separated. So it's, if I was going to sift through
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.400]  my pollen and try and store it, it would be something where I was collecting as much pollen
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.560]  as I could. And that's strictly the yellow pollen that falls and keep anything green. That's the
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.680]  little bananas that hang, that drop the pollen, any sort of plant material, keep it separate 100%,
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.480]  because I feel like that could add some sort of moisture or possibly mold it out or just make it
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.640]  unviable. But to each their own, I suppose, if you want to try it and it works for you, good.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.640]  I also have heard many people saying that if they're going to store it, they put it in some
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.400]  sort of flour. And I think that's the best way to go. It makes the little bit of pollen you do
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  save or if that's a mass amount, you can really make it spread a hell of a lot more by having it
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.360]  mixed with a certain flour. I don't remember what it was. Was it a rice flour or something else?
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.840]  But I'm sure you guys know exactly what I'm talking about. So that's my take on it. I've
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.120]  always just kept a mail around and used it and then done it like that. So.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.240]  Yeah. So I got some pollen right here for you guys.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.400]  Oh, okay. It looks like there's more. I thought it was a whole jar full at first.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:55.360]  Yeah. I mean, I do. But yeah, there's so many different ways to apply pollen. But
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.720]  a good question for you guys. Someone in the audience was asking the difference between
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.800]  herm pollen and regular pollen. Well, the plants, when you're reversing plants,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.280]  I wouldn't call it herm because what we're doing is we're using an ethylene blocker
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.440]  to create feminized seeds as opposed to stress factors or other things. It's a very different
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:24.000]  process. It's similar but different. So and someone said oily. I think pollen is based on
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.960]  the plant. It's one of those things. And the next question for you guys would be with regular
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:37.040]  non-femme breeding. How do you go about matching up windows for different flowering times? Like
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:42.800]  for instance, like a longer flowering, like a 12 week as opposed to an eight week receiver,
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.800]  like a donor that's a, you guys have ways of doing that. We'll start with Miles.
[01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:58.050]  Yeah, man, that's always an issue with lining things up and hitting the window properly. So
[01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:05.730]  I think having copies of the mail and like being ready with backups to run. If he if the first
[01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:11.090]  misses the target, or if you know if you're female already, you'd say, oh, it's not time.
[01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:20.210]  I think that it's key. I usually a lot of the times I'll let my females get a little bit of
[01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:25.570]  a head start. But that's in the case of what I'm doing. You know, like in your example,
[01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:30.850]  with longer flowering, you have to give them a longer start. But with a longer flowering male,
[01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:37.330]  you have to give him a head start. It's just, I think I think the like smart ass answer to that
[01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:46.130]  would be practice. And the more in depth answer would be keeping male copies. And knowing the,
[01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:50.290]  the traits and the flowering times of both your male and female really well before
[01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:57.010]  throwing pollen on them, because, you know, you can miss your window. And there end up with no
[01:13:57.010 --> 01:14:04.530]  seeds or very few in one way or another. So I think it's practice. I think that just like
[01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:10.130]  storing pollen, a lot of for me, a lot of these things happened with clients that I had in other
[01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:15.090]  grows. And, you know, whether it be warehouses or greenhouses and whatnot, like, a lot of this stuff
[01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:22.850]  was it was very simple. And it still is very simple for me is keeping my thing, my space with
[01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:30.690]  with what I have. And, you know, it's just easy to stay in control that way. When you don't have
[01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:36.290]  control, it's somebody else's world that you step into. And you're just like, well, the better source
[01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:40.850]  of pollen in this case, isn't going to be, you know, you have to be able to do that and know that,
[01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:46.770]  you know, so can't suggest something you have no clue about. So that's kind of where a lot of these
[01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:54.290]  practices we're talking about it now, came into my world from was consulting outside of my own grow.
[01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:59.330]  And that was that's been a great, it's been a good learning experience and great
[01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:05.730]  to see different business models and different people's angles. But at the same time, it's always
[01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:13.090]  been I try to keep things as simple as I can for me, and keeping copies and, you know, the multiple
[01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:19.330]  males does work for that. And copies of males and the same and males with similar traits, like I was
[01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:26.930]  saying before, that really does play into it. So Eric, when you do you work with any longer
[01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:32.610]  flowering varieties or cultivars that are longer flowering either on the donor or the receiver side
[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:42.360]  when you're breeding? And if so, how do you line the windows up? So the probably the longest
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.440]  flowering strain ever worked was that was that what's referred to it? Well, I mean, now there's
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.760]  a bunch of controversy around it, but the East Coast sour diesel or the Chaco cut,
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.680]  whatever, whether it's that whether they I mean, there's just arguments over whether that's a real
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.480]  sour D or which one was the original what happy but in my opinion, it was still a great cut.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:07.880]  That one went if you actually grew it the right way. That one was anywhere from an 11 week to,
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.440]  you know, going on the 12 week strain like you mentioned, so that and the same with the chem four,
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.240]  a lot of people were cutting the chem four, or even GMO, a lot of people cutting GMO and
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.560]  on these strains at nine weeks, because just to fit their schedule, but if you're growing it to
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.160]  maturity where it's supposed to be, then that 11 to 12 week mark is where you need to be.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.760]  I don't, I have very rarely worked with many of those strains. And it's not because I don't have
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:37.000]  the time. It was just because what I had access to what I was willing to work with the flavors I was
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.800]  chasing, market demand, all that goes, you know, hand in hand, but if it were up to me,
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.440]  I'd be growing a hell of a lot more of the 12 week varieties and then and then I'd be able to
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:56.360]  have a better answer for you. But if just to go off of what I did do with these co sour diesel cross,
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.000]  I hit that one at the same time as I did all my other strains, I let them get to right around that
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:09.880]  almost right around the week three mark before they got their pollen. And they they all seem to
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.680]  take very well. I didn't have any. I don't remember there being any issues as far as mature seeds in
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.760]  more than the other ones. They were all pretty much at the toward the end. You know, obviously
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.600]  harvesting and run a little bit longer than the other plants but to get those full maturity. But
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.800]  other than that, I hadn't I hadn't really thought about that. To be honest with you,
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.880]  when I first did I just said, you know what, this thing's going in at this time and I'm going to let
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.480]  them get to this age before I pollinate and it did its thing and it worked out but I would I
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:45.000]  definitely need to add more of those longer flower sativas into my into my line because I'm lacking.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.520]  I've got more of the indica dominant varieties and that's all good. But I need more diversity myself.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:58.760]  So Rick, I know you know a lot about pollen windows and stuff like that. We've talked about
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.880]  that before on the phone. What's what's your take on what we're talking about?
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:15.080]  You know, I think with longer flower varieties, you know, I follow the same practice whether a plant
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:26.280]  is like a nine week or an 11 week flowering plant. And the reason I do that is I tend my
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:36.040]  practice is I keep the males in the room or the reverse females in the room for a longer duration.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040]  I know a lot of breeders will keep them in there for a few weeks and then remove the males.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:51.000]  I tend to over pollinate and so I work my males or reverse females much harder. And so I keep them
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  thriving and doing well and over pollinate to make sure that we maximize the seed numbers on
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.960]  the females in the room. And so back to that question that Jason asked about the seed numbers
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:17.320]  that Jason had. Is there a difference in the fertility of pollen in the beginning versus
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:23.400]  the middle or the end? Yeah, there is a difference. I think there's less fertile
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:33.160]  pollen in the beginning. And as the plant matures and starts producing much more male pollen sacs,
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.600]  then you are going to have much more mature and fertile pollen at that point.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:52.600]  Yeah, I agree to a certain point. I'm not sure if it's less viable. I mean,
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:20:00.600]  pollen to me is pollen. I'd love to see some studies on that. And I feel like there's a couple
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.760]  of interesting things we can point out right now. Like my window, I usually pollinated week three
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:12.840]  and a half on a typical nine week. And so if you're going to, you want to line that up to the
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:18.920]  male, if you're looking at a male when the peak amount of pollen, I definitely have as a redundancy
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.960]  saved pollen, but I will try to hit that window and line that up perfectly. So the maximum amount
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:30.440]  of pollen coming from your donor or male is lined up with that week three and a half roughly.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.560]  I feel like you get more, if I can do the pollinating window where I keep the donors
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.920]  separate from the receivers and then incorporate them into the room,
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:45.400]  I feel like I get more of an even pollination. I also do things like I take my plants,
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.880]  my receivers after they've been pollinated, if they're a nine weeker, I let them go an extra 30
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:57.800]  days. I feel like you can get anywhere from 25 to 40% more seeds by letting them finish.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:06.360]  And what's your take on that, Miles, about letting your plants go longer? Do you typically
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:16.800]  let your plants go longer on your seed runs? Oh, for sure. For sure. And I, yeah, I like to,
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.520]  like you're saying, you get more seeds. So that's a bonus. I think that you have to give different,
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:30.320]  I give different nutrition to mature those seeds properly that I wouldn't normally do for a crop of
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:36.800]  herb. And I mean, I think that a properly done seed run, like you're, if you're talking week
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:43.200]  three, I like to give 45 days after pollination at least to get full seed set. So, you know,
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:47.600]  you're definitely looking at just over your nine weeks there. I mean, I'm shooting for,
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:55.600]  on a nine week strain, I'm planning 11, just to give the space and time. I mean, like the plants
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.720]  that finish in the room, by the time they're finished, don't look like amazing. They're
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.880]  done plants. They're done, done, like entered and passed through senescence and the seeds really do
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.480]  mature differently and darken up on the plant properly. And I think that in addition to all
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:25.360]  that curing and long-term airing, air drying, these guys, the traits, the seeds, shelf life,
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:32.880]  on survivability of the seeds, you know, obviously pressed seeds pop quick and well,
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:41.600]  but a long-term storage plan is a well matured and well cured seed stock, air dried and all that. So
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:48.160]  yeah, expecting longer, expecting more nutrition and different nutrition needs.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.240]  That's something I always do with seed stocks and seed crops.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:06.770]  Eric, what's your take on going longer? How about even nutrition? You want to talk about
[01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:13.250]  your plant nutrition when you're doing a seed run as opposed to if you're just growing flower?
[01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:18.210]  Well, only solely based on Instagram pictures, I think I've tried to keep the plants as best
[01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:25.970]  looking as possible. Guilty as charged. I literally, I think I've treated each pollination
[01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:33.250]  as if I was growing a non-seeded crop. So they all get hit with nutrients every day or, you know,
[01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:38.770]  like I normally would, you know, and then, you know, treated like any other grow.
[01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:45.730]  You know, treated like any other grow. Letting them finish, absolutely. I've made the mistake
[01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:51.250]  where I was, I don't know what I was thinking, but I was a week behind in my calculation.
[01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:59.250]  So when I harvested these seeds, there was a lot more, not necessarily premature, but a lot more
[01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:04.610]  gray seed than I'd like to see darker. I think we'd all like to see a really hard, dark,
[01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:10.050]  brown, tiger type seed, but some people need to realize that, I mean, things brush right off in
[01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:15.970]  some cases. If they get worked around a lot, they can, the outer casing will just come right off
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:20.770]  and they'll still be a gray seed. But as far as maturity goes on a plant, you can clearly see
[01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:25.650]  when you just take a little sample nug and you pop a couple of beans out, how mature it's looking.
[01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:30.690]  Does it look like it's marketable? Does it have that look? Is it fully mature? That's what we're
[01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:38.050]  going for. And I think if, yeah, letting your plant fully mature and despite what it looks like
[01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:41.890]  in the end, regardless, it's going to do, I mean, if you're going two weeks past harvest point, I
[01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:47.970]  think we can all agree that it starts to look a bit funny. But that's the, the gold is on the
[01:24:47.970 --> 01:24:52.850]  inside and that's what we're going for. So if you can, you can get those darkened up by letting them
[01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:57.490]  run a little bit longer than by all means, I would say that's, that's the way to go. I have kind of
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:02.610]  stuck around this, right around that nine to 10 week mark on every pollination I've ever done.
[01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:06.290]  It seems like that's always worked out for me. But again, like I said, I was off by a week the
[01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:13.010]  one time and that really screwed me. So. Yeah, I literally go 30 days over and I have a great
[01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:19.890]  example because I just cut this plant today. Look at this. This looks like a beat up plant.
[01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:25.090]  You know, I mean, I've pulled the fan leaves off it, obviously. But you know, if you look at the
[01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:29.650]  mature seeds, I can, I can break some off. I don't know how well the camera is going to show it.
[01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:35.730]  But yeah, this is an auto flower as well. But this went, you know, this is 100 days of flower
[01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:42.610]  from germination. It's over 100 days. This variety should have been done at day 70.
[01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:49.170]  You know, and I do these in my yard, these small plants. I feed it additional nitrogen throughout.
[01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:55.410]  Somebody asked a question about make up again. This is great for pollen.
[01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:00.930]  You can add rice to your pollen. You can, you know, it basically is a
[01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:05.970]  an easy way to apply pollen if you're trying to apply it to plants. If you're
[01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:10.210]  not just trying to pollinate a piece, but trying to hit all the calyx.
[01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:18.450]  So yeah, and then, Rick, what about plant nutrition for you? What's your take on
[01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:23.330]  plant nutrition for seed runs and how you go with maturing your plants?
[01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:37.010]  Yes, I definitely give it extra time and more nutrition throughout the whole flowering cycle,
[01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:46.370]  because you're taxing the plant by having it pollinate and creating seeds. And so my take is
[01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:53.810]  that, you know, the female is going to require more nutrition to support that additional burden
[01:26:53.810 --> 01:27:00.930]  or the growth that it's going through. And so it's like additional stress, but in a good way.
[01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:11.650]  And so, for example, like I have some that are finishing up pollination, flowering,
[01:27:12.210 --> 01:27:21.650]  they're going an extra two weeks. And I will do the same thing by taking off a bud and looking at
[01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:30.130]  the seeds. Are they darkened up? You know, are the calyxes open? Are the dark seeds showing through?
[01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:39.250]  So, you know, I go through and I'll randomly also pick out seeds that are inside the nugs,
[01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:47.250]  because not all of the seeds will be protruding or popping out. There's a lot of them that are
[01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:53.330]  buried in from the earlier pollination. And so I'll go through and I'll pick out some
[01:27:54.770 --> 01:28:00.530]  and see how dark they are. How are they drying out? I'll keep them in separate containers and
[01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:08.530]  look at them over time and seeing how they're developing. Are they darkening up? And, you know,
[01:28:08.530 --> 01:28:17.650]  if they are, you know, viable in where I want them to be. So, yeah, so I do do additional
[01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:24.530]  nutrition for the increase taxation, the growth of the female plant, but then also
[01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:28.130]  go at least an extra two weeks in the flowering cycle.
[01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:36.050]  Awesome. How do you guys apply? We'll start with Eric. You know, that was the question with me was
[01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:40.690]  someone want to see the makeup gun for applying pollen? How do you? I use a paintbrush a lot of
[01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:48.130]  times if I'm doing branches. If I'm doing rooms and I'm applying pollen from another plant,
[01:28:48.130 --> 01:28:52.050]  I'll shake them over the top. I mean, you just intermingle the plants and they'll take. But
[01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:59.170]  what's your approach, Eric? Exactly what you just said. I mean, I mentioned earlier about how I have
[01:28:59.170 --> 01:29:03.730]  a plant in the room. It'll be off in the corner. I mean, it's under a light, technically, but just
[01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:08.450]  not in necessarily like the bed with the other plants. So it'll be off to the side when I'm
[01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:12.290]  ready. And that thing is, you know, you give it a little tap and you can just see the pollen start
[01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:16.610]  to fall. That guy, I will lift it up. And like if you've ever been to a Catholic church, that guy's
[01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:22.370]  flinging holy water on you as he walks down the aisle. So I'm just like, and it's all getting,
[01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:26.290]  I mean, it'll choke you out. I mean, what you guys have all experienced is to, I mean, if you're in
[01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:30.450]  there, you don't have a face mask on. Some of those plants have so much pollen coming off that if
[01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:34.690]  you're allergic at all, or you have any issues, I mean, that shit is, it gets everywhere. So
[01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:42.210]  it's crazy. I mean, it just gets, it's thrown everywhere. I go around, make sure every plant
[01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:46.610]  top has it covered. I used to do the paintbrush technique. I'd walk around and do a little
[01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:49.970]  painting here and there. And I was like, why am I doing this? If I'm looking for seeds, then just
[01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:55.170]  like Mosca said, we're looking for max pollination. We want the most seeds as possible. So if I'm
[01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:58.370]  going around with a paintbrush, you can be efficient. You're going to get a ton of seeds
[01:29:58.370 --> 01:30:03.570]  because I have before. But if I have a male plant that is just busting off and he's dropping pollen,
[01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:11.170]  like I mentioned earlier, then I can assure there's not one single plant in there that's
[01:30:11.170 --> 01:30:18.050]  not getting doused. Yeah. I mean, with the paintbrush, I apply using a paintbrush if I'm
[01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:22.530]  pollinating a branch. If I'm going to someone else's room, they won't let me have the clone
[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:27.250]  because it's special, but they'll let me come in and pollinate it. I use a paintbrush. I think it's
[01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:36.690]  pretty air free. You're wasting the least amount of pollen. Rick, I guess, what's your take on that?
[01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:46.450]  So, yeah, like Eric said, if I'm making regular seeds, yeah, I'll let that male get in there and
[01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:53.090]  I'll whack it with a bamboo stick and get that pollen flying everywhere. It's really,
[01:30:53.090 --> 01:31:01.170]  really getting down. But then if it's feminized, what I do is I will actually go in and extract
[01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:10.770]  the the pollen sacs off the reverse female and I'll collect them in a bowl. I will let them dry
[01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:19.570]  out for at least three or four days. So everything is dry. Then I crush those seeds,
[01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:28.770]  excuse me, the pollen sacks with a pestle and mortar. And then there's no mold. Everything's
[01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:39.010]  dried out. Then I'm able to apply it to the female plants. And so, yeah, that's how I do it.
[01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:46.530]  Randomly, I'll do a paintbrush, you know, I'll scatter in the room over the plants and many
[01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:53.250]  different ways, just depending on the type of fertilization I'm doing. Another technique that
[01:31:53.250 --> 01:32:03.330]  I use if I'm doing one plant with multiple pollen donors is I will put pollen inside one of the
[01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:10.850]  like a French bread or baguette bag with a clear panel. I think I got this from Rob Clark years
[01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:20.130]  ago. And I'll tie it around the base of the branch and I'll shake it around and I'll leave
[01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:26.770]  it in there for a couple of days in the room. And then I'll remove the paper bag, have it labeled
[01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:32.210]  so I know what the cross is. And I'll do that on multiple branches on the same plant.
[01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:39.170]  Nice. Yeah, I've seen a similar technique with the paper where you actually put the pollen at
[01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:43.730]  the top of the paper bag and you pinch it in there. And then you take the bottom and I had
[01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:47.650]  a friend that did canned air at the bottom. He'd release it and shoot the canned air up and
[01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:55.010]  shake it. You have all kinds of weird stuff. Miles, what do you think?
[01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:56.210]  What do you think?
[01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:04.690]  I mean, obviously I prefer just the male in the room like we've been saying, like shaking it. And
[01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:12.290]  to spread it around in like bigger spaces, I've taken entire branches off like where there's a
[01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:16.690]  big enough male I can take like a bottom or side branch off and actually carry it around the room
[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:22.130]  at a peak time to zones that, you know, and say we've put the male here and before we spread him
[01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:28.850]  around, we'll take this one branch and do him on this other section. And another cool trick that
[01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:34.690]  we've, I've used is where a male is like about to go, you can cut him off and put him in a glass
[01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:42.050]  of water or something and hang it over and collect some pollen like separate, you know. So I've took
[01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:48.450]  branches that are, you know, a week away or so from dropping pollen, cut it off, put it in a
[01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:54.210]  glass of water or something and hang them over a piece of parchment or something to collect.
[01:33:55.410 --> 01:34:00.850]  And he'll drop just like a flower will open. He'll drop and the pollen will be viable nine
[01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:05.170]  times out of ten. I've always had it been be successful as long as the males are healthy and
[01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:10.370]  all that. So that's been helpful with taking, you know, instead of waiting to collect pollens,
[01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:15.810]  like here, take a cut, like take a cut over there. You got things ready. We got things ready in
[01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:21.250]  another location. It's a, there's a lot of versatility to the plant. It's extremely hardy
[01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:26.690]  like that as a softwood cutting. And I think that, you know, it's just like having different
[01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:31.570]  tricks in the bag, you know, like collecting pollen, spreading it around properly, making sure
[01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:37.890]  that, I love the mortar and pestle thing. I know I've done similarly, but not as systematic as
[01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:43.330]  Mosca described. I've totally done that with, with female pollen where you're just like, get out,
[01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:47.330]  like open up, do, I know you're in there, you crumble one and it just gets all over.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:52.930]  So that's a great technique for dry. Like you have to dry it out first. Cause if you
[01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:59.810]  mash it fresh, it's going to, yeah. If you mash it fresh, it's done. So you dry it out. That's a
[01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:04.530]  great technique. And I'd never thought of that and like totally could have used that technique
[01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:10.290]  in the past. And it's, that's vital. That kind of advice is, you know, like give thanks for the
[01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:14.690]  platform and for the sharing vibes like that. Cause that's, that's what we're here to do is
[01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:20.210]  like spread, spread the seeds, spread the knowledge, spread the genetics, like share our knowledge and
[01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:24.290]  experience here. So give thanks for that. That was, that's an awesome trick. Like, and I hadn't,
[01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:27.410]  I didn't know if I fully understood the first time you said either, but it was like,
[01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:31.730]  when you really described it, I'm like, oh yeah. Femmes like pulling that pollen out. That's a
[01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:37.730]  pain. Like sometimes you're just like, drop, drop, like the game is on, it's time to go.
[01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:41.330]  And they're just, yeah, you got to take it into your own hands.
[01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:44.210]  I love that.
[01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:45.250]  Literally.
[01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:46.050]  Yes.
[01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:52.290]  So I'm going to ask the million dollar question that gets asked to all breeders on all the shows.
[01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:55.810]  How do you guys select your males? We'll start with Eric on this one.
[01:35:58.530 --> 01:36:02.690]  Or start, you know, donors, males, I guess donors for Femmes, but yeah.
[01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.290]  What's your, what's your approach, Eric?
[01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:17.470]  There we go. So basically any male that I've selected, it had already been grown out. So we'd
[01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:24.830]  grown it out. We checked it out. We saw what it had to produce. I have admittedly done a blind
[01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:30.430]  run before. I just let a male pollinate without having run it before and just kind of crossed my
[01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:33.950]  fingers and hope for the best and it worked out, but that's not the way to do it. You got to,
[01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:38.190]  you got to see what your male has to offer. So by, by growing it out, letting us see what it has to
[01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:41.950]  throw intersex traits, because that's another thing some people don't realize is a male can be
[01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:46.430]  a hermaphrodite too. So if you have a hermaphrodite male, the same goes, as we were discussing
[01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:50.190]  earlier, if you have a female that's throwing those traits, then, you know, it can possibly
[01:36:50.190 --> 01:36:53.630]  show up in the offspring. The same goes for the male. If you're using a male that's got those
[01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:57.310]  traits and you're kind of screwing yourself again. So something to look out for. And you
[01:36:57.310 --> 01:37:03.150]  wouldn't know that unless you flowered out your strain. So for me anyway, I'd say like anything
[01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:06.190]  else, when you're looking for a male, you're looking for a male that's got a lot of traits.
[01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:09.870]  I'd say like anything else, when you're looking for a good plant, you know, it's, it's,
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:13.470]  I don't go off the stem rub right. You know, I hear a lot of people talk about stem rub. That's
[01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:18.190]  something that you can notice, but there's a lot of plants I've seen have a great stem rub,
[01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:21.550]  but turned out to be shit. You know what I mean? That doesn't, that doesn't tell me anything. I
[01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:27.230]  think all plants stems have a smell. There's a certain kind of smell they release, but I really
[01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:33.870]  like to see stacked male flowers. I like to see some, some girth to it, you know, a nice, a nice
[01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:38.590]  thick flower that looks like, I mean, the grandpa's breath male that I selected that started
[01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:44.030]  the whole thing with DBG, when that guy got flowered out, it literally reminded me of staring
[01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:48.510]  at corn on the cob. Like some of these breeders that show their males and they have, they have
[01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:53.710]  really thick flowers. It's impressive to see because normally you're looking at a plant,
[01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:59.230]  you know, it's a bud, but this looks like a single stalk, like a, you know, like a piece of corn on
[01:37:59.230 --> 01:38:03.230]  the stalk, you know, and that's cool. But that also doesn't necessarily mean that you're going
[01:38:03.230 --> 01:38:07.070]  to have the absolute best male. That's, I mean, that could be, if you're looking for weight and
[01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:12.430]  that could be the thing. So I think it's kind of like all around, there's certain smells that
[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:17.390]  you're looking for toward the end. Does it have, I've seen some trichome production that had me
[01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:22.430]  turned on, you know, and I was like, wow, that's interesting. And then, I mean, it really, it's
[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:28.190]  kind of like, I mean, you, I don't want to say there's like intuition with it, but you kind of
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:33.310]  just know, I mean, you just like, you just know like that one's bad-ass and, and, and I've, I've
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:39.710]  done well with that. But I mean, yeah, the last male I selected, it was based on, on, you know,
[01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:46.430]  how it produced the, the node structure. Cause I always am trying to find that. I like, I prefer a
[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:51.790]  more shorter stacked node. But in some cases we're looking for more of a stretchy one, cause that
[01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:57.230]  could lead to higher yields too. So it's kind of goes hand in hand, but in me anyway, it was,
[01:38:57.950 --> 01:39:04.190]  it was the multitude of the, the, the thickness of the male flowers, the little bit of trichome
[01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:10.590]  production I saw and overall just seemed like it finished fast. So it looked like a great donor and
[01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:16.750]  it turned out to be a blessing. So yeah. Rick, what's your take on selecting a male?
[01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:26.190]  So like I had mentioned previously before, you know, kind of doing some stress tests on males,
[01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:37.070]  see which ones are worth growing out and seeing what's the structure like, what is the flower
[01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:45.950]  production like, is there a trichome production? Because I have seen some that, that throw some
[01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:52.030]  just wonderful trichomes at near the end of their flowering cycle, which is very exciting to see
[01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:57.070]  because you know, they're going to pass those traits along too. But then, you know, like Eric
[01:39:57.070 --> 01:40:06.670]  said, there's that intuition or that more artistic side to selection. And then ultimately, you know,
[01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:13.470]  growing out the offspring from these males on test crosses, I think that's really, really a valuable
[01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:22.910]  aspect of breeding is testing off the offspring. You know, what are they like? Are they finishing?
[01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:29.470]  Are they kind of the, the, the designated target that you were looking for?
[01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:39.230]  Is, you know, what's the variation like? Are they, you know, expressing what you were breeding for?
[01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:48.030]  So, you know, all the above, but definitely there is artistic side to it. And then just
[01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:56.110]  mentioned one thing that Eric spoke about, the hermit traits on the male side. I have seen this,
[01:40:56.110 --> 01:41:03.150]  and those are called reverse herms. And they tend to produce more females in their offspring.
[01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:10.110]  And with some that I've grown out, I really haven't seen that expression of the hermit
[01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:17.070]  trait other than more females. And this is something that I've talked to Shane and Odie about.
[01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:27.230]  And Shane was the one who really suggested or said, yeah, that's a reverse hermy. And their
[01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:35.390]  offspring will be the same or more females. And I also asked Rob Clark about that at Emerald Cup
[01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:43.870]  a few years back. And he says, yeah, he says more, more females, but haven't gone really past
[01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:49.310]  a lot of testing other than that, any releases. So.
[01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:54.590]  Miles, what's the selection process?
[01:41:56.270 --> 01:42:03.070]  Well, I think one thing we've all described, but haven't said is like just female hunting the male.
[01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:10.190]  I mean, the male is a female hunt in itself. And on top of that, knowing the line that the male,
[01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:16.510]  like the females that the male trait stock came from, knowing those traits is what you're going
[01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:24.510]  to pass on. The females from the male line are somewhat representative of that line. I mean,
[01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:30.670]  that's the traits in the male as well, in addition to male traits, what it's passing on.
[01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:38.190]  So I think female hunting the male and knowing your lines and just something that sounds good.
[01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:45.310]  I think you touched on it earlier, James, about the donor versus the receiver and the lines that
[01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:52.110]  you know better, the lines that you are more familiar with are the males. In my case, that's
[01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:58.830]  always what I'm looking for is a male from a line that I'm familiar with. So I know the traits that
[01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:05.870]  that thing is going to pass on. In addition to the individual male, the entire stock of that male
[01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:13.710]  has traits that go along with it, the recessives, all that. So yeah, when I use a one-off thing,
[01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:19.310]  it's always the donor or the receiver rather, of course, and the known line is the pollen,
[01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:25.070]  is the male. So I think, again, it's kind of just like experience and knowing you're
[01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:32.830]  like having more experience with the lines you're passing traits on with. The stem rub to me is
[01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:40.110]  like totally ancillary. It's kind of like bonus, but it's not something to base a decision on at all.
[01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:45.710]  It's something nice to say about a plant sometimes.
[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:53.310]  But yeah, I think that selecting males is the key with breeding and it's, like you
[01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:59.950]  said, it's a million dollar question and the answer is uniform that is knowing the line and
[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:05.790]  selecting that male just like it's a female. Just as important. Showing trichrome production,
[01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:12.910]  I've noticed, especially males, similar to females, I guess, they really stack up pollen
[01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:19.470]  towards the end. So if you pull a male and just watch him stack up and see that nice big
[01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:24.830]  coal of pollen sacks, like Eric was talking about, that's totally, that's dope. But then if you really
[01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:29.230]  let that plant mature the same way you'd let a seed plant mature, the same way you'd let a female
[01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:37.150]  mature to their proper level, like we're talking about GMO, that's when I see, I don't know if it's
[01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:43.550]  correct, but I've heard it called the herd where it's like the outer shell of the pollen sacks
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:51.310]  really get like a trichrome coverage. It's a pain in the ass to see late, late in flowering,
[01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:57.230]  but it's important to let those males mature to see that trichrome coverage, to see that frost
[01:44:57.230 --> 01:45:05.150]  build up or not and say, oh, like maybe not. So that's the key. Just like being patient with
[01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:10.030]  the seed production and getting every seed that you can to mature before they start dropping out
[01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:16.830]  of there and losing them and getting every pollen sack to like frost up, hopefully, and show you
[01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:25.230]  what they're going to do, what they're going to pass on. Patience. Yeah, I'm a huge fan of
[01:45:25.230 --> 01:45:31.790]  stem rub. I feel that not just stem rub for terpene profile, because you do get some of that,
[01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:36.430]  obviously pheno hunting your males is super important, but the grease factor, if your stems
[01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:40.590]  are dry, you know, you can call that one. Typically, I want something that has a little more
[01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:46.350]  grease on the stem rub, you know, that fatty and then, you know, I love that stem smell when you're
[01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:52.350]  smelling a male and you're like, especially if you get those fuel-y smells like OGs and chems.
[01:45:55.470 --> 01:46:01.470]  Yeah, so I guess let's go to some questions, Peter. I'm sure there's a long list of questions
[01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:06.510]  that we could kind of answer for everybody. What do you got for us?
[01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:13.230]  Well, first of all, Eric, someone liked the decks in the background. So can you,
[01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:18.350]  can you, I assume you skateboard? What? Hold on.
[01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:25.550]  There we go. Yeah, no, I'm not a skateboarder. I am a huge fan of the sport. Those guys got mad
[01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:30.990]  respect for me because they put their bodies at risk with everything they do. And it's cool. I
[01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:36.750]  think they're dope. But no, I'm just a huge fan of art and any way you can produce art or put it on
[01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:42.350]  a board, any media at all, I'm a fan of. So I've got a lot of stuff where I can't show it off right
[01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:47.950]  now, but I mean, there's those ones specifically, or just different cannabis-themed ones and what
[01:46:48.430 --> 01:47:06.950]  not. But yeah, I'm just a collector. Everyone's muted.
[01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:14.630]  Including myself. Sorry about that. So there were a ton of questions along the way. I just asked
[01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:20.230]  everyone to ask them again because the questions from like half an hour ago, an hour ago are way
[01:47:20.230 --> 01:47:26.550]  back in the chat. Someone asked a while ago, minimum space design for an open pollination
[01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:32.950]  on a pack of seeds to generate more seeds. Someone else asked, are you pheno hunting F1s or
[01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:39.750]  F2s for Mosca? What is a super male and why would you use one in your breeding projects? And how
[01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:46.950]  stable are the offspring? Brandon Russ asked, how do you feel about breeding with or into,
[01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:52.070]  is it world phylotaxis? Does that make any sense to you guys?
[01:47:52.070 --> 01:48:00.870]  All right. So take one of those. The first question on the minimum space for
[01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:05.350]  you basically doing a seed raise with open pollination, if you're buying a seed pack,
[01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:11.990]  I personally don't recommend that. I think you're doing an injustice to the seed pack
[01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:17.350]  without actually going through and hunting stuff. What's your guys' take on that as well, Myles?
[01:48:18.230 --> 01:48:27.420]  I think one pack is not quite enough to bulk out of. I mean, if you're going to do something like
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:32.540]  that, it can obviously be done in a really small space. I mean, it's like, but yeah, I think at
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:40.940]  least selecting your own traits out of that, you know, ideally a couple few packs would be a better
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:49.820]  place to start for bulking seeds, raising seed. So, I mean, you could do it in a four by four tent
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:56.940]  easy. What are you talking like a 12 pack of seeds? Reg, you're talking six females and one
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:04.060]  or two males tops. Like that's easily done in a very small space. But like if you're, yeah,
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:09.020]  you're getting a, you're isolating yourself by using such a small net to begin with.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.220]  In a 12 pack of seeds, you're not guaranteed that you're going to get a winner. And,
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.420]  you know, it's only one time in my life that I got that winner in a 10 pack and it was a
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:27.020]  Fission Auto's Vanilla Berry Pie, which I talked so much shit about because it was like an $1,800
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:31.500]  pack of seeds that somebody gave me, TH Caesar gave me. And I was like, how the fuck could
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:36.780]  somebody charge so much for seeds, even though it was on the secondary market. And it turned out
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:45.660]  it was the best out of 800 and it was just a 10 pack. So what's your take Rick? I think one pack
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:53.740]  is just not enough. Honestly, I think more like five packs is really where, you know, if you're
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:50:01.500]  looking at 10 packs, excuse me, 10 seeds per pack, that's 25 females out of 50. So I think
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:08.060]  there you'll be able to get a good expression or, you know, see what the breeders designed with
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:14.860]  that cross. So I think really one is just not quite enough. What do you think Eric?
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:25.680]  No, but here's the thing, depending on what you're trying to do, there's, there'll be someone
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.800]  that would argue, Hey, I don't really care. I'm not looking for a selection. I just want to make
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.640]  a bunch of seeds and take this up to market or sell a bunch to my friends or put them on
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.680]  Instagram at a dollar a seed and bam, get on whatever they can. I don't suggest that, but I
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:43.760]  mean, that seems to be something that is kind of becoming a normality here. So yeah, you're going
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:47.840]  to end up making worse seeds than the person who created them typically. You know, I think
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:52.720]  if you're not pheno hunting the stuff and that's where the real magic with making seeds comes in
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.160]  is the pheno hunting. If you're just taking seeds and putting them together, I mean,
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:01.360]  you can do it. Anybody can breed seeds. Anybody can breed seeds and make a seed company, but are
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:05.440]  they going to make good seeds that are going to sell that are, you know, that are giving more than
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:11.360]  that, that quick buck. That's just, that's the problem with the seed industry too, is, is we got
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.280]  2000 plus seed companies and people are making garbage seeds. A lot of them, not all of them.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:21.200]  I think you guys are all making great seeds, but there's a whole bunch of people that are just
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:27.520]  making, you know, seeds that are actually affecting the gene pool negatively. So Peter,
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:38.110]  what's the next question? Well, someone asked about the hype strains of 2021. What do you guys
[01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:45.470]  see here that not what you want or you love, but what's going to be hype in 2021? Rick.
[01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:49.470]  And who wants to raise your hand if you want to start? Cause I got to unmute. All right,
[01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:56.590]  we'll go with Rick. All right. Well, it seems like your runs is having some legs to it.
[01:51:58.030 --> 01:52:09.150]  And I've also seen mother's milk of being a very popular upcoming something more creamy,
[01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:18.670]  other stuff, more savory, more meaty. So, you know, those are just a few that I've seen that
[01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:22.910]  I'm seeing that are going to be popular next year. So
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:32.100]  yeah. Miles, what do you think about the hype for 2021?
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.240]  Sue, I don't know. I mean, I keep saying,
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:46.000]  Can I add a part two to that question is what would you like to see hyped in 2021 versus what
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.960]  actually is hyped? All right. Yeah. Yeah. I think gas is, I think chem and gas and like
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.040]  sours and that kind of, I like the fruity stuff. I love the fruity stuff and the
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:06.800]  cookies flavors and all that. But I think like the chems, like the sours, these kind of elusive,
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:12.400]  skunky, nasty funks, like meaty. And I think a lot of that kind of stuff. And I would like to
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.880]  see it come back to, I like that kind of those kind of flavors. And I think a lot of the like
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:24.400]  cakes and cookies and fruities has done its thing and been a big thing and been great. I mean,
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:29.680]  some amazing flavors that we've never seen before or to a lot of us are completely unfamiliar.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:37.600]  But I think that the reek and the dank and the funk coming from a lot coming from Afghans.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:48.800]  And yeah, like cheesy funks, those kinds of things. Lime green buds, the kind of thing that
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:56.160]  doesn't necessarily go purple. Usually it's a green bud that's, the chem dogs, that kind of
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:01.040]  stuff is, I would like to see it come back. And I really do think it's like, it's already showing
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:09.280]  in a lot of places. So we'll see. Who knows? The funny thing is, is so on the West Coast,
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:17.920]  right now what the hype is, is you have to have color. It's like onto the Zaza $4,000 plus
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:25.520]  pounds that people are pushing, the $100 Ace even, the high pipe stuff that's really trendy.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:30.320]  It got to have color. It's got to have gas and it's got to have some sort of fucking fruit or
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:37.600]  lavender. Five years ago with the Ken's GDP, that went away and people didn't want purple
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.120]  for fucking six years. And now if it doesn't have any color to it, it's not up to par with the
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:50.000]  trend stuff, at least in the Bay, in Northern California with the hype stuff. I would love to
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.840]  see some more of the novel stuff come back. What's your take, Eric?
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:01.430]  Well, it's really easy for me. You just check out dungeonsofallgenetics.com and you'll find,
[01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:11.110]  I'm just joking. Yeah, bro. No, I think anything that like Miles said, I personally,
[01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:16.470]  when I moved up to Washington state, it was like 2003 and I was getting stuff that would,
[01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:20.710]  what we would refer to as loud right now, just absolutely killer. But, and to be honest with you,
[01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:28.630]  my favorite was a Northern Lights skunk haze. That sounds like straight Dutch stuff. Yeah,
[01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:33.910]  I'm good. But this was the loudest, this guy got robbed three or four times growing the shit and
[01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:39.830]  his wife finally said, we're done. No more. You'll never grow again. And that kind of stuff is gone.
[01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:45.750]  And it's like, I would pay any amount of money to get a pound of that weed back. And anyone can
[01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:49.910]  say, well, I've got that, but I've yet to see it. And I've been smoking, I mean, so many years now,
[01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:54.070]  and I've yet to see, it seems like these turps that we all grew up on and you're a lot older
[01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:58.310]  than me. Well, not a lot older. I shouldn't say that, but you know what I mean? You got a couple
[01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:03.910]  of years on me. So stuff that you grew up on in high school, stuff that I saw, it's gone. Or it
[01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:07.670]  seems like it is. If someone has it out on a Humboldt farm and they're not chatting it up on
[01:56:07.670 --> 01:56:12.950]  Instagram, but I mean, I want to see those old sours. I want to see the nasty smelling stuff
[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:20.950]  that reminds you of barfy, just gross, just nasty smelling. I want that. And I don't know where it's
[01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:27.510]  at. So it gives us all something to work toward, I guess. You got to breed it. I think that's
[01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:34.070]  what's going to have, it's like everybody's on the gelato kick, myself included, because that's
[01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:38.790]  what's trending and popular. But I feel like we need to go back to our roots and start incorporating
[01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:44.550]  some of those ammonias and those crazy smells and maybe some of the longer flowering varieties
[01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:52.870]  as far as for novel genetics. But the commercial scene is still going to want what the commercial
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:59.030]  scene wants. There's a rule that was told to me when I took a business class years ago that stuck
[01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:04.790]  with me, and it's give the baby what the baby wants. And we're all in that position. It's like
[01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:10.070]  we're creating stuff for the market and whatever the baby or the market wants,
[01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:18.310]  we got to give that. I mean, obviously with some, our interpretation and our own twist to it.
[01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:23.830]  And there's nothing wrong with deviating from the path that everyone else is on. I think that's
[01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:29.190]  great. Guys like Bodie, I would love to see more Bodie stuff. The mother's milk, we were just
[01:57:29.190 --> 01:57:33.750]  talking about that. 2021, I think could be a good year for mother's milk. I feel like it has
[01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:40.550]  some novel characteristics and yet it's could be considered a hype stream and even incorporating
[01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:52.080]  that into other stuff. What's the next question, Peter? Has anyone ever...
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:52.640]  So reversing...
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.760]  No. None of us have.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:03.920]  None of us have. Okay. All right. Let me go. Give me one second.
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:13.120]  But Rick has... I got a buddy who just did, maybe Mosk has. A buddy of mine just did that
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:21.040]  shit, reversed a male to a female. Who that is. I think he used Florel.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:24.560]  But yeah, that shit's gnarly. I don't know if I would do that.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:32.960]  So Peter, there was one question you had mentioned about a super male.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:42.160]  So I have used super males and just I'm sure everyone knows what they are, but
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:48.320]  for those who don't, super male is a male that comes out of a feminized
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:58.480]  pollination. And so I've talked to a lot of other breeders about this, including Swerve.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:08.480]  And he coined the phrase super male. And so a super male that has...
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:18.640]  And I've talked to Danny Danko about this. And Danny had said he believes super males
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:25.760]  are the result of mother nature finding a way of reproduction and continuing life.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:35.360]  And so I have found super males several times and have done pollination on stable females.
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:44.720]  But what the results were is there were intersex traits in the offspring. And so
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:52.480]  I never released any of those. And in fact, one of those was an icing from Canerado.
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:01.600]  And the super male produced pollen and hit up females. Everything looked fine until we did the
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:12.000]  testing. And with all the testers, the majority of them did have hermine plants. So we never did
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:19.840]  a release of those. But yeah, so super males, like anything else, you have to test the progeny
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.080]  to see the stability and what the results are. That's the only way to know.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:29.440]  I like that one.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:36.240]  The selection. Yeah.
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:42.400]  For autoflowers, and I just love to touch on that real quick. But the thing is, with autoflowers,
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.240]  you can't keep your clone form of a plant alive. And so what you have to do is use larger populations
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.680]  and do your phenose selection. You go through the room and you smell and you look for structure
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.360]  and shorter flowering. You look for all those things within the progeny. And those are what
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.040]  you use for your donor and receiver. And also, you want to stress those plants out a little bit
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.480]  because if you do have intersexual traits, they will express. And so you use the ones that don't
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:18.480]  express intersexual traits. So each generation with an autoflower, you're basically taking
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.600]  away intersexual traits and you're selecting for whatever it is trait-wise that you're looking for,
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:30.080]  whether it's terpene profiles, specific structure, any one of several traits or a
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.280]  combination of those traits. You have to go through and then you have to go and make seeds
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:42.880]  from those. You can use multiple and make seeds. And that's the only way you can really do it with
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.800]  autoflowers. It's a little trickier, but also saving a lot of seeds so you can go back a
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:55.920]  couple steps if you need to go back a generation or multiple generations is important. Anyone else
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:03.830]  want to touch on it? You guys do any autoflower breeding? You and I spoke a little bit. Yeah.
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:18.660]  Okay, who wants to jump in? Miles looks like he's trying to say something.
[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:28.100]  Sure. I mean, I think for autoflowering selections, you sometimes just have to pollinate the bunch
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:35.140]  and select off the pollinated plants. I've done a few runs of trying to get a stable
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:40.820]  autoflower seed, but it's just a slow process. But yeah, I think that you just have to use all
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:50.900]  the tools at your disposal. Yeah. Why is nobody smoking? I got super high a little while ago.
[02:02:54.010 --> 02:02:59.610]  And now Jim just showed up, so I got to be a little more discreet. I got stuff from Golden
[02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:05.370]  Seal and SF that I'm about to smoke. I got to find a lighter. And it's actually Sober October's over,
[02:03:05.370 --> 02:03:11.290]  so I'm going to be smoking again this month. Sober October, huh? Yeah, I quit smoking for a
[02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:14.010]  whole month. I quit drinking completely, but I quit smoking for a whole month.
[02:03:16.410 --> 02:03:18.650]  You can see that there's some Red Congolese.
[02:03:21.370 --> 02:03:27.610]  Pretty good looking stuff. I'm not sure. We got some Red Alien that I thought was super impressive
[02:03:27.610 --> 02:03:39.160]  too. Right there. It's got good form. I'm a big fan of the Red Congolese if you guys have never
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:46.520]  tried it. It's a land race variety from the Congo. There's only a handful of people that have
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:55.880]  it over here. And it smells good. It's got a real musky smell to it. You know, Durban poison,
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.880]  or not even Durban poison, but true Durban has a muskiness that's a little bit different, but
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:07.960]  also enjoyable. For me, I have a condition called ulcerative colitis, and it really helps with the
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:13.720]  ulcerative colitis. And you're trying to function on Congolese. Yeah, that's a, you know, I don't
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:17.640]  know if you're a heavy smoker, it's not a big deal, but if you're not, I wouldn't recommend it
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:29.690]  for beginners. What are you guys smoking on, Eric? I'm puffing on my, I got the Hot Rod, my Road Rage.
[02:04:29.690 --> 02:04:45.600]  This 55, probably can't see very good, but yeah, decent stuff here. Yeah. Nothing too personal.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:59.920]  And Rick? Oh, got some Hyperdrive here. I actually took the month of October off too,
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:06.800]  and now being November 1, we have to roll a couple of spliffies, and I got my cones,
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:16.410]  my king-size cones ready to go. So. Wow, respect to y'all for taking October off. I
[02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:24.410]  smoked right through it without even thinking harvesting. But yeah, I'm burning some Field Trip,
[02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:29.690]  Bodie Field Trip. It's really nice, selected by some buddies out here, and we've been growing a
[02:05:29.690 --> 02:05:36.890]  few years. Yeah, man, it's harvest season. Everybody's got like, we're all trading ounces
[02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:42.090]  and spreading it around and enjoying the, yeah, Ayahuasca Purple and Purple Punch. Yeah,
[02:05:42.090 --> 02:05:47.850]  Ayahuasca Purple is a good one, man, for sure. A buddy, a really good Hashmaker friend out here
[02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:54.890]  just did an Ayahuasca Purple to, actually to Eric's grandpa's breath, and, because he was just
[02:05:54.890 --> 02:06:00.410]  impressed by all the, you know, hash-dumping vibes of the grandpa's breath and the Ayahuasca
[02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:06.170]  Purple, both of them. Love it, man, but we're just trying to get the best you can get this
[02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:12.090]  time of year. Always like looking for the flavors, who did well, who's, you know,
[02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:17.130]  whose greenhouse or outdoor crushed it the best is always like the kind of trade-up around here and
[02:06:18.090 --> 02:06:20.010]  meeting up with people and trying to see what they got.
[02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:30.810]  Nice, yeah, I'm smoking Snow Montana. I don't know if you guys have tried it yet. I'm not sure
[02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:34.890]  what the cross is. It's one of the cookies, cookies ones. There's the Ocean Beach and the
[02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:42.330]  Snow Montana. These are just ridiculous. It's either Connected or Cookies. Hype, Hype Strains.
[02:06:42.490 --> 02:06:49.940]  So, I guess that's gonna be good for the show, man. I really appreciate you guys for coming on.
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:54.100]  I love seeing that everybody else is smoking in the crowd.
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:07:02.100]  Yeah, and it's flying by on the chat, so I'm trying to...
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:08.340]  Okay, so one last thing. Where can people go to get your seeds if they'd like to get your seeds?
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:18.260]  Eric, we'll start with you. You can go to quite a few places, but I mean, honestly, I've been
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:23.860]  letting people know recently my own website. I've been pushing my own website. I got my own...
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:28.900]  I can process stuff on there. There's no credit card processing right now, but honestly, I'm trying
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:32.180]  to stick away from that because there's just way too much complication when it comes to that.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:39.540]  Dungeonsandballgenetics.com and if you have some of your favorites you're already working with,
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:48.580]  then Neptune Seed Bank. There's NUC Forever. There's Horror Seeds. There's a ton of people,
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:52.260]  but yeah, a Google search will lead you to the way, and then you can just go with whatever
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:54.420]  you feel comfortable with.
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:57.320]  Rick?
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:07.000]  My site, there's a list of our distributors, preferred distributors, including Neptune Seed
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:16.760]  Bank, JBC, DC Seed Exchange, Seed Cellar, on and on and on, but yeah, go to our website,
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.760]  moskoseeds.com. Miles?
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:27.400]  Yeah, same way. My site, Weedshouldtastegood.com. Shoot me an email off the site.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:33.480]  There's a seed list going up on it constantly, but they're coming down as they sell out,
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:39.560]  and it's just... But all my contact is on the website, Instagram, whatever,
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:47.240]  holler, all the info is on Insta. Just send me an email, and yeah, the lists are forthcoming.
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:56.040]  It's just constantly a battle to keep stuff available and to keep things flowing along
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.800]  with proper testing and everything I can put behind it, but yeah, just holler. That's the
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:07.720]  best way to get in touch, Weedshouldtastegood.com. Yeah, I love the name, dude. I honestly think it's
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.960]  one of the best. I eat a lot of seeds, and then we should taste good as far as the best seed
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:16.360]  company names that I've heard of. I'll give thanks. Well, give thanks for the platform,
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:22.280]  too, man, Peter. This is awesome, and I'm honored to be here next to Dungeons Ball at Moscow.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.440]  Loud, everybody. Peter, super gift. Thanks for the platform. This is amazing.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:33.560]  No problem. Someone asked, are there any more shows today? No, I'm going to hang out with my
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:38.680]  kids for the rest of the Sunday, as you should all do, too.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:41.320]  Yes. Yeah.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:46.280]  Hope you guys really appreciate it. I got a surprise guest we'll be announcing once they
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:52.520]  confirm, probably Tuesday. It should be a really good show next week. I look forward to seeing you
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:58.520]  guys again. Thank you very much. All right, and with that, we will kill the live stream. Thanks,
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:01.880]  everyone.
